Chapter 1708: God Destroying Pearl

Translator: Larbre Studio Editor: Larbre Studio

That golden light was naturally the Hong Jung Golden Sword that Jian Wushuang drove with full force.

Back in the Eighth Lair, he had suppressed Sir God Qian Lan with the force of Hong Jun Golden Sword directly.

His comprehension towards Spacetime Doctrine and Reincarnation Doctrine had reached the peak of the seventh level in Doctrine Palace. When he performed Hong Jung Golden Sword, regardless of its power or speed, it was much stronger than before and it appeared in silence.

Although His Highness Mu Hong had the fighting power of a Sir God, he was caught off guard.

At the crucial moment, there was a purple light that suddenly burst out from his body. Then, it turned into a huge purple-bronze bell.

The bell covered His Highness Mu Hong entirely. As the golden light hit the purple bell hard, it let out a deep bell ring. There was a faint purple light shimmer, then the bronze bell collapsed. His Highness Mu Hong’s body fell back from the impact too.

“Humph!”

There was a chilly gleam in Jian Wushuang’s eyes. Then, Hong Jun Golden Sword quivered in the void and continued to chase after His Highness Mu Hong. Its speed was still shockingly fast.

In His Highness Mu Hong’s hand, he continued to wield his green saber and let out the shockingly imposing intention. It collided with Hong Jun Golden Sword over and over again. But His Highness Mu Hong fell backwards at every hit.

“B*stard!”

His Highness Mu Hong roared. Then, he waved his hand and a dark brawny figure appeared next to him from nowhere.

“War puppet and a Sir God level war puppet?” Jian Wushuang was surprised.

He had seen countless war puppets. There were strong ones and weak ones. However, it was his first time seeing a war puppet that could be compared favorably with a Sir God.

The person before him had just broken through and become a Sir God recently but he had a Sir God-level war puppet. His background and origins had to be extraordinary.

That was the truth. His Highness Mu Hong wasn’t that talented but he had a father that spoilt him and took flagrant measures. Not only did the father enable him to breakthrough and became Sir God with ease, his father even gave him a Sir God level was puppet to use for defense.

“Go away!”

His Highness Mu Hong roared and the black war puppet next to him launched a continuous attack. The black war puppet wielded its saber. He and his war puppet exploded their fighting powers of Sir God level while Hong Jun Golden Sword were thrown back from the impact.

“He’s not powerful but he had quite a number of treasures on hand. Previously the bell, and now a Sir God level war puppet,” Jian Wushuang’s gaze was cold. The next moment, he waved his hand and the second Hong Jun Golden Sword appeared next to him.

The second Hong Jun Golden Sword turned into a golden light instantly and burst out.

Previously, there was only one Hong Jun Golden Sword and it had already cornered His Highness Mu Hong so badly. He could only withstand it by taking out the Sir God level war puppet.

Then, another one?

Plus, the second Hong Jun Golden Sword wasn’t just another sword. The most crucial part was that when the two Hong Jun Golden Swords were used in collaboration, the overall power would increase tremendously.

Just like the Ancient God unique skill, Nine Heads Eighteen Arms, that Jian Wushuang had cultivated. Whenever there was an extra head and two arms, his close combat power would reach another higher level.

There would be a great difference between one and two Hong Jun Golden Swords.

In the void, the two golden lights driven by Jian Wushuang charged towards His Highness Mu Hong and his black war puppet continuously. He didn’t even give His Highness Mu Hong any chance to gasp for air.

“How could it be?”

“Why would it be like this?!”

His Highness Mu Hong roared and he found it unbelievable. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

He couldn’t believe that he would be forced into such a corner by Jian Wushuang, an opponent he had defeated before.

According to the experience back in Blood Demon Church, he should be able to defeat Jian Wushuang easily, even without black war puppet.

But the truth was otherwise.

Not only was he not Jian Wushuang’s match, but even when he took out his war puppet and joined the fighting forces of two Sir Gods, he would also be suppressed by Jian Wushuang. He had almost no chance to counterattack.

Plus, the golden light hit him repeatedly and every hit caused enormous power that shook his the Divine body. From the continuous hits, he was already injured. If it persisted, he would be killed by Jian Wushuang.

“If he is here, it’ll be impossible for me to get the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning. As I can’t get it, I can only forcibly destroy it!” There was a chilly gleam in His Highness Mu Hong’s eyes. He flipped his hand and there were two pearls covered in faint black thunder in his hand.

His father passed him the two pearls. They were specially prepared for the mission that day, its name was… God Destroying!

His father exhorted that if they couldn’t take the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning, he should use the two God Destroying Pearls to destroy the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning.

They couldn’t get it and they couldn’t let the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning fall into the hands of Sanctuary Alliance.

“God Destroying Pearl is powerful. One should be enough to destroy the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning. As for the remaining one…” The boundless murderous intention shimmered in His Highness Mu Hong’s eyes as he looked at Jian Wushuang directly.

He slashed with his green sickle and shot the golden light aiming at him. He retreated but it happened to be where Jian Wushuang was.

“Jian Wushuang, die!”

Then, His Highness Mu Hong extended his palm and two black lights burst out at the same time.

The two black lights, one went towards the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning while the other one aimed at Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes fixed. The moment the black light aimed at him, he had already realized something wasn’t right, especially as the pearl was letting out faint black thunder. He sensed an extremely terrifying power. The power struck fear into him.

“Back off!”

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang retreated swiftly.

As he retreated, he pointed with his finger and there was sword light that struck the God Destroying Pearl like lightning.

The God Destroying Pearl was far away from Jian Wushuang and His Highness Mu Hong intended to throw it before Jian Wushuang. But then, as the sword light hit it, it instantly exploded.

Hong! Hong!

Two vigorous explosions roared simultaneously.

The noise shook heaven and earth. The power that it brought about could shock every living thing in the universe.

Jian Wushuang had already fallen back to somewhere faraway and the explosion of God Destroying Pearl didn’t affect him. However, whatever happened before his eyes was daunting to him.

He knew clearly that he was lucky to escape the explosions of the two pearls. Otherwise, even if he wasn’t dead, he would be in a miserable condition.

“Mm?”

Jian Wushuang’s face suddenly changed and he looked at the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning.

The earlier two pearls, one went towards the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning and exploded directly. From the explosion of the pearl, the Divine Pond of Absolute Beginning… became too horrible to look at.
