“What?”

“Get out of this island as soon as possible.”

“Oh, my god, the Heartless Island was split in two!”

Countless experts were petrified at the sight of it.

Indeed, the vast Heartless Island was split in two at the moment. If it was due to Jian Wushuang’s or Qi Luosheng’s attack on the Heartless Island, the onlookers would not be surprised for that to be the case.

However, it was just because of the aftermath of the two of them colliding with each other.

The wave could affect the island thousands of meters away.

What did it mean?

All of them were shocked. Many experts, who were having a fierce fight, retreated from the Heartless Island and left the battlefield for Jian Wushuang and Qi Luosheng.

In the Void over the island, two roaring powers were still up against each other.

Their explosive power spread madly, which formed a great energy storm around them within a 100-meter radius. No one dared to intrude into this storm. Even an expert of Yang Void Realm might disappear once he entered it.

In the center of the battlefield, Jian Wushuang looked cold, with continuous sword essence bursting out.

Qi Luosheng’s face fell slightly. He did not expect that his full attack would have been blocked by Jian Wushuang. Although Jian Wushuang improved his strength greatly, he remained at the Peak of Yang Void Realm. There was a huge gap between his level and Divine Transcendence.

However, Qi Luosheng did not know that Jian Wushuang had cultivated Heavenly Creation Skill.

It made him 10 times stronger than that of Cultivation of Spiritual Power at the Peak of Yang Void Realm.

More importantly, Jian Wushuang comprehended Origin more deeply than Qi Luosheng.

Jian Wushuang’s Triple-kill Sword was the inferior second-grade magic weapon and the Sword Skill he displayed was superior third-grade.

As for weapon and unique skill, Qi Luosheng was much weaker than Jian Wushuang.

“Qi Luosheng.” Jian Wushuang suddenly spoke and looked towards Qi Luosheng with cold eye.

“Hmm?” Qi Luosheng slightly raised his head.

“Do you know I just struck the blow with 70 percent of my strength,” Jian Wushuang said.

“What?” Qi Luosheng was shocked.

He had already tried his best to attack him, but Jian Wushuang just used 70 percent of his strength?

“How could it be possible?”

“It’s said that pay back in one’s own coin. Now I will pay you back,” Jian Wushuang said coldly, “therefore, I’ll let you know my full strength.”

Jian Wushuang instantly burst out his full strength.

Thump... The sword shadow, who had been collided with the ancient giant finger, suddenly had immense roaring power.

The two forces had been in stalemate, but now as the power of sword shadow increased greatly, the ancient giant finger immediately showed a sign of being in a huge disadvantage.

Chi! Chi! Chi! A hole was pierced in the center of the ancient giant finger, which was made of Spiritual Power. Then the giant finger lost its defense and was shattered in the blink of an eye.

After the giant finger was crushed, the powerful force swept over. Qi Luosheng could not help but step back.

When a figure suddenly appeared beside him, Qi Luosheng immediately felt a strong killing intent attack his body.

“This is bad.” Qi Luosheng was scared, with a sense of crisis starting to emerge in his heart.

Whoosh! A flash of sword shadow rushed towards him.

After the sword shadow came out, the Long Sword was still shaking madly, letting out the echo of sword, as if it was extremely hungry.

“Hmph!”

After all, Qi Luosheng was the super expert of Divine Transcendence. Despite being faced with a crisis, he was still composed. A large quantity of Spiritual Power gathered in his left hand, and formed armor-like black crystals. Then he used it against the splendid sword shadow.

“Ridiculous!”

Jian Wushuang mocked. With the outburst of his strength, Triple-kill Sword emitted a cold light, slashing at the layer of the black crystals on Qi Luosheng’s palm. When touching the crystals, the sword light just stopped for a second, and then cut through the layer of the black crystals, as if it was cutting a piece of tofu. It even hurt Qi Luosheng’s palm.

Chi! Five fingers flying out at the same time.

“The sword...”

Qi Luosheng glanced at the Long Sword with a flicker of terror in his eyes. Then he retreated as far as possible.

After stabilizing his stance, Qi Luosheng held his severed palm tightly. Crack! His blood-red wicked mask, which had been broken during the fight, cracked at this moment. An extremely old, ugly face showed up.

His face was completely distorted.

A large number of warriors out of the Heartless Island were immediately exhilarated.

They were shocked at Jian Wushuang’s strength.

Jian Wushuang cut off a palm of a super expert of Divine Transcendence.

They were also shocked at Qi Luosheng’s face. It was unexpected that an old ugly woman was the Tower Master of Blood Feather Tower.

“Unexpectedly, the legendary Tower Master of Blood Feather Tower is an old woman.”

Jian Wushuang held Triple-kill Sword, with the soaring sword essence. At this moment, he had appeared beside Jian Nantian.

“The magic weapon? Jian Wushuang, you are just at the Yang Void Realm. How can you own such a weapon? From the power of the weapon, it might not be a usual third-grade magic weapon.” Qi Luosheng slight raised her head with her distorted look. She looked at Triple-kill Sword with a flicker of fear and fever in her eyes.

The magic weapons were definitely treasures in the Nanyang Continent.

Expert for Jian Wushuang, no one in the Tianzong Dynasty had magic weapons.

She had noticed that the Long Sword was extraordinary, but she did not expect that the sword was a magic weapon. With the help of this weapon, Jian Wushuang had just cut off her palm.

“However, you are too naive if you thought you would be able to leave this island alive.” Qi Luosheng suddenly laughed hideously.

“Huh?” Jian Wushuang squinted, with an ominous presentiment.

“Master Xiao Nan, it’s your turn.” Qi Luosheng spoke in a low voice.

The moment Qi Luosheng finished her words, a terrifying power suddenly swept over from a corner of the Heartless Island. The power was much stronger than that from Qi Luosheng who attacked with her full strength.

In the blink of an eye, the whole Heartless Island went still.

All people present were terrified.

No one expected that another Divine Transcendence was on the Heartless Island.

The man was even stronger than Qi Luosheng.
