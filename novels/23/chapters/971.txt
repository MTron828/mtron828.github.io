Chapter 972: Slaughter

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

“Let me introduce myself...”

“I’m the Emperor’s son-in-law of the Great Tang... Jian Wushuang!”

His crisp voice resounded in the world, brewing an unexpected storm that shook everyone.

Everyone, be it experts from the three big countries or those inside the imperial palace, widened their eyes in disbelief.

Jian Wushuang?

The peerless genius that showcased his incredible strength and talent 1,200 years ago? The one who saved Tang of the East from destruction all by himself?

“Isn’t he dead?”

“How?”

“How are you still alive?”

Dao Master Gu Ji stared at Jian Wushuang with uncertainty before his murderous intent returned.

“Humph! So what if you’re Jian Wushuang? You’re still only in the Eternal Realm! In the battle of the imperial palace 1,000 years ago, you must have used a trump card to show such incredible strength! It’s unfortunate you won’t be able to use such a trump card again!” Gu Ji said coldly.

His expression became more twisted.

He was extremely jealous of Jian Wushuang.

Now that he had seen Jian Wushuang in person, he began harboring the ambition and desire to defeat Jian Wushuang in front of everyone and enhance his reputation all across the Eternal World.

“I don’t believe someone from the Eternal Realm can be this powerful!”

Gu Ji moved once more following his crazed roar.

Dark flashes of blinding light surrounded his spear as it pierced ahead. The light shrouded his eyes too.

“Venomous Dragon Killing!”

With an incredulous murderous intent, the spear and the dark lights pierced forth.

That was the perfect showcase of the power of a top-tier Rank Two Dao Master!

He utilized his trump card, making this attack stronger than the previous one. Furthermore, he aimed at Jian Wushuang’s midbrows this time.

Jian Wushuang smiled in the face of such a terrifying force and didn’t even try to evade it. Instead, he spread his red robe open like a scarlet armor and it perfectly enveloped his head. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Clang!”

The sound of metal colliding once again resounded, alongside the sparks of flames. Jian Wushuang didn’t budge.

“Impossible!”

Gu Ji shrieked crazily, in disbelief over the fact that his attack was ineffective.

The previous spear merely touched Jian Wushuang’s body. With his intense physical strength, it was entirely possible for him to defend himself perfectly.

However, Gu Ji couldn’t accept that his trump card and his full force attack aimed at Jian Wushuang’s midbrows still left him unscathed.

“Exactly how terrifying is his defense?”

Everyone spectating this battle shared the same thoughts.

“How can he be unscathed after receiving the brunt of a top-tier Rank Two Dao Master’s full force attack? How many people in the Green Fire World can do the same?”

These people were unaware that Jian Wushuang’s strong physical body and Blood-killing Plate Armor, which reduced 99 percent of the force of the attack, could defend him from even Rank Three Dao Masters.

“I let you attack with your spear twice. Shouldn’t you face one of my fingers now?” Jian Wushuang smiled mockingly.

“Oh no!”?Gu Ji was petrified.

Jian Wushuang didn’t give him any chance to escape. His Ancient God Power, which had achieved the Three-star power, condensed on the index finger of his right hand, spreading its aura all across the land.

“Ancient God Finger, Barrier-breaking!”

Jian Wushuang pointed his index finger, which contained an intense force, at Gu Ji in front of him.

“Boom!” A giant hole was ripped open in the Void. Within the changing colors of the heavens, a giant gold finger came flying from the distant past. It shot right out of the hole and directly hit Gu Ji.

As a top-tier Rank Two Dao Master, Gu Ji couldn’t help using all his life-preserving trump cards for survival. He ran and screamed, all while still struggling. However, such struggles seemed futile in face of the giant gold finger.

Without a single chance of escape, he was entirely crushed and killed by the giant gold finger.

“Now, let me settle the three of you.”

Jian Wushuang stared coldly at the three Dao Master on the side of the battlefield.

Since the three of them had come here with Gu Ji to mock Emperor Xiao and Emperor Yun, Jian Wushuang wouldn’t simply let them off.

“Let’s run!”

“Hurry and run!”

They scrambled to escape once they saw that they were at a complete disadvantage.

Jian Wushuang sneered as he used his Mind-controlling Secret Skill.

Mind-controlling Secret Skill was another Secret Skill from the Ancient Gods. The effectiveness of the skill improved alongside his enhanced Ancient God Power.

The sudden consciousness attack on the three Dao Masters completely stunned them as they were only Rank One Dao Masters. Their bodies inevitably stopped moving.

Then, the devastatingly beautiful sword shadow descended.

It was as cold and beautiful as snowflakes from the winter as it sliced their throats and destroyed their life cores.

The three corpses fell to the ground.

Jian Wushuang kept their Interspatial Rings and snorted. “With my strength and Mind-controlling Secret Skill, it’s a piece of cake for me to kill Rank One Dao Masters.”

Dao Masters were all capable experts with good life-preserving abilities.

Normally, it would be hard for them to even die.

However, thanks to consciousness attacks such as Mind-controlling Secret Skill, it was indeed easy for him to slaughter Rank One and Rank Two Dao Masters.

After killing the four Dao Masters, Jian Wushuang raised his head and stared ahead.

10 experts from the three big countries had already gathered in front of him. Three people led them.

They were here to rescue Gu Ji after realizing that he was in danger. However, Jian Wushuang struck too quickly and instantly killed the four Dao Masters, making it impossible for them to do anything.

“Jian Wushuang.”

The experts stood there, looking at Jian Wushuang with extremely complicated emotions.
