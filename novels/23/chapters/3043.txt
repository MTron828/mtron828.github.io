Chapter 3043: Four Opportunities (First Half)

_____________

Xue Bei’s expression was obviously a bit desolate.

Right, no matter how brilliant and arrogant he used to be, he still died in the end.

What was left now was only a trace of consciousness.

“Heavenly Sword Marquis, if you can pass the test I set, then the opportunities in this secret realm will be handed to you. I left four opportunities in this secret realm,” Xue Bei said.

“Four?” Jian Wushuang’s eyes lit up and his heart was full of expectation.

“First is the first opportunity.”

Xue Bei waved his hand and took out an interspatial ring.

“This is…” Jian Wushuang looked at the interspatial ring in confusion.

“This is all the resources and treasures that I have collected in my life. They are all in this interspatial ring,”Xue Bei said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang’s eyes couldn’t help reddening.

The treasures and resources that Xue Bei had collected in his life?

Wasn’t this all of Xue Bei’s wealth?

This was an extremely powerful principles master. All of his wealth? How many resources and treasures did he have?

Jian Wushuang could not imagine.

“Don’t be happy too early. This interspatial ring is not meant for you.” Just as Jian Wushuang was excited, Xue Bei poured cold water on him.

Jian Wushuang could not help but be stunned.

Xue Bei had just said that he would give him an opportunity, and then he took out this interspatial ring. In the end, it was not for him?

“It’s true that this interspatial ring is what I’ve collected all my life, but I intend to leave these things to the blood ancestor lineage. After all, there is competition among all the factions in the Divine Ancestor Daoist sect. This competition is very fierce, and the blood ancestor lineage also desperately needs the resources that I’ve left behind. The reason why I’m taking it out now is that I hope you can give it to the blood ancestor lineage in the future.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Of course, I’ve already set a special restriction on the interspatial ring. Only the unique means of the blood ancestor bloodline can unlock it. Otherwise, even a principles master can not open it,” Xue Bei said.

Jian Wushuang’s expression became even more strange.

Xue Bei glanced at Jian Wushuang, he said, “Heavenly Sword Marquis, although you didn’t take me as your master, you passed my test and can inherit my legacy. You can barely be considered half a disciple of me, so you can be considered a member of the blood ancestor’s bloodline. It’s not too much for me to ask you to give this interspatial ring to the blood ancestor’s bloodline.”

“It’s not too much, of course it’s not too much.” Jian Wushuang just smiled awkwardly.

“You don’t have to be too disappointed. Although I won’t give you this interspatial ring that I’ve collected all my life, I’ve also chosen three special treasures for you. These three treasures are my first opportunity for you,”Xue Bei said.

Hearing this, Jian Wushuang looked forward to it again.

“First is the first treasure.”

Xue Bei waved his hand, and a one-meter-long jade ruler appeared in front of Jian Wushuang.

The jade ruler had a unique shape, and its body was carved with extremely complicated secret patterns. These secret patterns covered the entire body of the jade ruler.

Moreover, the jade ruler was surrounded by two completely different powers, ice and fire.

Seeing the jade ruler in front of him, Jian Wushuang’s expression could not help but change.

From the first glance at the jade ruler, he could already tell that it was extraordinary.

“This aura is extraordinary and superior… What level is this treasure?” Jian Wushuang exclaimed.

He had seen many treasures, and the most amazing one was naturally the mountain river map.

However, because the level of the map was too high, Jian Wushuang could not see the specific level of the map.

Other than the map, the other treasures Jian Wushuang had seen were probably far inferior to the jade ruler.

“This is the ice-fire swimming dragon ruler. It’s a domain-type supreme treasure that I obtained by chance a long time ago,” Xue Bei said.

“Supreme treasure?” Jian Wushuang’s pupils constricted.

In the Divine Beginning World, there were all kinds of treasures, from Earth Treasures to Heavenly Treasures to Holy Treasures!

Holy Treasures were only used by the Immortal Saint, but the principles masters, whose strength far surpassed that of the Immortal Saint, used Supreme Treasures!

The Supreme Treasure of Heaven and earth was extremely powerful!

Jian Wushuang finally understood why the jade ruler’s aura was so extraordinary and superior. It turned out to be a supreme treasure!

And it was a domain-type supreme treasure!

Among all kinds of treasures in the world, attack weapons and body-protection armors were the most common, while domain-type, suppression-type, and soul-type treasures were very rare.

Such a rare treasure was much more valuable than ten attack weapons of the same level.

A domain-type supreme treasure was naturally comparable to more than ten attack weapons of the same level!

“If a cultivator wants to go further, he first has to survive in all kinds of dangers or environments. Only by living longer will he be able to walk a longer path in the future. That’s why I left you this ice and fire swimming dragon ruler so that you can control your domain. With the help of your domain, as long as you don’t encounter too strong an enemy, you can leave whenever you want, stay whenever you want, and seize the opportunity.”

“You’ll need this ice-fire swimming dragon ruler in the future,” Xue Bei said.

“Yes, of course.” Jian Wushuang was very excited.

Of course, he needed a domain-type supreme treasure!

After all, he was good at domains.

Previously, he had relied on the combination of the nine bends blood light river, star armor domain, and prison of punishment to suppress cultivators of the same level.

However, because of his great increase in strength, this domain technique gradually weakened.

There was nothing he could do. The nine bends bloody light river was only a third-grade holy treasure. It was still very effective against some False Saints or ordinary first-grade True Saints, but at the second and third-grade True Saints level…the suppression effect of the nine bends bloody light river was negligible.

As for the prison of punishment, it was just one of the methods of the secret skill divine punishment.

This method was just the most basic method. It formed a golden domain to trap the opponent and at the same time, produce a certain domain suppression effect.

However, as Jian Wushuang had cultivated the divine punishment god to 30,000 feet high, this method was rarely used, because the effect was just so-so.

The only domain that had a good effect was the star armor domain.

After the nine luminaries star armor reached the heavenly armor chapter, the star armor domain it used still had a certain oppressive effect.

Now, if he got the ice-fire swimming dragon ruler and used the power of this domain-type supreme treasure, he did not need to use too much. Even if he only used 10% of it, it would be enough to greatly increase his battle strength. With the star armor domain, it would be even better! The effect would be even better!

Without hesitation, Jian Wushuang waved his hand and took the ice-fire swimming dragon ruler. Xue Bei did not stop him.
