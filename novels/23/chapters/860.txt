Chapter 861: Setting out

Translator: Transn Editor: Transn

It was still in midair in the untouched rift.

Jian Wushuang, dressed in a black robe, stood there indifferently. There were dozens of Blood-sky Swords densely suspended in front of him.

“Combine.”

With Jian Wushuang’s roar, the dozens of Blood-sky Swords immediately combined at an astonishing speed to form a scarlet longsword as long as six meters.

Hum~~~

The scarlet longsword was surrounded by an air current, giving off an astonishing air of violence.

“Go.”

Controlled by Jian Wushuang’s thoughts, the scarlet longsword flitted.

Swish!

A Blood Shadow flashed by, but left no trace in the air.

The next moment, a slight swish came from a high mountain hundreds of meters away. Then the top half of the mountain was lifted and dropped sideways. In the middle of the mountain was an extremely smooth and neat cut made by a sharp blade.

This giant mountain was split into two halves by one single slash. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Hum!

The sword rung, and the six-meter-long scarlet longsword appeared again beside Jian Wushuang.

Jian Wushuang’s eyes flashed brightly as he saw the extremely neat cut in the center of the mountain ahead.

“This is dreadful! It turns out to be strongest sword formation created by Sunrise Sword Emperor and Dao Master Spirit. This Ninth-heaven Sword Formation really is terrifying!”

“The first sword formation alone is scary enough.”

“Too fast! Its speed is too fast and its power is even more amazing.”

In Jian Wushuang’s eyes was a maniacal gaze.

“With my current ability, if I deploy the first sword formation with all my strength, there’ll probably be few Eternal Realm cultivators who could parry it.”

“It’s definitely a great killer!”

“It’ll be my strongest Killing Move.”

Jian Wushuang had lots of skills, like Boundless Heaven Sword Art and Three Fingers of the Ancient God. They were all awesome.

However, the Boundless Heaven Sword Art was far weaker than the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

The Three Fingers of the Ancient God was the supreme unique skill of the Ancient God Clan, but with his weak strength, Jian Wushuang couldn’t give full play to the real power of the unique skill at all. Therefore, Jian Wushuang’s current strongest move was the first sword formation of the Ninth-heaven Sword Formation.

“It’s lucky that I can master such a great Killing Move before entering the Stellar Fog Sea. In fact, I should also really thank my First Senior Brother.” Jian Wushuang smiled faintly, but his expression soon turned serious.

“I’ve mastered the first sword formation and I have prepared everything else I need to prepare. Now, it’s time to begin.”

He lifted his head and looked up at the sky for a second, and then went straight back.

After all, it had been a year. His time was up.

Jian Wushuang would go into the Stellar Fog Sea together with Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin. But before they set out, Jian Wushuang would first go to the palace.

With his status as a Three-clawed Blood Eagle Guard, it wasn’t difficult for him to enter the palace. Soon, he met Leng Rushuang again.

Jian Wushuang only had a quick cup of tea in the courtyard of Leng Rushuang’s residence before leaving again.

“Wait for me! I’ll bring the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit back for you, for sure!”

Jian Wushuang thought to himself.

At no point did Leng Rushuang ever know that Jian Wushuang was about to go to the Stellar Fog Sea to find her the Yin-Yang Dragon-phoenix Fruit.

It was in the magnificent scarlet temple, the lair of the Blood Eagle Guards.

Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin all arrived, and Commander Hong sat there on the throne at the front of the temple.

Soon, Jian Wushuang had also arrived.

“Well, now that everyone is here, let’s set out now. I will take you to a branch of the Void Temple first. The Void Temple will have the fastest wormholes to the Stellar Fog Sea.”

Jian Wushuang and the other three had long been ready. They all nodded slightly and followed Commander Hong.

They entered the branch of the Void Temple, and Commander Hong paid the transmission fee for the four. They went through the transmission channel and soon arrived at the Stellar Fog Sea.

Jian Wushuang, Jiu Zui, Ling Long and Shui Jin stood side by side above the void. They stared at the territory ahead of them, completely shrouded in gray fog. They couldn’t see anything inside with the naked eye.

The entire territory was deathly quiet.

“That... is the legendary Stellar Fog Sea?” Jiu Zui looked a little solemn.

“I heard about the Stellar Fog Sea long ago, but I didn’t expect I would ever actually go inside and explore it one day,” Ling Long said in a deep voice.

“We have with us the restriction personally set by Empress Leng. Even if we know it is almost certain death, we must still enter it.”

They were all completely prepared, but as they were about to enter the Stellar Fog Sea, their hearts inevitably sank.

Jian Wushuang marveled to himself. “Empress Leng is really brilliant! Her restriction actually forces me to bring both of my Original Bodies into the Stellar Fog Sea. It’s impossible to leave one of them behind!”

Jian Wushuang had two Original Bodies, and each of which had their own consciousness. When either one was destroyed, the other one would be restored.

This was a big advantage for Jian Wushuang.

Originally, Jian Wushuang had planned to bring the World Body and leave the Slaughter Body behind when he went to the Stellar Fog Sea with his skills and trump cards, so that even if he was in danger and his body died, he would only lose his World Body and the treasure brought by it, and he could still save his life.

If the treasure was lost, he could still find a way to get it back, but if he died, he would have nothing.

Jian Wushuang had good intentions, but unfortunately, Empress Leng seemed to have anticipated that someone would come who knew the Doppelganger Secret Skill. So her restriction confined Jian Wushuang’s two Original Bodies.

If one of his Original Bodies was left behind, Empress Leng’s restriction would instantly activate and kill him.

“Folks, we’re about to enter the Stellar Fog Sea. No one has any idea what kind of danger really lurks within up to now. When we get there, we only have a fighting chance of surviving if the four of us work together. So before we go in, everyone will say which method they will use so that we can coordinate with each other,” Jiu Zui suggested.

Jian Wushuang, Ling Long and Shui Jin all nodded in agreement.

In places like the Stellar Fog Sea, not working together was courting death.

Knowing each person’s method would indeed be of great use to their cooperative effort.
