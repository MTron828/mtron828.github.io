Chapter 820: Domineering Lin Xiu!

With the impact from the ‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flower’, Huang Lin was still pushed backwards even when he already had his ‘Yuan’ released.

For someone like him, this was shameful!

Huang Lin screamed once again as he waved his right hand. The white source energy was gathered and it formed a physical sword.

He materialised his source energy?!

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank uncontrollably when he noticed what happened.

Xiu – –

Then, within a blink of an eye, Huang Lin’s figure appeared right in front of Lin Xiu.

The sword in his arm was thrusted forward – sharp and quick.

Lin Xiu’s combat suit was cut open.

This was a combat suit with the highest defensive capacity but yet at times like these, it was useless.

This showed how sharp the sword actually was.

Lin Xiu clenched his jaw and looked towards Luo Yue and Luo Yan who were fighting with their best efforts. That’s when he felt the blood in his body boiling.

He can’t die!

Luo Yue had just returned to him. He has to protect her!

When he thought of how he saw Luo Yue severely injured in order to protect him when they were back on earth, he had sworn that he would never let Luo Yue be injured ever again.

“AHHHHHH!!!!!”

Lin Xiu roared. All of the muscle in his body became tense and he gathered all of the energy that he had in his body.

The long spear seemed to be able to detect the spirit of its owner and it was shaking violently as well!

“Go to hell!!”

Seeing how Huang Lin was swinging his sword, about to pierce it through him, Lin Xiu screamed once again. This time, he did not block the attack, instead he attacked Huang Lin instead!

“Dumbass!!”

When Huang Lin saw Lin Xiu coming toward him, Huang Lin shouted as well.

His weapon now was made of the magnificent source energy and this was the strongest sword ever. The sword was incomparable to any other weapons made.

“Off with your head!!”

The sword was glowing brightly and as Huang Lin swung it, there were loud explosions in the air.

It was as if the sword could slice the air into pieces!

“Clean….sweep!”

Lin Xiu stared at the sword that was headed toward him as he continue to gather all his source energy onto his spear.

With his spear, the air around seemed to be distorted by the large amount of energy in it.

Before Huang Lin could get close enough to Lin Xiu, the spear that could break the sky had already pierced through his head.

Boom – –

His head was sliced off. As he was gathering his source energy, there was so much pressure his head bopped off his neck and flew at least 3 metres high.

Huang Lin, the king warrior – DEAD!

Lin Xiu’s EXP grew to 96% but it still wasn’t enough.

“How is this even possible?!”

The rest of the warrior king were still floating in the air as if they were gods. They wanted to see how Huang Lin would torture Lin Xiu.

However, they did not expect Huang Lin to fail. In fact, Lin Xiu was the one who finished him!

The skill that looked boring and simple had such terrifying strength!

“How did that happen?!”

The look on Luo Jiucheng’s face changed as well.

Huang Lin from the royal family was defeated by a young man!

“Did you really think that warrior kings are gods?!”

The young man asked arrogantly as he pointed his spear to the sky.

He stood on the ground but he looked at those in the sky as if they were nothing.

“You’re mad!!”

The warrior kings in the air did not waste any time. All of them moved at the same time and were headed towards the ground!

“Luo Jiucheng, you will deal with those from your family. We will get rid of this arrogant man!”

One of the warrior king screamed.

From how Lin Xiu had killed Huang Lin, it gave him a sense of danger.

They didn’t have time to think. They just wanted to kill Lin Xiu!

“Did you think that you’re the only ones that could fly?”

Lin Xiu looked at the warrior kings who were headed towards him from the sky. He did not run and instead, gathered all the energy once again and leaped into the air!

‘Levitation’!

Lin Xiu had already mastered the mysterious warrior skill that Liu Yanran sent to him. It was something that was only passed down to the descendants of the Wu family.

“Damn it!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was running for his life and was in the air instead, the warrior kings turned furious. All of them grabbed onto their weapons, gathered their source energy and attacked Lin Xiu!

Koong Loong – –

There was a deafening sound that rang in the air. As they rushed forward, Lin Xiu’s body seemed to be affected by the strengths of the warrior skills. His entire body immediately disappeared!

“HMPH!”

Before they realised what was happening, there was a cold sneer in the air.

They quickly looked up and realised that Lin Xiu was not dead. In fact, he was in the air above them.

The long spear was aimed at them and there were flaming birds coming at them!

“Hellfire…..?

These warrior kings obviously heard of how the hellfire had disappeared from the Divine Fire Cave. After seeing Lin Xiu’s warrior skill, they finally understood what happened.

There was actually someone who dared to absorb the hellfire and most importantly, he succeeded?!

Is he a monster?!

“Dark Demon Domain!”

“Giant Tree Domain!”

“Golden Fire Domain!”

All of the warriors screamed in unison as they released their domain forces.

Previously, Lin Xiu might not be able to overcome the strength of the domain forces that belonged to a warrior king but as his abilities grew and with his current strength, Lin Xiu was confident that their domain forces would be useless.

Lin Xiu, who was still in the air, raised his left hand. There was a bright white light coming from it and the energy was coming from Lin Xiu’s body.

“Disappear!”

Lin Xiu then threw his left hand onto the ground.

The bright light headed towards the ground as well. The domain forces that the warrior kings used instantly disappeared! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“My domain?!”

The warrior widened their eyes in shock as they couldn’t believe what was happening! There were dozens of warrior kings who released their domain forces together but all of them disappeared at the same time!

Lin Xiu looked down at the warrior kings who were in shock. As for him, he was filled with energy.

The bright light that came from the old man in the Tower of Trials was coming to use now. It was a little dull earlier but now, it was shining like crazy.

Kong – –

Then, Lin Xiu looked into the distance and noticed that there was a large number of warriors on drones and even giant evolved beasts headed in their direction.

Looks like these people are determined to kill him.

“Get out here now!”

Lin Xiu screamed and immediately activated the ‘Exotic Summoning’!

Lin Xiu noticed that this particular skill could be upgraded as well!

As his level got higher, the evolved beast that he would be able to summon would be even more powerful!

Boom – –

With a loud sound, there was a huge space that was open in the air.

From the space, there was a pair of huge, red eyes!
