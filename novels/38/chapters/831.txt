Chapter 832: New Discovery

Chen Dong mumbled to himself.

“Report! There are hidden corals ahead. Should we still continue?”

Just as the cruise continued sailing, one of the staff walked onto the deck and asked Chen Dong.

He frowned after hearing what was told.

“Be more careful but continue with the journey.”

Chen Dong thought about it for a moment before answering him.

“Yes, Sir!”

The cruise continued sailing forward and slowly, the cruise started shaking as well.

They were now closer to the scene ahead and everything seemed even clearer now.

“It’s true. It is an island!”

One of the warriors saw clearly what was ahead of them and screamed in excitement.

Lin Xiu turned around and looked at it as well. He finally got to take a better look.

It was indeed an island that was pitch black.

The island was large and there were lots of weird plants grown on it that were black in colour. Even the corals were black in colour, making it look extremely odd.

“Why is there such a weird island here?”

Luo Yue turned towards the other side and she was shocked as well.

“Should we go onto the island to take a closer look?”

Some of the warriors were asking Chen Dong curiously.

It has already been three days since they decked the cruise. Now that they’ve seen land, they were getting excited and was dying to see what was on it.

“Sure. Be cautious.”

Chen Dong nodded his head with a curious look in his eyes as well when they got closer to the island.

Boom – –

As they stopped by the island, the entire cruise shook.

It was because they had hit onto the corals.

However, with the experienced crew on ship, they managed to steady the cruise quickly and slowly parked by the side of the island.

“Come on. Let’s take a look.”

Chen Dong looked at everyone around him and invited them to join him on the island.

The rest of them nodded their heads and walked towards the ladder.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue.

“En.”

Luo Yue nodded her head and walked side by side with Lin Xiu.

“This really is an island...”

Some of them who had gotten off the ship first, landed on top of the sand filled island as they exclaimed.

“Eh?”

“There’s something here.”

One of the younger warriors noticed something on the ground. Without thinking much, he dug on the ground with his weapon.

Soon, there was a human skeleton that appeared.

“F**K!”

The man jumped in fear when he saw what it was.

“What’s going on?”

Chen Dong frowned when he heard the commotion. As he turned around, he saw the skull that was on the ground.

He was sure that this was a human skeleton.

“Someone....has been here?”

The rest of them saw what was on the ground and were surprised.

Lin Xiu got curious. From where he was standing, he held onto his spear with his left hand, applied a little energy onto his weapon and pushed away all the sand that was on the ground.

Underneath it, there were lots of skeleton bones overlapping each other.

“This.....”

Chen Dong felt goosebumps all over his body when he saw what was beneath his feet.

The sky was now covered with dark clouds and the entire atmosphere was feeling extremely creepy.

“Something’s odd.”

“Leader Chen, do we continue then?”

One of the warriors looked a little hesitant.

Although they were relatively confident with their abilities, they could still feel that there was something particularly odd on this island.

They had no idea what was on this island and what would appear next.

Chen Dong was a little hesitant as well.

“Look at this.”

Then, another warrior waved to all of them after discovering something on the ground.

All of them turned towards him and noticed that there was a piece of wood on the ground.

It looked aged but it was not rotten.

But, there was still algae grown all over it.

“That’s.....Fire Lord Wood!”

Chen Dong quickly walked over. His face was filled with disbelief as he looked at the piece of wood in front of him.

“What’s a fire lord wood?”

Some of them were stunned and asked subconsciously.

“It’s a special type of wood. It is extremely strong and is resistant to both fire and water.”

“Most importantly, that ship in the past was made of this material.”

The rest of them who were still a little confused were now shocked.

If that’s the case, does that mean that this island is related to the ghost ship?!

As they thought about it, most of them got excited.

If this was true, there was progress in locating what they were looking for!

“Let’s take a look.”

Chen Dong thought the same as well. They had discovered his piece of wood here and even if it was only a small piece, it was still a huge discovery.

“Come. Let’s get going!”

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue followed the crowd as they walked deeper into the island.

The island was like a mountain with a sloping edge.

There were other trees and plants around them but all of them were black in colour; even the flowers around them were black. It looked incredibly weird.

“What on earth are these?”

Some of the warriors mumbled.

Koong Loong – –

Then, there was a loud explosive sound coming from the sky and followed by lots of lightning that shot across the sky.

“Looks like a storm is coming.”

One of the warriors frowned as they looked at the sky.

Wung wung wung – –

“There’s something ringing in my ears.”

Luo Yue frowned as she said to Lin Xiu.

“Beauty, you must have heard it wrongly.”

One of the men with a perverted look on his face turned around and smiled at her.

Luo Yue was incredibly gorgeous and even when she was cold the entire time, there were still some of them who still wanted to flirt with her.

However, the only thing that was holding them back was how Lin Xiu defeated the Overload Octopus with his terrifying warrior skills.

“Look Out!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Lin Xiu felt something and quickly stood in front of Luo Yue.

“What are you afraid of?”

The man had just finished his sentence when he felt something the size of a fly biting his neck.

He looked annoyed and subconsciously hit himself on the neck.

Koong Loong – –

Following that, there was a huge explosion.

Lin Xiu had already released his ‘Yuan’ and protected Luo Yue and himself.

“What....on earth just happened?!”

The rest of them reacted quickly as well and that’s when they saw the man’s body blown into ashes. All of them felt chills running down their spine.

Chen Dong was the one who looked extremely awful.

There were 18 of them and he had just sacrificed one of them.

He just died for no reason!

“Did the both of you notice something wrong?!”
