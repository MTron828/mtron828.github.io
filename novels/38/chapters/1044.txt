Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Boom–

As the spear attacked, a loud noise sounded at this moment.

The energy barrier of his mechanical mount was directly knocked out by the Dark Edge spear.

“you…”

The pupils in Bai Zhanfei’s eyes shrank and the strength of his body was about to explode.

boom–

But at the next moment, a matrix framed his entire being.

The pupils in Bai Zhanfei’s eyes shrank slightly and his body wanted to struggle.

But no matter how hard he tried, there was no way to break free from the shackles of this matrix.

there was no way to mobilize his source strength!

In this space source mark matrix, even the Sage warrior-level warriors had no way to break free, not to mention Bai Zhanfei, a Respected warrior-level warrior.

“Let me out, let me out!”

Bai Zhanfei roared loudly with a ferocious expression at this time.

He used all the strength of his body, but there was still no way.

“Bai family, Bai Zhanfei, right?”

Lin Xiu looked at him and said lightly.

“I’m the Bai family! If you dare to kill me, you will die!”

Bai Zhanfei looked at Lin Xiu, still roaring loudly.

He has always been arrogant and domineering. When has he been treated like this?

“Tell me, what is your status in the Bai family?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Trash! Let me out!”

But Bai Zhanfei still ignored Lin Xiu’s words at this time and still roared as if he didn’t care.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly and snapped his fingers with his raised right hand.

Snapped–

With a crisp sound, many water droplets suddenly condensed in the air.

Then, extremely small water needles were formed.

In the next moment, these water needles stabbed towards Bai Zhanfei’s hands!

bang bang bang-

As those tiny water needles penetrated his hands, Bai Zhanfei, who was still roaring, suddenly felt a huge pain!

“what!!!”

His whole body trembled wildly and let out a wailing scream.

The ten fingers were hurting badly and now there were a lot of dense pores in his hands.

These are all produced by those water needles running through his hands.

At this time, blood started to flow out.

“I’m giving you a chance to answer my question honestly.”

Lin Xiu looked at him and said lightly.

“I… I’m the direct descendant of the Bai family…”

Bai Zhanfei actually said out of breath.

After experiencing the pain just now, he would not hide anything at all and told Lin Xiu everything he knew.

He belongs to a direct descendant of the Bai family, otherwise there would not be so many warriors to protect him.

“I heard… something happened in Wildfire City, so I came to take a look according to the words of the elders in the clan…”

At this time, Bai Zhanfei said with a trembling body.

At this time, he already understood that Lin Xiu would not care about his life or death.

Not to mention whether he is the so-called Bai family.

“Huh? Your Bai family still have power in Wildfire City?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows at this time, then said lightly.

According to the information Lin Xiu knew, the Bai family was active in cities in the other hemisphere.

It was quite far from this Wildfire City.

And between the two hemispheres, it seems that there is no way to establish a space transmission device because of a special force.

“Yes…”

“Zhao… The Zhao family is a chess piece we placed in Wildfire City…”

At this moment, his voice trembled.

Wildfire City, after all, was between the north and the south and it was made up of various intelligence organizations.

It collects information on the entire planet Namir and even other planets.

But the Zhao family suddenly lost contact and the news from Wildfire City seemed to be blocked.

“I see.”

“Where are you guys from?”

Lin Xiu continued to speak.

“Bai Di City, we came from Bai Di City.”

Bai Zhanfei didn’t dare keep anything from Lin Xiu at this time and quickly told Lin Xiu everything he knew.

After continuing to interrogate Bai Zhanfei, Lin Xiu also had a general understanding of the Bai family.

There were many warriors at the Sage warrior level of the Bai family, more than a hundred.

Especially in recent years, their Bai family had expanded to other planets and it seems that they have gained extremely strong power there, which has prompted their Bai family to have more Sage warrior-level warriors.

In the entire planet Namir, the Bai family alone already has most of the Sage warrior-level warriors.

As the most powerful force, they were indeed worthy of this.

However, what Lin Xiu has to do now was to destroy this force.

It was not so easy to eradicate the Bai family, it can only be done slowly.

And what Bai Zhanfei told Lin Xiu still shocked Lin Xiu.

There were more than 100 Sage warriors, how can there be so many Sage warriors?

When dealing with the Five Elements Sage Warriors just now, Lin Xiu spent a lot of energy and even used ‘Fury’.

If the Bai family had sent so many Sage warriors, he probably wouldn’t be able to deal with it alone.

“Now… now can I go…”

Bai Zhanfei said with a trembling figure.

Now he still has a tingling sensation in his hands.

The intense pain made him go crazy.

He is Bai Zhanfei, a member of the Bai family, when has he been hurt like this?

“Go? Where are you going?”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

“you!”

Bai Zhanfei opened his eyes wide and in the next moment, he saw the matrix that framed him expand. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Boom—

The entire matrix exploded in an instant.

Bai Zhanfei, who was in the matrix, was directly bombed to the bone.

In the same way, the three Sage warriors on the other side, who were framed in it, were also directly bombed to pieces.

“Huh? Not dead yet?”

However, when Lin Xiu returned, he found that the three Sage warriors, although their bodies were a little bloody, were not completely dead.

“Damn… boy…”

“You want to fight against our Bai family, you are deadmeat…”

The few warriors looked at Lin Xiu who came back again, stared at Lin Xiu with stubborn eyes and said with difficulty.

After all, they are Sage warrior-level warriors. Although Lin Xiu’s matrix limits the use of their source strength, it is not so easy to kill them directly.

But no matter how they threatened, Lin Xiu didn’t have the slightest hint of fear in his eyes.

“Bai family, I will go over and get rid of it myself.”

Following Lin Xiu’s indifferent voice, in the next moment, Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear waved and three flames charged towards the bodies of the three warriors!
