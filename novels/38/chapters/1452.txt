1453 Back to the Dark Planet

“Flame of Chaos… This guy absorbed Flame of Chaos…”

The surrounding God warriors, when they saw this scene, their eyes were filled with shock.

Terrifying .

This is Flame of Chaos!

At this time, as Lin Xiu walked back, the surrounding warriors quickly stepped out of the way.

Lin Xiu’s body still had a faint golden light.

It’s like a breathing light, flashing on and off.

Lin Xiu clenched his hands tightly.

It is obvious that it is full of extremely strong power.

The energy of this Flame of Chaos was really too powerful!

Lin Xiu’s heart was also full of excitement.

After walking not far, Lin Xiu suddenly had a thought, and the Spatial Magic Cube suddenly appeared beside him.

As Lin Xiu’s source strength surged, soon, the Spatial Magic Cube began to rotate rapidly.

The next moment, a dazzling white light appeared.

Walking into that light is equivalent to walking into a space crack.

Lin Xiu’s figure was teleported to the dark planet again.

Boom, boom, boom——

At this time, the entire Tianbei City seemed to be under bombardment.

Immediately, there was a loud sound.

The surrounding ground was constantly shaking.

Lin Xiu frowned when he saw this scene.

Looking up at the sky in front of him, he could see many warriors bombarding the dark planet below.

“Well, the seal has been lifted!?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

These God warriors should have come from the God warrior Realm!

Many warriors without dark power wear special protective clothing to resist the influence of dark power on the dark planet.

“Damn guy…”

At this moment, Luo Huatian’s body kept moving.

directly dodged to the other side.

Boom——

At this time, following a huge explosion around, a huge rock flew directly over.

It instantly fell on Luo Huatian’s body.

directly crushed his body.

“Scum.”

With a wave of the long sword in the hands of a God warrior, a terrifying sword energy directly charged towards Luo Huatian!

boom–

But at this moment, a figure instantly blocked the front.

The terrifying sword energy hit his body, but it didn’t cause any damage!

Seeing this scene, the god warrior was taken aback.

“Who are you!?”

Taking a closer look, he saw the figure of a man holding a spear.

Lin Xiu!

Boom——

At this moment, Luo Huatian directly pushed away the rock that was pressing on his body.

Looking up, he suddenly saw Lin Xiu’s figure.

“Lin Xiu, you’re back?!”

At this moment, Luo Huatian looked at Lin Xiu with surprise.

“Um.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

Not only did he come back, but he also successfully absorbed the Flame of Chaos!

“Courting death!”

The God warrior just now had a slight change in his expression at this time, holding the long sword in his hand, he stabbed directly at Lin Xiu!

Dang–

But at this moment, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand moved, directly blocking his attack.

And that powerful force even sent his long sword flying!

How can this be!

His eyes were full of shock.

Before he could make a move, the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand stabbed directly at the next moment!

boom–

He was a God warrior, and he couldn’t react at all. Lin Xiu’s spear directly pierced his head!

“When did these people come here?”

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Huatian.

Luo Huatian was still in shock, but when he heard Lin Xiu’s words, he immediately reacted.

“These damned guys came here yesterday.”

Luo Huatian gritted his teeth.

On this day, they directly massacred all warriors in Tianbei City.

Under the attack of these God warriors, there was no way to resist at all.

“Where’s Luo Yue?!”

Lin Xiu continued to speak out.

“It’s still at the source of the Black River.”

“Take me there!”

“Yes!”

Luo Huatian and Lin Xiu flew into the sky.

At this moment, a large number of warriors flew towards Lin Xiu!

They waved the weapons in their hands, and all of them rushed towards Lin Xiu with terrifying martial arts power!

Lin Xiu looked at this scene without any panic.

At this moment, the Dark Edge spear in his hand burst into a dazzling golden light.

Dark Edge swung his spear. Suddenly, a golden flaming bird bloomed!

This gold is different from ordinary gold, and looks even more strange.

As the flaming bird rushed out, the surrounding space became distorted at this moment.

What’s this!?

When the people around saw this scene, their eyes were filled with shock.

But at this moment, they could no longer dodge!

Boom——

With a loud sound, these God warriors were hit by the flaming bird, and their bodies became bones at a speed visible to the naked eye, and then shattered into dregs.

Even unfolding the ‘Sphere’ is useless!

And at this time, the flaming bird was flying crazily, passing over the bodies of those warriors, burning their bodies to ashes.

Luo Huatian saw this scene from the corner of his eye, and his eyes were full of shock.

This is too scary.

So many God warriors died immediately!?

“You have completely absorbed the Flame of Chaos!?”

At this moment, he seemed to have thought of something, and said subconsciously.

“Um.”

“Let’s go and find Luo Yue first.”

Lin Xiu responded slightly.

Then flew over in the direction led by Luo Huatian.

Soon, with Luo Huatian leading the way, Lin Xiu came to the source of the Black River.

“Luo Yue is still down there, and I don’t know what’s going on now.”

Luo Huatian looked at the Black River and said worriedly.

“How long have I been away?”

Lin Xiu also spoke at this time.

“A week.”

“A week?”

Hearing Luo Huatian’s words, Lin Xiu also had a look of surprise in his eyes.

Unexpectedly, it has already been a week!

When he was there, he felt that only a few hours had passed.

“She is also in the next week?”

“Um.”

Luo Huatian nodded slightly.

It’s been a week, and it’s already the next week.

Haven’t you absorbed the source strength of the Black River?

Lin Xiu sat here cross-legged, staring fixedly at Black River below.

“People are coming!”

At this moment, Luo Huatian’s voice came over.

“Zhu Long.”

Lin Xiu ignored the God warriors flying over from the sky, but looked at his Dark Edge spear and said.
