Chapter 829: A Storm Hits

“Master, do you think you can find it this time?”

After watching everyone board the boat, a man appeared beside Old Man An

“I do not know either.”

At this time, Old Man An shook his head helplessly.

Looking into the distance, he said as if talking to himself, “I hope, I can find it this time.”

“If you can’t find it again, there’s really not much time left.”

At this time, there was a look of loneliness in his eyes, which was obviously different from the confident look just now.

At the same time, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue stood on the deck.

The cruise ship started soon and the oncoming sea breeze blew against Luo Yue and Lin Xiu’s hair.

“so beautiful.”

/

Luo Yue looked to this distance and couldn’t help but sigh.

The sky in the distance looks like a perilous peak with layers of mountains.

Above the Black River, there are a large number of bird evolved beasts.

These evolved beasts had snow-white feathers and were flying in a straight line.

“Although the scenery is beautiful, there are many dangers lurking in the sea.”

Chen Dong came over at this time and spoke to the many warriors standing on the deck.

“Under the water in the depths, there are king-level evolved beasts, so you should be careful.”

“Just a king-level evolved beasts eh.”

At this time, some warriors of the King warrior level couldn’t help but sneer.

The evolved beasts of the king level seem to be nothing to the warriors of the King warrior level like them.

Looking at the proud looks in these people’s eyes, Chen Dong couldn’t help shaking his head helplessly.

The king-level evolved beasts in the sea are different from the evolved beasts on land.

They have an absolute advantage in the water and their power is even stronger.

And if those king-level evolved beasts attack the cruise ship, it will be even more dangerous.

In the deep sea, no matter how powerful a warrior is, it is difficult to exert his full strength.

“It is estimated that it will take a day to reach the destination. Let me allocate a room to everyone first.”

Chen Dong looked at the time on his watch and said to the crowd.

“Sure, I’m a little tired from gathering here early in the morning and fighting.”

A woman yawned and said.

“Let’s take a break too, shall we?”

Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue.

Luo Yue just woke up yesterday and she came here with him early this morning.

Looking at her expression now, she seems to be a little tired.

“En.”

Luo Yue thought about it for a while, then nodded.

With Chen Dong leading the way, everyone came to the ship’s residence.

There are a lot of rooms here, as if you are in a luxury hotel.

“There are many rooms, you can choose one and I will give you the keys.”

Chen Dong said while leading the crowd over.

He was wearing a black uniform and stood up straight. His temperament was very similar to that of a soldier.

As everyone was choosing their own room, Lin Xiu whispered to Luo Yue, “Would you like to share a room with me?”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue’s face turned a little red, then she raised her foot and stepped on Lin Xiu’s.

“Ah, ah, ah, it hurts...”

Lin Xiu deliberately pretended to be in pain and said aloud.

Looking at Lin Xiu’s appearance, Luo Yue couldn’t help but chuckle.

This smile made Lin Xiu stunned for a while.

“What are you looking at.”

Luo Yue rolled her eyes at Lin Xiu.

“At you.”

Lin Xiu said very directly.

Luo Yue’s expressions were now much more obvious making Lin Xiu find her even more lovely.

But this only happened in front of Lin Xiu.

In the eyes of others, she still has that cold look.

In the end, Lin Xiu did share a room with Luo Yue, but the room had two beds.

It made Lin Xiu, who wanted to do bad things, depressed.

“Rest a little first.”

Lin Xiu helped Luo Yue cover the quilt, then smiled at her and said.

“I’m not a child.” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu helplessly and said.

However, Lin Xiu’s actions made Luo Yue feel a little warmer.

During the period of time when she was asleep, did he take care of her so meticulously?

Thinking of this, she was immediately moved.

“Oh right.”

Luo Yue seemed to have thought of something at this time, then she covered half of her cheek with the quilt, as if she was a little shy.

“what?”

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment, then subconsciously said.

“Usually...”

“How do I take a shower...”

As soon as Luo Yue said the words, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and there was a drop of sweat on his forehead.

“Cough...this...”

“I’m going to bed.”

At this time, Luo Yue covered her head with a quilt.

Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief at this time, then he couldn’t help laughing.

She also lay on the other bed and rested. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

There was still a long way.

In the past six months, Lin Xiu has been cultivating day and night.

He also wanted to have a good day off today, so he treated it as a vacation.

After some time, Lin Xiu, who was still sleeping, suddenly heard a ‘boom boom’ sound.

What happened!?

Lin Xiu turned over and got up, only to realize that it was night time.

When he turned on the lights, he found that there was already a violent storm outside.

“What’s happening?” And Luo Yue also woke up at this time.

“Outside, there seems to be a situation.” Lin Xiu frowned at this time, then said.

boom boom boom —

And at this time, the entire hull of the ship was constantly shaking.

Lin Xiu couldn’t even stand still.

It seemed that the entire hull was attacked by something.

What exactly is going on!?

“I’ll go out to take a look, you can rest first.”

Lin Xiu spoke to Luo Yue.

“I’ll go too.”

But at this time, Luo Yue had already stood up.

“Be careful”.

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then said.

bang bang bang-

At this moment, a loud noise suddenly rang out.

It seems that there are many crew members on board, holding some heavy laser guns and attacking things in the sea.

The rest of the warriors also ran to the deck now.

Their bodies all unfolded ‘Sphere’.

With the existence of ‘Sphere’, those violent storms have no way to get their bodies wet.

“Captain Chen, what’s wrong?”

Lin Xiu saw that Chen Dong was here too and asked.

“There is something underwater.”

Chen Dong’s face also became ugly.

There is something!?

“Damn!”

At this moment, a warrior seemed to see something and his face was full of shock.

A huge tentacle stretched out from the water and hit the deck heavily!

A staff member with a heavy laser gun was hit and flew out!
