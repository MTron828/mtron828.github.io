Chapter 155: Use points!?

Lin Xiu woke up refreshed the next day.

When he looked carefully, half of the odd crystal in his hand was transparent. He had absorbed half of the energy inside the rank 6 odd crystal in a night!

His body was in pain. Lin Xiu looked carefully and saw that his clothes were covered in blood as well as black scabs. He shook and dropped them to the ground.

He had absorbed too much energy the night before that led to slight rejection from his body, resulting in this outcome.

He took a bath and changed to a new set of uniform. It was about five thirty in the morning.

As the class monitor, he had to arrive at the classroom earlier than the designated time of six.

“Rollie! You ate my crystals again!” Right at this time, he caught Rollie lying on the table as though it was asleep with its four limbs hugging on a half eaten rank 3 odd crystal.

It immediately stood up as it heard his voice.

It held onto its head as though it was slightly afraid of Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was amused when he saw its reaction.

“Forget it, you should stay here.” Lin Xiu looked at it helplessly before walking out.

He noticed a plate of food on the table in the living room.

“Luo Yue!” Lin Xiu called out but did not hear any response.

Noticing some rubbish in the trash bin at the corner, Lin Xiu reckoned she must have eaten and left.

Is that for me?

At this thought, Lin Xiu could not help but be slightly stunned.

This ice mountain isn’t as icy as she used to be…

When Lin Xiu arrived at the classroom, he discovered many people inside.

“Lin Xiu, did you sleep well last night?” After knowing that Lin Xiu was also a freshman in Sacred Region Academy, he no longer called him ‘senior’ anymore.

And after hanging out for a period of time, he realized that Lin Xiu was not as unapproachable as he seemed.

“Scram!” Upon hearing Zhang Yin and Jiang Li’s provocative question and the look on their faces, he knew that they were hinting at something dirty and immediately cursed them while chuckling.

Lei Lei looked at Zhang Yin and pinched him at his waist, causing Zhang Yin to grimace in pain.

“En? Is everyone here?” At this time, Nan Zhengjun walked in.

“The class for today is relatively simple, we will be introducing the origins of Sacred Region Academy as well as a few important aspects inside the academy.” Nan Zhengjun said while pressing on a few buttons on the table.

A large 3d image appeared.

“Sacred Region Academy was established by 5 rank 9 warriors.”

5 rank 9?

Everyone was stunned when they heard Nan Zhengjun’s introduction.

A single rank 9 warrior was shocking enough, who would have thought that Sacred Region Academy was established by 5 of them!

The 3D projection revealed the history of Sacred Region Academy alongside Nan Zhengjun’s introduction.

They went through the history for the entire afternoon.

The floor above them was a large training room that had many strange machines with a few large mechas in the center.

“Sacred Region Academy practises freedom, aside from today’s requirement of arriving here at 6, feel free to come anytime you want from tomorrow on.” Nan Zhengjun informed the class.

Everyone rejoiced when they heard his words. Having to attend class daily back in senior high had left many of them stifled and trapped.

“But let me warn everyone here, there is a small test here on a monthly basis, a big test every half a year. As long as anyone fails any of the tests, don’t blame me for punishing you.” Nan Zhengjun saw their happy faces and poured cold water on them.

“There… are still tests…” Jiang Li’s mouth was wide opened as he became somewhat depressed.

“There are other training rooms, gravity rooms, stamina training rooms etc, for all of you to use inside Sacred Region Academy, feel free to use them.”

“For students interested in research, the research floor is over there and you can take a look.”

Many students were eager to try out the training rooms after being introduced to them.

“Lin Xiu, this key is yours.” Nan Zhengjun handed a card over to Lin Xiu.

“Close the doors to this place before 12 midnight everynight and open it at 6 in the morning.”

“Of course, you can train throughout the night if you are in here.”

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded.

The others became envious when they saw the card in his hand. He would be able to enter the training room as and when he liked with that card! Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Right, give me your information card, I’ll give you another 500 points.” Nan Zhengjun said.

500 points!

Some people were red in the eyes, they only had 500 points a month and had consumed many of it by renting rooms.

Lin Xiu handed him his card. As Nan Zhengjun was about to key points in, his eyes opened wide: “Why do you have so many points?!”

“How many does he have…” Zhang Yin became curious and walked over. He immediately saw a string of numbers.

“30 over thousand points?!”

“WHAT?!”

Everyone exclaimed out loud.

30 thousand, how?

“Teacher! He cheated! How can he have so many points!” Right then, the fool that objected to Lin Xiu being the class monitor roared as he pointed at Lin Xiu.

“That’s right! That’s unfair!”

“He must have cheated someway or another!”

The other students were incited and became furious.

“Shut it!” Hearing their complaints, Nan Zhengjun bellowed out loud.

Everyone jolted and closed their mouths.

“Cheating is impossible here, the academy has a complete system. No one can go through unorthodox methods to gain points.”

“You can only do so by completing missions or selling things.” Nan Zhengjun swept his gaze across the crowd.

“I sold a few things at the exchange center.” Lin Xiu chuckled and explained.

Nan Zhengjun nodded. He transferred 500 points to Lin Xiu and returned the card.

“Why am I unaware of an exchange center to sell things…” The fool that doubted Lin Xiu muttered to himself unhappily.

“That’s because you’re dumb.” Lin Xiu glanced at him and replied indifferently.

“You…”

“Alright, I’m going for a meeting now. There will be a freshmen assembly in a week. Train yourselves well and I will pick 5 outstanding warriors from you guys to compete with the other classes for the top warriors of the freshmen assembly.” Nan Zhengjun noticed the time and notified the class.
