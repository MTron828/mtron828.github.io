Chapter 512: Lin Xiu’s Parents

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

At this time, everyone in the Chen family dared not move. The assassin who had been coerced by Lin Xiu to lead the way had his legs trembling at this time.

Rank 6 warrior, he actually wanted to assassinate a rank 6 warrior!

Now he knew why, why Lin Xiu killed his companion so easily just now.

“What the hell do you want!” Although the spear was pointed at Chen Jinqian’s father, he still gritted his teeth and said.

He looked very calm on the surface, but there was already a lot of cold sweat on his forehead.

His eyes clearly saw that the spear was still stained with blood. It was obvious that Lin Xiu had just killed someone with it.

“I don’t want anything other than his life.” Lin Xiu looked at Chen Jinqian who was on the hospital bed and said aloud.

“Don’t...don’t kill me…” Chen Jinqian’s eyes were filled with horror.

He was usually the one who bullied others. When was he actually bullied so badly?

This time, he was really scared.

At this time, his body shivered and the entire bed sheet was soaked because he was so frightened that he peed.

“You broke my Uncle Ye’s limbs, I’m just returning the favor and did not take your life. However, you actually dared to send a killer to deal with me.” Lin Xiu’s eyes were filled with murderous intent as he spoke.

He wasn’t himself anymore.

“Go to hell!” Lin Xiu shouted sharply. He turned the Dark Edge spear away from Chen Jinqian’s father at this moment and was about to stab Chen Jinqian in the head!

Chen Jinqian saw this scene, his face turned white and he fainted.

“Wait!” But at this moment, a man blocked and shouted at Lin Xiu.

“Do you want to die too?” Lin Xiu said aloud as he looked at the man in his eyes.

He wanted to take Chen Jinqian’s life, but he didn’t want to slaughter the entire Chen family.

If this happens, he was afraid that he can’t control himself and really become a murderous demon.

“I was the one who sent these killers.” The man said aloud at this time.

“Chen Liang!” Chen Jinqian’s father heard his words at this time and his eyes suddenly changed.

This is his brother and he came forward to say this just to take the blame.

“Oh? Then I will kill you as well.” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said coldly.

However, Chen Liang looked at Lin Xiu for a while, then seemed to think of something, his face suddenly changed.

“Are you from Xing Yao City?” Chen Liang said suddenly.

Lin Xiu frowned when he heard his words, and didn’t understand why he said that.

Looking at Lin Xiu’s expression, he could be sure that Lin Xiu must belong to Xing yao City.

And at this time, he felt that Lin Xiu’s face seemed very similar to the man back then. Could it be that...

It wouldn’t be so coincidental, right!?

Thinking of this, he was startled.

But now he couldn’t care so much and if his guess was right, they had a chance to survive!

“You are Lin Yixiao’s son!?” Chen Liang said suddenly.

“How do you know?” Lin Xiu was taken aback, then his face changed drastically.

After traveling through this world, he completely merged with the memory of the original ‘Lin Xiu’.

The name of his father in this world is Lin Yixiao.

But when he was young, his parents died in a car accident.

“I was right.” Chen Liang heaved a sigh of relief at this time. He didn’t expect that by such a coincidence, he actually met the man’s son.

That incident was still very clear in his memory, he still remembered what happened back then.

The man’s face was very similar to Lin Xiu’s.

“Your father did not die in a car accident.” Chen Liang continued to say to Lin Xiu.

He didn’t die in a car accident?!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank abruptly and he was shocked at this time.

It was said that when his parents had a car accident, Lin Xiu was still in elementary school and his parents’ bodies were cremated even before he had a chance to see them.

The other party paid a large sum of compensation and relying on some savings left at home, Lin Xiu could successfully finish high school.

These things were a big blow to Lin Xiu back then.

He came into this world at this time, fused with the memory of ‘Lin Xiu’ and now Lin Xiu has already regarded his late parents as his real parents.

Hearing Chen Liang’s words at this time, how could he not be shocked.

“Tell me, what do you know? Or I will kill you.” Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear pointed at Chen Liang and said. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“You let us go, I can tell you everything I know.” Chen Liang stood upright and said to Lin Xiu at this time.

He could see now that Lin Xiu cared about this matter very much.

“You let us go.” Chen Liang repeated.

“You are not qualified to negotiate terms with me.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Kill me then.” Chen Liang looked like he was willing to give up.

Lin Xiu frowned slightly, then looked at Chen Jinqian as his spear thrust directly into his body!

The pupils in Chen Liang’s eyes shrank when he saw this scene. He didn’t expect Lin Xiu to actually do it?

“Ah!!!”

Chen Jinqian, who had passed out, let out a cry at this time. When he woke up again, he opened his eyes wide and saw that his hands and feet were suddenly pierced and the connected bones were shattered again.

After Chen Jinqian opened his eyes wide, he fell into a coma again because of the intense pain.

“Grievances settled, find trouble with me again and I will slaughter your whole family.” Lin Xiu glanced at the Chen family present and said faintly.

The killing intent in the boy’s eyes made the Chen family dare not speak at all and they were trembling.

Chen Jinqian’s father saw this scene and although he was heartbroken for his son, he was relieved that Lin Xiu didn’t kill him.

Now he didn’t dare to say anything, because he was afraid that if he annoyed Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu would kill Chen Jinqian directly.

“You, come over, tell me what you know.” Lin Xiu looked at Chen Liang standing in front of him and said.

“Okay.” Since Chen Liang didn’t want Chen Jinqian’s life, Chen Liang also heaved a sigh of relief at this time and followed Lin Xiu out.

The killer who was threatened by Lin Xiu, watched Lin Xiu and Chen Liang leave at this time and wanted to leave quietly.

“Where are you going?” Although Chen Jinqian’s father was afraid of Lin Xiu, he had no fear of this killer.

The killer heard Chen Jinqian’s words and wanted to leave, but the next moment, he felt a pain in his head and plunged into darkness.

“Now, tell me what you know.” Lin Xiu and Chen Liang walked to the rooftop of the hospital.

What exactly happened that year?
