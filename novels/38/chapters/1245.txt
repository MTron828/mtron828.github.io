1246 The Peculiar Black Sphere

“Proceed with authentication?”

Soon, there was another row of words that appeared on the energy barrier.

“If i’m correct, this energy barrier would be formed from the core energy of a god-level odd crystal.”

“If we try to break it forcefully, it may not be that easy…”

!!

Lei Chong gently touched the energy barrier as he commented about it.

Just as he was speaking, Lin Xiu then trusted the long spear forward to the energy barrier!

[Torrential Storm of Rose Flower]!!!

At that moment, there were multiple spears that appeared.

All of them were aimed at the same spot!

Boom boom boom – –

With the loud explosions, the entire energy barrier started shaking.

Lin Xiu was in the centre of it and there was a huge crack that appeared instantly.

At the same time, the tip of the long spear then pierced through the barrier!

Bakk – –

The sound that came from it was similar to glass cracking. The entire energy barrier soon exploded!

Lei Chong stared at it with his wide eyes and they were filled with disbelief.

His mouth was slightly opened and he was in shock.

He was just about to say that he could help with getting rid of the energy barrier but he didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be able to destroy it so quickly with his long spear.

“Done.”

As the energy barrier was destroyed, Lin Xiu walked across it without any hesitation.

Baili Haoling followed right behind Lin Xiu.

“Wait for me!!”

Lei Chong screamed as he ran after them.

Lin Xiu walked into the space with the long spear in his arm and suddenly, his eyes brightened up with excitement.

“Odd crystals!!”

These were actual odd crystals!!! There were so many of them that they formed a huge mountain!!

Why was it that none of them saw these odd crystals earlier?

Could it be because of the energy barrier?

It may be possible…

When he took a closer look, most of them were beast saint odd crystals.

There were also a few god-level odd crystals!

It looks like Sha Qiong has accumulated a large number of crystals and all of them are kept here.

“So many odd crystals…”

Lei Chong rushed forward as well after hearing what Lin Xiu said, Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

As he stared at the odd crystals that were piled up into mountains, his eyes widened in shock.

Not only was there a large number of it, most of them were high-level odd crystals.

The lowest amongst them was a beast saint odd crystal!

There were at least hundreds of beast god odd crystals!

“Would these odd crystals be enough for you to build a strong energy barrier?”

Lin Xiu looked at Lei Chong before asking him.

“Of course! These would be more than enough!!!”

Lei Chong was now filled with excitement.

There were so many of them here and at least a hundred of them were god-level odd crystal!!!

By just standing inside the room, Lei Chong could feel how strong these energies were.

“All of these would be enough to form an extremely powerful energy barrier!”

“That’s great.”

Lin Xiu gently nodded his head.

“Haoling, do you need some odd crystals?”

After speaking with Lei Chong, Lin Xiu turned towards Baili Haoling.

“No, I don’t.”

Baili Haoling shook her head.

These beast god odd crystals wouldn’t bring much help and they would only provide very little help with her cultivation.

These odd crystals didn’t mean anything for her.

“I’ll take all of them with me then.”

...

With that said, Lin Xiu waved his right arm.

Suddenly, the mountains of odd crystals disappeared in an instant!

“The odd crystals! Where did the odd crystals go?!”

Lei Chong was still staring at the mountains of odd crystals around him but suddenly, all of them went missing!

He rubbed his eyes and he still couldn’t believe what had just happened!

“City lord, the odd crystals…”

“I took them away.”

Lin Xiu patted his shoulder and walked out of the room.

Baili Haoling stared at Lei Chong as if he was an idiot and left with Lin Xiu.

She knew that Lin Xiu was able to retrieve and keep the long spear as he pleased and could already guess that Lin Xiu must have had a special space to keep them.

“Where did it go…?”

...

Lei Chong looked at Lin Xiu and figured that there was nothing on him that would allow him to keep all these odd crystals. Lei Chong was starting to get confused.

Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling continued exploring the place and noticed that there were other things inside.

Rare traditional medicine as long as sharp weapons made out of unique materials were seen all over the place.

Sha Qiong has had so many treasures kept here.

“Hmmm? What’s this?”

As they walked to the end of the room, Lin Xiu noticed a huge oval-shaped crystal ball.

In the centre of it, there was a sphere.

The sphere was black in colour.

It looked like…..a dark element energy stone!

“Kooooo Koooo!!!”

Rollie, who would usually be quiet while it sat on Lin Xiu’s shoulder, suddenly looked excited and was jumping on his shoulder.

“Rollie, what’s wrong?”

This was the first time that Lin Xiu had seen Rollie being so excited and he was curious.

“Koooooo Kooooo!!!”

Rollie continued making the same sound and was bouncing around like a ball. It looked incredibly excited.

Lin Xiu rolled his eyes. After hesitating for a moment, he immediately threw a punch onto the energy ball.

Boom – –

With a loud explosion, there was a dent formed on the huge sphere.

Then, Lin Xiu took out the pitch black thing that looked like a ball inside it.

It looked creepy.

Lin Xiu assumed that it might be a dark element energy stone.

However, when he placed his hands on it, it was heavy.

This thing must have weighed at least a few thousand kilograms!

What on earth is this?!

Lin Xiu was even more surprised.

“You can’t eat this!”

Rollie’s mouth was already opened as its body grew in size. Rollie was ready to engulf the entire thing.

Lin Xiu gently stroked his head and stopped Rollie.

Rollie stopped as well and started rubbing himself against Lin Xiu’s neck.

It was trying to act coquettish.

“Haoling, do you know what this is?”

Lin Xiu didn’t have the time to deal with Rollie and asked Baili Haoling instead.

Lin Xiu could clearly feel that there was an intense amount of energy coming from the sphere.

Along with how Rollie was desperate to engulf this thing, it was obvious that this sphere was something special.

As for what it was, Lin Xiu still had no idea.

The Analytic Eye couldn’t tell him anything.

“I don’t know either…”

Baili Haoling looked at it for a minute but shook her head as well.

This sphere that was pitch black looked like a huge metal ball.

However, it gave off a weird and peculiar aura and it seemed to be covered with powerful energy.

“Forget it then. I’ll bring it back first.”

Since Sha Qiong left this here, it must be something special.
