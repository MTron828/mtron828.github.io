Chapter 1095: Chen Family

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu didn’t know what this Elder Yu wanted the horn of the frost dragon and its odd crystal for.

But he already got what he wanted. At this time, Lin Xiu stepped out of the place.

“wait.”

At this moment, Elder Yu said suddenly.

“Anything else?”

!!

Lin Xiu stopped, raised his brows and said lightly.

“Which force are you from?”

Elder Yu said curiously.

“I don’t belong anywhere.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Elder Yu’s eyes were full of disbelief.

He didn’t believe that a warrior of Lin Xiu’s level would not have a big power behind him.

After all, at such a young age, he possesses such a strong strength and it is impossible to have such a strength at such a young age without spending a lot of resources to help him cultivate.

“Boy, let me remind you, this skill card can be cultivated without getting it.”

Elder Yu said with a strange smile at this time.

“I know that.”

Lin Xiu said lightly and walked out of the door directly.

“Mysterious boy.”

Elder Yu shook his head secretly at this time.

After going out, Lin Xiu rushed to the mountain where Ye Kai was.

Ye Kai was still cultivating, but at this moment he seemed to sense something, he opened his eyes and clenched the sword in his hand.

“it’s me.”

At this moment, a familiar voice came over.

Hearing this familiar voice, Ye Kai was startled, then he showed a look of surprise.

“master!”

He turned around and looked behind him and he could clearly see Lin Xiu’s figure.

“How is your practice?”

Lin Xiu smiled lightly.

Under the inspection of the Analytic eye, Ye Kai has reached the peak of Respected warrior.

To break through to become a Sage warrior, it was only a matter of time.

“I have already reached the peak of Respected warrior and should be able to reach the level of Sage warrior soon.”

Ye Kai said a little excitedly.

“Yes, Not Bad.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

“Right, master, you…”

When Ye Kai was about to say something, Lin Xiu’s thoughts triggered and a black box appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

“I already got it.”

At this time, Lin Xiu opened the black box and a dazzling light burst out in an instant.

Looking at this ray of light, Ye Kai narrowed his eyes originally.

Taking a closer look, there is a skill card in this black box.

That dazzling light is emitted from the skill card in this box.

“This is [Silence]!?”

Ye Kai suppressed his excitement and said.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded.

The Ye Family’s three holy-level skills, plus this ‘Silence’, he has already obtained two of them.

He wasn’t sure if he would get the last one, ‘Time Control’,

After all, the skill of ‘Time Control’ is very powerful.

“I’ll cultivate first, Uncle Ye, help me guard the place.”

Lin Xiu sat cross-legged on the top of the mountain, then said lightly.

“Sure.”

Ye Kai nodded and said.

When absorbing the information in the skill Card, if an outsider disturbs and destroys it, it will cause irreversible damage.

At this time, Lin Xiu, who was sitting cross-legged, directly placed the ‘Silence’ skill Card on his forehead.

Thinking of Elder Yu’s words today, a sneer appeared on the corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth.

Even if this ‘Silence’ skill card falls into the hands of these warriors, they will not be able to cultivate at all.

Because there are special taboos on this skills card, those who are not a descendant of the Ye family, there is no way for them to cultivate.

Although Lin Xiu wasn’t either, the white light group in his heart exuded special energy at this time.

It rushed towards his forehead.

Then, he had some kind of communication with this skill card.

Soon, the ‘Silence’ skill Card radiated even more intense light.

Those rays of light covered the entire mountain top in an instant.

Soon, all the skill information contained in this skill card was passed into Lin Xiu’s mind.

Lin Xiu’s brows furrowed at this time.

The power information of this skill card is really too great, it seems that all of it poured into Lin Xiu’s head at this moment.

It seemed like it was going to burst Lin Xiu’s head.

Time passed quickly. About an hour later, the bright light on the skill card began to gradually weaken, then disappeared completely.

“Hu…”

And at this time, Lin Xiu also exhaled a turbid breath.

The skill information in this skill card is really too much.

It took a full hour to absorb all the information contained in the skill Card.

“Master, are you done?”

At this time, Uncle Ye watched Lin Xiu slowly stand up and suddenly exclaimed in surprise.

“en, yes.”

Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

At this time, he looked up at the sky, the sun was already setting.

“Ye Kai, take me to the Chen family.”

Time flies and now it’s night.

A crescent moon hangs in the sky.

The Chen family is at the very edge of Baidi City.

Although this is the edge of Baidi City, the scale of the entire Chen family is also very huge.

Moreover, there are several warriors of the Respected warrior level at the gate, who are guarding the gate.

“Who are you?”

The few Respected warriors guarding at the door looked at the two figures walking from the front, their brows suddenly wrinkled and they said to the two with the weapons in their hands.

The people who came were Lin Xiu and Ye Kai. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Chen’s family, is that right here?”

Lin Xiu seemed to ignore these warriors directly, looked at the huge plaque above the gate and said aloud as if talking to himself.

“Yes.”

Ye Kai nodded and said.

At this time, his hands were clenched into fists and when he thought of the scene where he was betrayed by the Chen family and taken away by the Bai family’s warriors, his eyes were full of anger.

“Well, let’s go in.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

In the next moment, he ignored these Respected warriors guarding here and walked forward.

“courting death!”

Seeing this scene, the expressions on the faces of those Respected warriors guarding the door suddenly changed.

Holding the weapons in their hands, they attacked Lin Xiu!

Boom—

Just when their weapons were about to attack Lin Xiu, an extremely terrifying power burst out from Lin Xiu’s body.

At this instant, those Respected warriors who came over flew out!

bang bang bang-

Their bodies fell directly to the ground not far away.

The huge impact made them unable to stand up at this moment.

They could only lie on the ground and wail.

At this moment, Lin Xiu saw a white light flickering in front of him.
