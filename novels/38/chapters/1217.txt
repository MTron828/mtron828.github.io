1218 Kill Without Hesitation!

As Lin Xiu glanced around and activated the Analytic eye, it was easy to know all the information about these people.

The strongest one was nothing but a god warrior.

To Lin Xiu, an ordinary God warrior was nothing at all.

Baili Haoling and Mr. Pang also came out at this time.

!!

“Manager Pang, I didn’t expect you to be here.”

When Liu Qinglan of Changqing City saw at Mr. Pang who came out, he immediately raised his brows.

“I have met Mr. Liu.”

At this time, Mr. Pang did not speak humbly.

“This is the new city lord of your Lingxian City?”

Mr. Liu pointed directly at Lin Xiu and said.

“Yes, this is the new city lord of Lingxian City, Mr. Lin Xiu.”

Mr. Pang said proudly.

The arrival of Lin Xiu has indeed changed Lingxian City a lot.

“Do you know who I am?”

At this time, Liu Qinglan looked at Lin Xiu.

Without waiting for Lin Xiu to speak, he continued to say, “Changqing City, it is the superior city of your Lingxian City.”

“You should greet me respectfully when you see me.”

Liu Qinglan stared at Lin Xiu.

“Changqing City?”

“never heard of that.”

Lin Xiu shook his head, looking indifferent.

“Tsk tsk, Liu Qinglan, it seems that this new city owner doesn’t intend to give you face.”

The deputy city lord of Shachang City, Sha Lin also stood up at this time and said with a big laugh.

“To shut up!”

When Liu Qinglan heard his words, her face suddenly became extremely ugly.

Lin Xiu was very disrespectful, and Liu Qinglan’s eyes were also filled with a faint killing intent.

“Newbie, I heard that you have obtained the inheritance of Bai Lingxian, and you have taken over the ore vein of Tianlan Pavilion before?”

At this time, Sha Lin ignored Liu Qinglan and looked at Lin Xiu with burning eyes.

The purpose of their visit this time was to get the inheritance of Bai Lingxian and the ore vein.

After all, according to the information they got, this vein is very rich.

“Oh, I see, you guys want to rob something away huh.”

Lin Xiu pretended to be suddenly enlightened.

“It’s not a robbery, it’s just that some things, put in your hands, are problems.” Sha Lin shook his head and said with a smile.

It seems to be very kind.

“In Bai Lingxian’s inheritance, there should be something about divine marks. I only need that part of the information.”

Liu Qinglan spoke at this time.

“I’m not very interested in that divine mark but I’m a bit lacking of energy stones in Shachang City.”

Shalin said.

Listening to their words, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

The two of them seem to be determined to rob him.

“Courting death!!!”

At this moment, a roar came from not far ahead.

It was the young man from the Haiwang City who had just been sent flying by Lin Xiu.

Not long after he got up, he rushed over here.

Taking a closer look, he was already holding two long swords as weapons, and he was about to attack Lin Xiu directly!

“Oh? With double swords?”

Baili Haoling looked at the young man in the Haiwang City who rushed over, and suddenly said to herself.

As a warrior who uses two swords, Baili Haoling’s eyes turned red at this moment when she saw the warrior who also used two swords.

She was a little excited.

“Haoling, kill him.”

Lin Xiu also clearly knew that Baili Haoling already had a strong desire to fight, and said directly at this time.

“hehe.”

The corners of Baili Haoling’s mouth twitched, and at the moment when the warriors from Haiwang City rushed over, Baili Haoling had already attacked the young warrior with a long swords in both hands!

“Go away!!!”

The warrior looked at Baili Haoling who rushed over and roared.

The source strength of the whole body burst out at this moment.

He has been stunned by anger now, and he wants to kill Lin Xiu wholeheartedly.

For the Baili Haoling who was standing in front of him, he also wanted to use the fastest speed to kill him directly.

However, with Baili Haoling’s red eyes, her strength can be raised to the level of a God warrior!

In addition, the double-sword flow she uses was also an ancestral double-sword flow, and the swordsmanship was very sharp.

The two fought, like two shadows, and the sound of weapons colliding was constantly heard.

Dang dang-

“what!!!”

But soon, along with the sputtering of blood, a wailing sound came out.

The man’s hands were directly cut off!

Two arms fell under Liu Qinglan’s feet.

When Liu Qinglan saw this scene, her complexion suddenly changed.

That young man is the youngest son of the Haiwang City’s city lord.

This time, he came here just for the experience. Nobody expected that the people of this Lingxian City would dare to chop off his arms directly!

Without showing any mercy.

“Young Lord!!!”

Looking at the man who fell on the ground, the people in Haiwang City were all agitated at this time. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Go away!!!”

But Baili Haoling didn’t give the man any chance to relax at this time, and rushed over with the two swords in his hand.

The warriors of the Haiwang City were about to use their weapons to block Baili Haoling’s offensive, but they were directly sent flying by Baili Haoling’s double swords.

“I’m from Haiwang City…”

The man’s arms were chopped off and his body fell to the ground. At this moment, when Baili Haoling knocked all his men into the air and was about to slash at him, he finally couldn’t control the fear in his heart.

He doesn’t want to die!

boom–

But Baili Haoling, whose eyes were red, didn’t pay any attention to his words at this time, and slashed him with a long knife, killing him directly.

“That’s all huh.”

Baili Haoling waved her two swords, and while splattering the blood on the two swords, she said lightly.

Sha Lin and Liu Qinglan’s expressions instantly froze.

The young city lord of Haiwang City, who came with them, actually died like this… dead! ?

“You dare to kill our young city lord!!!”

At this time, the warriors in the Haiwang city have all gone crazy.

The young city lord was killed, and they had no way to explain to the city lord of Haiwang City.

“Talk a lot of nonsense.”

Lin Xiu looked at the warriors who were about to attack Haiwang City, snorted coldly, waved his right hand, and bursts of lotus flames were instantly released.

Some of these lotus flames have ice-type energy, some have thunder-type energy, and others are pure flame energy.

But without exception, when these lotus fires hit the bodies of those warriors, they directly annihilated their entire bodies!

Instantly vanished.

You must know that this time there are more than 30 warriors who came from Haiwang City.

The thirty or so warriors all died in an instant, causing the bodies of the rest of the warriors to tremble.
