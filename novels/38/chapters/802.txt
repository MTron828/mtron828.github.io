Chapter 803: Killing the King Warrior!

The entire place was immediately covered by a purple electric current domain.

Plus, with Lin Xiu standing on the ground, all of the electric current was surrounding Lin Xiu’s body.

However, this time, Lin Xiu’s body reacted quickly and it was not affected by the current.

This is not because Lin Xiu has already moved up another level. It was also because Lin Xiu’s body had already been well trained for the past one week and was now more terrifying than before.

As for the lightning, it didn’t do anything to Lin Xiu.

He was moving his spear around frantically and there were a large number of flames headed towards Yan Yongxin.

Koong Loong– –

The flames of these flaming birds were now covered with hellfire.

Their strength was much more powerful than before.

Yan Yongxin couldn’t face it directly and he could only dodge them.

With the flaming birds headed towards the seats and the buildings around, everything that it touched immediately turned into ash.

” ‘Purple Dragon in the Air’!!”

Yan Yongxin clenched his jar and thrusted his arm into the air. There was a source mark that appeared on his forehead as well.

The power of the source mark?!

After seeing what happened, the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed.

Plus, the power of this source mark seemed to be different from the one before but the power of it was definitely much stronger than the other one.

Koong Loong – –

At that moment, there was a loud sound that rang around them and there was a scary electric current that was slowly building around Yan Yongxin.

Then, all of them joined together and formed a huge purple thunder dragon.

“Go!!!”

Yan Yongxin screamed and the huge Purple Thunder Dragon dashed towards Lin Xiu immediately!

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered and with the Dark Edge in his hand, he started releasing more flaming birds.

The flaming birds did not head directly towards Yan Yongxin. Instead, they were gathering together as well.

Soon, all of them fused together and formed a huge Flaming Phoenix!

The Flaming Phoenix that was dark blue in colour went towards the huge Purple Thunder Dragon.

It was the battle between the dragon and the phoenix!

“Be careful!!”

When they saw the terrifying scene happening before them, An Qi and the rest had a bad feeling about it and quickly released their ‘Yuan’.

Koong Loong – –

It was followed by a loud crash and the auction hall that was huge started shaking violently.

When the phoenix collided with the dragon, there was a huge explosion and there were cracks that appeared all over the walls around them.

There were cracks in the ceiling as well and there were huge blocks falling off the ceiling.

Within seconds, the entire auction hall collapsed!

“Damn it...”

Yan Yongxin quickly crawled out of the debris on the ground.

He had an awful expression on his face and he was looking like a mess.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be able to use hellfire.

This sort of flames were terrifying and he didn’t dare to approach it head on.

Did he die…..?

He was looking at the place that were now heaps of debris as he try to catch his breath.

However, with the ashes and smoke being blown away, he noticed that there was a human figure standing right in front of him.

When Yan Yongxin saw what happened, his pupil shrank.

A bright light shot across his eyes and he released his ‘Yuan’.

Boom boom boom – –

For Lin Xiu, there were a few cuts over his body due to the large impact from the collision of the warrior skills.

But, with his strong healing abilities, all of the wounds were closing up within seconds.

Lin Xiu was still holding onto his spear and was attacking Yan Yongxin continuously.

The tip of the smear was covered with a dark blue flame and it was aimed towards Yan Yongxin’ ‘Yuan’. His ‘Yuan’ started to feel unstable and there were dents across it.

“Damn it, you brat!”

Yan Yongxin clearly eflt what was happening and he felt even more cross.

This young man’s strength….how did he get so strong?!

His resistance towards lightning became stronger as well.

If he allowed Lin Xiu to continue the attack, it was most likely that his ‘Yuan’ would break!

Xiu – –

As he was moving backwards, he released the ‘Floating Technique’. He wanted to fly into the air so that he could continue using the scary thunder energy that was from his source mark.

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu snorted. He hasn’t learnt the ‘Floating Technique’ and it was impossible for him to stay floating in the air.

But, he had another solution.

With a shift in his thoughts, there was a black source mark that appeared on Lin Xiu’s forehead.

The energy from his source mark was instantly released!

As Lin Xiu activated the energy from his source mark, there was a semi transparent matrix that appeared underneath Lin Xiu’s feet.

Lin Xiu stepped onto the matrix and jumped into the air.

As he jumped into the air, he continued releasing more matrices and used them as a step, allowing him to leap into the air.

Yan Yongxin, who was already in the air, wanted to release the energy from his source mark but when he turned around, he noticed where Lin Xiu was as well.

How did he get up here?!

The look in his eyes changed drastically.

“Get down….here!”

As Lin Xiu stepped onto the matrix to get into the air, Lin Xiu screamed as he headed towards Yan Yongxin with his spear.

The energy from his source mark is accumulative. Seeing how Lin Xiu was already heading towards him, Yan Yongxin had no other choice.

He quickly released his ‘Yuan’.

‘Clean Sweep’!

With both his hands on the spear, Lin Xiu did a clean sweep in the air.

Koong Loong – –

Even when Yan Yongxin had already released his ‘Yuan’, his body still fell onto the ground due to the terrifying impact from the attack.

He immediately landed on top of the debris with a loud crash.

Pfft – –

Yan Yongxin, who was lying on the ground, his eyes were wide open and there was blood in his mouth.

After taking a closer look, his ‘Yuan’ was still left open but there were already numerous cracks all over his ‘Yuan’.

Lin Xiu quickly rushed back to the ground as well.

There seemed to be a glow around Lin Xiu’s body.

‘Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall’!

Although this was a low rank warrior skill, it still had an explosive, terrifying impact with Lin Xiu’s overwhelming strength.

“Cough cough…..”

Liu Pan, An Qi and Qian Ling crawled out of the debris as well.

They swept off all of the ashes around them and when they looked up, they saw Lin Xiu rushing onto the ground with the spear in his arm.

There was also a huge crowd that surrounded them and was watching from afar.

As Lin Xiu came rushing from the sky, his figure was like a meteorite that shot across the sky.

“You…..go to hell!!” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lin Xiu roared as he rushed forward and the tip of his spear was pointed towards Yan Yongxin who was lying on the ground.

His entire spear was covered with a dark blue flame.

The air around them was scorching hot and there was a burnt smell that surrounded them.

“No!!!!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was getting closer to him, Yan Yongxin screamed out of fear.
