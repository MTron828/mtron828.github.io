Chapter 194: Besiege

Cheng Fan and the others didn’t say much when they heard Lin Xiu’s mocking words, they simply waved their weapons and continued to slash towards Lin Xiu’s body!

Under the siege of four rank 5 warriors, Lin Xiu knitted his brows.

His expression was very stern.

These people were very strong and had rich combat experience. It was really troublesome to deal with them.

Damn it!

Boom——

At this time, as Lin Xiu blocked the attack from Cheng Fan’s slashing sword, a huge impact suddenly exploded and flames burst out.

Pu——

After Lin Xiu resisted this attack, he felt a tightness in his chest and he retreated several steps as a trace of blood flowed out from his mouth.

“Boy, that’s not bad. You managed to survive till now with all four of us attacking,” The rest of the people looked at Lin Xiu with a visibly surprised look.

The four of them were all rank 5 warriors and Lin Xiu was only a rank 4 warrior yet he could fight on till this moment.

“Leave him to me, this kid just stabbed me, let me end his life.” At this moment, the bald man behind with the huge machete came over and said grimly.

He was stabbed through the palm of his hand and the scabs were clearly visible at this time.

His eyes were malicious and he stared at the injured Lin Xiu.

He wanted to trample on Lin Xiu’s head severely to vent his hatred!

“Scar, you need to be careful, this kid is not easy to deal with.” Seeing the bald man walking over, Cheng Fan said coldly.

“Hng, you think I can’t kill a rank 4 warrior?” The bald man snarled and spoke with a sullen voice.

He walked towards Lin Xiu step by step, firmly holding the seemingly large saber with his right hand.

The other four people encircled Lin Xiu to prevent him from fleeing.

Lin Xiu frowned as he watched the bald man slowly approaching.

This guy was a rank 5 warrior and had a high strength attribute, he was obviously a strength-type warrior.

If this goes on, Lin Xiu would be in danger.

What was he going to do?

“Boy, you are pretty good, you actually attacked me…” The bald man licked his lips and continued to walk to Lin Xiu’s side when he suddenly yelled, “But you also irritated me!!!”

As he said that, he rushed over like a bull!

Boom——

The wide saber slashed fiercely, directly splitting the wall behind Lin Xiu.

“Let’s see where you can hide!!!” The bald man saw that Lin Xiu was trying to hide and became even more agitated.

The majestic source strength was released from the body, enveloping the entire saber.

With each of his attacks, the surrounding buildings made a loud rumbling.

“Is this okay?” The other three rank 5 warriors looked at Cheng Fan and said.

“It’s okay. It’s been long since I met such an interesting freshman. I wanted to have some more fun, but didn’t expect you guys to come back so soon.” Cheng Fan shook his head and said with a smile.

Boom boom——

A large number of buildings collapsed and the power of the bald man was so terrifying, even the ground was cut into deep trenches by his saber.

“What a simple-minded creature with well-developed limbs.” Lin Xiu said aloud as he dodged.

Lin Xiu used ‘Without a Trace’, coupled with his already fast reaction speed and for a while, the bald man could not touch Lin Xiu’s body at all.

“Go to hell!!! I want to chop you into a pulp!!!” Hearing Lin Xiu’s mocking words, the bald man suddenly became furious and slashed the swords in both hands frantically.

‘Lin Xiu?’

Luo Yue was here waiting for Lin Xiu to come over, but after a long time, she didn’t find Lin Xiu and felt that something was wrong.

She thought about it and took out her phone to contact Lin Xiu when she found that Lin Xiu didn’t answer at all.

This made Luo Yue frown.

She immediately tapped on the phone and soon, the signal address generated when Lin Xiu called her was deciphered by her.

Without hesitation, she ran in Lin Xiu’s direction with the long sword in her hand was constantly waving as a large number of zombies were chopped by her.

“Damn, what the hell is this…” Li Ping looked around and was trembling.

There was fog everywhere and they could only see what was next to them. Any further, it was completely white and they couldn’t see clearly at all.

In this kind of darn place, the use of the naked eye was clearly reduced and they could only rely on instincts to avoid danger.

Li Ping held his breath at this time and walked forward slowly.

Just around the corner, he heard a ‘gu gu gu’ sound.

Although the voice was very soft, he could still hear it with full concentration.

Li Ping took a deep breath, then grabbed the saber in his hand tightly as he leaned against the wall and walked forward slowly.

In the next second, as he turned, he raised his saber and slashed!

Go to hell!!!

Dang–

At this moment, the sword seemed to collide with some metal, giving off a clear sound.

“Wait, Li Ping!?” Li Ping was shocked and he heard a familiar voice.

He took a closer look – isn’t this just Zhang Yin and Jiang Li!?

After seeing each other’s faces, these people were pleasantly surprised.

“Damn, you scared me to death, I thought it was a zombie.” Jiang Li said with a sigh of relief.

“I thought so too…” Li Ping his chest, he was obviously frightened just now. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“By the way, have you seen Lin Xiu and Luo Yue?” Zhang Yin looked around and asked.

It was a coincidence that he could find Jiang Li.

“No, I have been looking for you guys and I only found both of you now.” Li Ping shook his head and said.

He didn’t know why everyone was separated suddenly just now which scared him.

“Damn it, the phone can be used, but I forgot to save Lin Xiu’s number.” Zhang Yin said regretfully.

After all, they had been together since the beginning and didn’t think so much.

“Let’s go up ahead and take a look, this navigation map seems a little wrong, the place has been destroyed and it is completely different from the previous map.”
