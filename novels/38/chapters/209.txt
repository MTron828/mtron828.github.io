Chapter 210: Successfully Seized!

“What should we do now? Get ready to grab it?” Lin Xiu asked while looking in that direction.

There was chaos over there now, everyone wanted to get close to that side and seize that Odd crystal. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

But when everyone was about to touch the Odd crystal, they were killed by other warriors.

Those Union army men were also firing crazily over there with their terrifying laser guns.

The entire ground was destroyed by laser beams and terrifying skills.

“Get ready.” At the same time, Zhuo Qixing looked at this scene in the dark and the corners of his mouth raised.

Then, he took out a strange bomb-like thing from his arms.

“This is…” Luo Xiaoqi and the others who followed Zhuo Qixing seemed a little surprised.

“The result of the latest scientific research – the paralyzing smoke bomb. Within three seconds, the smoke released by this thing will cover the entire area and the smoke will have a paralyzing effect.”

“Although it’s not that useful for high-ranking warriors, even a one-second paralysis effect is enough.” Zhuo Qixing said lightly.

“You guys can go now.”

The moment he said that, Zhuo Qixing rushed over and threw the paralyzing smoke bomb directly!

“Get lost!” There were high-ranking warriors all around. Seeing the bomb-like thing that was flying over, their gaze changed and they shouted as they were about to kick this thing away.

But they didn’t expect that this thing would explode instantly when it was in the air before it even got close to them.

In a short time, a cloud of thick white dust scattered all over the area!!!

A large amount of white smoke seemed to envelop the surrounding area in an instant and the visibility suddenly dropped to the extreme!

“Right now!!!” Luo Yue’s gaze changed when she saw this scene. The second she blurted out, she jumped down from the window.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate at this time and the two people rushed into the smoke at once.

Although the dense fog was blocking their vision, they could still sense the area where the Odd crystal was.

Luo Yue’s speed has reached the extreme as she passed through quickly and her steps were very light, completely invisible.

As soon as some warriors inhaled the white smoke, they felt their bodies freeze up suddenly. In that short second, Lin Xiu had already rushed to the corpse of the Ice crystal white bird.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s body was shaking with excitement.

Rank 8 Odd crystal!!!

The moment he stretched out his hand, he immediately felt that he had touched an oval-shaped object and pulled it out with force.

“Let’s go!!!” Luo Yue’s voice rang in Lin Xiu’s ears. Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu changed hands and put the thing into his backpack, and then ran out frantically.

Lin Xiu directly activated the ‘Fury’ skill at this time and his speed reached its peak as Luo Yue ran to another area.

This is a rank 8 Odd crystal!

Even the rank 7 warriors were vying for it!

The warriors here were all above rank 6. If these warriors make a move, it would be very troublesome!

“Get lost!!!” At this time, a warrior slashed out with a sharp saber and a violent strong wind appeared around him immediately, blowing away the thick smoke.

That only lasted for a split second.

Zhuo Qixing widened his eyes and looked at the body of the Ice crystal white bird in disbelief.

The Odd crystal on its head somehow disappeared!

How could that be!?

In that kind of thick fog, it was impossible for anyone to take the Odd crystal away so accurately, and only a few seconds went by!

He clenched his fists and turned around to look, then he saw two figures in the distance.

It was a warrior wearing a black and white combat suit.

“Over there! Chase!!!”

At this time, the other warriors came to their senses and rushed over there frantically!

Lin Xiu sprinted forward with Luo Yue and turned around to take a glance. He immediately saw that there were quite a number of warriors chasing from behind!

What a fast speed!

Seeing this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted slightly.

He was already using the ‘Fury’ skill and his speed had already reached its limits in this state. However, he didn’t expect that the speed of these warriors was even more terrifying.

They were indeed warriors who were rank 6 and above, they were of a totally different level!

Luo Yue also clearly felt this at this time and her expression changed too.

At the next corner, Luo Yue took out something from her pocket and tossed it afar.

At the same time, she pulled Lin Xiu’s arm, and before Lin Xiu had time to react, they jumped down to a certain place at the side.

Boom–

Lin Xiu looked around when he landed.

It was dark.

But soon, Lin Xiu adapted to this environment and discovered that this turned out to be a sewer!

There was a strong pungent smell around. As has been no water passing through for a long time, the sewers were dried up.

Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu and motioned him to move forward quickly.

Lin Xiu nodded and without hesitation, in this dark environment, he ran forward frantically.

“Damn it! Where did they go!?” Those warriors who rushed out first, wanting to chase Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, were shocked when they saw nobody around them at this time.

They looked ahead and suddenly saw a faint red gas released ahead.

At this time, a large number of zombies and evolved beasts seemed to be stimulated by the red gas as they rushed over.

Seeing those darn things rushing over, the faces of these warriors suddenly became extremely nasty.

If they continued this way, there would be no trace of Lin Xiu and the others in this huge G17 Ruin!

Damn it!

“Young Master Zhuo! What’s the matter?” At this time, as the warriors chased after Lin Xiu, some people from the Union army were already trying to move the corpse of the Ice crystal white bird.

Although it was a pity that the Odd crystal disappeared, the body of this Ice crystal white bird was a very precious material.

“It was seized.” When Zhuo Qixing saw that Luo Xiaoqi and the others did not leave and walked out of the dark, he didn’t look very surprised.

“But it doesn’t matter, I still have this.” There was a sneer at the corner of his mouth and he took something out.
