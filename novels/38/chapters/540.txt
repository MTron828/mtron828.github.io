Chapter 541: Level Up!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“99.9%…the energy is engulfed…”

“Congratulations to the master for successfully upgrading! The current level is 33!”

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for successfully upgrading! The current level is 34!”

Hearing the constant prompts in his mind, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened, and he was completely stunned.

Level up! And it was two levels in a row!

After absorbing the energy of this Thunder Lotus Fire, how much experience did he gain exactly? Lin Xiu couldn’t imagine.

At this time, he looked around, and many rank 6 warriors were penetrated by the huge stalactites that fell from the top of their heads, and some who dodged were also hit and were struggling.

These stalactites were not ordinary stalactites. They were ridiculously heavy and sharp. They fell from a high place above their heads and even pierced through the bodies of some unsuspecting rank 6 warriors.

Now, no one has noticed Lin Xiu here, and Wan Lu and Lao Bai were still in the middle, madly fighting with the green dragon.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help narrowing his eyes.

He wouldn’t be so foolish to run out at this time. Instead, he would stay here, let them both suffer, and take advantage of their kill!

After entering the system interface in his mind, Lin Xiu saw his current data:

Level: 34

Experience point: 0/30 billion

Strength: 700

Physique: 330

Speed: 220

Skills: Analytic Eye, Fury, Disguise, Engulf, Mirror Image, Heavenly Array

Rage Build-up: 0/100

Potential Points: 67

Title: Rank 6 Warrior (Unused Titles: Rank 1 Warrior, Rank 2 Warrior, Rank 3 Warrior, Rank 4 Warrior, Rank 5 Warrior)

‘After another level up, I would be a rank 7 warrior!’

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but get excited.

Looking at these 67 potential points, Lin Xiu hesitated, which attribute should he add them to now?

Now his strength was fairly good, and his speed was also very fast with the cooperation of his body skill [Without a Trace].

Forget it, strengthen my physique first!

After thinking about it, Lin Xiu directly added all the 67 potential points to his physique. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As soon as it was added to his physique, Lin Xiu immediately felt a burst of relief in his body.

“Damn!!!” Wan Lu also had a lot of wounds on his body at this time. At this time, he clenched his fists suddenly and attacked the Green Dragon with another punch.

Not only Wan Lu, but Lao Bai’s situation also looked very bad. The Green Dragon left deep bloody scratch marks on his right hand.

In the beginning, the two of them were able to keep using ‘Sphere’ to resist the attack of the green dragon, but it was draining the source strength in their bodies.

As soon as the protection of the ‘Sphere’ disappeared, the Green Dragon’s offensive became wilder.

“I’ll go all out with you!!!” Lao Bai had blood all over his body and looked very terrifying. At this time, he gritted his teeth, then holding the long sword in his hand, he frantically stabbed the green dragon!

The battle soon came to an end. At the next moment, the green dragon was swaying under the attack of Wan Lu and Lao Bai, two warriors who were infinitely close to rank 8, and then fell to the ground with a ‘bang’.

“Finally dead…” Lao Bai heaved a sigh of relief, the long sword in his hands also fell to the ground, his legs were weak, and his body almost fell to the ground.

Wan Lu was also out of breath at this time and then sat down on the ground.

Really dead!?

Lin Xiu looked at the huge green dragon and looked at this scene with some doubts in his eyes.

“Go and see, let this green dragon bleed!” Lao Bai felt the pain in his body now, and couldn’t help but clench his teeth. At this time, he looked at the fallen green dragon over there, and there was an extremely angry expression in his eyes.

The few rank 6 warriors who were lucky enough to survive and were not injured also nodded at this time and approached the Green Dragon.

“Go to hell!”

A warrior held a long sword in his hand and was about to bleed the Green Dragon to death.

Roar–

But just as they were approaching the green dragon, it suddenly stood up, opened its huge mouth, and instantly tore off the few people in front of them who had yet to react!

Not dead yet!?

When Wan Lu and Lao Bai saw this scene, their eyes changed greatly, and their faces showed horror.

They went all out just now. Now, they no longer had the strength to fight.

“This beast is actually pretending to be dead…” Lin Xiu looked at this scene, and was startled.

The next scene looked a little bloody, including Wan Lu and Lao Bai, all of them were brutally bitten off by the green dragon.

In this space now, there was only one living person, Lin Xiu.

The Green Dragon’s eyes seemed to be scanning all over the place. It also had many injuries on its body, and its mouth was still full of blood.

Lin Xiu held his breath and remained motionless.

This Green Dragon seemed to be watching the surroundings very cautiously, then it looked at Lin Xiu.

Found me!?

Lin Xiu was startled, but in the next moment, the Green Dragon turned his head and looked at the other side.

When Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief, he found that the Green Dragon suddenly turned around, and a powerful and terrifying energy body had gathered in his mouth.

At this moment, Lin Xiu directly attacked him!

“Damn!”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but cursed and flew to the side.

Boom—

The lightning ball hit the place where Lin Xiu was at just now, and instantly made a loud noise.

Lin Xiu rolled, and while standing, he lifted the Dark Edge spear from the ground.

Looking to the back, this green dragon was rushing towards Lin Xiu at a very fast speed.

With its mouth open, it was about to bite Lin Xiu.

Its speed was really amazing, even with such a size, it seemed like a dangerous poisonous snake.

Although Lin Xiu had just leveled up twice, he was not sure that he would be able to kill the Green Dragon at this time.

At this time, without any hesitation, the system skills ‘Fury’ and ‘Heavenly Array’ were activated directly!

As soon as ‘Heavenly Array’ was activated, a pattern of pale white light appeared on the ground.

Coupled with ‘Fury’, Lin Xiu’s physical strength at this time has reached its peak.

Swoosh—

Lin Xiu leaned to the side and dodged the bite of the green dragon, and at the next moment, the Dark Edge spear in his right hand stabbed its upper body!

“‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!”

Lin Xiu let out a loud roar, and instantly stabbed a dozens of times, each stab going all the way to the flesh!
