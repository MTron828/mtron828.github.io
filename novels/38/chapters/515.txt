Chapter 516: People from the Sky City

As for the warriors who were standing behind Jin Yuan, all of them rushed towards Lin Xiu after getting the commands from their Young Master.

Lin Xiu swept a glance at them and knew that these were all rank 5 warriors.

Well there wasn’t much difference between rank 5 and rank 6 warriors.

“You’re the one who asked for it!” Lin Xiu snorted and without using the Dark Edge that was on his right hand, he directly attacked them with his left hand!

“That fella is dead!”

The warriors around them already knew the ending when they saw what was happening. They were sure that Lin Xiu had overestimated his abilities and was hitting a rock with an egg.

However, a shocking scene appeared right before their eyes.

Lin Xiu only used his left arm and was able to strike all of the bodyguards that was headed in his direction!

One should remember that all of Jin Yuan’s bodyguards were rank 5 warriors!

“This is impossible!” One of the warriors by the side couldn’t help but stand up and shock.

This was incredibly terrifying. What did Lin Xiu do?! How did he throw them off so easily?!

“I guess it’s my turn now?” Lin Xiu looked at Jin Yuan who was close by.

“What do you want?!” Jin Yuan roared when he saw Lin Xiu walking towards him.

He had never expected Lin Xiu to be so powerful that he even looked scary! His bodyguards were just like a screen that Lin Xiu easily destroyed!

“You’re crazy! He’s from the Jin family!” Chen Yang stumbled as he stood up and started shouting at Lin Xiu as well.

This was Bai Di City and his family, the Chen family, was considered one of the strongest families in this city. He wanted to just scare Lin Xiu with his family’s name!

But he didn’t think that Lin Xiu would react in this manner!

“Since you have already ordered your men to kill me, I should be able to do the same as well.” Lin Xiu said bluntly as he looked at Jin Yuan.

As Lin Xiu spoke, everyone around them could feel chills running down their spines.

This young man….really had the guts to kill another person!

“You…” Jin Yuan looked at Lin Xiu who looked like a heartless killer and his body started trembling uncontrollably.

“Stop it!” At that moment, there was a man that suddenly appeared out of nowhere and stopped right in front of Lin Xiu.

“Mr Qian!” The receptionists at the counter were all in shock as well with what was happening.

They felt surprised and happy when they saw the man that appeared.

“That’s enough. Let it go.” The man, known as Mr Qian, was a middle-aged man with a broad face and a stern expression on his face.

“Oh? Why didn’t you say so when he ordered his men to kill me?” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he asked the man before him.

This could only happen because of his own abilities. If it wasn’t because he was strong enough, he would have been killed by those men.

Mr Qian frowned as he gave Lin Xiu a cold look, “This is a hotel under the Warriors Union. Are you sure you want to kill him here?!”

“So what?” Lin Xiu hated being threatened by others which was why he rebutted the middle aged man.

Mr Qian’s pupil shrank uncontrollably as well from his reply and soon, there was a murderous look in his eyes.

“Are you sure?” Then, a sword appeared out of nowhere and it was being held against his neck.

Mr Qian’s body froze on the spot and when he looked up, he saw a beautiful girl who was holding onto the sword.

This beautiful girl had a distant, unbothered look on her face.

He didn’t get the chance to properly see Luo Yue’s face earlier. Now that he was able to do so, he seemed to be reminded about something and started stuttering, “Miss…Luo?”

After hearing what he said, Luo Yue frowned at her gorgeous brows. She couldn’t recall who this man was.

Lin Xiu was curious as well. This man, Mr Qian, knew Luo Yue?

“Three years ago, I had the honour to watch Miss Luo and Mr Luo at the Warrior’s Match in Sky City.” Mr Qian answered her in respect.

Sky City?!

They are from Sky City?!

After hearing what Mr Qian said, the rest of the warriors were stunned as well.

As for Chen Yang and Jin Yuan, they heard what Mr Qian said as well and were both equally shocked.

Now it made sense to them why Lin Xiu was so powerful when he was just a young man! He was from Sky City!

Lin Xiu knew that everyone had mistaken him as someone who was from Sky City but he didn’t bother explaining himself and he didn’t see why he had to as well.

“Miss Luo….and this young man, I apologise for my ill manners.” Mr Qian said with an apologetic look on his face.

Luo Yue has never thought of killing this man since he was the owner of this hotel which meant that he was part of the Warriors Union.

Even the Luo family wouldn’t dare go against the Warriors Union so publicly.

“Those men….how will you deal with them?” Luo Yue asked as she pointed at Chen Yang and Jin Yuan.

When they heard her clear, stern voice, their bodies trembled in fear.

“We are the ones who were young and dumb. Please have mercy on us just this once.” Chen Yang was a smart one as well. From how Mr Qian was acting while talking to her, it was possible that Luo Yue was the descendant of a powerful family from Sky City. This was not someone that they could mess with.

“Sorry.” Jin Yuan got on his knees as well and forcefully apologised.

The Jin family may be an influential family as well in another city but they still weren’t as strong as the ones from the Sky City.

“Miss Luo and this young man, since they have apologised for their mistakes, let’s forget about this and move on, shall we? Since this is a hotel of the Warriors Union, it wouldn’t be a good idea to murder someone here.” Mr Qian spoke towards Luo Yue.

“Are you pressuring me with the Warriors Union?” Luo Yue glared at Mr Qian as she asked him.

“Of course not.” There were droplets of sweat that formed on Mr Qian’s forehead as he quickly defended himself. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Three seconds.” Luo Yue gave a look towards those fools.

Three seconds?!

Chen Yang and Jin Yuan were stunned for a moment but quickly understood what she meant and quickly ran out of the hotel lobby.

“Thank you.” Mr Qian let out a breath of relief as well. If Luo Yue insisted on killing them, he really didn’t know what to do as well.

Since Chen Yang and Jin Yuan were also from powerful families in this city.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue.

She nodded her head and the both of them walked towards the exit and went to their room by elevator.

“Hu…..” Mr Qian felt relieved. He didn’t expect her to be in Bai Di City.

“Damn it! If it wasn’t because of you, I wouldn’t end up this way!” Jin Yuan had just run from the lobby. Seeing how Luo Yue and Lin Xiu weren’t chasing after them, he quickly let out a sigh of relief. Then, he turned towards Chen Yang with an angry look in his eyes.

“Young Master Jin, I think we should go to the hospital first…..” Chen Yang said as he trembled.

His eyes were now filled with fear. He didn’t think that he would have dug his own grave!
