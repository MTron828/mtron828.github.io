Chapter 340: Fierce Battle

That terrifying flaming phoenix was now like a huge meteorite falling from the sky!

Boom——

With a loud sound, the whole ground shook.

Although the middle-aged man unfolded the ‘Sphere’, the flaming phoenix hit it directly!

At the moment of the impact, a huge fire tornado was formed..

Lin Xiu, who saw this scene, had a change of expression.

“Would it be enough to kill him…” Lin Xiu squeezed the Dark Edge spear in his hand, gritted his teeth, and mumbled.

The middle-aged man who was among the flames could only see fiery red at this moment.

Although his body was now protected by the ‘Sphere’, he could still feel the intense burning sensation around him.

This burning sensation made his body start to sweat.

A burning sensation that seemed to cook his body and him clench his teeth.

He had no idea that Lin Xiu, a rank 5 warrior, could unleash such a powerful skill!

The power of this skill was beyond his imagination.

“It seems that the guy is pretty strong ah.” At this time, the pale-faced man looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

There was a look of approval in his eyes.

“He is, for a rank 5 warrior to achieve this level, indeed quite strong.” The dark man beside him yelled.

At this time, Luo Yue looked at these two warriors, her eyes were cold and the long sword in her hand was clenched tightly.

“However, what we have to do now is to first extract the remaining energy of the ice lotus fire in your body.” The pale-faced man grimaced at this time.

As soon as he spoke, he held the long sword in his hand and rushed towards Luo Yue!

Swish——

The pale-faced man rushed in front of Luo Yue at an incredible speed.

“Go to hell!”

Following his roar, the long sword in his hand was like a cold light and it slashed directly towards Luo Yue’s body!

Dang–

But Luo Yue’s reaction was not slow at all. At this moment, the long sword in her hand blocked the attack, and a clear sound rang out.

“Oh? You could actually block my attack?” This pale-faced man seemed a little surprised.

“You talk a lot of nonsense.” Luo Yue said lightly.

As soon as she put force on the long sword, it caused the man to take a few steps back.

How could it be!?

The man was shocked at this time. He had just clearly felt that the powerful force coming from Luo Yue’s hand and it shocked him.

What is the strength of this woman…

“Hey, Ah Bai, you can’t even defeat a woman?” At this moment, a mocking voice came from behind.

The man called Ah Bai looked at the dark-skinned man with a snarl and said, “How about you try?”

“Sure!” Hearing his words, the dark-skinned man suddenly revealed a sinister smile and rushed over!

He also had a long sword in his hand.

As he rushed over, the long sword instantly turned into a cold light and pierced directly towards Luo Yue!

He was clearly using most of his body strength and the speed and power that burst out were very formidable.

Luo Yue seemed to feel this too. At this moment, she did not use the long sword to block but dodged the attack directly.

Swish——

The long sword passed Luo Yue’s body.

It didn’t chop her body but it chopped off a few strands of her hair.

“Where are you going to hide!” The dark-skinned man who looked like charcoal, saw Luo Yue dodging his attack and his face turned nasty.

In his opinion, it should be very easy to kill a warrior of Luo Yue’s level very easily, but what he didn’t expect was that Luo Yue actually dodged his attack from the beginning!?

With this thought, a stronger murderous intent burst in his eyes and he continued to attack Luo Yue!

Swish swish swish——

His blade cut through the air but Luo Yue’s body skill was incredible. At this moment, it was as if she was dancing as she continued dodging. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“What kind of body skill is this!?” The warrior called Ah Bai watched the battle between the dark-skinned man and Luo Yue and his face was full of shock.

What kind of body skill is this? How could Luo Yue dodge the attacks of their rank 7 warrior so easily!?

Could it be that she was truly from the Luo family!?

With this thought, his expression turned nasty.

Even just now, he still didn’t think that Luo Yue belonged to Sky City, Luo family.

Because that Luo family was a very famous family, why would the Luo family come here? And she’s a young lady.

But at this moment, he was starting to believe her.

“Ah Hei, let’s get her together!” He looked at Ah Hei who was fighting with Luo Yue and called out.

“Let’s do it!” Ah Hei’s face was very nasty at this time because even though Luo Yue had no chance of attacking him, he couldn’t attack her either.

What kind of body skill is this!!!

At this moment, as Ah Bai charged over, the look on Luo Yue’s face changed.

After all, these two were rank 7 warriors and it was already quite tiring to deal with one, if she had to deal with two rank 7 warriors, the situation would get sticky!

At the same time, on the other side.

The flaming tornado slowly weakened at this moment.

Lin Xiu squeezed the Dark Edge Spear in his hand and looked afar, his body tensed up.

Could the fire really kill that guy?

As Lin Xiu looked over, he suddenly saw a light blue barrier.

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes constricted.

‘Sphere’!!!

It was the “Sphere” that the guy unfolded!

It seemed like this guy was not dead yet!?
