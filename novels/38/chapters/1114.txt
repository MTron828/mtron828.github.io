Chapter 1115: Holy Water

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Wu Hao widened his eyes in disbelief when he saw how Lin Xiu had turned into a skeleton.

“Umm….for some reason, my flesh has been destroyed.”

Lin Xiu said helplessly.

When Lin Xiu’s gene lock was unlocked, there seemed to be an obvious change to his bones.

Plus, with the rule of power’s domain, he felt much tougher as well. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

!!

It felt as if he had suddenly entered an entirely new realm.

This was a type of upgrade in his realm.

“Huuu….I was so afraid just now.”

After making sure that it was Lin XIu standing right in front of him, he felt relieved.

“Looks like all the warriors of the Bai family in Bai Di City has been completely destroyed.”

“The Holy City is far from us as well. They don’t have a teleportation device that connects here as well. Even if they heard of this, it would not be that easy for their men to get here.”

Lin Xiu looked at them and said calmly.

Ye Kai and the rest of them were still absorbing their odd crystals.

These odd crystals were the ones that he got from killing the ice crystal snakes. Lin Xiu had killed a large number of them.

Therefore, he had a large number of odd crystals as well.

It wouldn’t bring Lin Xiu much EXP even if he absorbed them but for respected warriors like them, this was a very powerful energy source.

They should be able to become sage warriors very soon after absorbing them.

“I would have to fasten my speed on building the energy barrier. Otherwise, it might be destroyed by these fellas once when they are done tomorrow.”

Wu Hao nodded his head and he let out a bitter laugh.

“En. It must have troubled you.”

Lin Xiu answered instead.

Wu Hao looked at Lin Xiu who was now a body of gold skeleton and he looked incredibly odd.

How did Lin Xiu end up in this manner?

What was most shocking was how Lin Xiu could still talk after turning into a skeleton.

“Oh ….do you know about purple crystal spirit?”

Lin Xiu seems to have thought of something before asking him.

Back then, when Lin Xiu’s body was regenerated, he also used the purple crystal spirit to rebuild his body.

“Purple Crystal Spirit?”

After hearing what Lin Xiu asked, Sima Qiang and the rest were stunned.

But soon, all of them shook their heads.

“I don’t think we’ve heard of it…”

Lin Xiu was not surprised with their answer.

Since the purple crystal spirit was only found on Marqi Planet, it was not a surprise that they have not heard of it.

“Young master, if you want to regenerate your body, you can use the holy water.”

Zhao Yongyuan was reminded of something and he told Lin Xiu respectfully.

“Holy water?”

Lin Xiu was the one who was shocked this time. He has never heard of the holy water.

“This was a treasure of the Ye family, the holy water is able to save dead people; even skeletons.”

Zhao Yongyuan continued answering Lin Xiu.

“Where is it then?”

Lin Xiu asked anxiously.

Although his energy had not dropped, he was now only a skeleton and this was definitely a problem.

“Bai family in Holy City.”

Zhao Yongyuan answered in a solemn tone.

“Back then, when the Bai family attacked the Ye family, they took away the holy water as well.

“Holy City was a place that belonged to the Ye family. In the heart of it, there is a well and with the help of heaven and earth, there will be one drop that will be formed each year.

“If i’m right, there should be quite a large amount of holy water there.”

As Zhao Yongyuan spoke, Lin Xiu nodded his head.

That’s great. He had a new target now which was to rebuild his body and this was only a matter of time.

“Umm… I’ll need some time to prepare and will be leaving soon.”

Lin Xiu told the rest of them.

“Young master, are you really going to Holy City?”

Sima Qiang asked subconsciously.

“What’s wrong?”

Upon hearing Sima Qiang’s question, Lin Xiu asked in return.

“I heard that the Bai family would have warrior gods over there. It would be very dangerous.”

Sima Qiang continued.

“Warrior god?”

“There shouldn’t be any. This is because there is the rule of power. Warrior gods shouldn’t be here unless they have used a certain type of energy to transport parts of their energy here.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

This energy was similar to the god’s domain that the Huangfus have.

However, these energies were minimal and for now, it would not be a threat to Lin Xiu.

“Well…young master, please be careful.”

Seeing how Lin Xiu had already made up his mind, he no longer tried to stop Lin Xiu.

“Oh…Wu Hao, I’ll leave the building up to you. Yongyuan and Elder Qiang, both of you will have to train them once they become sage warriors.”

Lin Xiu reminded them.

Since they have been upgraded to sage warriors using the fastest route by absorbing odd crystals, their domains might not be stable yet.

This was why they still needed Zhao Yongyuan and Sima Qiang to help them.

“Please rest assured, young master.”

Sima Qiang and Zhao Yongyuan nodded their heads.

“Alright. Be prepared for the battles. I will be headed to Holy CIty now. If there’s any news, I will pass them to you.”

Lin Xiu told the rest of them.

Then, he looked for an armour, a helmet and also a mask in Bai Di City before leaving for Holy City.

Lin Xiu was now seated on an android battle horse. After checking the projection on the computer installed on the battle horse and making sure that it was the right direction, the android battle horse automatically went toward the destination.

The Holy City was on the other side of the planet which was far away.

However, this android battle horse was travelling at a quick speed and it was also because of the map that he had downloaded.

All of the routes where they would face obstacles have been eliminated.

The only reason why he did not take the Angel with him was because the Angel was too big and it would catch too much attention.

After that battle, words of the Angel would have spreaded online.

For now, Lin Xiu was entering different cities and with the help of the teleportation device, Lin Xiu was getting closer to Holy City.

One day, while Lin Xiu was riding on his android battle horse, he heard a loud noise in front of him.

Hmm?

Lin Xiu was shocked when he heard the sound. He quickly stopped his android battle horse and walked closer to the sound. That’s when he saw that it was a huge bird.

The bird was flying in circles in the air and there was a bright flame all over his body.

The warriors on the ground were running in different directions in order to hide from its attacks.

After seeing what was happening, Lin Xiu subconsciously used the Analytic Eye and knew that this bird was the Phoenix! A beast saint!

“A beast saint huh?”

Lin Xiu looked at the huge phoenix. He hesitated for a short while but then quickly got on his battle horse and went close to the bird!
