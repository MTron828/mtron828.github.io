Chapter 310: Fall

Bang bang bang-

One after another, the blazing birds struck the unicorn terror beast.

Roar-

It struggled amidst the flames as though in pain.

‘Although it was afraid of fire, why isn’t my flames able to kill it right away!?’

Lin Xiu frowned at the sight of this.

“Let’s go, quickly!” All the warriors that saw the unicorn terror beast inside the fire started to shout.

This was the best opportunity for them to continue onward.

All the rank 6 warriors started to run.

But just as they were about to move past the beast, the unicorn terror beast unleashed a roar and extinguished the flames on its body!

Rumble-

The sight of all the warriors bypassing it infuriated the Unicorn terror beast. It instantly used its feet to trample them!

Following the loud stomp, a few warriors were caught off guard and turned into meat pulps.

Lin Xiu’s expression changed when he saw how easily it extinguished the flames.

‘Is it not afraid of fire?!’

‘Impossible, I clearly sensed the pain when it got struck by the flames.’

While Lin Xiu was racking his brains, the gigantic Unicorn terror beast suddenly charged at him!

Rumble rumble-

The ground trembled incessantly as it charged forward.

Roar–

It unleashed a loud roar and immediately opened its mouth with the intent to devour Lin Xiu.

But Lin Xiu was agile and avoided it with ease.

The Unicorn terror beast seemed to hate Lin Xiu to the core and continued to charge after him. It aimed its horn at him with the intent of penetrating through his body.

Clang-

Lin Xiu moved to the side and avoided the unicorn terror beast’s charge, then flipped Dark Edge and stabbed at its body.

When the speartip touched the unicorn terror beast’s body, it produced a loud and clear sound.

It had extremely tough skin and the spear was unable to penetrate through.

Lin Xiu was stunned by the sight of this.

‘What the hell!?’

‘Were my flames completely ineffective against it!?’

While confused, the unicorn terror beast let out a roar and turned to charge at him again.

“How do you want to deal with it?” Hua Tian revealed a smile and asked from a distance.

A rank 5 warrior going against a rank 7 evolved beast had surprised Hua Tian.

And what surprised him further was that Lin Xiu’s reaction speed was so fast that the unicorn terror beast had no way of touching him!

He was extremely fast!

Whenever he saw the unicorn terror beast charging at him, Lin Xiu would avoid the charge and swing his hands to summon phoenixes with Dark Edge Spear and attack.

ROAR-

The unicorn terror beast’s gaze changed when it saw the phoenixes charging from its flank. It let out a loud roar and pounced forward by unleashing strength under its feet and extinguished the phoenixes before turning its attention back to Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu retreated repeatedly and swung Dark Edge to attack the unicorn terror beast with the blazing birds.

The unicorn terror beast was forced to retreat every time the blazing birds attacked, perfectly hindering it from pouncing on Lin Xiu.

But even so, it remained relentless and tried to charge at him.

It’s bronze and large eyes were turning scarlet.

And its nose was emitting steam.

Roar-

It steadied its legs and unleashed a sudden burst of strength as it charged at Lin Xiu!

This time, Lin Xiu did not retreat backwards but instead dodged to the side!

The unicorn terror beast had unleashed all of its power with the intent of crashing into Lin Xiu, but who would have thought that Lin Xiu would dodge to the side instantly instead of moving backwards. The unicorn terror beast was unable to stop itself!

And it was heading to the cliff!

Roar-

The unicorn terror beast let out a loud roar and charged with its heavy momentum!

Rumble-

At the next moment, it fell down from the cliff and a loud sound could be heard from the bottom.

Lin Xiu stood at the edge and looked down, the unicorn terror beast had fallen and its body had landed perfectly on a sharp rock.

The sharp rock was extremely tough and actually penetrated through the unicorn terror beast!

It tried to struggle out but was unable to do so.

Blood continued to flow down from the black and sharp rock.

As it continued to struggle, it became weaker and weaker.

This would go on until it died.

No one could have thought that a rank 7 evolved beast could die like that.

After all, rank 7 evolved beasts were sentient and would not charge down foolishly. It was Lin Xiu’s ploy and constant luring by retreating backwards that infuriated the beast to charge at him.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing rank 7 evolved beast, obtaining 89 million experience points!”

Lin Xiu was ecstatic when he heard the notification. It seemed as though it was counted his kill and he gained a lot from it.

Although it was still far for him to level up.

Just as Lin Xiu was basking in joy, a loud sound came from the top of the mountain!

Buzz-

The sudden buzzing shook his mind.

He was instantly stunned for a moment. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

‘What is that?’

Lin Xiu turned and saw many rocks rolling down!
