Chapter 870: Wait For Me To Come Home

The warriors who were all warrior kings were killed in an instant!

At the same time, Luo Yue continued moving around swifty with her sword.

As she slowly danced with her sword, there were bright lights that flashed before their eyes.

Her long, white hair was flowing in the air as well.

She was looking extremely gentle and light as she moved across the cave.

Clang clang clang – –

As the metals collided with each other, there was a huge sound that rang across the room. The warriors who were trying to fight luo Yue had their weapons thrown onto the ground.

With a blink of an eye, the sword in her arms started glowing brightly.

There was a horrifying aura that was coming from the sword and there was a sharp, ringing sound that could be heard.

The warriors didn’t have the time to figure out what was happening and they were already chopped into several pieces.

It was only within seconds and those from the Nanor Planet were already completely defeated by Luo Yue and Lin Xiu!

“Who…..who are you?!”

Jinli’s eyes were opened wide as he stared at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue who were walking toward him.

There was fear in his eyes.

How was it possible that these earthlings were so powerful?!

This was earth! A low, powerless, weak planet!

“How do you use this machine?”

Lin Xiu completely ignored his question and asked him another one instead.

Jinli looked around. He was trying to take a few step back before saying, “I don’t know.”

As soon as he finished, Luo Yue held up her sword once again and with a few swings in the air, there was a terrifying aura that was released from it.

The bodies of the warriors around Jinli were immediately chopped into two!

Jin Li could feel how strong and terrifying the aura was.

When he looked at the bodies around that had been chopped into pieces, he couldn’t help but shiver.

He looked extremely frightened as he looked at Luo Yue.

If Luo Yue wanted him dead, he would have been chopped into pieces as well.

“So, will you start talking or not?”

Lin Xiu didn’t say much. He picked up his long spear and pointed the tip of it at Jinli’s forehead.

All of the warriors were dead because of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

He was the only one left.

Jinli stared at the long spear that was right in front of his eyes.

There was still fresh blood dripping off the tip of the spear.

He suddenly thought of how Lin Xiu was the one who killed most of the warriors here with this long spear. He could still remember how all of their heads exploded and it sent chills down his spine.

He didn’t even have the spirit to fight them.

Both of them were too strong.

“I’ll tell you...”

Jinli had no other choice but to start talking.

“You just have to place the odd crystals here in this spot and press this button. Then, we will be able to be transported to different planets...”

Jinli pointed at the twelve holes in the space transportation device as well as the activation button that was red in colour.

As they were listening to what Jinli was saying, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

The odd crystals …..should be those from evolved beasts?

“But, I don’t think you will be able to find odd crystals that are suitable on earth...”

Jinli continued talking to them about the space teleportation device.

“You….how did you find earth? What do you want here?”

Lin Xiu continued asking.

The look in Jinli’s eyes changed after hearing Lin Xiu’s question.

It was as if he had thought of something.

Xiu – –

That’s when Lin Xiu moved his spear and sliced off Jinli’s right arm.

“AHHHHHHH!!!!”

There was a sharp pain coming from the missing arm and Jinli screamed in pain.

“Fine! I’ll tell you!”

Lin Xiu was still moving his spear and was about to slice off his other arm. He quickly stopped Lin Xiu as his body trembled.

He could feel the murderous intention coming from Lin Xiu. If he refused to answer, he would have been killed by this long spear within seconds.

“I found this small planet by coincidence. We just wanted to take control of this planet so that the earthlings would work as our slaves...”

Jinli no longer cared about the rest and immediately told everything that he knew.

Lin Xiu raised his brows. Although he wasn’t happy with what he heard, he was sure that those on the Nanor Planet now were not the Bai family.

“Who else is there?”

Lin Xiu asked another question.

“We are members of the God Hunters. Most of them are still on the Nanor Planet. There are about 2 thousand of us and our leader is much stronger than I am.”

Jinli looked at Lin Xiu as he said those words.

His eyes seemed to be threatening Lin Xiu.

But, Lin Xiu wasn’t afraid and said in a flat tone, “A respected warrior?”

“HOW….HOW DID YOU KNOW?!”

Jinli was shocked as his eyes were opened wide.

He didn’t think that these earthlings would know what a respected warrior was.

From what he knew before, the strongest warriors on earth were only rank 9 warriors.

They even used extraordinary measures to get Nan Jing from the Nan family to become a warrior master. They wanted Nan Jing to help them take control of the earth but who would have thought that all of their plans were ruined. The men that he had brought with him were all killed!

“Alright then, goodbye.”

Lin Xiu already got the answers that he wanted. He raised his spear and immediately killed Jinli.

This man wasn’t extremely powerful which meant that he was only a normal member of the god hunters.

Even if he continued asking, there was nothing more that he could get.

“I am going to Nanor Planet.”

He was looking at the space teleportation device as he spoke to Luo Yue who was standing next to him.

“I’m going too.”

Luo Yue stayed quiet for a little while before saying to Lin Xiu.

“No. You are staying on earth.”

Lin Xiu grabbed onto Luo Yue’s shoulder and looked at her beautiful eyes before saying to her.

They have no idea what it was like on the Nanor Planet but there was one thing that he could be sure of. The warriors on that planet was extremely strong.

He wanted to go there so that he could finish the promise that he made with that old man and he also wanted to find the Orchid of Heavens so that Luo Yue could be treated.

Therefore, he didn’t want Luo Yue to travel to the Nanor Planet and put herself in danger.

“But...”

Luo Yue was worried. The Nanor Planet would be much more dangerous than the Marqi Planet. If Lin Xiu went alone...

“Don’t worry. I’ll be fine.”

Lin Xiu reassured Luo Yue.

“Wait for me to come home and we’ll get married.”
