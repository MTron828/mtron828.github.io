Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

‘All four of my limbs!?’

When Lin Xiu heard what he said, his eyes narrowed.

The Analytic Eye was activated and he could see Tang Tian’s information:

Character: Tang Tian

Quasi-warrior

Strength: 102

Physique: 75

Speed: 46

Overall combat strength: 752

Seeing this, Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted. This chap was about to become an official warrior and other than his speed, his other attributes were much stronger than Lin Xiu’s.

Damn it.

“Bang”

Just then, Tang Tian had already charged over and he was about to punch Lin Xiu.

Under normal circumstances, Lin Xiu could still dodge, but at this moment, Lin Xiu had a weight of over 100 kilograms on him!

A punch landed heavily on Lin Xiu’s chest and he felt his qi and blood surging inside him as he spat out a mouthful of fresh blood.

“Stop it!” Ye Shuang’er ran over and stood in front of Lin Xiu to block.

“Get lost, otherwise, you’ll end up like him.” Tang Tian said icily.

“Don’t you dare!” Lin Xiu stood up suddenly and his hands were balled up into fists as he yelled fiercely.

Before Tang Tian could attack again, Lin Xiu launched an attack over.

“You’ve overestimated your own capabilities,” Tang Tian sneered. Lin Xiu’s actions were simply too slow in his eyes.

When Lin Xiu attacked, Tang Tian didn’t move or dodge at all and simply threw a punch over.

Taking a closer look, his fist appeared to have an unusual qi wrapped around it.

Source strength!?

Lin Xiu was stunned. This chap was only a quasi-warrior and had already learned cultivation technique, he could already absorb source energy into his body?

His fist was about to pound onto Lin Xiu’s fist in no time.

But just as Tang Tian and Lin Xiu’s fists were about to collide, he opened his fist and grabbed Lin Xiu’s arm. At this moment, he used a lot of force and there was a resounding bone-cracking sound.

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and the sharp pain caused his eyes to open wide.

After that, Tang Tian swept his right leg horizontally and Lin Xiu fell to the ground.

“Smash his legs!” Those people who were with Tang Ping just now yelled while Tang Ping was already sent to the medical room.

Tang Tian saw that Ye Shuang’er wanted to run over to stop him, so he waved his arm out in that direction and the wind from his palm made Ye Shuang’er fall to the ground instantly.

“I want you not only to become a useless person, I want you to be crippled.” Tang Tian revealed a sinister smile then lifted his right leg and was about to step onto Lin Xiu’s leg.

Even in today’s world, if the bones were completely broken, there was no way of getting it back to the same way it was before and he might need to replace them with prosthetics next time. This was fatal for a warrior.

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted and he broke out in cold sweat. Right now, he couldn’t retaliate anymore.

Weak. He was still too weak!

“Stop!”

Just as Tang Tian was about to step on Lin Xiu’s right leg, a voice rang out.

Tang Tian turned in the direction where the voice came from and didn’t care, he did not stop.

“Bang.” His leg was about to step down, but Tang Tian suddenly felt a force and was so shocked that he took several steps back. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Tang Tian, what are you doing!” Luo Li stared at Tang Tian and when he saw that Lin Xiu was fine, he couldn’t help but heaved a sigh of relief.

Lin Xiu had improved drastically and according to his current growth rate, if he continued this way, he could possibly become very powerful.

It would be a real pity if his legs were destroyed by Tang Tian just like that.

“Oh, so it’s Teacher Luo.” Tang Tian said indifferently, he didn’t seem to care just because Luo Li was a teacher at the academy.

“A senior is bullying a sophomore student?” Luo Li furrowed his brows and asked sternly.

Luo Li was very upset with Tang Tian’s attitude but Tang Tian was from the Tang family and the Tang family was quite influential in this area. Also, they sponsored the building of this academy.

“He broke my younger brother Tang Ping’s wrist first,” Tang Tian said coldly.

He looked at Lin Xiu like he was looking at a dead person.

Once he decided on something, nobody could stop him.

Even if he couldn’t break Lin Xiu’s limbs right now, he could do it after school or during the holidays. Would Luo Li always be there, huh?

“Exactly, Lin Xiu bullied us first!” Those lackeys of Tang Ping spoke up at this moment too.

“Tang Ping said he wanted to spar and he almost used his palm to attack brother Lin Xiu’s crown while they were sparring like he wanted Lin Xiu’s life!” Ye Shuang’er was sent flying by Tang Tian’s palm, but she wasn’t hurt.

“The academy will decide who’s right and who’s wrong.” Luo Li said coldly.

There were cameras around this place and they would find out what exactly happened later on.

Tang Tian frowned, then turned around and wanted to leave.

“Tang Tian, I want to have a martial arts battle with you.” At this moment, Lin Xiu stood up and said to Tang Tian.

Tang Tian stopped in his tracks, then turned his head and sneered, “You sure?”

“Lin Xiu, don’t be foolish!” When Luo Li heard what Lin Xiu said, he quickly pulled Lin Xiu’s arm.

Martial arts battle had another name, the battle of life and death!

Two people could attack at will until the other party conceded defeat, and nobody had to take any responsibility for death.

“You don’t dare?” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said.

“What a joke.”

“You think I wouldn’t dare?” Tang Tian laughed.

“Three days later, martial arts hall.”

“Brother Lin Xiu, what is a martial arts battle?” When Ye Shuang’er saw that Tang Tian had left, she asked Lin Xiu nervously.

“Just a normal sparring.” Lin Xiu smiled and gave Luo Li a look.

“You must be careful, then…” Ye Shuang’er said.

Not long after, Ye Shuang’er left after the teacher called out.

“You’re really going to fight with him?” Luo Li asked.

“You have great potential and improved so much within such a short span of time, but Tang Tian is about to become an official warrior soon. If you want to fight with him, the chances of winning are close to zero.”

“I’ve made up my mind.” Lin Xiu nodded and said.

It wasn’t his style to tolerate it when others stepped on him. Also, the former Lin Xiu had already suffered enough.

Back at the dorm, Lin Xiu took out that bottle of medicine from his bag and applied it to his broken hand.

At first, he just wanted to try the effects of it. But to Lin Xiu’s surprise, the medicine was so good that his broken hand began to heal and there was a numbing sensation.
