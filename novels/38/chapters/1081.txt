Chapter 1082: Collapse

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu, who was the first to walk forward, felt that the temperature around him became lower as he walked in.

If it wasn’t for his heart of frost, he really couldn’t stand it at this time.

Whoosh whoosh—

As Lin Xiu walked over, there was also a strange sound from the surrounding ice wall.

Lin Xiu, who has good eyesight, could easily see a large number of small ice crystal snakes charging towards these ice walls.

!!

Seeing this scene in his eyes, Lin Xiu frowned, his thoughts moved, and the source strength covering his whole body instantly transformed into a dark blue flame.

These flames, at this moment, surrounded his body.

When those little ice crystal snakes rushed towards Lin Xiu’s body, they were directly melted by this terrifying hellfire.

Lin Xiu took all the small odd crystals on their bodies.

Lin Xiu has killed more than 100 ice crystal snakes in total.

Although the odd crystals of these ice crystal snakes were very small, they were also at the level of the beast emperor.

The energy contained in it was very powerful.

Lin Xiu collected them all and put them in the expansion space.

“When will I be able to continue to increase this space…”

At this time, Lin Xiu clearly felt that this expansion space was not enough.

There were too many things to store.

This expansion space was originally not that big.

At this time, as Lin Xiu continued to walk out to the other side, a white icy aura continued to emerge from it.

It’s like walking into a freezer where the temperature is terribly low.

Lin Xiu subconsciously unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

This place is very strange. Although he has absolute confidence in his own strength, it is always better to be safe than sorry.

Soon, as Lin Xiu continued to walk in, he realized that there was a huge and wide space in front of him.

What is this place!?

Looking at this huge space, Lin Xiu’s eyes could not help but widen.

Looking around, there are many white skeletons on the surrounding ground!

Some are human skeletons, and some are unknown beast skeletons.

There are so many, scattered all over the ground.

And some beasts and human corpses didn’t rot.

Instead, they seemed to be frozen.

On those corpses, there are quite a few ice crystal snakes slowly biting.

Seeing Lin Xiu walk in, they were about to fly towards Lin Xiu.

But at this moment, he seemed to sense the horror of those flames on Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’. These little ice crystal snakes dispersed and disappeared.

“There is still some life.” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lin Xiu looked at this scene with a look of surprise on his face.

Continuing to walk forward, he found that there were still many battle suits, weapons, and other messes scattered on the ground.

These things look like the warriors who came here before were killed by some terrifying existence.

Frost Dragon is right here?

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu took a deep breath and clenched the dark edge spear in his hand.

“where is this place!?”

At this moment, Elder Gong and others also walked in here.

When some Sage warriors saw this scene, they were shocked.

The space here is very large, and the surrounding ice walls seem to be very flat.

“Skull…”

Some Sage warriors looked at so many bones on the ground, and their eyes were full of surprise.

“These should all be Sage warriors.”

Elder Gong walked in, looked around, and then said.

He just glanced at it and knew that the bones on the ground were all created by the dead Sage warriors.

“This Frost dragon is right here huh…”

The rest of the people said quietly at this time.

They all clenched their weapons now, and the ‘Sphere’ also unfolded.

Under such circumstances, if you are not careful, you will not even know how you died.

Lin Xiu continued to walk forward.

Except for the bones and corpses on the ground, nothing else appeared in this space.

And those tiny ice crystal snakes disappeared.

It should be right here.

Lin Xiu clenched the Dark edge spear in his hand and continued to glance over.

At this moment, he could clearly feel that the surrounding atmosphere was a little weird.

Moreover, according to Lin Xiu’s intuition, the so-called frost scorpion will definitely be here.

“If it doesn’t come out, I’ll make it.”

One of the Sage warriors searched around and couldn’t find it. He snorted coldly, and waved the weapon he was holding in the air!

Boom—

With the volley of the weapon he was holding, his terrifying power was released, and the surrounding ground was bombarded with a large number of cracks.

The entire space began to shake wildly.

“Stop that, this space will collapse!”

A Sage warrior looked at him at this moment and said sharply.

“If we don’t make a move, this frost dragon will continue hiding and wouldn’t come out.”

The Sage warrior, who just waved his weapon, said in a cold voice.

The other Sage warriors didn’t say anything at this time.

Their eyes all looked around. Following the attack by the Sage warriorjust now, a large number of cracks could be clearly seen on the surrounding ground.

It seemed like it was about to collapse.

“Not coming out yet?”

That Sage warrior frowned when the frost dragon didn’t appear even after he made a move.

At this time, the source strength of his body was mobilized again.

All of them gathered towards the weapons in their hands.

“Stop.”

When Elder Gong saw his action, he frowned and said.

“If we don’t destroy this place, this frost dragon will hide and not appear.”

He snorted coldly and continued to speak.

While he was talking, he continued to hold the sword in his hand and swung it in the air.

boom boom boom —

This time, the cracks on the ground were even bigger.

There was a loud noise, and the whole ground sank down.

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

As soon as his thoughts were triggered, his entire body was suspended in the sky, preventing his body from falling.

The same goes for the rest of the sage warriors.

As the top of the ground collapsed, the surrounding bones also all fell.

The ice above his head also fell, hitting the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded, and instantly melted away.

“This… what is this!?”

At this time, the surrounding Sage warriors were suspended in the air. At this time, when they took a closer look at the ground, they found that as the ice on the ground just collapsed, a larger space appeared below.

On the ground below, there were a large number of ice crystal snakes constantly moving.

The number of those ice crystal snakes was too large, and it made one’s hair stand on its end.
