Chapter 236: Fighting Yu Yi Again!

Yu Yi stood up and looked at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu leaped forward at this moment.

Many students were already aware of the battle from the forums.

Someone had leaked the news and attracted countless spectators.

Right at this time, many of the first and second year students stood at a distance to the extent of reaching the 22nd floor!

It was simply a mass of students that could fill the seas and mountains.

“Lin Xiu, you have to win!” Zhang Yin and the others rushed forward and shouted.

There were many people and they had to squeeze in.

“Hmph, this time, I’ll see how long you can bounce around for!” Ouyang Hang commented with an ashen expression on his face.

The events that transpired in G17 ruin had left a shadow in his heart.

He almost died there, under Lin Xiu’s feet!

There was still lingering fear upon recalling that moment.

The venomous rage in his eyes became even denser when he looked at Lin Xiu.

“You’ve grown much stronger.” Yu Yi raised his sword and pointed it at Lin Xiu.

He sensed that Lin Xiu was much stronger than previously when he saw Lin Xiu the day before.

And when he looked carefully again, it felt that Lin Xiu had grown even stronger than the day before.

‘What is going on!?’

‘How is he improving at such a rapid rate?’

Yu Yi began to feel uneasy as he thought about this.

He and Lin Xiu had an enmity and Lin Xiu getting stronger was not beneficial to him.

And because of Ouyang Hang, he had to find a way to cripple Lin Xiu!

He could not let Lin Xiu grow any further!

“Take out what you staked first.” Lin Xiu ignored his words and just glared at him and spoke up indifferently.

Yu Yi laughed when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

He took out a card that was shone with bright light and replied, “It’s here, you can take it if you can beat me.”

With that said, he flicked his finger and the card flew out and landed on the workbench.

“Help me take care of it, thanks.” Yu Yi spoke up to the workers at the workbench.

The workers dressed in Sacred Region Academy uniform nodded their heads.

A few of the people had seen the bets in the Tower of Tournament and did not find it strange.

“Diamond card! He actually bet on a diamond skill card!?” All the students exclaimed out loud when they saw the card.

Diamond skill cards were extremely valuable even in Sacred Region Academy and required a lot of points to exchange for one.

No one expected Yu Yi to take one out as a gamble.

And it looked extremely powerful.

This shocked the spectators even more.

‘Yu Yi must have confidence in winning! Otherwise, he would not take the diamond skill card out.’

‘In that case, this competitor is bound to lose.’

Many of the students thought to themselves.

“Alright, let the game begin.” Yu Yi chuckled but the smile on his face disappeared the next second. His legs erupted with power as he rushed straight at Lin Xiu!

Matched with his body skill, Yu Yi’s speed had reached its fastest speed!

This caused his body to disappear and appear right behind Lin Xiu.

He slashed his sword towards Lin Xiu’s body in an attempt to cut him in half!

Clank-

But Lin Xiu seemed to have eyes growing on his back as Dark Edge suddenly shifted backwards and the spearhead clashed with Yu Yi’s sword directly and produced the loud and crisp sound.

“Interesting.” Yu Yi sneered, although Lin Xiu’s reaction had surprised him, he did not stop and stabbed forward at a faster speed!

Clank clank clank-

Lin Xiu did not attempt to block the attack and used Dark Edge to attack Yu Yi instead!

Lin Xiu used Overlord Spear Art that induced explosions in the air around Dark Edge

Following Lin Xiu’s recovery, Dark Edge was able to produce an extremely large power!

Yu Yi’s sword clashed with Lin Xiu’s spear and he immediately felt his right hand turn numb.

‘What kind of spear art is this!?’

Yu Yi was at a loss. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

He had even requested for the recording of their previous fight the day before.

He had grasped Lin Xiu’s spear art, skills, and fighting patterns.

And Lin Xiu enjoyed dodging and avoiding before retaliating with a powerful attack from behind.

But who would have thought that Lin Xiu would not try to defend and attack him straight off the bat!

His spear art clearly had many flaws and every time the spear was swung, he was able to find flaws to attack.

But since this battle started, he was unable to do so!

It was as though all his attacks were stopped whenever he tried.

This shocked Yu Yi greatly.

“Yu Yi is being… suppressed!?” Everyone was stunned.

Yu Yi’s initial splendor and glamor had become passive defense as though he had no way of retaliating at all.

And on the other hand, Lin Xiu’s spear moved like a dragon and attacked in a frenzy.

He was like an overlord on the battlefield, incomparably brave!

“Lotus Flower First Sword!!!” Yu Yi felt the growing pressure and could no longer tolerate it.

He took the chance between Lin Xiu’s attack and used his own skill!

The sword was immediately filled with source strength and produced many lotus flowers.

When the sword closed in towards Lin Xiu, the lotus flowers blossomed and immediately dropped their petals that shot straight towards Lin Xiu as well!

“Go and die!!!” Yu Yi roared.

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide at this and his pupils immediately constricted.

The skill was extremely powerful and if struck, the consequence was unthinkable!

“What is he doing!? Why isn’t he blocking!?”
