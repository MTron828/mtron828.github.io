1188 Lin Xiu’s Punches

Where did he go?!

The muscular man was still looking around and he suddenly noticed that there was a shadow that appeared behind him.

Boom– –

With a soft groan, the muscular man was pushed far away from the impact of the attack.

However, he managed to steady himself quickly.

“Damn it!”

When he took a good look, there was a punch mark that could be clearly seen on his face.

There was also fresh red blood coming out of his mouth.

He wiped it with his hands and noticed that there was blood on his hands. That’s when a vicious look appeared on his face.

Blood! He was bleeding?!

“Hmm? You have quite a thick skin.”

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s body suddenly appeared where he had landed.

Lin Xiu was indeed quite shocked.

This man’s physical strength was obviously much stronger than the other warriors.

He had already put in all his strength in that punch but he still couldn’t kill this man.

“You!!!! You have pissed me off!!!” The muscular man stared at Lin Xiu as he roared in rage.

At the same time, the entire ground started shaking vigorously.

There was a horrifying energy that came from the body of the muscular man.

There was energy that was continuously being released by the man’s body and there was a bright golden glow.

“I want you dead!”

The man roared once again. Then, with his fist in the air, he aimed it at Lin Xiu!

His fist was covered with a golden energy and as he raised it high into the air, the sound of the air being pierced could be heard throughout the entire arena.

“Be careful!”

When Baili Haoling saw what happened, the look in her eyes changed drastically.

Rollie and Little Bai wanted to fly to Lin Xiu but Baili Haoling stopped them.

Lin Xiu smirked when he saw how the other man wanted to attack him with both fists.

Then, there was a bright, eye-blinding purple glow that appeared around Lin Xiu’s fist.

It was also surrounded by large, horrifying currents!

As the muscular man came forth with his fist, Lin Xin stretched out his arms as well!

Boom!

As the four first collided with each other, there was a loud explosion that occurred.

The rest of the crowd felt as if their eardrums were about to explode.

“AHHHHH!!!!!”

The muscular man roared as he gathered all of the energy in his body onto his fists.

However, even by doing so, he still couldn’t defeat Lin Xiu. Instead, with both their fists colliding with each other, his body was forced to move backwards.

The strong horrifying current was all over the man’s body.

But, the man did not seem to be in pain due to the currents.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frown when he saw what the outcome was.

This man seems to have a certain resistance towards currants.

“Do you think that these current would actually have any effects on me?”

The man let out a cold laugh.

When his fist collided with Lin Xiu’s, the strong and terrifying strength from Lin Xiu caused him to take a few steps back. He was feeling badly humiliated at this point.

“Kill him! Kill him right now!”

At the same time, the audience by the stage started cheering for the muscular man.

“I am going to kill you!!”

The muscular man was motivated by the cheers around him and he went straight for Lin Xiu without hesitation!

He was like a monster in a cage, dying to shred Lin Xiu into pieces.

Lin Xiu didn’t look frightened at all. Seeing how this man was coming at him, Lin Xiu sneered.

If the current was useless, he would use fire then!

With the control of his mind, Lin Xiu’s fists were immediately covered with a dark blue flame.

Before the man pounded on him, Lin Xiu dashed forward first!

He attacked the man with his fists that were covered with dark blue flames!

“You’re dead!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu wasn’t dodging from him and even wanted to attack him, the muscular man got even angrier.

His fist that was covered with a golden glow collided with Lin Xiu’s fists once again!

Boom – –

The dark blue flames instantly melted the boxing gloves that the man had on his hands.

“Ahhhhhh!!!!!”

The man could feel the intense pain and he let out a loud cry.

He could feel that his fist was getting melted by the dark blue flames.

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered as well. He didn’t bother with what the man said and continued attacking his opponent!

The muscular man was shocked to see what was happening. He no longer regarded the pain in his fist and started moving backwards quickly.

He was trying to avoid Lin Xiu’s attacks.

His eyes were now filled with fear.

Lin Xiu had already released the powerful currents. Logically speaking, he should not be able to release the power of any other elements.

But, the truth was not what he had imagined.

When Lin Xiu saw how his opponent was trying to run, Lin Xiu quickly attacked the man with both fists.

His fists were now both covered with a dark blue flame. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Leave!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was still attacking him, he let out a loud roar out of fear.

His body then quickly gathered a large amount of energy and formed a golden coloured ‘sphere’.

Boom boom boom – –

All of Lin Xiu’s attacks landed on the ‘sphere’ that he had just released.

At the same time, Lin Xiu did not stop his attacks just because his opponent had released the ‘sphere’.

His fists were still covered with a dark blue flame as he continued his mad attacks.

The muscular man could feel the strong impact that was coming from the attacks but there was nothing he could do to defend himself.

The only thing that he could do was strengthen his ‘sphere’ with all the energy in his body to block Lin Xiu’s horrifying attacks.

“Let’s see how long you can take this.”

Lin Xiu sneered. Then, he continued attacking the ‘sphere’ like a mad person.

The ‘sphere’ that the muscular man had released soon had cracks on them after being continuously attacked by Lin Xiu.

Boom —-

As Lin Xiu landed his last punch on the ‘sphere’, the indestructible protection that the muscular man had imagined suddenly exploded!

Due to the ‘sphere’ being blasted, the muscular man got the backlash of it and he spat a mouthful of blood.

“Goodbye!”

Lin Xiu sneered and he attacked the man with fists that were covered with dark blue flames.

This time, without the protection of his ‘sphere’, he would definitely be killed if he was attacked by Lin Xiu’s punches!

“Get away from me!!!”

The man’s face was covered with fear. He subconsciously raised his fist hoping to fight Lin Xiu!

It has to be noted that on his boxing glove on his right hand, there was already a hole that melted through it due to the previous collision.

The metals from the boxing gloves that melted seemed stuck onto his skin.

The man had run out of options and could only take Lin Xiu’s hit head-on or else, he would definitely be killed with another hit from Lin Xiu!

Boom !

As expected, as his fist collided with Lin Xiu, there was a loud explosion and there was bright-red blood everywhere inside the ring.
