Chapter 1075: Bai Family, Bai Zhan

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Boom–

With a splash of blood, Zhou Ba was killed by Lin Xiu.

At this time, Lin Xiu also clearly heard the sound of experience-gaining prompts coming from his mind.

After only gaining 2% experience, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but pout.

“Boy you’re courting death!!!”

!!

Seeing that Lin Xiu didn’t give him any face at all and directly killed the warrior, the expression on his face became extremely ugly.

In the next moment, he will pick up the weapon in his hand and attack Lin Xiu!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he sneered, showing no fear at all. He also held a spear and fought with him.

Dang dang-

The speed of the two of them is very fast. At this moment, it seems that two shadows appear, colliding frantically.

When they collided together, they quickly separated, then continued to collide again.

The Sage warriors around didn’t move at all at this time.

Looking at this battle, their eyes were full of surprise.

What surprised them the most was Lin Xiu.

After Lin Xiu went through the battle just now, he still performed so well in the current battle.

Both the speed and the power are amazing.

“Enough, Bai Zhan, what’s the point in bullying the younger generation?”

Just as Lin Xiu and the warrior were fighting, a voice came from the other side.

This Sage warrior looks quite old, with white hair and wrinkles on his skin.

Hearing his words, the figure of the Sage warrior who was fighting with Lin Xiu retreated to the other side and snorted.

Bai Zhan, Bai family?

Hearing the old man’s words, Lin Xiu immediately raised his brows.

“Are you from the Bai family?”

Lin Xiu looked up at him and said aloud.

“Why, did you only know now?”

At this moment, Bai Zhan looked at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

Although he still looks very arrogant, in his heart, he is a little surprised.

At this time, the hand that he was holding the weapon with had a tinge of numbness.

When he just fought against Lin Xiu, he clearly felt Lin Xiu’s strength.

Not weaker than him at all.

“Our purpose on this trip is to kill the Frost Dragon. If we continue to fight in this way, we might be finished even before killing the Frost Dragon.”

At this time, the old man looked at Bai Zhan and said indifferently.

“Elder Gong, I’ll give you a face.”

Bai Zhan glanced at him, then said lightly.

“let’s go.”

Bai Zhan didn’t look at Lin Xiu again at this time and walked straight ahead with several other Sage warriors.

“Young man. Not bad.”

Elder Gong looked at Lin Xiu and said suddenly.

“thanks.”

Lin Xiu clasped his fist at him and said.

He was not afraid of this Bai Zhan at all, he wanted to take the opportunity to kill him.

But Lin Xiu politely thanked the old man for speaking for him.

“It’s not very good to show-off.”

Elder Gong waved and said.

At this time, the surrounding Sage warriors also continued to walk forward.

They wasted a lot of time just now. Now, they should move forward quickly.

At the junction of ice and fire, the Orchid of Heaven will appear.

But where is this so-called junction?

As Lin Xiu walked, he thought to himself.

After continuing to walk forward for an unknown amount of time, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the surrounding environment became even colder.

It was icy and snowy and it looked like a dream.

Lin Xiu, who has a heart of frost, has a very strong resistance to the cold at this time.

Not only did he not feel the cold, but he seemed to have some kind of intimacy with them.

On the other hand, looking at the rest of the warriors, although their battle suits had the function of keeping out the cold, the cold was too intense.

As if it was piercing into their bones.

At this time, they were all directly running their source strength, which was constantly circulating in the body.

Keeping their bodies warm.

Soon, everyone had advanced for dozens of miles, but the surrounding area was still icy and snowy and there was no change.

There was still a vast expanse of white in front of him with no end in sight.

However, at this moment, Lin Xiu heard a ‘click, click’ sound.

Hm!?

Hearing this voice, Lin Xiu immediately raised his brows.

The rest of the Sage warriors seemed to have heard these strange sounds at this time.

“Everyone be careful, there is something.”

Elder Gong stopped at this moment and glanced around.

The rest of the warriors also looked around at this time, but they didn’t see the remaining people at all.

After Lin Xiu looked around, he could clearly see that there seemed to be some cracks on the surrounding ground.

These cracks were very faint, if you don’t pay attention, you can’t see them clearly.

“The ground.”

Lin Xiu said in a faint voice at the same time, his body moved and in the next moment, he jumped directly into the sky.

boom boom boom —

Just as Lin Xiu leaped into the air, there was a loud noise on the surrounding ground. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

All the ice on the ground were cracked!

The reaction ability of those Sage warriors was not slow at all and they all leaped into the air at this time.

Taking a closer look, as the ground cracks, you can clearly see that all the water below is seawater.

A large and long snake-like thing appeared.

The bodies of these things were like ice crystals.

“Frost Dragon!?”

When some warriors saw this scene, they immediately said subconsciously.

“It’s an ice crystal sea snake.”

Elder Gong clearly knew what these were and said lightly at this time.

At this time, Lin Xiu also used the Analytic eye to check and found that it was exactly the same as what Gong Lao said, these things were the ice crystal sea snakes.

Moreover, they were at the level of beast saint.

interesting.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

Lin Xiu also wanted the Beast Saint-level odd crystal now.

He didn’t want to absorb it himself, but wanted to give it to his friends and others.

Boom—

At this time, these ice crystal sea snakes all flew up from the seawater, with their mouths open, some white energy bodies shot out directly from their mouths!

One of the energy directly charged toward Lin Xiu’s body!

Looking at this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly.

The ‘Sphere’ unfolded in an instant.

As the ‘Sphere’ unfolded, all those energies hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

Even with the resistance of ‘Sphere’, this terrifying energy made Lin Xiu’s body fly straight out.

Through the ‘Sphere’, he could clearly feel the terrifying cold air.

“Damn!”

The rest of the warriors looked at the scene around them at this time and the expressions in their eyes changed slightly.

Now they have also discovered that the strength of these ice crystal sea snakes was not weak at all!
