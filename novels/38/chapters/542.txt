Chapter 543: Bathing in The Blood of the Dragon

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

It hurts, it hurts too much.

The fresh blood of the green dragon, coupled with the fact that he had just used fire-type skill in the lake water and caused the entire lake water to boil. It seemed that the lake water had produced some kind of special chemical reaction, which made Lin Xiu feel even more scorching hot.

At this time, a prompt of the experience gained from killing Green Dragon rang in his mind but Lin Xiu didn’t pay much attention to it.

“Damn it, damn it!” Lin Xiu grimaced in pain and in the next moment, he was about to swim to the shore.

Just then, Lin Xiu discovered something very strange.

Because when Lin Xiu wanted to check his attributes, he found that the progress of his experience bar was slowly increasing.

How is this happening!?

Lin Xiu was stunned when he saw this. Could it be that the blood of this green dragon has some kind of special effect on his body?

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then threw the Dark Edge spear on the shore.

Also, Lin Xiu didn’t leave the lake, which was stained red by the blood of Green Dragon.

After the skin on the body was corroded by the blood of the green dragon, a new layer grew at a very fast speed.

Lin Xiu also fell into a strange state at this time. He closed his eyes and immersed himself in the state of running the ‘Cultivation Technique’ and at the same time, he also activated the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’.

At this time, the numbers in the experience column were also turning wildly.

After some time, when Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, he found that his skin seemed to be incomparably white, tender and delicate.

Moreover, Lin Xiu could also feel that his skin was full of vitality.

“The fresh blood of the green dragon seems to have some effect…” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but clicked his tongue secretly when he looked at his body.

Now the lake water was still bright red, but Lin Xiu’s body no longer felt any sensation. The burning sensation from before has completely disappeared.

Oh right…

At this time, Lin Xiu swam over to the corpse of the Green Dragon and with the strength of his hands, he tore its body apart.

Soon, an odd crystal emitting a strange red glow was taken out from its corpse.

This is the rank 8 top-level odd crystal!

Just holding this thing in his hand, he could clearly feel the burning sensation brought by this thing.

Lin Xiu put the odd crystal in his arms and looked around. The bodies of those people were now beginning to emit a stench.

He picked up the Dark Edge spear and walked over to the previous cave.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Xiu vigorously began to slowly remove the stones that were blocking the entrance of the cave.

It didn’t take long for Lin Xiu to come out of the cave again.

“Finally out.” Lin Xiu walked out, stretched and muttered to himself.

He looked around and it seemed like it was dawn.

It’s been a night…

Lin Xiu looked back at the cave behind and couldn’t help but sigh with emotion. Wan Lu and Lao Bai, two top-tier rank 7 warriors died here in the end.

And in the end, he gained from everything.

Crackling-

Lin Xiu stuck the spear on the ground, then stretched out his right hand. As the source strength gathered in the palm of his hand, a lotus fire, dominated by lightning, quickly appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s left hand stretched out at the same time and soon, a flame shaped like a lotus fire appeared on Lin Xiu’s other hand.

Compared with the Thunder Lotus Fire, the Red Lotus Fire was purer, it was completely pure flame and did not contain any attributes.

“If these two energies are brought together…”

At this moment, Lin Xiu did not know why such a thought popped up in his mind. Without thinking much, Lin Xiu began to fold his hands together to let the two lotus fires converge.

The thunder lotus fire was lavender, while the red lotus fire was crimson. After the two lotus fires converge, the colors seem to start to overlap.

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he still found it quite interesting.

But at the next moment, the two lotus fires seemed to become unstable.

Boom—

In the next moment, there was a loud explosion and Lin Xiu flew out, hitting the trees behind him heavily.

With a dull sound, Lin Xiu’s entire body fell to the ground.

“Damn…”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but cursed secretly, then slowly got up, feeling the pain all over his body.

He was just trying it out of curiosity; he didn’t expect such an explosive effect. If Lin Xiu didn’t react faster, he would have been seriously injured. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

After getting up and picking up the Dark Edge spear, Lin Xiu thought about it and continued to walk forward.

He was currently in a black forest and Lin Xiu ran in directly at that time so he didn’t pay attention to the surrounding situation. Now that he looked around, Lin Xiu suddenly felt a little overwhelmed.

He didn’t even know which way to leave.

“Forget it.” After looking around, Lin Xiu shook his head and walked forward in one direction.

Maybe it was because he absorbed the energy of the Thunder Lotus Fire and bathed in the blood of the green dragon. Now Lin Xiu felt very comfortable.

Every part of the body was full of power.

The forest seemed to be endless. Lin Xiu kept walking forward for a long distance, but he did not manage to leave.

Swoosh—

Just as Lin Xiu continued to walk forward, he heard a slight sound.

Lin Xiu raised his brows, the Dark Edge spear in his right hand blocked it and a steel needle shot into the tree trunk beside him.

The expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed and in the next moment, he took the spear and rushed forward!

Under the body skill of ‘Without a Trace’, Lin Xiu was like a trail of shadows and within a blink of an eye, he rushed to the front.

Boom—

The spear slashed diagonally and the giant trees in front were chopped off by Lin Xiu directly.

At this time, he could clearly see a man in black clothes, holding a special bow and crossbow and he was the one who shot him just now.

Hng!

Lin Xiu, who jumped up high, didn’t give him a chance to attack again. A cold light flashed and directly penetrated his head.

Just when he killed this person, Lin Xiu, who had very good listening, heard another sound breaking through the air.

Out of the corner of his eyes, he saw cold lights flashing across!
