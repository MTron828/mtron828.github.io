Chapter 575: Killing Murong

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Following Lin Xiu’s words, the surrounding warriors were shocked.

Those men who attacked Lin Xiu with weapons, but were blocked by Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, all retreated at the same time.

At this time, Lin Xiu slowly stood up with his Dark Edge spear, glanced at the people around him and said lightly.

Junior Brother Lin. When Qu Tingting saw Lin Xiu get up, she also showed a hint of surprise.

I sensed them coming just now. Lin Xiu smiled at her and said.

Although Lin Xiu was in a state of cultivation, Lin Xiu was not defenseless.

When those people came over just now, Lin Xiu had already sensed it.

“You!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu was still not afraid at all, Murong immediately became angry, holding the long sword in his hand and stabbed at Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu still stood there, not panicking at all and the ‘Sphere’ on his body disappeared at this time.

To deal with him, Lin Xiu didn’t need to use ‘Sphere’ at all.

Dang–

Just as the long sword in his hand stabbed Lin Xiu, it was blocked by the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand.

“Die!!!”

Murong had a ferocious face and the long sword in his hand stabbed frantically!

Immediately, shadows of long swords appeared.

“Be careful!”

Qu Tingting said aloud when she saw this scene.

But the next scene shocked her.

Lin Xiu’s body was like shadows, constantly dodging. Although Murong’s attack was fierce, it didn’t hit Lin Xiu at all.

Damn it! Damn it! Damn it! ! !

At this time, Murong frantically continued to attack Lin Xiu with his weapon, but no matter how hard he attacked, he still didn’t even touch the corner of Lin Xiu’s clothes.

Murong was already a little crazy.

“Too weak.” Lin Xiu said lightly while dodging his attack.

“Don’t dodge if you dare!!!”

Murong was now mad with anger and shouted loudly with a ghastly face.

Dang–

In the next moment, Lin Xiu stood there without dodging, the weapon in his hand collided with his long sword and sparks burst out.

Holding the long sword in his right hand, Murong actually felt a sharp pain and his hand began to become numbed.

“Next, it’s my turn to attack.”

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, the spear in his hand instantly stabbed out.

Before Murong could react, he saw a little cold light.

A feeling of death instantly filled his heart.

Dang dang-

However, at this critical moment, he still reacted quickly, holding the long sword in his hand, constantly resisting.

“What are you guys standing there for!”

“Hurry up, kill him quickly!”

Murong kept retreating. The power of the spear that Lin Xiu stabbed was too powerful. Although he held the sword to block Lin Xiu’s attack, he already felt that the hand holding the sword was numb. If he continued, he was afraid that the long sword in his hand would fly out.

At this time, the rest of the people came to their senses and they all attacked Lin Xiu!

Seeing this scene, Qu Tingting was about to help, when Lin Xiu said lightly, “Don’t come here.”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Qu Tingting was stunned for a moment, but at this moment, the people from Murong’s side were already besieging Lin Xiu’s side!

Those people not far away all noticed this at this time.

Some warriors were very familiar with Lin Xiu. After all, today, Lin Xiu was in conflict with Yang Jian.

“Murong and the others are not as easy to deal with as Yang Jian. This kid is about to die.” Some warriors said with a smile as if they were watching a good show when they saw this scene.

“Get lost!” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Lin Xiu swung the Dark Edge spear in both hands and instantly knocked Murong out!

And at this moment, the Dark Edge spear continued to swing.

Boom boom boom-

A large amount of flames were released directly from Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear, instantly forming a trail of flaming birds and charging towards the warriors who were in the surrounding area!

“What is this thing?!” Some warriors were shocked when they saw those flaming birds.

Dozens of flaming birds appeared, instantly casting a layer of fiery red on the surrounding ground.

The surrounding air temperature became extremely hot.

“Ah!!!”

One of the warriors who rushed over to attack Lin Xiu was hit by the flaming bird. The flames covered his body and he burned instantly.

The man wanted to unfold the ‘Sphere’, but there was no way to do it. He turned into a fire man and frantically struggled and rolled on the ground and let out a shrill cry.

Although the rest of the warriors dodged, their faces became extremely ugly when they saw their companions like this.

“Kill him! Otherwise, we will die!”

Murong had already lost his mind. He got up from the ground in a daze, then shouted at Lin Xiu over there.

He has never encountered such a blow since he went to the Sacred Region Academy. Now, looking at Lin Xiu, the hatred in his eyes has grown to the extreme.

Lin Xiu held the spear in his hand and walked towards Murong step by step.

“Lin Xiu, don’t kill him.” Qu Tingting looked at the killing intent in Lin Xiu’s eyes and knew that Lin Xiu wanted to kill Murong.

But this was outside the Tower of Trials. If Lin Xiu killed Murong at this time, he would probably get into a lot of trouble!

And if the Murong family knew...

“Want to kill me!? Hahaha!”

“When I die, your whole family will be buried with you!”

Murong looked at Lin Xiu who was walking towards him step by step. Although he was a little scared, but thinking of his background and identity at this time, how could Lin Xiu, a poor man, dare to touch him?

“Listen to me, I’m from the Murong family, you dare to kill me...”

“You talk too much nonsense.” Before Murong finished speaking, Lin Xiu’s figure flashed in an instant and he appeared directly in front of Murong!

Boom–

The Dark Edge spear stabbed and pierced directly through Murong’s head!

A streak of blood sputtered directly in the air.

They were like plum blossoms.

Murong’s eyes were wide open, his mouth was also open and there was still an unbelievable look in his eyes.

Qu Tingting covered her mouth – she never thought that Lin Xiu would actually kill Murong!

For the rest of the warriors who were watching the show not far away, the smiles on their cheeks were frozen.

Yang Jian and the others, who were hiding in the dark and watching the scene here, were so frightened that their legs became weak.

They originally wanted to watch a good show and see Lin Xiu being taught by Murong, but they never thought that it would end up like this!
