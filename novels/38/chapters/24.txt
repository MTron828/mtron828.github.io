“Does Master wish to activate ‘Rapid Growth’ now?” Just as Lin Xiu was looking at the defensive equipment curiously, another notification popped up.

Lin Xiu was still suspicious, but he decided to go ahead with it.

“Master, please equip the training gear.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

‘Training gear? These things?’ Under his curious impulse, Lin Xiu donned on the bracers, sleeveless garment, and leg guards.

“Equipped, ‘Rapid Growth’ system Activated.”

“Progress 0/10000 (Note: 25 Potential Points to be gained upon completion)”

“25 Potential Points?!” Lin Xiu was startled but became ecstatic. That was 25 Potential Points, almost equivalent to him gaining 12 levels.

But Lin Xiu was curious, how could he increase the progress?

While thinking about it, “Bang”, his entire body fell to the ground.

“Damn it!” Lin Xiu exploded with curse words because he discovered that the original light equipment had suddenly become extremely heavy.

“The bracers are almost 20kg…”

“The sleeveless garment is about 40kg, while the leg guards are around 20kg each, this is killing me.”

After his training, Lin Xiu was almost out of energy, this made him so angry that he wanted to take out the equipment.

“Warning, prohibited from unequipping before completion.”

Right at this time, a cold notification appeared in the system.

Following the notification, a burst of electricity shot out from the equipment and jolted him.

‘Damn the system, it wants to kill me!’

He knew that it would not be that easy to gain 25 Potential Points just like that.

Right, there were other things inside the Gift Pack.

Lin Xiu struggled to search the Gift Pack and took out a card as well as an eccentric herbal medicine.

“Rapid Growth Enlightenment Card?”

Lin Xiu looked at the introduction at the back: Utilising it will increase enlightenment ability, effective duration: 1 day.

What did that mean?

The other medicine was used to treat wounds.

Lin Xiu was stunned but placed both things into his bag.

As he had exhausted himself with training prior, taking a step now was extremely difficult for him. Without a choice, Lin Xiu crawled and rolled before being able to drag him and the spear back to the dorm.

What Lin Xiu was unaware of was that after that night, an inconceivable rumor had spread throughout the dorm: A crawling zombie had appeared at midnight.

Inside Xin Yao Academy’s north campus training ground.

The majority of students were sprinting at high speed while others stood in the center to train themselves or spar.

The entire field was extremely rowdy.

“Round 19…” Lin Xiu felt giddy but persevered.

There was a total weight of approximately 140kg on him. Under such a weight, the burden on his physical body was too huge and Lin Xiu clenched his teeth to run.

For every round, he saw the progress increase by roughly 10 points with the occasional 20 points. It was uncertain.

The current progress was 321/10000, he was still far from success.

“Big brother Lin Xiu!” Right at this time, a voice came out from behind as Lin Xiu felt a smack on his shoulder.

“Bang!” Lin Xiu immediately fell to the ground.

“What are you doing!” Lin Xiu turned and glared behind him, under the heavy stress, the sudden smack on the shoulder had forced him down to the ground.

He turned and saw a beautiful girl who had red eyes seemingly from being shouted at. It looked as though she was about to cry.

“Shuang’er, it’s you?” Lin Xiu was startled when he saw her.

“Sorry, Big Brother Lin Xiu’s mood isn’t that good.” Lin Xiu immediately crawled up and consoled her.

Ye Shuang’er, the daughter of a weapons craftsman that stayed beside Lin Xiu. Due to their proximity, they were familiar with one another.

The young girl in his memory had grown into a slender and elegant woman.

“Hmph!” Ye Shuang’er glared at him before breaking out into a smile.

“Why are you here?” Lin Xiu asked.

He recalled that she was a sophomore.

“It’s almost midterms and our teacher wants to bring us to a few academies to see which one we like.” Ye Shuang’er replied.

“Aren’t you in 2nd year now?” Lin Xiu asked.

“Heheh, I skipped grades!” Ye Shuang’er raised her head and replied proudly.

“So powerful.”

“But of course.”

“What about it, are you prepared to come to Xin Yao academy to play with me?” Lin Xiu smiled and revealed his white teeth.

“So narcissistic, who wants to find you!” Ye Shuang’er punctured his dreams and glared at him as her cheeks turned slightly red.

Ever since Lin Xiu entered senior high, they had not met for a long time.

He had inherited Lin Xiu’s memories and treated Ye Shuang’er as the little sister of his neighbor. They sat side by side on the grass and chatted.

“Are there so many evolved beasts in A20 District?” Hearing Lin Xiu’s account of A20 District, Ye Shuang’er’s eyes revealed excitement and fear.

“I want to go for actual combat training as well…”

“Are you a beginner warrior now?” Lin Xiu laughed and asked.

“Eh, isn’t that Lin Xiu, the one who stayed beside you?” Before Ye Shuang’er could reply, an untimely voice came out.

Tang Ping looked at Lin Xiu with an ugly expression and said; he was Ye Shuang’er’s peer that had come over to take a look at the academy.

Ye Shuang’er was pretty and adorable and naturally had many suitors after her. Tang Ping had previously heard of Ye Shuang’er having a very good older brother. After seeing how Lin Xiu and her were seated so intimately, he became extremely unhappy.

“I heard that Xin Yao Academy’s strongest last place is a person called Lin Xiu…” Another person by Tang Ping’s side spoke up as well.

“Tang Ping, what is the meaning of this!” Before Lin Xiu could speak, Ye Shuang’er fumed with anger as she turned and screamed at Tang Ping and his clique.

“Nothing much, we juniors saw our senior Lin Xiu and felt like having a sparring session.” Tang Ping waved his hand and chuckled.

He had long heard that Lin Xiu was not even comparable to a beginner warrior and was considered trash. Despite being two years ahead, Tang Ping believed he could defeat him easily.
