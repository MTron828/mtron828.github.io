“Lin Xiu? You’re here too?”

When Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen saw Lin Xiu’s figure, surprise appeared in their eyes.

“En, I just arrived not long ago.”

Lin Xiu smiled slightly.

“Phew, the ruins of Tianmen City are too thrilling.”

The two said aloud as they went toward Lin Xiu.

Thinking about everything they had endured before, they were all a little scared.

“I got a lot of good things inside the ‘doors’.”

Lin Xiu said.

“Hey, you also went inside those doors?”

Xiao Qingchen was taken aback for a moment and said subconsciously.

“If my guess is correct, I went through the door three times and got teleported here.”

Yuan Zhen also said thoughtfully at this time.

“That’s right.”

Lin Xiu also nodded slightly.

At this time, another God warrior was teleported here.

The number of people gradually increased.

There were already more than a hundred people!

“You guys probably went in a different passage from me before.”

Lin Xiu continued to speak.

“En, probably.”

Xiao Qingchen also nodded.

They probably chose a different door among the eight channels.

“By the way, I seem to have met someone who is very similar to you.”

Xiao Qingchen seemed to have thought of something, hesitated for a moment, and said aloud.

“Someone who is similar to me?”

Lin Xiu was taken aback.

But then he smiled. In this vast world with so many people, it’s not surprising to come across someone who looks similar to him.

Does it mean they were automatically considered brothers just because they look alike?

“No, not talking about your appearance, but your temperament.”

Xiao Qingchen shook her head.

“It’s a very cold-looking woman. I always feel that she has a certain temperament similar to you.”

Listening to Xiao Qingchen’s words, Lin Xiu’s pupils shrank slightly.

“Where did you see her!”

“Does she use a sword as a weapon?”

“Besides…”

At this moment, Lin Xiu suddenly became excited, grabbed Xiao Qingchen’s shoulder with both hands and said.

Xiao Qingchen was also stupefied at this time, he never expected Lin Xiu would be so excited.

“Sorry, I’m excited.”

At this time, Lin Xiu also looked back, took a deep breath, and put down his hands that were holding Xiao Qingchen.

Luo Yue, he can now be sure that the one they met was 80% likely to be Luo Yue.

“That’s right, she holds a thin-winged long sword as a weapon. Anyway, she has a similar temperament as you.”

Xiao Qingchen didn’t know what to say, so he thought for a while before speaking.

“Then where is she now?”

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s voice was trembling.

“She seems to have gone to those ‘doors’ too, so she should be teleported over later, right?”

Xiao Qingchen said.

“En.”

Lin Xiu clenched his hands tightly, his body still trembling slightly due to excitement.

At the same time, the bald man and other warriors who had just arrived at the ‘door’ that Lin Xiu entered and found Ma Yun dead were also teleported here.

“Damn it, we were teleported away just like that.”

The bald man was obviously very upset.

They entered the same ‘door’ as Lin Xiu and wasted a chance to get good things.

At this moment, their eyes turned to the front and they suddenly found Lin Xiu’s figure.

...

“Damn…”

The bald man looked at Lin Xiu and the look in his eyes changed slightly.

The treasures in the ‘door’ just now must be the best and now they were all in Lin Xiu’s hands, which really made him a little bit annoyed.

He looked around and saw some familiar faces, then a stern look suddenly appeared on his face. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“What exactly are we supposed to do here?”

Yuan Zhen looked around and was extremely curious at this moment.

There were uneven stone walls all around and many stone seats suspended.

There seem to be 99 seats in total.

“I don’t know either.”

Xiao Qingchen looked around, still a little puzzled.

Lin Xiu still looked around.

...

Now the number of warriors sent here has begun to decrease.

But still did not see Luo Yue’s figure.

Luo Yue wouldn’t have…

No, no, with Luo Yue’s strength, behind those ‘doors’, there shouldn’t be much danger.

Just keep waiting.

At this moment, some warriors around started walking toward Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu clearly felt something and the spear in his hand clenched slightly.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen also looked forward and saw about 20 or 30 God warriors gathering here.

Among them was the bald warrior.

“Ma Yun was killed by him.”

The bald man spoke to a tall and strong man next to him.

This man was wearing a well-made battle uniform and he looked extremely imposing.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen looked at this scene and clenched their weapons tightly.

They stared at these warriors, clearly feeling that these warriors had bad intentions.

“It was you who killed MaYun, right?”

The man followed the bald man’s gaze and looked at Lin Xiu.

He stared at Lin Xiu with a strong aura on his face.

“So what.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu also narrowed his eyes slightly.

These people obviously want to come here to find trouble.

“So what?”

The man laughed at this moment, then his smile froze and a powerful murderous aura erupted from his whole body.

“Ma Yun is my cousin. If you killed my cousin, what do you think I, Ma Teng, will do?”

The man who called himself Ma Teng said coldly at this time.

“It seems that they are also your friends, so let’s kill them together.”

At this time, as Ma Teng waved his hand, those warriors around surrounded Lin Xiu and others.

Damn it!

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen gritted their teeth tightly at this time and the weapons in their hands were also clenched tightly at this time.

The strength of these God warriors, although not all of them were particularly strong, there were twenty or thirty of them.

“You guys leave.”

Lin Xiu looked at Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen.

“Do you think we will be so afraid?”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen actually laughed out loud at this time.

“If you want to kill us, then you must be prepared to be killed!”

At this moment, under Ma Teng’s signal, the God warriors around directly attacked Lin Xiu and the others!

At this moment, Lin Xiu let out a cold snort and the golden spear in his hand directly stabbed out!

The expressions in the eyes of some warriors who were rushing over to attack Lin Xiu first changed slightly.

They never expected that Lin Xiu’s speed would be so fast.

Dangdangdang——

The long spear in Lin Xiu’s hand pierced the top of their weapons and loud noises erupted immediately.

Their hands were also painful from the impact.
