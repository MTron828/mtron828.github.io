Chapter 844: War

Huh? This woman looks good, bring her here!”

Sun Shao looked at Luo Yue who was next to Lin Xiu and his eyes lit up.

It was the first time he had seen such a perfect woman.

Sun Shao swallowed.

Those warriors walked directly towards Luo Yue at this time.

“Come with us!”

Those warriors showed a wicked smile, and then they were about to grab Luo Yue.

At that moment, a cold light flashed by.

Their outstretched hands were all cut off neatly!

Blood splattered.

“what!!!”

These warriors couldn’t help wailing.

Luo Yue didn’t know when a long sword appeared in Luo Yue’s hand, and blood was dripping from the long sword.

A very decisive and ruthless woman.

When Sun Shao saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

“Scram.”

Lin Xiu looked at these warriors and said lightly.

At this moment, these warriors flew out directly.

“Take him!!!”

When Sun Shao saw this scene, his face changed greatly, but he still shouted angrily.

At this moment, these warriors all surrounded Lin Xiu.

“Scram.”

Another faint ‘scram’ was heard and those warriors flew out before they approached Lin Xiu.

At this time, Sun Shao’s face became extremely ugly.

His subordinates were all at peak master warrior, and there were even one or two warrior kings.

However, Lin Xiu just said the word ‘scram’ and they flew out.

This is too scary.

How much power does it take to be able to do all this?

Sun Shao was panicking a little at this time, but he still pretended to be very strong on the surface, “Boy, do you know who we are!?”

He turned his eyes to the front, stared at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

“Did he just bully you guys?”

Lin Xiu looked at Liu Pan and said.

At this time, Luo Yan was already hugging Luo Yue excitedly.

“Master! This guy is also from the Sun family!”

An Qi and Qian Lin watched Lin Xiu’s arrival, and while they were excited, they pointed to Sun Shao and said aloud.

“It seems that the people of the Sun family are still like this.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and looked at Sun Shao with faint killing intent in his eyes.

“And now the Sun family seems to be attacking our family...”

Qian Lin said nervously at this time.

His words just fell, and at this moment, there was a loud noise around him.

The whole ground seemed to be shaking.

“The battle started?”

At this time, Liu Pan also opened his eyes wide and said.

“Hahaha, the An family and the Qian family are finished!”

At this moment, Sun Shao said savagely.

“Those who are sensible, kneel on the ground for me now and I might spare your life!”

Sun Shao couldn’t help laughing as he watched the battle start in the distance.

“You talk a lot.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Following his thoughts, in the next moment, a translucent square matrix appeared on Sun Shao’s head.

Directly cover his head.

Sun Shao’s eyes widened, his hands were placed on the square matrix, and he wanted to pull away, but he couldn’t move at all.

“What the hell did you do! Let me go!!!”

With his head stuck in this matrix, Sun Shao yelled with a ghastly face.

He is a member of the Sun family, and he will soon become the only big family in Cangqiong City!

Lin Xiu ignored his words and said to Qian Lin and An Qi, “You guys have improved a lot. It seems that you have cultivated well.”

“Of course!”

An Qi waved her fist and said.

“Master, I heard that you fought with Your Majesty at the beginning, is it true?”

At this time, Qian Lin also spoke out of curiosity.

“Yes, yes, what happened at that time...”

“Don’t talk nonsense, the Sun family has already attacked your family.”

Liu Pan couldn’t help saying aloud when he heard them chattering non-stop.

“By the way, Master, let’s go back quickly!”

An Qi was also agitated at this time, and she said anxiously.

boom boom boom —

On the An family side, a large number of warriors had rushed into the An family and fought with the guards.

Because the Sun family was well prepared, it was a one-sided battle.

“Sun Ba! Don’t you fear that we will let His Majesty know about this!”

The head of the An family, An Jun said angrily, looking at Sun Ba over there in the air.

At this time, Sun Ba glanced at An Jun, waved his right hand, and a terrifying thunder and lightning skill killed a large number of An family’s guards, and suddenly said angrily.

“Do you think that Your Majesty really doesn’t know?”

Sun Ba said coldly to An Jun below.

“What do you mean?”

An Jun’s pupils narrowed slightly.

“Your An family controls the aviation services of the Marqi planet, while the Qian family controls the energy. Your Majesty feels that it is not very reassuring to let you guys do it.”

Sun Ba continued to speak.

“You are talking nonsense! That’s not what Your Majesty meant!”

At this time, An Jun still gritted his teeth and said.

“Humph! I don’t need to explain so much to you.”

Sun Ba said in a cold voice, with a wave of his hand, more warriors from the Sun family rushed in.

At this time, An Ruo was killing those warriors from the Sun family who rushed in. He was slashed by Sun Ba with a thunder and lightning skill, and his body flew out immediately.

“Stop!”

Seeing this scene, An Jun’s eyes turned red and he said angrily.

If things go on like this, the An family will really be exterminated!

“All killed.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Sun Ba, who was suspended in the air, sneered and continued to speak.

“what!!!”

But at this moment, with a loud noise, a wailing sound came.

This time, it wasn’t the wailing from the An family, but the Sun family.

Sun Ba was stunned for a moment. He looked back and saw that all the warriors of the Sun family flew out, slamming into the surroundings heavily, and some of them smashed into a pulp.

“Grandfather!”

An Qi rushed in at this time, looking at the scene, she couldn’t help but feel anxious.

“Run! Don’t come back!”

An Ruo pressed the spear against the ground, slowly propped up his injured body, looked at An Qi who came back, and suddenly shouted angrily.

But when An Ruo looked up and looked in front of him, he found that the Sun family members who had just rushed into his home had all collapsed on the ground.

“An Qi, why are you back?”

Looking at An Qi’s figure, An Jun said anxiously.

“Don’t be afraid, my master is here!” An Qi looked at An Jun, and An Ruo, who was nearby and said.

Master? An Jun was startled.

“By the way, Grandpa, my parents and the others...”

“They’re in the basement, they’re fine.”

An Jun said at this time.

“It’s you...?”

An Ruo looked ahead and saw a familiar man.
