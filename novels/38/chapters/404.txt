Chapter 405: New Competition

At this time, Wan Ling and others were stubborn and reluctant to admit defeat.

While he was speaking, he was also retreating.

The current Lin Xiu was really too strong. With the kind of strength that Lin Xiu had just displayed, even in their entire class went against him, Lin Xiu was likely to win, let alone five of them against him!

Watching them leave, Lin Xiu shook his head, then looked at Li Ping and Zhang Yin who were behind him, and said, “Are you guys all right?”

“We’re fine…” Zhang Yin and Li Ping shook their heads and said.

But the look of pain on their faces betrayed them.

“You guys should go to the medical room.” Lin Xiu said aloud to them.

“Don’t practice today.”

“This…” When Li Ping was stunned and wanted to say something, Lin Xiu continued to say in a firm tone, “Go.”

“Okay.” Li Ping nodded and walked over to the treatment room with Zhang Yin, who was helped by Lei Lei.

“You guys can continue to train.” After watching them leave, Lin Xiu glanced at the other people from class 10, then said aloud.

“Yes!”

“By the way, Jiang Li, aren’t you guys having a friendly match? Why did I hear them say that it was a confrontational match?” Lin Xiu called Jiang Li over at this time, then spoke to him.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Jiang Li nodded, then directly said without hesitation, “It’s a Sacred Region Academy game that started the day before yesterday.”

“It’s just a friendly match, but the people in those classes still fought hard, after all, no one wanted to lose.”

“What are the rules?” Lin Xiu continued to ask when he heard Jiang Li’s answer.

“Each class can challenge the remaining nine classes. Every class fights once and can take the initiative to challenge or wait for others to challenge. The winning team will increase by one point and the points would be totaled after the first day of the next month.”

“The class with the most points would be able to get a very generous reward.”

“I see.” Lin Xiu nodded.

“Then we still have the right to challenge the other eight classes or be challenged by them.”

But this was obviously unfair because Class 1 would be the first place. After all, when they were split into their classes, they were split according to their results.

“You know, this is basically for the victory of Class 1, so we casually called it a ‘friendly match’.” Jiang Li said helplessly.

Under normal circumstances, Class 10 would definitely be at the bottom and the other classes would definitely get points, but no one thought that they would win a match.

Of course, the people in Class 7 were upset, because, in their opinion, the only classes that they could defeat were Class 8, Class 9, and Class 10!

“Well, let’s train first.” Lin Xiu nodded, then patted Jiang Li on the shoulder and said. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“The match is prepared for Class 1 huh… interesting.” Lin Xiu seemed to think of something at this time and his eyes narrowed.

“What evil plan are you hatching, huh.” Just then, a cold voice could be heard.

Lin Xiu came to his senses after hearing this voice, turned around, and saw that Luo Yue was standing next to him, looking at him with a look of contempt.

“Ahem, nothing.” Lin Xiu coughed and said a little embarrassingly.

“Eyes.” Luo Yue said lightly.

“Eyes?” Lin Xiu was taken aback and he looked confused.

“Every time you’re cooking up an evil plan, you will narrow your eyes.” Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu and said lightly.

Lin Xiu was surprised… it seemed that when he’s thinking of attacking someone, he would have this kind of reaction.

“You observe me very closely, huh.” Lin Xiu commented, then seemed to think of something and said, “Have you fallen for me?”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue was startled and the long sword in her hand immediately pierced towards Lin Xiu’s body!

Swish——

The long sword was like a cold glow and it was about to pierce Lin Xiu’s body!

“Damn it!” Lin Xiu reacted at this time and dodged quickly.

But Luo Yue didn’t stop at all and continued attacking Lin Xiu!

The swishes in the air continued to sound.

This girl isn’t playing!

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but curse inwardly but he continued to dodge.

Luo Yue was sensitive and Lin Xiu knew that what he said just now had agitated her.

“They really have a love-hate relationship ah…” Jiang Li looked at the two people from a distance and couldn’t help muttering to himself.

“Okay, okay, I’m wrong, I’m wrong.” Lin Xiu sat on the ground at this time, then said helplessly.

“Hmph!” Seeing Lin Xiu’s pathetic appearance, Luo Yue immediately retracted the long sword in her hand.

“Let’s go to the gravity room to train.” Lin Xiu seemed to think of something, then said to Luo Yue.

“Yeah.” Speaking about training, Luo Yue also became serious at this time.

The two of them walked directly to the front and opened the door of the gravity room.

The training here now didn’t mean much to them. If they wanted to go one step further, they needed to rely on the gravity room to practice.

As soon as he walked in, Lin Xiu put his school card into the machine.

He still had about 100,000 points in his card and now he didn’t need to worry about points.

“How many times?” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue and asked.

“10 times.” Luo Yue hesitated a little, then said indifferently.

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu did not hesitate and directly adjusted the gravity to 10 times.

As soon as he pushed the Enter button on the keyboard, Lin Xiu felt a strong force of gravity.

“Damn!” Lin Xiu felt the strong gravity and he sat on the ground directly.

He was almost flat on the ground and couldn’t get up!

“The squad leader and Luo Yue actually practiced under 10 times the gravity?” At this time, the warriors in the back looked at the word ‘ten’ displayed outside the gravity room and gasped.

“Wan Ling, what shall we do now?” At the same time, those people receiving treatment couldn’t help asking.

What happened today was really embarrassing for them.

Hearing the words of the guy next to him, Wan Ling’s fists were clenched.

“Go to the school forum!”
