Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Boss.

The man saw the door open, and as soon as he said the words, he saw a cold light flash in front of him.

His eyes widened, and before he had time to react, there was an extra blood hole in his head!

“Who is ii

‘When the people inside saw this scene, their expressions changed greatly. They held the laser gun in their hands, and frantically shot towards the door!

Bang bang bang-

But at this time, they could clearly see a dark red ‘Sphere’, resisting all these attacks!

“This is the last…” Lin Xiu walked in step by step with a spear, and then said lightly.

The Skeleton Thieves saw that their laser guns had no effect at this time. In the next moment, they directly threw the laser guns aside, and their bodies immediately unfolded a ‘Sphere’, and pulled out the sword hanging from their waists. Then he rushed straight to Lin Xiu’s side!

“Kill!”

Their faces were fierce, and they attacked Lin Xiu together!

“Haha.” Lin Xiu sneered, the spear in his hand trembled as Lin Xiu’s powerful source strength transmitted throughout.

Humming. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Swoosh—

Before their weapons could hit their ‘Sphere’, the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand had already swept out!

Dang dang-

‘With the sound of a crisp metal collision, in the next moment, they felt an incomparably terrifying force.

The weapons in their hands were all thrown out at this moment.

“Goodbye.”

Lin Xiu said lightly, the long spear in his hand drew a perfect arc, and a trace of blood sputtered out like a plum blossom blooming in the air.

“Don’t kill us, don’t kill us…”

Those pilots, all of them trembling violently at this time, wept bitterly.

“Drive well, I’m not one of them.”

Lin Xiu felt the spaceship shaking as if it had hit some small meteorite.

“Okay…”

Those people were frightened just now, but now they have reacted and hurriedly controlled the spacecraft normally.

“Brother Lin!?”

At this time, Lei Tong and the rest of the warriors came up.

Just now, because the number of Skeleton Thieves was more than twice the number of warriors, there was no way to make a move, but after the situation changed, they also took advantage of the situation to get rid of all the Skeletons Thieves just now.

“En, it’s all settled.”

Lin Xiu stood in the spacious control room, and the ‘Sphere’ on his body disappeared instantly.

Snap-

And at this time, with a crisp sound, a lot of cracks appeared on the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand. In the next moment, it broke and fell to the ground.

“Sorry, your spear is broken.”

Lin Xiu looked back and said to one of the warriors.

“No… it doesn’t matter.”

The warrior opened his eyes wide, with an unbelievable look in his eyes, he secretly swallowed and said aloud.

‘The others were also stunned. This weapon was actually shattered by Lin Xiu.

What a powerful force.

“Brother Lin, tell me honestly, what rank are you?”

Lei Tong widened his eyes, looked at Lin Xiu and said.

The notorious Skeleton Thieves were all dealt with by Lin Xiu.

This strength is truly terrifying.

“En, rank 8.”

Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

“Impossible…”

Lei Tong was a little unconvinced, even with the strength of the eighth rank, he still could not be so perverted…

At this moment, the spaceship shook violently again.

“What happened!?”

At this time, Lin Xiu held the wall beside him and stabilized his body.

The expressions of the rest of the warriors changed greatly. Could it be that it was the Skeleton Thieves again!?

After all, the Skeleton Thieves Group was a huge organization, and those people just now were just the tip of the iceberg.

“No, the spaceship of the Skeleton Thieves that had just been forcibly docked fell off.”

At this time, a pilot calmly controlled the spaceship and said aloud.

Soon, the tremor began to disappear, making everyone heave a sigh of relief.

“How long will it take to get to Marqi planet?”

Lin Xiu continued to speak.

“Not long, we were just delayed a little, and will be there in about seven hours.” A pilot who looked older said aloud at this time.

“En”

“You guys, dispose of those corpses. By the way, there are probably a lot of good things on them, you can take them away.”

At this time, Lin Xiu looked at the warriors behind him and said lightly.

“Okay!”

Those warriors nodded at this time, and then left.

After all, the power that Lin Xiu showed just now was really too powerful; the strong are respected, and they were all willing to listen to Lin Xiu’s words.

Not to mention, there were probably a lot of good things on those skeleton thieves.

Lin Xiu didn’t go to the central hall and was now in the corner of the spaceship.

‘There was a transparent window here, and you could see the starlight constantly passing through the window.

Lin Xiu held a small bottle of wine in his right hand and poured it into his mouth while staring blankly out of the transparent window.

The left hand touched his chest subconsciously and then took out the jade pendant.

Looking at the jade pendant, Lin Xiu’s eyes showed gentleness.

I will definitely come to you.

Although the Luo family refused to tell him where Luo Yue went on this Margi planet, Lin Xiu believed that he would be able to find her.

Looking at the jade pendant that Luo Yue left to her, her thoughts returned to that moment.

Time seemed to have passed for a long time, from being acquaintances to being well acquainted.

“Brother Lin?”

Lei Tong came over at this time, saw the corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up, looked at the jade pendant in his hand with a smile, and said subconsciously.

“Nothing.”

Lin Xiu was stunned and then realized that it was Lei Tong who came over with two bottles of wine in his hand.

“Come on, Brother Lin, let’s drink again.”

Lei Tong smiled and watched Lin Xiu put the jade pendant back into his clothes, but didn’t say anything at this time.

Everyone has their own secrets.

“En”

Lin Xiu took a bottle of spirits in his hand, opened the cap directly, and poured it into his mouth.

The strong wine entered his throat, and a strong burning sensation caused Lin Xiu to cough a few times.

“Haha, Brother Lin, you don’t often drink huh.”

‘When Lei Tong saw this scene, he couldn’t help laughing, and then he took a sip of wine.

“Feels good!”

“Why, were you looking for me?”

Lin Xiu smiled faintly at this time, and then said to Lei Tong..
