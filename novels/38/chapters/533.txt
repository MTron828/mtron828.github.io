“Go!”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes changed, and then he shouted loudly.

At the same time, he subconsciously held Luo Yue’s hand and pulled her to the side to dodge.

Boom boom boom —

At the next moment, with this violent shaking, a terrifying gully appeared on the ground, it was bottomless. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

The ground, which was still intact just now, has now split in two.

And this tremor hasn’t stopped, it was still ongoing.

On the cliffs on both sides, there were still rocks rolling down.

“Let’s go quickly!” Seeing this scene, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed, and his face became serious.

He held Luo Yue’s hand and ran forward.

After running for a long time, the tremor seemed to be getting smaller, but they could still feel a slight tremor.

“Are you done holding?”

Just as Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief, he heard Luo Yue’s voice.

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment and realized that he was still holding Luo Yue’s little hand.

Although Luo Yue often trained and used swords, her hands were still very white and tender like they were weak and boneless.

“Ahem, I was afraid of falling.” Lin Xiu let go of Luo Yue’s little hand at this time and explained.

Looking at the back, Lin Xiu still had a lingering fear when he saw the scene where the ground suddenly split into ravines.

“Be careful.” Luo Yue seemed to think of something at this time, frowned slightly, and said aloud.

“What’s wrong?”

There were many strange rocks in the middle of the road and Luo Yue pulled Lin Xiu to hide behind them.

“There is someone ahead.”

Luo Yue seemed to see that Lin Xiu was puzzled, and then explained to him.

Lin Xiu was stunned. After listening carefully, he seemed to be able to hear something like a fight coming from the front.

Are there warriors ahead?

The two carefully walked forward, and soon, they found a large number of warrior corpses on the ground!

Blood splashed all over the ground.

Taking a closer look, these corpses seemed to be less than a day old.

Could it be that… the space cracks really appeared ahead!?

Continuing to walk forward, at a corner in front, a black shadow rushed out in an instant!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank abruptly, and he found that a cold light flashed in front of his eyes, and a streak of blood spurted out.

“What is this?” Lin Xiu was startled and saw a creature with a dark body and a strange shape.

This thing was cut in half by Luo Yue’s sword just now.

“A creature that doesn’t belong to our world.” Luo Yue glanced at the creature’s corpse and then said lightly.

“So, this space crack is really ahead!”

Lin Xiu also reacted quickly and then said with a little surprise.

This kind of monster was clearly a monster from a different dimension so it meant that the space crack must be in front!

“Hahaha, Lao Bai, I didn’t expect your people to come here too.” At the same time, Wan Lu, who was in the gymnasium at the entrance of the Thunder Valley, laughed at the people on the opposite side.

Behind him, there were quite a few warriors, and upon closer inspection, they were all rank 6 ones.

“Wan Lu, let me tell you, this Thunder Lotus Fire, we are going to have it for sure.” Lao Bai pointed at Wan Lu with the giant sword in his hand and said coldly.

Behind him, there was a large number of warriors.

Looking into the air, it seemed like a black hole had opened.

At this time, black creatures rushed out from the space crack, but Lao Bai waved his hand, and a terrifying sword aura instantly killed those evolved beasts from different dimensions.

On the ground below, there were also a lot of strange dark red rocks. It was obvious that they all fell from the space crack.

On the rock in the middle, there was a lotus-like energy body that emitted a lavender light. This energy slowly shook with the wind, like a special flame.

There were also faint lightning flashes above.

“This is a thunder-type energy body!?” Lin Xiu was hiding behind a rock like that in the distance at this time, but Lin Xiu, who had great eyesight, saw that lightning bolt.

“En.” Luo Yue nodded at this time.

“The chance of this kind of energy body appearing is very low.”

Lin Xiu nodded. He had checked the relevant information on the website of the Warrior Union. When a space crack appeared, the probability of an energy body from a different dimension appearing was very low.

No wonder so many warriors died here, it seemed that all of them want to compete for this Thunder Lotus Fire.

“This thing should be useful to you.” Luo Yue seemed to have thought of something and then said to Lin Xiu seriously.

“En.”

As long as you absorb the power of this thunder lotus fire, the power you use to convert the source strength into thunder and lightning would become more powerful.

However, these two are top-level rank 7 warriors, and there were so many rank 6 warriors behind them. It was not easy to grab this energy.

What should we do now?

They could only wait for an opportunity.

“Are you sure you want to fight with me? Why don’t you make an offer and I’ll buy it?” Wan Lu looked at the Lao Bai and said aloud.

If this energy body was not slowly absorbed under certain circumstances, rushing to grab it would be life-threatening.

“What a joke, would you sell it if I gave you union coins?” Lao Bai immediately laughed when he heard Wan Lu’s words.

The probability of an energy body appearing in this space crack was only one percent, and the preciousness of this energy body couldn’t be measured by money.

Especially for warriors.

“It seems that I can only…”

“Kill you!” Wan Lu’s eyes changed at this moment, and a strong murderous aura erupted from his body.

Then he rushed straight towards Lao Bai!

The speed was astonishing, as if in a split second, he reached the front of Lao Bai!

He leaped and his fist was about to hit Lao Bai’s body!

He didn’t use a weapon, as long as he wore the gloves, it was clear that he was a warrior who mainly focused on boxing.

Boom–

Lao Bai sneered, and the giant sword in his hand resisted the attack of his punch.

“Go away!” And in the next moment, he was going to slash his body with the huge sword!

The two people exchanged blows and they fought fiercely in the middle.

The men and horses of the two people also fought against each other at this time.

A large number of rank 6 warriors unfolded their ‘Spheres’ and their weapons collided.

The whole scene was very shocking.

Lin Xiu, who was hiding behind a huge rock not far away, stared at the scene in front of him.

Opportunity, find a good opportunity!
