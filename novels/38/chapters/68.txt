Chapter 69: Advanced Application Of Source Strength – Sphere!

Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief when he heard the referee calling his victory.

The aftereffects and fatigue came in after Fury state ended. Five minutes of fatigue made Lin Xiu almost fall to the ground.

He quickly used his spear to stabilize himself.

“Go and die!”

Right at this time, Lin Xiu suddenly heard a growl. He turned and saw Ye Gulin throw a small and black spherical object towards him.

“Move away!” The referee’s eyes constricted when he saw the object and roared out loud.

The teachers and observers at the stands all had a change in expression. Before they could even make a move, Mr. Ye took action.

He smacked the stage and flew out.

Sou-

He was like a shadow that charged towards the stage at a speed invisible to the naked eye.

Boom-

A loud explosion came out and the entire space shook. The students closest to the explosion were all flung away. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The entire stage shattered.

“You’re dead, you’re dead.” Ye Gulin laughed like a maniac inside the dense fog of dust.

M12 Grenade was a type of micro-bomb but had extremely potent explosives within. Not only was this extremely ugly, but it was also impossible to purchase in the cities.

Ye Gulin’s clothes became extremely shabby from the explosion and he sustained many wounds on himself as blood stained his entire body.

“Call the paramedics!!!”

The people around were all beginner warriors or quasi-warriors and extremely weak. Many of the students were severely injured.

Ye Gulin stared at the figure in front of him. As the dense cloud of dust dissipated, Lin Xiu remained in his position without harm to him.

“Young man, you’ve gone too far.” Mr. Ye stood in position and glared at Ye Gulin.

When one observed carefully, they would notice that the space around Mr. Ye with him at the center was hazy. But no one could see the defensive barrier.

It was an advanced application of source strength – Sphere!

Ordinarily, Rank 1 to 3 warriors would begin cultivation with bronze and silver skills. Rank 4 to 6 warriors could cultivate body skills. Above the rank of 6, the source strength in the body would have reached a degree that it could be unleashed externally and form a circular barrier and block various attacks.

“You…” Ye Gulin’s eyes widened when he saw that. He was no fool and could clearly see that the man before him was definitely a warrior of rank 6 or above!

As he was already injured, he coughed out blood, and under the sudden mental hit, he fainted and fell right to the ground.

“Are you alright?” Mr. Ye turned and asked Lin Xiu.

“I’m fine.” Lin Xiu shook his head, he was still afraid. If not for the sudden appearance of the man, he would have either died or be severely injured.

Mr. Ye nodded his head and revealed a smile. “I’m optimistic about you.”

He clasped Lin Xiu’s shoulder and when Lin Xiu was still in a daze, he exerted a force from his legs and returned back to the stands.

“Medic! Medic!” Zhang Lin roared out loud when he saw Ye Gulin on the floor.

He did not expect Ye Gulin to be forced to such a state.

But Lin Xiu was still alive! The worst thing was that he did not know how to account for it to the Tang Family.

“This isn’t your matter, I will take care of him personally.” Right at this time, Tang Tian appeared behind Zhang Lin and said indifferently.

“Mr. Ye, are you alright?” The teachers at the stands turned and asked Mr. Ye anxiously.

“Instead of asking whether I’m fine, why not check on your students?” Mr. Ye looked at all the teachers and chuckled coldly.

The teachers around started to perspire in cold sweat when they heard his words. They immediately became extremely respectful. “You’re saying, you’re saying…”

“Lin Xiu, how are you? Do you need to head to the infirmary?” Luo Li saw Lin Xiu walking over from the shattered stage and asked.

“No need.” Lin Xiu shook his head. The fatigue was there but he would most probably have to head to the next battle soon.

“Due to unique circumstances, the next battles will be delayed!”

Right at this time, an announcement led Lin Xiu to heave a sigh of relief. This meant that he had time to relax.

Ye Gulin’s actions had caused too large a hoorah, injuring almost a few hundred students.

“Damn it, that scared the hell out of me. Who would have thought that Ye Gulin would actually utilize a bomb? What Xing Yao’s Tiger, he is just a despicable person!” Yang Tian walked over and patted his own chest.

His heart was still beating hard, if not for him failing to squeeze through the crowd to the front, he would have been hurt as well.

The situation was still in a mess.

“The next round of battles will be delayed to the afternoon, have some rest first.” Luo Li saw how tired Lin Xiu was and supported him to the side.

“Right, who was that just now?” Lin Xiu then recalled the old man that had appeared in front of him and used a barrier made out of source strength to deflect the explosion for him.

“Mr. Ye?” Upon talking about the man, Luo Li’s voice became a whisper.

“He is an advisor from one of the famous schools. He has been here for a while already and saw your previous battle.”

“Famous school?”

“I’m not too sure where he is from, he should be an advisor from one of the great five.” Luo Li thought for a bit before replying.

Luo Li did not have knowledge pertaining to the visitors from the schools, but from the reaction from the school leaders at the stands, Mr. Ye was definitely not a small character.

As Lin Xiu laid inside the resting area, he recalled the scene from before.

‘That was the strength of a high-rank warrior… That boundless source strength, it’s still affecting me.’

‘I have too few skills in my system. Aside from the Awe of the Phoenix, I only have Torrential storm of rose flowers that I’ve used too many times. Cautious people will know how to defend against them.’

‘If only I drew a spear skill.’

He shook his head and entered the system draw page again. This time, the things on the lottery wheel surprised him.
