They completely recovered at this time, their limbs were back, it was because of Lin Xiu!

While shocked by Lin Xiu’s strength, they were also full of gratitude toward Lin Xiu.

It was Lin Xiu who saved them!

“Glad that you guys are fine.”

Lin Xiu waved his hands, panting.

This ‘Time Control’ skill was really exhausting.

“Lin Xiu, do you want to take a break?”

Baili Haoling said aloud at this time.

At this time, Lin Xiu was really haggard. After fighting Liu Mo previously, he didn’t even look so pale.

“Ok.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly and when he was about to move, he felt a little dizzy. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

boom–

Just when Lin Xiu was about to fall backward, he felt as if there was something behind him to lean on.

“Rollie…”

Lin Xiu felt the furry feeling on his back, which was obviously Rollie.

And a faint white light was released from Rollie’s body.

Soon, Lin Xiu felt this extremely comfortable feeling.

warmth.

Lin Xiu closed his eyes and soon, leaning on his Rollie body, he half-sat on the ground and slowly fell asleep.

Looking at this scene, Baili Haoling was surprised.

What are these white rays of light released from Rollie’s body?

Before Baili Haoling got close to this white light, she could faintly feel that it brought a strange sense of comfort.

Looking at the tired Lin Xiu, Baili Haoling didn’t speak anymore.

Time passed quickly.

Lin Xiu didn’t know how long he had slept.

On this day, he tried his best to open his eyelids and slowly opened his eyes.

A dazzling light came into his eyes, causing Lin Xiu to narrow his eyes slightly.

After slowly getting used to the bright light, Lin Xiu fully opened his eyes.

“Hu…”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, feeling a little sore. Looking carefully, he was lying on a bed.

Kala Kala——

After the body moved a bit, there was a sound of joints cracking.

Comfortable!

Lin Xiu stood up completely and stretched.

It’s comfortable, it’s really comfortable.

He hasn’t been this comfortable for a long time.

Oh right…

Now that Lin Xiu came back to his senses, he remembered what happened before.

He fell asleep after using the ‘Time Control’ skill.

“How long have I been asleep…”

Lin Xiu said to himself and walked out the door.

Huh?

After walking out the door, Lin Xiu found that his originally destroyed City Lord’s Mansion had been completely repaired now!

It’s almost exactly the same as the original one. If it wasn’t for Lin Xiu’s sharp eyes, he almost thought it hadn’t been destroyed.

“Lin Xiu? Are you awake?”

At this moment, a familiar voice came from the other side.

If you look closely, you can clearly see the figure of Baili Haoling.

“How long did I sleep for?”

Seeing Baili Haoling walking over, Lin Xiu smiled and said.

He remembered that not only the surrounding buildings were destroyed, but even the ground had a lot of pits and cracks.

But now the ground has already been repaired and a floor has also been laid.

He knew it must have been a long time.

“Ten days.”

Baili Haoling said.

...

Seeing that Lin Xiu seemed to be fine now, Baili Haoling couldn’t help but heaved a sigh of relief.

“Ten days have passed…”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

“City Lord!”

At this time, Mr. Pang and Lei Tong walked over from behind excitedly.

During Lin Xiu’s deep sleep, the City Lord’s Mansion has been completely restored.

And the energy barrier has been repaired. Looking into the sky, he could clearly see the energy barrier unfolding.

The energy core driven into the ground has not been destroyed, so it was still very simple to deploy the energy barrier again.

And Lingxian City has many underground refuge rooms. Although Liu Cheng destroyed the buildings of Lingxian City that day, many warriors still survived.

The entire Lingxian City was currently undergoing reconstruction.

And the reconstruction this time was based on the latest technology brought by Lei Tong.

...

Once it is fully constructed, this Lingxian city will be even stronger than before.

“Not bad.”

Lin Xiu nodded in satisfaction after listening to Mr. Pang and Lei Tong’s report.

This time, it was a blessing in disguise.

And Lin Xiu felt that he had become stronger.

He was able to use the dark power hidden in his body.

“By the way, where is Rollie?”

Lin Xiu saw Xiaobai hovering around here, but the billowing figure seemed to have disappeared.

“Rollie…”

Speaking of Rollie, Baili Haoling showed a strange look on his face.

“What’s wrong?”

Lin Xiu was taken aback.

In the next moment, with Baili Haoling leading the way, he could clearly see the current Rollie.

“This…”

Rollie is in the yard on the other side, but there were a lot of white silk threads on Rollie’s body. These thousands of silk threads wrap Rollie, making Rollie seem to be wrapped in a pupa.

“Not long after you fell into a deep sleep that day, Rollie became this way.”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s surprised expression, Baili Haoling spread her hands helplessly and said.

“It’s like a pupa. Could it be turning into a butterfly?”

Lin Xiu said with his eyes wide open.

“Maybe it’s about to evole.”

Baili Haoling thought for a while, then said.

“It’s very likely.”

Lin Xiu also nodded in agreement.

Rollie also devoured that god-level big white tiger before, so it probably hadn’t completely digested it back then.

“I don’t know what Rollie will become…”

Lin Xiu looked at this scene and said to himself.

“By the way, Mr. Pang, have you integrated Changqing City and Shachang City?”

Lin Xiu seemed to think of something at this time, then said to Mr. Pang behind him.

Lei Tong was still in charge of rebuilding Lingxian City and has already went off first.

“City lord, the integration work has already been carried out, but…”

Speaking of this, Mr. Pang hesitated for a moment.

“Speak freely.”

Lin Xiu frowned and said directly.

“The guide said that our Lingxian City cannot take over the power of Changqing City and Shachang City.”

Mr. Pang continued to speak out.

“The guide huh?”

At this moment, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

“If I remember correctly, the guide has the same name as you, he’s also called Mr. Pang.”
