Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Dead, Ning Tianluo, the city lord of Baidi City, just died like that.

“Hu—”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu took a deep breath, then his body was about to fall from the sky.

The surrounding matrix also disappeared instantly at this moment.

boom–

Lin Xiu’s body fell heavily on the ground below.

pfft—

A mouthful of blood was immediately spit out.

The time for ‘Fury’ was up.

Damn, I forgot the time. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Master!”

And Sima Qiang and Zhao Yongyou also ran over at this time.

“I’m fine, just a little tired.”

Lin Xiu looked at them running over and said aloud.

Zhao Yongyong and Sima Qiang heaved a sigh of relief when they saw that Lin Xiu did not seem to have suffered much damage.

“Now, go over there and help first.”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

Once Ning Tianluo died, the other warriors in the City Lord council should not be able to fight back.

Furthermore, there were alien beasts that he summoned and the existence of artificial angel.

Defeating Baidi City was a matter of time.

Zhao Yongyong and Sima Qiang nodded when they heard Lin Xiu’s words.

At this time, they also rushed to the area where they were fighting on the other side.

The alien beast summoned also followed them there.

boom boom boom —

There was a loud explosion sound around.

Obviously, the battle was not over yet.

But the Sage warriors here were almost wiped out by Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was lying here at this time, because of the aftereffects of his rage, his body could not move at all during this short period of time.

But because of his strong body, Lin Xiu was not afraid that someone would attack him at this time.

Because their attacks couldn’t do much damage to him at all.

Time went by and Lin Xiu’s power quickly recovered at this time.

Soon, Lin Xiu, who was lying on the ground, slowly got up.

“It’s time to wrap up.”

Lin Xiu stretched a little and when his thoughts were triggered, his body flew directly into the sky.

Looking at the warriors of the Baidi City who were still frantically defending against the attack, Lin Xiu snorted coldly.

At this moment, the Dark edge spear in his hand was swung.

boom boom boom —

As the spear was swung, a loud sound suddenly sounded.

Thousands of huge flaming birds burst out directly from Lin Xiu’s Dark edge spear.

Towards those warriors in the Baidi City, he charged over!

“what is this!?”

The warriors of the City Lord’s Mansion of Baidi City were still fighting with the warriors brought by Sima Qiang and others. At this time, their expressions changed greatly when they saw the flaming birds charging from behind.

Although they have already unfolded their ‘Sphere’, under the impact of the flaming birds, their ‘Sphere’ was directly burned and melted!

Those flames burned their bodies in an instant.

“what!!!”

With the constant screams coming, the bodies of these Sage warriors all fell from the sky.

“Master!?”

Wang Qiang, who was in the middle of the battle, looked at everything in the sky and said in surprise.

only Lin Xiu’s skill can release these flaming birds.

“kill!!!”

And at this time, Sima Qiang and Zhao Yongyou continued to lead the rest of the warriors to fight frantically.

At this time, the artificial angel was also frantically waving the spear in her hand, frantically attacking the warriors.

Every time she waved the spear in her hand, a warrior fell.

“It’s over.”

Lin Xiu’s figure was in the air. After watching all the warriors who resisted being killed, he said to himself.

The remaining Sage warriors of the Bai family hasn’t came over yet, but it didn’t matter anymore.

Baidi City has already been captured.

Of course, this is only the first step.

Three days later, the City Lord council.

“Master, everything has been arranged.”

Sima Qiang said to Lin Xiu at this time.

In the past three days, the original forces in Baidi City have been cleaned up and the Bai family, which occupies a huge area, has also been rebuilt into a training base.

As a place to train warriors.

After all, this battle has just begun.

The next step is to attack the Holy City.

The real core of the Bai family was there.

Now the Bai family in Baidi City is only one of the largest branches of the Bai family.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded, then looked at the lobby, where many people were already standing.

However, only Sima Qiang and Zhao Yongyuan were at the Sage warrior level.

Wu Jie, Wang Qiang and the others were all at the level of Respected warrior only.

At that time, Zhao Qi, the head of the Zhao family in Aoshuang City, had a very surprised expression on his face.

He had no idea that Lin Xiu had grown to this level.

Of course, he was now very grateful for his choice.

“If I guess correctly, the real Bai family in the holy city should know what’s going on here soon.”

Lin Xiu looked at the crowd at this time, then said lightly.

Although the news here was almost completely blocked, it would still be detected eventually.

At that time, they would probably send people over.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words at this time, the expressions of everyone around became a little heavy.

“Wu Hao, has that energy barrier been built?”

At this time, Lin Xiu looked at Wu Hao and said aloud.

This time, Wu Hao also helped a lot. He mobilized many aircraft built by his group to support him.

There were also many heavy weapons.

“almost.”

Wu Hao nodded and said.

After this energy barrier is built, it will be able to expand and surround the entire Baidi City. At that time, the warriors outside will not be able to break through it so easily.

Even the Sage warrior-level warriors.

“I’m sorry to trouble you this time.”

Lin Xiu nodded.

“What’s the trouble, now you are the real controller of the Wu group, I’m just helping you manage it.”

Wu Hao laughed boldly at this time.

Because Lin Xiu helped him find Angel’s Tears, his wife is finally awake now.

He looked radiant at this time.

“By the way, during this period of time, I want to help you guys quickly increase your strength to the Sage warrior level.”

Lin Xiu looked at everyone at this time and said aloud.

Sage warrior level!?

When Wang Qiang and the others heard Lin Xiu’s words, their eyes were filled with surprise.

You must know that it is not so easy for Respected warriors to cross over to Sage warrior.

Unless you have powerful and extremely high energy odd crystals to absorb.

“Uncle Ye, share these with them.”
