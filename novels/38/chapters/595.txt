Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

And now, if you looked closely, the rays of light on the tower body of the Tower of Trials began to slowly dim at this time.

Students who were in the challenges were all sent out.

“It seems that he succeeded.” Dean Baili stood up, looked at the Tower of Trials from a distance through the floor-to-ceiling windows of his office, stroked his beard and said with a sigh.

Is this a good thing...

“Hey, these books...”

When Lin Xiu walked out of the library at this time, he found that everything around him seemed to disappear quickly at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.

Those bookshelves and books seemed to have never appeared before.

“Everything is an illusion.”

Ye Kai looked at the ceiling, as if thinking about something.

“What exactly is going on!?”

Many students had gathered at the bottom of the Tower of Trials and they were very puzzled about what happened.

Because there seemed to be no energy supply in the Tower of Trials and all those who were in challenges had been teleported out.

The projection screen displaying the challenge data also disappeared instantly.

“Phew, I’m finally out.” At the same time, Lin Xiu’s figure also came out of the tower of trials.

He didn’t even know what time it was...

Lin Xiu touched his thick beard and couldn’t help but let out a wry smile.

Ye Kai has already left the place. His mission here has been completed and he has also checked that there were people from Namir coming to earth and now he was going to conduct a thorough investigation. He had already left the Sacred Region Academy.

Lin Xiu also found out Ye Kai’s strength and he was also a rank 9 warrior.

They contact via email. If Lin Xiu needed something, he would appear at any time.

“Lin Xiu?”

As soon as Lin Xiu walked out, he heard a familiar voice.

Turning around and looking back, she saw Qu Tingting walking over.

Seeing her, Lin Xiu smiled, then said aloud, “Senior.”

“Eh? Why do you have a beard?” Qu Tingting asked out of curiosity when she saw the dark circle of beard that Lin Xiu had grown.

“What’s the date?”

Lin Xiu didn’t say anything at this time but asked her.

“14th, what’s wrong?” Qu Tingting said subconsciously.

14号?

14th?

So little time passed when he was on the top floor?

Lin Xiu thought that at least a month had passed!

Thinking of what Ye Kai said before, the time there was different from the outside and Lin Xiu was even more shocked. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Did you succeed in your challenge?”

Qu Tingting said very curiously. When Lin Xiu reached the 94th floor, many people were shocked, even Qu Tingting was no exception.

“Ay, even if I succeeded, it’s useless. I don’t know why but suddenly all the power sources are gone in this tower of trials and now everyone is forcibly teleported out.”

Before Lin Xiu could speak, Qu Tingting mumbled to herself.

“But it doesn’t matter. You have completed so many levels. When you collect the rewards, you will definitely have a lot of challenge cards and you can continue later.”

Qu Tingting said a little excitedly at this time.

Because apart from the legend that someone succeeded in the challenge eight or nine years ago, no one has ever succeeded in the challenge!

How could she be unhappy that she could witness a miracle?

“No, I won’t challenge again.”

Lin Xiu said with a smile at this time.

“Why?”

“No reason.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

He had already been to the top floor and because he had absorbed all the energy, the devices on the top floor were also automatically destroyed. The current tower of trials was no longer the original tower of trials.

Perhaps in the future, Dean Baili could still get someone to repair it but it was impossible for it to be the same as before.

“I’m leaving, senior, goodbye.”

Lin Xiu waved his hand and said to Qu Tingting.

The next moment, Lin Xiu left the place without looking back.

Qu Tingting looked at Lin Xiu’s back in a daze, she had a feeling that the name Lin Xiu would definitely shock the whole world in the future!

“You came out?”

Not long after Lin Xiu left, Dean Baili appeared in front of him.

He looked at Lin Xiu and said with a smile.

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu nodded.

“I didn’t expect that you actually did what none of us could.” Dean Baili looked at Lin Xiu with a hint of envy in his eyes, but he was more surprised by Lin Xiu’s performance.

“It’s just a fluke.” Lin Xiu said with a smile.

If he didn’t have his own system skills, he probably wouldn’t have the chance to communicate with the old man.

And what happened after that would not have happened.

Now Lin Xiu felt that his whole body was full of power.

“However, you have to be careful.” Dean Baili’s eyes became serious at this time and he said to Lin Xiu.

“Why?” Seeing Dean Baili’s serious expression, Lin Xiu also said a little curiously.

“You know, there are five people who founded the Sacred Region Academy, right?”

Dean Baili looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“En, I know that.”

Lin Xiu nodded. He knew about what Dean Baili said.

“Besides me, you should have met Xia Xing as well.”

“I’ve met him before.” Of course Lin Xiu remembered that wretched old man and his strength was also very strong.

“There are the remaining three, namely Nangong Yan, He Yan and Qian Feifan.”

“Except for Nangong Yan who had disappeared for several years, the other two people, would be after you once they find out that you have obtained this inheritance.”

At this time, Dean Baili said seriously.

“They will know?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows and asked back.

“Do you think that nobody will find out that the current tower of trials has become like this?” Dean Baili smiled, then said as if talking to himself.

“There’ll be a way.” Lin Xiu smiled, a little disapproving.

“You kid.” Dean Baili couldn’t help showing a smile when he saw Lin Xiu so confident.

But now he really felt Lin Xiu’s power, it seemed to be much stronger.

It was as if Lin Xiu was completely different from the previous Lin Xiu.

“Tomorrow will be the selection of the warrior conference. If Luo Yue is not here, I will let someone fill her position. You should know that person.”

Dean Baili touched his beard and said.

“Who?”

I know that person? Lin Xiu thought.

“Wait until tomorrow, you’ll know when you see her..” Dean Baili said meaningfully.
