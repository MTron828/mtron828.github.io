Chapter 65: Activate, Synthesis System!

“Silver skill card?”

Lin Xiu was stunned as he took the skill card. After taking a look at it, it was actually a blade skill and made him completely disappointed.

How fraudulent! Lin Xiu’s mouth started to twitch.

“Ding~~~”

“Synthesis System activated.”

Right at this time, the system notification rang out in his head.

‘Synthesis System?’

Lin Xiu was startled and quickly entered the system to discover a new window pop up.

“Use three same grade cards to merge into a corresponding weapon skill.”

He read the note and was stunned for a moment before becoming pleasantly surprised.

It meant that by using three same-grade skill cards, he could merge them into a spear skill card, right?

This meant that he could purchase two cheap silver cards and proceed with the synthesis.

Lin Xiu realized that the skills from the system were different from the world and were unique and unmatched.

For example the Awe of the Phoenix. This was a skill card that had no information even on the web.

Forget it, I’ll keep it first. I have plenty of other draws in the future and can try my luck again.

After keeping the silver card, Lin Xiu went to bed.

It was so hard for him to find the opportunity to lie on a soft bed and he quickly fell into a deep slumber.

Right at this time, a photo started to spread across the web like wildfire.

“Transforming type android from the mech era! How can there be such a perfect set?!”

“It must be fake.”

“Where did they capture this photo?”

A few people well versed with the mech era became excited when they saw the photo.

The photo revealed an android wolf. Although there were various corroded parts, it was undoubtedly a well-preserved set.

A few meticulous people even investigated and realized that the location of the photo resembled Xin Yao Academy.

The sleeping Lin Xiu was completely unaware that trouble was heading his way.

Time passed and day two came. Although 90% of the students were eliminated the day before, many students still gathered in the field.

All of the students that got to the next round were experts of the academy. To watch experts spar was also useful to the other warriors.

“Lin Xiu, be careful. That person isn’t easy.” Luo Li saw Lin Xiu approaching and beckoned to him, then warned him as he inched closer.

Lin Xiu nodded and his gaze shifted to the other side.

The battles were designated to start as early as 9 in the morning and it was about time.

The 50 students were segregated into 25 competition stages and started preparing, while Lin Xiu and the other students were placed in the second batch to go up stage.

“Gulin, we will have to depend on you.” At a certain location, Zhan Lin patted Ye Gulin’s shoulder and said to him.

“No problem.” Ye Gulin was a tall and sturdy man that had a buzz cut and his eyes were brimming with bloodthirst.

Even Zhang Lin could not help but gulp down secretly. But upon thinking about the aftermath, he could not help but smile again.

Lin Xiu has to die!

And the battle began! Many students got as close to the stage as possible and supported their favorite participants.

“You’re from Class 29?”! Tang Tian glared at Zhang Yi and asked.

“That’s right.” Zhang Yi held a blade, glared at Tang Tian cautiously, and replied.

“Although you are very strong, I won’t admit defeat.”

“Is that so.” Tang Tian sneered. Whenever it came to Class 29, he would be reminded of Lin Xiu and clench his fists.

Zhang Yi frowned. Tang Tian did not even carry a weapon. He was obviously looking down on him.

He clenched his teeth and carried his blade to charge forward and slashed down at Tang Tian.

Tang Tian snorted and dodged when the blade was about to touch his body.

Crack-

He used his right arm to sweep the blade aside before grabbing Zhang Yi’s arm. He exerted force to twist his arm up.

Clang-

Zhang Yi’s blade dropped to the ground.

“AHH!!!!” Zhang Yi’s pupils narrowed as the intense pain forced him to scream.

At this time, Tang Tian did not even stop and used his left hand to grab Zhang Yi’s left arm before breaking the other hand as well.

“I will break all four of your limbs!!” Tang Tian’s face turned sinister and was about to take action when he heard an incoming sound.

His pupils constricted as he subconsciously threw out a punch towards the sound.

Bang-

A loud sonorous sound was produced. Two fists collided and forced Tang Tian back a few steps to his surprise.

“Isn’t that enough?” Lin Xiu glared at him.

Lin Xiu saw and knew from below the stage that Tang Tian had used the hatred towards him and targeted everyone from Class 29.

“What class are you from? No one is allowed to barge in during the fight!” The referee immediately jumped forward and shouted.

“You want to see a student get killed here?” Lin Xiu glared at the referee coldly.

Lin Xiu’s cold glare caused his body to tremble.

What’s going on, how can a student wield such pressure?

“Lin Xiu, quickly carry him down.” Luo Li called the paramedics over.

Lin Xiu nodded his head and supported Zhang Yi down.

“Lin… Lin Xiu…” Zhang Yi lay on an automatic stretcher. He winced as if the pain would paralyze him. “You have to beat him…”

“Not a problem.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

After seeing him and the paramedics leave, Lin Xiu turned and stared at Tang Tian who was still on the stage.

“Winner, Tang Tian!” The referee shouted out.

“Relax, when it’s us, I will break all of your limbs.” Tang Tian turned to Lin Xiu and said as he walked down.

“This time, even if your father comes, I will beat you until all your teeth fall out.” Lin Xiu snorted.

Tang Tian narrowed his eyes when he heard Lin Xiu’s words, but he regained a calm mindset and glared at him. “It’s useless to be all talk, you will get it soon enough.”

Lin Xiu frowned as he watched Tang Tian’s departing figure. For some reason, Tang Tian’s aura was slightly dangerous to him. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

His strength had grown multiple times!

“Participant 1024, Lin Xiu!!!”

Right at this time, Lin Xiu heard his name over the intercoms. The next round of battles had begun!
