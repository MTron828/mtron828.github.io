Chapter 254: Hunted to Hunter II

Lin Xiu frowned as he looked at the warriors who were attacking in all directions.

There were quite a number of people, about 20 to 30 of them!

And these people were warriors who were rank 5 and above.

Lin Xiu was quite surprised that this team was so strong.

Dang dang dang——

Just as Lin Xiu was pondering, a lot of people suddenly charged over.

Their speed was very fast, but Lin Xiu’s reaction was even faster and it was easy for Lin Xiu to fight back with his Dark Edge spear.

After he blocked off these attacking warriors, Lin Xiu retreated slightly and immediately attacked again!

‘Profound intent.Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!

Bang bang bang——

As he used this skill, the Dark Edge spear became countless shadows and charged over!

There were sounds of explosions in the air.

With the increasing use of the ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ skill, Lin Xiu now had a 50 percent chance of using ‘Profound intent’ together with it.

And now, coupled with the ‘Overlord Spear Art’, the power of the ‘Profound intent’ and ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ had become extremely formidable!

These guys were shocked to see this.

They did not think that after Lin Xiu released such a strong skill, he was now using an even stronger skill.

They didn’t want to even attack Lin Xiu anymore and were just thinking about fleeing, or resisting!

But these were merely thoughts and their bodies couldn’t react so quickly to dodge the attack.

Some of the warrior’s bodies immediately got pierced through and there was even an explosive sound – their bodies actually exploded!

Horrifying, it was really horrifying!

In a short moment, those guys, who were within the radius of Lin Xiu’s ‘Profound Intent’ and Torrential storm of rose flowers’ skill, were instantly killed!

The system prompts in Lin Xiu’s head kept ringing.

How could it be!!!

When the people behind saw this scene, they were flabbergasted.

‘What exactly is going on?’

Some people had the combat strength calculation apparatus in their eyes and could easily tell what was Lin Xiu’s strength.

He was merely at the standard of a rank 5 warrior so how did he manage to kill dozens of people within such a short span of time!

And these people were rank 5 warriors!

This level of strength, even a rank 6 warrior might not be able to achieve.

When they killed the rank 6 warriors previously, only one or two warriors died.

“Kill them.” At this time, Guo Ling’s eyes became cold.

She appeared quite gentle, but when she starts fighting, she was ruthless.

Her body moved swiftly and in the next moment, Guo Ling held her long sword and killed a man nearby.

Qiu Li and the others who were behind Guo Ling quickly charged towards those warriors.

As Lin Xiu had just killed a dozen of rank 5 warriors, the attackers neither had an advantage in numbers anymore nor strength anymore.

The situation turned for the better in an instant.

“Zhou Hua! Have you killed those people yet!?”

At this time, a voice resounded from behind.

Lin Xiu looked over with his Dark Edge sword that was stained with blood and immediately saw a group of people.

And that voice sounded somewhat familiar.

“So it’s you.” Lin Xiu said as these people got closer.

These people were those guys at the mechanical mount store.

He didn’t expect that a small conflict would make these people want their lives.

With that thought, Lin Xiu’s eyes became colder.

The man looked at the scene in the distance and froze.

There were many dead bodies around Lin Xiu and the place looked very bloody.

Moreover, the tip of the Dark Edge spear that was in Lin Xiu’s hand was pointing towards them.

The fresh blood on the spear slowly dripped on the ground.

“You killed them!?” Not only this man, but even those people behind him were stunned.

They were people from the guild in the Deep Blue City and these people were rank 5 warriors, there were even some rank 6 warriors among them.

In the Deep Blue City, they were quite powerful people.

After Lin Xiu and the others left, he contacted the people who had just come back from a mission to attack Lin Xiu and the rest.

This wasn’t the first time they were doing this kind of thing and it always succeeded every time.

But he didn’t expect that his people were all killed!

Not far behind Lin Xiu, he could clearly see Guo Ling and the others killing all the remaining warriors!

At this time, there was a strong smell of blood in the air.

“Did you guys come to die as well?” Lin Xiu looked at them indifferently.

When he saw Lin Xiu’s icy gaze, he couldn’t help but tremble.

They never thought that so many people from their guild would die!

“Kid, do you know who we are?” The leader suppressed the fear in his heart and stared at Lin Xiu.

His heart was now dripping blood. He thought that it was easy to teach these people a lesson but didn’t expect that not only did he not injure a single person in Lin Xiu’s group, but his own people also had all died!

These people were the backbone of the guild and with so many dead, it would greatly affect the strength of their guild.

If those people that they had offended in the past found out about this, they might come knocking.

“You think you could still threaten me now?” Lin Xiu said faintly at this time.

“You…”

Listening to the words of Lin Xiu, this man was dumbfounded.

Lin Xiu has killed so many people, some of which were even stronger than them so how could they attack Lin Xiu?

“Send the signal!” The man’s eyes widened as he howled with a sinister look.

As he yelled, a guy took out a strange round thing and pressed on the button on top. Then, it flew into the sky immediately.

Bang—— Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At the next moment, this thing burst into the air and formed a lotus pattern.
