Chapter 620: No, It’s Not Enough

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The decoration of the hotels of the Warrior Union was very nice.

Moreover, in the middle of each floor, there was a huge training ground, which was provided for the daily training of the staying warriors.

Lin Xiu walked over at this time and saw the closed door.

After pushing it open, Lin Xiu could clearly see the empty field inside, and there were a lot of weapons placed around for people to use.

In this training room, many warriors were sitting cross-legged, using [cultivation techniques], absorbing the energy in the surrounding air.

“Are you all training here tonight?”

Lin Xiu glanced around, and then he saw that Ouyang Hang and the others were training with warriors in front.

“Well, it’s almost time for the match, so we’re train first.”

Huang Zhen still looked a little nervous when he thought about the game that starts the day after tomorrow.

“Sky City’s Sky Academy is no worse than our Sacred Region academy, be careful.”

Ouyang Hang was from Sky City, and he obviously knew the affairs of Sky City. At this time, his expression became more serious and he said.

“Is Yu Muchen from Sky City?”

“Yes, his father is the principal.”

Ouyang Hang nodded, then said aloud.

“What is his strength in Sky City?”

“I don’t know, there have been many highly qualified warriors in Sky City in recent years. There should be several stronger than Yu Muchen.” Ouyang Hang thought about it at this time, and then said aloud.

“En...”

Lin Xiu also frowned slightly at this time. At that time, it took a lot of money to deal with Yu Muchen, but now that his strength has improved to this level, it should not be difficult to deal with him.

He just didn’t know if Yu Muchen’s strength has improved too.

And this sky academy didn’t seem to be that simple.

Possibly even stronger than Sacred Region academy, after all, Sacred Region academy had gone through so many years of development, it seemed to be in decline again.

“Damn!”

At this moment, Ouyang Hang suddenly cursed, his body was about to fall to the ground in an instant, and then he quickly supported his body before he could stabilized himself.

“What’s up?”

Lin Xiu said a little curiously.

Taking a closer look, the eyes of the surrounding warriors became extremely ugly.

Some of the warriors who were just training fell directly to the ground.

“I’m going... don’t you feel it...”

At this moment, Ouyang Hang took a deep breath before standing firmly.

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu only came to his senses at this time. It was as if the gravity here has changed?

“Huh? Gravity has changed? It seems to have increased tenfold.”

Lin Xiu moved his body at this time, and then speculated.

“You are really a monster.”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s actions, Ouyang Hang couldn’t help but say aloud.

He and others were obviously affected by this change in gravity, but Lin Xiu didn’t seem to feel it yet.

“Sorry, to train, we have to adjust the gravity, don’t we?”

At this moment, a man in a red battle suit came over and said to the surrounding warriors.

Taking a closer look, you could see that he was standing in front of the wall behind the middle of the training room, and his finger was pressing the switch on it.

Here, it was possible to control the gravity of the training room.

Beside him, there were two men wearing the same suits, both with indifferent expressions.

“Oh, by the way, I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Zhou Chen from Interstellar academy.”

The man said with a smile, he looked very tanned and healthy.

Interstellar Academy!?

When some people heard the man’s self-introduction, their expressions changed slightly.

Some people were about to get angry, but at this time they forcibly restrained their anger.

“Interstellar Academy? Are they very strong?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

When Lin Xiu saw Ouyang Hang and others’ eyes slightly changed, he couldn’t help but say aloud.

“You really haven’t paid attention huh...”

When Ouyang Hang heard Lin Xiu’s words, he felt helpless.

“The Interstellar Academy competed with people from our academy in a competition last year, and people from our academy lost.”

Ouyang Hang lowered his voice and said.

At this time, Huang Zhen and Qian Yao’s faces became ugly.

“However, I think ten times the gravity isn’t much. Let’s try fifteen times.”

At this time, Zhou Chen glanced at everyone present, and in the next moment, he pressed the button on the wall behind with his finger.

In the next moment, there was a ‘humming’ sound around.

Soon, the gravity of the training room changed again.

“Fuck...”

Ouyang Hang was about to curse his mother at this time. The sudden change in gravity made them feel very uncomfortable.

Zhou Chen looked at the uncomfortable expressions of the people around him as if they were about to be crushed to the ground by gravity, and the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but twitch.

“It seems that this gravity is quite suitable for you.” Zhou Chen said with a smile at this time.

However, his eyes glanced to the front, and he frowned when he saw Lin Xiu punching, as if it had no effect at all.

“The one over there, fifteen times the gravity isn’t enough, right?” His eyes turned to Lin Xiu, and he shouted loudly.

Lin Xiu stopped the movements in his hands at this time, then turned to look at him, “It’s really not enough.”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the expression in Zhou Chen’s eyes suddenly changed. The next moment, he showed a smile again and said, “Very well, it seems that I should increase it.”

At this time, he directly pressed the button behind it, and the gravity multiplier was increased again in an instant.

Taking a closer look, you could see the ‘eighteen’ displayed on the back.

Eighteen times the gravity!

“That doesn’t seem to be enough.”

Lin Xiu moved his body and continued to wave his fists, using a basic set of boxing techniques.

Not affected at all!

At this moment, Ouyang Hang and others were sitting cross-legged on the ground, and then started to run the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

The surrounding warriors were also sitting cross-legged on the ground, and there seemed to be sweat overflowing from their foreheads.

Eighteen times the gravity, these warriors still found it very hard to bear.

“Let’s make it higher.” Lin Xiu shook his head, and then said lightly.

Ouyang Hang, who was sitting cross-legged on the ground, obviously heard Lin Xiu’s words and cursed in his heart.

“Humph!”

Zhou Chen’s complexion also changed slightly, from fifteen times to eighteen times. It didn’t look like much, but in fact, it had a huge difference.

Even he felt a little uncomfortable, but when he heard Lin Xiu’s words, he was ruthless and pressed twenty times!

Pff—

Some warriors originally had their eyes closed, but when they opened their eyes, they spat out a mouthful of blood.

And the two companions next to Zhou Chen also half-knelt on the ground.

“No, it’s not enough.”
