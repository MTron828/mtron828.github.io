Chapter 830: Killing Blow

“What the hell is this?!”

At this moment, some warriors looked at the staff who was knocked flying by the huge tentacles and said aloud at this time.

The entire hull was shaking at this time, as if something was ramming against it wildly.

clap clap-

And at this moment, the sound of the impact of seawater sounded and a huge figure climbed up from the bow!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes could not help shrinking.

What a big monster!

And it looks like an octopus.

The Analytic Eye is activated subconsciously:

Overlord Octopus

/ FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Rank: King level

Features: A creature unique to the Black River, with a huge size, strong aggressiveness and strong recovery ability.

Weakness: head

Overlord Octopus!?

Lin Xiu raised his brows.

Moreover, the current Analytic Eye skill seems to have been upgraded and it can actually analyze the weaknesses.

bang bang bang-

At this time, all the staff on the surrounding boats continued to attack Overlord Octopus with their laser guns in their hands.

These overlord octopuses have so many tentacles that they look very disgusting.

Those laser rays hit the tentacles of those overlord octopuses and immediately shot out circular wounds.

But in the next moment, the wounds that their laser rays penetrated healed at a speed visible to the naked eye.

“how can that be...”

Some people were in shock and were knocked out by the tentacles of the overlord octopus.

It hit the surrounding deck heavily.

Some people were directly strangled by those tentacles and their bodies were broke in half!

“Damn!”

At this time, Chen Dong’s face also became ugly. Holding the sword in his hand, his whole body suddenly burst out with strength.

He attacked the tentacles that came.

bang bang bang-

With the whooshing sound, those tentacles were immediately cut off.

But these tentacles were just cut off for a while and in the next moment, they grew frantically at a speed visible to the naked eye.

The body of this huge overlord octopus was about to climb to the deck.

At this time, those tentacles seem to be more and more, all of them are attacking the crowd.

The surrounding warriors did not hide their weakness at this time and directly used their own skills.

boom boom boom —

A loud noise kept ringing.

This overlord octopus is not very powerful, but its regeneration ability is really too powerful.

At this time, Luo Yue also looked at the tentacles that were charging towards her and the expression in her eyes changed slightly.

Holding the long sword in her hand, she slashed directly at it!

A sword aura burst out, causing all those tentacles to shatter.

Just when Luo Yue wanted to continue attacking, her face suddenly turned pale, then her long sword stabbed the ground.

what happened...

Luo Yue shook her head, because now she could clearly feel that something was wrong with her body.

After using the skill just now, the body seemed to have a sense of dizziness.

“Luo Yue?!”

Lin Xiu was about to find an opportunity to deal a fatal blow to the overlord octopus, but in the next moment, he realized that Luo Yue seemed to be in a bad state.

“I’m fine...”

Luo Yue shook her head, just as she was about to stand up straight, her eyes darkened and she immediately fainted.

Lin Xiu quickly put his arms around her waist.

What exactly is going on?!

bang bang bang-

At this time, the tentacles of this overlord octopus grew out again, then rushed towards him frantically!

“Get lost!!!”

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu roared angrily, as he threw the long spear full of blue flames toward the head of the overlord octopis!

The tentacles of Overlord Octopus wanted to grab the spear, but the spear went straight through it.

boom–

The spear pierced the middle of its head. The overlord octopus originally had a lot of tentacles stretched out to attack Lin Xiu and others, but at this moment, its body swayed.

Those tentacles seemed to have lost their vitality in an instant, softened and fell directly to the ground.

Boom—

The huge body of the overlord octopus also fell directly on the deck.

“This darn thing... is dead?”

Some warriors also said in surprise at this time.

Is it that kid?

Just now, Chen Dong clearly saw the spear Lin Xiu threw out and it actually killed this terrifying evolved beast!?

“Phew, it’s really unfortunate, I didn’t expect to encounter such a thing on the first day.”

Some warriors could not help but heaved a sigh of relief.

Although they also used their powerful skills just now, because the recovery speed of this overlord octopus is too terrifying, it is impossible to kill it directly.

Lin Xiu hugged the unconscious Luo Yue with his left hand. With a wave of his right hand, the spear flew back instantly into Lin Xiu’s hand.

Ignoring the people around, Lin Xiu directly carried Luo Yue back to the room.

Looking at Luo Yue lying on the bed, Lin Xiu was also a little anxious.

what’s the problem? Why did Luo Yue fall into a deep sleep again?

bang bang bang-

At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

“Who is it.”

Lin Xiu frowned and said coldly.

“it’s me.”

Chen Dong’s voice came from the door.

“It’s him?”

Lin Xiu tucked Luo Yue in bed, hesitated for a moment and walked over to the door.

“Is something wrong?”

After Lin Xiu opened the door, he looked at Chen Dong and said lightly.

“It seems that you don’t seem to welcome me very much.”

Chen Dong looked at Lin Xiu who only opened the door with a small gap and didn’t want to let himself in, so he spread his hands helplessly.

“What’s the matter?”

Lin Xiu said indifferently that he is not in a good mood now.

“She is from Fengyun City, from the Luo family right.”

Chen Dong said in a serious tone at this time.

Hearing Chen Dong’s words, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly. At this moment, the whole person burst out with extremely terrifying killing intent.

It made Chen Dong feel a chill down his spine.

Horrifying.

Chen Dong’s body trembled slightly.

“I have no malice.”

Chen Dong said quickly.

At this moment, he felt like he had stepped into hell.

As soon as his voice fell, that terrifying feeling disappeared.

Chen Dong’s forehead, at this time, also had cold sweat overflowing.

This time, among the people recruited by Old Man An, there seems to be a monster...

“I just saw that the swordsmanship she just used was exactly the same as the Luo Family’s swordsmanship.”

“Also, her symptoms are very similar to the sequelae of one of the Luo Family’s exercises...”

“What do you know!?”
