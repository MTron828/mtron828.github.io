Chapter 209: The Resplendent Rank 8 Odd Crystal

After three days and three nights of battle, this terrifying Ice crystal white bird finally fell!

Its huge body fell directly on the ground, motionless.

There was no doubt that it was completely dead!

“Finally dead!” The man with the double-sided giant ax walked over immediately.

“We’ll all share the Odd crystals, don’t snatch.” While the man spoke, he walked over there.

He glanced around and did not relax at all.

As the saying goes, people die for money and birds die for food. Although they said they were going to split the spoils before the battle, who didn’t want to own it all?

This is human nature.

The warriors around looked exceptionally suspicious as their eyes were fixed on the man with the double-sided giant ax and the corpse of the Ice crystal white bird.

Some people looked at each other and their gaze became weird.

The place seemed abnormally quiet all at once.

“Go to hell!” Just when the man holding the double-sided giant ax in command of the battle walked in front of the Ice crystal white bird’s body, a warrior finally couldn’t hold it in and directly attacked the man from the back!

“Get lost!” The man holding the double-sided ax obviously expected this. At this time, his body turned abruptly and he used that terrifying ax to split his body in half!

Warm blood splashed on his cheeks instantly.

“I said that these are ours, what are you guys anxious about.” The man wiped the blood from his face with his sleeve and said coldly.

His face now looked very hideous, especially with the blood just now. He smeared it with his sleeve and it made his face look very bloody.

Some people around who still wanted to make a move hesitated instantly.

They all knew that this man with a double-sided ax was a rank 7 peak warrior and for a while, they dare not move.

“I advise you not to act rashly. When I take out the Odd crystal, we are moving the body of the Ice crystal white bird back. Then, everyone will have a share of the pie.” The man said grimly at this time and then stood in front of the corpse of the Ice crystal white bird. Suddenly, he raised the double-sided ax with both hands.

A large amount of source strength gathered on his ax, which looked terrifying.

In the next moment, he cut directly to the head of the ice crystal white bird!

Boom——

With the sound of a huge explosion, at this moment, all the feathers that looked like ice crystals covering its head were shattered.

It was like a broken ice cube.

Bang bang bang——

He didn’t stop moving his hands. At this time, he was holding the double-sided ax in both hands and was still desperately hacking at the head of the Ice crystal white bird.

After all, this Ice crystal white bird was dead now and its body was not as hard as it used to be.

It didn’t take long before the man was holding a huge and terrifying double-sided ax to split its head open.

At this time, a white light shone through the slit in its head.

Odd crystal, a rank 8 Odd crystal!!!

This Odd crystal was different from ordinary Odd crystals, it could release such a bright light.

Those warriors around had greed in their eyes at this time.

“The laser cannon is ready to…launch!!!”

At this moment, not far from there, there were already quite a few laser cannons aimed at the area over there and fired instantly!

Boom boom——

With loud noises coming from the surroundings, the laser cannon directly blasted towards those people.

The laser cannon was very scary, it directly penetrated the surrounding buildings, leaving huge holes.

Some warriors over there were accidentally hit by the huge laser cannon and they didn’t even leave a scum!!!

“Damn, the Union army wants to seize it!”

Some warriors were shocked.

“Hng, this is mine…” The man with the double-sided ax looked at the bright crystals and his eyes were filled with greed.

Just when he was about to reach out and take the Odd crystal out, a cold light flashed from the surrounding area.

Before he could react, a burst of blood sputtered out.

His whole arm was cut off neatly!

“Ah!!!” The excruciating pain caused him to let out a sudden cry.

“This Odd crystal is mine!!!” The man who had just cut off his arm roared with a hideous face.

The rank 8 Odd crystal was simply too attractive and these people couldn’t care less anymore, each of them wanted it for themselves.

“Go to hell!!!” The man holding the double-sided ax yelled.

But he was a rank 7 warrior after all. At this time, he quickly recovered, holding the double-sided ax in his hand and slashed at the man’s body.

The man wanted to use his saber to fight back, but he didn’t expect that the man holding the double-sided ax had such a powerful force.

His saber was directly chopped off by his double-sided ax and his head was split in half.

Some red and white things spilled out in an instant.

“Hahaha! Who dares to grab my Odd crystal!!!” At this time, he laughed wildly.

Just then, the other warriors also rushed over and attacked.

Everyone was thinking about snatching the Odd crystals!

The whole scene was chaotic; the union army and the warriors hidden in the dark all came out at this time!

There was a series of more terrifying sounds than when they were fighting against the Ice crystal white bird.

There were warriors releasing all sorts of skills everywhere and there were even some laser cannons being shot from time to time.

“That is the rank 8 Off crystal!?” Lin Xiu and Luo Yue wanted to rush over there to seize it at first. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

But seeing this situation, the two of them gave up the idea.

They were surrounded by warriors who were rank six and above, they couldn’t participate in battles of that level at all.

Luo Yue was confident, but not arrogant.

At this time, the two of them took refuge in a nearby building, leaning on the window to observe carefully. Then, they saw the Odd crystal that was the size of a baby’s palm exposed from the head of the Ice crystal white bird. Lin Xiu was shocked.

This Odd crystal looked like a piece of white crystal that emits bright light.

It was shaped like a polished diamond with sharp edges and corners.

And the energy fluctuations in there were very strong, he believed that as long as one absorbs the energy inside, it would be enough to make a high-ranking warrior become even stronger!!!
