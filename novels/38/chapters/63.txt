Chapter 64: Ye Gulin

“Lin Xiu, you won again!” Yang Tian exclaimed excitedly when he saw that Lin Xiu had defeated another opponent.

“Unfortunately, I’ve only won one match.”

“Congratulations, we’ll be in the finals tomorrow.” Teacher Luo Li came over at this moment and smiled.

Only the remaining 100 out of tens of thousands of students could participate in the elimination battle the next day.

It was really selecting the cream of the crop.

Lin Xiu smiled at this moment and looked over. He saw Tang Tian’s figure.

At this moment, his eyes were cold and murderous. Even the students standing next to him could somewhat feel the gloomy and cold air around him and they hurried away.

Tang Tian looked at Lin Xiu too, and his lips moved.

Although he did not hear his voice, Lin Xiu still knew what he said.

“I will kill you.”

Lin Xiu raised his brows, then sneered. It was not confirmed at whose hands would the deer die.

“Look, look, they have started drawing lots!” At this moment, Yang Tian looked at the school leaders sitting there in the middle and suddenly saw in the huge 3D projection above that they had started to draw lots.

A random draw was done among the 100 students who won that day’s elimination.

A large number of students looked over there.

The end-of-term matches could sometimes also depend on luck; there must be some beginner warriors who encountered someone weaker or about the same level because of luck and got into the finals.

So the draw was also one of the factors affecting the final result.

“Haha, Lin Xiu, if only you had gotten that beginner warrior and won straight into the next round.”

Yang Tian said with a smile.

There would be rewards for reaching the finals, and the rewards would increase as one advanced to the next round.

“It doesn’t matter,” Lin Xiu waved and said.

His eyes were focused on the projection.

If he had to fight against the top 10 on the list, it was still a bit of trouble. After all, there would be talented people at every place, and the top 10 were those who not only were gifted but also experienced seniors who were about to graduate, so they would still be stronger than him.

Zhang Lin looked at the 3D projection over there and the corners of his lips curled upwards.

He got someone to manipulate the draw and Lin Xiu would definitely have to fight against that person in the end.

Soon, as the results from the draw were slowly released, some people were glad to be fighting against someone weaker while some were sad when they were put against someone stronger.

After all, no one wanted to lose the first round after getting into the finals.

“Hey, it’s your turn! No. 1024 against No.8…”

“No.8 Ye Gulin?”

“How could it be him?” When Luo Li saw this, he frowned. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Although he had confidence in Lin Xiu, he couldn’t help but get nervous when he saw Ye Gulin.

Ye Gulin, who was ranked 4th in the combat strength list, was a senior, but he was often not in school. He was always in and out of a variety of high-risk areas where zombies and evolved beasts coexisted in order to train.

It was said that he had also just come back not long ago. They wondered if this amazingly gifted person had already reached the level of a rank 3 warrior.

“It seems a little tricky now.” Lin Xiu also frowned at this time.

He had also heard of this person’s name. As he was always out for practice, he retained a year in the senior year. He wasn’t over 19 years old, so the school also tacitly gave their consent.

This man was very experienced in combat and his skills were also very scary!

“Lin Xiu, have a good rest tonight, don’t give yourself too much pressure. After all, our class has never had a finalist and there are two this time,” Luo Li said.

“Two?” Lin Xiu was stunned, then saw Zhang Yi coming over.

“I was lucky and got in as well,” Zhang Yi said.

He had looked down on Lin Xiu before, but now he regarded Lin Xiu as an equal, and after a month of training hard, he had improved rapidly too.

He was matched against quasi-warriors during this battle so he was pretty lucky.

“But I’m up against Tang Tian in the first round.” Zhang Yi then looked at the results from the draw and smiled bitterly.

Tang Tian’s strength was close to a rank 1 warrior previously and now that he came back from the “Path of death” training, his strength had probably broken through the level of a rank 1 warrior.

“All the best.” Lin Xiu patted him on the shoulder and said.

Zhang Yi had changed a lot too and wasn’t so annoying anymore.

Back in his dormitory, Lin Xiu took a hot bath and lay comfortably on the bed.

Previously, he practically didn’t shower at all in Guang Ming Fort for almost a month; it was really uncomfortable.

Lying in bed, Lin Xiu remembered the monthly lottery chance, and the one he won that day added up to two lottery chances!

Without much thought, Lin Xiu went straight into the system and clicked on the lottery interface.

Sure enough, the number of lottery chances shown below was 2.

Lin Xiu tapped to start the lottery and entered the familiar turntable interface.

Soon, the familiar lottery wheel interface reappeared.

The lottery interface was similar to the last time and the lottery wheel was still divided into ten sections.

But there was a slight change; three sections were skill cards, another three sections were Odd Crystals, and the remaining three sections were potential pills, while the last section occupied a very small area and was still the grand prize.

Odd Crystal? It was not very useful and the gift bag seemed to have disappeared. It seemed like the sections of the lottery wheel would change every time.

The change should be refreshed every day, right?

Without much hesitation, Lin Xiu clicked on the center of the lottery wheel for it to start spinning, and the wheel began to spin at a very fast pace.

Potential pills or the grand prize, other things like the skill cards and Odd Crystals weren’t of great use to Lin Xiu

After all, he wasn’t proficient in his current two skills yet, and other than absorbing source strength from the Odd Crystals, he could only sell it for money, but he wasn’t really short of money.

“Stop, stop, stop!!!” Seeing that the needle looked like it was about to stop at the grand prize, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but get excited.

The previous prize was the Awe of the Phoenix skill card and he wasn’t sure what the grand prize would be if he got it.

Just as Lin Xiu was getting very excited, the needle moved to the skill card section the next second.

“Come on!”

This thing was simply a scam. He clearly saw the needle stopping at the grand prize, but it slipped at the last second!

Lin Xiu decided not to use his other lottery chance, there weren’t many useful things in the lottery wheel today.

He exited the system interface in his mind and saw a bright light in front of his eyes as a glistening card appeared before him.
