Chapter 467: Conversation

Lin Xiu cursed when he heard Nan Zhengjun’s words.

If it hadn’t been for Dean Baili who made him go down to complete the strange task, he would not suffer this kind of harm.

Although it was a blessing in disguise, Lin Xiu still felt very upset.

“Lin Xiu, don’t talk like that.” Nan Zhengjun said aloud at this time.

“Ahem, Dean Baili called me over?” Lin Xiu coughed awkwardly and then said aloud.

After all, that old guy’s status in the Sacred Region Academy was very high, and these people seem to respect him very much.

So Lin Xiu didn’t say much at this time.

“En, if you don’t have any major physical problems, let’s go there now. He said there is something very important to talk to you about.” Nan Zhengjun nodded, and then said seriously to Lin Xiu. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Okay, I’ll go now.” Lin Xiu nodded, but he thought to himself, what can this old guy talk to him about?

Don’t tell me he wants me to complete some strange task again?

No way, I must make sure I get something back from the old guy’s vault this time.

Otherwise, if he went into the sea, he would suffer for nothing!

With this thought, Lin Xiu suddenly came to his senses and then walked over there directly.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s retreating figure, Nan Zhengjun was stunned for a moment, and then took out a data sheet about Lin Xiu’s physical examination from his pocket. Looking at the content displayed on it, Nan Zhengjun’s expression changed.

“Lin Xiu’s body… is evolving?”

As Lin Xiu had been here last time, he found his way to Dean Baili’s office very easily.

Lin Xiu pushed open the door of his office and saw Dean Baili making tea.

“You’re here?” He didn’t look up at Lin Xiu but seemed to know that Lin Xiu has arrived.

Lin Xiu curled his lips, then sat down at the teatable over there, and drank the tea he had just made.

Even in the future world, this ancient method of making tea was still very popular.

“That cup of tea is worth 10 million Union coins eh.” Seeing Lin Xiu drinking the superior tea like a cow in one fell swoop, even Dean Baili felt a sting in his heart.

“Let’s talk, what do you want me to do again?” Lin Xiu ignored the painful expression of Dean Baili and said straightforwardly.

“I’m sorry, I really didn’t know that it was so dangerous below.” Dean Baili looked at Lin Xiu and seemed to speak sincerely.

“Ya right.” Lin Xiu knew that these old foxes were all great at acting so he curled his lips and said aloud.

“If you feel sorry, you should give me some of the diamond skill cards or something.”

“Sure.” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Dean Baili stroked his beard, then took a sip of tea, and said with a smile.

Dean Baili was so straightforward but it made Lin Xiu feel a little strange.

“What are you plotting?” Lin Xiu stared at him suspiciously.

He had to be on his guard around these old foxes.

“Lin Xiu, don’t think too much.” Dean Baili shook his head and said.

“Who knows if you will cheat me…” Lin Xiu whispered to himself.

Dean Baili, who has very good listening, heard Lin Xiu’s muttering and was a little dumbfounded.

“Okay, let’s get to the point.” Dean Baili put the teacup on the table, then looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“What exactly did you encounter and how did you get such a serious injury below?” Dean Baili said.

Originally, he was going to ask Luo Yue, after all, Luo Yue went down to save Lin Xiu.

But it seems that because Lin Xiu was unconscious. Luo Yue attributed this incident to Dean Baili and almost used a knife on Dean Baili so she definitely wouldn’t tell Dean Baili what happened below.

“It’s nothing. An evolved beast emerged from the space crack and I fought with it.” Lin Xiu said indifferently.

“Evolved beast? What evolved beast?” Dean Baili was taken aback, and he then asked.

“The rank 8 Furious Black Whale.” Lin Xiu had nothing to hide and said directly.

Rank 8!?

“Furious Black Whale… I don’t seem to have heard the name of this evolved beast, how did you know it?” Dean Baili thought for a while, and then curiously said to Lin Xiu.

Pffff——

Lin Xiu, who was thinking about finishing up this precious tea, nearly spat everything out when he heard Dean Baili’s words.

“I simply came up with it, but it must be a rank 8 evolved beast.” Lin Xiu pretended to be very calm and said aloud.

Dean Baili looked at Lin Xiu thoughtfully, making Lin Xiu feel a little uncomfortable.

“After that, when I was fighting with it, I was swallowed by it…” Lin Xiu directly told Director Baili the scene of the battle.

After that, Lin Xiu felt as if there was a figure who killed the furious black whale and rescued him.

Lin Xiu knew immediately that that figure was Luo Yue!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but feel a little moved. If it weren’t for Luo Yue, he might have died, right?

“En… Then Luo Yue probably killed it later.” Dean Baili nodded, and then mumbled to himself.

It really was Luo Yue.

Lin Xiu thought of this and his eyes were a little dazed.

“By the way, when you were below, did you find the energy body?” Dean Baili pondered for a while, and then continued to say to Lin Xiu.

Energy body!?

When he said this, Lin Xiu’s expression changed a little.

He found this thing at first, and it seemed to be in his pocket, but then he passed out.

And when he woke up, he was changed out of his original clothes and he didn’t know where was his battle suit, so obviously the energy body disappeared with it.

“I found it, but it seems to have disappeared later.” Lin Xiu thought for a while, and then said to Dean Baili.

“It’s gone!?” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Dean Baili was startled.

He just saw the slight change of expression on Lin Xiu’s face, but what Lin Xiu said did not sound like a lie.

“There is an artificial intelligence robot below. I saw it holding the energy body and wanted to snatch it, but I couldn’t and after that, I was fighting with that furious black whale.”

Lin Xiu said sincerely.
