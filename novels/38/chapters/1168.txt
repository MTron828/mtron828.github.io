1169 Beast God’s Skeleton

The skeleton of an evolved beast?

At this time, Lin Xiu continued to look in front of him, and he was very surprised.

The skeleton of this evolved beast is very large, and these bones were dark green like jade, which looked very strange.

“This is the skeleton of a beast god…”

When these people saw this scene, their eyes widened.

Their eyes were full of disbelief.

Although this was just a skeleton, those warriors could still feel that this skeleton exuded some kind of terrifying pressure.

“Don’t touch!”

At this time, seeing a warrior reaching out and touching this huge skeleton, the expression in Zhao Laosan’s eyes changed slightly, and then he called out.

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

At this moment, a strange sound suddenly rang out.

Taking a closer look, you can clearly see that there were many lines on this bone that light up.

This pattern seems to be the same as the divine mark on the huge stone gate just now!

Countless divine marks were engraved on the bones of this beast god.

These divine marks seem to be linked together at this time, and they suddenly emit a lot of light.

Soon, this skeleton actually moved!

“Damn!”

When Zhao Laosan saw this scene, his face suddenly became extremely ugly.

The divine mark on the skeleton of the beast god was obviously triggered by the touch of the warrior.

With the triggering of the divine mark on the Beast God’s skeleton, the Beast God’s skeleton seemed to have vitality and began to move!

“This…this is…”

The warrior who just touched the skeleton of the beast god trembled at this moment, as if he had no idea how the skeleton of the beast god would move!

Before he could react, he was hit and sent flying out by the claws of the bones of the beast god that seemed to come to life!

boom–

His body slammed into the wall behind him heavily and suddenly made a loud noise.

Taking a closer look, his body was directly smashed into meat patties.

It looks very bloody.

“Be careful!!!”

The surrounding warriors, watching this scene, suddenly looked horrified.

At this moment, the gigantic beast god’s skeleton started to move!

It frantically attacked the surrounding warriors.

What the hell is this!?

Lin Xiu watched this scene, and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

The body subconsciously dodged to the other side.

This beast god’s skeleton seems to be activated because of the power of the divine mark engraved on its skeleton. At this time, it not only seems to be resurrected, but also has extremely strong power.

It frantically attacked the surrounding warriors.

boom boom boom —

There were loud noises in the entire space.

“The power of the Divine Mark… is it so powerful…”

Lin Xiu looked at the huge beast god’s skeleton. Because of the power of this divine pattern, it not only came back to life, but also had a powerful strength, which made Lin Xiu shocked.

He became even more curious about this so-called divine mark.

At this time, some weaker Sage warriors were madly attacked by the bones of the beast god, and were wailing miserably.

In an instant, a large number of warriors were killed!

And at this time, Ye Yu and Zhao Laosan’s faces also became ugly.

These god warrior-level warriors also attacked the beast god’s skeleton.

However, their attack did not smash the beast god’s skeleton to pieces.

The beast god’s skeleton was very hard, and with the blessing of the power of the gods, the power is really too strong.

The surrounding ground, because of the attack of the Beast God’s skeleton, was constantly shaking at this time.

And at this time, it seemed to have discovered Lin Xiu here, and its dark green skeleton claws swiped toward Lin Xiu!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

When his body was about to dodge, he found that the divine mark on the skeleton of the beast god seemed to have a special power blooming.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s body seemed to react extremely slowly.

Damn it!

Lin Xiu’s face suddenly turned ugly.

At this time, there is no other way but to unfold one’s ‘Sphere’ and resist.

boom– ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

As soon as the “circle” was unfolded, Lin Xiu’s body was directly shot out by the claws of the beast god’s skeleton.

His body was smashed heavily against the wall behind him.

pfft—

The huge impact force made Lin Xiu spit out a mouthful of blood.

Lin Xiu wiped the blood from his mouth, and activated his Analytic eye.

In Lin Xiu’s eyes, all the divine marks on the bones of this huge beast god could be seen very clearly.

The decoding of the Divine marks also appeared in an instant.

“Damn!”

And at this moment, Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide, looking at this huge beast god’s skeleton, it was attacking him again!

Why is this damn thing staring at me and not letting go!

While Lin Xiu cursed inwardly, his body jumped up.

Boom—

The claws of the beast god hit the ground where Lin Xiu was just now.

Lin Xiu’s body stood on the skull of this beast god at this time.

With a thought, the Dark edge spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

Holding the Dark edge spear in both hands, he aimed at its head and stabbed it hard!

boom–

The spear stabbed the huge dark green skull, making a dull sound.

At this moment, a divine mark on its skull disappeared instantly.

That’s right, Lin Xiu stabbed at its skull according to the information from the Analytic Eye.

With the disappearance of the divine mark on its skull, the huge skeleton of the beast god shook for a while.

Before Lin Xiu could continue to attack, its huge claws grabbed Lin Xiu who was standing on top of his head.

Lin Xiu, who responded quickly, dodged in an instant.

There were too many divine marks on the skeleton of this beast god. These divine marks not only give this huge beast god’s skeleton vitality, but these divine marks also endow the beast god’s skeleton with strength, speed, and weakening of the rest of the warriors’ speed.

Just now, Lin Xiu was affected by the power of the divine marks, and his body seemed to have weakened a lot.

This huge beast god’s skeleton, because Lin Xiu disappeared, madly attacked the surrounding warriors.

“Run! Run!”

Some warriors looked at this scene, and the expressions on their faces changed greatly.

The weaker ones had no intention of going to the ruins at this time.

After all, their lives were more important!

At this time, Lin Xiu had already appeared on the other side. Just as he was trying to destroy the divine mark on the skeleton of the beast god, a cold beam suddenly rushed over from the front!
