Chapter 111: Azure Forest

Up ahead was a forest of azure blue.

All the gigantic trees were azure blue, be it the leaves or branches.

“The thing you want is inside?” Lin Xiu looked around and asked Tian Zhi.

“No, we need to go through this and arrive at Black Salt Lake.” Tian Zhi shook his head and replied. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu became cautious as he walked on the blackish-blue soil.

According to the warrior net information that he had paid, there were various evolved beasts around.

The road in the Path of Death was long and this was just the beginning.

“Be careful, there are many high rank evolved beasts inside Azure Forest, and no one knows if they are affected by their surroundings, but their skin is blue as well. They are able to camouflage easily,” Zhi Tian explained while walking.

Lin Xiu nodded his head as he looked around constantly.

There were many bones on the ground already, as though all the warriors that came before them were devoured by something.

Azure Forest was extremely huge and all the warriors that followed behind got separated as well.

“Eh?” Right at this moment, Zhi Tian seemed to have seen something and immediately ran forward. He squatted down and flipped a few rotten leaves away. In the next second, he saw an Odd Crystal lying in the mud.

“Hahaha, rank 3 crystal! How lucky!” Zhi Tian spoke up happily. He blew on the Odd Crystal and rubbed it with his shirt before placing it in his pocket.

“There used to be many warriors inside the Azure Forest and all of them who died left their things here. So there will definitely be many treasures here.” Tian Zhi explained to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded his head and did not say much. He took out his phone and opened the warrior union website.

There were various missions on the warrior union website that warriors could accept.

Lin Xiu felt that Dark Edge was a good weapon and he did not need to change it, but his battle robes had wear and tear, and decided to change it for a better one in time. He also required high-grade skill cards, so he needed money.

He searched for missions relating to Path of Death and saw a series of missions:

Gather soil of Azure Forest ★ – Reward: 100 thousand Union Coins

Gather Blue Mutant Snake’s Snakeskin – ★★ – Reward: 1,020,000 Union Coins

Gather Salt Crystal – ★★★★ – Reward: 50 million Union Coins

4….

…

Lin Xiu looked at the 50 million Union Coins mission and his eyes narrowed. ‘What is this to have such high rewards?’

Lin Xiu knew that every individual star represented the difficulty, one star being the easiest and six stars as the most difficult. This mission was actually 4 stars.

“Do you know what are Salt Crystals?” Lin Xiu turned and asked Tian Zhi.

“Salt Crystals?” Tian Zhi was startled for a moment as he thought about it. After a while, he slapped his own thighs.

“I remember it now, it seems to be from the lowest region of Black Salt Lake. It seems that the Black Salt Lake would produce a type of crystal every decade, and there is quite a lot at that.”

“I see.” Lin Xiu thought about it for a moment before accepting the mission.

He wanted to give it a try, if he did manage to obtain the crystals by luck, it would be good. After all, it was 50 million Union Coins.

“Finally here.” After taking a few steps, Lin Xiu squinted his eyes and spoke up indifferently.

“What’s here?” Tian Zhi was confused, but in the next moment, Lin Xiu kicked him to the side!

Tian Zhi was stupefied by the sudden turn of events, but right at that moment, a laser ray shot straight out from the gigantic tree ahead!

It was right where he was originally standing!

A bottomless hole appeared in the blackish-blue soil.

Tian Zhi inhaled in a breath of cold air, there was actually an assassin?

When did he conceal himself ahead?

Lin Xiu turned his body and dodged another laser beam. He exerted force from both legs and shot forward.

Sou sou sou-

More and more laser beams appeared. Although Lin Xiu was carrying the large and long box, he was like a butterfly dancing as he dodged all the laser beams.

None could hit him in the slightest!

Lin Xiu jumped upwards ahead and stepped on the large branches. He immediately arrived at the canopy of the tree and launched a fist upwards.

A man dressed in black and red uniform held onto an extremely exaggerated laser rifle looked at Lin Xiu in disbelief.

The might of the laser rifle was far stronger than the laser gun and could penetrate through the flesh of rank 4 evolved beasts.

But it was also extremely expensive.

“Goodbye.” Lin Xiu revealed a sneer as he waved his right hand across!

Rupturing Fist!

The gloves on his fist turned red and an explosion was produced in the air.

Bang-

The man’s head exploded like a watermelon.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing a rank 2 warrior, obtaining 15000 experience!”

Lin Xiu immediately recognized the man as part of the Black Tiger Bandits from his clothes.

Who would have thought that they would thrive in here as well?

Lin Xiu had read up on the Black Tiger Bandits on the warrior union upon arriving. They were a C-Grade organization and their leader had a bounty of 5 million union coins.

“Damn it!” Tian Zhi avoided all the laser beams and charged to the side of a gigantic tree!

“Flowing Ray Strike!!!” He leaped upwards and performed a slash in midair. A ray of light flashed and cut the branches on the tree!

As the branches were cut, a member of the Black Tiger Bandits dropped down.

Tian Zhi slashed down on the man’s neck without hesitation!

The biggest weakness of warriors that used sniper rifles was revealed – they had no way of retaliating in close combat!
