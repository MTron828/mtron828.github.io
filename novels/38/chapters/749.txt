Chapter 750: Raging Flame Lion

Lin Xiu said to Zhao Kai and Xiao Qiang, who were sitting on the ground panting.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the faces of the two of them were a little ugly.

But thinking of the strength that Lin Xiu showed just now, there was nothing they could do.

They could only stand up helplessly, then took out a special knife, and began to dig out the odd crystals from the bodies of those one-horned yaks.

“Hehe, you deserve it.”

The little fat man, who always looked simple and honest, also laughed in a low voice at this time.

When he smiled, it seemed very wretched, making Lin Xiu speechless.

“By the way, Brother Lin, are you going to Fengyun City to participate in the warrior competition?”

Liu Pan seemed to have thought of something at this time, and then whispered to Lin Xiu.

“Yes.”

/

There was nothing to hide so Lin Xiu said directly.

“To be honest, me too.”

Liu Pan smiled, and then said in a low voice.

“You too?” Lin Xiu was startled, but Lin Xiu didn’t expect this.

As if he knew what Lin Xiu was curious about, Liu Pan continued to say, “I’ve seen the timetable, and it’s still more than a month before my turn to compete, so I thought about practicing for a while before going.”

“How are you going to go?”

Lin Xiu asked.

Just now, this darn fat man exaggeratedly said that Fengyun City was still 108,000 miles away from here.

“On foot to the next city, then sell the materials of the evolved beasts hunted and buy a mechanical mount.”

Liu Pan seemed to have made his own plan and said proudly at this time.

“Brother Lin, it seems that we are going to the same competition, let’s go together.”

Liu Pan continued to say with a smile.

“Don’t laugh.”

Seeing this fat man’s wretched smile, the corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth also twitched.

“Thanks.”

And An Qi and Qian Lin also came over at this time, and said apologetically to Lin Xiu.

If it wasn’t for Lin Xiu’s help just now, their lives would definitely be in danger.

“It’s fine.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

The two of them were a little embarrassed at this time, and they didn’t say anything. They started to treat their wounds with the contents of their backpacks.

“You, why are you so insensitive? These are two beauties and you don’t even try to tease them.” Liu Pan lowered his voice and said to Lin Xiu.

“Look, the one named An Qi has long legs and Qian Lin’s chest is a 36D...”

Saying that, Liu Pan couldn’t help swallowing secretly, with a wretched expression on his face, which was obvious.

If Lin Xiu was drinking water, he would probably spray a mouthful of water on his face.

This fat man just looked like he was harmless to humans and animals, but he didn’t expect it to be so wretched.

It seems that he thought he was simple and honest just now, but he was definitely wrong.

“Do these beast tides happen every year?”

Lin Xiu sat on the grass beside him, looked to the far side and said. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

This was a piece of grassland, and now in the scorching sun, the sun shone on Lin Xiu, making Lin Xiu feel a sense of warmth.

“En, in this month of every year, those evolved beasts will be active.”

Fatty also began to treat the wound with some special repair fluid, and said.

“When these evolved beasts are active, it is also the happiest time for us warriors.”

“This way we can hunt these evolved beasts.

“Look at these odd crystals, they can sell for a lot of money.”

Liu Pan said with a smile.

“The level is too low.”

Lin Xiu shook his head, watching Zhao Kai and Xiao Qiang put the odd crystals that Zhao Kai and Xiao Qiang had dug out for a long time in front of him, and said aloud.

There were about three hundred of these odd crystals, exuding blue light, and they looked very beautiful.

“Damn it, these are more than 300 rank 8 odd crystals. If you sell them, you can probably become the richest man in a small city!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Liu Pan said with wide eyes.

Lin Xiu didn’t reply to Liu Pan’s words, and directly put his hand on these odd crystals.

With the operation of the ‘Cultivation Technique’, in the next moment, the energy of these odd crystals was quickly absorbed by Lin Xiu at a speed visible to the naked eye.

There were too many odd crystals, and they could provide a lot of energy.

Lin Xiu felt that every cell in his body was absorbing these energies.

The whole body instantly became hot.

In a short period of time, more than three hundred rank 8 odd crystals all turned into white transparent glass beads.

“You...you absorbed them all!?”

Liu Pan stared with widened eyes.

Xiao Qiang and the others watched this scene from the other side, and couldn’t help being stunned.

He would get a lot of money by selling these odd crystals and even though absorbing as energy could gain a lot of power, it was still very painful for them.

Because these more than 300 odd crystals were equivalent to their cultivation for a week at most.

“The rank is too low, it’s too troublesome to bring them around.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

At this time, he felt that the source strength in his body had recovered.

And the energy he just absorbed has given him a lot of experience.

“Adding up the experience of the evolved beasts he just killed... Now the experience has only increased by 5%.”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

If it goes on like this, it will indeed become difficult to upgrade.

He killed so many rank 8 evolved beasts yet only gained so little experience.

And he wouldn’t encounter king-level evolved beasts so easily, right?

“What did you say about the experience?”

Liu Pan seemed to hear Lin Xiu muttering to himself, and said curiously at this time.

“Cough, I didn’t say anything.”

“Brother Lin, don’t you still play games?”

“...”

After resting for about half an hour, Lin Xiu stood up, looked in front of his eyes, and said to Liu Pan beside him:

“When do you plan to go to Fengyun City?”

“I want to kill that raging flame lion.” Liu Pan looked to the distance and said aloud.

“What kind of evolved beast is that?”

Lin Xiu was stunned. The evolved beasts on the Marqi planet are different from the evolved beasts on Earth.

Therefore, although Lin Xiu is familiar with the evolved beasts’ illustrations, he was still unfamiliar with the evolved beasts on the Marqi planet.

If he didn’t see the evolved beast’s body using the Analytic eye, he wouldn’t know what level it was.

“King-level.”

Liu Pan said in a deep voice.

“I think their goals should be the same as mine.”

He pointed to Xiao Qiang and others.

“Can you guys kill it though?”

It’s not that Lin Xiu looks down on them, he couldn’t even deal with the evolved beasts of the king level, let alone them.

The body of that evolved beast is really too powerful and huge.

It was still very difficult to kill it, just like killing the snow lizard last time.
