Chapter 251: Android Battle Tiger

Guo Ling led the way and everyone went forward.

Lin Xiu looked in that direction.

This was a shop selling mechanical mounts.

Similar to the android wolf that he had before.

But the core structure was different from that one. Compared to the android wolf, these structures were much simpler.

They were all driven by electricity.

Many people were crowding around and it seemed like many people were planning to buy one.

This kind of mechanical mount was relatively easy to use on steep mountain roads and its speed was not slow at all. Also, it has basic artificial intelligence.

“Boss, how much is this?” Guo Ling walked over, pointed at one of the mechanical mounts, and said to the owner of the shop. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The owner was a fat man with a fair round belly and swelled head.

“Android Battle Tiger, 1,500,000 each.” The owner said to Guo Ling.

“1,000,000, we want six.” Guo Ling said directly.

“No, I will make a loss.” The owner shook his head and said.

Seeing the boss refused so without hesitation, Guo Ling frowned.

The price of 1.5 million, relatively speaking, was indeed a bit expensive, because they had been living in the Sacred Region Academy for most of the time and were used to using points to exchange for items.

Although they had union coins, they didn’t have many.

“What’s the lowest you can go?” Qiu Li was a muscular guy in the team. At this moment, he walked out and asked the owner.

“If you want six, I can give you the lowest price, 1,410,000 each, which is the lowest. Never mind if you don’t want it, I have many people waiting to buy them.” The fat owner said impatiently.

As the city outside the Deep Blue City was surrounded by towering peaks and there were mountain roads on the way out, so many people used mechanical mounts.

“The L-32 model began mass production the year before. In May of this year, because the new model was already in production, it has now been discontinued. Moreover, the performance of the new model is much better than the old one. The price on the official website is only 1.5 million.”

“And you obviously modified the outer shell yourself and the shape was changed.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu walked over and said indifferently to the fat man.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the fat man’s eyes widened suddenly.

Guo Ling and the others also looked at Lin Xiu in surprise, a little curious about how Lin Xiu knew so much.

“You’ll know just by checking it online with your phone.” Lin Xiu saw the surprised expressions of Guo Ling and the others and said helplessly.

The owner’s gaze changed at this time, Lin Xiu didn’t speak very loudly and the other customers over there didn’t seem to hear him.

If someone heard that the owner deliberately refurbished some mechanical mounts, the reputation of this shop would be ruined.

“Forget it, 6 million, take them if you want.” The fat owner was silent for a while and said.

Hearing the fat man’s words, Guo Ling looked at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded. The shape was modified by the owner but the performance should not have an impact.

And this kind of thing wouldn’t break so easily.

Soon, Lin Xiu and the others completed the payment one by one.

Lin Xiu only discovered now that he only had about 1 million Union coins in his card.

“Boss, do you have any Android Battle Tigers?” At this moment, a group of people came over and shouted when they saw that Lin Xiu and the others were about to take away the last remaining mechanical mounts.

“Sorry, the last six have been taken by them.” The fat boss smiled apologetically and said aloud.

It was obvious that the fat owner seemed a little scared of these men.

Lin Xiu ignored them and walked directly to the Android Battle Tiger that he had just bought.

This Android Battle Tiger looked quite big and was light reflected off its surface.

After checking, he confirmed that everything was new. Except for that shell that has been modified by the owner in order to deceive customers who weren’t knowledgeable.

Lin Xiu inspected closely and was relieved after confirming that everything was new.

These Android Battle Tigers were all fully charged and Lin Xiu quickly started it up.

After entering his fingerprint and face authentication, this Android Battle Tiger was completely Lin Xiu’s.

“Look, the mechanical mounts over there are pretty good.” The fat owner looked at the men with a smile.

Then pointed to the mechanical mounts on the other side that appeared equally cool.

“No, I want this.” The man shook his head and said aloud.

“But this is the last one…” The fat owner said with cold sweat on his forehead.

“No, they just have to give it to us.” The man looked at Lin Xiu and the others who were about to leave on their Android Battle Tigers.

As soon as he said that, the men who were with him stood in front of Lin Xiu and the others, blocking the road.

“What’s the meaning of this?” Qiu Li said when he saw this scene.

Qiu Li looked relatively muscular and he was not afraid as he stared at the men and said.

Lin Xiu frowned when he saw this scene.

The uniforms of these people seemed to be the same like they were customized.

And based on the attitude of the fat owner just now, these people should be some small groups here.

“It doesn’t mean anything, you can get other Android Battle Wolf, we want these six Android Battle Tigers.” The leader of the group said aloud at this time.

The difference between the Android Battle Wolf and the Android Battle Tiger was in their power. If there was no special requirement, the Android Battle Wolf was also pretty decent.

“No way.” Guo Ling said coldly when he heard the man’s words.

“We have already paid for these.”

“Let’s go.” Guo Ling said as he glanced at the crowd behind him and said.

Qiu Li and the others were obviously convinced by Guo Ling. Hearing his words at this time, they immediately drove the Android Battle Tigers forward.

There were a lot of sharp spikes in the front of this Android Battle Tiger.

As Guo Ling and the others directly charged out with the Android Battle Tiger, they froze.

In the next moment, they quickly avoided.

After all, if you got hit by these Android Battle Tigers, you will be injured.

“Damn it! You guys better watch out!” When the man saw this scene, his eyes suddenly became exceptionally cold.

“Hmph, these people are simply courting death.” Qiu Li snorted while advancing forward with the Android Battle Tiger.

“These people probably wouldn’t let this matter rest.” Lin Xiu sat on the Android Battle Tiger and turned his head to look back.
