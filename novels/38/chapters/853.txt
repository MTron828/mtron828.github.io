Chapter 854: Goodbye!

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

He was starting to get excited with what is written inside the book?

Jiang Ying passed the book to him and there were lots of peculiar stories inside the book.

“This book is actually a diary.”

Jiang Ying flipped through the book as she said to Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Jiang Ying nodded her head.

“The most important thing is about how they left the Nanor Planet in search of earth.”

“They came from a family known as the ‘Bai’.”

“The Bai family?! Really?”

When Lin Xiu heard what it was, he asked in excitement.

“You...”

Jiang Ying jumped out of fright and took a few steps back.

Lin Xiu’s strength was now incredibly strong. As he got excited, the waves coming from his strength were terrifying.

It shook her indeed.

Luo Yue gently patted Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and said in an apologetic tone, “I’m so sorry. I was just excited.”

“Continue please.”

“En...”

Jiang Ying quickly nodded her head.

For some reason, she felt that Lin Xiu’s abilities were much stronger than before.

She hadn’t paid much attention to the infamous war since she was always buried in her experiments which was why she didn’t know that it was Lin Xiu who killed Huang Ying.

“They were on a mission to look for a planet known as ‘Earth’ but on their way here, they met with a small group of spaceships that broke their ship. That’s how they landed on the Marqi Planet.

“They used the remaining strength to rebuild the secret lab and proceeded with training the mutant purple frogs so that they would be able to hunt for odd crystals. After getting the crystals, they will inject the energy from it into their body in order to give them the strength in hopes of being awakened one day.”

As Jiang Ying continued, she flipped to the last page of the book.

“That’s all?”

Lin Xiu continued asking.

With only this information, it wasn’t enough.

“There’s nothing left.”

Jiang Ying shook her head.

“But, I noticed that there was something hidden in here. This is what I found.”

Jiang Ying took out a small piece of paper from inside the book. She opened it and it was a huge map.

“This is...?”

When Lin Xiu saw what it was, he was shocked.

“This is the map of Nanor Planet.”

“It has also noted down the route from the Nanor Planet to the Marqi Planet.”

“Really?”

Lin Xiu was anxious when he heard the news.

If they knew the route from Nanor Planet to the Marqi Planet, they would be able to find a route from earth to the Nanor Planet. Once they got back to earth, they would be able to make a trip to that planet!

“En. Those from the Nanor Planet had initially tried to send signals back to their planet with this but it didn’t work.”

Jiang Ying nodded his head.

“The words on the map have been translated and I noted them on the map itself.”

“Now, I’m giving them to you.”

Jiang Ying gave all of them to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was a little surprised but he still took the books from her.

It seemed like these books were extremely important to him.

“Thank you.”

“You’re welcome. If it wasn’t because of the both of you, I would not be alive today.”

Jiang Ying shook her head. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

After she left, Lin Xiu was still looking at the map.

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and suddenly said, “Do you really have to go?”

Lin Xiu was stunned and stopped on the spot.

He looked at Luo Yue’s beautiful face and said, “Yes, I have to.”

It wasn’t only because he had made a promise with the elder. He also wanted to find the legendary Orchid of Heaven.

“I will definitely find a way to cure you.”

Lin Xiu gently touched Luo Yue’s head and promised her.

Luo Yue was still suffering from the aftermath. She would be unconscious once every two days.

“Oh….this card, it’s for you.”

Lin Xiu seemed to be reminded of something and took out a purple gold card for Luo Yue.

‘Sword breaks the heaven’.

When he first got it, he had been keeping it for Luo Yue. Now that Luo Yue’s abilities have fully recovered, she would be able to start cultivating with this warrior skills card.

“Thank you.”

Luo Yue was stunned as she said to Lin Xiu.

“Do we still have to be so polite with each other?”

Lin Xiu smiled. Suddenly, he had the thought of messing with Lin Xiu, “If you really want to thank me, you can give me a kiss.”

Luo Yue’s eyes that were usually ice cold glared at Lin Xiu and her face turned completely red.

“I was just joking.”

Lin Xiu was about to tell that it was only a joke but his eyes were then covered closed. Then, he suddenly felt a warm feeling on his cheeks.

When Luo Yue removed her eyes from Lin Xiu’s eyes, Luo Yue was already facing away from him.

Lin Xiu subconsciously touched his cheek as there was still warmth felt and he smiled.

“Wait for me!”

Soon, it was the next day.

Lin Xiu, Luo Yue and Luo Yan wore the specially fitted combat suit and brought their bags along as they arrived at the spaceship.

Their spaceship has been completely fixed.

This route belonged to the Luo family.

“Master, do you really have to go?”

An Qi and Qian Ling were looking hesitant as they looked at Lin Xiu.

“Brother Lin, why don’t you stay a little longer?”

Liu Pan asked as well.

“I have already been on this planet for quite some time. I wanna head back to earth.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

“If there’s a chance, we shall meet again.”

“When you get married, you have to invite us!”

An Qi and Qian Ling thought of something before waving their hands.

“Of course.”

Lin Xiu chuckled.

Luo Yue, who was previously emotionless, suddenly turned red like a tomato.

Then, she stomped on Lin Xiu’s foot.

“Oh my, you’re trying to murder your husband!”

Lin Xiu screamed in an exaggerated manner.

“HAHAHAHA!”

Everyone at the scene started laughing.

“Alright, that’s enough. Continue practising the skills that I taught you. I hope to see some improvement when I see you next time.”

Seeing how the stairs were coming down from the space ship, Lin Xiu bid goodbye to both Qian Ling and An Qi.

“Of course! We will!”

An Qi and Qian Lin nodded their heads. Their eyes turned red as well and felt a little sad.

“Liu Pan, you too.”

Lin Xiu smiled at Liu Pan.

“Brother, please take care.”

Liu Pan nodded his head and said sincerely.

“Alright! Let’s go! An Qi, Qian Ling, Liu Pan...Goodbye!”
