Chapter 502: The Kidnapped Ye Shuang’er

Lin Xiu came to his senses and said quickly.

But the caller just hung up!

When Lin Xiu called again, he was informed that the phone was turned off.

Damn it!

“What’s wrong.”

Luo Yue saw this scene at this time and frowned.

“Ye Shuang’er got captured.” Lin Xiu said, the look on his face was a bit nasty.

It was very clear – someone captured Ye Shuang’er and asked him to go over!

Their target was definitely Lin Xiu!

West Industrial Zone…

“I will go over there now.” Lin Xiu said aloud.

But as Lin Xiu spoke, Luo Yue also stood up and seemed to want to follow him.

“You just got hurt, rest here and wait for me to come back, okay?” Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something, then put his hands on Luo Yue’s shoulders and said seriously.

Actually, Luo Yue’s injuries were not serious, but Lin Xiu thought of Luo Yue’s dull eyes just now and felt that Luo Yue was not in the right state at the moment. If Luo Yue was allowed to fight again, he wasn’t sure what might happen.

And when he fell asleep just now, the ‘Cultivation Technique’ was running simultaneously so the source strength in his body had already recovered.

His anger has not been completely vented just now and now someone actually dared to kidnap Ye Shuang’er – simply courting death!

“En.” Luo Yue was silent for a while, then seemed to have thought of something and she nodded.

“Wait for me to come back.” Lin Xiu said with a smile, then subconsciously rubbed Luo Yue’s head.

But Lin Xiu regretted it as soon as he did that; Luo Yue was not Ye Shuang’er, so rubbing her head in this way, she must be angry.

“I’m leaving now.” After Lin Xiu spoke, he picked up his Dark Edge spear and hurried out.

Looking at Lin Xiu’s retreating back, Luo Yue touched her head, her expression seemed a little strange.

At the same time, Lin Xiu was already carrying a Dark Edge spear and was going to the so-called West Industrial Zone.

“Sir, go to the West Industrial Zone.” Lin Xiu called a taxi and said as soon as he got in the car.

Looking at Lin Xiu in the back seat and the blood-stained Dark Edge spear that he was holding, the driver trembled.

“Okay…Okay…” The driver nodded quickly at this time, then drove.

The driver was very nervous at this time, his body was tensed up and the car was driving very fast.

But because it was a magnetic levitation car, even though it was fast, it was exceptionally stable, without the slightest bump.

Lin Xiu looked at the scene flying by outside the window and knitted his brows.

“This is the West Side?” Looking towards the front, Lin Xiu found that his surroundings seemed to be more and more desolate, not at all similar to the prosperous scene just now.

“Yes! Yes!” The driver nodded quickly when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

He seemed to be very afraid of Lin Xiu. At this time, he hurriedly continued to say, “Because there has been a nuclear leakage accident here before, all the factories here have stopped work. Although the nuclear pollution has been dealt with, but no one dares to come here yet…”

The driver quickly told Lin Xiu everything he knew.

Lin Xiu nodded and within a few minutes, through the windshield, he could see a sign with the words ‘West Industrial Zone’ hanging next to a building in front of him.

But it seemed to be quite old, plus with the wind and rain, this sign looked very dirty.

“We’re here.” The driver stepped on the brakes and then stopped.

“How many union coins?” Lin Xiu asked when he was about to get out of the car.

“No, no, it’s free, free!” The driver was anxious but quickly said aloud.

His eyes were still fixed on the blood on the Dark Edge spear that Lin Xiu was holding.

He obviously just killed someone, if Lin Xiu attacked him… he shuddered at the thought.

Lin Xiu felt a little strange, but he didn’t have time to think further. After getting out of the car, he ran to the front.

As the driver said, it seemed that because of the previous nuclear accident, all the factories here have stopped work. Many buildings were constructed only halfway and weren’t completed.

He looked ahead and still didn’t notice anyone.

It was already afternoon and the weather was not very good, it looked a bit gloomy.

Where is he?

Lin Xiu took out his cell phone and when he was about to dial Ye Shuang’er’s phone number, he found that Ye Shuang’er was already calling!

“Continue ahead 300 meters.” A man’s voice came from the other end of the phone.

Same as before, as soon as the message reached Lin Xiu’s ear, the person hung up.

Damn it!

Lin Xiu’s eyes were full of murderous intent, but there was no other way, he had to continue walking forward.

Soon, as Lin Xiu walked over, he found that there were some unfinished buildings around. If he guessed it correctly, they were some apartments for workers, but because of the nuclear accident that year, all of the work was suspended.

Swish swish swish——

Just as Lin Xiu set foot there, he heard a swishing sound from a distance. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He narrowed his eyes and saw laser beams shooting towards him!

The speed of the laser beam was very fast. If it was an ordinary person, the laser beam would have penetrated the body by this time, but for Lin Xiu, this was too easy!

His body moved and he dodged them in an instant.

And while avoiding these laser beams, Lin Xiu accurately grasped the direction of the laser beam shooting.

With a wave of the Dark Edge Spear, several flaming birds rushed in different directions!

“What!!!”

As the phoenixes flew out, the men who were shooting at Lin Xiu while hiding in the unfinished building were covered in flames. The pain caused these people to fall from the stairs.

“Insignificant skill.” Lin Xiu sneered, then raised his head and glanced around, then called out, “Stop playing tricks, come out right now!!!”

Pa pa pa——

Following Lin Xiu’s roar, an applause came from the upper side.

He looked at the building in front and saw Ye Shuang’er on the roof of one of the buildings, she was tied up by a hemp rope and a piece of tape was covering her mouth.

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the pupils in both eyes shrank and his right hand gripped his Dark Edge Spear firmly.
