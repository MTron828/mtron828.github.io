“Llaugh proudly, I laugh proudly...”

“You didn’t take your medicine today?”

‘When it was evening, Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu, who was walking to the auditorium, humming a little song. He seemed very happy and Ouyang Hang’s mouth twitched as he spoke.

Lin Xiu glanced at him and said nothing.

Lin Xiu was in a very good mood that day.

“Did Lin Xiu encounter something good...”

At this time, Huang Zhen also said that it was the first time he had seen Lin Xiu look so happy.

“Apprentice, do you have a fever?”

Baili Haoling reached out and touched Lin Xiu’s forehead, then compared the temperature of her forehead, and said curiously.

“You have a fever!”

Lin Xiu glared at her and said.

“Okay, in the next game, we will fight against the Interstellar Academy. Everyone get ready, we will play soon.”

After everyone joked for awhile, Baili Haoling said seriously to everyone.

Hearing Baili Haoling’s words, everyone nodded.

Especially Huang Zhen and Qian Yao, when Baili Haoling mentioned the Interstellar Academy, their expressions were filled with resentment, and their hands were clenched into fists.

Now the entire stage was lit up, and there were a lot of lights around, making the surrounding environment looked as if it were daytime.

Because the evening was the final, there were some pre-match performances at the beginning.

After the performance, there were speeches from some senior officials of the Warrior Union.

“I announce that the finals of the Huaxia District Warrior Competition have officially begun!”

At this moment, Lin Xiu could clearly see that an old man on the stage announced loudly.

“Hey, isn’t this that darn old man?”

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu realized that this was the old man who was mistaken for a staff member in the Warrior Union Hotel, the vice president of the Warrior Union, and one of the founders of the Sacred Region Academy, Xia Xing!

Damn old man, this is President Xia Xing. Be careful of being beaten to death for saying that.” Ouyang Hang heard Lin Xiu’s words and couldn’t help but say aloud.

Xia Xing had done a lot of legendary deeds in the past. This was his idol. Of course, Ouyang Hang was a little unhappy when he heard Lin Xiu’s arrangement.

“Tsk, this old man is very black-bellied.”

‘Thinking of what happened back then, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but glared at Xia Xing, who looked so noble on stage now.

“It sounds like you know President Xia Xing.”

Ouyang Hang said with a sneer.

“Ido know.”

Lin Xiu nodded and said seriously.

“Haha, I know him too.”

Ouyang Hang laughed, then spread out his hands and said, “But he doesn’t know me.”

Lin Xiu smiled and didn’t argue any more. He remembered that the old man also invited him and Luo Yue to participate in the star warrior assessment of the warrior union, but he almost forgot about it. If he hadn’t seen him today, he would not have remembered.

“The first game is the Sacred Region Academy against Interstellar Academy!”

Soon, the match began. In this first match, Lin Xiu and the others will play!

“Gol”

Lin Xiu carried his spear, and immediately walked over there with a strong fighting spirit.

“Interstellar Academy!”

“Interstellar Academy!”

At the same time, the cheers of the surrounding audience were all shouting the name of the Interstellar Academy, covering up any other voices.

“Tt seems that the Interstellar Academy is very popular.

At this time, the vice president of Sky Academy touched his beard and said to an old man sitting next to him.

“Nah... It’s just that we were lucky enough to win a championship in the previous intercontinental competition. Everyone is familiar with us.”

The deputy dean of the Interstellar Academy said with a smile.

Although the words seem to be very modest, but the tone was full of pride.

“Tsee.”

Bai Litao said with a cold snort, because the Sacred region Academy was relatively low-key, and in the intercontinental competition, the Sacred region Academy was the loser, so of course not many remember the loser’s name.

“Oh? President Baili, you are here too. Last year, we won the intercontinental competition by chance. You don’t need to be too concerned.”

The vice president of the Interstellar Academy smiled and said to Bai Litao not far away.

“Wont be so lucky every year.”

Bai Litao said lightly at this time.

“Yes, luck is unreliable, it depends on real power.”

The deputy dean of the Interstellar Academy smiled, and then continued to say, “I don’t know, this time, how many minutes can your Sacred Region Academy last?”

Provocation, this was definitely provocation.

But Bai Litao was an old fox after all. At this time, he didn’t show his emotions easily on his face. He stroked his beard and said lightly, “You guys are going to lose.”

“Forget it, this old guy is just being tough.” The vice president of Sky Academy said with a cold snort.

Obviously, he was very upset with Bai Litao.

The rest of the high-level personnel who attended the academy did not speak, and they would not participate in the fight, so as not to suffer.

“Tsk tsk, Sacred Region Academy, the one that lost to us in the last intercontinental competition?”

As Lin Xiu and the others stepped onto the competition stage, a man who looked rather short but had a mature face said coldly to Lin Xiu and the others. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“You...”

‘When Qian Yao and Huang Zhen heard the man’s sarcastic voice, their expressions suddenly changed, and they were about to make a move, but they were blocked by Lin Xiu’s outstretched arm.

The competition has not officially started yet, and it was still in the introduction stage. Of course, they couldn’t make a move yet, otherwise it would be considered a violation.

“calm demeanor.”

Baili Haoling said lightly.

‘When Qian Yao and Huang Zhen heard Baili Haoling’s words, they suddenly felt cold all over their bodies.

That’s right, in this situation, they have to be even more careful, they can’t easily get angry and lose their cool.

“Are you from the Interstellar Academy?” Lin Xiu said with a smile to the short man who had just spoken.

“Of course, you are also from Sacred Region Academy? I didn’t see you in the last intercontinental competition, but it seems that you are also weak.”

The little man sneered.

“You are short.”

Lin Xiu looked at him for a moment, and then said aloud.

This sudden remark made everyone in the Interstellar Academy bewildered.

“Humph! You can only let your anger out through your mouth, wait, I’ll let you know what despair is!” Because of the practice of some special skills, the man’s body doesn’t grow tall at all. This has always been a thom in his heart. At this time, Lin Xiu’s words undoubtedly angered him.

“You are short.”

“If you dare to say it again, I will definitely kill you!”

“You are short.”

“ah!!!”
