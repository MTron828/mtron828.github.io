Chapter 990: Ancient Ruins

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The Source stone of darkness has been acquired in the wilderness!

At this moment, a loud voice resounded.

This sound seemed to be transmitted to the entire Sage warrior space.

Lin Xiu was a little speechless at this moment. The founder of the Sage warrior Space was simply deliberately leading people to fight.

But now it seems that there are no other warriors in the wilderness.

Lin Xiu continued to walk ahead.

Along the way, there are many evolved beasts.

But these evolved beasts are all mechanical evolved beasts.

They looked just like the real thing.

With Lin Xiu waving the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he could easily kill them all.

“finally here.”

He wasn’t sure how long it took, but Lin Xiu looked at the front and he could clearly see a large building in the distance.

These buildings were very tall and connected.

It looked like a huge ancient city.

The ancient ruins should be here.

After walking forward for a while, he reached the gate of this ancient city.

The gate was very huge; standing in front of it, you would feel really insignificantly small.

After putting the Dark Edge spear into the expansion space, Lin Xiu stood at the gate.

After taking a deep breath, he placed his hands on both sides of the door.

He pushed hard and in the next moment, an extremely strong force erupted!

Open for me!

Lin Xiu roared in his heart and the strength of his whole body burst out directly.

rumbling rumbling—

As Lin Xiu’s power erupted, the door was slowly opened.

Damn, it’s really heavy.

Now Lin Xiu is a warrior at the Sage warrior level and his strength attribute is very high.

But he didn’t expect that it would be so hard to open the door.

As the door was completely pushed open, Lin Xiu ran in directly.

“The energy source stone of earth has been obtained in the mountains!”

As soon as he entered this ancient ruin, Lin Xiu heard this voice as if it came from the sky.

The source stone of the earth has been obtained!?

Lin Xiu couldn’t help frowning when he heard this.

He originally thought that only he could obtain the energy source stone so quickly, but he didn’t expect that there were other warriors who also obtained the energy source stone.

“I must be quick.”

Lin Xiu said aloud to himself.

After walking into the ancient ruins, he found that his current position was a dark passage.

In the passage, there were only some candles for lighting.

According to the information Wu Hao gave him, this Angel’s tears exist somewhere in this ancient ruins.

He not only had to find this location, but also to defeat the ancient evolved beast that guards the angel’s tears.

That’s right, according to the information given by Wu Hao, this Angel’s Tears is guarded by a real ancient evolved beast.

Moreover, this evolved beast was holy-level.

Almost all the warriors who found the Angel’s Tears died there.

The surviving warriors were disabled.

Whoosh whoosh—

At this time, Lin Xiu just walked in and suddenly heard a whooshing sound breaking through the air.

Thousands of arrows suddenly appeared on the surrounding walls, shooting directly at Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu’s eyes remained unchanged and the “Sphere” unfolded directly.

Immediately, the dark blue ‘Sphere’ unfolded.

Those rain of arrows were all blocked.

Continuing to walk forward, after the rain of arrows disappeared, terrifying laser rays shot out in an instant.

However, it was still completely blocked by Lin Xiu’s “Sphere”.

These mechanisms had no effect on Lin Xiu at all.

After continuing to walk forward for a certain distance, he could see that there was a wide hall in front of him.

clap clap-

At the same time, a round of applause came from the front.

Lin Xiu frowned and looked forward, only to find that there were five warriors standing there in the front hall.

“It seems that another ‘accomplice’ has come.”

One of the women who looked coquettishly dressed said with a smile.

“Whether he’s an ‘accomplice’ or not, we’ll need to test him.”

Another man who looked a little tall and thin said with a cold snort.

The other three men stared at Lin Xiu, but their expressions didn’t change much.

As Lin Xiu walked over, the tall and thin man’s body flashed and disappeared directly in place.

In the next moment, as his figure appeared again, he found that he had appeared in front of Lin Xiu!

He raised his hand and attacked Lin Xiu’s head!

boom–

But at this moment, Lin Xiu also raised his arm lightly and grabbed his fist directly.

The man looked at his fist that was caught and the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

Just when he was about to raise his foot to attack Lin Xiu’s body, Lin Xiu had already raised his foot and kicked him in the abdomen.

He flew out directly!

Boom—

His body directly slammed into the wall behind him.

made a loud noise.

“It seems that the newcomer has good skills.”

The coquettish woman looked at Lin Xiu, licked her lips, then said.

“Damn…”

The man who was kicked out by Lin Xiu slowly got up at this time and wiped the blood from his lips.

Looking at Lin Xiu, his eyes were full of hostility.

“Hello, let me introduce myself, Ji Mei.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The woman looked at Lin Xiu, then said to Lin Xiu.

This woman looks very seductive and it was difficult for ordinary people to look away when they see her.

But after Lin Xiu just glanced at her, he looked around.

“Hey, I’m talking to you.”

Ji Mei looked at Lin Xiu ignoring her directly, she was stunned for a moment, then said with a little dissatisfaction.

She was used to being watched yet Lin Xiu ignored her, which made her feel a little uncomfortable.

“If I guess correctly, you are all invited by Wu Hao.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“bingo.”

Ji Mei continued to speak at this time.

“With you, we have a total of six warriors. It seems that we can go to that place.”

“Have you found where the Angel’s tears is?”

Lin Xiu said aloud at this time.

Although the information Wu Hao gave him before was quite complete, the ancient ruins are too large and it is still not that easy to find that place.

“certainly.”

Ji Mei smiled and said.

“You are Lin Xiu, right.”

At this time, another man looked at Lin Xiu and said suddenly.

“You can kill both Huangfu Tian and Huangfu Lin, you’re an expert.”

The other two men also looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“This guy is that Lin Xiu?”

The man who had just been knocked out by Lin Xiu came over at this time.

When he came over, he discovered the source rings on Lin Xiu’s arm.

There are… more than thirty!!!
