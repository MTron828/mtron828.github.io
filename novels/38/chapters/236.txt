Chapter 237: Sphere!

Everyone was stunned by his actions.

If Lin Xiu got struck by the skill, he would definitely lose!

And his life might even be in danger!

But Lin Xiu stared straight at the skill and did not cower back at all.

He held Dark Edge tightly and in the next moment, continued to attack!

“Seeking death!” Yu Yi roared with rage when he saw Lin Xiu’s action.

Yu Yi was infuriated at the fact that Lin Xiu disregarded his attack and retaliated. He forced even more source strength into the skill.

This caused his sword to become even faster!

Clank clank clank-

The spear danced in Lin Xiu’s hands when a series of loud zooming sounds flew over.

All the lotus petals formed from source strength charged over and were destroyed by Lin Xiu’s spear.

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s spear collided into Yu Yi’s sword.

Rumble-

The collision of source strength instantly produced a loud explosion.

Lin Xiu and Yu Yi both took two steps back at the same time.

Yu Yi’s eyes were wide opened and felt blood surging from his throat to his mouth, but he endured it and swallowed it back down.

He looked at Lin Xiu with disbelief in his eyes.

‘Why! Why is he able to unleash such power when he is only a rank 5 warrior!?’

All the spectators were stunned by the aftermath.

They thought that Lin Xiu would be severely injured from Yu Yi’s skill. In the end, Lin Xiu had forced an attack and actually forced Yu Yi back!

It was too inconceivable.

“Awe of the Phoenix!!!”

Lin Xiu snorted and swung his spear upwards. At the same time, a large number of flames burst forth.

All of the flames turned into flaming birds and flew out from the speartip!

Lin Xiu had suffered light injuries from the clash but it did not matter to him.

Although Lin Xiu looked like an ordinary rank 5 warrior, he had successfully unlocked the second gene lock.

The power of his flesh body was already comparable to a peak rank 6 warrior!

“Puny skill!” Yu Yi snorted at the attack and swung his sword out again.

He did not believe that a rank 5 warrior could pose that much of a threat to him!

Upon thinking so, he held his sword tighter and unleashed his body skill. His entire being moved like a phantom and charged straight for Lin Xiu!

He dodged all of Lin Xiu’s flaming birds!

He had studied Lin Xiu’s skill prior to the battle and the flaming birds were nothing to him.

Clank-

But Lin Xiu was not slow in reacting as well. He held Dark Edge and blocked Yu Yi’s attack.

And the flaming birds that were released turned back and charged at Yu Yi from behind.

Each and every flaming bird emitted extremely high temperatures and caused the air around them to distort.

Yu Yi’s face changed at the sight of this and immediately discarded his intention of continuing his attack and quickly moved to the side.

Sou sou sou-

The flaming birds were extremely fast and already caught up to him.

Yu Yi’s expression became serious.

He was able to sense that the temperatures of the birds were abnormal.

He could only dodge them.

‘What is going on!?’

‘Why does his skill feel even stronger than before!?’

As he had fought against Lin Xiu before, he knew all of Lin Xiu’s skills.

Although the blazing birds looked terrifying, they did not pose a threat to him.

But what shocked him was that the blazing birds’ temperature had risen to a terrifying degree.

As long as they touched his body, he would feel a burning sensation. It was simply too shocking!

“Rise!!!” Yu Yi’s eyes grew large as he saw the blazing birds rushing towards him from all angles and he bellowed out loud.

A large burst of source strength spewed out from his body! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

With his body as the center, a defensive structure of source strength covered him up!

It was a high-level utilization of source strength – Sphere!

He had formed a barrier with his own source strength and covered himself up.

The stronger the source strength, the more powerful the defensive capability of the barrier!

“Isn’t that the ‘sphere’ that can only be used by rank 6 warriors and above!?” A few warriors were stunned by Yu Yi.

All the blazing birds struck the defensive barrier!

Rumble rumble-

A series of explosions occurred while Yu Yi was unaffected inside the barrier.

All the blazing birds that exploded on the defensive barrier did not pose the slightest threat against Yu Yi!!

“Damn it, the sphere used by rank 6 warriors, this is extremely disadvantageous for Lin Xiu…” Zhang Yin and the others became worried and clenched their fists.

All the warriors knew the dividing range between rank 5 and rank 6.

Even a peak rank 5 warrior would be far inferior to a warrior that had become rank 6.

Yu Yi sustained the barrier and blocked all the blazing birds, making the spectators believe that Lin Xiu no longer had any chance to win.

“Seems like that’s rather strong.” Lin Xiu squinted his eyes and spoke to Yu Yi as he maintained the barrier.

“Hahaha, I’ve long seen through your skills, you can’t harm me!” Yu Yi watched as the blazing birds disintegrated.

He then laughed out loud and replied.

He was not afraid of Lin Xiu regardless of how strong his skills were, since only rank 6 warriors could unleash ‘sphere’.

Once he finished his sentence, he suddenly shot forward with sword in hand and unleashed crescent sword qi that shot through the barrier towards Lin Xiu!

Sou sou sou-

The transparent sword qis were like blades made out of the wind that flew at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu avoided them with his quick reflexes but was able to sense the piercing pain on his cheeks as they swept past him.

It was true, the gulf between rank 6 and rank 5 warriors was still a bit too large.

But it was not enough to make him fearful!
