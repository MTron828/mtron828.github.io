Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu’s body had already flown out a good distance at this time.

In the next moment, he stabilized his body.

“What a terrifying power of ice…”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

The power that the ice crystal sea snake burst out just now made him fly here.

!!

And fortunately, he has a very strong resistance to the power of ice, otherwise, the blow just now would have an impact on him.

Looking ahead, those Sage warriors were still fighting the ice crystal sea snake.

The white energy spat out by those ice crystal sea snakes hit the body of a Sage warrior who was caught off guard.

That Sage warrior’s body instantly turned into an ice sculpture!

pata——

As he turned into an ice sculpture-like body and fell from the sky, his body instantly shattered into countless pieces.

A warrior of the Sage warrior level just fell.

These ice crystal sea snakes are different from ordinary beast saint-level evolved beasts.

Too powerful.

The surrounding Sage warriors looked at the dead Sage warrior, their eyes filled with horror.

At this time, they didn’t dare to relax at all.

Lin Xiu looked at the scene in the distance and continued to rush over!

He had his ‘Sphere’ unfolded the whole time.

Under the current circumstances, if the protection of the ‘Sphere’ was not deployed, it would be dangerous if he got hit by the energy spat out by those ice crystal sea snakes. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At this time, there were as many as six ice crystal sea snakes rushing out from the ground.

The body was huge, it didn’t look like a snake, but like a dragon.

The moment Lin Xiu’s body flew over, one of the ice crystal sea snakes flicked its tail toward Lin Xiu!

boom–

Lin Xiu’s body turned sideways, then he dodged directly.

And at this moment, the Dark Edge spear held in both hands swung directly into the air.

Boom—

One after another flaming birds burst out from the spear in an instant.

He charged towards the ice crystal sea snake.

The Ice Crystal Sea Snake clearly noticed the flaming birds that were charging over and at this moment, it made a loud roar and from its mouth, many white light clusters were sprayed out.

boom boom boom —

These white energies directly charged toward the flaming birds that were charging toward them.

boom–

The flaming birds collided with the white energy they ejected and a huge sudden sound suddenly erupted.

Those flaming birds were quickly dissipated by those white energies.

Damn it!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu cursed inwardly.

In the next moment, he held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and used the ‘Flashing Souls’ movement technique.

As Lin Xiu’s figure flashed, in the next moment, Lin Xiu appeared on the other side.

At this time, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, Lin Xiu waved it wildly.

It directly attacked the body of the ice crystal sea snake.

bang bang bang-

The body of the ice crystal sea snake was really too big and Lin Xiu’s speed was too fast, it didn’t have any chance to dodge at all.

Lin Xiu’s attacks all hit its body.

But the body of this ice crystal sea snake was too hard.

Under such a fierce attack by Lin Xiu, there was no way to penetrate its body.

It just knocked off some ice crystals on the outer layer of its body.

The rest of the Sage warriors also fell into a hard fight at this time.

“I don’t believe that…”

Lin Xiu’s figure kept dodging and while dodging its counterattacks, the Dark Edge spear in his hand was filled with dark blue flames.

The Dark Edge spear covered with flames continued to attack the body of the ice crystal sea snake.

This time, the Dark Edge spear filled with the flames of hell penetrated its body!

Moreover, the flames on the body of the Dark Edge spear, as they penetrated the body of the ice crystal sea snake, directly melted its body like ice crystals.

Roar–

The ice crystal sea snake seemed to feel severe pain and at this time, it made a loud roar.

Its tail swung wildly and it was about to slam into Lin Xiu’s body.

However, Lin Xiu’s reaction speed was very fast. After using the ‘Flashing Souls’ movement technique, his figure kept dodging.

This ice crystal sea snake had no way to attack Lin Xiu.

And looking closely, there was a huge hole in the place where the ice crystal sea snake was penetrated by Lin Xiu just now.

The ice crystal sea snake also seemed to be in pain because of this wound and kept roaring.

The rest of the Sage warriors also continued to use powerful skills to attack the ice crystal sea snakes at this time.

Soon, the ice crystals on the body of the ice crystal sea snakes were falling at a speed visible to the naked eye.

It spat out a lot of white energy from its mouth like it was its last struggle.

Lin Xiu saw this scene in his eyes and clenched the Dark Edge spear tightly with both hands.

As the source strength was transmitted to the body of the Dark Edge spear, the entire body of the spear was covered by dark blue flames.
