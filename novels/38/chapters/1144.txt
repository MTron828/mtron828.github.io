1145 Warrior God!

Damn!

Seeing how there were flaming birds coming at him, the look in Bai Qi’s eyes changed.

He quickly waved his right arm and the water from the small steam from behind him, flew into the air!

As Bai Qi light both his hands in the air, the water turned into a huge water dragon that went after the flaming birds!

Boom – –

With the sizzling sound, the flaming birds and the water dragon that collided with each other, instantly disappeared.

Then, Lin Xiu’s body appeared right in front of Bai Qi!

Lin Xiu held onto his long spear and aimed it towards Bai Qi’s body!

Clang – –

The look on Bai Qi’s face changed drastically and he quickly tried to block it with his sword.

However, the strong, terrifying impact that came from the spear caused Bai Qi’s body to be pushed far behind.

Lin Xiu did not give any chance to Bai Qi to breathe. He held onto his long spear and started attacking Bai Qi frantically.

Destiny Spear Art!

The skill that Lin Xiu used was incredibly powerful. Bai Qi wanted to attack Lin Xiu at the same time but the power of Lin Xiu’s warrior skills were too strong.

Damn it!!

Bai Qi didn’t even have the chance to attack.

Instead, the only thing that he could do was block Lin Xiu’s attack with his sword.

Boom boom boom – –

Along with the loud explosion, Bai Qi’s body flew backwards uncontrollably.

The look in both his eyes was looking incredibly awful as well.

‘Heaven Breaking Strike!’

Lin Xiu quickly realised that his time was up but without any hesitation, he immediately released the warrior skill!

This was bad!

Bai Qi could obviously feel that there was a terrifying energy that was coming from Lin Xiu and he had a bad feeling about it.

Bai Qi then tried to block it with his body!

However, Lin Xiu did not give him the chance to do so.

His spear was already thrusted forward.

Boom – –

Although Bai Qi already had his ‘sphere’ released, he could still feel a huge explosion happening with how terrifying Lin Xiu’s attack was.

His ‘sphere’ instantly exploded!

Pfft – –

A mouthful of fresh blood came out of Bai Qi’s mouth and his entire body was thrown far into the distance. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Bai Qi was stronger than any other warriors found on this planet.

‘Heaven Breaking Strike’ was only able to break his ‘sphere’ and it did not kill Bai Qi.

‘Reset’!

When Lin Xiu realised his time for ‘Rage’ was over, he quickly activated ‘Reset’ and used ‘Rage’ again.

He did not stop and Lin Xiu dashed forward, continuing his attack on bai Qi.

Xiu – –

Lin Xiu was moving at an extremely fast speed and soon he stood right in front of Bai Qi once again.

At the same time, Lin Xiu was waving his long spear in the end and ready to attack Bai Qi.

He was prepared to kill Bai Qi!

“Don’t you dare!!!”

As Lin Xiu moved his long spear, there was a loud explosion that came from a distant away.

Lin Xiu’s pupil narrowed subconsciously when he heard the sound.

It was a loud one and Lin Xiu realised that this wasn’t a simple explosion. Before he knew what was happening, Lin Xiu’s body was like a kite that has been cut off from its string.

Pfft – –

Lin Xiu, who finally got to steady himself, spat out a mouthful of blood.

He stabbed the long spear into the ground in order to stabilise his body before looking up. Then, he noticed that there was a black figure that was coming at him.

Who was it?!

“Ancestor!”

Bai Qi held onto his chest as he turned around. His eyes were filled with surprise.

From the looks of it, this old man seemed to be incredibly powerful.

“Hmph! The Bai family turned out this way?”

The old man walked closer to them as he spoke in a cold tone.

Bai Qi did not say a word but his eyes were locked onto Lin Xiu and they were filled with murderous intention.

Lin Xiu frowned as well.

This was because Lin Xiu could clearly feel that this old man was extremely strong.

He subconsciously used his Analytical Eyes but he soon realised that he couldn’t read this man!

How was this even possible?!

Lin Xiu’s pupils shrink due to the shock.

There was only one possibility whenever he couldn’t read another warrior’s stat.

This man….was a warrior god!

As Lin Xiu thought of it, the look in his eyes changed.

Logically speaking, there shouldn’t be a warrior god on this planet.

But, if he remembered correctly, this man would have been hiding in the cemetery of the Bai family and with some mysterious ways, he was able to hide from the guardian like Elder Ye.

This was how this old man could stay hidden for so long even when he was a warrior god.

“You’re from the Ye family huh...?

The old man looked at Lin Xiu and suddenly his figure was standing right in front of Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

He raised his arm and then aimed it at Lin Xiu’s body!

Although Lin Xiu could already see it coming and had released his ‘sphere’, the horrifying impact was still strong enough to cause Lin Xiu to fly.

Then, he landed heavily on one of the buildings behind him.

Blood was coming out of Lin Xiu’s mouth continuously.

‘Source Strength Control’!

Lin Xiu had no other choice but to immediately activate this skill.

Soon, there was a large amount of energy that started gathering towards Lin Xiu.

“Hmm?”

The elder frowned as well. He could clearly feel that the energy in his body was getting attracted towards Lin Xiu’s body.

However, he quickly controlled it with his mind. All of the energy that he had lost energy was all getting pulled back toward his body.

‘Silence’!

Lin Xiu did not attack the elder immediately; instead, he activated another skill.

With the use of ‘Silence’, Lin Xiu’s dark element energy stone was giving out its energy as well.

There were small black particles that rushed forward!

As the black particles gathered together, all of the plants around them wilt instantly!

“It’s ‘Silence’!”

Bai Qi was shocked when he saw what was happening.

“Hmph! This is nothing to me!”

The old man looked at the black particles that were getting closer to him and he started to look worried.

However, there was a bright, gold light that was slowly getting released from his body.

All of them slowly formed a golden ‘sphere’!

As the black particles rushed onto the gold ‘sphere’, it was impossible for them to penetrate into it.

The ‘sphere’ was able to stop all of them!

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but feel surprised when he saw what was happening.

‘Silence’ didn’t work on him?!
