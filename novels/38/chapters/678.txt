“Like me?”

Lin Xiu pointed to his eyes and said aloud.

“En, some have brown or black pupils.”

Liu Yanran nodded and said.

“But…”

Saying this, she seemed a little hesitant.

“Speak.”

Lin Xiu raised his brows, and then said lightly.

When Liu Yanran heard Lin Xiu’s words, her body trembled slightly.

She thought of Lin Xiu’s terrifying strength in the forest just now, as well as his ruthlessness and she was even more afraid. At this time, she didn’t think much about it and said directly, “On the Margi planet, except for

the people with light blue pupils who are considered normal citizens, people with pupils of other colors are… inferior citizens.”

Liu Yanran still spoke aloud.

She looked at Lin Xiu carefully, as if she was afraid that Lin Xiu would get angry.

“Oh, I see.”

Lin Xiu didn’t react at all.

Seeing this, Liu Yanran heaved a sigh of relief.

Soon, with Liu Yanran leading the way, Lin Xiu and her came to the city gate.

“It’s just to check if we’re a wanted criminal or not.”

Liu Yanran looked at the two guards in front of them who were using scanners to scan the people who came in and out and said.

Lin Xiu nodded slightly and didn’t say anything.

As they walked to the gate of the city, a security guard took a special scanner and scanned Lin Xiu’s whole body.

Once this scanner scans, it will compare the appearance, bones, and body of a person. If the person is a wanted criminal, it will reveal that.

“Go in.”

The guard gave Lin Xiu a disdainful look, and then said aloud.

It seemed like what Liu Yanran had said, these guards with light blue pupils seemed to be very disdainful of him as an ‘inferior citizen’.

“Miss Liu, this way please.”

However, Liu Yanran had a very high status. The guard over there seemed to know her and spoke to her respectfully.

After walking into this city gate, Lin Xiu immediately discovered that the scene inside the city was not very different from Sky City.

The streets were full of various maglev vehicles. The whole city was very prosperous, with many people coming and going.

Without the Analytic eye, Lin Xiu was still able to sense the strength of these people using his own instincts.

They were all very different.

[t’s no wonder that the people of Marqi Planet look down on the people of the earth. Many of these warriors on the streets were of the seventh rank in overall strength.

And this was just one of the small cities on the Margi planet.

if it is the main city…

He looked to the front, and saw a very tall building in the distance. There was a huge white dragon sculpture on the building. It looked lifelike and very spectacular.

“This is the largest building in our Tianlong City.”

Liu Yanran looked at Lin Xiu’s eyes and looked into the distance, and suddenly said a little proudly.

“Well, it’s alright.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Benefactor, why don’t you go to my house first, I will host you well.”

After entering the city, Liu Yanran also seemed to relax, and said to Lin Xiu at this time.

“No, I want to ask, how to go to Fengyun City?”

Lin Xiu waved his hand and asked.

“Fengyun City?”

“If you go from here, the distance is still very far, and recently, Fengyun City is preparing to hold the annual warrior conference. There is no direct train now, and you can’t take the aircraft to go there.”

Liu Yanran thought for a while, then said helplessly.

“And this matter.”

Lin Xiu frowned suddenly.

At first, Lin Xiu wanted to arrive sooner, but now it seemed that it would not be so easy.

“You can go to Ice and Snow City first, and then take the underground train there. There is a route there that can go directly to Fengyun City.”

Liu Yanran continued to speak at this time.

“Can I rent an aircraft?”

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then said aloud.

f he flew the aircraft by himself, it should be faster.

“No, there is martial law in the city now. If you don’t go there through the formal route, you will be shot down by the laser before you reach there.”

Liu Yanran’s face also became serious at this time, she shook her head and said.

n this case, it was indeed more troublesome.

Lin Xiu felt a little sad.

“Benefactor, you can take a train to Ice and Snow City tomorrow, then transfer to Fengyun City.”

Liu Yanran said aloud at this time.

“There is only one train going to Ice and Snow City every month. My family is a decent family in this small city. I will ask them to help you get a ticket. There should be no problem.”

“Alright.”

Lin Xiu thought for a moment, then nodded.

He was new here, so he didn’t know much about the situation here.

Moreover, looking at Liu Yanran’s expression, she probably wouldn’t lie to him. Rather than going around like a headless fly, he’d better rest first and assess the situation. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“You can take a rest at our house first, and I’ll let you arrange a room for you.”

Liu Yanran said.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu did not refuse at this time.

And according to the attitude of the guards to her just now, this woman’s family should have some status here.

With her leading, Lin Xiu quickly walked to the other side.

When walking on the road, many people greeted Liu Yanran, and those people’s eyes all looked towards Lin Xiu, and there seemed to be some contempt in their eyes.

After all, the current Lin Xiu looked like a middle-aged man with a sparse beard and dust on his clothes, making him look a bit sloppy.

“Just walk over from here.”

When she walked to the front, Liu Yanran said to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly. Up ahead was a very tall building. Above the wide doorway was an archway that read: “Liu Mansion” in gilded characters.

There are a lot of guards at the door, holding laser guns in their hands, patrolling back and forth.

“Miss!”

As soon as Liu Yanran walked over, the guards said respectfully.

“This is my friend.”

When the guard over there looked at Lin Xiu, Liu Yanran said lightly.

Although these guards looked at Lin Xiu with a little bit of unfriendliness, but since Liu Yanran had spoken, they didn’t dare to say anything and stepped aside.

“Liu Yanran, you are really becoming more and more promising. Where did you find a wild man who dared to bring it into our Liu family.”

Not long after Lin Xiu walked in, a sneer came from the other side..
