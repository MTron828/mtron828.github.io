Chapter 430: Because You Don’t Have To Go Up

Impossible. What would he benefit from destroying the circuit?

Taking such a big risk, leaving everyone without electricity?

“You look a little nervous.” Yu Muchen said, looking at Ouyang Hang.

He looked at Ouyang Hang’s eyes as if he could see through his heart.

“A bit, after all, I have lost under his hands.” Ouyang Hang nodded and said.

“You don’t need to be nervous.” Yu Muchen shook his head and said with a smile.

“Because you don’t have to go up today.”

“What!?” Hearing Yu Muchen’s words, Ouyang Hang’s expression changed, and exclaimed, “I’m the class monitor of Class 1, why can’t I go up!”

“Don’t get too agitated first.” Yu Muchen looked at Ouyang Hang’s reaction as if he wasn’t surprised at all.

“Your strength has reached rank 6, right?”

“Of course.” Ouyang Hang nodded proudly. Although he was not as perverted as Yu Muchen, at this age, being able to reach rank 6 was very remarkable already. It could be said that he was a genius among geniuses.

“They are also rank six.” Yu Muchen pointed at the four men sitting across him.

“What!?”

Seeing the four men sitting in a row, Ouyang Hang was in disbelief.

“Impossible! How could they be so fast!”

After all, it was not easy to go from rank 5 to 6.

It should be very challenging!

The four men were originally among the top five in the class and were merely slightly worse than Ouyang Hang.

At this time, they saw Ouyang Hang’s shocked appearance and the corners of their mouths curled up, showing a look of disdain.

After all, everyone was gifted and they weren’t happy that Ouyang Hang was stronger than them.

Seeing Ouyang Hang’s shocked look, they suddenly became very proud.

“Unfold your ‘Sphere’ for Young Master Hang.” Yu Muchen glanced at them, then said with a smile.

At this moment, a faint blue light appeared on the bodies of the four men.

In just an instant, those blue rays formed a blue protective shield and appeared on their bodies.

The important symbol of a rank 6 warrior was the ability to unfold the ‘Sphere’!!!

“You gave them the forbidden medicine!?” Ouyang Hang looked at Yu Muchen with a shocked expression on his face.

Four rank 6! Suddenly four rank 6 appeared!

Other than the use of forbidden medicine, he couldn’t think of any way to break through to rank 6 in such a short period of time.

“No, of course I won’t do this kind of thing. They are not fools. Who would take the forbidden medicine for a mere match?” Yu Muchen said, spreading his hands.

“Then how did you do it?” Ouyang Hang looked at Yu Muchen’s eyes and said seriously.

Yu Muchen’s mouth curled up, and then muttered one word, “Secret.”

“You…” Seeing Yu Muchen’s appearance, Ouyang Hang was so angry that his hands were clenched into fists.

If Yu Muchen wasn’t much stronger than him, he would have thrown a fist.

“Anyway, you don’t need to play this time, after all, it’s a 5V5 battle.” Yu Muchen said with a faint smile on his face.

“Their coordination is much better than yours.”

“Hmph! Then I wish you victory.” Although Ouyang Hang was angry in his heart, there was not much change in expression on his face and he said with a cold snort.

After all, Ouyang Hang was also from a big family, and he controlled his expression very well.

“Don’t worry, under my leadership, it is impossible for the North Campus to lose.” Yu Muchen said with confidence.

But his words made Ouyang Hang want to vomit blood in anger.

“Under his leadership” which meant that under Ouyang Hang’s leadership, the North Campus Class 1 would lose?

“Why hasn’t Lin Xiu come yet?” At the same time, Zhang Yin and others were already around the seating area of Class 10 of the South Campus.

Because the match today was against the North Campus and they suddenly had a rank 7 warrior, Yu Muchen, who was much stronger than Ouyang Hang, the difficulty of this battle had risen to the extreme.

And there were so many people who came to this match. After the entire field was filled with people, there were a large number of people surrounding the platform.

“Maybe he’s coming later, there’s still fifteen minutes left.” Li Ping looked at the gate, and there were many associations walking in but Lin Xiu could not be seen.

“It’s finally about to start.”

At the same time, Lin Xiu, who was on the side of the martial arts field, was already wearing a silver battle suit at this time, with a Dark Edge spear in his hand and slowly walking in.

Lin Xiu tied a long ponytail and looked a bit like an ancient warrior, which attracted the attention of many people.

“I don’t know who took the odd crystals in my room – they’re gone!”

As Lin Xiu walked in, he heard that many students around him seemed to be discussing something.

“Damn, mine too, I don’t know who stole them. I hid them very well yet they were still stolen.”

“My tempered glass seemed like it got frozen directly and exploded. I suspect that the person who stole the thing got in like this.”

The discussion of these students was quite loud and Lin Xiu suddenly choked when he recalled something and was a little bit dumbfounded.

Sounds like the odd crystals that the little ice crystal white bird and Rollie had stolen ah!

This was just a brief interlude as Lin Xiu entered.

“He’s here.” As Lin Xiu walked in, Yu Muchen looked over there, and he could easily sense Lin Xiu.

En? He feels a little different. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

After seeing Lin Xiu, Yu Muchen instinctively felt that the Lin Xiu today was a bit different from what he had seen before.

“This guy is really showy.”

Looking at Lin Xiu deliberately making such a long braid and wearing a silver battle suit, did he think he was playing a costume drama?

“Lin Xiu! You are finally here!” Zhang Yin and the others immediately said with excitement when they saw Lin Xiu approaching.

“Damn, Lin Xiu, this is really cool!” Li Ping couldn’t help exclaiming when he saw Lin Xiu’s current appearance.

There were many girls in the class who had a good impression of Lin Xiu, and their eyes couldn’t peel away from him.

Because the scorched skin fell off and Lin Xiu’s skin was glowing now.

“The match is about to start! Both parties, please prepare quickly!”
