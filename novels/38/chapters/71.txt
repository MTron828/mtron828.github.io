Chapter 72: Unanalyzable Tang Tian

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

‘This is bad!!!’

Luo Li couldn’t help but worry about Lin Xiu.

Although Lin Xiu had just defeated Ye Gulin, he hadn’t fully recovered his physical strength yet. Now that he had to deal with two men’s all-out attacks who were ranked 10th and 12th, it was very dangerous!

However, what’s strange was that Lin Xiu didn’t panic at all.

With the spear in his hand, he looked like he was waiting for a chance.

“Give up!!!” Jiang Tao and Zhu Jun roared at the same time. And as the two men attacked Lin Xiu with their skills, the ground shook again and dust flew everywhere.

“He won.” Mr. Ye narrowed his eyes and looked slightly surprised.

“En, those two are Jiang Tao and Zhu Jun, who are ranked 10th and 12th in the combat strength list.” A school leader who was sitting next to Mr. Ye was very good at observing one’s body language and immediately spoke up.

“No, I’m not referring to them.”

As the dust dispersed, everyone looked at the field and the stage was quite destroyed because of the skill used just now.

But these were not what everyone paid attention to, what they cared about was the winner.

“It’s... it’s impossible, right?”

After the students saw the scene clearly, their eyes were wide open.

Some even rubbed their eyes in disbelief to make sure they were not seeing things.

“He won! Lin Xiu won!” Yang Tian opened his mouth, then exclaimed in surprise.

That’s right, Lin Xiu was still holding the spear in his hand. He had some wounds on his body and appeared a little bit sloppy.

But Jiang Tao and Zhu Jun were lying on both sides of the stage and were covered in bruises.

“How is that possible…” Both of their eyes widened like they couldn’t believe what just happened.

Both of them used their strongest skills, how on earth did Lin Xiu resist and fight back?

“No. 1024 Lin Xiu... wins!” The referee was stunned for a moment before he came to his senses and announced.

Zhang Lin looked at Lin Xiu with a gloomy expression. ‘What the hell is going on? How did this guy win again?’

“Is there a video recording?” At this moment, Tang Tian came over from the other side and said as he looked at Zhang Lin.

He had finished the match earlier and had just seen Lin Xiu defeating Jiang Tao and Zhu Jun.

But it was so fast that he couldn’t react. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Yes, yes.” Zhang Lin nodded and quickly answered.

He went to the back of the seats and began finding the recording of the match just now on the computer. The match between Lin Xiu and Jiang Tao and Zhu Jun was definitely recorded.

“Right here, slow the video down.”

Tang Tian stared at that scene. What exactly did Lin Xiu do in the last part to defeat both people at the same time?

If he didn’t know about it, it would be very disadvantageous for him during the match later on.

Lin Xiu also walked over at this moment and heaved a sigh of relief. He was really lucky; if he didn’t learn ‘Adjudicate’ and learned that ‘Rainbow Pierces the Sun’, he would be in danger this time.

‘Adjudicate’ was different from other skills; its theory was according to this saying “A taste of your own medicine”, which allowed the other party’s skill to be directed back at themselves!

But there were limits to using this move. If the opponent was stronger than him, it might fail and he would suffer more harm.

“How on earth did you do that?” Luo Li looked at Lin Xiu and was very shocked.

“I used my skill as well.” Lin Xiu didn’t say much and smiled faintly.

The list of the top 12 students appeared and other than Lin Xiu and Tang Tian, the rest were mostly the top 10 students of the combat strength list.

And for the results of the draw this time, Lin Xiu was actually going to be up against Tang Tian!!!

“Lin Xiu, the road is narrow for enemies.” Yang Tian looked at the 3D projection that displayed the results and covered his mouth in surprise.

“It seems like I can kill you in the first round.” Tang Tian came over to Lin Xiu’s side at this moment and sneered.

“You? Weren’t you defeated in the hands of Lin Xiu the last time, huh!” Yang Tian heard the arrogance in Tang Tian’s words and couldn’t help but speak up.

Yang Tian’s words obviously stung Tang Tian’s heart and his eyes constricted at this moment as he threw a punch toward Yang Tian.

He was very fast and Yang Tian’s pupils narrowed, but it was too late to dodge!

Bang!

In a split second, a fist appeared from the side and collided with Tang Tian’s fist.

Tang Tian’s eyes widened in disbelief and he took a step back. When he looked up, he saw Lin Xiu standing in front of Yang Tian.

“This isn’t very nice, huh?” Lin Xiu sneered. If he didn’t take that punch just now, Yang Tian would be severely hurt.

This chap was too brutal. If not for his father charging out all of a sudden previously, Lin Xiu would have killed him directly.

And within about a month, Tang Tian seemed to have become a different person, his warrior’s aura seemed much stronger.

“I’ll let you live through tonight, you’ll find out during tomorrow’s showdown.” Tang Tian scoffed then left.

He still had a smile on his face at this moment because from the video just now, he already found a way of dealing with Lin Xiu’s move.

Looking at Tang Tian’s retreating figure, Lin Xiu frowned, then activated the Analytic Eye.

Not long after, Lin Xiu wanted to see the data but was taken aback.

“Analysis failed.”

‘Analysis failed!? How is that possible!’

‘Does it mean that Tang Tian’s strength has reached the level of a rank 3 warrior?’

Lin Xiu was shocked. He was just a quasi-warrior a month back and he didn’t have a system like Lin Xiu, so how did he improve so quickly?

All the matches, including the final match, were all happening the next day so he had to use the remaining time to rest.

Back in the dormitory, Lin Xiu sat at the bedside and looked at the Silver Immortal Soul spear that had accompanied him for more than a month. Due to the constant infusion of source strength to fight, there were slight cracks at the top.

It probably couldn’t be used soon.

With a helpless sigh, Lin Xiu turned on the computer and went to the Warrior Union website.
