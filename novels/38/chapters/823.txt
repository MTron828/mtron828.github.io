Chapter 824: Hair As White As Snow

The ‘Sphere’ on Luo Jiucheng’s body instantly burst!

“Go to hell!!!”

Lin Xiu, whose eyes were red, stabbed hundreds of spears the moment his ‘Sphere’ burst apart!

boom–

Luo Jiucheng’s body exploded in the next moment, shattering into flesh and blood all over the floor.

Dead without a corpse!

But Lin Xiu, who was furious, was already crazy.

Looking at the King warriors over there, they continued to attack!

“Courting death!!!”

Those King warriors were shocked and frightened when they saw that Lin Xiu had just killed Luo Jiucheng. At this time, they also directly unfolded the “Sphere” of their bodies and at the same time using a large number of skills with a strong range to charge at Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu unfolded his ‘Sphere’ without dodging at all and attacked those King warriors directly!

After upgrading to the King warrior level, all system skills were refreshed again.

Lin Xiu kept using the system skills ‘Fury’ and ‘Heavenly Array.’

And at this time, the sky was covered with dark clouds and there were constant thunder and lightning in the sky.

Whoosh whoosh—

Lin Xiu’s speed was extremely fast, his figure flashed continuously and he appeared in front of those King warriors.

There are a lot of dark blue flames on the Dark Edge spear.

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t use any skill, just basic marksmanship and attacked them frantically at close range.

Their seemingly solid ‘Sphere’ was directly smashed by Lin Xiu’s spear!

The spear pierced and the spear grabbed the meat.

One, two, three...

The bodies of these warrior king-level warriors were directly stabbed with hundreds of thousands of blood holes.

Kill them all!

At this time, the soldiers and warriors in Fengyun City also rushed over in large numbers, rushing towards Luo Yue and Luo Yan, who were protected by the matrix.

Get out of here!

Lin Xiu roared, the spear in his hand danced and a large number of dark blue flaming birds burst out with the spear.

Fly over there!

Thousands of flaming birds converged into a huge flame of madness, forming a huge flame tornado that charged over there!

The thousands of warriors who rushed over were directly swept into this flame tornado!

They didn’t even have time to let out the wailing and screams and in the next moment, they were directly annihilated by the terrifying flame tornado.

“The farce is over.”

In the air, Huang Ying, who was like a god in the sky, looked at Lin Xiu below and said coldly.

This time, the casualties in Fengyun City were too serious.

He never imagined that a young man would possess such terrifying power.

His right hand stretched out and a large amount of white light gathered in the palm of his hand.

At the next moment, a huge beam of energy charged directly toward Lin Xiu!

“Get lost!!!”

Lin Xiu roared angrily and directly blocked these attacks with the body of the Dark Edge spear.

And at the next moment, the whole person flew up into the air!

“Humph!”

Watching Lin Xiu approach, Huang Ying’s face also became extremely gloomy.

This young man actually dared to challenge his dignity as an emperor!

swoosh—

At the moment Lin Xiu rushed up, Huang Ying also held the white long sword transformed from the source strength in his hand and attacked Lin Xiu!

bang bang bang-

The weapons of the two collided.

But the huge power from Huang Ying’s body actually sent Lin Xiu’s body flying.

Boom—

Lin Xiu’s body fell from the sky and hit the ground, causing a huge pit to appear on the ground.

“This is the difference between a Respected warrior and you, a weak King warrior.”

Huang Ying said lightly in the sky.

His tone was full of pride.

Huhuhu——

Lin Xiu, who fell down, stood up at this time, then directly activated the new skill obtained by advancing to King warrior- ‘Sacrifice’!

‘Sacrifice’: Sacrifice your own vitality to gain powerful power! (Note: The more life force you sacrifice, the stronger the power you get, but you cannot sacrifice life force that leads to death)

I want strength!

After Lin Xiu directly activated Sacrifice, he immediately used his thoughts to frantically sacrifice his life force.

At this moment, Lin Xiu instinctively felt that the strength of his body was constantly rising!

Not enough, not enough!

At this time, Lin Xiu had completely forgotten about the rest and when he thought of Luo Yue’s face, he had the urge to destroy the Marqi planet.

“You, all of you will be buried with her!”

Lin Xiu roared and the surrounding ground shook violently. In an instant, the entire ground was shaken by Lin Xiu’s power, causing huge ravines to appear.

how can that be!!!

Huang Ying in the sky, looking at Lin Xiu’s figure after the thick dust dissipated, his eyes were filled with incomparable shock.

He could clearly feel that Lin Xiu’s strength had more than doubled!

No, more than double, because his power is still rising!

Finally, the power in his body swelled to an extreme, Lin Xiu looked at the emperor in the air and suddenly let out a huge roar.

The body directly erupted with extremely terrifying power, rushing into the air.

“Asking for death!!!”

He always looked at Lin Xiu’s emperor with a proud look, but at this time his face became ugly.

With a loud roar, the long sword he held in his hand slashed directly into the air and a terrifying sword aura charged directly!

In the surrounding space, a large number of tiny cracks appeared because of this terrifying sword aura.

boom–

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s left hand was a piece and he directly slapped and destroyed this sword energy that could split space.

The long spear held in the other hand pierced through Huang Ying’s body instantly.

Huang Ying looked down at his chest and a huge hole had already appeared.

“Hahaha, do you think I’ll just die like this?”

“When I leave, you and they will all die.”

Huang Ying’s words just fell and at this moment, his whole person seemed to be turned into gravel and was blown away by the wind.

Incarnate outside the body!?

It turns out that this is not the real body of Huang Ying!

At this time, Lin Xiu’s body also flew down and returned to Luo Yan and Luo Yue.

Around, within ten miles, there are no living people now.

“Luo Yue...”

Lin Xiu released the matrix that protected them, hugged Luo Yue from Luo Yan and held Luo Yue in his arms.

As if afraid that Luo Yue would just disappear.

“She didn’t die, she just used the family’s forbidden technique and passed out.”

Luo Yan sighed at this moment, then spoke up.

“When did you wake up?!”

Lin Xiu said excitedly.

“I don’t know, maybe after a while.”

Maybe, never. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Luo Yan didn’t say these words in her heart.

And at this time, with a breeze blowing, Luo Yue’s slender black hair turned white.

Hair as white as snow.
