1327 Light Energy!

The look in Yuan Zheng’s eyes changed when he saw everything that was going on.

He could clearly feel that the energy inside Lin Xiu’s body was getting stronger in a short period of time!

This young man has been keeping his abilities a secret too!

“Huuuuu~”

!!

Lin Xiu finally let out a breath of relief. With how he was using ‘Rage’, his strength had tremendously improved.

He could also feel that the arm that held onto his spear was now stronger than before.

“This is great. It’s finally getting interesting.”

Seeing the changes on Lin Xiu, Yuan Zheng was not afraid but instead, he laughed out loud in excitement.

All of the energy inside his body was ready to be released as well!

Both of these men were filled with terrifying amounts of energy. As both their energies collided with each other, there was a huge storm that swirled up from inside the arena.

“Both of them….have been hiding their true abilities…”

The man sitting next to Baili Haoling had his eyes open wide.

This was because he could feel an overpowering amount of energy being released from both the men on stage and his body started trembling.

Lei Chong had his eyes fixed on the stage, not wanting to leave out any details.

A fight between two powerful warriors was definitely something beneficial to him.

Kill him!

At the same time, Lin Xiu dashed forward with the Haoyue Spear in his hands!

His entire body was covered with an overpowering sura.

“You’re dead!”

Yuan Zheng roared as he stared at Lin Xiu and he was also prepared to attack Lin Xiu with both his war hammers!

Both of their figures moved like shadows and instantly collided with each other. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Clang clang clang – –

The audience around them felt as if their visions had turned blurry and they could only hear the loud collisions between both their weapons.

No one could see clearly how these people were moving.

The black panther divine spirit that belongs to Yuan Zheng attacked Lin Xiu as well.

Lin Xiu held onto his Haoyue Spear and as he tried to fight the war hammers, he could feel an intense amount of energy coming from his opponent.

The little black dragon was also fighting the black panther.

However, the black panther was cautious and it avoided the little black dragon!

Just as the panther dodged the attack, it would stretch out his paw and hit the little black dragon.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but furrow his brows.

Initially, he thought that the little black dragon would be able to tear apart the other party’s divine spirit but from what was happening up till now, this wasn’t the case.

The black grade divine spirit belonging to the other party had great reflex and it was impossible for the little black dragon to tear it apart.

The little black dragon was hit by the panther but it stood up immediately and retaliated toward the panther.

Yuan Zheng frowned as he could clearly feel the threat and danger coming from Lin Xiu.

Most divine spirits that could attack would only aim for the warriors.

But, this little black dragon was different. It seems like it was interested in the black panther.

It was attacking the black panther continuously.

Damn it!

Yuan Zheng secretly cursed underneath his breath. As he had to be cautious of the little black dragon, he also had to focus on the fight with Lin Xiu.

His warhammers worked like wonders. The attacks were mighty and it was moving quickly. The energy that came from it felt as if they could destroy the entire space.

‘Profound Intent- Torrential Storm of Rose Flower!’

Lin Xiu blocked one of the attacks with his spear and took two steps back.

Seeing how Yuan Zheng was still coming at him, he quickly activated one of his skills!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Instantly, there were thousands of spears that appeared in the air!

Yuan Zheng’s pupil shrank uncontrollably and used both his war hammers as his shield.

He held both hands before his chest and blocked the attacks coming his way.

Even when Lin Xiu had come up with such quick attacks, Yuan Zheng was able to dodge them all!

Lin Xiu frowned. Then, there was a large amount of dark energy that was released from Lin Xiu’s body!

All of them went straight towards Yuan Zheng!

Yuan Zheng thought of attacking Lin Xiu again after defending against Lin Xiu but seeing what was happening, he had to abandon his plan.

He quickly took a few steps backwards.

However, the dark energy released by Lin Xiu was like the tidal waves.

“Dark energy…”

...

Riyan Noble God was shocked to see this.

“This…”

Wan Gan and Zhang Qinghua were both shocked as well.

The dark energy that has been released by Lin Xiu was too powerful and it looked like something that belonged to the other planet.

“Go and find out where he came from.”

Riyan Noble God peered at one of the warrior gods next to him.

“Yes, Sir!”

The warrior god quickly stood up and answered the Noble God respectfully.

Then, he quickly left the room.

He immediately went to investigate who Lin Xiu was.

“Let’s continue watching the match.”

...

Riyan Noble God saw how these men tried to stop themselves from speaking and gave his commands.

Wan Gan and the rest of them looked at each other before nodding their heads.

As for Yuan Zheng who was on stage, he stared at the dark energy that was heading at him but he no longer moved.

The corner of his lips slightly deviated upwards.

“Dark energy…?”

He muttered to himself.

Then, there was an eye-piercing bright light that came from his forehead.

What was that?!

Lin Xiu looked at the energy that had been released and he was stunned.

This was because as the bright white glow was released, Lin Xiu suddenly felt uncomfortable.

The rest of the dark energy around him that was like tidal waves suddenly slowed down.

“Get lost!”

As Yuan Zheng released his sourcemark energy, he roared from the bottom of his heart.

All of the dark energy around them was disappearing!

This was because the bright light released by Yuan Zheng’s forehead has now covered the energy arena.

“Light…..energy?”

There was an uproar that came from the audience.

Although most of them had elemental source marks, light elements were still something incredibly rare.

Lin Xiu was starting to turn pale.

The light energy sourcemark might not have directly caused injuries to Lin Xiu but it completely got rid of the dark energy released by Lin Xiu. This was why Lin Xiu would still be suffering from the backlash of it.

He was feeling incredibly uncomfortable.

“You wouldn’t have been able to guess that I have a light elemental sourcemark.”

Yuan Zheng couldn’t help but laugh as he spoke to Lin Xiu.
