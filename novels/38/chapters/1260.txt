1261 The Function of the Healing Potion

Looks like those from Changqing City were prepared.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

It wasn’t that he was feeling afraid but instead, it was excitement.

At that moment, all of the cannons were filled with a large amount of energy.

!!

Boom – –

Suddenly, all of the canons released a thousand energy beams and all of them were targeted at Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling.

The energy barrier over the sky of Changqing City was designed in a way where they would be allowed to attack the outsiders but no one was allowed to attack them!

“Careful!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed unconsciously when he saw what was happening.

Xiu – –

He quickly shifted his body in order to dodge these attacks.

Lin Xiu could even hear some of them passing by his ears.

These attacks were too dense!

Although Lin Xiu was quick enough, it was still impossible for him to dodge every single one of it.

With the control of his mind, he quickly released his ‘sphere’.

Baili Haoling did the same as well.

They released it at the same time.

Boom boom boom – –

The energy beams landed on their ‘sphere’s continuously and there were loud explosions that followed.

These beams looked powerful and scary but with his ‘sphere’ released, Lin Xiu didn’t suffer any injuries.

Lin Xiu looked at the cannons that were still attacking him.

Then, he raised his right fist and gathered his source energy onto his fist.

Although using this skill would exhaust most of his source energy, Lin Xiu did not care about it.

As the energy continued accumulating around his left fist, he quickly selected a healing potion from his expansion space and consumed it immediately.

“Break it!!!”

At that instant, Lin Xiu shifted his body and rushed downwards!

As he got closer to the energy barrier, Lin Xiu threw his fist onto the energy barrier!

The ultimate fist technique – ‘Destroy the Sky’!

Boom – –

As the fist landed on the energy barrier, the entire energy barrier of Changqing City started shaking.

“Hmph! That is merely a god-level warrior skill, did you really think that you can destroy this barrier?!”

Liu Mo stood on the highest point of his mention as he stared at Lin Xiu.

“City Lord, should we attack now?”

There were a few warriors standing around Liu Mo and all of them were looking at their city lord.

They were waiting for his commands.

“No.”

Liu Mo shook his head.

“That boy is trying to destroy our energy barrier. We shall let him try it then.”

He spoke in a cold tone.

Lin Xiu was using such a powerful warrior skill and it would definitely use up his source energy.

Once Lin Xiu’s energy gets used up, he would be able to defeat Lin Xiu in one blow.

“Lin Xiu, should we wait for them to come out before attacking?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Baili Haoling could see clearly that the energy barrier did not break because of Lin Xiu’s punch.

It seems like this one was similar to the one that they had in Lingxian City.

“No.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and consumed another bottle of healing potion.

All of the source energy that he used earlier have all recovered.

“Huh?”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was still trying to transfer energy into his fist, Baili Haoling was confused.

“You still have energy left?”

She was aware that in order for Lin Xiu to use such skills, it would use up a lot of his source energy.

“This is a healing potion and it would help me recover all my source barrier.”

Lin Xiu smiled as he explained it to Baili Haoling.

When there was enough energy in his fist, Lin Xiu continued attacking the energy barrier.

...

‘Destroy the Sky’!

Lin Xiu landed another punch on the same spot.

With that, there were loud sounds heard as the energy barrier shook.

“I was waiting for that.”

Liu Mo sneered when he saw what Lin Xiu was doing.

For warrior skills of this level, after using it twice, it would have caused Lin Xiu to lose all of his source energy.

“That brat would have run out of energy by now.”

Liu Mo was confident about it but then, he soon realised that Lin Xiu was once again gathering energy in his right fist.

Boom – –

When another punch landed on the energy barrier, it let out another loud explosion.

Liu Mo couldn’t help but frown when he saw what was happening.

...

What on earth was happening? How was it that he had unlimited energy?!

“This time, he would no longer have energy left to release such a powerful attack.”

Liu Mo sneered.

However, he was immediately proven wrong.

This was because there was energy seen accumulating in Lin Xiu’s fist once again!

He was about to release another warrior skills?!

Liu Mo’s eyes were filled with surprise.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu’s punch landed on the same spot.

“Hmm? Looks like it can be destroyed.”

Lin Xiu looked at the spot on the energy barrier that he had been punching. Then, he realised that there were cracks on it and he was pleasantly surprised about it.

This way, the energy barrier in this city wasn’t as tough as the one that they had in Lingxian City.

There was a possibility that he could break it apart.

Lin Xiu thought about it before taking another healing potion.

Then, he gathered his source energy and released the same warrior skills!

Boom – –

As Lin Xiu continued his attack, there were thunder and lightning that filled the sky, followed by loud explosions.

There were also huge cracks that appeared all over the energy barrier.

“City lord!”

The rest of the warriors widened their eyes in shock.

This was entirely different from what they had expected.

This man was able to continuously release god-level warrior skills! Wouldn’t he be exhausted?

“He’s drinking something…”

Some of them realised that after every attack, Lin Xiu would drink from a bottle.

“A potion that would help with recovering his source energy.

Liu Mo noticed the same as well.

This was why this brat was able to use the same warrior skills over and over again.

From what they could see, that potion must have been restoring his source energy! This was something incredible.

As he thought about it, there was greed in Liu Mo’s eyes.

“Break it!”

Lin Xiu threw another punch onto the energy barrier!

The power of this punch was similar to those before.

Boom – –

There were already cracks all over the energy barrier. As it tried to withstand another impact, there was a loud explosion.

The entire energy barrier scattered!

It worked?!

Baili Haoling was shocked to see what had happened.
