Chapter 74: Intense Battle!

Tens of thousands of eyes surrounded the huge stage and all of which were focused on the stage.

“All the best, Lin Xiu. Kill him!” Yang Tian sat on the seat and shouted.

Tang Tian looked coldly at Lin Xiu and said with a wry smile, “We were here the previous time, I didn’t expect that we would be here again a month later.”

“Indeed, I’ll still trample you this time,” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said.

He was still gripping the Silver Immortal Soul spear. Tang Tian was much stronger than before. And since he couldn’t analyze him using his Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu didn’t dare to be careless.

“I’ll kill you this time.” Tang Tian pointed at Lin Xiu with his long sword and said.

“Same to you.”

Lin Xiu raised his brows. At this moment, both of them charged at one another!

In the eyes of the students, it was as if two black shadows were clashing together in an instant!

Dang dang dang——

The sounds of the weapons colliding kept ringing.

“Hmm, it’s these two young chaps again.” Mr. Ye looked at the stage at this moment, seemingly more interested than when he was watching the match between Bai Lichang and Long Potian.

No matter how silly the other school leaders were, they could tell that Mr. Ye was quite interested in Lin Xiu.

“Mr. Ye, I think the odds of Lin Xiu winning should be quite high. After all, he defeated Tang Tian the last time…”

“That’s right, that’s right.”

The school leaders around him shouted and were trying to curry favor with Mr. Ye.

Sitting behind the leaders’ seats, Zhang Lin’s face was a little unpleasant as he cursed at these opportunists.

Mr. Ye had been coming to Xing Yao Academy for some time and Zhang Lin knew that he was a teacher from a certain college so he didn’t dare to offend him either.

Zhang Lin focused on the match and chuckled. ‘This time, Lin Xiu will lose for sure, and he’s going to lose very badly!’

Lin Xiu and Tang Tian were still in a frenzied battle.

Both men poured their own source strength into the weapons and when the weapons collided, it was as if there was an explosion in the air.

Lin Xiu looked at Tang Tian in surprise. ‘His sword is so powerful!?’

“Surprised? This is the weapon I spent 100 million dollars to buy, it’s the Blood Fiend Sword that is made with a special metal obtained from the Scarlet Blood Star.” Tang Tian seemed to be at ease while holding the sword and spoke as he hit Lin Xiu’s spear.

Lin Xiu frowned. His sword actually appeared slightly red with the source strength instilled.

And this Blood Fiend Sword was unusually sharp; each hit against the Silver Immortal Soul spear actually left a crack.

Lin Xiu knew that he could no longer fight like this and seized the opportunity to use ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

Following the use of his skill, Lin Xiu’s spear was like a dragon coming out of a cave as it transformed into five to six illusions and stabbed toward Tang Tian!

The crowd couldn’t help but gush at the thrilling scene.

Lin Xiu seized the opportunity at such great timing, this Tang Tian seemed to have no way of escaping!

However, while the illusions of the spear flew out, Tang Tian dodged swiftly like a ghost!

He was so fast that it was somewhat unbelievable.

“That’s… that’s a Body skill!?” Luo Li was flabbergasted when he saw this scene.

“That’s right, Tang Tian is using the ‘Shadow’ body skill.” The corners of Liu Bai’s mouth raised at this moment then he smiled.

The students in the field were in an uproar. Tang Tian could cultivate body skills which meant that Tang Tian’s physique had reached the level of a rank 3 warrior!

This was too shocking because whether it was Bai Lichang who was ranked 1st in the combat strength list or Long Potian who was ranked 2nd, they were merely at the peak of a rank 2 warrior.

“Go to hell!” Tang Tian avoided Lin Xiu’s ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ at this moment and exerted force on the sword in his right hand, causing Lin Xiu’s spear to fly out of his hands. At the same time, he landed a heavy punch on Lin Xiu’s chest.

‘Salvo Fist!’

It was a bronze skill, but when Tang Tian used it that day, the power of this punch was very strong.

Lin Xiu was sent flying like a broken kite.

Lin Xiu quickly stabilized his body and stomped his feet hard on the ground, trying to stop himself from flying.

Bang——

At this moment, his clothes tore open, there was a sweet taste in his throat, and a mouthful of blood spat out.

His Salvo Fist was so powerful that Lin Xiu felt as if his internal organs had been shaken and it was very uncomfortable.

Damn it! If he hadn’t dealt with Ye Gulin yesterday, he wouldn’t have used ‘Fury’.

It was going to get a little dangerous.

Lin Xiu didn’t think much and leaped over, catching the flying spear in his hand. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

‘Very well, it seems that the chap is still wounded from the match yesterday against Ye Gulin…’

Zhang Lin looked at Lin Xiu and sneered.

He was the one who planned this and deliberately arranged for Ye Gulin to fight against Lin Xiu. Even if Ye Gulin didn’t get rid of Lin Xiu, he could cause harm to Lin Xiu. For the next round, Zhang Lin would bribe the backstage programmer and arrange for Lin Xiu to be against Tang Tian.

Seamless!

“Tsk tsk, how weak.” Tang Tian looked at Lin Xiu and gave a look of disdain.

Without waiting for Lin Xiu to recover, he held the Blood Fiend Sword and charged over.

At the moment when he rushed over, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed and he swiftly brandished his spear.

As he had the title of a ‘rank 1 warrior’, Lin Xiu had the halo to accelerate the build-up of rage.

So Tang Tian’s punch directly allowed Lin Xiu’s build-up of rage to reach the conditions which allowed it to be used.

Without much hesitation, Lin Xiu directly waved his spear high up and used the ‘Awe of the Phoenix’.

With the power-up strike, the ‘Awe of the Phoenix’ became more powerful and a large number of flames were released.

“Do you think I’m going to be afraid of this move!” Tang Tian roared and slashed the Blood Fiend Sword harshly.

Silver Martial Arts – ‘Moving Clouds and Flowing Water’!!!

A large amount of sword aura was released from the Blood Fiend Sword. This sword aura seemed to have a special attribute – the surrounding phoenixes were slashed by the Blood Fiend Sword and immediately disappeared like they touched water.

As Tang Tian continued to slash hard, several phoenixes disappeared!

The ‘Awe of the Phoenix’ was completely dealt with!

The sword headed straight toward Lin Xiu’s chest directly!

What the!?

Lin Xiu was startled. ‘What kind of skill is this?’ It appeared like it existed just to deal with his ‘Awe of the Phoenix’!
