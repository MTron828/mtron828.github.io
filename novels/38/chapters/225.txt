Chapter 226: ‘Mirror Image’

Just after Zhuo Qixing cut the ‘Lin Xiu’ in half just now, he heard a voice coming from the opposite side.

But when he wanted to take action, it was too late.

Because at this moment, Lin Xiu’s spear had pierced directly into his shoulder!

The intense pain made Zhuo Qixing’s eyes widen and the pupils in his eyes constricted.

“Lin Xiu… Lin Xiu pierced through Zhuo Qixing’s shoulder!?”

Some of the students in Class 10 of the South Campus were so surprised that their eyes widened and looked as if they were about to fall out.

Lin Xiu was a student in Class 10 while Zhuo Qixing was the class monitor of Class One!

They did not expect that Lin Xiu would win!

Those students were now in too much shock to even speak.

They thought that this was impossible but it actually happened.

‘Mirror Image’

The skill that Lin Xiu just used was ‘Mirror Image’. He didn’t expect that it would have this effect when it was only the first time he used it.

However, the cooling time of this skill was a bit long and it couldn’t be used again for now.

Lin Xiu stared at Zhuo Qixing who was in front of him. If it weren’t for the fact that so many people were watching, Lin Xiu would have killed Zhuo Qixing directly.

But Lin Xiu knew that if he used a killing move on Zhuo Qixing, the teacher of Class 1 would definitely stop him.

Damn it.

“Hahaha, do you think you can beat me like this!?” Lin Xiu’s spear pierced through his body, Zhuo Qixing’s expression only froze slightly and he laughed.

He threw the sword in his right hand directly to the ground and grabbed Lin Xiu’s spear with both hands!

Lin Xiu frowned. When he tried moving the spear in his hand, he found that Zhuo Qixing had already held it tightly and he could not move it at all.

In the next moment, Zhuo Qixing used force and the spear was pulled out of his body!

Blood flowed out of his body instantly to the ground.

At this time, Zhuo Qixing looked at the blood flowing out and his eyes seemed to have turned blood red.

They were filled with anger and violence.

The people around them all exclaimed at this moment – this was simply terrifying, he actually pulled out the spear like that?

Lin Xiu felt his terrifying power.

As Zhuo Qixing grabbed his spear, Lin Xiu move it no matter how hard he tried!

“Get lost!!!” Zhuo Qixing suddenly used force and roared.

The veins in his hands had completely exploded at this time.

The muscles on the entire arm swelled up to the extreme, looking terrifying.

He held Lin Xiu’s spear and with a violent force, Lin Xiu was being shaken wildly!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened, his hands grabbing the Dark Edge spear tightly.

But what he didn’t expect was that something seemed to spread over his spear at this time.

The hands that were holding the Dark Edge spear tightly suddenly felt a strong painful sensation.

At this time, both hands seemed to blacken. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Zhuo Qixing had a sinister smile and in the next moment, he used force again and Lin Xiu could no longer hold the Dark Edge spear in his hand and he was sent flying directly!

Boom–

Lin Xiu’s body was like a kite with a broken string as he fell to the ground.

He took a closer look at his hands and they had turned a lighter shade of black.

It was still painful.

“You used poison…” Lin Xiu was about to say something but Zhuo Qixing didn’t give him any chance as he rushed to Lin Xiu’s side.

He threw Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear directly on the ground then waved his fist and attacked Lin Xiu!

“‘Black Dragon Blast Fist’!!!” Zhuo Qixing roared and lifted his fist when he was about to rush to Lin Xiu’s side to attack him!

His source strength wrapped around his fist and a terrifying black body of energy was charging towards Lin Xiu!

“Such powerful source strength!” Nan Zhengjun was shocked when he saw this scene.

He was shocked just now when he saw Lin Xiu pierce Zhuo Qixing’s body with a spear.

But he didn’t expect that Zhuo Qixing still had such a powerful force hidden!

And this ‘Black Dragon Blast Fist’ was among the gold skills, it was also one of the top-notch skills!

Even he couldn’t block that attack! Lin Xiu was in danger this time.

Lin Xiu’s gaze changed when he saw this. He moved his body, wanting to dodge it, but what he didn’t expect was that the black dragon illusion that came out Zhuo Qixing’s fist directly hit Lin Xiu!

It seemed to be tracking him!

What kind of skill is this!?

Lin Xiu was shocked when he saw this scene and used ‘Without a Trace’ to the extreme, constantly evading.

“Trying to flee!? No way!” Zhuo Qixing sneered. He stood at the same spot, waving his hands constantly and the black dragon that was transformed out of that terrifying energy body seemed to continue chasing after Lin Xiu under Zhuo Qixing’s control!

Moreover, the body of this black dragon seemed to grow bigger and bigger. With Zhuo Qixing’s control, its speed was already reaching the limits.

When Lin Xiu wanted to dodge, the black dragon opened its mouth and directly bit Lin Xiu who was about to leap away!!!

Oh no!!!

Seeing this scene, the hearts of the people in Class 10 of the South Campus had gone to their throats!

“Go to hell!!!” Zhuo Qixing’s eyes widened and he slammed his right hand on the ground.

The black dragon that was biting Lin Xiu hit the ground directly at this moment!

Boom——

The second it hit the ground, it was like a bomb falling from the sky, causing a huge explosion.

The students of the Sacred Region Academy had stepped back a long time ago but they were still affected by this huge explosion.

At this time, the people standing in front were all sent flying.

Due to the explosion, the entire center area was filled with thick smoke and dust.

Nothing could be seen at all.

“Hehehe, he should be dead, right?” Zhuo Qixing looked at the scene there and said with a sneer.

He wasn’t best at using swords but fists. This was his strongest skill.

However, not many people knew that.

“Unlocking rank 2 ‘Gene Lock’…”

At this time, Lin Xiu heard a sound in his mind.
