Chapter 730 Freezing the Distance

Lin Xiu picked up the snow tiger’s combat suit before saying it to Qian Jing.

The combat suit that he had on now was the one that he had won from the lucky draw and it was really thin. It could be used as an inner wear.

He could add on another evolved beast combat suit on top.

“You really aren’t...”

Qian Jing looked at the snow tiger combat suit and he felt helpless.

This was the most expensive combat suit in the entire store...

Qian Jing regretted it.

“I want this then.”

Qian Jing chose a plume combat suit that was made from a bird-type evolved beast. The combat suit that was made up of a thick layer of feather was much warmer than the combat suit that was made from the other evolved beast.

“I’ve come to realise that you are loaded.”

Lin Xiu said to Qian Jing as Qian Jing was paying. “What do you want?”

Qian Jing looked at Lin Xiu as he narrowed his eyes and warned Lin xiu.

“I’m telling you that I don’t have much left.”

“Hahaha....let’s head back.”

Lin Xiu smiled. He had no idea why but Qian Jing seemed to be really friendly with him and this walking ‘atm-machine’ was something convenient to have.

If Qian Jing found out that Lin Xiu only took him as a walking ‘atm-machine’, he would be furious.

The Ice and Snow Hotel was the largest hotel in the city.

The exterior of the building looked like a huge block of ice. It looked incredibly unique.

“You’re back?”

As soon as they walked into the building, they met Jiang Jun who was in the lobby.

Jiang Jun had a thick combat suit on as well.

“These are the cards to your rooms. We may have to stay here for quite some time for the new train to come.”

Jiang Jun told both of them.

“Alright.”

Lin Xiu and Qian Jing took the cards and headed to their room.

“It’s so cold and I’m so tired. I better head back to my room.”

Lin Xiu rubbed his hands together, trying to show that he was freezing as he walked towards the elevator.

Qian Jing looked at Lin Xiu as if he was a clown. It didn’t even look convincing!

The interior of the Ice and Snow Hotel was very different from what was outside. With the heater on, the entire hotel felt like it was summer.

Lin Xiu soon went back to his own room.

The room was huge and there was a wide living room.

“Huuuuu”

Lin Xiu immediately laid on his bed after removing his combat suit.

“It’s so hot.”

Lin Xiu mumbled to himself.

As if he had thought of something, Lin Xiu changed into a sitting position and started moving his fingers.

The energy in him started flowing through his body and the ground started giving out a weird crackling sound.

Shuashhhhh- –

Then, the entire floor was covered with a thin layer of ice!

“It still isn’t strong enough...”

Lin XIu looked at the scene that he had caused and pursed his lips.

This was the skills that he had gotten from the inheritance; the purple gold warrior skills – ‘Freezing the Distance’.

According to the information from the skill, only people with the Heart of Frost would be able to complete this skill.

If he had enough strength, he would be able to freeze the entire city!

However, Lin Xiu could only freeze this small area for now and it had already taken up a huge amount of energy. It was indeed difficult for him to master this skill.

Lin Xiu tried it a few more times and he could feel a cold feeling through his body that caused Lin Xiu’s face to change.

Lin Xiu’s face and lips were now turning pale.

“Damn it....it’s so cold.”

As he was trying to use that skill, the Heart of Frost had been activated as well.

The terrifying chilling feeling caused Lin Xiu to feel as if his entire body had been frozen.

Koong Loong – – Lin Xiu had no other choice but to activate the ‘Red Lotus Fury’.

With the ‘Red Lotus Fury’ running inside him, Lin Xiu felt large droplets of sweat forming on his forehead.

“Huuuuuu...”

It took him minutes before the chilling feeling disappeared completely.

“This skill....it’s tough...”

Lin Xiu started panting.

The skill may look powerful but it was extremely difficult to use. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“I would have to train myself to use this new skill as well as the ‘Clean Sweep’.”

“Hmm....which of these two would be more powerful...?”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

‘Clean Sweep’ was a special warrior skill but would this special skill be more powerful than the purple gold warrior skills? Lin Xiu had no idea.

Lin Xiu shook his head helplessly before taking a deep breath. Then, he tried to absorb as much energy as possible with the help of his ‘Cultivation Technique’.

The energy in the air on this planet was much thicker than it was back on earth. Therefore, the energy that Lin Xiu had used could be quickly replenished.

“Let’s continue...”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath before continuing with his practice.

Time passed and Lin Xiu was still busy training. He had no idea how much time had already passed.

Boom boom boom – –

Then, there was someone banging on his door.

“Who is it?”

Lin Xiu had just finished training and was about to take another break before starting again. He was suddenly interrupted by the noise from outside when he raised his voice and asked.

“Hello. We’re here to deliver your dinner.”

It sounded like a waiter.

Dinner?

Lin Xiu was stunned. He looked at the wall clock behind him and it was already six in the evening.

Perhaps it was Jiang Jun that ordered dinner for them?

Lin Xiu was a little confused but he still walked toward the door.

As soon as he opened the door, there was a bright light that came from outside.

Then, there was a dagger that was placed on Lin Xiu’s neck.

“So....this is dinner?”

Lin XIu looked towards the man who was dressed like a waiter and said in a helpless tone.

“Enough with the nonsense. Go back inside.”

The man said in a cold voice.

As he pushed Lin Xiu back into the room with the dagger on his neck, there were two other men that walked into it as well.

All of them were holding on to sharp daggers with a vicious look in their eyes. It was obvious that they didn’t come with good intentions.

“You’re Lin Xiu?”

The man who was holding the dagger against Lin Xiu’s neck asked in a cold tone. “Yes but I don’t think I know any of you?”

Lin Xiu said with an innocent look on his face.

“Hmph! Give it!” The man sneered when he heard Lin Xiu’s question.

“What do you want?”

Lin Xiu was really confused. He had no idea what was happening. If he remembered correctly, he hasn’t taken anything from these men?

“Stop pretending?! You are the one who got the purple gold warriors skill card from the legacy land! Give it to me now!”

The man glared at Lin Xiu while screaming at him.

The dagger was placed very close to Lin Xiu’s neck as if the man wanted to kill Lin Xiu as soon as he moved.

“Who told you?!”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

Lin Xiu finally knew what was happening now. If his assumptions were right, there must be someone out there spending rumours about how he had gotten the purple gold warrior skill card!
