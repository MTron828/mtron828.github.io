Chapter 736 Lin Xiu’s Terrifying Power

The transparent eye shield he wears can lock the target and calculate the combat power of the target.

Moreover, it could also lock the point where the source strength of the opponent converges and the warrior can predict how to attack next based on this.

“It’s over ten thousand…”

The man secretly swallowed his saliva, then said with a trembling body.

However, Lin Xiu’s combat power seemed to be increasing frantically.

This shocking scene made everyone stunned.

“Trying to deceive!”

Looking at Lin Xiu’s current state, Huang Ji suddenly roared and attacked Lin Xiu with the long sword in his hand.

Because he clearly felt that there was something wrong with Lin Xiu’s state.

In this short period of time, Lin Xiu’s strength seemed to have improved a lot.

This actually made him feel threatened!

Just as Huangji rushed over to attack Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu’s figure rushed directly to the other side!

Toward Xue Liantian!

“Courting death!”

When Xue Liantian watched Lin Xiu rushing over, he was shocked and angry.

He actually dared to attack him, he was just courting death!

Just when he was extremely furious, Lin Xiu had already appeared in front of him!

“Damn!”

And Huangji, looking at Lin Xiu who disappeared in place, causing his attack to fail and at this time he looked sinister.

DangdangdangLin Xiu’s spear had already collided with Xue Liantian’s sword!

Xue Liantian used the blade to block the spear that Lin Xiu stabbed. The enormous force caused his body to keep retreating.

“Ah!!!”

He roared and wanted to attack Lin Xiu reflexively, but the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand seemed to pierce dozens of times per second.

He had no way to attack, he could only keep resisting

Just when he felt extremely pressured, Huangji rushed over from behind!

With one attack, it slashed Lin Xiu’s body!

He directly chopped his body in half!

There was a look of surprise in Xue Liantian’s

eyes.

“Behind!”

Huangji let out a loud roar.

Xue Liantian, who was in the midst of surprise, seemed to have thought of something. When he turned around and looked back, he saw Lin Xiu appearing behind.

Holding a Dark Edge spear full of flames, he stabbed him in the body!

‘Sphere’!

At this time, he had no choice but to quickly deploy his ‘Sphere’ to defend against this attack.

boom–

The head of the spear pierced his ‘Sphere’, making a loud noise.

But because of the ‘Sphere’ protection, the spear didn’t pierce his body.

At this time, Huangji rushed over again and wanted to kill Lin Xiu. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Lin Xiu had no choice but to retreat.

boom–

Huangji’s speed was too fast. Even if Lin Xiu retreated, he appeared in front of Lin Xiu with a long sword and the long sword in his hand slashed towards Lin Xiu’s body again.

But at this critical moment, Lin Xiu had already started to unfold a Sphere.

The dark red ‘Sphere’ directly blocked his attack.

Moreover, his long sword attacked Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ and he immediately felt a sharp pain.

Taking a closer look, it turned out that there was a flame spreading on Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ and the temperature of the flame was directly transmitted to his hands through his weapon.

zizizi —

No, not only flames, but also some lightning was transmitted to his body.

His powerful warrior body felt the slightest numbness.

Damn…how is this ‘Sphere’ like this!?

Huangji’s eyes showed a slightly unbelievable look.

But Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate at all at this time. Holding the spear in his hand, he stabbed him in the body.

Dang–

But Huangji reacted quickly to resist Lin Xiu’s blow.

“Humph! Is that all you’ve got?”

Lin Xiu’s blow didn’t seem to have much power and it could also be said that it was very light.

However, Huangji, who has always been cautious, sneered at the same time, but also became cautious in his heart.

He thought to himself that Lin Xiu was deliberately showing weakness and wanted to let him attack so that he could use some skill?

Thinking of this, his brows slightly wrinkled, looking at Lin Xiu who was attacking again, he didn’t fight back, he resisted while trying to observe what the hell Lin Xiu was up to.

Huangji was too cautious.

On the other side, Xue Liantian, who was looking at Lin Xiu who was attacking Huangji, was about to get ready to kill Lin Xiu. ,

“Careful!”

But just as his body was about to move, he heard the voice of his subordinates from behind!

What happened?!

He was stunned for a moment and at this moment, he clearly felt an extremely powerful source fluctuation coming from behind.

Xue Liantian was stunned for a moment, then turned around abruptly and saw Lin Xiu appearing behind, the Dark Edge spear in his hand had completely turned dark red!

The spear swept across. Although he maintained the state of using the ‘Sphere’, this sweeping blow was not an ordinary attack.

This is a skill – ‘Clean Sweep’!

As this unremarkable stroke swept past, he felt his ‘Sphere’ vibrate a bit.

Snapped–

In the next moment, with a clear sound, a large number of cracks appeared in his ‘Sphere’ and soon, the whole ‘Sphere’ was directly shattered!

Boom

Behind him and even the surrounding ground, all sunk down at this time.

This was the power of the ‘Clean Sweep’ skill!

At this moment, Xue Liantian’s body trembled.

What exactly is going on? In that instant, the power that Lin Xiu burst out was just too terrifying, if it wasn’t for “Sphere”, he would have been killed directly!

But even so, his ‘Sphere’ was destroyed by Lin Xiu!

Pff

In the next moment, a mouthful of blood spit out from his mouth.

This is the backlash after the ‘Sphere’ was destroyed.

What happened!?

Huangji also reacted at this time, it seems that the ‘Lin Xiu’ in front of him seems to be fake!

The current Lin Xiu has already gone to deal with Xue Liantian!

Damn it!

Huangji’s face was hideous, he directly attacked and instantly killed the ‘Lin Xiu’ who was constantly attacking him in front of him.

“Goodbye.”

On the other side, Lin Xiu didn’t stop his movements, the spear continued to sweep towards Xue Liantian’s body!

Seeing this scene, Xue Liantian’s pupils shrank suddenly.

He wanted to use a body skill to escape.

Clack clack–

But at this moment, with a crisp sound, he found that when his feet moved, all the snow around him surged towards his feet, solidifying him to the ground!
