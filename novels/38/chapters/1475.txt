1476 Undefeatable!

The rest of them had their eyes fixed on the screen.

“Huuuu~”

Lin Xiu was trying to catch his breath as well.

He had already given his best and this was already one of the strongest skills that he has.

This should have been enough to kill him, right?

“Is that all you have?”

Suddenly, he could hear Sky Eye laughing.

As they took a closer look, they noticed that Sky Eye’s body that had been destroyed, was slowly coming back together at a horrifying speed!

Lin Xiu’s eyes were wide open.

What the hell?!

While Lin Xiu was still in shock, Sky Eye had already recovered his body and swung his halberd at Lin Xiu once again!

Boom – –

As the halberd landed on Lin Xiu, he was thrown far into the distance and landed heavily on the ground.

Boom – –

The entire ground shook violently and more cracks appeared.

Earth was now already in a dire state.

“Hehe!”

Sky Eye laughed as he continued moving his halberd in the air.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

As he moved his halberd, there were countless dark red energy balls that were released and all of them were headed for Lin Xiu!

Boom boom – –

There were countless loud explosions heard once again.

“Lin Xiu!”

This idiot was too powerful.

“It should be fine. He has an immortal body.”

Some of the God Kings quickly reassured her.

“Damn it…”

Lin Xiu’s body then slowly got back into the air.

His body was still covered in gold.

He was in a lot of pain and there was blood hanging on the colour of his mouth.

But, these were nothing for Lin Xiu.

“That old fella’s immortal body…”

Sky Eye looked at Lin Xiu who was once again in the air and he looked a little shocked.

“Damn it!!”

Sky Eye was pissed as he roared in rage.

Then, there was a terrifying dark red energy released from his body.

It rushed into the air and caused a gap to open in the sky.

“What is he trying to do?”

Seeing what Sky Eye was doing, Tianling God King frowned.

“God King! He’s trying to absorb the energy from the other galaxies!”

Riyan God Lord suddenly thought of something. He raised his right arm and a huge screen appeared before them.

The dark red energy went through the gap and rushed into the other galaxies around them.

Soon, some of the energy from the smaller galaxies and planets has been absorbed.

As the energy from these galaxies were sucked dry, they exploded instantly.

“That guy! He’s trying to absorb all of the energy from the galaxies around us?!”

Tianling God King was shocked.

Riyan God Lord’s arm then continued moving around the screen before them.

“With such speed, Sky Eye would start absorbing from Warrior God Realm within half an hour!”

Riyan God Lord had a horrible look on his face.

The energy released by Sky Eye was incredibly terrifying.

He was able to instantly absorb all of the energy from a planet.

“Sky Eye must have encountered something incredible…”

One of the God King spoke in a solemn tone.

Sky Eye was too powerful now. If these dark red energies spread to Warrior God Realm, none of them would be able to stop him.

If the entire Warrior God Realm got sucked dry, this would be…..

The consequences would be unimaginable!

“What is that fella trying to do?!”

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s eyes were wide open as he looked at Sky Eye.

Sky Eye’s mouth was opened and there was a large amount of dark red energy entering his mouth!

Before Lin Xiu could react, all these horrifying energies were headed towards Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

They were moving at a really fast speed and Lin Xiu’s body was instantly hit by the energy.

Such powerful energy!

His entire body was hit but the dark red energy and Lin Xiu could instantly feel the intense pain all over his body.

It felt as if his entire body was about to break apart!

This horrifying energy was still constantly coming out of Lin Xiu’s mouth and it didn’t look like it’s about to stop!

“If this continues, even his immortal body would not be able to stop him…”

Tianling God King had a change of expression as he noticed this.

Luo Yue clenched her fist tightly. She was hoping that there was something that she could do but there wasn’t any that she could think of.

“Zhu Long…. Is there any way that I can kill him?!”

Lin Xiu placed his arm in front of his body.

His entire body was under attack by this dark red energy and it was impossible for him to run from it.

Lin Xiu could only wait for it to disappear.

But, this energy seemed to be limitless and it wasn’t going away soon.

Sky Eye suddenly widened his eyes and there was even more powerful energy released from his mouth!

Lin Xiu’s body was then thrown heavily onto the ground.

Boom – – nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Lin Xiu’s body was still moving further downwards into the ground.

He was about to hit the core of the earth!

The entire planet was shaking vigorously.

“Lin Xiu…”

Baili Haoling was in shock.

“Hahahahaha! This is all the old man has?!”

“Once I absorb all of the energy in the galaxy, I will then be the True God!”

Sky Eye laughed.

There was countless dark red energy released from his body and they turned into tentacles. They were searching around for more planets and galaxies!

Soon, Sky Eye started absorbing energies from multiple planets.

“It’s….it’s over.”

One of the God Kings turned pale.

Sky Eye was just too powerful.

It was impossible to defeat him now.

“Lin Xiu…will not be defeated.”

Luo Yue spoke firmly.

“That’s right! It is impossible that he would die so easily!”

Baili Haoling spoke up as well.

After countless battles, Lin Xiu has never been defeated.

Why would he die so easily this time?!

“But…”

Tianling God King was about to say something but he couldn’t.

Lin Xiu was all the way in the core of the planet; even if he wasn’t killed, he still wouldn’t be able to defeat Sky Eye.

As for Sky Eye, he was still absorbing the energy from the planets around him!

“Look!”
