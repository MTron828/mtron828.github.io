Chapter 78: Sacred Region Academy’s Admission Notice

Lin Xiu snorted and grabbed onto his lapels and gave him a punch.

With a loud bang, Zhang Lin’s teeth broke and his mouth became covered with blood.

In the next second, Lin Xiu kicked him in the abdomen and sent him flying.

People who used underhanded means were too disgusting.

“Lin Xiu, no matter what, he is still a teacher.” Luo Li became anxious. If the school decided to punish Lin Xiu, it would be over.”

“Lin… Lin Xiu. You’re dead meat!” Zhang Lin struggled to stand, but as his teeth had all fallen out, his words sounded extremely hilarious.

“Are you Lin Xiu?” Right at this moment, the federal police walked over and stared at Lin Xiu unkindly.

“I am.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

They were ferocious enough. Tang Tian had exploded himself, yet they wanted to pin him as the murderer?

It had to be known that law and order in the cities were extremely strict and killing others was considered breaking the law.

That meant having to serve jail time.

“We have received a tip and suspect that you have murdered people.” The federal police spoke.

They then took out special handcuffs to put around Lin Xiu’s wrists.

“Such scums have to be captured and taken to jail!!” Zhang Lin roared out loud.

As long as they went to the police station, he only had to pull some strings and Lin Xiu would die!

The federal police were also warriors and extremely powerful, so ordinary warriors could not escape from them.

“Wait a minute, I have a one-star medal, can we not do it with the handcuffs?” Lin Xiu looked at the federal police and asked.

One star medal?

The two policemen looked at each other with surprise.

The medal was not something any ordinary person could obtain. Those that had such medals were special and authority.

Before being judged as guilty, they could not use handcuffs.

“He… is lying, how can he have a one-star medal?” Zhang Lin was startled, then pointed at Lin Xiu and screamed.

Lin Xiu sneered, then reported out a string of numbers.

At the back of the one-star medal was a unique number that Lin Xiu had memorized.

When the two federal policemen heard Lin Xiu’s words, they took out their smartbooks and keyed the number that Lin Xiu gave and saw his information.

“Apologies, Mr. Lin Xiu.” The federal policemen’s faces immediately became better and took the handcuffs away as they apologized.

“I suspect that he is trying to frame me,” Lin Xiu pointed at Zhang Lin and said.

“You should know the crime of framing a one-star medal holder, right?”

“Mr. Li, we will investigate this thoroughly.” The federal policemen nodded their heads then walked over and used the same handcuffs on Zhang Lin.

“What are you doing! You trash, he is the one…” Zhang Lin was stunned before reacting and hollering at the top of his lungs.

“We suspect that you are trying to frame a one-star medal holder.” The federal policemen glared at him coldly.

They then pushed Zhang Lin into the car.

“Impossible, how can he have a one-star medal…”

Zhang Lin was brought away very quickly.

The entire episode caused Luo Li’s eyes to open wide.

“You actually hold a one-star medal?” Luo Li looked at Lin Xiu in surprise and asked.

One-star medals had their own unique identifiers that Lin Xiu could not fake.

“En, I earned it back at Guang Ming Fort.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

Luo Li wanted to speak but then sighed and took out a piece of paper from his pocket.

“Teacher tried, but the school and the Tang Family are connected.”

Lin Xiu accepted the piece of paper that wrote that he had deliberately harmed and caused Tang Tian’s death, and the end was that he had been expelled.

Lin Xiu clenched his fists when he saw the words and his eyes brewed with endless killing intent.

It was the Tang Family again!!

“Teacher has a few connections with other academies, I’ll try and see if I can get you to change schools.” Luo Li rubbed the space between his eyes and said.

Trying to change schools after being expelled was also troublesome to the extent that it was almost impossible.

But if he did not complete his last year, Lin Xiu’s future could be considered crippled and he could no longer apply for any other schools.

“No matter, at most I’ll go and serve the army,” Lin Xiu replied.

“No, you don’t have to.” Right at this time, a voice sounded from behind.

Luo Li and Lin Xiu were startled and turned behind to see an old man with a white beard behind.

“It’s you?”

The man was Mr. Ye, the man who sat at the stands and paid attention to Lin Xiu the entire time.

“Mr. Ye.” Luo Li greeted him respectfully.

“Here.” Mr. Ye handed a red envelope to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was skeptical but took it. After looking at it, he realized that it was an admission notice.

The entire admission notice seemed to be made out of unique materials and the engravings and words were extremely ancient.

But the golden words in the center proved that it was real. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Sacred… Sacred Region Academy?” Lin Xiu blurted out in shock.

While talking to the other soldiers previously, didn’t they mention how difficult it was to enter this mysterious academy?

He then recalled the young lady from before, she mentioned that she was from Sacred Region Academy, could it be here?

“Hmm, that’s right. Sacred Region Academy. I have observed you for this period of time, with your talent, you are definitely compatible and qualified to enter Sacred Region Academy.” Mr. Ye stroked his beard and chuckled.

Luo Li was crumbling from all the shock in a day. As a teacher, he had also heard of the most mysterious, peak establishment of all the schools. But he always thought that it was a legend, who would have known that there was truly an academy like that!

He finally understood why all the teachers were so respectful towards Mr. Ye.

“But I was expelled…” Lin Xiu chuckled bitterly.

“Sacred Region Academy holds special authority, you do not need any entrance exams. With your strength, there isn’t a need to graduate from here even. The first day of the ninth month, report there straightaway.”

It was already the seventh month, so he was just in time and had a month odd of time?

“Alright, I will be there.” Lin Xiu clenched the admission letter tightly and replied excitedly.

‘Is this what they say to have zero yields after struggling so hard, but an accidental slip leads to gains?’

But one thing was for sure, Lin Xiu had taken a step into a place where no ordinary person had made it to before!
