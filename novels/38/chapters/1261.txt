1262 The Attack Begins

With his own strength, Lin Xiu actually broke through the energy barrier of Changqing City!

At the moment when the energy barrier was broken, Baili Haoling also quickly reacted.

The long swords in both hands danced in the air.

As the long swords in her hands danced in the air, crescent-shaped sword auras burst out from the sky.

!!

Charge towards the fort that is still firing continuously below.

Now Baili Haoling’s strength has reached the God warrior level.

The sword auras released at this time were also extremely terrifying.

Boom, boom, boom——

Those forts were hit by the sword auras released by Baili Haoling and they were all blown up in an instant.

At this time, Xiaobai also made a loud and clear sound and the pair of huge wings began to flap.

A large amount of icy air rushed toward the fort below.

Not only the fort, but also some buildings below, were all frozen at this time.

Lin Xiu obtained a lot of Odd crystals when he was in Shachang City. Except for the god-level Odd crystals that were handed over to Lei Tong as the power core of the energy barrier, there were also a lot of other beast saint-level Odd crystals.

These Odd crystals were of no use to Lin Xiu.

Even if they were absorbed completely, his experience would not increase much.

So Lin Xiu fed all these beast saint-level Odd crystals to Rollie and Xiao Bai.

Now Xiaobai’s strength should have reached the top level of Beast Saint.

“kill him!”

At this time, Liu Mo’s face became extremely gloomy and he no longer had the calm expression he had at the beginning.

It never occurred to him that Lin Xiu really exploded the energy barrier.

As soon as he finished speaking, all the warriors who had been prepared for a long time flew into the sky and attacked Lin Xiu!

“There are quite a lot of warriors.”

Baili Haoling, who was beside Lin Xiu, looked at the sky-filled warriors flying up from all around and his eyes showed surprise.

The number of warriors in Changqing City is many times greater than what they encountered in Shachang City!

“Are you afraid?”

A smile appeared on the corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth.

“Of course not.”

“I am excited.”

Baili Haoling held the two swords in her hands, her eyes were full of excitement.

A pair of eyes have turned red now.

In this state, her own strength continued to improve.

Xiao Bai looked at the warriors rushing over and immediately made a loud and clear sound.

Opening its mouth wide, it spewed out a large amount of icy air.

Some weaker warriors were shocked by the terrifying icy air at this time and their bodies instantly turned into ice sculptures, falling directly to the ground.

But more warriors rushed to Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling.

They unfolded the ‘Sphere’ and the frosty air sprayed out by Xiaobai was completely blocked by their ‘Sphere’.

Their primary goal was to kill Lin Xiu.

“just in time.”

Baili Haoling looked at the warriors who rushed to her side and were about to kill her and immediately let out a sneer.

The long swords in her hands turned blood red at this time due to the source strength of her body being transmitted.

And her divine soul, the blood-red twin swords, also appeared above her body.

Whoosh whoosh——

Baili Haoling, who possesses extremely fierce sword skills, instantly cut through the ‘Spheres’ of several warriors with her two swords dancing and directly chopped their bodies into several pieces!

Those warriors who thought they could easily kill Baili Haoling panicked at this moment.

Terrifying, it’s really terrifying.

How could this person be so strong!?

Those warriors also trembled slightly after seeing their comrades who unfolded the ‘Sphere’ and were easily killed.

“Divine Soul!?”

And Liu Mo, who was still watching the scene in the sky from the top floor of the City Lord’s Mansion, could not help but shuddered.

The divine soul, among the god warriors, few god warriors could comprehend it.

This girl has actually realized the power of the divine soul!

And when he looked toward Lin Xiu, his expression changed drastically.

Because Lin Xiu was surrounded by a little black dragon.

The little black dragon blasted out with Lin Xiu’s fist and it also passed through directly, piercing through the ‘Sphere’ of those warriors, then piercing through the bodies of those warriors.

...

The speed of this little black dragon was very fast and it keeps shuttling back and forth, directly piercing through the chests or heads of those warriors. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

A large number of Sage warrior-level warriors were constantly falling.

Liu Mo stood here and looked towards the sky, only to see warriors constantly falling from the sky.

Looking at this scene, his heart was bleeding.

Those were the backbone of Changqing City that he cultivated with great difficulty!

Originally, he thought that he wanted my subordinates to consume Lin Xiu’s physical strength first, then he would kill him himself.

But seeing this scene, Liu Mo couldn’t help it anymore.

With a movement of his body, at the next moment, he swung his right hand and a blood-red long sword flew from below into his hand.

Following Liu Mo’s thoughts, at this moment, Liu Mo’s figure disappeared directly.

Boom, boom, boom——

Lin Xiu in the sky kept moving his fists.

...

Lin Xiu’s current boxing skills were also very powerful and every punch was full of extremely strong power.

The fist hit the ‘Sphere’ that those warriors had spread out, instantly blowing up their ‘Sphere’!

And Lin Xiu has already released his divine soul.

The little black dragon does not need to be controlled by Lin Xiu’s thoughts. At this time, with Lin Xiu’s attacks, it will continue to attack the surrounding warriors.

This little black dragon killed those warriors faster than Lin Xiu.

Those warriors had no way to dodge, so they were pierced through the body by the little black dragon.

In Lin Xiu’s mind, the prompts of gaining experience kept coming.

A lot of experience!

These prompts of gaining experience made Lin Xiu feel unusually pleasant.

upgrade!

You have to hurry up and upgrade again!

Whoosh—

Just when Lin Xiu was about to swing his fist again to attack the surrounding warriors, there was a sound piercing through the air.

Lin Xiu clearly felt something and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

His head subconsciously shifted to the left.

In the next moment, he could clearly see a blood-red long sword passing by his forehead.

A few strands of Lin Xiu’s hair were cut off directly.

Whoosh whoosh——

The blood-red long sword didn’t hit Lin Xiu, but it didn’t stagnate either. It continued to attack Lin Xiu.

The person holding the sword was different from the weapon he dealt with just now. His strength was obviously much stronger!
