“Right now, you can go ahead and choose. The God King will be waiting for you at the back.”

Riyan God Lord stroked his beard as he informed all three of them.

“Well, I shall thank you in advance first.”

Yuan Zheng took a look at the cards that were framed on the wall.

As he could only pick one, he had to make sure he picked the right one.

He had to pick one that would benefit him the most.

“Well, this one seems good.”

Lin Xiu started looking for his as well.

Soon, his eyes lit up with excitement and he seemed to have found one that suits him.

‘Myriad Dragon Prison Break’.

Although the card was shining brightly, it was one that was black in colour.

This meant that the warrior using it had to be familiar with the dark element.

“A spear warrior skills card. It suits you.”

Riyan God Lord looked at the card that caught Lin Xiu’s attention.

“However, it requires the warrior to have strong dark elemental energy to support it.

“The effect of it is intense and you may even hurt yourself.”

After hearing what the God King said, Lin Xiu nodded his head and pointed at the card, “I want this one.”

“Sure.”

Riyan God Lord raised his right hand.

Then, the warrior skills card that was hanging on the wall in a glass card, levitated into the air.

Then, it slowly went toward Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu held onto the glass frame and the more he looked at it, the happier he got with the card that he picked.

He could feel that this warrior skills card was incredibly powerful.

There weren’t many warrior skills cards for those who used spears but it was still enough for Lin Xiu.

However, other than this one card, the rest of them seemed boring.

None of them were incredibly powerful.

This was why Lin Xiu was not interested in any of them.

If he had to pick one, he would one with great destructive powers. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

‘True Fire Fist’.

Then, Lin Xiu picked another card.

This was one that could be used with his punch techniques.

This would not use up much of his energy, unlike ‘Destroy the Sky’.

However, he could throw continuous attacks.

As for the last one, Lin Xiu picked ‘Soul Eater’.

“Are you sure you want this?”

After looking at the last one that Lin Xiu picked, Riyan God Lord was surprised.

This was because this is no ordinary warrior skills card.

It could not be used with any weapons and was mainly one controlled mentally.

Those who get to master this skill would be able to engulf the divine spirit’s energy of other warriors.

“This is one of the most mysterious warrior skill cards here. The God King also found this on a very special planet.”

“But, you can’t cultivate it.”

Riyan God Lord started looking serious as he said so.

“Unable to cultivate it?”

Lin Xiu was stunned.

“That’s true. This is because we don’t have the energy that allows us to communicate with the information on the card.”

“The God King assumed that only those, who have the same energy as those on the planet where this card was found, would be able to activate it.”

“However, every single person on that planet has been killed.”

“Therefore, this is actually a useless card.”

After hearing the whole story, Xiao Qingchen and the rest let out a breath of relief.

They thought that Lin Xiu might have achieved an incredibly awesome warrior skills card.

However, this turned out to be a useless one.

No matter how powerful it was, it would be useless if no one was able to activate it.

A card that cannot be activated?

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

...

He remembered that not long ago, he had also used one that was known as a ‘useless’ piece of card.

But, Lin Xiu succeeded in the end.

This was because he had both ‘Analytic Eye’ and ‘Engulf’.

“Well, I want this.”

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and pointed at the same card.

“Alright then.”

Riyan God Lord nodded his head and did not say another word.

He only assumed that Lin Xiu was confident enough to think that he could read this card.

However, what Lin Xiu did not know was that even the God King couldn’t encrypt the card.

Riyan God Lord moved his right arm and the last card flew into Lin Xiu’s hands.

Soon, both Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng also picked their cards.

...

“Let’s go.”

Riyan God Lord then led them to another place.

As they walked past the wall covered with god-level warrior skills cards, there was a dark tunnel.

It was a long one and it looked endless.

Plus, it was terrifyingly quiet as there wasn’t a single sound heard.

They suddenly felt as if they had been cut off from the rest of the world.

Lin Xiu furrowed his brows as he could feel that something wasn’t right.

Riyan God Lord, who was leading the way, did not say a single word and continued swiftly moving forward.

Yuan Zheng also felt that something was off.

As he looked around, he couldn’t help but try to call out Lin Xiu and Xiao Qingchen.

But, when he tried to speak, there was no voice coming out of his mouth!

What on earth was happening?!

Yuan Zheng’s eyes were opened wide.

Even when he tried to speak again, there was no voice.

This space was completely cut off from the rest of the world. They would not be able to hear anything and they couldn’t even make any noise.

In such a situation, everything felt strange.

Yuan Zheng clenched his jaw and forced himself to stop thinking too much and continued walking.

Xiao Qingchen obviously knew what happened as well.

He kept quiet and continued walking.

Under such circumstances, if he wasn’t careful enough, it may have a bad effect on him.

Lin Xiu seemed to have entered such a space before in the past and this was nothing to him.

He only had to closely follow the Riyan God Lord.

They continued walking for some time and finally, there was a dim light that appeared before their eyes.

“We’re here?”

Yuan Zheng spoke in surprise.

Then, he noticed that he could finally hear his voice!

Back when they were in the tunnel, it was incredibly scary. He couldn’t hear anything but he had to keep walking. It was as if he was merely a zombie with no senses.

“Yes. We’re here.”

Riyan God Lord answered him calmly.

To him, this was a norm.

Then, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

This was because Lin Xiu could feel a horrifying energy coming from in front of him.

Tianling God King.

If he was right, Tianling God King should be right outside the tunnel!
