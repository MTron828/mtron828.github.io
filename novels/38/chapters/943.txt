Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu pointed at Nalan Rong in the sky and continued to speak.

“Courting death!”

At this time, Nalan Rong was completely furious.

Lin Xiu completely ignored his Nalan Rong!

“Elder Jiang, kill him!”

Nalan Rong roared fiercely at this time.

As soon as he finished speaking, Jiang Chong took the lead and flew toward Lin Xiu below.

swoosh—

A long sword exuding a cold light instantly appeared in Jiang Chong’s hand.

While rushing down, the long sword swung and a cold light flashed.

A terrifying crescent-shaped sword ray suddenly erupted. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He charged down directly towards Lin Xiu below.

Lin Xiu looked at this scene without any panic at all.

......

With a wave of his right hand, the Dark Edge sword in his hand directly charged towards this sword ray that seemed to be able to split space.

Boom—

At this moment, with a loud sound, this terrifying sword ray dissipated directly.

“Humph!”

At this moment, Nalan Rong snorted coldly, a ray of light flashed on his forehead and a source mark flashed out.

boom boom boom —

With the manifestation of his Source mark power, the ground on which Lin Xiu was standing was instantly pitch black, then there were a large number of black claws, coming up from the ground!

It was as if they were in hell and wanted to pull Lin Xiu down.

Lin Xiu raised his brows, the spear in his hand swung and a large amount of source strength burst out from his body.

The huge black claws on the surrounding ground were all shaken and dissipated by the source strength released by Lin Xiu.

Seeing this scene, the expression in Nalan Rong’s eyes changed slightly.

But at this time, without any hesitation, he also held the long sword in his hand and attacked Lin Xiu.

Nalan Rong and Jiang Chong, one left and one right, held the long swords in their hands and attacked Lin Xiu at the same time.

The long sword in Nalan Rong’s hand has a large amount of source strength passed on.

With the transmission of source strength, a large amount of flames suddenly appeared in the long sword in his hand.

At this time, the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand also burst into flames!

The flame of the spear body was dark blue and looked very strange.

Dangdang-

Brandishing his spear, he attacked Nalan Rong and Jiang Chong on the left and right.

As the weapons collided, there was a loud noise after another.

At this time, Jiang Chong and Nalan Rong’s faces were sinister.

The weapon in Lin Xiu’s hand was covered with a large amount of dark blue flames.

The temperature of these flames was really terrifying. Under the collision with the weapons in their hands, the terrifying temperature came, making them feel that their palms were hot.

It’s hard to hold a weapon.

Nalan Rong was the most shocked.

He was also a warrior who uses flames, but the flames used by Lin Xiu are obviously more terrifying.

This made Nalan Rong very uncomfortable.

Because he couldn’t display his specialties at all.

Moreover, Lin Xiu’s rage build-up kept rising during the battle with them and in the next moment, it was full!

Power-up strike!

Without the slightest hesitation, Lin Xiu directly used a power-up strike.

At this moment, the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand seemed to be filled with extremely strong power.

The long spear clanked and charged directly towards Nalan Rong!

Dead meat! Nalan Rong was shocked when he saw this scene.

The body subconsciously unfolded the ‘Sphere’!

But this shot was really too fast and with an extremely powerful force, it directly hit his ‘Sphere’.

boom–

The sharp point of the spear and the terrifying power directly broke through his ‘Sphere’ at this moment!

This is impossible!!!

Nalan Rong looked at his indestructible ‘Sphere’, which was pierced by Lin Xiu with such a single shot and he couldn’t help roaring in his heart.

Dang–

At this time, seeing that the tip of the spear was about to stab him in the forehead, Nalan Rong reacted quickly to block it with the body of his long sword.

A powerful force struck and his body flew out directly.

He slammed into the ground behind heavily.

The whole ground seemed to be shaking.

“Courting death!”

Jiang Chong roared when he saw this scene.

The long sword in his hand came straight out of his hand.

In an instant, thousands of long swords appeared in the air.

They all charged toward Lin Xiu!

“Go to… hell!!!”

Jiang Chong roared angrily, mobilizing the energy of his entire body.

When the thousands of long swords in the sky stabbed toward Lin Xiu, they all made a loud smashing sound.

It was as if the space was about to be ripped apart.

It could be seen that this was Jiang Chong’s most powerful and terrifying blow.

“Either you die or I die!”

Jiang Chong continued to roar loudly.

Looking at the thousands of sharp swords charging toward him, Lin Xiu remained calm and suspended in the air with the levitation technique.

Holding the Dark Edge spear in both hands, with the transmission of source strength, the Dark Edge spear has become like amethyst-colored glass.

And at this time, the spear body slowly released a white light.

The source strength of the whole body, frantically gathered towards the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand!

“Heaven Breaking… Strike!”

Seeing the thousands of long swords slamming into front of him, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand slashed directly.

Boom—

An extremely terrifying force burst forth directly!

Those thousands of long spears were immediately annihilated!

The terrifying power instantly charged towards Jiang Chong in the sky!

“No!”

Jiang Chong roared loudly when he saw this scene.

But that terrifying power directly split him into two halves when he unfolded the “Sphere”!

Respected warrior, dead!

In the air, because of Lin Xiu’s blow just now, a huge hole appeared.

“What… what a terrifying power…”

At this time, when the warriors in Sand River City saw this scene in the sky, the expressions in their eyes changed greatly.

This power broke even the space!

Only the strength of a Sage warrior-level warrior can do it…

“Old Jiang!”

Nalan Rong got up from the ground, ignoring the pain in his body, watching Jiang Chong, who was beheaded by Lin Xiu in the air, and couldn’t help roaring loudly.

Jiang Chong was killed, what about him?

Thinking of this, Nalan Rong suddenly felt a chill.

Looking at Lin Xiu, his eyes were filled with infinite fear.

“Don’t come here!”

At this time, Lin Xiu just turned to look at Nalan Rong.

Nalan Rong looked at Lin Xiu’s body and couldn’t help trembling.

At this moment, Nalan Rong has no intention of fighting at all.

Because the strength that Lin Xiu showed just now is really terrifying.

It almost completely suppressed him and the fire-type skills he used were restrained by Lin Xiu, so there was no way to fight!

“I’m telling you! I’m from the Divine Domain! Divine Domain forces are all over the world…”

Seeing that Lin Xiu still had killing intent in his eyes, Nalan Rong roared.

“Goodbye!”
