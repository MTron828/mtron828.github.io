Chapter 4: You Can’t Call Me Trash From Now On!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Xu Jun, be gentle.” Luo Li had a headache. He did not expect Lin Xiu to be so impulsive, but he had no other choice and could only warn Xu Jun.

After all, they were his students and if anything were to happen, he had to take responsibility as the teacher-in-charge.

“En, I will guide Lin Xiu well.” Xu Jun nodded his head and sneered.

He made his move at this moment!

Xu Jun was a beginner warrior with an extremely powerful physique. He charged right at Lin Xiu and raised his enormous fist with the intention to smash onto Lin Xiu’s body.

“Bang!” Lin Xiu immediately reacted by blocking with both hands, but he still felt the intense pain from the attack.

The restoration liquid he had just used had healed all of the internal injuries in his body. His current physique had risen from 33 to 35 points.

Although it was a marginal difference of just 2 points, Lin Xiu could feel that his body was completely different from before.

And it immediately rose by another 20 points due to the anger from Xu Jun’s fist!

Impressive! He only had to keep avoiding and resisting now.

“Where can you hide!” Seeing that Lin Xiu was avoiding him repeatedly, Xu Jun immediately flew into a mad rage. His body flashed quickly toward Lin Xiu.

“Hahaha, as expected of a trash, you can only avoid him!” As they noticed that Lin Xiu was constantly escaping, several people started laughing and jeering at him.

This made Zhang Dong and Chen Li feel that Lin Xiu was a wolf in sheep’s clothing.

After all, they had personally witnessed the explosive power released by Lin Xiu that had directly knocked out Ma Qiang.

“30 points… 40 points…”

“Damn trash! If you have the guts, stop avoiding me!!” Xu Jun was infuriated at this point. Since there were so many spectators watching the fight, he wanted to kick Lin Xiu down to the ground. But Lin Xiu continued to dodge and showed no intent to attack.

Although Xu Jun would occasionally strike him, all his strikes would be blocked by Lin Xiu’s arms.

Luo Li’s eyes would occasionally reveal surprise. As the teacher-in-charge, he naturally understood Lin Xiu.

Even though Lin Xiu had trained and worked hard, his natural talent and physique were weak. This led to him feeling inferior and being the target of humiliation and bullying in school.

Who would have thought that this Lin Xiu seemed to have changed into a completely different person!

Although his strength was only average, Lin Xiu’s eyes revealed unwavering determination, something Luo Li had never seen before.

“Go and die!” At this moment, Xu Jun suddenly raged out and sent a powerful fist over!

“Can’t dodge this!” All the spectators remarked as though anticipating that Lin Xiu would fall to the ground.

“Ding! Your rage meter is full! Do you wish to unleash the power-up strike?”

“Yes!” Right before the fist landed on him, that voice in his head finally resounded.

Lin Xiu laughed fanatically and returned a fist right at Xu Jun!

“Seeking death!” Seeing that Lin Xiu did not avoid his fist strike but instead unleashed his own with the intent of competing in terms of power, Xu Jun’s eyes constricted.

“It’s over!” A girl cried out and immediately covered her eyes. Xu Jun was a beginner warrior and the strength of his fist was enough to crush Lin Xiu’s bones.

“Ahh!!” A scream came out, not from Lin Xiu but from Xu Jun!

The moment both fists met, Xu Jun was the one sent flying. Furthermore, his arm was distorted and his bones were clearly broken.

The entire place fell silent.

No one could believe their eyes, it was too strange and bizarre.

The trash, who was at the bottom in the school combat ranking, actually brought down an entry-grade martial artist? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Impossible! Impossible!” As if he had forgotten the pain in his arm, Xu Jun roared loudly.

“Quickly send him to the infirmary.” Although Luo Li was shocked, he was able to arrange for students to send Xu Jun to the infirmary to have his hand fixed.

“From now onwards, no one can call me trash!” Lin Xiu stood in his original position and glanced at everyone as he roared.

“So, so cool…” A few girls felt their hearts beating faster when they saw Lin Xiu’s tyrannical scene.

Lin Xiu was already good looking and excelled academically, but due to his frail body, he never had the opportunity to become a martial artist. In addition, he was constantly bullied by others, so no one ever fancied him.

But now, Lin Xiu looked as though he had been reborn.

Some of the girls had a glow in their eyes...

“Teacher Luo, can I go to District A20 for the actual combat training?” Lin Xiu walked over and asked Luo Li.

Although District A20 had zombies and mutated beasts, he would be able to kill the mutated beasts and gain even more experience if he moved there. If it went according to plan, he could even deal with the zombies.

At that time, as long as he could raise his potential, much less being an ordinary person, time would be the only restriction if he wanted to overtake the powerful martial artists in school!

“You may.” Luo Li gave a bitter smile and replied after a long silence.

“How did you do it?”

He realized that he could not see through or understand the student in front of him. The power unleashed by Lin Xiu had reached the intensity of a true martial artist.

But the current Lin Xiu standing in front of him was clearly someone who had yet to even reach the entry-grade martial artist level!

‘Could he be training in some powerful fist art that granted him a great burst of power in an instant?’

‘Impossible, his physique isn’t able to withstand or capable enough to cultivate in that.’

“That’s a secret.” Lin Xiu gave a mysterious smile and answered.

The news of Lin Xiu beating Xu Jun spread across the campus. Although Xu Jun was only a beginner warrior, he was not lacking and was not some unknown figure at the back of the school rankings.

But the crucial thing was that Lin Xiu’s combat abilities were at the bottom of the list with a trash value of 250 points, and yet he was able to defeat Xu Jun, a beginner warrior. This had changed everything.

Adding the people that went to further investigate and found out that Ma Qiang was similarly beaten on the same day by Lin Xiu, the news circulated even quicker around the campus.

But Lin Xiu did not care about this, while Zhang Dong and Chen Li did not dare return to the dorm that night. Ma Qiang’s defeat could be considered a slight surprise, but for Lin Xiu to defeat Xu Jun, the two of them who had yet to become beginner warriors did not dare return.

They were afraid of being beaten to a pulp by Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu applied some ointment in the dorm. Although he was constantly in the defensive position in the battle with Xu Jun, his opponent was a beginner warrior and had left many wounds on his body.

He had to prepare well after obtaining the qualifications to enter District A20’s actual combat; he had to kill zombies and mutated beasts and continue to progress!
