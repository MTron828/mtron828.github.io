Chapter 826: Awakening

Lin Xiu, who heard this voice, froze in place.

The long spear in his hand was almost unstoppable.

The body trembled slightly.

This is the pinnacle of Marqi planet. The hinterland below is very dangerous. It is impossible for ordinary warriors to come here.

Because the king-level evolved beasts below will kill all the warriors who come.

For those king-level evolved beasts, this is their territory.

Now this voice, except himself, only one person can say it.

“you’re awake.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were slightly red, then he turned around and looked over.

He saw Luo Yue had opened her eyes that had been tightly closed for an unknown amount of time.

Six months.

It has been half a year since that day, Luo Yue, Luo Yue finally woke up.

When she was about to stand up, she looked a little shaky.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu rushed up, then hugged Luo Yue.

Because she slept too much, Luo Yue was obviously a little uncomfortable at this time.

“Be careful.”

Lin Xiu said quickly.

“You’ve grown a beard.”

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu’s beard and couldn’t help showing a smile and said.

“I’ll shave it off when I get back to the city.”

Lin Xiu also smiled and said.

Looking at Luo Yue, Lin Xiu’s eyes were filled with tenderness.

Now he is so excited that he doesn’t know how to express his feelings.

clap clap-

At this moment, a pea-sized raindrop suddenly fell in the sky.

Lin Xiu waved his hand and at this moment, a huge matrix suddenly appeared and wrapped the two of them.

There is no way for the rain to drip down.

All are blocked by this matrix.

Now it is obviously a scorching sun, but it is raining heavily. It does look a little weird.

“look.”

Lin Xiu hugged Luo Yue’s shoulder, let Luo Yue lean on his body, pointed to the front and said.

From the top of this cliff, if you look into the distance, you can clearly see that there are rainbows one after another in the distance.

It looks like you are in a dream.

“This is Rainbow Mountain.”

“What a nice view.”

Luo Yue looked into the distance with a smile in her eyes.

“you knew?”

Lin Xiu said in surprise.

“In a dream, I seem to have dreamed that you took me through many places.”

“The longest river, the Black River, the city of ice and snow, the city of moonlight...”

Luo Yue said with a faint smile at this time.

“This is not a dream, we have traveled so many places.”

Lin Xiu touched Luo Yue’s white hair and said with a smile on the corner of his mouth.

But looking at Luo Yue’s white hair, his heart couldn’t help aching.

“I’m sorry, I said I wouldn’t hurt you again, but...”

Luo Yue covered his mouth, then shook her head.

The two looked at each other, as if everything was spoken in silence.

“I’ll show you the scenery over there.”

At this time, the rain stopped and after Lin Xiu came into contact with the power of the matrix, his mind moved.

Then he put his hand to his mouth and suddenly there was a crisp sound.

A huge figure flew over from there.

This is a snow-white bird that looks similar to the legendary phoenix.

At this time, it flew over and stood on the top of the mountain, looking at Lin Xiu.

“This is... the Snow White Phoenix?”

Luo Yue said in surprise.

This is the most beautiful bird on the planet March.

Luo Yue likes to read books very much. After arriving on Marqi’s planet, she has read almost all kinds of books, so she can also know that this is Snow White Phoenix.

King-level evolved beasts harbor deep hostility towards humans.

Generally speaking, there is no way for warriors to tame it.

“When it was a young bird, it was surrounded by other evolved beasts. I saved it.”

Lin Xiu touched the head of the Snow White Phoenix and said aloud.

The Snow White Phoenix seemed to be very comfortable and took the initiative to rub its head against Lin Xiu’s hand.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu directly hugged Luo Yue at this time and under Luo Yue’s exclamation, the two rode on the body of the Snow White Phoenix Bird.

“Xiao Xue, let’s go!”

Lin Xiu laughed and shouted.

Lin Xiu repeatedly felt that he had never been so happy before.

The Snow White Phoenix made a shriek, waving a pair of snow-white wings and flew directly to the other side.

Flying in the air, looking down from the air, you can have a panoramic view of all the beautiful scenery.

At this moment, Luo Yue was hugged by Lin Xiu and sat in front of Lin Xiu, her eyes looking down, she was amazed.

What a beautiful scenery and Lin Xiu was there, making her feel extremely enjoying this moment.

“It would be nice if time could stop here.”

Luo Yue said aloud as if talking to herself.

“We have a lot of time.”

Lin Xiu hugged her and said with a smile.

Today, he is indeed too happy.

For half a year, Luo Yue finally woke up.

The next morning, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue appeared in a city here.

Dark City.

Next to the Dark City, there is the longest river in the world, the Black River.

“According to the information, it should be here.”

Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue.

Today, Lin Xiu got a message from the Warrior Union website.

In the dark city, someone recruited a group of warriors to find the treasures in the dark city.

The reward is a life crystal.

The life crystal is an extremely rare thing on the Marqi planet.

It is said that this kind of thing can make people live forever.

Of course, this is just an exaggeration, but the life crystal can prolong the life of those who have suffered some kind of severe trauma.

Especially for someone like Lin Xiu who has overdrawn his vitality.

When the two appeared in the Dark City, they attracted the attention of many people.

A combination of a handsome man and beautiful woman.

Especially Luo Yue’s snow-white hair and her delicate and cold face, as if she was an ice beauty from the snow.

“My strength seems to have recovered to about 80% of its original strength now.”

Luo Yue said a little surprised at this time. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Lin Xiu smiled, then held her cold little hand.

In the past six months, he has transmitted the source power into her body every day and while maintaining her physical energy, she has also slowly recovered her strength.

“It won’t take long for you to fully recover your strength and make a lot of progress.”

Lin Xiu said.

“En.”

Luo Yue nodded lightly.

She felt her hand being held by Lin Xiu and at the same time as she felt a warmth passing over, a touch of red seemed to appear on her white and tender cheeks.

Squeak-

According to the location of the mission, the two quickly came to a relatively remote place in the Dark City.

Pushing open the door over there, they saw a lot of people in the courtyard.
