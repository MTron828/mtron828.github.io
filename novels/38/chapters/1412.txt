1413 Finally Gathered Them All

“Ahem…”

Time was enjoyable until Lin Xiu heard an unpleasant disruption from behind him.

Lin Xiu frowned. When he opened his eyes, he saw Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng standing right in front of him.

Both of them looked awkward.

!!

“You’re here?”

Lin Xiu let go of Luo Yue and asked about the both of them.

“We’re here.”

“Both of us got really good items!”

Xiao QIngchen and Yuan Zheng both looked excited.

“What did you pick?”

Lin Xiu got curious.

“Look!”

Xiao Qingchen laughed as he took out a piece of electric energy stone from his pocket.

“Blue Dot Energy Stone! It strengthens my lightning bolts! Plus, I can mount it on my weapon!”

With the protection of the energy barrier, it wouldn’t hurt his hands even if he took them out with bare hands.

“I got a dagger.”

Yuan Zheng then showed the one in his hands.

As the dagger was drawn, Lin Xiu could see a bright glow flashing across his eyes.

Yuan Zheng laughed.

“Well, it would be a little difficult to break yours.”

He suddenly thought of Lin Xiu’s tough ‘sphere’ and let out a bitter laugh.

Now.it seems like his item didn’t seem special at all.

“Looks like both of you got something nice.”

Lin Xiu smiled as well.

“Oh! Lin Xiu, are you headed back to God’s City with us?”

Xiao Qinchen thought of something and quickly asked Lin Xiu about his plans.

“No. I don’t think I’ll be going back.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

Then, Lin Xiu took out the Water of Life from his expansion space and threw it to Xiao QIngchen.

Xiao Qingchen saw that Lin Xiu was throwing something at him and quickly caught it with both hands.

This was the Water of Life!

“I’ll pass it to the both of you so that you can complete the mission. I don’t think I’ll be going back.”

“As for my part of the reward, both of you can split it amongst yourself.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

He no longer cared about these rewards.

“You really aren’t heading back?”

Xiao Qingchen couldn’t help but ask once again.

They have found the Water of Life and the God King will definitely reward them handsomely but Lin Xiu rejected him immediately.

“I won’t.”

“We shall meet again if we have the chance.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“Alright.”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng looked at each other before bidding farewell to Lin Xiu.

Boom boom

Suddenly, the entire city started shaking violently.

What’s happening?!

The rest of the warriors were shocked as well when they felt the tremor.

As they turned towards the huge gates, they noticed that the gates were now closed!

“Do not panic. There has been an error in the security system and we are fixing it now.”

Mr Sima’s figure appeared in the air and his voice travelled into everyone’s ears.

“We will have them fixed soon and you will be able to leave freely.”

The rest of the warriors felt relieved after hearing the announcement from Mr Sima. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Mr Sima was like a God for most of the warriors. Most people were still willing to believe his words.

“Alright. Guess we’ll still have to wait. I shall start cultivating first.”

...

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng sat on the ground.

The ground here was sparkly clean with no dust seen at all.

“Well, I also have to fix my weapon.”

Lin Xiu informed Luo Yue about it.

Then, both of them sat on the ground, side by side.

After entering his expansion space, Lin Xiu noticed that he still had a lot of Divine Soul Water.

‘Oh, right! I still haven’t drank any of these.’

“Luo Yue, would you like something to drink?”

Lin Xiu then brought out a few bottles of them.

“So you do have an expansion space…”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was holding onto a few bottles of drinks that were golden in colour, Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng were both shocked.

...

Lin Xiu smiled and did not say a word.

“Wait, this is…”

Xiao Qingchen’s eyes were wide open when he saw the golden fluid.

“Oh! I think they are called Divine Soul Water.”

Lin Xiu spoke up.

“What the!”

Xiao Qingchen wanted to swear after hearing what Lin Xiu said.

“Divine Soul Water?! How did you get them?!”

Lin Xiu was taking them as just normal water to quench his thirst?!

“These are treasures…”

Yuan Zheng stuttered as well by the sight of it.

“Just ignore them. I have lots of these. Just try to see if it tastes good.”

Lin Xiu noticed that Luo Yue was looking at him weirdly.

Luo Yue hesitated for a moment but emptied the bottle in one go.

Then, her eyes lit up.

“Is it delicious?”

Lin Xiu noticed the look on Luo Yue’s face and chuckled.

“En!”

It was obvious that the drink tasted good and Luo Yue also looked like she enjoyed it.

“Have more of it then. I have loads of them.”

Lin Xiu opened another bottle and emptied it instantly.

Then, his eyes lit up with surprise too.

This must be why Luo Yue said that it tastes good. It was indeed refreshing.

It was beyond words and it felt much better than taking cola.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng gulped secretly.

This was the Divine Soul Spirit that could nourish a warrior’s divine spirit and allow them to become even more powerful!

This was something that wasn’t easily available.

However, these two were emptying out bottles of them with no hesitation. Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng were both heartbroken.

“Here, you two have some as well.”

Then, there were two bottles of it that flew into their hands.

One bottle of Divine Soul Water wasn’t much and Lin Xiu finished it with just three gulps.

“Thank you!!!”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng did not refuse the water and grabbed tightly onto the bottle, as if they were worried that Lin Xiu would want it back any minute.

Well, this was the legendary Divine Soul Water, who in their right minds would reject it?

“Let’s try it.”

Xiao Qingchen twisted the cap in excitement and started tasting the water.

Lin Xiu no longer joined them and took out his Spirit Fire Energy Stone.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he looked at the energy stones that were burning at a high temperature.

He finally gathered all of them.

Then, he pulled out the Book of Reform and crushed the energy barrier around the Spirit Fire Energy Stone.

He immediately placed the stone into the Book of Reform!
