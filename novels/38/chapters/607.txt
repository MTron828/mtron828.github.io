Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The camera followed Lin Xiu and amongst the grass, several warriors were hidden inside.

These warriors seem to be ready to kill Lin Xiu with one blow.

Seeing this scene, Ouyang Hang couldn’t help but cursed. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Before starting the snatch match, he had a hunch that this would happen, but he never thought it would actually happen.

These people were simply too crafty – they were targeting the Sacred Region Academy.

When Zhao Qian saw this scene, he knew that his captain had teamed up with others to get rid of Lin Xiu first.

But how did Lin Xiu end up being the winner in the end?

At this time, he continued to look at the screen projection, and he found that Lin Xiu, who was about to be attacked by a group, moved the Dark Edge spear in his hand, and suddenly a powerful skill was released. Those warriors who surrounded Lin Xiu were all sent flying!

This scene was really shocking. The warriors who watched this scene widened their eyes in disbelief.

One move, just one move, all the six powerful warriors who ambushed him were knocked out!

This wasn’t a performance, it was a real battle!

These people were speechless. They continued to look at the projection on the screen, and they could clearly see that Lin Xiu was continuing to move.

This time, Lin Xiu walked towards the front.

They didn’t know what ability Lin Xiu relied on. Soon, one after another warrior was discovered by Lin Xiu, and then they were all dealt with.

All of them were dealt with in one blow and they didn’t have the slightest chance to fight back.

“Now they are seriously injured and have already gone to the hospital for treatment.”

As the screen projection ended, the old man said lightly.

Although Lin Xiu didn’t make a deadly move, he definitely made a ruthless move. These warriors wouldn’t recover so easily.

“Okay, does any of you still have any questions?”

The old man looked around and said aloud.

The surrounding warriors were silent at this time. Lin Xiu had left them in total shock.

This was one person fighting more than 50 warriors!

“I’m not convinced! He must have taken forbidden drugs to have such a strong power!”

Zhao Qian’s face was gloomy, and in the next moment, he pointed at Lin Xiu and shouted loudly.

“How about he continues to fight against us now!”

“When he came out just now, the machine has already checked and everything is normal.” Wu Tian, ??the head of the Warrior Union branch, frowned slightly at this time, and then said aloud.

Hearing the old man’s words, Zhao Qian clenched his hands into fists, and seemed to be very angry.

“Sure.” Lin Xiu walked out at this time, then looked at Zhao Qian and said aloud.

Zhao Qian was the one who suggested it but when he saw Lin Xiu walking out, his heart shuddered, and his body trembled a little.

After all, judging from the situation just now, Lin Xiu’s strength was really terrifying.

If it was one-on-one, he has no chance of winning at all.

“But if you’re alone, you’re really too weak, why don’t all of you fight against me together!”

The Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s right hand turned, and after drawing an arc, it stopped for a moment. The spear pointed at the many warriors in front of him.

All together!?

When the warriors heard Lin Xiu’s words, they were all shocked.

“Did you hear that! He told us to go together!”

Zhao Qian reacted at this time, and then shouted loudly!

At this moment, an ecstatic look appeared on his face. Just now, he thought that Lin Xiu was really going to fight him alone and he was still a little scared.

But now, seeing Lin Xiu so arrogantly challenge all the academy’s warriors, Zhao Qian couldn’t help but burst into laughter.

This was simply arrogance to the extreme!

There were more than 200 warriors around here. If they all joined hands, no matter how strong you are, you will be beaten to death!

“You are simply courting death!”

“Too arrogant! Do you think you are really invincible?”

“Fight! Fight with him!”

“...”

The surrounding warriors were all angry at this time, and a large number of voices came over in a short time.

“Hey, don’t look for death for fun!”

Ouyang Hang was already breaking out in cold sweat at this time, and even he felt that Lin Xiu was too arrogant.

He wanted to challenge over 200 warriors alone ah!

It would be an exaggeration if he could win.

Ouyang Hang absolutely did not believe that Lin Xiu could win, even though Lin Xiu’s performance just now was really shocking.

When Huang Zhen and Qian Yao wanted to persuade Lin Xiu at this time, Baili Haoling suddenly smiled and said, “Hahaha, my disciple really has my demeanor, kill them for me!”

She said while waving her little fist.

And the old man Wu Tian touched his white beard at this time, but he didn’t have any intention of stopping this. Instead, there was a curious look in his eyes.

He wanted to see how Lin Xiu would fight against so many warriors.

“This is crazy...”

And the staff member kept talking to himself at this time, his eyes were full of shock.

“Then, let’s go!”

Lin Xiu continued to point his spear at them, and said aloud.

“Go to hell!”

Zhao Qian looked at how arrogant Lin Xiu was, coupled with his hatred for the Sacred Region Academy, he could not bear it anymore. Holding his golden-backed machete, he took the lead in attacking Lin Xiu!

As he rushed over, the warriors at the back all rushed over too!

The whole scene went out of control in an instant!

“Damn!”

Seeing this scene, Ouyang Hang and others quickly retreated to the back.

“Lin Xiu, run!”

Ouyang Hang called out subconsciously at this time.

But he didn’t see Lin Xiu running away, instead he attacked directly!

Looking at Zhao Qian who was at the front, a sneer appeared at the corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth. Holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he instantly collided with Zhao Qian’s golden-backed machete!

Boom–

A dull sound resounded in an instant. Before Zhao Qian could use his skill, he felt his arm go numb, and the weapon flew out instantly!

Zhao Qian’s eyes widened, and when he was about to move, Lin Xiu swept him up and directly knocked him out!

Boom—

His whole body flew out and instantly hit the stone wall behind him, making a loud noise.

The powerful impact caused a large amount of blood to burst out of his body instantly.

The rest of the warriors were also besieged!

Lin Xiu saw this scene in his eyes, and the Dark Edge spear he held in both hands instantly burst into flames, covering the entire spear body, and in the next moment, he waved it!

“Awe of the.... Phoenix!!!”
