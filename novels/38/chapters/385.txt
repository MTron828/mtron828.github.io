Chapter 386: Learned A New Skill!?

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s was like an immovable mountain, allowing the lightning to smash his body.

And Lan Tu saw that there wasn’t the slightest hint of pain on Lin Xiu’s face, he even looked slightly excited.

Seeing this scene, the corners of his mouth twitched.

Is this guy… still a human?

“Get out of here!” Lan Tu was in a daze when a guardian suddenly called out to him.

“En.” Hearing this, Lan Tu came back to his senses, then left the place directly. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He couldn’t stay in this horrible scene any longer. If he got hit by lightning a few more times, he could possibly die!

Boom boom——

As the guards evacuated all the warriors, they saw Lin Xiu standing there, allowing the lightning to strike him continuously.

When they saw this scene, their eyes were filled with surprise.

Ever since they started being a guardian, they had never seen anyone who wasn’t afraid of lightning.

This is really amazing.

What exactly is going on!?

Li li——

And the thunderbirds in the sky seemed to become more irritable. After shrieking, they rushed directly to Lin Xiu below!

Lin Xiu, who was still suffering and happy, suddenly felt that the lightning disappeared and was stunned.

He looked up and saw the huge thunderbirds rushing towards him!

“Fuck!” Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but curse.

At this moment, a thunderbird had already rushed to Lin Xiu and the huge bird’s beak was about to peck at him.

But fortunately, Lin Xiu’s reaction speed was very fast and he easily dodged the attack.

Its beak hit the ground directly, making a loud noise.

But this was not over yet. The thunderbirds behind continued to rush towards Lin Xiu in a frenzy!

The bodies of these thunderbirds were covered with lightning and their wings were very sharp. When they got close to Lin Xiu, they waved their wings and Lin Xiu could hear the swish in the air.

“What exactly is going on…”

The guards were completely stunned.

What happened tonight was really weird. Not only was there an unusual concentrated and terrifying lightning storm, but the thunderbirds that had always been relatively gentle had gone crazy. Usually, if no one took the initiative to attack the thunderbirds, they wouldn’t attack either.

“Report to the dean quickly!” A guard came to his senses at this time and shouted to his companion.

Lin Xiu was now avoiding the attacks of these thunderbirds.

Lin Xiu didn’t know why these thunderbirds would attack him suddenly.

Thunderbirds feed on thunder and lightning. Could it be because he was constantly absorbing the power of these lightning strikes and they thought that he was stealing their food?

Lin Xiu was dumbfounded.

But there were a lot of these thunderbirds. Although the thunder and lightning did not cause fatal damage to Lin Xiu, it still made Lin Xiu’s body slightly numbed.

At this time, his reaction obviously slowed down.

At the next moment, Lin Xiu’s body was hit by a thunderbird and his body was smashed on the ground by this powerful force.

And before Lin Xiu stood up, a large number of thunderbirds from behind continued to charge over frantically.

“It’s over, he’s doomed!” The remaining guards who were observing the situation saw a large number of thunderbirds rushing towards Lin Xiu and was began to surround him. They couldn’t even see his figure anymore.

“What!!!” On the other side, the face of Nan Zhengjun who suddenly received the news also changed.

Something like this actually happened on the final night. He also found out that the person who stayed on top and was attacked by thunderbirds was Lin Xiu!

Now he has no time to think so much as he hurried out of the office and walked over there.

Thus incident has shocked many senior students and many student leaders were rushing over.

Crackling——

Just when the guards saw a large number of thunderbirds rushing to Lin Xiu, they thought that Lin Xiu was going to be pecked by the thunderbirds until only his skeletons were left. Suddenly, a weird sound rang out.

In the gaps among the thunderbirds that were surrounding Lin Xiu, there was a large amount of white light bursting out.

Boom——

With a loud explosion, a flash of terrifying lightning burst out directly, causing all the thunderbirds that surrounded Lin Xiu to be shaken out.

“Damn!” A guard was completely dumbfounded when he saw this scene.

Looking at the huge bodies of those thunderbirds, they quickly dodged to avoid being hit as all of the thunderbirds were sent flying from this sudden horrifying lightning.

“Damn, these birds are really ruthless with their beaks.” Lin Xiu panted as he looked at his torn clothes and wounds on his body.

There was still a huge bolt of lightning on Lin Xiu’s body now that surrounded him.

Lin Xiu looked at the lightning on his body, surprised.

Just now when Lin Xiu was besieged by those thunderbirds, he wanted to burst out the source strength from his body and send these thunderbirds flying out.

But he didn’t expect that the source strength that he had burst out could actually be turned into lightning.

This was really beyond Lin Xiu’s expectations.

“Could this… also be considered a skill!?” Lin Xiu gasped in shock.

He learned a special skill by accident!

But before Lin Xiu could think about it, the thunderbirds that had just been shaken out began to flap their wings again and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

These thunderbirds attract thunder to absorb lightning so lightning had no effect on them. They were just simply sent flying from the impact.

“Okay, you guys still want to attack me huh. Although lightning is useless, with the ‘Rupturing Fist’, I don’t believe that I can’t beat you!” Lin Xiu got angry at this time and said to himself. At the same time, his fists were clenched and his knuckles cracked.

“Go to hell!”
