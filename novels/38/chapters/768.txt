Chapter 769: Terrifying Evolved Beasts

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, An Qi and Qian Lin subconsciously held the spears in their hands and stabbed directly!

At this time, Lin Xiu pointed at An Qi and Qian Lin while dealing with the evolved beasts rushing down from the mountain peaks on both sides.

These two people already had the foundation of using spears. At this time, under Lin Xiu’s guidance, they began to slowly improve.

After all, he had been using a long spear for so long and read a lot of books on spears in the Tower of Trials before getting on the plane. Now Lin Xiu was very proficient in spear techniques.

And An Qi and Qian Lin, under Lin Xiu’s guidance, also showed surprises.

At this moment, while listening to Lin Xiu’s instructions, they frantically waved their spears and killed those evolved beasts that looked terrifying. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

There were too many evolved beasts and there were also a lot of people flocking to Lin Xiu and the others.

“They’re all rank 8... too low!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly, the Dark Edge spear spun in Lin Xiu’s hand, then waved it in the air and the flaming birds were released directly!

As soon as those killer bees were hit by the flaming birds, they were immediately burned by the flames.

This bee-like evolved beast is very afraid of flames.

In his mind, there are a lot of prompts for killing evolved beasts and gaining experience.

But Lin Xiu didn’t pay attention to it, because just by looking at the experience progress bar of leveling up, you can probably know how much experience you have gained.

The experience increased by only 0.1% – it was really too little!

But even so, Lin Xiu frantically waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand and while releasing the flaming birds, he held the spear and stabbed the evolved beast towards him!

Roar–

The Raging flame lion over there seemed to feel pain in his body because of the attacks of many warriors and became even angrier.

Its pair of huge wings that seemed to be formed of flames flapped constantly, resisting a large number of attacks.

And because it became furious, the entire evolved beast became extremely crazy, then charged toward the surrounding warriors.

The huge and sharp claws waved wildly.

Some warriors were caught off guard and were directly sent flying, hitting the stone wall in the distance heavily. The whole person spat out blood from their mouth and died directly.

And at this time, the Raging Flame Lion, who was in a state of rage, had already opened its mouth.

In an instant, a large amount of flames gathered in its mouth.

Soon, it slowly converged into a huge circular flame ball.

“careful!”

At this time, Qian Qiu Rong, who was suspended in the air and used his skills to attack the Raging Flame Lion, suddenly changed the look in his eyes.

Now it is not a matter for one person to deal with these Raging Flame Lion and it is impossible for one person to deal with it.

If too many high-level warriors die, it will be troublesome.

Qian Qiurong used his source strength to project his voice out and many people heard him.

In the next moment, the terrifying flame ball in the mouth of the Raging Flame Lion was sprayed out directly!

Boom—

At the next moment, this huge fireball hit.

Most of the warriors reacted and dodged, but there were still a few warriors who were directly bombarded by the huge and terrifying fireball.

The body was instantly annihilated.

And on the ground hit by the flames, there was a huge sound in an instant.

There was also a huge bottomless pit in the entire ground.

“Too...too terrifying...”

When Liu Pan saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

And the evolved beasts around are still rushing down here.

But Lin Xiu has already wiped out a lot.

In a short period of time, at least a thousand warriors here have died.

This number was astounding.

But the remaining warriors are relatively strong and they wouldn’t die so easily.

And the Raging Flame Lion only had a little wound on its skin at this time.

If they wanted to kill it, it will probably take a long time.

“By the way, do you say that the Raging Flame Lion likes to collect the belongings of the warriors killed by it?”

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something at this time, then said aloud.

“Yeah, it is said that the Raging Flame Lion has collected a lot of treasures, so many warriors want to kill it, then break into its cave to get its treasures.”

Liu Pan said while panting after killing an evolved beast.

Lin Xiu looked at the warriors on the other side who were frantically attacking the Raging Flame Lion and his eyes suddenly narrowed.

He seemed to have thought of an idea.

“You guys be careful.” Lin Xiu told them, then he took the spear and charged in the direction of the Raging Flame Lion!

“Where are you going!?”

Looking at Lin Xiu’s actions, Liu Pan and the others said subconsciously.

But at this time, Lin Xiu’s figure was like a phantom. He already rushed to the other side!

The Raging Flame Lion was still in a state of rage and it kept spitting out huge fireballs one after another from its mouth.

But those warriors have learned to be smart and they are not so easy to be hit.

A large number of warriors have already unfolded the ‘Sphere’ for protection.

Under the state of running the ‘Without a Trace’ body skill, Lin Xiu instantly charged past it from its side.

It was very easy and there was no danger at all, so he went straight over.

“Hmph, courting death!”

Seeing this scene, Qian Qiurong, who was suspended in the air, couldn’t help but snorted coldly.

As for Lin Xiu, he didn’t know that someone had already discovered this scene. At this time, he had already crossed the Raging Flame Lion and was behind it.

so easy?

At this time, Lin Xiu, who was just around the corner, couldn’t help but be surprised.

He looked to the front and found that there seemed to be many cracks on the ground and some magma appeared in the cracks.

The whole area was scorching hot.

Could it be that the magma reached here from the volcanic bottom of that mountain...

Lin Xiu subconsciously guessed.

Although the surrounding air seemed to be very scorching hot, for Lin Xiu, who had no problem even taking a bath in magma, this was nothing at all.

Just as he walked forward, something seemed to jump out of the magma in those cracks!

What’s this?!

Seeing this, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank.

Some lizards that looked like they were all fiery red jumped out of the magma and were trying to bite Lin Xiu!
