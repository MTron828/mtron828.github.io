1163 Killing Without Hesitation

Bang bang bang-

With a dull sound, the warrior’s body fell directly to the ground.

Their bodies were directly broken into two halves, looking extremely bloody.

Zhang Zhen’s body trembled slightly when he saw this scene in his eyes.

Terrible, it’s really too terrifying.

How powerful one must be to be able to kill so many powerful warriors with one blow.

“If you don’t go, you can stay here too.”

At this time, Lin Xiu, who was holding a spear, looked toward Zhang Zhen.

“We’ll go now!”

When Zhang Zhen saw Lin Xiu’s eyes, he felt a chill in his body.

At this time, while speaking, he turned around and ran.

The few warriors who were with him also left at this time.

After all, the strength Lin Xiu showed just now was really terrifying.

Even though Zhang Zhen was a warrior at the God warrior level, he clearly felt a strong sense of danger.

“I am going to kill you!!!”

At the same time, Lin Qing, who had just been blown away by Lin Xiu’s powerful force, ran back again at this time.

At this moment, his face was full of madness.

When did he, a dignified God warrior-level warrior, ever feel so embarrassed?

His body was filled with pale golden light.

These are all produced by the release of his source strength.

And at this moment, with a wave of his right hand, a sword on the ground flew into his hand.

Holding the sword in his hand, he directly attacked Lin Xiu’s body!

dang–

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he didn’t show any panic at all.

Holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he blocked it and suddenly a crisp sound broke out.

‘turbulent sword technique’!!!

At this moment, Lin Qing roared in his heart and the sword in his hand danced wildly.

As the sword in his hand danced, terrifying air currents attacked Lin Xiu’s body directly.

Those air currents were very terrifying and some surrounding buildings were hit and burst directly.

And Lin Xiu, at this time, didn’t have the slightest carelessness, he had already unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

It was easy to block the airflow created by the movement of his sword.

“Let’s see how you block this!!!”

Lin Qing watched Lin Xiu unfold a ‘Sphere’ to resist his attack and immediately roared, continuing to use his skill power to attack Lin Xiu!

This Lin Qing was indeed very strong and the use of the sword was also very sharp.

All his blows were life-threatening!

But he was not facing other warriors, this was Lin Xiu.

At this time, Lin Xiu unfolded his ‘Sphere’ to resist his attacks. At the same time, the spear in his hand collided directly with the sword he slashed over!

Dang dang-

His seemingly powerful swordsmanship was completely blocked by Lin Xiu’s spear the next moment.

And at this moment, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand burst out with a large amount of dark blue flames.

As these extremely hot flames appeared on the spear and collided with his sword, Lin Qing clearly felt the sword he was holding and it seemed to be extremely hot!

Damn it! What kind of flame is this!?

Lin Qing had a look of shock in his eyes at this time.

But at this time, Lin Xiu had already started to fight back and he didn’t give him the slightest chance to breathe.

‘Profound Intent.Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

Whoosh whoosh—

At this moment, Lin Xiu had already started to use his skills!

The moment the spear was pierced, it seemed to turn into thousands of spear shadows.

A lot of cold light, like the twinkling of stars!

Lin Qing looked at this scene and the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

Terrible, it’s really terrifying!

At this time, he had no choice but to unfold his ‘Sphere’ to resist this attack.

bang bang bang-

The spearhead of the spear stabbed frantically on the ‘Sphere’ he unfolded and a loud sound suddenly erupted.

“Ding! A fatal strike is triggered!”

At this moment, a crisp sound came from Lin Xiu’s mind.

Originally, Lin Qing wanted to resist Lin Xiu’s violent attacks and tried to counterattack but he suddenly felt an extremely terrifying force at this time.

Before he could react, his entire body exploded!

The members of the patrol team around looked at this scene and their eyes were filled with extremely shocked expressions.

Just now, Lin Qing’s source strength was obviously pale golden, which meant that Lin Qing was also a warrior of the god warrior level.

But this God warrior-level warrior was actually killed by Lin Xiu within such a short period of time!

How powerful is Lin Xiu to be able to easily kill a God warrior?

While they were afraid, they also respected Lin Xiu even more. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

It is of course a good thing for them to have such a powerful city lord.

“Dispose of the corpse.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu waved the spear in his hand and while the blood on the spear was swept out, he kept the spear in his expansion space.

“Yes!”

The warriors of the patrol team said respectfully at this time.

Many of the warriors who just entered this Lingxian City witnessed this scene. While they were shocked, they did not dare to do anything illegal in the Lingxian City.

While Lin Xiu was returning to the city lord’s mansion, he was shocked that the fatal blow was so strong.

The 3% fatality rate is actually quite high.

It’s a pity, it can only have an effect on the warriors who are weak.

But under the use of Torrential storm of rose flowers, the probability of it being triggered is ridiculously high.

After all, it was Torrential storm of rose flowers and now Lin Xiu was able to hit tens of thousands of shots in an instant!

“City Lord!”

At this time, when Lin Xiu had just returned to the City Lord’s Mansion, he saw Mr. Pang’s figure.

Mr. Pang seemed to be a little anxious. Seeing Lin Xiu coming back, he hurried to Lin Xiu.

“What’s wrong?”

Seeing that Mr. Pang seemed to be in a hurry, Lin Xiu asked.

“City Lord, a lot of warriors broke into the mansion just now and we couldn’t stop them.”

“And they also injured our guards…”

Hearing Mr. Pang’s words, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Lin Xiu heard the conversation with Lin Qing and Zhang Zhen just now.

If he guessed correctly, then Lin Qing, seems to have received some news and found out that the ancient ruins are in the City Lord’s Mansion.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu didn’t think much about it at this time and walked directly into the city lord’s mansion.

Mr. Pang quickly followed behind Lin Xiu.
