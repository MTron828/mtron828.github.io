Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, Lin Xiu attacked the rock giant who was attacking with a huge rock fist!

Boom—

As the spear collided with it, there was a loud noise.

The rock giant shattered into countless pieces in the next moment.

And at this time, Lin Xiu, still holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, continued to charge toward Bai Rui!

!!

When Bai Rui saw this scene, his face became extremely sinister. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He never imagined that the rock giant formed by his own power would be smashed to pieces by Lin Xiu so easily.

“Come here!”

Bai Rui roared and waved his right hand. At this moment, all the weapons scattered on the surrounding ground flew into the sky.

They flew to Bai Rui.

Those weapons were all assembled into a huge group, then formed a huge evolved beast.

Charging toward Lin Xiu who was fighting!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s expression changed slightly.

Holding the long spear in his hand, he attacked the behemoth composed of a large number of weapons, making a loud noise.

But Lin Xiu didn’t send this thing flying. Instead, his body was hit and retreated to the back.

“Die!”

Bai Rui roared and moved his hands. The giant beast formed by the gathering of weapons continued to attack Lin Xiu!

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu, who flew to the back, snorted coldly when he saw this scene.

In the next moment, the Dark Edge spear held in both hands swiped directly into the air.

Following the burst of flaming birds, they gathered in the sky to form a huge flaming phoenix!

At this moment, the flaming phoenix charged toward the giant beast formed by the weapons!

Boom—

With a loud sound, the giant beast formed by the gathering of weapons was instantly burned by this terrifying flaming phoenix until it melted into a pool of metallic liquid.

At this time, Lin Xiu used the ‘Flashing Souls’ body skill and his body instantly disappeared.

In the next moment, he appeared in front of Bai Rui!

When Bai Rui saw Lin Xiu who suddenly appeared, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

A source force was released, forming a source strength wall, blocking his front.

boom–

Lin Xiu’s spear hit the source strength wall, making a loud noise.

At this moment, a large number of cracks appeared in the source strength wall.

And Bai Rui, who was behind the wall, moved his right hand and a sword on the other side flew into his hand, slashing directly at Lin Xiu!

Whoosh whoosh—

At this moment, there was a sudden whooshing sound in the air and one after another huge sword aura rushed toward Lin Xiu!

As soon as Lin Xiu smashed the source strength wall, he saw the terrifying sword aura that came.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly. After the ‘Sphere’ of his body unfolded, all those attacks were blocked by Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

It didn’t cause any damage to Lin Xiu at all.

When Bai Rui saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

Now he really felt the power of Lin Xiu.

A sense of powerlessness instantly surrounded his heart.

Now, he no longer has the will to fight.

“Want to flee?”

Lin Xiu clearly felt that Bai Rui seemed to want to escape and snorted coldly at this moment.

When the body skill, ‘Flashing Souls’, was used, he appeared in front of Bai Rui in an instant.

“Go away!!!”

Looking at Lin Xiu who suddenly appeared in front of him, Bai Rui roared angrily.

The sword in his hand, full of source strength, slashed directly at Lin Xiu!

Dang–

But at this time, Lin Xiu directly blocked the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu’s whole body burst out and Bai Rui was knocked to the back.

While shaking Bai Rui away, Lin Xiu continued to attack with the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

Blood flowed from the corner of Bai Rui’s mouth and he wanted to hold the sword against Lin Xiu’s attack.

But at this time, he couldn’t resist at all.

Lin Xiu’s offensive was really too violent.

“Go to… hell!!!”

Soon, with Lin Xiu’s roar, the Dark Edge spear in his hand hit the sword in Bai Rui’s hand into the air and at the same time the spearhead stabbed at his forehead!
