Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Walking in the Bai Di City, Lin Xiu familiarized himself with the terrain and came to a hotel to prepare something to eat, then took the opportunity to inquire about the situation.

“B*tch, I called you over here, did you hear me!”

At this moment, a voice came from the front.

“You are shameless!”

As the man’s words just fell, another female voice, which seemed a little familiar, also came from there.

Um?

Hearing this voice, Lin Xiu raised his eyes and looked ahead.

He saw a group of men in a restaurant, surrounded by three women in white battle suits.

One of the women’s figures, Lin Xiu found it to be a little familiar.

“Tang Qi, don’t go too far!”

One of the women looked panicked and said aloud while stepping back.

“Arrogant? So what if I’m just so arrogant.”

“The ruler of your Hao Yue Sect, it is said that he was seriously injured when he went to the secret realm?”

At this moment, the man called Tang Qi narrowed his eyes slightly and greedily glanced at the three women.

Hearing Tang Qi’s words, the faces of the three women also became ugly.

They all belong to the Hao Yue Sect.

Every force was led by a top-level figure, so as to ensure that this force will not be eroded by other forces.

But the most powerful existence of their Hao Yue Sect was indeed severely injured because he encountered a crisis in the secret realm.

As soon as this matter spread, the surrounding forces began to eye the Hao Yue Sect.

Moreover, Hao Yue Sect has another characteristic: all the members of the Sect are female!

Those forces outside are even more eager on plotting evil.

“Hehe, so it seems, what I said is true.”

Tang Qi showed a strange smile at this time and with a smile, he continued to reach out to grab them.

“Impudent!”

One of the women snorted coldly and took the long sword in her hand and slashed at the hand that Tang Qi grabbed!

Tang Qi was startled, he quickly stepped back and dodged the sword.

“you wanna die!”

Tang Qi was also furious at this time and shouted angrily.

“Tie and take the three of them back!”

He let out a roar at this time.

The three warriors behind him were about to make a move.

Sage warrior!?

Lin Xiu clearly sensed the strength of one of the warriors and his eyes changed slightly.

He didn’t expect that after a meal, he could meet a Sage warrior-level warrior.

At this time, one of the women also attacked with a weapon.

The sound of the collision of weapons came out in an instant.

“Ji Mei?”

Lin Xiu subconsciously activated the Analytic Eye and the information about the woman who fought with the Sage warrior appeared.

No wonder Lin Xiu found the voice a little familiar just now.

When Ji Mei heard this voice, she was stunned. When she wanted to look back, the Sage warrior slapped her on the shoulder.

boom–

That powerful force made Ji Mei’s body fly straight out.

Lin Xiu stood up at this time. With a wave of his right hand and the release of source strength, Ji Mei, who was flying out, felt that her body was instantly stabilized, then slowly landed on the ground.

However, there was still a smear of blood flowing from the corner of her mouth.

She subconsciously wiped the blood from the corner of her mouth with her sleeve, then turned to look to the side and saw Lin Xiu’s figure clearly.

“Lin Xiu!?”

At this moment, she said in surprise.

“En.”

Lin Xiu smiled slightly and said lightly.

“Why are you here?

Her eyes were full of surprise.

It seems that she has forgotten the pain in her shoulder.

“Come here to play.”

Lin Xiu smiled lightly.

He also did not expect that after the Sage warrior Space, he would meet Ji Mei here.

“Boy, there are some things that you can’t meddle in.”

Tang Qi looked at Lin Xiu like that with a cold look in his eyes.

And at the same time, the other two women were restrained by the warriors beside Tang Qi.

At their necks, there are swords.

Almost all the warriors who were eating around left.

They didn’t want to be implicated.

“Let go of Bingbing and Lanlan!”

Ji Mei looked at her companion with a weapon around her neck and said suddenly.

“Let go?”

Tang Qi sneered at this time.

“Are you kidding me?”

“you…”

Hearing Tang Qi’s words, Ji Mei’s expression changed.

She clenched her hands tightly, but the strength of the Sage warrior beside Tang Qi was much stronger than hers.

Although they were also Sage warriors, there were also strong and weak among Sage warriors!

“Come here, stay with me for one night and this is over.”

He stared at Ji Mei and said with a sneer.

“Keep dreaming!” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As soon as he finished speaking, Ji Mei said angrily.

“Then you just want me to kill them?”

Tang Qi glanced at the corner of his eyes and said.

Ji Mei’s two peers were being held by his subordinates with swords around their necks.

“Ji Mei, ignore him, go back and tell the elders!”

At this time, one of the women said aloud.

“shut up!”

When the warrior heard her words, he shouted angrily and with a little force on the sword in his hand, a blood stain appeared on her fair neck.

“No!”

When Ji Mei saw this scene, she quickly said aloud.

“Then do you agree or not?”

Tang Qi said with a wicked smile at this time.

It seemed that he was set on getting Ji Mei.

“You’re making things so hard for her eh.”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

“What are you, is it a place for you to speak here?”

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, Tang Qi looked at him and said coldly.

His eyes were full of contempt.

Because Lin Xiu used the ‘Disguise’ skill, Lin Xiu’s strength now looks like the level of Respected warrior.

Moreover, he was disguising as a first-level Respected warrior and for them, it was indeed very weak.

Snapped–

Lin Xiu ignored his words and as Lin Xiu snapped his fingers, at this moment, a black source mark appeared on his forehead.

The arms of the two warriors holding the swords against the two women were framed by two matrices!

what is this!?

Looking at the translucent matrix that framed their arms, they were surprised.

Boom—

At the next moment, these two matrices exploded directly!

“what!!!”

A wailing and screaming sound came instantly.

The arms of these two people were directly blown to pieces!

what happened?!

The pupils in Tang Qi’s eyes shrank suddenly, then he looked behind him and saw that the arms of the two warriors broke off!
