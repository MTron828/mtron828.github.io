Chapter 440: Strong Match!

“What is this!?”

At this time, the audience was stunned by this scene.

Because now there was a lot of white light in the middle.

“Source field!?” Nan Zhengjun saw this scene and the look of both eyes did not change the giant.

This was a higher-level skill than the ‘Sphere’ and it releases the source strength of the whole body, then through one’s source strength, it affects all the warriors within the area.

Simply put, the one using this skill would become stronger but the other warriors within the range would weaken.

“You’re a rank 9 warrior!?” Yu Muchen’s pupils contracted and he asked Lin Xiu.

His eyes were filled with shock.

Because even he couldn’t use this source field! Lin Xiu actually used it so he was obviously shocked.

And as this Source field began to cover the platform, Yu Muchen could sense his strength being suppressed.

Swish swish swish——

Lin Xiu took the Dark Edge Spear and pointed to Yu Muchen, then said, “The real battle begins now.”

Lin Xiu could feel the strength in his body increasing.

‘Heavenly Array’, this was his new system skill after advancing to rank 6. He did not pay too much attention to it before, but now after Lin Xiu used it, he could sense that he became much stronger. Coupled with the influence of ‘Fury’, the strength of Lin Xiu under this state has reached the extreme!

But it was almost time and there were only 5 minutes left before ‘Fury’ wears off. Also, this ‘Heavenly Array’ only lasts just 5 minutes!

“Courting death!” Yu Muchen looked at Lin Xiu and roared as he waved his Heaven Painted Halberd, forming a golden crescent-shaped energy body and attacked Lin Xiu!

Loud swishing sounds resounded and they sounded like they could break through the entire space.

Lin Xiu’s pupils narrowed, then he leaned to the side slightly. This energy body went past Lin Xiu and hit the wall behind.

Bang—— Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

A long and deep dent appeared on the wall behind, and a large amount of debris fell.

These were not ordinary stones, but a building that was made with special rocks collected from another planet; the hardness of this architecture far exceeds those made with ordinary stone.

Lin Xiu dodged Yu Muchen’s hit and had a lingering fear like he had a brush with death.

However, Lin Xiu was holding the Dark Edge spear even more tightly and quickly rushed over.

His body was like a phantom.

Yu Muchen saw the scene and scoffed. Then, he held the Heaven-Painted Halberd and rushed to Lin Xiu!

Thump thump thump——

Under the collision of both weapons, defeaning sounds rang out.

The Heaven-Painted Halberd was moving towards Lin Xiu and even cut off some hair that was right next to Lin Xiu’s ear.

However, the Dark Edge spear was waved and a flaming bird burst out.

The flaming bird flew out and charged towards Yu Muchen!

Yu Muchen’s gaze changed and footsteps quickened, dodging the flaming bird in a split second.

But the flaming bird this time made a turn when Yu Muchen dodged and continued charging towards him.

Seeing this scene, Yu Muchen was obviously a bit angry and he waved his right hand to chop the flaming bird in half.

However, at this moment, there were countless flaming birds rushing towards him in another direction.

Moreover, these flaming birds collided together, combined into a fire phoenix that covered the whole platform.

‘Profound intent·Awe of the Phoenix’!!!

The audience was in an uproar when they saw this scene. The whole platform was like a stove at this moment and everyone was sweating buckets.

“Go!” Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge Spear and this huge flaming phoenix charged to Yu Muchen directly from the sky.

This flaming phoenix covered a very large area, coupled with its fast speed, Yu Muchen couldn’t dodge it!

Bang——

As the flaming bird crashed down, it was like a huge explosion and more than half of the platform was covered in a sea of fire. At the next moment, this flame began spinning wildly and formed a huge flame tornado!

“This guy…” Ouyang Hang saw this scene and was dumbstruck.

Although he didn’t want to admit it, Lin Xiu was simply too powerful.

As the fire tornado began to slowly dissipate, everyone was holding their breath to watch this scene unfold.

Swish——

They saw Lin Xiu’s figure rushing out from the flame and the spear in his hand collided with Yu Muchen’s halberd directly!

“Very well, there is actually a warrior who could still make me use my real strength.”

When the spear tip was pressed against the top of his halberd, Yu Muchen looked at Lin Xiu coldly and said.

Now, his body was protected by the ‘Sphere’ but there were still some burnt traces on his hair and he seemed battered.

“Same to you.” Lin Xiu’s eyes were icy and he said plainly.

Lin Xiu’s skill didn’t defeat him; he had to admit that this chap was really strong indeed!

The two people looked at each other and snorted coldly. In the next second, they put pressure on their weapons and retreated at the same time.

“‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!!!”

“‘Fury of the Thunder God’!!!”

When the two people retreated, they let out a roar at the same time and continued to wave the weapons in their hands!

The Dark Edge spear released a lot of black energy body and at the next moment, it has become a huge black dragon.

Yu Muchen waved his halberd as well and bolts of terrifying blue lightning burst out. He had actually formed a flash of dragon-shaped lightning and there was a charred smell in the air.

A gigantic dragon that was also formed by an energy body was about to collide together with the black dragon!
