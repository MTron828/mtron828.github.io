1368 Rollie Who Turned Into An Egg

The Netherworld Flame was a terrifying one.

Seeing how the flames were coming at him, the bald man quickly dodged to the side.

Boomo – –

The Netherworld Flame landed on the ground ahead, and there was an incredibly large explosion that ensued.

Lin Xiu sneered seeing what had happened and he continued attacking the bald man.

Lin Xiu’s flames were now covered with Netherworld Flame.

“Go to hell!!”

The bald man stared at Lin Xiu who was coming at him and he roared in rage. All of the dark energy inside him exploded almost immediately.

As the energy got released, all of them gathered together to form a huge black hand and it was headed directly for Lin Xiu.

Soon, Lin Xiu’s body was captured by those huge hands!

“Hahahahahaha…”

Seeing what had happened, the bald man gave off a cold laugh.

As he controlled it with his mind, the hands that had captured Lin Xiu started twisting around themselves, squeezing Lin Xiu like a piece of clothing.

This time, Lin Xiu is dead!

However, the pair of hands started shaking all of a sudden.

What on earth was happening?!

When the bald man noticed what was going on, he furrowed his brows.

Boom – –

Then, it was followed by an ear-deafening explosion and all of the dark energy instantly disappeared!

Pfft– –

As if he had suffered a major backlash. The bald man took a few steps backwards and spat out a mouthful of blood.

“That’s…..that’s impossible!”

His eyes were opened wide when he saw Lin Xiu’s figure floating in the air. He couldn’t believe what was going on!

“Well, there’s nothing that’s impossible.”

Lin Xiu spoke slowly.

“Did you think that only you know how to play with dark energy?”

As he spoke, Lin Xiu moved his right arm and suddenly, there was a large amount of dark energy released from his body!

‘Silence’!

As Lin Xiu controlled it with his mind, the dark energy was like a huge wave that rushed towards the bald man!

When the bald man saw what Lin Xiu was capable of, he was incredibly shocked!

He couldn’t believe that Lin Xiu could control dark energy!

Plus, the dark energy that he was in control of was much purer than what he had!

Run! He had to run!

This was the only thought in his mind. He had to escape from this because he could feel that he was no match for Lin Xiu.

Even after engulfing all of the energy from the other warriors, it still wouldn’t be enough.

However, no matter which direction he turned, he couldn’t run.

This was because he was completely surrounded by this dark energy.

“AHHHHH!!!!”

The bald man roared and tried to release more dark energy.

The dark energy of both parties then collided with each other.

There was a peculiar noise heard over and over again and soon, the dark energy released by the bald man was overpowered by those released by Lin Xiu.

At that instant, the bald man seemed to be completely enveloped by Lin Xiu’s dark energy.

Then, the dark energy around the bald man squeezed and twisted amongst themselves.

It instantly churned the man into a meat patty.

“Ding!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Congratulations on killing a god-level warrior. You have received 546464141…”

Then, there was a notification that popped out from the system to inform him of the EXP that he had received.

That’s how Lin Xiu knew that the man was dead.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and all of the dark energy instantly disappeared.

“Lin Xiu!”

At the same time, Baili Haoling and Lei Chong quickly rushed over to Lin Xiu’s side.

The battle happened quickly and it only lasted for a few minutes.

“Hmm? You’re here.”

Lin Xiu looked up and saw Baili Haoling and Lei Chong in front of him.

...

Rollie and Little Bai flew over as well and dived into Lin Xiu’s arms.

“Alright, alright.”

Lin Xiu was feeling ticklish as Little Bai and Rollie rubbed themselves on his neck.

“You….you killed all of the warriors here?”

Baili Haoling looked at the bodies on the ground and it was obvious that she felt shocked.

“En. All of them. Seems like they’re from Xingzhou.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

These warriors seemed tough and powerful but for Lin Xiu, this was nothing.

“City lord, your abilities seem to have grown stronger…”

Lei Chong stared at Lin Xiu. He could feel that Lin Xiu was now different from before.

It was obvious that he’s much stronger now.

...

“Well, it isn’t much.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

After absorbing the Netherworld Flame, not only did his abilities become stronger, the Netherworld Flame was also much stronger than the flames that he had before.

“Eat…”

Rollied spoke in a soft voice.

Then, it jumped to the ground, opened its mouth and started absorbing all of the warrior’s body into its mouth.

“It…”

Lei Chong was in disbelief when he saw what happened.

Lin Xiu stared at Rollie but he didn’t stop it from doing so.

Soon, all of the bodies on the ground had been eaten by Rollie, including the meat patty. Then, Rollie turned around and burped as if it was satisfied with the meal.

Suddenly, Rollie’s body started glowing brightly!

What was happening?!

Seeing the changes in Rollie caused Lin Xiu to be shocked.

“Hmm?”

Baili Haoling looked at it and she was surprised as well.

Rollie slowly closed its dark, shiny eyes.

Then, the glow around it started getting brightly and its body was slowly being covered by a white material.

The white particle then formed an egg shell around Rollie’s body.

Soon, Rollie turned into an egg.

“Rolllie!”

Baili Haoling was incredibly confused and she even knocked on the eggshell.

But, there was no response.

Plus, there was a soft glow that came from the egg and it gave the rest of them a warm feeling.

“Perhaps it’s evolving again…”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

Rollie had engulfed the meat patty made from the bald man and it must have been filled with energy.

There were also a few warrior god’s bodies on the ground along with a dozen of saint warriors, all of them also had large amounts of energy in them.

Perhaps after absorbing so much energy, it had caused Rollie to evolve.

“Alright. Let’s head back.”

Lin Xiu then carried the egg in his arms.

“Hmm. Let’s go.”

Baili Haoling nodded her head in agreement.

When all three of them returned to Lingxian City, the rest of the warriors quickly greeted Lin Xiu.

“Welcome back, City Lord!”

They have watched how Lin Xiu had killed the warriors who attacked their city and admired Lin Xiu even more.

Lin Xiu gently nodded his head in response and headed to the City Lord Mansion.

Due to how there had been a Energy Stone Conversion Device installed, the energy in the air around them have become much richer.

It felt comforting.

“Oh….I heard that Mr Pang got injured?”

As he walked into the mansion, he suddenly thought of something.

“En. Mr Pang was ambushed and he was severely injured. He’s still getting treated.”

Lei Chong nodded his head and updated Lin Xiu about Mr Pang.

“If it wasn’t because there were too many of them, I would have killed them all.”

Baili Haoling frowned as she complained.

Although they’ve managed to chase out the first batch of enemy that entered their city, there were too many of them later on. They were forced to release the energy barrier and remain a coward inside the city.

If Lin Xiu did not get back in time, the energy barrier would have been broken.

Once the energy barrier gets destroyed, the entire Lingxian City will be destroyed too.

As Lei Chong thought about it, he felt frightened.

“Mr Pang, the City Lord has returned.”

Lei Chong pushed open one of the doors.

“Cough cough….Is the City Lord back?”

There was a weak voice that came from inside.

When Lin Xiu took a closer look, Mr Pang was laid on the bed and he was looking pale.

His body was covered with wounds and all of them seemed to be rotting. It doesn’t look like they could be healed.

“City Lord…”

When Mr Pang saw that it was Lin Xiu, he wanted to stand up.

“There’s no need for you to get up.”

Lin Xiu quickly got Mr Pang to lay down.

“Didn’t you apply any medication?”

Lin Xiu noticed how the wounds on Mr Pang’s body still looked gruesome, he couldn’t help but question the rest of them in the room.

“We’ve tried every drug possible but Mr Pang’s injuries just wouldn’t heal.”

Lei Chong let out a bitter laugh.

“That’s impossible…..”

Lin Xiu then looked at the wounds himself and noticed that there were slight energy movements inside them.

Hmm?

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and then placed his hands on top of Mr Pang’s wounds.

Soon, the dark energy was like threads and slowly left the wounds, entering into Lin Xiu’s palms.

“This…”

Seeing what had happened, Lei Chong’s eyes were filled with disbelief!

“Dark energy?”

Baili Haoling frowned.

This must be why the wounds wouldn’t heal! It was because there was dark energy left inside that continued hurting Mr Pang!

“The ones that attacked him knew how to use dark energy.”

Lin Xiu slowly explained it to the rest of them.

Then, as the dark energy got absorbed into Lin Xiu’s body, he slowly controlled it with his mind and there were water droplets that appeared on Lin Xiu’s palms.

All of them were then placed on Mr Pang’s wounds.

Soon, all of the wounds started healing on their own.

Mr Pang’s face that looked incredibly pale earlier started looking pink.

“That’s…that’s incredible!”

Lei Chong’s jaw hit the ground.

These wounds that have been a headache to him for the past few days were healed by Lin Xiu!

“Just rest and you’ll be better soon.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

“Thank you, City Lord!!!”

Mr Pang was incredibly grateful toward Lin Xiu!

He didn’t think that all of the pain that he was feeling before would disappear immediately!

“Don’t worry about it.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and left with Rollie, who was now an egg.

What would Rollie turn into when it hatches? Lin Xiu was looking forward to it.
