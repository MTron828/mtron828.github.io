Chapter 457: If Something Happens To Him, I’ll Kill You

At the bottom of the sea, even a rank 9 warrior would be greatly reduced in strength.

After all, they don’t have the structure of a fish and their actions on the seabed were limited to a certain extent.

And at this time everyone in Sacred Region academy heard a loud scream.

“Look! Isn’t that the rank 9 flaming bird!?” At this time, some students of Sacred Region academy saw the scene in front of them.

They saw the terrifying rank 9 mysterious flaming bird flying in the air for a while and the air around it seemed to have become distorted.

Taking a closer look, there was someone on top of it.

“Bai… Dean Baili!?”

“Destroy them.” At this time, Dean Baili rode on the body of the rank 9 Flaming Mysterious Bird, his eyes focused on the evolved beasts emerging from the sea and rushing to the entrance of the Sacred Region academy.

The flaming bird seemed to be able to understand the words of Dean Baili. At this time, with its mouth wide open, a huge flame burst out of its mouth!

Boom——

The evolved beasts below were directly burned by the terrifying flames and turned black like charcoal.

And at this time, Dean Baili jumped off directly, holding two knives in both hands and frantically beheading the evolved beasts that were constantly rushing up around him.

As the long knife in his hand slashed and cut, a horrifying cross blade burst out and it rushed directly to the front side!

Wherever he went, hundreds of evolved beasts were sliced into several pieces.

“He’s Dean Baili indeed!” The men who saw the scene on the monitor heaved a sigh of relief.

Under the frenzied attack of Dean Baili, a large number of evolved beasts were beheaded.

In less than a minute, he has already killed thousands of evolved beasts.

And many instructors from the Sacred Region academy had also begun to wipe out the evolved beasts that came ashore.

“It’s a critical situation right now, all of you stay in the academy, don’t run around!” Nan Zhengjun said anxiously to the class 10 students of the South Campus at this time.

“By the way, where’s Lin Xiu and Luo Yue!?”

“Lin Xiu didn’t come today, Luo Yue seems to have just gone out in a hurry.” Jiang Li thought for a while, then said aloud. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Nan Zhengjun nodded, then seemed to think of something and the look in his eyes couldn’t help but change.

Oh no, these two shouldn’t be…

“I haven’t moved for a long time, seems like I’m getting a little stiff.” Seeing a large number of evolved beasts dying under his long knife, Dean Baili couldn’t help but sigh with emotion.

But at this moment, he found a white figure going past him, and a cold light flashed. Then, beside the several bodies in front, the strange-looking evolved beasts were all killed!

“Luo Yue?!” Dean Baili took a closer look and saw a young girl appearing, killing the evolved beasts on this side.

Of course Dean Baili knew who Luo Yue was – she was from that family after all.

“Was it you who arranged his mission?” Luo Yue stood in front of Dean Baili after killing several evolved beasts at this time, then said coldly to him.

“Who are you talking about?” Dean Baili asked, already knowing the answer.

“Lin Xiu.” Luo Yue snorted coldly, then said aloud.

“Yes, I arranged for him to carry out a task and he should still be under the sea.” Dean Baili said without hiding anything.

Hearing Dean Baili’s words, the look in Luo Yue’s eyes changed, instantly full of killing intent.

It was unknown why the evolved beasts in the entire ocean rioted like this.

It had formed a wave of terrifying beasts.

Just as Luo Yue was talking to Dean Baili, another wave of evolved beasts rushed up.

But the rank 9 Mysterious Flaming bird spat out a terrifying flame, instantly burning all the evolved beasts that came up.

Luo Yue rushed directly to the other side of the sea at this time, as if she wanted to go directly to the bottom of the sea. |

“If you go down, how many seconds do you think you can hold on?” Dean Baili suddenly said aloud while watching Luo Yue’s movements.

Hearing Dean Baili’s words, Luo Yue was stunned. If she went down now, she couldn’t hold on for long at the bottom of the sea – just breathing was a problem.

“If you want to go down and save him, go and wear a diving suit.” Dean Baili said helplessly at this time.

Luo Yue went back the same way and when she walked past Dean Baili, she looked at Dean Baili and said, “If something happened to him, I will kill you.”

After speaking, she walked directly to the gate for the diving suit.

Upon hearing Luo Yue’s words, Dean Baili was surprised. Thinking of the terrifying killing intent in Luo Yue’s eyes just now, Dean Baili couldn’t help but smile.

“Interesting, really interesting.”

Soon, Luo Yue changed into a diving suit, then ignored Dean Baili as she rushed to the beach and dived in.

Dived to the bottom of the sea!

“This is the so-called idiom: a friend in need is a friend indeed?” Dean Baili mumbled to himself. He shook his head, then said to the rank 9 flaming bird in the sky, “Old friend, let’s have some fun today!”

He knew that Lin Xiu should be fine and there were not only dangers in the seabed, but also treasures. He deliberately gave Lin Xiu a chance to see if he could find those treasures.

“Damn! Are these evolved beasts crazy!?”

At the same time, Lin Xiu was at the bottom of the sea still firmly holding onto the seamount, preventing his body from flying away.

He looked at the evolved beast at the bottom of the sea and was very surprised.

Because this evolved beast seemed mad and slammed into the energy shield, disregarding the fact that its body was covered in blood.

There were also a large number of evolved beasts attacking the rank 8 furious black whale.

But this rank 8 furious black whale was really terrifying and there were many spikes on the surface of its body. As soon as these evolved beasts hit its body, they were either swallowed by the whale or pierced through by those spikes!

For a moment, there was a lot of red blood mixed in the sea and the smell of blood was thick.
