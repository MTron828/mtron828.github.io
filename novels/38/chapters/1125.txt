Chapter 1126: Weird Passage

When those Sage warriors saw this scene, the expressions in their eyes changed slightly.

But at this time, they still didn’t dodge and continued to gather all their strengths together.

Forming this extremely defensive ‘Sphere’.

boom boom boom —

!!

The flaming phoenix hit the ‘Sphere’ they unfolded, making a loud noise.

And at this time, the flaming phoenix turned into a terrifying flame tornado.

“what!!!”

These Sage warriors clearly felt the extremely strong impact, as well as the scorching temperature and they all roared loudly at this time.

The veins all over the body were about burst.

So solid?

At this time, Lin Xiu watched as they jointly unfolded the “Sphere” and were able to resist the impact of his flaming phoenix. He had a look of surprise in his eyes.

“I want to see how long you guys can hold back.”

At this time, Lin Xiu snorted coldly and charged with the Dark Edge spear in his hand!

As Lin Xiu’s body’s source strength was transmitted to the Dark Edge spear, the entire Dark Edge spear turned into amethyst glass.

Moreover, the fiery red source mark on the body of the Dark Edge spear all lit up at this time.

With the support of the source mark power, Lin Xiu held the spear in both hands and directly attacked!

boom boom boom —

With a loud sound, the ‘Sphere’ they unfolded was constantly shaking.

Lin Xiu frantically attacked with a spear, causing their faces to change drastically.

The incomparably terrifying impact made their footsteps recede continuously.

‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers’, ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’, ‘Clean Sweep’…

At this time, Lin Xiu continued to use various skill powers to attack their ‘Sphere’.

bang bang bang-

Now Lin Xiu’s body was full of energy and using so many skills was no burden on Lin Xiu at all.

At this time, under the continuous attacks of Lin Xiu, the ‘Sphere’ they unfolded began to become unstable.

Soon, slowly, cracks began to appear! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

‘Heaven Breaking Strike’!

Lin Xiu seized this opportunity, held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and slashed across it!

At the moment of using this skill, Lin Xiu’s source strength seemed to have been drained by half in an instant.

Snapped–

With a crisp sound, the ‘Sphere’ they unfolded instantly burst!

pfft—

Because the ‘Sphere’ was launched jointly, at this time, as the ‘Sphere’ exploded, these warriors were affected at the same time.

They all vomited blood.

At this moment, they retreated to the back.

Lin Xiu didn’t stop his movements, holding the spear in his hand and stabbing directly at one of the Sage warriors.

Because just now, they all used their power in order to unfold the ‘Sphere’ to resist Lin Xiu’s offensive and they consumed a lot of their body’s source strength.

So this Sage warrior was caught off guard and could not dodge Lin Xiu’s attack at all!

boom–

The Dark Edge spear pierced through his head in an instant!

Those Sage warriors who had already retreated to the other side had fear in their eyes.

Currently, two Sage warriors have died in Lin Xiu’s hands!

And from the beginning of the battle to the present, it was only a short period of time.

Lin Xiu didn’t give them the slightest chance. At this time, he used his body skill and his figure continued to flicker in the matrix.

He appeared in front of them in an instant and continued to attack with the spear in his hand.

This is a one-sided fight.

Lin Xiu, single-handedly beat these eight sage warriors to pieces.

Soon, eight of the Sage warriors died under Lin Xiu’s spear.

Raising his eyes and looking forward, the last Sage warrior was still frantically using skill to attack the matrix.

He wanted to break through the matrix and escape.

“Don’t waste your energy, it’s useless.”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

Holding the blood-stained Dark Edge spear in his hand, he walked towards him step by step.

“Who are you!”

He watched Lin Xiu come over and his body trembled.

The body retreated subconsciously, but unless the matrix is ??broken, he will not be able to flee at all.

At this time, he held the long sword in his hand and wanted to directly break through the space.

However, he found that as his strength was mobilized, there was no way to break through this space.

It seems that the position he is in now has a special power that makes it impossible for him to do this!

“I’m here to find some holy water and take revenge.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

At this time, the Dark Edge spear held in both hands has been raised high.

The body of the long spear has a lot of source strength gathered!

“No!!!”

Looking at this scene, the Sage warrior shouted loudly.

But as Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear slashed over, the warrior was directly killed by Lin Xiu.

“It’s over.”

Looking at the bodies of the eight Sage warriors around, Lin Xiu exhaled.

However, his experience increased very little, only by 4%.

There is still a long way to go before upgrading.

As Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered, at this moment, the surrounding matrix had completely disappeared.

Lin Xiu looked at the gate of the forbidden area and without any hesitation, he stepped inside.

Without the obstruction of these eight Sage warriors, Lin Xiu could relax in the forbidden area.

At this time, as Lin Xiu walked in, he found that the area inside looked a little gloomy.

Soon, Lin Xiu saw a cave in front of him.

Looking inside from the entrance of the cave, all he could see was darkness.

What is this place?

Lin Xiu was slightly startled at this moment, hesitated for a while, but continued to walk inside.

According to the information, holy water was in this forbidden area.

As for the specific location in the forbidden area, he didn’t know.

This kind of information could not be found even in the Divine Domain.

However, Lin Xiu has already checked the surrounding area and there is nothing at all, so it should be in this cave.

After walking into this dark cave, Lin Xiu suddenly felt a strange feeling.

It’s that kind of weird feeling that Lin Xiu can’t explain.

However, Lin Xiu was not afraid and was confident in his own strength so he continued to move forward.

He didn’t know how long he had walked for when everything around him seemed to be extremely dark.

But because of the effect of ‘Power of the Stars’, the light generated still allowed Lin Xiu to see the surroundings clearly.

“Where is this…”

When Lin Xiu said to himself, the pupils in his eyes shrank.

At this time, he seemed to be stuck in the same place.
