1196 Kill!

Bang bang bang-

Those daggers that flew out were directly inserted into the surrounding ground.

The surrounding warriors looked at this scene and their eyes changed.

That holy-level skill seems to be blocked!?

As for Bo Nan on the battlefield, the expression in his eyes changed slightly as he watched the thousands of spinning daggers that were knocked back to his side.

The dagger in his hand swung wildly at this moment.

Dangdang-

Those daggers that attacked him in turn were all blocked.

Damn, what’s going on!?

The expression in his eyes changed slightly at this time.

“That’s all?”

At this time, Lin Xiu’s voice also came from the battle platform.

Bonan looked up and saw that Lin Xiu on the battlefield was not only unscathed, but also held a long spear in his hand.

When did he take the weapon!?

Seeing this scene, the pupils in Bo Nan’s eyes shrank slightly.

Because just before, Lin Xiu didn’t have any weapons in his hands!

“Next, it’s my turn.”

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched and without giving him time to think, he rushed towards him!

swoosh—

The figure of Lin Xiu who rushed out instantly disappeared in place.

What a fast speed!

When some of the surrounding city lords saw this scene, their eyes changed slightly.

Some of the city lords who thought Lin Xiu would be defeated changed their views at this time.

Dang–

Just as Bo Nan was about to move with the dagger in his hand, Lin Xiu’s spear stabbed!

At this time, the long spear was full of power and the tip of the spear stabbed his dagger and a loud sound suddenly erupted.

Bo Nan also felt a sharp pain in the right hand holding the dagger and he dropped the dagger!

And Lin Xiu still didn’t stop, the spear in his hand continued to stab!

Damn!

Bo Nan’s face became extremely ugly, but in this case, he still reacted quickly and unfolded his “Sphere”.

The golden ‘Sphere’ instantly blocked all Lin Xiu’s attacks.

bang bang bang-

The spear danced and kept attacking his ‘Sphere’.

At this time, Bonan can only passively defend and there is no chance to counterattack at all.

“Bo Nan!!! Kill him for me!!!”

The city lord of Taifeng City turned extremely ugly at this time.

He was full of confidence just now, but he never thought that Bo Nan would be pushed to such an extent now.

“I know!”

Bo Nan, who clearly heard the words of the Taifeng City Lord, roared at this moment.

He also wanted to get rid of Lin Xiu, but Lin Xiu’s offensive was too fierce.

Now there is no chance to fight back.

He could only constantly strengthen his Sphere to resist Lin Xiu’s attacks.

“Go away!!!”

Bo Nan watched his body keep retreating and when he saw that he was about to fall off the stage, he let out a low growl.

This time, the strength of the whole body surged wildly.

Fight to the death!

clack clack——

As Bo Nan’s power exploded, his bones seemed to make a sound like frying beans.

Lin Xiu held the spear in his hand and was about to continue stabbing at his ‘Sphere’ where the cracks were clearly visible.

But at this moment, the powerful source strength that erupted from Bo Nan’s body directly sent Lin Xiu flying out!

boom–

As Lin Xiu’s body hit the ground heavily, he vomited out a mouthful of blood.

“Go to hell!!!”

And Bonan continued to charge toward Lin Xiu.

Aggressive.

Has his strength increased?

Lin Xiu looked at him with his Analytic Eye and found that his strength had obviously improved a lot.

“but…”

“It’s still useless.”

Lin Xiu stood up with a sneer on the corner of his mouth.

The Dark Edge spear in his hand slashed directly at Bo Nan who was charging over!

Holy-level skill – ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’! ! !

With the spear slashing into the air, a crescent-shaped terrifying force directly charged toward Bo Nan who was rushing over.

“what!!!”

Looking at the terrifying force that was coming, Bo Nan roared and was about to forcibly resist.

boom–

But at the next moment, his ‘Sphere’ was directly shattered by this incomparably terrifying force. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

And his body instantly turned into two pieces.

Blood splashed all over the ground.

Baili Haoling was a little worried about Lin Xiu at first, but when he saw this scene, he could not help but heaved a sigh of relief.

At this time, the city lord of Taifeng City was pale and his body was almost unsteady.

He, the most outstanding warrior of the younger generation in Taifeng City, was killed just like that!?

Fu Tianling’s face also became gloomy.

The skill that Lin Xiu used just now, even he could sense that it was very strong.

What’s going on, this kid, how could such a powerful force suddenly burst out?

“interesting.”

Fu Tianyuan’s mouth also showed an interesting smile.

Just now, he also felt that Lin Xiu’s strength was not that great.

But now, the power that Lin Xiu has burst out is indeed beyond his expectations.

“Were you hiding your strength?”

Fu Tianyuan said to himself.

“I won?”

Lin Xiu looked at Fu Tianling at this moment and said lightly.

“The game continues.”

Fu Tianling continued to speak with a gloomy face.

Here, there are still many young warriors from various cities who have not yet played.

Some warriors who originally wanted to fight heard Fu Tianling saying that the competition would continue, but they did not dare to take the stage easily.

Bo Nan was killed just now and they didn’t dare to go up without absolute certainty.

After all, compared to obtaining a God warrior-level skill Card, life is more important.

“I’ll do it!”

But soon, a warrior jumped directly onto the platform.

At this time, a warrior holding a heavy sword looked at Lin Xiu, his face full of waywardness.

“It’s just killing that trashy Bo Nan. How dare the city lord of a mere trash city dare to be presumptuous?”

He stared at Lin Xiu and said savagely.

Under the inspection of the Analytic eye, although this person’s strength is much stronger than that of Bo Nan, he was still not strong enough for Lin Xiu.

“Sun Qi from Tianyi City.”

Ling Yu, who was sitting in the seat over there, saw this scene in his eyes and his brows suddenly wrinkled.

This person is one of the most promising people in this competition.

“Although I don’t want to admit it, this guy is stronger than me.”

Sun Ruo spoke at this time.

“He will win.”

Baili Haoling, who was sitting on the other side, said lightly.

She has this intuition.

From the beginning, Lin Xiu has been giving people all kinds of surprises.

This time, it was no exception.
