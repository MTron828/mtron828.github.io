Chapter 1118: Grudges From the Past and Now

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

All of the tables and chairs around them started shaking as well.

Soon, they were dancing in the air.

Plus, they were all surrounded by source energy which made these tables and chairs much tougher than before. The durability of it was similar to metals.

Suddenly, all of these metals headed straight at Lin Xiu!

Boom boom boom – –

!!

However, Lin Xiu did not move at all. When the table and chairs landed on his ‘sphere’, all of them broke into pieces.

Lin Xiu slowly got up as well.

When he turned around, he could clearly see that there was only one sage warrior that came from the Divine Domain.

“You’re the only one?”

Lin Xiu asked calmly.

“Only one is enough to kill you.”

The sage warrior answered coldly.

Although he was quite shocked that Lin Xiu was able to stop his attacks earlier…

He still thought that with his full abilities, he should be able to kill Lin Xiu easily.

Xiu – –

Then, there was a sound in the air and a long spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hands.

When the sage warrior noticed how there was a spear that suddenly appeared in his hands, Lin Xiu was a little shocked.

He didn’t see Lin Xiu bringing any weapons earlier. How was it that this weapon suddenly appeared in his hand?

However, he didn’t have time to think about it. His eyes were now filled with a murderous intention.

He held onto his sword and went directly towards Lin Xiu!

A terrifying sword aura was headed at Lin Xiu!

There were even sounds of the air being sliced by the sword aura around them.

Suddenly, Lin Xiu’s body disappeared from the ground.

Where did he go?!

When the man saw what happened, his pupil shrunk.

Before he could react, Lin Xiu’s body had completely disappeared!

Then, he noticed a bright light that flashed across his eyes.

Clang – –

He subconsciously blocked the attack with the sword in his hands.

With a loud crisp sound, he felt his hands turned numb and his body was forced to take a few steps backwards.

“You…”

He looked up and noticed that Lin Xiu, who had disappeared earlier, was now standing right in front of him!

With a blink of an eye, Lin Xiu held onto his long spear and went straight for the man.

Clang clang clang – –

The man did not have time to react and could only try his best to block the long spear with his sword.

However, Lin Xiu was too quick with his sword and his strength was incredibly strong as well.

Then, the sword flew out of his hand!

This was impossible!

He screamed internally.

His entire palm had turned red and it felt numb.

‘Sphere’!

Seeing how there was a bright cold light coming at him, Lin Xiu immediately released his ‘sphere’.

The tip of the black spear instantly landed on his ‘sphere’.

Boom boom boom – –

At the very next moment, the man was thrown out of the bar.

Lin Xiu then grabbed his long spear and went outside as well.

Sizzling – –

Just as Lin Xiu was about to walk out of the place, there was a horrifying current that appeared all over Lin Xiu’s body.

This was obvious that the man that Lin Xiuhad attacked earlier had used the energy of his sourcemark.

“This is impossible! Impossible!”

When the sage warrior standing outside saw Lin Xiu coming out of the bar unharmed, he was beyond shocked.

After being attacked, he had quickly activated his electric source mark but he didn’t think that there would be no effects on Lin Xiu.

Plus, Lin Xiu was already wearing a huge armour and this would have slowed down his reflexes.

But, he didn’t think that Lin Xiu could still be so quick.

“This amount of current is nothing to me.”

Lin Xiu answered as he waved his left hand. Then, another scarier current went straight for the sage warrior!

Although he had his ‘sphere’ around him, the warrior still noticed that when the terrifying lightning bolts came towards his ‘sphere’, he was unable to block the impact of it.

The lightning bolts went through his ‘sphere’ and landed directly on his body.

“AHHHHHH!!!!!”

A loud cry came out of his mouth.

Although his body had certain resistance towards electricity, the ones that Lin Xiu released had a much higher voltage.

The current was so strong that there was intense pain coming from all his organs.

Then, Lin Xiu raised the long spear over his head and continued his attack on the man’s ‘sphere’.

Bakk – –

With a crisp sound, there were cracks that appeared all over his ‘sphere’.

Then, the entire sphere broke.

Pfft – –

As the ‘sphere’ broke, he got a backlash from it and forced a mouthful of blood out of his mouth.

“Noooo!!!!!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was still coming closer to him with the long spear, he screamed out loud.

Boom – –

When he was done screaming, the long spear went straight through his brains!

Blood splattered everywhere.

His eyes were opened wide as he was filled with disbelief.

He was a sage warrior but he ended up being killed.

“Only 0.5% of EXP…?”

Lin Xiu looked at the progress bar on his system as he mumbled to himself.

This EXP was indeed too little.

He would have to kill at least 200 sage warriors in order to move to the next level.

But, the Divine Domain would not have so many sage warriors for him to kill.

Ring ring ring…

Then, there was a warning siren that rang throughout the city.

As he looked up, he could clearly see that there was a large number of flying devices that appeared in the air. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

On both sides of the alley, there were also a large number of warriors that surrounded him.

“How dare you cause so much trouble in the Divine Domain! You have messed with the wrong person!”

The elders of the Divine Domain, Huangfu Zhong and Huangfu Lin, appeared on both sides of the streets.

They looked at Lin Xiu’s spear that was covered in blood and the body of the sage warrior on the ground whom Lin Xiu had just killed. They had an awful expression on his face.

He managed to kill a sage warrior of the Divine Domain?

“Divine Domain huh? Let’s clear all of our grudges from the past as well.”

Lin Xiu looked at the warriors around him and warned them in a low voice.

When Huangfu Zhong and Huangfu Lin heard what he was saying, they frowned.

They did not understand what Lin Xiu was referring to.

“Kill him!”

They did not think too much about it and immediately gave the order.

With their commands, all of the warriors who were on their flying devices, held their laser cannons and started attacking Lin Xiu!
