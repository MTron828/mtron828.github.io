Chapter 10: Counter-attack!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

As he continued to walk forward, Lin Xiu became more and more surprised.

There was the wreckage of buildings all around, but many were covered up by the plants.

A few years ago, this place was still a thriving and prosperous city, but it had become a forest now.

He couldn’t help but feel a little emotional.

“Bang, dang.” Lin Xiu stepped on a pull-top can, and it looked like it was Coca-Cola.

“Eh?” Lin Xiu was curious. The design on this pull-top can looked exactly like the one in his era.

Lin Xiu took a closer look and there was even a manufacturing date on it – it was actually produced in ‘2016’!

Seeing this product that was from the same era as him, Lin Xiu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Strange, why didn’t he see any of his classmates yet? Also, where did that fatty Yang Tian go?

There was a sign in front that said ‘Danger zone’, but suddenly, there was a slight tremor on the ground and the sign fell to the ground. Lin Xiu didn’t notice it.

Following this tremor, some gigantic birds on the huge trees also dispersed.

“Roar!”

A deafening roar reverberated throughout the entire forest.

Lin Xiu covered his ears; that beast’s roar nearly made his legs go numb.

‘What is that…?’

Lin Xiu looked deeper into the forest and saw a huge figure rushing over!

Not good!

*Crackle* *Rattle* Bolts of lightning kept shooting out, and those thick trunks around him immediately charred before they broke and split.

Lin Xiu swallowed his saliva and quickly leaped on top of a tree, holding his breath.

At this moment, he carefully looked ahead and saw a huge evolved beast in the middle.

Its body was the size of a cow, but it resembled a leopard.

It opened its mouth and revealed a set of sharp and long fangs. What was even more shocking was that there were several lightning bolts revolving around its body, and with a wave of its claw, the surrounding trees were all burnt by the lightning.

“Rank 4 evolved beast, Lightning Leopard!?”

Lin Xiu gasped.

Although the physical attribute of the former Lin Xiu was lousy, he was extremely knowledgeable.

He could remember the images of many evolved beasts.

That rank 3 color-changing python nearly killed Lin Xiu, so he definitely wouldn’t be able to defeat this rank 4 Lightning Leopard!

Flee! Quick, flee!

But just then, he saw a woman over there. She was dressed in a battle robe and held a long sword that emitted a cold white light. Her exquisite face was as calm as water and she didn’t have any expression on her face at all.

She struck with her sword and a white beam that was like a half-moon appeared, chopping off the trees at the side instantly.

“Roar!” The Lightning Leopard flew into a violent rage. As it roared, a large amount of lightning exploded from its body.

There were crackling sounds like the sound of lightning and air colliding with one another.

Although Lin Xiu was still quite a distance from that side, he could still feel his body trembling.

Strong, too strong!

Analytic Eye!

Lin Xiu looked at the woman fighting against that Lightning Leopard and became curious.

“Unanalyzable.”

Lin Xiu was stunned. Why was she unanalyzable? Even when he couldn’t analyze that color-changing python’s combat strength, he was at least able to find out its rank!

Wait a minute, could it be that this Analytic Eye wouldn’t analyze anyone stronger than himself?

Lin Xiu tried using the Analytic Eye on the Lightning Leopard and it showed that it was unanalyzable too.

The battle in front continued. With the Lightning Leopard and woman in the middle, the surrounding trees were all destroyed.

Probably because they could sense the terrifying air over there, many low-ranking evolved beasts were trying to escape at this moment.

“Pa.” The woman’s long sword, which was as white as snow, pierced toward that direction again. However, the purplish-blue lightning that revolved around the Lightning Leopard’s body was like a natural shield and formed a defense for it.

“Roar!” It let out a loud roar once again and smacked down with its claw. But the woman managed to dodge it with a mystical pose.

“Swish.” Her sword struck again. Deep cracks appeared on the ground because of the impact, and it looked exceptionally terrifying.

This was the power of a high-ranking warrior! Witnessing this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but get stirred up.

As long as he continued to work hard, he would be able to do it someday and even become stronger!

The battle went on as Lin Xiu kept staring at the scene over there. The duel between an expert and a high-ranking evolved beast was definitely beneficial for him.

Not long after, the lightning around the Lightning Leopard’s body appeared to have weakened. That woman took this chance and struck with her long sword again. The Lightning Leopard was sent flying in the air and the lightning around its body dissipated at once.

Done!?

The woman knitted her brows and held tightly onto the long sword in her hand. She then slowly walked toward the Lightning Leopard.

That Lightning Leopard had suffered fatal blows from the sword and a lot of fresh blood was flowing out of its body.

It looked like it was about to die or lose consciousness.

The woman’s knitted brows had relaxed at this moment, and she was about to pierce her long sword toward its head, giving it another fatal blow!

But just then, the Lightning Leopard that was lying on the ground motionlessly flipped its body and stood up all of a sudden.

Several gigantic lightning bolts were released and they turned into a huge lightning ball as they charged at the woman.

How crafty, it actually pretended to be dead!

Lin Xiu received a huge shock at this moment. ‘This thing already had some IQ, huh?’

“Zizizi.” Even Lin Xiu could hear the lightning sounds very clearly. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

That woman clearly didn’t expect that this Lightning Leopard’s counter-attack would be so horrifying. She used her long sword and blocked her front, then released the energy in her body and immediately formed a protective shield.

But that lightning ball was too scary, it even caused a stir in the air around them.

“Thump.” There was a loud thud and that woman’s body was sent flying.

As the trees were destroyed, Lin Xiu could see everything clearly. Over at that side was a steep cliff and that woman was sent flying down directly!

Ddd… dead?
