Chapter 242: Last Skill – Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City!

Yu Yi clenched his teeth and used more force in the sword.

He had utilized something far more terrifying than forbidden medicine and he was filled with fighting intent that desired to rip Lin Xiu into pieces.

But he did not expect Lin Xiu’s fighting capabilities to be extraordinarily powerful.

He was a rank 6 warrior and had used an external product to increase his strength to the equivalent of a peak rank 6.

But even so, he was only able to maintain a stalemate against Lin Xiu.

He was unable to accept this outcome.

Clank-

But in the next moment, Lin Xiu’s spear blocked his attack!

“Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall!” After blocking the attack, he swung the spear with both hands to push Yu Yi away before executing another skill!

The spear immediately released lights that looked like stars.

This skill was used with rage build-up at its maximum, resulting in an amplified execution.

Clank-

Yu Yi stabbed forward with his sword and collided with Dark Edge perfectly.

But the power from the collision forced him back a few steps.

‘Damn it!’

He exerted force at his feet to stop himself from flying out of the arena and stabilized himself.

Yu Yi’s eyes were red, he so badly wanted to rip Lin Xiu’s body up into a thousand pieces.

“I want you dead!!!” Yu Yi roared as he erupted with source strength again.

Following this, berserk gales started to surge around them.

“What powerful source strength…” A few students exclaimed out loud.

No one dared to go close to the arena anymore.

After all, it was too dangerous for the spectators to stand near them. If Lin Xiu or Yu Yi used an area-of-effect skill and they were affected, they might even be in danger!

“Take my move!” Yu Yi glared at Lin Xiu and growled ferociously.

He never wanted to use this skill because there was the chance that the entire arena might be destroyed!

But he no longer had any thoughts but to kill Lin Xiu!

To remove the hatred in his heart!

He held his sword with both hands and raised it towards the sky.

The sword was enveloped by a large amount of source strength and emitted a dazzling light.

“What skill is that?” Zhang Yin used source strength to cover his own eyes and he could see a large amount of source strength surging into Yu Yi’s sword.

All the source strength on his body resembled the surface of a sword.

One could only imagine the power if he unleashed the concentrated source strength,

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide at the sight of Yu Yi’s skill as his pupils constricted.

He could sense that Yu Yi’s skill was extremely powerful!

Without thinking further, Lin Xiu rushed towards him!

He had to stop Yu Yi!

“Diamond skill – Dragon Beheadment Art!!!”

But before Lin Xiu could reach him, Yu Yi’s expression became sinister. He let out a loud roar as his hands turned into a gigantic and terrifying sword image as he slashed it down towards Lin Xiu!

‘Not good!’

Ouyang Hang opened his eyes wide when he saw the skill.

His body instinctively thought to dodge the move.

The reason for his move was that Yi Yu’s power was extremely large and might even destroy the space outside of the arena!

Yi Yu wanted to kill Lin Xiu with this skill!

Lin Xiu saw the sword image slashing down at him but did not reveal any panic.

He did not stop moving and continued to charge forward!

‘You want to die!’

Yu Yi’s face became even more sinister when he saw Lin Xiu’s response.

He was using a diamond skill!

Under his normal state, it was impossible for him to grasp the diamond skill so quickly just after becoming a rank 6 warrior.

But under the effects of the worm, the power in his body had swelled up.

This was how he was able to unleash the skill to its biggest potential!

“Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City!!!”

Lin Xiu snorted and swung Dark Edge as he welcomed the sword!

“Seeking death!” Seeing that Lin Xiu did not attempt to avoid the attack but executed an attack of his own, Yu Yi immediately roared out loud.

His skill was the diamond skill Dragon Beheadment Art, while Lin Xiu’s skill was obviously one of a dragon.

Wasn’t that setting his own death!?

Lin Xiu was bound to die!

Roar-

As Dark Edge stabbed forth, a large energy body formed into a black dragon and rushed forward!

‘What is that!?’

Everyone was stunned.

“Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City!? Where did I….hear that skill from…” A few students seemed to recall the skill.

“Right, I remember it now, isn’t that the skill that people would try to learn every year, but no one ever accomplished it!”

“He grasped the skill!?”

A few students exclaimed out loud and stared at Lin Xiu. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The black dragon was formed from energy and looked extremely terrifying. Yu Yi was able to sense the terrifying might of the dragon and fear appeared in his eyes.

‘Impossible! I’m using a diamond skill! It is the Dragon Beheadment Art and that black dragon formed of energy will be beheaded by my skill!’

“Die… for me!!!” Yu Yi roared as his gigantic sword slashed down!

Rumble-

The black dragon that came out of Dark Edge collided right onto the gigantic sword image conjured by Yu Yi and exploded with a loud bang!

The ground trembled incessantly.

It was like an earthquake with a magnitude of 10. Everyone could not stand and many fell to the ground.

Countless debris fell off the arena.

Many of the spectators that were caught unprepared were struck and suffered light injuries.
