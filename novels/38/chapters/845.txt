Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Luo Yan seems to still remember what happened that day.

“I must go.”

Lin Xiu said with a smile.

“you...”

“Don’t worry, I will be back, asked Luo Yue to wait for me.”

After Lin Xiu covered the quilt for Luo Yue, he stood up and said to Luo Yan.

“This guy.”

Luo Yan looked at Lin Xiu and knew that what he had decided would not be changed easily, so she stomped her feet a little annoyed.

“Remember or come back, otherwise I won’t let my sister wait for you.”

Luo Yan glared at Lin Xiu and said.

“I will.”

After Lin Xiu took a deep look at Luo Yue, he took his spear and set off for Fengyun City again!

Lin Xiu wasn;t sure why he killed so many warriors outside Fengyun City, and also fought with Huang Ying, the incarnation of Respected warrior, but he was not wanted on Marqi Planet.

It was as if this matter had been erased.

So Lin Xiu easily took the super express train and headed to Fengyun City.

This time, Lin Xiu didn’t book a private booth, but sat on the hard seat outside.

“You’re also going to Fengyun City?”

An uncle sitting beside Lin Xiu said to Lin Xiu curiously at this time.

“En.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Tomorrow is His Majesty’s birthday, and the entire Fengyun City is very lively.”

“Is it.”

Lin Xiu said with a strange smile on the corner of his mouth.

His birthday, if nothing happens, will be his death anniversary.

“yes...”

This uncle is a chatterbox. At this time, he was talking to Lin Xiu nonstop.

But Lin Xiu quickly closed his eyes and regained his senses, which made the uncle feel bored for a while, and closed his mouth wisely.

After some time, Lin Xiu, who closed his eyes, heard some discussions.

“It is said that His Majesty is interested in a planet called ‘Earth’, and is ready to send someone to take a look there.”

“I’ve heard of it, but hasn’t the Star route over there been closed?”

“Tsk, the An family just need to open the route again. Anyway, the route to the planet of the earth was created by them.”

“...”

“They want to deal with the Earth?”

Lin Xiu opened his eyes at this time, and said aloud to the two men who were sitting on the other side of the discussion.

The two men were discussing, but when they heard Lin Xiu’s words, they were stunned.

“What do you mean by ‘they’, how can you talk this way?”

When the man heard Lin Xiu’s words, he frowned and said coldly.

“If you dare to call your majesty the emperor like that, be careful you’ll be beheaded.”

Another man said disdainfully.

Because Lin Xiu’s black pupils, in their eyes, are the sign of the inferior.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

This Huang Ying had ideas about the earth, which made Lin Xiu determined to kill him.

After closing his eyes, Lin Xiu continued to rest.

“Hmph, bastard.”

The two Marqi aborigines gave Lin Xiu a disdainful look at this moment.

After the train stopped, it was already the evening of the next day.

Because there was no warrior competition, Fengyun City was also open at this time.

There was no need for a passport as before.

Soon, Lin Xiu walked in.

“It’s a pity. I didn’t expect that Luo Yue would actually have the best Warrior God physique in our Luo family.”

In a courtyard, an old man from the Luo family sighed and said.

“Hmph, it’s a pity that, like Luo Zhen, he became a cripple.”

Luo Jing, the current head of the Luo family, snorted coldly.

What happened that day was a shame to their Luo family.

“Now His Majesty has agreed to attack the An family. As long as the Sun family suppressed the An family, the route to the earth will be opened again. When we arrive, we can go and see the indigenous world where Luo Zhen escaped to.”

Luo Jing said with a gloomy face.

“Luojing, what do you want to do?”

The old man touched his beard, and there was a glint in his eyes.

“In order to regain the favor of the royal family, our Luo family will first control the earth, and then provide convenience when His Majesty and others go to the earth.”

Luo Jing said coldly.

“Well, this one is fine. Those who resist can be killed first.”

This old man is Luo Jing’s father, Luo Tian, ??he said coldly at this time.

The two of them seemed to be deciding some unimportant matters.

“Tsk tsk.”

But at this moment, a voice came.

“Who is it!?”

The expressions of the two of them suddenly changed slightly.

Because with their strength, they could sense it when they enter the courtyard.

But they only heard the sound when it came from a very close distance.

When they turned to look back, they clearly saw Lin Xiu’s figure.

Lin Xiu was wearing a white battle suit with a long spear on his back.

“Lin Xiu!?”

Luo Jing saw Lin Xiu’s figure at this time, and the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

That day, he checked Lin Xiu’s video of the warrior competition, and he had already seen relevant information about Lin Xiu.

“He’s that kid!?”

Luo Tian frowned at this moment.

“I didn’t expect that you would dare to come here, humble earthling.”

Luo Jing said with a grim expression.

A strong killing intent burst out from his eyes.

“Is this the kid?”

Luo Tian looked at Lin Xiu, then said lightly.

“That’s right.”

Luo Jing nodded.

“Capture him alive and hand it over to Your Majesty.”

Luo Tian looked at Lin Xiu coldly, and said lightly.

“certainly.”

Luo Jing nodded slightly, and at the next moment, his figure moved and teleported directly to Lin Xiu.

He stretched out his hand and was about to grab Lin Xiu’s body!

swoosh—

But just when his hand was about to catch Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared instantly.

Where did he go!?

The pupils in Luo Jing’s eyes shrank suddenly.

“Where are you looking?”

Lin Xiu’s figure suddenly passed from behind him.

“Damn!!!”

He roared, and as soon as he turned around, he was kicked in the chest by Lin Xiu and fell on the ground.

Boom—

There was a loud noise.

The ground suddenly became sunken.

pfft—

Luo Jing spat out a mouthful of blood at this time.

He felt that his body was being stepped on by Lin Xiu’s feet, and he couldn’t get up at all.

He couldn’t gather the source strength from his body at this time.

how is this possible!

He is a peak warrior soul, and he has no way to break free.

“Courting death!”

When Luo Tian saw this scene, his expression changed greatly. With a wave of his right hand, the blue source strength materialized, instantly forming a huge blue arm and smashing it directly at Lin Xiu!
