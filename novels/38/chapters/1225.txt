“I’ll definitely do a good job.”

Lei Tong said seriously to Lin Xiu.

Lei Tong was very grateful that someone took him in in this strange world. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“It’s okay, I’ll leave that to you then.”

Lin Xiu waved.

Now Lin Xiu completely believed what he said was true.

With a god-level odd crystal as the core, it was possible to build such a powerful energy barrier.

Lin Xiu was certain that if there were more god-level odd crystals, Lei Tong would be able to construct a more powerful energy barrier!

But now he needed more God-level odd Crystals.

There were only two of the god-level odd crystals in the warehouse of the city lord’s mansion.

“Mr. Pang, take Lei Tong to the East Court to find a room for him to stay.”

Lin Xiu called Mr. Pang at this time.

“Yes.”

Mr. Pang nodded.

Some of the guards at the door heard Lin Xiu’s words, and looked at Lei Tong with envy.

The east courtyard in the city lord’s mansion is a place where the buildings and layouts were all organized.

Lin Xiu also lived there.

As Lin Xiu’s influence continued to increase in Lingxian City, people in Lingxian City now regarded Lin Xiu, the new city lord, as an idol.

“Thank you, City Lord.”

Lei Tong also said gratefully now.

Boom—

Just as he finished speaking, at this moment, he heard an incomparably loud sound.

The entire Lingxian City shook at this moment.

“Protect the city lord!”

The surrounding guards at the door thought someone was attacking, and at this time they all drew their weapons and entered a state of first-level alert.

“It should be from the city gate.”

Lin Xiu’s perception was released, and everything in the entire Lingxian City was immediately under Lin Xiu’s perception.

“Is someone here again?”

Baili Haoling frowned.

There was no end to this day at all.

And she seemed to think of something now, then looked at Lei Tong.

“Impossible, the Galaxy Smugglers wouldn’t have come again…”

Lei Tong seemed to understand what Baili Haoling wanted to say, so he shook his head and said.

“It’s hard to say.”

Baili Haoling pouted.

“I’ll take a look. You guys can guard the City Lord’s Mansion.”

Lin Xiu had already walked out of the door at this time, then looked at the guards who followed him and said.

“Yes!”

These guards obeyed Lin Xiu’s orders 100%.

swoosh—

Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered, and he used his body technique directly, and he seemed to disappear in place.

After using the ‘Flashing Souls’ movement technique several times in a row, Lin Xiu’s figure instantly appeared at the gate of Lingxian City.

At this time, it can be clearly seen that there were a large number of warriors who were releasing terrifying skills at the gate of Lingxian City.

Under the impact of those skills, the gate of Lingxian City had a lot of cracks appear.

You must know that the city gate of this Lingxian City is made of special materials, which can resist very powerful attacks.

But under the attack of so many powerful warriors, it was almost damaged.

“Sha Li, I said it long ago, just launch an attack directly from the air.”

A man wearing a black battle uniform, looking at this scene, frowned.

The hardness of the city gate was beyond his expectations.

“Sha Qiang, don’t you think it would be more interesting to slowly destroy this city like this?”

The man called Sha Li was a long-haired man, and at this moment, he had a crazy look.

“It’s just that this fool, Sha Lin, actually died in this broken city.”

The faces of the warriors standing inside the city gate became extremely ugly at this time.

All the warriors are holding their own weapons, as if facing a great enemy.

When Tianlan Pavilion controlled Lingxian City, most of the talented warriors and businessmen left Lingxian City.

Those warriors who still stayed in Lingxian City all have feelings for Lingxian City.

At this time, seeing that these warriors outside the door were going to destroy the ancient city gate of Lingxian City, they all firmly held the weapons in their hands.

The strength of those warriors outside was too strong, and wanting to fight with them was simply a dream.

but…

“Let’s all go back.”

Just when they were about to make a move, a voice suddenly came from the sky.

“City Lord!”

These warriors looked up to the sky, and they could clearly see Lin Xiu’s figure!

Seeing Lin Xiu’s figure, they were immediately extremely excited.

The current Lin Xiu has many legends in Lingxian City.

After getting rid of Tianlan Pavilion and Manhuang City, won the first place, killing top warriors from three cities…

“I’ll get rid of them.”

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, he flew out.

Taking a closer look, there were many powerful warriors outside the city, who were frantically attacking the walls of Lingxian City.

They didn’t directly destroy the city, nor did they fly directly over the city to launch air strikes.

The obvious reason to do this was to slowly destroy the entire Lingxian City.

The strength of other warriors in Lingxian City is indeed not strong, and it can be said that they are very weak, but this city wall building, but who knew what materials were used to build it.

Hard to believe.

“Someone is coming.”

At this moment, Sha Li clearly saw Lin Xiu flying in the sky.

As if he saw some prey appear, a strange smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

Sha Qiang, who was beside him, also clearly felt a strong aura coming from him. When he looked up, he saw Lin Xiu in the sky.

“go.”

Looking at the warriors who wanted to destroy the walls of Lingxian City, Lin Xiu triggered his thoughts and his hands danced. A dark blue flame dragon instantly appeared in Lin Xiu’s hands.

“go.”

Looking at the warriors below who were still constantly attacking the city wall, Lin Xiu waved his hands, and this dark blue flame dragon rushed down instantly!

Its speed was extremely fast, and at the same time, the body of the dark blue flame dragon also instantly became larger.

It became a huge flame dragon!

At this moment, the flame dragon directly impacted the body of a warrior below.

Boom—

The warrior didn’t react at all, and in the next moment, he was directly burned to slag.

And at this time, the flame dragon has not stopped moving, and continues to sweep towards other warriors!

“Be careful!!!”

At this time, the rest of the warriors also discovered this terrifying scene.

Immediately they unfolded their ‘Sphere’!

Boom—

But the flame of this flame dragon is really terrifying. As the flame dragon hit their ‘Sphere’, even their ‘Sphere’ almost melted away.

“Are you the city lord of Lingxian City?”

At this time, Sha Li glanced at Lin Xiu above.
