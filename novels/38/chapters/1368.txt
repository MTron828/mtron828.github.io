1369 Evolving

Lin Xiu then placed the egg in the courtyard.

He looked at it closely and noticed that there were runes all over it.

All of them seemed to be shining and glowing like a breathing lamp.

The whole thing just looked weird.

At the same time, the bright glow that came from the egg brought a surge of warmth all over his body.

It felt comforting.

“I don’t even know when you’ll wake up again.”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

Then, he turned to Little Bai, who was sitting on his shoulder. Lin Xiu then took out the god-level odd crystals from his expansion space.

He fed them to Little Bai.

Little Bai was like a little chicken, picking on the odd crystals that were in Lin Xiu’s hands and half of them were already gone within a few seconds.

“You’re that luxurious now?”

Baili Haoling was shocked to see what Lin Xiu was doing.

“I completed a mission a few days ago and received 200 god-level odd crystals in return.”

Lin Xiu continued feeding the odd crystals to Little Bai.

“2…200 of them?!”

Lei Chong was shocked to hear what Lin Xiu had just said.

They didn’t even get that many god-level odd crystals when they robbed Changqing City!

This was too much!

“What mission was it? I want to do it as well.”

Baili Haoling’s eyes were opened wide as she continued speaking.

“There isn’t any left. There’s only one mission.”

Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders.

The Netherworld Unicorn wasn’t something easy to hunt and the old man probably wouldn’t need it anymore.

“Plus, all twenty of them that went with me ended up dead. I am the only one that survived.”

Lei Chong couldn’t help but gasp after hearing what Lin Xiu said.

They were all warrior gods and all of them ended up dead?!

That would have reflected how dangerous the mission was.

“Little Bai? Have you had enough?”

Lin Xiu was still feeding Little Bai the god-level odd crystals.

However, after some time, Little Bai looked drunk as it swung from side to side.

Its entire body fell into Lin Xiu’s arms.

As Lin Xiu looked at him, Little Bai’s body was also glowing brightly in white.

Crack crack crack – –

Followed by a series of weird noises, there was an obvious glow that appeared all over Little Bai’s body.

Soon, there was a layer of frost that appeared on Little Bai and soon its body turned into an ice statue.

“Little Bai is evolving as well?!”

Lin Xiu was utterly shocked.

“Dumbass! You feed him so many odd crystals! It’s only normal for it to evolve!”

Baili Haoling spoke in a helpless tone.

To be frank, the Ice Crystal White Bird wasn’t considered a powerful evolved beast since it was something brought from earth.

As it was now in the Warrior God Realm that was saturated with such thick energy and how Lin Xiu had fed him so much god-level odd crystal, it was only normal for him to continue evolving.

“That’s good. It’s great that both are evolving together. Hopefully they’ll become beast gods.”

Lin Xiu chuckled happily.

“Oh! By the way, I’ll be leaving here soon.” Baili Haoling hesitated for a short while before informing Lin Xiu about it.

“Leave? Where to?”

Lin Xiu was surprised to hear that and asked subconsciously.

“Well, to other places so that I can cultivate.”

Baili Haoling shrugged her shoulders.

“I am your master and so it’s impossible for me to follow you forever. Otherwise, I may never improve!”

As she spoke about this, Baili Haoling glared at Lin Xiu.

It was true. All of the dangers that she had encountered recently have been solved by Lin Xiu.

However, if she doesn’t get herself into a life threatening situation, it would be very hard for her to break through.

Especially when she was now a warrior god.

...

“Alright.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Lei Chong, what about you?”

Lin Xiu then turned his attention over to Lei Chong.

“I think I would prefer staying in Lingxian City. I have a feeling that the Galaxy Smugglers will return.”

Lei Chong hesitated for a short while before saying what he had in mind.

The last time, those who were hunting for him came all the way to the Warrior God Realm. There might be a chance that these people would return.

Lin Xiu didn’t have much opinion about it and it was good news that Lei Chong wanted to stay.

Since Lei Chong was good with the technology and he knew how to build the energy barrier.

“You’re leaving now?”

Seeing how Baili Haoling was carrying a bag over her shoulder, Lin Xiu was stunned.

...

“Well, it is time to leave.”

Baili Haoling nodded her head.

“It’s time to party!”

Lei Chong suddenly spoke out of nowhere.

Seeing how Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling were looking at him as if he was an idiot, Lei Chong felt embarassed.

“Well, goodbye.”

Lin Xiu smiled as he bidded Baili Haoling farewell.

“Goodbye.”

Baili Haoling smiled as she left.

Lei Chong felt a little lonely as he saw Baili Haoling leaving.

They have been friends for quite a long time and he had no idea if he would be meeting her again in the future.

“I’ll be leaving soon as well.”

Lin Xiu looked into the sky and smiled.

“City Lord, you’re leaving too?”

Lei Chong widened his eyes in shock.

Lin Xiu had just got back and he’s leaving again?!

“En, I’ll be leaving in a few days.”

“I’m too weak. I need to work on myself.”

Lin Xiu simply gave an excuse.

Hearing what Lin Xiu had said, Lei Chong suddenly felt that he was nothing much garbage.

Lin Xiu was already so powerful but he was still looking for ways to work on himself and was even saying that he’s too weak…

“Lingxian City will be left in your hands soon.”

Lin Xiu patted Lei Chong’s shoulder and smiled.

He could see that Lei Chong really liked Lin Xiu city.

Plus, Lei Chong was a good candidate. Lin Xiu can’t stay in one place for long and he wouldn’t be satisfied with just managing one small city.

However, before Lei Chong could say anything, Lin Xiu had already returned to his room.

These few days, Lin Xiu has not been cultivating.

As he has been on a mission for the past few days, Lin Xiu decided to have a good rest.

He also had to prepare himself for the trip to Tianmen City.

Lin Xiu had a feeling that the Tianmen City was a much more dangerous place than the Netherworld.

“Huuuu~ That feels good.”

A few days later, Lin Xiu was walking around the courtyards early in the morning.

“Good morning, City Lord.”

Mr Pang was trimming the greenery.

Seeing that it was Lin Xiu, he quickly greeted him.

“Have your wounds recovered completely?”

Lin Xiu smiled.

“Yes! Yes! Thank you for saving my life!”

Mr Pang spoke excitedly.

Back then, he thought that he was dead! He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be able to save his life.

“Oh, right. Mr Pang, I’ll be leaving soon.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lin Xiu looked faw ahead before informing Mr Pang about his departure.
