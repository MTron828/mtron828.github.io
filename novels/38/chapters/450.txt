Chapter 451: Preparing For The Dive

After hearing what Luo Yue said, Lin Xiu was stunned.

This was because he could feel the difference in Luo Yue’s attitude towards him. If it was before this, she wouldn’t be explaining herself to him.

“Are you showing me that you care about my feelings?” Lin Xiu chuckled as he asked Luo Yue.

Xiu – –

As soon as Lin Xiu opened his mouth, he saw a bright light flash across his eyes.

But Lin Xiu’s reflex was quick as well and managed to dodge the attack.

“Hmph!” Luo Yue glared at Lin Xiu and sneered before she continued feeding odd crystals to Rollie and the little white crystal bird.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but pout his lips when he looked at Luo Yue.

She was…..feeling angry because she was embarrassed?

“Hey….why does it look like there’s fur growing on Rollie?” Lin Xiu looked at Rollie who was supposed to be half-transparent. There was already a thin layer of white fur growing on his body.

“Hmm?” Luo Yue was shocked as well after taking a closer look at it.

“It wasn’t there just now.”

“What sort of mutant creature are you? You’re so peculiar.” Lin Xiu asked Rollie who was still chewing on the odd crystal. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Usually, these mutant creatures were created because of the viral pandemic that happened in the last century. Most of the animals on earth had been mutated because of it.

Which animal was it mutated from?

“Where did you find it?” Luo Yue asked out of curiosity.

Luo Yue may be young but most of the elders wouldn’t even have the vast amount of knowledge that she had inside her brain.

Ever since she was a little girl, she had been busy studying. Not only about school but also with her martial art skills.

“It was inside the body of another mutant creature…” Lin Xiu didn’t think too much about it and immediately told Luo Yue.

When she heard what Lin Xiu said, she asked, “Inside the body of a giant vine beast…?”

Luo Yue frowned as she tried to think of what it could be but there was nothing she could come up with.

“I’m not sure.”

“It’s alright. I don’t care what it is but it is my pet now. Am I right, Rollier?” Lin Xiu laughed as he spoke to it.

“Kuuuuu…”

It was as if Rollie could understand what Lin Xiu was saying and replied with a peculiar cry.

“Oh right, let’s have dinner first. I packed some.”

“En.”

Time passed by quickly as Lin Xiu was busy getting comfortable with his skills and Luo Yue was having strength training.

With the points that he got from the match, Lin Xiu exchanged them for odd crystals and fed them to Rollie and the little white crystal bird.

“Chirp Chirp – –”

The little white crystal bird’s body has grown and the speed at which it was growing was much faster than expected.

“Rollie looks like a snowball…” One afternoon while Lin Xiu was done with his lunch, he looked at Rollie who was under his table. Rollie’s body was now entirely covered by a thick layer of white fur.

It was as white as snow which made Rollie look like a huge snowball.

As for the little white crystal bird, it was standing next to Rollie and was happily chirping at Lin Xiu.

“There are enough odd crystals for the both of you. Do not steal odd crystals from anyone else.” Lin Xiu said towards both the mutant creatures.

There was a basket of odd crystals placed right in front of them and these were exchanged with the points that Lin Xiu got from the match.

Plus, there was a lucky draw event a few days ago and he got a few more odd crystals.

Then, Lin Xiu put on his Silver Leopard Armour and took a deep breath. He placed his hand over the Dark Edge that was placed next to his bed and placed the spear inside the box.

“I won’t be heading for training today.” After walking to the living hall, he saw Luo Yue and informed her about it.

“Where are you going?” Luo Yue asked subconsciously.

For the past few days where they were in the Sacred Region Academy, she has always been training with Lin Xiu. It felt a little odd without him.

“Emmm… Dean Baili told me to look for something in the ocean. Don’t worry. I should be back by noon.”

“Oh.” Luo Yue nodded her head. She hesitated for a moment before saying, “Be careful.”

“Alright. Thank you for caring.”

“I wasn’t caring about you.” Luo Yue said with a cold snort when he saw Lin Xiu teasing her.

“Sure. You weren’t.” Lin XIu chuckled.

With Luo Yue’s reaction, Lin XIu was sure that she was just someone who was cold on the outside.

This sort of attitude wasn’t inborn; it looked more like a defensive mechanism.

She must have been through a lot of sufferings when she was younger.

Well, that would make sense if it was related to Luo Yue’s abilities now. If it wasn’t because of the sufferings that she had to go through, she wouldn’t have been able to train to this level at such a young age.

They left the house together and as she walked towards the training room for strength training, Lin Xiu walked towards the gate of the school.

“You’re here?” As Lin Xiu walked towards the gate, he saw a man who had his back towards him.

“I’m here.” Lin Xiu nodded his head when the man turned around and it was Dean Baili.

There were a few students who greeted Dean Baili when they were passing by and were also curiously staring at Lin Xiu.

They didn’t understand why the dean would be standing together with a student.

“Alright then, come with me and get yourself equipped.” Dean Baili said towards Lin Xiu and brought him towards the security room that was right next to the main gate.

“Dean Baili.” The staff at the security room quickly stood up and greeted him when they saw the dean.

“Give him the diving gears.” Dean Baili nodded at the rest of them and instructed one of the staff in the room.

“Yes, Sir!” When the man got the dean’s instruction, he nodded his head and said towards Lin Xiu, “Come with me.”

“En.”

Lin Xiu followed him and soon they were standing right in front of a weird machine.

“Get on it.” The man said towards Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded his head and stood on the machine. He lifted up his hands and stood with his feet apart. Then, the machine started spinning and was putting on a special diving suit for Lin Xiu.

“And….this is a helmet which can provide you oxygen for at least twelve hours.” Another man passed a transparent helmet to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded his head as he took the helmet and saw Dean Baili walking towards him.

“Take this.” Dean Baili took out a small machine that looked like a radar from his pocket.

“This is to detect the energy. Remember to find out what it is.”

“Also… No matter what you see underwater, don’t be afraid.”
