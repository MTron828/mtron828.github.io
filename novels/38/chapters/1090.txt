Chapter 1091: Fire Wing Dragon

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu continued walking alone on the Road of Ice and Fire.

He held onto the black spear and continued walking on the ground covered with air.

One entire day.

He has been walking for an entire day.

But now, the only thing that Lin Xiu could see ahead of him was grounds that were covered in ice.

Everything around him was white in colour.

There weren’t any changes to his surroundings yet.

The Road of Ice and Fire…..there was ice, where’s the fire?

Where would he find the fire?

Did he go the wrong way?

If it was according to the intel that he has received, it shouldn’t be…

Then, he looked at the radar on the watch.

He has been getting further and further and logically speaking, he should have reached.

As he continued walking for another day, Lin Xiu suddenly felt that something wasn’t right.

“I can feel it already.”

Lin Xiu reached out his hand and he could clearly feel the change in the temperature around him.

“Huh?”

As he looked up, he noticed that there was a bright red flow ahead of him.

He’s here?

When he saw the glow, Lin Xiu became anxious.

He picked up his speed and rushed forward.

As Lin Xiu continued running forward, he could clearly see that there was a sea of fire in front of him.

The ground ahead of him was covered in flames!

He could feel the heat coming from the flames and Lin Xiu looked delighted and surprised.

The temperature was high.

But, it was still a little longer compared to hellfire.

Therefore, this was still within an acceptable range for Lin Xiu. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lin Xiu was now standing on ice ground while there was a sea of fire ahead of him.

The fire and ice were right next to each other but there were completely different worlds.

This was definitely an eye-opening experience.

“The point where fire meets ice…”

The Orchid of Heaven should be around here.

But, this was something rare and difficult to find.

Lin Xiu walked along the part where the ice met fire and he took a good look around.

He was looking for the Orchid of Heaven.

“Hmm?”

Just when Lin Xiu continued walking, there was a fire snake that jumped out of nowhere.

It went directly to Lin Xiu.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu quickly moved his hand and flicked the snake away.

When the fire touched Lin Xiu’s arm, there was no hand done to Lin Xiu.

With the heart of frost, the cold was nothing for Lin Xiu.

While, the flames on the other hand, definitely had no effect on him.

Lin Xiu was still walking on the same path.

However, he still couldn’t find the Orchid of Heaven.

“Maybe there isn’t any…”

Lin Xiu frowned.

However, he wasn’t ready to give up yet and continued looking for it.

Crackling – –

Soon, Lin Xiu walked far ahead and the flames around him were slightly different from before.

These flames were much scarier than the previous ones.

Even Lin Xiu could feel how terrifying these flames were.

It was almost similar to hellfire.

“This…”

Lin Xiu saw a ball of flame and decided to put his hand in it.

However, as soon as he touched it, the huge flame burnt and Lin Xiu’s fingers instantly turned black.

As he felt the pain, he quickly pulled back his hands.

This flame….how can it be so strong?

Lin Xiu’s eyes were filled with surprise as well.

The hellfire wasn’t able to burn his hand but this flame here turned his hand into charcoal.

Lin Xiu pulled hard on the finger that was toasted and tried to pull it away. Then, his flesh and bones were exposed to the air.

The pain of it caused Lin Xiu to frown.

But soon, because of his quick recovery, Lin Xiu was able to recover quickly from the injury.

This flame was indeed peculiar.

Lin Xiu stood on the ground filled with ice and stared at the flame ahead.

He continued looking around until he heard noises from afar. It was a cracking sound.

What was that noise?

Lin Xiu took a good look at it and noticed that the ground was slowly shaking.

Hmm?

When he got a closer look, Lin Xiu then noticed that there was a large crack that appeared on the ground.

As soon as he felt it, Lin Xiu moved and flew into the air.

Boom – –

Then, all of the grounds around Lin Xiu collapsed instantly.

There was a small pit that appeared.

Lin Xiu looked at it and frowned.

What was this?

Soon, there was a bright red light that was flashing from inside the pit.

Then, a huge fire dragon flew out of the pit!

The dragon had wings and it looked strange.

“Fire Wing Dragon…”

With the help of the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu could clearly see the stats of this evolved beast.

It was a saintly beat!

Another saint level evolved beast!

However, this evolved beast was a little weaker than the frost dragon.

Seeing how the fire dragon had appeared, Lin Xiu did not feel scared. Instead, he got excited.

Wherever there was a beast seen, there will be treasure found.

If there was a beast here, it meant that the Orchid of Heaven should be here too!

He gripped tightly onto his long spear when he thought of this.

Roar – –

As the fire dragon flew into the air, its mouth was wide open and there was a large flame that came rushing toward Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank subconsciously.

Then, he quickly released his ‘sphere’.

The horrible flame instantly covered Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’ entirely.

Although he had his ‘sphere’ protecting him, Lin Xiu could still clearly feel the scorching heat from the flame.

The fire dragon that was flying in the air noticed that his flame had failed to burn Lin Xiu into ash and he let out a loud roar.

Its mouth was opened wide once again and it was about to bite onto Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’.

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered and used ‘flashing soul’. His body then suddenly disappeared from the ground.

The fire dragon missed its target.

At the same time, Lin Xiu appeared behind the fire dragon. He held onto his long spear and then aimed it at the dragon’s head!

Boom – –

With the loud sound following one after another, there was a huge force that pushed the fire dragon away.

Boom – –

Its huge body landed heavily on the ground and there was a huge explosion.

There were a large number of cracks everywhere!

Roar – –

The fire dragon started roaring loudly.

Its entire body was slowly turning red!
