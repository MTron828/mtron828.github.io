Boom –

As the power of Lin Xiu’s body was released, in the next moment, the powerful source strength attacked them directly.

Those warriors who had restrained Duan Zeyan and Wang Qiang were directly hit and flew out.

After Lin Xiu waved his right hand again, the two flew to Lin Xiu’s side.

“Are you guys alright?”

!!

Lin Xiu looked at Wang Qiang, who was in a bad shape, with a lot of injuries on his face and asked.

“fine…”

Wang Qiang said with difficulty at this time.

“I’m sorry, I have embarrassed the master…”

“It’s okay.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“This person… this person has a special secret technique that can search our memories…”

Duan Zeyan sat on the ground at this time and said, panting.

Hearing Duan Zeyan’s words, Lin Xiu immediately raised his brows.

No wonder this man knew his name.

“You guys have a rest first.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Looking at the warriors in front of him, he slowly walked forward.

The warriors on the opposite side looked at Lin Xiu’s movements and their eyes were filled with caution.

At this time, they were holding the weapons in their hands and the source strength of their bodies burst out.

Because Lin Xiu has thirty-three source rings in his hands.

It was enough to prove the strength of Lin Xiu.

At this time, Lin Xiu looked at the man. In his hand, there were more than forty source rings, emitting a dazzling light.

“The other two Source Stones are in your hands?”

Lin Xiu looked at him, then said lightly.

“En? Sounds like you already have three energy source stones.

The man with the black long sword on his back looked at Lin Xiu and said lightly.

“Hand them over.”

“I should be the one saying that to you.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Then he glanced at the warriors behind him.

“But before that, you should clean up the rubbish.”

Lin Xiu’s words just fell and at this moment, he waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand directly.

One after another dark blue flaming birds rushed towards the front in an instant!

The man with the black sword on his back stood there and didn’t move at all.

It seems that there was no fear of these flaming birds at all.

But the warriors in the back all had horror in their eyes at this time.

All of them unfolded their ‘Sphere’ and wanted to resist the incoming flaming birds.

“What!!!”

Soon, as the flaming birds slammed into their ‘Sphere’, wailings and screams came over.

The temperature of these flaming birds was really terrifying. At this moment, even if they unfolded the ‘Sphere’, they felt that their ‘Sphere’ would melt away.

In the next moment, as their ‘Spheres’ melted away, their bodies directly touched those dark blue ‘Spheres’.

Soon, their bodies were directly burned into coke.

“Pretty strong.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

With a wave of the man’s right hand, the flame that burst out from a flaming bird was directly extinguished by him.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu raised his brows immediately. This man’s strength seemed a little unusual.

“By the way, my name is Sun Jian. Before dying, you should remember this name.”

At the same time that the man said out loud, he slowly pulled out the black giant sword behind his back.

For some reason, Lin Xiu felt that the black giant sword he pulled out was very strange.

The moment he drew his sword, he charged directly toward Lin Xiu.

Dang–

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank and the spear in his hand directly blocked his attack.

The black giant sword he held in his hand was very sharp and when it collided with the Dark Edge spear, Lin Xiu felt an extremely strong impact.

“Eh? You are the first person on this planet who can catch my blow without retreating.”

Looking at Lin Xiu, who was holding a Dark Edge spear and confronted him head-on, but didn’t take a step back, Sun Jian showed a hint of approval.

Like an aloof warrior looking at a low-level warrior who showed surprising strength.

“But it’s not going to be that simple.”

As Sun Jian spoke, the giant sword in his hand continued to swing.

Lin Xiu didn’t let down his guard at all. At this time, the Dark Edge spear was in Lin Xiu’s hands, as if it had become one with Lin Xiu.

And now Lin Xiu was practicing the holy-level Destiny Spear art.

The spear art was many times better than before.

Dangdang-

Under the collision of the two’s weapons, a deafening sound suddenly erupted.

Because of the title of Sage warrior, when Lin Xiu attacked him, 1% of his power would be recovered.

And with the frantically waving of the spear, some skills with the wind attribute were automatically released in an instant.

Sun Jian, who was at ease just now, began to frown.

Because he felt that Lin Xiu’s spear art was not only superb but also released some wind blades from time to time when the spear attacked.

Making him uncomfortable.

Especially every time Lin Xiu attacked, he felt that the power of his attack was being resisted by some kind of strange energy.

Losing most of the power of his attacks.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s Rage Build-up was already full and without any hesitation, he directly used the power-up strike!

Dang–

Because of the power-up strike, the shot that stabbed out was full of majestic and terrifying strength.

Sun Jian also clearly felt it. At this time, he subconsciously used the body of his black giant sword to block it.

As the spear stabbed at his sword, the incomparably powerful force directly caused Sun Jian’s figure to fly out.

“Damn…”

After flying out a certain distance, Sun Jian stabilized his body.

Looking at Lin Xiu not far away, his eyes were also full of caution and he wasn’t as confident as before.

At this moment, Sun Jian’s face became ugly.

The source strength in the body began to slowly burst out.

The powerful source strength that erupted from his body caused a large number of cracks to appear in the surrounding ground.

“Eh?”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu immediately raised his brows.

Just now, Lin Xiu used his Analytic eye to see that this man’s strength was at peak Respected warrior.

But at this time, when he used his Analytic eye to look at him again, the strength of this man has instantly become sage warrior-level.

Undoubtedly, he was able to hide his strength in a special way.

“interesting.”

When Lin Xiu found out about this, the corners of his mouth twitched.

When Sun Jian used the ‘Disguise’ skill, he thought that Lin Xiu’s strength was ordinary.

But after the battle, he realized that Lin Xiu must be a warrior at the level of Sage warrior!
