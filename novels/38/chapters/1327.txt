1328 Noble God Was Shocked

Seeing how the entire stage was now filled with a pale white glow, Yuan Zheng finally explained himself.

“Usually, this light energy wouldn’t cause much effect on the other warriors but since you were using dark energy, it would be different for you.”

“By now….you would have felt the backlash from it right?”

Yuan Zheng smiled.

The light energy was the nemesis of the dark energy.

At the same time, he could also clearly feel that Lin Xiu was getting weaker.

The little black dragon, that was Lin Xiu’s divine spirit, seemed to come from the dark energy as well and it was getting affected by the light energy released by Yuan Zheng.

“Well, goodbye.”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was looking weak and pale, Yuan Zheng transferred all of his energy onto his warhammers.

Both war hammers started trembling vigorously due to the large amount of energy.

There was a vast amount of energy that came along with his black panther!

Then, he aimed them at Lin Xiu!

Xiu – –

It was in a blink of an eye that Yuan Zheng stood right in front of Lin Xiu.

They already have a winner!

Both the hammers were inches away from Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu, who has been badly affected by the backlash of the light energy, would never be able to block such a powerful attack!

“Are you sure about that?”

Lin Xiu sneered and immediately activated ‘Source Strength Control’!!!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Then, all the rich energy in the air headed towards Lin Xiu’s body!

At the same time, all of the source energy from the warriors around seemed to have been released and they were all getting absorbed into Lin Xiu’s body as well!

“Huh?!”

Riyan Noble God, who was at his seat, felt something was wrong as well.

This was because he clearly felt that a part of his energy had been taken away from him!

What was happening?

He looked around before letting out a breath of relief.

It doesn’t feel like there were other warrior gods that suddenly appeared in the arena.

However, he wasn’t the only one. The rest of the audience as well as those who sat next to him were looking stunned as well.

All of their source energy was being absorbed!

Plus, compared to the Noble God, they seemed to have lost even more!

The Noble God quickly thought about it and soon noticed the direction as to where the energies were headed to.

It was on the stage!

All of it happened so quickly and it was all within a split second.

Yuan Zheng, who had released all of the energy in his body and was ready to beat Lin Xiu, suddenly felt that something was wrong. With his arms in the air, he could feel that there was a sudden surge of energy.

What was this?!

Yuan Zheng’s pupils shrink uncontrollably.

This surge of energy was overpowering and it was much more powerful than what he had felt earlier!

Was it from Lin Xiu? How would that be possible?!

However, he had no other choice but to stop his attack and start defending against Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s Haoyue Spear was already attacking him with no hesitation!

The spear instantly collided with the warhammers!

Boom – –

With a loud explosion that followed, Yuan Zheng’s body was then thrown far into the distance!

Boom – –

His warhammer fell onto the ground and Yuan Zheng’s body landed on the energy barrier outside of the stage.

Then, a hole appeared on the energy barrier.

Yuan Zheng’s body was then thrown out of the energy barrier.

“That’s impossible!”

Wan Gang was in disbelief as he stood up with his eyes open wide. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The energy barrier was built around the stage in order to prevent the audience from being injured by the intense energy released by the warriors during the fight.

But, he would have never thought that the energy barrier would break after being hit by Yuan Zheng!

How powerful would that kid have to be in order to do so?

“That young man…..he’s interesting.”

...

Riyan Noble God was getting interested in Lin Xiu.

At the same time, he was shocked as well.

The energy that Lin Xiu had released earlier was almost the same as him!

As they turned their attention back to Yuan Zheng, his body was found on the ground.

The medics quickly rushed over, trying to get to his body.

“He’s still alive?”

Seeing how there were no notifications that came from his system, Lin Xiu was a little disappointed.

Yuan Zheng was indeed a powerful man. If he could kill him, Lin Xiu would definitely gain a huge amount of EXP.

Plus, his little black dragon didn’t even gain an upper hand while fighting against the black panther who was a black grade divine spirit.

Forget it.

Lin Xiu controlled it with his mind and the little black dragon disappeared.

...

“Match end! The winner is Lin Xiu from Lingxian City!!!!”

The announcer, who was levitating in the air, finally revealed the result!

The rest of the audience were still in shock but when they heard the announcement, all of them started cheering.

As for those who had bet on Yuan Zheng being the winner, all of them looked dull.

They never would have thought that Lin Xiu could be so terrifyingly powerful.

“I’ve said it! Our city lord will definitely win the match!”

Lei Chong was shouting happily as well as he peered at the middle aged man who sat next to Baili Haoling.

“Who would have thought…”

The middle aged man let out a bitter laugh and shook his head helplessly.

He never would have thought that Lin Xiu had such hidden strength.

That was incredibly frightening.

Only the Noble God would be able to compete against such skills.

As he thought about it, his body trembled vigorously.

“There is a chance that he might win the final as well.”

The middle aged man looked at Baili Haoling and Lei Chong before voicing his opinion.

“He will definitely be champion!”

Lei Chong was unhappy with what the man said and quickly corrected him.

“Hahahahahaha!!!”

Baili Haoling started laughing as well.

This was because she had bet on Lin Xiu being the winner. With the betting ratio, she was incredibly surprised to see the amount of money in her bank account!

Lei Chong then looked at the projection that came from Baili Haoling’s watch and his eyes were filled with envy.

If he had the money, he would have bet everything on Lin Xiu.

The middle aged man felt jealous as well.

He patted his forehead in remorse. If only he knew…

“Huuuuu~”

After hearing the announcement about his victory, Lin Xiu jumped off the stage.

Due to the rules, Lin Xiu could not continue attacking Yuan Zheng and he felt that it was a waste.

He took a deep breath and just as the aftermath of the ‘Rage’ was about to hit him, Lin Xiu got back into his seat.
