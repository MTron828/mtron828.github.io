Chapter 329: Zhang Jie’s Terrifying Power

Dang–

Lin Xiu held the long spear in his hand tightly, then attacked the ring that was spinning towards him and a clear sound rang out.

And this time, Lin Xiu wasn’t affected by the impact of this ring, but actually hit it away! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The ‘Overlord Spear Art’ that Lin Xiu learned before was known for its power and dominance. Now as Lin Xiu used his entire body’s strength, his physical strength has reached the extreme.

Swish——

Meanwhile, Zhang Jie ignored Lin Xiu and rushed towards Luo Yue!

Lin Xiu saw this scene and there was a change in his expression. Just as he was about to rush over to Luo Yue’s side to help her deal with Zhang Jie, those two rings flew over again!

Damn it!

Lin Xiu, who was about to rush over, had to back off at this moment.

These rings were too sharp. If he got touched by this very fast spinning ring, his body would probably be cut in half just like those trees!

Dang——

On the other side, Zhang Jie held the dagger in her hand and slashed towards Luo Yue’s body!

The dagger slashed onto the long sword Luo Yue was holding and made a clear sound.

Although Luo Yue blocked Zhang Jie’s attack, at the next moment, another dagger appeared in Zhang Jie’s left hand and stabbed Luo Yue’s head directly!

The pupils in Luo Yue’s eyes shrank as she tilted her head instinctively and the dagger went brushed past her head.

The dagger was so close to penetrating Luo Yue’s head!

“It seems that your strength had restored quite a bit. But it is impossible for you to restore it to the original state!” Zhang Jie looked at Luo Yue while waving the dagger in her hand frantically towards Luo Yue!

Swish swish swish——

The blades kept cutting through the air and some of Luo Yue’s hair was accidentally cut off.

The situation was very dangerous.

What did she mean!?

Lin Xiu heard Zhang Jie’s words from a distance and was surprised because according to what Zhang Jie said, it seemed that Luo Yue’s strength had been weakened.

But he clearly remembered that Luo Yue’s strength was around the level of a rank 5 warrior previously and had already reached a rank 6 warrior now. So logically speaking, she should have become stronger.

Could it be that… Luo Yue was stronger previously!?

But it was now too late for Lin Xiu to think about this. He looked over there and saw the ring that was spinning at a very fast speed in the air and rushing towards Lin Xiu once again!

Lin Xiu saw this scene and the pupils in his eyes constricted.

This ring was really terrifying – just what force is driving it that it could keep attacking him?

Dang——

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth, held the Dark Edge Spear with both hands then slammed it vigorously and knocked out the ring again!

‘Awe of the phoenix’!!!

The second he sent the ring flying, Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge Spear firmly and numerous phoenixes flew towards Zhang Jie who was fighting Luo Yue!

But it was as if Zhang Jie had eyes on her back. When the phoenixes were about to hit her, she jumped and dodged.

Bang bang bang——

One after another, the phoenixes all hit the ground, making a dull sound after another.

“You’re courting death, boy!” Although Zhang Jie’s agile body dodged the phoenixes continuously, her hair still got burned a little.

Zhang Jie’s face turned gloomy.

She jumped to the tree next to her and as soon as she exerted force on her legs, she rushed towards Lin Xiu swiftly!

The pair of daggers in her hands were very thin and appeared transparent. Under the reflection of the sun, they flickered with cold light.

Dang dang dang——

Before Lin Xiu had time to react, she waved the daggers in her hands and attacked Lin Xiu wildly!

Although he held the Dark Edge Spear to block the attacks, Lin Xiu was obviously already a little tired.

At the next moment, as the dagger in Zhang Jie’s right hand slashed towards Lin Xiu swiftly, his head was cut off directly!

Luo Yue’s eyes widened when she saw this scene, but she immediately recalled something and her tensed heart relaxed instantly.

She gripped the thin sword in her hand tightly and at this moment, there was also a faint glow reflecting on the surface of the sword.

“Where did he go!?” Zhang Jie thought that she had killed Lin Xiu but quickly realized that this “Lin Xiu” was a fake!

The real person wasn’t there!

When she turned her head, she saw that Luo Yue had already swung the thin long sword towards her!

The rays of white light on the long sword formed a crescent-shaped sword aura, which attacked Zhang Jie’s body directly!

The sword aura rushed over at an extremely fast speed and cut through the air.

“Get lost!!!” Seeing this, Zhang Jie’s expression changed and she clearly felt the horror of this sword aura.

Then, she formed an “X” with the daggers in her hands and the sword aura of a cross burst out.

It rushed towards the front!

Boom——

The two sword auras collided and a deafening sound rang out.

Even the ground shook and there was rumbling.

Meanwhile, Lin Xiu jumped up high and thrust the Dark Edge Spear in his hand downwards, piercing a rapidly spinning ring to the ground.

At this moment, with Lin Xiu’s violent force, this ring was embedded directly in the ground.

He finally dealt with it…

Seeing that the ring that kept spinning was finally in the ground, he heaved a sigh of relief.

Then, in the same way, he pierced the other ring into the mud.

At this moment, he looked at the other side and saw that Luo Yue’s body was like a broken kite as she retreated.

Bang——

She pierced the long sword into the ground to stabilize herself.

Pfff——

At this moment, she spat out a mouthful of blood.
