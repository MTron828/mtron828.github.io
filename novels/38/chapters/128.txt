Chapter 129: Seize!

At this moment, with the skill covering the sky and launching its attacks to the other side, the whole area appeared brighter. Following the release of the skill, many of the Green Vine beast’s huge and long tentacles were chopped off.

Gu——

A loud noise resounded at this moment and the Green Vine beast, which used its tentacles to support its body, looked like it was on the verge of collapsing.

Lin Xiu constantly brandished his weapon to attack and several phoenixes kept charging in that direction.

The tentacles of the Green Vine beast seemed afraid of flames and many of them got burnt under Lin Xiu’s ‘Awe of the Phoenix’.

With this skill, the rank 6 Green Vine beast seemed to have suffered considerable damage.

“Continue attacking, victory is in sight!” Liu Qiang roared loudly at this moment.

He held a giant sword and cut off the tentacles of the Green Vine beast again.

Although the rank 6 Green Vine beast had a huge body and looked terrifying, with so many warriors attacking it, it was still quite strenuous for the Green Vine beast.

Some warriors had already rushed to the front and wanted to get rid of this rank 6 Green Vine beast in order to seize the Odd crystal!

These warriors were scheming. The Odd Crystal of a beast rank 6 and above was rare so if they got it, they would have a substantial upgrade in strength when they absorb the energy inside. Also, if they sold it, it could sell at a very high price!

“Don’t go over there.” When Lin Xiu saw that Zhang Yin and the others wanted to rush forward to attack, Lin Xiu suddenly called out.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Zhang Yin and the rest were stunned. Those warriors had already gone forward and just as they were about to kill that Green Vine beast, he realized that those tentacles that had been cut off were growing again!

And this Green Vine beast no longer looked weak and appeared enraged instead.

Those tentacles rushed toward those warriors!

Some warriors didn’t have time to react and froze on the spot. In the next moment, some warriors were caught off guard and those tentacles went through their bodies!

These warriors who were attacked did not die, it looked as if they had been injected with something into their bodies by the tentacles. At this point, their bodies suddenly had a large number of bruises, and their eyes had turned red.

Wow–

A sharp cry escapes the mouths of those who were attacked by the tentacles and they all turned into horrifying zombies!

“Sure enough, the vines we encountered just now were these tentacles and this monster was born over there.” Lin Xiu saw this scene and said coldly.

Zhang Yin and the others gasped. They didn’t expect that this monster who appeared so weak just now from all the attacks would grow raging mad at this moment.

Also, there were viruses in its tentacles, no, its entire body was filled with viruses, right?

They trembled at that thought.

The men who turned into zombies were frantically pouncing on the surrounding warriors!

Several of them attacked Lin Xiu and Lin Xiu snorted coldly, then brandished his spear.

The strength of these zombie warriors was more powerful, their speed was also faster, so Lin Xiu was alarmed and also became more cautious.

Also, he pierced through the heads of the warriors who had turned into zombies. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

There were system prompts in his mind from gaining experience, but Lin Xiu did not pay attention to these. Due to the rage of the Green Vine beast, its tentacles were attacking menacingly.

“Hurry up! Use your strongest skill or we’ll all die!!!” Liu Qiang didn’t panic and directly cut the zombie’s body in half as he roared.

The remaining warriors were quite high-ranking and they came to their senses at this moment. If they didn’t deal with this beast seriously, everyone would probably die here!

“Go to hell!!!”

A large number of warriors directly rushed over, then yelled and used all their source strength, releasing powerful close combat skills on the Green Vine beast!

The whole ground seemed to shake at this moment.

Rumble––

Many of the tentacles on the Green Vine beast’s body were also cut off that they began to reveal the body that had not been wrapped in tentacles.

“Go to hell!” Liu Qiang was taken aback when he saw this and leaped up with the giant sword in his hands. At this moment, he turned into a huge giant sword illusion and cut down the Green Vine beast!

Liu Qiang had accumulated a lot of strength just now just to perform this blow. Before those tentacles recovered again and form a protective barrier to block the front of its body, Liu Qiang directly gave it an extremely powerful blow.

He was also a rank 5 warrior and if not for the giant body of this rank 6 Green Vine beast and tentacles filled with a virus, he wouldn’t have to work so hard!

The Green Vine beast roared and its huge body wobbled. In the next moment, it directly fell to the ground.

Its body split open at this moment and a lot of light blue liquid flowed out, similar to the human blood.

Odd Crystal!

Everyone had the same thought at the same time and rushed over with reddened eyes!

“This is mine!” Liu Qiang saw that the Green Vine beast was seriously injured on the ground and a sinister expression appeared on his face as he charged toward those warriors and killed them with his giant sword!

Those who lost a lot of source strength and physical strength weren’t a match for Liu Qiang at all. At this moment, they were sliced into two by Liu Qiang’s giant sword.

“What are we going to do now?” Zhang Yin and the others saw the scene ahead and were appalled. They did not think that things would turn out this way.

Lin Xiu did not speak, his heart was thumping at this moment. A rank 6 Odd Crystal, he heard that Odd Crystals that were rank 6 and above were not the same as ordinary Odd Crystals. Sometimes, there would be some Odd Crystals with unique shapes that had special functions.

With that thought, Lin Xiu’s blood was surging. He placed the spear box on the ground and charged toward that Green Vine beast in the next moment!
