Chapter 86: Blood-eyed Lone Wolf

At this moment, everyone sat by the river bank and caught a lot of fish, then grilled them by the fire.

“Are you from the city?” Lin Xiu asked Baili Haoling while grilling the fish.

“No.” Baili Haoling shook his head and continued to grill the fish as if it was the first time he was grilling fish and seemed quite excited.

Lin Xiu saw this and was somewhat speechless. However, Baili Haoling shouldn’t be lying as such a powerful person didn’t seem to exist in Lian City.

Lin Xiu could somewhat sense that this person’s strength was comparable to Tang Mubai’s.

“Roar!!!”

Just then, there was a sudden roar that came from the other side. It sounded like an animal which surprised Lin Xiu and the others who were sitting around the fire.

This area should not have any strong evolved beasts who were also not afraid of fire. If it came over at this moment, it would probably be a Blood-eyed Lone Wolf.

“What the hell is that!?” Lei Liang and the others stood up.

Ordinary evolved beasts wouldn’t simply get close when they saw fire at night. How could there still be evolved beasts coming over now?

And that howl sent chills down their spines.

“Sounds like a wolf.” Zhang Zhimin frowned. He looked over to the front of the riverbank and suddenly saw a pair of red eyes.

The eyes were blood-thirsty and savage.

“It’s a Blood-eyed Lone Wolf.” Lin Xiu also stood up at this moment and became alert.

This rank 3 evolved beast wasn’t an ordinary evolved beast; its special characteristic was its blood-red eyes and it was extremely fast. Also, it was good at being alone, and after it found a target, it would not let go of its prey!

The Analytic Eye was activated and what he saw was exactly the same as what he read in books.

“Roar!!!”

Lin Xiu hadn’t made a move yet and that Blood-eyed Lone Wolf was already charging toward them!

Under the light of the black moonlight, the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf was like a silver shadow, rushing over in an instant!

“Damn!” Lei Liang saw this scene and his pupils constricted, the double-bladed ax in his hands was just about to wave toward the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf that was coming!

However, that Blood-eyed Lone Wolf swerved all of a sudden and dodged his attack.

Then, it turned and was about to pounce on Lei Liang!

“Get out of here!” Zhang Zhimin and Yang Lin immediately rushed over and picked up their weapons, about to attack the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf.

“Roar!” The Blood-eyed Lone Wolf sensed danger and dodged in a flash!

“What!?” Zhang Zhimin and Yang Lin were both taken aback.

This beast’s IQ was too high. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

On the other side, Wu Xiu was trembling slightly. They were all rank 1 warriors and the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf was a rank 3 evolved beast which was equivalent to the strength of a rank 2 warrior!

The Blood-eyed Lone Wolf that jumped to the other side to dodge suddenly looked at Lin Xiu with its slitty pupils.

It seemed to sense Lin Xiu’s weak aura as its feet dug into the ground, and in the next second, it ran in Lin Xiu’s direction!

Zhang Zhimin and the others were stunned when they saw this scene, but they didn’t go over to help as they watched this Blood-eyed Lone Wolf rushing to Lin Xiu’s side.

The claws of the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf were very long, and under the moonlight, a cold light could be seen.

Lin Xiu clenched his fists at this moment; he was not afraid but was a little excited.

‘Fool, go to hell!’ Zhang Zhimin saw that Lin Xiu did not hide and wanted to attack. He couldn’t help but scoff in his heart.

‘Rupturing Fist’!

Lin Xiu waved his fist and produced a loud explosion in the air as the gloves in his hands turned red!

Bang——!

Lin Xiu’s fist and the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf’s sharp claws collided, letting out a loud noise and it even gave off a spark of fire.

How… how could it be!

Zhang Zhimin was astonished when he saw this. This chap’s punch was actually just as strong as the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf’s claw?

The claws of the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf were notoriously sharp!

Oh right, the gloves!

They must be extraordinary!

Seeing this, a tinge of greed appeared in Zhang Zhimin’s eyes.

‘These two little imps have so many precious things.’

“Hey, you’re pretty good.” Baili Haoling gnawed on a grilled fish until only the fish bones were left. He rubbed his stomach, then stood up and saw Lin Xiu fighting the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf. Baili Haoling was quite surprised.

“Quickly come and help!” Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and called out.

Although he was used to bearing the burden for the day, this weight was still quite suppressive for his strength and speed.

His current strength was probably only the level of a rank 1 warrior.

Tear——

In the next second, Lin Xiu’s clothes were torn open by the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf, leaving behind a stream of blood.

Damn it, this beast was moving too fast.

Lei Liang and the others were also afraid and didn’t dare to step forward. After all, this was a rank 3 evolved beast ah!

Baili Haoling pondered at this moment, then rushed over. Just as that Blood-eyed Lone Wolf was about to take the chance to bite down on Lin Xiu’s neck, Baili Haoling immediately pulled out the double-saber from his waist.

He pulled out the saber so swiftly that only two white rays of light could be seen.

“Roar!” The Blood-eyed Lone Wolf roared at this moment as its tail fell to the ground.

“What a pity.” With a saber in each hand, Baili Haoling saw the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf jumping to the other side in an instant.

“Almost got killed.” Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief. Carrying a heavy burden would have this shortcoming, there was no way he could use his full strength.

“I thought… you were strong.” Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu for a while and said doubtfully.

Lin Xiu’s gaze changed. He used the ‘Disguise’ skill, yet he could still feel his original strength?

“Lin Xiu, are you all right?” Just when Lin Xiu was wondering, Lei Liang and the others ran over and stood in front.

“I’m fine.”

Lin Xiu shook his head, but he was mocking in his heart. This group of people simply watched the show just now and when they saw that there was no more danger, they quickly came forward.

They were just a group of warriors he encountered in the wild, so he didn’t expect much from them either.

“Roar!” And that Blood-eyed Lone Wolf over there had its hairs standing on ends like it saw something horrifying.
