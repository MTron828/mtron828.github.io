Chapter 615: Ah Yue

When you look at these warriors, you know that they are not people to mess with.

Lin Xiu walked to the entrance of the Sky Arena at this time, a staff member stopped him.

“Please show your admission ticket.”

“We need a ticket for this?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows, and then said lightly.

“Over there.”

One of the staff members pointed to the service window next to him and said.

This admission ticket costs one million union coins, which was indeed too much.

Fortunately, he borrowed one million alliance coins from Ouyang Hang when he just arrived.

After purchasing the admission ticket, Lin Xiu easily entered.

“Kill him! Kill him for me!”

As soon as he walked in, Lin Xiu heard many shouts.

What he saw was a huge battle arena, surrounded by a circle with a large number of seats, and people were everywhere at this time.

Some people got excited and stood up and shouted loudly.

Lin Xiu squeezed in with difficulty and saw two warriors in bronze armor and bronze masks, he couldn’t see their faces clearly and they were fighting frantically on the competition stage in the middle.

Under the frantic battle between the two, there was blood everywhere, and it looked very scary.

It was like an ancient Roman gladiator.

Boom–

In the next moment, one of the men with a bronze mask like a dog’s head held a huge sword, and instantly cut his opponent in half!

The shock of the spash of blood made the surrounding audience scream.

“Our kobold won the victory again, he won ten games in total, and received a reward of 10 million union coins!”

“Kobold! Kobold!”

At this time, the warriors around were shouting the code name of that person, and the whole scene seemed to be boiling.

“Then, next, who is going to challenge the kobold, he has already won ten games in a row and if you end him, you can get 20 million union coins!!!”

At this time, the host stood on a small floating aircraft and shouted exaggeratedly with a wireless microphone.

“Go!”

The audience who seemed to support the kobold just now shouted loudly for other warriors to challenge the kobold.

After a while, another warrior wearing a similar attire came to the stage and the surroundings began to boil again.

These violent battles seemed to be enjoyable for the audience, causing Lin Xiu to frown slightly.

However, those who could come here were all extremely fierce people, and they were not good people at all. Lin Xiu wasn’t worried at all, holding his Dark Edge spear and walking to the other side.

There was a lounge in the front, which was actually a place to change.

As soon as Lin Xiu walked in, he saw many strong men inside. These seemed to hear Lin Xiu’s footsteps. At this time, all their eyes turned to look at Lin Xiu.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s seemingly not sturdy body, some people showed a sneer at the corners of their mouths.

“Kid, what are you doing here?”

A staff member was at the table in front, resting his chin on his hand, yawning, seeming to be a little sleepy.

“Joining the match.” Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

“Joining the match? Interesting.”

The staff member seemed to be a little more awake at this time, and then said to Lin Xiu, “Newcomer?”

“En.”

“Go in and find a bronze battle suit and bronze mask, and report here later.”

He pointed to the back and said.

Lin Xiu nodded, then walked into the room.

The room looked quite empty. At this time, he looked around. There were many bronze battle suits hanging around, as well as special headgear.

Lin Xiu looked at it casually, then found a battle suit and put it on.

The mask was a human-shaped mask with a crescent moon in the middle.

“Oh? Have you changed your clothes?”

When the staff member saw Lin Xiu walking out, he immediately said aloud.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded. Now Lin Xiu’s body was covered in these bronze costumes, even his head. Even if someone was a very familiar person, if you didn’t look carefully, you wouldn’t be able to find out who he was.

“What’s your code name?”

The staff said to Lin Xiu.

At this moment, Lin Xiu remembered that those who participated in the war before had their own code names, similar to the ‘kobold’ who just won the streak.

“Well, Ah Yue.”

Lin Xiu thought for a while, and then said aloud.

“En, quite suitable.”

The staff member looked at the crescent shape on Lin Xiu’s bronze mask, smiled, and then entered the information for Lin Xiu.

“Bank card number.”

“46464XXXXXX” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“46464XXXXXX”

The Union Coins obtained after winning here were directly credited to this card.

“Let me explain, after the competition, wait over there. When your code name is called, you have to go on stage and you can’t forfeit, otherwise…”

Saying this, the staff member laughed strangely.

Without him finishing, Lin Xiu understood what he meant.

“And the battle is a battle without rules, no limitation to weapons, and the condition of victory is that the opponent admits defeat or is killed.”

“Of course, if the other party doesn’t accept your surrender, they can kill you directly.”

“So, are you sure you want to participate? If you give up now, it’s not too late.”

The staff looked at Lin Xiu and said.

He saw how young Lin Xiu was. Such a young warrior, even a talented warrior, was not enough because the people who come here were all proficient in killing or high-ranking warriors.

Money was not so easy to earn.

“I’ve to go there right?”

Lin Xiu did not answer his words, but pointed to the front and said.

“Yes.”

The staff member was stunned for a moment, then nodded.

“Tsk tsk, another kid who doesn’t know any better sending himself to death.”

Some burly warriors who were here just now said with a sneer.

“Allocate him to me.”

A man walked over at this time, looked at the staff member, and said in a low voice.

The staff member’s eyes changed and then nodded.

There was cooperation between them. They deliberately choose a player who was less powerful to fight against and then the union coins obtained would be distributed by the man to the staff.

At this time, Lin Xiu was already standing at the area that the staff member instructed. From this position, he could clearly see the arena on the opposite side.

There were some robots on it, which were quickly cleaning the blood on the ground.

And the corpses of those warriors.

“The next battle, Elephant vs Ah Yue!”

The next moment, Lin Xiu heard a loud voice coming.

Eh? My turn so soon?
