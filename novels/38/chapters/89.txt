Chapter 90: A Wild Sprint

Lin Xiu wasn’t sure how long he practiced that night, but when he woke up the next morning, he noticed a figure standing in front of him.

Lin Xiu slowly opened his eyes and saw a very handsome face.

“What are you doing!” Lin Xiu got a shock, he then quickly got up and covered his body.

He stared at Baili Haoling.

“We’re both guys, are you really afraid that I would eat you up?” Baili Haoling pursed his lips and said.

‘It’s exactly because we’re both guys that’s why I’m afraid!’ Lin Xiu thought to himself.

With that thought, Lin Xiu kept a distance from him.

“I saw it just now.” Baili Haoling laughed.

“What did you see?” Lin Xiu was stunned then quickly glanced at his clothes, there weren’t any rips so he heaved a sigh of relief.

“You’re wearing weighted bracers and if I’m not wrong, you don’t only have bracers, your entire body is weighed down, right?” Baili Haoling spoke like he completely saw through Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu paused for a second, then nodded. This chap was really observant, Lin Xiu had already used Disguise, yet he could still sense Lin Xiu’s original strength.

“Alright, let’s continue!”

“If you’re in a weighed down state now, it would help with your training. Our goal today is to run to the mountaintop there!” Baili Haoling pointed, and the mountain peak was really tiny from where they were at, it was too small to even see.

“It’s at least 100 kilometers, right? Are you trying to kill me ah…” Lin Xiu looked in the direction that he pointed and his eyes widened.

With his body in the weighed down stone, the load of his body had increased drastically.

Lin Xiu then pulled out the stats board in his head and looked at the progress of his Quick Growth System.

“Progress 2500/50000 (Note: You will gain 50 potential points after completion)”

Wow, he actually made a progress of 2500 points last night. This was unexpected.

“Let’s go, quick!” Baili Haoling walked to the front and rode Lin Xiu’s android wolf and quickly ran ahead.

“Hey, that’s mine!”

Lin Xiu quickly ran toward that direction and went into the woods.

“Quick, quick, you’re too slow!” Baili Haoling yelled at Lin Xiu as he rode on the android wolf.

Lin Xiu clenched his teeth. Running while his body was weighed down really required a lot of strength.

Zhi zhi zhi——

And at this moment, a familiar sound echoed.

Rank 2 man-eating bird!?

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted and he saw the ugly man-eating bird flying over in front of him.

The forest here seemed to have this darned thing everywhere.

“Don’t stop, run and kill at the same time.” Baili Haoling called out, then directly threw the long sword that Lin Xiu had taken from Tang Mubai to him.

Lin Xiu caught the long sword swiftly and slashed that rank 2 man-eating bird in the next second!

Bang——

With a crisp sound, the man-eating bird was cut in half.

“You have to run and deal with these man-eating birds at the same time during this 10 kilometers. You can’t stop, or I’ll destroy your bag and this android wolf,” Baili Haoling warned Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth. While running at high-speed, he also had to attack the man-eating birds that would suddenly charge toward him. This was very tough.

He must concentrate on finding the position of the man-eating bird, then quickly and ruthlessly kill it. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

After all, it was a rank 2 man-eating bird. At the beginning, Lin Xiu found it very tiring, but he became more and more skilled gradually.

As soon as he heard the man-eating bird’s cry, Lin Xiu was able to determine its position, then simply slash and kill it.

Baili Haoling, who was sitting on the android wolf, couldn’t help but smile.

In a short period of time, it was obvious that Lin Xiu had made progress.

Speed, precision, reaction – his capabilities were improving and if he continued to train, his speed of improving would increase even faster.

“Ok, you’ve hit ten kilometers, take a break,” Baili Haoling suddenly said at this moment.

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu was relieved.

“What’s… What’s going on? Why are these things attacking only me…”

Lin Xiu stood at the same spot and was gasping for air.

“It’s simple. I’ve smeared something on you that attracted them,” Baili Haoling said with a wry smile.

‘Smeared something!?’

Lin Xiu was stunned, then he looked at his clothes and there was some light red color powder on it.

He sniffed it, and there was a weird scent that smelled like blood.

“Alright, that’s enough resting, you’re not allowed to rest in the next 20 kilometers, and while killing man-eating birds, you must grab the Odd Crystals from its body.” Just as Lin Xiu was about to say something, Baili Haoling continued.

“It’s only been a minute’s rest.”

“One minute is enough! Don’t worry, I’ll run with you for the remaining 90 kilometers.” As Baili Haoling spoke, he expertly turned off the android wolf and began running ahead in the next second.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath. The system in his head found that this progress seemed to be moving rapidly, it had become 2653!

And it had only been a short while.

Lin Xiu didn’t have time to think. At this moment, he began running once again.

Not long later, a man-eating bird flew over and Lin Xiu killed it with the long sword, chopping it directly.

Odd crystals were usually in the head of the man-eating bird. Lin Xiu also accurately cut its head into two, then an Odd crystal fell down and Lin Xiu caught it.

“No stopping! You must run and kill at the same time, then take the Odd crystal!” Baili Haoling yelled from the front.

“How is that possible…” The panting Lin Xiu said. The next second, Baili Haoling sprinted while cutting a few man-eating birds on the tree in half, collecting the Odd crystals at the same time.”

And his footsteps did not stop at all, moving naturally like flowing waters and it was simply delightful to watch.

“Why is it impossible? When your speed, precision, and responsiveness work together, it would be very easy.”
