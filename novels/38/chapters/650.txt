Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

Taking a closer look at this time, Nan Huang and Baili Haoling were still fighting together.

Nan Huang was overwhelmed by Baili Haoling’s powerful offensive and looked a little breathless.

The great revenge has been avenged, and Lin Xiu felt that he could finally suppress his anger.

But at this time, looking at the Nan Huang, there was also killing intent in his eyes.

Regardless of life or death on the platform, he will use this rule to kill Nan Huang as well.

“Your opponent is here!”

Just when Lin Xiu wanted to rush over there, he saw a cold light flashing in front of his eyes.

Boom–

Lin Xiu’s entire body was instantly cut in half by Yu Muchen’s halberd that appeared out of nowhere!

“Dead!?”

“No way? Why is it so easy!”

“What a pity…”

‘When these people saw that ‘Lin Xiu’ was cut in half, they couldn’t help but burst into an uproar.

“He’s here!”

But Yu Muchen is someone who has experienced Lin Xiu’s strength. At this time, he turned around and attacked!

As soon as he turned around, he saw that Lin Xiu had already stabbed with the Dark Edge spear in his hand!

Dang–

This blow was easily blocked by Yu Muchen.

“He’s not dead!?”

“Did I see it wrong just now?”

“What exactly is going on!”

At this time, the surrounding audience was in an uproar. They didn’t expect that the ‘Lin Xiu’ just now seemed to be fake!

Now, if these viewers take a closer look, they would find that Lin Xiu’s body, which had just been cut in half, had long disappeared.

It’s like an illusion.

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers!

Lin Xiu directly used his skill to continue to attack Yu Muchen.

But now Yu Muchen’s state was a bit strange, his power seemed to have grown a lot stronger, and at this time he easily resisted Lin Xiu’s attack.

And at this time, the huge halberd in his hand attacked Lin Xiu again! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Boom—

Seeing this scene, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed greatly.

Because Lin Xiu could clearly feel it, there was a powerful source strength fluctuation on his halberd.

Sure enough, in the next moment, he attacked Lin Xiu with the halberd in his hand, and a huge crescent-shaped energy slashed towards Lin Xiu’s body!

At this moment, Lin Xiu directly used ‘Sphere’.

Boom–

This terrifying force hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’. Although it was not able to break it, the powerful force still made Lin Xiu fly out.

“He used the “Hidden Source Technique’.”

Lin Xiu quickly stabilized his body, and at this moment, Lin Xiu heard a familiar voice.

Taking a closer look, he found that Baili Haoling had already appeared beside him.

At this time, Baili Haoling’s body seemed to have grown a lot taller, and she looked like she was about twenty years old.

“However, the source strength of this ‘Hidden Source Technique’ is not his own, an expert has added his own source strength to his body. His strength is weaker than Nan Huang.”

Baili Haoling continued to speak.

‘At the same time, Nan Huang and Yu Muchen continued to charge towards Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu didn’t have any fear on his face, instead he had a strong fighting spirit.

“Twill deal with Nan Huang.”

Lin Xiu said aloud at this time.

“Sure?”

Baili Haoling glanced at Lin Xiu and said.

Because she could feel it, Nan Huang still had power that he hadn’t released.

Compared to Yu Muchen, who has already shown all his strength, he was more dangerous.

“Yes.”

Lin Xiu nodded.

“Okay, we, master and apprentice, let’s kill these two arrogant guys from Sky City!”

Saying this, Baili Haoling’s expression in her eyes became even more bloodthirsty, and when her legs moved, she rushed out with a swish!

At the same time, Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and attacked Nan Huang!

At the moment when the spear was stabbed, a large amount of black matter appeared from the spear, and then turned into a black giant dragon and stabbed towards the Nan Huang!

“Insignificant skill!”

Nan Huang roared, and the spear burst out with purple lightning, like a dragon and snake. Following his attack, he also rushed towards Lin Xiu!

The purple lightning flashed like thunder snakes dancing wildly, directly piercing the black giant dragon and slamming into Lin Xiu’s body!

Nan Huang originally thought that Lin Xiu would be stunned by the purple electric light, but what he didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu was not affected at all, and continued to attack his body with the spear in his hand!

How is this possible!?

The look in Nan Huang’s eyes changed greatly when he noticed this scene. At this time, the black dragon released by Lin Xiu opened its mouth wide and bit his body!

Nan Huang wanted to escape, but the black dragon continued to bite towards him as if it had eyes.

In the next moment, it bit Nan Huang’s body firmly.

Good chance!

‘When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the entire Dark Edge spear was filled with dark red flames. He jumped up and stabbed Nan Huang, who was bitten by the black dragon, and seemed unable to move!

‘Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall!

Under Lin Xiu’s strength, the power of this golden skill was terrifying.

Looking at Lin Xiu’s charging like a meteor falling from the sky, Nan Huang’s eyes widened, and a powerful force instantly surged out of his body.

His whole body seems to have started to change, his height has become a little taller, and his muscles have become more swollen.

“Get lost!!!”

Nan Huang roared loudly, and the black dragon was directly impacted by his powerful force, turning into a black mist and disappearing.

Looking at Lin Xiu who was rushing down, he didn’t dodge. At this moment, the weapon in his hand stabbed straight into the sky!

“End of an era’

He roared loudly, and the long spear in his hand burst into a golden light, directly colliding with Lin Xiu, who stabbed down with the spear from the air!

The two powerful forces collided together, instantly causing a gust of wind to blow around.

Boom–

In the end, Lin Xiu’s body flew out first, and after taking many steps back, Lin Xiu stomped on the ground.

His chest was tight, his throat was sweet, and he vomited out a mouthful of blood.

“Die!”

But Nan Huang didn’t stop at all, holding the incomparably sharp long spear in his hand, activated his body skill and his whole body rushed towards Lin Xiu like a ghost.

In an instant, he appeared in front of Lin Xiu!

Swoosh—

The spear stabbed Lin Xiu in the head, and there was an instant sound of breaking through the air.

Lin Xiu’s pupils shrank, his head moved instinctively and the shot was dodged by Lin Xiu.

After a small tuft of hair fell off.

Just a little bit more and Lin Xiu would get a headshot!
