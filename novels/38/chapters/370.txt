Chapter 371: The Identity of the Old Man

There was a white light in the middle of the alien ore.

What was this?!

Seeing this, there was a hint of surprise in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

Was there still something in it!?

Bang–

At this time, as the old man threw away the rest of the alien ore and after taking out the object in the middle, one could see the jade-like thing that had a white glow.

This…is the real alien ore!?

“This is the essence of this ore. If you use this thing to forge your weapon, I believe it will make your weapon more powerful.” At this time, the old man said while tossing the ore to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu saw this and caught the item instinctively.

As Lin Xiu caught the jade-like stone, he felt a warm and moist feeling.

Taking a closer look, this thing looked like jade, emitting a faint light from the inside to the outside.

This thing was not big, it was an oval shape, smaller than a palm.

Lin Xiu was surprised when he saw this, then put it into his pocket quickly.

Because Lin Xiu heard the sound of footsteps getting closer.

“Do not move!”

With a clattering sound, a number of soldiers from the Deep Blue City rushed in with advanced laser guns.

The black gun muzzles pointed directly at Lin Xiu and others.

“Take them all down!”

At this time, a middle-aged man who walked in with a huge weapon in a battle suit bellowed.

But as soon as he ordered, he looked inside and his expression changed.

“Xia…Elder Xia.” He looked at the old man over there and his body and lips trembled.

The rest of the soldiers wanted to take the old man down, but they didn’t expect that their leader would appear so shocked when he saw the old man.

“You simply brought people into the branch building of our Sacred Region Academy?”

The old man known as Elder Xia looked at them with a strange smile and said aloud.

Seeing his smile, the body of the man who seemed to be very powerful at this time couldn’t help but tremble.

“I’m very sorry, we are looking for the thieves.” At this time, cold sweat started to flow down the middle-aged man’s forehead.

Although he knew that this was a branch of the Sacred Region Academy and it would be a little troublesome, he never thought that this old man would be here!

One must know that in the Huaxia area, no one dares to offend him!

“I have taken care of it.” Elder Xia brushed his sleeves at this time, then said faintly.

As soon as he said that, the rest of the soldiers looked at the people in black lying on the ground with their hands and feet folded into a twisted state.

The middle-aged man looked around at this time, as if he was looking for something.

“Here.” Elder Xia seemed to know what he was looking for. At this moment, he looked at him and said aloud.

Hearing Elder Xia’s words, he looked to the front and suddenly saw the two alien ores on the ground.

Found it!

Seeing this, his eyes lit up and he hurried over.

But what he didn’t expect was that at this time, the alien ore had been broken into two pieces for unknown reasons.

What exactly is going on!?

“They broke it.” Old Xia stared at him, then said directly.

Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched when he heard the old man lying without batting his lids.

But he couldn’t say anything at this time, after all, the alien ore was now with him.

And with the improvement of his current strength, the weight and sharpness of his Dark Edge Spear couldn’t satisfy him anymore.

If he continued to forge it with the materials, the Dark Edge Spear would probably be upgraded again.

The middle-aged man nodded. At this time, he didn’t expect the old man to lie and he picked up the alien ore.

Although this alien ore broke into two halves, its body still exudes a lot of faint blue light.

In addition to the object in the middle of the alien ore, the remaining things were also very useful.

“Why is it a little empty in the middle?” The middle-aged man said while holding the alien ore that was broken into two pieces.

He seemed a little confused at this time, but he didn’t think much.

“Maybe it’s originally like that.”

At this time, there was a voice from the other side. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Lin Xiu looked to the front and saw Zeng Ruo.

“Well, it’s possible.” The middle-aged man nodded, then took the thing and put it into the box on the ground.

“Take them all away!” He glanced at the men in black on the ground and said suddenly.

“Yes!”

As soon as he said that, the men in black who fell on the ground were carried away by these soldiers.

“Brother Lin and Miss Luo, you guys are here too?” Zeng Ruo happened to see Luo Yue and Lin Xiu and said, a little surprised at this time.

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu nodded, but Luo Yue was still the same as usual, seeming a little cold.

Lin Xiu was not surprised.

At this time, Lin Xiu looked towards the front and suddenly saw the middle-aged man holding the box, looking at the alien ore inside, as if he was still a little confused.

Seeing this, Lin Xiu suddenly choked, wondering if he would realize that something was wrong.

But when Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief, he closed the box directly and followed the soldiers to the top of the building and left.

“Tomorrow we can leave, right?” Lin Xiu looked at Zeng Ruo and said aloud.

“Of course you can.” Zeng Ruo nodded, then smiled.

“Zeng Ruo, hurry up.” At the same time, there was a sound from the safe passage.

“Coming.” Zeng Ruo responded.

“I’ll get going now and you are welcome to come and stay in the Deep Blue City in the future.” Zeng Ruo looked at Lin Xiu at this time, then smiled and said aloud.

“En, goodbye.” Lin Xiu nodded and said aloud as if nothing had happened.

As he left, Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief, then looked at the old man and said, “Those people were taken away, would they…”
