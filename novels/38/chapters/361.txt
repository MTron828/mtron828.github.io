Chapter 362: Luo Yue’s Little Bear

‘What is this!?’

Lin Xiu was taken aback, then looked inside and found that there was a huge area inside.

There was a tall rockery and hot spring water that was constantly flowing into the pool.

He looked into the pool and saw a familiar figure.

Luo Yue?!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened. Luo Yue’s hair was completely drenched and draped over her shoulders.

Under her neck, Lin Xiu could clearly see the delicate collarbone and fair tender skin that was not covered by the hot spring pool.

At this time, there was a folded white face towel on top of Luo Yue’s head and she looked very cute.

“I…I lost my way!” When Lin Xiu saw this, he felt like he was about to have a nosebleed.

But after thinking about the consequences, Lin Xiu still called out. Just as he was about to run away, he heard Luo Yue’s voice, “Stop.”

Lin Xiu was taken aback, then looked towards Luo Yue.

There were a lot of petals on the water, which concealed what was below the water, but even so, Lin Xiu still found Luo Yue very attractive.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Xiu swallowed and asked.

Lin Xiu had a feeling that something was wrong because Luo Yue still didn’t have any expression on her face so Lin Xiu wasn’t sure if she was mad.

It was possible for her to fly into rage out of humiliation and chase him with her long sword.

“Would you like to have a soak?” Luo Yue said indifferently and there was no sign of nervousness in her tone.

She was expressionless too.

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu opened his mouth wide and his face was full of shock.

She… She asked him to soak in the water with her?

This is unbelievable, right?

“Just leave if you don’t want to.” Lin Xiu was still in shock when Luo Yue glanced at him and saw that all the fog was flowing out of the place, lowering the temperature of the whole room Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Yes!”

Lin Xiu closed the door at this time then strode over.

“Go over there and get changed.” Luo Yue said lightly.

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu looked to the side and saw a small room in the front.

He walked to the room and saw a robe inside.

Luo Yue, who was outside, didn’t have any expression on her face, but she seemed to have remembered something suddenly. When she turned to the small room and found that Lin Xiu had already walked in!

At this moment, Luo Yue’s cheeks suddenly became red and it seemed to show… a shy expression!?

If Lin Xiu saw this scene, he would definitely be surprised.

“Didn’t expect there to be a hot spring here…”

Lin Xiu was about to change into the bathrobe in the small room, but at this moment, he found that there seemed to be other clothes on the drying rack over there.

“Eh?”

Lin Xiu looked over there and suddenly saw Luo Yue’s clothes, vest, and a pair of white…small underwear?

Pfff——

Seeing this, Lin Xiu immediately covered his nose and felt like his nose was about to bleed.

“Useless, it’s just underwear.” Lin Xiu took a deep breath at this time and said.

But this was Luo Yue, the cold chick… and there was a little bear on top of the white underwear, smiling at him.

Lin Xiu’s blood was surging initially but when he saw the little bear, he couldn’t help laughing.

“Ahahahaha!!!”

Lin Xiu suddenly covered his stomach and laughed loudly.

Thinking of Luo Yue’s cold expression in contrast with this little bear, Lin Xiu laughed till he almost had a stomachache.

Luo Yue, who was outside, was blushing. She was taken aback when she heard Lin Xiu’s laughter inside and clenched her fists in the water.

After a while, Lin Xiu changed his bathrobe and walked out to the pool.

He walked to the side of the pool, looked towards Luo Yue, and saw her looking at him blankly.

“Ahem.” Lin Xiu changed his expression awkwardly, then jumped directly in from the edge of the pool.

As soon as he entered the pond, a warmth came over his body.

The temperature in the pool was just right and Lin Xiu felt very comfortable.

However, Lin Xiu still felt an unkind look staring at him, which made his body, which had been very warm and comfortable, cold.

Lin Xiu, opened his eyes and saw Luo Yue who was across him, staring at him, her eyes full of coldness.

“Ahem, what’s the matter.” Lin Xiu asked, a little embarrassed.

“You saw it?” Luo Yue stared at Lin Xiu then said coldly.

Saw it?

“Saw what?” Lin Xiu asked then looked at Luo Yue and suddenly recalled something.

Could it be…

“Ahahaha… oh…” Lin Xiu couldn’t help laughing when he thought of Luo Yue’s cold look and the very contrasting little bear underwear.

But seeing Luo Yue’s murderous eyes, Lin Xiu hurriedly covered his mouth.

“I didn’t see anything.” After holding back his laughter forcibly, Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue seriously.

“Do you think I’ll believe you?” Luo Yue snorted coldly then said aloud.

“I promise I really didn’t see that little bear…” Just as Lin Xiu blurted out, he knew he was in trouble.

“Go to hell!!!”

Luo Yue flew into a rage at this time then stood up directly, waved her right hand and a long sword flew directly into her hand.

And at this moment, she stood up from the pool.

Damn!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened when he saw this scene. When he thought he could feast his eyes, he found that Luo Yue’s body was tightly wrapped in a bathrobe and this bathrobe wasn’t translucent after being soaked in water.

Lin Xiu jumped out of the water and ran outside without looking back when he saw Luo Yue lifting the sword and attacking him.

“I didn’t mean it!” Lin Xiu said aloud as he ran.

Just as Lin Xiu ran out, he heard something outside.

“Alert! The whole city is on full alert!”
