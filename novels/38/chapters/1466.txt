1467 Weak Water and Flame of chaos

A huge phantom of the long sword directly charged toward Lin Xiu at this moment!

Looking at this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly.

Holding the spear in both hands, he was about to block the blow.

Boom——

But the power of this blow was really too strong. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Lin Xiu’s entire body was pressed down and fell straight down.

Poof——

As his body fell, Lin Xiu also spat out a mouthful of blood.

Although he forcibly received the blow, he still felt the pressure of an incomparably powerful force.

It hurts too much.

Whoosh whoosh——

At this time, Huangfu Yuanshen in the sky continued to dance the long sword in his hand, continuously releasing a large amount of crescent-shaped sword aura, and charged towards Lin Xiu below.

These sword auras were different from the sword aura of ordinary god kings.

Not only has it become substantive, but it is also very powerful.

Lin Xiu, who was hit by the impact, kept waving the spear in his hand.

Trying to resist this attack.

Bang bang bang——

But this attack was really too powerful.

It was so shocking that Lin Xiu’s hands holding the spear felt severe pain.

He also spat out blood.

This guy’s current strength was simply too powerful.

If the fight continues like this, there is no way to win, and Lin Xiu may even die!

Huangfu Yuanshen stretched out his left hand, and a large amount of energy gathered in the palm of his left hand.

These energies are terrifying, and the space around the energies begins to distort.

go!

At the next moment, the gathered energy suddenly burst into a powerful energy shock wave.

Following the impact of this powerful energy shock wave, it immediately hit Lin Xiu’s body.

Boom——

At this moment, an incomparably loud sound erupted.

The entire ground shook crazily in an instant.

The entire area with a radius of a hundred miles was affected.

It vibrated crazily.

At this moment, the surrounding mountains began to crumble.

“Ahem…”

At this time, Luo Yue’s body also slowly climbed out from the mountain range not far away.

She was in a bad state.

There was also a lot of blood flowing from her mouth.

At this time, Luo Yue was also seriously injured.

But she still struggled to stand up and walk to the other side.

Damn…

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s body was also struggling.

The attack by Huangfu Yuanshen just now was really terrifying.

The ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfold burst immediately.

There was also blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.

He laid on the ground.

“That’s all.”

At this moment, Ling Tianxi, at some point, also walked over from the other side.

Looking at Lin Xiu, she suddenly laughed out loud.

She also looked very tired.

At this time, holding the long sword in her hand, she walked up to Lin Xiu.

“Flame of chaos, right? Even Weak Water can’t deal with me!”

She roared, and the long sword in her hand was immediately covered with a lot of weak water.

The next moment, she stabbed Lin Xiu!

boom–

But the next moment, Lin Xiu’s hand directly grasped the long sword she stabbed.

Boom——

At this time, Lin Xiu’s entire body burst into Flame of chaos!

The weak water on her sword was directly evaporated, and this long sword also turned red and then melted away!

This is impossible!

She watched this scene, her eyes widened.
