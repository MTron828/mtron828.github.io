Chapter 520: Rank 7 Evolved Beast – Unicorn Thunder Cow

Koong Loong – –

At that moment, another lightning bolt fell from the sky.

And it directly landed on Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu widened his eyes in surprise as his body shook.

This lightning was much more powerful than the one before which was why Lin Xiu’s body started twitching and he could feel the sharp pain across his body as well.

Luo Yue came back to her senses as well when the lightning struck. She was blushing but still managed to move backward and dodge the lightning.

“You should stay here and continue with your cultivation.” Luo Yue said towards Lin Xiu who just got struck by lightning.

With that said, she sat on the ground with her legs folded and started cultivating as well after activating ‘Cultivation Technique’.

Lin Xiu looked at the sky helplessly, then gritted his teeth and said, “Damn lightning!”

Koong loong – –

As Lin Xiu cursed at the sky, another lightning came shooting down from the sky above.

Lin Xiu, who was originally standing, suddenly laid down on the ground after being struck.

The thunder and lightning in the Thunder Valley was extremely terrifying. If it was an ordinary person, they would have been completely scorched to death.

But for Lin Xiu, he would only sustain very minimal injuries.

Plus, the energy from the lightning would be easily absorbed by ‘Engulf’ in his system and changed into EXP. Plus, the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ that he had cultivated earlier needed the additional energy to help strengthen his body.

This time, Lin Xiu did not dodge the lightning that was coming towards him. Instead, he ran towards the place where the lightning would land so that he would be struck by it.

While he was bearing the lightning, Lin Xiu immediately removed the Silver Leopard Armour that he had been wearing.

This way, his skin would be able to be in direct contact with the lightning.

The lightning here appeared very frequently which was what made it a dangerous place to be and so, there weren’t many warriors who would be in these areas.

Time passed quickly, and before he knew it, Lin Xiu had been cultivating here for more than a day.

The next morning, Lin Xiu was still bearing the lightning that struck and he could clearly feel that as the lightning struck him now, it wouldn’t affect his body as bad as before. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He only felt a slight numb all over his body.

Plus, the amount of energy that his skill– ‘Engulf’ has absorbed from the lightning has been reduced.

“Let’s go somewhere else.” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue who was sitting on the other side and was closing the ‘Cultivation Technique’ practice.

When she heard Lin Xiu calling for her, Luo Yue immediately opened her eyes and stared at Lin Xiu. Then, she attacked Lin Xiu with her fist!

Lin Xiu was stunned. Before he could react, Luo Yue’s fist was already on his cheek.

“Fight me.” Luo Yus said to Lin Xiu.

After hearing what Luo Yue said, Lin Xiu quickly reacted as told.

“Alright. Let’s train together.” Lin Xiu was excited as well. He quickly moved and started attacking Luo Yue!

Xiu Xiu Xiu – –

Luo Yue’s reflexes were very quick as well. As soon as Lin Xiu threw the punch, she managed to move backward, dodging his attack.

Plus, after dodging the attack, she immediately attacked Lin Xiu’s back!

The both of them fought relentlessly and they were moving at a very fast speed.

Boom Boom Boom – –

There were explosions that rang continuously and the explosive energy that was coming from their punches was incredibly terrifying.

In the end, both of their fists collided and with the strong impact that it created, they retreated backward.

“Looks like we’re evenly matched.” Lin Xiu laughed as he said.

Luo Yue nodded her head and she was shocked as well.

She was already a rank 7 warrior while Lin Xiu was just a rank 6 warrior but his close combat skills were of a similar level as hers.

His growth was absolutely terrifying.

Lin Xiu was feeling excited as well. His cultivation for the day had been effective because Lin Xiu could clearly feel his body being much tougher than before.

“Put on your clothes.” Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu and reminded him before turning around.

Lin Xiu was stunned. He took a good look at himself and realized that he was naked since he had removed the combat suit earlier in order to cultivate better.

As he looked at Luo Yue, Lin Xiu thought to himself, ‘Was she being shy?’

That’s impossible.

The Thunder Valley was huge and Lin Xiu had no idea where he was. When he took out his phone, he realized that all of the signals had been blocked.

This situation was similar to the Dark Forest. There must be something that affected the signals.

The aircraft that flew past these areas would probably be affected as well.

Roar – –

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue walked to their next destination when they heard a loud roar coming from the path ahead of them.

An evolved beast?!

Lin Xiu was surprised. It has already been one day since they entered the Thunder Valley but Lin Xiu has not met a single evolved beast.

He didn’t think that he would hear such a loud roar here.

Lin Xiu raised his brows and grabbed onto Dark Edge.

“Help!” Then, they heard a loud cry.

Soon, there was a huge figure that appeared before them.

This was a huge creature that had the head of a cow with the body completely covered with green scales. In the middle of its head, there was a large, sharp pointing horn.

The body of the evolved beast was huge as well; almost like a hill.

At the same time, there were a few warriors who were running towards Lin Xiu and all of them looked frightened.

Lin Xiu didn’t even bother looking at the warriors. Instead, he was more interested in the evolved beast and immediately turned on his ‘Analytic Eye’.

[Rank 7 evolved Unicorn Thunder Cow. Huge body and powerful. Characteristics: Rage after being injured. Increases Strength.]

Rank 7?

“Crap!” Some of the warriors fell onto the ground when they reached Lin Xiu as they had been running for a long time.

As they fell to the ground, they no longer had the strength to stand up.

“Save me!” One of the warriors looked at Lin Xiu and screamed.

Although Lin Xiu looked like a young man, they had no other choice.

“We know where the space crack is!”

One of the warriors screamed in fear.

After hearing what they said, Lin Xiu reconsidered his options but before he could say a word, the Unicorn Thunder Cow was already coming towards them!

It was about to crush the warriors that were on the ground!

“Move!” Lin Xiu rushed forward when he saw what was about to happen. He raised his spear and used it as a javelin, propelling himself into the air. Then, he kicked the creature right in the head!
