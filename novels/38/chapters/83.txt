Chapter 84: On The Road

The man closed his eyes when he saw the Silverclaw Black Bear pouncing towards him.

But the pain that he anticipated did not come. Instead, he heard a loud growl.

The man opened his eyes to see a young man standing in front of him.

His fist had landed on the Silverclaw Black Bear’s head.

The Silverclaw Black Bear that looked extremely ferocious seemed to be stuck.

In the next second as Lin Xiu removed his fist, the Silverclaw Black Bear started falling.

With a bang, the rank 2 evolved beast fell to the ground with its heavy body and produced a loud sound.

“Seems like I have enough strength to deal with a rank 2 evolved beast.” Lin Xiu waved his fist and muttered to himself.

Of course, Lin Xiu’s attack was only successful because the evolved beast was aiming at the man.

“Thank… thank you.” The man heaved a sigh of relief and expressed his gratitude.

Lin Xiu ignored him and looked on the ground. The Silverclaw Black Bear’s head had exploded apart.

He found the Odd Crystal.

Lin Xiu squatted down and took the Odd Crystal out. He shrugged the Odd Crystal and removed the blood from it.

He then placed it into his bag.

The man’s eyes lit up when he saw the numerous Odd Crystals in Lin Xiu’s bag.

“Hello, I’m Lei Liang!” The man took the initiative to talk to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu looked at the man and nodded his head. “I’m Lin Xiu.”

“Brother, are you going to Black Sea City?” Lei Liang smiled and asked.

While saying that, he secretly sized Lin Xiu up. ‘From the way Lin Xiu had killed the rank 2 Silverclaw Black Bear with one punch, he should be a rank 1 warrior?’

‘No, the aura from his body seems weak, a quasi-warrior?’

“You’re heading there too?” Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows and asked.

“That’s right, seems like you’re going there for the warrior qualification test, right?” Lei Liang continued.

Lin Xiu nodded his head. The man called Lei Liang in front of him should at least be a rank 1 warrior.

Right at this time, footsteps sounded from the side. Lin Xiu turned to look and saw three men dressed in battle robes and carrying large bags.

They also wielded sabers in their hands.

“Lei Liang, are you alright?” One of them asked.

“I’m fine.” Lei Liang shook his head and introduced them, “This brother here is Lin Xiu. He is heading to Black Sea City as well, he just saved my life.”

When they heard Lei Liang’s words, they immediately turned to look at Lin Xiu.

“Wow.”

“They are Zhang Zhimin, Yang Lin, and Wu Xiu.” Lei Liang introduced them to Lin Xiu.

“Zeze, Lei Liang, how can you be beaten by a rank 2 evolved beast to this extent?” The man at the side mocked him.

“Pei, if not for the fact that I became weaker after killing that evolved beast, I would have gotten rid of it,” Lei Liang replied with indignance.

“Brat, since you’re going to participate in the warrior test, let us go together.” They turned and smiled at Lin Xiu. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

They seemed extremely cordial.

Lin Xiu nodded his head. He did not mind moving with them since he was wearing the heavy weights, his fighting ability was weakened, and he might be in danger if he encountered an evolved beast stronger than him.

But Lin Xiu remained cautious as he felt something wrong with the men.

“Crack, crack.”

Right then, the android wolf walked over to Lin Xiu. The group was stunned by the sight of the android wolf.

“Lin Xiu, where did you buy that? How cool. It’s better than a maglev car.” Zhang Zhimin walked over with a smile as though they were very familiar.

“From the web,” Lin Xiu replied indifferently and did not explain further.

“Alright, let’s go. The test is in five days’ time. If we don’t move now, we might not make it.” Lei Liang laughed and said.

He walked ahead and picked up a double-bladed ax that he dropped before.

Lin Xiu did not ride on the android wolf and walked slowly.

He had kept Tang Mubai’s sword in a special compartment inside the android wolf.

Soon after, he saw the figure of a man standing beneath a tree and eating a red apple.

“Kid, time to go!” Yang Lin shouted to the figure.

Upon hearing Yang Lin’s words, he turned over.

He was a young man of similar age to Lin Xiu with long hair that reached up to his fair neck. He also had a unique aura from his body.

Instead of a sword or an ordinary saber, he wielded a pair of long sabers that hung by his waist.

A dual wielder?

“Oh.” The young man nodded his head then munched on the red apple while revealing a satisfied look.

“We also encountered him on the road, everyone here is heading to Black Sea City, but we don’t know his name,” Lei Liang whispered to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded his head, the group were roughly rank 1 warriors, but the sudden appearance of the youth made Lin Xiu suspicious. He felt that the young man was extremely powerful.

The group headed on and gradually discovered bones.

They continued to move deeper and as they did, more and more bones appeared.

“Here, it’s strange.” Wu Xiu was a slightly chubby man that wielded a large chopper. He frowned and commented as he looked around.

“Rank 2 man-eating birds, they are evolved beasts that live together. Carnivorous bird-type evolved beasts that attack humans,” Lin Xiu replied indifferently while walking ahead.

“How do you know that? Maybe it’s a carnivorous evolved beast that roams the land.” Yang Lin was a skinny man and sneered while glancing at Lin Xiu.

He tightened his grip on his weapon as though he was rather anxious.
