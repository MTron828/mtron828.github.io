Chapter 618: Intelligence X Revenge!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

After Lin Xiu had just walked in and strolled around, a middle-aged man with a small beard said enthusiastically to Lin Xiu.

Compared with the indifference of the other businessmen, this person was so enthusiastic that Lin Xiu felt a little weird.

“No need.”

“Skill cards, battle suits, etc., we have them all here!”

The middle-aged man took out a stack of skill cards from under his booth at this time, and some battle suits as he gestured towards Lin Xiu.

“No need.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

“Then you…”…

“Information.”

Lin Xiu was silent for a while, then lowered his voice, looked at him and said.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the expression of this middle-aged man who looked very enthusiastic suddenly changed slightly.

The smile on his cheeks instantly converged, and instead it became extremely serious.

“First time?”

“First time.”

Lin Xiu replied indifferently.

The man looked at Lin Xiu for a while, then looked around, and said to a man not far away, “Ah Hei, tend the stall for me!”

“OK.”

The man made an OK gesture to the middle-aged man.

“Come here.”

The middle-aged man said to Lin Xiu at this time.

“En.”

He followed the middle-aged man into an alley in front of him, and soon, he entered a small room that looked a bit historical.

“Just go inside, I’ll wait for you here.”

After walking in, the middle-aged man gestured to one of the rooms.

Although Lin Xiu was a little puzzled, he nodded and walked in directly.

There was not much space inside. There was a table in the middle. On the opposite side of the table, there was a person wearing a black hood and mask, only showing a pair of eyes.

“Sit.”

This man spoke to Lin Xiu in a hoarse voice.

Lin Xiu was not nervous at all, and sat down directly.

“”What’s your question.”

“People.”

Lin Xiu said lightly. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Speak.”

The man’s words were also very concise.

“Sky City Jiang’s family, Jiang Feng.” Lin Xiu said this, his eyes narrowed, and an uncontrollable murderous aura came out of his body.

According to the information obtained before, this person was the leader who killed his parents.

“Sorry, we refuse to provide this information.”

After hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the man shook his head and said.

“Why?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows, and then said lightly.

“If there is nothing else, you can leave.” He didn’t answer Lin Xiu’s words directly, but continued speaking in that hoarse voice.

It seemed that the Jiang family has a certain status in Sky City...

“Besides him, I have other questions.”

Lin Xiu did not leave but continued to speak.

This person looked at Lin Xiu, and then spit out a word: “Speak.”

“Dong family Dong Qian, Chen family Chen Yue’er...”

Lin Xiu directly reported the names of those who participated in the hunting and killing incident.

Hearing the names of these people, the man’s eyes rolled, and he seemed to be thinking about something.

“Information can be provided.”

In the next moment, he said lightly.

“Payment, fifty million.”

“Fifty million?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows. He just earned 100 million by working so hard over there. If half of it is gone, it would be a little heart pain.

“Yes or no.”

The man didn’t say any nonsense, and continued to speak.

“Yes.”

Lin Xiu raised his eyes and nodded.

“Haha, Young Master Dong, your racing skills are getting stronger and stronger!”

At the same time, somewhere in Sky City, several young men were driving the latest maglev cars and racing frantically.

Stopping at the corner in front.

“Nonsense, this is the latest car.” The man known as Young master Dong said with a big smile.

“However, it seems like I bumped into someone just now...”

The man looked behind him and saw a man lying on the ground with a lot of blood beside him.

It seems that he knocked and killed him when he was racing.

“Just ask someone to deal with it, what’s the fuss about.”

At this moment, Young master Shao took out an electronic cigarette and took a puff, puffing out the clouds.

The rest of the people didn’t react at all, they were all very indifferent, and they seemed to be used to it.

“Are you Dong Qian?”

At this moment, a voice came from the other side.

Hearing this voice, the men who were wrangling and laughing in the car all looked to the side.

It was a man dressed in black, carrying a weapon wrapped in a white cloth behind his back, with a black mask on his face.

“Who the hell are you, dare to call my Brother Dong’s name like that?”

A man’s expression changed at this moment, and then he took out a laser gun directly from his car and shot at Lin Xiu.

Boom–

But this laser ray did not penetrate his body directly, and a red circular barrier appeared instantly, blocking the laser ray instantly.

The circular barrier also disappeared instantly.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and stared at him.

The man suddenly felt cold all over his body, his fingers went a little soft, and he didn’t seem to have the strength to pull the trigger.

Such a strong murderous aura!

The man who was shooting with the laser gun opened his eyes wide as if he was frightened by Lin Xiu’s look.

“Who are you?”

At this time, Dong Qian also frowned, then stood up, looked at Lin Xiu, and said lightly.

“Thirteen years ago, in Xingyao City, did you kill a young couple?”

Lin Xiu looked at him, and then said lightly.

“Oh? Seeking revenge?”

Dong Qian quickly reacted, looking at Lin Xiu with a smile on the corner of his mouth.

“I’ve killed too many people. Who are you talking about? I’m sorry, I can’t remember.”

Dong Qian shrugged and said.

“Then go to hell!”

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly, and the next moment, he rushed over in an instant!

Swoosh—

Like a shadow, he instantly stood at the front of the car and rushed in front of Dong Qian!

What a fast speed!

Dong Qian did not expect that Lin Xiu would have such a terrifying speed, but he was a peak rank 7 warrior, and he has practiced top-level movement techniques.

But before he could heave a sigh of relief, he found that Lin Xiu had appeared on the other side.

And at this time, Lin Xiu was already waving his fist full of electricity toward his body!

“Sphere!!!”

Dong Qian roared.
