1358 Fake Death

As Lu Guangyue yelled, the warriors around also gritted their teeth and continued to unleash their most powerful skills.

Boom, boom, boom——

Following the release of the powerful skills, all kinds of forces immediately bombarded the Netherworld Unicorn’s body.

At this time, Lin Xiu also waved his fist in the air, transforming into a huge fire fist to attack the Netherworld Unicorn.

!!

Under the attack of so many warriors, the Netherworld Unicorn’s body began to crumble the next moment.

Boom——

After Lin Xiu slammed his fist on its head again, there was an extremely loud sound.

Its body, at this moment, directly fell down.

At this moment, there was a loud thud.

“It’s over.”

Looking at this scene, Lu Guangyue couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief.

This Netherworld Unicorn was really too strong. It took so long for so many warriors to kill it.

Taking a closer look, among the people who were still flying in the air, including himself, there were only ten people left.

The original team of twenty people has now become a team of ten people.

“Go, go down and dig out its odd crystal!”

A warrior with blood on his head growled and said at this moment.

This Netherworld Unicorn was really too difficult to kill. Now that he has finally killed it, he can’t wait to dig out its odd crystal!

“Wait!”

When Lin Xiu heard the man’s words, he immediately said.

This Netherworld Unicorn was not dead yet.

As soon as Lin Xiu spoke, the faces of the surrounding warriors were full of surprise.

“Not dead? How is it possible?”

They tried killing this Netherworld Unicorn for so long and finally killed it, but now Lin Xiu said that it is not dead yet!

Everyone could not believe it.

“This is impossible! Don’t try to fool me!”

One of the men holding a saber snorted coldly at this moment, then flew straight down!

When the rest of the people saw his movements, their expressions changed immediately and they also scrambled to fly down.

Looking at their actions, it seems that they want to snatch the odd crystal and the horn of the Netherworld Unicorn!

“That’s mine!”

Seeing this scene, Lu Guangyue’s face suddenly became ugly.

These warriors seemed to be getting out of control at this time.

“Do you guys still want the rewards!”

Lu Guangyue looked at those warriors ignoring him and his face became even more gloomy.

He was injured when he fought the Netherworld Unicorn just now and he has no way to fight with them at this moment.

These warriors ignored Lu Guangyue’s words.

They had already confirmed that the Netherworld Unicorn’s value was very high.

As long as you snatch its odd crystal and its horn, you can ask for a price!

“I said, it’s not dead yet.”

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help showing a sneer at the corner of his mouth.

If he didn’t have the system, he would definitely think that the Netherworld Unicorn was dead when he saw the scene just now.

But with the system’s existence and the fact that he landed the final blow himself, once the Netherworld Unicorn is truly dead, he should receive a notification from the system

But there wasn’t any!

“this is mine!”

One of the warriors was already holding the saber in his hand.

He rushed to the head of the Netherworld Unicorn and wanted to slash the Netherworld Unicorn’s head directly.

boom–

With an extremely loud sound, the head of the Netherworld Unicorn was not split in half as imagined.

Instead, the man’s body was directly pierced by the claws of the Netherworld Unicorn!

“This is impossible…”

He looked at his pierced body and his eyes widened.

His eyes were full of disbelief.

The Netherworld Unicorn, which was clearly dead, opened its eyes again at this moment.

When the rest of the warriors saw this scene, their eyes were filled with shock.

Roar–

...

And at this moment, the Netherworld Unicorn let out an incomparably loud roar.

At this time, Lin Xiu and Lu Guangyue covered their ears.

Following his roar, the ground shook crazily and the wind swelled violently.

The warriors who approached this Netherworld Unicorn were so shaken that their eardrums burst!

“ah!!!”

Wailings and screamings rang out immediately.

At this time, the Netherworld Unicorn seized the opportunity, quickly got up, opened its mouth wide, and began to bite at those warriors.

In an instant, two or three warriors were directly bitten off.

When the remaining warriors saw this scene, their eyes were full of fear.

They never thought that this Netherworld Unicorn would come back to life like this!

No, it’s not dead at all!!!

...

At this time, the Netherworld Unicorn, with its eyes the size of copper bells, was staring at the remaining warriors.

Its mouth opened wide and suddenly a large amount of energy frantically gathered towards its mouth.

“run!!!”

When these warriors saw this scene, their faces were filled with horror.

With a loud roar, they were about to flee.

But at this time, it’s too late!

The terrifying energy in the mouth of the Netherworld Unicorn was directly sprayed out!

At this time, these warriors instinctively unfolded the ‘Sphere’ to resist.

But after going through the battle just now, they had consumed too much source strength in their bodies.

The ‘Sphere’ that they unfolded at this time could not resist the attack at all.

Boom——

The ‘Spheres’ of these warriors exploded directly.

Under the impact of those terrifying energies, their bodies immediately turned into white bones. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“All… are dead…”

Seeing this scene, Lu Guangyue seemed to be stunned for a moment.

Just now, they thought they had already killed the Netherworld Unicorn, but they didn’t expect that this Netherworld Unicorn actually knew how to fake its death!

“Go!”

And at this time, the Netherworld Unicorn on the ground saw Lin Xiu and Lu Guangyue in the air and immediately let out another loud roar.

Crackling——

At this moment, a large number of electric lights were surrounding its horn.

“It’s going crazy!”

Lu Guangyue clearly felt the Netherworld Unicorn below, bursting out with a large amount of powerful electrical energy.

Many powerful evolved beasts will retain a certain amount of power during battle, then burst out when facing the threat of death.

This Netherworld Unicorn seems to be no exception.

These electric lights bursting out from its unicorn seem to be even more terrifying!
