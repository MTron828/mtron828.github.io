1375 Tianmen City’s Opening!

Everything that happened earlier was only a minor hiccup.

As everyone continued walking forward, it was soon noticeable that there were many of them here.

Warriors from all 9 states were gathered here in this city!

“There’s so many of them…”

!!

Lin Xiu looked at the wide street and he was shocked.

It was packed with lots of powerful warrior gods and there were even some who were on drones.

“Well, this is the Warrior God City.”

Xiao Qingchen smiled when he saw the scene before him.

Seeing how there were so many warriors got him excited.

“Tianmen City…” Yuan Zheng looked into the distance as he muttered to himself.

Tianman City is a place that only opens once every twenty years and it is said that there are ancient ruins in it.

Most of the younger generations would like to find something for themselves.

“Let’s hurry! We have to get the best spot or else, we would only be able to enter last.”

Xiao Qingchen stared at the warriors around him and told the other two about it.

“We have to pick our spots?”

Lin Xiu was stunned. Although he did not understand what that meant, he still followed Xiao Qingchen’s quick footsteps.

Yuan Zheng did the same as well.

As they got closer to the front, Lin Xiu saw a huge piece of empty land that had no buildings on it.

There were lots of warriors standing on the empty land.

Most were sitting cross-legged on the ground, cultivating.

As for the ground, it seemed to be made of a special type of rock.

There were mysterious runes written all over it.

Most of them who were riding on their rides soon got back onto the ground.

Then, all of them sat down in an orderly fashion.

“The Tianmen City will be opened here.”

Xiao Qingchen looked around and informed the other two.

“Find a good spot first.”

All three of them got to the front and picked up a spot each.

Lin Xiu could now feel that the air was filled with rich energy. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

If he was allowed to cultivate here, he would definitely progress much faster.

Lin Xiu looked around and noticed how packed it was.

He was trying to look for Luo Yue but he couldn’t find her.

Perhaps….she isn’t here?

Lin Xiu felt a little disappointed.

This should be the biggest event here at Warrior God Realm.

Logically speaking, Luo Yue would have been a warrior god by now and if she was, it didn’t make sense if she didn’t come here.

At the same time, in one of the states in Warrior God Realm. Luo Yue was standing on top of her long sword along with a few other girls.

“Would we be able to make it in time?”

Some of the other girls around Luo Yue started discussing it.

“We will. Tianmen City only opens three days later.”

“Plus, it wouldn’t necessarily be good news to arrive first. It may be dangerous and would be better for the others to enter first.”

Luo Yue ignored them and she had the same expressionless look on her face.

She controlled the sword underneath her feet and tried to go faster.

She had a feeling.

She knew that Lin Xiu would be there.

This was because this was the biggest event here in Warrior God Realm.

When the gates open to the ancient ruins, it would be impossible that Lin Xiu wouldn’t be there.

“Lin Xiu, who are you looking for?”

Xiao Qingchen, who was just about to sit on the ground, asked Lin Xiu curiously.

Ever since they got here, Lin Xiu has been looking around as if he was trying to find someone.

“No one. I was just looking to see if there’s anyone that I know.”

Lin Xiu smiled in return.

“There’s too many people here. It would be difficult for you to find anyone.”

Yuan Zheng added on to the conversation.

...

Lin Xiu took another look around before starting his cultivation.

It was still early and he should use the opportunity to cultivate here. It would be best to keep his energy high.

“Hmm? An Tianlan’s weapon? Why is it here?”

When Lin Xiu sat on the ground, some of the warriors around noticed the golden spear next to him.

“Do you know this dude?”

One of the younger men pointed at Lin Xiu.

“Nope.”

The rest of them shook their heads.

Lin Xiu was someone new and none of them knew who he was.

“That’s interesting. Perhaps this guy stole An Tianlan’s weapon?”

The young man stared at his spear.

...

“Keep an eye on him. An Tianlan’s weapon is a treasure. Get it from him if you have the chance.”

Three days quickly passed by.

Boom –

There was a loud sound that travelled around. Lin Xiu, along with the other warriors who were cultivating, opened their eyes in shock and quickly got up.

The sky that was bright before suddenly turned dark!

Then, lightning appeared.

These lightning were like dragons and they seemed terrifying.

Soon, there was a huge figure that appeared in the air.

“Mr Shima!”

The rest of the warriors shouted in surprise when they saw who it was.

Lin Xiu was also surprised as well to see the old man in the air.

He only got to meet his spirit earlier now but now it was the old man’s true self. Lin Xiu could already feel the strong energy coming from him.

He subconsciously activated his Analytic Eye but soon realised that it didn’t work.

This man was too powerful.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and continued staring at him.

“Tianmen City only opens once every 20 years.”

“Finders keepers for everything that you find inside.”

Mr Shima announced it to the crowd.

His tone sounded as if he was speaking to himself but everyone could hear him inside their minds.

Boom – –

The lightning continued and the sky turned even darker.

Then, Mr Shima started making weird poses with his arms.

The entire sky was then filled with weird runes.

As soon as these runes appeared, there was a loud explosion that followed.

It sounded as if there was an explosion in the air.

Suddenly, a huge city gate appeared!

It was enormous.

“That’s…Tianmen City!”

Xiao Qingchen’s eyes were wide open.

They were both filled with shock.

“Tianmen City finally appeared…”

Yuan Zheng tightened his grip around his weapon and his body was shaking.

Lin Xiu had his eyes fixed on the gate when there was a bright light that suddenly appeared!
