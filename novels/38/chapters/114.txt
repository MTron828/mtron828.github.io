Chapter 115: Venomous Creature – Blue Amber Snake!

Rumble rumble- Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Thunder could be heard as the sky quickly became dark.

It looked as though it was about to rain.

“What’s up with the weather?” Lin Xiu frowned.

“The weather here is really erratic. It can be hot and sunny one moment and thunderous the next moment.” Tian Zhi nodded his head.

“Where are we going now?” Lin Xiu asked.

“Straight ahead, we are about to reach Black Salt Lake soon.” TIan Zhi observed his surroundings before saying.

“Will there be leeches in the swamp?” Right in front of them was a swamp, and upon recalling the terrifying leech, his heart started to turn cold.

Leeches were extremely disgusting, much less the fact that they wanted to kill him.

“Let’s jump across.” Lin Xiu thought about it and said.

No one knew if there were more T-rex leeches inside the swamp, and they did not know how deep the swamp was either. It was impossible to walk over it. If they went all out to charge through, Lin Xiu believed they should be able to jump to the other end.

Lin Xiu took a few steps back, leaned forward, and exerted a large amount of force in both legs to shoot forward!

With that speed, he leaped out over 20 meters!

He almost collided with a gigantic tree on the other side. Fortunately, Lin Xiu was able to turn and dodge the tree. He stepped onto the ground and stabilized himself while pushing some soil aside.

“What about it? Can you jump over?” Lin Xiu looked at Tian Zhi at the other side and asked.

“No problem.” Tian Zhi nodded his head. He was not surprised when he saw Lin Xiu perform the jump, any official warrior could perform the same jump as long as they used all their strength.

But what he did not know was that the total weight of Dark Edge spear and the box that Lin Xiu carried was almost a thousand catties!

Bang-

Tian Zhi jumped but was unfortunate to crash onto the branches of an azure tree. His cheek turned red from the collision.

“It hurts…” Tian Zhi rubbed his cheek and said.

“Sshhh…” Lin Xiu seemed to have heard something and immediately silenced Tian Zhi.

‘What?’

Tian Zhi was startled and immediately looked around but did not discover any shadows or figures.

“Rupturing Fist!” Lin Xiu suddenly smashed towards the top of an azure tree!

Bang-

A loud explosion occurred as all the branches were ripped apart!

Si si si-

A long azure blue snake came out of the branches and coiled around Lin Xiu.

It was completely azure blue and its outer skin looked like the bark of a tree. This camouflage prevented people from recognizing it.

If not for Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu would not be aware of this hunter that was secretly observing him.

It coiled around Lin Xiu’s arm and suddenly shot forward. It opened its mouth and revealed two sharp fangs as it bit down towards Lin Xiu’s neck!

What a ferocious creature!

Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed as he quickly used his thumb and index finger to pinch onto the snake’s throat accurately and used his other arm to grab the tail.

He had seen this creature on the warrior union’s website while gathering information before, it was the most ferocious creature in Path of Death.

Rank 3 Blue Amber snake. Although it was only a rank 3, the venom from its fangs was extremely toxic. Once bitten, a rank 4 warrior would die in 15 minutes.

15 minutes was not enough to run to the closest medical treatment facility and there was the possibility of dying due to coagulation of blood and a stop in blood circulation. This snake was thus a warrior’s nightmare. It meant that as long as they managed to land a bite!

“Blue Amber snake?!” Tian Zhi obviously recognized the snake and breathed in a breath of cold air.

This creature was the most venomous creature in the entire Azure Forest. Even an immortal would be killed if they were bitten by this snake!

And there were very few of them, who would have thought that they would encounter one? Tian Zhi did not know whether their luck was considered good or bad!

Lin Xiu wanted to let it go but realized that the Blue Amber Snake was struggling intensely!

“Hmph!” The Blue Amber snake released a large amount of strength and caused Lin Xiu to stagger backwards.

With a snort, he exerted force with his fingers, and sparks started to appear from his fingernails!

Fire Claws!!!

Pa-

The part at which his fingers were exploded with flames and the blue amber snake that wielded the strength of a bull died.

Ding!

“Congratulations Master for killing rank 3 blue amber snake, obtaining 250000 experience points!”

It actually yielded 250000 experience points? This surprised Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu continued to use Analytic Eye and surveyed his surroundings. After confirming that there were no creatures waiting in ambush, he heaved a sigh of relief.

He recalled that the blue amber snake was rare and the skin could be sold at a high price while the snake gall was a delicacy.

Lin Xiu quickly skinned the snake and opened up the body. The snake gall was blue and small like a ping pong ball and looked extremely unique.

He recalled the information regarding the blue amber snake, the snake gall could greatly improve the physique and nourish energy as well as confidence in a person. After hesitating for a moment, he placed it in his mouth.

The snake gall dissolved like cotton candy in his mouth and sweetness overloaded.

It was truly out of Lin Xiu’s expectation. This snake gall was unlike any other and was not bitter at all!

“The snake meat is a good resource as well, we can barbeque it later.” Tian Zhi saw Lin Xiu skinning the snake, and when he noticed that Lin Xiu wanted to throw the meat away, he immediately reminded him.

“Then you can take it.” Lin Xiu nodded.

Tian Zhi quickly took the meat and used his blade to remove the head.

The two continued onward. Soon after, Lin Xiu spotted a giant and round lake under the canopy of trees!

The lake was blackish blue and looked like a mirror, reflecting the sky and surrounding trees around it.

‘This is… Black Salt Lake?!’
