Chapter 913: The Power of the Holy Skill

“If that’s the case, then kill them all.”

Shadow said aloud as if talking to himself.

At the same time, the weapon he held in his hand suddenly had a burst of dazzling light.

swoosh—

Holding the sword that radiated white light, he directly drew a circular arc.

Immediately, a large amount of sword aura burst out!

The surrounding space seemed to have been ripped apart and a loud noise came out.

When some warriors saw this scene, their expressions changed greatly.

Some warriors didn’t have time to dodge and their bodies were directly cut in half by the terrifying sword aura!

“not good!”

The faces of Hu Ling and the others sitting in the four corners of the battle platform changed.

...

They quickly jumped off the platform.

boom boom boom —

The seats they were sitting on were directly cut in half by those terrifying sword aura!

“An Nengxing! Your subordinate has gone too far!”

Hu Ling dodged and while heaving a sigh of relief, she stared fiercely at An Nengxing who was nearby.

“Real battles are like this.”

Although An Nengxing was a little scared, he still said with a sneer.

bang bang bang-

Those Lin Xiu clones were also destroyed one by one at this moment.

But only one of them, wielding a long spear, resisted those terrifying sword aura.

“interesting.”

Lin Xiu, who was in the air, narrowed his eyes slightly when he saw this scene.

His source strength was transmitted to the Dark Edge spear held in his hand and the entire spear body became like amethyst-colored glass at speed visible to the naked eye.

Holding this Dark Edge spear, Lin Xiu moved his body and charged straight down from the air!

Fast as the wind.

Dang–

When Shadow saw this scene, his face changed slightly.

Holding the sword, he subconsciously resisted Lin Xiu’s attack.

But Lin Xiu’s blow was too terrifying. The powerful force made Shadow retreat several steps.

Before he could stabilize himself, the Dark Edge spear that Lin Xiu was holding stabbed again!

The spear was like thunder, bringing thousands of spear shadows!

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

With Lin Xiu’s current strength, he used this move and he stabbed out a large number of spears in an instant.

There was absolutely no way to count them.

A burst of sound came from the surrounding air, causing those warriors to cover their ears.

Many warriors were already frantically trying to escape.

For them, a battle at the level of Respected warrior was simply a fight between gods and they didn’t dare to be near at all.

And the skills they used were too terrifying and the range was too wide.

They might be the ones dead ah!

“This kid...”

An Nengxing watched Lin Xiu wave the spear in his hand, as if the god of war was alive and he couldn’t help but feel a little panic in his heart.

But soon he calmed down.

“Shadow has reached the Respected warrior Realm for such a long time and his ability should be very strong and he will not be killed so easily.”

bang bang bang-

Just as An Nengxing thought, the Dark Edge spear held by Lin Xiu stabbed his body, but it was not able to penetrate his body directly.

“The pain I have experienced has created my strong body and you can’t kill me!”

Shadow who had been silent all this time suddenly roared out as he looked at Lin Xiu’s spear stabbing toward his body.

“Is that so.”

Hearing Shadow’s words, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but raise his brows.

.

But there was no stagnation in the movements in his hands.

Still waving the spear in his hand, constantly attacking Shadow’s body.

“‘Heaven-Defying Ray’!”

Shadow held the sword in his hand and at the moment when he retreated to dodge Lin Xiu’s attack, he roared and the sword again burst out with a dazzling white light.

This light seems to directly illuminate the entire underground space!

“not good!”

When Hu Ling and others saw this scene, their expressions changed drastically.

Boom—

At the next moment, with a huge explosion, the entire ground was blown apart.

A large number of warriors died under the ground.

And Shadow quickly jumped out of this collapsed fighting platform.

Not far away, there are many warriors looking over.

This underground fighting arena was special. Ordinary warriors would not dare to destroy this place.

Who is this, who dares to make trouble here and uses such terrifying skill to knock down the underground fighting arena!?

After Shadow flew out of the ruins, he was directly suspended in the air.

On the forehead, there is a source mark that emitted a bright white light.

As the source mark on his forehead appeared, a lot of energy gathered towards his forehead!

“What... what a strong energy fluctuation!”

When the warriors below saw this scene, the expressions in their eyes changed significantly.

Some warriors seem to sense danger and wanted to flee.

On the other side of the ruins, with a loud noise, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared directly from the ruins.

“die!!!”

Shadow who was in the air looked at Lin Xiu and his eyes widened.

The power gathered on the source mark also instantly shot like a laser beam towards Lin Xiu below!

“That’s right, I’ll use you to practice my skill.”

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the corners of his mouth curled up.

At this moment, all the strength of the whole body quickly converged on the spear.

The spear body, which was originally like amethyst glass, was now covered by white light.

“Shadow, kill him!!!”

An Nengxing also crawled out from the other side of the ruins at this time.

Seeing the terrifying power released by Shadows in the air, he couldn’t help roaring with excitement.

“Heaven Breaking...”

“one strike!!!”

Holy-level skill – ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’!

Lin Xiu held the long spear in his hand and made a direct volley!

Boom—

This stroke seemed as if the sky had been cut open!

The windows in a radius of ten miles were all shattered in an instant!

The source mark power released by Shadow was all reversed and impacted back.

His body suspended in the air was instantly annihilated into a bone. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Then the bones shattered into dust.

disappeared into the air.

“Dead...dead!?”

Luo Kun and Zhang Jin also climbed out of the ruins at the same time.

Seeing this scene, the expression in his eyes also changed greatly.

Was a warrior at the level of Respected warrior just killed so easily?

Thinking of this, their bodies trembled slightly.

They were also Respected warrior-level warriors, but they were not stronger than Shadow.

Even Shadow could be killed so easily, so they...

“Phew, it’s a bit exhausting.”

At the same time, Lin Xiu mumbled to himself and looked at the other side.

He could clearly see An Nengxing.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly, holding a spear and slowly walked towards him.
