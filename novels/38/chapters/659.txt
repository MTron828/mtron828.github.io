“Damn it!!!”

When both the elders noticed what was happening, the both of them tured mad.

They felt as if their dignity had been threatened.

‘They immediately released ‘Yuan’, picked up their weapons and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

When Lin Xiu saw them, he didn’t think of dodging them since they wanted to fight him with raw strength. His eyes narrowed as he focused his strength onto his spear.

The white glow that surrounded his body had turned even brighter at this moment.

Then, the both of them who were attacking Lin Xiu from the air released their warrior skills that collided with each other!

Koong Loong ~~

With a loud explosion, both of their powerful warrior skills came into contact with each other and caused a huge impact. It caused the ground beneath them to shake vigorously.

“Damn it…

Both the elders from the Zhuo family and the Jiang family had used their strongest skills to fight Lin Xiu but the both of them were the one getting affected by the impact instead.

A mouthful of blood came out of their mouths.

Lin Xiu, who was also in contact with the powerful force, was thrown into the distance and landed on the wall behind him.

The wall immediately cracked as he landed.

Xiu xiu xu —

At that moment, the men who surrounded the building started shooting him with lasers.

Lin Xiu could feel a sharp pain all over his back. Before he could take a breath, he noticed the lasers that were coming from both sides.

These lasers were different from the ones before; these were stronger and it was impossible for Lin Xiu to face it head on.

He clenched his jaw and decided to dodge them.

Koong Loong —

‘The wall where Lin Xiu was standing a while ago had a huge hole on it now.

“Awe of the Phoenix’!”

Lin Xiu moved the spear in his arm. Flaming birds started appearing in the air and they dashed towards the warriors who were aiming at him with the laser weapons.

Then, Lin Xiu continued fighting both the elders who were in front of him.

“You brat! You’re dead!”

The elder from the Jiang family was fuming mad when he saw how Lin Xiu still had the courage to fight them and by how Lin Xiu was looking as if he wanted to kill the both of them.

He raised the hammer in his hand and gave it a good swing.

As he threw it towards Lin Xiu, there was a huge hammer shadow that appeared in the air that was headed towards Lin Xiu!

“Break it!”

Lin Xiu noticed that huge shadow that was above him, he screamed as he pointed his spear upwards towards the shadow.

Hong —

The terrifying shadow of the hammer was immediately destroyed by Lin Xiu’s spear.

‘The elder from the Jiang family widened his eyes as he was in shock. Due to the impact, he spitted out blood as his entire body was affected by the huge impact.

“You’re dead now!”

Lin Xiu decided to take the opportunity. He leaped into the air with his spear and aimed it towards the old man who was on the ground!

However, the elder from the Zhuo family swung his sword and a horrifying sword aura travelled in a crescent shape as it went for Lin Xiu who was about to kill the other elder.

Lin Xiu could feel the sword aura and sensed that it was trouble. He immediately stopped himself and did a difficult turn in the air in order to dodge the attack.

As the crescent shaped sword aura passed by Lin Xiu’s body, he could feel how scary its strength was.

Even a small part of his hair had been chopped off.

“Go to hell!!!

The elder from the Zhuo family rushed towards Lin Xiu.

He was trying to make sure that the other elder gets the chance to escape Lin Xiu’s attack.

They were aware that Lin Xiu’s strength was now incredibly terrifying, If they want him dead, they would have to do it together.

Clang clang clang —

Lin Xiu frowned his brows as he fought with the elder from the Zhuo family with his spear.

sh*t.

Lin Xiu thought of killing one first before he could kill the other. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

But, judging the situation that he was in right now, it would be difficult.

Plus, he had limited time to use ‘Rage’. It has already been 5 minutes. Once the time runs out, he would be the one that’s dead!

“This brat.

The elder from the Jiang family was looking at Lin Xiu, who was fighting with the elder from the Zhuo family, and his eyes was filled with hatred and anger.

He tightened his grip on his hammer.

He didn’t attack immediately. He was waiting for an opportunity. He wanted an opportunity where Lin Xiu couldn’t run so that he could attack him once and for all, killing Lin Xiu!

“Rubbish!”

Nan Huang’s grandfather arrived and saw how Lin Xiu was fighting with the elder from the Zhuo family. From the look of it, it does look like the elder was about to lose. He cursed a little before heading towards them.

Xiu–

However, he noticed a cold, sharp light that was coming from the side. The look in his eyes changed as he turned his body slightly to dodge the attack.

“You’re really asking for it!”

Nan Huang’s grandfather took a good look at who it was and it was Luo Yue who had attacked him.

Luo Yue had already released her ‘Yuan’. Before the old man had the chance to attack him, she had already aimed her sword towards him.

“You’re dead!”

Nanhuang’s grandfather screamed as he reached for his sword as well!

Clang —

As the sword in his hand collided with Luo Yue’s sword, there was a spark in the air and Luo Yue’s sword was thrown into the air!

Luo Yue’s arm immediately turned red.

The difference between a rank 8 warrior and a rank 9 warrior was too much!

“Go to hell!”

The old man did not hesitate and was about to finish Luo Yue.

Asa rank 9 warrior, Luo Yue’s ‘Yuan’ was nothing to him.

Luo Yue’s pupil shrank as she saw the sword that was headed towards him. It was too quick and it would be impossible for Luo Yue to dodge it.

Clang —

Ina split second, there was a soft crispy sound in the air and a white figure appeared in front of Luo Yue.

“Looks like the Nan family no longer cared about the Luo family.”

Big sister?!

When she saw the familiar figure in front of her, Luo Yue was stunned.

That’s right. The person who appeared suddenly was Luo Yue’s elder sister. She was holding onto her sword as she glared at Nan Huang’s grandfather.

“Hmph!”

Nan Huang’s grandfather snorted but the murderous intention in his eyes showed it al.

His grandson died. For him, there was nothing else left.

He must get Lin Xiu to die with his grandson!
