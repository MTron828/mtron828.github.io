Chapter 782: The Use of the Source Mark Ability

“‘Earth-shattering quake’!!!”

“‘Ground Slam’!!!”

“...”

Because Lin Xiu killed a few warriors in an instant, these warriors didn’t dare to be careless at this time.

They directly used his strongest skills and attacked Lin Xiu!

boom boom boom —

At this moment, the entire ground began to vibrate.

The faces of the three master warrior-level warriors also changed suddenly.

There seems to be a fierce battle in this cave and there are some signs of collapse. Now they directly use this kind of powerful skills, the cave was very likely to collapse!

The Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand slowly began to turn dark red at this time.

Looking at the warriors who were charging over, Lin Xiu unfolded his ‘Sphere’, blocked all their skills and at the same time, the spear in his hand stabbed out!

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

Whoosh whoosh—

The spear stabbed out like a phantom and those warriors wanted to rely on their own “Sphere” to spread out, thinking that no matter how bad it was, there would be no danger to their lives.

But didn’t expect that the dark red Dark Edge spear would directly pierce their ‘Sphere’!

how can that be!

Not only were those warriors shocked, but even the three master warrior-level warriors had a look of disbelief at this time.

You must know that the ‘Sphere’ is formed with the source strength of a warrior, it can be said to be the hardest and it was broken so easily!?

This is too scary!

And once the ‘Sphere’ was broken, the source strength running in their bodies was immediately impacted and the whole person seemed to be backlashed and blood spurted out of their mouths in an instant.

Moreover, before these people had time to react, they saw a path of flaming birds rushing towards their bodies!

boom boom boom —

In an instant, the flaming birds directly surrounded their bodies.

The raging fire was burning at this moment. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Ah!!!”

These warriors let out a wailing scream, struggling frantically on the ground.

But these flames are extremely terrifying, no matter how these people roll on the ground, these flames seem to never go out.

In a short period of time, all the warriors who were hit by the flaming birds were burnt into black charcoal.

“Let them go.”

Lin Xiu waved the spear in his hand, then pointed at them and said.

“Let them go? Hehe...”

The weapons in the hands of the three master warrior-level warriors were placed on the necks of Liu Pan and the others.

Now they already know that they and others are not Lin Xiu’s opponents.

However, he still has hostages in his hands.

“Do you think that’s possible!!!”

The leader said with a sinister expression at this time.

Lin Xiu frowned at this moment. These three were at the bottom of the master warrior-level and it was not difficult to kill them.

But it was not easy to kill these people while saving Liu Pan and the others.

If they make a move, they will kill Liu Pan and the others directly...

“Let them go, I can let you guys go.”

Lin Xiu said with no expression on his face.

“Hahaha, what a joke, do I still need you to let us go?”

The leader laughed loudly.

“You, throw the weapon away for me!”

At this moment, he stared at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

As he spoke, the sword in his hand pressed against An Qi’s neck.

At this moment, An Qi felt a tingling sensation and the skin on her neck would be easily torn off.

A smear of blood flowed down.

“Master...kill him!”

An Qi gritted her teeth at this time and said aloud.

“Shut up!!!”

The warrior shouted loudly, still looking at Lin Xiu.

“Toss the weapon away! Do you hear me or I’ll kill them all!”

As soon as he finished speaking, at this moment, the other two master warrior-level warriors also held the weapons in their hands and pressed against Qian Lin and Liu Pan’s necks.

boom–

Lin Xiu frowned and threw the Dark Edge spear in his hand on the ground beside him.

“Is it alright?”

“Very good...”

At this moment, the leader showed a wicked smile, then said aloud.

“And kneel down!”

“I told you to kneel, do you hear me?”

He now has hostages and it was as if he has control over Lin Xiu and he continued to speak unscrupulously at this time.

The corners of the other two warriors’ mouths also twitched, looking at Lin Xiu with mockery.

But at this time, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed.

Showing a look of interest.

“Is it fun?”

“Kneel down! Did you hear me!”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s strange expression, the warrior immediately shouted.

Then he motioned to kill An Qi with his own sword around her neck.

But at this moment, they discovered that a black pattern appeared on Lin Xiu’s forehead.

what...

Source mark!?

The three of them also reacted quickly. When the weapons in their hands were about to move, they found that their hands were framed by some square matrices!

When Fat Liu and the others saw this situation, they quickly reacted in an instant.

The source strength burst out and they instantly broke free from the shackles of these people.

And because the hands of these three warriors holding weapons were framed by these square matrices, now their hands can’t move at all!

What the hell is this!?

There was fear in their eyes.

“Are you guys alright?”

Lin Xiu looked at Liu Pan and the others fleeing to his side and asked.

“We’re fine.”

An Qi and the others shook their heads. The wound on their necks was not deep and for a warrior of their level, the healing speed was very fast and the bleeding had stopped by now.

“Damn!!!”

The three warriors roared when they saw that their hands were already stuck in the translucent square matrix in the air.

“Blast.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

As soon as Lin Xiu’s voice fell, all these matrices seemed to swell up and in the next moment, a huge explosion occurred!

“what!!!”

These people’s hands were not wrapped by the source strength and they were directly subjected to such a terrifying explosion and the whole hand was directly blown into a mass of mud.

The weapons they were holding just now also all fell to the ground.

Lin Xiu looked at this scene, not showing any pity at all, he stretched out his right hand and the Dark Edge spear that had just been thrown on the ground flew back into Lin Xiu’s hand.

Whoosh whoosh—

As Lin Xiu waved his spear again, at this moment, the flaming birds charged straight ahead!
