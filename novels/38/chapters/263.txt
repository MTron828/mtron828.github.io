Chapter 264: Getting The 100 Million Bounty

Lin Xiu laughed bitterly and said.

He really didn’t have any power at all currently and couldn’t move at all.

Guo Ling nodded, then took out a phone from the side pocket of Lin Xiu’s backpack.

Soon, after helping Lin Xiu turn on the phone, Guo Ling brought it over there, pointed at Zhou Wenhao’s body, and started taking 3D pictures.

Qiu Li and the others looked at Lin Xiu, who was lying on the ground, in shock.

They didn’t think much of Lin Xiu at the beginning but were now shocked by him.

Lin Xiu was simply amazing, even they had to look at him differently.

Boom boom——

About ten minutes later, a sound came from the sky.

Soon, a mini plane landed from the sky at this moment.

Lin Xiu stood up slowly at this time, the aftereffects of ‘Fury’ seemed to have slowly dissipated.

Although Lin Xiu still couldn’t use too much strength, he was able to move.

At this moment, he looked at the plane that had landed, and on the plane, there was the logo of the Union Army.

He knew immediately that it was the people from the government union army.

When the plane stopped, soldiers in camouflage uniforms walked off the plane with weapons on their backs.

Seeing the corpses of those warriors on the ground, they were a little surprised.

But they didn’t say much; there were a lot of battles between warriors and they couldn’t do much about it.

“Zhou Wenhao was killed by you guys?” At this moment, a soldier glanced at Lin Xiu and others and asked.

“He killed him.” Guo Ling pointed to Lin Xiu and answered.

Qiu Li and the others also looked at Lin Xiu without refuting.

After all, they did not help much in the battle just now, and Zhou Wenhao was killed by Lin Xiu.

But what was the thing that ran out of Lin Xiu’s backpack?

What they were most puzzled about right now was this – that pale blue thing, what was it?

Those union soldiers glanced at Lin Xiu, then walked over to Zhou Wenhao’s corpse. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

They were surprised when they received the news that someone had claimed Zhou Wenhao’s bounty.

Zhou Wenhao, the Class-A wanted criminal, was very cunning. He seldom appeared in the city and was always in the mountains.

Coupled with Zhou Wenhao’s strength, he was very troublesome.

“He was really killed by this kid?”

A union soldier looked at the body covered in blood and exclaimed in surprise.

“Check and you’ll find out.”

A union soldier said suddenly.

In this future world, all kinds of information about you would be sampled at birth, so it was very easy to identify a person’s authenticity.

Soon, as they extracted fingerprints and performed DNA comparisons, they discovered that this person was indeed Zhou Wenhao!

And now Zhou Wenhao’s body was covered in blood, even his eyes had ruptured and he looked very miserable.

“Take the corpse back.” A union soldier said to his companion.

Hearing his words, the other two soldiers nodded and lifted Zhou Wenhao’s body to the plane.

“You killed him?” At this moment, the Union soldier looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

Lin Xiu nodded.

The Union soldier tossed a black card directly towards Lin Xiu.

Pa——

Although Lin Xiu’s strength was not fully restored yet, he could still catch the card easily.

“Here is the bounty, 100 million Union coins.” The Union soldier looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“Not bad, little guy.” He said in admiration, then walked directly into the plane.

The plane started, and they took off directly.

“These people seem very strong.” Qian Lin suddenly heaved a sigh of relief as he watched the Union soldiers leave.

Qiu Li and the rest nodded and agreed too.

Those Union soldiers simply stood here and they could already feel their extremely powerful aura.

There was a kind of oppressive aura that made people breathless.

“They are all warriors above rank 7.” Guo Ling watched these people leave and said after returning Lin Xiu’s phone to him.

Just now after she took a 3D picture of Zhou Wenhao’s body, she sent their location at the same time.

They didn’t expect these people to move so quickly and arrived in just about ten minutes.

Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up while holding this black card.

This is 100 million Union coins!

Lin Xiu never had so much money since he came back.

If you have 100 million Union coins, he could upgrade his equipment anytime.

“Lin Xiu, do you want to take a break?” Guo Ling looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

After all, the battle between Lin Xiu and Zhou Wenhao happened not long ago, and Lin Xiu probably hadn’t recovered yet.

“No, let’s get going.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

Anyway, he would just be lying on top of the Android Battle Tiger and it could navigate by itself, he didn’t have to do anything.

Guo Ling nodded when he saw that Lin Xiu was not injured and said to Qiu Li and the others, “If there is nothing wrong, let’s keep going and try to reach Dark Forest before it gets dark!”

“Alright!”

The others nodded and went on the Battle Tiger to continue ahead.

Soon, everyone moved forward at an extremely fast speed.

Not long after Lin Xiu left, a man read the message on his phone that Zhou Wenhao was killed and his gaze changed suddenly.

After slaying a huge evolved beast with the sword in his hand, he rushed to the other side swiftly.

Very soon, he arrived at the area where Lin Xiu, Zhou Wenhao, and the others were fighting just now.

After seeing the dead bodies all over the ground, his eyes widened.

He also trembled slightly.

“Su Cheng!!!”

When he walked over and saw the body of one of the men, he let out a sudden roar.

His son, Su Cheng, was dead!

Moreover, the powerful Zhou Wenhao, the vice president of their guild, was also killed. This was a huge blow to him.

He, the president, was the only one left in the entire guild!

So many people died within a day, his own son also died. His body was shaking with anger.

“I don’t care who you are! I must kill all of you!!!”
