1334 The Final Battle

“The quality of the weapon is so bad…”

Lei Chong couldn’t help but clenched his fist when he saw what had happened.

It must be noted that the weapon wasn’t a cheap one but it broke unexpectedly.

“Perhaps the energy that your city lord has exceeded the capacity of the spear.”

The middle aged man spoke to Lei Chong after hearing what he said.

Without the weapon, the battle should come to an end very soon.

“Goodbye.”

Xiao Qingchen tightly gripped onto his machete.

The flaming giant then combined with his machete and it looked like there was a golden flame that completely enveloped the whole machete.

“Go!!!”

With a loud roar, the golden flame then rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Seeing what was about to happen, Lin Xiu threw the rest of the Haoyue Spear onto the ground.

He quickly activated his skills, hoping to dodge the attack.

However, when Lin Xiu moved to the opposite side, he noticed that the golden flame was still headed toward him!

There was no way he could hide!

The flame hasn’t even come into contact with Lin Xiu but he could already feel the terrifying energy that came from it. It felt as if his body was about to melt.

This flame was incredibly powerful! Even more so compared to his hellfire!

Lin Xiu had a feeling that if he got attacked by such flames, his entire body would start melting.

“You’re dead!!!”

Xiao Qingchen screamed on top of his lungs.

Boom – –

Then, the golden flame collided with Lin Xiu’s body and Lin Xiu was immediately covered by the golden flames.

These flames were terrifying. The stage which has been specially built using a type of unique material, started melting as well!

It has to be noted that these metals used had durability and special resistance against high temperature!

The rest of the audience also started sweating like cats and dogs due to the scorching heat.

It was way too hot.

These flames started to affect the audience in the arena.

As they stared at the golden flames on stage, no living warriors would be able to withstand such heat.

Lin Xiu was bound to die!

The golden flame then soon disappeared.

These were flames that Xiao Qingchen had created using his divine spirit. It wasn’t one that came from his source energy.

It was still exhausting for him to release such skills.

“He’s dead…”

Xiao Qingchen muttered to himself as the flames slowly disappeared.

However, the scene that he had imagined of Lin Xiu being killed did not appear before his eyes.

Instead, Lin Xiu was still alive!

“You’re…you’re not dead?!”

Xiao Qingchen’s pupils shrink uncontrollably.

The skills that he had used earlier were incredibly powerful but Lin Xiu is still alive!

The only thing that happened to him was how pathetic Lin Xiu looked right now.

“Hu~”

Lin Xiu let out a long breath. He was now completely covered with a toasted smell.

As they took a good look, it was obvious that Lin Xiu’s combat suit had been burnt badly and even his skin looked burnt.

There was also fresh blood seeping through the cracks on his skin.

At that moment, if Lin Xiu had not activated the ‘Immortal Body’, Lin Xiu would have died with no doubt once his body got attacked by those horrifying golden flames.

However, even with that skill activated, Lin Xiu still felt a sharp pain all over his body.

Lin Xiu had been training with fire but he was still badly injured. This was more than enough to show how scary those flames were.

Fortunately, these were energy that came from his divine spirit and Xiao Qingchen wouldn’t be able to use these terrifying energies forever.

“A little bit more.”

Lin Xiu smiled as he looked at Xiao Qingchen.

Xiao Qingchen couldn’t help but put on a solemn look on his face.

He would no longer be able to continue using the divine spirit energy. Otherwise, his body would not be able to stand it any longer.

He grabbed onto his machete tightly.

Sizzling – –

...

At that moment, there were thick thunderbolts that appeared all around the machete.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was already badly injured, he raised the machete above his head!

Then, the huge lightning bolts above his head were all released at once!

There was a huge dragon that rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu sneered when he saw what happened. Instead of dodging it, he went straight toward the lightning bolts.

The electrical element energy stone around his neck started shining brightly.

There were also large amounts of lightning bolts that surrounded Lin Xiu’s body.

Due to how he was already prepared earlier, Lin Xiu already had his boxing gloves on.

The dragon was about to hit Lin Xiu!

Instead of dodging the dragon, he was about to go head to head with the dragon.

Sizzling – –

...

There were horrifying lightning bolts all around the dragon and it was going straight for Lin Xiu’s body.

Lin Xiu could immediately feel the pain that traveled all over his body.

The lightning bolts around his body have instantly merged with the ones from the dragon. They were about to penetrate through Lin Xiu’s skin, causing damage. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Lin Xiu clenched his jaw and ignored the lightning bolts.

This was because he had high resistance towards these lightning bolts.

‘Source strength control’!

Lin Xiu instantly activated another skill as he rushed forward.

The energy in the air as well as the warriors sitting at the audience seat had their source energy absorbed by Lin Xiu.

“It’s here again.”

Wan Gan could clearly feel everything and he frowned.

He could feel that his source energy was getting sucked out of his body.

There was a vast amount of energy that rushed into Lin Xiu.

He was then able to replenish all of the energy that he had lost earlier.

All of the energy that rushed into him caused his body to expand.

There was too much energy and Lin Xiu felt as if his body was about to explode.

Lin Xiu clenched his jaws and tried his best to withstand the pain coming from his body.

All of the energy that he received has been diverted onto his left hand!

“This guy…”

Xiao Qingchen’s pupil shrank subconsciously when he saw what was happening.

Not only did Lin Xiu withstand the lightning bolts that he had released, there was only a vast amount of energy getting absorbed into his body.

Even Xiao Qingchen could feel that there were energy sucked out of his body that entered into Lin Xiu’s body.
