Chapter 92: Level Bug!

What was even more shocking to Lin Xiu was that such precision and control over source strength was something only rank 6 warriors and above could achieve!

Lin Xiu immediately felt that his previous question regarding Baili Haoling’s age was justified.

After thinking about it carefully, this boy that looked to be younger and smaller than him might actually be much older than he thought.

The reason for this was that after cultivating to a certain degree, one could forcefully shrink their bodies and regain their youthful looks.

‘How is that possible!!’

The Luo brothers roared out loud when they saw the sphere and their expressions turned to fear.

They struck an iron board!

“Is it my turn?” Baili Haoling looked at the Luo brothers in the air and his mouth curved upwards. He exerted force with both legs and shot into the sky like a cannonball!

“Falling Moon Thirteen Slash!”

“Combination skill – Yin Yang Golden Bell!!!!” Luo YIn and Luo Yang were aghast at the sight of the attack and immediately unleashed their defensive-type skill.

Source strength appeared from behind them and formed in the shape of a golden bell as it surrounded them.

Clang-

They saw cold auras charging at them. Although the blades had slashed onto their bodies, it did not create injuries.

But they did not dare relax.

This Falling Moon Thirteen Slash was obviously not just one attack. Baili Haoling was able to unleash slashes regardless of any position that formed glorious and resplendent white auras.

Zheng-

Three seconds passed and Baili Haoling’s figure landed on the ground again. He had already sheathed both sabers.

“Hahaha, I thought you were strong, but you can’t even break through our defense!” Luo Yin laughed out loud.

He did not feel any pain on his body.

“Big bro…” Right at this time, Luo Yang’s eyes opened widely from behind, he felt somewhat unnatural.

“What…” Just as Luo Yin was about to reply, his body suddenly froze.

“When you reach a certain speed, you will be able to kill a person without them feeling anything.” Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu happily and said.

Just as he said that, Luo Yin and Luo Yang’s body were sliced into pieces and fell to the ground.

Blood seemed to stay inside their bodies as their cut up pieces fell neatly in place.

Lin Xiu’s mouth was wide open.

‘How can killing someone be so artistic…’

But Lin Xiu suddenly felt that the two were not completely dead yet!

‘If I added in an attack, would the experience be mine?’

Upon thinking about that, Lin Xiu grabbed his sword and rushed forward!

“Eh?” Baili Haoling was curious by Lin Xiu’s actions.

Lin Xiu used his sword and thrust it into their heads and got rid of their remaining consciousness. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“You’re rather vicious.” Baili Haoling smirked at Lin Xiu’s act.

Lin Xiu frowned. ‘Did it fail?’

Right when he was skeptical, ‘ding’ sounds came out from his head!

“Congratulations Master for killing a rank 4 warrior, earning 1845485 experience points!”

“Congratulations Master for killing a rank 4 warrior, earning 1684687 experience points!”

The notifications surprised Lin Xiu and made a smile on his face.

It was more than 3 million experience points in total!!!

“Ding~~Congratulations Master, for leveling up to level 16!”

‘I’ve leveled up!’

Lin Xiu excitedly opened up his stats board:

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: Level 16

Experience: 539635 (4500000 experience required for the next level)

Strength: 251

Physique: 105

Speed: 78

Skills: Analytic Eye, Fury, Disguise

Rage build-up: 0/100

Remaining Potential Points: 16

Title: Rank 2 Warrior

Lin Xiu was elated when he saw his stats. In just two days, he had increased five points in Physique and three in Speed. It should be the results of the training.

Without thinking further, Lin Xiu added 9 points into strength to a total of 260, 5 points to physique to a total of 110 and the remaining to speed, changing it to 80.

Seeing the numbers, Lin Xiu finally felt that it looked pleasing to the eye.

“Did you become a fool?” Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu laughing and jumping by himself and could not help but ask as he moved closer.

“It’s nothing.” Lin Xiu immediately returned to reality when he heard Baili Haoling.

Baili Haoling immediately became even better looking to him. It was a pleasant surprise, it felt as though he was being brought to power level by an expert.

‘Is this a system bug? Hahaha!’

“Can I discuss something with you?” Lin Xiu suddenly became attentive and smiled at Baili Haoling.

“What do you want?” Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu cautiously, feeling as though he was up to no good.

“If we meet other high level warriors, let me kill them after you defeat them,” Lin Xiu said.

‘If that is doable, won’t my level fly once i kill a few of them!?’

“You wish!” Baili Haoling snorted.

“This time, they were fortunately on the wanted list and I earned a bit of money. If we encounter more danger, you will take action on your own and I won’t help you.” Although he did not know what Lin Xiu’s plan was, Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu in disdain and with caution. He proceeded to take out a phone the thickness of a card, and after capturing a 3D photo of the two corpses, he loaded up the federal government website and uploaded the photos.

“Fine!”

Lin Xiu smirked, if Baili Haoling had agreed, it would be much better as he would level up faster.

But he decided to forgo it. After all, learning his own skills was the most important, otherwise he would not be able to unleash them even with a powerful body.

It was like playing an online game, even a fully equipped noob would not be able to defeat a player that had full control over the character.

“Let’s go, according to our speed, we should be at Black Sea CIty already!”

Baili Haoling was atop a tall tree and looked ahead as he shouted down to Lin Xiu.

But right at this moment, Lin Xiu heard a notification in the system and was stunned.
