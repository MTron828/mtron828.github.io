“Your battle suits are probably broken, you guys can pick one.”

Lin Xiu looked at these uniforms and said aloud.

The materials of these battle suits were much better than the ones from Shachang City and Changqing City.

But compared to the battle suits given by the system that Lin Xiu was wearing now, these were still not comparable.

“En, I want to take a look.”

At this time, Baili Haoling has already started to choose.

“You should also see if there is anything suitable.”

“I’ve reimbursed you all.”

Lin Xiu said to Lei Tong with a smile.

“Thank you, City Lord.”

Lei Tong was not pretentious and at this time he also started to choose a battle suit happily.

A good battle suit can block a lot of damage in battle.

Lin Xiu looked around. This shopping mall, which occupies a huge area, has all kinds of battle suits on the first floor alone.

There was everything from very high quality to mediocre ones.

And there were so many styles.

“I’ll go and have a look first, we’ll gather later.”

Lin Xiu searched around and saw the sign on the other side that said the second floor, which was dedicated to selling weapons.

“Sure.”

Baili Haoling and Lei Tong nodded when they heard Lin Xiu’s words.

After Lin Xiu took the elevator to the second floor, he suddenly felt that the surroundings were shining brightly, it was almost blinding.

Weapons, there were weapons everywhere.

Under the reflection of the surrounding lights, these weapons emitted various lights.

There were a lot of weapons and they were all classified according to different types.

Lin Xiu didn’t think much and walked directly to the long spears.

Now that the Dark Edge spear cannot be used, then he shall use other spears instead.

The quality of these spears was very good, but after taking them down and dancing them around, Lin Xiu frowned.

Light, still too light.

Still not good enough for Lin Xiu.

“Sir, what kind of weapon do you need? Here I can recommend one for you.”

Just as Lin Xiu kept trying weapons, a staff member came over and spoke to Lin Xiu.

“Is there any, heavier one?”

Lin Xiu said directly.

“Heavier ah…”

When the staff member heard Lin Xiu’s words and was about to introduce heavier weapons to Lin Xiu, he saw that the weapon Lin Xiu was holding was already the heaviest on display here.

This is still light?

“This weapon is too light.”

Lin Xiu waved the long spear in his hand, then said aloud.

“There are also heavy ones, but…”

The staff member quickly recovered from the surprise just now and showed a characteristic smile.

“bring it here.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

The staff member looked at Lin Xiu, thought for a while, then nodded.

“Please wait a moment.”

She saw that Lin Xiu was dressed in extraordinary clothes and that if he could wield such a heavy weapon, his strength must also be extraordinary. At this time, she went directly to the warehouse to find a heavier weapon for Lin Xiu.

Soon, with this staff member leading the way, two warriors were walking towards him, one behind the other, carrying the weapon with difficulty.

And these warriors were God warriors. At this time, the two of them were holding the weapons and they were both a little out of breath.

They seemed very tired.

It was a black weapon box. The two carried it and quickly placed it on the ground in front of Lin Xiu.

boom–

Soon, as the weapon box was placed on the ground, there was a dull sound.

Lin Xiu even felt that the ground shook slightly.

“This is the heaviest spear in our store and it’s called: White Moon.”

The staff member spoke to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu had brandished such a heavy spear before and said it was too light, so now she directly asked someone to take out the heaviest spear.

...

“En, let me see.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly, then squatted down and slowly opened the wooden box.

Squeak——

With a squeaky sound, the heavy wooden box was opened.

A dazzling light went into Lin Xiu’s eyes, causing Lin Xiu to narrow his eyes slightly.

Looking carefully, a silver spear lay on the soft brocade inside the wooden box.

Lin Xiu stretched out his hand and touched it. The spear body has many patterns, it felt a little strange to the touch. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

This long spear was excellent.

Almost, comparable to the Dark Edge spear.

Hu——

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and at the next moment, with a movement of his right hand, he directly grasped the spear and lifted it up.

...

The two God warriors who just came out carrying the spear looked surprised when they saw Lin Xiu pick up the spear with one hand.

Just now, the two warriors of the God warrior level were struggling to lift it.

Now Lin Xiu lifted it up with one hand.

“Hm?”

Lin Xiu frowned at this time, holding the spear in one hand, he clearly felt that it was heavier than the previous Dark Edge spear!

After vigorously dancing for a while, there were crackling sounds in the surrounding air.

“How heavy is this weapon?”

Lin Xiu looked at the staff member and said.

“11,000 jin.”

Although the staff member was shocked by how easily Lin Xiu wielded the weapon, she reacted quickly when she heard Lin Xiu’s words.

“good.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly. Although it was a bit heavy, it was only with such a heavy weapon that he could display his strength.

“I want this weapon.”

After Lin Xiu danced a few times, he suddenly said.

“This weapon is made of silver moonstone. It is the only one now. It needs 100 million energy stones.”

The staff member hesitated for a moment and said aloud.

Although Lin Xiu seems a bit imposing, the price of this weapon is indeed extremely expensive.

“A hundred million…”

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment, then nodded.

“I want it.”

“Okay, do you need anything else?”

When the staff member heard that Lin Xiu directly agreed, she was surprised.

Being able to sell such a high-priced weapon is also an excellent performance for her.

“Oh right, I still need boxing gloves. Also, I would like to look at the skill cards.”

Lin Xiu said at this time.

“Okay, I’ll have someone take the weapon down first, this way please.”

The staff member’s tone became even nicer at this time and she spoke in an incomparably respectful voice.

After looking at the warrior store for almost one night, Lin Xiu has already bought all the things that need to be bought.

Although there were many holy-level and god-level skill cards here, Lin Xiu still didn’t see any suitable ones.

Ultimately, he bought the White Moon spear and a pair of Silver Moon gloves.
