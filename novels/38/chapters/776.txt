Chapter 777: Fighting Qian Qiurong

“Do you know!”

“That’s the Amethyst Divine Water! And I know that it’s the most original Amethyst Divine Water. Once it disappears completely, it will never appear again!”

Qian Qiurong immediately roared when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

Those things are treasure-like existences and those liquids not only contain extremely strong energy, but they can also revive a dead person!

The thought of such a treasure of heaven and earth appearing in this cave and being drunk by Lin Xiu, made him feel extremely distressed.

And what made him even angrier was that Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear also seemed to have sucked in a lot of amethyst divine water from the cracks in the spear body.

Damn it!

“So, just die obediently.”

Qian Qiurong stared at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

“Qian Qiurong, what do you mean?” Liu Pan’s eyes widened at this time, looking at Qian Qiurong fiercely and said aloud.

He no longer had the polite expression on his face.

An Qi and Qian Lin also looked at Qian Qiurong with a wary expression on their faces.

“Want to kill me? Then try.”

At this time, Lin Xiu held his Dark Edge spear, then stood in front of Liu Pan and the others and said coldly to Qian Qiurong.

“Crazy!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Qian Qiurong’s face turned hideous.

With a roar, the strength of the whole body burst out. Holding the long sword in his hand, he rushed in front of Lin Xiu!

Because of the transmission of the source strength, at this moment, the long sword burst out with white light.

The long sword slashed straight down from top to bottom!

swoosh—

A sound of breaking the air suddenly sounded!

But Lin Xiu’s reaction speed was very fast. He held the two ends of the spear with both hands, then blocked the sword!

Dang–

After blocking his attack, Lin Xiu used force and sent the long sword flying.

At this moment, Qian Qiurong couldn’t help but take a few steps back, his eyes filled with a little surprise.

Because he now clearly felt how strong Lin Xiu is.

How can that be!

Even if he devoured those amethyst divine waters, it would be impossible for him to have such a big change in such a short period of time, right?

Could it be...

“You’re already a master warrior originally, right?”

Qian Qiurong said with a gloomy expression.

It turned out that the level of Lin Xiu’s strength he felt just now was false.

He must have concealed his strength to some extent.

“You don’t have to worry about that.”

Lin Xiu said lightly, in the next moment, as soon as his body moved, he rushed straight ahead!

This time, Lin Xiu used the body skill of ‘Without a Trace’ and the whole person was so fast that it seemed that shadows appeared.

What a fast speed!

When Qian Lin and An Qi saw this scene, they couldn’t help but exclaim.

Lin Xiu’s strength seemed to be getting stronger and stronger.

“Brother Lin, what level of a warrior are you...”

Looking at this scene, Liu Pan couldn’t help muttering to himself.

Seeing this scene, Qian Qiurong’s expression changed slightly.

He found that even he couldn’t sense Lin Xiu’s position.

swoosh—

And at this moment, the long spear that Lin Xiu stabbed instantly transformed into thousands of spear shadows.

It seems that it is impossible to distinguish between reality and illusion.

Dang dang- Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Qian Qiurong frantically swung the long sword in his hand, constantly resisting Li You Xu’s attacks.

The tip of the spear pierced his sword and sparks burst out.

And most importantly, he felt that the force of Lin Xiu’s stabbing spear was too strong, making his hand a little numb.

Impossible! How could this kid have such a powerful force!

“Get lost!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu continued to attack him, Qian Qiurong roared and in the next moment, the source of his body suddenly burst out.

A powerful impact came, causing Lin Xiu to take a few steps back.

At this time, Qian Qiurong seized the opportunity to retreat.

At the same time as he retreated to the back, the long sword in his hand flew out. As he swung his hands to either side, the long sword suddenly split into hundreds of thousands and all of them stabbed toward Lin Xiu!

“Die!!”

He roared and the long swords that flew over instantly made a swishing sound.

“Careful!”

When Liu Pan and others saw such a thrilling scene, they couldn’t help but exclaim.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly. He didn’t know why, but at this time, he had absolute confidence that he could defeat Qian Qiurong.

Moreover, the long swords that were stabbing at this time seemed very slow in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

Dang dang-

The long spear in his hand was constantly waving and the long spear resisted all those long swords that came in!

And looking at it carefully, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand seemed to be slowly changing as Lin Xiu’s source strength was transmitted.

“Look, Lin Xiu’s spear...”

Liu Pan looked at the battle over there and found that the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand had gradually become transparent.

It was like amethyst-colored glass, unusually gorgeous.

Lin Xiu also clearly felt this scene and was surprised at this time.

And the weight of the spear is also much heavier at this time!

Ordinary people would probably not be able to lift it at all, but for Lin Xiu, it really became easier.

Because as Lin Xiu’s strength continued to grow stronger, he also felt that the Dark Edge spear became lighter.

But now, why did it become like this again, Lin Xiu felt a little puzzled.

But without thinking much at this time, Lin Xiu continued to attack with the Dark Edge spear in his hand that had undergone a strange change!

When Qian Qiurong saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

Lin Xiu actually blocked the long sword and at the same time attacked him with the weapon in his hand!

Damn it!

He cursed angrily in his heart, stretched out his right hand and roared, “Come out!”

With his roar, a blue light burst out from his body, then spread directly to the surroundings, covering the ground.

Looking at the pattern formed by the blue light on the ground, Liu Pan and the others couldn’t help but be surprised.

“This is the domain force!?”

“It’s even able to cover such a far range!”

And after the domain force was released, An Qi and Qian Lin’s faces turned pale.

Because of the domain force, it seems to make people very uncomfortable.

It seems that Lin Xiu could suppress most of the strength of his body.

He couldn’t exert force at all!

But Lin Xiu just sneered at this time. Likewise, white light burst out from Lin Xiu’s body!
