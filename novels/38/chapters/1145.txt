1146 Facing a Warrior God.

Lin Xiu was caught off guard.

‘Silence’ was completely useless toward this man!

The old man was able to block out all of the black particles with the gold ‘sphere’.

What warrior skills was this?!

Lin Xiu quickly grabbed onto his long spear with both hands.

This old man was definitely the one who made him feel the most threatened after such a long time.

However, Lin Xiu did not feel scared.

In fact, he was feeling excited.

That’s right. It was exciting.

It has been a long time since he has met warriors who were so powerful?

Lin Xiu did not hesitate as he grabbed onto his long spear while rushing to the old man!

Xiu – –

Lin Xiu instantly appeared right in front of the old man by using ‘Flashing Souls’.

The long spear in his arm was aimed at the body of the old man!

Boom – –

As the tip of the long spear landed on the gold ‘sphere’, the old man’s body was pushed backwards because of the impact.

The old man was not injured but he couldn’t help but frown as well.

He could clearly feel that Lin Xiu was not an ordinary sage warrior.

Lin Xiu had the strength to be close to a warrior god!

“Bring me my sword!”

The old man didn’t want to be careless. He shouted as he reached out his left arm.

From one of the graves found at the cemetery, there was a gold sword that appeared suddenly.

Then, he grabbed onto it.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was about to attack him soon with the long spear, the old man sneered. He gently moved the gold sword in his hands and there was a terrifying sword aura that was released!

When Lin Xiu saw what was happening, his pupil shrank uncontrollably.

He started making the long spear in his arms as well.

He was hoping to defend himself from the terrifying sword aura.

But, the sword auras were too strong and they were all over Lin Xiu.

Unfortunately, Lin Xiu didn’t get to stop all of them.

One of the sword aura landed on his ‘sphere’ and that’s when his entire body was thrown into the air because of the strong impact!

As Lin Xiu flew into the air, the old man’s body flashed and he suddenly appeared behind Lin Xiu. The old man raised his sword above his head and then swung it downwards at Lin Xiu’s body!

Boom – –

The gold sword then landed on Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’.

But, he was unable to break Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’.

Lin Xiu’s body, which was still in the air, then landed heavily onto the ground.

Boom – –

Then, there was another loud explosion heard.

“Ancestor!!! You have to kill him!”

Bai Qi, who was on the other side, started screaming on top of his lungs. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

His eyes were blood red and those eyes were filled with murderous intentions.

“Shut up.”

The old man looked at the ground before saying it in a cold tone.

Due to how Lin Xiu had been thrown onto the ground, there was thick smoke everywhere.

As the old man looked downwards, he could see that there was a white figure that was getting closer to him.

Hmm?

The old man’s pupil shivered.

Without any assumption needed, this must be Lin Xiu.

How dare this young man still come at him?

“Damn it!”

The old man screamed and then waved his golden sword once again.

His sword was incredibly powerful.

As he moved it in the air, there were lots of cracks that appeared in the air.

Lin Xiu’s body was also sliced into multiple pieces because of his long sword.

Something’s wrong!

After killing ‘Lin Xiu’, he realised that something wasn’t right.

This was not the true Lin Xiu! This was a split image!

The old man quickly looked up and he saw multiple ‘Lin Xiu’ all around him.

All of them looked exactly like the true ‘Lin Xiu’.

It was impossible for him to differentiate them with his naked eyes.

Crap!

The old man had a bad feeling about it when he saw what was happening around him.

“All of you are dead!”

The old man roared as he drew an arc in the air with his sword.

Xiu – –

There was a bright arc that appeared in the air.

Then, it slowly expanded and covered the whole area.

Boom – –

At the very next moment, some of Lin Xiu’s split image instantly exploded!

Well, obviously none of these were the real Lin Xiu.

Although he was confident that he could kill Lin Xiu, it was obvious that Lin Xiu wasn’t someone that he could easily defeat.

“Be careful!”

The old man suddenly realised something and he screamed at Bai Qi.

The entire ground started shaking vigorously as the old man screamed.

Bai Qi was shocked when he heard the sound.

Just when he looked up, he suddenly realised that Lin XIu had somehow appeared right above him.

Lin XIu had the long spear in his arm and it was pointed at Bai Qi’s body!

Seeing what was happening, Bai Qi turned pale instantly.

‘Sphere’!

He could not hide and could only gather all of the energy in his body in order to release his ‘sphere’.

However, this time, the ‘sphere’ that he released was no match for Lin Xiu.

The long spear then instantly pierced through his ‘sphere’!

Noooooo!!!!

When Bai Qi saw what was happening, he screamed in fear.

“You’re….dead!”

With the long spear in his hands, he drove the long spear straight into Bai Qi’s head!

Boom – –

With a soft groan, there was blood everywhere.

Lin Xiu had intentionally tried to confuse the old man with his split images so that he could kill Bai Qi.

This was because the old man was too powerful. It was impossible for Lin Xiu to kill him.

He was a little short on his EXP in order to kill Bai Qi. He had to level up before he could do so!

“You’re asking for it!!!!”

The old man instantly appeared next to Lin Xiu when it happened.

There was also a bright light that appeared from Lin Xiu’s gold sword.

The sword pierced through Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’ and was driven into Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

“Leave!!!”

Lin Xiu screamed before raising one of his legs and kicking away the old man.

The gold sword that was in his shoulder was pulled away as well when the old man was kicked.

“Hmph!”

After getting kicked, the old man managed to steady himself.

The kick from Lin Xiu had no effect on him.

However, as he looked at Bai Qi’s body, his face looked terrible.

Boom boom – –

Then, there was a brown sourcemark that appeared on Lin Xiu’s forehead.
