Chapter 721 Hidden Danger

Because in this passage, no one knew if something would suddenly appear.

After all, they had experienced danger just now.

But if they kept walking behind, even if there was good stuff, someone else would take them.

So there were many people who were not afraid of death walking ahead.

“Dazzling purple stone weapon!”

On the two sides of the stone walls in front of the passage, at this time, a lot of weapons could were placed around.

Lin Xiu was stunned when he heard the exclamations of these people.

When he looked up the information about Marqi Planet before, Lin Xiu had already found out that the purple stone was a very special material. The hardness of this material was really terrifying and it also contained some kind of special power.

This dazzling purple stone was very precious and the weapons made with this dazzling purple stone were also extremely precious.

The people who snatch those Purple Gold skill Cards just now had learned their lesson, so they didn’t snatch the stones so rashly.

Some warriors saw that no one was going to take it so they dared to walk forward.

After all, the value of this kind of weapon made by dazzling purple stone was not lower than that of purple gold skill.

“Ah!!!”

But the second some warriors walked over, a large number of terrifying energy rays suddenly appeared around them, instantly penetrating the bodies of these warriors.

Wailing and screaming kept coming. “I knew it must be a scam.”

Qian Jin couldn’t help but feel chills down his spine, then muttered to himself.

Those warriors who ran over to take down the weapons embedded in the stone walls were all penetrated by those terrifying energy rays. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

There was no chance to unfold the ‘Sphere’ at all.

“You want these weapons?”

Lin Xiu smiled at Qian Jin.

“I don’t want to die so soon.”

Qian Jin shook his head, those energy rays were really terrifying.

Even if the ‘Sphere’ was unfolded, they didn’t know if these energy rays would break even the ‘Sphere’.

Although the dazzling purple stone weapon was very valuable, it was not suitable for everyone.

“Let’s continue to move forward. There must be more to these things in Legacy Land.”

Huangji, who had been silent since the beginning, spoke up at this time.

“Ok.”

Jiang Jun also nodded, agreeing with his words.

The rest of the warriors also found that as long as they didn’t touch those weapons, there would be no terrifying energy rays shooting out from those stone walls.

Many warriors had left and continued on their way, but there were still many warriors who stayed and were studying how to remove these weapons.

After all, these were all weapons made of dazzling purple stone, their value was too high and the temptation was too great.

The passage was very long and there were more than 100 warriors, still continuing to walk forward.

There were too many warriors coming this time. Although a lot of them died, there were still so many.

And the strength of these remaining warriors was not weak at all.

The lowest rank was the rank 9.

“This…how do we walk?”

After walking for a long time, they found that the surrounding ground has become wider.

And looking to the front, there were ten round passages!

The entrance of the passage was pitch black and no one knew what was inside.

“How do we choose?”

“It feels weird…”

The surrounding warriors were all discussing at this time.

After all, after going through what happened before, everyone already has a certain understanding of the legacy land.

There were quite a few traps in this place and these traps were very lethal.

One accident and you would lose your life.

So facing the row of ten circular passages that appeared in front of them, more than a hundred warriors did not move.

“Brothers, let’s choose this path.”

Finally, there was still a warrior who couldn’t help it. At this time, he pointed to the third channel and said.

“Alright, my lucky number is three, it should be fine.”

Seeing that the group of five or six warriors had already walked towards the third passage, the rest of them began to lose their patience.

“Mr. Huang, where should we go?”

Jiang Jun also said to Huangji at this time.

“Let’s also choose a route to go.”

Huangji was silent for a while, then said aloud.

There must be some mystery in these ten routes, but they couldn’t see it now.

You can only choose one of them like the other warriors.

“Everyone follow closely, let’s go now!”

Jiang Jun looked at the people behind him and said aloud.

It seemed that he was going to lead the crowd to the eighth route.

“Can’t go now.”

But at this moment, Lin Xiu said aloud.

“Humph!”

When Huangji heard Lin Xiu’s words, he snorted coldly.

“Do you think you know this place…”

Just as Huangji was showing a mocking sneer at Lin Xiu, a loud noise suddenly came over.

Boom

The passage of the third route just now was bursting with flames.

After the people who had just entered let out a wailing scream, there was no more sound.

“They… they died?”

A young warrior said with a trembling body at this time.

This sudden flame was so terrifying, who would have thought that such a thing would suddenly appear in this passage.

Those who originally wanted to step to other passages were shocked when they saw this scene.

Now no one dared to walk.

Huangji’s expression also solidified at this time.

“Let’s not go anywhere first.”

Looking at the terrifying scene in the third channel, Jiang Jun felt a chill down his spine.

If he took one more step, he would really step into the entrance of the eighth passage.

If there was such a terrifying flame like the third passage, he would probably be melted.

“You guys, get in.”

At this moment, a middle-aged man spoke to several warriors next to him.

“I won’t enter, I’m not a fool!”

The warriors said aloud.

Such a thing has just happened and they would never set foot into the passages so easily until they understand what will happen to these ten passages. After all, no one wanted to give up their life in vain.

“I’ll let you go.”

The middle-aged man looked at him and continued to speak lightly.

“Move aside!”

The man cursed loudly.

Boom–

In the next moment, he saw a flash of cold light and his head fell directly.

Blood splashed all over the ground.

“I’ll repeat – you guys get in.” The middle-aged man continued to speak to the other warriors.

“Who is this guy…”

When a warrior on Lin Xiu and the others’ side saw this scene, he couldn’t help trembling

This person was really too terrifying. If you don’t agree with him, he would kill you directly.
