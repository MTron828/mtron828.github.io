Chapter 531: Explosion!

“Curious, huh?” Lin Xiu said in a low voice with killing intent in his eyes.

“You…” The warrior looked at Lin Xiu as if he had seen a ghost.

Now he finally understood. Lin Xiu used a skill just now and a fake Lin Xiu appeared.

“Go to hell!!!”

Now that he had no way out, he held the long sword in his hand and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu was also fuming in his heart. Before he could rush over, Lin Xiu charged over!

Although the man swung his sword fast, Lin Xiu turned slightly and dodged.

And at this time, Lin Xiu’s right hand was clenched into a fist and there was a lot of lightning around it.

While dodging his attack, Lin Xiu smashed his fist directly on the sphere he unfolded!

Bang bang bang-

A dull sound kept ringing.

Although he unfolded the ‘Sphere’ to protect his body, he still retreated constantly because of the terrifying power coming from Lin Xiu’s fist.

Lin Xiu looked at the Dark Edge spear on the ground not far away and as soon as his right foot stepped on the bottom end of the Dark Edge spear, the entire Dark Edge spear flew up.

He stretched out his right hand and caught the Dark Edge spear. At the same time, the pattern on the spear instantly lit up because Lin Xiu’s source strength was transmitted to the spear body.

“Get lost!”

Lin Xiu looked at the man holding the long sword trying to resist his attack and roared, the spearhead directly pierced a hole through his long sword.

And it wasn’t over yet, the spear didn’t stop and continued to stab forward.

Although this man was frightened, but relying on his ‘Sphere’ protection, he dodged without panicking.

Boom–

But after the spear stabbed his Sphere, he was shocked to find that there was a hole in his “Sphere” and in the next moment, the spear went through the “Sphere” and went straight into his heart.

“Goodbye.” Lin Xiu said coldly.

It’s impossible… The man said to himself in disbelief, looking at the Dark Edge spear pierced into his heart.

“Hahaha…” But in the next second, the man laughed again, causing Lin Xiu to frown.

Di di di-

However, Lin Xiu, who had sensitive ears, seemed to hear a very subtle sound at this time and his eyes widened immediately.

This guy’s heart seems to have… a bomb?!

Boom—

Lin Xiu didn’t have time to think. At the next moment, a loud noise rang out and a terrifying explosion occurred directly on the man’s body.

“Ah!”

The surrounding warriors led by Jiang Tao were all blown away by this terrifying explosion!

In an instant, thick dust flew around him.

“Lin… Xiu…” Luo Yue’s voice trembled a little while watching this scene.

This terrifying explosion, even a high-level warrior, at close range, would be seriously injured if not dead!

At this time, Luo Yue rushed towards the front frantically!

As soon as she rushed into the blast zone with thick dust, Luo Yue felt her body being embraced by someone.

Just when she was about to struggle, she heard a familiar voice, “It’s really dangerous…”

Hearing this voice, Luo Yue’s gaze changed and there was a hint of surprise on her face.

“You… are you okay?” Luo Yue didn’t know what to say. She has never felt this emotion before.

And being hugged by Lin Xiu like this, Luo Yue’s hands were hanging in the air as if she was at a loss.

“It’s nothing.” Lin Xiu said with a smile.

There was a trace of fresh blood on his body but this was caused by the damage to the surface skin.

Under normal circumstances, he would have been seriously injured if not dead from the explosion just now. Who would have thought that such a terrifying bomb was placed in this guy’s heart.

Fortunately, his reaction speed was fast enough and the ‘Sphere’ unfolded instantly, but even so, the terrifying impact made Lin Xiu’s head dizzy and his body had many wounds.

“By the way, the wound on your neck…” Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something at this time, then quickly released Luo Yue and said to Luo Yue.

However, Lin Xiu took a closer look and found that the wound on Luo Yue’s neck has now begun to heal!?

“My self-healing ability is relatively strong.” Luo Yue seemed to know what Lin Xiu was thinking and said aloud at this time.

“That’s good.” Lin Xiu breathed a sigh of relief at this time.

“Brother Lin, are you alright?” Jiang Tao was blown away by the dust at this time and kept coughing.

“I’m fine, let’s see if they’re fine.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

As the dust slowly dissipated, a huge crater appeared where the explosion happened.

“We often come here, this kind of injury is nothing.” Jiang Tao said with a grin.

He looked at Lin Xiu, his eyes were full of surprise that could not be concealed.

The explosion just now caused ordinary warriors to be blown away, but Lin Xiu was only slightly injured – he must have unfolded the ‘Sphere’ in time.

But this reaction ability was so fast that it was almost perverted.

At this time, Lin Xiu turned his eyes to the back and saw Bai Fei slowly get up, as if he wanted to escape.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s expression changed and the Dark Edge spear he was holding was thrown straight away!

Swoosh—

The spear made a sound of breaking through the air and stabbed directly in front of Bai Fei!

Bai Fei, who was about to escape, saw the long spear suddenly stabbed in front of him, his body trembled, his legs softened and he sat on the ground. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Where are you going?” Lin Xiu walked over slowly at this time. Seeing that Bai Fei wanted to get up and run again, he stepped on his chest and said coldly.

“Let me go, I’m the son of the Royal Beast Sect, I’ll get my dad to give you whatever you want!” Bai Fei’s body trembled at this time, then he said quickly.

“Young master of the Royal Beast Sect?” Jiang Tao was also shocked when he heard Bai Fei’s words.

It was only at this time that he realized why so many rank 6 warriors were protecting Bai Fei. It turns out that this guy is the son of the Sect Master of the Royal Beast Sect!

“Top ranking odd Crystals, Skill Cards, or Weapons, I can give you anything you want!!!”

Bai Fei continued to speak.

He didn’t want to die!

And he had already thought about it, as long as he got to live, he would definitely take revenge on Lin Xiu!!!

“Do you think I’ll let you go?” Lin Xiu said lightly, his eyes full of killing intent.

When he was at the Sanctuary Academy, he sometimes couldn’t kill the person because of the academy’s rules, but at this time, he didn’t have to care so much!

“You’re going to die!!! A rank 8 warrior from our Royal Beast Sect is in Black Rock City! If I die, you won’t be able to live either!”

Looking at Lin Xiu’s eyes full of murderous intent, Bai Fei said with a grim expression.
