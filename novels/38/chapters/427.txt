Chapter 428: Analyze Skill Cards!

Lin Xiu noticed at this time that the window in his room was open.

“Did the two of you sneak out from here and steal someone else’s odd crystals?”

Lin Xiu gave them a helpless look and said.

He quickly closed the window at this time, otherwise, he would be in trouble if others knew.

But Rollie and Xiao Bai were still eating the odd crystals happily.

“Don’t steal from others in the future, I will buy some back.”

Lin Xiu rubbed his forehead helplessly, then said to them.

“Squeak——”

“Gu gu——”

These two little things made a sound as if they understood Lin Xiu’s words.

Lin Xiu smiled, then walked out of the room and returned to the hall again.

He took out the two cards just now.

“I must learn this body skill card tonight.” Lin Xiu mumbled as he looked at the diamond body skill card.

Just like before, Lin Xiu put the diamond skill card on his forehead. In the next moment, with the body’s source strength running, the diamond skill card shone brightly.

“Huh?” But Lin Xiu was puzzled – he was unable to extract the information on this skill card!

Lin Xiu was taken aback, then tried a few more times and found that the information in this skill card seemed very difficult to extract.

Lin Xiu just faintly felt that there was information pouring into his mind, but in the next moment, the information was retracted again.

And the source strength in his body seemed to have been absorbed by this skill card again. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Damn!”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but curse internally. No wonder Ouyang Hang had given him this body skill card so easily – this guy did it on purpose.

Damn, what should I do?

The competition was the next day and Lin Xiu wanted to rely on this opportunity to learn this thing well.

“Ding! An abnormality is found, do you want to use ‘Analytic Eye’?”

Just as Lin Xiu was at a loss, he still put this skill card on his forehead, unconvinced.

But this time, Lin Xiu heard the system prompt in his mind.

What does it mean?

Lin Xiu was taken aback when he heard the sound. At this moment, he quickly entered the system interface, hesitated a little, and clicked directly to confirm.

“During the analysis, please don’t leave the analysis source…”

“1%…”

“1.1%…”

At this moment, Lin Xiu saw that the system in his mind had entered the so-called analysis interface.

This was the first time Lin Xiu had seen this situation.

Isn’t the Analytic Eye only able to analyze this thing? What’s happening now?

Lin Xiu was surprised at this time.

Could it be that it was because he had become rank 6 and these system skills became stronger too?

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, then closed his eyes and paid attention to the system interface while running ‘Cultivation Technique’.

After some time, there was a clear ‘ding’ sound.

“The analysis is complete!”

“It’s done!?” Seeing the words “Analysis Complete” displayed on the system interface, Lin Xiu was immediately surprised.

At this time, when Lin Xiu opened his eyes, he could clearly see the clock on the wall opposite to him – it was already past 3 in the morning.

A few hours of analysis…

He shall try it first.

Lin Xiu looked at the skill card in his hand, took a deep breath at this time, then continued to put the skill card on his forehead. As the source strength was released, he could clearly feel a lot of information rushing into his mind instantly!

As a large amount of information poured into his head for an instant, Lin Xiu felt that his head was squeezed by the information and it was painful.

Lin Xiu clenched his teeth tightly, bearing the information that was constantly pouring into his mind as he continued releasing source strength.

In this situation, Lin Xiu must not pass out because of the flood of information in his mind.

Otherwise, it would be over for him!

“Phew.” It took about half an hour before Lin Xiu opened his eyes and there was a hint of surprise in his eyes.

Because Lin Xiu clearly felt the power of this skill.

“Wonderful, it’s really wonderful!”

Lin Xiu, who felt this. couldn’t help but get excited at this time.

It was truly the 11th skill card in the world, too powerful!

Lin Xiu forcibly suppressed the excitement, then took out another skill card.

‘Bodybuilding Technique’!

This lost skill card was now invaluable!

Lin Xiu didn’t know why this card was hidden there and it actually let him find it.

Without thinking any more, at this moment, Lin Xiu put this resplendent skill card on his forehead and continued to absorb the information in this head.

Just the same as before, there was no way to absorb the information normally.

However, Lin Xiu’s ‘Analytic Eye’ could directly violently crack it!

Time went by and by the next day, Lin Xiu was still in this hall.

And at this time, Lin Xiu still maintained a very strange movement and seemed to be asleep at this time.

Luo Yue walked down early in the morning and saw Lin Xiu lying on the ground with his feet and legs stretched out very exaggeratedly.

“It’s the morning ah…”

And when Lin Xiu opened his eyes, he could feel Luo Yue walking down.

Looking at Luo Yue who was walking down, Lin Xiu smiled and yawned.

“Why are you in such an ugly pose…” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu like she was looking at an idiot.

“Ahem.” Lin Xiu was a little embarrassed. This was the message on the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’, which stated various strange postures.

There were some postures that could only be done by people without ligaments.

And holding this posture, then practicing ‘Cultivation Technique’, it seemed that the speed of cultivation had increased a little.

“Alright, I won’t go to the training room today.” Lin Xiu slowly stood up at this time, his body aching.

“Not going?” Luo Yue said a little puzzled.

After all, the battle with the North Campus was at this afternoon!
