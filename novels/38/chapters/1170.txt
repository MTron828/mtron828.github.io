1171 Treasure

What is this!?

The surrounding warriors opened their eyes wide and their eyes were full of surprise.

“Divine mark.”

Zhao Laosan looked at everything around him and he could not help frowning.

It is really strange that there are so many divine marks in this entire space.

Lin Xiu also glanced around.

There was also a hint of surprise in his eyes.

Each of these Divine Marks around this place seems to have extremely strong power.

This Bai Lingxian was really a strange person.

It would be nice if he could also learn the so-called Divine mark himself.

From the previous battle, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the power of these divine marks.

“Treasure! Treasure here!”

At this time, an excited voice came from the other side.

When Lin Xiu heard the sound, he looked towards the source of the sound.

Taking a closer look, he could see that there was a dazzling light in the front.

Among those rays of light, there were many transparent square glass frames.

These glass frames were suspended in the air and there were skill cards, Odd crystals and various rare materials in them.

It looks exciting.

Some warriors couldn’t help but reach out and touch it.

boom–

But when they touched these transparent glass boxes, there were lines of divine marks that lighted up.

It seems that the divine marks on those glass boxes were directly triggered because of their touch!

“what!!!”

Originally, those warriors who were extremely excited actually let out a wail at this time.

Those Divine Marks burst out all kinds of terrifying attribute powers such as flames, frost and electricity, which directly hit their unsuspecting bodies.

“A bunch of fools.”

When Zhao Laosan saw this scene, he couldn’t help but sneer.

From the very beginning, so many divine marks had appeared on this relic. It was expected that there must be more hidden divine marks in this place.

This so-called ‘treasure’ was obviously a trap.

“You, go over and help me get all those things.”

At this moment, Zhao Laosan looked at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

Now, he already thinks that Lin Xiu was a very powerful Divine Marker.

As for these divine marks, Lin Xiu should all be able to decipher them.

“Zhao Laosan, I’m in control of him and these things naturally belong to my Luanxuan Palace.”

Ye Yu sneered when he heard Zhao Laosan’s words at this time.

“Just because you say they’re yours, they’ll be yours?”

At this moment, Zhao Laosan sneered and said.

There were too many treasures, even Zhao Laosan wants to get them.

Ye Yu’s face sank at this time.

Not only is Zhao Laosan strong and powerful, but behind him is a force no weaker than Luan Xuan palace.

If he really wanted to fight, Ye Yu didn’t have a 100% chance of winning.

“half each.”

Ye Yu had no choice but to say this at this time.

“Fine.”

Zhao Laosan is also tactful, so he nodded and agreed.

Lin Xiu sneered when he saw this scene.

These people, did they really think that Lin Xiu was at their mercy?

“Go, decode all those divine marks and take out the things.”

Ye Yu looked at Lin Xiu and said lightly.

He didn’t allow Lin Xiu to refute. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Lin Xiu didn’t speak at this time and walked straight ahead.

Now, he still needed to wait for a good time to deal with these two.

At this time, Lin Xiu, who walked to the front, looked at the skill Cards in the glass boxes, all of them were holy-level skill Cards.

Lin Xiu watched this scene and the pupils in his eyes shrank a little.

There were so many holy-level skill cards!

And there were also many Odd crystals with extremely strong energy fluctuations.

Is this… a beast god-level odd crystal?

Lin Xiu was even more surprised when he saw this scene.

What kind of God warrior is this Bai Lingxian? Not only can he build such a ruin, but the things inside it were also too surprising.

“Hurry up!”

Zhao Laosan saw that Lin Xiu was standing there and did not move and immediately shouted fiercely.

Lin Xiu glanced at him and at this moment, he slowly began to reach out and touch the glass boxes.

Following Lin Xiu’s touch, a divine mark immediately appeared on the glass frame, emitting a faint glow.

But the difference from before is that the power of these divine marks did not seem to be released because of Lin Xiu’s touch.

Lin Xiu’s hand radiated source strength and when he touched those divine marks, he moved in a special trajectory.

Soon, those divine marks began to be decoded by Lin Xiu one by one.

Looking at the divine marks on the glass boxes, they disappeared one after another. Ye Yu and Zhao Laosan both stared at the things in those boxes.

“half each.”

Zhao Laosan and Ye Yu seemed to know what the other was thinking at this time. After looking at each other, they said lightly.

As Lin Xiu deciphered the divine marks in the glass boxes, the two of them walked over and took out all the treasures in the glass boxes suspended in the air.

When Lin Xiu saw this scene out of the corner of his eyes, he sneered inwardly.

You guys can keep these things for now.

The surrounding warriors looked at this scene and their eyes were full of enthusiasm.

Ye Yu and Zhao Laosan captured so many treasures. Although they were upset, they couldn’t do anything about it.

The forces behind these two are not only great, but they were also warriors at the level of god warrior.

Soon, after Lin Xiu cracked all the divine marks on these glass boxes, they also took away all the treasures inside.

“Boy, very good, if you are interested, join our Manhuang Palace.”

Zhao Laosan got a lot of treasures at this time and he was in a good mood.

Looking at Lin Xiu, who helped them decipher those divine marks, he said.

“No.”

Lin Xiu immediately refused.

“How about coming to my Luanxuan Palace? With your Divine Mark ability, you will definitely have a place in our Luanxuan Palace.”

Ye Yu also said aloud at this time.

Lin Xiu shook his head and didn’t say much.

This made Zhao Laosan and Ye Yu frown.

In their opinion, Lin Xiu should be eager to join their forces, but they did not expect that Lin Xiu would refuse.

Although they didn’t say anything at this time, there was already a faint killing intent in their eyes.

Since this kind of Divine Marker cannot be used by them, they can only kill him directly after using him.

Cut the weeds and remove the roots.

“Okay, let’s continue to move ahead. Bai Lingxian was a powerful Divine Marker when he was alive and he definitely left more behind.”

Ye Yu looked to the front, then said lightly.

At this time, there were still quite a few warriors walking behind them.

They were now just taking a chance, perhaps they could get something and it would not be a waste of time.
