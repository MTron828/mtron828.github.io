Chapter 7: Unanalyzable Mutated Python

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Hou!” That zombie let out a howl, and its fingers became extremely sharp. It then pounced toward Lin Xiu.

As Lin Xiu had just attacked and killed those zombies, his body was already soaked with fresh blood.

He seemed exceptionally horrifying!

Lin Xiu wanted to dodge quickly, but that Boss Zombie was too quick. With a bang, the zombie pounced on Lin Xiu and he fell to the ground. Then, the zombie opened its blood-filled mouth and wanted to bite Lin Xiu on the neck.

Damn!

Lin Xiu pulled back his legs and pressed against the zombie’s abdomen area as he grabbed its wrists and refused to let it bite him.

“Do you know that your breath stinks?” Lin Xiu yelled while gritting his teeth.

Yang Tian was still killing those zombies who kept coming over and didn’t have a chance to care about Lin Xiu.

Oh right, he killed so many zombies just now, how many times did he level up!?

Lin Xiu had a sudden realization and nearly forgot about it when he was busy killing the zombies.

He took a quick glance and saw that he had already reached level 5!

Also, he had 12 potential points!

“Use them all on strength!” Lin Xiu shouted. His strength immediately rose from 38 to 50 at this moment!

A powerful force surged into Lin Xiu’s body instantly.

He had already reached the strength of a beginner warrior.

“What!?” Yang Tian heard Lin Xiu’s shout and instinctively turned toward him.

All he saw was that as Lin Xiu yelled the words “get lost”, he kicked hard and directly sent that zombie flying.

Actually, with Lin Xiu’s current strength, he wouldn’t be able to kill that zombie so easily. But because one of that zombie’s arms had been chopped off by Zhang Yi and even though it had attached it back, its physical strength seemed to have weakened.

Lin Xiu pursued and attacked, then picked up the battle blade from the ground and charged over!

“Go to hell!”

That zombie clearly didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would charge over like that and stab its chest directly.

It howled loudly, then tried to grab Lin Xiu with its arms.

Lin Xiu quickly took a step back and dodged easily.

This was indeed the Boss Zombie – it wasn’t completely dead yet and was still struggling on the ground.

Lin Xiu’s forehead was covered in cold sweat as the zombie’s sharp nails nearly scratched his neck.

Had that happened, there would be a risk of getting infected.

Lin Xiu kicked the zombie’s leg hard and caused it to fall to the ground. Then, he stepped on its chest with his right foot and quickly ended the fight by chopping off its head!

The zombie finally stopped struggling after its head was chopped off.

“Ding~~”

“Congratulations Master on killing a Boss Zombie. You’ve leveled up to level 6 and unlocked gene lock system.”

“Congratulations Master on receiving 6 potential points.”

Lin Xiu panted heavily on the ground and looked at his own attributes in his mind:

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: 6

Experience: 0 (100 experience is required for the next level)

Strength: 50

Physique: 35

Speed: 32

(Note: An average person scores at least 38 for each segment)

Skill: Analytic Eye

Rage build-up: 0/100

Overall combat strength: 380

‘Combat strength is already 380?’ Lin Xiu was delighted, but he immediately felt that this system was simply full of malice. Previously, it was 250 and this time, it actually reached 380 in half the match.

It was simply mocking him!

Lin Xiu thought about it carefully. He couldn’t just keep adding on to his strength. If he didn’t enhance his speed and physique, it would greatly affect his combat strength.

He merely fought for a while just now and was already gasping for air.

After considering it for a moment, he added three potential points to his physique, allowing his physique to reach an ordinary person’s level.

Then, he added another three points to speed and allowed his speed to reach 35.

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked down and at the bottom of the system frame, there were many icons that looked like they were locked with chains.

“Gene lock!?” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Humans are the most complicated animals.

In the human gene, there’s a large portion that isn’t in use and has great potential, but it has never been stimulated by humans. The so-called gene lock refers to the most basic potential in the human body and it was said that when one unlocks the genes in one’s body to the extreme, one would become god-like.

Lin Xiu held his breath and tapped on the first gene lock icon with his mind.

“Warning, have not reached level 15, unable to unlock.”

‘Damn it!’ Lin Xiu cursed internally, but he just needed to continue killing these zombies to reach level 15, and it shouldn’t take too long. With that thought, Lin Xiu got stirred up once again.

“Lin Xiu, are you alright?” At this moment, Yang Tian who had already dealt with those zombies immediately walked toward Lin Xiu.

“I’m fine.” Lin Xiu shook his head and stood up.

The smell of the blood on his body was really disgusting.

Yang Tian was a little surprised that Lin Xiu actually killed that Boss Zombie without much difficulty.

Also, he could sense that there seemed to be some changes in Lin Xiu’s body. It was as though he had suddenly become much stronger.

“Let’s go, we’ll continue looking inside,” said Lin Xiu.

Right now, his strength was almost at the same level as a beginner warrior and if they went in, it would be much easier to deal with those zombies.

“En.” Yang Tian nodded.

Both of them continued venturing deeper and very soon, they saw a sign ahead. It read: “Beginner warriors are forbidden from entering.”

“Seems like this is the prohibited area that Teacher Luo had mentioned.”

“Let’s not go in…”

Lin Xiu frowned; they didn’t see any zombies along the way, and there wasn’t a chance of gaining experience.

Should we go in and take a look?

“Lin… Lin Xiu…” When Lin Xiu was in deep thoughts, Yang Tian seemed to have seen something. He tugged at Lin Xiu’s arm as he trembled and spoke.

“What is it?” Lin Xiu was stunned. Then, he looked in the direction of Yang Tian’s eyes and his eyes widened.

There was a snake on the tree over there; it was a huge python!!!

This python had red eyes and its body was as thick as a barrel. Also, it seemed to be able to change its color with the surroundings.

No wonder he didn’t notice it just now.

‘This is the so-called evolved beast?’

Analytic Eye!

“Rank 3 color-changing python; Traits: ??? Strength: ???”

Unanalyzable? What the hell!

Lin Xiu was frightened. This was the very first time he had encountered something that couldn’t be analyzed.

“Run, quick.” Lin Xiu broke out in cold sweat and called out as he immediately escaped.
