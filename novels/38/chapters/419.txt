Chapter 420: Ten Seconds

But this time, Zhu Jun couldn’t react in time.

Bump–

Lin Xiu was holding the Dark Edge spear in both hands and with a sudden force, he sent Zhu Jun flying!

But Zhu Jun’s reacted quickly. At this moment, he instantly unfolded ‘Sphere’ around his body.

He thought it would be able to withstand Lin Xiu’s attack, but at this moment, the spear body slammed on the ‘Sphere’ and an extremely powerful force was instantly generated.

At this moment, Zhu Jun’s body just flew out like a volleyball that was hit hard.

“Careful!”

Those people sitting on the seats at this time panicked and dodge quickly.

Boom——

At this moment, Zhu Jun’s body crashed into the seat and the seat was damaged by the impact.

Because of the powerful impact, ‘Sphere’ couldn’t be used anymore.

His whole body was hit and his face was bruised and swollen.

“Zhu Jun… was defeated?” Seeing this scene, Class 1 was shocked.

At the same time, Luo Yue still seemed to be doing well under the attack of four members of Class 1.

“Damn it!” The people in this class were anxious at this time.

Lin Xiu knocked Zhu Jun away and none of them knocked Luo Yue down.

If Lin Xiu also joined the battle at this time, their situation would be dangerous!

“Do you need my help?” Lin Xiu laughed as he looked at the four people from Class 1 fighting against Luo Yue, who was dodging their attacks easily.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue said plainly, “No.”

“Alright, one minute, it should be enough.” Lin Xiu nodded, then stood aside watching the battle scene on Luo Yue’s side and continued to laugh.

One minute?

When the four people in that class heard Lin Xiu’s words, their faces became extremely nasty.

They were all from Class 1 after all and those four people were rank 5 warriors yet they couldn’t even get rid of a girl from Class 10. This was utterly embarrassing!

With this thought, these people roared, then burst out in strength.

Gold skill – ‘Force Split’!!!

“Gold skill – ‘Scary Sword’!!!”

These four warriors all used their strongest skills and attacked Luo Yue from all directions at the same time! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Boom boom——

At this moment, the platform shook violently because of the skills used.

Surrounded by those magnificent skills, Luo Yue couldn’t be seen for a while.

“Hahaha, a group of four experts using top skills at the same time, does she still think that she could dodge them!?” The group of people clenched their fists at this time and said excitedly.

Lin Xiu stood aside without the intention to help which greatly agitated them.

Arrogant, too arrogant!

As long as they knock Luo Yue out, the four of them could attack Lin Xiu and their class would be able to win!

Just when the people from Class 1 fell into the illusion of victory, in the next moment, a dull sound rang instantly.

Bang bang bang——

At this moment, a group of figures flew down from the platform.

Seeing these four people all fly down and hit the ground wailing, everyone in Class 1 was dumbfounded.

Everyone was in shock.

At this time, they looked ahead and Luo Yue was still standing at the same spot, the long sword in her hand didn’t appear to have moved at all.

Got rid of them within seconds!

“Done in 10 seconds.” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue, then smiled and said aloud.

“Yeah, a little slow.” Luo Yue nodded.

At this time, because the surroundings became silent, the voices of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were also heard by many people.

The faces of the people in the Class 1 have become extremely ugly.

Four rank 5 warriors were dealt with in ten seconds – this is still considered slow?

With this thought, they all wanted to die.

“It seems that your strength has recovered…” On the seat at the corner of the platform, a man smiled and muttered to himself as he looked at Luo Yue.

Luo Yue, who was standing on the platform, frowned slightly at this time, then appeared to be looking for something.

“What’s wrong?” Lin Xiu subconsciously said when he saw Luo Yue’s movements.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue shook her head.

The feeling of being secretly observed just now made Luo Yue very uncomfortable.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue.

“En.”

As Lin Xiu stepped down the platform, at this moment, there was a burst of sound like a tide from the entire martial arts field.

This battle was really beyond their expectations.

“This is truly a record that no one will be able to break in the future…” Nan Zhengjun couldn’t help but stand up excitedly at this time.

Everyone knew that there would be benefits from this competition. Logically speaking, the rewards for each class were based on rankings.

Class 1 would definitely get the best reward and the best resources should be given to this group of top talents.

But nobody expected that Class 10 would win!

This has never happened in the entire history of the Sacred Region Academy.

“Congratulations.” Nan Zhengjun walked directly to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue who had jumped off from the platform.

“Teacher Nan, you said it as if we were going to get married.” Lin Xiu said with a smile at this moment.

As soon as he said that, Lin Xiu’s expression turned ugly because Luo Yue had stepped on his foot.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu forced a smile.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s smile that was even uglier than crying, Nan Zhengjun couldn’t help but laugh.

However, there were more difficulties and obstacles Lin Xiu and this girl would face in the future than imaginable…

“Awesome! Lin Xiu!” Zhang Yin and others also walked over at this time.

They thought it would not be so easy to win, but they didn’t expect that they got the victory in such a short period of time.

At this moment, the others from Class 10 also crowded over, looking very excited.

All the people in Class 1 became silent and left the place quickly.

They were completely embarrassed this time!

This battle was over in just three minutes!
