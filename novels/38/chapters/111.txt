Chapter 112: T-Rex Leech!

Lin Xiu used his right feet to touch a tree branch and flipped his body. He charged ahead with the momentum and arrived at another tree branch to kill another Black Tiger Bandit.

In a short span of a few minutes, Lin Xiu killed off many of the Black Tiger Bandit ambushers.

It was a total of 6 snipers that gave him a total of 700,000 experience points!

His current stats board showed:

Experience: 3839635 (1500000 experience points required for the next level)

Another 1.5 million experience points and he would level up again!

Upon thinking of this, Lin Xiu felt sad that there were very few rank 2 warriors.

“They’re all dead?” Tian Zhi looked around inconceivably. There were many dead warrior corpses on the ground, all of which had their heads exploded. It was a gruesome sight.

‘Isn’t it too fast?’

‘I only killed one but he got rid of the rest?!’

“Is this part of Black Tiger Bandit’s territory?” Lin Xiu looked over at Tian Zhi and asked.

Tian Zhi replied after thinking for a moment, “I’m not too sure about this, but I do know that there are many warriors inside Azure Forest. A few of them who harbor malicious intentions wait here for newcomers and plunder from them.”

“So which way now?”

The Azure Forest looked the same in all directions as though there was no end to it.

More importantly, the surrounding trees looked alike. They were all blue with the same type of leaves without any variations.

The grass on the ground were azure blue as well and looked extremely unique.

But all of this only disorientated the warriors even more.

People unfamiliar with the place would get lost easily and would not even know which way to return to, and so they would die in Azure Forest.

“Zeze, I almost got lost the last time I was here, but I grew smarter.” Tian Zhi smiled happily when he heard Lin Xiu’s words and took out a spherical object from his bag.

“A compass?” Lin Xiu looked at the object that reminded him of a compass in his previous world and asked.

“No, this is a unique one. This place affects magnetism so a compass is useless.” Tian Zhi shook his head and continued, “This object will point towards the location with the strongest magnetism.”

“The magnetism of Azure Forest gets stronger the closer we are to the center. With this, we won’t get lost!” Tian Zhi smiled and explained.

Lin Xiu nodded his head, it seemed that moving with Tian Zhi was a wise move on his part, otherwise, he would find himself in a dilemma within the forest.

They did not locate any other figures as they continued ahead and not a single evolved beast was present.

But Lin Xiu had an inkling that the Black Tiger Bandits would appear again. He remained cautious and did not loosen his guard.

Roar-

Right then, Lin Xiu suddenly heard a loud roar.

The surrounding leaves rustled and looked as though they were trembling from the roar.

“What is that?” Lin Xiu frowned and asked.

Just from the sound, Lin Xiu was sure that it was no ordinary creature and most probably a high-level evolved beast.

“I don’t know.” Tian Zhi became anxious. After all, he was not a high-rank warrior and was already nervous upon entering the forest.

He held onto his blade tightly.

“Let’s take a look.” To Lin Xiu, evolved beasts were tantamount to experience points. Upon thinking about the remaining 1.5 million experience points left to level up, he became excited.

Although Tian Zhi was afraid, he gathered his willpower to continue ahead.

“The soil here is wet, did it rain here?” Lin Xiu walked ahead and realized that the blackish-blue soil was slightly damp. Although it was hard to tell from their color, he was able to tell from the softness beneath his feet. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Path of Death would occasionally rain but only in the inner regions.” TIan Zhi seemed to understand the place really well and explained.

When they walked ahead, Lin Xiu could not help but open his mouth in surprise.

‘What the hell… is that?!’

The creature resembled a giant leech. It was extremely damp ahead, and the faint blue and translucent body squirmed in the mud. The leech also had soft thorns all over its body and its mouth had densely clustered sharp teeth within.

Lin Xiu had never seen such a ghastly creature in the information before!

Without hesitation, Lin Xiu activated Analytic Eyes:

Target: Rank 4 – T-Rex Leech (Giant)

Traits: An uncommon species that thrives in Azure Forest with a build of around 50 cm. There will be occasional mutations that allow the leech to grow to a meter or so. Moves extremely slowly and sounds like a cow.

“Oh my god…” Tian Zhi was alarmed and his face became ashen.

The creature ahead was extremely terrifying and disgusting.

Roar-

Right at this time, the giant T-Rex Leech unleashed another roar, it seemed to have spotted Lin Xiu as it started to curl its body as though fermenting an attack.

“Do you have any salt?” Lin Xiu’s skin was numb. The land ahead was a marsh and he could not rush forward. Furthermore, the creature seemed to be filled with hostility toward them.

It was said that leeches were afraid of salt, so Lin Xiu believed it might work against the creature.

“Yes! Yes!” Tian Zhi immediately reacted.

He would use the salt to barbeque evolved beasts. He quickly took out a transparent bottle that was filled with everyday salt.

“Give it!” Lin Xiu immediately ordered.

Tian Zhi nodded and threw it to Lin Xiu.

Although Lin Xiu was slightly afraid of the leech, he opened the bottle and threw it over. The salt immediately scattered towards the leech.

Zi zi zi-

The salt landed accurately on the leech’s body and produced a strange sound.

As though in pain, the T-Rex Leech started trembling and removed the salt from its body.

But right after that, it seemed to be infuriated as it curled up like a spring and shot forward like a cannonball!

Straight towards Lin Xiu!
