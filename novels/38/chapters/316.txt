Chapter 317: Benefiting As A Third Party

Lin Xiu sensed the sudden light aura and was taken aback. He turned to look and saw the Ice Lotus Fire that had taken form and even blossomed with a white light!

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide at this scene.

He was still a distance away from the Ice Lotus Fire but he could clearly sense the immense power from its energy.

A warrior killed all the others around him and extended his hand out to touch the Ice Lotus Fire!

His eyes were filled with desire on his sinister face.

“He’s taking it!?”

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted when he saw that.

It was so difficult for the Ice Lotus Fire to appear and it was about to be taken by another person!?

Bang-

But just as his hand touched the extremely beautiful ice lotus fire, the white flames immediately infected the source strength on his body and set him aflame!

‘It can even burn source strength?!’

Lin Xiu was startled.

The warrior did not expect such a thing to occur and struggled to extinguish the white flames on his body.

But it was too terrifying and ignored the lakewater as it quickly spread across his entire body.

His entire being was quickly set aflame!

All the other warriors were stunned.

They glanced at each other and continued to charge at the ice lotus fire. Despite the danger, they wanted to obtain it.

The saying of how human beings die in pursuit of wealth and birds die in pursuit of food was true.

The man covered in white flames was burned into nothing in a few short minutes.

His body did not even leave a bit of sludge and disappeared completely.

“What do we do now?” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue standing beside him and asked.

There were many warriors fighting around the ice lotus fire, all with the same intention of seizing the treasure.

“Let’s wait for all of them to die.” Luo Yue looked at them and replied indifferently.

“But how do we obtain the ice lotus fire?” Lin Xiu thought for a bit and asked.

Even if he and Luo Yue were to hide and attempt to benefit as a third party, how could they obtain the ice lotus fire?

Lin Xiu had just witnessed how the guy was engulfed in the white flames upon coming into contact with the treasure. In the end, nothing was left of him.

Furthermore, Lin Xiu had used Analytic Eye and saw that the victim was a rank 7 warrior. He was only a rank 5 warrior and had no way of resisting the terrifying flames.

“There’s a way.” Luo Yue contradicted him but did not explain herself further.

Although Lin Xiu was still skeptical, he did not speak further when he heard the confidence in her reply.

He looked to the distance and watched as the warriors tried to snatch the ice fire lotus. More and more warriors started to die.

Any warriors that attempted to approach the ice lotus fire would be surrounded and ganged by the others.

Not long later, all the warriors except one died. All of their bodies were completely destroyed by the strange water.

“Let’s go!” Luo Yue’s expression immediately changed and she charged forward! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Lin Xiu charged together with her. The two had formed a tacit understanding between themselves.

The warrior wanted to enjoy the fruits of his labor and was about to take the ice lotus fire when he sensed something. He immediately turned and saw Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

He opened his eyes wide. Although he was shocked, he quickly imbued source strength into his dagger and stabbed Luo Yue!

Bang-

Luo Yue reacted quickly and swung her own dagger out. The collision immediately produced sparks and a clear metallic sound.

Lin Xiu activated Analytic Eyes and quickly realized that the opponent was peak rank 7!

But he did not have the strange white light that enveloped Luo Yue’s body and moved much slower inside the water.

But even so, with his peak rank 7 strength, he was able to fight on equal grounds against Luo Yue, who was enveloped with the white light.

Lin Xiu unleashed a punch right when their blades crossed paths!

Rumble-

Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist!!!

He was the only opponent left so Lin Xiu used this skill.

His fists were enveloped with silver-white light as he punched out and became even more terrifying inside the water!

His fist went straight for the man!

The warrior reacted extremely fast and saw Lin Xiu’s sneak attack from the side!

The silver light around the fist had already affected him due to the lake water and caused him to feel numb.

He quickly exerted force to parry Luo Yue’s dagger and dodged to the side!

If they were on land, he had the confidence of retaliating against Lin Xiu’s punch.

But they were in a unique predicament and he did not have the same confidence!

‘Where can you go!’

Lin Xiu saw that the man intended to dodge and his pupils constricted. He released his power and charged forward!

The warrior realized he was not in time to dodge and extended his left hand with the intent of grabbing Lin Xiu’s fist!

Bang-

But the instant their fist and palm collided, he felt a powerful force surging into him.

All the lightning surged into his body!

He had gone through electric shock resistance training as a peak rank 7 warrior, and the silver light only made him feel slightly numb.

But in a fight between experts, the slightest numbness could prove fatal!

And Lin Xiu’s Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist did not stop there!
