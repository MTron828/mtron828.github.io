1155 Killing a Warrior God

Ever since he became a warrior god, the sage warrior skills that Lin Xiu has, had become even more powerful.

While using ‘Silence’ now, normal warrior gods would not be able to stand it.

At the same time, as the black particles headed toward the warrior god, one could see that his skin was getting corroded very quickly.

“AHHHHH!!!!!”

!!

There was a loud painful cry that came out of his mouth.

When they took a closer look, they could see that the man’s body had been corroded to the bones and his entire body was looking bloody as the warrior god was being attacked by ‘Silence’.

The man continued struggling and he was trying his best to get rid of the black particles around his body.

However, it was useless.

“Rubbish!”

Before Lin Xiu could continue his attack, the elder waved his arm and there was a huge energy released from it. It went straight for the other warrior god!

Boom – –

With a soft groan, the man’s body then exploded into tiny pieces.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but have an awful look on his face after seeing what had happened.

He was hoping to see how much EXP he would gain from killing these people.

However, he didn’t think that there would be someone else here that would interrupt him.

The man earlier might already be a warrior god but from the analytical eye, his stats were almost the same as Lin Xiu.

Plus, Lin Xiu was using the Divine Remolding Pill, the strength that he had now was not something that the other warrior gods could replicate.

Unfortunately, the old man took away his chance.

“I’m giving you another chance. Get on your knees and be my dog or else, you will end up like him.”

The old man glared at Lin Xiu as he warned Lin Xiu.

“Don’t worry. I won’t allow you the chance to be my dog.”

Lin Xiu sneered.

This old man was definitely a warrior god and he didn’t look weak.

He was able to get rid of all the black particles that Lin Xiu had just released.

This was enough to prove that this old man was incredibly powerful.

“Nonsense! Get him!”

When the old man saw the skills that Lin Xiu had, he indeed wanted Lin Xiu to work for him but after hearing how arrogant Lin Xiu was, the old man got furious.

But, he did not want to kill Lin Xiu.

He only wanted to capture Lin Xiu and slowly torture him so that Lin Xiu would know how powerful the Tianlan Pavillion was!

With the old man’s ordres, there were two other warriors, hidden at the back, that started attacking Lin Xiu!

These warriors were like two shadows and they suddenly appeared next to Lin Xiu.

One of them had a sword and the other had a machete. It was obvious that both of them were warrior gods.

Lin Xiu didn’t want to be careless about it and instantly activated ‘Rage’.

As ‘Rage’ was slowly activated, Lin Xiu could feel a vast amount of energy flowing through his entire body.

Clang clang clang – –

Before the weapons could even touch his body, Lin Xiu had started swinging around the long spear that was in his arms.

As his long spear collided with their weapons, there were loud, crisp sounds of metals hitting each other.

Destiny Spear Art!

With Lin Xiu moving the long spear smoothly with his arms, both the warriors who were holding onto Lin Xiu started to look worried.

Lin Xiu’s movements were sharp and it was changing all the time.

Even when there were two of them against one, the warrior gods didn’t get much advantage.

Plus, as the weapons in their hands were colliding the long spear continuously, they would feel their hands turned numb.

Damn it!

Then, they immediately gathered the energies in the bodies.

If they wanted to capture Lin Xiu, they would have to kill Lin Xiu right now!

If they weren’t vicious enough to kill Lin Xiu, they would be the ones who would be dead very soon!

“Interesting.”

The old man who sat on the higher seat, let out a cold laugh.

His pair of clear eyes that has not been damaged by his age, were now filled with murderous intentions as he glared at Lin Xiu.

The city lords who got here….there would always be a few that refused to listen to him.

Those people tried to fight him but none of them survived.

But, Lin Xiu was the only one who survived until this part.

“Since you refuse to be my dog, you shall be dead.”

He watched the fight between his men and Lin Xiu. Then, there was a small amount of energy that appeared on his fingertip.

Then, with the snap of his fingers, the energy turned into an energy ball and it went straight for Lin Xiu’s body!

Boom – –

With one soft groan, there was a hole that appeared on Lin Xiu’s head. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The two other warriors then raised their weapons and thrusted it into Lin Xiu’s body!

Boom – –

Lin Xiu’s body instantly blasted.

It turned into a ball of mist.

It was a fake one!

The old man and his men were all caught off guard.

“I just wanted to check how much EXP you three would bring!”

Lin Xiu’s voice came from behind them.

Lin Xiu held onto his long spear with both arms and there were numerous flaming birds that were released from it!

These flaming birds were much scarier than those that Lin Xiu had when he was a sage warrior.

The air around them were twisted as it was scorching hot.

The entire Xiantian Mansion was burning hot.

They no longer felt like they were at the mansion; instead, it felt like a huge oven!

The old man remained calm and released his ‘sphere’.

The two other men did the same as well.

This was because they could feel that the flaming birds that Lin Xiu released were extremely terrifying.

Boom – –

As the flaming birds hit the ground, it was followed by multiple loud explosions.

“Let me show you some explosions.”

Lin Xiu looked at how they were moving around before letting out a cold laugh. As he gathered his thoughts and moved his right hand, the red lotus fire, thunder lotus fire and ice lotus fire were aimed at the old man.

What were these?!

The old man looked at the lotus fire that was coming at him and the look in his eyes changed.

Crap!

Just as the lotus fires were about to reach him, all three of them joined together!

Boom – –

As they were joined together, there was another loud explosion.

The entire Xiantian Mansion started shaking vigorously.

If it wasn’t because the mansion had been built with special materials and techniques, it could have collapsed due to the horrible shake.
