Chapter 519: Lin Xiu and Luo Yue

Koong Loong – –

With a loud sound, the man’s ‘Yuan’ was blasted away by Wanlu’s fist!

Following that, the fist directly landed on the man’s head, which broke the man’s head to pieces.

Blood splattered everywhere and the rank 7 warrior lost his life.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but widen his eyes in surprise as well.

That man’s fist was extremely scary…

Everyone around remained quiet as well since they were all shocked by Wan Lu’s fist.

“Hmph! Such a show-off.” Elder Bai from the Purple Power League snorted before turning to his men and said, “Come on. Let’s go.”

With that said, his men followed him into the thunder Valley.

“If there’s anyone of you who found the space crack, please let me know first. I will greatly reward all of you who did.” Wan Lu looked at the warriors around him and told them.

Then, he entered the Thunder Valley as well.

Luo Yue and Lin Xiu looked at each other before heading towards the Thunder Valley.

The both of them have grown closer and would easily understand what the other person was thinking with just an exchange of looks.

“Hmph, they are really doing inside. They have no idea what’s waiting for them.” The middle-aged man who had an encounter with Lin Xui earlier stared at the couple with a fierce look in his eyes.

“Boss, that chick looks cute. Once we enter later, should we…” One of his men asked with a wretched look on his face.

“That’s a good idea.” There was a greedy look that appeared in the middle-aged man’s eyes.

This was the first time that he had seen such a beautiful girl.

Plus, the young man obviously wouldn’t be powerful enough to protect her. Once they enter the valley, they wouldn’t be able to do as they like.

They weren’t the only ones. There were a lot of other warriors who noticed Luo Yue and Lin Xiu as well and most of them were caught onto the stunning girl, Luo Yue.

As for the both of them, they had just entered the Thunder Valley.

“What happened here…” When Lin Xiu entered the valley, he could see that there were lots of cracks and craters that were found on the ground.

“Well, you may not know but these were caused by the lightning that strikes very frequently in the Thunder Valley.”

Just when Lin Xiu was mumbling to himself, there was a clear voice that appeared next to him.

Lin Xiu turned around and saw a young man standing next to him.

Other than him, there were a few more of them. All of them looked extremely young as well.

“Let’s get to know each other. My name is Wang Qian.” The man smiled and introduced himself.

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment before saying, “Hi.”

There was a huge crowd here and Lin Xiu didn’t trust that these people would like to know him out of the blue. Plus, Lin Xiu noticed that this man’s eyes were on Luo Yue instead.

It may only be for a brief moment but Lin Xiu still caught him staring.

After hearing Lin Xiu reply, it was obvious to Wang Qian that Lin Xiu wasn’t interested in making friends with me.

But, Wang Qian continued smiling as if he didn’t care.

“Further front, there will also be evolutionary beasts besides thunder and lightning. It will get more dangerous. Why don’t we travel together?” Wang Qian continued speaking.

“I’ve been here a few times which is why I am more familiar to this place.”

“That’s alright. Thank you.”

Lin Xiu gave a blunt smile and replied to Wang Qian.

Luo Yue was even more direct with her rejection. She didn’t even bother looking at them and followed right behind Lin Xiu as he continued walking.

Wang Qian couldn’t help but frown as well when he saw both of them leaving.

“Oh…. Wang Qian, stop being so nice to them. They don’t want to be a part of your team.” At that moment, a man came over and mocked him.

“He’s right. Were you trying to get the opportunity to talk to that woman?” One of the women said bitterly.

“SHUT UP.” Wang Qian said with an ugly expression on his face.

Lin Xiu continued walking forward until there were no other warriors in sight.

Thunder Valley looked like the edge of a forest but the difference is that the surrounding trees were very strange; they were not like the ordinary trees.

Lin Xiu touched one of the branches with his hand and felt that the branches were very hard. This must be why most of the trees were still standing despite the heavy lightning.

Koong Loong – Koong Loong – –

After a short period of time where Lin Xiu and Luo Yue continued to move forward, there was a loud thunder that came from the sky.

“Look out!”

The look in his eyes changed and as he looked up to the sky, there was a huge lightning bolt that was headed in their direction.

Lin Xiu subconsciously tried to dodge it but Luo Yue kicked him in the back and placed him back into the same position.

Lin Xiu widened his eyes in shock as he was confused when the large lightning bolt landed directly on Lin Xiu’s body.

“Identifying the energy source… ‘Engulf’ activated…”

“1%… 5%…”

Lin Xiu was wearing his combat suit and it obviously wouldn’t be ruined by the lightning.

However, Lin Xiu’s hair wasn’t as lucky and it was burnt.

“Hu–” When the lightning disappeared, Lin Xiu let out a breath of relief and there was a numbing feeling across his body.

This was all because he was struck by lightning.

“Since you are here…”

“To strengthen your body.” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu who looked ridiculous. She was about to laugh but immediately got control of herself and put on her usual cold expression.

“You should at least give me some time to prepare.” Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulder helplessly.

“What are you doing to go about that?” Luo Yue felt guilty as well and asked Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was taken aback when he heard Luo Yue’s words.

Because this version of Luo Yue seemed to be a little different from the usual one. She seemed to be a lot less cold than before.

“What do you think?” Lin Xiu found Luo Yue extremely cute now and couldn’t help but approach Luo Yue. He placed his right hand directly on the branch of the giant tree behind Luo Yue and then spoke to Luo Yue.

The both of them were standing close to each other; so close that they could smell each other’s breath.

Luo Yue’s eyes were opened wide as well as she didn’t expect Lin Xiu to act so boldly and had gotten so close to her!

Luo Yue wanted to burst into rage, but for some reason, she didn’t feel angry.

She just felt her heart beating fast.

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue who was just an inch away and his body was frozen as well.

He was just fooling around but it seems like things were unfolding in a manner that was out of his control.

As he stared at Luo Yue’s attractive red lips, Lin Xiu got closer to it uncontrollably…
