Chapter 517: Arriving at the Black Rock Cit

“Chen Yang? What’s the matter?” At this moment, a middle-aged man walked over here.

When Chen Yang heard the familiar voice and raised his head subconsciously, his eyes instantly lit up with surprise.

“Uncle!”

The middle-aged man looked at Chen Yang and saw Jin Yuan, who was standing beside him, and he seemed to be in a bad state.

“Young Master Jin? What happened?!” The middle-aged man was surprised to see the bloody state of Jin Yuan’s palm.

As he took a closer look, Jin Yuan’s bodyguards were also covering some parts of their body and they looked seemingly painful.

“We met with a dude who was rude and he beat us up.” Chen Yang said while gritting his teeth.

He obviously wouldn’t say that he was the one who started it first.

“They dared to hit you when they’re in Bai Di City?” The middle-aged man frowned.

“Who was it?”

Chen Yang may be average but Jin Yuan was still someone who was powerful. Along with these bodyguards, their abilities were considered one of the best in Bai Di City. How did they end up in such a state?

“A boy about seventeen or eighteen years old.” Chen Yang gritted his teeth and said aloud.

As he said that out loud, Chen Yang felt embarrassed as well. He was frightened of a young boy!

A young boy?

“His weapon….was it a spear?” The middle-aged man seemed to be reminded of something as he shuddered.

“I think so.” Chen Yang thought hard about it and nodded his head.

“Leave now! You shouldn’t provoke him!” The middle-aged man quickly thought that it would probably be the young man who threatened to take Chen Jinqian’s life back in the hospital!

He was a rank 6 warrior! He was already such a powerful person at a young age. It was obvious that he had an extremely powerful background.

Chen Yang was startled, completely unexpected that his uncle would say so.

“Young Master Jin, quick. Let’s get you treated first.”

The middle-aged man looked at Jin Yuan’s injury and quickly said.

“Okay.” Jin Yuan might have been impulsive earlier as he wanted to teach Lin Xiu a lesson but by now, he had already calmed down.

They were from Sky City and they were people that they couldn’t mess with.

“Ugh, I’m exhausted.” After getting to his room, Lin Xiu put down the Dark Edge, laid down on the bed, and said comfortably.

But soon, when Lin Xiu sat up, his eyes saw Luo Yue who was walking behind him and he started feeling nervous.

This was a single room…

This meant that…. Tonight…

“Are we really going to sleep here tonight?” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but ask.

Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu calmly.

“That’s right.”

“Well, this bed isn’t small and it should fit the both of us…” Lin Xiu gulped as he spoke to Luo Yue.

Just when Lin Xiu’s imagination was flowing through his head, Luo Yue had already taken out a quilt from the cabinet and placed it on the floor.

“You’re sleeping here.” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu, who was being an excited idiot, and spoke to him in an emotionless tone.

Lin Xiu was stunned when he saw what happened.

“Ahem, I knew that.” Lin Xiu pretended to stay calm.

Then, he went for the quilt that was placed on the floor.

Frankly, since the morning, Lin Xiu has not been able to rest and he was feeling exhausted.

This was why Lin Xiu fell into a deep sleep as soon as his head rested on the ground.

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu who was fast asleep and there was a change in the look in her eyes. No one knew what was going on in her head.

Time passed quickly and in the evening, they joined Ye Shuanger’s family for dinner and told them that he would be leaving with Luo Yue the next morning.

Since the problems with the flood, the zombies and the evolved beast in Xing Yao City have been settled.

The Union’s government was still very quick when it came to solving these issues.

Soon, it was the next day.

“Brother Lin Xiu, which school are you in right now?” At the airport, Ye Chuanger and her parents were also boarding their plane to head back to Xing Yao City.

Xing Yao City was no longer in danger and their homes were not destroyed as well.

Ye Shuanger looked at Lin Xiu and asked him out of curiosity.

“Why? Do you want to join me in my school?” Lin Xiu patted Ye Shuanger’s head as he chuckled.

“En.” Ye Shuanger nodded her head and stared at Lin Xiu with her large eyes.

“Sacred Region Academy.” Lin Xiu smiled as he answered.

The Sacred Region Academy…

Ye Shuanger mumbled to herself but soon there was a determined look in her eyes as she said, “Wait for me then! I shall be there soon!”

“I will join you and Sister Luo Yue!”

“Sure. I’ll be waiting for you.” Lin Xiu smiled.

Ye Shuanger had the potential and it was possible that she would be able to enroll in the academy.

“Our plane is here. We should get going.” Lin Xiu looked at the distance before saying to Luo Yue.

“En.” Luo Yue nodded her head.

“Lin Xiu, remember to pay a visit to Xing Yao City whenever you’re free.” Ye Shuanger’s parents said to Lin Xiu.

“Of course!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were already leaving, Ye Shuanger waved and screamed, “Goodbye!”

As they got on board and found their seats, they realized that there were a lot of people who were headed to Black Rock City.

There were no empty seats on the plane.

Plus, Lin Xiu could sense that most of these people on board were warriors and most of them were of high ranks as well.

It seems that the space crack in the Thunder Valley of Black Rock City was already known by many warriors.

Lin Xiu then closed his eyes to rest.

The space crack wasn’t the only reason why Lin Xiu was headed towards the Black Rock City. The main reason for him was so that he could use the lightning there to train his body.

About half an hour later, they finally arrived at the Black Rock City!

“We’re here?” Lin Xiu opened his eyes and noticed that most of them had already left the plane. Lin Xiu then stood up as well.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue.

Luo Yue answered him with a smile and the both of them walked out of the plane.

As soon as he walked out, Lin Xiu felt the dazzling sun shining on his face.

He squinted because of the bright light. As he looked at his surroundings, he could easily see that most of the planes that landed, carried a large number of warriors.

“Well, looks like everyone here is headed for the Thunder Valley as well.” Lin Xiu started chatting with Luo Yue.

Luo Yue nodded her head in agreement as she looked at Lin Xiu.

“Let’s head there then.” Lin Xiu smiled as well.

With the GPS on his phone, both of them quickly headed towards the Thunder Valley.

The Black Rock City was a second-tier city that was surrounded by mountains and there were lots of high-rank warriors that lived here.

As for the Thunder Valley, it was just 30 km away from the entrance of the Black Rock City.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com
