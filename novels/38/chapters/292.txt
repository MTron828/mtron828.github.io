Chapter 293: Scavenger Crow

The living body of the mutated Black Tooth Spider in her backpack was no longer struggling at this time.

“You guys go back first, I won’t be going back yet.” Lin Xiu was silent for a while, then looked at Guo Ling and the others and said.

“You’re not going back!?” The people, who had already packed their things and were happily ready to leave, were suddenly stunned.

“En, I still want to stay here for a few more days.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

He finally came here and wouldn’t leave just like that.

One reason was to gain experience, and there was another reason. He wanted to see if he would meet Luo Yue here.

“It’s dangerous here, Lin Xiu, let’s go back.” Qiu Li heard Lin Xiu’s words and said directly to Lin Xiu.

After spending time together these few days, Qiu Li no longer disliked Lin Xiu and instead admired Lin Xiu very much. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After all, at Lin Xiu’s age, he was already so strong. Anyone would admire him.

“That’s right, who knows if there will be other warriors here.”

Qian Lin also nodded at this time and said worriedly.

After experiencing what happened these few days, it was clear that evolved beasts were rare and easy to deal with but those warriors were the most terrifying.

“No need, you guys can go back, I still have things to do here.” Lin Xiu shook his head, then smiled and said to them.

Guo Ling frowned slightly, then sighed and said, “Well, you should be careful.”

She knew that Lin Xiu must have other objectives when he came here, otherwise he wouldn’t have readily agreed to do the mission together with them.

But what exactly did Lin Xiu want to do here? Could it be that he wants to train? Guo Ling was a little puzzled and she didn’t seem to understand what Lin Xiu was thinking.

Qiu Li and the others opened their mouths, but they didn’t know what to say.

Since Lin Xiu has decided to stay, there wasn’t much that they could say.

“Alright, let’s go first, you should be careful.” Qiu Li thought for a while then said to Lin Xiu.

“Ok.”

“When you come back, I will transfer the points from this mission to you.” Guo Ling said as she glanced at Lin Xiu and did not persuade Lin Xiu to go back together.

“Sure.”

Everyone exchanged greetings and in the next moment, with Guo Ling leading in front, they walked to the other side.

After Lin Xiu watched them disappear, he carried his Dark Edge spear and left without looking back.

He was now going to the depths of the Dark Forest.

This place was really weird. Would there be an evolved beast that is as high-ranking as a Black Tooth Spider but is also very afraid of flames?

If so, he could continue to gain experience!

Now that Guo Ling and the others had left, Rollie had also run out of Lin Xiu’s backpack. Its chubby body stood directly on Lin Xiu’s shoulders as it hugged the black crystals and ate them like a little squirrel.

It made a burst of ‘clicking’ sounds.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but smile helplessly when he saw this and his eyes were filled with curiosity.

Because Rollie seemed to have become bigger from constantly eating the Odd crystals.

Lin Xiu took a closer look and saw that the surface of its body has become smoother.

It was light blue and crystal clear like a sapphire which surprised Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu continued to walk and came to the area where he killed the Black Tooth Spiders yesterday.

As soon as he walked over there, he saw that the bodies of those warriors were covered with a lot of black things.

What are these!?

Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted when he saw this scene.

There were so many of these black things densely packed. If people with trypophobia saw this, their faces would turn green.

“Ya!”

At this time, it seemed that as Lin Xiu walked over, those black things suddenly made a loud sharp sound.

“What is this!?” Lin Xiu exclaimed while looking at this scene.

Without any hesitation, he activated the Analytic Eye:

Rank 6 Scavenger Crow, a special evolved beast that lives in the Dark Forest, specializes in pecking at the corpses of people.

Features: Extremely fast, fear of flames.

Another rank 6 evolved beast!?

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked at the corpses again and found that the corpses on the ground had been almost completely eaten by these crows.

A closer look at this time revealed that the corpses were left with only bones at an extremely fast speed.

And these darn things didn’t seem to be afraid of Lin Xiu’s arrival at all; they were still pecking at the corpses of those warriors who were killed yesterday.

“It’s really disgusting.”

Lin Xiu watched the corpses slowly turn into white skeletons at a speed visible to the naked eye and he couldn’t help but feel a chill down his spine.

But these things were rank 6 evolved beasts, so if he killed them, he could get almost five million experience?

With that thought, Lin Xiu was motivated and the Dark Edge spear in his hand was clenched tightly.

He saw the description of their characteristics by Analysic Eye that these guys were afraid of flames!

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate to take action and the body of the Dark Edge spear suddenly burst into flames.

‘Awe of the Phoenix’!!!

With a ‘swish’, Lin Xiu thrust his spear and phoenixes burst out from the tip of the spear. Then, hit the bodies of the Scavenger Crows over there!

Lin Xiu initially thought that it would be as simple as killing the Black Tooth Spiders from before, but didn’t expect that as the phoenixes charged over, the Scavenger Crows dodged!

What is going on!?

Lin Xiu was taken aback for a moment, but just as Lin Xiu was stunned, the Scavenger Crows came towards Lin Xiu’s side!

Their sharp mouths were wide open as if they were about to peck Lin Xiu’s flesh.

“Damn it!”

The introduction that was given by the Analytic Eye was not wrong. The speed of this thing was indeed very fast, but Lin Xiu did not expect it to be so fast.

They actually managed to dodge the phoenixes that Lin Xiu released.

Lin Xiu stared at this scene and rushed directly to the front!

Swish——

They were fast but Lin Xiu was even faster!

He stabbed out the spear with the Red Lotus Fire and directly pierced both the bodies of the two Scavenger Crows at the same time!
