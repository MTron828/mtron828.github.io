Chapter 923: Inheritance of the Sage Warrior!

‘Heavenly Array’!

As he activated the skills, Lin Xiu was in the centre of it as the bright light surrounded him.

“Domain?!”

Hu Ling mumbled to himself when he saw the scene before his eyes.

With the Heavenly Array being used and Lin Xiu’s strength greatly improved from before, his physique became stronger as well.

When he saw the stairs to the ninth floor, he stepped onto it without any hesitation.

Koong Loong – –

As he stepped onto it, Lin Xiu could feel all his internal organs shaking.

There was a huge force that entered Lin Xiu’s body.

It felt as if this terrifying strength was about to rip his body into pieces!

However, Lin Xiu was determined.

He was not moved by the strong force.

Then, he placed another foot on the stairs!

......

The strong, terrifying strength caused Lin Xiu’s skin to break.

There was blood seeping out his skin.

His entire body was now covered with bright, red blood.

‘Take it all in!!’

Lin Xiu said to himself and demanded his body to absorb all of this energy!

His entire body felt as if it had been set on fire!

But Lin Xiu was still able to steady himself. He has been through things that were much more painful than this. This was nothing!

“He stayed?!”

Feng Zheng wanted bady to kill Lin Xiu but when he saw how Lin Xiu was able to stand strong on the stairs to the ninth floor, he was shocked as well.

Time slowly passed.

Lin Xiu was still standing on the same spot and an hour later, he finally opened his eyes.

His eyes were fixed on the very last step but even though it was the last one, it felt as if it was very far away from him.

This last step was incredibly difficult.

There may be a possibility that his entire body will be blown apart!

As he thought of what might happen, Lin Xiu suddenly felt fear inside his heart.

No! No way!

Lin Xiu quickly shook his head to get rid of that thought.

He came to Namir Planet not only to complete the promise that he made to the old man.

He was here for the Orchid of Heaven in order to heal Luo Yue.

How could he stop here?!”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and steadied himself as he picked up his leg.

He was about to make it to the last step!

Every single warrior on the bottom held their breath.

“You’re dead!!!”

Feng Zheng looked at Lin Xiu who was now covered in blood. He couldn’t help but screamed at Lin Xiu as the man took the last step on the stairs.

The last step would definitely have the strongest force.

It will definitely blow up Lin Xiu’s body within seconds!

He was already screaming loudly inside.

Koong Loong– –

Lin Xiu got onto the last step without any hesitation!

Lin Xiu’s legs couldn’t help but shake while facing such a huge force.

His body was about to be thrown down the stairs!

“Get down!”

“Get down!”

“Get down!”

Suddenly, there was a figure that appeared in his head that kept telling him to move.

Lin Xiu felt as if he had been caught into the chanting.

That’s when he felt his body getting weaker.

“Lin Xiu...”

Suddenly, Luo Yue’s voice appeared in his head.

Luo Yue’s face appeared as well and he could finally see her.

New novels chapters are published ᴏn !

Lin Xiu, whose eyes had already lost all hope, was enlightened.

He couldn’t stop here! He has to continue no matter what!

Boom – –

Lin Xiu was determined as he made the final step!

All of a sudden, the terrifying force that was about to tear him apart had disappeared.

Lin Xiu soon got to the top of the stairs.

He was covered in blood and seemed badly injured.

But Lin Xiu did not feel much pain.

Instead, he felt relaxed and relieved.

“He….he got up there?!”

Hu Ling covered her mouth to prevent herself from saying it out loud.

He’s so strong!

Most of them wouldn’t even be able to stand on the second step but Lin Xiu made it to the highest one!

“Damn it! Damn it!!!”

Feng Zheng was about to turn crazy.

The Black Troops was the one who found this place first.

Not only would there be an inheritance from a sage warrior, there were also treasures.

He didn’t expect for all of these to be given to someone else!

Lin Xiu was still standing on the highest step. He saw that there was a bright light in the centre and he slowly walked towards it.

Whoosh – –

Then, there was the sound of water rushing into the room coming from the light!

“HAHAHAHAHAH!!!”

A loud laughter suddenly rang throughout the room. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The bright light suddenly showed a huge human figure.

“I am the Black Demon Sage Warrior! Are you willing to accept my inheritance and become my disciple?!”

The source of energy turned into a huge human form as it laughed at Lin Xiu.

The Inheritance!

It’s the inheritance from a sage warrior!

All of the warriors at the bottom were shocked.

At the same time, they were envious of Lin Xiu as well.

“The Black Demon Sage Warrior! I didn’t think it would be the Black Demon Sage Warrior!”

When Feng Zheng heard the name of the warrior, he started mumbling.

The name of this sage warrior was famous on the Namir Planet.

The skill of the Black Demon Sage Warrior was known as the Blood Demon Skills.

This was considered one of the most cruel warrior kills on the Namir Planet.

Feng Zheng glared at Lin Xiu. He wanted to drag Lin Xiu from up there so that he would be able to get the inheritance.

The skill of this sage warrior wasn’t only cruel and deadly, it was also incredibly powerful!

Lin Xiu looked at the sage warrior standing before him and said, “I refuse.”

Everyone at the scene thought that Lin Xiu would be ready to accept the inheritance.

However, Lin Xiu refused it!

But…..but, this was the inheritance of a sage warrior!!

“Why are you refusing it?!”

The figure of the Black Demon Sage Warrior appeared above Lin Xiu’s head. It looked like a group of dark clouds in the sky.

“Because you’re not good enough.”

Lin Xiu looked at the figure and told the truth.

“You’re asking for it!!!”

The Black Demon Sage Warrior looked awful as he heard what Lin Xiu said.

The huge figure then rushed towards Lin Xiu’s body.

“If that’s the case, I will be taking over your body!!!”

With a huge sound coming from behind, the sage warrior rushed into Lin Xiu’s body.

Seizing?!

The warriors beneath the stairs were so shocked that their jaw hit the ground.

The sage warrior inheritance was nothing great!

The warriors, who looked envious earlier, were covered with fear from head to toe.

“Ahhhhh!!!”

As the Black Demon Sage Warrior entered Lin Xiu’s body and was about to seize his body which caused Lin Xiu to scream in pain.
