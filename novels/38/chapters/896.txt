Chapter 897: You’re Worthy of Asking My Name? Translation

Zhao Qi looked at Lin Xiu over there and said aloud.

Next to Lin Xiu, there was a sloppy man with a full beard, whose face could not be seen clearly, causing Zhao Qi’s brows to wrinkle.

He couldn’t understand why there was such a man here.

Did the two of them break into the ninth floor?

Lin Xiu glanced at the Zhao family members around him, his eyes narrowed involuntarily.

“Why, why are so many people coming to welcome me?”

Zhao Lin glanced at Zhao Qi, hesitated for a while and said sharply to Lin Xiu, “Did you enter the ninth floor of our Zhao family’s nine-story pagoda?”

“So what?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Do you know that the ninth floor’s skill card is handed down from generation to generation by our Zhao family. If you know your place, hand it over to me!

Zhao Lin stared at Lin Xiu and continued to speak.

Holy-level skill cards were extremely attractive to anyone.

And this holy-level skill card is still on the ninth-story tower of their Zhao family. Although it was said that it would belong to whoever got it, they were still very unwilling to hand it to an outsider.

......

“Oh, do you want this?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows, then took out the holy-level skill card from his pocket.

At this time, the eyes of the people around were all looking at Lin Xiu’s hand.

Holy-level skill cards, even on the planet Namir, are extremely rare skill cards.

Definitely can’t let this kid take it away!

“give me!”

When Zhao Lin saw the white skill card in Lin Xiu’s hand, he immediately said loudly.

“Take it.”

A strange smile appeared on the corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth, then he flicked the fingers of his right hand and the skill card in his hand flew directly to Zhao Lin.

Looking at this scene, Zhao Lin’s eyes revealed ecstasy.

He stretched out his hand to catch this skill card.

The moment he received this skill card, Zhao Lin, who was elated, suddenly turned extremely ugly.

Because there is no energy fluctuation on this skill card.

This means that the information in this holy-level skill card has already been absorbed by someone!

“Damn!!!”

Zhao Lin felt that he was being tricked. At this time, he threw the skill Card on the ground and roared at Lin Xiu.

“Don’t let him go!”

The surrounding Zhao family warriors heard Zhao Lin’s words and in the next moment, they surrounded Lin Xiu.

They all held sharp weapons in their hands and looked at Lin Xiu, full of hostility.

“Retreat.”

Seeing this scene, Zhao Yongyuan walked out immediately, glanced at the people around him and said aloud.

His words seemed to carry some kind of terrifying power. When these Zhao family warriors heard his words, they subconsciously took a step back in the next moment.

“Who are you?”

Zhao Qi looked at this savage-like man and said lightly at this time.

Because he could clearly feel that the strength of the man in front of him seemed unusual.

“You’re worthy of asking my name?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Zhao Yongyuan stared at Zhao Qi, then said lightly.

“You wanna die!”

Seeing Zhao Yongyuan talking to his father like this, Zhao Lin’s expression changed slightly and the long sword hanging from his waist was directly pulled out from the scabbard, facing Zhao Yongyuan, it was a slash in the air!
