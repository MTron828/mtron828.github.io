Chapter 487: Come Looking For Him

“Xiaojing, Xiaomei, hurry up and take the patient to the operating room and I will perform the operation right away.” The doctor looked at Lin Xiu as if he was looking at a malefic person and said quickly.

The two nurses nodded when they heard the doctor’s words, then pushed Ye Shuang’er’s father’s bed to the other side.

“Brother Lin Xiu…” Ye Shuang’er looked at this scene with a worried expression as if she wanted to follow them.

“Don’t worry, it will be fine.” Lin Xiu said with a smile.

“They are performing an operation, we can’t go in either, just wait.”

“Yeah.” Ye Shuang’er looked at her mother who was still in a coma, thought for a while, then nodded.

Boom–

At this moment, the half-closed door to the room was suddenly pushed open.

The door hit the wall very loudly.

“Are those two old people right here?”

A sound came from the door in an instant.

Looking closely, a man wearing brand-name clothing was talking while smoking a cigarette.

Behind him, there were more than a dozen men who seemed to have ill intentions.

The bodies of these men were very muscular and they looked like warriors.

“It’s you!?” Ye Shuang’er’s parents’ friend, that is, the middle-aged woman, suddenly had a nasty look on her face when she saw them.

“Oh? You are here too, you got them sent here, right?” The man suddenly snorted when he saw the middle-aged woman.

“Is that him?” Lin Xiu pointed at the man at this time, then said lightly to the middle-aged woman.

She recounted what happened before.

Ye Shuang’er’s parents rented a car and drove to the airport to pick up Ye Shuang’er, but they didn’t expect to be hit by a brand-name car during the journey and the other party was unreasonable. They got Ye Shuang’er’s father out of the car, then broke all his limbs.

“Yes…” Although the middle-aged woman was a little scared looking at these people, she still said aloud.

“Who is this kid?” The leader looked at Lin Xiu, then said with a cold snort.

At this time, his eyes scanned the inside of the ward and his eyes lit up when he saw Ye Shuang’er and Luo Yue.

Ye Shuang’er was a cute type, while Luo Yue was a cold beauty.

Although they were two different types of girls, they were both rare beauties!

“Hey, they are his daughters?” The man had a greedy look, then said aloud.

“Play with me for a few days and I’ll let this matter go. Of course, I will let these doctors treat your parents. Judging by the broken car they drove, you should have no money, right?”

“You… shameless!” Ye Shuang’er was angered when she heard the man’s words. She, who hadn’t spoken swear words before, didn’t even have anything to scold him.

“She said I’m shameless?” The man pointed at Ye Shuang’er, then said to the people behind.

“Hahaha!” When those people heard the man’s words, they laughed out loud.

Like they just heard a hilarious joke.

“I will show you what shameless is right now!” The man sneered, then waved his hand.

Those people seemed to know the man’s intentions and they walked up, immediately grabbing Ye Shuang’er.

“What do you want to do!?” The middle-aged woman’s expression changed when she saw their movements.

“I shall execute her right here in front of all of you, hahaha!” The man took off his coat at this time, then said with an obscene smile.

A few muscular men walked in and were about to grab Ye Shuang’er’s hands and feet.

“It seems that you like to play very much, huh.” But at this moment, Lin Xiu blocked these men.

“Beat him to death!”

“In Bai Di City, I, Chen Jinqian, is the King of Heaven!” The man said proudly.

Click, click, click——

But as soon as his voice fell, he heard a sound.

He took a closer look and the men who had just walked in and wanted to catch Ye Shuang’er were all lying on the ground.

What made him even more horrified was that the bones in his hands seemed to be broken and they became dislocated.

“You…” Chen Jinqian’s eyes widened as he saw this scene.

“Kill him!!!”

Following his roar, the people behind reacted at this moment, and rushed in directly, they were about to pounce on Lin Xiu.

“Brother Lin Xiu!” Ye Shuang’er was also a little worried when seeing this scene.

Because of her concern for Lin Xiu, she almost forgot that Lin Xiu had the terrifying power that could kill even those terrifying groups of zombies.

Lin Xiu looked at the speed of the men rushing over and shook his head. Slow, too slow!

Bang bang bang——

Lin Xiu lifted his foot and kicked it several times in an instant. The muscular men who leaped over all flew out and hit the wall on the back passage, many cracks appeared on the wall.

“Anyone else?” said Chen Jingqian, who was standing still in the middle of the door, holding a cigarette at this moment.

In just a few seconds, his subordinates’ limbs were either broken or they were now lying on the ground wailing. Lin Xiu also kicked some of them and sent them flying. They all hit the wall behind and fell like a human pyramid.

“You…you…” Chen Jingqian had a look of horror in his eyes and was speechless.

“Now, is it your turn?” Lin Xiu said with murderous intent in his eyes at this time.

But they were not in the wild right now, they were in the center of Bai Di City and still in the hospital. There were surveillance cameras around. If he killed someone, he would probably be wanted by the federal government.

Lin Xiu forcibly restrained his desire to kill him directly and walked towards him slowly, then said lightly.

“Forget it, he seems to be from the Chen family…” The middle-aged woman seemed to have thought of something and said to Lin Xiu aloud.

“I don’t care who he is, this is the consequence for offending me!”

Lin Xiu let out a cold snort, walked directly in front of Chen Jinqian, and put Chen Jinqian on the ground in two clicks.

Click, click, click——

There were sounds of bones breaking.

“Ah!!!” The violent pain from the limbs caused Chen Jin to cry out loudly.

“That’s how you dealt with Uncle Ye just now, right?” Lin Xiu said while looking at Chen Jin who was lying on the ground.

“But this bone could still be connected back, I’ve let you off too easily…”
