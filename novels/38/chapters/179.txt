Chapter 180: Hunting Team

‘Although there was no explosion, he should be dead from being struck in the chest, right?’

At the same time, he saw a young lady rush out and all the agents hiding in the buildings pressed on their triggers.

But the young lady was extremely fast and was able to avoid all the laser beams to his surprise!

“Attention, attention! Someone is rushing up Building E1!” The man’s face changed and quickly shouted onto the communication device on his shirt.

They were a hunting team in G17 ruin and were specialised in using various weapons and concealed locations and buildings to hunt evolved beasts. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Furthermore, they accepted bounties and when they saw Lin Xiu, they took the chance to attack.

Although they were warriors as well, they were weaker in terms of close combat.

“Class monitor, are you alright?” Li Ping asked.

“I’m fine.” Lin Xiu shook his head and took out a little vial and applied the liquid on his wounds.

A numb sensation set in and his pain gradually disappeared.

“Who the hell are they?” Zhang Yin frowned.

“I’ll go take a look.” Lin Xiu’s expression was bad, regardless of who the ambushers were, any ordinary person would get mad for being sneak attack on.

And he did not know of Luo Yue’s situation.

Lin Xiu held his spear and upon walking out, a few laser beams flew at him!

Bang bang bang-

Many laser beams shot down and formed many potholes on the ground.

But Lin Xiu was already prepared and dodged all of them.

“Damn it! Does he have eyes growing on his back?!”

“Over there.” While dodging the laser beams, he looked over and charged under a building.

“Attention! Attention! Two intruders have entered buildings E1 and E2 separately!” The people became anxious when they saw Lin Xiu enter another building.

But they were at higher floors, as long as they saw people coming up the stairs, they could simply use their laser rifles to fire away.

They had the latest version rifles that were extremely destructive and could even inflict heavy injuries through battle robes that had higher defense.

“What do we do now?” Jiang Li looked outside and asked.

The ground had many potholes from the laser beams.

They did not dare act recklessly under the concentrated attacks.

After all, their response abilities were inferior to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue and would die or be crippled if struck by the laser beams.

“We should wait for a bit, class monitor and Luo Yue should be able to kill them.” Although Zhang Yin wanted to fight, he knew they were not strong enough and might get killed by trying to go out.

“Damn it, why will there be such people here?!” Zhang Yin clenched his teeth and punched the wall unhappily.

“There are all sorts of people in G17 ruin, you think Sacred Region Academy are the only people here to train?” Li Ping said.

“There are even warriors specialized to kill and hunt.”

Just as he said that, noises came out from the side and startled the trio. They immediately raised their weapons.

Just as they turned, they saw a few white figures!

“Wait! We’re on the same side!” Just as Zhang Yin and the others held their breaths, voices were heard on the opposite end.

When they looked carefully, the newcomers were wearing robes with Sacred Region Academy’s insignia as well.

“North campus class 10!?”

“South campus class 10!?”

They looked at each other for a moment and blurted out to each other.

Both class 10 teams suddenly felt camaraderie as the most impoverished people.

“Why’re you guys here?” Zhang Yin saw that the group of five was covered in dirt and looked to be in a difficult situation and asked.

“We just arrived here, but it seems that there are people above using laser rifles to kill evolved beasts. We were almost shot.” One of them said with a hint of fear in his voice.

“Where are your other 2 members?”

They saw that south campus class 10 only had 3 people and asked curiously.

“They went to deal with those people.” Li Ping replied.

“Deal with them? That’s too dangerous, they seem to be rank 3 and above and they all have unique laser rifles.” One of the guys was surprised at Li Ping’s words.

And they were all on the higher floors. If they rushed up the stairs, they would be shot by the laser rifles!!!

At the same time, a man dressed in black robes held his rifle and aimed at the stairs. As he looked down from an angle, he did not make any discovery.

‘Strange, I saw that girl rush in.’

But it was so quiet that it became scary for him.

The strange situation caused his entire body to become tense.

He placed his rifle in place. As long as a person appears, he would press on the trigger and shoot!

Bang-

A white figure suddenly appeared below!

He quickly pressed on the trigger and shot out rapid laser beams down!

But the figure disappeared without a trace again.

‘Where is she?!’

His pupils constricted as he suddenly raised his head to see a cold aura!

He wanted to react but felt a sharp pain. Blood started to flow from the center of his head.

Luo Yue remained emotionless as she looked at the person. She looked around and started running in another direction.

‘On the 20th floor at a room to the left.’

Lin Xiu muttered to himself as he ran upwards.

When he avoided the laser beams, he had already memorized their positions.

Sou sou sou-

As he stepped on the 19th floor, laser beams shot down at him.

The floor was immediately riddled with holes.

Lin Xiu kicked the wall and used the momentum to dodge.

There were more laser beams in the gravity training room and this was nothing compared to the training room.

When the next laser beam came out, Lin Xiu confirmed the position and charged forward!
