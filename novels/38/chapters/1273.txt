1274 Pang Tong

“Don’t dare to be. A guide is an important person with high status. I’m just a nameless person.”

Mr. Pang said modestly.

“But why the guide doesn’t allow us to integrate these two cities?”

At this time, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly and said lightly.

!!

The owner of Changqing City was able to take over and integrate Shachang City before, so why couldn’t he integrate these two cities?

And become a bigger Lingxian city?

“Different treatment huh?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“and also…”

Mr. Pang seems to have something to say.

“Speak.”

“The guide would like you to make a trip down once you’re awake.”

Mr. Pang said.

“Well, I have nothing to do now, I’ll go and have a look.”

Lin Xiu stretched and said.

It’s been a while since he had been in the God warrior Realm, so he should go and find out how to go to other areas to find Luo Yue.

“Haoling, you stay, I’ll go and have a look.”

Looking at Baili Haoling, Lin Xiu said.

“Alright.”

Baili Haoling shrugged helplessly.

Initially, she also wanted to go and have a look, but someone really needed to be here.

After walking out of the city lord’s mansion, Lin Xiu looked at the scene on the street and was surprised.

Because the current City Lord’s Mansion was rebuilt under the management of Lei Tong, the new buildings had more peculiar Chinese architectural features than the original ones.

But these buildings only looked this way, everything in side was the latest technology.

“Hello City Lord!”

Those warriors around who helped build the building saw Lin Xiu approaching and immediately spoke to Lin Xiu respectfully.

Their eyes were full of admiration.

Lin Xiu saved the entire Lingxian City. If it weren’t for Lin Xiu, then Liu Cheng would probably continue to blow the entire Lingxian City to pieces.

After walking out of the city, Lin Xiu walked towards the place where he first arrived at the God warrior Realm.

“You’re here?”

Not long after, he saw a slightly familiar figure.

The middle-aged guide.

“You’re looking for me, what’s the matter?”

Lin Xiu looked at him, then said lightly.

When the guide heard Lin Xiu’s words, his eyes narrowed slightly.

There seemed to be a faint killing intent in his eyes.

“Lin Xiu, do you know what you did?”

The guide stared at Lin Xiu and said lightly.

“I have no idea.”

Lin Xiu shook his head, showing a puzzled expression.

What did I do?

I fell asleep for two days and seemed to have done nothing.

“As the city lord of Lingxian City, you left Lingxian City without authorization before completing your three-year term. This is one of them.”

“The second thing is to kill the city lord of a superior city, as well as the warriors of other cities.”

“All these are enough to give you the death penalty.”

He stared at Lin Xiu and continued to speak.

“You even want to takeover Changqing City and Shachang City. This is impossible.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes after listening to his words.

“So you’re saying it’s allowed that they come and kill me and I have to wash my neck and let them kill me?”

“and…”

“Three years is too long, I can’t wait.”

Lin Xiu said directly.

It has been a while since he had arrived at the God warrior Realm and he probably understood the strength of the warriors in these big cities.

“Liu Mo is the conferred noble god, Sha Qiong, too.”

...

He stared at Lin Xiu and continued to speak.

“Do you know, if the God King finds out that the Noble God was killed, what will be the consequences?”

Noble God…

There was no change in Lin Xiu’s expression.

“I, Pang Tong, have received countless warrior gods from other lower-plane planets here. This is the first time I met someone like you.”

Speaking of this, the man who called himself Pang Tong rubbed his brows helplessly.

“If you hadn’t saved him, I would have killed you just now.”

Pang Tong stared at Lin Xiu for a while, then sighed and said.

Lin Xiu was also slightly taken aback at this time and the dark force in his palm also slowly disappeared.

Just now Lin Xiu clearly felt the killing intent coming from Pang Tong’s gaze.

Lin Xiu was also ready to fight, but he never expected that things would turn out like this.

...

However, this person’s strength was not low. Even with his Analytic eyes, it showed ‘unable to analyze’ and Lin Xiu didn’t want to fight with him.

But who did he save?

“take it.”

Just as Lin Xiu was wondering, Pang Tong directly threw a card at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu caught it quickly.

Taking a closer look, it was a black card. Apart from a light golden pattern in the middle, there was nothing special about it.

“The token for the Mutli-City Contest. This time, the competition venue is in the city of God. If you can get the ranking and canonized to be a Noble god, you can immediately obtain an identity certificate and go to any city at will.”

Pang Tong said.

Mutli-City Contest!?

At this moment, Lin Xiu frowned slightly and soon the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Isn’t this the place where Mr. Pang said that he could get the materials he needed?

This is really a coincidence.

“Recently there are other new warriors from the lower plane. I sent them to take over Changqing City and Shachang City. Let’s forget about this matter. Don’t even think about expanding Lingxian City.”

Pang Tong looked at Lin Xiu and continued.

“Anyway, you’ve already taken all the advantages.”

Speaking of this, Pang Tong seemed to have a little helplessness on his face.

“I don’t want to manage such a large area anyway.”

Lin Xiu shrugged his hands and said.

Anyway, they already emptied the warehouses in these two cities, so there was no need for the cities.

“There is still a period of time, practice hard. The strength of the people in City of God is not comparable to that of Liu Mo and Sha Qiong.”

Pang Tong said expressionlessly.

“Stronger than those two guys?”

Not only did Lin Xiu not show fear, but his eyes lit up.

If he is stronger than them, it means that as long as he kills these warriors, he can gain more experience and upgrade!

“Leave.”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s expression of excitement instead of fear, Pang Tong was speechless for a while and simply uttered a word.

Lin Xiu pouted.

“Okay, goodbye.”

Lin Xiu turned and left. After a few steps, he stopped.

“thanks.”

After that, he left without looking back.

“This kid…”

Pang Tong looked at Lin Xiu’s leaving figure and shook his head.

At the next moment, there was a look of expectation in his eyes.

“I always feel that he will grow up to be even more terrifying…”
