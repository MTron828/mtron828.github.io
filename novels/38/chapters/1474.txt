1475 God-level Warrior Skill – Spear Breaks The Sky

“Shan Hui?!”

Seeing what it was, even Zhu Long was surprised.

Shan Hui?!

Legend says that this was a monster with a human face.

As they looked carefully at the figure above the halberd, it was indeed one!

“He has a tool spirit too?!”

Tianling God King and the rest who were watching the fight had a bad feeling about it.

None of them would have thought that Sky Eye would gain a tool spirit as well.

Plus, this tool spirit seems powerful.

Lin Xiu looked at his opponent and gripped onto his long spear tightly.

His body was still now covered in gold.

There were no longer restrictions to the skills from the system.

However, even with that, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that this fight with Sky Eye would be one of the most difficult fights that he will ever have.

“Even the True God’s power cannot defeat him?”

Lin Xiu then asked Zhu Long who was next to him.

He was already at level 75! The highest that he could go.

But Lin Xiu still felt that while facing Sky Eye, it still wasn’t enough.

“The True God’s abilities would definitely be able to destroy him!”

Zhu Long roared in rage after hearing what Lin Xiu had asked.

“It is you who has not completely received the powers of the True God!”

He has not completely received them?!

Lin Xiu was confused.

Logically speaking, he would have completely absorbed the powers from the system.

Sky Eye then sneered as he stared at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu gathered his thoughts and activated the ‘Power of the Stars’.

There were then countless stars that shone brightly in the sky.

Soon, this energy then rushed into Lin Xiu’s body.

At the same time, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the energy in his body has been doubled.

‘Heavenly Array’!

With that, the entire planet was then covered with an array that was glowing in a faint white light.

No matter what, Lin Xiu had to release all of the skills that could enhance his own energy first!

Exotice Summoning!

Suddenly, there was a gap sliced open in the air.

Numerous dark evolved beasts rushed through the gap!

“The Dark Army?!”

Some of the God Kings were shocked.

Not only were these beasts huge, they seemed powerful as well.

All of these beasts went straight to Sky Eye. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Did you really think that these lowly beings would be able to get close to me?”

Sky Eye then let out a cold laugh.

As he swung his halberd, there were countless terrifying energy beams released!

All of the beasts were then chopped into smaller pieces with those beams.

The beasts released from the gaps by his skills were killed in a blink of an eye.

Lin Xiu had never hoped that these beasts could stop Sky Eye but seeing how Sky Eye managed to get rid of them so quickly, the look in his eyes changed.

Lin Xiu grabbed his own spear and rushed forward.

His weapon was now covered with a scarlet glow.

Sky Eye laughed as well, seeing how Lin Xiu was about to attack him.

With his halberd, he managed to stop Lin Xiu’s spear!

Clang clang clang – –

As both the weapons collided with each other, there was a loud sound heard.

The entire planet started shaking and even the space around them cracked.

Lin Xiu, who was now in close contact with Sky Eye through his weapon, had now realised how powerful Sky Eye actually was.

Sky Eye had such a huge weapon but the speed of his movement remained the same. They were as quick as before!

Die!!!!!!

Lin Xiu dodge the attack from Sky Eye and took the opportunity to thrust his spear forward!

Clang – –

As the tip of the spear landed on Sky Eye’s chest, it couldn’t go any further!

It was as if he had pierced on a piece of metal and there was a crisp sound heard.

How was this possible?!

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrunk uncontrollably.

Within seconds, Sky Eye was swinging his halberd at Lin Xiu once again!

The halberd was about to land on Lin Xiu’s body!

Boom – –

Lin Xiu’s body was thrown far behind by the impact of the attack.

Although he had already activated the ‘Golden Body Immortality’, he could still feel the intense pain that came from the attack.

His body was still in the air. As he was trying to balance himself, Sky Eye was already standing right in front of Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu had a bad feeling about it and tried to block the next attack with his long spear.

Clang – –

Lin Xiu’s entire body was hit and he fell straight to the ground.

“Rubbish.”

Sky Eye, who was still in the air, sneered at Lin Xiu coldly.

“Huh?”

Suddenly, he felt something coming from behind him.

As he looked up, he noticed that the entire sky was now golden in colour.

The entire sky was covered with the Flame of Chaos!

Instantly, all of them turned into a huge flaming ball and were hitting onto the ground like meteorites.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

As the flames fell toward the ground, they were dense but Sky Eye managed to dodge them and were not injured by any of the flaming balls!

“Ahhhhhh!!!”

Lin Xiu roared in rage.

Then, he rushed upwards into the air!

‘God-level warrior skills – Spear Breaks The Sky’!!!

Then, there was an enormous figure of a spear that appeared.

This was aimed directly at Sky Eye who was still in the air!

Sky Eye was still trying to dodge the flaming balls that were coming at him. When he saw the spear in the air, the look in his eyes changed.

He subconsciously lifted his halberd to stop it!

Boom – –

There was another earth-shattering sound heard.

The entire space shook and the air around was twisted from the heat.

Those on Warrior God Realm felt nervous as they watched this.

Did it work?

Lin Xiu’s skills earlier were incredible.

This should have been able to defeat Sky Eye, right?

Then, as the scene before them unfolds, they notice that Sky Eye’s body has been blasted into a million pieces!

It worked!
