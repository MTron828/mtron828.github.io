Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

These people looked at Lin Xiu who suddenly stood up like a crazy man and called out with a mocking expression.

Lin Xiu ignored the words of these people, and at this time, he went outside, looking a bit lost.

He didn’t even make payment and simply went out.

Buzzing-

There were a lot of car horns and loud noises on the street outside.

He looked outside and everything was so real.

It didn’t look fake at all.

Is this really a dream?

If this was a dream, Lin Xiu should be glad that he was lucky. After all, this was his world. Although his parents passed away, he still has friends here.

But Lin Xiu was a little unhappy.

He thought of Luo Yue, of that cold girl.

Boom–

While thinking, Lin Xiu, who walked to the street in front, knocked into someone.

“I’m sorry.” Looking up, he bumped into a man wearing a golden necklace and had tattoos on his arms.

And beside him, there were two men in the same outfit, their hair was a bit unconventional, and they looked very arrogant.

“Boy, how dare you hit our boss?”

At this moment, a man grabbed Lin Xiu’s collar with both hands, and said coldly.

“I’m sorry.” Lin Xiu said with a forced smile.

Now he felt that his body had no strength at all and was still the same weak body as before.

There was absolutely no chance of winning these people and there was no need to have a conflict with these people now.

“I’m sorry? Can I say sorry to your mother after I f*ck her?” The man who had just been knocked by Lin Xiu patted his clothes, then took off his sunglasses, his gaze was unkind.

“Keep your mouth clean.” It didn’t matter if the man mocked him, but when it comes to his deceased mother, Lin Xiu’s eyes were full of killing intent.

“Yo, boy, you’re quite daring ah?”

The man looked at Lin Xiu’s appearance at this time, and suddenly revealed a sinister smile.

“Bring him here.”

He looked at his lackey beside him, then walked into the alley.

There were some passers-by around, and when they saw this scene, they all pretended this had nothing to do with them and some were afraid of causing trouble, so they walked a few steps faster and quickly left this area.

Lin Xiu wanted to struggle, but under the pulling of these three people, Lin Xiu was still caught.

They grabbed him into the alley and the leading man took a brick from nowhere and smashed it directly on Lin Xiu’s head!

Boom–

As the brick smashed into Lin Xiu’s head, a severe pain came over him and Lin Xiu felt like he was seeing stars.

“You’re very arrogant, aren’t you?”

“Come on, be more arrogant! F*ck you!”

As he spoke, he directly kicked Lin Xiu in the abdomen, and then kicked Lin Xiu to the ground.

The others also lifted their feet and kicked Lin Xiu’s body at this time.

One foot after another, the intense pain caused Lin Xiu’s body to curl up.

“Damn...”

Lin Xiu wanted to resist, but he felt that his strength was pathetic.

“Humph! Next time you see me, crawl for me, or else I’ll kill you!”

These men kicked more than a dozen times and felt a little tired, then said a little out of breath.

Just when they were about to leave, their boss seemed to see something and stopped.

“Wait.”

He squatted down at this moment, grabbed Lin Xiu’s collar, and suddenly said as if he saw something, “Boy, you don’t look like you are rich. I’ll just take this thing and treat it as a protection fee.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he pulled something around his neck.

Lin Xiu had fresh blood dripping from his head. At this time, he looked down at his neck and could see a jade pendant.

A moon-shaped jade pendant.

Lin Xiu could clearly see the moon-shaped jade pendant, and his eyes suddenly widened.

“Tsk tsk, it looks like a good thing.” The man ignored Lin Xiu and reached out to grab the necklace.

“I got it now...”

Lin Xiu suddenly burst out laughing.

“F*ck, how dare you scare me!”

When the bastard heard Lin Xiu’s words, he was startled, stopped what he was doing, and was about to smash Lin Xiu’s head with his fist!

Lin Xiu directly blocked it with his arm, and before the man could react, he waved his fist and smashed it directly into his forehead!

Boom–

A fist hit his head, making a dull sound.

The man was hit by Lin Xiu’s punch, and before he regained his senses, Lin Xiu picked up the brick the man had just used and smashed it directly at his head!

“F*ck your mother!”

Lin Xiu cursed secretly, then took the brick and smashed at him wildly!

This bastard’s lackeys also came to their senses this time and attacked Lin Xiu!

But Lin Xiu seemed to be going crazy at this time. He ignored the attacks of other gangsters.

“Kill... he’s killing!”

These thugs were not considered strong in the first place, and were so tired from beating Lin Xiu. Looking closely, their boss seemed to have been killed by Lin Xiu!

At this time, a look of horror appeared on their faces, and in the next moment, they scattered like birds in an instant.

“Huhu...”

Lin Xiu was still panting while holding the brick in his hand.

The tingling sensation on his body was very real, and his sight seemed blurry due to the hit in the head.

“Come out! I know, it’s all fake!!!”

Lin Xiu stood here and shouted loudly.

He has now completely remembered what happened before. When his hands entered the glass ball and touched the white light, he seemed to have fallen into a coma, and appeared here in the next moment.

“If you’re not coming out, then I’ll sleep here first.”

At this time, Lin Xiu continued to shout loudly, and then laid directly on the ground looking a little out of breath. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Although he knew this was an illusion, it was too real.

Whether it was his touch or smell, it was no different from reality.

Just when Lin Xiu was lying on the ground, all the surrounding buildings seemed to have turned into gravel and began to slowly dissipate.
