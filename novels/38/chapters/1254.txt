1255 Haiwang City Comes

“Get away!!!”

Seeing Lin Xiu holding a spear to block him, Liu Cheng roared angrily.

Holding the frosty Giant Sword in both hands, he continued to attack Lin Xiu.

boom–

!!

Lin Xiu’s spear collided with the frosty giant sword he was hacking over and a loud noise erupted immediately.

Because of the existence of the dark blue hellfire on the body of the Dark Edge spear and the icy air of the frosty giant sword, it has no effect on Lin Xiu.

When the weapons of the two collided, Liu Cheng’s body flew directly to the back.

“Humph!”

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu gave a cold snort and directly pursued the victory.

These days of constant attacks, Liu Cheng has obviously consumed a lot of power.

Now he has no strength to resist anymore!

Watching Lin Xiu continue to chase after him, the pupils of Liu Cheng who flew out suddenly shrank.

At this moment, a huge hole was torn in the space behind him.

A giant black hand grabbed Liu Cheng’s body and pulled him directly into the space crack.

Before Lin Xiu arrived, the space crack was instantly closed.

Lin Xiu’s spear pierced through the air at this moment.

“Where did you go…”

Lin Xiu frowned. It was obvious that Liu Cheng was caught in the space crack.

Was he rescued?

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu felt a little pity, he would have been able to kill him just now.

Looking towards the other side, he found that Rollie’s body was shaking constantly.

The swallowed giant ice tiger seemed to be struggling continuously in Rollie body.

It made the original round body of Rollie continuously change into various shapes.

“this guy escaped?”

At this time, Baili Haoling was also riding on Xiaobai’s body and flew out together with Xiaobai.

“Well, should have been rescued.”

Lin Xiu said regretfully.

This Liu Cheng was very proud. He was provoked a few times by Lin Xiu and he has been attacking the energy barrier here for so long.

Fortunately, this energy barrier was hard enough that it cannot be broken at all.

“Is this person from Shachang City?”

Baili Haoling thought for a while and said.

“Probably not, might be from the other two big cities.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

This person was very powerful and he should not be very old.

“Rollie, have you finished swallowing?”

He didn’t think about those things anymore,

Lin Xiu looked over there.

He saw that Rollie body, which was still shaking, had gradually stabilized at this time.

“Goo.”

Rollie seemed to be hiccupping. At this time, his body slowly returned to its original small size at a speed visible to the naked eye.

In the next moment, Rollie jumped directly onto Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

“Rollie?”

Seeing Rollie that jumped onto his shoulder again, Lin Xiu subconsciously called out.

But Rollie seemed to be asleep and ignored Lin Xiu.

“are you asleep?”

Lin Xiu said dumbfoundedly.

“Rollie swallowed that white tiger, it’s really amazing.”

Baili Haoling stared at Rollie standing on Lin Xiu’s shoulde.

Lin Xiu was equally astonished. Rollie became more and more mysterious. What exactly was this Rollie that he dug out from the body of that evolved beast?

Lin Xiu always felt that it was not just an ordinary evolved beast.

“Hoo hoo.”

At the same time, in the city on the other side, Liu Cheng was half kneeling on the ground, panting.

There was hot sweat on his forehead and he looked extremely tired.

The battle with Lin Xiu did consume a lot of his strength.

...

And just now he had the feeling that he was almost killed by Lin Xiu.

My own mount…

Thinking of the icy white tiger being devoured by that weird evolved beast, Liu Cheng clenched his fists tightly, showing an extremely ferocious expression on his face.

“Thought you would be able to get that kid’s head back, but I didn’t expect you to attack that energy barrier for seven days and seven nights, exhausting your physical strength first!”

In the main hall of Changqing City, Liu Mo said with a gloomy face.

“If your Uncle Chen hadn’t rescued you, you would have been killed by that kid!”

Hearing Liu Mo’s words, Liu Cheng immediately showed displeasure on his face, “Impossible!”

“I was just a little careless, that kid, I will kill him with my own hands!”

Thinking of Lin Xiu’s face, Liu Cheng’s eyes showed infinite killing intent.

“Can you break the energy barrier of Lingxian City?”

Liu Mo stared at Liu Cheng and said lightly.

...

Liu Cheng wanted to say something, but at this moment, it felt like a lump was stuck in his throat.

That’s right, the energy barrier is too strong, there is no way to break through it.

He attacked one point for seven days, but failed to break through.

Now even if he went there again, as long as Lin Xiu didn’t come out, there was nothing he could do.

“You guys first come up with a solution on how to break through that energy barrier.”

At this time, Liu Mo glanced at the warriors in the hall, then said aloud.

“yes!”

The warriors around heard Liu Mo’s words and immediately responded. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

At this time, Lin Xiu was sitting cross-legged in the City Lord’s Mansion of Lingxian City, doing daily practice.

For some reason, those dark energies never appeared after being absorbed.

And Lin Xiu couldn’t feel it in his body, which made Lin Xiu feel extremely depressed.

He finally managed to swallow those dark energies through the system’s skill ‘Engulf’ yet there was no change at all. Isn’t that funny.

“City Lord! City Lord!”

And at this moment, a hurried voice came from behind.

“What’s wrong?”

Hearing Mr. Pang’s words, Lin Xiu frowned immediately, then slowly opened his eyes.

Did someone come over again?

In order to prevent anyone from attacking during this time, Lin Xiu has already unfolded the energy barrier.

It is impossible for someone to break through this energy barrier.

Unless a large number of god warriors or the God King came.

“Haiwang City… The people from Haiwang City are here!”

Mr. Pang said, panting.

“People from Haiwang City?”

Lin Xiu frowned.

“Is it the kid from last time?”

“Probably not, I didn’t see that person.”

Mr. Pang shook his head.

“Where are they now?”

Lin Xiu stood up and looked at the sky, but he didn’t find any warriors.

And they didn’t hear the sound coming from outside the energy barrier.

It seems that no one launched an attack on this energy barrier.

“Outside the city gate.”

Mr. Pang replied.

“And also…”

At this time, Mr. Pang’s face was a little strange, as if he wanted to say something.
