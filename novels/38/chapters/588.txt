Chapter 589: This Is The Higher Floor!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The greatest boxer of the previous century, Zhang Kuang!!

This man was just like his name; an arrogant man who was one of the best in his skills.

He was considered one of the legendaries when it comes to boxing.

“Why were his notes placed here?” Lin Xiu muttered to himself as he was confused.

Back in the days where the warrior skills weren’t as complete as they are now and weren’t as convenient as how they are now, the only way of passing down one’s skill was to teach them personally or write them down on a piece of paper.

This was the reason why there were a lot of skills that have already been lost.

Lin Xiu flipped through it before looking at the other books.

On the same shelf, it was all filled with books that talked about boxing and both of them were original hand written books that have been kept for ages. It consisted of the notes taken by those who trained it and also some of the pointers for the skills that they have created.

When Lin Xiu read through it, he was surprised.

This was a treasure for warriors!

Although it may be much slower to learn them compared to the warrior skills card, this method would allow them to understand how and why he started boxing. The steps that he took to develop the skill and as well as the roots of how it happened. If anyone gets to train with these books, their abilities will greatly increase.

The most important thing was that most of these skills have been lost and there was no one who could pass it down!

This part of the shelf were books about boxing, what about the rest?

He took a good look around and noticed that at the corner of every shelf, there was a small word carve onto it.

“Sword”, “Machete, “Stick”...

After one round, he realised that the books inside here were arranged according to the type of weapon.

Each of them were about the particular skills associated with the weapons and it had books for every level, from the very basics to the diamond warriors skills.

What about spears?

Lin Xiu searched for it in the room and found the corner that had books that talked about spears.

He walked forwards, trying to get a closer look when he saw a man with a cape looking at him from the stairs.

“Have you had enough?!”

A deep voice came out from the man’s mouth.

Lin Xiu was stunned when he heard the voice. After taking a good look at the man, he still couldn’t see the man’s face as there was a cape covering his head.

“Who are you?”

Lin Xiu grabbed onto his spear and looked at the man cautiously.

He immediately activated his Analytical Eyes but it showed that it was unable to analyse the man who sat in front of him.

Plus, his system interface was glowing with a bright light as if it was warning him.

This man is powerful!

“Let me see, how many of you were here...”

The man with the deep voice stood up and started mumbling to himself.

When the man stood up, Lin Xiu couldn’t finally see his face.

It was a man with a head full of white hair and was covered with a curly, white beard.

His hair might be white but he didn’t look old; instead, he looked like a middle aged man.

“The fourth one?”

“I think so.”

“When they got here, all of them started looking for ways to get to the next level.”

“You ..... however, do not seem to be in a hurry and even looked through these books.”

While the middle aged man continued mumbling to himself, his figure suddenly disappeared into thin air.

Then, when he appeared again, he was already standing right in front of Lin Xiu!

His eyes that were previously cloudy and bored suddenly looked sharp.

Lin Xiu was shocked as well as this man’s speed was incredible! He was so fast!

It looked as if he teleported!

“Tell me, which family are you from?”

“I don’t belong to any.” Lin Xiu might be shocked but he still shook his head and answered.

“Hmm?”

“If I’m not wrong, you are now at rank 7.”

“Rank 7.... And you got here on your own. Not bad.”

“What about the abilities of those who were here previously?”

Lin Xiu started to relax and asked the man a question. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Try guessing?”

The man had an evil smile on his face that goosebumps all over Lin Xiu.

“The peak of rank 8!”

Before Lin Xiu could say anything, the man already told him the answer.

The peak of rank 8!

The look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed.

As he thought of his own abilities, it would still be impossible for him to fight a rank 8 warrior at its peak even if he used the system.

No wonder there would be others who made it this far.

The middle aged man turned around and walked around. He seemed to be a clean freak as he slowly rearranged the books that Lin Xiu took from the shelf and placed them back in a neat and tidy manner.

“Would you like to know who else came into this floor?” The man asked as he was arranging the books.

“I don’t”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

The man did not expect Lin Xiu’s answer as he paused for a minute before smiling and said, “Interesting.”

“But since you don’t want to know, I want to tell you.”

“They’re the founders of the Sacred Region Academy, Bai Litao and his friends.”

Bai Litao....that’s the name of Dean Bai Li.

“That’s impossible.”

Lin Xiu shook his head subconsciously. Dean Bai Li was one of them who built the school. Why would they challenge the Tower of Trials instead? According to what he was told, there were other students who made it to the 100th floor about 8-9 years ago...

“From when the school was found, you are the first one to reach this floor.”

“But I heard...”

“Fake. Did you really think that anyone would be able to make it here? The 90th and the 91st floor would have killed so many people from your school.” The middle aged man sneered.

Lin Xiu recalled his experience on those floors and agreed as the two floors were extremely terrifying.

An ordinary person would only be waiting for his death on those floors.

“They aren’t the ones who created the Tower of Trials.” The man suddenly disappeared and once again reappeared in front of Lin Xiu.

“They’re not?”

The man did not answer his question but there was a lonely look in his eyes.

“Forget about it since it’s already in the past.”

Lin Xiu was shocked when he realised that he might have learnt another secret of the Sacred Region Academy.

However, he only knew a small part of it and was not allowed to know more.

This was because the middle aged man before him refused to tell him more.

“How do I get to the 95th floor?”

Lin Xiu looked at him curiously.

“The next floor?”

“HAHAHAHAHAHAH.....”

When he heard Lin Xiu’s question, the middle aged man stopped and started laughing out loud.

“You don’t know?”

“This is the highest floor on the tower.”
