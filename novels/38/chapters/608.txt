Chapter 609: Are You Guys Convinced Now?

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Boom –

As Lin Xiu swung his spear, a large number of flames burst out in the next moment!

The flames turned into giant bird figures and charged towards the surroundings!

“What!!!”

The warriors that were rushing over were hit by the flaming bird, and most of them flew out directly!

The flames burned their bodies, causing them to feel intense pain.

However, some warriors dodged, and in the next moment, all of them used their powerful skills to attack Lin Xiu!

Boom boom boom —

The whole ground shook continuously.

But at this time, Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared.

“Where did he go!?”

When some warriors saw this scene, their eyes widened, filled with disbelief.

“Goodbye!”

Just as they looked around, they heard a voice coming from the other side!

When they turned around suddenly, they could clearly see that Lin Xiu had appeared in the sky behind them!

And at this time, as Lin Xiu waved his Dark Edge spear in the air, at this moment, a large number of flaming birds burst out.

And in the next moment, all these flaming birds converged to form a very huge flaming phoenix!

The flaming phoenix hovered in the air and charged directly below!

“Careful!”

President Wu Tian’s expression changed greatly when he saw this scene.

He did not expect that Lin Xiu would be able to use such a powerful skill, and the scope of this skill was too extensive!

Those warriors’ eyes widened and their bodies trembled slightly.

They wanted to escape, but it was too late!

Boom—

As the flaming phoenix charged over, the entire ground shook violently.

It was as if a terrifying explosion had occurred as a strong airflow was emitted around, causing Ouyang Hang and others who were not far away to be hit by the powerful airflow and flew out a certain distance.

“Damn it! What kind of perverted skill did this guy use...”

At this moment, Ouyang Hang couldn’t help but cursed. He held a pillar next to him to prevent himself from being blown out by the gust of wind.

Soon, as the impact of this terrifying explosion disappeared and Lin Xiu’s figure appeared.

“Young man, isn’t this a bit too much?”

At the same time, President Wu Tian also appeared not far from Lin Xiu and said to Lin Xiu.

Taking a closer look at the surroundings, you could see that the surroundings had become a mess, and many of the surrounding buildings were now destroyed because of the impact of Lin Xiu’s skills just now.

And those warriors just now all fell to the ground and suffered a lot of injuries.

But compared to Zhao Qian, who was seriously injured, their injuries were still relatively minor.

“I’ve already controlled the power of my skills and their lives are not at risk,” Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

President Wu Tian frowned slightly. What Lin Xiu said was the truth. Although the sensation caused by the skills just now seemed to be very big, in general, these warriors were not seriously injured.

However, if Lin Xiu hadn’t suppressed his skills, these warriors wouldn’t have it easy.

“Are you guys convinced now?”

Lin Xiu stood on the same spot at this time, glanced at the surrounding warriors who were lying on the ground, and said.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the bodies of those warriors who made eye contact with Lin Xiu trembled.

The strength that Lin Xiu showed just now was indeed too terrifying that they didn’t even dare think of ??confronting Lin Xiu at all.

They were simply not on the same level at all!

“It’s over, when are we going to Sky City?”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and said to President Wu Tian.

“Tomorrow at noon, you guys come here and I will personally take you there.”

President Wu Tian touched his beard and said aloud.

He now has a faint feeling that Lin Xiu’s team was likely to be able to fight against those powerful teams in Sky City!

And this team came out of his division. If Lin Xiu and others achieve good results, it will be good for him.

“Okay.”

Lin Xiu smiled, then glanced around and continued to say, “But now, I think it’s better to send them all to the hospital for treatment.”

“Let’s get going.”

After speaking, Lin Xiu walked up to Ouyang Hang and the others and said.

“Okay.” Huang Zhen and Qian Yao nodded at this time, and there was still a look of shock on their faces.

Although they already felt that Lin Xiu was very strong, the scene just now gave them too much shock.

There were more than 200 warriors! And most of them were rank 6 yet they were simply swept away by Lin Xiu’s skills.

Just now, some of the warriors used ‘Sphere’, but they were still blasted away by the powerful impact, and hit the wall – they all suffered a lot of injuries. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Soon, a large number of medical personnel came to carry these warriors away one after another.

“You kid...you’re really a monster...” Ouyang Hang came back to his senses at this time, looking at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

Originally, he thought that after his strength had risen to rank 7, he could fight against Lin Xiu.

But he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu’s progress was even more terrifying, making him feel like he couldn’t understand the world anymore.

“Perverted, really perverted.” Ouyang Hang continued to curse.

“I said it – you’re too rubbish.” Baili Haoling, who was eating a popsicle, said at this time.

Hearing Baili Haoling’s words, Ouyang Hang felt as if he had been stabbed in the chest, and felt extremely uncomfortable.

This afternoon, everyone was hanging out in Nanyang City.

Because there was no battle, they were very free.

Lin Xiu also enjoyed the rare leisure time and did not cultivate.

Ouyang Hang, Huang Zhen, and Qian Yao were looking at things in a warrior union store, while Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling were sitting at the table outside.

“Hey, how did you get this jade pendant?”

Baili Haoling saw the moon-shaped jade pendant hanging around Lin Xiu’s neck and her eyes lit up.

“What do you want?”

Lin Xiu looked at Baili Haoling warily and said.

“Tsk, why are you so nervous? I won’t rob you.”

Baili Haoling pouted and said.

As if!

Lin Xiu added these two words for her. It was obvious from the look in her eyes that she was eyeing the jade pendant around his neck.

“I won’t give you this.”

Lin Xiu glared at her and said.

“Oh, don’t worry, being a teacher is not the kind of person who will take away something that people love.”

Baili Haoling said while shaking her head.

“By the way, you know, the origin of this jade pendant is very extraordinary.”
