Chapter 580: Lin Xiu is a BUG?

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu walked into the Tower of Trials, then used the last challenge card to go directly to the 60th floor.

But when he reached the 60th floor, Lin Xiu found a familiar figure.

“Oh? It’s you?”

As soon as Lin Xiu arrived on this floor, he saw Chen Haoran also here. He was walking back and forth, as if he was thinking about something.

“It’s you?” Hearing Lin Xiu’s voice, Chen Haoran suddenly turned around to look at Lin Xiu and found Lin Xiu’s figure.

Seeing Lin Xiu, to be honest, he instinctively felt a little scared.

Because what happened yesterday was really shocking.

“Hey, haven’t you succeeded in your challenge yet?”

Lin Xiu said curiously at this time.

“Not yet...not yet.” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Chen Haoran said a little embarrassedly.

Originally, he was confident that he could succeed in the challenge yesterday, but didn’t expect that this time, it would be the same as before, he was unable to break through.

“But I think I’m about to get through. Look at the arrangement of these floors – I guess they are arranged according to some special method. As long as you can see the pattern, you should be able to clear it.” Chen Haoran told Lin Xiu his analysis.

“Is it so difficult?” Lin Xiu was stunned when he heard Chen Haoran’s analysis, then said subconsciously.

Is it so difficult?

Chen Haoran was immediately struck by Lin Xiu’s words and he stood rooted to the ground.

Before he could say anything, Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand, jumped and attacked the ceiling.

“Break!”

Following Lin Xiu’s loud shout, flames erupted from the spear and stabbed directly at the ceiling!

Boom—

With the attack of the Dark Edge spear, there seemed to be violent vibrations all around.

“Since there’s no other way, I’ll pierce it through. Anyway, it’s the next floor above this layer.”

As Lin Xiu spoke, he frantically waved his Dark Edge spear.

Seeing this scene, Chen Haoran was stunned.

He wanted to persuade Lin Xiu that this would not work, but he didn’t expect that in the next moment, a purple light covered Lin Xiu’s body and Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared instantly.

“That worked!?”

Chen Haoran’s eyes widened and his mouth opened as if it could fit an apple, with a look of disbelief on his face.

“Huh? It’s really possible.” Lin Xiu didn’t expect that this would work.

As soon as he opened his eyes, he found a bloody mouth biting towards him!

Lin Xiu’s reaction speed was very fast. At this time, he retreated, then holding the Dark Edge spear, he directly attacked!

Bang bang bang-

Some warriors who knew what happened yesterday were all standing in front of the screen below, watching how many floors Lin Xiu would get through.

But when they saw Lin Xiu’s record, they were instantly dumbfounded.

61, 62, 63...

The number of floors Lin Xiu challenged was changing wildly and the speed was very fast.

“This... this is not a bug, right?” Some warriors widened their eyes in disbelief.

He didn’t start the challenge from the first floor but from the 60th floor!

Moreover, Lin Xiu had not challenged the above floors before. If a freshman ascended like a rocket, it would be too terrifying.

Although these warriors said it was a ‘bug’, their hearts were still full of shock.

And some warriors also saw Lin Xiu’s performance yesterday. Although they were shocked, they didn’t have any doubts.

“Huh? This kid, he made a mess for me as soon as he came back.”

At the same time, Dean Baili, who was in the dean’s room, shook his head helplessly when he heard the reported information.

“Dean, will the Murong family have any opinion...” A middle-aged man hesitated for a while, then said to Dean Baili.

“Don’t worry.” Dean Baili said while stroking his beard.

“And this was the mess that the kid caused. When the time comes, he will just have to clean it up himself.”

Dean Baili looked at the floor of Lin Xiu’s challenge displayed on the screen. Now he has reached the 89th floor.

Looking at this scene, his eyes were full of surprise.

When Lin Xiu came back this time, his growth was beyond his expectations.

After so many years, he has never seen a warrior as talented as Lin Xiu.

“Do you think that this kid can break through to the top floor?” Dean Baili said to the middle-aged man.

At this time, the middle-aged man looked up at the screen on the wall behind Dean Baili and saw that Lin Xiu had already challenged the 89th floor and he couldn’t help showing a look of shock.

He would not be too surprised if Lin Xiu reached the 89th floor but he was surprised that Lin Xiu had entered the tower of trials for the first time yesterday and now he had reached the 89th floor, this was too terrifying.

“In the past eight or nine years, no one has cleared it. Although he is very powerful, I think it would be challenging.” The middle-aged man pondered for a while, then said his thoughts.

“I think it should be possible.” Dean Baili thought about it first, then said aloud.

“Break!”

At the same time, Lin Xiu on the 89th floor, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, stabbed the giant evolved beast, directly piercing its body!

Killing it with one blow, Lin Xiu’s figure instantly teleported to the 90th floor in the next moment!

The 90th floor was different from other floors, it could be said to be a watershed existence.

In the Sacred Region academy, it was known as the ten gates of hell!

After Chuangwang has passed the ten stages of hell, he will be able to climb to the top one hundred floors, one hundred floors and no one knows what is there. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Everyone heard a legend that as long as you reach the 100th floor, you will be able to gain powerful strength.

Because watching the history of Sacred Region academy, you would find that every person who reached the top eventually becomes a rank 9 warrior and is a powerful warrior in the world.

Gurgle–

As soon as Lin Xiu teleported to the 90th floor, he realized that the place he was in was not land, but seemed to be in the ocean!

Lin Xiu took a few mouthfuls of water accidentally.

Lin Xiu just didn’t realize at first and seemed a little uncomfortable. The next moment, it was as if he was on land.

The first level of the ten levels of hell, the 90th floor, was a very difficult level for most warriors, because this level was underwater!

The whole floor was full of water, all the way to the ceiling.
