Chapter 277: Rob!

Sou-

Following a flash of light, Dark Edge pierced into the Giant Black Rock Beast’s other eye!

Bang-

Following a loud bang, the eye exploded!

Lin Xiu was not finished. Dark Edge moved like a white light and continued to stab into its eye.

Roar–

As though feeling the immense pain, the Giant Black Rock Beast roared out loud.

“Go and die!!!”

Lin Xiu roared and exerted all his strength with Dark Edge.

Dark Edge continued to stab inside the brain and destroyed it from the inside!

Bang bang bang-

The Giant Black Rock Beast let out a huge roar and struggled incessantly as it smashed its claws on the ground.

The ground started to tremble.

It had forgotten to use its claws to attack Lin Xiu already!

‘Still not dead!?’

Lin Xiu frowned and went into its eyes again before using Dark Edge to pull its brain out.

He then descended to the ground.

It was no longer able to use its claws to hit Lin Xiu as it was blind and used them to smack its own head.

Bang-

Following a series of loud sounds, more blood started to flow out from its head.

The blood oozed and flowed down to the ground.

Rumble-

Its body dropped to the ground and was no longer able to move.

“Is it dead?”

Lin Xiu stood at the same and heaved a sigh of relief.

The rank 6 evolved beast was too large and killing it proved to be a difficult feat.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing rank 6 evolved beast, obtaining 50 million experience points!”

’50 million?’

Although it was a lot, it was still an utterly inadequate amount for him.

He needed 2.5 billion experience points to level up.

“Is it dead?” Guo Ling walked over and asked.

Lin Xiu’s moves had surprised her. She did not expect Lin Xiu to be far better than them.

He was clearly a rank 5 warrior!

“En, it’s dead.” Lin Xiu confirmed.

As the system would not be wrong, the notification from the experience points confirmed that it was killed.

“What the hell is that…”

Qiu Li and the others walked over and stood by the gigantic beast and said.

From the eyes to the neck, everyone could see a bloodied hole that was formed by Lin Xiu stabbing Dark Edge in.

Blood kept on flowing out from this hole.

A dense bloodstench pervaded the air.

Crack crack-

Chen Jin was already busy snapping photos with a handphone.

He had never seen such a terrifying rank 6 evolved beast before.

Lin Xiu looked at the corpse and walked over with Dark Edge.

‘The rank 6 odd crystal should be in its head…’

Sou-

Just as Lin Xiu was able to stab Dark Edge into the head and take the odd crystal out, a noise came out from another side.

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted and he stabbed out to his right!

Clank-

The spear head struck something metallic and produced a loud and crisp sound!

‘What’s going on!?’

Guo Ling and the others immediately reacted as they saw a man colliding with Lin Xiu with his saber.

Bang-

At the same time, the large head of the Giant Black Rock Beast suddenly exploded!

Flesh and blood splattered everywhere.

And a large black object dropped to the ground.

Rank 6 odd crystal!

At the next moment, a black figure rushed out and picked up the odd crystal.

“Zeze, the odd crystal of a rank 6 evolved beast inside Dark Forest turns out to be black as well.” The man held the odd crystal and commented.

“Brat, we’re taking it.” The man with the saber sneered at Lin Xiu and said.

He had a scar on his cheek as well.

That spanned across from his forehead to the opposite cheek.

It would be easy to remove the scar with plastic surgery, but the man obviously did not do so. This meant that the scar most probably came from Dark Forest and he did not have the time to schedule a surgery yet.

The scar made him look even more terrifying and sinister.

Rank 6 warrior!

Lin Xiu activated Analytic Eye and saw the man’s stats.

And his various stats were much higher than his. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

But he had unlocked gene lock twice and his concealed strength could be said to be peak rank 6 warrior.

But Fury’s cooldown was three days and he was unable to use it yet.

“Who are you!?”

Guo Ling swept her gaze across and saw that aside from the two men, there were other people walking over.

They were all dressed in battle robes and carrying bags that were extremely full.

“We are taking this odd crystal.”

The man already had the odd crystal in his hand and looked at Guo Ling and the others and replied indifferently.

“It’s yours just because you say so?!”

Qiu Li glared at the man and sneered while tightening his grip on his saber.

They were all waiting to loot and rob others.

Lin Xiu killed the Giant Black Rock Beast with great difficulty but was robbed of the spoils of war. This made Qiu Li infuriated.

“If I say it’s mine, it’s mine.”

The man looked at Qiu Li and replied indifferently.

Just as he said that, the men that were walking over turned to look at Qiu Li.

Qiu Li’s expression changed under the many pairs of eyes.

By relying on his instincts, he could easily tell that they were powerful!

They were most probably rank 6 warriors, some even peak rank 6!
