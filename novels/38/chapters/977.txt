Chapter 978: Similar to a Gaming World

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The map was divided into five parts.

The grassfield, the desert, the hills, the ancient and the ocean.

All five pieces join together to form the little world inside the sage warrior space.

“On this map, there are five parts here and each part has a hidden energy rock. It is said that once you find these rocks, you would be able to get the ultimate inheritance from the sage warrior.”

Duan Zheyan pointed at one of the buttons on the projection as he mentioned it to Lin Xiu.

!!

There were five empty windows that appeared on the projection.

“I have stayed here for ten years and I didn’t find any of it.”

Duan Zheyan said helplessly towards Lin Xiu.

“This place feels like a gaming world.”

Lin Xiu said to Duan Zheyan.

“You’re not wrong. It is similar.”

Duan Zheyan nodded his head.

“Plus, this little thing has an analytical function as well.”

With that said, he clicked onto another button that was on the projection.

The entire screen turned into an analytical mode.

He turned his wrist around and aimed it towards the robots that were attacking Lin Xiu earlier.

“Target: S grade robots.”

“Status: Damaged ( unable to repair ).”

“Look here.”

Zhe Yan pointed at the projection.

“This is interesting.”

The corner of Lin Xiu’s lips deviated upwards.

Before he became a sage warrior, Lin Xiu was indeed curious to see what this place has.

But, when he became a sage warrior, he felt that the things that he could get from this space wouldn’t be as useful anymore.

Now that he has learnt all this, he has started to get interested again.

Since this space was created by some of the strongest warriors from a long time ago, there must be incredible things hidden in this space.

There were five areas here with five different energy source stone.

“This is the grassfield?”

“Is there a town here?”

“Yes.”

Duan Yanzhe quickly nodded his head.

“Bring me there.”

“Sure!”

With Duan Zheyan leading the way, Lin Xiu followed behind him.

Everything around here looked similar to the real world. There were only some birds and little animals that were surprising to Lin Xiu.

These little animals were actually robots.

They were just made to look very similar to a real one.

“Hello.”

When Lin Xiu and Duan Zheyan got to the town, one of the men standing by the gates greeted Lin Xiu.

“This is a robot too?”

Lin Xiu looked at the robot standing before him that looked exactly like a real human and asked Duan Zheyan.

“En. Other than those who enter into this space, most of the things here are robots.”

Duan Zheyan explained it to Lin Xiu.

“Oh! You should buy a watch like mine. It’s very useful to have it in this place.”

As they continued walking, Duan Zheyan pointed at one of the shops and told Lin Xiu about the watch.

“Hello, what would you like to buy?”

Lin Xiu had just walked into the shop and there was already a salesperson greeting him.

“I’ll take a look on my own.”

“Alright.”

When Lin Xiu answered, the salesperson nodded his head and left.

There were multiple artificial intelligence robots walking around the shop in sync.

“It does feel like the real world.”

Lin Xiu took a good look at his surroundings and he was quite surprised.

The shops sold everything that was needed. There are food, clothes and daily necessities.

“This is why you could survive here for so long?”

Lin Xiu asked Duan Zheyan.

Duan Zheyan awkwardly nodded his head.”

He has been here for ten years. Not only has he failed to improve his skills, he didn’t even find the ultimate inheritance.

“Hello. This would cost 10 gold coins.”

Lin Xiu picked up a watch and walked over to the counter. The robot by th counter then asked for 10 gold coins.

“Ten gold coins. Is that a lot?”

Lin Xiu asked Duan Zheyan.

“It’s alright.”

Duan Zheyan didn’t say much but from the look on his face, he was a little heartbroken.

These gold coins looked weird.

“There’s a card inside it.”

Lin Xiu looked at one of the gold coins and said.

“En. This is why no one is able to make gold coins on their own.” Duan Zheyan said helplessly.

No matter how much money in the outside world, it couldn’t be used in this world.

“How do you get gold coins?”

Lin Xiu asked as they were walking out of the store.

“At the mission centre. Just complete the mission and you’ll be rewarded with gold coins.

“Usually, one mission would be rewarded with one gold coin.”

“Only S grade missions would give up to 30 gold coins.”

As Duan Yanzhe was talking about the gold coins, he felt heartbroken once again.

The robots that were destroyed earlier, cost him half of the savings that he had.

Lin Xiu was now busy experimenting with his new watch and soon, he managed to enter all of his information. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

After turning it on, he managed to turn on the projection to see the options and functions available on the watch.

There were only three functions that included the map, scanning and collect.

When he clicked on ‘collect’, there were five empty windows.

Lin Xiu guessed that these windows were designed for the energy source stone.

“Everyone must have this when they’re here?”

Lin Xiu shook the watch that was now on his wrist as he asked Duan Yanzhe.

“Yes. Without it, it would be difficult to complete certain missions.”

Duan Yanzhe nodded his head.

“By the way, you’ve been here for years but you never figured out how to get these stones?”

Lin Xiu asked Duan Yanzhe.

“Nope. Not a clue.”

Duan Yanzhe then gave another bitter smile.

“Let’s take a look.”

Lin Xiu stopped walking.

This was because the building standing before him was the mission centre.

“Hello, adventurer, what mission would you like to take today?”

As Lin Xiu walked into the building, there was a bearded man by the counter that asked Lin Xiu and Duan Zheyan.

He waved his hands while greeting them and there was a projection that could be seen next to it.

There was a list that was projected onto the wall.

Missions of C grade were at the lowest and S grade were the highest.

“Missions with C grade would reward only 1 gold coin and some of them have no rewards too. With your abilities, you should be able to easily complete an S grade mission.”

Duan Zheyan spoke to Lin Xiu.

“Which of these missions have you completed?”

Lin Xiu looked at the list of missions and asked Duan Zheyan.

“In the beginning, I’ve only done 2 C grade missions and I slowly accepted missions that were harder. The best one that I’ve done would be the S grade mission since it would give me 30 gold coins but they will only refresh it once every year.”

Duan Zheyan explained to Lin Xiu.

“Have you…not done all these missions even once?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes in suspicion.
