Chapter 1071: Ready to Move

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Pfft – –

All because the evolved beast that he had formed with the energy of his source mark got killed, he spat a mouthful of blood.

His body was also attacked by the backlash.

Kong – –

Then, the evolved beast that came out of the opening, came after him instead!

!!

Its mouth was opened wide, about to eat him up alive.

“AHHHHHH!!!”

As he screamed, he tried to kill the evolved beast with the sword that was in his hands.

Boom – –

However, he was severely injured and his body did not have much energy left.

Boom – –

Then, his body was then slapped by the claws of the evolved beast and he fell straight to the ground.

It was followed by another loud crash.

Bai Qiong, who was now on the ground, uncontrollably splattered blood all over the place.

His eyes were wide open as he stared at the animal that was coming at him from above and there was nothing he could do to defend himself.

Nooooo!!!!!

He prayed silently deep inside but it was too late.

The evolved beast was getting closer and closer to his body.

Its mouth was wide open and it tore Bai Qiong’s body into pieces.

There was blood seen everywhere.

At the same time, there was a notification that came from his system for killing another warrior.

Although Bai Qiong had been killed by the beast that came from space, the EXP still belonged to Lin Xiu.

As he looked at his progress bar, there was an increase of 10%.

He only got a 10% increase after killing 2 sage warriors. This was too little.

Lin Xiu shook his head. Soon, the array around them disappeared.

This included the one that was around Ye Kai.

“Young master, are you alright?”

Ye Kai came out of the array and quickly checked on Lin Xiu.

“I’m fine.”

Lin Xiu answered calmly.

Although he had minor injuries from earlier when he didn’t see the attack coming, most of them had already recovered on their own.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was not injured, Ye Kai let out a breath of relief.

“Looks like it isn’t safe here as well. Uncle Ye, let’s look for another place to rest.”

Lin Xiu looked around before suggesting it to Ye Kai.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head. From the situation earlier, it was true that they could no longer stay here.

Just as Lin Xiu suspected, as soon as they left, there were men headed in their way.

“Find them! Continue the search!”

These men were from the Bai family.

The look on their faces was awful.

There was someone messing around in the Bai estate but they couldn’t find who it was. This was definitely a humiliation!

Bai Di City was a huge place and there were a lot of deserted areas around it.

Lin Xiu and Ye Kai were now on top of a mountain.

“How strong is the Chen family?”

When Lin Xiu got to the top, he turned to ask Ye Kai.

“Chen Jing, the head of the family, is a sage warrior and there should be two more in the family.”

After hearing what Lin Xiu asked, Ye Kai thought carefully about it before answering.

Three sage warriors in total?

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

If there were only 3 sage warriors, it wouldn’t be much of a problem for him.

“Uncle Ye, you should absorb the energy here first. Early tomorrow morning, we will be heading for the Road of Ice and Fire.”

Lin Xiu thought about it before informing Ye Kai.

They weren’t in a rush now to deal with the Chen family. They would head to the Road of Ice and Fire first, complete the mission, get ‘Silence’ and also get their hands on the Orchid of Heaven. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“The Road of Ice and Fire?”

“Young Master, you want to go to the Road of Ice and Fire?”

After hearing what Lin Xiu was saying, Ye Kai looked incredibly shocked.

The Road of Ice and Fire was a horrifying place. It was said that even a sage warrior would not be able to come out alive.

“En. I want to get ‘Silence’.”

Lin Xiu spoke calmly.

‘Silence’?!

“You found the skill?!”

Ye Kai’s pupil shrunk uncontrollably.

‘Silence’ was one of the top three warrior skills of the Bai family.

Back then when the Ye family was annihilated, these skills were left behind.

“En. I’ve got clues about them.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“I want to get them back.”

Lin Xiu looked at the sky as he mumbled to himself.

Soon, the night passed and morning came.

Ever since last night, Ye Kai has been continuously cultivating.

He was trying his best to absorb all of the energy from the odd crystal.

This process was an extremely long one.

Lin Xiu took the invitation card in his hand and headed to the other side of Bai Di City.

In one of the bars in a new area of Bai Di City.

If one took a closer look, they would be able to see lots of warriors gathered together.

These warriors were either standing or sitting together.

But, all of them were definitely extremely powerful men.

Lin Xiu took a good look at them with his analytic eye.

All of them were sage warriors.

There were at least 20 of them.

So many of them?

Lin Xiu looked around and he couldn’t help but frowned.

“Yo? Even a kid got invited?”

As Lin Xiu walked into the place, all of the warriors turned and stared at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu had activated his skill – ‘Disguise’. At this point, his strength was merely the level of a new respected warrior.

The warriors sitting inside the bar were all sage warriors.

“Young man, are you a waiter?”

“If you aren’t, then you’re at the wrong place.”

One of the men who was muscular stared at Lin Xiu before speaking to him in a cold tone.

The rest of them stared at him as well and started releasing their energy.

This was an invisible energy. If it was any ordinary warriors, they would not have been able to withstand it. They would have flown far away.

However, Lin Xiu was still able to remain on the same spot and it looked effortless.

When the rest of them saw this, the sage warriors were all extremely surprised.

“This is the address written. I’m at the right place.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes before playing with the invitation card by spinning it on the tip of his fingers.

“Where did you get that?!”

The muscular man looked at the invitation card in Lin Xiu’s hand and he couldn’t help but frowned.

“Well, I have the invitation card which shows that I am allowed here. Isn’t that right?”

Lin Xiu ignored him and went to the bar.

“Please give me an energy drink.”

Lin Xiu asked politely.

“Sure.”

When the waiter heard what Lin Xiu wanted, he nodded his head.

“Young one, you’re being too arrogant.”

The middle-aged man that was muscular was looking mad.

The way that Lin Xiu had ignored him was the biggest humiliation ever.

Then, he raised his right hand and started gathering his energy together.

Soon, the energy was in the shape of a ball the size of an egg.

You’re dead!
