Chapter 234: Entering The Tower Of Tournament Again!

Not long after, Lin Xiu saw that it was almost time. He took a deep breath and turned off the laser training directly.

“Luo Yue…”

Just when Lin Xiu turned around and wanted to call Luo Yue, he remembered that Luo Yue hadn’t come today.

He had been cultivating here with Luo Yue in the past and got a little used to telling her every time he was done.

When he looked back, he saw that Zhang Yin and Li Ping were in the corner. The two of them were already pale at this time like they were trying very hard to hang in there.

Lin Xiu quickly adjusted the gravity and removed it.

“Phew.” Li Ping and Zhang Yin fell on the ground and panted.

They felt like they were going to die just now.

“Are you guys all right?” Lin Xiu said apologetically to Li Ping and Zhang Yin.

Just now, Lin Xiu was immersed in his training and forgot that these two people were here.

With their physique, being able to withstand seven times the gravity up to this moment was pretty impressive.

“We’re okay, but Lin Xiu… you’re a little weird today…” Zhang Yin panted and said.

“Yes, it seems like… you’re a little distracted…” Li Ping agreed at this time.

Lin Xiu was startled when he heard their comments. Indeed, he seemed to be a little dazed.

Could it be because he hasn’t seen Luo Yue since yesterday afternoon?

‘It can’t be, right?’

Lin Xiu shook his head quickly.

Could it be that he had fallen for that chick? When he thought about Luo Yue’s icy face, he had a strange feeling.

“Ding!”

Just then, the hourly chime sounded and Lin Xiu saw that it was already past ten o’clock in the morning over there.

“You guys practice first, I’ll get going.” It was almost time; he took a break, ate something and could head to the Tower of Tournament already!

This time, he must defeat that Yu Yi!

Thinking of that diamond body skill card, Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up.

The body skill card was rare and this time, not only was it a body skill card, it was also a Diamond body skill card! This was extremely rare!

Usually, diamond body skill cards were rarely seen, even the Sacred Region Academy’s exchange center didn’t have a diamond body skill card for exchange.

Lin Xiu took a short break and it was noon. He ate his lunch and rested for a while more, then headed straight to the Tower of Tournament. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“He’s here, he’s here. He is Lin Xiu, the top freshman who defeated Zhuo Qixing!”

As Lin Xiu walked over, there were already quite a few students standing around at the Tower of Tournament.

When they saw Lin Xiu, they began to whisper.

Their eyes were filled with fear when they thought about how Lin Xiu defeated Zhuo Qixing that day.

The strength that Lin Xiu displayed that day was really terrifying.

Lin Xiu stood beside the list over there, ignoring the people who were sizing him up.

He hadn’t gone to the Tower of Tournament ever since he left for the G17 Ruin. At this moment, not only was his name gone from the freshmen ranking, but Zhuo Qixing and Ouyang Hang’s names were gone too.

It was replaced by some unfamiliar names.

Lin Xiu knew that now he had to start from the first level and fight his way up!

“Hehe, he really came.” Yu Yi, who was on the 22nd floor, could clearly see the situation below through the screen over there.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s figure, his eyes couldn’t help but become gloomy.

And because he spread the news on the school forum, there was already a large number of Sacred Region Academy students waiting around the 22nd floor.

“Hahaha, the freshman wants to fight Yu Yi, I don’t believe that that kid can reach this floor this time.”

“I think he might not even make it to the 20th floor. Which freshman could reach such a high level anyway? That kid only made it because he used trickery the previous time.”

At this moment, the surrounding students have begun to whisper.

Almost all the students thought that Lin Xiu had no chance of fighting against Yu Yi on the 22nd floor.

But there were still many people who were looking forward to it. After all, the news about Lin Xiu defeating Zhuo Qixing and Ouyang Hang had spread in the academy.

Not only the entire freshmen cohort, but even the students of the Sacred Region Academy in other grades knew that Lin Xiu was the top freshman now!

Lin Xiu walked in with his Dark Edge spear at this time, handed his information card to the staff, and soon, the first battle began!

There were more and more people watching Lin Xiu’s live battle under the Tower of Tournament.

Especially because of Lin Xiu’s battle previously, the freshmen who admired Lin Xiu’s super combat ability were all rushing to watch.

“Only the first floor? I think it would take quite some time for him to reach the 22nd floor.”

“He probably wouldn’t be able to fight Yu Yi today, right?”

Just as a large number of students were discussing, Lin Xiu easily defeated the warrior on the first floor.

Then, he went directly to the second, third, fourth floors…

At this time, the students were dumbfounded.

Lin Xiu’s battle duration was so short, he defeated a warrior in almost a few seconds!

The longest he took was only about 10 seconds!

At this moment, Lin Xiu was constantly going up the tower like he was taking an airplane, so ridiculously fast!

“Damn, this speed is too fast!”

Some second-year students wanted to see the strength of the so-called top freshman, but the moment they saw this, they were shocked.

“Haha, I knew that Lin Xiu’s strength is amazing!” Li Ping, Zhang Yin and Jiang Li all saw the news from the school forum that the No. 1 freshman and Yu Yi were fighting on the 22nd floor of the Tower of Tournament.

They went over at this time and stood in front of the big screen on the first floor of the Tower of Tournament, watching Lin Xiu’s battle excitedly.

After returning from the G17 Ruin, Lin Xiu’s strength has obviously changed the most. At this moment, he was about to enter the 22nd floor without any difficulty!

“This floor is our second-year student Zhang Yizhi, a rank 5 warrior, this kid probably can’t defeat him!” Some second-year students watched in shock as Lin Xiu continued to win and reached the 20th floor very quickly.

Almost all the students above the 15th floor were second-year students. Lin Xiu defeated several second-year students which immediately made them very upset.

“Hehe, freshman? You seem quite arrogant, but this is the furthest you will go!” Zhang Yizhi held a huge hammer and smiled at Lin Xiu.
