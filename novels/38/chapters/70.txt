Chapter 71: Two Against One!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Hey, it’s a trio battle?” Lin Xiu looked over and didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry; he was simply too ‘lucky’.

“Jiang Tao and Zhu Jun? The ones that are ranked 10th and 12th on the list?” Yang Tian was surprised.

“This is probably going to be a little troublesome…”

“Just a trio battle. They wouldn’t kick me out first, right?” Lin Xiu knitted his brows and said.

Yang Tian glanced at Lin Xiu, then smiled bitterly. “That is possible.”

“I heard those two are quite close and this trio battle might turn into a two versus one first.”

One against two? If they were not as strong as Ye Gulin, Lin Xiu should be able to deal with them.

He might not be very familiar with the new skill he just learned, but its power should be enough and he could use it as a finishing blow.

While there was still time, Lin Xiu began brandishing his spear on the field not far away.

With the increase in strength, the Silver Immortal Soul spear felt a little lighter to him.

“You’re Lin Xiu?”

After some time, a figure walked over and looked at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu looked to the side and saw a tall and strong man, staring straight at him.

What Lin Xiu noticed was the spear in his hands, and under the sun, it had a dazzling cold light to it.

“My name is Ma Long and I hope you get to the next round. Then, I’ll show you who is the real king of spears!” The man said arrogantly.

“I’ll win and if you’re up against me, I’ll show you what spear art is.” Lin Xiu raised his brows and spoke without showing any weakness.

“How arrogant!” Ma Long snorted coldly, then turned away.

He had been practicing with spears since he was little and was certain that he would not lose to Lin Xiu.

Time passed quickly. After having lunch and resting for more than an hour, the match finally began!

Like before, the stage where Lin Xiu was at still had the largest audience.

“Oh, the one who had to eat the stage, why are you back here again?” Yang Tian saw that same student again.

“Hng, Ye Gulin was careless previously.” The student’s face changed, he then scoffed coldly and continued looking at the stage. He then said, “I’m very sure that he will lose this time.”

“What if he wins? You wouldn’t go back on your word again, would you?” Yang Tian was mad and shouted.

“I’ll run around naked if he wins again!” That student retorted angrily.

At this moment, the match began and Lin Xiu was on stage with the Silver Immortal Soul spear.

As Lin Xiu went on stage, there was a loud cheer suddenly.

“Hehe, how proud ah.” Jiang Tao was a man who looked a little thin and wasn’t tall.

But you’re wrong if you looked down on him.

He wore a steel claw in his hand, and it was clear that it was his weapon.

The other guy, Zhu Jun, was slightly fat and his weapon was a rod.

At this moment, they were both looking at Lin Xiu, and it was obvious that they were going to defeat Lin Xiu first, just like what Yang Tian guessed.

“The match... begins!”

As the referee yelled, the two guys looked at one another and charged at Lin Xiu!

Swish swish swish——

The short and thin Jiang Tao was very fast and he managed to reach Lin Xiu in a split second as he waved the claws on his right hand toward Lin Xiu.

“‘Nine Claws Killing’!!!”

Jiang Tao did not hesitate and used his skill directly. His claws were instantly filled with a trace of black, and every time he waved it, Lin Xiu felt his spear shaking.

And the black gas from the claws made Lin Xiu feel a tingling sensation.

While Jiang Tao was attacking frantically, Zhu Jun waved the long rod in the air and knocked it down!

“Despicable, making two attacks at once!” Yang Tian was shocked at this scene.

They were both ranked 10th and 12th in the combat strength list, but when they both attacked together, it was more challenging than dealing with Ye Gulin alone.

“What do you mean by despicable? This is a strategy!” That student next to him became proud at this moment.

“He’s right, for a trio battle, they must eliminate one of them before they can keep fighting,” Luo Li said in a low voice.

Lin Xiu had, unfortunately, become the target of those two people.

In the seat, Mr. Ye was still paying attention to Lin Xiu. Within a short span of time, Lin Xiu seemed to have become stronger again which surprised him.

And according to the information he got, Lin Xiu used to be at the bottom, what exactly happened during this period of time that changed a person’s strength so drastically?

It made him very curious.

Swish swish swish——

At this moment, while Lin Xiu dodged the attacks of these two people, he shook his arm hard and the silver spear slashed across the air, releasing a few flaming birds in an instant.

Every match was recorded, and the two men obviously saw Lin Xiu’s previous match so when they saw the phoenixes circling the spear, they immediately dodged. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“It’s no use, we’ve studied your tricks before, you’re going to lose for sure!” Jiang Tao was thin and shockingly fast. He escaped those phoenixes, then smiled at Lin Xiu.

“And your ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ may be fast, but we have come up with a way to suppress your skill.” Zhu Jun sneered.

The two people stood side by side and as the phoenixes were gone, they charged at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu furrowed his brows. That attack just now had wounded his arm and neck area slightly.

“I’ll show you my strongest skill—— ‘Splitting Sky’!!!” Jiang Tao yelled and extended his right hand as he charged toward Lin Xiu. A huge amount of white gas appeared on top of his hand and the surrounding air seemed to have been ripped apart.

“‘Windstorm’!!!” Zhu Jun held the long rod in his hands and waved it. A loud rumbling resounded and those people around them could feel as though there was a wild wind.

“Oh no, both of them are using their strongest skill…” Yang Tian covered his eyes with his hand at this moment. The wild wind blew up some dust, and he couldn’t even open his eyes properly.
