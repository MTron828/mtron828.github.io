Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

“You…” Jiang Feng wanted to say something, but Lin Xiu’s fierce offensive continued to attack.

Bang bang bang-

At this time, Lin Xiu frantically waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand, and the spear stabbed directly into his ‘Sphere’, making a loud noise.

‘The powerful impact made Jiang Feng keep retreating.

And in the next moment, he discovered that the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand had turned dark red.

Moreover, Jiang Feng could clearly feel that the power of Lin Xiu’s weapon seemed to be even more terrifying.

Asense of danger made Jiang Feng’s eyes widen, and he turned to run away.

“Where are you going!”

Just when Jiang Feng turned around and ran to the back, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared in front of him!

Boom–

Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear slashed and his ‘Sphere’ was cut directly!

The look in Jiang Feng’s eyes changed greatly, because his ‘Sphere’ was broken, and a mouthful of blood spat out from his mouth.

Die!

“Stop!”

But at this moment, a voice shook Lin Xiu’s heart.

Originally, he was going to kill Jiang Feng with his Dark Edge spear, but he didn’t expect that at this moment, a terrifying sound rang out, making Lin Xiu’s chest tight and feeling a little uncomfortable.

His eyes suddenly looked to the back, and he could clearly see an old man staring at Lin Xiu on the seat in the back.

Another rank 9 warrior!

Moreover, this rank 9 warrior seemed to have a very strange skill, and even from such a distance, he said something that only Lin Xiu could hear.

‘The most terrifying thing was that this voice also had an impact on him.

When Jiang Feng saw this scene, he heaved a sigh of relief and leaped a few times before reaching the other side.

Dang dang-

At this time, Baili Haoling and Nan Huang were fighting together. At this time, Baili Haoling seemed to let go of the bondage, and the terror of the whole person became even more terrifying.

This Nan Huang seemed to be struggling to fight against Baili Haoling.

“Do we have a grudge?”

Jiang Feng looked at Lin Xiu, then wiped the blood from his lips and said to Lin Xiu.

He could feel the murderous aura in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

‘That kind of murderous aura was very strong, and it looked like he wasn’t going to give up.

“Fifteen years ago, in Xingyao City, do you know what you did?”

Lin Xiu looked at him coldly, and said aloud.

“Xingyao City?”

“I did kill some people, but do you know anyone there?”

“That’s really too bad then.”

Jiang Feng said lightly at this time.

“Today, I will use your head as a sacrifice to my parents!”

When Lin Xiu heard Jiang Feng’s words without any sense of guilt, he became even crazier.

As soon as the body moved, the movement of ‘Without a Trace’ became active, and the body exploded with extremely terrifying speed, rushing straight ahead!

Swoosh—

Lin Xiu, whose body was in motion, was like a phantom, making Jiang Feng unable to catch Lin Xiu’s trace.

Damn it!

Jiang Feng clenched his weapon tightly with both hands at this time, and now he can’t unfold the ‘Sphere’ again, this situation is very dangerous!

Seeing that the shadow of Lin Xiu appeared in front of him, the expression in his eyes changed greatly, and then he held the weapon in his hand and blocked.

Dang–

Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear collided with his long sword, and suddenly made a crisp sound.

Jiang Feng suddenly felt his arm go numb, and he couldn’t even hold the long sword.

“Come down quickly!”

And at this time, Jiang Feng also heard the voice of the old man outside the arena.

He was the guardian of the Jiang family. Seeing that Jiang Feng was in danger of death, he had to remind him.

With so many masters on the podium now, he had no way to do anything to Lin Xiu. Even just now, he was afraid of being noticed.

Jiang Feng was screaming miserably at this time, and he wanted to escape, but Lin Xiu appeared in front of him every time and directly blocked his way.

And at this moment, the force of Lin Xiu’s weapon became stronger and stronger. In the next moment, the weapon in Jiang Feng’s hand flew straight out!

“Tadmit…”

When Jiang Feng was about to say something, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand just slashed his arm, cutting off his arm!

“What!!!”

Jiang Feng wailed, and blood spurted out instantly.

“How dare you!!!”

‘The guardian of the Jiang family couldn’t sit still anymore. If he didn’t stop him, Lin Xiu will kill Jiang Feng!

As soon as he moved and was about to enter the competition stage, some powerful warriors appeared in front of him.

“Please sit back down.”

These people were all wearing black uniforms, because the strong people in Zhuo Qixing’s family interfered with the game before, and now they have sent more law enforcement officers to guard the area. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

When the old man looked at these people, his expression changed slightly.

At this time, if he pushed hard, he would be going against the Warrior Union!

Moreover, the strength of these people in front of him was terrifying, and he didn’t dare to go up.

He looked at Lin Xiu on the platform and his eyes were full of strong killing intent.

At this time, Jiang Feng had his arm chopped off by Lin Xiu, and when he wanted to jump directly off the platform, Lin Xiu directly waved the Dark Edge spear in his right hand.

Boom—

One after another, the flaming birds rushed towards Jiang Feng, who wanted to escape!

Jiang Feng’s face was pale at this time, his arm was cut off and there was a strong sense of pain.

But now he has no time to think so much, and was running frantically to avoid those flaming birds.

He watched as he got closer and closer to the edge of the platform, with a look of surprise on his face.

Just when he was about to jump off the stage, a white figure appeared in front of him!

“You…”

Jiang Feng’s eyes widened, and when he wanted to say something, he saw a flash of cold light.

Boom–

Before Jiang Feng could move, the head of the Dark Edge spear had already penetrated his head.

Blood flowed down his forehead.

“You…”

Jiang Feng moved his lips and wanted to say something, but he couldn’t say anything anymore.

“Evil will be rewarded with evil.”

Lin Xiu said in a cold voice at this time, and pulled out the Dark Edge spear directly from his head.

Boom–

At this moment, Jiang Feng’s body fell directly to the ground.

“Jiang Feng!”

‘The guardian of the Jiang family wailed at this moment, and then looked at Lin Xiu again, his eyes were full of killing intent.

Lin Xiu gave him a cold look, and at this time, his eyes turned to the front..
