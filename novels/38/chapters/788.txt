Chapter 789: Cangqiong City

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, the look on his face turned even more awful.

“What do you want?”

He was quiet for a moment but Yan Yongxin spoke to Lin Xiu.

“Once you stay ten metres away from it, the power will instantly be demolished.”

Lin Xiu said flatly.

Yan Yongxin was too strong and he hasn’t even used the energy from his source mark.

If they continued fighting, it would be bad for him instead.

Plus, the effect for ‘Rage’ wouldn’t last any longer. It would disappear soon.

“Nonsense.”

When Yan Yongxin heard what Lin Xiu said, he laughed.

“How would I know that you would play games with me while I walk out?”

“Then, we would consider the deal to be broken, am I right?”

Lin Xiu replied with a calm voice as he reached out his right hand and grabbed onto something in the air.

“Uncle Yan! Save me!!! Please!!”

Sun Zi looked at the cube that was right above his head as it was getting bigger. He was suddenly reminded of the man next to him that was blasted into ash. His body trembled uncontrollably.

Yan Yongxin turned around in shock when he noticed what was happening and he had a stern look on his face.

This brat….such a cruel one!

“Let’s go!!!”

Yan Yongxin shouted.

“Ten seconds. If you don’t leave in ten seconds, I will get rid of him.”

Then, Lin Xiu warned them once again.

“Let’s go!”

Yan Yongxin shouted once again and left with Sun Zi and the rest behind him.

As Sun Zi was walking out of the spot, the cube was still right above his head.

It hasn’t disappeared as mentioned.

“Hu...”

When they left, Lin Xiu suddenly felt weak and fell onto the ground.

The effect from ‘Rage’ soon disappeared and the aftermath hit him immediately.

“Brother Lin!”

“Master!”

Liu Pan and the rest ran towards him as well.

“I’m alright. I just need to take a break.”

Lin Xiu reassured them but he was looking extremely pale.

“That man just now was a king warrior...”

Liu Pan was looking indignant as well.

Who would have thought that there would be a king warrior here?

When he thought of the terrifying lightning that was released from that man’s body, Liu Pan couldn’t help but shiver.

“But….will they really leave?”

“Of course. Yan Yongxin is the protector of Sun Zi. If Sun Zi said anything, those from the Sun family will come after him.”

An Qi nodded her head as she explained to the group.

But, as soon as she finished her sentence, they could hear footsteps headed towards them.

When they heard the sounds, all of them were surprised.

Could it be that they’re back?!

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank out of shock.

He was at his weakest now as he had no strength at all!

“An Qi!!!”

All of them were tense with what was about to happen when a loud scream called for An Qi.

When they heard the voice, a smile appeared on An Qi’s face.

“Brother! I’m here!”

An Qi’s brother?

Lin Xiu was stunned but suddenly he was overwhelmed with a strong sense of fatigue. Everything in front of his eyes turned back and he fell asleep.

While he was fighting the king warrior just now, there were a few of the lightning that had unique features and it has caused a number on Lin Xiu as well.

Especially when there were additional aftermath from ‘Rage’, Lin Xiu’s body was at its weakest stage and was even more affected by those lightnings.

After some time, Lin Xiu finally opened his eyes.

He realised that he was lying on a bed.

Hmm?

Lin Xiu frowned as he tried to jog his memories from yesterday.

The strength of the king warrior’s lightning was on another level and there was lightning poison incorporated into it. As the aftermath effect of ‘Rage’ finally hit him, the poison was finally going into his body which caused him to pass out.

He was looking around and noticed that it wasn’t a huge room but it was filled with all sorts of peculiar looking high tech equipment.

Where was this?

He was carefully looking around and finally let out a breath of relief when he saw his Dark Edge spear placed right next to his bed.

Yikkkk – –

Right at that time, the door was pushed open.

A man who was slightly plumper walked through the door.

“Brother Lin, you are awake?!”

He took a good look at the man and saw that it was Liu Pan.

Lin Xiu looked a little surprised. He nodded his head and said, “Where are we?”

“This is An Qi’s home.”

Liu Pan told Lin Xiu.

After hearing the answer from Liu Pan, Lin Xiu finally remembered that An Qi had sent off a signal in the forest which was why her family was coming to save her.

Since he had passed out after that, they were brought back to the An household.

“So…you’re saying that we’re in Cangqiong City?”

Lin Xiu seemed to be reminded of something as he asked Liu Pan.

He walked towards the window and after pulling the curtains open, he could clearly see the huge skyrise buildings in the distance.

The designs of the buildings here were odd and they looked very futuristic.

As for his room, it was located on a high floor which was why he could see all of the views below him.

After leaving the room, he went to the courtyard that was below his room. That’s when he saw An Qi swinging around the spear, practising her skills with the spear.

As Lin Xiu and Liu Pan walked towards her, An Qi noticed that someone was behind her and she quickly turned around.

“Master?!”

Seeing that it was Lin Xiu, she looked surprised.

“You’re already training so early in the morning?”

Lin Xiu smiled as he asked.

“Yeap. Are you feeling better now?”

An Qi nodded her head as she answered him.

“I’m fine too.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

“So…this is Cangqiong City?”

“It is.”

“Eh? Master, you’re awake?”

Just at that time, Qian Ling walked into the room as well. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Hey….you’re being too much. None of you asked if I was alright.”

Liu Pan pursed his lips.

An Qi stuck out her tongue at Liu Pan and it made him even more speechless.

“Those men….did they come after us?”

Lin Xiu thought of something and quickly asked the rest of them.

Sun Zi was from the Sun family and they were from Cangqiong City as well.

“Hmph! I don’t think that he has the guts to!”

An Qi scoffed.

“In Cangqiong City, the big four families restrict each other. Although the Sun family is one of the strongest, they wouldn’t dare to challenge us directly.”

Qian Ling explained the situation.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes. They might not be coming to him, he could still go to them himself.

As he thought of what happened yesterday, Lin Xiu subconsciously gave out a murderous aura.

If he didn’t have enough strength yesterday, not only would he lose the king grade odd crystal, he would have lost his life as well!

Right! When he passed out, his body seemed to have absorbed all of the king grade odd crystal!
