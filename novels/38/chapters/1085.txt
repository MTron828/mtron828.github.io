Chapter 1086: Feigning Death!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s whole body’s source strength quickly gathered.

This Frost Dragon will be killed by him.

Only in this way could he gain that experience.

The long spear in his hand, at this moment, suddenly transformed into a large amount of black matter due to the gathering of source strength.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu charged directly toward the Frost Dragon!

‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!!!

The moment the spear pierced the already swaying Frost Dragon, the black energy instantly transformed into a huge black dragon!

Following Lin Xiu’s attack, he charged toward the Frost Dragon.

Boom—

As the transformed black dragon slammed into Frost Dragon’s body, a loud noise suddenly erupted.

The black dragon bit down on Frost Dragon’s body, causing Frost Dragon to smash directly to the ice ground below!

Its huge body hit the ground heavily with Lin Xiu’s skill.

The entire ground seemed to vibrate at this moment.

Its huge body fell to the ground, motionless at this time.

It was as if it had already died,

There were also many wounds on its body and some purple blood flowed out.

“Dead!”

The surrounding sage warriors saw this scene and their expressions changed slightly at the same time.

They looked at each other and at the next moment, they rushed towards the frost dragon lying on the ground below at the same time.

The odd crystal of the Frost Dragon and the horn of the Frost Dragon!

Both of these items need to be taken. Only after they were taken can they go back and exchange for that holy-level skill card.

“Get lost!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Some of the Sage warriors who rushed to the bottom the fastest directly released their retained power and attacked the surrounding Sage warriors.

When they dealt with this Frost Dragon just now, they all held back.

Because they all know that the Frost Dragon has only one odd crystal and horn.

Whoever can grab it will be able to obtain a holy-level skill card.

At this moment, these Sage warriors instantly fought.

Lin Xiu, who was in the air, looked a the Frost Dragon that he hit and revealed a sneer at the corner of his mouth.

He knew that these Sage warriors must have reserved their energy in order to fight for the Frost Dragon’s Odd Crystal at the end.

And now, this Frost Dragon was not dead yet.

Roar–

Just when they were fighting to compete for the Frost Dragon Odd Crystal, the Frost Dragon that appeared dead at first let out a huge roar.

Its huge tail swept out directly and it directly knocked several Sage warriors out!

bang bang bang-

The bodies of those Sage warriors that flew out slammed into the ice ground behind them.

The incomparably terrifying impact directly caused them to spit out a lot of blood.

It felt as if the internal organs were about to be shattered.

And at this time, the suddenly ‘alive’ Frost Dragon opened its mouth wide and exhaled a lot of frost energy.

Several of the closest Sage warriors were caught off guard and were directly hit by the frost energy.

Their bodies instantly turned into ice sculptures!

When the Sage warriors saw this scene, they were all terrified.

They thought Frost Dragon was dead, so they wanted to take the Frost Dragon’s Odd crystal.

Who could have imagined that this Frost Dragon was actually feigning death!

“Leave!”

Just now, Elder Gong had already suspected that the frost dragon would not have died so easily.

Seeing this scene at this time, his face changed greatly.

Now it seems that their attack on the Frost Dragon only injured the Frost Dragon, but it did not cause too much damage to it.

And there were only about ten Sage warriors alive now.

If they continued fighting, it is very possible that everyone will die here!

After weighing it a little, Elder Gong decided to give up the mission this time.

Although this holy-level skill card is the dream of many warriors, the most important thing is that you have to go back alive.

The moment Elder Gong’s words fell, he flew away.

The rest of the Sage warriors were starting to evacuate quickly.

Frost Dragon ignored these Sage warriors at this time. It waved its claws and smacked the Sage warriors who were frozen into ice sculptures!

Pa pa pa-

With a crisp sound, these turned into ice sculptures and all shattered.

And the bodies of these Sage warriors also shattered into many pieces along with the ice sculptures.

Several powerful Sage warriors just died.

“Very good, they’re all gone.”

Looking at Lin Xiu, who was suspended in the air after the Sage warriors had left, a smile appeared instead.

Those Sage warriors just now have already caused this Frost Dragon to suffer a lot of damage.

Now, the power of the Frost Dragon is obviously not as strong as before.

Next, it’s up to him to get rid of it.

Capture its odd crystal!

Thinking of this, the strength of Lin Xiu’s whole body burst out.

With the explosion of Lin Xiu’s power, Lin Xiu’s body also seemed to be wrapped in flames.

‘Heavenly Array’, ‘Fury’!

And at this time, Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate at all and directly activated these two system skills that could strengthen his body.

As soon as the system skills were activated, Lin Xiu’s entire body felt an extremely strong force coming together.

The whole body was instantly filled with power.

The Frost Dragon on the ground seemed to see Lin Xiu in the air.

There was even more light in a pair of purple eyes.

It opened his mouth wide and exhaled frosty air.

It seemed that he wants to freeze Lin Xiu’s body into an ice sculpture!

“Humph!”

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he sneered suddenly. He didn’t dodge the incoming frost energy at all. He held the weapon in his hand and rushed straight down!

Because of the flames on Lin Xiu’s body, the frost energy was immediately melted away by the power of the flames as soon as they hit Lin Xiu’s body.

And because he has the Heart of Frost, Lin Xiu is not afraid of the energy of this ice attribute.

“Go to… hell!”

At this time, Lin Xiu rushed through the frost energy in an instant and his body instantly reached the front of the Frost Dragon.

Holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he attacked its head!

At this time, because of the blessing of the system skills, Lin Xiu burst out extremely fast.

Holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he stabbed one of the Frost Dragon’s eyes emitting a faint purple light!

boom–

With a crisp sound, its purple eyes were directly stabbed by Lin Xiu’s sharp Dark Edge spear!

A large amount of purple liquid flowed out from its pierced eye.

Roar–

Because of the severe pain, the frost dragon let out a huge roar.

The two claws frantically grabbed Lin Xiu’s body, as if they wanted to crush Lin Xiu’s body directly!

swoosh—

Lin Xiu directly activated the ‘Flashing Souls’ body skill and his body instantly disappeared in place, appearing behind the Frost Dragon!

“go!!!”

The Dark Edge spear in his hand, at this moment, continues to swing in the air!
