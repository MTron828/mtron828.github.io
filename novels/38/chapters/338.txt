Chapter 339: Profound Intent: Awe of the Phoenix

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Although they wanted the ice lotus fire, they wanted to keep their lives too.

“Luo Rui.”

Luo Yue glanced at them then continued to speak.

Hearing these two words, the faces of those warriors who were still hesitant to leave, became uglier. This time, they left without looking back.

At this moment, the warriors left one by one and there was only the warrior who wanted to attack Luo Yue and two warriors that remained.

Lin Xiu was shocked when he saw this scene. Why did the attitude of these warriors suddenly change?

This made Lin Xiu a little puzzled.

“What did you say to them?” Lin Xiu asked.

Why did these warriors leave all of a sudden because of what Luo Yue’s said? This doesn’t make sense...

“I just said the name of a person.” Luo Yue said calmly.

A person’s name?

Whose name is so powerful? Lin Xiu couldn’t figure it out.

“You guys are not leaving?” The middle-aged man who just got attacked by Lin Xiu and flew back a certain distance wasn’t injured and he went forward, then said to the two men who remained.

“We obviously want the energy of the ice lotus fire.” One of the men who looked pale, licked his lips and said aloud.

His eyes were full of greed and it seemed that he was determined to get the ice lotus fire.

“Aren’t you guys afraid?” The middle-aged man burst out laughing when he heard his words.

“Afraid?” The pale-faced man laughed at this moment then pointed to Luo Yue with his long sword, “She said she belongs to the Luo family and I’m just going to believe her?”

“Anyway, so what? Who would know if she died here?” Another man standing beside the pale-faced man said aloud at this time.

Compared to the pale-faced man’s face, this man’s face was as dark as charcoal.

“Hahaha, you guys are truly the Black and White Demons – so brave!” Hearing these two people’s words, this young man burst into laughter.

“Then let’s kill these two people together.” As he spoke, his eyes filled with murderous intent and he glanced at Luo Yue and Lin Xiu.

Then, he exploded with power and rushed directly to Lin Xiu!

He must first get rid of Lin Xiu first – the guy who’s in the way!

Lin Xiu saw him rushing towards him. At this moment, his face changed. He swung the Dark Edge spear and it collided with the man’s saber.

Dang–

With a dull sound, Lin Xiu felt a powerful impact, which was transmitted from his Dark Edge spear to his body.

Lin Xiu’s body instantly flew out like a broken kite.

However, Lin Xiu seemed to have expected it a long time ago. At this moment, the body that flew out flipped in the air then steadily landed on the ground.

“Go to hell!!!”

He looked ahead and saw that middle-aged man holding the saber in his hand as he roared and slashed at him from a distance!

With a slash of the saber in his hand, a huge sword aura appeared and charged towards Lin Xiu.

Boom——

A deep crack appeared on the ground due to the sword aura.

Bang–

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s body was instantly cut in half by the sword aura.

“Hng, boy, let’s see how savage you can be!” The middle-aged man suddenly laughed when he saw this scene.

He thought that the sword aura he released had already killed Lin Xiu, but what he didn’t expect was that at this moment, he felt a violent burning sensation coming from behind him.

What happened!?

Feeling the burning sensation, the face of the middle-aged man changed, then he turned around abruptly and saw a bright red light shining over.

He looked up and saw that Lin Xiu had already jumped into the air, then as he waved the Dark Edge spear constantly, flaming birds appeared one after another, directly charging towards the middle-aged man!

How is this possible!!!

At this moment, he roared in his heart and was in disbelief because he had just seen with his own eyes that Lin Xiu had been cut in half by his sword aura!

Why, why did he appear behind him again!?

And now the skill released by Lin Xiu clearly made him feel a sense of oppression.

“‘Profound Intent·Awe of the Phoenix’!!!

Just now Lin Xiu used ‘Mirror Image’ and it was obvious that Lin Xiu avoided his attack.

And after the battle with Zhang Jie yesterday, Lin Xiu felt that he had a deeper understanding of ‘Awe of the phoenix’ and now used ‘Profound Intent’ instead of the ordinary ‘Awe of the phoenix’!

In other words, the power released by ‘Awe of the phoenix’ was much stronger than before!

At this moment, as Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear continued to swing, a series of flaming birds charged towards the bottom!

There were at least dozens of flaming birds. At this moment, as the flaming birds charged over, the surrounding ground turned red in an instant.

Moreover, the temperature of the surrounding air has risen by several degrees in a short time.

The burning sensation caused droplets of sweat to flow down the cheeks of the middle-aged man below.

And when the flaming birds rushed over, they slowly began to converge to form a huge flaming phoenix!!!

The flaming phoenix seemed to cover the sky and rushed towards the middle-aged man below!

“Unfold!!!” The middle-aged man was shocked when he saw this scene. This flaming phoenix covered a large surface and even if he was a rank 7 warrior, there was no chance of dodging it!

He could only use ‘Sphere’ to block. If he directly blocked it with his own body, he would probably be cooked by the flame!

Following his roar, a light blue barrier appeared around his body instantly!

He was a rank 7 warrior, after all, and the power of the unfolded sphere was very powerful, enveloping his body completely!

“Go!!!”

Lin Xiu let out a loud roar and the flaming phoenix attacked!!!Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m
