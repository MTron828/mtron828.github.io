Chapter 791: Mastering Points!

“I guess you’re good. Hmph!”

An Ruo sneered.

He also took back the ‘Yuan’ that he had released.

“An Ruo! What do you think you’re doing?”

At the same time, An Qi had returned and when she saw An Ruo, she frowned in disagreement with what happened.

“Hmm....nothing. I was just trying it out with your master.”

Seeing how his sister was joining them, An Ruo chuckled and brushed it off.

“Really?”

An Qi stared at him with a sly look in her eyes as she asked.

“Of course. Hahahaha...there are some things that I have to deal with first. I’ll be leaving now.”

An Ruo chuckled a little and left the place.

“Master....did he do anything?”

An Qi immediately asked Lin Xiu when she got back to the group.

“Nothing.”

Lin Xiu gave a reassuring smile.

“This is an empty warrior skills card.”

“Oh. That’s enough.”

As he looked at the stack of empty warrior skills cards that An Qi brought, he nodded his head.

“Brother Lin, are you going to print the warriors skills card here?”

Liu Pan asked out of surprise.

In order to print their own warrior skills onto a card, it would not only need to be in a strong mental state and the skill that they wanted to print has to be fully matured.

Lin Xiu directly sat on the ground at the grass patch and held onto an empty warrior skills card in his hand.

As he closed his eyes and with his thoughts, he immediately poured all of the information of his warrior skills into the empty warrior skills card.

Soon, there was a bright light that started glowing from the empty card.

Liu Pan held onto his breath as well when he saw it happening.

This was because this was their first time seeing another person imprinting such terrifying warrior skills onto an empty card.

With the large amount of source energy and information being poured into the card, the entire warrior skills card was giving out a bright glow.

“Done.”

When Lin Xiu opened his eyes, he could see that the ‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers’ were already printed on it.

This was a low rank warrior skills card when he got it. After being polished by Lin Xiu multiple times, it has now become a diamond warrior skills card.

“It’s done now?”

Liu Pan widened his eyes in shock and this was the first time that he has seen warrior skills being written onto a card.

“Should be.”

This was Lin Xiu’s first time doing this as well and he was curious too.

“Let’s try?”

Lin Xiu passed the card to An Qi.

“Alright.”

An Qi nodded her head and placed the warrior skills card over his forehead.

Then, with her own source energy, she allowed the information from the warriors skills card into his mind.

Soon, there was a large amount of information from the warrior skills card that entered into An Qi’s brain.

The warrior skills card was filled with Lin Xiu’s understanding and noted about the skill.

An Qi frowned and she looked as if she was having a headache from the large amount of information entering into her brain.

After some time, she slowly opened her eyes.

“How do you feel?” Qian Ling looked at An Qi who finally opened her eyes.

“Hehe... you should try it first.”

An Qi giggled and immediately grabbed onto her spear when she stood up.

As she spun her spear around, there were hundreds of spears that appeared in the air.

“Hmmm...not bad.”

When Lin Xiu saw what happened, he laughed lightly and said to An Qi.

As a rank 9 warrior, it was definitely more than her abilities to be able to release hundreds of spears after using it for the first time.

“Master! I want one as well!”

Qian Ling said to Lin Xiu as well.

“Alright.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head. He continued doing the same time as what he did earlier and printed his warrior skills onto the empty card.

Soon, another warrior skills card was completed.

“I heard that it is exhausting to create one but Brother Lin, why doesn’t it look like it has bothered you?”

Liu Pan was curious.

It’s not to say that creating a warrior skills card would take up a lot of energy but it is true that even for those who were powerful, they would be exhausted after making 2 warriors skills cards. However, it didn’t look like Lin Xiu was tired.

After hearing what Liu Pan said, Lin Xiu was stunned as well.

He was feeling weird as well but it was indeed that he didn’t feel tired at all.

Perhaps this was because he was stronger now with the new strength?

“Ding!”

“Congratulations master for completing the teaching. You have gotten ten points for mastering!”

Just when Lin Xiu was still feeling curious, there was a notification that came from his system.

“Brother Lin?”

Liu Pan looked at Lin Xiu who was stunned and he was waving his hand in front of Lin Xiu.

“Keep quiet.”

Lin Xiu pushed his hand away and closed his eyes.

As he entered the system, he could clearly see that in the apprenticeship system, there were 10 mastering points.

Next to it, there was another icon that showed ‘Shop’.

‘Shop’? What was that? Is it the place where he could buy things?

Lin Xiu was surprised but he didn’t think too much about it and immediately clicked onto it.

After choosing it, Lin Xiu entered into another interface.

There were purple crystal warrior skills cards, weapons as well as potential pills.

After seeing what was inside, Lin Xiu was shocked as well.

So, he was able to redeem all these with the mastering points?!

But after looking at it, the purple crystal rank warrior skills card would need ten thousand mastering points and for the weapons, it requires at least 20 thousand.

The cheapest potential pill would also require a hundred points.

Damn!

After seeing this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but curse at himself.

“Brother Lin, what’s happening?”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was looking a little resentful, Liu Pan asked out of curiosity.

“It’s nothing.”

Lin Xiu brushed it off casually.

This stupid system. There were so many good things inside the shop but it didn’t allow him to exchange for any.

He turned towards Qian Ling and An Qi and saw how they were using their spears. They seemed to be learning the skill pretty quickly.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations on gaining another point!”

“Ding!”

As they continued training with the ‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flower’, Lin Xiu felt as if there were multiple notifications coming from his system. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu, who was in resentment earlier, showed a surprised look on his face.

So, as they continue training and their skills mature, he would be able to get more mastering points?

If that’s the case, it wasn’t that bad after all.

“Hmm....this skill is incredible.”

An Qi and Qian Ling stopped what they were doing and told Lin Xiu.

“But I feel that the Master would be able to release a lot more spears than us.”

An Qi was a little disappointed as she said to Qian Ling.

When Lin Xiu used this skill, he would be able to release multiple spears at the same time and the power of it was much above theirs.

“You’ve been doing great since you just started. Just continue training.”

Lin Xiu laughed.

Both of them nodded their heads and continued with their training.

As for Lin Xiu, he looked into the distance and narrowed his eyes as he seemed to have thought of something.
