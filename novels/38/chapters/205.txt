Chapter 206: Encircle the Ice Crystal White Bird!

Because of this Ice crystal white bird, the temperature of the entire G17 Ruin seemed to have dropped a lot.

Lin Xiu felt a little bit cold at this time.

Luo Yue continued to walk forward and by climbing the surrounding buildings on the ground, they avoided facing most of the zombies and evolved beasts directly on the street.

At this time, the more they walked toward the center, the more they could sense the air getting colder and colder, and there were fewer and fewer evolved beasts.

Looking over, they could see that the huge body of the Ice crystal white bird was still in the air.

As it continued to spray those white mist-like things from its mouth, the surrounding buildings, and even the ground, instantly froze.

“Tsk, seems like quite a lot of people came here this time.” Zhuo Qixing was standing on the roof of a certain building, looking from a distance, and muttered to himself.

“Young Master Zhuo, are we really going to continue to wait for those people to attack the Ice crystal white bird?” Luo Xiaoqi who was next to him asked.

No matter how conceited he was about his strength, he was facing the Ice crystal white bird after all, a rank 8 evolved beast at its peak.

It wasn’t a cat or a dog ah!

And at this time, there were a lot of high-ranking warriors rushing over. Fighting with these people was simply stupid.

“Just wait, there will be an opportunity.” Zhuo Qixing said lightly.

At the same time, the people from the North Campus were also waiting for this opportunity from a distance. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

After all, the Odd crystals of a rank 8 evolved beast could be said to be priceless. The energy stored in this Odd crystal was also very terrifying. As long as one absorbs the energy inside, it can greatly increase one’s strength.

So these people were all coming for this Odd crystal.

“Wait here.” Luo Yue and Lin Xiu arrived in a building not far away. They stood by the window and looked at the scene in the distance.

“Can these people deal with it?” Lin Xiu was also looking over and could see the figure of the Ice crystal white bird, but the figures of the other warriors were hidden.

But Lin Xiu was sure that those warriors must be hiding.

Time passed by minute by minute and soon, the sky was completely dark.

The Ice crystal white bird was enraged all day, destroying many buildings but seemed to settle down at this moment.

“It’s going to rest, get ready the laser cannon!!!”

Some warriors nearby had already loaded those buildings with various heavy weapons. The moment they spoke, the area on the other side was completely dark, but they suddenly saw one huge light ray pierce through the darkness!!!

Boom——

There was a loud sound and a laser beam as thick as a few people hugging together, shot directly from a distance, and hit the Ice crystal white bird!

“K17 military laser cannon?!” Lin Xiu, who had been waiting there, was shocked at this time.

This kind of laser cannon was for military use and it was very powerful. The laser shot could destroy a small town in an instant.

He didn’t expect that someone would move this thing here!

Being attacked by the laser cannon, the Ice crystal white bird’s huge body shook in the air.

But the laser cannon did not penetrate its body.

What a tough skin!

At this time, the Ice crystal white bird was tottering and wailing.

“That’s it?” Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and stared at the scene in shock.

Although the laser cannon did not penetrate the body of the Ice crystal white bird, it seemed to be severely injured and its body could not continue flying in the air.

A rank 8 evolved beast should have terrifyingly tough skin ah…

“No, it’s still early.” Luo Yue shook her head, staring straight at the scene as she spoke.

“Kill him!!!” At this time, some warriors had rushed out.

A rank 8 peak evolved beast! It was bombarded by the laser just once and was obvious that it was seriously injured.

As long as they ran over now, they could kill the Ice crystal white bird first, and snatch the Odd crystal!

The rank 8 Odd crystal was a treasure with no market price!

But at this moment, the Ice crystal white bird, who looked faltering and weak, suddenly became ferocious.

When the warriors rushed over there, the Ice crystal white bird that was crumbling suddenly flapped its wings and rushed towards them!

Its huge wings swooped violently, causing an icy cold wind.

Those warriors felt a chill and found that their skin seemed to be covered with thin ice.

Their bodies’ ability to react has dropped rapidly!

It let out a scream and its gigantic and sharp white claws went straight towards them!

“Kill it!!!”

The warriors who rushed out were shocked. They were experienced warriors, after all. At this time, they quickly broke free from the shackles of ice on their bodies and held their weapons in tightly as they attacked!

A series of skills gave off various rays of light and the night seemed to be illuminated in an instant!

Boom–

But the Ice crystal white bird seemed to lose its mind and attacked without any care!

Those skills attacked its white feathers which looked like ice crystals, sending out a lot of sparks, but they didn’t do any significant damage.

As its claws grabbed the warriors on the ground, the bodies of several warriors were immediately broken and a large number of organs fell on the entire ground.

What a fierce beast!

Lin Xiu, who saw this scene from a distance, couldn’t help but turn pale in shock.

The laser cannon did not cause any actual damage to the Ice crystal white bird. This Ice crystal white bird had evolved to have an IQ and even knew how to pretend to be weak to attract those warriors out.

“Prepare the laser cannon…!”

At the same time, on the other side, some people continued to activate laser cannons to shoot at the Ice crystal white bird.

With the activation of the laser cannon, a large number of energy beams gathered towards the muzzle.

In an instant, the entire place was illuminated by this light.

“Launch!!!”

Boom–

As soon as the man commanded, another terrifying laser cannon shot out, aiming directly at the head of the Ice crystal white bird!!!

Although its wings appeared to be very hard, its head was different. When attacked, it would be seriously injured!
