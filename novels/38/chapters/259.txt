Chapter 260: Terrifying flames

It seems like Lin Xiu had no way of destroying the shield which allowed him to heave a sigh of relief.

At this moment, he looked at Lin Xiu with a look of ridicule.

“Hahaha, after the vice president killed all those rank 6 warriors, it’s time for this kid to die!” These warriors in the protective shield watched as Lin Xiu attacked their protective shield but couldn’t break it and began to burst out laughing.

Lin Xiu attacked for a while, then withdrew the spear and did not attack again.

“What’s wrong? Given up?” The young man leaned close to the protective shield at this time and said while staring at Lin Xiu.

Now that he knew that Lin Xiu could not destroy the protective shield, his tone full of provocation.

“Is that so?” Lin Xiu said faintly at this time and at the next moment, he waved the Dark Edge spear in both hands again!

“Already told you that it’s useless!”

The warriors inside the shield thought that Lin Xiu would continue to attack again and began to laugh loudly.

But this time, they did not hear the sound of the spear hitting against the protective shield.

Instead, they saw a huge fiery red flame swept over!

Boom——

The entire shield was surrounded by flames!

Red Lotus Fire!

Lin Xiu frantically waved the Dark Edge spear at this time and flame after flame continued to be released.

Although these flames couldn’t destroy the protective shield directly, the temperature of the flames was too high.

They all felt an intense burning sensation.

Hot, too hot.

“No way! I can’t stand it anymore!” The skins of some of the warriors inside turned red at this moment.

These flames did not directly burn their bodies but they still felt extremely hot.

Almost all of the warriors were dripping in sweat because of the high temperature.

Some people even had white smoke coming out of their bodies.

“Damn!!!”

The young man who had provoked Lin Xiu just now had a sinister expression at this moment.

“Hurry up, hurry up leave!”

Several warriors felt that they were about to be cooked and even their sight was affected.

They didn’t have time to think and ran directly to the middle, then shut off the machine that unfolded the protective shield.

“What are you guys doing!” The young man turned around and was shocked when he saw that the protective shield had been removed by these men.

Without the protection of the protective shield, they would be in deep trouble!

“Goodbye!” Lin Xiu was holding the Dark Edge spear and the moment the protective shield disappeared, he thrust out the spear!

Swish——

The spear moved swiftly and there were even flames on the tip of it!

After all, this young man was also a rank 5 warrior and his reaction speed was also very fast as he tried to block Lin Xiu’s attack.

Dang——

After the tip of the spear hit his weapon, a clear sound rang out.

The young man felt a huge force coming over and his hand became numb as he dropped his weapon on the ground.

Bang–

The spear pierced through the man’s chest without any obstruction.

The blood sputtered as the spear tip pierced his chest.

“You…” He looked at the spear that had penetrated his heart and his eyes were still full of shock.

“Su Cheng!” Zhou Wenhao was fighting with Guo Ling and the others at this time when he took a glance and saw that Lin Xiu had already pierced the spear through this man’s body. His expression changed drastically as he roared.

Guo Ling didn’t stop attacking and directly slashed his body with the sword again!

“Get lost!!!”

Seeing Guo Ling attacking, Zhou Wenhao roared and the giant sword in his hand gave out a ray of light as he slashed towards Guo Ling!

Boom——

The huge impact caused the long sword in Guo Ling’s hand to be thrown directly out of her hand.

A burst of blood shot out of her body.

“Guo Ling!” Qiu Li and the rest were shocked when they saw this.

Zhou Wen didn’t pay attention to them anymore and rushed towards Lin Xiu at an extremely fast speed!

Lin Xiu’s reaction ability was also very strong. At this moment, he clearly felt something and turned around to see that Zhou Wenhao was already rushing over!

The pupils in his eyes constricted and he pulled out the Dark Edge spear from the young man’s chest!

Boom–

As the spear was pulled out, he saw the obvious hole in his chest.

Blood also slowly flowed out from this hole.

Dang——

The moment the Dark Edge spear was drawn out, he turned around and thrust it to the back!

It directly collided with the giant sword that Zhou Wenhao swung over and a loud noise was resounded.

Lin Xiu was shocked by this strong force and took a few steps back. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Zhou Wenhao directly grabbed the body of the man called Su Cheng who was about to fall to the ground.

“Wenhao… you must kill him…” The man whose chest was penetrated by Lin Xiu widened his eyes and spoke with difficulty.

At the next moment, his body twitched and he went silent.

Zhou Wenhao covered his eyes with his hand and after closing his wide-open eyes, his face became extremely gloomy.

Su Cheng was the son of the president of their guild. Zhou Wenhao was enraged that he died here.

Many of the remaining warriors were burned because of the flames that Lin Xiu released and their bodies turned charred.

“A rank 5 warrior actually pushed our guild to this point. It is considered an honor for you to die in my hands today.” Zhou Wenhao’s eyes were icy at this time. He placed Su Cheng’s body on the ground and turned around to look in Lin Xiu’s direction.

“We still don’t know who’s going to be the one dead.” Lin Xiu stared at Zhou Wenhao and said indifferently.

“Very well, then.” Zhou Wenhao laughed loudly, then a force went through his body and there were clicking sounds.

He didn’t appear very strong but at this moment, he was becoming muscular.

The combat suit on his body wrapped tightly around his muscles. The combat suit initially seemed quite loose on him but was now tight-fitting.

Lin Xiu covered his eyes with source strength and could see a large amount of source strength had exploded in Zhou Wenhao’s body.

This terrifying fluctuation of source strength affected even the surrounding air.

The leaves on the huge trees at the side made a rattling noise.
