Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

When they just started walking down this road, Ji Mei suddenly said aloud.

Because this path was exactly the same as the one she took before.

“This is the right way to go.”

Gao Lin also nodded at this time.

Lin Xiu looked around, there were many traces of damage on the ground.

“These were damaged when we fought before.”

Ji Mei seemed to see Lin Xiu’s eyes looking down at the ground, and suddenly said aloud.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded, and with Gao Lin and others leading ahead, he continued to walk.

Walking slowly, he found that the surrounding environment began to slowly become brighter.

“It’s here, it’s here.”

Ji Mei looked at the familiar surroundings and said aloud.

This was a very big place.

There were many strange buildings around, and in the middle, there was a huge angel sculpture.

This was a female seraph.

She was half-kneeling on the ground, holding a spear in her hand.

Her eyes seemed like two clusters of amethyst, emitting a faint purple light.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes when he saw this scene.

He has also read the information Wu Hao gave him before.

That angel’s tears are in the eyes of this angel statue.

But you can’t take it directly, because once you touch this huge angel statue.

She will come back to life.

This looks like an angel carved in stone, but it is actually a machine.

An artificial angel.

The power that burst out seems to be comparable to that of Sage warrior.

In addition to her outer armor, it seems to be made of some special material.

The group of warriors ten years ago came here under the employment of Wu Hao, but most of them were killed by this artificial angel.

Those who escaped were almost crippled.

“Do you want to start now?”

Gao Lin and the others also knew what was going to happen next. At this time, his eyes turned to Lin Xiu.

“How are you guys feeling right now?”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly, then said aloud.

“Still alright.”

The three Gao brothers nodded.

“Can.”

Following Lin Xiu’s gaze, Ji Mei also nodded.

But at this time, she clenched the long sword in her hand, and it could be seen that she was still a little nervous.

“Then I’ll go get it.”

With a thought, Lin Xiu took out a small box from his expansion space.

This is a special kind of box that can forcefully store these special energy bodies.

The Angel’s tears was also a special energy body.

Lin Xiu walked over, his body suspended.

He flew in front of the artificial angel’s face, then reached out and touched the corners of her amethyst-like eyes.

boom–

At this moment, Lin Xiu felt as if his hand had hit an invisible barrier.

He was directly sent flying.

Lin Xiu’s body flipped in the air, and then he landed firmly on the ground.

“interesting.”

At this time, Lin Xiu said out loud as if he was talking to himself. His mind was triggered and the Dark Edge spear appeared in his hand.

Holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he jumped straight up.

Break!

The source strength of his body was transmitted to the spear.

At this moment, the long spear changed from its original black lacquer body to something like amethyst-colored glass!

Boom—

As the long spear he was holding blasted towards the man-made angel statue, a loud noise suddenly erupted.

That transparent barrier seemed to shake violently because of Lin Xiu’s blow.

There was a sound that seemed to be able to blast off a person’s eardrums.

At this time, Gao Lin and others subconsciously covered their ears.

Lin Xiu, who was leaping in the air, continued to wave the spear in his hand, frantically attacking this invisible barrier.

Ji Mei covered her ears while looking at the scene in front of her. In addition to surprise, there was doubt in her eyes.

Just now, Lin Xiu had no weapons at all, but now, where did this long spear come from?

Before she could think about it, in the next moment, that invisible barrier was smashed to pieces!

Boom—

With a loud noise, the angel statue suddenly moved.

A powerful force came. After the barrier was broken, Lin Xiu, who wanted to take the Angel’s tears, was directly hit.

“The good show has begun.”

Lin Xiu stood firmly on the ground from the air, looked at the giant artificial angel statue that started to move, and said aloud.

The three Gao brothers, as well as Ji Mei, clenched the weapons in their hands at this time.

Their bodies were all tense, and it was obvious that they were very nervous.

After all, ten years ago, this artificial angel killed many warriors who were hailed as geniuses.

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

A strange sound rang out.

At the next moment, a large number of cracks began to appear on the outer layer of the angel statue.

Soon, those rock-like things began to fall off.

The metal armor of this artificial angel was revealed.

There was a purple light in her eyes.

“Here it comes!”

Gao Lin roared, and with Gao Cong and Gao Qiang, holding the sword in their hands, they waved directly into the air!

At this moment, a dazzling light appeared from their swords.

These three rays of light directly formed a huge energy cluster, which directly charged towards the artificial angel! Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

boom boom boom —

As these energy rays hit the artificial angel’s body, a huge sound suddenly erupted.

But as the light dissipated, they realized that this artificial angel actually used her huge shield to block in front of her body.

Resisting all their attacks!

And at this moment, the spear in her hand burst out with dazzling light.

As she waved, she directly attacked the three Gao brothers!

not good!

The pupils in the eyes of the three of them shrank slightly, and they scattered and dodged.

Boom—

This shot directly hit the location where they were just now, and the entire ground shook in an instant.

Ji Mei also jumped to the other side, the source mark on her forehead appeared, she waved her right hand, and the temperature of the air suddenly dropped.

One after another ice cones appeared in the air.

“go!”

Whoosh whoosh—

As soon as she finished speaking, the large number of ice cones that appeared charged directly towards this artificial angel!

bang bang bang-

Those icicles hit the artificial angel’s body, but they couldn’t even break her defenses!

The six wings on the back of the artificial angel radiated white light at this time. ,

Those eyes that glowed purple looked towards Ji Mei.

not good!

When Ji Mei saw this scene, her face changed greatly.
