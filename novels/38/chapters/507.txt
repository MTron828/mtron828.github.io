Chapter 508: Tortured

“So this is the Shadow Squad. They look scary!” This was the first time for some of them from the Zhao family to see their mysterious weapon- ‘The Shadow Squad’. The squad was giving out an extremely terrifying aura and all of them couldn’t help but be in awe.

“Hmph! Now that the Shadow Squad is here. That fella is dead!” Some of them from the Zhao family let out a breath of relief.

This was because Lin Xiu’s performance just now was incredibly terrifying for them.

He was a high-rank warrior that could ignore all of the laser beams that headed in his direction.

“Oh? Looks interesting.” Lin Xiu, who was reading to dash forward, suddenly noticed the group of men, dressed in black, that completely surrounded him.

These men were different from the warriors from before as Lin Xiu couldn’t clearly feel the murderous intention from their eyes.

Especially the man with the scar on his face. Lin Xiu could clearly feel the strong killing aura from him.

“A rank 6 warrior?” Shadow took a good look at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as well and pointed his spear at the Zhou family while asking them, “You’re going to help them?”

“You asked for it.” Shadow said in a cold tone towards Lin Xiu.

As soon as he was done, all the men dressed in black attacked Lin Xiu simultaneously!

Boom Boom Boom – –

With the weapons, they groaned softly as they started attacking on Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’.

Ci Ciiii Ciiii – –

As they weapon hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’, the lighting from the ‘Yuan’ passed through their weapon and went directly onto their bodies.

“Your ‘Yuan’ may be a little different from the rest that we’ve seen but your lightning is completely useless on us.” Shadow wasn’t in a hurry to fight Lin Xiu. Instead, he was watching the fight between his men and Lin Xiu.

In order to defeat your enemy, you should see through his skills, find his weakness so that you can kill him in one shot.

Shadow was being incredibly cautious.

“Really?” Lin Xiu gave a cold laugh. He didn’t dodge the attacks and immediately pierced Dark Edge into the air!

‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers’!

As Lin Xiu’s actions were extremely quick, there were three men that didn’t react in time and there were multiple bloody holes that appeared all over their bodies. A large amount of blood splattered all over the ground.

“That’s impossible!” Zhao Lin was frightened as well when he saw what happened.

His Shadow Squad! He had already lost three of them in such a short period of time?!

This was scary beyond words!

Shadow, who had planned on asking his men to fight so that he could observe Lin Xiu, suddenly turned serious as well.

“Captain, there’s something strange about the lightning.” As his men took a few steps back, they reported to Shadow.

“The lighting seems to have a numbing effect…”

WHAT?!

Shadow’s pupil shrank uncontrollably due to shock but before he could react, Lin Xiu was already headed towards him with his spear!

All of the markings on the body of the Dark Edge started to light up.

Along with the Dark Edge that pierced through the air, there was a loud explosion that followed. It was obvious how scary this weapon was.

The look in his eyes changed as he reached out for one of the men that stood by his right side. Shadow pulled that man and placed the man right in front of himself.

Then, Lin Xiu’s spear immediately pierced through that man’s head!

Xiu – –

Shadow threw the man’s body to the side and moved aside to dodge the attack himself.

“This…” Those from the Zhao family were shocked as well as the look in their eyes changed after seeing what happened.

“The result is what matters.” Zhao Lin warned them in a cold tone.

He would have never expected Lin Xiu to be so powerful. The Shadow Squad was just like a bunch of kids while fighting Lin Xiu.

“Captain… You…” As for the rest of the men from the Shadow Squad, their eyes widened in shock as well as they couldn’t believe what they had just seen.

“Kill him.” Shadow completely ignored the rest of them and bluntly gave his commands.

The rest of them looked at each other. They lifted their weapons once again and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

They had no other choice now. The only way that they could survive was if Lin Xiu was dead.

Boom Boom Boom – –

But, as soon as they did that, they could see a bright glow that appeared right in front of them. Then, they seemed to have lost consciousness and they fell into indefinite darkness.

The air was filled with silence.

Lin Xiu continued walking forward with his spear that was now covered in blood. There was even blood dripping off the tip of the spear.

“Dad…Dad!!!!1” Zhao Xia was trembling in fear. In his eyes, Lin Xiu was a demon!

He was now completely covered in terror. If the Shadow Squad had no ways of defeating him, who on earth would be able to stop Lin Xiu?!

“Are you still going to fight me?” Lin Xiu looked at Shadow who was still standing in front of him, blocking his path.

“Shadow!” Zhao Lin roared.

He may be in his late years but his scream was still loud and clear.

Shadow’s pupil once again shrank uncontrollably. It felt as if the energy in his body had been excited. He activated ‘Yuan’ as well, covering himself.

Then, with his machete, he rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu sneered and swung the Dark Edge as well while attacking Shadow!

Clang Clang Clang – –

Both the weapons crashed onto each other, giving out a bright, clear sound that rang across the area.

‘Awe of Phoenix’!

Lin Xiu held onto his spear and screamed out loud. Then, there were flaming birds that came out of the tip of his spear and were heading towards Shadow!

Koong Loong – –

Shadow’s skills were extremely peculiar as well but it was true to his name. His body was moving effortlessly and dodged all of the flaming birds.

As the flaming birds landed on the ground, the entire ground shook with a loud explosion. There were even craters that were formed all over the place.

Where is he?!

As Lin Xiu looked in front of him, trying to find Shadow, he realized that Shadow’s body went missing!

‘Shadow Stream Slash’!

As Lin Xiu was still caught in surprise, the Shadow figure appeared right behind Lin Xiu and Shadow’s machete was aimed towards Lin Xiu’s body!

At that moment, his entire machete turned black and it looked strange.

Go to hell!!

Shadow’s eyes were now filled with hatred and just when his strange machete was about to hit Lin Xiu’s head, Lin Xiu picked up Dark Edge and swung it backward. He managed to defend himself from Shadow’s attack!

Although he managed to block the attack with his spear, there was a black material that went from the machete, passing through the Dark Edge that landed on Lin Xiu!
