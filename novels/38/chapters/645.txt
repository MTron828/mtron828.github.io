Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Phew, it’s a little stressful.”

Ouyang Hang clenched the long sword in his hand and seemed a little nervous.

Not only Ouyang Hang, Huang Zhen and Qian Yao all took a deep breath at this time.

This was the finals!

And they had to fight against the Sky Academy.

“Next, we invite our Sky Academy team to play!”

After introducing the Sacred Region academy, the host started to introduce the Sky Academy.

Sure enough, when Sky Academy was mentioned, the surrounding scene seemed very excited.

After all, this was equivalent to the home team!

“Later, I’ll hold them back, and you’ll get rid of the weakest one first.”

Baili Haoling watched the people from Sky Academy come on stage, and said to Lin Xiu at this time.

‘Ent

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

This battle was different from the previous battles. It could be said that now was the real battle.

But Ouyang Hang and the others were still at rank 7, so their role in this battle would be minimal. In the end, they need to rely on Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling to fight against the five members of Sky Academy.

Moreover, in this battle, there was also Luo Yue.

“T don’t want you to retain your strength in this battle.”

At this time, Nan Huang took the lead to stand on the roof, and then said to Luo Yue who was behind him.

Luo Yue gave him a cold look, and didn’t say much.

“Don’t worry, I will win this battle.”

One of the men said with a smile at this time.

“Of course, their strength is too weak.”

At this time, Nan Huang glanced at Lin Xiu and the others on the opposite side, then shook his head and said.

The words were full of confidence.

Lin Xiu felt Nan Huang’s eyes looking at him, and at this time he also looked over at Nan Huang’s side.

The two of them looked at each other as if there were sparks. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

‘When he was in the Thunder Valley, his strength was not enough yet he still wanted to kill him.

At that time, if those few rank 8 warriors really dealt with him, he would definitely die.

This revenge must be taken!

“We meet again.”

At this time, Yu Muchen looked at Lin Xiu, then said with a faint smile.

“But this time, you can’t possibly win.”

Yu Muchen’s tone was full of confidence.

The last time he actually lost to Lin Xiu, it was quite a shock to him, so after returning, he cultivated frantically, and his current strength was already at the peak of the rank 8!

Although he also watched Lin Xiu’s battle before, Lin Xiu did appear to be quite strong, but he still did not believe that Lin Xiu’s strength would be stronger than him.

“You have to try it to find out.”

Lin Xiu said lightly, in his words, there was no panic at all, but instead he was full of confidence.

“Interesting.”

Yu Muchen smiled, but what he cared more about was the girl by Lin Xiu’s side.

The girl looked like she was about sixteen years old, but Yu Muchen could clearly feel a strong sense of coercion coming from her body.

‘What is the origin of this girl, to make him feel this way?

“If you can’t beat us, just go straight down.”

Lin Xiu looked at Ouyang Hang and the others, and said in a low voice.

“But…”

“No buts, that is if you don’t want to die.”

Lin Xiu hadn’t spoken yet, and Baili Haoling added at this time.

Hearing Baili Haoling’s words, Ouyang Hang and the others were silent for a while, then nodded.

It could be seen that the eyes of the people of the Sky Academy were full of killing intent.

It was clear that they wanted to kill everyone in Sacred Region academy.

“Game… begins!!!”

And at this time, the host has announced the start of the game!

‘As soon as his words fell, the people from the Sky Academy rushed up.

‘The speed was very fast, and the five of them rushed up like phantoms.

Bang bang bang-

Ouyang Hang, Huang Zhen and Qian Yao used ‘Sphere’ without any hesitation when the host announced the start of the game!

At this moment, the warriors of the Sky Academy all attacked their ‘Sphere’.

But even so, they felt that they had suffered a very strong impact.

In the next moment, the body flew out directly.

“En? Did you expand the ‘Sphere’ ahead of time?”

The two men from Sacred Region academy raised their brows and said aloud.

On the other side, Luo Yue held a long sword and quickly attacked Ouyang Hang.

Dang dang-

Luo Yue’s attack was too fierce, even if Ouyang Hang parried her attack, it was very uncomfortable.

Ouyang Hang originally thought that Luo Yue would be merciful because of Lin Xiu’s relationship, but he was very wrong, Luo Yue didn’t pull back at all.

‘The next moment, as the long sword in Luo Yue’s hand stabbed out again, it immediately hit Ouyang Hang’s ‘Sphere’.

A terrifying force came, and his whole body flew out again!

He flew directly out of the platform.

And fell heavily to the ground.

Pff—

Ouyang Hang felt a tightness in his chest, and he vomited out a mouthful of blood.

“Ouyang Hang is out!”

Hearing the referee’s voice, Ouyang Hang wiped the blood from his lips and stood up.

He knew that Luo Yue deliberately shot him out, otherwise, he would die.

Boom-

At the same time, Huang Zhen and Qian Yao were attacked by two warriors and could not resist.

But even if they were able to forcibly resist their attack, the powerful impact still made them feel as if their whole body was shaken with blood surging.

And the state of ‘Sphere’ seemed almost impossible to maintain!

“Go to hell!”

‘The two warriors of the Sky Academy obviously wanted to kill them directly.

Run!

At this time, Huang Zhen, Qian Yao and the others looked at each other. This time, they did not directly resist their attack, but retreated directly to the back.

The two warriors of Sky City were obviously a little stunned.

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao, jumped out of the competition stage?

“Huang Zhen, Qian Yao, out!”

“Damn…”

‘When the two of them jumped off the competition platform, they couldn’t help but heaved a sigh of relief. Although they maintained their ‘Sphere’ state just now, they almost broke the ‘Sphere’ under the crazy attacks of these two and it was very likely that they will be killed.

Because they clearly felt the terrifying murderous aura from the two warriors of Sky Academy.

If they were going to be killed in vain like this, they might as well leave the platform.

“Tt seems that you still have self-knowledge, you are considered to be very lucky.”

Awarrior looked at Huang Zhen and Qian Yao and said with a sneer..
