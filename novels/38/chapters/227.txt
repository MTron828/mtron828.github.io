Chapter 228: First!

Taken a forbidden drug?

Hearing the words of the teacher from Class 1 of the South Campus, everyone looked over here at this time.

They were all looking at Lin Xiu and appeared to have a revelation.

“It’s possible, otherwise, why did he suddenly become so strong just now!” Some people in Class 1 of the South Campus said immediately.

Lin Xiu’s strength burst forth and actually defeated Zhuo Qixing – to them, this was indeed shocking.

“Exactly! There’s no way he could beat Zhuo Qixing!!!” The people around shouted.

“Investigate! We request for an investigation!”

“I don’t mind.” Lin Xiu glanced at these people and said faintly.

“I’ll do it!” At this time, the teacher from Class 1 of the South Campus came over with a device and looked at Lin Xiu with a gloomy expression.

Then, he motioned Lin Xiu to exhale into the device.

If you take a forbidden drug, the exhaled air will be directly detected by the device.

With everyone looking, Lin Xiu exhaled directly at the device.

Soon, as the sound of the machine rang, the test results appeared on the display of the device.

“Nothing abnormal…!?” The teacher of Class 1 of the South Campus opened his eyes wide at this time, looking at the display in disbelief.

This is impossible! Could it be that this kid really defeated Zhuo Qixing with his own strength!?

“Are you guys sore losers!” Zhang Yin and the others had already walked up and sneered at those in Class 1 of the South Campus.

When those people heard Zhang Yin’s words, their faces turned red for a second then white.

Especially the teacher of Class 1 of the South Campus, his face became even nastier.

Class 10 of the South Campus defeated Class 1 of the South Campus.

This has never appeared in the entire history of the Sacred Region Academy!

“Hahaha, Lin Xiu, you have won glory for our class!” Nan Zhengjun also walked over at this time, patted Lin Xiu’s shoulder, and said aloud.

He was smiling from ear to ear now.

After all, he was the teacher of Class 10 of the South College. If the students in his class have this ability, it made him very happy thing too.

Dean Baili looked at Lin Xiu and while touching his beard, he said “I hereby announce that Lin Xiu won first place for the G17 Ruin competition!”

Dean Baili’s voice was very loud. Upon hearing Dean Baili’s words, the people in Class 10 of the South Campus cheered.

The other classes were silent, especially Class 1 of the South Campus and they looked like a cock that had been defeated in a fight.

It was even more embarrassing for their teacher who suspected that Lin Xiu cheated, he couldn’t say a word at this moment.

“The reward for the first place is an increase of 50,000 points for each student in the class.”

“The five students who went to G17 Ruin will all get one of the top gold skill cards in the academy’s skills pavilion.” Dean Baili had already jumped back to the high platform at this time and he glanced at the crowd and said.

50,000 points! You also get to choose any top-notch gold skill card!

Hearing Dean Baili’s announcement, these people were shocked. Everyone from the other classes was looking at Class 10 of the South Campus with their eyes filled with envy, jealousy, and resentment.

This is 50,000 points!

“Second place, Class 1 of the South Campus, each student in the class gets 40,000 points, and those who went to G17 Ruin will get an extra 10,000 points. Although the second place was still awarded many points, the people in their class weren’t happy.

Because the top freshman, the pride of their class, Zhuo Qixing, lost!

“Hahaha, Lin Xiu, now you are the number one freshman in the Sacred Region Academy!” Zhang Yin and Li Ping said happily at this time.

The students from Class 10 of the South Campus around them also nodded.

“Let’s go.” Luo Yue walked over, looked at Lin Xiu, and said faintly.

“Where to?” Lin Xiu was taken aback and asked.

“Skills Pavilion.”

Skills Pavilion, the collection of skills in there was different from the exchange center, many of them were passed down for a long time, or skill cards there were not sold on the market.

Only those who have received special rewards could enter to choose skill cards.

At this moment, Luo Yue led Lin Xiu and the others towards the Skills Pavilion.

Soon, they arrived at the Skills Pavilion located in the west of the field.

“This Skills Pavilion… looks so small.” Jiang Li looked at the small traditional-style wooden house in front and commented.

“Aren’t they worried that people would steal the skill cards from this wooden house?” Zhang Yin was also a little curious when he saw it.

“This is the Heavenly Iron Gate and it is harder than ordinary metal alloys.” Luo Yue glanced at them at this time and said faintly.

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Zhang Yin and the others got a little embarrassed.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue went forward side by side at this time.

He was already a rank 5 warrior now and had used those previous skills too many times. Also, the battles in the arena were videotaped so people would definitely find a way to counterattack his skills.

He had to learn a few more powerful skills.

“You guys are here?” Just when Luo Yue and Lin Xiu walked in, a terrifying voice resounded in the house.

Lin Xiu was taken aback. He looked ahead and saw an old man sitting on the ground over there, smoking an e-cigarette.

“We are…” Lin Xiu was stunned and when he was about to speak to the old man, the old man waved his hand.

“I already know, go in and choose, remember, each person can only choose one gold skill card.”

The old man said aloud at this time.

Lin Xiu was surprised for a moment, then nodded and walked in with Luo Yue and the others.

This Skills Pavilion did not look big and the decoration inside was also simple.

It was like entering an old library and those skill cards were displayed on the cabinets.

“So many skill cards…” Zhang Yin and the others exclaimed in surprise as they looked at the glistening skill cards around.

The skill cards here were almost all gold skills. As they walked further in, the place was filled with diamond skills.

There were so many diamond skills and each one was unique.

Lin Xiu looked at the gold skills area and there were a lot of these skill cards, but there were lesser spear arts cards.

He took a closer look and those skill cards at the corner had traces of dust on them.

What was this…

At this time, the skill cards in the corner caught Lin Xiu’s eyes.
