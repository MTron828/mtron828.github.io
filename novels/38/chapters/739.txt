After becoming a master warrior-level warrior, his attributes had increased so much!

Especially the physique attribute – it has almost doubled.

This was something that Lin Xiu did not expect at all.

After thinking about it, Lin Xiu also checked the attributes of the master warrior title.

Master warrior Title: Wearing this title, you can obtain the skill [Source strength Absorption] (Passive effect: Absorb 5% of the opponent’s lost energy and convert it into one’s own when attacking the opponent. It is invalid for warriors or evolved beasts with a higher rank than yourself.), the title inherits the rank 9 title attribute.

Lost energy? What does it mean?

Is it the power of skills unleashed by the warriors?

Lin Xiu was a little confused, but he still changed the title.

After taking a deep breath, he clearly felt that the strength in his body was slowly recovering, and then he got up.

At this time, Lin Xiu, whose sense of power had also become stronger, could clearly feel that there were a lot of footsteps coming from around him.

After thinking about it for a while, he knew that it might be because of the huge commotion just now during the battle, especially the evolved beasts that he summoned after using [Exotic Summoning], which must have attracted the attention of those people.

Thinking of this at this time, Lin Xiu looked around, picked up the mask that fell on the ground, and left.

“Where’s the evolved beast!? I just saw a huge one!”

At the same time, some warriors had arrived.

Looking at the surrounding scene, some people suddenly froze in place.

“Hu.”

At the same time, Lin Xiu had already run back to his room.

“Hu.”

Returning to the room, after taking off the mask, Lin Xiu laid on the ground a little out of breath.

“So tired.”

After experiencing this night’s battle, Lin Xiu was indeed a little physically and mentally exhausted.

After taking a good bath, Lin Xiu lay on the bed and fell asleep quickly.

Bang bang bang-

Lin Xiu rubbed his sleepy eyes after hearing the knock on the door faintly.

“Who is it?”

The dazzling sunlight came in from the floor-to-ceiling windows.

The weather in Ice and Snow City was really weird. There was sunshine, but the whole city was still full of snow, and it was still as cold as ever.

As soon as the door was opened, Lin Xiu saw Jiang Jun and others standing outside the door.

“What’s wrong?”

Lin Xiu looked at the staff who were going to take them to Fengyun City, and suddenly said out of curiosity.

Jiang Jun glanced at Lin Xiu, and then found that Lin Xiu was wearing pajamas, as if he had just woken up, and there was a bit of doubt in his eyes.

“Where did you go last night?”

Jiang Jun thought for a while, then said aloud.

“I was in the room.”

Lin Xiu waved helplessly and said.

“You know, I don’t know which damned guy spread the rumors that I have a purple gold skill card. It’s so dangerous to go out. I’ve never left this place.”

Jiang Jun saw that Lin Xiu seemed very natural and what Lin Xiu said was correct, so Jiang Jun was less suspicious.

“Did you know, Mr. Huangji, he disappeared last night.”

Jiang Jun furrowed his eyebrows and said.

“Disappeared? What’s going on?”

Lin Xiu said with a surprised look.

“I don’t know the specifics. It’s still under investigation.”

Jiang Jun spoke, and then left with the others.

After Lin Xiu closed the door, his eyes suddenly narrowed.

He killed that Huangji last night, and his body was also swallowed up by the evolved beast of a different dimension, not even a scum was left.

Moreover, when Lin Xiu was leaving, he also found the Purple Gold Skill Card that had fallen on the snow.

It was a skill card for swordsmanship, so he probably hadn’t had time to practice.

“It’s a suitable gift to Luo Yue.”

Lin Xiu took out the skill card and looked at it, the corners of his mouth curled up, and he said aloud as if he was talking to himself.

“He didn’t lie just now?”

After Jiang Jun walked out, he spoke to the staff beside him.

“Don’t think so.”

The staff member shook his head and said.

“Maybe I think too much. Even if this kid has had a conflict with Mr. Huangji, with his strength, how could he be Mr. Huangji’s opponent?”

Jiang Jun said helplessly at this time.

However, where did Huangji go?

After changing into the battle suit, Lin Xiu had breakfast at the hotel to fill his stomach.

“Hey, you are here.”

Qian Jin seemed to see Lin Xiu’s figure, and came over at this time.

Lin Xiu looked at Qian Jin who came over and nodded slightly.

“Hey, do you know that the old man Huangji seems to have disappeared.”

Qian Jin looked around, then lowered his voice and said to Lin Xiu.

“I know, Jiang Jun and the others came to ask me just now.”

When Lin Xiu heard Qian Jin’s words, he spread his hands helplessly and said.

“They suspect that it’s you...” Qian Jin also responded quickly, and then smiled, “They are crazy, although your strength is quite strong, but the old man is also a top-level existence among master warrior-level warriors. ”

He wouldn’t believe what Lin Xiu could do to Huangji. After all, Huangji’s strength was another level.

“I don’t know what they mean either.”

Lin Xiu spread out his hands pretending to be innocent and said.

“By the way, do you know when we can go to Fengyun City?”

“I don’t know about this either. I went to the warrior forum to inquire about the news. It is said that for some unknown reason this year, the evolved beasts rioted violently. The section in front of the Ice and Snow City was destroyed and is now being repaired.” Qian Jin also looked a little helpless.

“Anyway, there’s still some time before the official game, so don’t worry.”

Qian Jin thought that Lin Xiu was in a hurry because he was afraid of delaying the competition.

“Ok.”

Lin Xiu smiled lightly and didn’t say much.

“By the way, there is a good place in Ice and Snow City, should we go and see it?”

Qian Jin seemed to have thought of something, and then said excitedly.

“Where?”

Lin Xiu was startled and said subconsciously.

“The Source Mark Land’!
