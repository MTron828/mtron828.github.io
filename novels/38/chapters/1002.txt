Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“He wouldn’t die so easily.”

Huangfu Bai looked at the thick smoke and said suddenly.

“Damn.”

Huangfu Lin also clenched his hands into fists at this time.

Although he had noticed before that Lin Xiu’s strength might had improved, he did not expect that Lin Xiu’s strength would increase to such a level.

!!

Sage warrior, Lin Xiu’s current strength is definitely at the level of Sage warrior!

How did he do it?

In a short period of time, he has crossed from Respected warrior to Sage warrior level.

Could it be in this Sage warrior space…

swoosh—

Just when he was full of confusion, Lin Xiu’s figure rushed out from the thick dust!

Whoosh whoosh—

The long spear in his hand directly attacked Huangfu Lin!

Huangfu Lin was shocked and quickly held the long sword in his hand to block Lin Xiu’s attack.

Dangdang-

Under the collision between the Dark Edge spear and the sword in his hand, a crisp sound suddenly erupted.

Huangfu Lin looked at the Dark Edge spear that Lin Xiu was holding and on the spear’s body, there were many fiery red source marks lit up.

The source mark is engraved on the weapon?

In addition to the shocking look in Huangfu Lin’s eyes, there was also a look of fear.

In the next moment, while resisting Lin Xiu’s attack, he kept retreating.

“‘Frozen Earth’!!!”

Huangfu Lin was already anxious at this time. At the next moment, when he let out a roar, a powerful source strength suddenly burst out.

In the next moment, the surrounding air suddenly became extremely cold.

clap clap-

At this moment, the surrounding ground turned into ice sculptures.

Even Lin Xiu, who attacked with his spear, was directly frozen!

When Huangfu Lin saw this scene at this moment, he was relieved.

“Humph! What a fool.”

Looking at Lin Xiu who was frozen into an ice sculpture by his own strength, he couldn’t help snorting coldly.

“Quickly kill him!”

Huangfu Bai and Huangfu Zhong shouted at the same time as they looked at Lin Xiu who was frozen into an ice sculpture by Huangfu Lin’s skills.

Holding the weapon in his hand directly, he attacked Lin Xiu.

clack clack——

At this moment, a large number of cracks appeared on the ice.

Just as Huangfu Zhong and Huangfu Bai rushed over, the ice sculpture burst into pieces in an instant.

The large amount of ice that had just shattered rushed towards the attacking Huangfu Lin and Huangfu Bai!

bang bang bang-

The two people who were going to attack, had a change in expression and unfolded their ‘Sphere’.

He’s fine!?

Lin Xiu, who had recovered from the state of being frozen, waved the spear in his hand and the dark blue flaming birds charged towards them directly!

Damn it!

When the two of them saw such terrifying flaming birds, their eyes changed slightly and they turned from attack to defense.

“Go to hell!!!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Seeing this scene, Huangfu Lin also went crazy.

He used that ice-type skill to attack Lin Xiu!

It seemed that he wanted to freeze Lin Xiu again.

Because, this was the only skill he can use against Lin Xiu.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu turned around and looked back and suddenly snorted coldly.

The Dark Edge spear in his hand waved directly into the air!

‘Adjudicate’!

Although Lin Xiu has not used this skill for a long time, he was still very good at it.

Huangfu Lin used an ice-type skill while Lin Xiu had a heart of frost.

Ice-type skill were completely useless to Lin Xiu!

swoosh—

At the next moment, Huangfu Lin, who was still ferocious, was immediately frozen into an ice sculpture!

At this moment, Lin Xiu charged directly over there, the Dark Edge spear in his hand pointed directly at Huangfu Lin, which had turned into an ice sculpture!

Boom—

Huangfu Lin’s body shattered into countless pieces as the ice sculpture shattered!

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for killing the Sage warrior-level warrior and gaining experience 1764841…”

There was also a sound of prompting that he gained experience in his mind.

Huangfu Lin, dead.

“Huangfu Lin!”

On the other side, Huangfu Bai had just dodged the impact of the flaming bird when he saw this scene and suddenly roared.

Huangfu Lin was an elder of the Divine Domain after all. Now that he’s dead, it was a huge loss to the Divine Domain.

boom boom boom —

And at this time, the artificial angel was still frantically attacking the surrounding Divine Domain warriors.

The whole ground continued to vibrate wildly.

This artificial angel was not only powerful in attack, but also has a ridiculously high defensive energy.

Those peak Respected warrior-level warriors not only did not cause any damage to the artificial angel, but almost all died under the spear of the artificial angel.

Huangfu Bai’s heart was dripping blood. After Huangfu Lin, a Sage warrior-level warrior, died, almost all of those elite members died as well.

This was a huge blow to the Divine Domain.

“Next, it’s you guys’ turn.”

Lin Xiu, who was holding the Dark Edge spear, looked at Huangfu Bai and Huangfu Zhong.

After reaching the Sage warrior level, Lin Xiu’s strength has improved a lot.

Huangfu Lin, who seemed to be extremely powerful and forced himself to only use the space ring, was also killed by Lin Xiu.

Huangfu Bai and Huangfu Zhong clenched their weapons while staring at Lin Xiu.

Now their faces were extremely nasty.

At this time, when their thoughts were triggered, they will use the domain forces.

But when the domain forces they used merely touched the ground, the white light that was originally on the ground instantly covered their domain forces.

Their domain cannot be used normally at all.

For them, this was simply a disaster.

“Hm? Done?”

Lin Xiu glanced to the back at this time, the artificial angel had already eliminated all the warriors of the Divine Domain.

At this time, she was standing behind Lin Xiu, as if waiting for Lin Xiu’s instructions.

Huangfu Bai looked at Lin Xiu with a flickering look in his eyes.

“it’s time.”

Hearing Huangfu Bai’s voice, Huangfu Zhong nodded.

In the next moment, a dark blue source mark appeared on his forehead.

With the display of the source mark, some black substances instantly covered the surrounding area.

“Um?”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu immediately raised his brows.

There were too many source marks in the element class. Lin Xiu was also a little curious when he saw these different source marks.

Soon, the power of Huangfu Zhong’s source mark was revealed.

The bodies of the warriors who were killed by the artificial angel began to move slowly.

Soon, the corpses of nearly a hundred Respected warriors all stood up.

Their bones were broken by the artificial angel attack and their whole body was bloody. When they stood up at this time, they looked like the living dead, extremely terrifying.
