Chapter 239: Suppress Him And Attack!

Now Yu Yi also felt that something was wrong.

He killed Lin Xiu just now but there was no blood that splashed out at all!

And what shocked him even more was that Lin Xiu’s body was cut in two. At this moment, with a resounding “bang”, the body that was cut into two instantly turned into smoke and disappeared.

What is going on!?

The crowd was taken aback too. They all thought that Lin Xiu was killed in the arena and didn’t expect this to happen at all.

“By the way, I think I saw Lin Xiu use this move before!” Zhang Yin seemed to have recalled something at this moment and said with sudden realization. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

When fighting with Zhuo Qixing that day, Lin Xiu used this weird move as well and avoided a fatal attack.

Although he didn’t know what skill Lin Xiu used, Zhang Yin and the others were relieved at this time.

Yu Yi, who was in the arena, seemed to sense something at this time as he turned around and looked behind.

He immediately saw Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear, charging toward him!

“Courting death!” Yu Yi went pale and was very furious.

He got tricked by Lin Xiu!

He was a little bit irritated. At this moment, holding the long sword in his hand, he attacked Lin Xiu!

Boom–

The long sword collided with the tip of Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear but there was no sound of metals colliding like before.

It was replaced by a slightly dull sound, which made people find it very strange.

Yu Yi obviously realized this as well but did not stop attacking with the long sword in his hand.

While easily blocking the long spear that Lin Xiu was thrusting, he waved the long sword and cut Lin Xiu’s body in two again!

“Ah!” Some girls couldn’t help exclaiming when they saw the bloody scene.

But what shocked them was that there was no blood spilling out of Lin Xiu, who was clearly cut in half again.

It was just like before. At this time, Lin Xiu turned into a cloud of smoke and disappeared.

Yu Yi was already enraged at this moment.

Twice, Lin Xiu clearly got attacked by him twice but he didn’t expect that what he attacked seemed to be a puppet that looked exactly like Lin Xiu!

This was really weird.

“Again!?” Yu Yi felt that someone appeared behind him again, his gaze changed suddenly, and he turned around abruptly.

It was exactly the same as before!

Yu Yi snorted coldly, then swung his sword to kill Lin Xiu.

But what he didn’t expect was that at this time, the Dark Edge spear stabbed across and collided with Yu Yi’s long sword, causing a loud sound.

This strength!

Yu Yi’s eyes widened instantly and the pupils in his eyes constricted suddenly.

Now he finally realized that everything just now was fake but this current Lin Xiu was real!

And because he thought this Lin Xiu was a fake, he didn’t put much strength in swinging the sword. At this time, when it collided with Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear, a loud “dang” resounded.

His hand was numb and Lin Xiu’s spear actually sent his sword flying!

And at this time, the movement of Lin Xiu’s hand did not stop in the slightest, the spear in his right hand stabbed him frantically!

The speed of the spear was so fast that the surrounding wind made a rattling noise.

“This is the real one!!!” The students watching were all shocked at this time.

They had no idea that Lin Xiu would have this kind of skill, it was like a cloning technique!

Besides, every Lin Xiu looked exactly like the real Lin Xiu except for its strength.

Now that Yu Yi’s sword was knocked off by Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu would most likely defeat Yu Yi!

He defeated Yu Yi once again!

“Damn it!” Ouyang Hang slammed a punch to the armrest beside him.

His face became very nasty at this time. He didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would play such a trick again.

Losing the weapon in his hand was equivalent to breaking off his left and right arms. Now if Yu Yi continues to fight Lin Xiu, he would die for sure!

“Damn!!!” Yu Yi used his body skill and kept avoiding Lin Xiu.

But what he didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu was surprisingly fast and every shot he stabbed out almost hit his body.

This made him break out in cold sweat.

Lin Xiu stared at Yu Yi, frowning slightly.

Although he just relied on ‘Mirror Image’ to knock out Yu Yi’s weapon, Yu Yi was a rank 6 warrior after all.

Yu Yi’s body skill was extremely powerful, if he really wanted to defeat Yu Yi, it would still be a little difficult.

And Lin Xiu had a feeling that this guy was still hiding something, Lin Xiu wouldn’t win so easily.

But even if he was hiding something, Lin Xiu was not afraid.

The spear in Lin Xiu’s hand continued to strike towards Yu Yi.

The spear was like a dragon!

Yu Yi looked at this strong spear art and kept backing away, his face was extremely serious.

“Yu Yi’s reaching the edge soon, if he continues to step back like this, he will lose!

At this moment, some students of the Sacred Region Academy exclaimed when they saw this scene.

Yu Yi lost the previous time because he stepped out of the arena. Was he going to repeat the same mistake this time!?

“Awesome!” Li Ping clenched his fist, staring at the silhouettes of Lin Xiu and Yu Yi in the arena.

It was obvious that Lin Xiu had the upper hand!

The battle between a rank 5 warrior and a rank 6 warrior and it turned out that the rank 5 warrior had the upper hand. If he hadn’t seen it with his own eyes, he would not have believed it.

In the past, Li Ping was upset that Lin Xiu was the class monitor. However, he slowly began to admire Lin Xiu since then.

Seeing this scene right now, he was in awe!

Ouyang Hang gritted his teeth, took a deep breath, and calmed down, then sat on the chair.

“Seems like he should be using that thing soon.”

After he used that thing, his strength would be greatly improved in a short time.

This thing was not very effective for ordinary warriors, but for rank 6 warriors with an abundant source strength, the effect could be exerted to the extreme!

When the time comes, even if Lin Xiu’s spear art was powerful, he would still die!

Boom–

At this moment, as Yu Yi was forced to the edge by Lin Xiu’s offense, Yu Yi’s gaze changed. Seeing the Dark Edge spear that was about to stab him again, he suddenly stretched out his hands and caught it directly. The body of the spear!

The Dark Edge spear that pierced swiftly and violently was caught by Yu Yi in the next instant!
