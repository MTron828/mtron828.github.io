Chapter 894: One Hundred Years

Phew–

Everything happened in a twinkling of an eye. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

After regaining his senses at this time, Lin Xiu opened his eyes and exhaled.

After absorbing the white light, Lin Xiu felt that his entire body seemed to be extremely light.

It seemed that his level has not improved and he has not gained experience or anything.

But Lin Xiu felt that his body had become much stronger.

He looked to the front and found that the white light that had just shrouded the holy-level skill card had completely disappeared at this moment!

It seemed that they were all absorbed by him?

Now inside this huge glass container, there is only a skill card emitting a faint white light.

Lin Xiu hesitated for a while, then reached out.

Very easily, he took this holy-level skill card in his hand.

Unlike ordinary skill cards, this holy-level skill card was different – he could tell that it was different just by touching it.

It’s obviously a very hard card, but when you hold it in your hand, it feels like you’re holding a marshmallow.

This sense of contrast made Lin Xiu speechless.

“Greetings Master.”

At this moment, Zhao Yongyuan suddenly knelt on the ground and clasped his fists respectfully to Lin Xiu.

This sudden scene made Lin Xiu stunned for a while.

“You made a mistake...”

Lin Xiu said subconsciously.

“No, you have the blood of the Ye family and you have the imperial decree. You are my master.”

Zhao Yongyuan said seriously at this time.

The white light just now is the light of annihilation. Only people of the Ye family bloodline can touch it, otherwise, it will hurt them.

Lin Xiu was startled, then he realized that the imperial decree mentioned by Zhao Yongyuan should be the token of the Ye family.

And he was not affected by the so-called light of annihilation. It should be due to the white light in his heart that he inherited from the old man.

“You get up first.”

Lin Xiu looked at Zhao Yongyuan and said.

This Zhao Yongyuan’s strength is also at the level of Respected warrior. With this thug around, it should be much more convenient for Lin Xiu to handle matters on the planet Namir.

And it’s not that simple to seek revenge from the Bai family. Of course, the more people he gathered, the better.

“Yes.” Zhao Yongyuan nodded and stood up.

“Why are you here?”

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then spoke to him.

This nine-story pagoda seemed to be built specifically for the Ye family.

“Emperor Ye was conspiring against the Bai family and almost all the descendants of the Ye family were wiped out. As a small force hidden by the Ye family, our Zhao family acquired one of the unique skills of the Ye family and built a nine-story tower here.”

“I, Zhao Yongyuan, guard this place under the orders of the ancestors of the Zhao family. If the descendants of the Ye family need to use the power of my Zhao family to take revenge, they will definitely set foot here. At that time, the descendants of the Ye family will be able to obtain the unique skills of the Ye family based on the blood of the Ye family.”

Zhao Yongyuan said seriously.

After hearing Zhao Yongyuan’s words, Lin Xiu nodded immediately.

From this perspective, everything makes sense.

“How long have you been on this tower?”

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something and suddenly said out of curiosity.

Zhao Yongyuan thought for a while, then said, “About a hundred years.”

A hundred years!?

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened involuntarily.

This person actually stayed on this tower for a hundred years.
