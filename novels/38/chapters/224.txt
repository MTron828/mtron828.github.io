Chapter 225: ‘Hidden Origin Art’

Zhuo Qixing laughed and said.

He was a bit deranged now and had a sinister look on his face.

He wiped the blood from his lips. In the next moment, the muscles all over his body seemed to start to swell up slowly.

He, who was already tall and strong, became even more terrifying at this time.

Lin Xiu’s source strength covered his eyes.

Taking a closer look, the source strength on Zhuo Qixing’s body had already exploded into a terrifying state at this time.

The light green source strength was continuously released from his body madly.

Very strong source strength!

“This is ‘Hidden Origin Art’!?” Ouyang Hang widened his eyes when he saw this scene.

The current state that Zhuo Qixing was in did seem very terrifying and the powerful air around him had shocked the surrounding Sacred Region Academy students.

“‘Hidden Origin Art’?” A student from Class 1 of the North Campus said curiously as he watched Lin Xiu and Ouyang Hang.

He really hadn’t heard of this kind of cultivation technique.

“En, this is a way to suppress and hide one’s powerful source strength in the body. The more suppressed source strength there is, the greater the explosive power when it is released.” Ouyang Hang said with a gloomy expression. .

This ‘Hidden Origin Art’ cultivation technique was extremely harsh and ordinary people couldn’t practice it at all, but he didn’t expect that Zhuo Qixing would actually be able to practice this technique.

Also, he was now bursting out part of the source strength which was much stronger than when he was in tiptop condition.

“That kid, he is so dead.” Tian Zixia listened to Ouyang Hang’s words, her eyes turned cold at this time and she said bitterly.

Compared to Ouyang Hang, she hated Lin Xiu more.

“‘Crippling Spirit’!” Zhuo Qixing moved again at this time and immediately used the ultimate move!

Zhuo Qixing’s toes touched the ground and he rushed towards Lin Xiu like a bullet.

One could even hear the gust of wind.

The long sword in his hand suddenly turned into a dazzling light at this moment.

A large amount of source strength has been poured into his long sword and he stabbed Lin Xiu abruptly!

“‘Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall’!!!” Lin Xiu stared at this scene stubbornly, without any fear in his eyes.

He bellowed angrily and the spear he was holding also attacked Zhuo Qixing!

With the swing of the spear, a long white light was produced which looked like the milky way as he attacked.

“Courting death!!!”

Due to the injury just now, he has become extremely enraged.

Since when did he ever get injured and even bled!

Most importantly, it was Lin Xiu who caused all this! He couldn’t tolerate it at all.

With so many students from the Sacred Region Academy watching, it was embarrassing for him!

Boom——

Lin Xiu’s and Zhuo Qixing’s skils collided and a very loud noise resounded in an instant.

The ground around was shaken instantly at this moment.

There were a lot of cracks on the ground!

What a strong power!

Seeing this scene, the surrounding Sacred Region Academy students were shocked.

Especially Nan Zhengjun, he never thought that Lin Xiu who was in his class would have such a strong power.

He could actually force Zhuo Qixing, who was practically the top freshman, to this degree.

This was really beyond his expectation.

“Damn!!!” Zhuo Qixing’s eyes were full of murderous intent at this time and the skill of Lin Xiu was almost comparable to his skill.

If Lin Xiu’s source strength wasn’t sufficient, he would be seriously injured by the impact of that skill.

At this time, he could feel that his right hand, which was holding the long sword, getting numb. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Hu hu——

Lin Xiu, who was across Zhuo Qixing, was holding a spear in his right hand and he pushed his spear against the ground to stabilize his body.

Lin Xiu felt his body aching.

The power that Zhuo Qixing just exuded was already very close to the power of a rank 6 warrior.

He was too powerful and terrifying.

Now that ‘Fury’ couldn’t be used, it was too difficult to deal with Zhuo Qixing.

He didn’t have a choice; if he waited for Zhuo Qixing to continue to attack, he might really lose!

With this thought, Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and his legs burst forth with strength as he charged out like an arrow!

“‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!”

The spear shot out like a dragon, giving off spots of cold light.

“Hng! Do you think I will be tricked again!?” Zhuo Qixing had already seen through Lin Xiu’s trick.

Although this move could make dozens of spears appear in a short moment and looked terrifying, as long as he avoided the tip of the spear and waited for Lin Xiu’s skill to be over, Zhuo Qixing could counterattack!

Go to hell!

At this time, Zhuo Qixing moved his body and dodged the dozens of spears. Then, taking advantage of this gap, he rushed out at this moment!

The long sword was about to take Lin Xiu’s head!

Bang–

The long sword moved very quickly. At this moment, it pierced through Lin Xiu’s neck!

“Lin Xiu!!!” Seeing this scene, Zhang Yin and others shouted.

Luo Yue’s gaze also changed slightly but she quickly calmed down. No, it was impossible.

There was an uproar at this moment – Zhuo Qixing actually pierced through Lin Xiu’s neck!

“Haha, he is finally dead!” Tian Zixia saw this scene and burst into laughter.

She really hated Lin Xiu. At this moment, seeing Lin Xiu had his neck pierced through, he would definitely die. How could she not be pleased?

“No, he is not dead.” Ouyang Hang also thought that Lin Xiu had already died at first.

But in the next moment, he felt a strong aura.

No, there seemed to be two auras over there…?

What is going on?

Bang——

Just when Zhuo Qixing thought that Lin Xiu’s neck had been pierced through by his long sword, he saw Lin Xiu disappear like a smoke bomb exploded!

What happened!?

While he was in a state of shock, he felt the gust of wind behind him.

His eyes widened suddenly and he directly attacked behind with his long sword!

He suddenly realized Lin Xiu was attacking him with a spear!

Zhuo Qixing’s long sword was very precise. In the next moment, force burst out of his right arm and the long sword in his hand cut Lin Xiu’s body in two!

But the same strange thing happened. Lin Xiu’s body once again disappeared!

What kind of skill was this!?

Tian Zixia, who originally thought Lin Xiu was killed by Zhuo Qixing, was shocked at this time.

Not only Tian Zixia, but the entire Sacred Region Academy, even the teachers such as Nan Zhengjun, and Dean Baili were shocked.

They all hadn’t seen an amazing skill like that before!

“Goodbye!”
