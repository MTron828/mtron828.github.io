Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

As the source strength in Lin Xiu’s body erupted, at this moment, the surrounding wind began to surge.

The dust that started on the ground began to fly up.

“He seems to be very strong too...” Yang Jian, who was hiding nearby and watching this scene, couldn’t help but say secretly at this time.

He now understood how stupid he was today.

Now he felt good to be alive.

“Come on.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and said to the middle-aged man.

“Then you...be careful!”

Swoosh—

Just like before, the middle-aged man’s figure disappeared instantly and he couldn’t see him at all.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s figure also disappeared instantly!

Bang bang bang- Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The sound of fighting continued to sound. Looking closely, in the middle of the front side, the two were like two shadows, fighting.

Nobody could tell them apart!

What a fast speed!

Qu Tingting was shocked at this time. She knew that Lin Xiu was very strong, but she never thought that Lin Xiu would be so strong!

He could actually fight against the leader of the Elders Execution Institution!

Not only Qu Tingting was shocked, but even the rest of the execution team members were surprised.

A student who can fight with the leader of the execution team was really a very shocking thing.

boom–

At this moment, a huge sound rang out and they saw a body being torn apart in an instant!

Who is it!?

The people standing around all stared straight, this battle was really too thrilling.

“Humph!”

At the same time, the figure of the middle-aged man also appeared.

Without a doubt, it was Lin Xiu who was torn apart!

“He’s dead!” Yang Jian was startled when he saw this scene.

Lin Xiu was so powerful yet he still got killed by the leader of the Elders Execution Institution.

This meant that the strength of the leader of the Elders Execution Institution was indeed too terrifying.

“Wrong!”

Qu Tingting originally thought that Lin Xiu was dead, but the next moment, she seemed to feel something and exclaimed.

The middle-aged man ignored Lin Xiu, who was ‘torn apart’ by his attack.

Instead, his eyes swept around and he rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Exposed!?

Lin Xiu looked at the middle-aged man rushing towards him and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

The battle just now seemed to be evenly matched but only Lin Xiu knew that he was at a disadvantage.

And at the critical moment, he used ‘Mirror Clone’ to dodge his attack.

Sweeping his eyes to the front, he has already appeared in front of him!

“Is this the third move?”

Lin Xiu spoke plainly to him.

The middle-aged man ignored Lin Xiu’s words and attacked Lin Xiu directly!

Boom boom boom —

With a bright red flame on his fist, he waved at Lin Xiu’s body, making a loud noise after another.

It was as if the surrounding was about to be smashed by his fist.

Boom–

In the next moment, Lin Xiu, who seemed to have no time to dodge, instantly exploded!

The surrounding warriors exclaimed in surprise.

This scene was really too terrifying, Lin Xiu’s head actually exploded by a punch!

But they found that the leader did not stop what he was doing and rushed to the other side in an instant!

Lin Xiu is still alive?!

Thinking of what just happened, these people had the same thought.

Sure enough, just as they thought, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared on the other side again!

“Stop!!!”

Looking at Lin Xiu’s figure, the middle-aged man was obviously provoked by Lin Xiu.

He was the dignified leader of the execution team yet he has been tricked by Lin Xiu’s strange skills over and over again. How could he not be angry?

His fists were opened and a lot of flames burst out in his hands.

Then at the next moment, the flames in these two hands instantly turned into two fire dragons, charging towards Lin Xiu at an extremely fast speed!

The look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed, there was no way to dodge this time!

There is no way!

‘Sphere’!!!

At this critical moment, the ‘Sphere’ on Lin Xiu’s body unfolded in an instant.

Boom–

The two fire dragons impacted Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ and instantly formed a huge flame and exploded!

This terrifying explosion caused a strong gust of wind to instantly engulf the surroundings.

The sand was blown up, as if a terrifying sandstorm had formed.

At this time, these warriors all subconsciously blocked their eyes with their arms.

After a while, as the strong wind stopped, everyone’s eyes turned to the front.

The thick dust raised around them blocked everyone’s vision.

Did he... resist the attack of the law enforcement team captain?

Everyone held their breath, still staring at the other side.

As the dense dust slowly dissipated, Qu Tingting’s eyes widened.

Because at this time, it was obvious that Lin Xiu’s fist and the middle-aged man’s fist smashed together and both of them kept this thing motionless.

“Is this the fourth move?” Lin Xiu looked at the middle-aged man in front of him and said aloud.

As soon as the words came out, a mouthful of blood spat out from Lin Xiu’s mouth.

His body shook slightly but he still forcibly kept himself from falling down.

“Very good.” The middle-aged man said lightly, his body became strong and at this time, he also slowly began to become thinner.

He was still full of shock now.

Just now, the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded completely blocked the impact of the two fire dragons he unleashed.

Logically speaking, this was his third move, but he was already flooded with the desire to fight and couldn’t stop.

When the last punch hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, Lin Xiu actually retracted the ‘Sphere’, then threw a hot and powerful punch against his fist.

Even the middle-aged man couldn’t help but be surprised by that powerful force.

“You won.” The middle-aged man said to Lin Xiu, then walked to the other side without looking back.

“Dispose of the corpses, let’s go.” As soon as he finished speaking, the people from the team reacted quickly, then disposed of the bodies of Murong and others and left.

Pff—

Lin Xiu spat out a mouthful of blood again at this time and he finally couldn’t hang on anymore and sat on the ground.

Sure enough, he was indeed a rank 8 warrior, he was really too powerful and this middle-aged man was not an ordinary rank 8, he was obviously someone who was close to rank 9.

Just now, if he really wanted to kill Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu would really die.
