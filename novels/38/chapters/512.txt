Chapter 513: The Truth!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Chen Liang lit a cigarette, took a long drag, stared in the distance, then said, “They were killed.”

Hearing Chen Liang’s words, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed, as if an uncontrollable anger burst out.

But Lin Xiu took a deep breath and asked, “Who killed them.”

Lin Xiu looked at Lin Xiu with his eyes filled with infinite killing intent.

If it was only a car accident, forget it. But after Lin Xiu knew the truth, of course, he wouldn’t just leave it.

If there is a grudge, it must be avenged!

“The Young Master of the Jiang Family, Jiang Feng.” Chen Liang was silent for a while, then said aloud.

“I was as old as you back then. After they came to Bai Di City, my father, let me take them to tour around…”

When he said this, Chen Liang’s body trembled and his eyes showed fear.

But Jiang Feng had powerful warriors around him, the entire Baidi City couldn’t afford to offend him, let alone Xingyao City.

That day, Jiang Feng and others were going to Xingyao City to play games.

Originally, Chen Liang was still curious about what games were available in Xingyao City, but after he got there, something happened that left a shadow in him.

“They were hunting for ordinary people.” Chen Liang seemed to think of something, then said with a trembling body.

Lin Xiu heard Chen Liang’s words, his hands were already squeezed tight and his knuckles were cracking.

“You mean, they use hunting as a game?” Lin Xiu forcibly suppressed his anger and said aloud.

“That’s right…” Chen Liang looked at Lin Xiu at this time and his body trembled.

At this time, he was really afraid that Lin Xiu would blow his head with a fist.

“Beast!” Lin Xiu yelled, then hit the steel pipe in front with a punch, directly smashing and creating a hole.

“Then, where is the Jiang family.” Lin Xiu said coldly.

Chen Liang had been frightened by Lin Xiu’s punch and his legs became weak.

“Not in Baidi City…” Chen Liang said with a trembling voice.

“Where!” Lin Xiu grabbed him by the collar and raised him with one hand and said.

“Sky City! My father said that they are from Sky City!” Chen Liang said aloud.

He was also afraid of death.

Sky City!?

No wonder, they actually dared to kill with total disregard for people’s lives!

Thinking of this, the blood in Lin Xiu’s whole body boiled, wishing to directly enter Jiang’s house and kill them all.

“Do you remember how many people participated in this incident?” Lin Xiu put Chen Liang back on the ground and said in a cold voice.

“I remember, but…”

“Type out all their names for me.” Lin Xiu ignored his words, took out his mobile phone and handed it to Chen Liang.

“If they knew that I ratted on them, I would die…” Chen Liang was shaking, not daring to pick up Lin Xiu’s phone.

“If you don’t tell me now, I will go down and kill all of your Chen family.” Lin Xiu’s eyes were full of killing intent.

Chen Liang stared into Lin Xiu’s eyes and his body trembled. He knew that Lin Xiu was telling the truth and he would really slaughter all the members of the Chen family.

“I’ll do it…” Chen Liang took Lin Xiu’s phone with trembling hands, then typed in the names one by one.

From the look in Chen Liang’s eyes just now, Lin Xiu understood that what he was telling was the truth, not a lie.

“Done.” After Chen Liang entered the names one by one, he handed the phone back to Lin Xiu.

In addition to Jiang Feng’s bodyguards, there were also a few younger generation of the family involved. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Looking at the names of those people displayed on the phone, Lin Xiu’s body tensed up.

When he goes to Sky City, these people will be killed!

“Can I go now…” Chen Liang said with a trembling body at this time.

“Are you involved?” Lin Xiu said, looking at Chen Liang.

“I didn’t! Absolutely not!” Chen Liang said quickly, thinking of what happened then, it was still a big shock to him, after all, he was still a teenager back then!

“Get lost!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Chen Liang immediately left the place.

This was such a coincidence. He actually met the son of a couple who was hunted.

And Lin Xiu’s strength was quite impressive.

“Jiang Family…” Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and spat out two words.

But at this moment, a rumbling sound rang, causing Lin Xiu to frown.

Taking a closer look, in the surrounding sky, there were quite a few aircrafts flying.

And there were turrets on the aircraft, all aimed at Lin Xiu below.

One after another Union soldier jumped directly from the aircraft.

It was only ten seconds, but within this time, a large number of soldiers with laser guns had appeared on this wide rooftop.

The laser guns were all aimed at Lin Xiu.

“Lin Xiu, don’t resist.” And at this time, a figure stepped forward, looking at Lin Xiu and said.

Bai Di City Police Chief, Lui Wei.

“Catching me again?” Lin Xiu stared at him, then said faintly.

“You killed hundreds of people in the Zhao family, the evidence is conclusive.” Lui Wei had a headache looking at Lin Xiu. He didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would run to the Zhao family to disturb them and he saw the ground on the Zhao family’s side – the large number of corpses shocked Lui Wei.

“Self-defense,” Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Lin, you killed a hundred people from my Zhao family, go to hell!” As soon as Lin Xiu spoke, a man walked out of the crowd, holding a three-foot long sword and charged to Lin Xiu.

“Zhao Feng, stop!” Lui Wei’s eyes suddenly changed when he saw this scene.

Zhao Feng was the leader of these special forces. He was a rank 5 warrior and was good at using swords.

However, according to the federal political law, Lin Xiu was to be dealt with by the law. If Zhao Feng does this, it is obviously not in compliance with the rules!

Dang–

Lin Xiu had already suppressed a wave of anger because of the truth he had just learned. At this time, watching Zhao Feng slashing over with a sword and wanting his own life, Lin Xiu was furious. He waved the spear in his hand and sent the long sword flying!

And before Zhao Feng could react, Lin Xiu lifted his foot and stepped on him to the ground. The spear in his hand was about to pierce through Zhao Feng’s head!
