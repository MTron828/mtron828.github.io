Chapter 693 Seventh on the Tianjiao List – Lu Jiang!

As he jumped onto the competition stage, there was a burst of cheers around him.

“Hey, the battle seems to have started over there.”

At the same time, Lei Tong and others had already arrived at the seats on the other side.

He looked at the competition platform in the middle, and he could clearly see Lin Xiu’s figure on platform 1.

“That’s platform number one. Is Brother Lin trying to compete for the top spot on the Tianjiao list?”

Chen Lan’s eyes widened when she saw this scene, her eyes filled with disbelief.

“The top spot of the Tianjiao list?”

Hearing Chen Lan’s words, Lei Tong was also startled. “This competition is also the re-ranking of the top ten in the Tianjiao list.”

Chen Lan knew that Lei Tong didn’t know much about the matter here, so he explained it to him at this time.

“I see.”

After listening to Chen Lan’s next statement, Lei Tong also nodded.

“In that case, will Lin Xiu be in danger?”

“There will be great danger.”

The look in Chen Lan’s eyes became more cautious.

“I don’t know where the kid came from, just get ready to be killed by me at this competition stage.”

The strong man who just jumped up, holding the sword in his hand, pointed at Lin Xiu and sneered.

According to the rules of this tournament, even if you kill someone on the stage, there will be no punishment.

“One second.”

Lin Xiu watched this man stand up, then glanced at him, and said indifferently.

“Crazy!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the burly man obviously knew that he was insulted. At this time, he roared angrily, then moved his body, held the sword in his hand, and slashed directly at Lin Xiu’s body! It seemed that the whole person’s body is bursting with extremely powerful strength, which was very imposing.

But the moment he came into contact with Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu didn’t use the Dark Edge spear at all. With a punch with his left hand, he directly knocked him out!

Boom–

With a dull sound, the man slammed into the ground behind him heavily.

The burly man opened his eyes wide and spit out a mouthful of blood from his mouth. The severe pain made him unable to get up for a while.

“Huh? Interesting, he could also punch?”

Qian Jin watched the scene just now from not far away. Although Lin Xiu’s punch was very ordinary, Qian Jin could see that the power contained in Lin Xiu’s punch directly shattered the man’s bones.

“Young Master Qian, is this person really an Earthling?” A warrior stood in front of Qian Jin and said aloud.

“Well, he said so, it shouldn’t be wrong.”

Qian Jin thought for a while, then nodded.

“Is there anyone else?”

Lin Xiu glanced at the warriors below, and said lightly.

With the Analytic eye, Lin Xiu could clearly grasp all the strengths of the surrounding warriors.

“Crazy!”

Lin Xiu’s words sounded too arrogant in their ears, and in the next moment, warriors kept jumping up to the stage.

However, the strength of these warriors was all rank 7 or 8.

Lin Xiu defeated these people very easily.

On the other side of the competition stage, more and more warriors have gathered.

After all, not all warriors wanted to set foot on the head stage.

“A mere low-level pariah, you guys can’t deal with him? Useless.”

At this moment, a man leaped directly onto the competition stage.

This man looked quite young, the weapon in his hand was a sword, and his sharp eyes stared at Lin Xiu, who was also standing on the stage.

When Lin Xiu saw this person appear, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

Because Lin Xiu could clearly feel that this person’s strength seemed to be a bit strong.

“Lu Jiang! It’s Lu Jiang!”

“This kid is so dead!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

After the man stepped onto the stage, the surrounding crowd seemed to be boiling.

Just now, these people had been pissed off by Lin Xiu. Nobody could deal with Lin Xiu at all on this competition stage. It really angered these people from Marqi planet.

Because in their opinion, people with black pupils were all ‘pariahs’.

Isn’t it the greatest shame to be defeated by the ‘pariahs’!

“Lu Jiang? Who is that?”

Lei Tong was not far from Lin Xiu’s side. Hearing the words of the surrounding warriors, Lei Tong said to Chen Lan curiously.

“He’s 7th on the Tianjiao list and has strength of a rank 9 warrior.”

Chen Lan’s face became nasty.

Although Lin Xiu was very strong, but this man was a strong person on the Tianjiao list after all, and a rank 9.

“I feel that Brother Lin should be able to defeat him.”

Lei Tong said confidently at this time.

“You said that person can defeat Lu Jiang? Stop joking!” The audience sitting behind Lei Tong immediately burst into laughter as if they had heard the funniest joke. “What’s so funny! When Brother Lin was on Earth, he won the championship of the warrior competition in our region!” Hearing the laughter of the people behind him, Lei Tong suddenly became a little angry, turned around and stared at the people behind him.

“Earth? You’re from that indigenous planet? The competition there is just a joke.”

Those people laughed even more.

They had already decided that Lin Xiu, who was so arrogant just now, would definitely be beaten down by Lu Jiang.

“You...”

Lei Tong just wanted to say that Lin Xiu had killed a rank 9 warrior, but at the same time, the battle on the stage had already begun!

After Lu Jiang’s movement was unfolded, like phantoms, he instantly rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu, who had been standing on the same spot just now, was now holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand and moving!

Dang dangThe weapons of the two collided, and in the next moment, there was a loud metal collision sound.

“Interesting, no wonder you have the guts to stand on this stage.”

During the battle between Lu Jiang and Lin Xiu, he could clearly feel the strength of Lin Xiu, and he said with a sneer. “Are you on the Tianlong City Tianjiao list?”

Lin Xiu said lightly while dodging his attack.

At the next moment, he seized the opportunity and stabbed Lu Jiang directly with the spear in his hand.

Dang–

Lu Jiang’s reaction ability was also very swift. With a wave of the long sword in his hand, he directly blocked the attack of the spear with the body of the sword.

“You know about the Tianjiao list?”

Lu Jiang sneered.

“Starting today, your name will no longer be on the Tianjiao list.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

As soon as the words fell, the source strength of the whole body was mobilized!

Although Lin Xiu has not yet fully reached the ninth rank, the power that burst out was not inferior to the ninth rank!
