1343 The Flame of Chaos

Then, there was another sound that came from beside him.

“Yes.”

Lin Xiu turned and saw that it was Xiao Qingchen.

“Your flames may be powerful but they are no match for my divine spirit.”

Xiao Qingchen continued.

Lin Xiu frowned but before he could say a word, Xiao Qingchen quickly explained himself, “Don’t worry. I’m not here to challenge you. I just wanted to ask…..

“Would you like to get a more powerful flame?”

Xiao Qingchen stared into Lin Xiu’s eyes.

“Do you know any?”

Lin Xiu was a little stunned and asked subconsciously.

That’s right. Ever since he came to the Warrior God Realm, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the Hellfire that he had was not enough to fight the warrior gods here.

He would have to find one that was even more powerful.

“Of course. I know that there is one that most warrior gods are afraid of. It is even more powerful than mine.”

Xiao Qingchen nodded his head.

“What flame is it?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

He was getting interested in what Xiao Qingchen had to say.

“Flame of Chaos.”

Xiao Qingchen spoke in a low tone.

“Do not touch those.”

Riyan God Lord, who has a good ear, overheard what Xiao Qingchn said and gave him a cold glare.

“Why?”

Lin Xiu quickly asked for an explanation.

With that, Riyan God Lord stretched out his left hand.

He rolled up his sleeves and they finally saw his arm that was hidden inside his sleeves.

Lin Xiu and Xiao Qingchen were both stunned.

This was because there were multiple huge burn marks on his arm and they looked terrifying.

Boom – –

Plus, at that moment, there were tiny flames that appeared on his palm.

“This is the Flame of Chaos that you’ve been talking about. It is also known as Giant Gold Flame.”

It was a tiny gold flame but Lin Xiu could feel the tremendous amount of energy coming from it.

The entire space suddenly felt much hotter than before.

It was getting scorching hot and even Lin Xiu felt thirsty.

Xiu – –

Then, the flame in his palm disappeared.

“God Lord, did you absorb the Flame of Chaos?”

Xiao Qingchen couldn’t even breathe properly now.

The Flame of Chaos was the most terrifying flame there was on the Warrior God Realm.

They are only found at the Land of Chaos. It was difficult to find them and even if it was found, it would be incredibly difficult to cultivate it.

“This isn’t the real Flame of Chaos.”

Riyan God Lord shook his head.

“These are the outermost layers of the Flame of Chaos. I merely absorbed a little bit of it and my entire arm suffered through 99 days of being burnt.”

“I can never get rid of the scars on my arm and whenever I use these flames, it would affect my body as well.”

Then, Riyan God Lord had a stern look on his face.

“If you’re going to only absorb those from the edges, that won’t be necessary. If you’re planning on absorbing the core of it, I can tell you to stop daydreaming about it.”

“There have been God Kings who tried but they ended up being ashes left on the ground.”

Riyan God Lord stared at Lin Xiu and warned him about it.

This was because he saw the excitement in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

It was similar to the ones that he had.

“Fine.”

Lin Xiu helplessly shrugged his shoulders. Then, he turned to Xiao Qingchen and said, “You! You wanted me dead!”

Xiao Qingchen didn’t know what to say.

The Flame of Chaos was indeed powerful but even if Lin Xiu was the one who went there, he would definitely die.

“Well, can we leave now?”

...

Lin Xiu asked Riyan God Lord for his permission to leave.

“En. Once you get down from the stairs, turn left and there will be a transportation array and it will send you back to your city.”

Riyan God Lord pointed the exit to them.

Lin Xiu stretched his back and left.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng bidded goodbye as well before leaving.

When they got to the stairs, the horrifying pressure had disappeared.

It might only be there as a trial to those who try to get up the stairs.

“Where is the flame of chaos?”

Lin Xiu asked Xiao Qingchen as they were walking down the stairs.

“You really want to find it?” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Xiao Qingchen was shocked to hear what Lin Xiu was asking.

...

“Just trying to learn more about it.”

Lin Xiu smiled in return.

“The Flame of Chaos is at the Land of Chaos but that is a dangerous place.”

Xiao Qingchen spoke in a soft voice.

“You should be able to find some of the information about it on the internet.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“But… if you really want something more powerful, I would recommend you to go for the Netherworld Flame.”

Xiao Qingchen hesitated for a moment before recommending something else.

“Netherworld flame?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows.

“You can look it up on the internet. I know where to find it. If you’re interested, you can contact me.”

Xiao Qingchen then passed a name card to Lin Xiu.

His name and contact information were all on the card.

This fella carries his name card around?

Lin Xiu wanted to laugh but he still kept the card.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng left immediately while Lin Xiu continued walking forward.

This was because he saw Baili Haoling and Lei Chong who were both cultivating.

Rollie and Little Bai already noticed Lin Xiu who was walking towards them and quickly flew to his side.

They immediately jumped into his arms.

Lin Xiu chuckled and gently patted their heads before placing them on his shoulder.

“Lin Xiu, you’re done?”

Baili Haoling felt something odd and opened her eyes immediately.

That’s when she saw Lin Xiu standing in front of her.

Plus, she could also clearly feel that there was something different with Lin Xiu.

However, she couldn’t put them clearly into words.

It was just that he was now even more powerful than before.

“City lord!”

Lei Chong woke up as well and he was delighted to see Lin Xiu.

“Hmm? You’re about to break through?”

Lin Xiu looked at Lei Chong and could clearly feel that Lei Chong was already at the brim of it!

“Yes!”

Lei Chong was trying to suppress the excitement inside him.

He was about to be a warrior god! This was something that he had never imagined before.

He was improving so quickly as if he was on a rocket.

Lin Xiu felt comforted as well.

The Warrior God Realm was indeed rich and even a pig would be able to become a god here.

In comparison to the world before, the poor will only become poorer while the rich become richer. It would be difficult for those poor peasants to become rich overnight.

This was what it meant as class solidification.
