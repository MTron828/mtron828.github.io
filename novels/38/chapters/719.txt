Chapter 720 Metal Giant

“Did you hear some strange noises?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said aloud.

“What’s that sound?”.

Qian Jin was startled for a moment, then said subconsciously.

He calmed down and listened intently to the sounds around him other than fighting.

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

“It seems like… the sound of something turning?”

“Careful!”

Just as Qian Jin’s words fell, Jiang Jun seemed to have discovered something and said to Huangji over there.

Huangji just killed a warrior and obtained a purple gold skill card.

At this time, when he heard Jiang Jun’s voice, he immediately came back to his senses.

Looking up, a huge palm was coming his way!

The pupils in Huangji’s eyes shrank suddenly, his figure flashed and he managed to avoid it.

After all, he was a peak master warrior-level warrior and his reaction speed was very fast.

Boom

And that giant hand directly attacked the ground and suddenly a huge sound erupted.

Taking a closer look, the one attacking turned out to be the statue!

“The statue… is moving!”

At this time, the surrounding warriors had already discovered this scene and their faces were full of shock.

Clap clap

And at this time, the surrounding statues all started to move,

The rocks on the statues were now starting to fall off.

Exposing those original metal bodies.

These giants seemed to be wearing black armor and under some light, they reflected the slightest rays of light.

“Is it an intelligent robot?”

Lin Xiu frowned slightly at this time.

And at this time, these huge metal giants began to wave their huge fists and attacked the surrounding warriors.

Every time they attacked, the surrounding ground shook violently.

“Run!”

At this time, Jiang Jun’s expression changed as well and he said quickly.

“Don’t run.”

But as soon as he finished speaking, Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

“Do you know that it is very dangerous here and the power of these metal giants is beyond your imagination!”

Jiang Jun seemed to have experienced something and roared at Lin Xiu at this time.

As if Lin Xiu was someone who just talked nonsense when he didn’t know anything.

“No, we will not be in danger.”

Lin Xiu calmly shook his head, then pointed to the front and said, “Have you noticed that these metal giants will only attack those who have won the Purple Gold skill Card.”

After hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Jiang Jun was stunned for a moment. He turned to look behind him and found that it was indeed the case. It seemed that these metal giants had been given some kind of order. At this time, they would only attack those who have won the Purple Gold skill Card.

“Damn!”

The old man Huangji also had a Purple Gold skill Card, so at this time one of the metal giants was chasing him.

They chased after him closely and the old man was in a tight spot.

And they didn’t know what material this metal giant was made of but the black metal armor on the surface was very hard.

Even if these master warrior-level warriors attacked, they would not be able to destroy them at all.

“We’ll stay here and appreciate the battles of some master warrior-level powerhouses?”

Lin Xiu smiled, then sat directly on the rocky ground, watching the battles not far away.

The rest of the warriors also came to their senses, knowing that these metal giants would not attack them, but would attack those who possessed the Purple Gold skill Card.

Some ill-intentioned warriors were also eyeing them at this time.

After they waited for those master warrior-level powerhouses to be tortured by those metal giants, they might be able to snatch those purple-gold skill cards.

Boom boom boom —

As they fought, the ground shook more and more frequently at this time.

There were also many pits on the ground because of the battle.

“Haha, go to hell!”

A warrior who seemed to be relatively powerful directly broke through the defense of a metal giant at this time and then continued to attack, directly blasting the metal giant’s head.

As its head exploded, there seemed to be some kind of explosion inside the metal giant’s body and the entire huge body fell to the ground.

“This is mine!”

But just after the warrior killed the metal giant, a master warrior-level warrior at the back attacked him with a weapon.

Because the battle with the metal giant just now consumed too much strength, his strength also dropped a lot at this time.

Soon, these people continued to fight.

To Lin Xiu’s surprise, the old man Huangji finally knew the weakness of these metal giants. After killing the metal giants who were chasing him, no one came to attack him.

Time passed quickly and these ten purple-gold-level skill cards were also captured by various warriors.

“Are you not interested in this purple gold skill card?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Qian Jin looked at Lin Xiu sitting cross-legged on the ground. Just watching those people’s battles, Lin Xiu didn’t seem to want to participate at all, so he couldn’t help asking out of curiosity.

In his impression, Lin Xiu was not such a person, he should be very interested in things.

“I’m a little interested.” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

But in the next moment, Lin Xiu spread his hands helplessly and said, “But these people are too powerful, I can’t deal with them.” Lin Xiu was the one who said it but he had good eyesight and had already seen that these purple gold skill cards had nothing to do with spear art.

“Is it.”

Qian Jin looked in disbelief.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu stood up and smiled while holding the Dark Edge spear.

“Go?”

Qian Jin was startled, as if he still hadn’t come to his senses.

Boom boom boom —

At this moment, there was a sound from the wall in front of him.

Soon, it could be clearly seen that the wall was slowly cracking, revealing a new path.

“It turns out there really somewhere to go.”

Looking at this scene, Qian Jin couldn’t help but say something.

“Is Mr. Huang all right?” Jiang Jun looked at Huangji who was a little out of breath and said.

He also consumed a lot of power in the battle with the metal giant just now.

“He’s okay, let’s move on.”

Huangji shook his head, looking at the new road that appeared in front of his eyes, with a fiery look in his eyes.

There was a Purple Gold skill Card here, so if they kept going, would there be something better?

The rest of the warriors also had the same thought and they all started to walk towards the new wide passage.

This passage was very long and it seemed that there was no end in sight.

“Let’s walk at the back.”

Walking on this passage, Jiang Jun looked around and reminded.
