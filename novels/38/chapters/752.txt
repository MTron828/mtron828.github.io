Chapter 753: Predators

Lin Xiu was shocked when he saw what was happening.

In that situation, Liu Pan’s skills were not deteriorating, they were getting stronger instead. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Liu Pan, who was already a top rank 9 warrior, had the strength of a master warrior.

As for the man who was dressed in a black cape, wanting to tease the rest of them, started looking afraid.

Boom – –

Before he could react, his arms were sliced by Liu Pan’s double-bladed axe and there was blood spilled everywhere.

The man didn’t even have time to move when Liu Pan swung his axe again.

Within seconds, the man dressed in a black cape was already covered in blood as he was continuously slashed by Liu Pan.

Liu Pan did not stop and continued with his attack like a mad man.

“HEHE...I am about to ruin you beautiful faces...”

/

The other man that was attacking Qian Ling and An Qi, said to both the girls with a twisted expression on his face.

An Qi and Qian Ling were trying to catch their breaths as the man in the balck cape was too powerful.

Even if they attacked him together, they still weren’t good enough to fight him.

Plus, the other party was teasing them. Instead of killing them, he was slowly hurting them and cutting them with a peculiar looking ancient weapon that looked like a billhook.

Blood slowly sipped out of their wounds and their combat suits were slowly turning red as well.

If they continued fighting in this manner, even without a fatal injury, they would have died from losing too much blood.

“Hhehehehehe.....”

The man had a perverted look on his face as he slowly walked towards An Qi and Qian Ling.

Suddenly, he felt that something was right as he narrowed his eyes and tried to dodge it.

Boom – –

Even when he tried to dodge the attack, Lin Xiu’s spear that came from behind him still pierced through his shoulder.

“You...”

The man widened his eyes in surprise as he slowly turned around.

That’s when he saw that it was Lin Xiu who attacked him from the back.

“Hu...hu.....” An Qi and Qian Ling finally had the chance to catch their breath.

“Do you.....even know....who you’re fighting?”

The man looked at Lin Xiu and showed a terrifying smile.

Lin Xiu’s abilities were stronger than he could have imagined. The spear was so quick that he didn’t even have the chance to unleash his ‘Yuan’.

“We are the Predators...”

“Bye.”

Lin Xiu wasn’t interested in what he had to say. He pulled out the spear and then thursted it again into the man!

“You...”

The spear that was thrusted forward splitted into hundreds of spears and within a blink of an eye, there were multiple bloody holes that appeared on the man’s head.

The final blow immediately caused the man’s head to explode.

There was fresh, bright, red blood all over the ground.

“Are you alright?”

An Qi and Qian Ling finally felt relieved and they fell onto the ground.

“We’re....fine.”

Both of them said with great effort.

“We....we need to mend our wounds.”

An Qi and Qian Ling blushed as they told Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment before awkwardly turning around and looking in the opposite direction.

There were too many wounds all over their body and most probably, they would have to remove their combat suits to heal them.

They looked as if they were covered in blood but there wasn’t a single fatal wound on their body.

They only needed to mend the wounds with the special healing potion.

As Lin Xiu looked in the opposite direction, he noticed that Liu Pan was still striking his axe towards one of the man’s bodies that was on the ground. Liu Pan’s eyes were still bloody red.

The man’s body had now been chopped into a meat patty but Liu Pan was still going at it, without stopping at all.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but feel that something wasn’t right with him.

“He’s already dead!”

Lin Xiu walked towards him and grabbed onto Liu Pan’s arm as he screamed into his ears.

After being screamed at by his boss, Liu Pan’s body shook and he suddenly came back to his senses.

His eyes that were blood red had now returned to its original colour.

Boom – –

Then, Liu Pan fell to the ground with an empty look in his eyes.

“I’m sorry, Brother Lin.”

Liu Pan took a deep breath before apologising to Lin Xiu.

“Who are they?”

Lin Xiu sat on the ground as well as he asked Liu Pan.

This was because Lin Xiu could feel that Liu Pan had already recognised these men before fighting them.

“These men....are known as the ‘Predators’.”

“They are a terrifying group of men who are known for robbing and killing warriors hunting for evolved beasts in these forests.”

“The way that they kill is extremely cruel.....”

“They are the ones.....who killed my parents.”

Liu Pan gritted his teeth as he explained it to Lin Xiu. His entire body was now covered with a terrifying murderous aura.

“We just killed one of their men. If I’m not wrong, they will be sending other men to kill us later.”

“You’re planning to kill them all?”

Lin Xiu asked flatly.

“Yes.”

As Liu Pan answered Lin Xiu, there was a dark shade of red in his eyes.

Lin Xiu was now sure that for people like Liu Pan, their eyes would turn red whenever they get excited or angry.

They would also get stronger with each fight.

This was just like the crazy warriors that you see in the video games...

“But...do you think that with your current state, you would be able to defeat them?”

Lin Xiu asked bluntly.

Liu Pan was stunned after hearing Lin Xiu’s question. His eyes that were red earlier turned back to their original state.

“Don’t look at me. This is your issue. If you want revenge, you would have to do it on your own.”

Lin Xiu noticed that Liu Pan was staring at him and he quickly told him the truth.

“Mend your injuries and let’s get going.”

“Didn’t you say that you wanted to kill the Raging Flame Lion? Maybe we will be able to find something interesting there.”

Lin Xiu continued speaking to Liu Pan.

“En.”

Liu Pan agreed with the plan as well and picked up the backpack that he left on the ground.

Then, he took out some healing potions and started mending his wounds.

The healing potions of Marqi Planet were much more effective than the one they had back on earth.

As Liu Pan poured the healing potion on to his wounds, it was indeed painful. Although he was in a lot of pain, the wounds all over his body were already healing very quickly.

Soon, most of them have already started closing and there were scabs formed.

However, because of the intense pain, Liu Pan’s face had turned ghastly pale.

As for the forest around them, there was a raging fire around them because of the ‘Flaming Birds’ that Lin Xiu had released.

However, the fire only lasted for a while and most of it had already started to die down.

The trees around them must have had some peculiar features which makes it less flammable.

“Quick. Let’s go.”
