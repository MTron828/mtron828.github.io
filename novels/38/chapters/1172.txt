1173 Game Over

Zhao Laosan and Ye Yu stared at Lin Xiu while watching the divine mark Barrier disappear.

If Lin Xiu made a move at this time, they will kill Lin Xiu directly.

But at this time, after Lin Xiu cracked the divine mark barrier, he did not continue to move forward, but stood in place.

Zhao Laosan and Ye Yu loosened their grip on their weapons a little at this time.

!!

“Glad you know your place.”

Seeing this scene, Ye Yu sneered and walked straight ahead.

Zhao Laosan also stepped forward at this time.

They walked to the statue of Bai Lingxian and looked at the scroll in his hand with greed in their eyes.

Of course they want this secret scroll, but now they didn’t dare to get it directly.

Because just now, the divine marker was directly killed by the giant with divine marks.

“Can this divine mark be deciphered?”

Ye Yu glanced at Lin Xiu, then said lightly.

If the divine mark giant hadn’t been cracked, they wouldn’t dare to go forward to get the secret scroll.

“It should be possible, but I need time.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Give you time, help me crack it first.”

Zhao Laosan said coldly.

As long as it can be broken, that’s fine.

“If you dare to play any tricks, you will die.”

Ye Yu added at this time.

Lin Xiu didn’t say anything. At this time, he walked directly in front of the divine mark giant, then touched it.

As Lin Xiu stretched out his hand and touched it, the giant divine mark didn’t even move at all.

This kid, can he really crack it…

Ye Yu secretly thought in his heart.

After all, the person just now was also a Divine Marker and his strength did not seem to be weak.

But he was smashed into meat sauce by this divine mark giant.

At this moment, Lin Xiu was standing there, his eyes closed.

Motionless, like a statue.

Lin Xiu clearly felt that this giant divine mark contained extremely strong power.

This divine mark was different from all the divine marks around.

It was made up of a lot of divine marks and it cannot be cracked directly with the help of the Analytic Eye.

It is also necessary to use the ‘Engulf’ skill to devour part of the power of the divine mark while cracking the divine mark.

This process was very slow.

Ye Yu and Zhao Laosan stared at Lin Xiu’s figure. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

But at this moment, Lin Xiu stood motionless like an old monk in meditation.

The two of them looked at each other, but at this time there was still no movement.

If the divine mark giant does not disappear, they will not dare to move.

Time passed quickly and it was the third day.

Many warriors couldn’t find any treasures around, so they left wisely.

But there were still warriors who had just entered the ruins.

Because of Zhao Laosan and Ye Yu, the rest of the warriors did not dare to come and snatch the secret scroll.

“Boy, are you done or not?”

Ye Yu couldn’t take it anymore and immediately shouted at Lin Xiu who was in front of him.

Lin Xiu had been standing there motionless for three days.

The Divine Mark giant was still here and it hasn’t disappeared at all.

Now he didn’t know what’s going on.

Is Lin Xiu playing tricks on them, or is Lin Xiu unable to crack it?

Ye Yu’s roar still didn’t make Lin Xiu react.

The expression in Zhao Laosan’s eyes at this time also changed.

“Wait awhile more.”

Zhao Laosan thought for a while, but still spoke up.

After all, they didn’t know anything about divine marks.

Now, they could only wait for Lin Xiu to decipher this divine mark giant.

Otherwise, they wouldn’t be able to directly fetch this secret scroll of inheritance.

“Humph.”

Ye Yu snorted coldly, staring at Lin Xiu and continued to wait, without any other action.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu opened his eyes.

“It’s decoded!?”

Seeing this scene, Ye Yu said in surprise.

“It’s decoded.”

Lin Xiu opened his eyes and said lightly.

“very good.”

At this time, Ye Yu’s eyes showed a savage look. When he wanted to snatch the scroll, he held the golden long sword in his hand and slashed directly at Lin Xiu’s body!

Since the Divine Mark has been broken, then Lin Xiu was useless to him!

boom–

With a sound, Lin Xiu’s body was directly cut in half by his golden sword!

But at this time, he discovered that Lin Xiu, disappeared like smoke.

Zhao Laosan didn’t care about that much anymore. Since the divine mark has been broken, the next step is to snatch the divine mark Scroll!

He moved and rushed straight ahead.

He was about to snatch the secret scroll of inheritance held by the statue’s hands.

boom–

But just when his body was about to touch the secret scroll of inheritance, the divine mark giant that was looming and seemed to disappear, at this moment, began to emit a faint light again.

The arm of this divine mark giant directly attacked Zhao Laosan!

what happened!?

When Zhao Laosan, who clearly saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

This divine mark giant, wasn’t it cracked, why did it start working again!?

But at this time, he didn’t have time to think too much. With a thought, he unfolded the ‘Sphere’.

boom–

As soon as his ‘Sphere’ was unfolded, the fist of the divine mark giant slammed directly on his ‘Sphere’ and a huge sound erupted.

And because of the terrifying impact, Zhao Laosan flew out at this moment and hit the wall behind him heavily.

The entire relic space shook at this moment.

“you…!”

Ye Yu turned around abruptly and saw Lin Xiu’s figure on the other side.

At this time, Lin Xiu was suspended in the air above that side.

“game over.”

Lin Xiu stared at them, the corners of his mouth curled up with a strange arc and said lightly.

From before, the reason why he didn’t directly conflict with Ye Yu and Zhao Laosan was to grasp everything about the ruins.

Now, after the divine mark Giant was cracked and some of its power was swallowed, Lin Xiu found that he was able to control the divine mark Giant!

With Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the divine mark giant rushed out and attacked Ye Yu!

Ye Yu originally looked at Lin Xiu, but at this moment, he seemed to sense something. When he turned around suddenly, he saw the huge fist of the divine mark giant attacking him!

Damn it!

The pupils in Ye Yu’s eyes shrank suddenly and before he had time to move, his entire body was sent flying out!

“Courting death!!!”
