Chapter 911: Shadow Squad

The flower An Nengxing took out looked like a burning flame.

The red-gold flames looked exceptionally gorgeous.

“Divine Spark, is this the invaluable Divine Spark?”

The rest of the warriors under the platform were surprised when they saw this scene. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

It seems that this thing is very precious.

“This thing is very valuable?”

Lin Xiu showed a faint smile on the corner of his mouth, then turned around and said to Hu Ling.

Hu Ling was stunned for a moment, then nodded.

“Divine Spark is very helpful to warriors who use fire-type skill.”

“It’s an energy body that looks like a flower. It’s very precious and it’s rare on the entire planet.”

“It’s not an exaggeration by saying that it is of priceless value.”

“Very good, I want it.”

Lin Xiu nodded, then announced.

......

“Haha, don’t tell me this kid thinks that he will win?”

“The Shadow Squad is a well-known hunting team. Every member of the team is experienced in hundreds of battles. It is said that the leader of the Shadow Squad is a warrior at the level of Respected warrior.”

“This kid wants to fight against the Shadow Squad alone? It’s just courting death!”

The surrounding warriors were all whispering at this time.

“I think he should be able to win…”

The middle-aged man who was beside Lin Xiu before said subconsciously at this time.

When he looked at Lin Xiu now, he felt completely different from before.

Lin Xiu just gave him the feeling that he is a very ordinary warrior, but the strength displayed on the platform was really terrifying.

And until now, there has never been that kind of terrifying aura coming from Lin Xiu’s body.

It seems like a very ordinary, very ordinary warrior.

But the more this is the case, the more powerful this warrior is.

“Very good, members of the Shadow Squad, gather!”

When An Nengxing heard Lin Xiu agree to fight again, a sneer appeared on the corner of his mouth.

And then shouted loudly through the mic.

“I think it’s better if you don’t.”

Hu Ling thought about it for a while, then said aloud.

“Hu Ling, since he wants to play, mind your own business.”

When An Nengxing heard Hu Ling’s words, he said coldly.

“You are deliberately trying to kill my team members.”

At this moment, Hu Ling’s face became ugly.

“I’m giving him a chance to get the Divine spark.”

An Nengxing retorted.

“Hu Ling, anyway, we don’t have anything to do now, so we should watch one more sideshow.”

Zhang Jin and Luo Kun also walked over at this time.

“Also, he didn’t object, right?”

Hearing their words, Hu Ling’s brows could not help wrinkling.

Indeed, Lin Xiu doesn’t seem to have any objection now.

Could it be that he is really confident or does he not know how powerful this Shadow Squad is?

“Okay, let’s start.”

An Nengxing smiled when he saw a group of warriors wearing black cloaks coming from the other side.

Soon, these warriors in black cloaks stood on the platform.

“Shadow, no problem in killing him, right?”

.

There were six of these warriors in total and the man in the lead was wearing a mask, but a scar on the corner of his upper eye could be seen.

“Sure.”

The warrior known as Shadow said indifferently at this time.

“Very well, then, let’s start.”

As An Nengxing’s words just fell, the other members of the Shadow Squad suddenly moved.

They appeared in front of Lin Xiu like black shadows.

Clankly——

And at the same time, these people instantly drew out one sword after another.

The cold glow continued to flicker out.

“He’s going to die.”

When the surrounding warriors saw this scene, they could not help exclaiming.

An Nengxing also showed a sneer at this time.

This Shadow Squad is a very famous killing machine in Wildfire City.

boom–

At the next moment, there was a loud noise.

All the black figures flew out from the platform!

The five warriors of the Shadow Squad who just rushed over were all knocked out!

Their bodies all hit the wall behind them.

The powerful impact made their bodies directly embedded in the wall!

“This…”

When the surrounding warriors saw this scene, their eyes widened.

It’s as if they were frightened.

The Shadow Squad appeared so powerful when they just came out, so nobody expected that they would all be dealt with so easily.

And all of them were knocked into the wall.

It takes a lot of terrifying power to be able to do all this.

“Respected Warrior”.

Seeing this scene, Shadow frowned slightly.

“Shadow, do you think this kid is at the Respected Warrior level?”

When An Nengxing heard Shadow’s words, he couldn’t help but froze for a while.

Just now, he was wondering if Lin Xiu was a warrior at the level of Respected warrior.

After all, the strength that Lin Xiu showed just now is really too strong.

Hearing Shadow’s words at this time, the more he thought about it, the more likely it was.

How could he possibly knock down a warrior at the peak of the King warrior with a single blow if he wasn’t at the Respected warrior level.

“Boy, you hide quite well ah.”

An Nengxing took a deep look at Lin Xiu and said.

“No, you are too stupid.”

.

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

“kill him!”

An Nengxing’s face became ugly and he roared.

As soon as his words fell, Shadow pulled out a sword in an instant.

The cold light of the sword flashed and a crescent-shaped sword aura charged directly towards Lin Xiu!

swoosh—

In the air, there seemed to be a sound breaking through the air.

But Lin Xiu’s figure, at this moment, disappeared at the same time.

That terrifying sword aura directly caused a deep pit into the wall behind.

crackling-

And at this time, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared in the air!
