1312 Punching a Hole

In the next moment, the giant clay beast that charged over was attacked by Lin Xiu and it was smashed to pieces!

Boom, boom, boom——

And at this moment, as Lin Xiu’s White Moon spear danced, a series of dark blue flaming birds immediately attacked Ning Tianhong.

Damn it!

When Ning Tianhong saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

He didn’t expect that his source mark power would be defeated so easily by Lin Xiu.

And the flaming birds released by Lin Xiu at this time were very hot.

It also made him feel threatened.

At this time, Ning Tianhong didn’t have any hidden strength, and the source strength of his whole body burst out at this moment!

When those flaming birds also impacted his body, he raised his left back directly.

The moment those flaming birds charged over, energy round shields appeared around his outstretched left hand.

Bang bang bang——

This energy shield blocked all the incoming flaming birds.

No harm was done to Ning Tianhong!

‘Profound Intent·Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

And when Lin Xiu saw this scene, he didn’t stop his movements.

The White Moon spear he was holding rushed to Ning Tianhong in an instant.

Whoosh whoosh——

With the use of skill, countless spears were stabbed at this moment.

A swishing sound could be heard.

As the tip of White Moon’s spear continued to hit the energy shield unfolded by his left hand, Ning Tianhong’s body only took a few steps back, but he didn’t seem to be able to break the energy shield at all.

Instead, at this moment, Ning Tianhong stabbed directly at Lin Xiu with the dagger in his right hand!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly. At this time, because the spear had already been thrust out, it seemed that it was too late to resist his attack.

Lin Xiu reacted quickly and mobilized all the energy in his body to gather it in the direction he wanted to stab.

boom–

The dagger did stab at the shoulder of Lin Xiu’s body at the next moment, but because Lin Xiu mobilized the source strength of his whole body, the dagger did not directly penetrate Lin Xiu’s shoulder, but only pierced through it very slightly.

“Get lost!”

And at this moment, Lin Xiu raised his foot and kicked Ning Tianhong in the abdomen.

Poof——

At this moment, Ning Tianhong’s body was kicked out, and a mouthful of blood was spat out.

His energy shield only seemed to cover the range that Lin Xiu had just pierced with his spear. Lin Xiu’s kick obviously had no way of defense.

Being kicked in the abdomen by a God warrior-level warrior like Lin Xiu, the impact of power is very severe.

At this moment, he felt as if his internal organs were about to burst.

“Damn…”

Ning Tianhong did not expect Lin Xiu to be so strong.

Just now he thought that since he failed to bribe Lin Xiu, he shall get rid of Lin Xiu so that Lin Xiu can’t participate in the competition.

But obviously, the one who won’t see the sun tomorrow is very likely to be him.

Because now Lin Xiu’s power… has been released again! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Crash——

A large amount of black energy matter burst out from Linxiu’s body.

These black energy substances rushed toward Ning Tianhong like a tide.

The soil on the surrounding ground turned pitch black because of the black energy substances surging past.

What a terrifying power!

The pupils in Ning Tianhong’s eyes shrank slightly.

These black energies swept from all directions and even impacted from above his head.

In this way, there is no chance to dodge.

Moreover, Ning Tianhong still had a faint feeling that even if he unfolded the ‘Sphere’, he seemed to have no chance of being able to resist this terrifying energy.

“Damn it!!!”

Ning Tianhong looked at Lin Xiu, who was still releasing these terrifying energies and roared angrily.

He looked at the ground and in the next moment, he directly rushed toward the ground under his feet!

Like a mouse burrowing in the ground, he rushed to the ground in an instant and left at an extremely fast speed.

And those black energy substances also hit the position where Ning Tianhong was just now at this moment.

“gone?”

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t have the message of killing the warrior in his mind.

...

At this time, he walked over and took a closer look and Ning Tianhong’s figure had indeed disappeared.

And on the ground where he was just now, there was a hole.

This hole was obviously left behind by Ning Tianhong’s departure just now.

“This guy actually made a hole and left?”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

He has experienced so many battles and this is the first time he has seen a warrior escape directly through a hole.

The skill he used just now was ‘Silence’.

‘Silence’ Originally belonged to the power of the dark attribute and with the fact that he swallowed the black ball before, the power of Lin Xiu’s use of this skill has become even stronger.

If Ning Tianhong hadn’t escaped like this just now, he would have been shocked by this force and even if he didn’t die, his skin would be peeled off.

“never mind.”

Lin Xiu looked at the burrow and shook his head involuntarily.

...

He wanted to continue practicing god-level skill just now, but the fight with Ning Tianhong had consumed a lot of Lin Xiu’s strength.

“The match is about to start…”

It seems that there were a lot of fighters who had won ten consecutive victories. Seems like it is not an easy task to get a good ranking and thus obtain the ‘Metal of Thousand Years Old’.

After thinking about it for a while, Lin Xiu decided to continue practicing this god-level skill.

After all, the recovery speed of his source strength was much faster than that of ordinary warriors. Even if he consumed all the source strength today and practiced overnight, the source strength will definitely recover by the next morning.

“Hu.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath at this time and continued to release the source strength in his hands to practice this god-level skill.

“Damn guy…”

And Ning Tianhong’s figure had already appeared in the courtyard on the other side.

He drilled directly out of the soil.

The black-attributed skill released by Lin Xiu just now was so terrifying that he didn’t dare to continue to fight.

“uncle?”

At this moment, seeing Ning Tianhong crawling out from under the ground, a young man couldn’t help being taken aback.

“Ning Yu, why are you here?”

Ning Tianhong looked at this man, feeling a little embarrassed.

“Ahem, I was practicing just now.”

Before Ning Yu could speak, Ning Tianhong continued to speak.

“How are things going?”

Ning Yu didn’t think too much and continued to speak.

“That kid refused.”
