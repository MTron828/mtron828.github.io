Chapter 642: Tough Fight

Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

With a loud roar from Li Wang, Lin Xiu thought he could see a fuming lion headed towards him. It was glaring at him in anger with its mouth wide open, about to gulp Lin Xiu in one mouthful!

‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks The City’!

Lin Xiu didn’t dodge his attack. Instead, he decided to release his skill as well and face the lion head on.

ROAR-~

‘As Lin Xiu pointed his spear forward, there was a large amount of black particles that gathered together and formed a huge dragon that started attacking Li Wang!

Koong Loong ~-

‘There was a huge explosion that rang throughout the room as both their skills collided.

The entire floor shook. Lin Xiu and Li Wang took a few steps backwards due to the impact from the attack.

Pfft —

Li Wan steadied himself and a huge source of power got spitted out from his mouth.

Lin Xiu didn’t feel good as well. Li Wang was definitely a strong opponent. He was a rank 8 warrior and definitely one of the stronger ones.

He groaned slightly as he could feel a sweet feeling in his throat. Then, there was blood dripping down the edge of Lin Xiu’s lips.

Lin Xiu immediately wiped off the blood on his lips. His eyes looked onto Li Wang and it was filled with hatred.

“Do you need our help?”

At that moment, Baili Haoling walked up to them and asked Lin Xiu.

“It’s alright.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said confidently.

‘As for Ouyang Hang, his strength was only slowly recovering as it was affected by Chloe Water.

“Look at that fella, trying to be a hero once again.”

Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu with dissatisfaction but still jumped off the stage with Baili Haoling. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

When the audience saw what the both of them did, the audience around caused a scene.

This was because they could clearly see that the Sacred Region Academy was about to win. If all three of them attacked Li Wang together, it would be a piece of cake for the Sacred Region Academy to win the match!

However, they did not expect Ouyang Hand and Baili Haoling to jump off the stage.

This meant that the both of them were eliminated from this match. They were not allowed to rejoin the match!

“Baili Haoling, Ouyang Hang, out!”

Li Wang shouted in fury as he dashed towards Lin Xiu!

‘As most of his energy had been gathered onto his axe, his axe was now enveloped in a bright purple glow.

Boom boom boom – —

His attacks were terrifying and Lin Xiu had no other choice but to block them with his spear.

“You brat! Is this all you’ve got?!”

Li Wang looked disdainfully at Lin Xiu who kept blocking his attack with his spear and questioned him.

He wanted to kill Lin Xiu at this instant but Lin Xiu had been able to block each of his attacks and this made him furious.

Lin Xiu glared at Li Wang as well. His eyes were filled with a murderous intention. If he used ‘Rage’ now, he would definitely be able to kill Li Wang immediately but now wasn’t a good time to do so.

This was because he had to save it for the most important match tonight, the Finals.

“Lion Fight!”

Li Wang roared and used the same skill as before.

This skill uses relatively a smaller amount of energy and would give out a larger impact. Lin Xiu looked at the axe and once again saw the lion that was headed in his direction, his pupil shrank.

Compared to the ‘Lion Fight’, the skill that Lin Xiu uses – ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’ needed a larger amount of energy. Therefore, Lin Xiu did not continue using the same skill and decided to block it with just his body strength.

At that moment, Lin Xiu released his ‘Yuan’ as well, covering his entire body!

Boom —

Li Wang’s attack landed on Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’, giving out a huge explosion. Plus, Lin Xiu had also released his warrior title which absorbed most of the impact from the attack.

When Li Wang noticed that his attack seemed to have no effect on Lin Xiu, his eyes widened in shock. He could not believe his eyes.

This warrior skill was the best one that he had. It was just as strong as the one that Lin Xiu had just released but now, Lin Xiu was just defending himself. How was it possible that Lin Xiu could perfectly block his attack?!

This was impossible!

He screamed a little inside from the shock and started attacking Lin Xiu even more aggressively.

This time, Lin Xiu did not block the attack with his spear. Instead, Lin Xiu moved his body to the side and dodged the attack, immediately appearing next to Li Wang.

‘The spear in his arm was glowing with a dark red hue, looking extremely odd.

‘The tip of the spear was aimed towards Li Wang’s ‘Yuan’!

Boom —

As soon as the tip of it touched his Yuan’, the entire sphere started shaking…
