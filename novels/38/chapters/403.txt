Hearing what the boy said, most of the students from the tenth class were the ones looking extremely awful now.

Provocation! This was a public and open insult!

“This is too much!” Li Ping screamed and he clenched onto his fist. Then, the next moment, he dashed towards Wan Ling.

“Hmph!” Seeing how Li Ping was coming at him, Wan Ling gave a cold laugh. He lifted his right fist and gave a huge punch towards Li Ping’s head!

Boom – –

With the loud sound ringing in the room, Li Ping felt a massive amount of energy being forced into his fist when both the fists collided.

Ka la – –

At the same time, it felt as if there was a crack in his bone. Due to the intense force that was coming from the other part, Li Ping took a few steps back.

“With such levels, all of you had only won because of luck!” Wan Ling screamed in rage and continued attacking Li Ping who had already been thrown to a distance because of his fist!

Because of what happened in the previous match, he was embarrassed and didn’t have the guts to face his own classmates which was why he was now filled with anger.

Crap!

Seeing how fast Wan Ling was heading towards him, there was a change of expression in Li Ping’s eyes.

But it was already too late for him to dodge the attack! If Wan Ling’s fist landed on his chest, he would definitely be injured badly!

Boom – –

Just when everything was about to go bad, Li Ping felt that there was a figure who suddenly appeared in front of him, blocking him from the attack.

“En? Such levels? What’s wrong with that?”

A calm voice finally spoke up.

Wan Ling widened his eyes in surprise when he saw what was happening. He noticed that his first was being held by the young man in front of him!

No matter how hard he tried, he wasn’t able to break free from it.

“Who are you?!” Wan Lin glared at Lin Xiu who was a stranger to him as he asked in surprise.

His fist was caught in Lin Xiu’s hand and no matter how much force he used, he still couldn’t break free from it.

As he continued to wriggle his way out, Lin Xiu placid even more strength in his fingers that were holding onto his first, making the grip even tighter.

Crack Crack – –

A small sound was continuously coming from his fist.

Wan Ling ‘s eyes were already wide open from the shock and now, there were droplets of cold sweat that were running down his face.

“F*ck you!!!” Wan Ling screamed in anger and decided to attack Lin Xiu’s head with his other hand!

Boom – –

The same thing happened just as before. The punch that he had thrown at him was caught by Lin Xiu within seconds.

“You are the ones who want to fight everyone in my class?” Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows, asking them curiously.

“You…” Wan Ling’s eyes were now filled with terror.

He was the strongest and most powerful person in the seventh class but this man was able to easily break both his attacks.

What was happening here?!

He had lots of questions in his mind but soon, it was as if he thought of something and his entire face changed.

Perhaps, he’s…?!

“You’re too weak.” Lin Xiu told him before kicking him aside. It was a casual, gentle kick, but Wan Ling’s body was already thrown out of the room.

It was just like kicking away a piece of garbage.

“All of you can come together.” After kicking away their leaders, he told the other boys who were standing behind Wan Ling.

All of them were already prepared to help Wan Ling fight Lin Xiu but they didn’t think that he could easily throw Wan Ling out of the room!

“You shall die!” When they heard the arrogant words from Lin Xiu, all of their faces changed.

Those that could enter the Sacred Region Academy were mostly talented scions. They would never bow down to anyone. Hearing the insults that were coming out of Lin Xiu’s mouth, how could they hold it in?

All of the energy in their body started exploding and all of them dashed towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu remained on his spot, not even moving an inch when he saw them coming at him.

Xiu Xiu Xiu – –

Just when their fists were about to touch Lin Xiu, his body was like a shadow and was constantly dodging their attacks.

Even with the four of them attacking him, they couldn’t even touch the edge of his clothes!

“He’s so strong…” Zhang Ying exclaimed as he was watching Lin Xiu from a distance.

Ever since he met Lin Xiu for the first time, he was already aware of how powerful Lin Xiu was but now, it looks like he was much more powerful than before!

“Game over.” After dodging several attacks from them, he made a 180-degree sweep with his leg and threw all of them to a distance!

Boom Boom Boom – –

All four of them were thrown against the wall and fell onto the ground.

“Monitor! You were so cool!”

“That was awesome!”

Those from the tenth class had already started celebrating.

Lin Xiu’s actions just now were awesome. He didn’t even care about how many of them were attacking him. Lin Xiu just easily got rid of them.

All five of them were moaning in pain, including Wan Ling who was kicked out of the compound. His body was trembling when he looked at Lin Xiu who was standing right in front.

He was in a lot of pain right now, feeling as if the bones in his plan had been torn apart. He was looking at Lin Xiu with fear in his eyes.

“You…. you’re Lin Xiu?” Fighting the pain that was coming from his hand, Wan Ling slowly got up and asked the person opposite him.

Although the match between Lin Xiu and Ouyang Hang during the fresher’s night was attractive, Wan Ling wasn’t able to clearly see Lin Xiu’s face. Now that he finally got the chance to look at him from such a close distance, Wan Ling felt that he looked extremely familiar.

He’s back!

“En, you’re right.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

When Wan Ling heard his answer, his eyes were now completely filled with terror.

Lin Xiu was the number one person amongst the newcomers. He was only a student from the seventh class; even if he was the strongest in his class, he still wouldn’t be able to defeat the number 1!

As for the rest of them, all of them finally managed to stand up and were moaning in pain as they walked towards Wan Ling. Their condition now was not adequate for any battle.

“Do you still want to challenge us?” Lin Xiu rubbed his fingers and there were sounds of him cracking his knuckles.

When they noticed the excited look on Lin Xiu’s face, the rest of them were trembling in fear.

Was there anyone who dared to challenge him now? They would be tortured!

“So what if you’re strong… The match is a 5 person match!”
