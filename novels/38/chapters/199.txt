Chapter 200: Approaching Rank 9!?

*Whew, whew*

After taking a few deep breaths, he calmed himself down.

His wound had completely stopped bleeding and was recovering slowly.

“Damn it, it seems that I have to get someone inside the unit to get me a new arm.” Cheng Fan thought to himself.

His eyes were immediately filled with hatred when he thought about Lin Xiu.

After packing his things, he revealed a sinister face, “Seems like I have to give them a big gift before leaving.”

“As long as it awakens, everyone here will die!!!”

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue continued their journey ahead.

Lin Xiu remained cautious due to the thick mist and held Dark Edge tightly. His eyes darted around for danger.

“Is this towards the center of the city?” Lin Xiu asked.

“En.” Luo Yue nodded her head.

She held her weapon tightly, she could sense that the area around them was strange.

It was as though something was stalking and observing them.

As they continued onward, Luo Yue used her right leg to kick a small pebble forward!

Bang-

The pebble struck something and produced a clear and crisp sound.

Roar-

A howl followed up from the sound!

The pebble that Luo Yue kicked had clearly struck an evolved beast.

They focused forward and saw a mutated red-eyed dog charge at them, one of its eyes had a pebble embedded into it. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Obviously, the pebble that Luo Yue kicked out had struck the mutated red-eyed dog in the eye while it was hiding inside the mist!

“They were following us?” Lin Xiu was shocked at the sight of the mutated dog.

They had left the original battlefield and walked on for around half an hour. Who would have thought that the creature would be following them?

‘That’s too terrifying, right?’

As the first mutated red-eyed dog charged out, even more of them came out from around, forming an encirclement around them!!!

They had large bodies and extremely long and sharp teeth. Their appearance was extremely grotesque.

Lin Xiu frowned and retaliated alongside Luo Yue in different directions!

He held Dark Edge with both hands and performed a swing unleashing many blazing birds at the dogs.

“Let’s turn you guys into hotdogs!” Lin Xiu snorted as the blazing birds charged at the mutated red-eyed dogs!

Rumble rumble-

Explosions occurred the instant the blazing birds collided into the mutated red-eyed dogs.

Awooo-

The rank 5 mutated red-eyed dogs that were surrounded by the blazing birds all howled out loud.

Lin Xiu took the opportunity and charged forward!

Torrential storm of rose flowers!!!!!

The spear transformed into cold lights and stabbed forward under the skill!

The mutated red-eyed dogs that were engulfed in flames were charred black. Unbeknownst to them, Lin Xiu’s spear suddenly appeared and stabbed their bodies!

Lin Xiu felt that he had too few skills in his arsenal, especially with spear skills.

‘I need to learn more skills when we get back!’

“Scram!” While destroying the head of one of the mutated red-eyed dogs that was enveloped in flames, those that were not burnt charged towards him.

Lin Xiu’s eyes changed expression as he bellowed and used his left fist to punch one of the mutated red-eyed dogs.

Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist!!!!

Bang-

When Lin Xiu’s fist landed on the mutated red-eyed dog’s body, electric currents enveloped its body. The immense force and terrifying electric current caused the mutated red-eyed dog to instantly foam at the mouth.

Bang-

Lin Xiu did not give it any opportunity and used Dark Edge Spear to stab into its head.

Luo Yue did not slow down in her momentum. She quickly got rid of the other mutated red-eyed dogs around them with Lin Xiu’s pressure.

Lin Xiu obtained 10 million experience points by killing 10 of them.

“Gugu.” Rollie rolled out and jumped on the corpses and took out all the odd crystals.

“Your creature is very interesting.” Luo Yue saw Rolle holding onto the pile of odd crystals and putting them into his bag and spoke with interest.

Rollie seemed to be afraid of Luo Yue, afraid that Luo Yue would cut it up and perform research on it. It hugged its head and quickly dove into Lin Xiu’s bag.

“I don’t know what it is, to be honest.” Lin Xiu shrugged helplessly.

After all, it was a magical creature, it did not resemble an evolved beast as well.

Lin Xiu only treated it as a pet.

“But there are many rank 5 evolved beasts here. If the other teams came here, I think they would have killed many, right?” Lin Xiu looked at the corpses on the ground.

There were around 20 odd of them.

The mutated red-eyed dogs were evolved beasts that hunted in packs. They had killed a few before and even more came running back and hid in the mist with the intent of ambushing them.

All of a sudden, a loud sound was heard in the distance.

It sounded as though something had exploded.

The ground started to tremble as well.

‘What’s going on?!’

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted as he held onto a pillar next to him.

As the ground trembled, the surrounding mist gradually dissipated.

Their vision became clearer.

In the distance, they saw an extremely tall structure that seemed to shoot through the clouds in the center of the city.

A series of explosions had occurred on the structure, and there seemed to be a large creature at the bottom that had been roused awake and was flapping its wings.

Lin Xiu was able to sense the terrifying pressure from it even from the distance.

The wind around them gradually picked up. Lin Xiu was alarmed, the creature was able to create such effects just by flapping its wings!

Lin Xiu took in a breath of cold air, could that be the rank 9 evolved beast?!
