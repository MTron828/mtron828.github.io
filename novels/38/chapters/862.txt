Chapter 863: Sword Breaks the Heaven (2)

Jiang Qian stepped back subconsciously at this time, then shouted loudly.

Hundreds of thousands of warriors around were holding giant laser guns, which had already been aimed at everyone.

And those armored vehicles like giant beasts and the weapons of those aircraft suspended in the air are also aimed at them.

Even a rank 9 warrior will be instantly annihilated under the impact of this latest type of laser attack!

Luo Yue held the thin-winged long sword in her hand and at this moment, the strength of her whole body gathered.

This long sword instantly burst out with white light.

She glanced around her eyes, but there was no expression on her face.

Purple gold-level skill – ‘Sword Breaks the Heaven’!

From her body, a large amount of white light was transmitted, covering the entire ground instantly.

Whoosh whoosh—

And at this moment, from the ground, a large number of white sword rays transformed from the source power suddenly appeared!

All flew from the ground.

There seemed to be thousands of sword rays and it was impossible to see how many there were.

The bodies of those warriors were directly penetrated from bottom to top, running through the entire body.

Armored vehicles and aircrafts, at this moment, were all blasted apart by the thousands of dense sword rays!

Jiang Qian’s body trembled at this time.

This... what kind of skill is this!?

Looking at the thousands of sword rays hitting the sky, his legs softened.

“Warrior Union huh?”

Luo Yue said lightly.

“you dare!!!”

Jiang Qian watched as the sword rays slammed into the air, then all gathered together.

Formed an incomparably huge sword ray and charged down from the air!

His body trembled.

The power of this skill is beyond his imagination.

The energy contained in this sword ray is simply terrifying!

boom boom boom —

“Go.”

With the movement of Luo Yue’s thoughts, the incomparably huge sword ray in the air directly charged down at an even more terrifying speed!

The surrounding air seemed to be distorted.

Jiang Qian felt that his body was being suppressed by an invisible force.

He wanted to dodge, but he didn’t have the strength to dodge at all.

“No!!!”

He roared and at this moment, the ‘Sphere’ unfolded.

But even so, the terrifying and huge sword ray impacted down, directly breaking his ‘Sphere’.

The huge sword ray directly annihilated his body.

The surrounding aircraft fell all over the ground.

Ouyang Hang’s eyes widened and he was still in shock, unable to recover.

Although Luo Yue was very strong back then, she wasn’t so incredibly powerful.

This kind of strength, on this earth, is simply an invincible existence!

“Are you guys all right?”

At the same time, a figure came over from the other side.

It’s Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu looked at the surrounding scene and the expression in his eyes could not help but change slightly.

But seeing that Luo Yue and the others were all fine, he could not help but heaved a sigh of relief.

“Lin Xiu, where did you guys go?”

Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu’s arrival at this time and finally couldn’t help but say aloud.

When they came back this time, they were so powerful that they had overturned his three views.

“Marqi Planet, but the route over there has been permanently closed.”

There is nothing to hide about this matter, Lin Xiu said lightly.

As they returned to Earth, after the spacecraft returned, no one would dare to come over from Marqi planet without his permission.
