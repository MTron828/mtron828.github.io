At the next moment, he suddenly felt that his soul was being burned.

On Lin Xiu’s body, there were those faint blue flames!

As he wanted to tear Lin Xiu’s soul apart, those faint blue flames seemed to rush toward him in an instant.

The terrifying blue flame burned his soul.

!!

The pain that burned his soul made him howl continuously.

“The Netherworld flame…you actually absorbed the Netherworld flame…”

At this time, the voice of the God King Tianyuan continued to come out.

The most terrifying thing about this Netherworld Flame was that it was a flame that could burn the soul!

“Even if you use the system, you will be burned to death.”

Lin Xiu said to himself in his heart at this moment.

Naturally, God King Tianyuan couldn’t understand what system Lin Xiu was talking about.

At this moment, he was going crazy.

He clearly felt that his soul had been burned rapidly.

Soon, he will completely disappear from this world!

“Let me go! Let me go! I’ll tell you how to become a god king!”

At this moment, the God King Tianyuan roared loudly.

His soul wanted to leave Lin Xiu’s body, but it was too late.

As if blocked by an invisible barrier, his soul can only stay in Lin Xiu’s body.

Bearing the burning of the Netherworld flame in Lin Xiu’s body.

“No need, I will become the God King.”

Lin Xiu was full of confidence.

Because this was certain.

At this time, the Netherworld Flame in the body began to operate crazily.

Soon, these Netherworld Flame burned the soul of God King Tianyuan even faster.

Lin Xiu directly ignored the wailing and screaming of the God King Tianyuan.

Soon, as his soul power was completely burned, a system prompt of gaining experience came from his head.

And at this moment, if you take a closer look, your experience progress bar is already full!

It seems to be… an upgrade!

At this time, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly.

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for successfully upgrading, the current level is 74!”

“Congratulations to the master for obtaining the divine blessing. All the skills have been refreshed and all abnormalities had been removed!”

At this moment, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that his whole body felt extremely comfortable.

All system skills have been refreshed!

The aftereffects of Fury were also gone.

If he had known this earlier, he would have killed the God King Tianyuan by using the system skills directly just now.

But at this time, Lin Xiu didn’t think too much about it.

After taking a closer look, Lin Xiu could clearly see his current panel.

Rage build-up: 0/1

With the level up, Lin Xiu obviously felt that the strength of his body had increased a lot.

What’s more, Lin Xiu was even more pleasantly surprised that he got 6,000 potential points in this upgrade!

2000 points were added to strength, 2000 to physique and 2000 to speed!

After Lin Xiu finished distributing the potential points, he immediately felt that the overall strength had increased again.

“Comfortable.”

Lin Xiu let out a mouthful of turbid air and his whole body became refreshed.

It’s still one level short. Once he levels up again, he could probably become a god king!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu clenched his fists a little excitedly.

...

He looked around but still didn’t find anything.

However, the statue of the God King Tianyuan has a lot of cracks, as if it is about to burst.

And as the statue broke, Lin Xiu faintly felt that there seemed to be a faint energy fluctuation coming out of it.

Inside, there seems to be something!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu clenched the golden spear in his hand and directly attacked the huge statue!

Bang bang bang——

As the incomparably powerful force of the long spear swept over, loud noises erupted immediately.

There were more and more cracks on the statue and in the next moment, it burst directly.

Boom——

As the statue exploded, there was a huge sound and the surrounding area was also filled with smoke and dust.

“Cough cough.”

...

The dust was so severe that Lin Xiu couldn’t help coughing a few times.

With a wave of the spear in his hand, all the dust was dispersed.

Taking a closer look, there seems to be something on the base of the statue, emitting a dazzling light.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

After walking over with the spear in hand, the pupils in his eyes suddenly shrank.

Because after the statue was destroyed, there were many odd crystals on the base, combat uniforms, and some unnamed treasures.

“Damn…”

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

This was really too exaggerated, there were so many treasures.

Even Lin Xiu, who had seen all kinds of big scenes, couldn’t help swallowing secretly at this time.

And the things inside, even the odd crystals, were odd crystals that contain extremely strong energy.

After taking a deep breath and calming down, Lin Xiu put all these things back into his expansion space with a thought.

“Come in quickly! Everything is inside!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At the same time, some voices also came in from the passage.

It seems that without the influence of those attribute energies, these people rushed in very quickly.

As soon as he rushed in, they saw Lin Xiu standing there.

The five warriors seem to be united together.

They looked at Lin Xiu standing here and their eyes were filled with surprise.

It seems that they never expected that someone would come here earlier than themselves.

“Who are you?”

One of the bald men stared at Lin Xiu and frowned.

Lin Xiu glanced at them and didn’t explain anything, then was about to walk to the passage.

Now Lin Xiu’s strength has improved a lot. It was easy to deal with these people.

When his strength reached this level, Lin Xiu was too lazy to fight these people anymore.

“Brother, look this way!”

The bald man saw that Lin Xiu dared to ignore him. Just as he was trying to block Lin Xiu’s way, a warrior beside him pulled his clothes.

“What’s the matter?”

He frowned and subconsciously looked to the side.

He then saw some dilapidated battle suits on the ground.
