Chapter 563: Weapons Pavilion

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu wasn’t sure about what just happened but he could feel that ever since they absorbed the energy source, there was some mutation that happened to both the evolved beats.

Especially Rollie…..it was already a weird evolved beast that he has never seen in his entire life and was now becoming a bigger mystery.

This time, Lin Xiu headed towards the only place in Sacred Region Academy where you can forge weapons – – Weapons Pavilion.

This pavilion was located in a more secluded area in the campus and there weren’t many people in this area.

He could already hear the loud sound of metals clunking from outside and as soon as he walked into the pavilion, he could clearly feel that the air around him had a higher temperature than the air outside. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Young man, here to forge a weapon?” A man with a beard smiled and asked as he noticed Lin Xiu.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Eh….what is this?” The bearded man was about to say something else when he noticed the two creatures that were resting on his shoulder and he suddenly got interested.

“Ummmm … just normal beasts.” Lin Xiu quickly answered.

“Can I have a look?” The bearded man asked.

“Chirp Chirp Chirp!!!”

Xiao Bai immediately understood what the bearded man wanted and immediately chirped in anger, acting like an angry bird.

The bearded man jumped when Xiao Bai reacted. He was about to touch it but suddenly pulled his arm back.

“Your pets are really fierce.” The bearded man mumbled to himself.

“Can you help me forge a weapon?” Lin Xiu asked politely.

“Of course. I am Qian Hu, the best forger in the entire academy but do you have enough points to pay me?” Qian Hu asked in arrogance.

He wouldn’t have similar confidence if it was anything else but when it came to forging weapons, he was indeed one of the best.

“How many points would you need?”

“I’ll have to take a look at your weapon.” Qian Hu didn’t say anything else and asked for the long spear that Lin Xiu was holding onto.

“Sure.” Lin Xiu handed over Dark Edge Spear to the bearded man.

When he took over the long spear, Qian Hu was stunned when he saw what it was.

“Dark Edge Spear?!”

“You know as well?” Lin Xiu was surprised.

“Of course. Although the Dark Edge series isn’t the sharpest weapon, they are still extremely rare. There are only a few of them left in the entire world.”

“But yours seemed to be a little different. There were other materials that had been added to it before this. What is it though?”

As Qian Hu continued checking out Dark Edge Spear, he got even more excited.

He even took out a high-tech instrument to take a better look at Lin Xiu’s spear.

“Wow….this is too good to be true. Who is the one who incorporated the materials?! It’s done perfectly.”

After hearing his compliments, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but think of the face of the cold young girl; only god knows when he would be able to see her again.

“Your weapon is already perfect. I don’t have any material that is good enough to be incorporated into it.” Qian Hu told Lin Xiu the truth.

He did a thorough check on the spear and noticed that the other material that he incorporated into the spear was something that he couldn’t recognize as well.

It definitely wasn’t something that they could find on earth and was something from another planet.

Although he had materials from the alien planets as well, it still wasn’t as good as the one that has been placed into the Dark Edge.

After hearing what he had, Lin Xiu didn’t say much as he knew that the materials that could be added onto the Dark EdgeSpear was something that was precious.

“I brought my own ingredients. Why don’t you take a look at it and see if it’s suitable to be used?” Lin Xiu took out his backpack and asked Qian Hu.

“What did you bring?” Qian Hu got curious. When he opened the backpack that Lin Xiu showed him, he could see a few things that were in the shape of a sickle.

“Is this….. The front foot of a color-changing mantis…?” Qian Hu immediately recognized what it was after looking at it for a while.

“Yeap. The front foot of a color-changing mantis.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Ohhhh so it is… Wait, what did you say?” Qian Hu’s eyes were opened wide and he seemed a little overexcited.

“The front foot of the color-changing mantis.” Lin Xiu chuckled before repeating himself.

Qian Hu’s reaction was something that Lin Xiu expected since the color-changing mantis was an evolved beast that was endangered.

Who knew that he would be able to meet such a creature in the Burial Grounds of the Thunder Valley?

However, he has killed all of the color-changing mantis that was alive. This should be the last of the front foot of the colour-changing mantis in this world?

“It is! It definitely is!” Qian Hu took a better look at it before screaming in excitement.

“Do you think that…..it is possible for us to incorporate this into the spear?” Lin Xiu asked.

After hearing his question, Qian Hu took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down.

“I’m not sure. I’ve never seen a color-changing mantis in my life. I’ve only heard of it.” Qian Hu looked at the backpack that was filled with the front foot and there was a burning passion in his eyes.

“You can try. It doesn’t matter if it didn’t work.” Lin Xiu paused before continuing.

The scariest skill of these front feet was that they could break the ‘Yuan’.

If they were able to melt it and incorporate it into his spear, would his spear have the terrifying abilities to break ‘Yuan’ as well?

If that was possible, his spear would be an extremely powerful weapon.

“Alright. Since you trust me, I’ll try.” Qian Hu rubbed his hands and he was getting excited.

From the looks of it, it seemed obvious that Qian Hu couldn’t wait to start on this weapon.

“When can I pick it up?” Lin Xiu asked.

“Tomorrow afternoon. I’ll start now and if it works, you should have an entirely new Dark Edge by tomorrow!” Qian Hu tried to control himself.

“Sure. How much would it cost?” Lin Xiu continued asking.

“Forget about the points. It’s an honor for me to be able to forge such a weapon.” Qian Hu simply told Lin Xiu.

The weapons from the Dark Edge Series were already extremely rare and he even had one of the rarest materials on earth – the front foot of the colour-changing mantis. This was a rare opportunity where not all forgers would get in their entire life which was why Qian Hu was jumping in joy.

“Alright then. I’ll pick it up tomorrow afternoon.”

“Sure. Sure!” Qian Hu continued nodding and couldn’t wait to start forging.

After leaving the pavilion, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he stared at the tall tower that was far away from him..
