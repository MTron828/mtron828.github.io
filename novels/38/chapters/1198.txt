1199 God-level Skill Card!

“Then try this, does it work?”

At the same time, Lin Xiu in the sky snorted coldly.

The Dark edge spear in his hand was directly retracted into his expansion space.

With a thought, he waved his hands.

The three lotus fires were instantly released.

‘Full Blown Profound Intent’!

While using this system skill, the lotus fire released by Lin Xiu can also be affected by this system skill.

Become even larger and full of power!

“go!”

Following Lin Xiu’s stern shout, the three lotus fires directly charged towards Sun Qi below!

“It’s useless, it’s useless!!!”

Seeing this scene, Sun Qi still roared fiercely.

It seems that he wants to take on the three lotus fires released by Lin Xiu!

“What the hell is this…”

Some warriors saw the red lotus fire, ice lotus fire and thunder lotus fire released by Lin Xiu and their eyes were full of surprise.

Because they clearly felt that these three lotus fires were full of terrifying power.

“Get out of the way!!!”

When the city lord of Tianyi City saw this scene, he immediately shouted at Sun Qi.

But these three lotus fires, under the influence of ‘Full blown profound intent’, are not only full of terrifying power, but also huge.

At this time, the lotus fires came down, covering the entire platform!

Unless he flew away, there was no way to dodge.

At this moment, Sun Qi didn’t have time to fly away from the stage.

Three gigantic lotus fires charged down directly and slammed into Sun Qi’s body!

“what!!!”

Sun Qi roared loudly and the strength of his whole body burst out at this moment.

His divine soul armor radiated golden light.

The cracks on his soul armor became more and more obvious.

Boom—

As the three lotus fires converged and hit his body, an incomparably loud sound suddenly erupted.

At this moment, the entire platform trembled wildly.

There are numerous cracks on it.

At this time, Sun Qi was still roaring, trying to use his soul armor to block Lin Xiu’s attack.

But the power that these three groups of lotus fires gathered together was really terrifying and powerful.

Sun Qi’s divine soul armor shattered in the next moment!

Those terrifying fire attributes, ice attributes and energy mixed with thunder attributes directly filled his entire body.

With such direct contact with his body, even if his physical strength is strong, he wouldn’t be able to handle it!

“what!!!”

As he let out a wailing, without the protection of his soul armor, his entire body shattered into countless pieces!

“No!!!”

When the city lord of Tianyi City saw this scene, his eyes were split.

How much energy and resources did he put in to cultivate such a powerful existence.

Now he was killed by Lin Xiu like this!

He was so angry that his body trembled and the veins on his body burst out, as if he wanted to kill Lin Xiu immediately.

“calm down.”

Just when he made a move, a warrior beside him grabbed him.

The city lord of Tianyi City took a deep breath and calmed down.

Fu Tianyuan was here. At this time, he held the competition and the rules were also set. No matter how angry he was, he couldn’t act rashly.

Otherwise, his fate would be tragic.

At this time, the city lord of Tianyi City stared at Lin Xiu who was still in the sky, wishing to skin Lin Xiu alive.

“Phew.”

And Lin Xiu, who was in the sky, took a deep breath at this time.

The body slowly descended from the sky.

The blow just now consumed a lot of his body’s strength.

After all, this guy’s Soul Armor is too defensive against attribute energy.

If it wasn’t for the fact that his divine soul armor was cracked by the attack of his clone, this move might not be able to kill him directly.

At this time, he subconsciously looked at the experience progress bar in his system and found that his experience had increased by about 5%.

Quite a lot of experience.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu was surprised.

In addition to the previous experience, his experience has risen to about 15%.

Although it will take a long time to upgrade, Lin Xiu is still very satisfied.

After all, he has now reached the level of the god warrior.

“Is there anyone else?”

At this time, Lin Xiu glanced around, then said lightly.

Some warriors looked at Lin Xiu’s glance and took a step back subconsciously.

The strength that Lin Xiu showed just now is indeed too strong.

Among the warriors of the younger generation, Sun Qi is the strongest. Now that Sun Qi has been killed, who else dares to come up?

Fu Tianling’s expression was terrifyingly gloomy now.

“I’ll fight you…”

Fu Tianling clenched his hands into fists and was about to go to the platform and kill Lin Xiu.

“enough.”

At this moment, Fu Tianyuan’s eyes turned towards him and said coldly. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“But…”

Fu Tianling was unwilling, but when he saw his brother’s eyes, he didn’t dare to say anything.

Fu Tianyuan allowed him to make a fool of himself, just once.

If this nonsense continues, this annual feast has become a laughing stock instead.

clap clap-

At this moment, Fu Tianyuan walked over to Lin Xiu.

As he walked, he clapped a few times.

“Sure enough, the hero is a boy. The city lord of Lingxian City is not only so young, but also of great strength.”

Fu Tianyuan said to Lin Xiu indifferently.

“you flatter me.”

At this time, Lin Xiu looked at Fu Tianyuan and said in a humble voice.

“Is there anyone else who wants to challenge Lin Xiu?”

Fu Tianyuan glanced at Lin Xiu approvingly and glanced around.

The younger generation of warriors who were brought by the city lords of other cities around were all silent.

After all, Lin Xiu’s strength was apparent, they didn’t want to follow in Sun Qi’s footsteps.

“Since that’s the case, then this time, he takes first place.”

Fu Tianyuan waved his hand at this time and two warriors came over from both sides.

In their hands, they all held a black wooden box.

This wooden box is made of special wood and seems to be very heavy.

The two warriors were holding it with both hands and it seemed that they were a bit struggling.

“In the box, there are two god-level skill cards.”

“One is for you as the first reward and the other is for the city lord of the city you came from.”

Fu Tianyuan spoke up.

Because Lin Xiu is the city lord of Lingxian City, this time, Lin Xiu alone has obtained two god-level skill cards!

envy.

The eyes of the surrounding warriors were full of incomparable jealousy.

This is not an ordinary skill card, but a god-level skill card!
