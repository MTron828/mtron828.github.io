He could only flee!

Although he was a peak rank 7 warrior, he didn’t expect that with so many people in his team, they still couldn’t defeat the old man so he obviously didn’t stand a chance.

And he was the most skilled person on the team. Hence, he was the one safekeeping the item in the box.

At this moment, he triggered his mind and his body instantly turned into a black shadow. Then, he disappeared in place and was about to rush out the door of the safe passage.

“Where are you going?”

Seeing that he was about to leave, the old man appeared at the door, then raised his foot to step on the door beam, and said to the black figure in front of him.

How could it be!?

At this time, the man saw the old man in front of him, and there was an extremely shocked look on his face.

.

In just one second, this old man appeared here from the other side?!

What a terrifying speed!?

“Courting death!” At this time, the man’s eyes revealed a hint of viciousness as he slammed the box he held in his hand directly on the old man’s head!

Bang–

But at this moment, he found that his wrist was pinched firmly like iron tongs.

“You...?”

He looked at his wrist and the pupils in his eyes constricted.

He squeezed his right hand so tightly that his veins protruded and slammed it on the old man’s head again!

Bang–

But it was still the same as before. The old man pinched his wrist tightly before the man’s fist was thrown out!

He wanted to kick the old man’s crotch with his right foot but as soon as he lifted his leg, the old man’s foot slammed on the back of his foot and he didn’t even have a chance to lift his foot.

“You can’t deal with the old man like that, young man.” The old man, who had clearly seen his intentions smiled, and at the next moment, he used force on his hand.

Click, click, click——

The man’s arms were like twisted green bamboo, letting out a crisp sound.

“Ah!!!”

His hands were twisted by the old man and the intense pain caused the man to wail.

Boom–

In the next moment, as the old man raised his foot, he kicked the man out and he hit the wall behind him. The man was very dizzy.

After doing all this, the old man patted the dust off his clothes and looked at the box on the ground with an interesting smile.

“Why, surprised?” The old man looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, then said with a smile on his face.

Lin Xiu came to his senses and looked at the old man with a look of defensiveness.

This old man was so strong that Lin Xiu felt quite threatened.

“Who are you anyway?” Luo Yue looked at the old man and said coldly.

This level of strength was not what an ordinary warrior can achieve.

“I’m an old man.” The old man smiled at this moment, then took the box to observe it, and slowly, he found a button in the box.

Click——

As the old man pressed the button, a crisp sound rang instantly. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

The box began to open slowly.

And at this time, Lin Xiu could see a faint blue light in the box.

“So you guys really stole it.” The old man looked at the men in black on the ground whose hands and feet were all broken and said aloud.

“Do you want to take a look? This is very rare.” The old man said.

Lin Xiu was stunned. At this moment, he and Luo Yue looked at each other, nodded, and walked over.

This old man should have no malice towards himself and Luo Yue. If he makes a move, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue would be taken down even before they could attack.

At this time, Lin Xiu walked over and saw the stone in the box.

The stone was light blue with many spots of light on it – it was beautiful.

The surface of the stone was like a starry sky.

“Is this the alien ore?” Lin Xiu asked.

This alien ore was exactly the same as what Zeng Ruo showed him.

It must be right, this thing must be the lost alien ore, which was stolen by this group of people.

Woo woo-

At the same time, Lin Xiu could clearly hear a sound coming from outside.

What’s going on!?

Lin Xiu heard this sound, and looked out of the huge French window, and saw many aircraft flying towards the top of the Sacred Region Academy building.

Everything happened in just a short ten minutes.

Those government forces in the Deep Blue City seemed to have discovered that this group of people had entered the building from the roof.

“Seems like they will be coming very soon.” The old man’s mouth curled up at this moment, and then looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue and said aloud.

“You guys, do you want this?”

The old man held the box with his right hand out, then said to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

Lin Xiu stared at this piece of alien ore that looked like a shining star and was stunned.

“This thing is top quality material for forging weapons, if you add this material and continue forging your spear, it will become stronger.” The old man continued.

“You must know that this is a rare and precious material for forging weapons…”

“It’s such a good item and you want to give it to me?” Lin Xiu was not a fool, there is no such thing as a free meal.

Lin Xiu sneered at this time and asked the old man.

“And those people are going to come soon. When that happens, they will definitely take this thing away.”

“I obviously have a way.” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the old man didn’t get angry and still spoke with a smile.

“They probably need about 6 to 7 minutes to come down. If the both of you can hit me with a punch within 5 minutes, this piece of ore is yours.” The old man looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue and said.

“I haven’t moved for a long time and haven’t scratched this itch yet.”
