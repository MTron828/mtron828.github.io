Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

“You should leave.”

Luo Yan stared at Nan Huang’s grandfather as she said to Luo Yue.

Luo Yue frowned when she heard what her sister said. She turned around looking for Lin Xiu. Without any hesitation, she swung her left hand and picked up the sword that had been knocked onto the ground before running towards Lin Xiu.

She had to help Lin Xiu get rid of the elders, even if they were rank 9 warriors.

At the same time, the elder from the Zhuo family noticed that he was getting more nervous as he continued fighting Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s skills were too quick and they were so sharp that they were terrifying.

He could clearly feel that Lin Xiu was in a rush to kill him.

“Damn it! Did you take the forbidden drugs?!”

The elder from the Zhuo family said as he tried to stop Lin Xiu’s attack.

This was all because the strength that Lin Xiu was showing now was different from when they first started.

His strength could tremendously increase by such a huge amount within such a short period of time. It would not be possible if he didn’t take the forbidden drugs.

Plus, the withdrawal effects of these drugs were deadly. It would only help him increase his strength within a limited time. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

From how Lin Xiu was in a hurry to kill him, he was sure that Lin Xiu was fighting against time.

Lin Xiu was trying to kill him as quickly as possible!

When Lin Xiu heard his question, he ignored him but his attack became even scarier than before.

Boom boom boom – —

As the spear landed on the elder’s ‘Yuan’, there was a loud sound.

‘At the same time, Lin Xiu’s spear was slowly turning a dark red hue.

The Dark Edge that has been incorporated with the colour-changing mantis would turn red whenever the skill of breaking ‘Yuan’ was activated.

‘What was happening?!

The elder noticed the changes on Lin Xiu’s spear and within seconds, the black spear landed on the elder’s ‘Yuan’ and he could feel his protective spear shaking. It felt as if his ‘Yuan’ was about to crack!

“AHHHHH!!!”

He was sure that Lin Xiu had taken forbidden drugs and if he continued fighting like this, he might not be able to hold him off until the effects of the drugs wear off. If his ‘Yuan’ gets destroyed, he would be dead!

He shouted as his sword was in the air, blocking Lin Xiu’s spear. Then, he swung it around and attacked Lin Xiu.

With good reflexes, Lin Xiu quickly turned sideways and dodged the attack.

His sword flew out of his ‘Yuan’ and was stuck on one of the stone pillars.

“Dragons at Sea’!!! ”

The elder from the Zhuo family screamed as he lost his sword.

As he grabbed Lin Xiu with both his hands, there was a terrifying source of energy that surrounded his arms. The energy turned into two dragons, one white and the other black; both of them headed towards Lin Xiu!

Both the dragons were fast and Lin Xiu had just dodged the flying sword which was why he was immediately hit by the dragon since he didn’t have the time to react.

Both the dragons surrounded Lin Xiu and it immediately restrained Lin Xiu’s body!

Lin Xiu widened his eyes. He tried his best to set himself free but he couldn’t move at all.

“Quick! Do it!”

The elder from the Zhuo family immediately commanded the men who were hiding in the building with their laser guns. All of them aimed at Lin Xiu and started shooting.

Xiu xiu xiu -—

Loud shooting noises surrounded the air and Lin Xiu could clearly see that there was a large amount of laser shooting at him.

“Yuan’!

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and released his ‘Yuan’.

There was a dark red hue that immediately surrounded Lin Xiu’s body and protected Lin Xiu.

However, these lasers were different from the ones before. They were the newest model and their strength was one of the strongest.

Boom boom boom – —

As the lasers landed on Lin Xiu’s protective shield, the entire circle started shaking.

Lin Xiu could feel the strong impact of the lasers and he had a bad feeling about it.

As for the elder from the Jiang family, he had been waiting for this chance. He held his hammer with both his hands and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

He was moving extremely fast and you could no longer see his figure.

Lin Xiu was still trying his best to set himself free but there was nothing he could do since this was a skill of a rank 9 warrior, which meant that it would take some time before he could escape from it.

That’s when Lin Xiu felt a terrifying aura from behind him.

He wouldn’t be able to dodge it now!

Koong Loong – –

The elder from the Jiang family aimed his hammer on Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’. With a loud sound, there were cracks all over Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’!

“Break apart now!!!”

Seeing how there were cracks on the protective shield, the elder screamed as he swung another attack onto Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’!

Koong Loong — —

This time, Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’ immediately broke!

“You’re dead now!”

‘As soon as the ‘Yuan’ broke, the elder continued swinging his hammer, wanting to break Lin Xiu’s head into pieces!

It’s over!

Now that he was being constrained by the dragons, Lin Xiu felt as if he couldn’t even use the ‘Mirror Image’.

Boom —

All of a sudden, a bright, sharp glow appeared and the elder from the Jiang family who was about to attack Lin Xiu suddenly stopped and moved to the side.

“Damn it!”

As he turned to the side, he saw Luo Yue who was coming at him.

Luo Yue?!

When his protective shield was destroyed, Lin Xiu felt a heavy feeling in his chest and there was blood coming out from the edge of his lips.

Luo Yue noticed that there were two black and white dragons that were around Lin Xiu’s body and they were both from the other old man. Without thinking much, she turned towards the elder from the Zhuo family!

Her sword was about to chop off both of his hands!

‘When the elder noticed that Luo Yue was coming towards him, his eyes narrowed and immediately stopped his skills.

He wouldn’t want to lose both his hands because of Luo Yue!

Lin Xiu, who was finally free, immediately headed towards Luo Yue!

Xiu xiu xiu -—

There were countless lasers that were shooting at Lin Xiu but he dodged all of them.

Koong Loong ~ –

However, Lin Xiu did not notice that there was a huge drone in the air that had accumulated a huge amount of energy and it was aimed at Lin Xiu!

“Be careful!”

Luo Yue rushed towards Lin Xiu and she screamed at Lin Xiu.

But before she could finish, there was a powerful laser that leaded towards Lin Xiu!

Boom —

Luo Yue’s ‘Yuan’ had a hole in it from the attack and it went across her chest.

There was blood all over her clothes.

“LUO YUE!!!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes tuned blood red when he saw what had happened.
