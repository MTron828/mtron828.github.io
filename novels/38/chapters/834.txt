Chapter 835: Giant Gate

The man muttered to himself, then approached the gate.

“Don’t go there!”

Chen Dong seemed to sense something at this time and suddenly said.

But the man seemed to be affected by something and he had slowly walked over to the huge gate.

At the moment when his hands touched the bright gate, a strange ‘click’ rang out.

Whoosh whoosh—

From the top of the head, cracks appeared in an instant, then a large number of small gun heads appeared above.

A large number of laser rays were shot directly!

The man’s body was instantly penetrated, becoming a hornet’s nest.

Chen Dong’s eyes widened, but at this time, there was no way to save him.

The rest of the warriors also felt a chill on their backs at this time and their backs were covered in cold sweat.

“What the hell... what the hell is going on?”

A warrior secretly swallowed his saliva and there was a look of fear.

He also wanted to get close just now, but fortunately he didn’t walk over.

“What should we do now?”

The surrounding warriors all looked towards Chen Dong.

After all, this time, Chen Dong was the team captain.

And it was appointed by Old Man An, so everything must follow his arrangement.

But two warriors had died since boarding the ship.

A total of 18 warriors were recruited and now there were only 17 left, including Chen Dong.

Those crew members were of low strength and are not counted among them.

“Wait a minute.”

Chen Dong hesitated for a while, then said aloud.

Now, this situation seems a little weird.

The penetrating power of those laser rays is really too powerful. The warrior just now was a warrior who had just stepped into the King warrior level and he died here so tragically.

What should he do?

“Could it really be an alien base?”

Lin Xiu whispered to Luo Yue at this time.

Everything here looks so weird.

“Possible.”

Luo Yue nodded.

At this time, he was holding the long sword in his hand and looked at the side above the gate. With a sudden wave of the long sword in his hand, a burst of icy sword aura burst out and attacked over!

Boom—

With a loud noise, the upper side shook.

But there was no way to destroy the laser device over there.

Because after the laser device penetrated the man’s body, it was directly put away and hidden in the ceiling.

“We can’t attack now. I’ll go over and attract this device out, then you can attack.”

Lin Xiu thought about it for a moment, then said to Luo Yue.

“But...”

Luo Yue said worriedly.

“nothing.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You know my abilities.”

Lin Xiu said with a smile.

“you are right...”

Luo Yue hesitated for a while and suddenly thought of something.

“Lin Xiu, what are you going to do?”

Watching Lin Xiu walk over there, Chen Dong said suddenly.

“Don’t go there!”

“It’s fine.”

Lin Xiu said, then walked over to the gate.

The other warriors were also taken aback when they saw this scene.

Just now, the warrior was instantly pierced by the laser beam and Lin Xiu still went over. Is he stupid?

And this laser ray was obviously different from the general laser ray and the penetrability was too strong.

No one knew whether it will directly penetrate the human body.

At this time, Lin Xiu had already walked to the front of the gate. Looking at the huge gate glowing white, he took a deep breath and stretched out his hand to push the gate open.

‘Crack’

At this moment, the exact same thing as just now appeared.

The moment Lin Xiu’s hands touched the door, it opened on the ceiling above and some laser devices appeared instantly, shooting at Lin Xiu’s body!

Seeing this scene, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes suddenly changed.

The laser beam shot out in an instant and it directly pierced Lin Xiu’s body with riddled holes!

And at this moment, Luo Yue, who was standing behind, quickly waved the long sword in her hand.

At this moment, a large amount of sword aura burst out.

Immediately hit the top.

boom boom boom —

As the ice sword aura hit those laser devices, in the next moment, a powerful sound suddenly erupted.

This laser device exploded directly!

Immediately, the fire was shining.

The people around were all unfolding their ‘Spheres’ at this time, for fear that the blasted laser devices would hit them.

“Lin Xiu...”

When Chen Dong looked at Lin Xiu, who had been penetrated by the laser beam, he was about to feel pity, when he heard a voice from behind:

“What happened?”

The pupils in Chen Dong’s eyes shrank involuntarily.

When he turned around suddenly, he saw that Lin Xiu appeared behind him at some point!

“you...”

At this time, the other men also saw Lin Xiu appearing here and they all were shocked.

Didn’t those laser rays kill Lin Xiu? Why did he suddenly appear here?

Some warriors were startled at this time.

“I’m fine.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

At this time, the others also found that Lin Xiu was indeed not dead and recovered from the panic just now.

“Now this device should be destroyed.”

The rest of the warriors looked over at the gate and indeed all the devices above were destroyed.

In the past, there would not be such a terrifying laser ray shooting out.

But I don’t know if there will be other trapss.

At this time, these people did not dare to go there.

“I’ll go take a look.”

Chen Dong was silent for a while, then said aloud.

He took a deep breath and walked straight ahead.

Soon, he walked to the huge door.

As soon as he exerted force on his hands, he was about to open the huge door.

crackling-

But at this moment, a large amount of lightning burst out and all of Chen Dong’s body was immediately covered by lightning!

“what!!!”

Chen Dong roared and in the next moment, the whole person flew out.

Lin Xiu quickly caught his body.

“Are you okay.”

There are still many electric lights on his body, which are transmitted to Lin Xiu’s body.

But Lin Xiu was not affected at all.

“I’m… I’m okay...” Chen Dong’s body trembled at this time.

There was a strong electric light on the gate, which made his body feel intense pain.

If he hadn’t received anti-shock training since he was a child, the current just now would have directly electrocuted him.

The rest of the warriors also heaved a sigh of relief, thankful that they did not go over.

“Let me do it.”

After Lin Xiu asked other warriors to support Chen Dong, he walked directly to the gate.
