Chapter 725 The Fight

“Look! The exit! We finally found the exit!”

At the same time, the other warriors arrived

as well.

As they got into the palace, these people were distracted by the mountains of gold coins, weapons, combat suits as well as warrior skills cards.

However, most of the warrior skills cards were diamond grade and they didn’t find any that were purple gold.

It was indeed something that was rare.

“You brat! You made it look so real!”

Zhang Zhiheng’s eyes were not caught by the treasure that was piled up like mountains. Instead, he was looking at Lin Xiu who was standing at the centre of the palace.

Lin Xiu had returned the skeleton back to the crystal throne.

“I was just lucky.”

Lin Xiu smiled as he said.

“Hmph!”

Huang Zhiheng sneered and immediately leaped to where Lin Xiu was at.

He pulled out his machete and placed it on top of Lin Xiu’s neck.

“Hand it out! No matter what it was!”

Zhang Zhuheng said in an unfriendly tone.

Lin Xiu came much earlier than them and it was possible that he had already taken something for himself. “I didn’t take anything and all of you are already here.”

Lin Xiu said helplessly.

“You know what the consequences are for lying to me?”

Zhang Zhiheng stared into his eyes while warning Lin Xiu.

However, Lin Xiu did now show any emotions in his eyes. Zhang Zhiheng frowned. “Leave.”

Zhang Zhiheng sneered before removing the machete from Lin Xiu’s neck. Then, he walked towards the palace.

“Zhang! Are you going after the inheritance?!”

At that moment, there was another middle aged man that flew towards the palace.

“Tian Xiong, are you, the iron legions, going to fight against the God’s Punishment Guild?!”

Zhang Zhiheng looked at the huge man in front of him and asked.

“The Hunter’s Legions want the inheritance as well.”

Just as the both of them started arguing over it, the other warriors rushed towards them as well.

When they saw the skeleton sitting on the crystal throne in the centre of the palace, they knew immediately that it belonged to the warrior king

It may be possible that this is where the inheritance would take place. “Looks like we’ll have to fight it out.”

Zhang Zhiheng held onto his machete and said in a vicious look in his eyes.

The king warrior’s inheritance was something extremely important for master warriors like them.

Plus, this was the best warrior king in history and he was someone who was horrifyingly powerful when he was alive.

“You really didn’t take anything?”

When Huang Ji saw Lin XIu who was walking towards them, he asked in a cold tone.

Lin Xiu was the first one here and he didn’t get anything?

He was feeling a little suspicious.

“If I took something from here and I haven’t given it out, do you think that it’s possible for me to still be alive?”

Lin Xiu replied flatly.

Huang Ji sneered and said nothing else.

He believed Lin Xiu since if Lin Xiu did get anything from inside, Zhang Zhiheng would have noticed it.

Then, Zhang Zhuheng must have also thought that Lin Xiu was someone under Huang Ji and let Lin Xiu off so easily.

No matter what, Huang Ji already said that Lin Xiu was part of the Xuanfeng Academy.

However, Huang Ji was a little disappointed. He was actually quite happy when Zhang Zhiheng wanted to kill Lin Xiu.

“Since we’re here, take some of it with you so that we wouldn’t waste this trip.”

Huang Ji looked at the treasures around him and said to the rest of the warriors.

There were too many of them going after the inheritance and they were still fighting inside which was why none of them dared to go any closer.

The things that were outside of it were luxurious as well and most of them were quite happy with it.

When everyone else started choosing and picking what they wanted, Qian Jing walked towards Lin Xiu and said, “You brat! You even lied to me.”

“I wasn’t lying.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and smiled.

“Oh…tell me honestly, did you get the inheritance?”

Qian Jing suddenly thought of it. He took a look around before asking Lin Xiu in a soft tone. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Is the inheritance something that great?”

Lin Xiu smiled and pointed at the warriors who were still fighting in the palace.

“Those are warrior masters. Not people who I can fight.”

“Stop pretending and we can still be friends.”

Qian Jing said to Lin Xiu.

He had a very strong instinct and he could clearly feel now that there were minor changes that has happened to Lin Xiu.

It was so minor that if he didn’t pay much attention to Lin Xiu, no one would figure it out.

He must have gotten something.

Qian Jing was sure about his assumptions.

“Forget it. If you’re not picking anything, I’ll

go.”

“I’m in need of a good warrior skill.”

As Lin Xiu spoke to Qian Jing, he walked towards the stack of warrior skills cards that gathered together like small mountains.

“Liar! Lie to me then.”

Qian Jing had a head full of questions while looking at Lin Xiu.

There were lots of warriors who were busy looking for something that would suit them as well.

Although the purple gold card was priceless, these warriors knew that they didn’t have the abilities to fight warrior masters.

These diamond graded warrior skill cards were good enough for them.

There were too many of them and it consists of all categories. This place was like a treasure hunt.

“En…..nothing seems to be suitable.”

Lin Xiu looked for it before mumbling to himself.

Plus, after learning about the purple gold card, Lin Xiu had already lost interest in these diamond grade warrior skills cards.

He didn’t even want any of these warrior skills cards.

Huang Ji looked at Lin Xiu and he was still suspicious.

But, by how Lin Xiu was still eagerly looking for a card, it doesn’t look as if he had gotten the inheritance.

If he had gotten it, he would no longer be interested in the diamond grade warrior skills card.

Was he wrong about it?

Huang Ji shook his head and looked at the palace.

Those people were still fighting. He might be interested in the inheritance as well but there was more than one powerful warrior master there and he wouldn’t be able to fight all of them at once.

Although it was a waste, he still appreciated his life and he lost the interest in fighting for the inheritance.

“I already said that the inheritance belongs to

me!”

Soon, Zhang Zhiheng had already grabbed onto the long sword that was on the skeleton that sat on the crystal throne.

As for the warriors who were next to him, all of them were now covered in blood and there was also blood all over the ground.

“Looks like you won all of us.”

The rest of warriors were still panting on the ground.
