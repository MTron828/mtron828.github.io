1474 True Form of the Tool Spirit

“Just believe in him.”

This was the only thing that Tianling God King could say.

Sky Eye was indeed someone incredibly powerful.

Even with his abilities, he would be no match for Sky Eye.

But, Lin Xiu seemed to have become much more powerful than him.

Boom boom – –

At the same time, there were countless explosions that followed.

The outer layer of earth has been completely destroyed.

There were rocks and debris that floated into the galaxy.

“Ahhhhh!!!!”

However, even with the attack from the energy that Sky Eye released, Lin Xiu was still alive!

He let out a loud roar.

His entire body was now golden in colour.

Golden Body of Immortality!

Lin Xiu could now use this skill endlessly.

Plus, he would be able to move while using it unlike before!

However, even so, this skill wasn’t enough to prevent all the damage caused from the attack.

After all, Sky Eye was as powerful as the True God.

Lin Xiu did manage to survive the attack and Sky Eye stopped attacking him as well. He finally closed his mouth.

“Looks like it’s true that you got his inheritance.”

Sky Eye looked at Lin Xiu and laughed.

His voice was loud and it travelled across the entire planet.

However, Lin Xiu would only be the only person on earth that could hear this.

He was now the size of a normal human being.

Boom – –

He then leaped off from the cracks in the sky.

As he landed, there was a loud voice.

Lin Xiu grabbed onto his long spear tightly and stared at Sky Eye who returned to the ground.

Sky Eye’s skin was of a copper tone.

His entire body seemed to be filled with limitless energy.

“So that’s Sky Eye…”

Tianling God King may have heard of him but he has never seen the real Sky Eye.

With the circle that Luo Yue had drawn in the air, they could clearly see that Sky Eye was now standing on Earth’s ground.

As for Lin Xiu, his entire body had turned gold.

Luo Yue couldn’t help but clenched her fist together.

She really wanted to fight side by side with Lin Xiu but with her current abilities, she would only be a burden to him.

“Tianling!”

At the same time, there were even more God Kings that appeared.

“All of you are here?”

Tianling God King looked up.

All of the leaders from the Warrior God Realm were gathered here!

“We heard that Sky Eye has returned?”

All of the God Kings gathered on the ground.

“En. He’s on earth now.”

Tianling God King nodded his head.

Then, all of the God Kings then looked over at the circle that Luo Yue drew in the air.

It was showing the scene back on earth.

“It’s true that he’s back…”

The God Kings all had horrible looks on their faces.

Sky Eye…. This counterfeit of the True God was indeed powerful.

He was also a cruel man and has killed countless God Kings.

As they thought of the past, all of them felt troubled.

“I heard that Sky Eye has once said that if he becomes the True God, he will destroy all living things in this galaxy.”

One of the God King looked worried.

Although no one knew if this was true, Sky Eye was still trouble after all.

If he had indeed gotten hands on more powerful energy and became the True God, then they would all be in trouble.

“None of us would be his match.”

Tianling God King sighed.

From the scene happening right now, it was obvious that Sky Eye was domineering.

“Even the flame of chaos didn’t do any damage to him?”

Riyan God Lord had his eyes fixed on the circle and he was beyond shocked.

He had personally witnessed how terrifying these flames were.

However, the Flames of Chaos that Lin Xiu had released didn’t seem to have much effect on Sky Eye.

All of the God Kings were focused on the match happening before them.

Lin Xiu has to win this fight!

“I don’t want to kill you so quickly.”

Sky Eye had a hideous smile on his face as he looked at Lin Xiu.

Then, as he reached out his left hand, there was a gap sliced open in the space around them.

A huge weapon appeared from the gap.

Soon, Sky Eye had a huge halberd on his hands.

There were countless peculiar looking marks on the halberd.

With the weapon, Lin Xiu could feel a different wave of energy that appeared in the air around him. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Huuuuuu~

Lin Xiu started panting.

It was incredibly difficult to defend against this bastard.

Sky Eye was indeed powerful.

The entire planet was about to explode into a million pieces.

“Flush all of the energy in your body into your weapon!”

Suddenly, the Dark Edge vibrated and Lin Xiu could hear Zhu Long’s voice.

Lin Xiu was stunned for a second when he heard the voice.

But, he quickly came back to his senses.

He gathered the energy in his body and drained it into the spear.

“It’s not enough!!!”

Zhu Long’s voice was heard once again.

Lin Xiu furrowed his brow and pushed more energy into it.

Boom – –

Then, the entire spear started glowing brightly in a scarlet colour!

What’s this?!

Lin Xiu’s eyes were wide open.

“Continue!”

Zhu Long’s voice appeared once again and then there was a spirit energy that suddenly spreaded all through the spear!

A figure of a snake with a human face appeared from the spear.

Lin Xiu could now feel that the spear was much heavier than before.

The entire spear was also now covered with overpowering energy!

This….was the true powers of a tool spirit!

“A tool spirit!!!”

Back at the Warrior God Realm, the God Kings started getting excited.

The tool spirit was now incorporated with Lin Xiu’s weapon!

“This is his chance!”

From the appearance of it, it was obvious that the spear was now an incredibly powerful weapon.

“Zhu Long, did you really think that you are the only tool spirit?”

Sky Eye noticed Zhu Long and he sneered.

Then, there was a blue energy that surrounded his halberd as well!

What was that ?!

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank subconsciously.

Soon, there was a huge monster with a human face that appeared above Sky Eye’s weapon!
