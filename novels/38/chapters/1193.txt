1194 Provocation

At this time, as a voice came over, Lin Xiu could clearly see that a warrior was already standing on the battle platform in the middle.

The battle was starting soon.

Lin Xiu watched the battle on the battlefield with great interest.

These younger generations of warriors were quite strong, most of them were warriors at the level of Sage warrior.

And among them, there were also those of the God warrior level.

This made Lin Xiu even more surprised.

Originally, he thought he had the upgrade system to upgrade quickly enough, but he never thought that there were still many geniuses in this world.

Especially those warriors who were born in this God warrior Realm.

Since they were born, they had enjoyed the best resources. In addition, the source energy of the God warrior Realm was very abundant. Their cultivation speed was countless times faster than that of the warriors on Earth and even on the Namir planet.

“Are you the city lord of Lingxian City?”

Just as Lin Xiu was watching the battle over there, a voice came from the other side.

Lin Xiu subconsciously took a look and found a warrior standing behind him.

The battle uniform this man was wearing was somewhat similar to Fu Tianyuan’s, both with special and intricate patterns.

And he also looked somewhat similar to Fu Tianyuan.

Could it be, Fu Tianyuan’s younger brother?

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something and his eyes narrowed slightly.

“En.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Fu Tianling?”

Sun Ruo and Ling Yu clearly knew this man and their expressions changed slightly when they saw him approach.

Because they all knew that this person was not easy to get along with.

“I heard that your Lingxian City didn’t bring the younger generation of warriors this time.”

Fu Tianling quickly walked in front of Lin Xiu and said with a faint smile.

It’s just that his smile, no matter how you look at it, seemed like there was a dagger hidden in it, which made people feel a little uncomfortable.

“So.”

Lin Xiu raised his brows.

Fu Tianling, this was definitely Fu Tianyuan’s younger brother.

Thinking of what Mr. Lu said in the underground arena before, if he was right, the boss behind the underground arena is this person.

Is this for revenge?

“Is it because there is no one in your Lingxian City, or you don’t give our Manhuang City face?”

Fu Tianling’s eyes narrowed slightly and there was a wicked look in his eyes.

Of course he now knows that the one who destroyed the underground arena yesterday was Lin Xiu.

If he wanted to deal with Lin Xiu, he could have done it yesterday.

But he was in no hurry.

Because for him, trying to get rid of Lin Xiu is as easy as pinching an ant to death.

“Our warriors in Lingxian City can’t beat them.”

Lin Xiu showed a look of ‘modesty’.

“Is that so.”

“It is said that Lingxian City was created by Bai Lingxian. Bai Lingxian back then was invincible.”

“I didn’t expect that the current city lord is actually a waste.”

Fu Tianling looked very pitiful.

Sun Ruo and Ling Yu frowned when they heard Fu Tianling’s insulting words.

He looked at Lin Xiu, but found that Lin Xiu didn’t seem to care at all.

Fu Tianling was waiting to see Lin Xiu’s angry expression.

But Lin Xiu was holding the teacup and drinking tea slowly, not looking angry at all.

This made Fu Tianling’s brows wrinkle.

“Dare to go to the platform?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

At this time, Fu Tianling put his hands on the table and stared at Lin Xiu with a stern expression.

“Go to the platform?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows.

“Yes, I think you are of a suitable age. I’ll give you a chance, sir, do you dare to come up?”

Fu Tianling said with a wicked smile.

At this time, there is no need for him to pretend.

“As long as you get the first place, you can get this God warrior-level skill Card.”

“And as the city lord, you can get an extra one.”

“That’s right, two God warrior-level skill Cards.”

Fu Tianling said, trying to lure Lin Xiu.

“Mr. Fu, according to the rules, the city lord is not allowed to participate.”

Although Ling Yu was a little displeased with Fu Tianling, he still said respectfully at this time.

“Shut up.”

Fu Tianling glared at him fiercely.

“I am the rule.”

Although Ling Yu’s face was a little upset, he didn’t dare to say anything at this time.

This is the land of the Manhuang City and he is the younger brother of Fu Tianyuan, the City Lord of the Manhuang City.

So even if he was upset, he couldn’t say anything.

“So, do you dare?”

Fu Tianling said with a smile at this time.

“Lin Xiu, ignore this guy.”

Baili Haoling said coldly at this time.

Since Fu Tianling dared to say so, there must be some conspiracy.

Who knows if he will face powerful warriors after he goes on the platform.

At that time, it will be troublesome.

After all, Baili Haoling already knew the rules of going to the platform.

As long as you get on the platform, life or death didn’t matter.

“Yo, where’s this young lady from, she looks good.”

It was only at this time that Fu Tianling noticed Baili Haoling.

At this moment, Baili Haoling had pigtails and looked like a young and beautiful girl, which was quite attractive.

As he spoke, he reached out his hand to touch Baili Haoling’s cheek.

Pa–

But at this moment, Lin Xiu reached out and grabbed his wrist.

Fu Tianling’s face changed slightly, the source strength of his body burst out and he was about to break free.

But at this time, he discovered that the source strength in his body seemed to be bound by an invisible force.

He couldn’t use his own source strength at all.

What exactly is going on!?

“I’ll go up.”

Lin Xiu exerted a little force and while releasing his wrist, he caused him to take a few steps back.

“very good.”

Seeing Lin Xiu agree, Fu Tianling didn’t think too much and showed a sneer.

As long as he dares to go up the platform, he will surely die!

“Lin Xiu!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s agreement, Baili Haoling’s expression changed.

This was obviously a conspiracy!

Even a fool knows – how could Manhuang City give you the god warrior cards so kindly, not to mention two cards!

On the battlefield, you will definitely have to face a formidable opponent.

If you are not careful, you will die!

“Don’t worry, the strength of the warriors here is average.”

Lin Xiu said with a smile.

When Sun Ruo and Ling Yu heard Lin Xiu’s confident words, they could not help shaking their heads.

Too proud, there were some in this younger generation who were not inferior to the strength of the city lord.,

Besides, Lin Xiu is still so young, even if he reaches the level of a God warrior, he will not be much stronger than other God warriors of the younger generation.

“Everyone, listen up!”

At this time, Fu Tianling walked to the center.

“I now allow the city lord of the Lingxian City to go up the platform and compete with the younger generation of warriors.”

As soon as his words fell, there was an uproar around him.

Without waiting for the other warriors to speak, he continued to say, “You probably haven’t heard of Lingxian City, it’s a small town in the northwest region and the age of the city lord and the younger generation you brought is pretty much the same.”

“He’s even younger.”
