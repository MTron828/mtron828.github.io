1251 Energy Barrier Completed

“I saw you staying in for a whole day the day before yesterday, so I wanted to come over and take a look. When I came in, I saw you sitting cross-legged on the ground, motionless.”

Baili Haoling said helplessly.

She thought that Lin Xiu was cultivating and she didn’t wake him up.

However, it was already the third day and she came back to have a look because she was afraid of something unexpected happening to Lin Xiu.

“Didn’t you see the black energy around me?”

Lin Xiu seemed to think of something, subconsciously said.

“Black energy?”

Baili Haoling was taken aback for a moment, then shook her head after thinking about it carefully.

She came to Lin Xiu’s room before and saw that he was sitting cross-legged and there was no dark energy on his body.

“Don’t tell me… you engulfed that black ball?”

Baili Haoling seemed to have thought of something at this time, looked at Lin Xiu suspiciously and said.

But Lin Xiu doesn’t seem to have changed much now, so it shouldn’t be possible.

That thing is too weird. If you Engulf it hastily, it will most likely cause irreparable consequences.

“Yes.”

Lin Xiu nodded.

“Oh… what did you say!?”

Baili Haoling nodded, then came back to her senses and her eyes widened.

“You really Engulfed this black ball!?”

“Yes.”

Lin Xiu spread his hands helplessly.

He didn’t know why, but he suddenly engulfed the black ball.

But fortunately, with the existence of a system, this energy didn’t have any bad influence on him.

Of course, there was no good influence either.

“Didn’t die?”

Baili Haoling stared at Lin Xiu with wide eyes.

“What are you talking about?”

Lin Xiu was speechless for a while, with black lines all over his head.

“Ahem, I just care about you.”

At this time, Baili Haoling coughed deliberately in embarrassment.

But soon she opened her eyes wide and looked at Lin Xiu.

“It seems that nothing has changed…”

“Do you feel anything?”

Although she didn’t know what the black ball was, what was certain is that this black ball has extremely strong energy.

“Nothing has changed.”

Speaking of this, Lin Xiu was also extremely upset.

This black ball obviously possesses extremely strong energy. It took him so long to use his system skill ‘Engulf’ to absorb all the energy.

But he didn’t gain any experience?

And there wasn’t any special changes in his body.

“This is really strange.”

Baili Haoling thought at this time.

Boom, boom, boom——

But at this moment, the whole ground shook suddenly.

what happened?

Feeling the vibration on the ground, Lin Xiu frowned.

This tremor is not like an ordinary natural earthquake.

“It should be Lei Tong, he must have built the energy barrier.”

“He’s been experimenting over there for the past two days, always making this kind of earthquake.”

Baili Haoling seemed to know something and said at this time.

“Come on, let’s go out and have a look.”

Lin Xiu said directly.

After walking out with Baili Haoling, he could clearly feel that the earthquakes were shaking more frequently.

It seemed that the whole ground was shaking crazily.

If it weren’t for the well-built buildings, Lin Xiu felt that his City Lord’s Mansion would collapse.

Without thinking too much, Lin Xiu flew up at this time and flew towards the workshop on the north side of the City Lord’s Mansion.

...

The workshop built for Lei Tong was over there.

Looking carefully at this time, there was a huge machine in that workshop, which was emitting a bright light at this moment.

This machine slowly drilled into the ground.

It was because this huge machine was constantly drilling into the ground that it made the whole ground vibrate crazily.

Lei Tong stood in front of the machine, watching it continuously drill into the ground, showing an extremely excited expression.

“Finally completed! Finally completed…”

He was now excitedly muttering to himself.

In this huge machine, there was already an energy core composed of hundreds of god-level odd crystals.

And after this machine enters the ground, it will link up with the machines on the walls of Lingxian City to build an energy barrier.

“City Lord!”

At this moment, Lei Tong, who was extremely excited, saw a black shadow flying towards him and was startled.

...

After seeing Lin Xiu’s face clearly, he immediately said respectfully.

“how’s it going?”

Lin Xiu flew to Lei Tong’s side, looked at this strange machine that looked like a huge missile head and kept drilling into the ground and said in surprise.

“Once this machine enters the ground, the energy barrier system will be considered fully constructed.”

Lei Tong said.

“done?”

And Baili Haoling also flew over at this time.

Seeing that the machine had sunk into the ground, she was surprised.

“Well, one hundred god-level odd crystals were used as the power core and this machine also has the effect of recycling. These hundred odd crystals, even if the energy barrier is turned on all the time, can last at least one year!”

Lei Tong suppressed his excitement and said.

Being able to continuously deploy the energy barrier for one year, it is already considered very good.

“However, we must send someone to take care of this place. Otherwise, if someone attacks inside and destroys the power core, the energy barrier system will also be destroyed.”

Lei Tong said solemnly.

The power core of this machine is made up of a hundred god-level odd crystals. Anyone who knows it will be crazy about it.

It will be troublesome if it is dug out by someone.

“No one will be able to take it out.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

At this moment, all the strength of his body burst out.

Then it surged on Lin Xiu’s right hand.

With a wave of Lin Xiu’s right hand, the burst of source strength rushed towards the machine that had been embedded in the ground.

Soon, the machine was surrounded by a large amount of white light. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

These white lights quickly formed special patterns.

Divine mark.

“this is…”

When Lei Tong saw this scene, he was taken aback.

“I wonder how strong this energy barrier is…”

Lin Xiu watched the machine wrapped in divine marks continue to sink into the ground and subconsciously said.

“I can assure you that no one can shake this energy barrier!”

Speaking of this, Lei Tong was full of confidence.

“Is it.”

Lin Xiu frowned.

After about an hour, the vibrations on the ground began to disappear.

A large amount of soil buried the hole created by the machine.

“It can be unfolded.”

Lei Tong held a special small remote control and pressed a small red button on it.

Woo woo woo——

As he pressed the button, in the next moment, the entire Lingxian City seemed to make a sound like the sound of a whistle.

Lin Xiu, who was flying in the sky, looked around the entire Lingxian City and he was able to see a purple energy barrier began to appear slowly in the surroundings of Lingxian City!
