Chapter 668: Leave

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

At this time, Lin Xiu and Ye Kai had already left the Luo family.

“This way.”

Ye Kai led Lin Xiu to an alley.

Now that the entire Sky City is under martial law, many people are looking for Lin Xiu.

With Ye Kai leading, Lin Xiu circled left and right, and soon came to a building.

“This is...”

After Lin Xiu walked into the house, he could clearly see that there were all kinds of things around.

And there were still a lot of people doing cleaning here.

No, these are not ‘humans, they are all intelligent robots!

“This is my base in Sky City.”

Ye Kai smiled at Lin Xiu and said.

Lin Xiu nodded, then sat on the chair beside him.

“Lwant to go to Marqi planet.”

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then said to Ye Kai.

“No problem.”

Ye Kai said.

“Lhave already contacted one of our people at the airport, and he will bring you out.”

“But before leaving, I have to disguise you first.”

Lin Xiu was startled, then nodded.

Under the current circumstances, if he went out by himself, he would be easily discovered by the federal police and the three major families. At that time, he would be in deep trouble.

Now his important skills were all on cooldown, in this state, he couldn’t deal with anyone at all.

Soon, with Ye Kai’s disguise, Lin Xiu suddenly looked like another person.

Moreover, Ye Kai had already prepared forged information, and even changed his fingerprints.

“During the iris verification, you can rest assured that you will go through – we have one of us there.”

After doing all this, Ye Kai said to Lin Xiu.

At this time, Lin Xiu was standing in front of a floor-to-ceiling mirror. After a closer look, he could clearly see that his current appearance was different from before.

The current Lin Xiu looked like a middle-aged man who has experienced many vicissitudes.

“Your weapons, I’ll get someone to transport them there directly.”

Ye Kai continued to speak.

After all, there were only a few warriors who used spears, and Lin Xiu’s weapons were so unique that they could easily be discovered.

“Well, shall I go now?”

Lin Xiu said after looking at his current state at this time – no one would probably find out.

“En, I’ll take the young master to the airport. Just go in directly. The ticket has already been bought.”

Just now, Ye Kai had already booked a plane ticket to Marqi Planet for Lin Xiu.

After going out, Ye Kai and Lin Xiu took the maglev car to the airport in Sky City.

Not long after the car drove out, a few federal police officers with laser guns waved to Ye Kai, who was driving the car, and motioned him to stop.

“What’s up?”

Ye Kai calmly stopped the car and spoke to the federal police officers.

“It’s okay, go on.”

After the few federal police officers carefully looked at Ye Kai and Lin Xiu’s faces, they waved their hands and said.

At this time, Ye Kai continued to drive the maglev car, and left.

Sitting in the passenger seat, Lin Xiu looked at the scene outside through the car window, and could clearly see that there were quite a few federal police officers walking around.

And if you take a closer look, you can also see that there are many powerful warriors on the street that were probably dispatched by the three major families to find Lin Xiu.

“Damn, these guys are really nasty!”

At the same time, in the building of the Sacred Region Academy in Sky City, Baili Haoling said angrily.

After she woke up early in the morning, she knew the news. Seeing that the people from the three major families said that Lin Xiu maliciously killed the elders in their clan, Baili Haoling knew that these people must have failed to ambush Lin Xiu and deliberately find excuses.

But it was indeed Lin Xiu who killed their people at the scene, and Lin Xiu disappeared, and with the strength of the three major families, Lin Xiu has undoubtedly become the target of public criticism.

“Lin Xiu’s in danger now.”

At this time, Ouyang Hang also appeared and said.

Originally, the team that won today was going to prepare for the Global Finals, but at this time, it was obviously not suitable.

“Grandpa, can you help Lin Xiu?”

Bai Litao sat on a chair and watched the news of the wanted Lin Xiu broadcast on the news. At this time, he couldn’t help but stroke his beard.

“Can’t be helped.”

At this time, Bai Litao shook his head and said aloud.

The people of the three major families joined forces, and since this was still Sky City, with the strength of the Sacred Region Academy, it was still impossible to intervene.

“Then we’re just going to watch Lin Xiu being taken away by them!?”

Baili Haoling’s eyes widened, looking at her grandfather very dissatisfied and said aloud.

“Don’t worry, I can feel that Lin Xiu should be fine.”

At this time, Bai Litao continued to touch his beard and said aloud.

“And now in this situation, do you think we can intervene?”

Having said this, Bai Litao suddenly looked a little helpless.

“Tm going to find my ancestor.”

Baili Haoling still said angrily.

“They have already left.”

Just as Baili Haoling walked out of the door, Baili Tao said aloud.

“Left?”

Baili Haoling, who just walked out, was stunned.

“En, that one is here too.”

At this time, Bai Litao said meaningfully.

“And he said that he had met Lin Xiu and thought Lin Xiu was good.”

“Really?”

Baili Haoling was pleasantly surprised at this time. If this is the case, it means that Lin Xiu will definitely be fine.

“En, you guys better prepare for the global finals, I just received a notification that there are many powerful rank 9 evolved beasts in the United States now destroying everything, so now the finals have been temporarily stopped, and will be held next year.”

Bai Litao continued. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Next year...”

“Lin Xiu should be back next year, right?”

‘When Ouyang Hang heard Bai Litao’s voice, he mumbled to himself at this time.

At this moment, Lin Xiu, under the escort of Ye Kai’s maglev car, quickly arrived at the airport in Sky City.

“Go, someone will pick you up.”

Ye Kai stopped the car and said to Lin Xiu.

“En”

Lin Xiu nodded, then walked out.

“Thank you, Uncle Ye.”

‘When Lin Xiu was about to leave, he stopped and said to Ye Kai.

Ye Kai shook his head, stating that he was just doing what he should.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and walked over to the front.

Starting today, he would be leaving the earth...

On the side of the aviation airport in Sky City, there were a lot of people coming in and out.

As soon as Lin Xiu walked in, he saw that there were federal police officers inspecting..
