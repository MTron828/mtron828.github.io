Chapter 122: Hermit Worm

“AH!!!” The man had his arm ripped off.

The immense pain prevented him from avoiding the worm. In the next moment, he felt his vision go black as his entire being was swallowed up by the Hermit Worm.

“Oh my god!” The man that had rushed over with Chen Kun was in immense shock and immediately turned tail to run. The Hermit Worm shot forward quickly with the intent of eating him.

“Be careful!” The man called Zhang Yin was roughly 20 years old with a braided beard. He moved extremely quickly and saved his subordinate before leaping to the other side.

The remaining guy and girl behind Lin Xiu had pale faces, they did not expect that the thing was alive!

Not only was it alive, but it was also still extremely powerful.

“You did this intentionally!” The tan lady beside the large man glared at Lin Xiu with rage.

“You clearly knew it was alive, why didn’t you say a thing!”

“I already said that it is my prey.” Lin Xiu replied indifferently.

“You…!” The large man erupted with rage and rushed forward. He wanted to attack Lin Xiu, but a light aura flashed and a spear tip appeared right at his throat.

The large man was startled as he felt his body turn cold.

What kind of horrifying speed was that?

“Why aren’t you guys running! This won’t be easy for us to fight against!” After saving his subordinate, Zhang Yin was already running away as the Hermit Worm rushed forward again!

Lin Xiu glanced at him and suddenly turned and saw the Hermit Worm that was already very near. With its extremely large body, its mouth looked like an abyss.

Lin Xiu did not reveal any fear in front of it. He held his spear tightly and swept it down with a few slashes. Phoenixes danced and flew into the Hermit Worm’s mouth.

Siiiii-

It unleashed a wail as it felt the pain from before.

The Hermit Worm had tough and hard skin and ordinary weapons could not penetrate it. Its large body also made stabbing at it inconvenient. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Lin Xiu decided to attack with Awe of the Phoenix and let the blazing birds fly into the mouth and destroy it from within.

“What skill is that…” Zhang Yin and the others had already retreated far away.

Although they were rank 3 warriors, they did not have any thoughts about attacking the overly massive Hermit Worm.

They knew they could never kill such a thing with their skills. The slightest mistake might even cost them their lives.

But Lin Xiu remained in his place and continued to slash down with his spear to produce phoenixes. They had never seen such a unique skill before.

The Hermit Worm opened its mouth with the intent of swallowing Lin Xiu but the phoenixes flew out again and the pain forced it to retreat.

Right at this moment, it turned and decided to drill down into the sand to escape.

“Want to run?”

Lin Xiu sneered and charged forward!

Torrential storm of rose flowers!!!!

He leaped upwards and his speartip transformed into many small cold light auras and penetrated into the hermit worm’s body, producing many small bloodied holes!

Although the hermit worm’s skin was tough, Dark Edge could be considered a legendary weapon. Although it was not the peak grade, its sharpness was at an extraordinary level.

After using Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers to stab and open many bloody holes, Lin Xiu unleashed Awe of the Phoenix!

All the fire flew into the holes!

Rumble-

Following the rumbling, the hermit worm’s body started to swell. The head that was about to drill its way into the sand suddenly raised upwards as a large number of flames spewed out from its mouth.

Gugugu-

A strange sound started to come out from its body as it stiffened up. Right after that, it laid limp on the ground.

Smoke emerged from its mouth.

“Whew.” Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief, then approached its corpse. Warriors had to destroy such creatures from the inside for full effectiveness.

It should be dead now.

Lin Xiu sized up the corpse then used the spear to aim at a part of its body and stabbed in. A golden rank 4 odd crystal was dug up by Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu would not be polite with things his body required.

“He…killed the hermit worm by himself?” The group was stunned.

They felt that Lin Xiu’s aura was weak and did not look like a strong warrior. But in the next moment, the strength he had unveiled scared them.

“Expert, he is definitely an expert.” Zhang Yin became solemn and spoke up.

“It’s said that when high-rank warriors train to a certain stage, they can even revert their bodies to look young.”

Upon hearing Zhang Yin’s words, they all inhaled in cold air, rejoicing at the fact that they did not clash with Lin Xiu.

And Lin Xiu looked extremely young like a high school student. They did not believe that a high school student would be so strong and thus believed Zhang Yin’s words.

“But the Hermit Worm’s teeth are extremely important to Lin Li’s weapon.” The large man hesitated for a moment before speaking.

“I will negotiate with him.” Zhang Yin nodded his head and walked towards Lin Xiu.

“You still want it?” Lin Xiu saw him walk over and frowned. He immediately raised the golden odd crystal in his hand.

Be it warriors or evolved beasts, plundering and killing were common in Path of Death. So when Lin Xiu saw the man walking over, he sneered at him.

Although the three of them were rank 3 warriors, he felt that he could take them on.

He had Gene Lock and his body’s composition was different from ordinary warriors.

“No, Senior, you’ve misunderstood.” Zhang Yin chuckled bitterly and replied earnestly.

Senior?

Lin Xiu was stunned, and upon recalling that his appearance was that of a youth but his skills might look incredibly powerful to them, they might have mistaken that he only looked young.
