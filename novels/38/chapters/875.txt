Chapter 876: The Encounter

As he continued his journey, Lin Xiu felt as if he was walking into an old forest.

The trees around him were huge and it was so tall that it covered the sky.

No matter if it was the grass or the flowers, all of them looked much bigger than it was on earth.

Crack – –

Lin Xiu was sitting cross legged on the ground, cultivating and there was a weird noise coming from his body.

This was because his body was slowly turning bigger and taller.

Lin Xiu finally opened his eyes and stood up.

His height now was originally 1.8 metres but now it has already become more than 2 metres.

His height was almost the same as those on Nanor Planet.

“This way.....I should look the same.”

Lin Xiu looked at his body before mumbling to himself. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

With his abilities now, it wasn’t a difficult issue for him to change his own height.

He will be entering the cities soon and this would cause lesser troubles.

Suddenly, there was a loud rustling noise that came from behind.

Lin Xiu turned towards the direction from where the noise was coming from and noticed a huge shadow.

Lin Xiu frowned.

He narrowed his eyes so that he could get a clearer picture.

Hong – –

Soon, he saw that there was a huge creature that looked like a wild boar on earth, that was running toward him.

The creature was so huge that it looked like a little mountain.

There were two fangs on both side of his mouth that were extremely sharp.

It was coming toward Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu remained standing and he did not move. When the huge evolved beast was in front of him, Lin Xiu raised his leg and gave it a good kick on the head!

Koong Loong – –

The huge evolved beast instantly landed on the thick trunk behind it and it immediately broke the tree into two.

“Where’s the mutant flaming pig?!”

At the same time, there was a man’s voice that came from the other side.

When he took a closer look, there were a few muscular warriors that were looking for the evolved beast.

“It’s here!”

One of the men who is much taller than the rest saw the evolved beast that was lying on the ground. He was shocked to see what had happened to it.

The rest of them went towards it as well.

The mutant flaming pig that was huge was now lying on the ground and it was wailing in pain.

Its body was shaking uncontrollably and it looked like the creature could no longer move.

“Who are you?!”

Then, they noticed Lin Xiu who was standing opposite them. It had frightened them to see another man in the forest.

“Was he the one that attacked the mutant flaming pig?”

One of them seemed to be reminded of something and looked at Lin Xiu in shock.

“Young man, this is our prey! You better stay out of it.”

One of them, who was wearing luxurious clothes, came up to Lin Xiu and spoke in an unfriendly manner.

“Qian Feng, don’t say that”

Before Lin Xiu could react, a young girl from behind them frowned and spoke up instead.

Compared to the rest of them, she looked slightly smaller but she was at least 2 metres tall.

If it was compared to the standards back on earth, she was definitely a very tall girl.

“Hmph.” The man called Qian Feng sneered when he heard what the girl said.

“Hello, I’m Zhao Xiaoqing.”

The woman walked towards Lin Xiu and smiled.

“Lin Xiu.”

Lin Xiu replied to her with a faint smile on his face.

He just arrived on Nanor Planet and there were still loads that he didn’t understand. It was not the right time for him to cause any trouble with these people.

It would be best if he could get something useful from them.

“Did you do this?”

Zhao Xiaoqing was looking curious.

They were hunting down this mutant flaming pig. Although they have harmed it, they still couldn’t hurt it badly enough where it just laid on the ground motionlessly.

Lin Xiu did not say much and just nodded his head.

“Xiaoqing, don’t listen to him. This pig only ended up in this state because of our attacks.”

Qian Feng said in a cold tone.

“It’s here. There’s a small cut on the pig’s head.”

Another man was already standing next to the mutant flaming pig and his eyes were locked onto it. He was covered in shock when he saw what had happened to their prey.

This was because there was a dented footprint on the pig’s forehead.

They could even see the pig’s skull from the dent.

It has to be noted that this mutant flaming pig was a king rank evolved beast. Even with their sharpest weapon, they still failed to cause an open wound on it.

But this cut....it looks like someone kicked it on its head.

The rest of the warriors gathered around the pig and all of them were shocked as well.

“Let me see.” Zhao Xiaoqing walked towards the pig and when she saw the cut, her eyes widened in shock.

Qing Feng, on the other hand, looked awful.

The power of that kick has already clearly shown how powerful the person was.

“Lin Xiu, could we have a negotiation? Can you sell this evolved beast to us?”

Zhao Xiaoqing hesitated for a while before asking Lin Xiu.

The only reason why she was out here was so that she could get this evolved beast.

“You can have it.”

Lin Xiu said with a monotonous tone.

Although this was a king rank evolved beast, it still wouldn’t give much to Lin Xiu.

“”Brat!! What do you think you’re doing?!”

Qian Feng was furious as he glared at Lin Xiu.

The rest of them looked unhappy as well after hearing what Qian Feng had asked.

This was a king rank evolved beast. Forget about the odd crystals that they could get, he would still be able to get money from selling its body.

However, this man was saying that they could just take it without giving anything in return and they were feeling suspicious.

“Are you serious?”

Zhao Xiaoqing thought that it was unbelievable as well but for some reason, she didn’t think that Lin Xiu was an evil person.

“Perhaps... you can help me.”

Lin Xiu was feeling a little helpless as he asked.

“What do you need?”

Zhao Xiaoqing asked in return.

“Help me get to Aoshuang City?”

Lin Xiu stated.

Although he could get to the city with the map, the road ahead was winding and was filled with tall, thick forest which made it difficult.

Lin Xiu thought that it was a little difficult to get to Aoshuang City on his own.

“Aoshuang City? You want to head to Aoshuang City?”

Zhao Xiaoqing looked a little surprised when she heard what Lin Xiu wanted.

“What’s wrong?”

Lin Xiu was feeling confused.

“We....are from Aoshuang City.”

Zhao Xiaoqing looked at Lin Xiu.

“Guys! Don’t you think that this is such a coincidence? I have a feeling that this brat already knows our plan and is trying to get close to us intentionally!”
