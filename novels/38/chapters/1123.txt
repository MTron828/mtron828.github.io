Chapter 1124: Forbidden Area

The two warriors clearly felt the breeze blowing and frowned immediately.

They looked around cautiously.

But at this time, there was no trace of anyone at all.

“We’re overthinking, no one will come here.”

One of the warriors said aloud.

“Maybe.”

The other warrior nodded at this time.

After all, they didn’t find anything and it was normal for the wind to blow occasionally.

“It’s quite big…”

At this time, Lin Xiu had already entered the inner courtyard of the Bai family.

Just now, Lin Xiu used the ‘Flashing Souls’ body skill and entered.

When Lin Xiu’s body skill was in motion, it was like teleportation, so these warriors did not catch Lin Xiu’s figure at all.

At this time, the analytic eye glanced over and even the surrounding areas with surveillance were all scanned.

Lin Xiu kept using the ‘Flashing Souls’ body skill, perfectly dodging all the monitored positions.

The Bai residence covers a very large area. The whole place was like a small city.

As for the location of the holy water, judging from the information Lin Xiu got, it should be right here.

The so-called forbidden area of ??the Bai family.

Except for the head of the Bai family, ordinary Bai family members cannot enter this place.

And at the gate of this forbidden area, there were eight powerful sage warriors, who are guarding.

“Who is it!?”

At this time, as Lin Xiu approached, those sage warriors seemed to sense something and their eyes suddenly looked around.

What a sharp reaction ability! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

At this time, Lin Xiu, who was hiding in the woods in front of the entrance to the forbidden area, was also surprised.

He got here holding his breath yet these people noticed him?

And it’s very strange – there were no cameras here whatsoever.

“Come out!”

One of the warriors, holding the long sword in his hand, slashed toward the direction of the woods!

bang bang bang-

With a crisp sound, in the next moment, all the trees in front were cut off!

At this time, Lin Xiu’s figure slowly appeared.

“Got discovered by you guys huh…”

At this time, Lin Xiu walked out slowly, then said lightly.

These sage warriors frowned when they saw Lin Xiu coming out.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s outfit looked a little weird.

Because usually, no one wears such heavy armor.

And Lin Xiu was also wearing a mask.

“Who are you!”

At this time, the eight sage warriors all looked at Lin Xiu.

An extremely strong sense of oppression rushed toward Lin Xiu at this moment.

If it were an ordinary warrior, he would have fallen to his knees because of this extremely strong sense of oppression.

But to Lin Xiu, the sense of oppression brought by these sage warriors is nothing.

At this time, with the triggering of Lin Xiu’s mind, the source mark power was released.

Whoosh whoosh—

A large number of pale golden translucent matrices quickly appeared at this moment.

what are these?!

None of these sage warriors had ever seen such a strange power. At this moment, their eyes were full of surprise.

Soon, these matrices will surround the surroundings to form a special space.

Wrapping Lin Xiu and the eight sage warriors in it.

“I originally wanted to sneak in, but since you guys found me, I have no choice.”

Lin Xiu said helplessly.

“Playing tricks!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, one of the sage warriors snorted coldly at this moment, holding the weapon in his hand and attacked Lin Xiu!

swoosh—

But when his weapon was about to hit Lin Xiu’s body, he found that Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared instantly!

His weapon attacked the air!

People!?

“Don’t be in a hurry.”

Taking a closer look at this time, Lin Xiu appeared on the other side.

And at this time, Lin Xiu’s body had a white light blooming.

These rays of light, in the next moment, instantly covered the entire ground.

The faces of these sage warriors changed slightly at this time.

“It’s a force that blocks our domain force.”

One of the sage warriors seemed to have sensed the power Lin Xiu was using and spoke at this moment.

Hearing his words, the rest of the sage warriors already felt that their domain forces seemed to be blocked instantly.

There is no way to use it at all.

“Okay, next, let me come and send you guys to hell.”

Lin Xiu waved his right hand and a Dark edge spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand the next moment.

“Crazy!”

When these sage warriors heard Lin Xiu’s words, their expressions changed drastically.

Now Lin Xiu is only one person and he actually provoked their eight sage warriors.

Isn’t this courting death!

As their voices just fell, at the next moment, these sage warriors all charged towards Lin Xiu at the same time!

The weapons they held in their hands attacked Lin Xiu directly.

Dangdang-

And Lin Xiu still didn’t dodge. At this time, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he directly confronted them.

At this time, as their weapons collided with Lin Xiu’s, there was a loud noise.

But within the space surrounded by this matrix, these sounds could not travel out at all.

As long as no one comes here, no one will find that there is a fierce battle going on here.

boom boom boom —

And at this time, with Lin Xiu’s thoughts, streaks of terrifying dark blue flames appeared from the Dark edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand.

Swept towards the surrounding sage warriors!

“Damn!”

Those sage warriors were clearly aware of the terrifying flame. At this moment, their expressions changed greatly, they subconsciously retreated to the back and unfolded their ‘Sphere’.

At this time, Lin Xiu raised his eyes and looked at the sky, it was obviously dark now.

At this moment, the ‘Heavenly Array’ and ‘The Power of the Stars’ were activated directly.

With the activation of the system skills, the ground became even brighter.

And at this time, the light of a star in the sky converged directly on Lin Xiu’s body.

Lin Xiu’s entire body was filled with white light.

It looks like a god has descended into the world.

“It’s my turn.”

At this time, Lin Xiu said lightly.

Before the warriors could continue to attack, Lin Xiu’s figure flashed in an instant and he appeared in front of one of the warrior gods holding a sword.

The Dark edge spear in his hand quickly waved at this moment.

When the sage warrior saw Lin Xiu charging over, the pupils in his eyes shrank.

Dangdang-

Under Lin Xiu’s spear attack, the sage warrior could only resist constantly.

At this moment, his face also showed fear.

Because Lin Xiu’s attack was too violent.

The power brought by each attack was extremely powerful!
