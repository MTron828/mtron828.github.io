Chapter 901: The Main Prize!

Bak– –

When the sword in Zhao Kun’s arms was about to be pierced through Lin Xiu, he stopped it with only two fingers.

Zhao Kun was horrified to see what was happening.

He placed more force with his left hand and tried to push the sword forward but he soon realised that Lin Xiu’s hands were like a metal clamp. He couldn’t even push his sword forward by an inch.

“You...”

Zhao Kun started to look awful.

This young man could easily catch his powerful sword with only two fingers?

Boom – – Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Then, before he could react, Lin Xiu raised his leg and gave him a good kick in the stomach.

Zhao Kun’s body was like a kite that had been cut off from its string as he was thrown into the distance.

He landed heavily on a wall that was right behind him.

A mouthful of fresh blood came out of his mouth.

How was this possible?!

......

The remaining warriors from the elder’s home were beyond speechless.

They had planned to fight Lin Xiu but because of what had happened, none of them were able to move.

“Damn it!”

Zhao Kun’s mouth was covered with blood as he glared at Lin Xiu with deadly eyes.

He screamed as he crawled to stand, about to attack Lin Xiu once again!

All of the energy inside his body were being summoned.

He was about to release a huge warrior skill.

The ground beneath their feet started shaking vigorously.

Boom – –

Suddenly, there was a bright light that appeared and landed next to Zhao Kun. The man who was about to turn crazy suddenly stopped.

He stood motionlessly on the ground with his mouth open wide. He couldn’t move at all.

He took a good look and there was a young man who appeared next to him.

It was Zhao Yongyuan.

“You....you...”

Zhao Kun wanted to speak but there was a bloody line that appeared across his neck.

Then, his head fell off his neck and rolled on the ground!

The men from the elder’s home started shivering.

Zhao Kun was the strongest warrior amongst all of them and he was the only one who was closest to a respected warrior. However, he was killed without even using one warrior skill.

“The Zhao family wouldn’t need men like him.”

Zhao Yongyuan spoked in a monotonous tone.

Then, he looked at the men who came from the elder’s home.

Those who met with his eyes started trembling.

As they thought of how Zhao Kun was killed within seconds, their knees turned weak.

They knew that if they didn’t listen to this man, they would be killed instantly.

Since their abilities were below Zhao Kun.

“This is our ancestors, Yongyuan.”

Zhao Qi was amazed by Zhao Yongyuan as well.

He took a deep breath to calm himself before saying to those men from the elder’s home.

“Greetings, elder.”

Those from the elder’s home quickly understood the situation and got on their knees.

This was a world ruled by strength.

If Lin Xiu didn’t have the skills, not only would the Imperial Order be taken away, he would be killed as well.

“I’m terribly sorry, Young Master. I will make sure to fix the Zhao family.”

Zhao Yongyuan spoked to Lin Xiu.

“It’s alright.”

Lin Xiu said flatly.

With Lin Xiu’s strength currently, even if it was a warrior king at its peak was not a threat to him.

“I will leave this place up to you.”

“I hope to see a different Zhao family when I return one day.”

“Of course.”

Zhao Yongyuan nodded his head respectfully.

“Goodbye.”

Lin Xiu turned towards Zhao Xiaoqing who was still in shock and smiled.

Then, he activated the android battle horse and left the Zhao family.

Zhao Xiaoqing looked at Lin Xiu who was living and had a peculiar feeling inside her.

Would he be coming back...?

The destination at which he was headed to had already been entered into the android battle horse. There was nothing left for Lin Xiu to do. He only had to sit on top of the horse.

He laid on top of the horse and closed his eyes as he entered into his system.

It has already been awhile since he last did his lucky draw. When he got into the system, he realised that he had accumulated 5 lucky draws.

Plus, the items on the roulette seemed to be different from before.

“Warriors skill cards. All of them are diamond rank and above...”

As he took a closer look, the entire roulette looked different.

The gold rank warrior skills card from before had already completely disappeared.

The diamond rank warrior skills cards were in place instead.

As for the other slots, the potential pill and some had a question mark on it. He had no idea what was behind it.

The main prize was still there.

“For now, the most useful thing would be a combat suit.”

This was because his combat suit had been destroyed.

Plus, the combat suit that he would get from the system was different from the ones that he could buy because those from the system would come with additional skills.

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu decided to start the lucky draw.

He used up all 5 chances that he had.

The roulette started spinning quickly.

Although Lin Xiu had already done this many times, he was still feeling anxious.

The roulette was still spinning very quickly!

“Stop!”

When he saw that the needle was about to stop at the main prize, Lin Xiu got a little more excited.

Lin Xiu was aware that the prizes from the roulette now will become better as his rank increased!

This meant that the items that he would be getting were much better than before!

“Ding! Congratulations on getting the warrior skills cards!”

“Ding! Congratulations Master on getting a large number of potential pills!”

“Ding! Congratulations Master on getting the battle boots!”

“Ding! Congratulations Master for getting the Concentrate Pill!”

“Ding! Congratulations Master on getting the ‘Main Prize’!”

Dang!

Lin Xiu was feeling a little bored until he heard the last notification and his eyes stretched wide.

The main prize! He got the main prize!!

Lin Xiu had already forgotten the last time that he managed to get the main prize.

“Stop!”

Lin Xiu stopped the android battle horse by the riverbanks and started checking the prizes that he got.

Whoosh – –

There were dozens of warrior skills cards that fell onto his hands.

“Woah!”

Lin Xiu was surprised as he stared at them with his eyes widened.

This was because all of these cards were diamond rank warrior skills cards.

If it was Lin Xiu from a few months ago, he would be delighted but now, he was only a little surprised.

“Meteorite Boots?”
