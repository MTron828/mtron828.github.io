Chapter 342: Who...Who On Earth Are You!?

An extremely cold aura went directly from his sword to his body.

Damn it! What is this!?

At this moment, he saw that the saber he was about to hack down on Lin Xiu’s body was filled with white flames.

With the appearance of these flames, his sword seemed to be covered with frost!

Ice lotus fire!

This must be the ice lotus fire!

At this time, he felt the air from his saber become icier like it was going to freeze him!

“Damn it!!!” At first, he was about to slash at Lin Xiu’s body, but at this moment, he could no longer attack and his whole body fell directly on the ground.

The saber in his hand also fell from his hand and stuck firmly on the ground.

Taking a closer look, the sword that fell on the ground was already covered in frost and the entire sword seemed frozen.

Those white flames were still on the saber and were not extinguished.

At this time, Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief. Looking to the other side, Luo Yue continued to fight the two warriors called “Black and White Demons”.

It was obvious just now that Luo Yue used the ice lotus fire to help him escape death.

Now it seemed like he couldn’t rely too much on ‘Mirror Clone’.

After all, as long as he used it once, these high-ranking warriors would be able to see through this skill the second time, just like what happened just now.

If that happens, he might be killed.

But now, Lin Xiu would no longer reveal any flaws.

He landed steadily on the ground, then gripped the Dark Edge spear and rushed directly to the front!

Swish——

Lin Xiu’s body tensed up at this time and exploded in terrifying speed.

He rushed to the middle-aged man and the Dark Edge spear in his hand pierced his body directly!

When the middle-aged man saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank, but his body still dodged quickly.

Bang bang bang——

The strength of the spear stabbing out at this time was very powerful, even this rank 7 warrior artist did not dare to take it lightly.

And now his saber was on the ground, covered in this ice lotus fire, he had no way of picking up his weapon.

“Go to hell!” Just then, while avoiding Lin Xiu’s attack, he seized the opportunity, and his fist slammed into Lin Xiu’s head!

Crackling——

As the crackling resounded, Lin Xiu saw flashes of electric light on the fist that the middle-aged man smashed over.

‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’!?

No, this is not ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’, this is just similar.

But Lin Xiu still felt the power erupting from his fist and the electric light looked even more powerful.

Lin Xiu didn’t have time to think too much at this time and moved his body to dodge the attack.

“Did you think you can hide!?” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

The man let out a loud roar.

The fist that was going towards Lin Xiu’s body continued to follow Lin Xiu and was about to hit him!

The look on Lin Xiu’s face changed. Typically, one wouldn’t be able to simply change the direction of a punch due to its force but this guy could still forcefully change the direction of his punch and it was about to hit Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu’s expression changed drastically at this time, but there was no way to dodge it anymore!

Boom–

This middle-aged man smashed the electric punch directly on Lin Xiu’s body!

With a dull sound, Lin Xiu’s body flew out like a kite with a broken string.

He fell heavily on the ground far away.

And taking a closer look, there were still many electric lights flashing on Lin Xiu’s body.

“Huhu.” At this time, the middle-aged man couldn’t help but pant a little.

Because the move [Thunderbolt Lightning Fist] he just used had already used most of his body’s source strength to gather it on his fist. Coupled with the skill he just used, his body was beginning to feel tired now.

“You are really a difficult kid…” The middle-aged man looked at Lin Xiu and wiped a trace of blood that oozed out of his lips.

Lin Xiu was clearly only a rank 5 warrior but he found it quite challenging dealing with him. Now that Lin Xiu was surrounded by a large amount of electric light, he would die for sure.

Even ordinary rank 7 warriors wouldn’t be able to survive the electric light carried by his ‘Thunderbolt Lightning Fist’.

“Only a warrior like me who has been tortured by electric shock since childhood can withstand such a powerful skill.” The middle-aged man clenched his fist proudly and looked at Lin Xiu as he mumbled to himself.

But just when he thought Lin Xiu was dead, he saw a shocking scene.

The electric lights surrounding Lin Xiu’s body, at this moment, begin to decrease at a speed visible to the naked eye.

What shocked him even more was that Lin Xiu’s body was swaying as if he was about to stand up.

How can this be!!!

The middle-aged man’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“Tsk tsk, it seems that the power of your skill is just like that.” Lin Xiu’s hand grasped the Dark Edge Spear that had fallen next to him and pressed it against the ground as he slowly stood up.

These electric lights flooded Lin Xiu’s body. Not only did Lin Xiu feel no pain, but his strength was constantly recovering.

This was not only because he had undergone electric shock resistance training before, the impact of these electric lights on Lin Xiu was not severe, but more importantly, his ‘Engulf’ skill was automatically activated just now!

Lin Xiu was surprised to find that the ‘Engulf’ skill not only slowly engulfed the energy of the electric light and turned them into experience, but it also replenished his energy!

Although not much, it was still very effective for Lin Xiu, who had already used up a lot of his power.

“Who…who on earth are you!?” The middle-aged man’s eyes widened as he looked at Lin Xiu who had stood up.
