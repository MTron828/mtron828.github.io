Chapter 1049: Another Space

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Where he was at was another space.

This space seemed to be in the crater and the surrounding ground was full of terrifying lava.

The entire space was extremely bright red and very hot.

The black giant beast madly patted the magma under it with its claws and soon, the dark blue hellfire slowly disappeared. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Boy, although I don’t know who you are, but if you dare to provoke me, then you are doomed.”

The figure of the Sage warrior appeared on the other side at this time.

Looking at Lin Xiu’s figure, he immediately sneered.

“go!”

With a wave of his right hand, the black giant continued to attack Lin Xiu.

And in the fiery red lava behind him, there are even more of these black giants, slowly starting to get up from the lava.

“A lava giant beast…”

Under the Analytical Eye, Lin Xiu easily knew that these giant beasts were evolved beasts close to the beast saint level.

Moreover, they live in lava and have very high resistance to fire-type skill.

Lin Xiu’s dark blue hellfire just now didn’t directly melt the arm of this giant beast.

Looking at the lava giant beasts, they were all frantically waving their claws to attack him in the air. With the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes, his figure flashed and he dodged directly.

boom boom boom —

Some lava giant beasts opened their mouths and sprayed out a lot of extremely high-temperature flames.

But Lin Xiu, who is also extremely resistant to fire attribute, was not afraid at all.

“I thought what kind of spatial source mark it is yet it merely brought me to this darn place?”

Lin Xiu’s figure stopped in the air. As he had the ‘Sphere’ unfolded, all the attacks of those lava monsters were blocked.

Lin Xiu was unhurt.

When the Sage warrior heard Lin Xiu’s words, his face became extremely ugly.

He also did not expect that Lin Xiu’s resistance to flames would be so high.

Thinking of the dark blue flame that appeared from Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear just now, he can now be sure that Lin Xiu is a warrior who uses fire attribute skill.

“Then, let’s see if your fire is stronger than mine!”

The Sage warrior seemed to speak to himself and at the same time, his hands spread open.

clap clap-

As all his power was released, at this moment, the magma below seemed to be boiling instantly, making a loud noise.

“rise!”

He continued to wave his hands and roared and the boiling magma below all rose up, forming several giant magma snakes that flew into the air.

“go!”

With the wave of the Sage warrior, the combined magma snakes all attacked Lin Xiu!

boom boom boom —

As these magma snakes charged over, there was a huge sound in the air.

Looking at the giant lava snakes charging from all directions and the giant lava beasts that were constantly attacking him, Lin Xiu’s expression remained unchanged – as if he was not afraid at all.

In the next moment, the giant magma snakes hit the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded.

With a loud noise, Lin Xiu, who was unfolding the ‘Sphere’, was instantly covered by a large amount of magma.

“Let’s see if you can survive this!”

This Sage warrior said coldly.

Lin Xiu knocked him out of the hotel just now and it made him feel extremely ashamed.

He was a dignified Sage warrior, but he was knocked out by such a young boy.

“Next, we will deal with that Haoyue Sect’s woman.”

This Sage warrior seems to have already predicted that Lin Xiu will die because of the blow he just made. He triggered his thoughts and the space is broken open again.

He wanted to enter the broken space and return to Baidi City again.

Boom—

But at this moment, a huge sound rang out and a large amount of magma was directly swept into the surroundings.

Moreover, the bodies of the lava monsters that attacked Lin Xiu were also directly broken into several halves.

what happened!?

The Sage warrior turned around abruptly and found that Lin Xiu’s figure reappeared in the air as the magma scattered around.

Lin Xiu, who was in the air at this time, was not injured at all!

The whole person is still intact.

“You’re only capable of that?”

Lin Xiu looked at the Sage warrior and said lightly.

how can that be!

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the Sage warrior took a closer look, Lin Xiu was indeed perfectly fine!

Even his ‘Sphere’ could be unfolded normally!

“Damn!!!”

This Sage warrior’s face has become sinister.

“I’ll let you see what power is.”

While Lin Xiu said lightly, the power of his body immediately started to work.

‘Freezing the Distance’!

With the release of Lin Xiu’s source strength, the extremely scorching temperature around him turned cold in an instant!

The temperature was still dropping.

clack clack——

With a crisp sound, everything around was instantly covered with ice.

The magma on the entire ground seemed to freeze in an instant.

The original scorching magma cave turned into an ice cave!

And at this time, with the triggering of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, a large number of ice cubes condensed on Lin Xiu’s side.

Soon, these ice cubes shattered into icicles.

“go!”

With the wave of Lin Xiu’s right hand, these icicles all charged toward the Sage warrior!

When Sage warrior saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

Because he can clearly feel that there were source strength fluctuations on the icicles, they were not ordinary icicles!

His eyes changed slightly and as soon as his body moved, he was about to escape directly from the broken space and into the Baidi City!

“Leaving?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows and at the next moment, along with the black source mark on his forehead, a black light appeared and a huge matrix appeared in front of the broken space.

Directly block the opening of the space!

boom–

This Sage warrior’s body directly hit the matrix.

There was absolutely no way to leave!

Damn it!

He roared inwardly and out of the corner of his eyes, he clearly saw those icicles, which were already charging toward him!

There was no way, at this time, he can only directly unfold his ‘Sphere’ and resist!

bang bang bang-

In the next moment, icicles hit his ‘Sphere’, making a loud noise.

That icicle had a powerful force as if it was going to break his ‘Sphere’!

His body suspended in the air kept retreating because of the impact of the ice pick.

“Get down there!”

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared above him at some point.

Holding a spear, he directly attacked!
