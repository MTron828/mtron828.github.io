1315 Restraining the Power of the Water Attribute

Baili Haoling spoke seriously at this time.

The middle-aged uncle became curious when he heard Baili Haoling’s words: “It seems that you have great confidence in him.”

“You know each other?”

“Of course, the city lord will definitely win!”

!!

Before Baili Haoling could speak, Lei Tong spoke confidently.

“So you guys are from Lingxian City.”

The middle-aged man smiled at this moment.

“Let’s see, I also think he might win.”

After all, Baili Haoling and Lei Tong are both from Lingxian City, so it’s hard for him to say that he doesn’t like Lin Xiu.

At this time, Lin Xiu and Ning Yu, who were on the battle platform, were still fighting.

As the weapons of the two collided together, an extremely loud sound erupted again and at the same time, the bodies of the two retreated to the back at the same time.

“interesting.”

Ning Yu looked at Lin Xiu who also retreated to the back and said in a cold voice.

At this moment, he felt a tingling pain in his hand holding the saber.

During the fight just now, the power produced was indeed too great.

Lin Xiu also narrowed his eyes slightly at this moment. Ning Yu’s strength is indeed good.

Stronger than that of Ning Tianxuan.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s physical strength was mobilized.

A large amount of source strength gathered towards the White Moon spear in Lin Xiu’s hand.

Soon, a dark blue flame burst out from the barrel of White Moon’s spear.

“Is this a fire attribute skill?”

When Ning Yu saw this scene, there was no panic in his eyes.

He has already studied Lin Xiu’s. Although these flame skills were powerful, he also has a way to restrain them.

At this time, as his power was continuously released, the sword in his hand also shone with light.

“go!!!”

Lin Xiu held the White Moon spear and waved it in the air.

Immediately, a series of dark blue flaming birds were released instantly!

These flaming birds all rushed toward Ning Yu.

“This flame is a bit terrifying…”

The middle-aged man just now had always disliked Lin Xiu, but now seeing the skill released by Lin Xiu, he couldn’t help but marvel.

There is a special transparent energy barrier around the battle platform.

Because the battle of God warriors was too spacious, although the battle platform is made of extremely hard materials and you don’t have to worry about it being destroyed, but with so many spectators around, it would be bad if they were affected.

And this transparent energy barrier should also have the effect of isolating the energy inside.

But even so, he still felt that the surrounding temperature had risen, which was enough to see the horror of the flame.

Ning Yu looked at the flames that were charging toward him and showed a sneer at this moment.

The sword in his hand turned into water at this moment.

“go!”

At the next moment, as he drew a circular arc with the sword in his hand, a crescent-shaped energy composed of water immediately rushed out! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Those flaming birds that charged over were all split by this energy at this moment!

what is this!?

Lin Xiu looked at this scene and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

The flaming bird that he released was so easily smashed apart!?

“go!”

At this time, Ning Yu showed a strange smile on his face and the water-like sword in his hand also slashed at Lin Xiu in the air at this moment!

At this moment, a large number of water droplets splashed out from the sword.

These drops of water instantly became larger, then formed water snakes, charging toward Lin Xiu!

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu’s expression changed slightly. The spear in his hand danced and he used ‘Awe of the phoenix’ again to release the flaming birds.

But when the flaming birds were released and collided with the water snakes released by Ning Yu, the water snakes directly penetrated the flaming birds.

And these flaming birds also dissipated directly at this time.

These water snakes are about to hit Lin Xiu’s body in the next moment!

Lin Xiu quickly moved his White Moon spear.

Bang bang bang——

The spear crazily stabbed at the water snakes that charged over.

When the spear pierced the water snakes that were attacking, Lin Xiu found that the water snakes seemed to have been stabbed and exploded, instantly turning into a large number of water droplets.

...

And these drops of water rushed toward Lin Xiu crazily.

Bang bang bang——

There were too many drops of water. Lin Xiu couldn’t resist for a while.

As the water drops hit Lin Xiu’s body, Lin Xiu immediately felt a great impact.

This kind of impact is countless times stronger than bullets.

Although he was wearing a battle uniform, Lin Xiu felt like his skin was about to burst.

“Hehehe, I didn’t expect that, you are majoring in fire attribute, but I am majoring in water attribute skill.”

“I’ve studied all of your skills, you’re doomed.”

Ning Yu looked at Lin Xiu and laughed out loud.

But he stopped smiling immediately and continued to dance with his sword.

A series of water snakes were released continuously and rushed toward Lin Xiu.

...

Lin Xiu just stabbed those water snakes, then was hit by a large number of water droplets, his whole body was full of severe pain.

Now he’s getting a little angry.

Huh——

Taking a deep breath, Lin Xiu calmed down.

Looking at the water snakes that continued to charge towards him, Lin Xiu’s mind was triggered and the source strength of his whole body burst out.

Boom——

Immediately, a large number of flames formed a ‘Sphere’ to wrap around his body.

“This is ‘Sphere’!?”

Some warriors around were all surprised at this moment.

Because the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu is unfolding now is indeed too special.

Bang bang bang——

In the next moment, as those water snakes hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, they were instantly burned into water vapor by the extremely high temperature.

“Small tricks.”

Seeing this scene, Ning Yu’s face became gloomy.

He hesitated for a moment and mobilized all the energy in his body, gathering it in his limbs.

On the forehead, there is also a light blue source mark slowly appearing.

As he rushed towards Lin Xiu, the source mark became more and more dazzling.

Soon, water seemed to appear on the entire ground.

Lin Xiu also clearly saw that the entire battlefield had rising water.

Hiss——

Because of the existence of his own ‘Sphere’, the water is constantly being evaporated.

But not only did the water not decrease, but it rose even higher!

“This source mark power is a bit interesting.”

At the same time, Noble god Riyan in the special spectator seat also seemed to be very interested in watching the scene in front of him.

“Noble god, Noble god…”

At this time, a God warrior sitting beside him hesitated for a moment, then said aloud.
