Chapter 62: Grand Flow Of The Waterfall

At this moment, everyone started to gather at the stage.

“Do you guys see that? It’s Lin Xiu!” A few students shouted out excitedly.

Lin Xiu was definitely an idol to the students that were at the bottom of the rankings.

After all, he himself was one of the bottom few, yet he defeated a top 100 ranker, Tang Tian!

“Very good, you didn’t die there. I will kill you with my own hands.” Tang Tian glared at Lin Xiu and clenched his fists.

Luo Li immediately felt a sense of relief when he saw Lin Xiu back in the nick of time. And after that, he could clearly sense that Lin Xiu’s aura was different than before.

Even as a teacher in charge, he was able to sense danger from Lin Xiu.

“You are Lin Xiu?” Chen Xiao pointed at Lin Xiu with his golden machete and asked.

Although he sensed that there was something off about Lin Xiu’s aura, he was unwilling to back down and continued to point at Lin Xiu with his blade tip.

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu nodded his head. He was about to reach the level of a rank 2 warrior.

Chen Xiao was only amongst the few hundreds in ranking, so he did not even bother to use Analytic Eye on him.

“Lin Xiu seems to have gotten even stronger…” Yang Tian looked at Lin Xiu and mumbled to himself.

Zhang Yi clenched his fists tightly and stared in Lin Xiu’s direction.

“Both parties, get ready!” The referee looked at Lin Xiu then at Chen Xiao and said.

“Begin!!!”

Following his command, Chen Xiao charged forward with his gold machete.

When he got close to Lin Xiu, he suddenly jumped up and slashed downwards.

“Chen Xiao’s gold machete is made out of Gamma star’s gold augites and is extremely sharp. If Lin Xiu doesn’t dodge that attack, it’ll be dangerous.”

A student below the stage spoke loudly.

“Although Lin Xiu defeated Tang Tian before, I feel that it was Tang Tian that underestimated his opponent. Chen Xiao’s blade skills are tyrannical and ferocious, Lin Xiu is bound to lose!” A student snorted.

They supported Chen Xiao as they were classmates.

Bang-!

Right at this time as Chen Xiao’s gold blade was about to strike Lin Xiu’s body, he took action!

He used both hands and grabbed the blade, producing an extremely loud and clear sound!

“What?!”

All the students below were dumbstruck. They thought that Lin Xiu would avoid the strike and never expected Lin Xiu to use his bare hands to grab the blade. At the same time, Chen Xiao looked to be in a difficult situation.

“Damn it!!!” Chen Xiao roared out loud and exerted a force to perform a reverse slash.

Lin Xiu frowned. The machete was slightly sharp and caused his palms a bit of pain.

The momentum on top of his strength to perform the reverse slash forced Lin Xiu to loosen his grip on the blade.

Chen Xiao snorted and retreated a few times, but his face could not help but turn sour.

Although he looked to be looking down on Lin Xiu, that one exchange let him experience Lin Xiu’s terror.

And there was still the black box on Lin Xiu’s back. No one knew what was hidden inside.

“Ahhh!!!” He screamed out loud and charged forward with his gold machete.

Bronze skill – Collapsing Petals Nine Forms!

The skill’s greatest trait was that every strike after was stronger and faster!

Lin Xiu frowned and dodged to the side as the blade flashed past his cheeks.

Chen Xiao was extremely domineering and continued to hack his way forward. Although every blade was faster, none of them hit him.

Every strike was a near miss!

“Lin Xiu is just too lucky.” A few students saw Lin Xiu avoiding by a hair and could not help but exclaim.

Only the stronger ones were shaken by his moves.

“Is it my turn?” After the ninth strike, Lin Xiu’s mouth curved upwards as he launched a fist forward!

Although Chen Xiao was able to react fast enough to block, the immense force forced the blade to hit his own chest and caused him to fly backwards.

The entire field flew into an uproar.

‘Pu’

Chen Xiao coughed out a mouthful of blood and struggled to stand as he stared straight at Lin Xiu.

There’s no other choice!

He took a deep breath, then gathered all his power into his arms and legs.

He looked at Lin Xiu who stood stationary and bellowed out loud, “Grand Flow of the Waterfall!”

Right as he finished his words, his legs burst forth and he suddenly leaped into the air when he arrived before Lin Xiu and then performed a vertical slash in midair!

“It’s here! Chen Xiao’s unique skill – Grand Flow of the Waterfall!!!” A few students that fought against Chen Xiao all cried out excitedly.

It was an uncommon skill that only Chen Xiao knew in the entire Xing Yao Academy! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

It could even be considered his signature move.

“Who would have thought that Chen Xiao would have to use such an exhausting skill in the first round? Could Lin Xiu really be that difficult to deal with?” A few students were puzzled.

One had to know that if one did not preserve their strength on the first day of the battles, it would become even harder in the later rounds.

At this time, no one was discussing anything. Everyone had their eyes locked onto the stage.

Many fine wind blades appeared from Chen Xiao’s slash.

Multiple deep slash scars appeared on the stage that was made out of unique materials.

“Dodge!!!” Yang Tian cried out loud.

But Lin Xiu still remained unmoved.

‘Seeking death!!!’ Chen Xiao’s pupils constricted at the sight of Lin Xiu.

The power of this skill was something that could hack an ordinary person into pieces. Even a warrior would be gravely injured.

Papapa-

A few thin slashes appeared on Lin Xiu’s robes, while the box on his back shattered into pieces and fell on the ground.

Right at this time, everyone caught a glimpse of an object that emitted a cold light.

What was in that box?!

When everyone was still stunned, Lin Xiu made his move.

His right hand grabbed onto the object within the box and charged towards Chen Xiao!

Fast, it was so fast that everyone only saw an afterimage!

Chen Xiao’s eyes were wide open. Just as his blade was about to slash forth, a cold light flashed by and a ‘dang’ sound was heard as the blade in his hand was tossed away.

“You’ve lost.”
