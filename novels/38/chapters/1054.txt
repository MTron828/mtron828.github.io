Chapter 1055: The Death of Tang Qing

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Destiny Spear Art!

This level of spear art was far more powerful than the sword art of these people.

At this time, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand continued to collide with their swords.

One after another sparks flickered in the air.

When the sword of the Tang Pavilion’s left guardian slashed on Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ again, white smoke came out of the hand holding the sword.

The sword in his hand almost fell out.

“Damn!”

He let out a roar with an extremely nasty snarl.

The outer layer of Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ was really too hot.

As their weapons continued to attack Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, the weapons in their hands became more and more scorching hot.

His hands were so hot that he almost threw the weapon in his hand.

“Don’t fight with him in close combat, let’s attack from a distance!”

At this time, Tang Pavilion’s right guardian also felt that Lin Xiu’s melee ability was too powerful. If they continued to fight, they would not take any advantage.

Because Lin Xiu unfolded that weird ‘Sphere’, not only did he resist all their attacks.

What’s even more terrifying is that the dark blue flames on the ‘Sphere’ made their weapons almost melt away.

At this time, as they distant themselves from Lin Xiu, their bodies released power at the same time.

At the same time, all kinds of light burst out from the body.

“It’s useless.”

Lin Xiu looked at this scene, narrowed his eyes slightly and said lightly.

What they use is domain forces.

But Lin Xiu’s purification domain has already been released.

When their domain force was just released and covered the ground, they found that their domain disappeared instantly!

What exactly is going on!

At the same time, the four Sage warriors showed extremely shocked expressions on their faces.

The domain force they just released disappeared for no reason.

Even they didn’t know what was going on.

“It’s him, this kid’s domain force.”

At this time, Tang Qi was still a little breathless and said aloud.

He just recovered from Lin Xiu’s frantic attack just now.

“It could remove someone else’s domain force…”

At this time, Elder Lin of Tang Pavilion’s face also became ugly.

In a single-player battle, the removal of the opponent’s domain force would at most result in the ineffectiveness of both domains.

But if there are multiple people fighting, the horror of this domain force will be revealed.

Using this domain force that doesn’t seem to have any power augmentation can abolish the domain force of all the opponent’s warriors. This is really terrifying.

“Why, are you surprised?”

Lin Xiu looked at them at this time and said with a smirk.

The moment Lin Xiu spoke, he flashed and appeared in front of Tang Qing.

Although Tang Qing was the head of the Tang Pavilion, his strength was indeed the weakest among the five Sage warriors.

It is impossible to kill all of them at the same time. After all, Lin Xiu wanted to keep the use of ‘Reset’.

After all, there are many warriors in Baidi City and there is also the existence of the Bai family.

If he can no longer use ‘Fury’ when he is in danger, then things will be troublesome. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“you…”

At the same time, Tang Qing looked at Lin Xiu who suddenly flashed in front of him, the pupils in his eyes could not help shrinking slightly.

He never thought that Lin Xiu would continue to attack him again!

The ‘Sphere’ that was full of cracks just now unfolded again in the next moment.

At this time, although those cracks disappeared, but because of the loss of source strength, the ‘Sphere’ that he unfolded again became thinner.

boom–

Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear in both hands directly attacked his ‘Sphere’.

The powerful impact made Tang Qing’s body shoot out directly.

“what!!!”

The moment he flew out, Tang Qing roared and a purple source mark flashed on his forehead.

crackling-

A large amount of purple lightning charged directly towards Lin Xiu, who continued to chase after him!

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly, without dodging at all, stared directly at the lightning he released and continued to charge.

“If you want to blame, blame it on your bad luck.”

I have an extremely strong resistance to electrical energy!

At this time, as Lin Xiu charged over with a long spear, the whole person was like a black dragon, showing his teeth and claws and charging directly at Tang Qing, who had been sent flying out!

Those lightning strikes hit Lin Xiu’s body and they didn’t cause anything to Lin Xiu at all.

No!!!

Seeing this scene, Tang Qing’s eyes widened and he roared loudly in his heart.

But now, he has no way to dodge.

Boom—

As Lin Xiu, whose whole body was transformed into a huge black dragon, rushed over, he directly penetrated his body until a huge hole appeared.

The ‘Sphere’ he unfolded was directly blown away.

“Father!!!”

Tang Qi looked at this scene and suddenly screamed loudly.

He originally relied on his father, Tang Pavilion’s master, to be so unscrupulous.

If Tang Qing is dead, then he is nothing!

“Master!!!”

When the four Sage warriors saw this scene, they also roared loudly.

The ‘Flashing Souls’ movement technique Lin Xiu just used allowed him to appear by Tang Qing’s side before they could react and attacked Tang Qing.

By the time they came to their senses, it was already too late!

“Go to hell!!!”

Elder Lin of Tang Pavilion let out a roar at this time and the source mark on his forehead also appeared.

There was a gust of wind all around.

Whoosh whoosh—

One after another terrifying wind blades charged towards Lin Xiu!

Although those wind blades could not be seen clearly with the naked eye but with Lin Xiu’s ear, he could clearly hear the sound of these wind blades flying over.

Lin Xiu’s body instinctively dodged and those wind blades directly impacted the ground behind Lin Xiu, causing a large number of deep cracks to appear on the ground behind Lin Xiu.

But Lin Xiu was totally fine.

“This kid… what the hell is going on!”

The face of Tang Pavilion’s left and right guardians has become extremely ugly at this time.

Lin Xiu’s strength was simply too strong, beyond their expectations.

“I don’t know either. It was the Young Pavilion Master who provoked him.”

Elder Bai looked at Tang Qi at this time and said coldly.

It seems that he saw the look of Elder Bai looking at him and Tang Qi’s body also trembled at this time.

Now that Tang Qing was dead, no one would care about his life or death now.

Especially now that all the warriors in the Tang Pavilion have died, the entire Tang Pavilion can be said to be completely destroyed.

“Before, it was because of the old pavilion owner that I followed the Tang pavilion. Now my obligations should be almost fulfilled. Tang pavilion has nothing to do with me in the future.”

Elder Bai said aloud at this time.
