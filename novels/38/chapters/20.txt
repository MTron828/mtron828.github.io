Chapter 21: Combat Strength Test

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“You’re really Lin Xiu?” Sun Chen looked at Lin Xiu viciously.

He had heard of the name of this lowest-ranking student in the academy, but he had never expected to actually meet Lin Xiu under these circumstances.

Moreover, he even broke Li Yuan’s arm. Even though Li Yuan had underestimated his enemy and there was the element of luck, Sun Chen had to admit that Lin Xiu’s strength was definitely not at the bottom.

“That’s right.” Lin Xiu nodded, then said to Li Yuan, “Sorry, I went a little too hard. I’ll pay for your medical treatment.”

“You…!” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Li Yuan was so furious that he nearly spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Courting death, huh!” When a guy heard Lin Xiu’s arrogant tone, he couldn’t tolerate it and was about to take action.

“Stop!” Jiang Xiao knitted his brows and yelled.

That guy stopped what he was doing when he heard Jiang Xiao.

“Don’t embarrass our Xing Yao Academy here.”

“Both parties are at fault and Lin Xiu had already apologized.” Jiang Xiao didn’t want matters to reach a deadlock and Lin Xiu was a loser anyway, so Jiang Xiao would be tarnishing his own class’ reputation by fighting with him.

“Lin Xiu, do you dare to come for the final battle test?” With support from everyone, Li Yuan stared at Lin Xiu and asked.

At the end of every term, there would be a battle of strength before a new round of ranking was conducted.

The top 100 students would receive the academy’s cultivation resources.

“Why not?” Lin Xiu raised his brows and replied.

“Sure! I’ll be waiting!” Li Yuan said with a ferocious glint in his eyes.

Not long after, the students from class 1 dispersed.

The remaining people looked at Lin Xiu in surprise.

Never mind that he defeated Xu Jun previously, they didn’t expect that even Li Yuan from class 1 was also in Lin Xiu’s control.

“Lin Xiu, amazing ah. You broke this fella’s hand!” Yang Tian patted Lin Xiu’s shoulder and said.

At this moment, Luo Li was also looking at Lin Xiu with eyes of admiration. Luo Li didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would actually improve so much within such a short period of time.

“Oh right. Everyone, please measure your combat strength. I would like to see if there is an increase after the combat training.” Luo Li said to everyone.

The combat strength test apparatus was the federation’s latest development. It could reveal the strength of a person’s muscles, the power of a person’s explosive force as well as various attributes, and give a combat strength score.

Although it was reasonable to say that the higher the combat strength score was, the stronger one’s physique would be. But in actual combat, combat strength was not everything; people with a lower combat strength could also defeat someone with a slightly higher combat strength.

The ‘pub’ was well-equipped and this combat strength test apparatus was also found here.

Luo Li watched as everyone went on the apparatus and recorded the results in a booklet.

“Ye Qiu, beginner warrior, overall combat strength 450.”

“Ning Mu, beginner warrior, overall combat strength 389.”

“Yang Tian, beginner warrior, overall combat strength 469.”

“...”

“Sigh, my combat strength only increased by over 20 points.” Yang Tian said, slightly upset.

“As long as there is an improvement.” Luo Li nodded towards him as he recorded it down.

After the actual combat training, everyone’s body coordination had improved and some even became stronger. Their combat strength had also increased by over 20 points which Luo Li was quite satisfied with.

“Zhang Yi, go on up,” Luo Li said to Zhang Yi when he saw that almost everybody was done.

As the class monitor of Class 29, Zhang Yi was quite gifted in the aspect of cultivation despite his character.

Luo Li was still quite eager to see whether Zhang Yi’s current strength had improved.

Zhang Yi nodded, then slowly walked to that combat strength test apparatus as everybody watched.

As the apparatus was activated, Zhang Yi’s data was being calculated. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Everyone from Class 29 crowded around and the students looked like they were holding their breaths.

Very soon, a line of words appeared on the display: “quasi-warrior, overall combat strength 675.”

“Quasi-warrior!? Zhang Yi has already become a quasi-warrior!?”

The students gasped in surprise.

Usually, people with a combat strength of 300-600 were beginner warriors, 600-800 were quasi-warriors and 800-1500 were rank 1 warriors...

It seemed like Zhang Yi was close to becoming an official warrior.

Those who became an official warrior before college, which was around the age of 18 years old, were considered good seedlings.

Luo Li nodded and appeared quite pleased. Zhang Yi’s progress was obvious to all which made him very happy.

“Zhang Yi, since you’re now a quasi-warrior, you can try learning ‘cultivation technique’ tomorrow in school.” Luo Li said to Zhang Yi.

“Sure!” Zhang Yi was delighted and quickly nodded.

Official warriors were so strong because of this ‘cultivation technique’!

There were many beneficial energies in the universe and mankind called them ‘sources’.

By absorbing the source energy in the air which strengthens their cells’ energy, the muscles in their body and even bones were constantly strengthened.

“Next up… Lin Xiu!” After Luo Li recorded Zhang Yi’s combat strength, he looked at the next name and paused before calling out.

At this moment, when everyone heard Lin Xiu’s name, the students all turned and looked at him.

This loser who was once at the bottom had an explosive energy in just a short period of time which shocked everyone.

“Hng, even when a loser has a little bit of strength, he is still a loser.” Ye Qiu stood next to Zhang Yi and scoffed.

Hearing what Ye Qiu said, Zhang Yi’s face lit up slightly. He thought so too, and even if Lin Xiu had become slightly stronger, he was still at most a beginner warrior and wasn’t a threat to him at all.

“Hng, why don’t you break Class 1 Li Yuan’s arm as well if you’re so great, huh?” Yang Tian couldn’t help but speak up when he heard Ye Qiu’s ridicule.

“You…!” Ye Qiu’s expression changed and he pointed at Yang Tian with a trembling finger.

“He’s just lucky,” Ye Qiu retorted.

“You’ll find out the combat strength of this loser very soon, just watch!”

Lin Xiu didn’t care about the discussions around him and took a deep breath, then stood on top of the apparatus.

The apparatus was running, and a few lasers shone on Lin Xiu’s body. Very soon, the machine began to analyze his results.

Everyone’s eyes were on the display of the apparatus.

How would the former number 1 loser of the academy perform this time?

Soon, the machine’s smart analysis was completed and a line of words appeared on the display.
