Chapter 813: Liu Yanran’s Express

These people were indeed intelligence experts and after asking them, it was clear that in Fengyun City, there was a Luo family named Luo Yue who was studying at Xuanfeng Academy.

It seems that she is quite famous in Xuanfeng Academy because of her beauty, but she seems to be cold.

“Is that you... Luo Yue.”

Lin Xiu said to himself in his heart.

But it is not that easy to go to Xuanfeng Academy, what’s more, it seems that the holidays had started at Xuanfeng Academy.

If he wanted to find Luo Yue, he could only go to the Luo family.

But the Luo family didn’t seem to be a small family in this Fengyun City.

And it’s in the city center.

However, it is said that Luo Yue will also participate in the warrior competition.

“Comfortable.”

Liu Pan stretched out at this moment and the next moment, he jumped out of bed.

Now his injury has fully recovered and there is no problem at this time.

“Those people didn’t do anything to you, did they?”

Liu Pan seemed to have thought of something, then hurriedly said.

“What do you think.”

Lin Xiu smiled, then asked back.

“Brother Lin, I knew you were amazing, but I’m embarrassed again this time.”

Liu Panyu touched his head embarrassedly and said.

Lin Xiu shook his head and smiled, “Don’t say that, it’s all my fault.”

“Okay, don’t talk nonsense anymore, we have a competition tomorrow.”

Qian Jin said helplessly.

“Right! Competition!”

“Brother Lin, I have to go back to find our people over there first.”

Liu Pan seemed to have thought of something at this time and said quickly.

“Go back first then.”

Lin Xiu said aloud.

“Brother Lin and Brother Qian, see you tomorrow!”

Liu Pan waved his hand and hurriedly ran outside.

“Let’s go, let’s go back to the staff first. You haven’t told them about the things you lost.”

Qian Jin looked at Lin Xiu, spread his hands helplessly and said.

“Sure.”

Qian Jin and they stayed in the hotel on the other side of the city center.

At this time, in one of the conference rooms of this hotel, Jiang Jun, who led the team before and other staff members, including the rest of the men on the Tianlong City Tianjiao list, all appeared here.

At this time, seeing Qian Jin brought Lin Xiu in, their eyes were full of surprise.

“Lin Xiu, you’re back?

Jiang Jun was explaining something when his eyes widened.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded.

“What happened that day?”

Jiang Jun continued to speak at this time.

“Nothing, there was a little accident.”

Lin Xiu smiled lightly.

“Why are you pretending, do you think that when you arrive in Fengyun City, you can still get the first place so easily?” A warrior who was very unhappy with Lin Xiu’s top place on the Tianjiao list said coldly.

“Want to give it a go?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and looked at him.

The warrior suddenly felt a powerful murderous aura envelop him, making him feel like he was falling into an ice cave.

His body trembled and cold sweat was already pouring out of his forehead.

“Okay, Lin Xiu is back, let’s talk about tomorrow’s schedule now.”

At this time, Jiang Jun said suddenly.

As Lin Xiu looked away, the warrior heaved a sigh of relief.

Sitting on the chair beside him, his legs seemed to have no strength to stand up again.

This guy, what the hell is going on, his power is so much stronger now.

The rest of the warriors looked at Lin Xiu’s figure and were secretly shocked.

Because the power that Lin Xiu has displayed now is much stronger than before.

It’s only been a month.

Lin Xiu was also sitting on a chair at this time and heard Jiang Jun’s explanation.

Tomorrow, it will be the warrior conference, the preliminaries for the finals of the Fengyun City.

Start at eight in the morning, they will arrive at the competition venue, then draw lots.

The advanced warriors will go to the next round of competition.

Tomorrow, 36 strong players will be selected and on the second day, the final of the top 36 will compete.

“You guys have to go all out, as long as you enter the top 36, you will definitely be seen by the major forces and your future will definitely be limitless.”

Jiang Jun warned.

“En!”

Their hands clenched into fists and they nodded immediately.

The main purpose of participating in the warrior competition was to show one’s strength in front of the major forces.

The higher the ranking, the more people would pay attention to you.

Maybe some big forces will find and accept them, which is also very beneficial for their future development.

“If any of us can make it to the top three, that would be great.”

Jiang Jun spoke, then shook his head again.

Tianlong City was just a small town. If there were really top three warriors from this place, it would be incredible.

Soon, after Jiang Jun’s explanation was complete, they disbanded.

“By the way, Lin Xiu, I received a courier for you before.”

At this moment, Qian Jin patted his head, as if he had thought of something and said aloud.

“My courier?”

Hearing Qian Jin’s voice, Lin Xiu also had a curious look in his eyes.

In Fengyun City, Lin Xiu didn’t seem to know anyone yet someone delivered something to him?

“Well, it seems to be Liu Yanran from Tianlong City.”

Liu Yanran?

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment and he quickly thought of the woman he met when he first came to Marqi Planet.

What did she send?

Just when Lin Xiu was a little confused, Qian Jin took out a square courier and handed it to Lin Xiu.

This courier box was specially set, so ordinary people can’t open it, only Lin Xiu could perform facial recognition.

He was fighting in Tianlong City before and there was a video, so she could use it for the courier to recognize his face.

Kacha—

After he performed facial recognition authentication, the box opened automatically.

“Hehe, did you hook up with this beauty from the Liu family?”

At this time, Qian Jin showed an ambiguous smile to Lin Xiu.

“Move aside.”

Lin Xiu glared at him and said aloud.

He looked at the box and there was a card in it.

What is this?

The cards were like skills cards, but they didn’t have any obvious tiers.

He picked it up and took a closer look. There were three big characters written on it: ‘Levitation’.

Is this the secret book of that warrior family?

However, Lin Xiu really needed the Levitation skill.

After the most powerful old man of the Wu family was killed by Lin Xiu, the Wu family was probably annexed by the Liu family, right?

Otherwise, how would she find this ‘Levitation’.

“Thank you.”

Looking at this skill card, Lin Xiu said out loud to himself. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“What exactly is it?”

Qian Jin looked at the card curiously.

From the back of the card, he couldn’t tell what it was at all.

“I’ll go back to train first, see you tomorrow.”

Lin Xiu smiled lightly, then left.
