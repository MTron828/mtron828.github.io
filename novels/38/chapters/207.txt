Chapter 208: Fallen!

“Battles against rank 8 and above evolved beasts are mostly large scale battles with many warriors, especially that this peak rank 8 Ice crystal white bird is so large.”

“The battle will last for 72 hours and longer.”

Luo Yue opened her eyes and explained to Lin Xiu.

“So long?” Lin Xiu was slightly surprised at the fact.

He already felt that it was extremely difficult fighting against the rank 6 Green Vine beast that had killed many warriors the last time.

The rank 8 Ice crystal white bird was most probably even scarier.

“En, when I was 10, I went with my family to fight against a rank 9 evolved beast, the gold flames pangolin and it lasted for an entire week.” Luo Yue thought for a bit and replied.

Lin Xiu nodded his head subconsciously, then opened his eyes wide and swallowed a mouthful of saliva: “Hold up, you’re saying that you went to kill a rank 9 evolved beast at the age of 10?!”

A rank 8 evolved beast was already so perverse, one can only imagine that a rank 9 could easily raze a city in an instant?

“En… you can’t really say that. It was my family that fought, I only stood by the side and observed and gained battle experience.” Luo Yue thought for a bit before replying.

Lin Xiu wanted to comment that her family members were monsters…

It was already so taxing for the hundred of warriors to fight against a rank 8 evolved beast, but her family brought her to fight against a rank 9?

How powerful would they be?

“Seems like there are no rank 8 or above warriors that have come.” Lin Xiu looked over and said.

Luo Yue heard his words and looked at him as though she was looking at a fool, “You think you can see rank 8 warriors that easily?”

“There are very few rank 8 warriors in the world and the majority of warriors that are rank 8 or above have already gone to space or other planets to train.”

“There are extremely few rank 9 or above evolved beasts on earth and most of them are in slumber.”

Just as Luo Yue spoke up, another intense vibration occurred.

As though another earthquake was coming.

They looked at the battlefield and saw huge laser artillery shells flying towards the Ice crystal white bird.

“The union army is back again?” Lin Xiu looked at the gigantic laser artillery and asked with surprise.

The Ice crystal white bird had to fight against the warriors while avoiding the sudden appearance of laser artillery. Due to the barrage, it was struck by a few of the laser artillery.

Its originally crystal white body started to have black spots on its back as blood started to fall.

Its eyes suddenly turned red as it suddenly flapped its wings and unleashed a terrifying cold wind.

Many terrifying tornadoes started to manifest. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

They circled around its body

When the laser artillery collided with the tornadoes, they were actually repelled back!

Rumble-

The repelled laser artillery struck the ground and produced loud and powerful explosions.

“Quick, we need to take the chance to attack, the Ice crystal white bird is almost spent!!!” The warriors saw the tornadoes and became even more excited instead of feeling fear.

The reason for this was that all evolved beasts would have a self-preservation skill that would be unleashed when it was near death.

It seemed that the rank 8 Ice crystal white bird was drawing its last bit of energy

Just a bit more and the Ice crystal white bird would fall!

“Are we going to make a move now?” Lin Xiu realized that the Ice crystal white bird was slightly tired and asked Luo Yue.

He believed that the Ice crystal white bird would fall soon and all the warriors had been fighting for an entire night, so they would be at their weakest.

They had the highest chance if they took action now!

“Not yet, the battle has just begun.” Luo Yue shook her head and replied.

‘Just began?’

Lin Xiu was stunned, he turned to look at the battlefield, the Ice crystal white bird’s eyes were scarlet red as though it had gone berserk and relied on the small tornadoes around it that acted as barriers to attack.

Rumble rumble-

Under the manic claw attacks, many gorges were formed on the ground

“Kill!!!” The warriors were obviously too engrossed in the battle and attacked without a care for their lives.

The union army soldiers carried their advanced weapons and charged forward. In time, even more explosions and fighting sounds could be heard.

The battle continued from one day, two days, until the third day morning, where they continued to fight!

Warriors came in batches and attacked the Ice crystal white bird, that had many wounds on its body and the snow-white beauty was long gone.

“Almost time.” A few warriors hiding immediately rushed forward when they witnessed the scene!

“Let’s go!” Luo Yue sensed the opportunity and immediately leaped out!

Lin Xiu tensed his body and followed behind Luo Yue and jumped out of the window down 15 stories.

Lin Xiu did not overtrain himself and used his cultivation technique to absorb the energy in the air to strengthen his own body.

He was currently in his best state!

The two figures jumped out of the building quickly and charged forward!

“All out attack now!!!” The strong warrior with the double-sided giant ax commanded.

His eyes were filled with excitement. ‘Just a bit more, just a bit more and we will kill the rank 8 Ice crystal white bird!’

At that moment, all the warriors that heard his command clenched their teeth and unleashed their powerful skills again towards the wounded Ice crystal white bird.

It no longer had the strength to resist and blood sprayed out from all their attacks like rain.

Its large body started to fall.

Thud-

A loud thud resounded as its entire body fell to the ground.

The rank 8 Ice crystal White Bird had fallen!
