Chapter 624: About the Sky Academy

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

It was the first time that Lin Xiu saw this kind of swordsmanship and martial arts, and he thought it was very interesting.

Boom—

But just when they were about to attack Lin Xiu, Huang Zhen and Qian Yao had already rushed up from behind!

They were holding a warhammer and a giant shield respectively. As the source energy of their bodies burst out, the giant shield suddenly transformed into a huge transparent shield, which directly blocked Lin Xiu!

Boom—

The swordsmanship used by the five members of Feiyi Academy was blocked by Qian Yao’s giant shield!

“[Angry Strike]!”

Huang Zhen let out a loud roar, and the huge warhammer in his hand slammed into it!

Boom—

Although the people from Feiyi Academy quickly dodged, they still felt a little pain in their bodies after the huge impact.

And at this time, the entire competition platform was shaking.

“Get ready for the second set of plans!” Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

A man shouted loudly as he stepped back.

“No chance.”

But at the next moment, a voice came from behind him!

boom–

As soon as the man felt pain in his body, he was directly knocked out!

He slammed into the stone pillar below the competition stage!

“team leader!”

When the rest of the Feiyi Academy saw this scene, their expressions changed greatly.

“There are still two seconds, enough.”

Before they could react, they heard Lin Xiu’s voice again.

But their eyes couldn’t catch Lin Xiu’s trace, they could only see black shadows flashing by!

bang bang bang-

Before they could react, they were directly swept away by Lin Xiu’s spear!

“Damn it! I haven’t done it yet!”

Ouyang Hang saw that Lin Xiu had already put all the people of Feiyi Academy on the competition stage, so he couldn’t help but say aloud.

At this moment, Baili Haoling spread out his hands a little helplessly.

“This... is it over?”

The surrounding audience looked a little dumbfounded at this time.

It’s over so quickly!

“It’s too fast...”

The host also swallowed secretly, and his eyes were full of surprise.

“This battle... Sanctuary Academy wins!”

But after all, his psychological quality is still very good, and he quickly reacted.

“Hahaha, I’m so sorry, they don’t care, they’re in a hurry.”

At the same time, Bai Litao, who was on the other side of the podium, wiped his beard and said with a big laugh.

Lin Xiu just looked up and saw Bai Litao sitting on the long rostrum in the middle.

This old guy is here too?

“It seems that the students of your Sanctuary College who participated in this year’s competition are a bit interesting.”

The rest of the people sitting beside Bai Litao all laughed and said.

“However, when the people from the first team of our Interstellar Academy come over, we may be sorry.”

At this time, an old man about the same age as Bai Litao said with a strange smile.

“Why, don’t you take the people from our Sky Academy in your eyes?”

Another old man touched his beard and said.

This seemingly harmonious rostrum seems a bit undercurrent.

“I looked at the schedule. After this battle is over, our next game will be in the afternoon. You can now move freely.”

Baili Haoling said to Lin Xiu and the others who had returned to his seat to rest.

“Well, I’ll watch the game first.”

Lin Xiu said with a smile.

“Qian Yao and I went to see the weapons.” Huang Zhen thought for a while, then said aloud.

The warhammer and shield they bought this time were temporary, and they didn’t fit well, so they wanted to go and have a look.

“Have you brought enough money?”

Lin Xiu said curiously.

Because Sanctuary College has a complete point exchange system, they don’t need alliance coins at all.

Ordinary students of Sanctuary Academy don’t have much Alliance Coins.

“Well, we went to pawn the different crystals and exchanged a lot.” Qian Yao said with a smile.

“I’ll go with you. After all, I’m familiar with Sky City.”

Ouyang Hang also stood up and said at this time.

“Okay.” Huang Zhen and Qian Yao laughed.

“Next battle, attack me!”

Before Qian Yao left, Ouyang Hang and Huang Zhen gave Lin Xiu a vicious look and said.

In the battle just now, he won without doing anything at all, which made him very unhappy.

“Are you waiting for someone?”

Baili Haoling seemed to have thought of something at this time, and then looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“Who’s waiting for someone?”

Lin Xiu spread his hands and said.

“Cut, a woman’s sixth sense is still very accurate, don’t try to lie to Master!”

Baili Haoling put his hands on his hips and raised his head.

“Hehehe... It’s just you who are still women...”

Lin Xiu looked at her figure that looked like a junior high school student, and couldn’t help but have black lines all over her head.

“By the way, Sky Academy, isn’t it a high school academy?”

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something at this time, and then said to Baili Haoling.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu like an idiot and said, “There is a university department.”

“Oh.” Lin Xiu suddenly realized at this time, because the former Zhuo Qixing was said to be the number one high school student in the Sky Academy.

That guy was beaten to death by himself at the time, and he doesn’t know what to do now.

“In the past, the most powerful one in China was our Sanctuary College, but because of some connections later, all the students of our Sky College were snatched away, which gradually led to the fact that the current Sky College may be stronger than our Sanctuary College. .”

At this time, Baili Haoling looked at the competition stage where the next match was already starting, and said as if talking to himself.

“Before there was a person who was number one in Sky City High School to study in our college.”

Lin Xiu said curiously at this time.

It turns out that Sky City has a tendency to overtake Sanctuary College, so why does Zhuo Qixing still come here to study?

“Hmph, isn’t it sent by Sky City to explore the secrets of our Sanctuary Academy?”

Said this, Baili Haolin suddenly sneered.

“secret?”

Lin Xiu was taken aback.

“Didn’t you already have that secret?”

Baili Haoling said lightly at this time.

Hearing what she said, Lin Xiu suddenly realized something.

Could it be... the Tower of Trials?

“What’s on the top of the tower?”

At this time, Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu curiously and said.

“I couldn’t get past the last few floors of the challenge before. I originally wanted to try again when I came back this time, but I heard that your kid has already reached the top.”

Having said this, Baili Haoling seems to be a little depressed.

“Nothing, some books.”

Lin Xiu said with a smile.

“Sky Academy Team...”

At this moment, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed when he heard the Sky Academy.

“The people from Sky Academy are here.”

Looking over at the competition platform, you can clearly see a somewhat familiar figure standing on it!
