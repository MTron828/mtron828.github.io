Chapter 138: The Unexpected Skill!

Lin Xiu’s body froze as all the hair on his body stood erect.

It was as though he had fallen into deep danger and was about to die.

At this time, he did not hesitate to activate fury!

Screw it, I will kill all of them in the shortest period of time!

When he used Fury, his strength, speed, and reaction time grew substantially!

Lin Xiu saw the spear moving towards him as though it was in slow-mo.

No, it was not slow but his reaction time had been strengthened!

Dark Edge in his hand moved and blocked the warrior’s spear tip!

Right when the two spears collided, an immense force was transmitted into the man’s hands.

His hands immediately turned numb.

The spear that was about to pierce into Lin Xiu’s body was flung away along with the warrior!

“Torrential storm of rose flowers!” Lin Xiu did not know why people would shout out their skill names in the middle of battle.

But right at this moment, he felt that shouting like that made his blood boil even further.

Lin Xiu suddenly noticed a strange occurrence, there seemed to be flashes of light on the warrior’s body.

Wait a minute…. Could that be…

Lin Xiu immediately became ecstatic, it was exactly the same when he gained Profound Intent Torrential storm of rose flowers!

Dark Edge seemed to have sensed its master’s ferocious battle intent. It stabbed forward and transformed into cold auras!

The two other warriors were stunned, they never expected Lin Xiu to suddenly erupt with so much strength and speed.

“I am the real king of the spear!” The man wanted to employ his own skill when he saw many cold lights in front of him.

Clank clank clank –

He wanted to block the attacks but Lin Xiu’s attacks with Profound Intent Torrential storm of rose flowers were aimed at his flaws

His entire body was stabbed more than 10 times in a short span of time!

He was riddled with holes.

In the next moment after a loud bang, his body exploded into dust.

The two warriors were overwhelmed with shock. Strong, he’s too strong, that was an instant kill!

How many stabs did he unleash in that instant?!

Their eyes towards Lin Xiu changed to fear.

The notification of killing a warrior sounded out in his mind but Lin Xiu did not stop and continued to charge ahead

He could not waste a second because Fury had a time limit!

Once the time limit was up, he would be doomed!

“Stop holding back! Use your strongest skill!!” The warrior wielding two sabers had all the hair on his body standing straight up as he roared through clenched teeth.

The two looked at each other and unleashed all of their power and charged at Lin Xiu!

“Gold skill – Mountain Collapse Explosion!”

“Gold skill – Red Lotus Fury!”

The two leaped into the air and unleashed attacks from midair!

The ground split under the pressure of the powerful blades. A large gorge formed from beneath the warrior into the distance, as though he had cut the desert in two!

Grit and sand flew everywhere.

On the other hand, the other warrior unleashed a slash that produced a blazing red lotus which transformed into a fiery crescent blade!

Rumble-

The spot that Lin Xiu was on instantly blew up into a large pit under the two horrifying attacks. The original level desert suddenly had a large pit.

Is he dead?!

The two dropped back down to the ground and looked towards the location of colossal damage. As the dust scattered, they saw a gigantic pit and deep gorges but not a sight of Lin Xiu’s figure!

They knew how powerful their all-out skills were, but did not have the absolute confidence that it could kill Lin Xiu.

“Impossible! He should be dead!!!” One of the men panicked when they did not see Lin Xiu’s body.

The reality of their comrade that died had left a shadow in his heart. He did not expect Lin Xiu’s strength to grow suddenly. It was too inconceivable!

Hold up….

The other warrior suddenly felt a powerful aura coming from above.

“What… is that?!”

He raised his head to look only to see that the originally pitch-black sky was suddenly covered with stars.

The stars were dazzling and slowly became denser, it was like the resplendence of the galaxy river!

“One more minute… is more than enough…” Lin Xiu held the spear with both hands and sped downwards from high up in the sky!

“It’s the brat!” The two saw the figure from amongst the stars.

Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

How was it possible for a kid to unleash so much power in a moment and leap above them to dodge their strongest skill and actually unleash his own from above?

What kind of skill is that to be able to unleash from so high up?!

Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall!

High up in the sky and charging down, Lin Xiu could feel his clothes fluttering rapidly.

The originally pitch black Dark Edge seemed to have turned into a white aura and was extremely dazzling!

“He’s trying to deceive us!!!” The two rank 3 warriors roared and were about to unleash their skills when they sensed Lin Xiu and the spear became one!

As though they were under the powerful splash of a large waterfall!

Rumble-

After the loud sound, the bodies of the two warriors instantly exploded into pieces!

All the sand on the ground rose and it looked like sand rain as it fell from the sky.

20 Seconds left!

At this time, Lin Xiu saw Luo Yue tangled with Wan Hu and immediately charged over!

Luo Yue was severely injured and Wan Hu was not attacking her directly but making use of guerilla warfare to tire her out. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He was obviously trying to exhaust Luo Yue until she had no strength left!
