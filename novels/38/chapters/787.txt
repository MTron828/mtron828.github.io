Chapter 788: Lightning King

They were all stunned, because three Lin Xiu appeared in three directions around here.

Every Lin Xiu seems to be real and it is impossible to distinguish the real from the fake!

What exactly is going on?!

Sun Zi was originally laughing, but at this time the smile froze.

The warriors behind him have unbelievable expressions in their eyes.

Why, why did three identical people suddenly appear?

“Hmph, do you think playing tricks would work?”

Yan Yongxin said with a sneer at this time.

Of these three, one must be fake.

The fake one cannot have the same power as the real one.

With this thought, he glanced directly at the three Lin Xius.

How can it be!

But at this moment, the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

Because he clearly felt that the power of the three Lin Xiu seemed to be the same.

The source strength fluctuations were not strong.

How did he do that?!

At this moment, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes. Sure enough, as his level increased, the skills of the system were also optimized.

As long as he hasn’t attacked him yet, he can’t detect his ‘Disguise’ skill.

However, he used ‘Mirror Image’ as a stand-in before, it was rare to use the clone directly.

swoosh—

At the same time, the three Lin Xiu waved their spears at the same time, then pointed at Yan Yongxin over there.

Yan Yongxin’s face turned gloomy.

Now, he really has no way to judge which is the real Lin Xiu.

crackling-

But at this time, all the energy in his body was mobilized.

There was a sound like fried beans.

“‘Crushing Thunderbolt’!!!”

At this time, with his loud roar, a large amount of lightning bolts burst out from his body.

Then rush around!

Three very terrifying lightning bolts directly impacted Lin Xiu in three directions!

Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly. At this moment, instead of dodging, he directly charged towards Yan Yongxin.

And at the same time as it hit the past, a ‘Sphere’ instantly unfolded around his body.

Those lightning strikes that hit the ‘Sphere’ did not seem to kill Lin Xiu.

Whoosh whoosh— Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At the same time, the Dark Edge spear held by Lin Xiu also stabbed over!

Damn it!

Seeing this scene, the expression in Yan Yongxin’s eyes could not help but change slightly.

Once again, he unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

His source strength was very terrifying. At this time, as the ‘Sphere’ unfolded, the thickness of this ‘Sphere’ was also extraordinary.

The three Lin Xiu attacks hit his ‘Sphere’ in an instant.

Boom—

With a dull sound, two Lin Xius were directly destroyed by the terrifying lightning that Yan Yongxin released just now.

“So you are the real one!”

Yan Yongxin looked at Lin Xiu in front of him and said with a grin.

Lin Xiu originally wanted to attack him while he hadn’t reacted, but now he just unfolded the ‘Sphere’, which left Lin Xiu a little helpless.

The ‘Sphere’ of this King Warrior was not so easy to break.

Damn, Lin Xiu didn’t think of that just now.

“Go to hell!!!”

At this time, Yan Yongxin roared loudly and Lin Xiu felt a ‘Zizzizi’ sound behind him.

The pupils in his eyes shrank slightly and when he turned around abruptly, he saw two huge lightning hands appearing in the air behind Lin Xiu.

Before Lin Xiu could dodge, these two terrifying giant lightning hands pressed Lin Xiu’s body to the ground.

Boom—

At this moment, the whole ground made a loud noise.

“You die for me!!!”

Yan Yongxin grinned and waved his hand to attack Lin Xiu, who was pressed on the ground by the huge lightning hand!

Now, even if Lin Xiu uses ‘Sphere’, there was no way to escape!

A master warrior-level warrior couldn’t resist his strength!

“Hehe, if I die, he will die too.”

But just as he was about to punch Lin Xiu on the ground, he heard a voice coming from Lin Xiu’s mouth.

What is he talking about!?

Yan Yongxin frowned, but the fist in his hand was still about to hit Lin Xiu’s body.

“Uncle Yan!”

The moment his fist full of terrifying lightning was about to hit Lin Xiu, a voice came over.

Yan Yongxin’s pupils shrank slightly, then he looked behind him and he could clearly see where Sun Zi was.

But Sun Zi’s state was very strange. A square and translucent three-dimensional matrix ??actually covered his head.

“If you attack me, he will also die.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

His body was pressed to the ground by two extremely huge and terrifying lightning giant hands, unable to move at all.

A large amount of lightning struck Lin Xiu’s body, causing Lin Xiu to feel that his entire body was in great pain.

But in the same way, the ‘Engulf’ skill was also being activated.

10% of these energies were absorbed and turned into Lin Xiu’s experience.

The experience bar was also slowly increasing at this time.

“Humph! It’s just a little trick…” Yan Yongxin said with a sneer.

But just as he finished speaking, a man next to Sun Zi, whose head was also covered by a square matrix, widened his eyes instantly. The next moment, the entire matrix swelled up and exploded!

Boom—

After the head was blown off, blood splattered everywhere and the whole body fell directly to the ground.

When the grandson on the side saw this scene, his eyes were full of horror.

He wanted to struggle, but found that the square matrix didn’t budge at all.

When Yan Yongxin saw this scene, the look in his eyes became extremely ugly.

He found the mark on Lin Xiu’s forehead.

Black pattern print, spatial source mark.

The power of this type of source mark was too weird, it could be said to be the most mysterious source mark.

Unexpectedly, this kid actually realized this kind of source mark.

He wasn’t by Sun Zi’s side but Sun Zi’s head would probably explode just like the warrior just now!

At this time, the two giant lightning hands began to slowly disappear.

Yan Yongxin also stopped using his power.

Lin Xiu directly stood up holding the Dark Edge spear and looked at him without fear at all.

“Remove this thing.”

Yan Yongxin stared at Lin Xiu and said in a deep voice.

“Do you think it’s possible now?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, then said lightly.

“Boy, do you think I really dare not kill you.” Yan Yongxin’s face became extremely ugly.

“You really dare not.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.
