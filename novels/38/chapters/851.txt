Chapter 852: Holy-level skill!

“What happened!?”

Some warriors felt their spears vibrate, and they couldn’t help but be surprised.

And soon, these long spears were not under their control, and were directly separated from their hands.

They flew to the sky.

The same scene also appeared in various cities.

Not only the spears held in the hands of the warriors, but also the spears in the weapons stores, all of which seemed to be summoned.

All the spears flew to the other side.

This magical scene made all the warriors walk out of the street.

When they looked up, they could clearly see an extremely strange and shocking scene.

In the entire sky, there were a large number of spears, all flying in the same direction.

“This... is really magical…”

A large number of warriors walked out of the street, looking at this scene in the sky, their eyes widened, and they were beyond shocked.

“Courting death!!!”

Although Huang Ying didn’t know what Lin Xiu was doing, looking at the dazzling spear, it seemed like he was about to unleash an extremely powerful skill.

He roared angrily, then holding the sword ray transformed from the source strength, he rushed towards Lin Xiu again.

The long sword was about to continue slashing at Lin Xiu’s body.

Lin Xiu snorted coldly, waved the Dark Edge spear with both hands, and attacked directly!

Dangdang-

The figures of the two collided wildly in the air, like phantoms.

The thousands of warriors who watched this battle seemed to be unable to catch the traces of these two people.

‘Mountains and Rivers Slash’!!!

Huang Ying let out a roar, and the long sword in his hand slashed out again, bursting out an incomparably dazzling light.

A sword aura that was so huge that it seemed to be able to split the sky in an instant!

Lin Xiu’s body was instantly chopped in half!

Moreover, the sword aura also hit the peaks on the other side, instantly severing all those peaks horizontally.

Terrifying.

“Damn!”

Of course, Huang Ying wasn’t that easy to fool. He clearly felt that the one he had just beheaded was actually a fake clone.

Turning around and looking back, he saw three Lin Xiu suspended in the air.

He glanced over and found that the three Lin Xius’ strengths seemed to be exactly the same.

Compared to before, it has dropped a lot, probably only to the level of the first-level King warrior.

how can that be!?

Logically speaking, there is only one body!

What he didn’t know was that the ‘Disguise’ skill that Lin Xiu was using was already able to deceive him.

Because Lin Xiu’s current strength was not any weaker than Huang Ying, so Huang Ying can’t see through it at all.

The three Lin Xius radiated white light all over their bodies in three directions, as if the gods of war appeared in the world.

“Three...three Lin Xius!?”

Liu Pan, who was watching the broadcast of the battle in front of the screen, also opened his eyes wide.

“This kid... does he really want to kill His Majesty the Emperor?”

An Ruo was also in disbelief.

Before, he thought that Lin Xiu was a liar, but he never thought that the current Lin Xiu had grown to such a terrifying level.

Not only can he fight against Huang Ying, but he also seems to be evenly matched.

“‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!”

Lin Xiu, who was in three directions, used his skill power at the same time.

The long spear in his hand moved towards the figure of Huang Ying!

Three huge black dragons burst out from the spear in an instant.

Charging towards Huang Ying!

“Break!”

Seeing this scene, Huang Ying’s face showed incomparable anger.

He is the strongest person on the Marqi planet, since when was he ever forced to such a point!

The huge sword ray slashed horizontally towards the three black dragons that were charging over.

It was necessary to split all these black dragons in half.

Whizzing–

Sure enough, the two black dragons that attacked first were directly chopped in half by his sword ray.

The black smoke disappeared.

But one of the huge black dragons grabbed Huang Ying’s waist at once and charged towards the ground!

Damn it!!!

Huang Ying’s eyes widened, and he wanted to break free in anger.

However, the black dragon bit his body tightly and charges directly downwards!

Boom—

A loud noise sounded, the whole ground shook, and a huge pit suddenly appeared, raising a lot of thick dust.

“what!!!”

But at this moment, a huge roar came out, and the thick dust around it dissipated instantly.

The figure of Huang Ying appeared in it.

The gigantic black dragon that bit his body tightly was shaken and scattered. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Just when he looked up at the sky, the whole sky was full of spears.

Thousands of long spears, suspended in the air, all pointed to the position of the emperor below.

“goodbye.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were cold.

[Holy Level·Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers]!

This is the skill that Lin Xiu activated the system, which made this skill evolve directly into a holy-level skill.

“go!!!”

With a volley of the Dark Edge spear in his hand, the countless spears, as if feeling some kind of summoning, all charged downwards!

Whoosh whoosh—

Those long spears that rushed down at a rapid speed seemed to be burned by the friction of the air.

“Scram!!!”

When Huang Ying saw this scene, his eyes widened.

His eyes were full of anger and fear.

He felt that the power of this skill seemed to be able to kill him.

Huang Ying can’t do anything right now. With a thought, a ‘Sphere’ immediately unfolded.

bang bang bang-

A large number of spears, all charged down.

It directly hit the ‘Sphere’ that Huang Ying unfolded.

Huang Ying’s ‘Sphere’ seemed to be able to resist all the impacting spears.

But the spears that filled the sky kept pounding down, as if it were inexhaustible.

clack clack——

Cracks soon appeared on Huang Ying’s “Sphere”.

“Ah!!!”

He roared loudly, frantically mobilizing the strength of his whole body to maintain the integrity of this ‘Sphere’.

But because he used the powerful skill just now, his body’s source strength is obviously not sufficient anymore!

“Break it!”

Lin Xiu saw this scene, holding a long spear, his body rushed straight down from the air!

swoosh—

As if teleporting, he appeared in front of Huang Ying!

The Dark Edge spear held in both hands stabbed directly at his ‘Sphere’ that had cracked!

“No!!!”

His face changed greatly and he roared loudly.

pata——

With a crisp sound, the unfolded ‘Sphere’ burst directly!

Even if these spears are not magic weapons, the inertial force generated at this time is extremely powerful!

bang bang bang-

Thousands of spears stabbed Huang Ying’s body!
