Chapter 981: The Source Stone of Electricity!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Whoosh-”

Duan Zeyan was out of breath at this moment and cold sweat dripped down his forehead.

Although he has a ‘Sphere’ unfolded now, his entire body has been knocked away for quite some distance.

Taking a closer look, there were quite a few cracks on his ‘Sphere’.

The explosion just now was really terrifying.

!!

If it wasn’t for his quick reaction to unfold the ‘Sphere’, he would have died just now.

He looked around and found that the surrounding grass was a vast expanse of white, which looked very strange.

And Lin Xiu’s figure seemed to be still in front of him.

“I see…”

After the rock exploded, Lin Xiu could clearly see that there was an underground passage under the rock!

The explosion just now was terrifying to Duan Zeyan, but nothing to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu, who unfolded the “Sphere”, just resisted all the shocks.

Lin Xiu looked down, then walked directly down the passage.

The walls around this passage all radiated white light.

The whole channel looks very white and bright.

Lin Xiu quickly walked down and he could clearly see everything around him and it became very empty.

This is a very empty hall. In the middle of the hall, there is a prismatic stone that emits white light, suspended in the air.

“This is the energy source stone, right?”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

They had traveled far and wide looking for sth, only to find it right there in front of them.

This Duan Zeyan, who stayed here for ten years and didn’t find it, but Lin Xiu came here and found it on the first day.

Lin Xiu was looking forward to what he would get by collecting these five source stones.

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu walked directly to the middle.

“Lin Xiu, be careful!”

At this time, when Lin Xiu was about to walk towards the front, Duan Zeyan’s figure appeared in the back and he said aloud.

“Um?”

Lin Xiu looked back and immediately raised his brows.

“Have you seen the bottom? There are ultra-high voltage wires underground. As soon as you step on them, you will be electrocuted by those terrifying electricity!”

Duan Zeyan, who had just come down, looked at the bright floor on the ground and said suddenly.

He had seen this kind of thing when he completed the mission before.

At that time, he was almost electrocuted to death and when he thought about it, he couldn’t help but feel scared for a while.

“Is it just electricity?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“That’s easy.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Xiu walked over directly.

Duan Zeyan’s eyes widened, as if he could see Lin Xiu being smashed to pieces by those terrifying lightning bolts.

Boom—

Sure enough, as Lin Xiu walked over, a terrifying electric current burst out!

As the current burst out, the surrounding air exuded a burnt smell.

Those electric currents were transmitted to Lin Xiu’s body, causing Lin Xiu’s entire body to be wrapped in this terrifying electric current.

“Are… Are you okay?”

But what was unbelievable to Duan Zeyan was that Lin Xiu, surrounded by that terrifying electric current, seemed totally fine!

“It hurts a bit.”

Lin Xiu said aloud like he was talking to himself.

This electric current was indeed very powerful and terrifying, even more terrifying than the electric current released by Lin Xiu.

But even so, for Lin Xiu, it didn’t cause too much damage.

The skin on the body felt like it was about to be torn by the electric current.

Lin Xiu didn’t have so much scruples now and continued to walk towards the middle of the place.

Duan Zeyan’s eyes are wide open now, as if he’s been frightened.

Because Lin Xiu’s whole body was surrounded by terrifying electric currents at this moment.

But even so, he walked forward as if nothing was wrong.

How strong is this body’s resistance to electricity to be able to do this?

As Lin Xiu walked to the front of the energy source stone, as soon as he stretched out his hand, the energy source stone suddenly burst into a white light.

In the next moment, this energy source stone turned into a white light and entered Lin Xiu’s smart watch.

The surrounding current also disappeared at this moment!

“Congratulations! The source stone of electricity has been obtained!”

At this moment, a loud noise came.

It sounded in the entire Sage warrior space!

“You got it!?”

Duan Zeyan, who had been watching the scene in front of him, became excited at this time.

He has been here for so long without looking for any news about this so-called energy source stone, but Lin Xiu just came here on the first day and found it!

“Di di di-”

As Lin Xiu activated the smartwatch, as the screen was projected, he clicked the ‘Collect’ button in the sky and he could clearly see that the white ray of energy source stone appeared in this ‘Collect’ ‘ in the interface.

“Four more.”

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Grassland, wilderness, mountains, ancient ruins, ocean.”

“The five major sections of this world, the source stone of electricity from the grasslands has been collected. Next, we will go to other sections.”

Lin Xiu opened the map interface to take a look. This grassland was adjacent to wilderness and mountains.

After thinking about it, Lin Xiu was ready to leave for the wilderness.

“By the way, just now I heard the reminder that you have obtained the energy source stone. I think the grassland will be very dangerous tonight.”

Duan Zeyan did not hesitate at this time and spoke directly to Lin Xiu.

“Ok, I know.”

Lin Xiu nodded, then said lightly. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Just after he obtained the energy source stone, he had already heard the sound that seemed to be able to spread throughout the entire Sage warrior space.

This must be done deliberately by the Sage warriors who created this Sage warrior space.

The purpose was to let the warriors snatch the energy source stone, then the strongest warrior would be selected to obtain this energy source stone?

While thinking about it, he heard footsteps coming out of the passage.

There are people coming!

Hearing this voice, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

Although he knew that someone would come to snatch it, he didn’t expect that there would be so many people.

“This energy source stone is here?”

As soon as some warriors walked in, they said loudly.

Lin Xiu looked at the front and he could clearly see that there were more than a dozen warriors who had already walked over.

They all have source rings on their hands and obviously they are the same batch of warriors who came in.

“You two, who got the energy source stone?”

One of the warriors with a spear glanced at Lin Xiu and Duan Zeyan and said coldly.

The rest of the people also held the weapons in their hands and looked at Lin Xiu and Duan Zeyan, their eyes filled with ill intent.
