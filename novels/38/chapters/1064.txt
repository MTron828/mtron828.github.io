Chapter 1065: Meeting Ye Kai

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

All of the laser rays were about to land on the warrior’s ‘sphere’!

“He’s going to die.”

Lin Xiu looked at the scene happening before his eyes and mumbled to himself.

This was because these laser beams were different from the usual ones.

These have much stronger penetrative strength.

This man was an ordinary warrior and the ‘sphere’ that he had was obviously a weak one.

Boom boom boom – –

With no surprise, the entire ‘sphere’ broke into pieces as soon as it came into contact with the laser beams!

Without the protection from the ‘sphere’, all of the laser beams penetrated through the man’s body.

In a blink of an eye, the man was covered with bloody holes.

Then, his body fell onto the ground and there was blood splattered everywhere.

It was an incredibly bloody scene.

“That man was just asking for it. The Bai family’s defense system is one of the best on this planet.”

As the rest of the warriors watched what happened, some of them sneered instead and did not look sympathetic of what had happened to that man.

But, there was also another group of warriors that started trembling.

Whatever that happened earlier, it was too shocking for them.

Lin Xiu looked at the high wall and thought to himself, ‘if it was him, it would be a piece of cake to dodge them.’

By using ‘Flashing Souls’, he would have been able to jump across the walls.

“Move! Move aside!!”

Suddenly, there was a loud noise coming from outside.

All of the warriors surrounding the place turned towards the direction from where the noise was coming from.

When they took a closer look, they could clearly see that there was a group of warriors dressed in white, designated combat suits arresting a group of injured warriors with them.

“The warriors from the Bai family…”

The rest of the warriors mumbled to themselves as they made way for the group of warriors dressed in white.

Lin Xiu took a look at them as well. These warriors from the Bai family were weaponised and two of them would be holding onto one of the arrested warriors as they walked towards the entrance.

Behind them, there were also other warriors who were also doing the same.

“You better keep quiet!”

Then, one of the Bai warriors screamed at his convicts.

The warrior being held was a muscular one but he was in a mess now.

His clothes were torn and there were multiple wounds on his face.

Wait….isn’t that…

With one glance, Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank.

This was because this man was none other than Ye Kai!

Ye Kai! The man who came with him to Nano Planet!

How on earth did Uncle Ye end up here?

He even got arrested by the Bai family.

Seeing what was happening, Lin Xiu had a change of emotions.

The gates to the Bai estate were now opened and the warriors dressed in the special combat suits were entering the estate with the warriors that they arrested.

Lin Xiu hid amongst the crowd.

Then, he quietly changed into another set of equipment and put on a mask.

He found another area where there was no one there and then stared at the high walls before him.

As he gathered his thoughts, he quickly flew into the air!

Xiu – –

As he was lifted off the ground, Lin Xiu quickly activated ‘Flashing Souls’!

The laser beams didn’t even detect Lin Xiu’s presence and he had already entered the estate.

Beyond the walls were a huge piece of forest and there was only one way in the center of it that leads to the peak of the mountain.

The Bai family lived on the peak of the mountain.

“You really asked for it by going against the Bai family.”

The warriors from the Bai family mocked the warriors that they had arrested.

“If it wasn’t because they wanted you alive, all of you would have died by now!”

As the warriors from the Bai family were continuously complaining, they were hitting the injured warriors with their tasers that were filled with strong energy currents.

“AHHHHHHHH!!!!”

The currents were horrifying and most of the warriors screamed in pain.

There was only one that remained strong in his feet and grinned his teeth while enduring the pain.

This was obviously Ye Kai.

“Yo…..you’re quite vigilant, aren’t you?”

The warrior from the Bai family that was holding onto the taser scoffed when he saw how Ye Kai still remained on his foot.

Then, he raised the taser in his hand and was about to hit Ye Kai once again!

Sizzling – –

This time, the current has been switched onto its strongest mode.

The current was so strong that there was a burnt smell in the air.

When Ye Kai saw the taser, his pupil trembled.

There was a possibility that this horrifying current would instantly electrocute him!

It’s over!

Bakk – –

Then, right at that moment, there was a clear explosion heard and the taser exploded!

The horrifying currents were released and it was transmitted onto the warrior that was holding onto it.

The warrior’s eyes were opened wide and he screamed out loud.

Soon, there were high smokes that came out of his body.

“What’s the matter?”

When the rest of the warriors from the Bai family saw what happened, they frowned.

“The taser exploded.”

One of the warriors who were closer, answered the question subconsciously.

The taser exploded?

The rest of them were shocked as well.

The quality of these tasers were the best and there has never been a problem with it. How did it explode?

“Captain!”

Then, there was another warrior who seemed to be of a higher level that appeared.

“What’s the matter?”

The muscular warrior, who was the captain, asked in a cold tone.

“The taser that he used exploded…..”

Another warrior who answered him was trembling.

He didn’t dare to look at the muscular pain standing in front of him and he looked scared.

“Dumbassess! Are you saying that he killed himself?”

The captain screamed in rage.

After hearing what was asked, the rest of the warriors shut their mouths. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

However, Ye Kai felt a little suspicious.

No….this was not an accident. There was someone else….who had helped him.

Right at that moment, he clearly felt that there were other energies around him.

It was obvious that there was someone else that caused the explosion when the man was using the taser.

That was why this had happened.

But, who was it?

The captain from the Bai family inspected the ashes of the taser that had exploded and his pupil shrank.

“This place has been breached!”

One of the warriors screamed out loud.

Breached?!

After hearing what the captain said, all of the warriors from the Bai family started looking serious.

They held onto their weapons and they had to be alert!
