Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Koong Loong – –

The stage continued shaking as Lin Xiu held his spear high up in the air and aimed it onto the ground.

However, as Lin Xiu’s spear reached the round, the audience noticed that the flaming birds were headed for the ground. Zhuo Qixing was fine!

This was because he had already released his ‘Yuan’!

His ‘Yuan’ was bright, white in colour and it was able to block all of Lin Xiu’s attacks.

Zhuo Qixing still held onto his sword and it was glowing brightly as well.

“You’re dead!” Zhuo Qixing had a twisted expression on his face as he looked at Lin Xiu who was in the air. Zhuo Qixing roared as he gathered all of his energy on the sword and dashed through the flames around him, headed towards Lin Xiu!

‘Sword across the Clouds’!

The strongest attack he had!

His speed was tremendously fast and even though Lin Xiu had a quick reflex, he was still cut on the shoulders and it even broke through his combat suit.

Lin Xiu could feel a sharp pain on his shoulder.

At that moment, Lin Xiu got back onto the ground as well to take a look at his shoulder. The part protecting his shoulder has been exposed and his wound looked horrible but with Lin Xiu’s healing abilities, it was already slowly healing on its own.

“That’s all you got?” Lin Xiu looked at Zhuo Qixing as he said with a flat tone.

That attack was actually really strong and if it wasn’t because he was fast enough, his head would have exploded.

“From now on, you will not be as lucky.” Zhuo Qixing got even furious after hearing what Lin Xiu said to him.

He hated Lin Xiu to the bones.

The sword in his hand was still glowing brightly and with all of his energy being transferred into the sword, there was a terrifying energy source surrounding it.

“I should be the one saying that.” Lin Xiu pointed his spear at Zhuo Qixing before heading towards him!

“You asked for it!” Zhuo Qixing saw Lin Xiu coming towards him and he gritted his teeth while thrusting his sword towards Lin Xiu!

Boom boom boom – –

As the weapons collided, there were loud explosive noises that echoed around the room.

Lin Xiu’s spear landed on Zhuo Qixing’s protective shield and the powerful impact from the attack caused Zhuo Qixing to take a few steps backwards.

He was about to thrust his sword into Lin Xiu but he was just too quick. Lin Xiu pushed his sword away with his spear and with a strong twist of the arm, the spear was aimed towards Zhuo Qixing.

“Hmph! This brat really thinks that he can break that!” The Vice Chancellor of the Sky Academy sneered when he saw how his students were being defeated. He actually looked anxious.

“You think that he couldn’t?” Baili Tao said in a calm tone.

The vice chancellor sneered and did not continue. From his point of view, it was impossible since Zhuo Qixing was a rank 8 warrior.

“Hey? That guy looks familiar.” At that time, back at the audience seat, Nan Huang suddenly saw Lin Xiu who was on the stage.

Luo Yue could clearly see his figure as well and her eyes were looking onto Lin Xiu.

He’s here.

The look in Yu Muchen’s eyes changed.

He’s here but with his abilities, would he be able to stand out in such an important competition?

“That’s the guy that you were with right?” Nan Huang looked towards Luo Yue and asked.

Luo Yue did not bother answering him, she didn’t even turn to look at him.

“I’m talking to you. Can’t you hear me?” Nan Huang stared at Luo Yue and continued asking.

“If you say another word, I will kill you.” Luo Yue remained motionless as she replied with a cold tone.

“HAHAHAHA, do you think that you can? The things that your family has done would be enough to ruin the entire Luo family!”

Nan Huang seemed to know the secrets of the Luo family as he ridiculed Luo Yue.

“It’s none of my business.”

Luo Yue answered calmly.

Then, Luo Yue turned to him with her cold eyes and said, “If anything happens to the Luo family, the Nan family would be in trouble as well.”

“Are you threatening me?” Nan Huang laughed instead.

“I am.”

Luo Yue said with a cold tone.

Boom – –

Back on the stage, Lin Xiu was still thrusting his spear onto Zhuo Qixing’s yuan. It was followed by a loud explosion.

“You can’t even break my ‘Yuan’ and you think that you can kill me?” Zhuo Qixing said while Lin Xiu was still attacking him. He had no other choice but to take a few steps backwards. It was followed by a loud roar before he attacked Lin Xiu once again.

“I wouldn’t need Yuan to fight you.”

Lin Xiu said as he continued blocking Zhuo Qixing’s attack with his spear.

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, Zhuo Qixing’s face looked even more horrible. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Lin Xiu was right. Lin Xiu did not release his ‘Yuan’ while fighting him!

It was as if he wasn’t afraid of Zhuo Qixing’s attacks!

“Go to hell!”

Zhuo Qixing held onto his sword with his left hand and it was once again glowing with a bright light. He wanted to release another skill.

“Move!”

Lin Xiu widened his eyes as he slowly gathered his energy together. The spear that was previously white in colour had now turned to dull red!

“His weapon changed!”

When Yu Muchen saw the changes happening on Lin Xiu’s weapon, he had a bad feeling about it.

His six sense tells him that there was something peculiar about Lin Xiu’s weapon.

“It’s useless! You won’t be able to break mine!”

Zhuo Qixing looked at Lin Xiu who was continuously attacking him and he roared in fury.

Lin Xiu ignored him and continued his attack. He turned his spear downwards at a slanted angle.

Boom – –

With a loud sound, the spear pierced through his ‘Yuan’ and there was a huge cut on it!

Shhhhhhh—

Then, there was a sound similar to glass being shattered as his ‘Yuan’ cracked and exploded!

His ‘Yuan’ broke!

How is this even possible?!

Yu Muchen, who was paying attention to Lin Xiu, was shocked as well.

‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks The City’!

Seeing how Zhuo Qixing was still in shock and his eyes couldn’t believe what he was seeing, Lin Xiu did not waste the opportunity to continue his attack!

The spear that was dark red in colour suddenly let out a large amount of particles that were black in colour.

The black particles gathered together in the form of a dragon’s head and it was headed towards Zhuo Qixing’s head.

Kong – –

While the dragon was biting onto Zhuo Qixing’s head, Lin Xiu swung his spear around!

Boom boom boom – –

Lin Xiu continuously attacked Zhuo Qixing and there were loud explosives following one after the other.

“AHHHHHH!!!!”

A loud, dying cry came from Zhuo Qixing but at this moment, he did not have the chance to defend himself!
