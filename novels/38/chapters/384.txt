Chapter 385: Sudden Change

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Could it be because the guy kept running to the lightning, letting the lightning strike him which angered the thunderbirds?” A warrior looked at Lin Xiu then said aloud.

“It’s possible.” Another man nodded in agreement.

Lan Tu thought it was strange but they also felt that the warrior made sense.

Thunderbird, a high-level evolved beast, already has a certain amount of intelligence. Watching Lin Xiu running to the lightning, it was very likely to irritate the thunderbirds.

But if they got angry, shouldn’t they attack Lin Xiu...

Before he had time to think about it, the sound from the air became louder and louder at this time.

Bang bang——

Hearing this sound, Lin Xiu raised his head and looked at the sky. In the dark clouds and fog above, there were already many lightning flashes.

Thunderbirds flew amongst the lightning and they continued to absorb the lightning.

Feeding on the lightning – although this scene was shocking, Lin Xiu has not paid attention to this aspect.

Because Lin Xiu clearly felt it now; the next lightning strike should be the most frequent and scariest in the past three days.

Although he didn’t know what was going on, it should be a good thing for him.

“Everyone, be careful!” Lan Tu glanced at the men who were also detained on Friday and said aloud.

When these people heard Lan Tu’s words, they nodded and their faces showed a cautious look that they had never had before.

“Kid, although I don’t know what the hell you are doing but let me tell you, don’t deliberately rush into the storm!” A warrior glared at Lin Xiu and threatened.

Lin Xiu glanced at him, then looked up at the thunderbirds that were constantly flying in the sky.

“I’m talking to you, did you hear me!” The warrior saw Lin Xiu ignoring him and immediately felt that his ego had been insulted, so he reached out and grabbed Lin Xiu.

Crackling——

But at this moment, with a strange crackling sound, there was something emitting a strong light blue light appearing in front of his eyes!

Before he could make any movements, his eyes widened and were full of shock when he looked at the huge round lightning ball that appeared in front of him.

And in the middle of the lightning ball, it was Lin Xiu’s fist!

“Don’t simply touch me.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

This fist that was covered in terrifying lightning kept flashing in front of him and it looked terrifying. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The power of the lightning around his fist was not inferior to the lightning bolts that fell from the sky.

But soon, Lin Xiu withdrew his fist.

The man also went limp at this time and almost sat on the ground with his legs weak.

The rest of the people looked at this scene and were also surprised. At this time, they didn’t dare to say anything.

“The power of ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’ seemed to have become a lot stronger…” Lin Xiu mumbled to himself with his back facing the other warriors.

And at this moment, a loud noise echoed again.

The whole sky appeared to be blown apart.

The lightning that has been brewing for a long time was finally about to burst out completely!

As the lightning fell, the eyes of the people around him changed drastically and all their physical strength burst forth.

Bang bang——

One after another flashes of lightning fell from the sky.

And the intensity of this lightning was more concentrated and terrifying than all of the others previously.

These warriors were dodging crazily at this time and they dare not relax at all, because they would be seriously injured if they got struck by the lightning of this magnitude.

Lin Xiu watched the large number of lightning bolts falling and didn’t dodge at all, allowing these lightning bolts to strike his body.

It was really painful but at the same time, Lin Xiu also felt that his body was absorbing the energy generated by the lightning.

During the past two days, Lin Xiu’s skin was scorched because of the lightning and the scorched skin fell off, revealing his new skin and the new skin seemed to become tougher.

No matter how the lightning struck this time, the skin on Lin Xiu’s body has not turned black.

The ‘Engulf’ skill was constantly improving at this moment and the numbers in the experience column were also turning rapidly.

Getting struck by the lightning, Lin Xiu has completely ignored the pain and got a little excited instead.

“Damn, this kid is really abnormal!” Lan Tu was accidentally struck by a flash of lightning when he was dodging it and he grimaced in pain.

He happened to see Lin Xiu over there and couldn’t help cursing.

“Help!”

“Help...!”

At the same time, many warriors had been struck by lightning and they wailed.

Because the lightning bolts this time was very concentrated, so they had no way to dodge.

And because it uses up their strength and their current strength was not comparable to when they first entered so their reaction ability had been greatly reduced.

Most of the warriors were wailing after they got struck and some of their bodies were scorched black.

Soon, it seemed that the guards had also discovered this unusual scene. Suddenly, several guards wearing special isolation lightning uniforms rushed in.

The guards were stunned to see this.

There were numerous thunderbirds in the sky constantly screaming, and the lightning was too concentrated.

This strange scene shocked the guards who had been guarding here for many years.

But they reacted quickly and rushed in, carrying out all those warriors who were struck by lightning and could no longer move because of the intense pain.

The guards wore a full set of clothing that shielded them from lightning and these flashes of lightning did not have much impact on them.

One after another, except for Lin Xiu and Lan Tu, the warriors were all lifted away.

“You should get out too, this place is too dangerous now.” A guard saw that Lan Tu’s skin was scorched.

Lan Tu nodded, looked at Lin Xiu’s side, and found that Lin Xiu was still standing there, letting the lightning strike his body constantly!
