Chapter 391: I Want Your Bird

Lin Xiu was telling the truth. The Fire Scale Combat suit was indeed useless to him while he was fighting in the Dark Forest.

“I can take it back but there is some damage to it. I only take it for 50 thousand points.” The elder said while laughing out loud.

The elder was disappointed to learn that Lin Xiu hadn’t found the Dark Spider Lily but there was nothing he could do about it now.

“Alright.” Lin Xiu nodded his head since this combat suit was really of no use to him now with his current condition.

The elder kept the combat suit and asked Lin Xiu with a curious look in his eyes, “If that’s the case, you still owe me 50 thousand points. What are you going to do about it?”

“I’ll return it to you.” Lin Xiu said calmly. He took out his school ID with his left hand and passed it to the elder.

“Oh?” When the elder saw his actions, the look in his eyes changed. He took over Lin Xiu’s card, swiped it, and found out that there were 150 thousand points in it.

“This is quite a large amount of points.” The elder laughed while transferring away 50 thousand of the points from Lin Xiu’s card.

Lin Xiu didn’t feel distressed either since there were still a lot of points left.

“Is there anything else that you would like to exchange for?” The elder looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would come all the way here just to return him the suit and the points that he owed.

Plus, Lin Xiu was looking around as if he was looking for something.

“Do you have anything that can maintain a cold temperature? It’ll be best if it’s a refrigerator.” Lin Xiu thought about it for a minute before asking.

“What do you want it for?” The elder was stunned and subconsciously asked the question.

This was because most of them were only here for weapons or combat suits. As for the rest, it was rare that they would look for anything else.

Chirp Chirp – –

Then, at that moment, a chirping sound came from Lin Xiu’s hands. The Elder turned towards Lin Xiu’s right hand and saw a tiny white figure.

“Eh?” When he saw the creature in front of him, there was a surprised look in the elder’s eyes.

“What kind of beast will this little thing evolve into?”

The elder was now focused on the little Ice Crystal White Bird. He was interested in it.

At the same time, the little bird seemed to have noticed the elder looking at him. It flapped its wings, opened its mouth, and started screaming at the elder, showing its temper.

“Interesting.”

The elder let out a fascinated look in his eyes.

“This little thing, are you selling it?” The elder laughed before asking Lin Xiu.

“No.” As soon as the question was asked, Lin Xiu immediately rejected him.

“I’ll offer you 100 thousand points for this little bird.” The elder gently brushed his beard and asked in a serious manner.

“I already said that it’s not for sale.” Lin Xiu nodded his head and continued, “do you have what I want? If you don’t, then forget about it.”

“Little brat.” After being harshly rejected, the elder had no other choice. He turned downwards and started looking for the things that Lin Xiu wanted under his counter.

Soon, he brought up something on the counter that was just like a box.

“Refrigeration box. 5 thousand points.” The elder placed the box on the table and said to Lin Xiu.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded his head and once again, passed the card to the elder.

After swiping the card, Lin Xiu picked up the refrigeration box and left.

“Interesting, indeed.” As he looked at Lin Xiu who was leaving, the elder let out a fascinated smile.

If he guessed correctly, that was an Ice Crystal White Bird.

Lin Xiu picked up the box and quickly walked towards his mansion.

“What bird is that? The one in your hand.” When Lin Xiu was on his way back, a few men suddenly stood in front of Lin Xiu and asked.

Lin Xiu raised his brows and saw the boys who were wearing the uniforms of the Sacred Region Academy. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As he took a closer look, he noticed the pattern on their uniform and it was obvious that they were second-year students.

“Just a normal one.” Lin Xiu replied in an indifferent tone.

As for the little Ice Crystal White Bird, it started screaming furiously trying to scare its enemies away when it saw these boys blocking their way.

Lin Xiu was a little dumbfounded. This Ice Crystal White Bird was just born but it already knew how to act prestigious.

Lin Xiu didn’t want to be bothered with these people which is why he directly walked past them from the side.

“Wait up.” However, one of them put out his hand and stopped Lin Xiu.

“This little creature, how about giving it to me?”

His eyes were locked onto the little Ice Crystal White burn that was on Lin Xiu’s hand, they were burning with passion.

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“5 thousand points.” The boy frowned and raised his palm while offering the price.

“I won’t be exchanging it for any price.” Lin Xiu didn’t want to continue talking to him and said in an emotionless tone.

“Can you please excuse me?”

“Newcomer huh? You are acting quite arrogant, aren’t you?” The other man looked at Lin Xiu, who was being extremely conceited, and a gloomy look appeared on his face.

Lin Xiu’s attitude was obviously disrespectful towards them.

“Do you think that you’re that newcomer, Lin Xiu? I heard that he’s quite powerful.” One of them sneered while talking to Lin Xiu.

The other students around them walked away when they saw this scene in front of them.

In the Sacred Region Academy, bullying was common. Some of them were already used to it.

Plus, it was pointless reporting these matters to the counselor.

When Lin Xiu heard what he said, he laughed.

“I am Lin Xiu.”

The rest of them were stunned for a moment before laughing out loud and said, “Are you sure you don’t just coincidentally have the same name as that top newcomer?”

They gave Lin Xiu a good look and realized that he was a warrior, a rank five at most. The newcomer was at least a rank six warrior.

Now, they would never believe that Lin Xiu was the newcomer ‘Lin Xiu’.

“A polite dog doesn’t block the others.” Lin Xiu was done conversing with them and wanted to walk away.

“Bastard, what did you say?!” Lin Xiu’s words obviously triggered them and one of them wanted to grab onto Lin Xiu’s shoulders.

Lin Xiu’s reflexes were quick. Just as the other person’s hand was about to touch him, Lin Xiu had already grabbed onto the other person’s wrist with his left hand.

“You…”

The look in the boy’s eyes changed. He didn’t expect Lin Xiu to react so quickly.

Then, as Lin Xiu tightened his grip around him, a cracking sound came from the boy’s wrist.

“Let go of me! Let go!!!”

The boy felt as if the bones around his wrist were about to be broken into pieces. The intense pain that he was feeling caused him to let out a loud cry.

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and then let go of his wrist.

“Let me ask you again, do you want to continue blocking my way?” Lin Xiu raised his brows. He swept his gaze across all of them and asked.
