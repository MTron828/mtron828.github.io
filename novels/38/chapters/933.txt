Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“I want to hunt and kill the evolved beasts and exchange the odd crystals for some money.”

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment, then without thinking much, he said directly.

“Hahaha, Brother Lin, there are not many evolved beasts in this place, and they are very powerful. You came to the wrong place.”

Wu Jie laughed out loud at this time.

The other warriors also laughed at this time.

They seemed to think that Lin Xiu was just a young man.

“What about you, do you also hunt evolved beasts?” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Lin Xiu said with a smile at this time.

Lin Xiu seemed like a young boy who is just starting out.

“No, we are going back to Sand Sea City.”

Wu Jie shook his head and said.

“Sand Sea City?”

“Why, don’t you know?”

Wu Jie said curiously.

“I came here from the other side, and I don’t know the situation here.”

Lin Xiu said.

“Across this Black Wind Desert, it is Sand Sea City, where our home is.”

Wu Jie pointed to the far side and said aloud.

boom boom boom —

As soon as he finished speaking, a loud noise started to sound.

There sounded to be a lot of heavy footsteps.

“Beast tide!?”

At this time, the surrounding warriors were startled, and at the same time stood up with their weapons.

Taking a closer look, there is a large black figure in the front.

Evolved beasts, super many evolved beasts!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed, and he directly used the Analytic Eye:

Name: Black Wind Camel

Rank: Beast King

Features: A mutant camel living in the Black Wind Desert, with strong limbs, extremely fast speed and thick skin.

Are they all camels?

Lin Xiu looked at those huge camels and couldn’t help but feel a chill.

“Everyone, come on!”

Seeing so many black wind camels rushing over, Wu Jie and the others did not dare to hesitate at all, holding the weapons in their hands and attacking them with skills!

Although these black wind camels don’t look like they want to attack them, there were so many, and if all of them rushed over, they would trample people to the ground!

boom boom boom —

As they used various skills to attack those black wind camels, there was a loud noise around them.

The black wind camels around seemed to see something terrifying and ran away.

They didn’t even care about their companions being attacked.

“Little Brother Lin, you have to be careful!”

At the same time, a middle-aged warrior said loudly as he rushed straight ahead.
