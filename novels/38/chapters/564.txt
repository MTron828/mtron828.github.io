Chapter 565: The New Dark Edge Spear!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Even the staff from the pavilion seemed to be much less than yesterday.

He didn’t even see the foragers that he saw yesterday.

“I’m sorry. The foragers are completing a task and they wouldn’t be accepting any today.”

Lin Xiu overheard one of the staff informing another student who was at the pavilion.

The student was sad but he had no other choice but to come back another day.

Lin Xiu paused for a moment before walking over to him.

“I’m sorry...” When the staff saw Lin Xiu walking towards him, he repeated the same phrase he told the student a while ago.

But before he could finish, Lin Xiu stopped him and said, “I’m here to get the weapons. I got Qian Hu to help me with it.”

“Master Qian Hu...”

The man paused and then immediately said, “Was it a spear from the Dark Edge series?”

“That’s right.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Our foragers are still working on it but Master Qian Hu mentioned that if you are here, you can come in and take a look.”

The young man informed Lin Xiu.

“I’ll head in then.” Lin Xiu did not hesitate and stepped inside.

Lin Xiu then realized that the only reason why most of the foragers were occupied was mainly that they were helping out with his spear.

“Right here.” The young man led the way for Lin Xiu to where the spear was being transformed.

As he walked through the tunnel, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the extreme heat that was coming from the other end.

Clang clang clang – –

The sound of metal colliding rang loudly throughout the area.

“It worked! It finally worked!!”

With the young man leading Lin Xiu, they soon reached a spacious room that was deep inside the pavilion.

As soon as they got there, they could hear the cheers from inside.

Lin Xiu took a closer look and saw that there were a few foragers who were panting and there were some who had already passed out on the ground.

Qian Hu was inside the room as well. He was holding onto a huge metal hammer and was looking delighted.

“Master Qian Hu, he’s here.” The young man notified them.

When Qian Hu heard the young man, he turned around and saw Lin Xiu who was standing next to him.

“Young man, come here!”

Qian Hu could no longer hide the joy that was all over his face.

Lin Xiu nodded his head and walked towards Qian Hu but he didn’t see his spear anywhere in the room.

“Your spear is still inside.” Qian Hu said when he saw the confusion on Lin Xiu’s face. He placed the hammer onto the ground and pointed towards the huge machine that was in front of them.

“For now, we wait.”

“Alright.”

Lin Xiu stood next to Qian Hu and his eyes were fixed on the huge machine before him. The machine looked a little aged and it was covered with black soot all over.

Wung wung wung – –

About 15 minutes later, there was thick smoke that started coming out of the machine along with a weird noise.

“It’s done.” Qian Hu let out a breath of relief and directly sat on the ground.

Kong Loong Kong Loong – –

When the machine was pushed open, there was a large amount of steam and smoke that rushed out of it. It immediately caused the temperature around them to rise even more.

Lin Xiu stared at the scene before him with his eyes wide open.

Soon, with the steam disappearing, Lin Xiu finally saw his Dark Edge that was inside the machine.

The outer appearance of the Dark Edge was still the same. There were still white markings all over the body of the spear. These were the ones that Luo Yue had left on the spear when she helped with forging the spear for the very first time.

Well, in conclusion, there wasn’t much difference seen on the spear.

Qian Hu, once again noticed the confusion on his face, quickly stood up and with his dark circles under his eyes from staying up all night to finish the spear, explained himself, “We melted the front foot of the color-changing mantis. With a unique method, we managed to instill all of them inside your spear. It may look the same from the outside but the inside of it is now completely different.”

“En.” Lin Xiu couldn’t really see the difference by just looking at it which is why he wanted to pick up the spear.

“We can chill it immediately. Wait for it to cool down a little before picking it up. Don’t burn yourself.”

Qian Hu reminded Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu had no other choice but to wait. When the temperature of the Dark Edge slowly decreased, Lin Xiu reached towards the machine and picked up his spear.

As soon as he had his hands on it, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the heat that was coming from the inside of the spear.

The spear was heavier now.

The additional weight did not make it uncomfortable for Lin Xiu. Instead, it made it even more comfortable for Lin Xiu.

As his strength increased, the weight of the weapon was something minor for Lin Xiu.

“Try it.” Qian Hu suggested.

Lin Xiu nodded his head and with the Dark Edge in his arms, he started swinging it around.

The spear was just like a part of Lin Xiu’s body as he was able to move around it smoothly and as he moved, there was an ear-piercing noise that came from it.

The crowd that focused on Lin Xiu were all looking at him with looks of admiration.

“Hmm?”

At that moment where Lin Xiu’s energy had been released, there was something happening on the body of the spear as well.

The shape of the spear remained the same but it was the color that changed. It suddenly glowed and it started turning white.

“It’s changing color?!”

Lin Xiu was shocked.

“That’s the effect.” Qian Hu got excited as well as he looked at Lin Xiu in shock as well.

“Hmmm but I’m not sure what its exact effects are.” Lin Xiu thought of the abilities of breaking ‘Yuan’ that he saw with the color-changing mantis.

Would it be possible that his spear had inherited this effect?

After trying out his spear, Lin Xiu turned towards Qian Hu and the rest of the forager and said, “Thank you so much.”

“You don’t have to say that. It’s our honor that we got to create such a beautiful weapon.”

The men here were emotional men as well and when they heard Lin Xiu, they couldn’t help but laugh.

Lin Xiu didn’t stay for long and left the Weapons Pavilion.

As he stepped out of the pavilion, he stretched his back and felt great. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Then, from his pocket, Xiao Bai and Rollie stuck their heads out.

Ever since Lin Xiu came back, both of them have been following Lin Xiu everywhere.

However, it was too eye-catching for them to stay on his shoulder which was why Lin Xiu placed them in his pocket. Since they were able to change sizes, they could easily fit inside Lin Xiu’s pocket.

“Now….it’s time to go there..” Lin Xiu took out the card that had the peculiar markings and looked at the black tower that was covered by thick clouds.
