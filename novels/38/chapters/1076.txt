Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

After a little hesitation, Lin Xiu’s figure flashed and he appeared in the air.

Still holding the Dark Edge spear in both hands, he attacked the surrounding ice crystal white snakes.

Because of the dark blue flames on the Dark Edge spear, Lin Xiu easily pierced the body of those ice crystal white snakes.

At this time, Lin Xiu kept attacking an ice crystal sea snake.

Soon, another ice crystal sea snake was also shot down to the ground.

!!

As Lin Xiu frantically waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand and under the attack of those Sage warriors, the bodies of those ice crystal sea snakes slowly fell to the ground.

Because every ice crystal sea snake was killed by Lin Xiu in the end, all Lin Xiu gained 10% of their experience.

Lin Xiu also obtained three odd crystals from these ice crystal sea snakes.

The other two were taken away by another Sage warrior.

As these ice crystal sea snakes were all killed.

Although the bodies of these warriors were still suspended in the air, they were all panting.

The battle with these ice crystal sea snakes just now made them consume a lot of power.

Lin Xiu also took a deep breath at this time.

He didn’t expect to encounter evolved beasts of this level here.

20 over sage warriors only managed to deal with the evolved beasts after sacrificing one sage warrior. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Boy, take them out.”

At this moment, two of the Sage warriors flew toward Lin Xiu and surrounded Lin Xiu.

“What do you mean?”

Hearing their words, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“What do we mean?”

One of the men sneered.

“I’m asking you to take everything out.”

A warrior with a warhammer who looked relatively strong said coldly at this time.

“What thing, please be specific.”

“Are you talking about this?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows and at this time, he took out the odd crystal from his expansion.

Looking at the odd crystal that Lin Xiu took out, the eyes of the two of them changed slightly.

This kind of odd crystal contains very strong energy.

For their Sage warrior-level warriors, it will be of great benefit to absorb them.

“We killed those ice crystal sea snakes just now and you took the opportunity to take our things. Now hand them over and I’ll pretend it never happened.”

One of the men said coldly at this time.

“Is that so.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly and said lightly.

“take them out.”

Another warrior holding a sword flew in front of Lin Xiu in the next moment and reached out to take away the odd crystal in Lin Xiu’s hand!

swoosh—

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s figure flashed and disappeared.

This man grabbed the air.

Where is he?!

At this moment, the look in his eyes changed.

Looking up, Lin Xiu’s figure had already appeared in front of him.

“That’s not nice eh?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly, looked at him and said lightly.

“Humph!”

When the man saw Lin Xiu appearing on the opposite side, he couldn’t help snorting coldly.

At this time, there was already murderous intent in his eyes.

“It seems that you are not willing to cooperate.”

The two Sage warriors stared at Lin Xiu at this time, with undisguised killing intent on their bodies.

“Things should be obtained through one’s abilities.”

On the other side, Elder Gong looked at this scene and said lightly.

The rest of the Sage warriors also slowly flew from the air to the ground in front of them and began to use ‘Cultivation Technique’ to absorb the energy.

Supplementing the energy that they just consumed, they didn’t pay any attention to the situation here.

“Elder Gong, things should be obtained through our abilities so we’re using our abiliting to take things.”

One of the Sage warriors said indifferently without giving Elder Gong any face.

“Elder Gong, I think what he said is right, so let’s not get involved.”

Bai Zhan watched this scene from the other side and immediately sneered.

He wished that someone would target Lin Xiu.

Better to kill Lin Xiu.

At this time, Elder Gong’s brows suddenly wrinkled.

He didn’t want to see this happen.

After all, the purpose this time was to kill the frost dragon.

It would be very bad if a civil war started on the way.

And when they killed the ice crystal sea snake, a Sage warrior had already died.

In addition to the Sage warrior who was killed by Lin Xiu, two Sage warriors had already died at this time.

Only twenty-four Sage warriors remained.

“Elder Gong, I think you’re tired. Let’s replenish your strength first. We’ll handle the matter here ourselves.”

One of the men with a warhammer said indifferently.

They were now determined to snatch the three beast saint-level odd crystals from Lin Xiu’s hands.

Because just now they clearly saw that Lin Xiu took the three Beast Saint-level odd crystals into his pocket.

“Elder Gong, since someone wants to die, I’m not going to stand on ceremony.”

Just when Elder Gong was about to say something, Lin Xiu looked at him and said indifferently.

“This…”

When Elder Gong heard Lin Xiu’s words, he couldn’t help but be startled, but at this time he also nodded.

Although he couldn’t feel Lin Xiu’s specific strength, from the previous performance of Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu was very strong.

“Boy, since you don’t want to hand them over, don’t blame us.”

The faces of the two men holding the sword and war hammer respectively became hideous at this moment.

“You are talking a bit too much nonsense.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Courting death!”

Lin Xiu’s words made them instantly furious.

The two warriors unfolded their ‘Sphere’ and charged directly toward Lin Xiu!

Their speed was very fast and in the blink of an eye, they appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

With a sword and a war hammer, they attacked Lin Xiu!

Dang dang-

Lin Xiu waved frantically with the Dark Edge spear in his hand, not afraid at all.

Ever since he learned the Destiny Spear ARt, even if Lin Xiu didn’t use skill, he didn’t lose the slightest when facing other warriors!

These two Sage warriors originally thought that Lin Xiu would be easily taken down under the attack of the two.

But what they didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu’s strength seemed to exceed their expectations!

how can that be!

This kid must have consumed a lot of physical strength when he killed Zhou Ba just now, right?

Coupled with the battle of the Ice Crystal Sea Snakes, he should have been exhausted by now.

Why, why is this kid still able to have such a strong power!?

The faces of the two warriors turned ugly at this time.

“Get lost!”

And at this moment, with the power of Lin Xiu’s body erupting, the two Sage warriors who wanted to continue their attack felt an extremely strong impact and they were directly hit and flew out!
