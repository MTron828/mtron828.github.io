Chapter 406: Thirteen Times!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

While Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were still training in the gravity room, there was already a post on the school forum that was very popular.

“Lin Xiu, the top freshman, challenges the entire grade!”

After a post like this was posted in the Sacred Region Academy, the whole grade was angered.

“Too proud!”

“Who does he think he is!?”

At this time, the students in the whole grade were furious. The post described Lin Xiu as a very arrogant person.

How could all these privileged people tolerate this?

“Damn, who is talking nonsense?” At this moment, Zhang Yin and the others just returned from treatment from the treatment room. Zhang Yin took out his mobile phone and logged into the forum of the Sacred Region Academy. He wanted to see if there was any useful information but didn’t expect to find such a post and it looked very popular.

“This kid probably offended people again.”

At the same time, on the other side, Ouyang Hang looked at the forum post on the computer screen and said with a sullen smile on his face.

“Young Master Hang, what are we going to do?” At this time, a guy who was also wearing the Sacred Region Academy uniform stood next to Ouyang Hang and asked.

“What are we going to do?” Ouyang Hang raised his brows, then faintly said, “Of course we’re going to stir up this matter, just say that he said all the warriors in our freshman class are rubbish.”

“Seems like Young Master Hang is going to go all out ah.” After the man heard Ouyang Hang’s words, the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but curl up.

If this news went out, Lin Xiu would definitely be hated by those warriors.

After all, the warriors here were all so gifted and privileged – who could tolerate the insult?

“Ten times the gravity...it’s a bit difficult…” Lin Xiu was in the gravity room at this time and began to train continuously.

Under ten times the gravity, Lin Xiu felt as if his body was firmly pressed down by a mountain and it was difficult for him to move.

Tired, very tired.

But what surprised Lin Xiu was that Luo Yue seemed to be in a much better state than him and she was able to do well in this gravity room.

“It’s about to start.” Luo Yue operated on the console at this time, then said faintly.

As Luo Yue spoke, a large number of rays shot down from the ceiling!

“Damn!” Seeing the sudden sky full of laser rays, Lin Xiu burst out swearing and quickly dodged.

Swish swish swish——

Those sounds of laser beams kept ringing. Under ten times the gravity, it was actually very difficult for Lin Xiu to dodge.

He was careless for a moment and a laser beam slashed across his arm. There was a burnt mark on his clothes and Lin Xiu also felt a sharp pain on his skin.

These laser rays seemed to have also been upgraded to a new level.

On the other hand, Luo Yue still dodged very quickly.

“Have you practiced before?” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue as he dodged.

“En.” Luo Yue nodded.

“What’s the highest amount of gravity you’ve trained before?” Lin Xiu asked, a little surprised.

It was true that Luo Yue’s current performance was beyond Lin Xiu’s expectations.

Because in this state, Lin Xiu found it very strenuous, but Luo Yue seemed to be handling it well.

He had already unlocked the rank 2 gene lock and the various structures of his body had also evolved and changed!

“Thirteen.” Luo Yue said aloud while avoiding those very intense laser beams shooting at her body.

Thirteen times!

Thirteen times!

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu was shocked.

This was not simply doubling or tripling the strength of gravity, the resulting strength of gravity was very terrifying.

“My strength is restored, otherwise, I wouldn’t be able to handle it.” Luo Yue continued to say aloud.

At this time, Lin Xiu also came to his senses. It seemed that because of Luo Yue’s internal injuries, the strength she showed was not her true strength at all!

Lin Xiu instinctively activated the Analytic Eye at this time and discovered that Luo Yue could not be analyzed.

According to reason, the current Analytic Eye could already parse the information of a warrior who was one rank higher than himself, but Luo Yue’s current state still surprised Lin Xiu.

“Are you a rank 7 warrior now?” Lin Xiu said in surprise. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue also looked a little surprised, but she nodded and said, “Yeah, I’ve recovered.”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but swallow his spit at this time – Luo Yue’s strength has reached this level!

No, it should be said that she was a rank 7 warrior from the start.

With this thought, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but gasp. At her current age, she could reach the level of a rank 7 warrior. How did she train?

While Lin Xiu was surprised, Luo Yue was also a little surprised at this time, because when she first met Lin Xiu, she discovered that Lin Xiu was a very weak warrior. No, at that time, he wasn’t even considered a warrior.

But it has only been a short period of time and Lin Xiu’s strength has risen to this level.

Rank 5 warrior!

The warriors in some small cities couldn’t even reach this level in a lifetime.

“Then you should be a rank 8 warrior soon, right?” Now that Lin Xiu has slowly adapted to ten times the gravity, he was able to dodge easily.

While dodging at this time, he was speaking to Luo Yue.

“It’s now very difficult to reach rank 7.” Luo Yue dodged a laser and said aloud.

“That’s true.” Lin Xiu nodded, after all, the higher the level, the more difficult it was to level up. Otherwise, why would there be so few rank 9 warriors.

While Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were chatting, Zhang Yin and Li Ping, who had already received treatment outside, were about to tell Lin Xiu about the forum when they found that Lin Xiu was still in the gravity room.

“Lin Xiu and Luo Yue are still inside?” Zhang Yin looked at the gravity room in surprise at this time and said.

“Yes.” Jiang Li nodded.

“Damn, it’s been three hours, three hours under ten times the gravity?” Zhang Yin’s eyes widened, his face was full of shock.
