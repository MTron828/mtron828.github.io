Chapter 994: Summoning

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

As soon as Ji Mei’s words were spoken, a bright red light burst out from the passage where Lin Xiu was!

A huge and terrifying flame erupted directly from this passage.

The incomparably terrifying flame instantly drowned Lin Xiu, who was standing at the entrance of the passage.

When Gao Lin and others saw this scene, their eyes widened.

The entire space also instantly turned red.

The surrounding temperature also increased drastically.

Make them feel like their bodies are so hot that they are about to melt away.

“You’re courting death!”

Seeing this scene, Deng Men said in a low voice while fearing the terrifying flames.

Because just after he went to that passage and his arm was bitten by a mechanical worm, his heart was a bit twisted.

Seeing other people get hurt, he also felt a perverted sense of relief in his heart.

The temperature was really too high, they were a certain distance away from the passage yet they could feel the terrifying temperature.

Lin Xiu, who was standing at the entrance of the passage, wouldn’t be directly annihilated by this flame, would he?

Just when they all thought that Lin Xiu was going to die, the flames began to slowly disappear.

And standing in the flames, a figure slowly appeared.

Lin Xiu, was completely unscathed!

“This is impossible!”

Seeing this scene, Deng Men roared directly.

Even from such a distance, he could feel the scorching temperature.

It made him sweat all over.

It seemed as if his body was going to be burned.

Lin Xiu stood there, hit by the terrifying flames and was unharmed!

Totally fine, not even his clothes or hair was damaged at all!

Ji Mei covered her mouth and opened her eyes wide in disbelief.

“Don’t tell me the Source Stone of Fire is here…”

At this time, Lin Xiu walked out of the passage over there and said aloud like he was talking to himself.

Ignoring the shocked crowd, Lin Xiu walked in the direction of another passage.

According to the data analyzed by Analytic Eye, the last channel should be related to space.

Boom—

When Lin Xiu walked over, there was a loud noise from the passage just now.

This passage, like the passage in the middle, was also blocked.

As soon as he walked to the entrance of the last passage, Lin Xiu felt something was wrong.

The passage in front of him and the two passages on the left, gave Lin Xiu a different feeling.

Weird, really too weird.

He felt that if he walked in, he would die.

Yes, Lin Xiu actually had such a strange feeling.

“This should be the real passage eh?”

Ji Mei also walked over at this time, walked to Lin Xiu’s side and said aloud. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Probably not.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“not?”

Ji Mei was startled.

Two of the passages were closed and if this one is not, then where are they going?

“Is this a real passage?”

Gao Lin and the others saw that Lin Xiu and Ji Mei were fine standing over there, so they went over.

Although Deng Men looked at the passage with a little shadow in his heart, he also walked over at this time.

He didn’t want Lin Xiu and the others to rush in directly and leave him here alone, it would be a big loss for him.

After all, he lost an arm.

“No.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

“Then now…”

Gao Lin was stunned, then said subconsciously.

As long as someone enter these passages, the mechanism will be triggered, then the passage would be closed.

This passage was very strange and Lin Xiu didn’t want to take risks.

At this time, with a thought, he directly used the system skill.

‘Exotic Summoning’.

With the use of this system skill, a huge opening was suddenly opened in the space behind.

A black giant claw directly opened the space crack, making the space crack even bigger.

“There are monsters!!!”

Gao Qiang turned around abruptly and when he saw the scene in front of him, he exclaimed.

The rest also clenched the weapons in their hands and were about to attack the monster who wanted to escape from the space crack.

“Don’t attack.”

“This is what I summoned.”

Just when they were about to make a move, Lin Xiu said lightly.

As Lin Xiu’s voice just fell, Gao Lin and others froze in place.

Looking at Lin Xiu, their eyes were full of disbelief.

“You summoned…!?”

Ji Mei’s eyes widened at this moment and she said subconsciously.

Although warriors have many unique skills, what kind of skill would be capable of summoning evolved beasts!

Roar–

But this pitch-black evolved beast has already crawled out of the space crack!

This evolved beast looks like a leopard with a pair of wings.

The whole body was pitch black.

Looking at this evolved beast, Gao Lin and the others couldn’t help but tremble slightly.

The sense of oppression this huge evolved beast gave them was too great.

“go.”

Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered and the giant evolved beast that climbed out of the crack in the space walked directly into the passage.

Not long after it walked in, the evolved beast suddenly roared.

A bright light came from the passage.

What happened next made Lin Xiu even more shocked.

The body of this evolved beast that was way stronger than him was directly split into countless pieces.

In this passage, there were actually many space cracks.

Those terrifying space cracks directly split all of its body apart.

What’s even more bizarre is that this evolved beast that split into so many pieces did not die.

It shattered into countless pieces and was still suspended in the air.

Gu lu—

The three Gao Lin brothers swallowed at the same time.

This channel, compared to the other two channels, was even more terrifying.

If they walked in, their bodies would probably be split into countless pieces and they would not die. This was the most terrifying thing.

Seeing your own body split into countless pieces, what kind of feeling is that?

Just thinking about it makes one’s scalp tingle.

Boom—

At the next moment, this channel was also closed.

“It’s over.”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief.

Over?

When Gao Lin and the others heard Lin Xiu’s words, they had a puzzled look.

At the same time, the entire ground began to vibrate.

It seems that because these three channels were closed, some kind of mechanism or switch was activated at this moment.

“The ground… the ground is cracking!”

At this time, Deng Men yelled excitedly.

This kind of excitement was a kind of excitement that was full of nervousness and fear.
