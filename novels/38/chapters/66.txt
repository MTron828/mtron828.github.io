Chapter 67: The Tiger Breaks The Cage

The students who saw the scene couldn’t stop from bursting into an uproar.

One must know that Ye Gulin was a super strong warrior and was known as “The Tiger of Xing Yao” ah!

He was actually wounded by Lin Xiu? This surprised many people.

“See, who said that Lin Xiu will lose?” Yang Tian said proudly to the students next to him.

“Ye Gulin just isn’t serious yet,” the students said dismissively.

Looking at the stage carefully, Ye Gulin was attacked, but there was a smile on his face.

“Not bad, not bad.”

Lin Xiu knitted his brows. That move just now was such a pity, he thought that he could knock Ye Gulin down directly, but he didn’t expect Ye Gulin to actually block all the remaining four attacks!

And Lin Xiu even attacked only after calculating the circumstances that Ye Gulin wouldn’t be able to react.

The man’s reflexes were too good.

On the other side, the dean Zhang Lin frowned when he saw this scene.

When nobody was looking, he made a gesture of cutting his throat toward Ye Gulin.

Ye Gulin nodded subtly, and in the next second, without waiting for Lin Xiu to make a move, he took the lead and charged out! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He was like a dark shadow!

Lin Xiu’s eyes dilated, and just as he was about to dodge, he realized that Ye Gulin had disappeared!

Up there!?

“Silver skill – ‘Force of Mount Tai’!!!” A student exclaimed in excitement.

This skill was very demanding of one’s physical strength, but the destructive power it produced was also very amazing.

Sure enough, Lin Xiu looked up and Ye Gulin was in the sky, holding a huge hammer with both hands as he hammered down!

The huge hammer was like a mountain, the powerful source strength came in a wave, pressing Lin Xiu down and making him a little breathless.

He couldn’t dodge anymore!

Since he couldn’t dodge, he had to fight!

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and held his spear tightly. His spear seemed to have sensed its master’s aggression and gave off a clanging sound.

A burst of flames spread from the bottom to the tip of the spear.

“What kind of skill is this!?” Some people were obviously surprised to see this.

But Yang Tian remembered that this was the ‘Awe of the Phoenix’ that Lin Xiu used before.

“Go!” Lin Xiu roared. The spear swooped in the air, with the tip of the spear as the starting point and dozens of flaming birds flew out!!!

“What skill is this exactly?” A teacher who studied spears widened his eyes. From the time he became a warrior, he had never seen nor heard of a spear-type skill like this.

Ten flaming birds flew straight toward Ye Gulin who was holding the giant hammer, and the surrounding air seemed to heat up in an instant.

Bang!!!

With a loud bang, Ye Gulin’s hammer hit the flame birds directly.

In an instant, a strong impact sent a shockwave through the surrounding air.

Ka ka ka——

The ground seemed to shake and there were even small cracks appearing.

In the next second, Lin Xiu, holding a silver spear, couldn’t help but take a couple of steps back.

Dozens of flaming birds were blown away by the sledgehammer and Ye Gulin’s figure appeared.

His move completely offset the Awe of the Phoenix.

“Looks like I’m going to have to be serious.” Ye Gulin touched his slightly charred hair, then said with a cold look.

“Is that so?”

Lin Xiu felt a slight sweetness in his throat and it seemed like they were at the same level just now. However, he was still slightly injured by that strong source strength that Ye Gulin’s skill exuded.

Ye Gulin licked his lips at this moment and rushed over again with a ‘swish’.

Lin Xiu didn’t dodge at all and charged over too.

The two men were like two dark shadows, fighting wildly on the stage at great speed.

Dang dang dang——

A burst of metal collisions kept ringing.

Every time Lin Xiu resisted Ye Gulin’s attack, his hand became numb and he felt like his spear was about to be sent flying out by Ye Gulin’s hammer.

Ye Gulin was too strong, way too strong.

He did not give Lin Xiu any chance to react, waving the hammer constantly, and smashing it toward Lin Xiu.

“It looks like Lin Xiu is going to lose.” A school leader who was next to Mr. Ye said with a smile.

Mr. Ye did not speak, he was still looking at Lin Xiu.

‘Have you shown all your cards?’

Lin Xiu used the ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ again, but this time, not only did he miss, but Ye Gulin completely blocked him too.

“Slow! Too slow!” Ye Gulin roared, then swerved the hammer with a strong force, causing Lin Xiu to take several steps back.

Then, like a ferocious tiger, he continued to charge at Lin Xiu.

“Silver skill—— ‘Tiger breaks the cage’!

As his body’s source strength continuously surged into the hammer and with the hammer as the center, a huge hammerhead illusion appeared!!!

“Haha, Ye Gulin’s signature skill, Lin Xiu is definitely going to lose!” A student couldn’t help shouting when he saw the scene.

The rest of the students also looked at this scene incredulously. This powerful skill made many students hold their breath in awe.

‘Is this the signature skill that ranks fourth on the combat strength list!?’

Many students widened their eyes and did not want to miss this rare sight.

“Dodge!” Luo Li saw this scene and his pupils constricted as he looked angrily at Ye Gulin.

Even he couldn’t directly take on this skill head-on and this was clearly a skill to kill.

If Lin Xiu got hit, he would probably turn into minced meat instantly from the strong source strength!

“Go to hell!” Ye Gulin’s face also became sinister.

The scope of this attack covered the entire stage and Lin Xiu couldn’t flee at all!

Lin Xiu’s expression changed drastically as well. He looked at the huge hammerhead illusion that came out of the hammer and it was like a tiger was breaking out of the cage and pouncing toward him!

Lin Xiu held the spear with both hands and gritted his teeth, trying to resist!

‘I can’t lose, I can’t lose!!!’

At this moment, the spear also seemed to be slightly trembling and made a clanging sound.

“Come down! Quick, jump down!” Luo Li yelled. Never mind if they lost, if he didn’t come down, he would die!

The students around them had started to disperse and no one dared to go near that stage.

Rumble——

As Ye Gulin hammered down, it sounded like an explosion!

There were a lot of cracks around the stage and a cloud of dust rose in the middle.
