Chapter 1057: Killing a Sage Warrior Again

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“It’s your own fault.”

Ji Mei looked at Tang Qi who was approaching and sneered.

“You will die for me!!!”

When Tang Qi heard Ji Mei’s words, his face became ferocious, holding a sword in his hand, he was about to attack the matrix that surrounded Ji Mei and the others!

boom–

But as soon as his sword was slashed, an extremely strong recoil force directly sent him retreating.

Tang Qi’s body took several steps back and fell directly to the ground.

Like a dog eating shit.

“Young Pavilion Master!”

When the other two warriors saw this scene, they quickly helped Tang Qi up.

“Damn…”

At this time, Tang Qi looked at Ji Mei and the others in front of him with a grim expression.

“If I come out, you will be the one who will die.”

Ji Mei looked at Tang Qi not far away and said coldly.

In their Tang Pavilion, only those few Sage warrior-level warriors were stronger.

As for Tang Qi and the two warriors beside him, she could easily get rid of them.

But at this time, her eyes turned to the other side.

In the distance over there, a huge mushroom cloud appeared, which was caused by the power of the two Sage warriors’ ‘Source of Ice and Fire’.

It seemed dangerous, but Ji Mei believed that Lin Xiu would be fine.

“This kid, go to hell.”

The left and right guardians and Elder Lin flew to the ground where Lin Xiu was shot down.

At this time, as the thick dust around him slowly dissipated, they could clearly see that a huge pit had been blasted out on the ground below.

The pit was pitch-black and it looked bottomless.

“Dead for sure.”

Elder Lin heaved a sigh of relief when he saw this scene.

But just as he finished speaking, he seemed to see something from the corner of his eye seemed and his expression changed.

“Be careful!”

As soon as he finished speaking, in the next moment, they could clearly see that under the dark pit, there was a light that was slowly rising.

Lin Xiu! Lin Xiu didn’t die!

At this time, Lin Xiu’s body was protected by a ‘Sphere’ and the entire body had a dark blue light, which was very conspicuous under the huge dark pit.

“Damn boy…”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s body slowly levitating, the expressions on the left and right guardians became extremely ugly.

The blow just now was the most powerful blow they had combined!

Even so, Lin Xiu was not killed.

Hu—

At this moment, Lin Xiu, whose body was slowly coming up, took a deep breath.

After wiping the blood from his lips, Lin Xiu’s body slowly levitated.

The power of the blow just now was indeed very powerful. The terrifying impact made even Lin Xiu, who was protected by the ‘Sphere’, suffer some injuries.

“Next, it’s my turn.”

While Lin Xiu said lightly, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he swung it straight into the sky!

Boom—

One after another, dark blue flames burst out in the next moment.

And when the flames burst out, Lin Xiu snorted coldly, the Heart of Frost started to work and continued to release the energy of the ice attribute!

The power of the ice attribute and the flaming bird gathered together and charged directly toward the three Sage warriors in the air!

Lin Xiu was inspired by the joint source mark ‘Source of Ice and Fire’ they just used.

“This kid…”

The left and right guardians and Elder Lin had a change of expression.

But the flames that combined the power of the ice attribute have already charged towards them!

The three warriors wanted to escape, but found that the flaming bird seemed to have a tracking function and continued to charge towards them!

“what!!!”

At this time, Left Guardian looked at the flaming bird that was rushing towards him and when he realized that he could not escape, he roared angrily.

With his roar, in the next moment, he unfolded the ‘Sphere’.

Boom—

When the flaming bird mixed with the power of the ice attribute slammed into his ‘Sphere’, a huge sound broke out.

This sound shocked Tang Qi and other warriors on the other side that they had to cover their ears.

As if the eardrums were about to be shattered.

Although the Left Guardian used the ‘Sphere’ to resist, but this was too powerful.

Taking a closer look, he found that a lot of cracks had appeared on his ‘Sphere’!

Blood also flowed from his mouth.

The impact of this blow was too strong.

swoosh—

And in the next moment, Lin Xiu’s figure suddenly flashed and appeared in front of this Left Guardian.

Break!

Without the slightest hesitation, the Dark Edge spear in both hands attacked his ‘Sphere’!

boom–

With a loud sound, he remembered that his ‘Sphere’ was directly smashed by Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear!

As soon as the ‘Sphere’ was broken, he received a powerful backlash from the source strength and the huge pain caused him to spit blood directly from his mouth.

“goodbye!”

Lin Xiu looked at him and roared angrily. In the next moment, the Dark Edge spear held in both hands burst into dazzling light.

Lin Xiu’s whole body was charging toward him like a fierce tiger!

‘Tiger descends the mountain’!

“Courting death!!!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu’s terrifying skill was about to hit the Left Guardian, Elder Lin and the Right Guardian slammed their left palms into the air and terrifying energy groups charged towards Lin Xiu!

But Lin Xiu didn’t care at all, those energy groups impacted Lin Xiu’s body, causing little damage to Lin Xiu.

After all, the existence of the S-rank battle suit ‘Holy Light Battle Suit’ can help Lin Xiu resist a lot of damage.

“Die!!!”

And at this moment, the body of the left guardian was directly smashed into countless pieces by Lin Xiu!

Left Guarding, dead!

“Next, it’s you guys’ turn.”

After Lin Xiu killed the left guardian, he looked up at the right guardian and Elder Lin.

His eyes were full of infinite killing intent.

Once he killed these two Sage warriors, he should be able to level up immediately!

“Go!”

At this time, Elder Lin’s face became ugly. Lin Xiu not only killed almost all of the Tang Pavilion’s warriors, but also the Tang Pavilion’s pavilion owner, an elder and a guardian were beheaded by Lin Xiu.

Those are all sage-level warriors!

How powerful is this kid?

Don’t care, now he could only… escape!

When the Right Guardian heard Elder Lin’s words, he also moved at this time and was about to flee to the other side.

He didn’t want to be killed by Lin Xiu just like that! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Where are you guys going.”

These two are very smart and they both ran in opposite directions.

But Lin Xiu, he wouldn’t let the experience he was going to acquire just go to waste.

As Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered, at this moment, a black source mark appeared on his forehead.
