Chapter 77: Death of Tang Tian!

Tang Tian initially thought that no matter how powerful the Rupturing Fist was, Lin Xiu still could not defeat him, a rank 3 warrior.

But Tang Tian immediately regretted the instant their fists collided.

A powerful force surged out from Lin Xiu’s fist.

Bang bang bang-

In that instant, a series of bangs rang out as Tang Tian felt a burst of pain as his entire arm exploded.

“ARGHH!!! I will kill you!!!” Tang Tian roared out loud and retreated a few steps to draw his Blood Fiend Sword before slashing at Lin Xiu!

“Pa”

Lin Xiu gave him a death stare. He grabbed Tang Tian’s wrist with his right hand accurately, and with a snap, a ‘crack’ was heard as Tang Tian’s wrist was twisted 180 degrees and the sword fell to the ground.

“Ah!!!!” A loud wail escaped Tang Tian’s mouth.

Lin Xiu did not stop and kicked Tang Tian in the stomach and sent him flying in the air.

“Lin Xiu!!! Hold your hand!!!” Tang Ping roared at the sight of Tang Tian being beaten. He wanted to charge down from the stands but was helpless against the crowd of people. No matter how he struggled, he was unable to approach.

At this moment, Mr. Ye had a surprised look on his face. ‘What just happened? How did Lin Xiu’s strength suddenly increase by so much?’

And he clearly did not see Lin Xiu consuming any Forbidden Medicine!

This piqued his interest even more.

“Lin Xiu! Beat this brat!!!” Yang Tian was shocked by the sudden turn of events, but he quickly regained himself and cheered Lin Xiu on.

“Lin Xiu! Lin Xiu!”

The entire crowd was extremely invigorated. It was too inconceivable, who would have thought that such a huge reversal had occurred!

Could Lin Xiu be hiding his strength all the while?

Lin Xiu snorted and watched Tang Tian as he fell to the ground and sent a fist to smash his back!

Crack-

Following a series of bone-cracking sounds, Tang Tian was struck into the air once again.

But this time, Lin Xiu did not send him flying upwards and allowed him to fall to the ground.

Bang-

Tang Tian smashed onto the ground heavily and blood splattered in all directions.

“Tang Tian, do you admit defeat?!” The referee quickly shouted when he saw that.

Tang Tian was from the Tang Family, if something happened to him and the Tang Family blamed him, there would be trouble!

“Scram!” Tang Tian’s pained face turned sinister and after roaring at the referee, he turned to Lin Xiu and shouted at him, “If you have the guts, kill me!”

“You don’t need to tell me that, I will toy you to death!” Lin Xiu’s eyes turned cold.

Who cared about the Tang Family or the school? Lin Xiu completely threw all of them to the back of his head.

He charged forward and punched Tang Tian’s body like how he had done so previously.

“Hahaha, keep it up!!!”

In the next second, Tang Tian roared out loud and something in his body started to sound out.

Lin Xiu lowered his head and noticed electric organs in certain places of his body.

And the right arm that he ripped apart did not have any bones but electric parts.

“Part android?”

Before he could even think further, a bright burst of light came out of Tang Tian’s chest.

Not good!

Rumble-

Tang Tian’s entire body erupted with an explosion that shook the entire competition grounds.

Fortunately for the protection on the stage, the spectators below were not hurt.

“Pu”

Lin Xiu was flung to the edge of the stage by the explosion and coughed out blood.

Both students and teachers were stunned.

Tang Tian actually self exploded in an attempt to kill Lin Xiu?

But how did he conceal the bomb inside his body? Everyone could not comprehend.

“Ding~~ Congratulations Master for killing a rank 3 warrior…”

At this time, a notification rang out, but Lin Xiu fainted at this moment.

“What?! Tian’er died?!” At the same time, Tang Ping had run home and informed everything to his father, Tang Mubai.

Tang Mubai thought that even if Lin Xiu could not die, he would be beaten and become crippled, so he returned home first as he had other things to handle.

When he heard Tang Ping’s words, his entire body trembled and the cup in his hand smashed to smithereens.

“No matter what, Lin Xiu, I will make you repay this blood debt!!!”

At this moment, Lin Xiu felt as though he was in darkness and his body started to feel warm.

“Di~~~ Recovery completed, the medical pod to open in five seconds…”

The electronic voice resounded beside him and woke him up.

He slowly opened his eyes and found himself lying inside a pod.

“Lin Xiu, you’re awake?” As the pod opened, a joyous voice sounded.

When his vision cleared, he saw that it was Luo Li.

“Teacher Luo.” Lin Xiu got up slowly.

“Your clothes are here.” Luo Li got a new set of clothes and handed it over to him. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu nodded his head and got dressed.

At this moment, he felt extremely comfortable, as though all the pores on his body were completely opened.

All the wounds on his body had been cured by the infirmary.

“You’ve been lying here for almost 10 hours,” Luo Li said.

’10 hours? So long?’

But upon recalling all the injuries he had sustained, he felt that it was normal.

“The competition…”

Luo Li was about to speak when he heard Lin Xiu mention the competition when arguments were heard outside.

“Where is Lin Xiu? Get him out here!!!”

Lin Xiu frowned and walked out with Luo Li to see Zhang Lin.

“Lin Xiu, you are suspected of maliciously murdering Tang Tian in the competition. Be prepared to follow the federal police!” Zhang Lin said loudly and came out with a big name without any warning.

At the same time, a federal police vehicle could be seen in the corner.

“So you were the one who suggested for me to go to the stronghold, huh?” Lin Xiu stared at Zhang Lin and said.

“What are you trying to do? Could it be that you want to beat up a teacher as well?”! Zhang Lin was stunned when he heard Lin Xiu’s question and retorted back.

“That’s right!”
