Chapter 498: 【Trio Flame Wave】

As Lin Zhen said that, several men on the front and the back quickly approached Lin Xiu.

These people were different from ordinary warriors. They were very fast, especially in this slightly gloomy alley – they looked like black shadows.

And what made Lin Xiu find even more unbelievable was that these guys seemed to be able to conceal their aura.

If it was not daytime, even if they were close to Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu might not have noticed them.

But Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate anymore. When they were about to reach him, Lin Xiu stretched his right hand directly behind his back and pulled out the Dark Edge spear wrapped in white cloth from his back!

Dang dang dang——

With the spear in his hand, Lin Xiu hit the men’s weapon across and made a clear sound.

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate to use his skills directly and the spear that he pierced out transformed into hundreds in an instant.

The men who were going to chop off Lin Xiu’s head were suddenly shocked. They obviously didn’t expect Lin Xiu to swing the spear so fast and it was as if a hundred people were stabbing them with a spear at the same time!

“Ah!!!”

A man was caught off guard and Lin Xiu’s spear stabbed him dozens of times!

He looked like a large-caliber bullet had turned him into a sieve!

What!?

Lin Zhen’s complacent expression became extremely nasty when he saw this scene. He had no idea that Lin Xiu would be so strong!

The look in his eyes changed. In the next moment, with a violent wave of his right hand, a short, dark, sharp object pierced Lin Xiu!

Dang–

But at the same time, a white light flashed in front of Lin Xiu and he found that his hidden weapon had been knocked into the wall next to it and the sharp hidden weapon was directly embedded in the wall.

Lin Zhen’s eyes widened and before he could react, Luo Yue’s figure appeared in front of him. She was expressionless, holding her long sword about to pierce through his head!

Dang–

At this critical moment, Lin Zhen reacted and with a wave of his right hand, he blocked Luo Yue’s sword.

Looking carefully, Lin Zhen actually carried a steel claw in his hand.

This was not an ordinary steel claw, it was made of special materials and its hardness and sharpness were not comparable to ordinary weapons.

Otherwise, Luo Yue’s long sword would have penetrated the palm of his resisting hand.

“Who exactly are you!?” Lin Zhen said, staring at Luo Yue.

Although he had just guessed that Luo Yue was also from the Underground World, he had not expected that Luo Yue’s strength was so terrifying.

He was a rank 6 warrior, but before he could see Luo Yue’s movements clearly, she almost sliced his head off with a sword.

Luo Yue did not answer him and continued to attack him with a long sword!

As Luo Yue continued to swing the long sword and there seemed to be a faint white light on it.

Dang dang dang—— Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Lin Zhen frantically blocked Luo Yue’s attacks with his hands with steel claws, but Luo Yue’s offensive was too strong and there was a terrifying sword aura on this long sword bursting out, making quite a few holes appear on his clothes instantly.

“Kill him!!!” However, Lin Zhen was a rank 6 warrior after all and he was someone from the underground world who often lived at the edge of the knife. He has rich combat experience. At this time, Luo Yue couldn’t kill him.

As long as Lin Xiu was killed first, Luo Yue would definitely lose her cool. Then, he would have more opportunities!

Hearing Lin Zhen’s roar, all the other members of the Tiger Mercenary Group attacked Lin Xiu!

“Gold Skill-Trio Flame Wave!” At this time, one of the muscular men jumped high, holding a huge saber in both hands and slashing towards Lin Xiu from top to bottom!

At this moment, the saber burst out with fiery red flames, then formed a huge crescent-like shape, rushing towards Lin Xiu!

A total of three huge crescent-like flames charged towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu looked up and saw this scene, the expression on his face could not help but change.

This thing looked really terrifying, but to Lin Xiu, it still didn’t pose any threat.

The long spear in Lin Xiu’s hand drew an arc, scaring all those around him who wanted to attack Lin Xiu to retreat. Staring at the flames that rushed through the air, Lin Xiu said indifferently, “Just gold skill huh.”

As soon as he spoke, the spear in his hand suddenly pointed towards the air and a large number of flames were released from the spear in an instant!

Flames burst out directly from the spearhead of the Dark Edge spear and instantly turned into flaming birds!

The appearance of the flaming birds made the dark alley suddenly become unusually dazzling.

And these hundreds of flaming birds rushed towards the sky and all gathered together, forming a huge flaming phoenix!

This…what is going on!?

The temperature around became extremely high at this time and those tin-covered houses seemed to burn red because of the increased temperature.

The three flame slashes all hit the flaming phoenix’s body, but the flaming phoenix seemed unbothered as it rushed towards the man who released the skills in the air!

The man saw that his ‘Trio Flame Wave’ was completely blocked by the flaming phoenix that appeared and there was a look of horror in his eyes.

But now there was no other way, this huge flaming phoenix was already charging toward him!

The temperature of the flaming phoenix was too high, if it hits him, his body would probably melt!

“Go to hell!!!” The man roared loudly at this time and all the source strength in his body was mobilized. At the next moment, the sword in both hands slashed out again!

A huge sword aura burst out as if it was about to cut the flaming phoenix in half!

But what he didn’t expect was that the terrifying sword aura hit the flaming phoenix that charged over. Although it seemed to split in half instantly, at the next moment, the flaming phoenix gathered together again!

It hit his body directly, drowning his whole body in flames!
