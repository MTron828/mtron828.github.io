Chapter 308: She’s On Top

The two of them had been walking towards the front side and from a distance, they could see that there were many tall peaks appearing ahead.

These mountain peaks, which seemed to be piles of black rocks, looked very tall and there were a lot of black weird trees growing all over the area. They looked very strange.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s ears pricked up, as if he had heard something.

“There’s someone.” Lin Xiu frowned slightly, then said aloud.

“It seems like someone discovered that thing.” Hua Tian seemed to see something and the corners of his mouth rose.

“What thing?”

Lin Xiu asked subconsciously.

“Ice Lotus Fire.” Hua Tian answered.

Ice lotus fire?!

At this moment, Lin Xiu gasped. Could it be that this thing is right here!?

With that thought, Lin Xiu was shocked.

Lin Xiu looked at the other side and discovered that many people had already appeared.

A large number of people seemed to be gathered here.

In a short moment, Lin Xiu saw at least dozens or hundreds of warriors rushing towards the front.

These people were clearly not ordinary warriors, they were all high-rank warriors!

And these warriors were all well-equipped, wearing top-notch battle suits and the weapons in their hands were not ordinary products.

Also, there seemed to be more and more of these warriors appearing!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s expression changed.

No wonder he didn’t see any warriors previously, but he didn’t expect that they were all here.

And judging by the movements of these people, it was obvious that they were moving towards the mountain peak in front of them.

Could the so-called Ice lotus fire really appear!?

And it’s right in front!?

With this thought, Lin Xiu looked to the front.

All the warriors lurking in the Dark Forest had emerged.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu was a little excited. These were all warriors above rank 6 and Lin Xiu also found out that some of them were warriors who could not be analyzed by his Analytic Eye!

There was no doubt that those warriors must be rank 8 warriors!

When Lin Xiu saw such powerful warriors, but he didn’t feel afraid, but rather excited.

He wanted to fight against such powerful warriors.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and calmed down.

After all, there was still a wide gap between him and the high-ranking warriors. The most crucial thing at hand was to gain experience as quickly as possible and reach level 30!

As long as he advanced to a rank 6 warrior, he would be able to fight against even a rank 7 warrior!

“Let’s go too.” Hua Tian looked ahead and said aloud.

“Go where?” Lin Xiu was taken aback and asked.

“Grab the Ice lotus fire.” Hua Tian said indifferently, his eyes looked ahead and there was a heated desire in his eyes.

This Ice lotus fire was also something he cared about.

“Haha, you guys want to snatch the Ice lotus fire with your strength!?” After Hua Tian spoke, some warriors walked over from behind, sizing up Lin Xiu and Hua Tian and laughed.

Lin Xiu heard the voice coming from behind and turned. Then, his expression changed suddenly.

This group of warriors was all rank 7 warriors!

There were too many high-ranking warriors, huh…

“It’s none of your business.” Hua Tian glanced at him, then smiled and said aloud.

“Chap, you have guts.” The man said and gave Hua Tian a thumbs up, then looked at the warriors behind him and continued to rush forward.

This was just a small episode, these warriors now seemed to be more anxious to rush to the front.

They ignored Lin Xiu and Hua Tian.

Boom boom——

And at this moment, Lin Xiu felt the ground starting to shake slowly.

He looked towards the front side. The huge mountain on the opposite side seemed to be trembling slightly as all the warriors rushed to the front side of the mountain.

“Go!”

Hua Tian didn’t hesitate when he saw this scene, so he rushed to the front.

Lin Xiu also moved his leg at this time and quickly rushed to the front.

As he moved forward at extreme speed, Lin Xiu reached the bottom of the mountain very quickly. Looking up from here, this mountain that seemed very small from a distance turned out to be terrifyingly huge.

There was a strange white mist around it which affected people’s vision to a certain extent.

“So it seems that the Ice lotus fire must be here.” When Hua Tian watched all those people rushing up the huge black mountain, he took out a strange instrument from his pocket and looked at it. The pointer turned frantically and the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but curl up.

Lin Xiu’s eyes also saw the instrument he was holding. It was obvious that this thing was an energy tester.

It could test the fluctuation of surrounding energy.

Seeing that the pointer was turning so crazily, Lin Xiu knew that there must be a super energy body nearby.

It must be Ice Lotus Fire!

“Hurry up, we can’t let others take the lead.” Hua Tian said to Lin Xiu after putting the energy tester into his pocket.

“You said that Luo Yue is here?” Lin Xiu didn’t move at this time as he looking at Hua Tian.

The reason why Lin Xiu came here with Hua Tian was to see if Luo Yue was here and Hua Tian gave Lin Xiu a very dangerous feeling.

And now that so many high-ranking warriors were fighting for this Ice lotus fire, Lin Xiu didn’t think that he could cause any waves with his own strength.

After all, those people were a bit too strong and there was a huge disparity between their strengths.

Although Lin Xiu was confident, he wasn’t arrogant.

“Are you anxious about her?”

Hua Tian was stunned when he heard Lin Xiu’s words and the corners of his mouth curled up as he asked. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Lin Xiu frowned. To be honest, he was indeed a little worried about Luo Yue’s safety. Ever since he met her, Lin Xiu really seemed to have a special feeling for her.

“Okay, I won’t tease you anymore. If my guess is right, she’s on top.”
