“Want my source stone?”

Lin Xiu looked at them, the corners of his mouth curled up and said lightly.

Turning on the smartwatch, Lin Xiu tapped the source stone icon on the ‘Collection’ interface.

In an instant, with a flash of white light, the Source Stone of Electricity appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

When those people saw the source stone in Lin Xiu’s hand, their eyes were full of greed.

It has been a day since they came to this Sage warrior space and most of the warriors were familiar with the situation inside.

Looking at the ‘collection’ interface of the smartwatch, almost all warriors knew that they needed to collect these five energy source stones.

As soon as they heard the sound from the Sage warrior Space, they saw the bright spot in the grassland.

They rushed over here quickly, just to find that Lin Xiu and Duan Zeyan were below.

“Boy, hand it over and I can spare your life.”

One of the muscular warriors clenched the battle-ax in his hand, looked at Lin Xiu and said savagely.

“Wait, I seem to have seen this kid.”

Just as these people were approaching Lin Xiu step by step, one of the tall and thin warriors, looking at Lin Xiu, seemed to have thought of something and suddenly said aloud.

“Lao Gao, there is nothing you can do if you know him, if he doesn’t obediently hand over the source stone of Electricity in his hand…”

While speaking, one of the men held his own weapon and made a killing gesture across his neck.

Undoubtedly, if Lin Xiu didn’t give it, they would kill him and take it away forcefully.

“No, he seems to be Lin Xiu.”

The man known as Lao Gao shook his head and continued to speak.

“It’s the one who killed Huangfu Lin and Huangfu Tian of Divine Domain.”

When he said this, he looked at Lin Xiu with a look of fear in his eyes.

Who’s Huangfu Lin and Huangfutian? What sort of strength did they possess? Yet they were both killed by Lin Xiu.

The battle was very exciting and he even watched the battle video.

Lin Xiu’s strength on the field at that time was too shocking.

At this time, the expressions of everyone who heard Lao Gao’s words changed slightly.

They have also heard of this battle.

Huangfu Tian and Huangfu Lin were both very powerful and were defeated by one person…

“What are you afraid of! There are more than a dozen of us here and we are afraid that he would kill us!?”

The warrior who spoke first before pointed at Lin Xiu with the long sword in his hand.

“And I saw it the moment I came into this Sage warrior space. On the Tianjiao list, this Lin Xiu is only in the top 30 while I’m in the top 10.”

The man with the sword said proudly.

The Tianjiao List was the stone tablet from before.

When the names of all the people appear on it, they will be ranked according to the strength of each warrior.

He was the last to come in. Before he came in, he saw the names on the tablet. There was absolutely no Lin Xiu in the top ten.

In other words, Lin Xiu’s strength is not even in the top ten!

“Boy, bring it here, give it to me, I wouldn’t be a disgrace to this energy source stone.”

This warrior named Pang Kuan, held a long sword at Lin Xiu with one hand and reached out with the other hand.

He motioned Lin Xiu to give him the energy source stone.

“If you have the ability, come and get it.”

Lin Xiu looked at the energy source stone suspended in his hand and said lightly.

He didn’t know how this energy source stone is formed, but it can be directly stored in this smart watch and be taken out again, which makes Lin Xiu very curious.

“Courting death!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu was still so ignorant, Pang Kuan and the others immediately roared and attacked Lin Xiu directly!

Lao Gao’s eyes changed a bit and in the next moment, his body retreated directly to the back.

He did not participate in the attack.

Because he was someone who had watched that match and knew Lin Xiu’s terrifying strength.

“This thing should be useful…”

Lin Xiu looked at the source stone of Electricity floating in his hand and said aloud like he was talking to himself.

With Lin Xiu’s thoughts, at the same time as they rushed over, the source energy of their bodies poured into the source stone of Electricity.

crackling-

A strange sound resounded instantly!

An incomparably terrifying electric current burst out from this source stone of Electricity in an instant!

Those warriors who had just attacked Lin Xiu were all hit by these sudden currents.

boom boom boom —

In the surrounding air, there seemed to be a sound like an explosion.

These warriors were subjected to this terrifying electric current and their eyes widened immediately.

Some warriors’ bodies exploded in their bodies directly because of the current.

Blood splattered continuously from their bodies.

Some warriors were even scorched black by the electricity.

Pang Kuan, who was extremely arrogant just now, quickly unfolded the ‘Sphere” but found that the terrifying lightning seemed to be able to penetrate into the ‘Sphere’!

“what!!!”

Although the body has a certain degree of resistance, this current is much stronger than ordinary current.

It made Pang Kuan cry out.

Lao Gao, who had fled to the other side of the passage, heard the mourning of the warriors just now and his body could not help shaking.

He was a little fortunate that he ran fast.

A warrior of that level couldn’t be dealt with just numbers.

Judging from the battle at that time, he suspected that Lin Xiu was a warrior at the level of Sage warrior.

Duan Zeyan stood not far behind Lin Xiu, his whole person seemed to be frozen. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Looking at the dozen or so warriors on the ground, almost all of them were directly electrocuted by the terrifying lightning.

That is a warrior at the level of Wu Zun! So they all died!

“Is this… the power of the source stone…”

Pang Kuan half-knelt on the ground, his body trembling and he said aloud.

Until now, he did not believe that it was Lin Xiu’s own power.

They thought it was mainly the power of the source stone that caused their miserable situation.

“Goodbye.”

As Lin Xiu spoke, he snapped his fingers and suddenly an incomparably thick lightning bolt slashed directly at his body!

Boom—

As the lightning struck, Lin Xiu’s mind also received system prompt of gaining experience.

Lin Xiu was also slightly surprised when he looked at the source stone of electricity suspended in his hand.

When the source strength cooperates with the source stone of electricity and uses electric skill, it can make the current more powerful and terrifying.

If only it could be absorbed…

Lin Xiu thought about it and just when he wanted to use the system’s ‘Engulf’ skill, he immediately shook his head.

Not yet. We must find the remaining four source stones as soon as possible.

With a thought, this source stone of Electricity instantly turned into an energy body, as if it had entered the smart watch.

Lin Xiu really admired the person who made this smart watch.

“Duan Zeyan.”
