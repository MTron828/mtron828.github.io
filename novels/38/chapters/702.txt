Chapter 703 Another Lucky Draw

“Hmph!”

Huang Ji sneered. His academy was one of the hardest academies to get into.

However, he was rejected by both of them today and it was somewhat embarrassing.

Huang Ji glared at Lin Xiu before leaving.

“Mr Huang!”

Some of the staff glared at Lin Xiu as well before running after Huang Ji.

After getting the pass to Fengyun City, Lin Xiu picked up his spear and headed in the opposite direction.

“Wait.”

Just as Lin Xiu was about to leave, a voice stopped him from behind.

“What’s the matter?”

As he turned around, he noticed that it was Qian Jing

“Tomorrow morning, you have to be in Ice and Snow City.”

Qian Jing said to Lin Xiu. “We’ll get to Fengyun City from there?” Lin Xiu raised his brows before asking. “That’s right.”

“Since you won the championship, there are some who don’t like you and have kept it from

you.”

Qian Jing lowered his voice.

“Really?”

“What about you then?”

Lin Xiu laughed as he said.

“Me? I just want to have a match with you.”

Qian Jing was shocked when he heard Lin Xiu’s answer and said in a serious tone.

“Come to me when you have become a master warrior.”

Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders before leaving.

“Interesting.”

Qian Jing muttered to himself and smiled as he looked at Lin Xiu.

“Brother Lin! You’re on top of the list!”

As soon as Lin Xiu came out, Lei Chong screamed in excitement.

It was as if he was the one who had won a lottery.

Lin Xiu said helplessly, “It was just luck.” “That wasn’t luck. You were fighting Wu Changkong.”

Chen Lan shook his head. He’s lucky that he killed Wu Chankong. What a joke!

If it was truly because of luck, what’s the purpose of having a list?

Lin Xiu was walking on the streets of Marqi planet and he could feel that with a slight adjustment of his energy, he could see things clearly.

This was the energy of a rank 9 warrior.

However, this was not the destination. There were still more levels after that.

If it wasn’t because he came to Marqi planet, Lin Xiu would have never known. “You should head back first.”

Lin Xiu looked around before saying to Lei Chong and the rest. “I feel that someone will be coming for me soon.”

Lin Xiu said in a low tone.

While he was on stage, there were those who dared to play dirty tricks on him. Now that he had killed Wu Changkong, Lin Xiu had a feeling that something was about to happen.

To those in Tianlong City, he was just an outsider.

So what if an outsider with no background was killed? Who would care about him? “Are you sure…..?”

Lei Chong was surprised as he asked Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu had just become the top of the Tianlong List. Would there be anyone who would fight Lin Xiu now?

“Of course.”

Chen Lan kept quiet for a moment before speaking in a serious note.

Since this was something that would most likely happen.

“Alright then. We shall bid farewell here.”

Lin Xiu thought about it before giving a faint smile.

Lei Chong had mixed feelings about it before sighing, “Fine. Brother Lin, please be careful.”

“En. We shall meet again.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and waved goodbye to all of them before leaving.

“Brother Lei, where would you go now?”

As they looked at Lin Xiu who was walking away, Chen Lan asked Lei Chong.

“Me?”

a mon

Lei Chong paused for a moment before saying, “I want to get stronger.”

Ever since he came to this planet, Lei Chong learnt that he was too weak.

He couldn’t even fight the people here. If he really wanted to go after the Galaxy Smugglers, it would be impossible with his current abilities.

“I know a good place where you can train. Come. Let me show you.”

Chen Lan patted on Lei Chong’s shoulder as he told him.

At the same time, Lin Xiu continued on with his journey with the black spear in his arm.

Soon, he came to the peak of a mountain.

As he looked down, he could almost see the entire Tianlong City.

With Lin Xiu’s power now, he could feel if there was anyone else around him.

“Huuuuuuu….”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath as he sat on the ground.

Soon, he went into the system interface that was in his brain.

With the rewards that he had gotten for becoming a rank 9 warrior, Lin Xiu realised that he had accumulated a total of 6 lucky draw chances.

As for the column for the gene lock, it was still grey in colour. Lin Xiu couldn’t help but pursed his lips.

It must be noted that everything he activates the gene lock, it would greatly fect his strength although it meant that it could bring him danger as well.

Now that he had arrived at Marqi Planet, Lin Xiu felt that his abilities were still too weak.

There was already one master warrior in this city.

If it wasn’t because he had become a rank 9 warrior along with the help of his system, it would be impossible for him to kill Wu Changkong.

A master warrior. He has to become one within the shortest amount of time. Plus, he needed new skills as well. With what he has now, it was no longer enough for him.

Although with the large amount of energy in him, he could still gather enough energy for these skills, it still wasn’t enough.

After taking a deep breath, Lin Xiu entered the lucky draw.

He noticed that there were three columns with warrior skills.

“Six chances. I have a total of six chances. I should be able to get some good warrior skills, right?”

Lin Xiu mumbled to himself before starting the lucky draw.

The familiar spinning wheel started spinning.

“Warrior skills card! Give me a warrior skills card!”

Lin Xiu continued mumbling.

“Ding! Congratulations master, you have gotten odd crystals!” “F**k!”

After seeing the first rewards, Lin Xiu cursed out of anger. Odd crystals weren’t helpful for him now.

He continued with the lucky draw.

“Ding! Congratulations Master, you have won the Union coins…”

“Ding! Congratulations Master, you have won a pair of normal war boots …”

“Ding! Congratulation master, you have won a golden warrior skills card!”

“Ding…”

“What the f**k?!”

Lin Xiu stared at the things that fell from the sky and he had a head filled with questions.

The thing that Lin Xiu hated most was that he had gotten union coins! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

This thing….. how would it be useful?

As he looked at the pass that could get him a million union coins, Lin Xiu pursed his lips before keeping it inside his pocket.

The odd crystals were only of rank 4 and rank 5. They were just normal crystals. Lin Xiu initially wanted to absorb all of them but after thinking about it, he thought that he could exchange them for some coins that could be used on the Marqi planet.

Since he would be needing them to pay for food and a place to stay in the future.
