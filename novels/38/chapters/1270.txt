1271 Dark Power!

The glove has been destroyed, the flesh on the fist had also been split and the exposed bones could be clearly seen.

There was also severe pain in the body.

On the face, because of the sword aura bursting out from the Frosty giant sword, there were many bloodstains.

“Hoo hoo…”

There was blood dripping down from his lips.

This Liu Cheng was no weaker than that of Liu Mo.

It took too much energy to deal with Liu Mo before. Although his recovery speed was very fast, he was not yet in a state of complete victory.

What’s more, ‘Fury’ was in a cooling state.

Now he couldn’t use the Fury skill at all.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you so easily.”

At this time, Liu Cheng slowly walked toward Lin Xiu.

He glanced at Baili Haoling who was caught by Xiaobai in the sky over there.

Obviously, Baili Haoling was injured by his sword aura just now and now she was also in a state of serious injury.

There was nothing to be afraid of now and she couldn’t run away even if she wants to.

Turning his gaze to Lin Xiu again, he said in a cold voice:

“I will chop off all your limbs first, then torture you all slowly…”

But Lin Xiu didn’t pay attention to his words at all and was still out of breath.

At this time, the body also trembled slightly.

Looking at the red clothes of Baili Haoling who was taken into the air by Xiao Bai, and Lei Tong and Mr. Pang who had their limbs cut off not far away.

His body trembled slightly.

There was an infinite killing intent in the eyes gathered together.

“Why, do you think that you can still resist now?”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s eyes, Liu Cheng sneered.

From his point of view, Lin Xiu was just in his final struggle now.

He held the Frosty giant sword in his right hand and a large amount of source strength was transmitted to the giant sword.

Just now he attacked Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ and he clearly saw a little crack in Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ due to his attack.

Now even if Lin Xiu unfolded the ‘Sphere’ again, he was confident that he could directly destroy it.

Then directly behead Lin Xiu.

Liu Cheng stared at Lin Xiu, who seemed to be immobilized and would not run away, with a sneer on the corner of his mouth.

Just now he wanted to behead Lin Xiu directly, but he changed his mind again.

He wanted to cut off Lin Xiu’s limbs first, turn him into a worm and torture him slowly!

Yes, that’s right, that’s it!

With that in mind, he held the right hand of Frosty Giant Sword and swung it directly into the air.

Whoosh whoosh——

The moment he swung the sword, streams of frosty sword aura burst out directly from this huge frosty sword full of incomparably terrifying energy!

All these sword auras rushed toward Lin Xiu’s hands and feet.

Obviously to cut off all of Lin Xiu’s hands and feet!

But just when those sword auras were about to hit Lin Xiu’s hands and feet, those sword auras suddenly disappeared as if they were blocked by something!

what happened!?

When Liu Cheng saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes couldn’t help shrinking.

His sword auras were extremely powerful, even if Lin Xiu uses ‘Sphere’ now, he can’t resist it!

What’s more, now Lin Xiu was using ‘Sphere’ at all.

Crash, clatter——

With a strange sound, Liu Cheng could clearly see some strange dark energy slowly being released from Lin Xiu’s body.

These weird dark energies are like black mist.

“Hoo hoo…”

At this moment, Lin Xiu was also panting.

He felt a burning sensation all over his body.

It’s hot, very hot.

Hot sweat broke out on his forehead.

Something hidden in the body seemed to emerge at this moment.

Upon closer inspection, it was some black matter.

The dark energy that could not be used before seemed to start to emerge from his body at this time.

It was also these dark energies that blocked the impact of Liu Cheng’s sword aura just now.

...

With the appearance of these dark energies, more killing intent emerged in Lin Xiu’s heart.

That killing intent even made Liu Cheng feel a sense of fear.

At this time, Liu Cheng already felt that the situation was a bit unexpected.

Without any hesitation, he mobilized all the energy in his body at the next moment.

Clenching the Frosty Giant Sword with both hands, he rushed directly in front of Lin Xiu!

He wants to use all his strength to strike and kill Lin Xiu!

Go to hell!

Liu Cheng roared in his heart, he didn’t want to torture Lin Xiu slowly anymore and the frosty giant sword he held in both hands was going to chop Lin Xiu in half!

boom–

But when the huge sword he raised was about to chop Lin Xiu’s body in half from top to bottom, those dark forces directly blocked Lin Xiu.

Liu Cheng’s Frosty giant sword also slashed at those black mist-like dark energies at this moment.

...

It was as if he had chopped something extremely hard, there was no way to chop Lin Xiu’s body!

how can that be!

Seeing this scene, Liu Cheng opened his eyes wide, filled with disbelief.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered and those dark energies rushed toward him crazily!

Liu Cheng’s expression changed drastically at this time, he instinctively felt the horror of these dark energies.

At this time, he did not continue to attack Lin Xiu but retreated directly to the back. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Lin Xiu looked at Liu Cheng who was dodging away. At this time, he stretched out his right hand and a large amount of dark energy rushed toward the front.

Moreover, the dark energy at this time quickly turned into iron chains.

Surrounding Liu Cheng from all directions.

“Go away!”

Looking at these dark iron chains, Liu Cheng roared angrily and swung the frosty giant sword in his hand, intending to chop off all these dark iron chains.

But the iron chains formed by these dark energies can’t be chopped off at all.

And in the next moment, he felt a sharp pain in his shoulder.

Taking a closer look, his shoulders have been pierced by an iron chain!

The severe pain made his face extremely ugly.

The frosty giant sword in his right hand wanted to cut off the dark iron chain running through his shoulder.

boom–

But when the Frosty giant sword slashed on the dark iron chain, there was only a dull sound.

Still haven’t been able to cut off the dark iron chain!

And at this time, more dark iron chains came rushing over!

At this time, Liu Cheng wanted to expand the ‘Sphere’ to resist but found that it was too late.

“what!!!”

A large number of iron chains penetrated his body and Liu Cheng couldn’t help but let out a wailing cry at this moment.

The Frosty giant sword in his hand also fell directly to the ground.

Lin Xiu looked at Liu Cheng who was pierced by a large number of dark iron chains, without any expression on his face.

Step by step, he walked toward Liu Cheng.

Soon, he stood in front of Liu Cheng.

At this time, a large number of iron chains had already penetrated Liu Cheng’s body, but they did not penetrate to his fatal point.

Looking at the Frosty Giant Sword on the ground, with a thought triggered, the Frosty Giant Sword flew directly into Lin Xiu’s hands.

An extremely cold feeling was transmitted to Lin Xiu’s hands.

It seemed that Lin Xiu’s hands were going to be frozen.

But with the operation of Heart of Frost, this freezing feeling gradually weakened.

Holding his Frosty giant sword, Lin Xiu looked at Liu Cheng and slashed down!
