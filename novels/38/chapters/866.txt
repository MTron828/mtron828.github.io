Chapter 867: When Are You and Luo Yue Getting Engaged?

??

At this time in Luo’s house, Lin Xiu was sitting next to the coffee table drinking tea, and when he heard Luo Zhen’s words, he suddenly spat out a sip of tea.

Luo Zhen, who was sitting opposite Lin Xiu, had tea all over his face.

“Cough, I’m sorry.”

Lin Xiu said a little embarrassedly.

“Gugu!”

“Squeak!”

Although the two evolved beasts, Rollie and Xiao Bai, can become very large now, their size can be reduced at any time, and now they are the size of small birds, crawling on Lin Xiu’s shoulders.

It seems that they hadn’t seen Lin Xiu for a long time. These two evolved beasts were very attached to Lin Xiu. At this time, they climbed on Lin Xiu’s shoulders and didn’t seem to want to leave at all.

Although Lin Xiu was a little helpless at this time, there was a softness in his eyes.

They were attached to him.

“I said, when are you going to set a wedding date with my daughter.”

Luo Zhen wiped the tea on his cheeks at this time, then glared at Lin Xiu and said.

“this...”

Lin Xiu was still a little nervous at this time.

After all, before he crossed over, he was someone who didn’t even have a girlfriend, and now they were talking about marriage.

In addition to being nervous, he was also quite eager.

At this moment, in his eyes, he seemed to see Luo Yue wearing a wedding dress.

It would definitely be beautiful.

“Lin Xiu?”

“Oh, uncle.”

Lin Xiu came back to his senses at this time, and said aloud.

“I think the tenth day of February next year will be a good day. What do you think?”

Luo Zhen took out a calendar and said aloud.

This kind of paper calendar has rarely appeared on the market, and he wasn’t sure where Luo Zhen got it from.

“I’ll ask Luo Yue what she thinks later...”

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then said aloud.

After all, he hasn’t proposed yet.

“En... that’s fine too.”

Luo Zhen thought for a while, then said aloud.

“You boy, if you dare to bully my daughter, I will make you suffer, you hear me!”

Luo Zhen looked at Lin Xiu at this time, felt as if his favorite was being stolen, and immediately glared at Lin Xiu, the ‘thief’.

“certainly!”

Lin Xiu nodded seriously.

He will definitely treat Luo Yue well even without Luo Zhen’s warning. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“But I plan to go to the Namir planet.”

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment, then said aloud.

“Namir Planet?”

Luo Zhen was stunned for a moment, and seemed a little puzzled.

Lin Xiu thought for a while, and then told him something he knew.

“It turns out that it is a higher-level planet than the Marqi planet...”

“Aren’t the warriors there even more powerful?”

Luo Zhen said with shock in his eyes.

“Indeed.”

Lin Xiu nodded, this was to be expected.

“Tomorrow, there should be another group of people from Namir Planet. If we don’t get rid of them, our earth will also be in danger.”

If it wasn’t for those people from Namir Planet who wanted to have some fun on earth previously, with just the strength of their dozens of Master warrior-level warriors, earth would definitely be turned upside down.

“And most importantly, I want to find a flower to treat Luo Yue’s sequelae.”

Lin Xiu said this and was silent for a while.

There was still no cure to Luo Yue’s sequelae and the only way was to see if this more advanced Namir planet had the legendary Orchid of Heaven.

“I know of this secret technique too and the sequelae are very strong.”
