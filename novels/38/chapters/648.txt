Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

Terrible, this skill was really terrifying!

Even Yu Muchen had to admit that he was scared now.

The eyes of the vice president of Sky City widened and his face was full of disbelief.

“Hidden Source Technique!!!”

He gritted his teeth and said.

‘When the Hidden Source Technique is cultivated to the extreme, it not only compress and hide a large amount of source strength in one’s body, but also reduce the size of the warrior’s body, which was equivalent to the effect of rejuvenation.

‘Once restored to the warrior’s original state, the warrior’s strength would also increase greatly.

‘The surrounding audience was in an uproar at this time, because the current Baili Haoling’s body had obviously changed to look like she was eighteen or nineteen years old.

The loose battle suit has become tighter now, which outlined her graceful figure.

The only thing that hasn’t changed was that her chest was still flat.

“Thaven’t restored my original body for a long time.”

Baili Haoling strentched at this moment, then said lightly.

“Good… what a powerful force.”

Ouyang Hang and others were a little dumbfounded when they saw this. The current Baili Haoling was really too powerful.

Even off the stage, they could feel the powerful force from Baili Haoling’s body.

That kind of power made them feel fear and their bodies were trembling.

“She is a rank 9 warrior…?”

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao also swallowed secretly at this time.

Baili Haoling appeared in the academy before. They all knew that Bai Litao’s granddaughter was very strong, but they didn’t expect her to be so strong.

“No, to be precise, she’s a very powerful rank 9 warrior.”

Ouyang Hang clenched his fists and said aloud.

“Her eyes… she’s the offspring of that kind of person!?”

‘The deputy dean of the Sky Academy suddenly turned around to look at Bai Litao and said aloud.

Bai Litao sneered and didn’t say anything to him.

That’s right, Baili Haoling inherited the most perfect bloodline from their ancestors.

Even he didn’t have it.

Her potential was much stronger than that of her poor old man.

Lin Xiu rolled back and dodged Nanhuang’s attack. At this moment, he looked at Baili Haoling, his eyes filled with shock.

Baili Haoling seemed to have suddenly grown up again.

Moreover, the terrifying power coming from her body made Lin Xiu feel a little scared.

Especially Baili Haoling, those blood-red eyes were even more terrifying.

“Where are you looking?”

Just as Lin Xiu looked at Baili Haoling, the spear held by Nan Huang stabbed Lin Xiu again!

Boom-

Fortunately, Lin Xiu reacted quickly and avoided the attack with a single step back.

Nan Huang’s spear stabbed directly on the ground, making a loud noise.

A.small pit was created on the floor of the platform!

You must know that the hardest material was used to cast this competition platform and it took more than a year to create it.

Nothing like this ever happened.

“Interesting, it seems that in the end it should be Nan Huang and Baili Haoling fighting!”

At this time, those spectators around who thought the situation would be one-sided, saw this battle at and got excited.

“Kill her! I must kill her!”

Those from the Chen family saw that Chen Jin was killed and at this moment, their bodies trembled.

“Damn.”

Yu Muchen gritted his teeth and looked at Baili Haoling as if he was considering something.

“Jiang Feng, go and hold him back!”

‘Ent

Although the man known as Jiang Feng felt a little scared by the power from Baili Haoling’s body, he still nodded.

“Jiang Feng!?”

Lin Xiu’s hearing ability was very good and when he heard this voice, the expression in his eyes suddenly changed.

“You are Jiang Feng from the Jiang family!?”

Lin Xiu jumped directly to Jiang Feng’s side, pointing his spear at him, his eyes filled with terrifying murderous aura.

“So what!”

Jiang Feng stared at Lin Xiu and said arrogantly.

He was a member of the Chen Jiang family in sky city and he has no fear at all for someone like Lin Xiu who has no background.

What’s more, he felt that Lin Xiu’s power seemed to be weaker than him.

“Very good, accept your fate!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened at this time and he shouted loudly, holding the spear directly, ignoring Nan Huang’s pursuit and rushed towards Jiang Feng!

All those people on the list had been killed by Lin Xiu. This was Jiang Feng of the Jiang family. It seemed that his information has been protected in some way, so Lin Xiu couldn’t find him.

Unexpectedly, this Jiang Feng was in the Sky Academy team!

“Want to kill me? Let’s see who kills who!”

Seeing Lin Xiu suddenly burst out with a powerful murderous aura rushing towards him, Jiang Feng did not show any signs of fear, but instead rushed towards Lin Xiu.

Nan Huang frowned at this time and when he wanted to continue to attack Lin Xiu, Baili Haoling rushed over to block his attack.

Dang–

“You should stop participating in the battle.”

Baili Haoling looked at Nan Huang and said coldly.

And Yu Muchen stood there, not knowing what he was doing, with cold sweat on his forehead and his body began to tremble slightly.

Lin Xiu, who was attacking Jiang Feng, frantically waved the spear in his hand.

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

The spear stabbed out and turned into countless phantoms.

Jiang Feng’s long sword swung constantly, resisting all these attacks. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

But Lin Xiu’s attack was too fierce and Jiang Feng’s eyes were slightly shocked at this time.

Boom-

Just after he blocked Lin Xiu’s ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’, he saw a flaming bird charging towards him!

‘As soon as the flaming bird appeared, the temperature of the surrounding air instantly increased a lot, as if he was in a big stove.

Jiang Feng directly used his movement skill to dodge.

But just as he dodged, another flame hit him again!

No, not just one, but dozens!!!

‘Sphere’!!!

Jiang Feng had no choice. This kind of intensive attack, no matter how powerful the movement skill was, there was no way to dodge!

At this time, with the appearance of his ‘Sphere’, a large number of flaming birds were all resisted by his ‘Sphere’.

But even if he resisted it, the temperature of the flame still made his whole body soaked with sweat.

Before he could react, Lin Xiu appeared in front of him again.

His eyes were full of hatred, as if he saw the enemy who killed his father.

Jiang Feng’s eyes were horrified, is this person crazy!?
