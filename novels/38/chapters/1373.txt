1374 The God King’s Spirit

Lin Xiu didn’t even give him the chance to react and started attacking An Tianlan like mad.

‘True Fire Fist’ was a warrior skill that didn’t require much energy and so Lin Xiu would be able to use it effortlessly!

Boom boom boom –

An Tianlan was in a dire state but he couldn’t find any chance to retaliate!

Plus, as soon as his evolved beast rose into the air, Lin Xiu would send it back to the ground.

In the end, his ride could no longer take it and laid motionlessly on the ground.

There was also blood trickling from the edge of his mouth.

He was about to turn crazy. Lin Xiu’s attacks were so vicious that there was no way he could retaliate.

As for now, he could no longer hold on any longer!

‘Destroy the Sky’!!!

At the same time, Lin Xiu found the opportunity to gather all of the energy in his body onto his left fist.

This was the skill that exhausted him the most but it also has the most destructive powers.

“AHHHHHH!!!!”

Seeing what was about to happen to him, An Tianlan screamed in fear.

With the remaining energy in him, he quickly released his ‘sphere’.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu’s attack directly landed on his ‘sphere’, causing it to explode on the spot.

“He’s dead.”

XIao Qingchen let out a cold laugh after seeing this.

“Well, things are about to get messy.”

Yuan Zheng muttered softly.

The rest of the warriors who were around watched the scene before them in shock.

Pfft – –

An Tianlan’s eyes were wide open and he couldn’t believe what was happening!

Then, a mouthful of blood came splashing out of his mouth like an arrow.

Lin Xiu’s little black dragon went straight to his spear. Its mouth was wide open and it immediately engulfed An Tianlan’s divine spirit!

“What was that?!”

Xiao Qingchen’s pupils shrank subconsciously.

Lin Xiu’s divine spirit could engulf another person’s divine spirit!

Watching how An Tianlan’s divine spirit got devoured by the little black dragon, Xiao Qingchen felt chills running down his spine.

This was terrifying! A divine spirit can be engulfed by another party?!

As he thought of how he had fought Lin Xiu, he felt frightened.

If his divine spirit got engulfed, it would be over for him! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Then, after blasting An Tianlan’s ‘sphere’, Lin Xiu sent another punch directly at An Tianlan’s head!

An Tianlan had no energy left to retaliate after being hit continuously.

“That’s enough!”

Just as Lin Xiu’s punch was about to hit An Tianlan’s head, there was a loud voice that rang in the air.

Boom – –

Then, there was a light blue barrier that protected An Tianlan’s body from the punch.

Lin Xiu, on the other hand, got pushed backwards because of the impact and it caused him to land on one of the tall buildings.

Pfft – –

Lin Xiu felt a metallic taste in his throat and there was blood coming out of his mouth.

When he took a closer look, there was a huge human figure that appeared before An Tianlan and that was the one that stopped Lin Xiu.

“The master of the Royal Beast Sect!”

Yuan Zheng was stunned to see who it was.

“Just a part of his spirit.”

Xiao Qingchen sneered as he said so.

Even when he sounded indifferent, there was still a hint of surprise in his eyes.

The energy of a god king was way beyond a warrior god.

A small part of his spirit was already this powerful.

“God King An, it’s not appropriate for you to get into Warrior God City in this manner, don’t you think?”

Suddenly, there was another sound that appeared.

That’s when they saw a semitransparent old man in the air.

“Mr Shima!”

...

Seeing who it was, all of the warriors in the city were overjoyed.

This old man was the one responsible for Warrior God City. They only knew him as Mr Shima and they had no idea what his actual name was.

“My apologies. I only wanted to protect my son, I didn’t mean to intrude.”

“I will leave immediately.”

The spirit of the master of the Royal Beast Sect glanced at Lin Xiu before taking An Tianlan with him.

Huuu ~

At the same time, Lin Xiu returned to the ground and rubbed off the blood that was hanging at the corner of his mouth.

Was that the power of a god king?

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

If it wasn’t because of the god king that suddenly appeared, An Tianlan would have been dead.

But now, it was obvious that the God King of the Royal Beast Sect had noted down who he was.

...

Once he walked out of this city, he would definitely be ambushed.

Mr Shima’s figure disappeared as well.

“Lin Xiu, are you alright?”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng quickly walked over.

“I’m fine. Just a little disappointed that I didn’t get to kill that boy.”

Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders.

The God King was too powerful and he couldn’t fight him now.

Even when Lin Xiu had the system, it would still be impossible.

“If it wasn’t because they left a part of that spirit on An Tianlan, he would have died already.”

Xiao Qingchen added on to it.

“Well, looks like we’re in trouble once we get out.”

Yuan Zheng sighed helplessly.

“Why? Are you afraid?”

Xiao Qingchen heard his sigh and asked in a cold tone.

“I’m not afraid. I’m just worried that they’ll go after my family.”

Yuan Zheng shook his head.

In comparison to Xiao Qingchen and Lin Xiu, he had more to worry about as he was already married with kids.

“Those who are married are indeed troublesome.”

Xiao Qingchen shook his head.

“Lin Xiu, do you have a wife?”

He asked Lin Xiu instead.

However, Lin Xiu did not answer him and quickly walked towards the golden spear that was on the ground.

An Tianlan was rescued by the God King from the Royal Beast Sect but he left his weapon behind.

As Lin Xiu grabbed onto the spear, he could feel that his weapon was different from the others.

“Expected from the son of a God King. This is a pretty good weapon.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up with hope as he stared at the weapon.

This was almost equivalent to his Dark Edge.

However, it was the colour that Lin Xiu didn’t like. It was completely gold in colour and it looked horrible!

At the same time, Lin Xiu noticed that the bodies of Zhuo Qiu, Luo Tian along with the evolved beasts have disappeared.

“Hmm?”

Lin Xiu was surprised when he noticed this.

Could it be possible that the Warrior God City had an automated cleaning system?

“Well, this is a good weapon.”

Xiao Qingchen’s eyes lit up bright when he saw the weapon in Lin Xiu’s arms.

The God King seemed to have forgotten about the weapon as he was in a rush to rescue his son.

“En. I’ll use it for the time being.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

Before he finds the materials for his Dark Edge, he would have to use this first.
