Chapter 906: ’Fist Ray’

Elder Sun looked at Lin Xiu’s terrifying eyes at this time and his body trembled slightly.

Terrifying, it’s really too terrifying.

Lin Xiu took the wooden box containing the Purple Gold skill Card and directly rode the Android horse to the other side.

Zhang Lin felt a little uncomfortable seeing this scene.

He vaguely felt that their white troop seemed to have missed an opportunity to win over a strong man.

Lin Xiu didn’t think so much. At this time, he opened the box and took a look while driving the horse forward.

“Eh?”

Taking a closer look, inside this box was actually a fist technique.skill card

‘Fist Ray’.

These two words were written on the skill card.

...

Moreover, the skill card depicts a man clenching his fists, with white light all over his fists.

It looks like this punch has the potential to destroy the world.

“It seems to be pretty good.”

Lin Xiu held the skill card and said to himself.

Stopping at a hilltop, Lin Xiu jumped off the horse and sat cross-legged on the ground.

He put this Purple-gold skill Card on his forehead.

As the source strength in the body was mobilized, then communicated with the skill card, the skill card suddenly burst out with a purple-gold light.

Soon, a large amount of skill information poured into Lin Xiu’s forehead.

And entered his mind.

Compared with the Holy-level skill card, the use of the Purple-gold skill card did not give Lin Xiu the feeling that his head was crushed.

It was very easy to absorb all the information in this Purple-gold skill Card into his mind.

Opening his eyes, Lin Xiu stood up.

Because he has learned the fist technique skill before, it is not that difficult for Lin Xiu to learn the new skill.

Lin Xiu clenched his hands tightly at this moment and in the next moment, a large amount of source strength gathered on Lin Xiu’s hands.

Looking at a giant tree in front of him, he punched it directly! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Boom—

At the same time as the fist hit the tree, the fist burst out with a dazzling white light.

The trees in front of them were directly blasted into pieces.

And the power of this punch was directly transmitted to the back, knocking down all the trees behind.

You know, these trees are harder than ordinary steel.

“not bad.”

Lin Xiu looked at his fist and said to himself.

The power of this ‘Fist Ray’ was not very great at first.

He had to practice till a dazzling cold light erupts when his fist punches out, then it can be regarded as a great achievement.

In order to be able to exert its full strength.

But now Lin Xiu could only release a little white light.

“interesting.”

Lin Xiu looked at his fist and in the next moment, he continued to wave it.

Now Lin Xiu has regained the feeling of learning boxing.

His hands waved wildly.

With Lin Xiu’s current comprehension, it is not particularly difficult to truly learn this skill completely.

Time passed quickly.

On the next morning, Lin Xiu finally lay down on the ground a little tired.

From last night till the next morning, he had thrown countless punches.

And every time he swung his fist, it was equivalent to using the skill ‘Fist Ray’.

The consumption of source strength was very large.

He rode the Android Horse to the nearby river and Lin Xiu washed his face then looked towards the distance.

His eyes narrowed slightly.

Today, it’s time to enter Wildfire City.

He rode his horse and went to the front.

From time to time, Lin Xiu looked at some warriors who were also walking towards Wildfire City.

It seems to be quite lively...

Lin Xiu was a little surprised to see this scene.

At the huge gate of Wildfire City, there were many people entering and leaving.

There were lesser people leaving than entering.

Just looking at it like this, it is much more lively than Aoshuang City.

“Stop!”

At this time, when Lin Xiu rode his Android horse and was about to enter Wildfire City, he was stopped by two guards.

“What’s wrong?”

Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

“Where do you come from?”

The two guards glanced at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

“Ao Shuang City.”

“What are you doing here?”

“Passing by, going in to have a rest.”

Lin Xiu spread his hands helplessly and said.

The two guards looked at Lin Xiu, then glanced at Lin Xiu with an instrument.

“Master warrior-level warrior?”

When the two guards saw the content displayed on the scanner, they couldn’t help showing a mocking smile.

In Wildfire City, master warrior-level warriors are almost at the bottom.

“go in.”

One of the warriors waved his hand in disdain and said to Lin Xiu.

“You dare to ride a limited-edition Android horse with this little strength. In there, I advise you to be careful.”

Another warrior also said at this time.

Their tone was full of arrogance and they looked down on people very much.

Lin Xiu ignored them and rode his horse directly into the city.

The skill ‘Disguise’ was very useful, even their instruments can’t detect Lin Xiu’s power.

Gu lu—

As soon as he entered the city, Lin Xiu’s stomach rang slightly.

He was tired of drinking nourishment liquid and dry food. Yesterday, Lin Xiu didn’t eat anything.

He glanced at a large hotel nearby and walked directly over.

“Just leave the android horse here.”

A waiter at the door looked at the huge android horse next to Lin Xiu and said quickly.

He was very sharp and noticed that this Android horse was a special limited-edition android horse, which not only consumed little energy, but was also fast.

And it’s smart and can help in battle.

The price is extraordinary.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly and walked in directly.

He glanced at the inside a little and he could clearly see that there were many warriors around.

These warriors are all carrying warriors and backpacks and they seem to be from other places.

Lin Xiu sat down and ordered some food casually.

At this time, with the Analytic eye, he found that the strength of the surrounding warriors was very high, almost all of them are at the level of King warrior.

There are one or two others, who have already reached the peak of King warrior and half of their feet have entered the realm of Respected warrior.

The strength of the surrounding warriors is indeed quite strong.

“Are there always so many people in Wildfire City?”

Lin Xiu came over to the waiter who was serving food for him.

“of course not.”

The waiter said aloud while putting down the dishes.

“Normally there aren’t that many people, but recently...”

Speaking of which, he seemed to sense something and quickly shut up.

“Because it’s the weekend.”

Although Lin Xiu found it a little weird, he didn’t say much.

The next moment, a group of warriors walked in the direction where Lin Xiu was sitting.
