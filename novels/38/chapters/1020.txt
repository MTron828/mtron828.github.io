Chapter 1021: Killing Frenzy

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Why are you afraid of him?! Kill him!”

An Ruqing saw how his men were trying to run and he screamed in rage.

With his loud voice, all of the warriors finally came out of the fear that they once felt for Lin Xiu.

That’s when they released their ‘sphere’s for self protection.

This was because the lightning bolts that Lin Xiu had released earlier were extremely scary.

“Hmph! Dirty tricks!”

The sage warrior who was holding onto Wang Qiang’s scapula muttered to himself as he stared at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as well.

Then, he moved his right hand and Wang Qiang’s body started flying towards Lin Xiu!

The sage warrior was confused.

He soon realised that he could not hold onto Wang Qiang!

Xiu – –

Soon, Wang Qiang landed next to Lin Xiu.

“Are you alright?”

Lin Xiu looked at him and asked.

There were 5 bloody holes that could be seen behind Wang Qiang’s back.

These were formed by the sage warrior when he dug his nails into Wang Qiang’s back.

“I’m fine.”

Although he was still in pain, he still gritted onto his teeth and said he was fine.

Lin Xiu gathered his thoughts and the water crystal ball on his necklace started glowing brightly.

Droplets of water that were blue in colour flew towards Wang Qiang and his parents.

As the droplets of water landed on their wounds, they felt a warm feeling on it that ran throughout their body.

Soon, their wounds started recovering on their own.

“The An family is the strongest family in Tianjiao City?”

Lin Xiu asked.

“Hmph! It’s too late for you to regret now!”

An Ruqing glared at Lin Xiu as he laughed.

He thought that Lin Xiu had finally felt frightened by the power of the An family and had regretted messing with them.

“No. I wanted to say that the An family will no longer exist after today.”

Lin Xiu shook his head as he spoke to An Ruqing.

“Nonsense!”

An Ruqing turned pale when he heard what Lin Xiu said.

“Kill him! Kill him now!”

With that, hundreds of warriors started running towards Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

Some of the warriors who had their ‘sphere’ released wanted to attack Lin Xiu when there was a huge noise that came from above.

Suddenly, a huge figure appeared from the sky.

Some of the ‘sphere’ that have been released immediately exploded!

Then, the warriors in it turned into meat patty.

What on earth?!

All of the warriors were shocked.

When they took a closer look, they noticed the Angel that was in the air.

“Kill them all.”

Lin Xiu spoked to the Angel.

Instantly, the pike the Angel was holding onto started glowing brightly.

Boom – –

In a blink of an eye, the Angel started attacking all of the warriors on the ground.

Even with their ‘sphere’ released, it was immediately destroyed by the sharp pike!

The pike pierced through their sphere and then through their bodies!

“Nooooo!”

An Ruqing couldn’t help but scream when he saw what was happening.

This Angel was overpowering. She was killing all of the warriors from the An family.

As for his warriors, they had no chance of fighting the angel.

“Sun Tao!!”

An Ruqing suddenly screamed towards the sage warrior.

The sage warrior released his energy as well and dashed towards the Angel.

Boom boom – –

As he released his warrior skills, he started attacking the angel’s body.

But, the armour of the Angel was much more sturdy than he had imagined.

The sage warrior wasn’t able to do any damage to the Angel.

Plus, the Angel has an energy barrier around him and she was able to block most of their attacks.

“You brat! You even killed those from the Qian family! I have already told them about it. You better stop fighting us now!”

An Ruqing looked at the scene before him and his heart was bleeding.

These were elites that the An family had accumulated all these years. He didn’t think that they would all be destroyed by this robot.

The thing that he felt most helpless about was that there was nothing he could do.

He could only threaten Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as well. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The man from the Qian family that An Ruqing was talking about should be the young man that was with Anda.

The man was still young but he was already a sage warrior. This meant that he was no ordinary person.

Plus, the skills that he used were peculiar as well.

It belongs to the energy of darkness.

However, Lin Xiu was not afraid of it. He gathered his thoughts and as the black sourcemark appeared on his head, there were arrays that appeared around An Ruqing’s body.

Seeing how the arrays were now all over his body, An Ruqing started to panic.

He was trying his best to free himself from the array but he noticed that it was useless.

“Sun Tao!”

He looked over to the other side and screamed for help.

The sage warrior known as Sun Tao was still busy fighting the Angel when he heard An Ruqing calling for him.

Then, he quickly flew towards Lin Xiu!

“Move aside!”

As he looked at Lin Xiu, he screamed out loud.

He moved his right hand and there were sharp windblades that headed towards Lin Xiu!

The wind warriors skills!

These wind blades were invisible to the eye but from the sound of it, one should still be able to figure out where it was coming from.

Lin Xiu gathered his energy and his body disappeared.

‘Flashing souls’!

Xiu – –

Lin Xiu suddenly appeared behind the sage warrior and he clenched onto his fist.

Crackling – –

There were thick lightning bolts that appeared all over Lin Xiu’s fist.

This time, Lin Xiu would not be using the ‘Lightning Rupturing Fist’ but the new skills that he had learnt – ‘Explosive Strike.’

But….after modifying it, it should be known as the ‘Explosive Lightning Strike’.

As the lightning bolts appeared, there was a bright light surrounding his fist as well.

What’s this?!

Sun Tao could feel a strong energy coming from Lin Xiu’s fist as well.

As the bright light entered his eyes, the only thing that he could see was a bright white light before him.

He didn’t think much and quickly released his ‘sphere’!

Boom – –

As soon as his ‘sphere’ appeared, Lin Xiu fist landed on it instantly!
