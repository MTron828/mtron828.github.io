Chapter 486: Can’t Do It

Lin Xiu followed the doctor to pay the money at this time. After all, Lin Xiu still had a lot of union coins, and he could get a lot of union coins by selling some odd crystals.

At this time, Director Qian and Zhao Xia were walking down from the upper floor of the hospital. When they reached the central hall, they saw Lin Xiu standing a distance away.

Zhao Xia’s gaze suddenly changed when he saw Lin Xiu, and his gaze was sinister.

Although he couldn’t wait to kill Lin Xiu, it was simply a dream to get rid of Lin Xiu with his current strength.

“Go and see, what is he doing there.” Zhao Xia was leaning on the wall at this time, and then said to Director Qian.

Director Qian saw that Lin Xiu over there and was a little afraid to go, but when he heard Zhao Xia’s words, he still nodded and obeyed.

After Lin Xiu paid the fee at the front desk, he took the elevator straight up without noticing the two people.

“What did he do just now?” Director Qian walked over and said to the staff member.

The staff member glanced at Director Qian, and then said aloud, “That gentleman is paying medical expenses.”

“He is hospitalized?” Director Qian was taken aback, and then subconsciously said aloud.

“Sorry, I can’t reveal anything else.” The staff shook his head and said.

But at this moment, Zhao Xia has already walked over. He knocked on the table and demanded, “Tell me what he was doing just now.” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Seeing Zhao Xia’s face, the staff member suddenly revealed a flattering smile and said, “Young master Zhao.”

In Bai Di City, many people knew Zhao Xia. Although Zhao Xia was not studying in Bai Di City, he was still from the Zhao family after all.

“The kid just now was helping someone pay a surgery fee.” The staff member seemed very stern just now, but when he saw Zhao Xia, he immediately told him everything.

“Ye Xing?” Zhao Xia looked at the man’s information, and then seemed to recall something, and suddenly sneered, “Want to be treated here? No way!”

“The money has been paid, let’s perform the operation right away.” At the same time, Lin Xiu had walked back to the ward and then said to the attending doctor who was still in the ward.

The doctor was slightly surprised to see Lin Xiu coming back so soon, but at this time he nodded and said, “I’ll go out and prepare.”

When he was about to go out, he felt his mobile phone vibrate.

He took out his mobile phone and answered the answer, then the look on his face changed. He had already walked out of the door, after hanging up the phone, he walked back.

“I’m sorry, I may not be able to perform the operation for the time being…” The doctor hesitated for a while, gritted his teeth, and said aloud to Lin Xiu and the others.

“Why!?” Ye Shuang’er became anxious when she heard his words.

The bones of her father’s limbs were broken, and if he didn’t have an operation to fix them, what happens if he’s disabled?

“The surgery appointment is full…I can’t do it,” he gritted his teeth.

“When can you do it then?” The middle-aged woman on the side frowned at this time.

She was a friend of Ye Shuang’er’s parents, and she was the one who called the ambulance.

“I don’t think I can do it this afternoon either…”

“Oh? Really?” Lin Xiu sneered at this time, and then faintly said, “I just saw your operating room, there seems to be no one.”

As soon as Lin Xiu’s words came out, the man’s forehead was suddenly covered with cold sweat.

“Anyway, I just can’t do it, you guys should find another hospital.” The doctor didn’t know how to answer at this time and shook his head then turned to leave.

But as soon as he turned around, he realized that Lin Xiu was already standing in front of him.

“What do you want?” The doctor was taken aback by Lin Xiu, and then subconsciously said aloud.

“I paid the money and you’re telling me this?” Lin Xiu said coldly.

“You…you can go down and get them to refund the money…” The doctor said with trembling lips.

Being stared at by Lin Xiu this way, it was as if he was stared at by a poisonous snake, a chill went down his spine.

Boom–

Lin Xiu grabbed his collar directly and lifted him up with one hand.

“Tell me, who made you do this.” Lin Xiu said faintly as he glared at him.

“The operation schedule is really full…” the doctor insisted.

But Lin Xiu didn’t want to talk too much nonsense with him. He picked him up with one hand like a chicken and brought him into the ward.

He pushed open the floor-to-ceiling window and dangled him outside!

“Brother Lin Xiu…” Ye Shuang’er was shocked when she saw this. If Lin Xiu threw the doctor down, he would definitely be held accountable!

Then Lin Xiu would be in big trouble!

The middle-aged woman was also frightened, and she didn’t expect Lin Xiu, who seemed to be kind just now, to throw people out the window if they didn’t agree with them.

“Don’t! Don’t ah!!!” The man was scared at this time, especially when he glanced down, it was even more frightening.

It was the 15th floor! Falling all the way down from here, even ordinary warriors will die, let alone an ordinary person like him!

He was still young, he didn’t want to die!

“Tell me, who told you that you can’t operate.” Lin Xiu continued.

At this time, the expression on the man’s face changed and he could hear his clothes tearing.

Takin ga closer look, it seemed that it was because Lin Xiu pulled his collar to lift him up in the air, his clothes can’t withstand the weight and were about to be torn off.

“I’ll tell you!” The man opened his eyes wide and said quickly.

Now he couldn’t care less and his life mattered more!

“Who?” Lin Xiu snorted coldly, then pulled his body back into the ward, loosened the hand that was pulling his collar, and asked.

He was so frightened by what happened just now and his legs seemed to be a little limp.

At this time, he was holding on to the wall next to him, and after panting for a while, he said to Lin Xiu in a trembling voice, “It was the vice president who said…I can’t do the operation for you…”

“Vice president?” Lin Xiu was taken aback and then frowned.

He certainly didn’t know this so-called vice-president, but why did he want this doctor to do this?

“Can you do it now?” However, Lin Xiu didn’t think much at this time, he narrowed his eyes at the man and asked.

“Yes! Yes!” The man said quickly after thinking of the horrible scene just now.
