Chapter 969: The Incomparably Powerful Lin Xiu

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

As Lin Xiu’s figure appeared on the other side, Lin Xiu’s words were passed on.

“Courting death!!!”

Huangfu Lin roared angrily.

Originally, he wanted to kill Lin Xiu directly, but he did not expect that he was teased by Lin Xiu instead.

“How did the weapon in his hand appear?”

At this time, Wu Hao stared at the weapon Lin Xiu was holding on the battlefield, his eyes were full of disbelief.

Just now, he clearly did not see that Lin Xiu had a weapon in his hand!

But this weapon appeared out of thin air in Lin Xiu’s hands.

This was unbelievable.

“We didn’t see it clearly either.”

The four Respected warrior-level warriors beside Wu Hao also shook their heads.

Just now, they really didn’t see how Lin Xiu appear with this weapon.

“This weapon is not simple.”

One of the warriors stared at the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand and said.

“Go together!”

At this time, Huangfu Tian saw that Huangfu Lin wanted to rush over to continue attacking Lin Xiu and said suddenly.

Because of the strength Lin Xiu showed just now, they don’t dare to be careless now.

Both of them are top warriors of Respected warrior and they are only one step away from reaching the level of Sage warrior.

As they got serious, Lin Xiu didn’t dare to relax at all.

This Divine Domain is truly quite powerful and it could actually train such young and powerful warriors.

But unfortunately, today, they are going to die here.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly. ,

With the release of the body’s source strength, it was transmitted to the Dark Edge spear and the entire Dark Edge spear seemed to tremble slightly.

And the body of the Dark Edge spear, those source marks inscribed with the ‘Essence of Fire’, lit up.

As the ‘Power’ source mark lit up, Lin Xiu’s body suddenly felt a powerful force over him.

Next was the ‘Speed’ source mark, which made Lin Xiu’s body feel lighter.

Watching them attack, the corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The Dark Edge spear held in his hand swung directly into the air!

boom boom boom —

As the Dark Edge spear swung, the ‘Flame’ source mark inscribed on the spear also lit up.

‘Awe of the phoenix’!

A flaming bird burst out from the spear in an instant!

And because of the power of the ‘Flame’ source mark, the power of these released flaming birds has become even stronger!

“Ah!!! It’s so hot!!!”

Those warriors who were watching the battle near the battle platform felt like their bodies were in a melting pot and let out a loud cry.

They kept retreating.

The air above the battle platform seemed to be distorted.

Huangfu Lin and Huangfu Tian originally wanted to attack Lin Xiu.

At this time, looking at the flaming bird coming toward them, their eyes were full of fear.

The scorching temperature made them feel like their skin was about to melt away.

There was no way. At this time, they stopped attacking and dodged directly.

They wanted to dodge the attacks of those flaming birds.

But what frightened them was that these flaming birds would track them and continued to pursue them.

boom boom boom —

And as Lin Xiu kept waving the Dark Edge spear in his hand, more and more flaming birds appeared in the air.

These flaming birds were constantly flying, charging towards the two of them!

“‘Sphere’!!!”

Finally, they felt that they couldn’t get rid of the attacks of those flaming birds. They roared and unfolded their ‘Sphere’.

boom boom boom —

Those flaming birds directly hit their ‘Sphere’.

Fortunately, they were the top powerhouses of Respected warrior. Although the temperature of these flaming birds was terrifyingly powerful, they still haven’t melted their “Spheres”.

“Huh? Not bad.”

Lin Xiu looked at this scene and said lightly.

As the flaming birds disappeared, they slowly heaved a sigh of relief.

Looking at Lin Xiu who was not far away, they couldn’t help but have a hint of fear.

“Master is so strong…”

Wang Qiang, who was under the battlefield, clenched his hands with excitement when he saw this scene.

He originally wanted to learn ‘Awe of the phoenix’, but for him, this skill was too difficult.

Because he had to have a strong resistance to flames.

Otherwise, before the released flames could attack others, he wouldn’t be able to stand it anymore.

“This kid, what kind of skill are you using…”

Seeing the skills released by Lin Xiu, Wu Hao also had sweat dripping down his forehead.

The stronger the flame-type skill, the stronger the warrior’s resistance to flames.

When cultivating, the pain he endured was very powerful.

As for Lin Xiu, in addition to the flames, the skills that Lin Xiu displayed also included ice, snow and lightning.

Then it means that Lin Xiu has extremely high resistance to flames, ice and snow and lightning.

He’s almost like a humanoid tank.

Perverted…

Wu Hao couldn’t help but cursed inwardly.

How much pain did he have to endure to cultivate his physical strength to this level?

He couldn’t imagine.

“I have to admit that you do have some strength.”

Huangfu Tian looked at Lin Xiu over there and said aloud.

“But this kind of large-scale skill, I don’t think you can use it all the time. Next, you have to…”

“Die!”

He roared angrily, held the sword and continued to charge in Lin Xiu’s direction!

In his opinion, the ‘Awe of the phoenix’ skill used by Lin Xiu already belongs to a large-scale skill.

Although this large-scale skill is powerful, it also consumes a lot of energy for the warrior.

Lin Xiu rashly used such a skill and did not kill them. It was definitely a good situation for them.

“Humph!”

Huangfu Lin also snorted coldly at this time and continued to attack Lin Xiu.

When the two human body skills were displayed, it was as if there were phantoms.

Dang dang-

Lin Xiu raised his brows, watching the cold light flashing in front of him, the spear in his hand also waved directly!

The ‘source mark’ on the Dark Edge spear has been activated because of the transmission of his source strength.

Every strike of Lin Xiu was filled with extreme power.

And the body has become more agile.

Whoosh whoosh—

And because of the attribute influence brought by the warrior title, Lin Xiu’s attack was an attack with the wind attribute!

At the same time that Huangfu Lin, Huangfu Tian and Lin Xiu were fighting, they felt a wave of wind blades coming.

There were also many wounds on their arms and cheeks.

Although the wound was not big, there was blood flowing out.

For them, the situation is very unfavorable.

At this time, as the battle continued, not only was Lin Xiu’s source strength not reduced, but because of the power brought by the title of warrior, he was constantly absorbing some of their lost source strength.

At the next moment, after the Rage on the system interface was full, Lin Xiu clenched the spear in both hands.

Power-up… strike!!!
