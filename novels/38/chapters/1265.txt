1266 Burning Life Force

“He burned his own life force with a secret method.”

At this moment, Baili Haoling clenched the two swords in her hands and spoke seriously.

Now her eyes were also full of vigilance.

This Liu Mo, was now crazy, he even burned his own life force just to kill them.

“Is it do or die now?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

His own ‘Purification Domain’ did not cover his domain, so it is very likely that his current strength was much stronger than Lin Xiu’s.

That’s why his own domain couldn’t cover his domain.

And now Liu Mo had burned his own life force to obtain such a powerful force.

For Lin Xiu, this was indeed quite troublesome…

Crackling——

And at this moment, the entire sky seemed to be covered by Liu Mo’s domain force.

A large number of black lightning appeared around, making strange noises continuously.

At this time, Liu Mo was staring at Lin Xiu’s figure not far away. With a wave of his right hand, the blood-red long sword flew up from the ground.

While flying up, hundreds of long swords appeared.

He stabbed directly at Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling in the sky.

Dangdangdang——

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

Her body skills started to work and she quickly dodged.

And Baili Haoling has already unfolded her ‘Sphere’ and with the constant dancing of the two swords in her hands, the blood-red sword that was thrusting up was constantly blocked.

Rollie also flew over from the other side, dancing wildly with the shining warhammer.

Helping Baili Haoling knock away the blood-red long sword stabbing up from below.

And Lin Xiu, who dodged to the other side, was about to make a move when he realized that Liu Mo had already rushed in front of him at some point!

So fast!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly and he realized that Liu Mo had threw a punch! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Lin Xiu’s reaction speed was not slow at all and he punched back directly.

The fists of the two collided together and there was a “crackling” sound.

Because Lin Xiu is using ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’, of course there was extremely terrifying lightning on the fist.

And Liu Mo’s fist also has lightning, but his lightning is different from ordinary lightning, it is black.

This kind of black lightning quickly spread to Lin Xiu’s entire body as the fists of the two collided.

Pain, a tingling sensation that surrounds the whole body hits instantly.

Originally, if it was the normal power of lightning, even the more terrifying power of lightning, Lin Xiu would have the means to resist it.

But this power of lightning is obviously extraordinary.

It has a sinister feeling.

What shocked Lin Xiu, even more, was that the lightning made his body feel a little numb.

At this time, the ferocious Liu Mo punched him again.

He hit Lin Xiu’s head directly!

boom–

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s head exploded.

“Hm?”

Liu Mo clearly knew that the ‘Lin Xiu’ whose head was blown up by him was a fake.

He glanced around with his pitch-black eyes and found that there were four Lin Xius around him!

“Cloning skill?”

Liu Mo sneered when he saw this scene.

As soon as he triggered his mind, a large amount of black lightning burst out in his domain space.

These black lightning bolts rushed toward Lin Xiu’s avatars like whips.

Although Lin Xiu’s reaction speed was very fast, the speed of these whip-like black lightning was really too fast.

Lin Xiu’s body was soon entangled by these black lightning bolts!

Only one of the avatars was still dodging the impacting black lightning.

“This is the real one.”

Liu Mo grinned grimly and he started to move, like phantoms, quickly moving toward Lin Xiu’s real body.

Damn, what the hell are these!?

Lin Xiu looked at the whip-like black lightning that appeared in all directions and the expression on his face became ugly.

“Go to hell!”

...

Just when Lin Xiu dodged a streak of black lightning, Liu Mo’s figure appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

His right hand with the extremely terrifying black lightning directly blasted toward Lin Xiu’s head!

Lin Xiu’s body was a little paralyzed by the black lightning.

At this time, there was no way to dodge!

This punch was about to hit Lin Xiu’s head!

“Lin Xiu!”

Not far away, Baili Haoling just finished dodging the impact of those blood-red long sword’s attacks, raised her eyes to look forward, and saw this horrifying scene.

She could feel that Liu Mo’s punch was very powerful.

If Liu Mo’s punch hits the head, Lin Xiu’s whole head will be blown off!

Baili Haoling wanted to help, but it was too late!

boom–

...

At the same time Liu Mo’s punch hit Lin Xiu’s body, Lin Xiu’s body suddenly burst into dazzling golden light!

what is this!?

Seeing the golden light, even Baili Haoling’s pupils shrank slightly.

The golden light was so dazzling that Liu Mo’s eyes narrowed slightly.

But his punch still hit Lin Xiu’s head for real.

But he found that Lin Xiu’s head suddenly became like an extremely hard object and there was no way to smash it!

Boom–

And at this moment, he felt his arm being grabbed by Lin Xiu’s hand!

Boom——

A dark blue flame burst out from the right hand that grabbed Liu Mo.

The hellfire was already very terrifying. At this time, Liu Mo felt as if his arm was going to be melted away!

“what!”

At this moment, Liu Mo let out a scream.

His whole arm was torn apart with Lin Xiu’s forceful pull.

But at this moment, Liu Mo kicked Lin Xiu’s chest with his right foot and sent Lin Xiu flying.

Lin Xiu’s body flew out and hit the invisible barrier behind Liu Mo’s domain.

Poof——

The powerful force made Lin Xiu feel a sharp pain in his chest and he spit out a mouthful of blood.

Originally, he wanted to use the Divine Soul Power, but using the Divine Soul Power all the time consumes too much energy for the body, so Lin Xiu has to stop using it for now.

Lin Xiuxiu, who hit the invisible barrier, wanted to move but found that there was a lot of black lightning entwined around his body.

These black electric currents were like ropes, binding his body tightly.

The current Lin Xiu didn’t have any power to fight back!
