1337 Taking the God’s Blood

What was that?

Lin Xiu held onto the wooden box with his left hand and it felt as if the box continued sinking to the ground.

“Metal of a thousand years old along with God’s blood.”

“As for the other reward where you get to pick three cards, we will have to wait for Yuan Zheng and Xiao Qingchen. I will then bring all three of you together.”

!!

Riyan God Lord showed a gentle smile.

Lin Xiu nodded his head in return.

“Can I open it now to take a look at it?”

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment before asking.

“Sure.”

Riyan God Lord still had the same smile on his face.

There was an admiring look in his eyes as he looked at Lin Xiu.

The time that Lin Xiu had taken to climb up the stairs was much shorter than he anticipated and he was surprised by that.

After all, the Stairs of Trial was one that would put a lot of pressure on the warriors.

Other than having a strong body, the warriors would also need a firm mind to be able to complete the Stairs of Trials.

One slight hesitation would send the warrior flying.

This was enough to prove that not only was Lin Xiu a powerful man, he also had a determined mind.

Lin Xiu was now focused on the wooden box that was incredibly heavy.

As he opened it, there was a bright silver light that shone into his eyes.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes. As he took a good look at it, there was a square piece of metal inside the box.

The piece of metal wasn’t large but it definitely weighed closed to a few million kilos!

This was definitely something extraordinary.

Lin Xiu looked at the metal and he was delighted.

He already got his hands on one of the ingredients needed for Dark Edge. Only ‘Spirit Fire Energy Stone’ and ‘The Root of Frost’ were left and he would be able to find more about it later on.

As for the odd crystal of a thousand year old beast god, it was something fairly easy to get.

It was at least something that he could buy with money.

As he controlled it with his mind, Lin Xiu then placed it inside his expansion space.

Riyan God Lord, who witnessed the whole scene, was shocked as well.

Perhaps… this kid has something like an inventory?

It has to be noted that such thing were extremely rare in the Warrior God Realm.

Even he didn’t have one!

“This is the God’s Blood.”

Riyan God Lord reminded Lin Xiu of it when he saw him opening the other wooden box.

As Lin Xiu opened it, there was a small bottle that was filled with golden fluid.

Although the fluid was inside the bottle, Lin Xiu could still clearly feel the horrifying movements of the energy coming from it.

Such powerful energy!

This is the blood taken from a beast god. After taking it, your strength would definitely increase tremendously.”

Riyan God Lord explained it to Lin Xiu.

“Can I use it now?”

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate and asked for permission instead.

This was because according to what Riyan God Lord had said, they still had to wait for Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

They would only be able to pick out the warriors skills cards when they got here.

Then, for the time being, he would be able to consume God’s Blood first.

“Umm….sure.”

Riyan God Lord thought about it before nodding his head.

“Then, I shall cultivate here as well.”

Lin Xiu did not put in much thought. He sat cross-legged on the ground and opened the bottle.

As soon as the bottle was twisted open, Lin Xiu could feel the energy coming from the fluid inside.

The strength of God’s Blood was incredibly powerful!

The difference between a warrior god and god king was indeed tremendous!

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and finished the golden fluid that was inside the bottle!

As the golden fluid entered his body, Lin Xiu could feel the bitterness that came from it and the weird, sweet aftertaste that it had.

The fluid travelled through his throat and into his stomach.

That’s when he could feel a warm feeling coming from it.

“Start cultivating!”

...

Ruyan God Lord quickly reminded Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu didn’t dare to hesitate and instantly activated the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

As the ‘Cultivation Technique’ was activated, every inch of his body started absorbing the energy that came from the fluid.

His stomach was burning.

It felt as if there was a huge flame that started inside his stomach.

At the same time, the feeling of getting burnt slowly spread from his stomach and to the rest of his body.

Lin Xiu felt as if his entire body was now on fire!

He clenched his jaw and continued using the ‘Cultivation technique’ to absorb all of the energy from it.

The energy was indeed overpowering and Lin Xiu’s body started trembling as well.

Most of the muscles and blood were getting slowly destroyed by the energy that entered his body.

As it was getting destroyed, they were healed instantly as well.

...

It was a process that repeated continuously.

All of his meridian, flesh and bloods that have been destroyed and healed were now much tougher than before.

If one looked carefully, they would be able to see that Lin Xiu’s body seemed to have turned golden.

“Huuuuuu…”

At the same time, Xiao Qingchen arrived to the top and he was trying to catch his breath.

The Stairs of Trials was hell. He has never experienced such things and when he took the first time, he had been thrown far into the distance.

“Two minutes. That’s good.”

Riyan God Lord commented on it when he saw that it was Xiao Qingchen.

“Greetings, Riyan God Lord.”

Xiao Qingchen noticed that it was Riyan God Lord and quickly greeted him.

Riyan God Lord was someone famous and no one knew how powerful he actually was. This was why he has been known to be the only person beneath the God King.

Even when Xiao Qingchen was an arrogant man, he was still respectful toward the Riyan God Lord.

Xiao Qingchen then saw that Lin Xiu was sitting on the ground and he was glowing brightly in a golden light. He was shocked to see Lin Xiu here.

This kid got up here so quickly?

At the same time, Xiao Qingchen could also feel that there was an intense energy coming from Lin Xiu’s body.

This kid seemed to have taken something and he was busy cultivating.

“He just took the God’s Blood and he is cultivating now.”

Riyan God Lord answered his question. Then, he waved his left hand and gave a black wooden box to Xiao Qingchen.

“This is your reward. As for the two god-level warrior skills cards, you will be able to get them once Yuan Zheng gets here.”

Xiao Qingchen nodded his head.

However, his attention was on Lin Xiu. Even when he had a reward in his hands, he wasn’t in a rush to open it.

“There is only one bottle of God’s Blood.”

Riyan God King stared at Xiao Qingchen and smiled as he gently stroked his beard.

Xiao Qingchen blushed. He thought about it for some time before asking, “Do I still have another chance in the future?”

The God Blood was a priceless treasure!

It even helps to strengthen a warrior’s flesh and bone.

“There would definitely be lots of chances.”

Riyan God Lord spoke calmly.
