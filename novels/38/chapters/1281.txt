1282 Idiots That Come In Pairs

Lei Chong’s eyes shuddered when he saw what was happening.

He was a saint warrior. Both of them disappeared before his eyes and he couldn’t even catch up with them.

Baili Haoling held onto her daggers on both hands and instantly chopped those men into pieces.

“I’ll do it.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes. Then, he placed the wooden box on the ground.

As Lin Xiu’s body shifted, he instantly disappeared into thin air.

Boom boom – –

Then, right at that moment, Lei Chong heard a soft groan. There were two black figures that fell onto the ground.

“Oof….it hurts.”

Xiao Jian and Xiao Ren soon appeared before them.

Both laid on the ground with their bodies curled up like a cooked prawn.

That’s it?

Baili Haoling’s eyes were wide open. She didn’t think that it would all be settled so quickly.

“Are you still going to borrow our energy stone?”

Lin Xiu looked at the rest of them and asked in a calm manner.

“No No!!!”

Xiao Jian and Xiao Ren were groaning and quickly answered without any hesitation.

After hearing what they said, Lin Xiu was a little surprised.

He didn’t think that these two would give up so easily.

Were…these two idiots?

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu was feeling a little speechless.

Initially, he thought that they might have encountered some evil spawns but he didn’t think that it was merely two idiots.

Lei Chong and Baili Haoling nodded their heads in agreement.

Especially for Baili Haoling as she looked a little disappointed.

She had just pulled out her daggers and now she had to return them into the scabbard.

“Wait! Don’t go!!”

Before Lin Xiu and the rest could leave, Xiao Jian suddenly jumped on his feet and screamed.

“Hmm?”

Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows and turned around to face the men.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was sizing him up, the man shivered subconsciously.

Lin Xiu had shown powerful skills earlier and he knew that he wouldn’t be able to defeat Lin Xiu.

“I have information on who is coming after you!”

Xiao Jian suddenly spoke up.

“That’s right! We know who has their eyes on you!”

Xiao Ren clenched his jaw as well due to the pain that he felt as he got on his feet.

“Ohhhhh…”

Then, Lin Xiu turned and left.

“Wait…..listen to us!”

“Don’t you want to know who they are?”

Xiao Jian and Xiao Ren asked in unison.

Their eyes were opened wide and this was the first time that they have seen such a stubborn man.

“No, I don’t.”

Lin Xiu gave a short reply.

Both of them were shocked to hear what Lin Xiu had said.

“You have been marked by those from the Black Demons!”

Xiao Ren couldn’t help but slip the information.

“Shut up!”

Xiao Jian glared at Xiao Ren.

“If you told them about the Black Demon now, wouldn’t you be doing it for free?!”

“They would have to give us at least a million energy stones before telling them who it is!”

Xiao Ren quickly nodded his head when he heard what Xiao Jian said.

“That’s right! You have to give us a million energy stones in order for us to tell you more!”

Both of them seemed to have forgotten about the pain that they were feeling as they spoke to Lin Xiu.

...

Lin Xiu was sure that these two were definitely idiots.

“What’s Black Demons?”

Baili Haoling was now feeling a little curious.

“You knew those from the Black Demons were watching you?”

Xiao Jian was a little stunned.

“Idiot!! You’re the one who told them about it!”

Xiao Ren gave a hard slap onto Xiao Jian’s head.

“You….you guys are really warrior gods?”

Lei Chong couldn’t help but ask.

He was now a saint warrior now but he could feel that these two were much more powerful than he was.

Even when both of them were taught a hard lesson by Lin Xiu.

...

“Of course!:

Xiao Jian and Xiao Ren instantly felt prideful after hearing Lei Chong’s question.

That’s right. They were warrior gods!

“What’s Black Demons?”

Lin Xiu was starting to get a little curious with what they were saying.

“Hehe….would you like to know more about it?”

Xiao Jian smiled at Lin Xiu.

“You only have to give us a million energy stones in exchange for it!”

Xiao Ren was still thinking about the energy stones.

Lin Xiu turned speechless. These two were warrior gods and it wouldn’t be too difficult for them to get a million energy stones.

However, Lin Xiu didn’t give too much thought about it. He narrowed his eyes and then swiftly appeared before Lin Xiu.

“You…” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Xiao Jian was a little stunned as he didn’t know what to say when Lin Xiu suddenly grabbed him by the collar.

He was instantly lifted from the ground.

“Do you still want it now?”

Lin Xiu asked him again in a cold tone.

Then, he instantly released the energy that was inside his body.

The horrifying energy travelled across Xiao Jian’s body and there was a cold feeling that ran through his body.

His entire body shook and there was fear in his eyes.

“No! I don’t want them anymore!!!”

Xiao Jian instantly gave up on it.

“What rubbish!”

Xiao Ren started getting a little agitated.

“Would you like to try it then?”

Lin Xiu looked at Xiao Ren before asking.

With his analytic eye, Lin Xiu could easily figure out the strength of these two men.

Although they were warrior gods, their abilities were far from Lin Xiu.

They wouldn’t be a threat to him.

“I….I don’t want to!”

Xiao Ren, who initially looked like a barbarian, took a few steps backwards when he noticed that Lin Xiu was looking at him.

“Well, tell me more about the Black Demons.”

Lin Xiu quickly told Xiao Jian.

“It’s…..it’s an organisation!”

Xiao Jian quickly answered.

Although Xiao Jian did not suffer any injuries when Lin Xiu caught his collar, looking into Lin Xiu’s eyes was enough to show him the deadly look in it.

Xiao Jian didn’t dare to play any more tricks and quickly answered him.

“Why are they coming after us?!”

Lin Xiu continued asking.

“Newbies! You are new to town and aren’t that powerful. They loved going after people like you…”

Xiao Jian glanced at Lin Xiu as he spoke.

They thought that Lin Xiu was a weak man which was why they thought of bullying him.

But, they didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be able to defeat them in seconds.

“Is that so…?”

Lin Xiu recalled what had happened earlier in the hotel. Perhaps those people were the Black Demons that they were refering to?
