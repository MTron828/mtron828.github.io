Chapter 87: Instant Kill

It stared at Baili Haoling with its bloodshot eyes. Its tail was cut off.

“Seems delicious.” Baili Haoling held onto his dual sabers and approached slowly.

Lin Xiu squinted his eyes and activated Analytic Eye as he looked at Baili Haoling’s back.

[Unable to Analyze]

The notification in his head stunned him. ‘Unable to analyze? What’s going on?’

‘Could he be… above rank 3?’ Upon thinking about this, Lin Xiu could not help but inhale a breath of cold air. ‘Impossible…’

‘To actually encounter such a powerful person who is almost the same age as me upon coming out!’

At this moment, Baili Haoling seemed to have changed into a completely different person. He snorted and charged forward with his sabers!

“Autumn Frost Slice” Baili Haoling spoke up indifferently. In the next second, his entire being flickered like a shadow and he unleashed multiple cold auras from the darkness.

“Roar!” The Blood-eyed Lone Wolf roared with the intent of attacking Baili Haoling, but it was unable to find his figure.

Baili Haoling suddenly appeared behind the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf with blood all over his sabers.

Bang bang bang-

Loud and clear sounds echoed as the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf’s body exploded.

“How boring.” Baili Haoling swung his sabers as shrugged the blood off before sheathing them.

An instant kill with a light chuckle.

Lei Liang and the others had their mouths wide open as though they were fools.

This was not any ordinary animal but a rank 3 evolved beast, the extremely ferocious Blood-eyed Lone Wolf!

Lin Xiu squinted his eyes, he knew why Baili Haoling was able to instantly kill the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf – Baili Haoling seemed to have imbued a large amount of source strength into the sabers and the remaining source strength into his feet.

With the extreme speed and sharp sabers, he sliced the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf as though it was tofu.

A real expert!

“Brave, Little Brother!” Lei Liang and the others laughed out loud as they sat by the fire and barbequed their fish. They looked at Lin Xiu then back at Baili Haoling and handed two fishes over as they sang praises.

“Come, have your fill. If not for you guys, we would have been finished.”

But Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling did not move an inch.

“What’s wrong with you guys?” Lei Liang looked at the duo and was slightly startled.

“Huh, you sensed it too?” Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu curiously and asked.

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“What’s up with the two of you? Why don’t you guys take the fish, are you afraid I put poison in them!” Lei Liang asked in anger.

As though he was being accused.

“Not you, them.” Lin Xiu pointed to Zhang Zhimin and the others.

Zhang Zhimin and the others were stunned when they heard Lin Xiu’s words and frowned. They stared at Lin Xiu, “What do you mean by that!?”

“Dogs biting the hands of immortals, you guys can’t even recognize kind intentions.” Lei Liang snorted.

“You guys drugged the fishes,” Lin Xiu replied indifferently.

Although they had attempted to cover it up, Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling did not loosen their guard even after facing the Blood-eyed Lone Wolf.

“Axylin, a colorless and odorless liquid. With just a few drops, it can make a rank 3 warrior lose his strength.” Baili Haoling chuckled and explained.

“It’s said that this can only be found in black markets and is rather expensive. Who would have thought that you guys have some capital!”

Upon hearing Baili Haoling’s words, their faces turned ugly.

“That’s right, we did it.” Zhang Zhimin stood up and held his weapon tightly.

Although they were not strong, they always relied on this method to steal other warrior’s weapons, crystals, union coins, and other things.

Who would have thought that someone would see through this?

Lei Liang and the others quickly picked up their weapons and became on guard against the two young men.

No, they were more cautious of Baili Haoling. He had just killed a rank 3 Blood-eyed Lone Wolf

without breaking a sweat. To him, dealing with them was as easy as killing an ant.

They still harbored wishful thinking to steal everything on Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling, but now, they were covered in cold sweats.

“If you want to kill us, we will risk our lives to fight it out with you,” Zhang Zhimin gritted his teeth and said.

“No, I don’t want to kill anyone today,” Baili Haoling shook his head and replied.

They were stunned when they heard his reply.

“I’ll give you three seconds, disappear from my sight forever.” Baili Haoling added indifferently.

His tone was filled with killing intent that sent shivers down their spines as though they had plunged into some ice chamber.

But they were smart enough to turn and run.

“The hateful people have finally left.” Baili Haoling stretched and said.

He was truly too good looking, along with his flawless skin and oval face. Lin Xiu was even able to catch a whiff of fragrance from him.

‘Pei pei pei, I’m not gay!’

Lin Xiu immediately felt disgusted thinking about this and distanced himself.

“Hey, I thought your moves were good, but why is your aura so weak? Did you use some technique to suppress your aura?” Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu curiously and asked.

A drop of perspiration trickled down Lin Xiu’s forehead when he heard that. ‘His observational skill is too good.’

“It’s fine if you don’t want to say it.” Baili Haoling pouted and added.

He then raised his head and tapped his lips with a finger as though he was thinking about something. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“You’re a rank 3 warrior?” Lin Xiu thought for a moment before asking.

“What do you think?” Baili Haoling turned and returned a question with interest.

He seemed extremely excited to know more about Lin Xiu.

‘Roughly 17 years old and holds powerful observation skills and insight, he also has a way of hiding his strength.’

‘But he is too weak now, like a diamond in the rough that hasn’t been completely revealed.’

“You should be…” Lin Xiu trembled when he saw Baili Haoling staring at him and gulped down secretly.

‘Is he really gay…’
