Chapter 602: Luo Yue’s Heart

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu had heard of this college in high school before, and it was a very good college.

Moreover, the strength of the warriors of this school seemed to be very strong.

“However, no matter how strong the academy is, it will be defeated by me.”

Lin Xiu mumbled to himself and his words were full of confidence.

“I shall rest first.”

Lin Xiu stretched, and then lay directly on the bed.

At the same time, in the Luo family mansion in Sky City.

Luo Yue was still cultivating her own swordsmanship as if she was bored.

It seemed that nothing could affect her mind.

However, she seemed to hear a sound at this time, which made her pretty brows slightly frown.

Shee continued to swing the long sword, but in the next moment, the long sword in her hand suddenly stopped, then she walked over to the front, and picked up her mobile phone on the table.

She seemed to see something, and there was a slightly surprised look in her eyes.

Turning on the phone, Luo Yue was stunned when she saw the message sent by Lin Xiu.

There seemed to be a faint smile on the originally expressionless face.

Kacha-

At this moment, a slight sound came over, and Luo Yue’s expression instantly changed back to her icy look, then she turned to look to the side, and saw her sister Luo Yan, who was holding a miniature camera taking pictures of Luo Yue.

“Haha, it’s the first time I saw you smiling, tsk tsk, who is it?”

Luo Yan said a little curiously at this time.

Luo Yue didn’t know what to do with Luo Yan, she glared at her at this moment, and then walked out directly.

“Hm... I’m really curious, this icy little sister seems to have melted...” Luo Yan was sitting at the table in front at this time, holding her chin and looking at the photo of Luo Yue she just captured.

Soon, it was the morning of the next day. After Lin Xiu finished taking a shower, he went out.

“Morning.”

As soon as Lin Xiu walked out the door, he found that Ouyang Hang and others were already in the hall.

Everyone was holding weapons and wearing special battle suits made by the Sanctuary Academy, with the Sacred Region Academy printed on the back.

At this moment, Baili Haoling got an ice cream, and she was eating it with relish, causing Lin Xiu to have black lines all over his head.

She really looked like a little girl who just started high school...

However, Lin Xiu knew that her true age must be older than him.

Lin Xiu was also very curious about this.

But as the saying goes, age is a woman’s biggest secret, and Lin Xiu didn’t ask such a question directly at this time.

“I checked. Today we are fighting against Changjia College, and the audition is based on a points system.”

Huang Zhen looked at Lin Xiu as he came over, and then said to the crowd.

This was to avoid strong and powerful teams meeting immediately for the first match.

“We have secured the first place for sure.”

Ouyang Hang also looked very confident at this time.

“Well, let’s go.” Lin Xiu said with a smile.

Leaving the hotel here, Lin Xiu and the others soon arrived at the audition venue again. Compared with the lively scene during the registration yesterday, it became livelier today.

A large number of warriors wearing distinctive academy uniforms were going in and out.

“It’s almost time, we are here.”

Lin Xiu looked around, then pointed to the front and said.

In this wide space, 100 platforms were opened for competition.

The combat mechanism was a points system. Every time you win a game, you will get one point. If you lose, you will not have points deducted. However, if you lose more than three times, you will be eliminated. Once you accumulate six points, that is, if you win six times, you will be able to leave from the audition.

“Next, it’s the Sacred Region Academy against Changjia College!”

Hearing the referee’s voice at this time, Lin Xiu and the others looked at each other, and then they all jumped directly onto the competition stage.

The competition platform covered a large area and was built with special stone materials. Even if powerful skills were used, it would not cause a collapse.

A large number of warriors were watching around.

“Sacred Region Academy? What college is this?”

At this time, some people said curiously after seeing Lin Xiu and the others standing on the competition stage.

The Sacred Region Academy was the most powerful academy hidden in China. There were relatively few people who knew about it, and it would not appear in general materials.

Otherwise, when Lin Xiu first heard about the Sacred Region Academy, he wouldn’t have felt a little confused.

“God knows what kind of lousy academy it is, the opponent is Changjia Academy, they are sure to lose!”

“And you see, these people still have a little girl with them. I’m dying of laughter, don’t tell me they couldn’t find anyone else?”

“Hey, come down quickly, just admit defeat, don’t waste your time!”

When Lin Xiu heard these people’s words, he couldn’t help but look at Baili Haoling with black lines all over his head. Indeed, she was still the same as when he first met her, but she was dressed in normal women’s clothes.

Now that she has grown a lot taller, she was still like a 15 or 16 year old girl.

“Coming.”

It was the first time Ouyang Hang participated in the World Warrior Conference. Even though it was an audition, he still took it seriously.

At this time, looking at the opposite side, the people from Changjia Academy also jumped up onto the competition platform.

“Oh? It’s you guys...”

When one of the men saw Lin Xiu and the others, he immediately showed a sneer.

Taking a closer look, isn’t this Zhao Qian who wanted the Ice Crystal White Bird yesterday?

“It turned out to be these people, how boring.”

One of the women in their team looked at Lin Xiu and the others, and shook her head, looking disdainful.

Because Lin Xiu and the others were not students of any famous university at all, they all subconsciously thought that the so-called ‘Sacred Region Academy’ was just a third-rate academy.

Also, Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling looked a little too young.

So young, how powerful could they be?

“After the two sides have arrived, put the entry card in the machine in the corner.”

The referee looked at Lin Xiu and the others, as well as the contestants from the Changjia Academy opposite, and said aloud.

Lin Xiu nodded, and then, according to his request, at the next moment, he placed the entry card he obtained on a machine that looked like a black pillar at the corner of the competition platform.

As soon as the entry card was put in, a red light scanned Lin Xiu, and then a robotic sound came out: The scan is completed. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“If one side admits defeat or gets knocked out, it counts as a failure.”

“If there is no problem, then.... let’s start!”
