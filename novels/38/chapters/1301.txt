1302 Eliminating Huangfu Gu

The little black dragon followed Lin Xiu’s attack and went straight for the cows!

Divine Spirits were like an energy force where one could land a punch on its body.

As Lin Xiu’s fist landed on the huge cows, there was a huge explosion that followed.

Both the cows were instantly shocked from the attack.

!!

As for the little black dragon, its mouth was now wide and it started biting on the cows.

Soon, there was already a small tear on the cows that were formed by energy particles.

The little black dragon then continued biting on the cows when it saw the tear!

“Ahhhhhhh!!!!”

These divine spirits were connected to Huangfu Gu spiritually. When his divine spirits were being bitten, he would feel an intense pain as well.

Huangfu Gu held onto his head as he stared at one of his cows.

This was because he had witnessed his divine spirit being eaten by the little black dragon!

“Noooooo!!!!!”

Seeing what had happened to his cow, he had lost his mind!

What on earth was that?! How could it bite his divine spirit?!

When the other cow turned to attack Lin Xiu, he quickly released his ‘sphere’.

Boom – –

As the huge cow landed on the ‘sphere’, there was a loud sound that came from the impact.

Lin Xiu’s body slightly trembled from the impact but it was impossible for this cow to break Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’.

This was because Huang Fulin’s other divine spirit was under attack and he was in pain. He would not be able to control the other cow.

This was an opportunity for Lin Xiu!

Xiu – –

Then, he quickly appeared before Huangfu Gu!

His fist was now covered with flames.

These were not pure dark blue Hellfire, instead, there was a slight golden glow to it.

‘Fire Devours the Sky’!

This was something new that Lin Xiu learnt and it was the first time that he was using it in battles.

“Leave!”

Seeing what was happening, Huangfu Gu roared in rage. He quickly pulled out his spear and targeted it at Lin Xiu’s fist!

Clang – –

Lin Xiu’s fist collided with the tip of the sword.

However, the sword did not pierce through Lin Xiu’s fist but instead, it started bending.

Lin Xiu’s right fist was still headed for Huangfu Gu!

Huangfu Gu had no other choice but to take a step backwards to dodge the attack.

However, Lin Xiu did not stop there and continued his attack.

‘Sonic Star’!

As both his fist were moving around quickly, there were a thousand fists that appeared in the air.

Hunag Fugu quickly released his ‘sphere’ to defend himself.

However, Lin Xiu’s attacks were too scary.

There were countless attacks that came from the pair of fists that were covered in flames.

Boom – –

All of it landed on its ‘sphere’ and there were even explosions that occurred.

Due to how Lin Xiu’s fists were covered with terrifying flames, it caused Huangfu Gu’s ‘sphere’ to turn slightly twisted.

Huangfu Gu’s face looked incredibly horrid and he wanted to attack Lin Xiu once again with his divine spirit.

However, he could no longer do that because the little black dragon was eating away his cow.

He could feel an intense pain in his head and he didn’t have the strength to do so.

He didn’t even have the chance to attack and he was only left with defence.

Lin Xiu let out a cold laugh.

Huangfu Gu was indeed powerful and along with how he had the ‘God’s descend’, he became even more powerful. Lin Xiu had no other choice but to activate ‘Rage’.

However, when he used his divine spirit, Lin Xiu knew that he finally got his chance.

His little black dragon had the ability to engulf the divine energy of the other party!

Plus, his conscience was connected to his divine spirit. Once his divine spirit got injured, Huang Dugu would feel intense pain as well.

In such a situation, Huangfu Gu wouldn’t have the chance to fight against him!

“You’re dead!”

This time, it was Lin Xiu who roared.

...

He had released all of the energy that he had in him!

‘Destroy the Sky’!!!!

Lin Xiu used all of the energy in his body to release this skill.

This time, he had to kill Haung Fugu!

Huangfu Gu narrowed his pupils and he wanted to dodge the attack.

Boom – –

However, at the same time, the little black dragon swallowed one of the cows into its stomach.

Huangfu Gu then felt a sharp pain that went through his entire body.

The other cow quickly turned red and it wanted to return to Huangfu Gu’s body.

But….he was quickly stopped by the little black dragon.

Its mouth was opened wide and it completely engulfed the red energy!

...

Pfft – –

This time, Huangfu Gu felt as if there was an explosion in his head.

The sharp pain caused him to spat out a mouthful of blood.

Then, Lin Xiu’s fists that were filled with energy headed his way!

Boom – –

The fist landed on his ‘sphere’ and there was another loud explosion.

His ‘sphere’ instantly blasted from the attack.

The fist was still coming at him!

“I admit…”

Huangfu Gu’s eyes were opened wide. Just as he was about to spear, Lin Xiu’s fist went through his chest!

Plus, at the same time, Lin Xiu swung his other hand and it landed straight on Huangfu Gu’s head.

As his head exploded from the blast, there was a golden glow that left his body and it wanted to run.

“Trying to run?!”

Lin Xiu let out a cold laugh when he saw what happened. His body flew into the air and with his mouth opened, he engulfed the golden energy into his body!

As the golden ball of energy was absorbed by Lin Xiu, he could feel that the energy that he had exhausted earlier was slowly getting replenished.

It felt comforting!

“This…”

Wan Gan, who was at this seat, was left completely dumbfounded.

Huangfu Gu had lost. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

With the God’s Descend, Haung Fugu still lost and he even lost his head.

He had died a terrible death.

Where did this young man come from?!

Not only Wan Gan, even Zhang Qinghua was in shock.

The tables turned so quickly that it was out of his expectations.

“Looks like there is a new god king.”

Riyan calmly gave his comment.
