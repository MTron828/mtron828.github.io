Chapter 711 Liu Shen

“Sphere’!”

Seeing the flaming bird released by Lin Xiu, Chen An’s expression changed suddenly and he and the rest of the warriors unfolded their ‘Sphere’ at the same time.

Boom

But the power of this flaming bird is really terrifying

When a warrior of Lin Xiu’s level uses it, the power is not comparable to that of ordinary skill.

And this flame is the flame of the red lotus fire and the flame is accompanied by lightning properties.

The flaming bird directly hit their ‘Sphere’ and these warriors felt a strong burning sensation.

At the next moment, the ‘Sphere’ they unfolded seemed to be melted away by the burning

And their entire being was burned together.

Liu Yanran looked at this scene and the expression in her eyes seemed to become dull.

The flames just now actually burned Chen An and the others to the point where there was no slag left.

They had unfolded a ‘Sphere’! No matter how bad it was, it wouldn’t be so easily burned like this.

And just like this, Lin Xiu was already standing in front of Liu Yanran.

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand with the spearhead of the spear approaching Liu Yanran.

When Liu Yanran saw Lin Xiu’s actions, a look of fear appeared on her face.

Because the lighting equipment held by the people around them all fell to the ground, the top of the mountain still looked quite bright now.

Those rays of light were reflected on the Dark Edge spear and a faint cold light bloomed.

Whizzing–

And at the next moment, Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge spear that he was holding.

Liu Yanran closed her eyes subconsciously, but the sharp pain she imagined did not come, instead she heard the sound of the hemp rope breaking

“Get up.”

Lin Xiu said aloud.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Liu Yanran, who originally closed her eyes, also slowly opened her eyes.

She found that the hemp ropes on her body had been completely cut off.

“Get up… can’t get up.”

Liu Yanran said a little embarrassedly, because Chen An and others used the special ‘Bewitching Powder’, so her body was still lack of strength.

Lin Xiu thought about it for a while. Her body’s power was probably suppressed for some reason, but it was not easy to suppress the power of a warrior and it should disappear soon.

“Then just wait.”

Lin Xiu said aloud.

“You… are you Lin Xiu?” Liu Yanran thought about it for a while, but said it out loud.

“Why, did you recognize me?” Lin Xiu didn’t deny it, then said with a smile.

“Today, when I watched the battle, I knew it was you.”

Liu Yanran was silent for a while, then said with a smile.

The Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was really unique and the marksmanship used by Lin Xiu was also very familiar. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“This…is this your true face?”

Liu Yanran said.

“En, that’s right.”

Lin Xiu nodded, there was nothing to hide.

Liu Yanran was a little confused at this time. When she first saw Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu looked like a middle-aged man, but when she saw Lin Xiu again, Lin Xiu really looked like a teenager.

Looking at Lin Xiu’s age, she didn’t even know if he was already 18 or not.

It’s amazing to be so young and so powerful.

“There shouldn’t be anything else, right?”

After a while, Lin Xiu spoke to her.

“En.”

Liu Yanran nodded, then slowly stood up.

Now, the effect of this ‘Bewitching power’ has almost completely disappeared.

“These people…”

Liu Yanran looked at the corpse on the ground before, her eyes filled with curiosity. Although she was curious, she didn’t dare to ask Lin Xiu.

“En, people who wanted to kill me.”

“It seems that they’re from the Wu family and the Lu family.”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

“Oh.”

Liu Yanran nodded subconsciously, but she quickly reacted, her eyes widened and she said incredulously, “This…is this from the Wu family and the Lu family?”

“En, a master warrior-level warrior and a few rank 9 warriors.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Liu Yanran’s eyes widened and she secretly swallowed.

Lin Xiu’s statement was simply too shocking.

Why, are you afraid?

Lin Xiu said with a smile.

“No… no.”

Liu Yanran nodded, then shook her head again.

“Your Liu family doesn’t have any strategic alliance with the Wu family and Lu family, do they?”

While walking down the mountain, Lin Xiu said aloud.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Liu Yanran shook her head, “No, it’s the opposite.”

“Our Liu family, the Wu family and the Lu family are all at odds with each other.”

“And because the Wu family has Wu Changkong and Wu Changkong’s grandfather, two master warrior-level powerhouses. Our Liu family has been suppressed.”

“Oh right.”

Liu Yanran seemed to have thought of something, then stopped.

SO

“What is it?”

“Can I tell this to my family?”

Liu Yanran thought about it for a while, then said aloud.

“As long as I tell the patriarch about it, with your strength, you would definitely be worshipped by our Liu family.”

“Yes you can, but I won’t be the worship of your Liu family.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

“Why…” “Because I probably won’t come here again in the future.”

Lin Xiu looked at the sky, then said lightly.

His thoughts quickly went to another place. It has been several days since he arrived at Marqi planet, but it seemed that he wouldn’t reach Fengyun City so quickly.

He wasn’t sure how’s Luo Yue.

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu felt the faint source strength fluctuations from the moon-shaped jade pendant on his chest and the corners of his mouth twitched.

“Why?”

Liu Yanran said subconsciously.

“I’m here to find someone. Once I find her, I should go back.”

Lin Xiu didn’t say anything in details.

“It must be someone very important to you,” Liu Yanran said. “That’s right.”

“Yo, Liu Yanran, I haven’t seen you all night. It turns out that you hooked up with another wild man.”

Just as the two walked down the street, a voice suddenly came from the other side.

“Yanran, where have you been? Why didn’t I see you the whole night? Do you know that your parents are very worried about you?”

Liu Yanran looked at the source of the sound and suddenly heard a familiar voice not far away.

Taking a closer look, it was Liu Cheng and several members of the Liu family. A tall and strong middle-aged man stood beside Liu Cheng, looking very dignified. This was the current patriarch of the Liu family, Liu Shen.
