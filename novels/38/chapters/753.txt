Chapter 754: From Earth

After mending the wounds, Liu Pan stood up as well.

“There must be more predators around here. If all of them come in this direction, we would be in grave danger.”

“Plus, most of the ‘Predators’ are master warriors.”

Liu Pan was aware that Lin Xiu was a powerful warrior but if all of the predators ended up surrounding them, it would be incredibly dangerous.

“We’re done as well...”

An Qi and Qian Ling had already mend the wounds on their body and were walking towards them.

There were a few wear and tear on their combat suits; even their beautiful faces looked a little dirty now.

Liu Pan looked the same as well. All of them looked exhausted and Lin Xiu was the only one that looked relatively better than the rest of them.

“Both of you are going as well?”

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment before asking.

They had just entered the area and met with such danger. If they continued further into the area, they would meet even more dangerous events.

Plus, there was a king grade evolved beast in front. Lin Xiu may not have the time and effort to care for them.

“Of course!”

Qian Ling and An Qi nodded their heads.

As a warrior, they must have a courageous heart and an adventurous mind.

“Of course. Our target is over there as well.”

Liu Pan chipped in.

“Both of them are rubbish. They were worse than these two girls.”

Liu Pan said in satisfaction.

Xiao Qiang and Zhao Kai didn’t even stay to fight. As soon as they heard that the men were Predators, both of them fled.

“Let’s continue then.”

Lin Xiu thought about it before saying to them.

All of them were strangers. Since they were the ones who have decided to head to the same place, Lin Xiu would not be responsible for their safety.

His abilities were weak as well in front of a king grade evolved beast.

As they continued walking into the deeper ends of the forest, all of them were extremely cautious after taking into account what had just happened earlier.

This time, they did not meet any other ‘Predators’.

Soon, the sky turned dark.

“Let’s stop here.”

They found a river in one end of the forest and Lin Xiu was thinking perhaps they would be able to have some fish for dinner.

“Sure.”

The rest of them were relieved as well. After the fight and travelling for such a long time, they were exhausted.

Especially for Qian Ling and An Qi; they immediately sat on the ground and let out a breath of relief.

Lin Xiu gathered some dry wood and used his source energy to start a fire. A huge campfire immediately started burning.

Their surroundings turned bright with the fire and the warmth of the campfire seemed to warm up the cold night.

It reminded them of an adventure – perhaps something that has happened before where they would sit by the river and catch fishes as they rested.

However, in this river, there were no fishes in sight.

Instead, there were tiny little black snakes with red eyes swimming in the river and they looked extremely disgusting.

“Brother Lin, take this.”

Liu Pan was sitting by the fire, took out a small bottle of nourishment liquid and tossed it towards Lin Xiu.

“Thank you.”

Lin Xiu accepted the bottle and smiled.

The nourishment liquid on this planet was different from the ones back on earth. The potion here was green in colour.

The only similarity was that both of them tasted disgusting.

Qian Ling and An Qi prepared nourishment liquid as well. They took it out of their bags and finished it in one gulp.

“Hu…. finally time to rest.”

Liu Pan rested on a piece of rock behind his back, looking for a comfortable position.

There were lots of standing rocks by the river and some of them were as tall as a standing human being, allowing him to rest comfortably.

“Right, Brother Lin….are you from another planet?” Lin Xiu suddenly thought of something and decided to ask Lin Xiu.

An Qi and Qian Ling heard the question as well and both of them turned towards Lin Xiu.

After spending an entire day together, they were all curious about Lin Xiu.

From Lin Xiu’s appearance, he doesn’t look old.

But his abilities were unimaginable for someone of his age.

Until now, they have not seen Lin Xiu in a serious fight.

“Yes.”

There was nothing for him to hide.

“Are you from earth?”

An Qi hesitated for a moment but still decided to ask.

“How did you know?”

Lin Xiu was stunned before asking subconsciously.

“An Qi’s family owns the spaceship.”

Qian Ling chuckled and answered instead.

“Damn….I didn’t know we have a hidden gem here.”

When Liu Pan heard what Qian Ling said, he replied in an exaggerated manner.

But the only thing that he got in return were two women staring at him with a dissatisfied look in their eyes.

Liu Pan felt helpless.

“Oh…..Do you know….if that spaceship is still operating?”

Lin Xiu asked.

When Lin Xiu first got onto the planet, there were already a few damages done to the plane and plus, when he heard about how all the flight back to earth had been cancelled, Lin Xiu got curious.

“I think they stopped it for quite some time….I heard that there were a few damages that happened to the spaceship after a crash.”

An Qi answered Lin Xiu’s question.

It was exactly the answer that Lin Xiu thought to himself.

“Right…. Are all earthlings as strong as you?”

Qian Ling couldn’t help but ask.

Initially, when they saw that Lin Xiu was a man with black eyes, they thought that he would be a weakling.

But today, Lin Xiu had completely overturned their opinions about men with black eyes.

“Are they?!”

An Qi wanted to ask the same question.

Lin Xiu’s abilities were almost the same as those powerful elders in her family.

But, Lin Xiu looked incredibly young!!!

“Not necessary.”

Lin Xiu smiled and did not say anything more.

Lin Xiu was reminded about something which caused him to remain silent.

When the girls noticed what happened, they stopped asking as well as they could feel that something that they said had reminded Lin Xiu of something or someone.

“Hehe….Brother Lin, are you here for an adventure or to look for women?”

“You need to know that there is lots of beauty on our planet.”

Liu Pan, who sounds like a pervert now, did not put too much thought into it. He grabbed onto Lin Xiu’s shoulder and asked.

“Leave me alone.”

Lin Xiu was caught off guard and quickly pushed away the fat man.

An Qi and Qian Ling glared at the man as well.

“I’m looking for someone.”

Lin Xiu had no other choice but to answer his question.

“Who?!”

This immediately triggered the curiosity in Liu Pan’s heart.

Even An Qi and Qian Ling were hoping to hear an answer from Lin Xiu.

“I won’t tell you who it is.”

Lin XIu rolled his eyes and answered Liu Pan.

“Damn!!! Brother Lin, that’s not nice of you.”

Seeing how he wouldn’t be getting an answer, it felt uncomfortable as he was left hanging.

“I’m going to sleep.”Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
