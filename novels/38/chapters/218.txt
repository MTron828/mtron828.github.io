Chapter 219: Who Permitted You To Leave?

“Hehehe, if you have the guts, kill me…!” Ouyang Hang trembled and spat out.

Electric currents were running all over his body. Lin Xiu’s Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist had harmed him greatly.

Endless killing intent surged in his eyes when Lin Xiu heard his words.

He wanted to stomp on his head and kill him.

But he exhaled and looked over to the group that had their swords at Luo Yue’s neck: “Let her go.”

“Let our class monitor go first!” Tian Zixia and the others glared at him ferociously and retorted.

Lin Xiu’s leg dangled above Ouyang Hang’s head.

He was unable to move and as long as Lin Xiu exerted a bit of force, he would smash his head into bits.

“Let her go first.” Lin Xiu looked at them indifferently and replied.

His eyes that were brimming with killing intent sent shivers down their spine.

“On the count of three, we will let go at the same time.” Tian Zixia clenched her jaws and said.

“Fine.” Lin Xiu replied indifferently.

“One.”

“Two.”

“Three….!”

At the count of three, Lin Xiu kicked Ouyang Hang over.

They also retracted their swords from Luo Yue’s neck.

“Are you alright?” Lin Xiu asked in concern once Luo Yue jumped over to his side.

Luo Yue shook her head. With a thought, the thin sword on the ground flew back to her hand.

“Hmph! Count yourself lucky, we will have your lives the next time we meet!” The few north campus class 2 students glared at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue and declared.

Tian Zixia supported Ouyang Hang as they started to leave.

“Who permitted you to leave?” Lin Xiu spoke up indifferently when he saw them leaving.

“What do you mean!?” The expressions in their eyes changed when they heard his words and rebuked in anger.

Lin Xiu pointed Dark Edge at them.

“Leave your odd crystals and you guys can go.” Lin Xiu replied.

Luo Yue stared at them and tightened her grip around her sword while standing beside Lin Xiu.

ALthough she was unable to unleash all her strength, it was not a problem for her to fight alongside Lin Xiu.

“Impossible!” Tian Zixia refused through clenched teeth.

If that was the case, they would be eliminated right away, how could they tolerate that?

“Then we can only snatch it.” Lin Xiu snorted.

They had just wanted to snatch Lin Xiu’s odd crystals, so they would continue the battle!

Upon hearing his words, their eyes changed.

Ouyang Hang was the strongest among them but he was reduced to such a state, the four of them would have difficulty winning against Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

Their chance of victory was low.

Their expressions were dark and gloomy.

“A third of it, we will give you a third of our odd crystals. Otherwise, we will fight you till the end!” Tian Zixia replied with pain in her voice.

Ouyang Hang had fainted from the severe injuries sustained while fighting Lin Xiu. If they did not bring him back to the infirmary in time, he would either go into shock or die.

Lin Xiu frowned and looked at Luo Yue.

Their eyes met and Luo Yue nodded.

“Sure.” After hearing Lin Xiu’s agreement, Tian Zixia gestured to one of her teammates.

Although he was unwilling, he still opened his bag and took out a pile of odd crystals, and placed them on the ground.

“That’s a third of it.” Tian Zixia looked at Lin Xiu and said with a gloomy expression.

These were the odd crystals that they had hunted and stole. They believed that they were steadily at first place but after losing a third of it and against Zhuo Qixing’s team, they knew they had lost the position.

Lin Xiu squinted his eyes, there were at least more than 40 odd crystals.

And all of them were rank 5 odd crystals.

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

Tian Zixia and the team looked at Lin Xiu cautiously while they supported Ouyang Hang out of the city gates.

Lin Xiu’s body went soft after they left and he used Dark Edge to support himself.

He had sustained injuries against Ouyang Hang as well.

Ouyang Hang was very strong, as expected of a peak rank 5 warrior.

But Lin Xiu found consolation in the fact that he was able to defeat a peak rank 5 after entering rank 5 himself.

And it was under the condition of not using the system’s skills!

If he used Fury, he might even be on par with a rank 6 warrior! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I’m fine.” Seeing Luo Yue’s look of concern, he revealed a smile and reassured her.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath. After recovering slightly, he walked over and picked up the odd crystals.

He placed them in his bag.

Rollie leaped out after seeing so many odd crystals. It used its two hands to raise the Ice crystal white bird’s egg and leaped into Lin Xiu’s front pocket.

The bag was already full of odd crystals.

Lin Xiu was carrying a large size bag and as it was full, he could feel the weight of it.

He estimated that there were at least 200 and more odd crystals.

“Let’s go!”

After resting for a bit, the two headed towards the airship.

“Why aren’t class monitor and Luo Yue back yet?” Li Ping stood at the side of the airship and asked.

The majority of Sacred Region Academy students had rushed back but there were no signs of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

“North campus class 1?” Zhang Yin saw north campus class 1 students supporting a person over and frowned.

The other Sacred Region Academy students also saw them and felt the urge to fight them.

That was because their odd crystals were seized by them.

“You guys send him over to the infirmary first.” Tian Zixia told her teammates.

The two nodded and supported Ouyang Hang inside.

Tian Zixia walked over to the registration.

She saw many other classes had registered their information.

The majority of them had dozens of odd crystals.

It was already quite a feat. After all, rank 5 evolved beasts were not so easily killed.

“North campus class 1?” The old man seated at the table looked at her and asked indifferently.
