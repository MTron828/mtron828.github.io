Chapter 116: Black Salt Lake!

A lake!

It was the scene of a large lake that resembled a circular mirror.

Lin Xiu stood by the side and subconsciously extended his hand out to touch the lake. He immediately felt an extreme cold sensation.

It was a chill that could cause the bone to freeze!

“The water looks strange, it won’t be a surprise if there is treasure beneath.” Tian Zhi gazed down, and after sizing up the place, he commented as he noticed Lin Xiu’s interest in it.

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu nodded. The bottom of the Black Salt Lake contained the so-called Salt Crystal.

It was an invaluable commodity…

“Please help me.” Right at this time, Tian Zhi suddenly knelt before Lin Xiu and pleaded.

“You…” Lin Xiu turned to his action and was startled. He did not understand what was going on.

“There is a unique Salt Crystal at the bottom of the lake, I only need a bit, just a bit to save my daughter’s life,” Tian Zhi said with teary eyes.

His daughter had symptoms of her immunity weakening and in time would have no immunity in her body. Furthermore, this illness was caused by a new strain of the virus in this world, and he needed the unique properties of the Salt Crystal to tackle the virus and save his daughter.

“I can go down, but are there evolved beasts here?” Lin Xiu pondered for a bit and asked.

Lin Xiu wanted to obtain the Salt Crystals too as they were worth 50 million union coins.

This commodity was definitely not as simple as to just cure illnesses.

“Yes, there are evolved beasts inside, but they won’t exceed rank 4,” Tian Zhi replied Lin Xiu earnestly.

“Get up first.” Lin Xiu felt a headache talking to someone kowtowing to him.

Tian Zhi thought for a moment before standing up.

“I saw how you dealt with those monsters and enemies with ease, you are definitely much stronger than I am. With your strength, I don’t think there will be any issues.” Tian Zhi told Lin Xiu.

“But there won’t always be Salt Crystals in there. Whether or not I can get it will depend on luck, right?” Lin Xiu read the information before and asked Tian Zhi.

“That’s right,” Tian Zhi said bitterly. Lin Xiu had spoken the facts, although it was extremely expensive, it was rare and thus the reason no one went to find it.

And it was even possible for the Salt Crystals to appear for one day and disappear the next.

“I will give it a try.” Lin Xiu nodded. If he could obtain it, he would be rich instantly. 50 million union coins were enough for him to buy many things.

“These are protective glasses.” Tian Zhi was already prepared and took out a protective glass with night vision capabilities and handed it over to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded and accepted it.

“Thank you.” Tian Zhi bowed towards Lin Xiu earnestly.

He was trembling slightly, if he did not find the Salt Crystal, his daughter would die…

Upon thinking about this, his eyes turned red.

Lin Xiu took a stroll along the shore of the lake and then placed his bag and spear box on the ground.

He then donned the protective glasses that Tian Zhi gave him.

He looked at the mirror-like surface of the lake, took a deep breath, and dived headfirst!

Lin Xiu immediately felt the bone-chilling cold upon entering the water.

As a warrior’s vital capacity was already large and after learning cultivation techniques, the pores on their skin had the ability to inhale slightly as well.

With a thought, source strength enveloped his entire body. The bone-chilling cold dispersed and it became warmer, but he could still feel the chilliness.

The protective glasses had night vision capabilities and shot out a large amount of light like a torch, illuminating the surrounding water.

But as he swam deeper, Lin Xiu did not find anything.

Not a single trace of living things or fishes could be seen. It was extremely strange.

Lin Xiu looked around. At this moment, he was at the bottom and was starting to feel terrible with the pressure.

The ground was littered with black stones of all shapes and sizes.

But there was no such thing as the so-called salt crystal.

Lin Xiu decided to try his luck as the probability of encountering some was extremely small.

Lin Xiu massaged his head and was able to swim upwards when he thought he saw a smear of white.

What was that?!

Lin Xiu became alarmed and immediately swam in that direction.

He saw a completely white fish-related monster that had two pincers.

He activated Analytic Eye without hesitation:

Rank 4 Giant Turtle Whitefish, the appearance of a whitefish but can grow over a meter long with a pair of mythological pincers that can rip any warrior’s body apart with ease.

Lives in water with a high concentration of salt.

This rank 4 giant turtle whitefish stared at Lin Xiu for a while and suddenly charged towards him!

It was extremely fast in the water as it opened its giant pincers with the intent of ripping Lin Xiu apart!

Lin Xiu realized that there were many human skeletons around that had turned black due to the water and were undiscovered.

The monster had plans to attack Lin Xiu! Inside the water, Lin Xiu’s body was obviously much slower than on land.

But the rank 4 giant turtle whitefish was completely unaffected. It wanted to use its giant pincers to tear Lin Xiu in two!

Lin Xiu’s gaze changed when he saw the whitefish, but he grabbed onto the pincer that came at him. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

He exerted strength with the intent of ripping apart the pincer, but the giant turtle whitefish used its other pincer to attack Lin Xiu.

‘Damn it!’

Lin Xiu was alarmed at the face of danger.

His strength had plummeted inside the water, he had no time to dodge!

Left with no choice, Lin Xiu activated Fury, and his reaction time amplified multiple times.

He kicked onto a black rock and produced a momentum to avoid the other pincer in time!
