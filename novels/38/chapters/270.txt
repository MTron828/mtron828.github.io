Chapter 271: Strange Trees

Lin Xiu looked at the black trees with surprise.

The trees were unlike ordinary trees, not only were the surfaces black, but they seemed to be able to refract light.

This surprised everyone.

Bang bang bang-

Lin Xiu used a bit of force to knock on the tree and produced a series of low knocking sounds. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The black trunks were like metal and extremely queer.

“What exactly is this…” Lin Xiu could not help but be surprised.

He had never seen such a mysterious tree in his life before.

“Be careful, don’t touch it!”

Lin Xiu was about to use Dark Edge’s tip to poke at the black tree when Guo Ling suddenly spoke up.

Lin Xiu was startled when he heard her panic and was about to ask why when all the warriors around revealed expressions as though they were in for a good treat.

Lin Xiu’s eyes changed as he sensed movements at his location.

Right at that moment, a long and black thing shot forward!

Clank-!

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted as he moved Dark Edge and stabbed in front of him!

Dark Edge collided into something that felt like metal!

Lin Xiu finally realized that it was actually the roots of the tree!

It was Lin Xiu’s first time experiencing such a bizarre thing. The roots of the weird trees were capable of attacking!

‘Wait, are these trees conscious?!’

Sou sou sou-

While in surprise, more and more black branches shot out from the tree roots shot out from beneath the soil and straight at Lin Xiu!

Clank clank clank-

All the roots were like extremely strong whips that lashed at Lin Xiu.

His pupils constricted as he danced with Dark Edge and attacked the roots.

The roots were extremely tenacious and tough, every collision would produce sounds similar to metals clashing against one another.

“They are afraid of fire!”

Guo Ling watched and suddenly shouted out.

Lin Xiu raised an eyebrow and reacted. In an instant, source strength surged out from his body.

The powerful source strength surged into Dark Edge.

Rumble-

Following the gurgling sounds, flames appeared at the tip of Lin Xiu’s spear.

Red Lotus Fire!

Lin Xiu was even more proficient in controlling this fire and endless flames enveloped the spear in an instant.

All the black roots that were attacking relentlessly seemed to become anxious and retracted back.

“You want to leave!?”

Lin Xiu raised an eyebrow at the sight of this and launched his spear forward!

Rumble-

The roots emitted loud sounds and were burnt by Lin Xiu’s flames!

It was like fire interacting with oil, it quickly pervaded the roots and the trunk of the tree and combusted upwards!

Very quickly, the strange metallic black tree combusted into charcoal.

The entire tree fell to the ground.

All the warriors that thought they had a show to watch were shocked and looked at Lin Xiu with surprise in their eyes.

They did not expect Lin Xiu to resolve the danger so easily.

“These trees that exist only in the Dark Forest seem to have a bit of consciousness. They are unlike ordinary trees and will attack upon being threatened.” Guo Ling explained with a hint of surprise after seeing how Lin Xiu destroyed the tree with his flames.

‘His reaction to that surprise attack was a little too fast, right?’

“En, I was careless.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

If not for his Red Lotus Fire, he would have been in trouble.

The strange trees not only had metallic structures but had extremely tough roots.

Lin Xiu finally knew why they only announced for rank 6 or above warriors in Sacred Region Academy to enter Dark Forest.

The warriors slowly scattered and their surroundings quickly became quiet.

They were left alone.

“Where do we go now?” Lin Xiu looked deep into the forest and felt that everywhere looked the same. It was all black trees and not a single shadow of any other living things.

“We continue straight, the thing we want is just right ahead.” Guo Ling nodded her head and looked forward and chose the direction.

The group moved on under Guo Ling’s guidance.

The further they went, the denser the trees became.

Although the Android Battle Tigers were good means of transportation, they became too narrow for them to ride any further.

They were too large and the trees were too close together for them to pass.

“Forget it, let’s leave them here first. They can’t go in.” Lin Xiu jumped from his mount and turned to the others and advised.

They nodded their heads and dropped from their android battle tigers.

It was impossible for people to steal their android battle tigers away.

They continued on ahead.

As they ventured in further, the grass on the ground became black.

Lin Xiu stepped on the black grass and felt a weird sensation.

“Guo Ling, what are these?” Qiu Li carefully looked around and said from the side.

It was extremely eerie around and made their hairs stand.

It was especially so where they currently were, their surroundings became even more gloomy as though all the light in the sky had darkened.

It made them feel suppressed.

“I think we are close to the center of Dark Forest, I don’t have the exact location.” Guo Ling looked ahead and said.

Sou-

A strange sound suddenly came out at this moment.

‘What was that!?’
