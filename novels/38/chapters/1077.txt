Chapter 1078: I’ll Give You An Explosion

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

After getting blasted far away, they managed to steadied themselves.

However, with the blink of an eye, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared right in front of them!

Lin Xiu held onto the long spear and started attacking one of the sage warriors who had a warhammer.

Clang – –

When the sage warrior noticed Lin Xiu coming at him, he subconsciously lifted up his warhammer to block the attack.

There was a huge sound that followed the collision.

Lin Xiu has put in some force into the attack and it led to a strong impact to the other sage warrior, causing his body to be pushed far behind.

His hands that held onto the warhammer started feeling numb as well.

Boom – –

Before he could come back to his senses, Lin Xiu moved his long spear and there were a large number of flaming birds that were headed toward him!

With the flaming birds, the surrounding temperature that was freezing cold earlier instantly became warm.

It went from freezing cold to scorching hot.

As for the sage warrior with the warhammer, his pupil shrank when he saw the flaming birds.

Then, he quickly shifted his body and tried to dodge the attack.

He has seen Lin Xiu using these flaming birds to kill the ice crystal sea snake.

Knowing how powerful these flaming birds were, he immediately released his ‘sphere’ and did not dare to forcefully go against the flaming birds.

“You’re dead!”

The other sage warrior who had the machete started attacking Lin Xiu from behind him.

With the swing of his machete, there was an overpowering aura that came from it, headed toward Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

The aura landed on Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’ and the strong impact of it forced Lin Xiu to be pushed far away.

However, it did not cause much damage to Lin Xiu.

At the same time, there was a source mark that appeared on his forehead.

It was a white source mark.

As the source mark glowed, the ice that was found on the ground started cracking into smaller pieces.

They flew up into the air and quickly gathered together.

Then, it slowly formed a huge snow giant!

The snow went after Lin Xiu and swung its huge left hand at Lin Xiu’s body!

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu looked at what was in front of him and sneered.

The long spear left his hand and went for the sage warrior who was fighting him.

At the same time, Lin Xiu clenched his fist tightly.

Koong loong – –

As the energy started gathering around his fist, the dark blue flame started burning brightly.

Lin Xiu quickly swung his fist that was covered in flames and collided it with the fist of the snow giant who was about to reach him.

Plus, as Lin Xiu moved his fist, there was an eye-blinding light that came from it.

‘Explosive Strike’!

With the loud explosion, the entire body of the huge snow giant was crushed into multiple smaller pieces and was scattered all over the ground.

Damn it! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The warrior, who had a machete, noticed how the snow giant that he had formed with his source mark energy had been destroyed by Lin Xiu. He couldn’t help but curse under his breath.

The look on his face was awful as well.

Then, with the control of his mind, he quickly releases his domain forces.

The other sage warrior who had the warhammer did the same as well and was trying to release his domain forces.

It would be difficult for one warrior to fight a group of people; especially if they are at the same level.

This was because more warriors involved would mean that there would be additional domain forces that they could use.

Usually, if there is one warrior trying to fight a group of warriors, the solo warrior would be in great trouble.

“This is all you’ve got?”

Lin Xiu stared at the scene before him and narrowed his eyes.

Then, with the control of his mind, Lin XIu immediately activated the Purification Domain.

Swush – –

As the bright, white light slowly washed across the ground like the waves, they soon realised that all of their domain forces had disappeared!!

How was this possible?!

When they saw what was happening, the look in their eyes changed.

They realised that their domain forces have all disappeared!

“What did you do?!”

One of the warriors glared at Lin Xiu and screamed.

Lin Xiu did not bother answering him. Instead, he waved his right hand and the flaming birds immediately went their way.

Both the sage warriors were shocked and quickly flew higher up into the air to dodge the attack.

Lin Xiu had a cold laugh on his face and slowly, a black sourcemark appeared on his forehead.

Then, following after that, there was a large number of arrays that appeared all around them.

The arrays join together to form a huge dome which enclosed Lin Xiu and both the warriors opposite him.

What was this?!

When they noticed what was happening around them, their pupil shrank uncontrollably.

As they were trying to run away from the flaming bird, they held onto the weapons and tried to break free from the array.

Boom – –

There was a loud sound that came from it but nothing happened to the array.

They had no way of breaking out of this array!

“Let me give you both an explosion.”

Lin Xiu smirked when he looked at both the sage warriors in front of him.

With the control of his mind, there were three lotus flames that appeared in his hands.

Red lotus flame, white lotus flame and the current lotus flame.

All three of the flames have different elemental energy.

“Head over there!”

Lin Xiu waved his right hand and all three of the lotus flames left his side.

Then, all of them went after the sage warrior who had the warhammer!

“What is this?!”

Seeing how there were three peculiar looking lotus flames coming at him, the sage warrior with the warhammer shouted in rage.

That’s when the source mark on his head lit up.

It was glowing with a warm blue light.

This was a water element source mark.

As he used the energy from his source mark, they could clearly see that there were a large number of droplets that appeared in the air around them.

Then, the droplets quickly gathered together to form a water tornado and it went straight for the three lotus flames!

At the same time, Lin Xiu controlled the lotus flames so that they would be joined together!

Boom – –

There was a huge noise that appeared when all three lotus flames were joined together.

It felt as if the entire space was about to explode.

The rest of the warriors, who were cultivating on the ground to absorb the energy from the air around them, finally opened their eyes.

They looked into the sky and saw the huge array. Inside the array, they could see that there were flames that were red and white in colour.

There was also electrical current that kept coming around these flames.

“Huuuuu…”

The flames slowly disappeared, the other sage warrior with the sword started panting.

The ‘sphere’ around him was already filled with cracks and it looked like it was about to explode.

As for the sage warrior with the warhammer who wanted to fight the lotus flames with his water tornado, his body was burnt into ash with only his bones left and he fell straight to the ground.

When the other sage warrior saw what happened, he looked confused.

He never thought that Lin Xiu would have such powers!
