Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

‘Taking a closer look at this time, Lin Xiu saw a young girl appearing in front of him.

‘The girl was wearing a long red dress, and also had two long knives hanging from her waist.

It looked a bit similar to what Baili Haoling is wearing. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Damn…”

After the old man flew out, his body rotated in the air for a week, and then landed firmly on the ground.

He stared at the girl in front of him. In addition to killing intent, his eyes were also full of disbelief.

‘What happened just now, before he could even react at all, and was kicked and flew out by this girl!

“Who the hell are you!?”

He said coldly.

‘The surrounding audience was also in an uproar at this time.

“are all the little girls so powerful these days?”

“Luo Yue from Sky City, and Baili Haoling from Sacred Region Academy… Now there’s another girl who kicked the rank 9 warrior from the Nan family…”

‘When some viewers saw this scene, they had already ignored the fact that the old man broke the rules. Instead, their faces were full of disbelief.

“Who is she!?”

The vice president of Sky City also opened his eyes wide, and his eyes were full of shock.

He couldn’t feel the source fluctuations coming from the girl, but it was a fact that she kicked the old man from the Nan family just now.

‘That old man is a rank 9 warrior!

Baili Haoling was still in a fierce battle with Yu Muchen at the time, and she couldn’t help but be surprised when she saw this scene out of the corner of her eyes.

“Damn, get lost!”

Yu Muchen found that Baili Haoling was distracted. At this time, he seized the opportunity and attacked Baili Haoling directly!

The halberd in his hand was full of terrifying power, and the entire spear body had little spots of light glowing because of the large amount of source strength transmitted.

But Baili Haoling’s reaction speed was very fast. At this moment, she directly held the double swords in her hand and resisted Yu Muchen’s attack.

Boom—

With a loud noise, Baili Haoling took a few steps back, and Yu Muchen flew out directly.

‘When he was about to fly out from the platform, he stabilized his body and spat out a mouthful of blood from his lips.

“You are too weak.” Baili Haoling said with a sneer.

“Shut up!”

Hearing Baili Haoling’s voice, the expression in his eyes changed greatly and he became even angrier.

But this time, before he could attack again, Baili Haoling rushed over!

The look in Yu Muchen’s eyes changed. When he wanted to dodge, Baili Haoling had already rushed in front of him!

“Get lost!”

Baili Haoling shouted, and slashed with both knives. When Yu Muchen blocked his attack, Baili Haoling directly kicked his chest and kicked him out.

He slammed into the wall behind, making a loud noise.

Baili Haoling didn’t pay attention to what was going on here now. She continued to look over there, looking at the girl with double ponytails, her eyes were full of surprise.

She always had a feeling that she seemed to know her.

But thinking about it carefully, Baili Haoling couldn’t think of where she had seen her.

“Senior, you are…”

Lin Xiu looked at the girl who appeared in front of him, who was dressed a bit like Baili Haoling, and his eyes were full of surprise.

Because just after knowing that the ‘Hidden Source Technique’ could change a person’s body, Lin Xiu didn’t immediately think she was very young when he saw this seemingly very young girl.

After all, her strength was too strong, and she wouldn’t be so strong even if she started training from her mother’s womb.

“Young man, you’re pretty good.” The girl looked at Lin Xiu, then pretended to be an elder and said aloud.

“The fight continues, I won’t let him stop the fight.”

The girl looked at the old man over there, and said lightly.

Lin Xiu nodded. Hearing her words, he glanced at Nan Huang over there, his eyes filled with infinite killing intent.

‘The effects of ‘Fury’ and ‘Power of the Stars’ would soon disappear.

Now is the last chance!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu had no hesitation and rushed towards Nan Huang!

‘When Nan Huang saw Lin Xiu who was attacking, his eyes were full of fear.

‘When he fought against Lin Xiu, he had already used all the strength of his body, but even so, he still did not kill Lin Xiu.

Now he has no strength to fight against Lin Xiu again!

And Lin Xiu’s current strength was obviously still at its peak.

“Grandpa, save me!”

Nan Huang shouted loudly to the old man.

It was impossible for him to say the words “admit defeat” to Lin Xiu!

“Go to hell!”

Lin Xiu’s body leaped up at this time, and the source strength in his body was mobilized again.

“Tiger on the ground’!

With his current state, he could still use this extremely lethal skill once again.

This time, he will kill him directly!

‘When Nan Huang’s grandfather saw this scene, he roared angrily and rushed towards Nan Huang to take Lin Xiu’s blow.

“Go away!”

The girl moved at this moment, and her hand instantly pulled out the two knives from her waist, and then rushed towards the old man.

Swoosh—

Her speed was very fast, so fast that no one could see her, as if she was teleporting, she appeared in front of the old man.

The long knives in both hands seemed to be enveloped by a large amount of black energy, which was very strange.

The old man watched the girl’s bizarre two-knife slash at his body. The expression in his eyes changed slightly. He instinctively felt that he was in extreme danger, so he immediately unfolded his ‘Sphere!!

Boom—

‘The girl’s double knives slashed directly on his ‘Sphere’ and was blocked by it but the strong impact force made him rush out directly.

Directly flew out of the competition stage!

The whole body hit the wall below the auditorium, making a loud noise.

“Damn…”

A mouthful of blood was instantly spat out from the old man’s mouth.

Taking a closer look, there are already cracks on his ‘Sphere’.

One blow, just this one blow, almost shattered the ‘Sphere’ of this powerful rank 9 warrior.

This is really terrifying.

“Go to hell!” At the same time, Lin Xiu was holding a spear, and his whole body was like a huge and terrifying tiger, charging down!

“Don’t!!!”

Nan Huang roared, and wanted to forcibly resist Lin Xiu’s attack!

But the bones of his body were almost all broken by Lin Xiu’s previous attack, and now he couldn’t even lift a spear.

Moreover, Lin Xiu’s current attack was really too strong, the whole person was like a god descending to earth!
