Chapter 708 Source mark- ‘Nine Dragons Bathing in Fire’

‘What skill is this!?’

Seeing that Lin Xiu suddenly turned into a golden statue, the old man changed slightly.

But at this time, all their attacks had already hit Lin Xiu’s body!

It was different from what they expected. Lin Xiu, who turned into a golden statue, stood still, as if he was not injured at all.

How can that be!

Not only the old man, but even Lu Jian and the others were full of horror.

Because what happened now was really incredible, how could Lin Xiu suddenly become like a statue!?

Lin Xiu turned into a golden statue and only lasted for one second, but in this second, all the most powerful attacks of these skills had been neutralized!

This was the new system skill acquired after advancing to rank 9-— ‘Golden Body Immortality’!

You can be immune to all damage for one second!

‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!!!

And in the next moment, Lin Xiu was already waving the Dark Edge spear in his hand again.

With the swing of the Dark Edge spear, the black matter transformed from a large amount of source strength transmitted from the spear instantly formed a huge black dragon. The black dragon opened its huge mouth and charged toward the old man directly!

Because he just thought that Lin Xiu was going to die, the old man almost exhausted all the energy in his body on that blow. But at this time, he didn’t know what kind of skill Lin Xiu used and he managed to dodge all his blows.

Looking at the black giant dragon that was charging over, the old man gritted his teeth and attacked it with the sword in his hand. But the power of this giant dragon was really terrifying. In the next moment, the black giant dragon bit his body!

Lin Xiu turned around and looked at Lu Jian and the others behind him, his eyes were full of killing intent.

Lu Jian looked at Lin Xiu’s eyes and his body trembled.

Lin Xiu’s strength was so terrifying that he didn’t even suffer the slightest damage in this attack.

What kind of strength is this!?

Because of the attack just now, Lu Jian and the others already had fear in their hearts.

Once there was fear, the power cannot be fully exerted.

And at this moment, as Lin Xiu waved his Dark Edge spear, the sky suddenly turned into a sea of fire.

And at this time, a large number of flames gathered in the sea of fire in the sky seemed to be like huge meteorites, impacting down from the sky!

‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’!

boom boom boom —

The entire mountain top was slammed down by this terrifying flame.

“Sphere’!!!”

Seeing this terrifying scene, Lu Jian couldn’t help roaring loudly. The warriors around him also unfolded their ‘Sphere’ at the same time, trying to resist this terrifying skill released by Lin Xiu.

But those terrifying flame balls smashed on their ‘Sphere’, making them tremble with fear.

Because even through the ‘Sphere’, one could clearly feel the terrifying energy brought by this flame ball.

“Humph!”

Just when Lu Jian thought that his ‘Sphere’ could withstand this seemingly terrifying skill, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared in front of him.

The Dark Edge spear that Lin Xiu was holding turned dark red now, which looked very strange. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Bang bang bang

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and frantically attacked his ‘Sphere’!

With the loud noises, Lu Jian discovered that a large number of cracks had appeared on his indestructible ‘Sphere’!

How can that be!

Seeing this scene, his eyes widened involuntarily and were full of disbelief.

He was a rank 9 warrior and the indestructible ‘Sphere’ condensed with the source strength of his whole body was about to be destroyed!?

At this moment, his body trembled even more. Without his fighting spirit, his ‘Sphere’ seemed even more fragile.

Boom–

With a dull sound, he remembered that Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear pierced again, directly piercing his ‘Sphere’!

Boom

And at this moment, another terrifying flame ball rushed down from the sea of fire in the sky.

It directly hit Lu Jian’s body!

“Ah!!!”

The terrifying temperature of the flame made Lu Jian feel as if his whole body was about to be cooked and he let out a scream.

But at the next moment, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand swiped directly and chopped off his head.

Without the slightest pause, Lin Xiu continued to attack the rest of the warriors.

The rest of the warriors were all rank 8 warriors. At this time, Lin Xiu directly used ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ and the ‘Sphere’ on their bodies was instantly shattered by Lin Xiu.

In just a few seconds, they were all killed by Lin Xiu.

Because of the ‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’ skill that he just used, he could still see that the surrounding area was like a sea of fire.

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and felt a little tired now.

However, there was one person who wasn’t dead.

“Ah!!!”

The old man let out a roar from behind and he was freed from the black dragon that bit his body.

He has a sinister look now and he looked like he was in a bad state.

“I want you to die! I want you to die!!!”

The old man roared loudly like crazy and a pattern on his forehead instantly emitted white light at this time, then it formed a huge and complicated pattern.

Source mark!

As soon as the source mark was released, there were endless flames emerging from it.

Attack-type Source Mark- ‘Nine Dragons Bathing in Fire’!

Those flames turned into terrifying dragon shapes and charged directly at Lin Xiu’s body!

This was his last trump card, that is, the power that only a warrior at the master warrior level could use.

Source mark power!

Moreover, his Source mark was also an attack-type Source mark, especially the fire attribute, which was also very powerful among the attack-type Source marks.

Boom

One after another terrifying fire dragon slammed into Lin Xiu’s body, then spun frantically, as if forming a terrifying tornado of flames.

At this moment, the entire mountain shook.

“Hehehe... he’s finally dead...”

The old man said to himself with a ghastly face.

There was also blood flowing from his lips. It could be seen that the battle with Lin Xiu just now also caused him a lot of injuries.

However, before he could celebrate, he saw a figure with a spear slowly walking out of the flame tornado. Originally, he was smiling wickedly, but his smile suddenly solidified.
