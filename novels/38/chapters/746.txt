Chapter 747: Thank You For The Experience

The sword burst out with terrifying fiery red energy, as it slashed from top to bottom, the surrounding air seemed to explode, making a loud noise.

And at the same time, the thin threads of energy controlled by the man in the cloak also seemed to appear around.

As long as Lin Xiu dodged Zhang Zhiheng’s blow, he would be attacked by these source threads.

“Humph!”

Looking up at this scene, Lin Xiu snorted coldly and he held on to the Dark Edge spear tighter.

The source strength in the body is running wildly, as if the blood in the whole body is boiling.

Zhang Zhiheng’s offensive looks strong, but in the eyes of Lin Xiu now, his offensive is simply... full of flaws!

“Let me show you what skills are.”

Lin Xiu held a spear in both hands and stared at Zhang Zhiheng who was charging down.

In the next moment, just as Zhang Zhiheng was roaring to kill Lin Xiu, the Dark Edge spear moved and directly drew a semi-circular arc.

‘Clean Sweep’!!!

Boom— nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

This sweep seemed ordinary, but the surrounding space has been torn apart!

A deafening sound rang out, causing the cloaked man’s pupils to shrink.

In an instant, he felt a huge shock in his heart and all the source threads that impacted Lin Xiu’s body were withdrawn at this moment.

Dang–

And the sword in Zhang Zhiheng’s hand was swept away in an instant!

Including his entire body as he slammed into the giant tree.

Pff—

Zhang Zhiheng, who flew out and broke several thick trees in a row, fell to the ground, his eyes widened and he vomited out a mouthful of blood.

How is it possible, how could there be such a terrifying power!?

/

He seemed to have forgotten the pain and his face was full of disbelief.

He focused the strength of his whole body to use this skill yet it was broken so easily!

“You...you got the inheritance there!?”

Seeing Lin Xiu coming with a spear, Zhang Zhiheng said unwillingly.

When he recalled that Lin Xiu also used ‘Freezing the Distance’ just now, he was even more convinced that Lin Xiu must have known about this inheritance when they entered the place previously.

“Inheritance? Haha.”

Lin Xiu sneered, there was no inheritance at all, it was just that the warriors at the peak of the Warrior King deliberately left such things and wanted to take the opportunity to seize away those who wanted to obtain the so-called inheritance.

“Thank you for the experience, goodbye.”

Lin Xiu looked at Zhang Zhiheng who was lying on the ground and said lightly.

“Damn...”

When Zhang Zhiheng heard Lin Xiu’s words and saw the killing intent in his eyes, he knew that Lin Xiu was definitely going to kill him.

At this time, he gritted his teeth and the source strength burst out and he was about to unfold the ‘Sphere’!

Just when his ‘Sphere’ was about to appear, Lin Xiu’s spear swept past.

Boom–

His ‘Sphere’ was instantly broken and the sharp Dark Edge spear directly split his head.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for killing a warrior and gaining experience 14674164567...”

As a series of experience prompts sounded, Lin Xiu knew that this person had been killed.

Clack clack——

At this moment, the ice and snow on the frozen warriors’ bodies also began to burst.

Those with relatively low strength had already died directly and only a number of rank 9 warriors could break free.

But even if they broke free, their bodies still felt extremely cold.

When they looked at Lin Xiu, they saw that in front of Lin Xiu, Zhang Zhiheng, the leader of their guild, had already died!

“President!”

Seeing this scene, their faces suddenly changed greatly.

“Kill him!”

One of the warriors was the first to react and roared.

Boom—

But before he attacked, he saw a terrifying flaming bird charging over!

The pupils in his eyes shrank abruptly and before the ‘Sphere’ was unfolded, the flames hit his body instantly.

“What!!!”

A wailing and a miserable scream came over and he frantically rolled on the ground. After a while, his whole body was burned into a charred corpse by the flames.

The rest of the people were shocked when they saw this scene.

But at this time, one after another, the flaming birds continued to charge toward them!

They turned pale with fright and their bodies hurriedly dodged.

And Lin Xiu seemed to have long known the direction they were going to flee. With a flash, he appeared beside them, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, killing them instantly.

At this point, all the members of the God’s Punishment Guild had been killed.

However, after killing so many people, Lin Xiu’s overall experience only increased by about 5%.

It seemed that now that he has reached the master warrior level, it was getting harder and harder to level up.

He looked to the front, except for the death of all the members of the God’s Punishment Guild, the man in the cloak was standing there as if nothing had happened.

Looking at Lin Xiu’s gaze towards him, the corners of his mouth curled up.

“What, next, are you going to deal with me?”

The man in the cloak said with a smile.

Lin Xiu didn’t answer his words and stabbed the spear out!

Swoosh—

In less than a second, the spearhead was about to penetrate his body.

But at this moment, his figure instantly disappeared, then Lin Xiu stabbed the air!

Where is he!?

Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly and when he turned around, he saw the man’s figure appearing behind him.

“The employer is dead and I won’t do this for nothing.”

He spread his hands helplessly and said.

“Why, you must kill me?”

But he looked at Lin Xiu who was full of murderous aura, raised his brows at this moment and continued to speak.

“What if I say yes.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Right now, Lin Xiu still had a strong murderous aura on his body.

Although this person’s strength was a bit strong, under the inspection of the analytic eye, he was also a peak master warrior.

As long as he worked with the system skills, it was not impossible to kill him.

It was just that his ability looked a little weird, which was a little worrying.

“If you fight me now with all your might to kill me, the outcome of our battle is probably 50-50.”

At this moment, the man in the cloak stretched out his five fingers and said lightly.

“I don’t have a big grudge against you. I don’t think it’s worth it.”

As he spoke, his body made a ‘bang’ sound.

Before Lin Xiu could react, his body disappeared, leaving only his cloak falling on the spot.

“Gone?”

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu’s brows could not help but wrinkle tightly.

But the man in the cloak was right, Lin Xiu was not sure that he would be able to kill this man.

Because Lin Xiu vaguely felt that he was stronger than Huangji!
