Chapter 460: Find the Energy Body

It was almost 10 million experience points!

This really shocked Lin Xiu.

He merely absorbed a little bit of those weird energy bodies yet he gained so much experience.

If he absorbed a little more, then it wouldn’t be too difficult for his level to rise again.

With this thought, after Lin Xiu suppressed the excitement in his heart, he reached out and touched the bright spots in front of him. Suddenly, the bright dots floating over quickly disappeared and were in Lin Xiu’s fingers.

Moreover, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the very comfortable feeling that came from his fingertips.

While touching the bright dots, Lin Xiu could clearly see that his experience bar was rising rapidly.

It has risen by 20 million!

Although it was still a long time before the upgrade, it still made Lin Xiu excited because there were a lot of these bright dots on the seabed here!

Lin Xiu didn’t care about the riots of the evolved beasts above. He looked at the front side and found that there were many bright energy bodies.

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate and swam over. The energy bodies emitting white light were quickly absorbed after Lin Xiu’s fingers touched them.

“Damn! Why are there so many evolved beasts!?” At the same time, on the beaches around the Sacred Region Academy, there were already a large number of Academy mentors participating in this battle.

Some powerful students from the upper grades also participated.

The wave of evolved beasts incident couldn’t be concealed at all and now the entire Sacred Region Academy knew about it.

“Brother Lin wouldn’t have gone out to kill those evolved beasts as well, would he?” Zhang Yin and others were on the rooftop of a tall building in the Sacred Region Academy at this time, looking at the boundless, large number of evolved beasts in the distant ocean.

At this time, not only Zhang Yin and others, but many students from the Sacred Region Academy were watching this horrible scene.

This scene was truly terrifying.

And the rank 9 flaming mysterious bird of the Sacred Region Academy was still spitting out terrifying flames.

Wherever the flame went, the evolved beasts turned into burnt corpses.

But even so, there was still a large number of evolved beasts, it was as if they were endless.

Although these evolved beasts were all around rank 6, it was really not difficult to deal with them individually, but if you faced a group of evolved beasts and you are not careful, you will be surrounded by these evolved beasts and attacked to death!

100 million experience! 100 million experience gained!

Lin Xiu, who was on the bottom of the sea, saw the progress shown on his experience bar, and was surprised.

Although this billion experience was only one percent of the experience required to level up, it was enough to make Lin Xiu happy.

This sea was so vast, there might be more energy to absorb.

With this thought, Lin Xiu continued to wander around.

But when Lin Xiu swam to the other side, he suddenly felt something, and the expression on his face suddenly changed.

Then, he instinctively took out the radar in his pocket.

A closer look – a bright spot has appeared on the radar!

Obviously, that energy body should be here!

It was very close to his position.

Lin Xiu quickly swam over there based on the area displayed on the radar.

Because of the riots of those evolved beasts, Lin Xiu, who was now in the water, felt that it was very difficult to even move forward.

Very quickly, while holding onto the surrounding rocks while swimming forward, Lin Xiu saw that there was a faint golden light on the front side.

And around this bright light, there seemed to be some evolved beasts biting each other like they were snatching that thing.

Found it!

Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up and his right hand clenched into a fist. At this time, his fist was covered in lightning.

‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’!

Lin Xiu walked over there without hesitation and simply punched the evolved beasts!

Bang bang bang——

As Lin Xiu waved his ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’, a dull sound continued to sound. At this moment, those evolved beasts died directly under Lin Xiu’s fist.

The energy body that the evolved beasts had been snatching fell directly on the ocean floor at this moment.

Lin Xiu swam over, then took the energy body directly.

He took a closer look and could clearly see this energy body emitting golden light.

This is a… stone?

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened at this time, watching this scene curiously.

At first, he was curious about what it was, but now that he looked at it carefully, Lin Xiu realized that this was a strangely shaped stone, and the stone, for unknown reasons, was emitting a faint golden light.

Lin Xiu, who was holding the pale golden light stone in his hand, seemed to have an unusual feeling.

This feeling was so strange that Lin Xiu couldn’t describe it.

After thinking about it, Lin Xiu still couldn’t figure out how it came about so he placed it directly into his pocket.

The stone was not big and fit into Lin Xiu’s pocket. ,

There was no place to put this radar watch. Lin Xiu thought about it and threw the radar watch directly on the bottom of the sea.

Now that this thing has been found, this radar was no use to Lin Xiu.

Mission… considered completed?

The intelligent robot was not found, which Lin Xiu was a little regretful about.

If he found the artificial intelligence robot, he might be able to find out why the artificial intelligence robot was holding this stone full of weird energy and created a space crack here. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Let’s look for those energy bodies first!

Lin Xiu just tasted the sweetness and now he is still searching for those tiny little energy bodies that emit white light.

Absorbing those energy bodies to gain experience was much faster than killing evolved beasts.

Because the experience gained by killing these rank 6 evolved beasts was only a few hundred thousand, and leveling up required 10 billion experience!

This was really a drop in the bucket for Lin Xiu.

Roar–

But at this moment, Lin Xiu suddenly felt a violent tremor in the bottom of the sea.

What is this!?

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted abruptly as he looked up and saw a huge figure!
