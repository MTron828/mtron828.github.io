1301 Double Cows Divine Spirits

Huang Fugu was still alive!

When Lin Xiu saw what happened, he couldn’t help but feel shocked.

His skills earlier was a god-level warrior skill. How could it be possible that it didn’t kill Huang Fugu?!

“Damn…”

!!

As the flames slowly disappeared, they could then clearly see Huang Fugu who appeared from within the flame.

His combat suit was toasted black, his skin and hair burnt to crisp and there was blood all over his body.

He looked completely hideous.

However, they could still feel that he had a strong will to live.

Even if he was injured, they weren’t severe injuries.

But….this man! How did he block that attack?!

Lin Xiu was indeed surprised but he didn’t show them publicly from his facial expression.

He grabbed onto his spear tightly. The source energy that he had just replenished started surging in his body.

Huang Fugu stared at Lin Xiu with a twisted expression on his face.

There was also a golden glow that appeared all over his body.

Boom boom – –

As the golden glow appeared all around his body, the entire place started shaking once again.

Soon, the glow gathered together and there was a huge figure of a cow seen!

The Divine Spirit!

Lin Xiu looked at him and his pupil narrowed uncontrollably.

Huang Fugu had his own divine spirit!

From the looks of it, it was definitely a red grade divine spirit.

“Go to hell!!!”

Huang Fugu’s eyes were filled with murderous intentions as he roared in rage.

The divine spirit instantly rushed towards Lin Xiu!

When Lin Xiu saw how the huge cow was headed toward him, the look on his face changed and he quickly activated ‘Flashing Souls’.

Xiu– –

As the divine spirit headed towards him, his entire body disappeared into the air.

“You’re dead!”

However, Huang Fugu knew where Lin Xiu would appear next. Lin Xiu looked up at Lin Xiu who was floating in the air.

Huang Fugu roared in rage and Lin Xiu suddenly felt that something wasn’t right.

He turned around and noticed that the huge cow had suddenly appeared in the air as well!

While he was in the air, it went straight for Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu didn’t have the chance to react in time and he couldn’t dodge the attack.

Lin Xie’s entire body was hit by the cow and he landed straight on the ground!

Boom – –

The entire ground shook vigorously and there was also a huge noise that followed.

There was a dent on the stage that was seemingly strong.

Lin Xiu’s body was inside the dent.

“Hmph! My divine spirits are the double cows!”

Huang Fugu rubbed off the blood that was at the corner of his lips as he spoke coldly.

When they looked closely, the one that hit Lin Xiu was not the one that started attacking in the beginning.

He has double cows as his divine spirits!

“That was indeed incredible!”

Wan Gan couldn’t help but exclaim when he saw what happened.

“He lost.”

Zhang Qinghua shook his head.

Lin Xiu had put up a good performance earlier but he was still a young man.

It was indeed rare for such a young man to have such skills.

However, Huang Fugu was too powerful and as expected, Lin Xiu would have died in the battle.

“City lord!”

Lei Chong stood up from his seat.

Lin Xiu was his life saviour! He was starting to feel a little agitated with how he had no idea whether Lin Xiu was dead or alive.

“Sit down.”

Baili Haoling glared at him before speaking to Lei Chong.

...

“But…”

“He’ll be alright.”

Baili Haoling said firmly.

Lin Xiu had been able to survive all the fights earlier with those powerful enemies. He managed to defeat all of them and this time, there will be no exception as well.

“Tsk tsk….you guys know the man from Lingxian City?”

One of the warriors that sat behind Baili Haoling and Lei Chong overheard their conversation and started speaking in an annoying tone.

“That boy is dead. He is fighting Huang Fugu and that man is no ordinary warrior.”

Before Lei Chong and Baili Haoling could say anything, the man behind them continued.

He was sure that Lin Xiu was dead.

“What if he won?”

Baili Haoling narrowed her eyes as she glared at the man behind her.

...

“If he won, I would eat up all the chairs here.”

The man scoffed.

“Remember what you said.”

Baili Haoling gave a cold reply. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“You can announce the result now.”

Huang Fugu, who was standing on the chair, looked over at the panel judges.

The stage that was incredibly tough was already dented. It was obvious that this man was dead.

“Wait.”

However, the judge shook his head.

Huang Fugu furrowed his brow. Just as he was about to speak, he felt a strong surge of energy coming from the centre of the stage.

He wasn’t dead?!

Huang Fugu’s eyes were fixed on the centre of the stage. From the dent on the stage, Lin Xiu’s body slowly levitated from inside.

As he took a closer look, he could finally see Lin Xiu clearly.

There was blood at the corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth. The Hao Yue Spear was still on the ground and Lin Xiu did not pick them up.

Plus, at the same time, there were dark particles that surrounded Lin Xiu’s body.

Those black particles looked incredibly horrid.

Huang Fugu’s face turned solemn.

His divine spirit did not kill Lin Xiu!

As he gathered his thoughts, both the cows that had disappeared earlier, suddenly appeared in the air once again.

Both headed straight for Lin Xiu!

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu stared at the cows that were rushing toward him but he did not look frightened at all.

Lin Xiu wanted to hide some of his skills but the attack earlier from Huang Fugu had made Lin Xiu furious.

“Lin Xiu isn’t dead!”

Lei Chong was getting excited as well.

Baili Haoling showed a cold smile.

The true battle was about to begin.

“Hmph! This brat would definitely be dead after this!”

The warrior sitting behind them let out a cold laugh.

He was sure that Lin Xiu would wind up dead.

As Lin Xiu’s body appeared from the dent, the black particles travelled everywhere.

Soon, a small black dragon appeared next to Lin Xiu.

However, Huang Fugu was not aware of it.

He was too focused on his own divine spirit and wanted to kill Lin Xiu once and for all.

Lin Xiu, on the other hand, was not bothered about the huge cows that were coming at him. He was ready to attack the cows who was getting closer to him!
