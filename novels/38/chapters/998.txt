Chapter 999: Attacking Lin Xiu

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Previously, Lin Xiu had been using his Analytic eyes and he knew that the Angel’s weakness was at the top of her head.

Usually, other than the creator himself, no one would be able to control the angel. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

However, as Lin Xiu got stronger and with the help of both the Analytic Eye and Engulf, he was able to hack into the Angel.

There was a possibility where he would be able to control the entire Angel’s system.

The Angel who was still trying to move earlier suddenly stopped.

Lin Xiu subconsciously let out a breath of relief when he saw what happened. Everything was going according to his presumption.

That’s when he slowly pushed his energy into the core of the Angel.

The system’s Analytic Eye and Engulf were both activated simultaneously.

As he continued to break down the core energy of the Angel, the system’s ability to engulf another party’s energy was working as well, taking it all into Lin Xiu’s body.

The progress bar started moving as well from 0.1%…..0.2%…

Gao Lin and the rest were staring at Lin Xiu from the ground and they couldn’t understand what was happening.

What on earth is that?

Why did the Angel stop?

At the same time, Wu Mei was looking at Lin Xiu with a confused look on her face.

But now, Lin Xiu was standing right behind the head of the angel, motionless and she didn’t know what to say.

All she could do was stand and wait.

“Brother, that fellow isn’t moving at all.”

Gao Lin turned towards Gao Chong, who was standing next to him.

Gao Chong and Gao Qiang were thinking about their next moves as well.

“Find the chance to get the Angel’s Tear.”

Gao Chong thought for a moment before telling his brothers.

As he looked at the Angel, it was obvious that she was no longer moving.

Lin Xiu had his eyes closed as well and they had no idea what was happening to him.

Ten minutes past and none of them moved by an inch.

“Go!”

Gao Chong hesitated a little but he was determined to do so.

He had to get his hands on the Angel’s Tears!

“What are you doing?!”

Wu Mei asked when she saw them moving towards Lin Xiu.

“Move!”

Wu Mei tried to stop them but with one sweep from Gao Lin, there was a large energy that hit her.

She was then thrown into the air.

As expected, landed on the wall behind her.

Pfft – –

Then, she spat out a mouthful of blood from the impact.

“You…”

“Shut up!”

Gao Lin sneered and all three of them leaped into the air.

Their bodies were floating in the air as they headed towards Lin Xiu.

As they took a closer look, Lin Xiu was still standing behind the head of the Angel and his eyes were closed. He was not moving at all.

Gao Lin and his brothers were determined about it.

“Should we…”

Gao Lin looked at Gao Chong and Gao Qiang and that’s when Gao Lin gave the signal to finish Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu might be powerful but from experience, Lin Xiu has already used up so many of his powerful skills which meant that he must have run out of energy by now.

If he was right, Lin Xiu should be exhausted now.

“Kill him.”

The look in Gao Chong’s eyes changed as he spoke to his brothers.

As soon as he was done, Gao Lin and Gao Qiang quickly attacked Lin Xiu!

As long as they killed Lin Xiu, they would be able to get the Angel’s tears.

Plus, Lin Xiu was in a very suspicious state. They have no idea when this guy would wake up once again.

You’re dead!

Gao Lin raised his machete and aimed it at Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

However, just when they were about to reach Lin Xiu, there was a large blast of energy that came out of nowhere.

It immediately threw Gao Lin’s body far far away.

Then, he landed heavily on the ground.

Pfft – –

Gao Lin spat a mouthful of blood.

His eyes were filled with disbelief as he stared at Lin Xiu, who was still floating in the air.

This fella…..isn’t he in a deep sleep….?

He looked at Lin Xiu once again and made sure that Lin Xiu’s eyes were still closed. Lin Xiu was still in the same position as before.

But now, he had his ‘sphere’ all around him!

Gao Lin and Gao Qiang were extremely shocked to see what had happened.

The ‘sphere’ that was around Lin Xiu was dark blue in colour.

The flame was indeed terrifying and the entire air around them was scorched because of the heat coming from the flame.

“Are you alright?”

Gao Chong looked down at Gao Lin who was on the ground and asked.

“I’m fine.”

Gao Lin slowly got on his feet.

He stared at Lin Xiu who was in the air and realised that Lin Xiu hadn’t moved at all. That’s when he started feeling frustrated.

“Gao Lin, aren’t you afraid that…”

“Why should I be afraid?!”

When he heard Wu Mei questioning him, he roared in rage.

“Can’t you see that there’s something happening to him? He’s in a coma now and we just have to take the Angel’s tears. It will be ours now!”

Gao Lin looked at the eyes of the Angel and screamed.

Lin Xiu was too powerful. If Lin Xiu got his hands on the Angel’s Tears, he would be able to keep it for himself. It would be impossible for them to have any chance to fight Lin Xiu.

But, they had a chance now. Something had happened to Lin Xiu and he was in a comatose state.

In this situation, it was their best shot at killing Lin Xiu.

Wu Mei was speechless as well after hearing what they said.

Gao Lin was right. If Lin Xiu was dead, they would be able to get their hands on the Angel’s Tears.

But…

“It’s despicable for you to do so!”

Wu Mei still stood up for Lin Xiu.

“Despicable?! Hmph!”

Gao Lin ignored Wu Mei and continued flying towards Lin Xiu.

“Brother, why don’t we get the Angel’s Tears first?”

Gao Lin was still in the air and his eyes were fixed on Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s eyes were closed and he looked like he was sleeping, completely motionless.

However, his ‘sphere’ was around him, protecting Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Gao Chong nodded his head.

That’s when he headed towards the Angel.

He took out a small box from his pocket while his eyes were still on Lin Xiu, who was standing right behind the Angel’s head.

Seeing how Lin Xiu wasn’t moving at all, he immediately opened the box and tried to touch the Angel’s eyes.

Boom –

Suddenly, the Angel started moving again!

She swung the pike in her hands and aimed it towards Gao Lin!

Boom – –

Gao Lin’s pupil shrank uncontrollably. He immediately released his ‘sphere’ as well.

His reflexes were considered quick.

But, when he released his ‘sphere’, the pike was also on it!
