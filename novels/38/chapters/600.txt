Chapter 601: Just Give Me About 10 Of Them

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Hearing this voice at this moment, Lin Xiu looked to the side instinctively and saw a man walking over.

He stared straight at Xiao Bai and his eyes lit up, as if he had seen some treasure.

“”Ah Qiu!

After Ouyang Hang sneezed, he looked at the man who was walking over and said with a sneer, “You want us to give it to you just like that? Who do you think who you are?”

However, because he had just been frozen into ice cubes by the cold air of the ice crystal white bird, he still felt very chilly.

This little ice crystal white bird looked small, but he didn’t expect it to be so powerful.

“Little sister, can I exchange something for this bird with you?”

The man ignored Ouyang Hang, stood directly in front of Baili Haoling and said aloud.

“Sure.”

Baili Haoling said with a smile at this moment, looking like a cute little sister.

But Lin Xiu knew that Baili Haoling was not such a person. She looked cute, but she was very dark-bellied.

Moreover, Lin Xiu knew that Dean Baili was very old, and Baili Haoling was probably old too but she still looked young. Except for the fact that she was so powerful that she could maintain her youthfulness, Lin Xiu couldn’t think of other possibilities that could keep her body young.

“Great.”

The man showed a look of joy. He didn’t expect it to be so easy. When he reached out to grab Xiaobai, Baili Haoling took a step back and dodged.

“There are conditions.”

Baili Haoling said with a smile.

“What conditions?”

The man looked at Xiao Bai and said aloud.

He recognized that Xiaobai was an Ice Crystal White Bird. Although he didn’t know how the Ice Crystal White Bird could be domesticated, this evolved beast is very powerful once it is an adult, so his gaze became even hotter.

Exchange it with odd crystals.”

“Okay, this is a rank 7 odd crystal. Previously, I and other adventure teams spent a lot of effort to get it.”

The man nodded, then took out a blue odd crystal and said.

Baili Haoling shook his head, “I don’t want this.”

“Then which one do you want, I’ll find it for you.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The man said quickly.

“Rank 9 odd crystals, just get me about 10 of them.”

Baili Haoling thought for a while, then said.

The man was about to nod his head, but he remembered that Baili Haoling was talking about the rank 9 odd crystal!

And she wanted a dozen of them!

“You’re messing with me!” The man said a little angrily at this time.

Not to mention dozens of rank 9 odd crystals, even one of them was probably something he would never be able to get in his life.

“En, you only realized it now?”

Baili Haoling said with a faint smile at this time.

“You...”

The man was about to vomit blood from anger.

“Zhao Qian, don’t embarrass yourself here.”

At this moment, a voice came from behind.

Several young men and women wearing the same uniform as this man walked over.

“Why are you guys here?”

At this moment, the man called Zhao Qian said with his eyes dodging a little.

“Go back.”

One of the men looked at Zhao Qian and said coldly.

Hearing the man’s words, Zhao Qian immediately left.

The man glanced at Lin Xiu and the others, and then left with Zhao Qian.

“Tsk tsk, how cocky ah.”

Seeing this scene, Ouyang Hang immediately sneered.

This person’s strength didn’t seem simple.

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao clearly felt that the man just now seemed to be a little stronger, and at this time they also frowned slightly.

The students who came to this warrior conference were the elites of the elites of various universities and colleges, and everyone’s strength should not be underestimated.

“Don’t worry, first place in this division is ours.”

Lin Xiu put his hands behind his head and pillowed in the air, looking very relaxed.

“Ours? Hahaha, did you hear what that person said, it’s hilarious!”

The ears of warriors were very keen. Some warriors nearby heard Lin Xiu’s words, and they all laughed.

Lin Xiu ignored the ridicule of these people, and then said to Xiao Bai who was standing in Baili Haoling’s palm, “Xiao Bai, let’s go!”

“Squeak!”

Xiaobai seemed to understand Lin Xiu’s words. The next moment, it flew to Lin Xiu’s shoulder, causing Baili Haoling’s eyes to widen.

She has never seen such an obedient evolved beast, and this evolved beast was an ice crystal white bird.

“What on earth did this bastard encounter? His strength has improved a little too fast.”

At this moment, Baili Haoling touched her little chin, and then muttered to herself a little thoughtfully.

She has the body of a young girl, but her actions were a little old-fashioned, and it looked very strange.

“He must be an old monster.” Ouyang Hang looked at Baili Haoling’s back, and then secretly slandered.

“Young man, who are you talking bad about?” But Baili Haoling seemed to have heard Ouyang Hang’s muttering, so she turned to look at Ouyang Hang and said with a strange smile.

Seeing Baili Haoling’s smile, Ouyang Hang suddenly shivered.

Tonight, everyone stayed in a hotel nearby, waiting for the audition the next day.

Lin Xiu was lying on the bed at this time, and Xiao Bai and Rollie seemed to be fighting beside him, which made Lin Xiu wonder whether to laugh or cry.

Taking out his mobile phone, Lin Xiu clicked on the contact number of Luo Yue that he had added earlier.

After thinking for a while, Lin Xiu clicked and edited the information.

After writing something, Lin Xiu felt wrong and deleted it again. After going back and forth a few times, Lin Xiu still sent a message: I will be there soon.

Just after pressing the OK button, Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief, and then said to himself, “I don’t know if she will see it?”

Di di di-

At this moment, a piercing sound was heard, and Lin Xiu sat up.

This was the alarm clock he set for 8 o’clock in the evening.

The time was up, and now he should be able to find out tomorrow’s battle information.

After landing on the website of the Warrior Union, Lin Xiu could clearly see the cover image of the World Warrior Competition on the website.

This event was the largest warrior conference in the world, with participants from all over the world.

It is said that some academies had warriors who returned from training in other planets to participate in the competition.

Lin Xiu didn’t look nervous at all, instead he was a little excited.

Di di di-

After tapping the entry card he got today on the computer, he could clearly see the battle information about his opponent.

“Changjia College.”

Lin Xiu raised his brows when he saw the name of the academy.
