Chapter 702 I Refuse

“Top 1 on the Honours Rank! Lin Xiu!”

With the loud announcement, Lin Xiu immediately opened his eyes while he was cultivating

Huuu – –

Back on the audience seat, people with black eyes and brown eyes were all cheering for him.

“Did you see him?! Brother Lin is an earthling! He’s number one!”

Lei Chong was beyond excited!

This was a proud moment for them. Ever since they arrived at Marqi planet, most of them from this planet had despised earthlings like them.

Isn’t this an insult to them?

“Congratulations.”

Qian Jin walked towards Lin Xiu and congratulated him.

“Thank you.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Congratulations on the victory.”

At the same time, the person-in-charge walked towards Lin Xiu as well.

“Come. Let’s head over there.”

Qian Jing said to Lin Xiu. Lin Xiu did not hesitate. He nodded his head and followed Qian Jing to the other side.

Since he had already won the match, the next thing that should happen would be the certificate for them to head to Fengyun City.

“Right. Looks like we have the top ten for this

year.”

One of the elders who seemed to be the leader of the group looked at the warriors before speaking to them as he gently stroked his beard.

“This is the pass for you to head to Fengyun City. We will be giving them to you now. I hope that all of you will be able to get a good result at the finals in Fengyun City.”

The elder gestured for the staff to distribute the pass. They came with the pass and gave them to the top ten warriors that won the match.

The pass was something like a card. It was made out of wood and as Lin Xiu took a closer look, he could see that there were high-end digital accessories attached to it.

“Also, the Xuanfeng Academy will be picking out a few new students for our school from the victors in this match.”

The elder announced it to the group.

“Really?!”

After hearing what the elder said, one of the warriors widened his head in surprise.

Fengyuan Academy is the highest ranking warrior academy in Fengyun City. It can also be said that they are the best. Most of the tutors there were master warriors, nothing less.

If they got the chance to study in that academy, it would be the best.

“En. All of you would be able to join us.”

The elder said arrogant.

“But…”

As he said that, he slowly turned his head towards Lin Xiu.

The rest of the crowd noticed that the elder was looking at Lin Xiu and the rest of them turned towards Lin Xiu as well.

From the past, the top 1 on the Tianlong List would be rewarded. Could it be…?

“Your information tells us that you’re from earth?”

The elder spoke to Lin Xiu. “That’s right.”

Lin Xiu looked at the elder and he didn’t seem frightened or pressured.

With the help of the analytical eye, Lin Xiu noticed that he could read the elder’s statistics. Lin Xiu could only assume that he was extremely powerful.

It may be possible that this man was a king warrior!

“Although you won the match today, you are still an earthling. According to the rules on our planet, you wouldn’t be able to join the Xuanfeng Academy.

The elder stared at Lin Xiu as he said flatly.

“What is that old man trying to say?”

Since the match was already over, the audience could gather around the stage. Lei Chong, who was now close to Lin Xiu, couldn’t help but frown when he heard what the elder said.

“I don’t know either. As the top 1 on the list, he is definitely qualified to join the academy. Why wasn’t he allowed?”

Chen Lan frowned as well.

“This old fella…”

Lei Chong clenched onto his jaw.

From the old man’s face, it was obvious that he was looking down upon Lin Xiu.

“But….if you become my disciple, I could bring you into the academy.”

The elder said arrogantly.

As for the rest of them, they started whispering and discussing about it amongst themselves. Most of them were envious of the opportunity that Lin Xiu had received.

This old man was an elder from the Xuanfeng Academy, if he became the elder’s disciples, he would have a bright future.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was not saying anything, the old man continued, “Get down on your knees and bow to me. You shall then be my disciple.”

The elder then looked at Wu Changkong’s family that were nearby and gently nodded his head.

He was related to the Wu family. Now that Lin Xiu had killed Wu Changkong, he obviously wouldn’t allow Lin Xiu to get away with it so easily.

He didn’t really want Lin Xiu as his disciples. He would first embarrassed him in public and once Lin Xiu became his disciple, he would torture him till Lin Xiu begged for mercy.

“I refuse.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

As soon as the words came out of his mouth, everyone else had their jaws on the ground. They were thinking of how big of an idiot Lin Xiu was.

This powerful warrior was accepting him as a disciple and Lin Xiu had refused the offer?! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Huang Ji’s face changed as he sneered and asked, “Are you sure?”

He had an ugly look on his face as this was the first time that anyone has ever rejected him in public.

“Do you know what the Xuanfeng Academy is?!”

“It is the best school on the Marqi planet. You earthlings….. HMPH!” As for the rest of them, all of them were silently judging Lin Xiu. “Sir Huang, please do not be angry. He is just an earthling.”

One of the men next to Huang Ji comforted the old man.

“Why did you reject him?” One of the middle-aged men asked Lin Xiu in an unfriendly manner.

Lin Xiu’s answer had definitely insulted the committee.

“Number 1, I already have a master.” Lin Xiu said flatly.

In his heart, the warrior that brought these cultivation techniques to earth was already his master.

Plus, he had already inherited his master’s power.

“Second, I would never get down on my knees.”

“That’s ridiculous. All you had to do was just bow. As a warrior, you couldn’t even do this. How do you expect yourself to be a strong warrior?!”

When one of the men heard Lin Xiu’s answer, he gave a cold laugh.

“The people of Hua Xia would never get down on their knees.”

Especially if it’s for the people on this planet. It’s such a joke.

Lin Xiu looked up at the man that questioned him and Lin Xiu’s eyes had a murderous intention in it which caused the man to shiver in fear.

“I’m sorry but I won’t be joining the academy as well.”

The situation was getting intense when another voice echoed in the room.

“Qian Jing, what are you doing?!”

When the middle-aged man heard what Qian Jing said, he frowned.

“I’m sorry but my family has already arranged another academy for me. Thank you for the offer, Sir.”

Qian King said apologetically.
