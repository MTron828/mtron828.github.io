Chapter 840: Horrifying Giant

CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

A scream came.

Raising his eyes and looking over there, he saw that the leg of one of the warriors was torn off!

“It...it’s resurrected!”

Taking a closer look, a giant on the ground actually woke up. After breaking the man’s foot, it raised its hand and continued to attack the man.

bang bang bang-

At this moment, the man was smashed by the giant’s hand.

The scene looked extremely bloody.

“I told you not to touch these things...”

Jiang Ying’s face was pale at this time.

The giants in these glass containers actually came to life!

“Hurry up!”

Chen Dong was also taken aback and shouted loudly.

“let’s go.”

Lin Xiu took Luo Yue’s hand and walked over to the base where they were at.

At one glance, it was clear that these were not ordinary human beings – there was a terrifying aura from their bodies.

Those warriors inside originally wanted to escape, but the transparent liquid that flowed out on the ground was very ‘slippery’, making it impossible for them to leave so easily.

And those giants quickly woke up at this time, then all attacked them.

“what!!!”

There was constant screaming.

When Lin Xiu and Luo Yue went to the base hall, they found that the door that they pushed open was actually closed again.

boom–

And just as Lin Xiu and the others wanted to leave, a warrior’s body flew out, hitting the big gate heavily.

In an instant, blood splattered everywhere.

Looking back, they saw those giants running out!

At first glance, these people look similar to ordinary human beings.

But they were tall and without reproductive organs.

There seemed to be no gender distinction.

Their eyes were dark blue and the pupils were red, which looked very strange.

“what should we do...”

Jiang Ying’s expression changed slightly when she saw this scene.

Chen Dong was covered in cold sweat and all these people actually woke up.

And the power from their bodies seems to be very terrifying.

Even a warrior at the King warrior level like him felt a lot of pressure.

Roar–

A giant let out a roar, then charged directly towards Lin Xiu and the others!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly, then holding the long spear in his hand, he directly attacked it!

boom–

The tip of the spear collided with a giant’s fist and a dull sound suddenly erupted.

His long spear could not directly penetrate it!

And Luo Yue looked at the giant that kept coming over and instantly unfolded a ‘Sphere’ to defend.

“Damn!”

In the current situation, there is no way to leave and Chen Dong has no choice but to unfold his ‘Sphere’.

boom boom boom —

Some warriors who escaped were also attacked by those giants at this time.

There was no way, in this spacious base, they could only fight those giants.

Lin Xiu kept attacking a giant, but the skin of these people seemed to be different from ordinary human skin.

Very tough, the spearhead of the spear had no way to penetrate their bodies.

And their fists bombarded, but they had extremely strong destructive power.

He looked to the front and saw the body of one of the warriors, which was directly smashed into flesh by the fists of those giants.

Lin Xiu frowned slightly, feeling the pressure.

Without the slightest hesitation, he directly activated the ‘Heavenly Array’.

Under the blessing of Heavenly Array, his power has increased a lot.

“Humph!”

Looking at the giants who were attacking him again, Lin Xiu snorted coldly and waved the spear frantically.

One after another flaming birds burst out.

Those dark blue flaming birds directly impacted the bodies of those giants.

If it was a warrior of the King warrior level, being directly impacted by this hellfire without the protection of the ‘Sphere’, the body would probably be annihilated at a speed visible to the naked eye.

But when these flames hit the bodies of those giants, they could only see the skin of these people, slowly turning black.

The skin of these giants was too tough and terrifying.

While Lin Xiu unfolded his ‘Sphere’ to resist the attack of these giants, he continued to wave the spear in his hand, forming a large number of flaming birds.

boom boom boom —

Soon, a large amount of hellfire covered the bodies of those giants.

“‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!”

Although the hellfire couldn’t kill it right away, but after the impact of the hellfire, in the next moment, the spear that Lin Xiu stabbed out could easily penetrate their bodies!

As their bodies were penetrated, a large amount of blue blood sputtered out.

But these giants still attacked Lin Xiu, as if they didn’t feel the pain.

Damn it!

Lin Xiu cursed secretly, holding the spear in his hand, he chopped off a giant’s head directly.

The giant’s huge body was then stopped.

Lin Xiu didn’t stop what he was doing at this time, he moved and continued to attack the giants.

boom boom boom —

After gaining experience in killing, Lin Xiu easily killed those giants.

Soon, the bodies of the giants all fell to the ground.

“Huhuhu.”

Chen Dong and Jiang Ying were lying next to the wall behind them, looking at the corpses of the giants lying on the ground with a hint of fear in their eyes.

The attacks of these giants were extremely powerful and their defenses were also terrifying.

He couldn’t move at all, even if he unfolded the ‘Sphere’, Chen Dong was a little dizzy from their punches.

“Are you hurt.”

Lin Xiu asked Luo Yue.

Luo Yue shook her head, just now she also took the opportunity to kill one or two giants.

Because after the hellfire released by Lin Xiu wrapped the giants, the tough and terrifying skin on their bodies seemed to be easily broken.

“All dead?”

He looked around, but found that the previous warriors were all dead.

Only Chen Dong and Jiang Ying were left.

The result was too tragic.

“Captain Chen, what are you going to do now?”

Lin Xiu looked over at Chen Dong and said lightly.

“Go back... get them to pull the boat back.”

Chen Dong took a deep breath, then stood up and said.

Lin Xiu nodded, then looked at the gate and found that there was no switch on the gate.

The gate has to be pushed open?

Standing beside this gate, Lin Xiu discovered that this gate can be pushed from both inside and outside.

With a little force, he pushed it open directly. Those bursts of lightning didn’t have much impact on Lin Xiu at all.

“I didn’t expect that so many people would die...”

After walking out of the underground base, Chen Dong said with a sigh.
