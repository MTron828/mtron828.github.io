Chapter 272: Black Iron Spider

Lin Xiu was shocked when he heard this weird sound.

He looked around but found nothing.

His surroundings were a bit dark and because the trees were also black, his vision was also hindered to a certain extent.

“What is this…?” At this moment, Qian Lin looked at the trunk of the tree in front of her and it looked swollen.

As soon as she spoke, that thing that was swollen suddenly moved and pounced directly on her!

It made a swishing sound.

Qian Lin noticed this and the pupils in her eyes constricted.

She froze and couldn’t react fast enough.

Bang–

But just then, a cold light flashed and the thing that pounced on her was directly cut in half.

Crash——

As its body was cut off, some blue liquid splashed all over the ground.

At this moment, the air exuded a slightly nauseating smell.

“Be careful.” Guo Ling stood in front of Qian Lin and waved the sword vigorously to shake off the blue liquid on it.

Qian Lin nodded, then looked at what was on the ground, the thing which was split in half by Guo Ling with a long sword.

The backs of these things were dark and reflective, just like the backs of those weird trees.

Taking a closer look, it looks like a spider!

“Rank 5 Black Iron Spider.” Lin Xiu walked over at this time and the moment he swung the spear out, he directly penetrated the Black Iron Spider.

The spearhead pierced through the bodies of these black spiders and it sounded like metals colliding.

It was definitely these spiders that made those weird noises just now.

The skin of these things was the same as the skin of these black trees. If they didn’t look closely, they wouldn’t notice them at all and would be attacked by these Black Iron Spiders.

“Again!”

At this moment, the swishing sounds became louder and louder. Qiu Li and others heard the sound and their expressions changed as they shouted.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and saw that a large number of Black Iron Spiders were rushing over from those trees.

Black silk threads were spat out of their mouths and they relied on the suspension of those silk threads to fly directly towards Lin Xiu and the others.

They were very fast!

“These things have poison in their mouths, be careful not to get bitten!” Although he saw a large number of Black Iron Spiders rushing in all directions, Guo Ling was still very calm.

The others heard Guo Ling’s voice and they became calm as well and dealt with the Black Iron Spiders that rushed over.

Lin Xiu was holding the Dark Edge spear in his right hand and triggered the flames to burst out from the spear.

The entire Dark Edge spear seemed to be surrounded by flames.

“‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers’!!!”

As the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand thrust out, the spearhead pierced out with the Red Lotus Fire.

Those Black Iron Spiders that flew over were easily pierced by the tip of Lin Xiu’s spear!

“Ding! Congratulations Master on killing the rank 5 Black Iron Spider and gaining 1,000,000 experience!”

“Congratulations Master on killing…”

Many system prompts kept ringing but Lin Xiu ignored them and continued to attack these Black Iron Spiders that were constantly rushing over.

Each spider gave him one million experience, ten of them meant ten million, and one hundred of them would be one hundred million experience!!!

And these things seemed to be afraid of fire so they were very easy to kill.

Lin Xiu constantly waved the Dark Edge spear and killed frantically.

Qiu Li and the others were surprised when they saw this scene. Lin Xiu’s speed of killing the Black Iron Spiders was terrifyingly fast.

It was at least twice as fast as them!

After some time, Lin Xiu was simply waving his spear madly and killing the Black Iron Spiders that were charging over.

Those Black Iron Spiders were like moths rushing to the fire and continued to fly towards Lin Xiu.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for successfully leveling up. You are level 26!”

Level 26 already!?

Lin Xiu was also slightly surprised at this time.

He only knew that he kept waving the Dark Edge spear in his hand and didn’t even think about how much experience he had gained.

And at this moment, the number of Black Iron Spiders had also decreased.

About ten seconds later, there weren’t any swishing sounds anymore and those Black Iron Spiders were all killed.

A strong burning smell came from the ground, causing Lin Xiu’s nose to wrinkle slightly.

At this time, Lin Xiu thought of the system prompt informing him that he had just leveled up, so he quickly clicked on the attribute panel in his mind:

Title: Rank 5 Warrior (Unused Titles: Rank 1 Warrior, Rank 3 Warrior, Rank 4 Warrior, Rank 5 Warrior)

Lin Xiu clicked on his attribute panel and the first thing he saw was the experience needed to level up.

Damn, 2.5 billion!!!

If he continued to level up like this, how long would he take ah?

If he killed these Black Iron Spiders, he would have to kill at least 250.

But there weren’t so many Black Iron Spiders obviously which Lin Xiu thought was quite a pity.

Otherwise, it was indeed a good place to gain experience.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and directly added all these potential points to his strength attribute.

As Lin Xiu became stronger and stronger, the Dark Edge spear that was difficult to hold before now seemed to become lighter and lighter like he couldn’t feel the weight anymore.

“They’re all killed, right?” Qiu Li and the others asked a little breathlessly.

The speed of these Black Iron Spiders was very fast, plus Guo Ling said that these things were highly poisonous and it would be troublesome if they got bitten.

So they got really anxious and couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief seeing that these Black Iron Spiders were not reappearing.

“En, there shouldn’t be any more.” Guo Ling looked around carefully at this time and said aloud.

She still glanced at Lin Xiu weirdly. Just now, Lin Xiu seemed a little strange.

He seemed to be talking to himself which made Guo Ling really curious.

“Which direction should we head towards now?”
