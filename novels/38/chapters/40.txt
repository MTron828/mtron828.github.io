Chapter 41: Infected Soldiers

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

At this moment, everyone looked over at the man.

Xu Wen walked to his side, then directly pulled his trouser up, only to find that there was a deep bite mark on his leg.

There was no doubt that he must have been bitten by a zombie just now.

“What are we going to do?” Li Yi panicked when he saw this.

If he was bitten by a zombie, the blood in its mouth or the virus in its saliva would enter his wound at this time.

It would cause infection!

The rest of the soldiers were stunned when they saw this and were at a complete loss as they looked at his wound.

“There’s no cure once you get infected directly,” Lin Xiu came over at this moment and said.

This was also one of the reasons why dealing with zombies was extremely dangerous.

Evolved beasts were still fine – the viruses mutate in the body, and even if attacked by an evolved beast, there was no risk of infection.

“No, there must be a way!” A soldier yelled.

His eyes were red too.

Who would have thought that a companion whom he was laughing and chatting with would become like this in a short span of time?

It was hard for them to accept this.

“Actually, there is a way. The source strength of a warrior rank 6 and above can eliminate the virus in the body, but…” Lin Xiu paused for a moment.

But you wouldn’t be able to find a warrior rank 6 and above here. No, not just this place, even in Xing Yao City, rank 6 warriors were rare.

And the virus developed very quickly. The virus would basically enter the brain of a rank 1 warrior within just 10 minutes, and by then, the warrior would become a zombie!

“Quickly, kill me!” Da Zhu gritted his teeth at this point and then roared at the crowd.

“I don’t want to... see myself... become a monster…”

Xu Wen and the others looked at him motionlessly.

The mood of the crowd became oppressive at this moment.

“Ah…” Da Zhu’s face contorted at this moment, and his veins were protruding out of his head.

His eyes were also gradually turning red.

It was clear that he was becoming a zombie!

“Hurry up... kill me…” Da Zhu seemed to be in a lot of pain at this moment, and his spit kept flowing out of his mouth. His teeth were turning sharp too.

“Roar!” In the next second, he broke free and was about to bite the nearest soldier.

That soldier’s pupils constricted, he couldn’t react fast enough and was about to be bitten by that infected soldier.

“Hurry up…” But at the crucial moment, Da Zhu seemed to regain a little sanity and gritted his teeth as he spoke.

Bang!

A silver spear pierced his head.

“He’s completely infected, and he used the last of his strength to stop himself from biting you.” Lin Xiu’s mood at this moment was also a little complicated.

This soldier’s willpower was so strong. If he didn’t control himself just now, that soldier would have been bitten.

Human nature has both darkness and brilliance.

“Da Zhu!” Having escaped death by a fluke, the soldier was stunned and his eyes were filled with tears.

Bang, bang, bang!!!

Just then, the shutter door over there seemed to have something knocking against it.

The sound was so urgent like something was about to break in.

“What’s going on!?” Xu Wen frowned and stood up, then went straight over there. Through the dark glass window, he could clearly see that there were over a dozen zombies gathered outside.

They looked sinister and were howling non-stop. Then, the shutter door was cut directly by a sharp claw.

That door was going to break soon, and the zombies were coming in!

“Roar!”

It appeared that a zombie had noticed Xu Wen’s shadow and was right in front of that dark glass window at this moment, constantly knocking against it.

Soon, the dark glass window began to crack.

“The zombies are coming!”

“What!?” The soldiers had been sitting on the ground, resting for only a short while when they heard Xu Wen’s words. They couldn’t help but stand up immediately.

They looked toward the dark glass window and saw more and more zombies coming round the window.

“Go, let’s go!” Lin Xiu frowned when he saw the scene.

Rank 2 zombies had a special characteristic of moving together. There might be only a dozen zombies right now, but when the fight began, there would be more and more zombies around, like what they just encountered.

When the others heard Lin Xiu’s words, they quickly went upstairs.

On the second floor, there was also a thick iron door. The second they all got up, Lin Xiu immediately shut it.

So even if those zombies caught up, the door could not be easily broken.

When those zombies didn’t see their shadows anymore, they would slowly disperse.

This building was very tall and quite old, coupled with the corpses upstairs, and the bloodstains that had dried up and stuck to the ground, the entire place looked a bit like a horror movie scene.

The higher they went, the more cobwebs appeared.

Squeak squeak squeak!

“What’s this noise?” Hearing this sound, a soldier could not help but swallow his saliva and asked.

Lin Xiu had goosebumps at this moment as well. There were a lot of cobwebs and strange sounds like there was something weird above.

“It can’t be mutated spiders or anything, right,” Li Yi smiled and said out loud.

The moment he said that, a dark shadow jumped down from the ceiling.

All of a sudden, it pounced on Li Yi’s back,

“Ah! What’s this, what’s this!” Li Yi felt something behind him and began to panic. His hands stretched to his back, then he realized that he caught something hairy and even had a few long legs.

Lin Xiu, who was standing behind him, was also startled. He really didn’t see this thing just now.

The Analytic Eye was activated automatically.

“Rank 1 Black Spider features: spiders that mutate due to nuclear contamination, characteristics: enormous and are slightly toxic.”

Just a rank 1 evolved beast. Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief and took out his long spear. He pierced the spider’s head and tossed its body to the ground. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Thank you…” Li Yi turned around and was relieved to see this scene.

It really scared him just now.

“Shhh!” Lin Xiu made a hush gesture at this moment because he found that there were more and more strange noises, and the noises were getting louder and louder, as if those things were getting closer and closer.
