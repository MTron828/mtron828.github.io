Chapter 495: 【Absorb】

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“What skill card, even silver wouldn’t be that expensive right…” The man still thought that it was unbelievable.

After all, it was only a silver skill card and it was unbelievable that it could bid for several million Union coins.

“This silver skill card is called ‘Absorb’, it is a skill that can absorb the source strength of other warriors!” The man looked at him like he was a hillbilly and explained.

“Although it can only absorb a little, it is an uncommon skill card after all. It is considered rare so of course, it is expensive.”

“Ten million!”

At this time, a man put up a hand and called out.

As he called out, everyone looked at him.

Was he crazy? He was going to spend 10 million Union Coins for a silver skill card?

“‘Absorb’? Is this skill so magical…” Lin Xiu, who had very good hearing, also heard what they were saying at this time.

“It’s true.” Luo Yue looked ahead and saw the silver skill card in the man’s hand.

“We want it.”

Before Lin Xiu could say anything, Luo Yue walked over, then spoke to the merchant who was bidding on this skill card.

As soon as Luo Yue said that, everyone looked at her.

There was a look of shock in their eyes.

What a beautiful woman.

But there wasn’t any smile on her face, she looked a bit cold.

“Young lady, I’m paying 10 million Union coins and you simply said you want it?” The man who had just paid 10 million Union coins looked at Luo Yue and said with a sneer.

“Haha, this is 10 million Union coins, can you offer more?” Some men also laughed at this time.

In the eyes of these people, Luo Yue did seem to stand out and didn’t look like an ordinary person but she wouldn’t be able to fork out 10 million Union coins so easily, right?

“Or you could spend a night with me, I’ll fork out 1 million Union coins for you.” A middle-aged man who looked a little fat said with a smile at this time.

It was the first time he saw such a beautiful woman and his heart was itchy.

“Hahaha!”

Hearing his words, the people around all laughed at this moment.

Boom–

But at this moment, the middle-aged man felt a sharp pain in his stomach. The powerful force directly caused his body to fly out, knocking the wall behind which smashed apart and his entire body seemed to be embedded in it.

“Clean your mouth.”

Lin Xiu was standing where the middle-aged man was just now, with his foot still raised.

It was clear that the man was kicked out by Lin Xiu.

“Courting death!!!”

Seeing this scene, the fat man’s men came to their senses at this moment and they all rushed towards Lin Xiu!

These people were all warriors and they also held long knives and swords in their hands and were about to cut Lin Xiu!

“Humph!” Lin Xiu sneered when he saw those who attacked. He moved slightly and dodged the attack of the first attacker. With a backhand punch, he knocked him out and the man was sent flying far away.

Looking at those who continued to attack, Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate at all and continued to swing his fists. In less than a few seconds, all of them were knocked out.

This scene made everyone around him dumbfounded.

That middle-aged man was a well-known bully in this ‘black market’; his strength was also around rank 3 and the weakest of his subordinates were around rank 2.

But what they didn’t expect was that they would be so easily knocked out by Lin Xiu.

The strength of this young man... was about rank 4!?

With this thought, the faces of these people became nasty. The people who laughed at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue just now kept quiet.

“I want it.” Luo Yue said indifferently to the boss at this time.

“This…” The boss saw that Lin Xiu was so powerful and was a little scared.

He thought about it and recalled that if Lin Xiu causes trouble in the black market bidding, there would be someone who would come and deal with Lin Xiu. At that time, even if Lin Xiu has the strength of a rank 4 warrior, he would still have to suffer the consequences.

With this thought, he heaved a sigh of relief, then said sternly, “According to the rules, this is for bidding. This gentleman bids 10 million.”

“Yes, if you can’t take out 10 million immediately, this skill card is mine.” The man chimed along at this time.

But now his tone had obviously become more cautious and he dare not say anything more.

“15.” Luo Yue said lightly.

“15 million Union Coins!?” When the people around heard Luo Yue’s words, there was an uproar.

Nobody expected that this young girl would say that!

“Are you able to afford it!?” The man who bid 10 million Union coins looked at Luo Yue with a grim look.

He was about to get this skill card but Luo Yue suddenly appeared and gave him a kick, which immediately made him furious.

Luo Yue glanced at him like she was looking at an idiot which made him even more irritated.

“I’m paying 18 million!” The man gritted his teeth at this moment.

Although it was beyond his budget, it was still affordable.

It was 18 million Union coins! This was painful.

“Thirty million.” Luo Yue said lightly.

“Is she crazy!?” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The rest of the people were shocked. They did not expect that Luo Yue would buy this silver skill card at such a high price.

At this time, the surroundings were silent and everyone’s eyes were on Luo Yue.

The holder of that card was in disbelief at this time. He originally wanted to put it up for bidding just to make some money but although this ‘absorb’ skill is very strong according to the description of the skill, but in actual combat, it couldn’t absorb much of the other party’s source strength. It was a rather useless skill card.

“I…” The man’s eyes widened. At this time, he wanted to say something but he couldn’t say it. If Luo Yue said 20 million Union Coins, he could continue to fight for it but he didn’t expect Luo Yue to say 30 million directly, which was beyond what he could afford.

“Give it to me.” Luo Yue glanced at these people, then said faintly.

In the next moment, she took out her mobile phone and used it to directly swipe 30 million Union coins to the boss.

“You have so many Union coins?” Lin Xiu whispered while looking at the dazzling zeros displayed on Luo Yue’s phone.
