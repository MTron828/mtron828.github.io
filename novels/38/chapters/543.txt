Chapter 544: Almost rank 7

Just like before, they were steel needles.

And these needles were very dense and fast!

Dang dang dang-

Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand and swept away all the steel needles.

Looking at the front, he could sense that there was someone hiding there.

Hng!

Lin Xiu snorted coldly, then the figure rushed over instantly!

Those men hiding in the shadows who used special bows to attack Lin Xiu, their eyes widened, obviously did not expect Lin Xiu’s speed to be so fast.

But before they could react again, blood holes appeared on their foreheads.

“Ding!” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Congratulations Master for killing a rank 5 warrior and gaining 12,000,000 experience!”

This time, when the system sounded again, Lin Xiu realized that he had just killed these warriors and seemed to have gained a lot of experience.

And after checking the information that was ignored before, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

“Damn!”

He just killed the top rank 8 Green Dragon and actually gained more than 20 billion experience!

Because he was busy escaping before, Lin Xiu didn’t look at it. Now, when he looked at the system prompt, Lin Xiu was a little dumbfounded.

“This means that I should be levelling up soon!”

As long as he goes up one level, he would be able to reach the level of a rank 7 warrior. At that time, all his attributes would be substantially improved.

And it was very likely that a new system skill would be acquired.

After being excited, Lin Xiu continued to look at the corpses of the warriors who had been killed by him on the ground.

“Who are these people…”

These people are wearing uniform black battle suits and their weapons were all this special bow and crossbow.

Don’t underestimate this kind of crossbow, the steel needles it shoots can penetrate even the branches of these hard, iron-like trees.

And the steel needle seemed to be poisoned, so if one got shot, the consequences would be dire.

“Are they just here to get Odd Crystals?” Lin Xiu used the Dark Edge spear to pick at one of the men’s backpacks and tore through his backpack. In the next moment, a large number of Odd Crystals fell out of the backpack.

These odd crystals were mostly rank 5 and 6 order heteromorphic and sixth-order. Although for the current Lin Xiu, they weren’t very useful but it was still better than nothing.

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu stretched out his hand and grabbed those odd crystals then simultaneously activated the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

With the operation of Lin Xiu’s ‘Cultivation Technique’, those odd crystals quickly changed from different colors to transparent crystals at a speed visible to the naked eye.

And Lin Xiu, who absorbed this large amount of different crystal energy, felt that every part of his body seemed to be filled with powerful energy.

He seemed to be full of vigor.

“Hu.” Lin Xiu stood up comfortably, stretched, and continued to walk forward.

Now that these warriors have appeared here, it was very likely that there were others ahead.

Moreover, Lin Xiu clearly felt that if he continued to walk forward from this forest, he should be able to walk out.

However, at this moment, Lin Xiu, who has a good ear, began to hear rustling sounds.

There are more people!?

When he looked to the front, he saw a group of people running towards him.

It seemed to be a group of young warriors, but the faces of these people looked a little pale.

“Run! Run quickly!”

The man in front looked distraught at this time and shouted loudly while looking back.

When the man ran to the front, he saw Lin Xiu who was looking over and was immediately startled.

The people beside him were also stunned at this time. They didn’t seem to think that there were still people here.

These people quickly held their weapons and looked at Lin Xiu over there with a wary expression.

“Brother, are you the one who killed these people?” The man who walked to the front was with his men and initially wanted to just bypass Lin Xiu and walked directly to the other side.

But when he saw the bodies of the men behind Lin Xiu, his gaze suddenly changed and he said subconsciously.

“Yeah. Lin Xiu nodded and glanced at these people. There were both male and female and they looked quite young.

Under Lin Xiu’s Analytic Eye, he found out that these people were rank 5 warriors.

“I advise you to leave quickly, those people will soon catch up.” At this time, the man glanced at Lin Xiu with a dreadful look, then said aloud.

“Lin Lang, don’t talk anymore, let’s go.” A man looked at Lin Xiu, then tugged at Lin Lang’s clothes and said aloud.

Although he felt that Lin Xiu looked very young, for some reason, Lin Xiu had a dangerous aura.

“Where are you going?”

At this moment, a voice could be heard and soon, a group of people appeared from all directions.

An encirclement was formed in an instant.

And as Lin Xiu glanced over, he could clearly see that these people were wearing the same kind of black combat suit.

They should be in the same group as those who had just been killed by him.

And these young men and women originally wanted to escape, but when they saw themselves being surrounded, their expressions suddenly changed.

“The rank 8 odd crystal, hand it over.”

A man in a black battle suit and holding a huge sword, looked at the young men and women in the middle and said indifferently at this time.

Rank 8 odd crystal?

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but be surprised. The rank 8 odd crystal was rare, how did they get it?

Did they also kill a rank 8 evolved beast?

“Impossible! We found it!” The man called Lin Lang stood in front and said aloud to the man.

“What’s in Thunder Valley is ours.” The man said with a sneer.

And at this time, the surrounding warriors, holding those strange bows and crossbows, all aimed at Lin Lang and the others.

“You guys are all going to die anyway. We can just take it from you then.” The corner of the man’s mouth turned up, revealing a hideous smile.

Hearing his words, Lin Lang and the others saw that the bows and crossbows held by the people around were aimed at them and their expressions changed greatly.

These crossbows didn’t look vintage. The steel needles that shot out were made of a special material and the penetrating power was really terrifying.

“We are students of Sacred Region Academy.. If you dare to kill us, the people of our academy will not let you go!”
