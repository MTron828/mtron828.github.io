Chapter 504: Perfect Rescue

What the hell is happening here?!

When they saw the bright light, Zhao Xia subconsciously covered his eyes as well with his arm.

“A rank 6 warrior?!” The man standing next to Zhao Xia was a warrior as well and there was a surprised look in his eyes.

A rank 6 warrior?!

Zhao Xia was stunned as well when he heard what the man said.

Although Lin Xiu did show his powerful skills previously, the zombie that Lin Xiu killed was an easy target. Plus, he had never paid attention to Lin Xiu’s terrifying skills. He always assumed that Lin Xiu was just a rank 4 warrior and the zombies that he killed weren’t that scary as well.

But, after hearing what the man next to him said, Zhao Xia was shocked.

“Young Master! We have to go!” The man suddenly looked concerned and serious. Before Zhao Xia could say a single word, he started dragging Zhao Xia out of the scene.

As for Lin Xiu, his left arm was still wrapped around Ye Shuanger’s waist and he held onto the Dark Edge with his right hand. He leaped and instantly went towards the balcony on the other building.

This balcony was where Ye Shuanger’s mother was at.

As for the man who was right next to Ye Shuanger’s mother, he immediately threw the fire torch onto the dry woods, causing a huge flame.

Lin Xiu placed Ye Shuanger on the ground and dashed towards the man opposite him!

“You’re dead!” The man saw Lin Xiu’s powerful leap. When Lin Xiu landed on this balcony from the other building, he was shocked as well but he soon came back to his senses, grabbed onto his weapon, and was ready to fight Lin Xiu who was heading towards him.

But, Lin Xiu was faster since he had already activated ‘Shadow’. They couldn’t even touch Lin Xiu’s body when Lin Xiu had already punctured a bloody hole on their foreheads.

Boom — Boom – Boom – –

The dull sound continued and there was a huge hole that appeared on the warrior’s head.

Those that were pierced by the spear, laid on the ground with their eyes opened wide. Till the very last minute that they were alive, they had no idea how they could have been eliminated this easily.

There were about a dozen of them on the balcony and Lin Xiu had defeated all of them within seconds.

Lin Xiu turned towards Ye Shaung’er’s mother who was in the burning flame and with a blink of an eye, he was able to rescue her from the flame.

Since it was only a brief moment and the fire wasn’t as huge which was why her clothes were not burnt at all.

Lin Xiu lifted Dark Edge and broke all the ropes that were tied around her body.

Then, he removed the tape that was placed on her lips.

“Hurry! Save your uncle…” Ye Shuang’er’s mother said in fear.

From the looks of it, it was obvious that she was in a lot of shock.

Lin Xiu nodded his head. He looked back on the other building and noticed that Zhao Xia and his men had already disappeared!

Damn it!

When he saw what happened, Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank subconsciously.

But, he had no time to waste. He made a huge leap and landed on the other balcony.

As for the warriors on the last balcony, they immediately ran out of the building as soon as they saw Lin Xiu.

The man who held onto the torch immediately threw it towards the woods that were beneath their hostage and started to run.

All of them saw clearly with their eyes how powerful Lin Xiu was as he was able to kill all of the warriors with a headshot within seconds.

This terrifying ability was shocking.

“Run?!” Lin Xiu frowned. He didn’t chase after them. Instead, he held onto the Dark Edge with both his hands and swung it in the air, releasing the flaming birds that instantly flew towards them!

It was as if the flaming birds had eyes because they were all chasing after the warriors that were trying to escape!

Koong Loong – –

When the flaming phoenixes collided with these men, there was a loud noise that rang throughout the area.

All of them were completely toasted by the birds and had turned into ash-black corpses.

These were warriors of rank 3 and rank 4. They were too weak for Lin Xiu, and they didn’t have much experience as well.

Then, Lin Xiu quickly ran towards Ye Shuang’er’s father and when Lin Xiu got him out of the flame, he finally let out a breath of relief.

“Lin Xiu, is that you?” Ye Shuang’er’s father, Ye Qingshan asked in a soft tone.

He just had a major surgery a while ago and got kidnapped. His entire body was throbbing in pain.

“It’s me.” Lin Xiu smiled.

Ye Qingshan’s condition was now much better since most of his bones had already been fixed and the effect of the restoration fluid was working magically.

But, it would still take a few more days before he completely recovers.

“I’m alright. I can still walk.” When Ye Qingshan saw that Lin Xiu wanted to help him, Ye Qingshan shook his hands.

Lin Xiu nodded his head and then waved towards Ye Shuang’er and her mother, telling them that everything was fine now.

“I’ll bring you over.” In order to prevent anyone of Zhao Xia’s men from ambushing them, Lin Xiu grabbed Ye Qingshang and brought him to the balcony where Ye Shuang’er and her mother was at.

“Dear, are you alright?” Ye Shuang’er’s mother burst into tears when she saw Ye Qingshan.

“Dad!” Ye Shuanger was a little shocked as well.

Seeing how their family was now safe and sound, Lin Xiu felt relieved as well. The situation earlier had been extremely urgent but luckily, the men that Zhao Xia brought were of lower ranks. In conclusion, Lin Xiu was glad that everything ended well.

“Lin Xiu, we owe you for saving our lives. I can’t believe that you have become so strong after not seeing you for just a year or two…’

“Brother Lin Xiu…..” Ye Shuang’er looked at Lin Xiu with her eyes filled with gratitude. Other than that, the admiration in her eyes grew and just as she was about to say something, Lin Xiu smiled and said, “It’s nothing.”

“Let’s get back to the hospital. Uncle Ye still has to rest.” Lin Xiu continued telling them.

When they heard what Lin Xiu suggested, Ye Qingshan nodded his head as well. All of them were in shock because of this incident and it wasn’t safe for them to stay here.

Soon, all of them reached the hospital.

“You should leave quickly.” As soon as they got to the lobby, the surgeon who helped Lin Xiu with the surgery suddenly walked towards them and told them nervously.

“What’s wrong?” Lin Xiu frowned.

Ye Qingshan has not completely recovered and he should still be in bed rest. It would be better for them to stay in a hospital if anything were to happen to him.

“The Deputy Dean has already given the orders that all of you are not allowed here and the Chen family has been looking for you. It is extremely dangerous now in the hospital.” The surgeon was afraid of Lin Xiu as well which was why he immediately told Lin Xiu what he knew.

“His bones have been fixed and we have given him the best resolution fluid. Look at how he is able to ambulate now. It may hurt a little but he should recover completely within a few days.”
