1283 Trouble?

“How did you know that we are being targeted by the Black Demons?”

Lin Xiu stared at Xiao Jian and continued asking.

“They….they have a mark on their neck.”

Xiao Jian, who was still being lifted by Lin Xiu, started feeling nervous.

!!

He was scared that Lin Xiu might attack him again.

“A mark?”

Lin Xiu was stunned.

Baili Haoling and Lei Chong overheard the conversation and they were both shocked as well.

They quickly pulled out the phone and took a photo of their neck.

Then, they noticed that there was a faint black mark on their neck.

If they didn’t look closely enough, they wouldn’t have noticed it as well.

“When did this appear?”

Baili Haoling’s pupils narrowed subconsciously.

She didn’t even realise that there was a mark on her neck!

Baili Haoling rubbed her neck and noticed that it was impossible for her to remove it.

Lei Chong noticed the same mark as well. He desperately wanted to get rid of it and noticed that there was no way of rubbing it off.

“This….what is this?”

There was a mark that suddenly appeared on his neck and it could not be removed; even if it was anyone else, they would be frightened as well.

“Don’t worry. It shouldn’t affect any of you.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

This was because Lin Xiu noticed that these peculiar marks on their neck wouldn’t do any harm to them.

If it did cause harm to them, they would have been injured much earlier.

“Am I right?”

Lin Xiu turned and asked Xiao Jian once again.

“Yes….you’re right!” Xiao Jian quickly nodded his head.

He was frightened by just Lin Xiu looking at him.

Xiao Ren was still looking around as if he was looking for an opportunity to run away.

However, if he did so, wouldn’t that be betraying his own brother?

Xiao Ren thought about it and started feeling hesitant. He remained on the same spot and totally forgot that he wanted to escape.

“Right. Do you know what this mark is for?”

Lin Xiu continued asking.

“It’s by the Black Demons. Those from the Black Demons must have attacked you earlier and planted these marks on your necks. They will then be able to locate you with these marks.”

“Why is it that there isn’t one on him?”

Baili Haoling’s eyes were wide as well as she pointed at Lin Xiu. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

If she had guessed correctly, when they were at the hotel, they were attacked by a huge wave of energy and this must have been done by those from the Black Demons.

However, Lin Xiu encountered the same thing as them. Why was there no mark on him?

“Those who are stronger….would not be affected…”

Xiao Jian gulped as he made the explanation.

There was a smile on his face but he looked incredibly hideous.

He didn’t think that they would meet with someone as powerful as him.

They must have missed it!

Xiao Jian was feeling remorseful toward his actions.

“The marks will only last for more than 24 hours. You don’t have to worry too much…”

Xiao Jian looked at Lin Xiu as he continued saying.

Lin Xiu was someone who looked unfriendly and Xiao Jian was really afraid that Lin Xiu might kill him.

Therefore, he was telling them everything that he knew.

“If that’s the case, it would be nothing.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu looked at Baili Haoling and Lei Chong before speaking.

Then, Lin Xiu threw Xiao Jian into the air.

As Xiao Jian fell to the ground, he let out an exaggerated cry.

The pain that he was feeling almost killed him.

Lin Xiu looked at the sight and his mouth twitched.

...

Warrior gods have sturdy bodies. Forget about being thrown onto the ground, even if he was thrown against a wall, it wouldn’t cause him much pain.

This man was indeed a joke.

“Brother! Please don’t die on me!”

Xiao Ren was still wondering if he should be running away.

He stared at the scene ahead and ran toward Xiao Jian. Then, he started crying as if his father had died.

Lei Chong was in awe when he saw the show that they had put up.

Warrior gods were usually arrogant. Why would they act like idiots? It was just …

That would be an insult to their intelligence!

“Let’s go.”

Baili Haoling was speechless as well. She wasn’t interested in beating them up on her own.

As the three of them headed back to their rooms, Baili Haoling would still subconsciously touch the mark that was on her neck.

...

Although these wouldn’t do much damage to them, she still felt that it was a little uncomfortable for something to be found behind her neck.

It felt uncomfortable.

Lei Chong felt the same as well.

“If I guessed it correctly, these people would be coming for us tonight.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he said softly.

“They will be coming for us tonight?”

Lei Chong was shocked.

Although they didn’t really need sleep since they were already at such a level …..

They would still be exhausted if they had to stay up the entire night.

“Should be.”

Lin Xiu casually answered.

“It’ll be great if they appeared.”

Baili Haoking wet her lips. It would be best if they came so that she would have the opportunity to kill them.

Plus, while she was resting in the afternoon, there was someone who knocked on her door. However, when she tried to find out who it was, Baili Haoling was filled with rage.

By the time they returned to the hotel, Lin Xiu noticed that there was a large number of warriors headed to the highest ground.

“There’s a huge training ground upstairs.”

“There are lots of warriors cultivating there.”

Lei Chong whispered next to Lin Xiu.

This was what he overheard in the afternoon.

He didn’t think that most warriors would still head upstairs when it was already late at night.”

“En. I heard that the entire floor is a training ground.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Why don’t… we check it out?”

Baili Haoling looked interested as well.

“You guys can take a look at it. I’ll head back to my room first.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head. When the floor hit the 100th floor, Lin Xiu walked out of the elevator and bidded goodbye.

Boom boom boom – –

However, as soon as he stepped out, Lin Xiu heard a peculiar noise.

It wasn’t loud but for Lin Xiu, it was obvious enough for him to realise what it was.

Plus, the sound seems to be coming from the corner up front…

“It sounds like Rollie and Little Bai.”

Lin Xiu’s pupil narrowed and he quickly ran into his room.

Xiu – –

Lin Xiu moved at an incredible speed and immediately appeared before her room.

This was because he left Rollie and Little Bai inside the room before he left and now it was obvious that something had happened.
