Chapter 790: An Ruo

He took the time to feel what was going inside his body. The strength inside his body still has not recovered from last night and his entire body still felt weak and light.

He subconsciously entered into the system inside his mind. Lin Xiu could see that his EXP progress bar was about 60% filled.

He has already absorbed the king grade odd crystal and it still wasn’t enough for him to move to another level...

Lin Xiu felt a little depressed,

However, since he has already moved up a lot of levels previously, it was getting harder for him to level up.

“Fatty, when are we leaving for Fengyun City?”

When he came out of his system, Lin Xiu asked Liu Pan.

“There’s about a month before the match. It should take about 2 weeks for us to reach there.”

Liu Pan thought about it before saying it to Lin Xiu.

“Hmm...”

Lin Xiu thought to himself that he may be stronger now but it still wouldn’t be enough to fight any of the king warriors.

Plus, he wouldn’t be able to use ‘Rage’ all the time.

This was because if he didn’t kill the other party before ‘Rage’ ran out, he would be in big trouble.

“Right. Qian Ling and An Qi, would you like to learn my warrior skills?”

Lin Xiu thought about it before asking An Qi and Qian Ling.

“Of course!”

When they heard what Lin Xiu asked, their eyes lit up with hope. They could no longer hide the excitement on their faces as they quickly nodded their heads.

The way that Lin Xiu had been using his spear was interesting as they have never seen such a warrior skill.

“Do you have a ‘warrior skills card’?”

Lin Xiu asked the both of them.

The card that Lin Xiu was referring to now wasn’t the usual ones that they used. It was one where it was empty with no information on it.

“I do.”

An Qi nodded her head and said, “Give me a minute. I’ll get it.”

Lin Xiu looked at An Qi as she jogged off and he couldn’t help but chuckled.

The apprentice system wouldn’t be as easy as this.

Lin Xiu also noticed that after taking them in as his apprentice, their information was in his system as well. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Other than their names, there was another progress bar.

That was peculiar as he had no idea what it was.

“Yo? You’re the guy called Lin Xiu?”

Just when An Qi left, another man walked into the room and asked for Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu turned around and saw a man who was dressed in luxurious clothing. His face looked similar to An Qi and was pointing at Lin Xiu with a spear in his hand.

“An Qi’s brother, An Ruo.”

Qian Ling said softly to Lin Xiu.

“An Ruo, why does it sound like a girl’s name?”

Lin Xiu was stunned as he said subconsciously.

“You brat! Who were you referring to as a girl?!”

An Ruo had excellent hearing and when he heard what Lin Xiu said, he was glaring at him in anger.

If one took a closer look, he did look beautiful. If he had female clothing on, he would definitely be a beauty as well.

“I heard that my sister and Qian Ling are apprentices of yours in order to learn to fight with a spear. From my point of view, you’re nothing.”

An Ruo was still pointing out his spear to Lin Xiu as he said in a cold tone.

“An Ruo...”

Qian Ling wanted to say something but An Ruo spoke instead, “Qian Ling, get out of the way. I will reveal this scammer first. With a warrior like him, how is he good enough to be your master?”

When he arrived yesterday, he met Lin Xiu who had already passed out. Plus, Lin Xiu had already activated ‘Disguise’ and therefore he could feel that Lin Xiu wasn’t that strong.

With those abilities, he ended up being a master for both An Qi and Qian Ling.

However, from his perspectives, Lin Xiu was just a liar who was good with his words.

“Let’s try it out then.”

Liu Pan looked at An Ruo and said in a teasing manner.

This was because he knew that Lin Xiu had a special ability of hiding his skills. By just feeling it, no one would be able to tell the truth.

“Hmm...would you like to try it out then?”

Lin Xiu smirked as he asked the other party.

“Hmph!”

An Ruo sneered and with the spear in his hand, he immediately thrusted it towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu remained motionless on the same spot and when the spear from An Ruo was about to reach him, Lin Xiu’s spear suddenly appeared in his hand and he blocked the attack that was coming from An Ruo!

Clang – –

With a loud, clear noise, the spear in his hand fell out of An Ruo’s hand.

The look in his eyes changed.

This was because he felt it clearly that Lin Xiu’s abilities were weak!

If the warrior had a deeper source energy, their abilities and source field would be much stronger.

He could clearly feel that the movement of the source energy around Lin Xiu was mild but from that small attack just now, it was obvious that Lin Xiu had a really strong energy.

Before he could react, Lin Xiu’s spear was already coming towards him!

“Hmph! Dirty little tricks!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu’s spear was coming towards him, An Ruo sneered. Just as they were about to have a close combat fight, he realised that the spear from Lin Xiu had suddenly splitted into hundreds of spears!

The air around them was suddenly filled with lots of explosive noises.

Initially, he thought all of these spears were just figures but he didn’t think that these spears were real. This was what gave out all the explosive noises in the air.

‘Yuan’!

An Ruo had no other choice. He screamed internally and he had to release his ‘Yuan’!

All the spears that came from Lin Xiu landed on top of his ‘Yuan’.

Although he managed to block them with the ‘Yuan’, the spears were so strong that it was pushing An Ruo backwards.

His strength was too strong!

Koong Loong – –

At the next moment, there was a loud explosive and his body was immediately blown to the back.

His body was thrown all the way to the back and he was prepared to block any more attack from Lin Xiu but then he realised that Lin Xiu did not continue.

“You lost.” Lin Xiu stood on the ground and said bluntly.

“What do you mean?”

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, his expression changed and asked him.

Lin Xiu did not say anything and only gave him a look with a touch on interest in his eyes.

An Ruo felt himself being provoked. Just when he was about to move, he realised that there were cracks all over his ‘Yuan’.

What one earth is happening?!

When he realised what was happening, his pupil shrank uncontrollably.

Could this be...

As he calmed down, he suddenly thought of Lin Xiu’s attacks.

It looked as if he had blocked all of the attacks with his ‘Yuan’ but at the same time it was his ‘Yuan’ that took all the impact.

If he continued fighting, there was a possibility that his ‘Yuan’ would shatter into pieces!
