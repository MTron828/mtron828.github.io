Chapter 878: Who Tortured Who?

Hearing his words, the group of warriors who were detaining them suddenly stopped.

“What exactly do you guys want?”

Looking at the eyes of these people staring at him, the look in Qian Feng’s eyes changed.

“The Zhao family? Ao Shuangcheng’s Zhao family.”

One of the men with a bald head but a long black beard stared at Qian Feng with a strange smile.

“That’s right, this is Miss Zhao from the Zhao family!”

Qian Feng snorted coldly.

He thought that these people were already scared when they heard him claiming his identity, so he couldn’t help saying coldly.

The words were full of pride.

Zhao Xiaoqing’s expression changed slightly at this time.

When Qian Feng said this, it is very likely to have the opposite effect. You must know that these people seem to be desperados. Even if his family has a certain influence in Aoshuang City, it is not necessarily that these people will be afraid.

“Ah, very good.”

The bald-headed long-bearded man touched his beard at this time, then gestured to a man around him with his eyes.

......

“If you know each other, put down the knife obediently and escort us back, maybe I can spare your lowly life...”

At this time, Qian Feng said proudly.

boom–

Just as Qian Feng finished speaking, a warrior next to him waved the sword in his hand and slashed at Qian Feng’s neck!

Still proud, Qian Feng was completely unprepared and was directly cut to the neck by this man with a sword.

boom–

With a dull sound, the head fell to the ground, spattering with blood.

One of the warriors behind Qian Feng was splashed with blood all over his face.

He opened his eyes wide and his eyes were full of horror.

He didn’t think that these people would kill if they wanted to, without showing any mercy. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“You are all from the Zhao family, right?”

The bald-headed long-bearded man glanced at them and said with a strange smile.

Hearing the man’s words, the expressions in the eyes of the surrounding warriors could not help but tremble.

Their legs were shaking.

“Don’t...don’t kill us...”

Hearing the man’s words, one of the warriors’ legs softened and fell to the ground directly.

He was too frightened to speak.

“She... She is the direct descendant of the Zhao family. If you go to her, you should be able to use her to obtain some of the Zhao family’s property...”

Another man pointed at Zhao Xiaoqing and said with a trembling finger.

Hearing the man’s words, Zhao Xiaoqing’s face reddened.

His eyes were full of embarrassment.

He had no idea that these people would say such words at this time.

“Oh? Is that so?”

The bald-headed long-bearded man said with a strange smile on the corner of his mouth.

“How about I give you guys a chance to live.”

He seemed to have thought of something, glanced at the people around him and said lightly.

Hearing his words, the eyes of these men showed surprise.

“You guys, give her to me.”

The bald man showed a grim smile, pointed to Zhao Xiaoqing over there and said.

“You dare!”

When Zhao Xiaoqing heard his words, her face suddenly turned pale, but she still gritted her teeth and said angrily.

The men also hesitated at this time.

To dare to do such a thing to the little princess of the Zhao family is simply courting death.

The people of the Zhao family will definitely not let them go.

But if they don’t do it now, they will be killed directly like Qian Feng.

“Miss Zhao, it’s not our fault.”

These men looked at Zhao Xiaoqing at this time and there was a green light in their eyes.

“You, whoever dares to...”

Zhao Xiaoqing was also completely panicked at this time. With her pale face, the source of her body was about to be mobilized.

She would rather use her source power to explode herself than be defiled by these people.

“Who is there!”

At this moment, the long-bearded man seemed to sense something, his eyes suddenly widened and he shouted angrily.

With a wave of the right hand, a wind blade formed by the source energy directly charged towards the front!

Boom—

Suddenly there was a loud noise from the front.

A huge rock was directly cut off by the wind blade he released.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s figure also appeared directly on the other side.

“who are you?”

The long-bearded man looked at Lin Xiu, who had avoided his wind blade and appeared on the other side and said suddenly.

It’s him!?

Zhao Xiaoqing and the others were stunned when they saw this sudden change.

She looked to the front and found Lin Xiu’s location.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

Originally, he didn’t intend to meddle in other people’s business. The lives of these people have nothing to do with him.

He just didn’t expect that the long-bearded man’s sensing ability seemed to be good and he actually knew where he was.

“Passer-by.”

Lin Xiu spread out his hands and said a little helplessly.

“Passer-by?”

A strange look appeared on the face of the bald man with long beard.

“What a passerby huh.”

“Kill him.”

He glanced at some of his subordinates around him and suddenly said aloud.

“okay.”

Hearing the words of the long-bearded man, several of his subordinates said aloud.

They grinned and walked towards Lin Xiu from different directions.

“Let me think, how should I kill you?”

“Do you want me to dismember your body, or cut your flesh off one by one?”

One of the men looked at Lin Xiu, licked his lips and said.

His eyes were full of killing intent.

“I think it’s better to just split this kid’s head in half!”

At this moment, a man holding a huge sword sneered and charged towards Lin Xiu!

The huge and sharp sword was about to split Lin Xiu’s head in half.

But at this critical moment, a crisp sound rang out.

Dang–

The sword in his hand actually broke into two halves!

And at the next moment, the head of the man holding the sword exploded into two halves.

Just like what he just said, but it wasn’t Lin Xiu who had his head split in half.

It was him.

how can that be!!!

The other two men who came up from behind wanted to kill Lin Xiu, their eyes widened at this time and their eyes were full of disbelief.

At that moment, they didn’t even know what happened!

“Mr. Lin, save me!”

Zhao Xiaoqing was surprised when she saw this scene and said quickly.
