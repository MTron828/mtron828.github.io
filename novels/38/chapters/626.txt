Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Once again, there was another warrior that had been killed on this stage!

As if history had repeated itself, all five warriors from the same academy had been killed!

“Those from the Sky Academy….they’re bullies!”

When the students from the Smark Academy saw how their teammates had been killed, they got furios as well.

“Hmph, just a bunch of kids from the academy. Why would you challenge me?” Nan Huang sneered. He did not look flustered at all after killing so many of them.

Luo Yue looked into the distance as if she was thinking of something.

The announcer was soaked in cold sweat as well. He didn’t know how to react but quickly said, “The match is over! The winning team is the Sky Academy!”

Although they had just won the match, the audience did not cheer for them. Instead, all of them kept quiet.

The students from the Sky Academy team had immediately killed students from the other academy without mercy and this had caused most of them to feel unhappy with the Sky Academy.

As for the rest of them who were contestants, all of them turned pale as well. That team was too powerful and they would almost always annihilate the entire opposite team. This was a huge impact for a lot of them.

“Those from the Sky City are so strong.” Huang Zhen said as he and Qian Yao frowned their brows in worry.

“We’ll be the one who will be facing them next. Are you afraid?”

Baili Haoling looked at them and laughed.

“Of course not.”

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao shook their heads. Instead of feeling scared, they were feeling excited. For warriors like them, they would feel challenged whenever they met with warriors who were almost the same level as them or those who were even more powerful than them.

The next few rounds were not as horrible as the first one and they incredibly entertaining.

The audience got excited as well as they cheered.

“Next up, we have the Sacred Region Academy against the Second team of the Sky Academy!”

“Let’s welcome the Sacred Region Academy!”

The announcer stepped onto his flying gadget and was announcing it out loud.

Most of them have not heard of Sacred Region Academy since they had remained low key all along. Therefore, as Lin Xiu and his team stepped onto the stage, there weren’t many cheers from the audience.

As for those from the Sky Academy, they jumped onto the stage and stood on the opposite side of the stage.

“So, it is you.”

Zhuo Qixing was looking at Lin Xiu who stood right in front of him and there was an evil look in his eyes that he could not hide.

“So what?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and asked in return.

“Today, your life ends here.” Zhuo Qixing gritted his teeth as he spoke. His words were filled with hatred.

“Get them! Kill them all!”

Zhuo Xiqing tilted his body to his side and told the rest of his teammates.

His teammates obviously noticed that there was something off about Zhuo Qixing as well.

They have heard of the news where Zhuo Qixing had only returned to Sky City after being badly injured by a man from the Sacred Region Academy. Perhaps…. The person who did it was the man standing right opposite them?

“Match Start!”

At that moment, the announcer who was flying around the hall with his gadget announced the start of the match.

Zhuo Qixing quickly moved his body and dashed towards Lin Xiu!

No one knew what Zhuo Qixing had been learning lately but he was moving at an incredible speed. As he dashed towards Lin Xiu, he wanted to kill him in one shot!

Lin Xiu did not hide as well as he rushed forward!

Clang clang clang – –

Their weapons finally collided with each other!

Then, two other men from the Sky Academy who were holding onto machetes, started running towards Lin Xiu as well.

They wanted to help Zhuo Qixing with defeating Lin Xiu.

“Hmph! Fight us instead!”

Qian Yao and Huang Zhen immediately moved and blocked the attacks that were headed towards Lin Xiu.

Ouyanga Hang didn’t want to be left behind as well. He grabbed onto his sword and swung it towards his enemy!

Xiu xiu xiu xiu— –

Ouyang Hang’s movements were combined as one with his sword and as he moved around on the stage with his sword, there were loud explosions that rang through the hall as their weapons collided.

“I will kill you!!!!!!”

Zhuo Qixing, who was fighting Lin Xiu, suddenly shouted.

He moved his sword and a terrifying sword aura was coming towards Lin Xiu from above!

Lin Xiu predicted his movement and dodged the attack. At the same time, he pierced his spear forward!

‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers’!!!!

The Dark Edge was now glowing with a bright light. As he combined it with his skill, the spear instantly turned into hundreds of bright rays!

Clang clang clang – –

Zhuo Xiqing was moving his sword around like a mad person, trying to block all the attacks from Lin Xiu!

Even so, at this time, he could feel his body turning numb.

As he took a closer look, he realised that there were electrical arc all over his body.

When Zhuo Qixing got distracted by the electrical arc, there was a bright light that appeared right in front of him and then he saw the spear that was coming towards him!

Clang – –

Zhuo Qixing tried to stop it with his sword but the impact was too big. He had no other choice but to take a few steps backwards.

Before he could steady himself, Lin Xiu’s figure had already appeared behind him!

Boom – –

Lin Xiu grabbed onto his spear with both arms and swung it! With a soft groan, Zhuo Qixing had been thrown far away.

He was about to fall off the stage butu at the very last minute, he managed to hold himself by the edge of the stage.

“Damn it...”

Zhuo Qixing clenched his jaw as he stared at Lin Xiu. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

How is it possible that Lin Xiu’s ability suddenly improved so drastically?

He was a rank 8 warrior himself but as he fought Lin Xiu, he still felt that he wasn’t strong enough.

“You’re dead!!!!”

Zhuo Qixing was completely filled with hate. He screamed as he picked up his sword and instantly, his entire sword turned white as well!

An immense amount of energy had been exerted onto the sword!

What was that?

When Lin Xiu saw what was happening, he frowned as he could feel that the sword had turned into something terrifying.

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu moved his legs and activated the skill ‘Disappearing Without A Trace’ and headed towards Zhuo Qixing! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

As he rushed towards his enemy, his spear moved as well and it turned into a dark red hue. All of a sudden, there were hundreds of flaming birds that headed towards Zhuo Qixing!

Koong Loong — –

As the flaming birds targeted Zhuo Qixing, it landed on the ground beneath his feet and the entire ground shook.

The stage was now surrounded by a sea of fire!
