Chapter 469: Luo Yue Is Sick?

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

When Luo Yue found this thing in Lin Xiu’s pocket previously, she was in disbelief. At this time, when she heard Lin Xiu’s words, she came to her senses and shook her head.

“I do not know.”

“I see…” Lin Xiu was a little regretful, thinking that Luo Yue knew what it was.

However, Lin Xiu was still very curious as he held the golden light-emitting object in his hand. What is the function of this thing?

He recalled the artificial intelligence robot holding this thing, it seemed to be doing something, then there was a space crack – Lin Xiu became more and more curious.

Lin Xiu tried to absorb the energy of this thing, but this thing was obviously different from the odd crystal and there was no way of absorbing it.

Nevermind.

Lin Xiu shook his head, then put the thing in the box again.

“By the way, Luo Yue…” Lin Xiu raised his head at this moment and was about to say something to Luo Yue but when Luo Yue made eye contact with him, she felt something and quickly turned and walked to the other side.

Lin Xiu was taken aback. What’s wrong with her?

Meanwhile, Luo Yue had already returned to her room, lying on the bed, her eyes looking at the ceiling and she didn’t know what she was thinking.

“Am I sick…” Luo Yue put her right hand on her chest at this time, feeling her heartbeat, and mumbled to herself.

She thought of Lin Xiu’s figure and she didn’t know why but she didn’t feel herself anymore.

She reached out and touched her forehead and cheeks, they felt a little hot, especially when she thought of Lin Xiu looking at her.

Is it a fever? 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Luo Yue had never been ill and didn’t know what was going on at this time.

“This girl.” And Lin Xiu, after placing the thing with the special energy body properly, he held the Dark Edge Spear and sat in the spacious hall.

As soon as his mind was activated, Lin Xiu entered his system interface:

Level: 31

Experience value: 0/15 billion

Strength: 655

Physique: 309

Speed: 169

Skills: Analytic Eye, Fury, Disguise, Engulf, Mirror Image, Heavenly Array

Rage build-up: 0/100

Potential points: 31

Title: Rank 6 warrior (Unused title: Rank 1 warrior, Rank 2 warrior, Rank 3 warrior, Rank 4 warrior, Rank 5 warrior)

He actually leveled up!

This was beyond Lin Xiu’s expectation and after unlocking the Rank 3 gene lock, his attribute point also increased a lot.

31 potential points...

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then directly added to his speed, making the speed 200 points.

Looking at these neat numbers, Lin Xiu, who has a little obsessive-compulsive disorder, felt very comfortable.

He took a closer look. There were two lottery draws, but Lin Xiu didn’t want to use them now. He had to wait for more draws in the future and draw consecutive draws at a time so perhaps that would allow him to get better prizes.

After returning to reality from the system interface in his mind, Lin Xiu took out three diamond skill cards from his pocket.

Except for the one he got from Dean Baili’s office last time, the remaining two were received from the last mission.

Of the three, only one was a diamond skill card of spear art.

He had no choice, there weren’t many spear-type skills and the collection of spear-type skill cards in Dean Baili’s vault was small and they weren’t very powerful.

These three skill cards were spear-type skill cards ‘Thousand Thunder’.

This skill was a diamond skill. When swinging a spear, it will produce a thunder-blast effect and the entire spear will be filled with lightning and when concentrated on the opponent, it can cause a paralyzing effect.

It was a very useful skill for Lin Xiu, who could turn his source strength into lightning.

The two skill cards that were collected today were fist technique skills, ‘Heaven Split’. Just by looking at the name, you know it was very domineering.

The power of this fist technique was very great, but the difficulty of cultivating was correspondingly very high.

The last one left was the footwork skill card, ‘Flaming leg’.

Looking at the three diamond skill cards, Lin Xiu took a deep breath and began to put them on his forehead one by one.

With his own source strength surging to communicate with the skill card, Lin Xiu’s brain soon felt a lot of information pouring into his mind.

At this time, Lin Xiu couldn’t help squeezing his hands tightly and his teeth clenched.

The diamond skill card contained too much information so when absorbing the knowledge in the skill card, Lin Xiu felt that his head was blowing up.

But this feeling passed in a flash. Soon, Lin Xiu opened his eyes and his eyes lit up.

“It seems that I chose the right one. These three diamond skill cards are very good for me!”

Feeling the skills’ information in his mind, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but stand up excitedly.

Without hesitation, he practiced the skills directly according to the information in his mind.

Since knowing that Luo Yue was from Sky City and was as strong as the warriors there, Lin Xiu was under a lot of pressure.

He wanted to set foot in that city.

Not simply set food but have a place in that city!

“Dean, this kid, is he still keeping something from us huh?” At the same time, in the office of Dean Baili, a middle-aged man was sitting next to him at this time.

“What is he keeping from us?” Dean Baili looked at the data in his hand, then looked up at the man and said with interest.

“I don’t know.” The middle-aged man was taken aback by Dean Baili’s question, then shook his head.

“It’s just that, I just think this kid has something to hide.” When he said this, his face was still doubtful.

He didn’t believe that what happened below was so simple. This kid definitely encountered something and kept it from them.

“Well, even if he doesn’t tell us, that’s his choice.” Dean Baili smiled.

“By the way, this intelligent robot, how’s it doing?”

“We still don’t know how did this robot appear here but I found a related piece of news.” Speaking of this, the middle-aged man seemed a little excited.

“Oh? What is it?” Dean Baili was also curious.

“Dean, do you know about the E99 area?” The middle-aged man said.

“En, I’ve heard that the iceberg over there has melted.” Dean Baili nodded, of course he was up-to-date about current affairs in various places.

“We have someone over there who seemed to have seen the figure of this artificial intelligence robot…”
