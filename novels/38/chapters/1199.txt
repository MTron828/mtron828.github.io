1200 Time to Rest

Lin Xiu nodded slightly, then reached out to take the two boxes.

Just when his hands held the two wooden boxes, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly.

Because Lin Xiu clearly felt the weight brought by these two wooden boxes.

It’s really heavy…

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but sigh.

“Thank you.”

Lin Xiu smiled lightly.

he also took a special look at Fu Tianling’s side.

Fu Tianling just wanted to let Lin Xiu come to power and let other warriors kill him.

But what he didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu even killed Sun Qi.

At this time, looking at Lin Xiu, Fu Tianling’s face turned gloomy.

His eyes were full of murderous intent.

“Just take it, you won’t last long anyway.”

Fu Tianling sneered at this moment, and walked straight to the other side with his sleeves.

But Lin Xiu really didn’t care.

If he dared to cause trouble again, he would just be giving Lin Xiu experience.

But now that there is Fu Tianyuan here, Lin Xiu can’t do anything.

This Fu Tianyuan’s strength is very strong.

Even the analytic eye can’t analyze him at all.

“City Lord Lin, amazing.”

As Lin Xiu jumped off the stage, both Sun Ruo and Ling Yu couldn’t help speaking out.

Sun Qi, although he is a younger generation of warriors, even they dare not say that they can handle it.

And he even formed the Divine soul.

Lin Xiu smiled and didn’t say anything.

Thinking of the divine soul power Sun Qi showed just now, Lin Xiu was still a little surprised.

This thing really increases the strength of a warrior too much.

“This Divine soul is really weird.”

Baili Haoling couldn’t help but sigh at this time.

If it wasn’t for this Sun Qi possessing divine soul power, Lin Xiu would have dealt with him long ago.

“Divine Soul, the symbol of a powerful warrior.”

Ling Yu couldn’t help touching his beard at this time, and said with a smile.

One of the very important reasons for these city lords to come here is to observe those divine soul engravings and form their divine soul power.

“Everyone, the time to observe the engraving of the divine soul is tentatively scheduled for three o’clock in the afternoon. When that time comes, you can gather here again.”

At the same time, Fu Tianyuan’s voice came from the other side.

“The accommodation has been arranged for everyone, everyone can rest well.”

As soon as his words fell, the staff in Manhuang City began to hand over door cards to the warriors from various towns.

At the back is the largest hotel in Manhuang City, built by the people of the City Lord council.

After Lin Xiu took this card, he and Baili Haoling left here with Rollie and Xiao Bai.

“Handing these two little guys back to you to take care of. I’m going to sleep first, I’m sleepy.”

As soon as Baili Haoling finished speaking, he opened the door opposite Lin Xiu’s room and closed it.

Lin Xiu smiled helplessly and closed the door of his own room.

“I fell asleep like this…”

Looking at Rollie and Xiao Bai on the floor, Lin Xiu said to himself.

Looking at the two wooden boxes on the floor, Lin Xiu sat cross-legged on the floor.

What kind of skill card is in this box?

Lin Xiu was still looking forward to it. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Best would be spear art, swordsmanship is fine too…”

Lin Xiu opened the two boxes while talking to himself.
