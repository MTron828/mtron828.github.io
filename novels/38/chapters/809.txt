Chapter 810: Fenghua Street

This area looked very much like those abandoned areas.

The exterior of some of the buildings here were much older compared to the ones in Fengyun City.

There were some metal highrises that were already rusted and they looked ancient.

However, even when they were old and rusty, there were still lights inside the buildings.

Plus, there were also shadows walking in these rooms.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu parked his motorcycle in the distance and started walking.

“I don’t think I will be joining you.”

Qian Jing gulped as he said to Lin Xiu.

“Are you scared?”

“No, I’m not!!”

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, he felt a little embarrassed and got angry.

“That’s because…..because there are things that I have to take care of.”

“Hmmm….you’re scared after all.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

In the end, Qian Jing followed Lin Xiu. If he were to leave now, he would definitely be looked down upon by this man.

As they went into the area, there were lots of warriors walking around.

There were different types of warriors around but most of them were covered with a murderous aura.

These men were used to surviving in these dark areas.

The entire area was crowded and it looked like a dark market.

“Fenghua Street, Number 18...”

Lin Xiu was looking around to search for the place and that’s when he noticed an isolated building amongst the rubbles.

“It’s here.”

Soon, Lin Xiu stopped in front of a tall building that was already filled with bushes.

As he looked to the side, there was an old number plate.

There were lots of algaes all over the plate.

It looked really old.

“This is it?”

Qian Jing looked at the building and asked Lin Xiu.

“En. That’s what he said.”

“Do you dare to go in with me?”

Lin Xiu looked at Qian Jing and gave a cheeky smile.

“Why….why wouldn’t I?!”

Qing Jing looked at the eerie situation around him and the look on his face changed almost immediately.

When he walked into the area, he could already feel that there was something odd about the air around this place.

All of the warriors here were filled with the same aura as well.

Plus, there were all really powerful warriors as most of them were master warriors.

Both of them were at the door when the lights inside the dark building suddenly lit up.

A bright light suddenly entered Lin Xiu’s eyes.

“Hey. You’re here?”

It was the same voice that came from the other end of the phone call.

When he took a closer look at the room, there was a middle age man who was sitting on a chair.

He was surrounded by lots of warriors, standing on both sides. All of them were looking at Lin Xiu and Qian Jing who had just arrived.

As they stared at them, Qian Jing could feel a terrifying aura coming from them.

This caused chills running down his entire body.

These men…..it was obvious that they were scary even with just one look.

As for Lin Xiu, it was the total opposite as he looked like he wasn’t affected at all.

“Where is he?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Lin Xiu stared at the men before him and narrowed his eyes as he asked.

With the analytical eye, he could clearly see all of the names and stats of these men.

The leader amongst them was called Zhao Nian, he was at the peak of a warrior master.

The rest of them were master warriors as well and they were strong.

It was as expected since there were so many warrior masters here in Fengyun City.

But, it was still a rare scene to see so many of them gathered together.

Clap clap – –

When Zhao Nian heard what was demanded, he clapped his hands twice and the ceiling above them opened.

Then, Fatty’s body fell from the city.

Suddenly, his body was tied onto the ceiling with a rope.

So, his entire body was hanging mid air.

There were lots of wounds all over his body.

“Let him go.”

When he saw what happened, Lin Xiu had the intention to kill.

“Lin Xiu…. quick…. Leave...”

Liu Pan tried his best to open his eyes. Although his visions were blurred, he could still recognise that it was Lin Xiu.

“Where’s the money?”

Liu Pan asked bluntly.

Xiu – –

Lin Xiu took out a card from his pocket and threw it. The card flew from his hand and went towards Zhao Nian.

Bakk – –

Zhao Nian caught the card and threw it to a warrior standing next to him.

“Take a look.”

“Yes, Sir!”

There was indeed a hundred million instead of the card. This was the money that Lin Xiu got in exchange for a high rank odd crystals when he was on his way here.

The man quickly confirmed the amount and signalled it to Zhao Nian.

“Are we done now?”

Liu Xiu asked flatly.

“Sure.”

Zhao Nian clicked his fingers together. Then, the rope that was tied to the fatty suddenly snapped and Liu Pan immediately fell onto the ground.

“Are you alright?”

Lin Xiu walked over and quickly pulled out the rest of the ropes that were tied around him.

“I’m fine...”

Fatty shook his head, gritted his teeth and wanted to stand up on his own.

Lin Xiu noticed that his entire body was covered with injuries.

They were quite serious as well.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was trying to help Liu Pan stand, Qian Jing quickly said to them, “Let’s get going.”

It was obvious that these men aren’t nice people. Although they lost a hundred million, they would still be able to earn it back in the future.

For high rank warriors like them especially, it shouldn’t be too hard for them.

“En. Take him back first.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and smiled.

Although he has no idea what happened to Liu Pan, he was still the reason why Liu Pan left. Now that Liu Pan was heard, Lin Xiu felt responsible for it.

“You…..”

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, Qian Jing was stunned but he soon came back to his senses. He finally realised what Lin Xiu was planning to do and his pupils shrank.

“Leave.”

Lin Xiu got Qian Jing to hold onto Liu Pan before turning back to those men. He smiled and said, “I already gave you the money but since you injured my friend, we should have that settled as well.”

“Oh?”

Zhao Nian felt excited after hearing what was said.

The rest of them laughed and mocked Lin Xiu as if they were looking at an idiot.

“LEAVE.”

Lin Xiu peered at Qian Jing who still wasn’t moving before repeating himself.

“Be careful.”

Qian Jing clenched his jaw before helping Liu Pan, who was semi conscious, walk out of the place.

This brat...he’s really crazy.

“So….what do you want then?”

Zhao Nian looked at Lin Xiu curiously and asked.

“Get down on your knees and apologise!”

Lin Xiu said it loud and clear.

“Hahahahahaha….did you hear what he said?! He told me to apologize!”

Zhao nian paused for a moment before breaking into a huge laugh.

It was as if this was the biggest joke that he has ever heard.

“HAHAHAHAHAHA…..YOU’RE FUNNY.”

The other warriors started laughing as well.

“”You brat….do you not know where this is?”

One of the warriors asked Lin Xiu with a threatening look on his face.
