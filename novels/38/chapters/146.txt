Chapter 147: Assigned To Classes

Lin Xiu and the others went down and found that they seemed to be on a huge island!

The airship stopped by the coast. Looking up from here, you could see the tall building immediately.

The entire huge island was where the Sacred Region Academy was located.

The buildings of the Sacred Region Academy were all made of marble that seemed to exude a white glow.

There was a huge stone gate in front. The stone gate was very tall and there were three enormous characters ‘Sacred Region Academy’ carved with dragons and phoenixes on it.

Roar——

At this time, the sky became overcast and the large bird-type evolved beast with flames flew over, standing directly above the stone gate of the Sacred Region Academy.

It was simply massive and had a diameter of more than 20 meters.

It had raging flames emanating from behind and just looking at it from a distance made people’s hearts thump.

“Rank 9…Flaming Mysterious Bird!?” One of the guys said with a trembling voice when he saw this scene.

The students around also clenched the weapons in their hands and were on their guards.

“This evolved beast is a partner of our Sacred Region Academy, don’t worry.” Sima Cheng said with a smile at this time.

Lin Xiu stared at the Flaming Mysterious Bird; it was one of the twelve most terrifying evolved beasts remaining on Earth. He did not expect that one would be here.

The Sacred Region Academy was indeed one of the most mysterious and powerful academies.

With Sima Cheng leading in front, many students moved forward.

Standing on the stone stairs, he could see that the huge stone gate was carved with all kinds of terrifying animals, they were very lifelike.

Sima Cheng stood in the middle of the huge stone gate, placed his right hand in a caved-in area in the middle, and there were rumbling sounds all of a sudden.

This huge stone gate slowly opened at this moment.

From where they were standing, they could immediately see a spacious field with various buildings around.

The architectural style looked a bit simple, but the scientific research at this place was top-notch with all kinds of high-tech equipment.

“Everyone will go through the collection of data here first.” Sima Cheng said while looking at the people behind.

Sima Cheng directed everyone and they began to line up and stand on a weird machine in front.

The first person stood on it and the machine began to scan the person, recording all his information in the machine.

Then, at the next moment, the machine produced a small rectangular card.

“Welcome, freshmen from the south.” Next to this machine, a white-haired old man touched his beard, then held the card and said to everyone, “From the moment you enter the Sacred Region Academy, you will not be able to use Union coins and can only use the points obtained to purchase items. This card is your pass to the Sacred Region Academy and also a points card.”

“500 points will be issued to you every month, please use them to your discretion.”. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“A teacher will go through the specifics with all of you once everyone is split to your classes.”

Points card? Lin Xiu knitted his brows.

Also, Lin Xiu caught a keyword – ‘freshmen from the south’, will there be freshmen from the north?

“I have a question I would like to ask you.” At this moment, a freshman who stood on the machine and had his information recorded said to the old man.

“Speak.” The old man nodded and he looked very kind.

“You said that we are freshmen from the south, so do you mean that there are other freshmen?” The man looked at the old man at this moment and asked.

Hearing what he said, the old man nodded, “Yes, there are a total of 641 freshmen from the north.”

“Their first trial was in the extreme cold of the northern region. They have passed the test before all of you and you guys will meet soon.”

The freshmen were surprised when they heard the old man’s answer.

As expected, Lin Xiu knew that the number of new students would not be so little.

With the warriors in the north, there should be more than a thousand new students in this intake.

Although it was considered quite little to have only about a thousand students in an academy, they were the elites of the younger generation, which was also very scary.

“Okay, go on to the next one!”

As they stepped on the machine one by one to scan their information, Lin Xiu and the others soon got their own cards as well.

“What does the number behind this mean?” Jiang Li looked at the back of the card and saw a number in the middle.

Lin Xiu also looked at the number behind the card, which was a 10.

“Name of your class.” Luo Yue thought about it and said aloud.

As soon as she spoke, Sima Cheng said to everyone, “Everyone got the card? The number behind the card is the class you’re assigned to.”

“It’s true!” Zhang Yin said excitedly at this moment.

He took a closer look and realized that the number behind his card was also 10.

“Luo Yue, what is yours?” Lin Xiu asked Luo Yue curiously.

Luo Yue turned the card over and showed it to Lin Xiu and he could clearly see the number ‘1’ on it.

“That means you are in Class 1.” Lin Xiu said thoughtfully.

When they stood on the machine just now, the machine scanned each person to find out their physical fitness and also indicated their combat strength.

Both himself and Zhang Yin and the others were in Class 10. In other words, were they assigned to their classes according to their combat strength?

Soon, people wearing white combat suits with the two characters ‘Sacred Domain’ walked over from the other side.

“They are your teachers, please follow your teacher according to the class you are assigned to.” Sima Cheng said with a smile.

These teachers from the Sacred Region Academy pressed a button on the machine in their hands and projected the numbers one to ten respectively.

It represented the class they led.

“Seems like we are going to part here.” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue with a little regret.

Luo Yue heard his teasing tone and couldn’t help but glared at him, then walked directly to the teacher of her class.

“The academy is not big.” At this moment, Luo Yue had just walked a few steps when she stopped for a while and spoke, then headed off without looking back.

The academy is not big?

Lin Xiu was taken aback for a moment and laughed. She meant that they would meet each other often, right? Or was she asking him to find her?

“Lin Xiu! Let’s quickly go over too!” Zhang Yin said excitedly.
