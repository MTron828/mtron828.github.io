Chapter 896: Cultivating the holy-level skill

However, as the information in his mind was compiled, Lin Xiu was shocked to discover that this ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’ was the image that appeared in his mind just now, the skill that the man used to slash the heavens and the earth.

And this skill is not restricted to any weapon.

In other words, if you use a spear, you can also produce that effect.

One shot, shattering the sky!

This is truly a heaven-breaking skill that can tear apart space!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but get a little excited.

There is no way to compare this powerful skill with any previous skill.

But in the same way, the use of such a powerful skill requires a lot of power.

However, the power consumption of this skill will gradually decrease with the improvement of one’s own strength and proficiency in this skill.

“How long has it been?”

Lin Xiu looked at Zhao Yongyuan, who was still standing beside him motionless and said aloud.

“One hour.”

Zhao Yongyuan said.

An hour passed?

Lin Xiu was startled, just now he thought it was only a matter of a few minutes.

“Let’s go out.”

After standing up, Lin Xiu found that his back was covered in sweat.

“En.”

At the same time, outside the nine-story pagoda, those warriors who did not belong to the Zhao family had all been dispersed away.

At this time, all the people standing around the nine-story pagoda were from the Zhao family.

There are many Zhao family members and now they have surrounded the nine-story pagoda.

“Xiaoqing, where did your friend come from?”

At this time, an old man stood beside Zhao Xiaoqing and spoke to her.

He is the current head of the Zhao family, that is, Zhao Xiaoqing’s grandfather, Zhao Qi.

Although Zhao Qi looks like an old man, the skin on his hands doesn’t look like an old man at all.

Moreover, his eyes are sharp and there is no turbidity at all.

“I met him in the hunting area. I don’t know where he came from.”

Zhao Xiaoqing shook her head at this time, then told them what happened previously.

After Zhao Qi heard Zhao Xiaoqing’s words, the expression on his face was uncertain.

An outsider actually entered the ninth story!

A floor that no one has been able to enter for all these years, but at this time someone entered.

Zhao Qi’s mood became complicated.

“Father...”

Zhao Lin also looked at his father Zhao Qi at this time.

“have a look.”

Zhao Qi said lightly.

Zhao Lin seemed to want to say something, but he didn’t say anything, just nodded.

The one who was most shocked was Zhao Xiaoqing.

At this time, Zhao Xiaoqing was still standing there, staring blankly at the front.

Boom—

In the next moment, the stone gate on the first floor was pushed open!

The gazes of the Zhao family members around them all looked over there.

The figures of Lin Xiu and Zhao Yongyuan also appeared here at this time.

These people looked at Lin Xiu and Zhao Yongyuan here, their eyes were alert.

Zhao Yongyuan hadn’t come out for a long time. Under the dazzling li, he couldn’t help covering his eyes with his arms.

“It’s really you?”

Zhao Xiaoqing stared at Lin Xiu who came out.

Until now, she seems to be in a state of disbelief.

Lin Xiu, he really made it to the ninth floor and now he even came down!

“Are you Lin Xiu?”
