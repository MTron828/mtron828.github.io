Chapter 556: Going Against the Rank 8!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

At this time, Lin Xiu’s body stood firmly on the other end of the shore and he could clearly see that what had just stabbed towards him was a long sword.

“Ok!?”

The middle-aged man held the long sword in his hand, showing a look of surprise.

He found Lin Xiu jumping out of the water and wanted to find a chance to kill him but he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would dodge.

“Boy, I didn’t expect that you could survive underwater for so long. It seems that you have learned some special skills.” The middle-aged man looked at Lin Xiu, who was standing opposite him and said aloud.

He never thought that Lin Xiu was still alive and he clearly felt that the current Lin Xiu seemed to be different from the previous Lin Xiu.

It seemed that the current Lin Xiu has become stronger.

What happened under the water?

“Old guy, you actually want to piss me off huh.” Lin Xiu looked at the middle-aged man and said coldly at this time.

Lin Xiu didn’t expect that he was really patient and waited for him here for so long.

But now Lin Xiu has just become a rank 7 warrior and his physical strength has reached the strongest state.

And with the addition of system skills, he still had the strength to fight another battle.

Hearing Lin Xiu calling him an ‘old guy’, the middle-aged man’s face suddenly turned gloomy.

He does look a little old and his temples were also a little gray, but he hated people saying he is old.

“Courting death!”

He burst out with strong killing intent and in the next moment, holding the long sword in his hand, he directly attacked Lin Xiu!

Whoosh whoosh—

The long sword in his hand swung and there were bursts of swishes in the air.

Lin Xiu looked at the long sword, his body moved and he kept dodging at an extremely fast speed.

The speed has increased!?

The pupils of the middle-aged man shrank for a moment, then he roared, “‘Breaking through 8 Desolates’!!!”

As soon as he finished speaking, there were dozens of sword aura emitting a cold glow around him and charged towards Lin Xiu!

The sword aura was very terrifying.

Lin Xiu raised his brows and triggered his thought as a dark red light appeared on his body!

A ‘Sphere’ instantly wrapped Lin Xiu’s body!

Bang bang bang-

All those terrifying sword aura hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, making a loud noise.

A red ‘Sphere’!?

The middle-aged man originally thought that his sword aura would be able to chop Lin Xiu into minced meat, but he did not expect that Lin Xiu would be able to block his diamond skill just by using the “Sphere”!

And after a closer look, Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” has become different from before. Now Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” was actually dark red and there were electric arcs flashing on it, which looked very unusual.

Pfft—

Lin Xiu, who had just resisted the middle-aged man’s skill, had blood dripping from the corner of his mouth.

After all, it was a diamond skill used by a rank 8 warrior and Lin Xiu could still feel the powerful impact.

But seeing his ‘Sphere’ turned into this color, Lin Xiu was also a little puzzled.

What the hell is going on here, how did my ‘Sphere’ become like this!?

“Looks like you’re really lucky…” The middle-aged man said in a cold voice and once again attacked Lin Xiu with his long sword!

Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear has not yet been found at the bottom of the river. Now that he has no weapons, his combat effectiveness has obviously plummeted.

But fortunately, Lin Xiu was still wearing the ‘Red Moon’. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

At this time, as the source strength was transmitted to the glove and it suddenly emitted a bright red light.

Bang bang bang-

His long sword attacked Lin Xiu’s “Sphere”, but it couldn’t break Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” at all.

However, Lin Xiu still felt a strong impact, which made Lin Xiu’s body hurt a little.

‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’!!!

Lin Xiu resisted his attack, then seized the opportunity and smashed his fist on his body!

Although it has been a long time since he used ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’, the skill that Lin Xiu used at this time was more powerful than before.

Moreover, the power of this lightning was also mixed with the power of Thunder Lotus, making the lightning even more terrifying.

The middle-aged man’s expression changed and he dodged Lin Xiu’s punch.

[Reset]!

‘Fury’, ‘Heavenly Array’!!!

When he dodged his punch, Lin Xiu directly used the system’s skills. At this moment, Lin Xiu’s power rose several times!

Although the punch with his right hand was dodged by him, the punch that Lin Xiu attacked with his left hand was even more terrifying than the punch he had just attacked with his right hand.

Whether it was speed or strength, it was completely different from the punch just now!

Boom–

This punch directly hit the middle-aged man’s chest, causing his body to fly out!

However, he was a rank 8 warrior after all and had a lot of actual combat ability. Although he was hit by Lin Xiu’s punch at this time, when his body flew to the edge of the bank, he slammed on the ground and steadied himself.

Pfft—

Although his body steadied and did not fly into the river, he still felt a pain in his chest and vomited out a mouthful of blood.

Crackling-

On his body, there was also the lightning from Lin Xiu’s ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’. These lightning bolts made his body constantly tingle and were accompanied by a sense of numbness.

How did you do it? The middle-aged man said to Lin Xiu who was not far away while covering his chest.

He was really shocked. The power of Lin Xiu just now, at that moment, clearly showed the power that only rank 8 warrior could possess!

He looked around and there was a faint light on the ground by the bank, as well as strange patterns.

This thing was like a ‘Source field’, same as the one they were fighting on today.

And now he also clearly felt that with the appearance of this thing, his power has also been suppressed a little.

“That goes without saying.”

Lin Xiu said coldly.

The time for system skills was limited, Lin Xiu waved his fists directly and continued to attack!

“Crazy!!!”

Seeing Lin Xiu continue to attack, the middle-aged man roared and let go of the long sword in his hand directly like an arrow and instantly stabbed towards Lin Xiu who was rushing over!

And the moment the long sword flew out, it split into dozens of long swords!

Every long sword seemed to be real and it has a terrifying sword aura!
