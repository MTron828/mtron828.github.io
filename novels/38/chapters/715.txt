Chapter 716 The Terrifying Snow Lizard

Qian Jin said after hearing Lin Xiu’s words.

Now that so many warriors are attacking the snow lizard, there was no way to kill it.

Although Lin Xiu’s strength was quite good and he killed Wu Changkong, but killing this snowy lizard was simply impossible.

And there was a possibility of losing his life in vain.

“I’m just saying.” Lin Xiu smiled and said aloud.

And at this moment, a loud sound rang out, blowing up the snowflakes on the surrounding ground.

Standing in this position now, he could clearly see that not far behind the huge snow lizard, there were tall city walls built on both sides, and there was a depression below the city wall.

Going down from here was the Legacy Land.

But there was this huge lizard in front of him blocking it. Someone wanted to rush down, but was directly trampled to death by the terrifying snow lizard.

Even a rank 9 warrior, was directly crushed after being stepped on and could not fight back at all.

The power of this monster was too strong.

“But even if we went over, we can’t get in there.”

Lin Xiu said while walking.

“When those people kill the snow lizard, we’ll go over there.”

When he walked to the front, Huangji waved his hand and said.

Now there were many warriors who had the same idea as Huangji, and many warriors were also watching this battle.

Roar–

The huge snow lizard seemed to be furious after being attacked by those people, and at this time it let out a loud roar.

At this moment, the snow lizard violently rioted, waving its sharp claws at the warriors who attacked him.

From time to time, terrifying energy bombs spat out from its mouth.

Due to the impact of this energy bomb, a large number of pits have appeared on the surrounding ground. A large number of warriors attacked one after another, and all kinds of skills were used, which were extremely dazzling.

Lin Xiu, who had been paying attention to the situation over there, clenched the Dark Edge spear tightly at this time.

He couldn’t hold back any longer and wanted to go there to fight.

Because he found that the snow lizard seemed to have relatively weak resistance to fire-type skills.

The attack of a warrior’s fire attribute skill over there caused some scars to appear on the skin of the snowy lizard.

Seems like its weakness is fire?

“Let’s hide in the carriage first.”

Jiang Jun looked at Lin Xiu and the others behind him, and said aloud.

Now it was icy and snowy outside the carriage, and he and the others are all dressed in thin clothes – a warrior was very fit, but he still had consciousness and still felt cold at this time.

Qian Jin glanced at Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu didn’t seem to be affected at all, and the skin on his face didn’t turn pale at all because of the cold.

He’s really a monster.

“You guys go first.”

Lin Xiu glanced at Qian Jin and said.

“Don’t go over there to die.”

Qian Jin looked at Lin Xiu and stared at the snow lizard and said.

“I’m not so overbearing.”

Lin Xiu waved his hand helplessly and said.

The old man Huangji entered the carriage directly.

Although the train was damaged, the temperature inside the carriage was still higher than that outside.

Lin Xiu looked at the snowy lizard not far away after they all entered the carriage, and narrowed his eyes.

In the next moment, his body moved and he rushed straight ahead!

‘Without a Trace’ was activated and Lin Xiu’s speed became extremely fast when his body technique was used, like a phantom, he kept moving forward.

Soon, he rushed in front of the snow lizard.

Facing this behemoth at close range, Lin Xiu was shocked.

He could sense the power from this king-level evolved beast from such close proximity.

It even made him feel fearful about attacking.

Damn it!

Lin Xiu shook his head ruthlessly, then waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand, and immediately one after another flaming birds flew out.

The huge flaming bird was still a little too small compared to the snow lizard.

Like a small flame, it hit the foot of the snow lizard, but it didn’t cause any damage to it.

“The system has said before that the damage to a higher-ranked warrior is less than 40%, and the experience gained by killing the warrior is only one-tenth.”

“But it doesn’t say anything about an evolved beast, so I must kill this snow lizard.”

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth at this moment, then swung the Dark Edge spear with both hands, and immediately released one after another of flaming birds.

In an instant, hundreds of flaming birds appeared, and those flaming birds were all gathered together.

In the next moment, it gathered into a huge fire phoenix.

At this time, some snowflakes on the surrounding ground were all melted away because of the terrifying temperature of the phoenix

Many warriors looked towards this direction.

The use of such large-scale skills requires a lot of source strength. Now these warriors were retaining their strength to enter the legacy land later. No one wanted to use all their power at this time.

“Go!”

As Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand again, the phoenix charged directly in front of him.

Roar–

When the snow lizard saw the phoenix, it suddenly let out a huge roar, then raised its claws and slapped the flaming phoenix directly.

Boom–

But this flaming phoenix immediately burned the claws of this snow lizard.

And formed a flame tornado, which spun wildly.

At this time, the snow lizard’s claws were constantly slapping against the ground, and it seemed that it was a little painful because of the impact of the flame.

The huge laser cannon just now didn’t make the lizard roar out loud, but this flame of Lin Xiu’s actually made it feel pain.

Sure enough, Lin Xiu guessed it right!

This thing was afraid of fire.

The flame was quickly extinguished under the frantic slap of the snow lizard against the snow, but it could be seen that its claws seemed to have blackened.

Even though it was afraid of fire, with Lin Xiu’s current level of attack, it was still unable to break its defense?

While Lin Xiu was shocked, the snow lizard opened its mouth wide.

In an instant, a lot of energy gathered in its mouth.

Boom–

In the next moment, this energy cluster shot directly towards Lin Xiu!

The speed at which this energy cluster was ejected was so fast that Lin Xiu had no way to dodge!
