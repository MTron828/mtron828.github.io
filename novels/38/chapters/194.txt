Chapter 195: Moon Wings Corp

Right as they were advancing, Lin Xiu was still in a heated battle.

“What are you dodging for!!!” The bald man roared and swung his saber fanatically.

He was completely infuriated and wanted to mince Lin Xiu’s body up!

Lin Xiu frowned and avoided the saber that barely swept past his head and cut away a few strands of his hair. Just a bit more and his head would be gone!

Clack-

Right at that moment, Lin Xiu grasped the opportunity and stabbed forward!

But the bald man blocked his stab with his saber!

Lin Xiu immediately felt numbness in his hands.

“Very good!” The bald man laughed when he saw Lin Xiu attack.

He held his saber with both hands and retaliated. The force pushed Lin Xiu back as he continued to slash towards Lin Xiu!

He had a full grasp of Lin Xiu’s strength and appeared to be able to attack with ease.

“Let him play for a bit, we can rest and see if those foolish freshmen will come over.” Cheng Fan sat on a rock at the side and watched the battle with interest.

“Scar, why not let him join us, he has potential.” Cheng fan thought for a moment and said.

“Hmph!” The bald man snorted and continued to slash with his saber.

Clank clank clank-

The saber struck Lin Xiu’s spear body and produced loud sounds.

But to his surprise, Lin Xiu’s spear was unharmed.

It was too hard!

“Brat, want to join our Moon Wings Corp?” The bald man asked while attacking him.

‘Moon Wings Corp? What’s that?’

Although Lin Xiu did not understand, he memorized the name.

“I’m not interested in your bird wing corp.” Lin Xiu snorted and continued to block the bald man’s attack. He suddenly stabbed forward!

Clank-

Lin Xiu’s stab looked extremely easy to block to Scar.

But while blocking, he suddenly felt a powerful force.

His hands turned numb and his saber was flung away!

‘How is this possible!?’

Scar’s eyes were filled with disbelief, but Lin Xiu did not give him any time to think and stabbed forward!

Bang-

“You…” Scar opened his eyes wide and looked at his chest in shock, where Dark Edge had pierced through completely.

His heart region had been completely stabbed through.

“Byebye!” Lin Xiu kicked him away!!

“SCAR!!!!” Cheng Fan and the others were overwhelmed with shock. They did not think that Lin Xiu’s one attack could kill Scar!

‘How is that possible?!’

He was constantly in the passive state and beaten down by Scar, how did he suddenly turn up superior?

Pu-

The bald man’s body twitched on the floor as blood flowed out from his mouth.

He opened his eyes wide and after twitching for a few more bouts, he breathed his last breath.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing rank 5 warrior, obtaining 10 million experience points!”

‘Very good, 10 million!’

Lin Xiu looked at Cheng Fan and the others as his entire body emitted fighting intent.

Because he had suddenly used Fury and killed the bald man before he could even react, it would still be troublesome for him to fight against the remaining four rank 5 warriors.

“Kill him now!!!” Cheng Fan clenched his fists and his veins popped out as he roared.

Following his command, Cheng Fan’s teammates charged at Lin Xiu! Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

They moved extremely quickly and released dust in their wake. Inside the mist, their figures became hard to detect.

Lin Xiu did not attempt to run but welcomed the battle instead!

Under Fury’s state, his strength was at peak rank 5!

He had grown one rank up!

As long as he killed the other four rank 5 warriors, he would gain 40 million experience points!

Lin Xiu moved and his source strength erupted out, enveloping his body with a pale green aura.

Clank clank clank-

The four surrounded him and clashed with Dark Edge, producing a series of metallic sounds.

Faced against four, Lin Xiu seemed to be extremely proficient and was not inferior or at a disadvantage!

‘How is this possible!!!’

Cheng Fan’s eyes were filled with disbelief, after all he had seen Lin Xiu’s strength, he was an ordinary rank 4 warrior.

But the strength he was displaying was now of a peak rank 5 warrior, how could there be such a great disparity in power!?

The intense battle produced many collision sounds and the structure was slowly damaged by their skills.

Sou-

Lin Xiu discovered that one of his opponent’s speed and reaction time had dropped and stabbed him without hesitation!

Torrential storm of rose flowers!!!!

The man did not expect Lin Xiu to attack him suddenly.

As per Lin Xiu’s calculation, he was slower and failed to react in time. The spear immediately pierced through his body!

Bang-

The immense pain caused his pupils to constrict.

But the spear did not stop there and unleashed multiple strikes. It was too late for him to dodge.

His entire body was dyed red instantly.

He wanted to stab at the head and get rid of him instantly, but the other three came rushing over!

“Hmph!” Lin Xiu snorted and avoided their attacks.

He looked at his opponent that was completely soaked in his own blood but yet to die and was inwardly regretful.

Their battle robes were too exquisite, although Dark Edge had stabbed into his body, the battle robes had deflected most of the damage.

He failed to kill him!

“Mount Hua Strike!!!” Cheng Fan felt that something was amiss and did not want to tangle with Lin Xiu any longer. He leaped up with both hands on his saber as he slashed towards him!!!

His saber was imbued with source strength. Following his slash, the ground around started to rip apart. The powerful strike went straight for Lin Xiu!!!
