Chapter 884: Beast Emperor – Alien White Tiger

When Lin Xiu just lifted his foot and walked upstairs, he felt a huge white figure and rushed towards him!

Seeing this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly and he dodged directly from the side of his body.

boom–

The group of black shadows fluttered at the entrance of the stairs where Lin Xiu was just now and suddenly made a dull sound.

Lin Xiu, who was dodging to the other side, could clearly see this white figure, it was an evolved beast!

A very large, sturdy, evolved beast like a white tiger!

Without the slightest hesitation, he directly activated the Analytic Eye:

Name: Alien White Tiger

Rank: Beast Emperor

Features: The limbs are powerful and powerful, the explosive ability is extremely strong and the fangs are highly poisonous.

Weaknesses: Except for strength suppression, there are no obvious weaknesses for now.

Seeing the news from the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu’s brows could not help but twitch.

The Beast Emperor... It seems to be a higher rank than the Beast king.

Is it equivalent to the level of Respected warrior of a human being?

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu’s body trembled slightly.

This is not a trembling of fear, but a trembling of excitement.

“Very good, then let’s play.”

Lin Xiu put the Dark Edge spear on his back, took a deep breath, bowed slightly and leaned his hands forward.

The strength of the body, at this moment, all gathered in the legs and hands.

Roar–

Seeing Lin Xiu’s eyes full of fighting intent, the alien white tiger let out a loud roar as if his dignity was being challenged.

With a sudden force on his legs, his entire body, like a white shadow, rushed towards Lin Xiu!

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly when he saw this scene.

Without dodging, he directly attacked the alien white tiger that rushed over.

The source strength on both hands and arms materialized, forming a pale red translucent gas.

boom–

The fist collided with the claws of this alien white tiger and a huge sound suddenly erupted.

Lin Xiu’s body and that of the alien white tiger were both shaken and retreated by the huge impact generated by the collision.

“interesting.”

A smile appeared on the corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth.

crackling-

The fists of both hands, at this time, had a large number of blue lightning flashes.

After reaching the level of Respected warrior, the power of the skills used by Lin Xiu also became more powerful.

The alien white tiger looked at the current Lin Xiu and seemed to sense the danger of Lin Xiu.

There is also a cautious look in his eyes.

Roar–

It roared a little angrily and the hairs on its whole body seemed to stand up.

The entire body was immediately covered with light blue energy.

what is this?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu also showed surprise in his eyes.

Those energies materialized on the body of this alien white tiger seem to be the source strength.

Could it be that evolved beasts above the beast emperor can also cultivate and use source strength?

Before Lin Xiu could think about it, this alien white tiger directly attacked Lin Xiu and bit him!

This time, its speed is even faster!

When the paw, which was wrapped in a light blue energy group, was swung, there was a sound of breaking through the air.

Lin Xiu didn’t dare to be careless at this time, the power of his whole body turned into motion and the light red source strength wrapped his entire body, directly confronting this alien white tiger!

boom boom boom —

Everyone outside, at this time, heard a huge noise from inside the nine-story tower.

“This guy...”

Zhao Xiaoqing stared at the nine-story tower with wide eyes.

The first and second floors of this huge nine-story pagoda became slightly brighter.

This proves that Lin Xiu has passed the first floor and is on the second floor.

And Lin Xiu, who is currently on the second floor, seems to be fighting with something.

Just now, Pang Hu was knocked into the air. They never thought that Lin Xiu would be able to hold on for so long.

“But he definitely won’t be able to get that skill card.”

Zhao Xiaoqing said secretly.

The reason why the Zhao family opened up the nine-story pagoda for other warriors to challenge it is not because they don’t value the holy-level skill card at the top of the tower, but because no one in their clan could get it.

The nine-story pagoda stands here and after so many years, no one has successfully reached the top of the pagoda, so Zhao Xiaoqing doesn’t believe that Lin Xiu can do it.

Even if Lin Xiu is very strong.

boom boom boom —

At the same time, Lin Xiu was still fighting this alien white tiger.

Without the use of weapons, Lin Xiu not only was not at a disadvantage, but even got the upper hand.

crackling-

At this moment, watching the alien white tiger rush over again, Lin Xiu’s fist burst out with a lot of lightning.

The surrounding air seemed to be electrocuted by the lightning.

Boom—

With this punch, it directly charged towards the alien white tiger that rushed over!

The speed of punching is very fast, this alien white tiger has no way to escape.

This punch with an electric glow directly hit the body of this alien white tiger.

Its huge body was directly blasted out by Lin Xiu.

It hit the back hard.

Its entire body, at this time, has a large amount of electricity flickering.

However, this alien white tiger has rough skin and thick flesh and this blow does not seem to have suffered particularly serious damage.

It responded quickly and got up again.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu had already appeared in front of him.

With the fist covered in electricity, he continued to attack this alien white tiger!

boom boom boom —

As Lin Xiu kept throwing his fists, the alien white tiger was continuously beaten out by Lin Xiu.

The body hit the wall of the ninth-story tower, making the ninth-story tower seem to be shaking.

go to hell!

Seeing that the alien white tiger became weaker and weaker under his attack, all the source strength in Lin Xiu’s body gathered in the fist of his right hand.

With a fist, he will directly kill this beast emperor-level alien white tiger!

But the moment the fist hit this alien white tiger, its body instantly turned into white particles and disappeared!

Um?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu was startled.

Before he could react, he heard the ‘boom’ sound.

In the front corner, a ladder leading to the top suddenly stretched down.

“Is this fake?”

Looking at the stairs that appeared, you don’t have to think about it, you know that he had completed the second-floor challenge.

But how could that alien white tiger just disappear in this way?

Could it be that this alien white tiger appeared as a type of energy body?

Lin Xiu was a little confused.

Shaking his head, he walked directly to the stairs.

“The third floor... the third floor is lit up!”

Some warriors who looked at the nine-story tower outside, saw the third-story tower also emit a faint light and their eyes showed shock.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
