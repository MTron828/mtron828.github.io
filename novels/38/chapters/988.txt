Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Bang bang bang-

At this time, Lin Xiu frantically waved the spear in his hand.

With the use of the Destiny spear art, Lin Xiu’s spear art attack became more severe than before.

The spearhead of the spear frantically hit the bones of the Skeleton dragon.

But there was no way to smash its bones to pieces!

!!

Lin Xiu’s eyes became more cautious at this time.

After distancing himself from it, Lin Xiu continued to wave the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

rumbling rumbling—

At the next moment, dark blue flaming birds burst out from the Dark Edge spear in an instant.

As soon as the flames came out, the surrounding air became distorted in an instant.

One after another, the flaming birds charged directly towards the Skeleton dragon.

In an instant, this huge Skeleton dragon was all enveloped in flames.

Can it be killed?

Lin Xiu stared at the Skeleton dragon covered in flames.

Roar–

But at the next moment, the Skeleton dragon broke free from the flame and flew out and the huge white claws swiped toward Lin Xiu’s body!

Although Lin Xiu reacted quickly and unfolded the ‘Sphere’, the terrifying claws directly slapped Lin Xiu and he flew out.

Boom—

Lin Xiu’s entire body was sent flying and hit the ground.

The whole ground seemed to be shaking.

damn…

Lin Xiu quickly got up from the ground.

As soon as he got up, Lin Xiu felt a pain in his body.

He spat out a mouthful of blood.

The blood spat out was black in color.

He looked at his hands and there were black spots.

What… is happening?

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

Is it because of the influence of the dark energy of this Skeleton dragon?

Curse?

Before Lin Xiu could think about it, the huge Skeleton dragon flew down again and attacked Lin Xiu.

Although one of its claws just now was smashed, but with only one claw, it was still extremely strong.

swoosh—

‘Flashing Souls’ The body skill was activated and Lin Xiu’s body instantly disappeared in place.

Boom—

Its huge claws hit the ground and the whole ground made a huge sound and at the same time, a huge pit was blasted out.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s body appeared high in the sky.

Looking at the dark energy source stone in the head of the Skeleton dragon, his brows could not help wrinkling.

This dark energy source stone is really weird.

And this Skeleton dragon seems to be extremely resistant to elemental attacks. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Not even the hellfire could do any damage to it.

What should he do?

It was as if the Skeleton dragon had eyes on its back. At this time, it suddenly turned around and a black energy ray was released from its mouth and charged toward Lin Xiu in the air!

Lin Xiu’s pupils shrank slightly and he kept dodging in the air.

This dark energy ray was too terrifying, even if the “Sphere” is unfolded, Lin Xiu did not dare to directly resist it.

‘Freezing the Distance’!!!

At the next moment, Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand, the Heart of Frost revolved and the surrounding air instantly dropped below zero.

Crash-

As a burst of ice and snow blew past, the entire ground was covered with a layer of frost.

The Skeleton dragon that was fluttering with huge bone wings and flying in the air was instantly frozen into an ice sculpture!

It fell directly to the ground, making a loud noise.

“Break!”

At this moment, Lin Xiu, who was holding the Dark Edge spear, rushed down from top!

He was akin to a huge tiger.

‘Tiger descends the mountain’!

Boom—

As Lin Xiu’s blow hit the Skeleton dragon’s body that turned into an ice sculpture, the ice sculpture exploded directly!

And the Skeleton dragon’s body instantly shattered.

Dead??

Lin Xiu was a little out of breath now.

During the battle just now, too much stamina and source strength was used.

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

Just when Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief and was about to take the dark attribute energy source stone out of the Skeleton dragon’s head, the bones seemed to start shaking.

What’s going on!?

Seeing that the broken bones were shaking again, Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly.

Not dead yet?!

The next moment, the head of this Skeleton dragon flew straight up and bit towards Lin Xiu!

Oh no!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s expression changed greatly.

He didn’t expect that this Skeleton dragon could still move after it was broken like this.

And at this critical moment, a dazzling white light burst out from Lin Xiu’s body.

Originally, it was about to bite Lin Xiu, but it was instantly annihilated by the dazzling light.

The dark energy source stone seemed to have dimmed because of the dazzling light.

“Phew.”

Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief and sat directly on the ground, feeling his whole body relaxed.

“I really didn’t expect that this darn skill would be useful…”

Lin Xiu said aloud like he was talking to himself.

Just at the critical moment, Lin Xiu was not using any powerful skills.

It was the ‘Holy Light’ skill given by the newly acquired ‘Holy Light Battle Suit’.

Looking at the skill introduction, this was a skill that shines in the eyes of the enemy.

“Light attributes restrain dark attributes.”

“It seems that my guess was right.”

Lin Xiu said to himself.

Because from the very beginning, the small world of the Sage warrior Space was like a real game world.

So Lin Xiu also relied on gaming strategies to think about countermeasures.

The light attribute restrains the dark attribute, which has always been the setting in games.

At this time, the surrounding bones have all turned into powder.

The dark energy stone fell to the ground.

After Lin Xiu regained his strength, he walked over to the dark energy stone.

Picking up the dark energy stone, the dark spots on Lin Xiu’s body just now were absorbed by the dark energy stone.

That uncomfortable feeling disappeared instantly.

Pressing his smartwatch, Lin Xiu clicked on the collection window as the screen projected.

In the next moment, the dark energy stone immediately disappeared, then appeared in one of the windows on the screen.

Now, out of the five windows, two energy source stone Stones have been collected.

There were energy source stone of Electricity and energy source stone of Darkness.

There were three more.

He still had three days, it should be enough.

“Next, I should go there.”

Lin Xiu stood up and said to himself.

Ancient ruin.

In this place, there are angel tears that Wu Hao wants to find by himself.

As long as he finds Angel’s Tears, he can exchange it for news of the Orchid of Heaven.

And the next energy source stone is also on this ancient ruin.
