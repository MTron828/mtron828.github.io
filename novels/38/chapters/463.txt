Chapter 464: Lin Xiu who was evolving

“The wounds are recovering and there is already new flesh growing. Everything seems good. It’s just…” The doctor spoke but then hesitated to continue.

“What is it?” Nan Zhengjun was stunned for a moment before asking subconsciously.

Luo Yue immediately looked up and turned towards him as well.

When the doctor saw the look in her eyes, he felt chills running down his spine and it felt as if he had been thrown into a dark, chilly cave.

Terrifying. She was incredibly terrifying.

This look would only appear on those who have killed numerous people!

“It’s just…it’s just that for some reason, he is still in a deep coma.” The doctor said as he trembled.

Luo Yue’s eyes were truly scary. Her eyes looked as if she would chop him into pieces if he said something that she didn’t like.

“What is it that caused such a situation?” Nan Zhengjun frowned. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Perhaps Lin Xiu injured his head while he was underwater?

“We still couldn’t find out what it is now. All of his reports came back clear.” The doctor felt that this was peculiar as well.

In this world, almost all diseases had a cure including cancer. They were only a very minor issue.

But, for some reason, even with all these advanced technologies, Lin Xiu was still in a deep coma.

Theoretically, this would be impossible.

“But…” The doctor thought about something and stammered.

“Say it.” Luo Yue frowned. Somehow, a dagger had appeared in her hands and she pointed it towards the doctor.

“It looks as if his internal organs are evolving!” The doctor was shocked when he saw what Luo Yue did and quickly told them what he had in mind.

His internal organs were evolving?!

As soon as the doctor was done, Luo Yue and Nan Zhengjun had a change of expression on their faces. They were both surprised as well.

“What does this mean?!” Nan Zhengjun continued asking.

“According to our results, we noticed that his body structures are a little different from ours…” As he continued, the doctor sounded a little excited.

Lin Xiu’s inner organs as well as his tissue had undergone changes. It made him more adaptable to the environment and he seems much tougher than normal human beings.

“Usually, for animals and humans, the main respiratory organs would be lungs, gills, and air bladder. Those without these organs would breathe through their skin. The human’s skin breathes as well but the amount is too little to support us. However, when we were examining him, we noticed that his skin would be able to replace his lungs as the main respiratory organ in him. This was incredible!”

The doctor’s excitement grew as he explained it to them. It was something that he has never seen in this world.

With the appearance of the warriors, the human being’s body was already much tougher than before but they have never seen someone like Lin Xiu.

All of his internal organs have evolved. Even if it was a rank 9 warrior where they were able to absorb the energy from the air around them and use it as energy for their body cells to help them evolve but none of them had such drastic changes.

“Stop telling us about this. Now, we just want to know how Lin Xiu will be able to wake up.” Nan Zhengjun was shocked when he heard the news. He didn’t know about the evolution that was happening to Lin Xiu’s body. Instead, he only wanted to know how they could wake him up.

“I’m not sure.” The doctor shook his head.

“You don’t have any ideas?!” Zheng Nanjun frowned.

The doctors in the Sacred Region Academy were already the best. They were the ones who could deal with every single disease that has ever been discovered.

But, the surprising thing was even they had no idea when Lin Xiu would be able to wake up from his coma.

“We can only wait for the patient to wake up on his own.” The doctor said helplessly.

“Fine.” Nan Zhengjun nodded his head.

As the doctor left, Nan Zhengjun looked at Lin Xiu who was on the bed, and spoke to Luo Yue, “Luo Yue, you should go back and rest. I’ll take care of him for now.”

Ever since Lin Xiu got admitted, Luo Yue has been caring for him. She has never left him for even a minute and even Nan Zhengjun was touched.

Who would have thought that a girl that was as cold as her would be able to do such things?

“It’s alright.” Luo Yue said calmly.

After hearing what Luo Yue said, Nan Zhengjun gave a bitter smile. After visiting Lin Xiu, he headed out.

He was a teacher after all and he had a lot of other things that he had to do.

Lin Xiu was now lying down with his eyes closed, he was in a deep sleep. It may not be visible from the outside but his body was undergoing a drastic change.

“How is Lin Xiu?” On the other hand, inside the office of Dean Baili, he was asking the middle-aged man who was sitting opposite him with a bitter smile on his face.

He didn’t think that something like this would happen. Plus, Lin Xiu must have met some creatures undersea which was why his body had been so severely damaged.

He was still in the hospital until today.

“His body’s recovery has been alright but the doctors there still don’t know why he is still in a coma.” The middle-aged man nodded his head and answered the dean.

“Alright. Remember to send someone there to check on him. Dean Baili reminded him.

“It won’t be convenient for me to be there now.”

He was aware that Luo Yue was in the hospital, looking after Lin Xiu. If he went over there now, he would definitely be thrown out according to Luo Yue’s attitude. That would have been awkward.

“What did he face underwater?” The middle-aged man got curious.

“We’ll know when he wakes up.” Dean Baili wasn’t sure as well as he sighed.

“Oh, what about the staff that we sent? What did they find?” Dean Baili thought of something and quickly asked him.

After hearing Dean Baili’s question, the middle-aged man got excited and said, “They did find something. Look.”

After saying that, he picked up the phone that was as thin as a piece of card. He swiped through it and within minutes, there was a clear image that was projected onto the wall opposite them through his phone.

After taking a good look, it was an image and there was a ‘human’ in the picture.

“They found this underwater?” Dean Baili was shocked as well when he saw the image.

The image may have shown that it was just an ordinary human but with the experience that he had, Dean Baili would clearly tell that that was a robot!
