Chapter 784: Sun Zi!

Who are they?

Liu Pan and the others also heard the sound obviously. They were about to take a rest, but now they all picked up their weapons.

Lin Xiu also put away the King-level Odd crystal and looked towards the front, only to find a group of people walking towards him.

Not those Wan Qiansan warriors.

But some strangers.

And looking at the clothes of these people, they don’t look like people who have just experienced the battle with the Raging Flame Lion.

“I found it! It’s there! Such a strong energy fluctuation…”

A young man, holding an instrument in his hand, seemed a little excited and said aloud.

“Who are they?”

Liu Pan frowned as he watched these people approach.

“The Sun family!?”

At this moment, An Qi and Qian Lin seemed to know those people, so they said in unison.

The young man walking at the front looked at Lin Xiu at this time and said with great surprise, “It’s him, the king-level Odd crystal should be on him!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the warriors behind him all looked at Lin Xiu.

There were more than a dozen master warrior-level warriors and the remaining were warriors at the peak of rank 9.

And beside the man, there was an old man with white hair.

The strength of this old man was even more unfathomable.

Lin Xiu frowned at this time, then subconsciously used the Analytic eye to investigate.

He actually found out that the strength of this old man is of the king warrior-level!

A warrior of the king warrior-level!

Feeling all this, Lin Xiu’s pupils could not help shrinking sharply.

This is the first time that he has encountered a warrior of the king warrior-level!

The old man’s appearance was unremarkable and his source strength was restrained. If it wasn’t for Lin Xiu’s Analytic Eye, there would be no way to discover his strength.

“Boy, did you take the Odd crystal of the Raging Flame Lion?”

The old man looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud without any expression on his face.

“Sun Zi, it’s you!?”

Before Lin Xiu could answer his words, An Qi and Qian Lin, who stood up, looked at the young man in front of them and said aloud.

“Oh? An Qi and Qian Lin?”

The young man they called Sun Zi also found that An Qi and Qian Lin were here and his eyes showed surprise.

The old man’s eyes narrowed at this time.

The An family and the Qian family...

“What do you want?”

At this moment, An Qi looked at Sun Zi and frowned slightly.

“Nothing, I just wanted that Odd crystal of the Raging Flame Lion.”

Sun Zi showed a strange smile, then shrugged and said.

“We don’t have that kind of odd crystal.”

Qian Lin said lightly at this time.

“That’s right, it’s none of our business what kind of crystals you’re looking for.”

Liu Pan also said aloud at this time.

“Humph! Are you trying to lie to me? My sensor clearly senses that this Odd crystal is right here!”

“On him!”

At this time, Sun Zi raised his head and pointed at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

The radar sensor in his hand is able to sense the existence of the surrounding energy bodies.

This kind of thing was used by Lin Xiu when he hunted the ice crystal white bird on Earth.

It’s just that what Sun Zi is holding in his hand seems to be a bit more high-tech.

At this moment, An Qi and Qian Lin’s expressions turned a little ugly.

The people of the Sun family, like their family, are also from Cangqiong City and they are also the most powerful among the four major families in Cangqiong City.

Now if he wants to snatch it, things will be troublesome.

“What do you want?”

An Qi frowned and said.

“Since you know them, hand over the Odd crystals and the matter is over.”

Sun Zi said coldly at this time.

“No way.”

Lin Xiu said directly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Sun Zi’s face suddenly turned ugly.

“Boy, who do you think you are?”

Who would dare not give what Sun Zi wanted?

What’s more, he didn’t feel how powerful Lin Xiu was.

Sun Zi gestured to the warriors beside him. At this moment, these warriors approached Lin Xiu.

“Stop!” An Qi and Qian Lin saw this scene and the expressions in their eyes suddenly changed.

Then they stood in front of Lin Xiu and glared at Sun Zi.

The surrounding warriors, including Sun Zi, were nothing, but they know that the old man’s strength was definitely not ordinary.

The current situation is very dangerous.

“Yoyo, the two of you...” Seeing this scene, Sun Zi immediately showed a look of interest.

“Could it be the cowherd you guys raised?”

“Hahaha!”

“He is our master!”

An Qi and Qian Lin said coldly at this time.

When Sun Zi heard their words, he was stunned for a moment, then laughed loudly, “This kid? You might be fooled!”

“No, I can’t, I can’t, I’m dying of laughter.”

Sun Zi, who had been laughing wildly for a while, suddenly restrained his smile, then said coldly to the surrounding warriors, “Take this kid down for me!” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

This king-level Odd crystal must be obtained!

There is nothing he can’t get!

Those warriors directly ignored An Qi and Qian Lin and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

When Liu Pan saw this scene, the expression in his eyes suddenly changed and he wanted to attack with the double-sided axe in his hands.

“You guys step back!”

But at this moment, Lin Xiu said aloud.

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, Liu Pan and the others felt a huge force coming and their bodies retreated directly to the back.

And Lin Xiu attacked with the Dark Edge spear in his hand!

“Courting death!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu still dared to fight, Sun Zi said coldly.

It’s just that the old man beside Sun Zi frowned slightly at this time. He clearly felt that Lin Xiu’s body’s source strength fluctuations were not strong, not like a strong warrior, but at this moment, he could clearly feel it. When he arrived, Lin Xiu’s power seemed to have increased a lot in an instant.

Are you hiding your strength?

Several master warrior-level warriors and the peak rank 9 warriors rushed to Lin Xiu in a direct attack and they were about to take Lin Xiu down.

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and the spear in his hand slashed straight into the air.

‘Clean Sweep’!!!

bang bang bang-

This shot seems unremarkable, but the weapons of these warriors were directly knocked away by the terrifying power!

The throats of several warriors were directly cut and the blood was like sputtering out in an instant.

Like a plum blossom blooming in the air.

When Sun Zi saw this scene, his eyes widened, his face full of shock.

How can it be! How can this kid have such a powerful force!

This is simply an instant kill.

“Attack! Attack now!”
