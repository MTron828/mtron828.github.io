Chapter 174: Two hearts Beat As One

The airship gradually descended not long later.

“Alright, we have arrived at G17 ruin. Before moving out, I need to explain something to you guys now.” At this point, a middle-aged teacher walked over.

He was dressed in Sacred Region Academy’s white robe that was distinctly different from the ordinary teacher’s. His was obviously higher grade.

“Remember, if you sustain a wound from an evolved beast, come back here within 24 hours or you will die.” The middle-aged man glanced at everyone and said indifferently.

“Also, if you get bitten by a zombie, there’s no hope for you.” When he said that, everyone’s expression changed.

All of them were no longer joking around. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Rumble–

The doors of the airship slowly opened.

Everyone was dressed in their battle robes and walked down the stairs with their weapons.

The atmosphere was gloomy and overcast. The air seemed to contain particles that obstructed vision.

The air quality was not great.

“What a terrible smell.” Zhang Yin commented.

“I will be waiting for everyone here one week from now.” The middle-aged man stood at the top of the stairs and looked at the 100 freshmen.

With that said, the airship doors closed.

Lin Xiu looked around at their surroundings. It was no grassland and in the distance were abandoned tall buildings shrouded by mist.

They could not see any zombies or evolved beasts.

“Let’s walk this way.” When he saw other teams moving out, Lin Xiu pointed towards the buildings and said.

The other teams started to move in different directions.

Lin Xiu had drawn Dark Edge and tensed his body.

Rollie had popped half of its body out of Lin Xiu’s pocket and was observing its surroundings.

They headed in one direction and Lin Xiu was able to hear rustling sounds.

As though something was approaching them from behind.

“There are many warriors that took risks here and ended up staying here forever as zombies.” Li Ping held his saber and said through clenched teeth.

Just as he finished his words, Luo Yue charged forward.

She moved extremely quickly to the extent of turning into a white figure as she rushed forward.

A figure suddenly rushed out from the grass ahead.

When they focused, they saw a male with bad hair, a pale face, and a set of white teeth.

His mouth seemed to have rot with blood and looked extremely disgusting.

Lin Xiu noticed that he was dressed in battle robes as well!

He activated Analytic Eye and read the information:

Rank 4 Zombie

Traits: A warrior that was infected and turned into a zombie, extremely fast and strong. Will be infected upon being bitten.

Sou-

Luo Yue did not hesitate and slashed down with her sword and cut it into two.

“This monster… was actually hiding in the grass?” Zhang Yin and the others took a deep breath in after the fight.

It was obvious that the zombie still had some intelligence to hide inside the grass.

“Be careful.” Lin Xiu frowned.

The air around was stifling as though they were being trapped by the fog. Their vision had been impaired as well.

It was extremely dangerous under such circumstances.

Roar-

Right at this time, another beast roar came out from another direction that caused their hairs to stand.

“Those people are gone.” Jiang Li looked around, all the teams that had disembarked were no longer in sight.

“Let’s take a look over there.” Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment before deciding.

They continued ahead and saw many skeletons and dried bloodstains all over the ground along with a layer of red gooey stuff.

Right as they turned a corner, a figure suddenly pounced onto Lin Xiu!

Bang-

Lin Xiu looked at the monster that had suddenly appeared and almost bit him. He started to perspire in cold sweat.

Dark Edge had penetrated its head.

The close proximity revealed the sharp teeth in its mouth.

“Congratulations Master for killing rank 4 zombie, obtaining 100,000 experience points!”

‘Too little.’

“Damn, why do these things keep appearing out of nowhere.” Zhang Yin cursed when he saw the new monster.

Li Ping was trembling as the figures of his past had surfaced.

“Damn, we’re going to be in trouble…”

“What trouble?” Lin Xiu kicked the zombie away and asked.

Just as he said that, he heard footsteps from all directions.

He looked ahead. Although their vision was impaired by the mist, he could vaguely make out a large number of figures.

Zombies, many zombies!!!

“Why are there so many zombies?!” Jiang Li and Zhang Yin choked on their own breaths. There were so many zombies and every single one were warriors that had been infected.

Warriors were already strong and after turning into zombies, they became even more terrifying.

Because they did not know pain and would go crazy and focus on biting their targets!!!

“Run! Quick, run!!!” Li Ping shouted.

His eyes were filled with fear as though he had returned to his past.

Zhang Yin and Jiang Li nodded, their goal was to hunt evolved beasts and obtain odd crystals. They did not need to clash with zombies.

But right at this time, they realized that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were still in their original positions.

Their eyes were fixated ahead.

There was no fear but instead battle intent filled their eyes.

“You want to kill them too?” Lin Xiu chuckled and looked at Luo Yue.

She nodded.

“Seems like we have a tacit understanding.”

“Is this what they say, two hearts that beat as one?”

“Shut up.” Luo Yue glared at Lin Xiu with a bit of bashfulness and annoyance before turning towards the zombies!

Lin Xiu followed up immediately.

“Those two… lunatics….” Zhang Yin’s scalp was numb by the zombie horde, but Lin Xiu and Luo Yue had charged right in!!!
