Chapter 956: Lin Xiu Has Disappeared

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu roared with rage and there was a bright light that came from the tip of the long spear.

At that moment, the sounds of shooting stars came from the sky.

What’s that?!

Heilong and Bailong looked around them when they heard the noise.

When they took a closer look, they could see that there were thousands of long spears that were coming at them!

They weren’t the only target, even Huang Fulin and Zhao Rui were suddenly attacked by the ‘raining’ long spears! They were both shocked as well.

They had just killed the black scaled lizard and had exhausted most of the energy in their body.

Now that there were long spears coming in all directions, they were starting to get frightened.

These spears were coming from everywhere!

They were so dense that they couldn’t even count how many of them were in the air.

Plus, all of them were travelling at a very fast speed!

“Hmm?”

At the same time, some of the stronger sage warriors who were on the other side of the planet noticed that the spears started to vibrate. It looked as if it was being summoned.

......

“A sage warrior’s skill?!”

Sima Qing was stunned when he saw what it was.

This was a sage warrior’s skill but even if a sage warrior had cultivated this skill, it wouldn’t necessarily be at such a powerful state!

The strength of this particular one is incredibly powerful!

The warrior skill that Lin Xiu had just released was beyond incredible!

“Defence!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Huang Fulin and his companion screamed as they gathered their energy to strengthen their ‘sphere’.

They were trying their best to block the attack.

Boom boom boom – –

Suddenly, multiple sounds of explosives rang in the air.

Thousands and thousands of long spears were attacking their ‘spheres’.

Lin Xiu’s body was floating in the air as he watched the sage warriors getting attacked

He had added the skill enhancement abilities to upgrade his skill.

This Torrential Storm of the Rose Flower was of a sage warrior’s grade.

Plus, with the additional buffs that Lin Xiu had from his system, the damage of this skill was at its peak.

The strength of this skill was obviously much stronger than he has ever seen!

But….they were still alive!

He knew this because there were still no notifications from the system.

They are still alive?

Lin Xiu grabbed onto his spear tightly as he thought about it.

They were sage warriors after all. Their abilities were much stronger and scarier than he had imagined.

As all the spears fell to the ground, Heilong, Bailong, Huang Fulin and Zhao Rui were still alive as they were still floating in the air.

The only thing that was different was that they were still now panting.

“Damn it, kid!”

Their ‘spheres’ already had cracks on it.

It was obvious that their ‘spheres’ were damaged from the attack that Lin Xiu had released earlier.

“HAHAHAHAH! A little bit more! Just a little bit more!”

Huang Fulin laughed out loud.

Heilong and Bailong glared at Lin Xiu as well as their eyes were filled with a murderous intention.

It was obvious that Lin Xiu had already exhausted all his energy in order to use that skill.

If he couldn’t kill them with that one chance, it would be their turn to finish Lin Xiu.

“This time, let’s kill that brat!!”

Zhao Rui grumbled.

Lin Xiu had shown them too many peculiar skills and they had no idea what skills Lin Xiu would be using next.

Lin Xiu’s body was still full of energy.

He didn’t seem to be drained at all.

“The Furious Ocean!!!!”

Huang Fulin screamed once again and released his strongest warrior skills.

“Another sage warrior skill?!”

Sima Qiang got worried when he heard Huang Fulin.

As Huang Fulin raised the machete above his head, the sky above them suddenly turned into a stormy ocean with terrifying waves!

“Wrathful Strike!”

“Dragon Breaks The Sky!”

“The Rage of the Fire God!”

Suddenly, Zhao Rui, Heilong and Bailong stopped hiding their true force and decided to activate their strongest warrior skills!

All of them were aimed at Lin Xiu!

Koong Loong – –

The entire sky looked as if it would break apart because of the terrifying force!

“You will destroy the entire city!”

Sima Qiang was worried when he looked at the sky and shouted at the sage warriors.

However, he had no other choice. He gathered his energy together and activated the strongest skills that he had.

“Reversed Yin Yang!”

Sima Qiang shouted in rage and all the energy in his body exploded in an instant.

Then, a huge Yin Yang array slowly fell in front of where Lin Xiu was standing.

“No.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

Although Sima Qiang’s warrior skills were one of the strongest defence skills, it still wasn’t strong enough against these four sage warriors.

It would be impossible for him to defend against such forces.

However, if this strong force hits them, all of the warriors from the Dark Shadow would die!

The entire Wildfire City would be destroyed as well.

Lin Xiu grabbed onto his long spear.

The long spear seemed to be able to feel the strong determination of Lin Xiu and it was ringing loudly as well.

“Hu...”

Lin Xiu closed his eyes and took a deep breath. When he opened his eyes once again, he had a firm look in his eyes.

The long spear that he had in his arms was shining with a bright light.

“Young master! Run!”

Sima Qing screamed at Lin Xiu when he saw what Lin Xiu was doing.

The only reason why he had activated his defence warrior skills was so that Lin Xiu had the opportunity to escape.

But, he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu was planning on directly facing this strong force!

“I will not leave.”

Lin Xiu answered calmly.

He held onto his long spear with both hands and thrusted it to the sky!

“Heaven Breaking...”

“STRIKE!”

Xiu – –

With that earth shattering cry, a huge sphere appeared from the tip of the long spear.

It headed directly towards the horrifying energy coming from the sage warriors!

Boom – –

The skills of the four warriors combined broke through Sima Qiang’s Reversed Yinyang and immediately collided with Lin Xiu’s skill.

At that moment, there was a bright, white glow seen in the sky.

The entire Wildfire City was also covered by the white glow.

Wildfire City.

The news of Lin Xiu fighting 4 sage warriors soon spread around the city.

All four sage warriors were severely injured and as for the young man, he had disappeared.

Wildfire City, the place that was once messay and full of wars and battle suddenly turned quiet and peaceful.

“Young Master....”

In another city, Ye Kai finally heard about the fight and there was a change of expression on his face.

But, he believed that Lin Xiu would still be alive.

That’s because he…..is Lin Xiu.
