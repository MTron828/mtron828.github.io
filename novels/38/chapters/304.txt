Chapter 305: Return The Things In The Backpack

“I don’t know, but I think she should be there.” Hua Tian shook his head and answered.

“Let’s go.”

While he was talking, he carried the long sword and walked ahead without looking back.

Lin Xiu looked at him as he walked away and frowned slightly at this moment, then walked to the front.

At this moment, he looked at the ground and he could see Su Xie’s body, which had just been chopped in half by Hua Tian.

How did he do it?

He killed a rank 7 warrior so easily!

With that thought, Lin Xiu’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

They continued walking and after some time, the sky slowly began to brighten up.

“By the way, did you come here looking for Luo Yue or the Ice Lotus Fire?” Hua Tian continued walking in front of him and seemed to have thought of something when he suddenly asked Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu, who had been following Hua Tian’s lead was taken aback by his question.

“The Ice lotus fire is some good stuff.” Hua Tian smiled and did not continue the topic as he mumbled to himself.

“Are you looking for this thing?” Lin Xiu was silent for a while then asked.

This guy was so strong that Lin Xiu has to be cautious.

“Well… you could say so.” Hua Tian thought for a while, then nodded.

As the sky got brighter, sunlight began to shine in. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked around and saw that the surrounding terrain had become a bit different from the previous one.

The surrounding landforms appeared to be steeper and the ground was also uneven, making it harder to walk.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu also heard footsteps coming from not far away.

There’s someone?!

Hearing this, Lin Xiu’s gaze changed and he looked at Hua Tian in front of him.

Hua Tian nodded at this moment as if he understood what Lin Xiu was thinking then said lightly, “See who it is. If there is a threat, kill him.”

When he said it, Lin Xiu felt a strong murderous intent.

This kind of person who has such a strong murderous aura in even his words wouldn’t make Lin Xiu feel this way if he hasn’t killed many people.

Who is this guy!?

This made Lin Xiu even more puzzled.

“Damn, how come I still haven’t found Ice Lotus Fire.”

At this moment, the voices of people came from the back and soon, some warriors walked over.

When they walked over, they noticed Lin Xiu and Hua Tian as well and looked quite surprised.

Lin Xiu stared at the warriors who appeared in front of him. There were about a dozen or so warriors and almost all of them were ranks 6 to 7.

Some warriors were even carrying teeth and horns taken from the body of evolved beasts. It seemed that they killed some evolved beasts, then brought them back to use as materials.

Lin Xiu glanced at them, then said nothing and continued to walk to the front.

Hua Tian did not make a move at this moment and continued to walk forward.

“Wait.” But at this moment, a middle-aged man glanced at Lin Xiu and Hua Tian and called out suddenly when the two of them were about to pass by.

As he spoke, the eyes of the other men also looked towards Lin Xiu and Hua Tian.

Being watched by so many rank 6 and rank 7 warriors, Lin Xiu felt tremendous pressure.

He instinctively clenched the Dark Edge spear tightly at this moment.

“Are you looking for Ice Lotus Fire?” The middle-aged man looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

Peak rank 7 warrior!

Lin Xiu looked at this man and activated his Analytic Eye. He could clearly see that the strength of this man had reached the peak of a rank 7 warrior and it seemed that he would soon reach the level of a rank 8 warrior!

“No.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

Hua Tian looked at the warriors but said nothing.

At this moment, the middle-aged man glanced at Lin Xiu and Hua Tian, then thought for a moment and said, “Leave.”

Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief when he heard his words.

The strength of these people was still a bit too strong for Lin Xiu to deal with. At his current level, it was impossible to deal with so many rank 6 and rank 7 warriors.

If these people really wanted to do something and they really fought, they can only escape.

“Wait, give me the contents in the backpack.” Just when Lin Xiu was about to leave, a warrior looked at Lin Xiu’s backpack and felt that there seemed to be something inside Lin Xiu’s backpack. The existence of many Odd crystals made his eyes lit up and he said with a greedy face.

Lin Xiu’s expression changed but he ignored him and continued to walk forward.

“Stop there!” The warrior saw that Lin Xiu didn’t seem to hear him and continued to walk which angered him.

“Don’t pay attention to him.” Hua Tian glanced behind and said faintly.

Lin Xiu nodded and the two of them continued to walk forward without looking back.

At this moment, the person behind held the long sword in his hand and stabbed Lin Xiu from the back!

Swish——

His speed was very fast and the moment the sword went across, it cut through the air with a swish.

His companions couldn’t help but cock their mouths as they watched this scene.

This is the Dark Forest, they were not in a big city. If anyone is killed, no one will be held accountable.

Dang–

But just when his long sword was about to stab Lin Xiu in the back, the sound of metals colliding resounded.

Lin Xiu seemed to have expected that the man would attack him a long time ago. At this moment, he already prepared the Dark Edge spear in his hand and blocked the attack.

His long sword collided with the tip of the Dark Edge spear and gave off a spark.

“Boy, you’re crazy ah.” The man looked at Lin Xiu with a grim expression.

Lin Xiu made a move suddenly and blocked his attack which surprised him.

Lin Xiu ignored him. At this moment, the spear in his hand moved and he continued to attack!

As soon as the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand thrust out, it was as if dozens of black shadows appeared and he stabbed the man’s body wildly.
