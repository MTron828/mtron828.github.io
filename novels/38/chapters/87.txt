Chapter 88: I Want To Be Your Teacher

“I’ve decided,” Baili Haoling suddenly looked at Lin Xiu earnestly and said.

‘What did you decide!’ Lin Xiu became afraid as he wanted to distance himself even further.

‘Now that he has chased everyone away, is he going to do something to me since we’re alone?’

Lin Xiu immediately felt conflicted.

“I want to be your teacher,” Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu seriously and said. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lin Xiu was startled and blurted out subconsciously, “Teacher?”

“Hmm, that’s not bad, you’re quick to learn.” Baili Haoling nodded his head in satisfaction.

‘Pei pei pei! He’s too shameless!’

“I mean to say, I don’t need you to be my teacher.” Lin Xiu was perspiring all over at this point.

“You already have a teacher?” Baili Haoling asked in surprise.

“No.”

“You think you’re as strong as me?”

“No…”

“Then that’s that.” Baili Haoling was satisfied once again.

“I think you’re younger than me…” Lin Xiu mouth twitched.

Not only did Baili Haoling look younger than him, but he was even a head shorter. He actually dared to want to be his teacher?

Baili Haoling heard his words and was enlightened. He immediately replied, “You think I’m younger than you.”

“Let me tell you this, I’m much older than you.”

Baili Haoling said mysteriously.

“How old?”

“Age is… a man’s secret!” When he heard Lin Xiu’s probe, he immediately snorted.

Lin Xiu frowned with black lines all over his body, how could a guy actually distort the saying?

As though having thought about something, he chuckled again, “Why don’t we have a bout,? If you lose, you’ll be my disciple.”

“No.” Lin Xiu shook his head. He knew that he could not fight Baili Haoling in that state.

“I can suppress myself to a rank 1 warrior and fight you without weapons.” Baili Haoling smirked and suggested.

Lin Xiu squinted his eyes. If that was the case, he felt that he could spar with him.

He decided to take the opportunity to teach the guy for wanting to be his teacher.

“Alright.” Lin Xiu stood up and cracked his knuckles.

Baili Haoling put his sabers down on the ground and looked over.

Lin Xiu was able to sense Baili Haoling’s aura turning weaker.

“Is this ok?” Baili Haoling chuckled.

“Yes.” Lin Xiu nodded his head. He proceeded to move into his battle stance.

His gaze turned cold as well.

“Come.” Baili Haoling hooked his finger provocatively towards Lin Xiu.

The instant his words finished, Lin Xiu charged at him!

Rupturing Fist!!!

He imbued source strength into the gloves and produced a whistling sound as his fist shuttled through the air.

His gloves turned red like a red meteor.

Baili Haoling did not attempt to dodge and actually sent a fist towards Lin Xiu as well!

‘Seeking death!’

Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted.

‘He is really looking to die, I’m already wearing gloves and it is considered a weapon. He dropped his power to rank 1 and wants to fight fist against fist with me, what is he doing!’

But right at the instant when the fists collided, Lin Xiu felt a powerful force and he was immediately thrown into the air!

With a loud bang, he fell head first into the river and was drenched.

“How was it?” Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu inside the river and asked.

Lin Xiu walked out of the river and wiped the water off his face. What did just happen?

Their fists had just collided, but the one to fly was him?

“Don’t you find it inconceivable?” Baili Haoling asked as Lin Xiu slowly walked over with a pleased expression on his face.

“I didn’t use power above rank 1.”

“How did you do that?” Lin Xiu could no longer resist asking.

It was too miraculous, if he did not use power above rank 1, how in the world did he conjure such power?

“Call me Master,” Baili Haoling replied cheekily.

Lin Xiu clenched his teeth. It had to be said, this arrogant person was the strongest warrior he had ever met. He did not even have such a feeling when fighting against Tang Mubai.

“Mas…ter…” Lin Xiu deflated like a balloon and called out in the end.

“Hahaha, not bad, not bad.” Baili Haoling laughed and raised his chin up as though he was flaunting himself.

Lin Xiu was frowning with black lines all over his face. ‘Is this guy….really an expert…’

“Alright, do you know why your punch did not hit me?” Baili Haoling turned serious again.

Lin Xiu shook his head, it was what he was most suspicious of. His Rupturing Fist was not something anyone would dare to receive head-on. Not only did he take it on, but he even reversed the flow and flung Lin Xiu away. This was what made Lin Xiu flabbergasted.

“Source strength, your method of using source strength is completely wrong.” Baili Haoling sat down and replied indifferently.

“Method is completely wrong?” Lin Xiu was startled.

“Take a look.” Baili Haoling picked up a rock from the ground.

“This is a rock. If I put source strength in, it will become even tougher.”

He picked up the rock and smashed it onto a bigger rock on the ground. With a loud bang, the bigger rock cracked, but the rock in his hand also broke.

“After imbuing source strength, although the rock’s hardness has increased, it is fundamentally still a rock. Even after you put source strength in, the hardness will increase by 0.5 times at most.”

Lin Xiu pondered on his words. In fact, all of his own training was done by himself without guidance. The words had opened up new thoughts for him.

“But if you imbue source strength onto the surface and wrap it like this…” Baili Haoling picked up another rock and smirked.

He then smashed it onto another bigger rock which crumbled into pieces.

But the rock in his hand remained unscratched.
