Chapter 882: Zhao Family Nine-Story Pagoda

Zhao Xiaoqing led Lin Xiu to the front.

Soon, Lin Xiu could clearly see that there was a huge mansion in front of him.

Above the gate, it was written in big calligraphy characters: Zhao Family.

“The holy-level skill card you want is inside.”

Zhao Xiaoqing said aloud.

Lin Xiu didn’t have any expression on his face at this time, and walked in directly with Zhao Xiaoqing.

Hmph, just see what happens to you later!

Seeing that Lin Xiu was still calm, Zhao Xiaoqing secretly said in her heart.

“Miss Zhao? Where have you been? I searched for you all day and couldn’t find you.”

As soon as she walked in, an old man dressed in the appearance of a housekeeper just walked out. Looking at Zhao Xiaoqing, he said anxiously.

“Nothing, just went hunting with a group of adventurers.”

Zhao Xiaoqing stuck out her tongue playfully and said.

“You have to tell Uncle Fu next time, otherwise I won’t be able to explain to the master if something happens...”

The old man whispered to Zhao Xiaoqing at this time.

“understood.”

Zhao Xiaoqing was a little helpless.

“This is...”

Uncle Fu only noticed at this time that there was a man beside Zhao Xiaoqing.

It was the first time he saw Zhao Xiaoqing bring a man back and had a look of disbelief in his eyes.

“He’s here to get that skill card.”

Zhao Xiaoqing hesitated for a while, then said aloud.

“Oh.”

Uncle Fu looked at Lin Xiu, and then showed a strange look.

Um?

Seeing Uncle Fu’s expression, Lin Xiu couldn’t help being stunned. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Could it be that there’s something weird about it?

“Okay, Uncle Fu, go do your work first, I’ll take him there first.”

Zhao Xiaoqing pushed uncle Fu away at this time.

“Sure sure sure.”

Uncle Fu said helplessly.

After watching Uncle Fu leave, Zhao Xiaoqing turned to Lin Xiu, “Let’s go, let’s go over there.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

Seeing Lin Xiu still showing no expression, Zhao Xiaoqing felt a little depressed.

Why doesn’t he feel confused or depressed?

The Zhao family covers a large area. After walking for a long distance, there is a huge nine-story tower in front.

There is a huge stone gate under the tower, and two huge demons are carved on the left and right sides of the stone gate.

The demon’s eyes seemed to be staring at the approaching person, and it looked a bit scary.

“Damn, this is too difficult.”

And under this tower, there are several warriors who are trying to push the stone door open.

But no matter how hard they tried, the door didn’t seem to budge.

“The skill card you want is on top.”

Zhao Xiaoqing stood here and pointed to the ninth floor of the nine-story tower.

The Zhao family’s nine-story pagoda has a holy-level skill card on the top floor. Only those who pass the test of the nine-story pagoda can obtain it.

But after so many years, no one ever got it.

“Are you messing with me?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said lightly.

Looking at Lin Xiu’s eyes, although Zhao Xiaoqing was a little scared, she still raised her chest and said, “I meant to give you a holy-level skill card, but you can only get it yourself.”

“I didn’t say I would deliver it to you in person.”

Zhao Xiaoqing quibble.

“You’re sure you want me to take it myself.”

Lin Xiu said with narrowed eyes.

“There is indeed a holy-level skill card. It’s on it. Whether you can get it or not depends on your own ability.”

Zhao Xiaoqing spread out his hands, pretending to be helpless.

Hmph, how can it be so easy to get a holy-level skill card!

And for Lin Xiu, a guy who has always been expressionless, she wanted to see Lin Xiu looking depressed.

But what was different from what she had imagined was that Lin Xiu looked at the nine-story pagoda at this time, and walked directly over there.

Huh?

Zhao Xiaoqing was stunned for a moment, but he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu didn’t ask anything, just walked over there.

“How heavy is this door...”

The muscles of a middle-aged man’s whole body have swelled and the source strength of his body has also been used to the extreme.

But even so, there is still no way to open the stone door.

“Hmph, get out of the way. This skill card belongs to me, Pang Hu!”

At the same time, a warrior with a huge body and terrifying muscles came over, pushed the man away, and stood in front of the stone gate.

“Is it Pang Hu? Is Pang Hu here?”

When some warriors around saw this scene, their eyes were full of shock.

Pang Hu, a king warrior-level character with very powerful physical strength.

Many warriors around seemed to be very surprised when they saw his appearance.

The warrior who was pushed away by Pang Hu was about to get angry, but when he saw that it was Pang Hu, they all backed away angrily.

“Humph.”

Pang Hu looked at the stone gate of the nine-story pagoda, and snorted coldly, all the source energy in his body gathered in his hands.

A pair of huge and muscular arms, at this time, was covered with a layer of blue translucent energy.

This is the materialized source strength.

Only when the source power is extremely strong can it be clearly seen with the naked eye.

“open!”

As soon as he stepped on the ground, the whole ground seemed to vibrate.

He slapped the stone door with his palms, let out a low roar, and pushed the stone door open slowly.

cluck cluck—

With the strength of his hands, the stone door had been cracked open, and as it was slowly pushed open, there was a strange sound.

“It’s... it’s opened!?”

When the others saw this scene, their eyes widened.

As expected of Pang Hu, he is indeed amazing!

When the others saw this scene, they also said a little excitedly.

Because from just now, so many people, no one has been able to push this stone gate open at all.

But now Pang Hu pushed it open directly, which shocked many people.

“what!!!”

Seeing that the stone gate was being pushed further and further open, Pang Hu continued to roar, and the whole person rushed in when the stone gate cracked a gap just enough to accommodate him!

Boom—

As soon as his men rushed in, the stone gate instantly returned to its original position and closed, and a loud noise erupted.

“Got... got in!?”

Pang Hu really went in! It seems that this holy-level skill card is going to be obtained by Pang Hu!

Some of the surrounding warriors were shocked at this time.

“It’s not that easy. Entering the door is only the most basic. Inside, there are nine levels of challenges.”

The warrior who didn’t open the stone gate just now sat on the ground beside him and said with a cold snort.

bang bang bang-

At the same time, inside the nine-story tower, there seemed to be a sound of fighting.

These warriors want to see it, but there are no windows on this floor, so they can’t see what’s going on inside.

boom–

It didn’t take long for a window on the second floor to open, and a huge figure flew down directly from the stone window!
