Chapter 81: Ninth Heaven Phoenix Dance!

Gold skill!?

Lin Xiu was stunned at this moment.

A powerful source strength surged out of Tang Mubai’s body and went directly into the sword in his hand.

The whole ground seemed to be trembling due to this powerful source strength.

And the ground around him began to sink in.

‘This gold skill is so terrifying!?’

Lin Xiu was astonished. He looked at Tang Mubai who appeared like he was accumulating force and waved his spear as a phoenix pounded against Tang Mubai.

But to Lin Xiu’s surprise, not only did nothing happen when the phoenix struck against Tang Mubai’s body, but it seemed like the fluctuation of the source strength also became stronger.

‘How did this happen!?’

“Go to hell!!!” Tang Mubai hollered ferociously. In the next second, his whole body seemed to be covered by a huge flame and the shape of the flame was like a phoenix born out of fire. The whole scene was spectacular!

Then, that huge fiery phoenix instantly flew toward Lin Xiu!

Tang Mubai, who was in the center of the flames, held his sword and stabbed Lin Xiu!

His momentum was amazing, a fierce wind was blowing, and all the dust and dirt on the ground rose up.

Lin Xiu turned his body to dodge, but he found that this ‘fiery phoenix’ actually followed him and kept attacking!

“You think you can run, huh!” Tang Mubai chuckled.

Lin Xiu didn’t dare to use the ‘Awe of the Phoenix’ at this moment. It also had the same flaming property, and not only would it not cause Tang Mubiai any harm, but it would also increase his strength.

Lin Xiu’s eyes turned icy. Just as Tang Mubai was about to attack him, Lin Xiu gritted his teeth.

There’s no other way, he had to go all-out!

‘Adjudicate’!!!

Lin Xiu’s spear drew a special arc and Tang Mubai, who was about to hit Lin Xiu, had a change of expression because he sensed an aura coming from Lin Xiu that was similar to his own.

When Tang Mubai looked carefully, he found that a gigantic fiery phoenix illusion appeared on Lin Xiu’s body and it was exactly the same as his ‘Ninth Heaven Phoenix Dance’!

‘How is that possible!?’

Tang Mubai was shocked, and in the next moment, the two fiery phoenixes collided, letting out a deafening explosion!

The thick dust on the ground rose up.

In the dust, Lin Xiu’s spear and Tang Mubai’s sword collided. In the next second, there was a sweet taste in Lin Xiu’s throat and he spat out a mouthful of fresh blood. He was sent flying like a broken kite and knocked against the trunk of one of the huge trees a distance away.

Sure enough, the gold skill was much stronger than his skill. Even if he used ‘Adjudicate’ to make an illusion of the same skill to fight back, it was definitely not comparable to Tang Mubai’s.

“Hahaha! So it’s just a bluff, I thought you could use the same skill as me!” Tang Mubai laughed, then without any hesitation, he tapped on the ground with his heel and flew over to Lin Xiu.

He was like a dragonfly moving across the water.

‘Floating Body Skill!’

“So fast…” Although Lin Xiu felt the sharp pain throughout his body and his chest was still a little stiff, he quickly grabbed his spear at this moment, ready to face an attack.

Attack is the best defense!

“Courting death!” Tang Mubai saw that Lin Xiu not only refused to dodge, but he even wanted to face the attack directly. Tang Mubai was enraged and thrust his sword toward Lin Xiu.

Dang dang dang——

A series of weapons knocking against one another resounded and there were already many cracks on Lin Xiu’s spear at this moment.

Tang Mubai knitted his brows. Lin Xiu wasn’t a rank 3 warrior at all and didn’t know any body skills. So, how could he move so quickly? Also, Lin Xiu was moving almost at the same speed as Tang Mubai!?

‘It doesn’t matter, I don’t believe that you can continue this way!’

Tang Mubai roared in his heart and his attacks became more aggressive.

Lin Xiu thought that he was doomed; he could sense Tang Mubai becoming stronger. Also, Lin Xiu had just suffered internal injuries and it was very hard for him to continue blocking Tang Mubai’s attacks.

And most importantly, Tang Mubai’s weapon wasn’t any ordinary weapon while Lin Xiu’s spear was indeed an ordinary long spear!

“Go to hell!” Tang Mubai also obviously noticed this situation and slashed with a powerful force!

Lin Xiu was taken aback, and as he instinctively blocked the attack with his spear, there was a loud “dang”.

The sword had chopped the head of the spear off and the spear was broken!

Dang——

As the spearhead fell to the ground, Tang Mubai’s pupils constricted and his sword stabbed into Lin Xiu’s shoulder!

The second Lin Xiu was stabbed, he immediately thrust his spear toward Tang Mubai and attacked his chest.

“You’ve lost your spearhead and you’re still trying to kill me!?” Tang Mubai laughed.

Soon, however, his smile froze because he felt this spear piercing through his chest.

“Have you forgotten the source strength?” Lin Xiu sneered.

With the source strength imbued, any blunt weapon could become sharp with the source strength covering it.

And at this instant, a small flame revolving around the body of the spear was transmitted to Tang Mubai’s body.

“You are dead!” Lin Xiu roared and the flames from the spear entered Tang Mubai’s chest!!!

The phoenix from the Awe of the Phoenix might not deal a lot of damage when it directly hit Tang Mubai’s body. However, it was now targeting the most vulnerable part of his body, his chest!

“Ah!!!” Tang Mubai’s face appeared to be cramping up due to the severe pain.

Bang—— 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As warm blood splattered all over his chest, Tang Mubai’s eyes were wide open as his body went limp and he fell to the ground as if he died with a grievance.

Just like in Stephen Chow’s movie, Lin Xiu really wanted to say, ‘Who said you can’t kill without a spear head?’

But by this time, he had no more strength left and was on the ground at the next second too.

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 3 warrior and gaining 547,821 experience points.”

‘More than half a million experience points?’ Lin Xiu was a little surprised at the moment, but of course, this chap was close to a rank 4 warrior, after all.

“Huff, huff.” After panting for quite some time, Lin Xiu resisted the pain on his shoulder and pulled out the sword forcefully from his shoulder.
