Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The golden boxes were made of some unknown material and it was glowing brightly.

Lin Xiu reached out his left hand and kept both the boxes.

“You are the one who killed the men from the Divine Domain?”

Yi Changkong looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

“What do you think?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes before saying.

“Alright. You can all leave now. The cultivation ends here.”

Yi Changkong did not say much before waving off the rest of the warriors.

This was because everything was self explanatory. The warriors from the Divine Domain were all killed by Lin Xiu.

Yi Changkong who was usually unwaived was now filled with shocked.

How could such a young man have such strength?

“Next time, there will not be sage warrior space left for the cultivation.”

Yi Changkong looked at the rest of the warriors before saying.

As he told them about this, Yi Changkong looked a little disappointed.

The Tianjiao Competition has been held for years and with the space breaking down now, he still felt a little sad.

The other sage warriors next to him looked disappointed as well.

“Changkong.”

Suddenly, an old man riding on the android cow came out of nowhere.

“Gatekeeper!”

When the rest of them saw him, the look in their eyes changed.

“Greetings, gatekeeper.”

When Yi Changkong saw Elder Ye, his eyes were filled with shock as well.

But, he still managed to answer him respectfully.

When Wang Qiang and the remaining warriors were answering so respectfully, they were all shocked.

These were the ten sage warriors?! Why were they being so respectful towards this old man?

Plus, gatekeeper? What does that even mean?

All of them looked puzzled.

“The sage warrior space might have disappeared but I will create another one.”

“The next Tianjiao Competition can still be continued.”

Elder Ye told the rest of the crowd.

“Really?!”

When Yi Changkong heard what the old man said, he looked surprised.

“En. When they created the space, it was not firm enough.”

“It was only a matter of time before the space collapsed.”

The old man explained to the rest of them.

“Fellas, you have been lucky.”

Elder Ye looked towards Wang Qiang and the rest of the warriors.

He swept his right hand and there was a bright light that came out from his palm.

Soon, the bright light directly entered their body.

Wang Qiang and the rest of them felt a strong surge of energy entering into their body.

“Such a powerful force…”

Their bodies were then completely enveloped by the white glow.

“Absorb the energy now.”

Lin Xiu told Wang Qiang who was still completely confused with what was happening.

“En.”

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, he immediately sat on the floor cross legged and started running his ‘cultivation technique’, trying to absorb the energy around them.

“What about me?”

Lin Xiu looked at the old man and asked.

The energy from the old man entered each of the warrior’s bodies except for Lin Xiu.

“You already have the best, what else do you want?”

The old man answered him without any hesitation and Lin Xiu turned speechless.

The best?

At the same time, there were two warriors behind Lin Xiu with masks on, glaring at Lin Xiu.

“That’s it. Yi Changkong, come with me to that place now..”

Elder Yi had a serious look on his face as he looked at the ten sage warriors before him.

“What’s the matter?”

When they heard the term ‘that place’, the look in their eyes changed.

“The seal is becoming unstable.”

Elder Ye answered bluntly.

The rest of the sage warriors looked solemn when they heard what the old man said.

“Alright. Come along.”

Elder Ye did not say much. He swept his left hand and there was a crescent shaped opening that appeared in the air.

When it happened, Lin Xiu was stunned.

He managed to open it so early?

Lin Xiu and the rest of them were stocked. This old man was definitely a warrior god.

His abilities now were already at its peak.

Yi Changkong and the rest of them suddenly disappeared through the crescent shaped opening.

As soon as they got into the other space, the entire opening closed.

“The seal? What’s that?”

Lin Xiu overheard the conversation and he was starting to get curious.

He turned towards the rest of them who were sitting on the ground, absorbing the energy that had been given to them.

Lin Xiu did not waste any time. He sat on the ground as well, trying to recover all of the energy that he had lost.

Soon, after half a day, all of the warriors managed to absorb all of the energy around them.

“I’m a sage warrior now?!”

Ji Mei opened her eyes and she was looking shocked.

Lin Xiu, who had finished much earlier than them, answered Wu Mei who was already covered in shock.

“En!”

Ji Mei was feeling extremely excited.

A sage warrior!

At the peak of a respected warrior, it was extremely hard for them to break through and become a sage warrior.

When she first heard that the sage warrior had collapsed, she thought that there wouldn’t be any chance left for her to break through.

But, she didn’t think that she would be able to become a sage warrior.

“Thank you.”

She looked at Lin Xiu before thanking him.

“Why are you thanking me?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Lin Xiu found it funny after hearing what Ji Mei was saying to him.

The reason why she could become a sage warrior was not because of him, it was because of the energy given to her by the old man.

“Thank you for giving me the Angel’s tears.”

Ji Mei continued asking.

Although she was now a sage warrior, she still felt that Lin Xiu was still a mystery to her.

It was impossible to see him through.

“It’s nothing.”

Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders.

“Where…..are you going to go?”

Ji Mei thought about it before asking.

“I don’t know. Out and about.”

Lin Xiu joked around with Ji Mei.

Ji Mei rolled her eyes at Lin Xiu and a smile appeared on his face.

She felt that Lin Xiu wouldn’t stay here for anyone.

He definitely wouldn’t stop at Namir Planet. He would be heading for somewhere else that could offer him more things.

Although she felt a little disappointed, she thought about it for a moment before taking out a flat box from her pocket.

“This is for you.”

Ji Mei looked at Lin Xiu with a smile on her face.

“This…”
