Chapter 131: 1 Billion Experience Points!

Liu Qiang chased after Lin Xiu from behind with a sinister look on his face.

He was much faster than Lin Xiu and immediately caught up to him!

But Lin Xiu rushed right in.

Liu Qiang snorted and unleashed even more strength. The door that Lin Xiu had difficulty opening was instantly pushed open by him and he rushed right in!

As he charged in, the inside was completely dark. Fortunately, his night vision was clear and he was able to see his surroundings, but he realized that Lin Xiu had disappeared!

All around him were weapons, as though he had arrived in an arsenal of some sorts.

And right at this time, he noticed that there were bombs everywhere, and there were a few ahead that had blinking red light.

He seemed to realize something as his face changed.

Shit!!!

“Goodbye.” Lin Xiu had actually rushed out the moment Liu Qiang had barged in. He had his back against the door as he revealed a smile and muttered to himself.

He discovered that the bombs were still in working order when he was here, so he took one.

He immediately activated it when Liu Qiang rushed in. With the explosion of one bomb he believed that the other bombs would detonate as well. The immense power would definitely turn his bones to powder!

Rumble-

In the next moment, an immense explosion occurred and Lin Xiu was flung outwards from the powerful shockwave.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing rank 5 warrior, obtaining 12000000 experience points!”

“Congratulations Master for levelling up, you are now level 19!”

“Congratulations….”

Lin Xiu could not focus on the notifications. The large explosion caused the entire floor to shake as though it was an earthquake with a magnitude of 8.0.

Lin Xiu felt pain all over his body as his mind buzzed incessantly.

The wounds on his body had blood all over.

Damn it…

He stopped for a moment and waited for the tremors to stop completely before struggling to stand up. As his shaky mind started to stabilize, his vision became normal again.

“How painful…” Lin Xiu stood up and all the pain caused him to grit his teeth.

But the end result was good, he had killed Liu Qiang and had gained all the experience points.

Seems like he had to get rid of his opponents completely by himself and not supplement with an attack on a dying person to obtain all the experience points.

Level 19! Lin Xiu felt that a new skill would appear once he leveled up to level 20.

The metal walls here were too exaggerated… The large explosion only caused a dent and did not destroy any of the walls.

“Are you guys alright?” Lin Xiu picked up the Dark Edge spear and looked behind him to Zhang Yin and his team.

All the warriors present had died and only Zhang Yin, Jiang Li, Lei Lei, as well as Zhang Yin’s friend Qin Li who were alive. Although there was blood on their bodies, none of them sustained any severe injuries.

“It’s fine.” Zhang Yin shook his head.

But his mind continued to buzz.

“You just killed Liu Qiang…?” Zhang Yin hesitated for a moment before asking Lin Xiu.

“He’s dead.” Lin Xiu replied indifferently.

Everyone inhaled in cold air when they heard Lin Xiu’s reply, while they were trembling from battling against the zombies, they saw Lin Xiu and Liu Qiang fighting each other. But they did not expect Lin Xiu to kill Liu Qiang.

That was a rank 5 warrior!

But after thinking about that large explosion, they seemed to have recalled something.

Everyone took out medicine from their bags. After treating themselves, they started to extract valuable parts of the rank 6 green vine beast. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Lin Xiu was not interested in it. He only required the crystal.

“We should be able to get out once we move ahead.” Lin Xiu looked at the path and said.

This was the only path that seemed extremely long without an end.

“I guess so.” Zhang Yin was slightly uncertain.

“Aside from this, there’s nowhere else to go. All of us had previously run around the base and only found this location.” Qin Li explained.

He sustained more injuries but found many medicines in the dead warriors’ bags. His body was completely wrapped with bandages and looked to be in a difficult situation.

Lin Xiu nodded his head and continued ahead. The path was extremely narrow and looking down to the sides felt as though they were standing on the top of a black abyss.

Woosh-

At the same time, Lin Xiu was able to hear faint water sounds with his sharp ears.

Was this rank 6 green vine beast intentionally reared in the past to prevent people from going across…

Jiang Li and the others were trembling slightly while on the narrow path.

There were no railings and if careless, one would fall into the water. Whether or not they could climb up was one thing, but no one knew if there were anymore terrifying creatures below. That would definitely lead to a painful death.

Lin Xiu continued ahead silently.

Apart from the evolved beast earlier, he believed that there should no longer be any.

The road was long and he walked for a long time before reaching the end.

At the end, he saw the same metal wall but there was a distinct rectangle groove. It resembled the metal door from earlier that could be pushed.

‘What the hell!!!’

Lin Xiu wanted to curse out loud. The stats wanted him dead, previously he was still anticipating to get to level 20 to obtain a new skill and even potentially unlock level 2 Gene Lock. Who would have thought that he needed 1 billion experience points?
