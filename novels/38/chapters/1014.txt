Chapter 1015: The Space Collapsed

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“It’s good material. I can use it for repairs.”

The old man suddenly spoke out of nowhere.

After hearing what the answer was, Lin Xiu almost fell to the ground.

“You can’t use this as random material!”

Lin Xiu snatched the Imperial Order from him and placed the Imperial Order back into his expansion space.

!!

“Hmm? Where did you put it?”

The old man looked at Lin Xiu from top to bottom and he realised that the Imperial Order was no longer with Lin Xiu.

“I kept it.”

Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders and answered the old man.

“Right. What else are you going to give me, Elder Ye?”

Lin Xiu asked the old man.

The old man seemed to have loads of treasures. If he could get a few more, it would be better than walking out with nothing.

“That was the prize.”

Elder Ye looked at Lin Xiu in suspicion. He slowly and carefully pointed at the necklace on Lin Xiu’s neck.

When Lin Xiu saw how he reacted, Lin Xiu almost lost it as it made Lin Xiu look like a scammer trying to take away things from an elderly.

“So, that belongs to me, right?”

Lin Xiu pointed at the Angel standing behind him.

The armour of the Angel was made up of some unknown material and it was extremely hard.

Even if it was Huang Fubo who received the ‘God Descend’, he still couldn’t break the armour. The only damage he did was a small dent on it.

“En. I can give that to you.”

Elder Ye nodded his head.

“By the way, how did you break through my system?”

The old man was suddenly reminded of something and he asked Lin Xiu about it.

“It’s a secret.”

Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders.

“You brat!”

Elder Ye widened his eyes in rage when he heard the answer.

“This is the strongest robot that I have built. Plus, it has the potential to grow.”

Elder Ye said to Lin Xiu.

“Potential to grow?”

Lin Xiu was stunned when he heard the words of the old man.

“En. After this, if you have any powerful odd crystals, you can place them inside her forge.”

“Usually, she would automatically absorb the energy from the air and turn it into the energy that she could use.”

As Elder Ye continued introducing the Angel, Lin Xiu was thoroughly shocked.

“Alright. You should go. This space is about to collapse.”

Lin Xiu was still in shock when Elder Ye told him another shocking news.

“Collapsed?”

Lin Xiu was stunned as he asked subconsciously.

“Of course! You have been fighting relentlessly in this place and even broke the space. Now, the entire space is extremely unstable.”

“If you don’t want to be pulled into the current, you should leave now.”

With that said, Lin Xiu did not have the time to answer before he was thrown out of the place by the old man!

“Damn it!”

Seeing how his body was being thrown into the air, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but curse.

Suddenly, the Angel flew towards him and caught Lin Xiu.

The huge machinery city then disappeared into thin air.

“That old man…”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but swear when he saw what happened.

He was now standing on the shoulder of the Angel. As he looked around, he noticed that there were multiple cracks in the sky.

This space was no longer as stable as before. It looked like it was about to collapse anytime soon.

Looks like the battles that he had previously must have been too harsh on the space, making it extremely unstable.

If this continued, the entire space would definitely collapse.

“Those who are here for cultivation, please leave right away.”

At the same time, there was a huge opening that appeared in the air.

Then, Yi Changkong’s voice rang throughout the space.

The warriors with the rings suddenly felt their body being pulled by an anonymous force.

Then, they were all dragged into the sky.

Wang Qiang couldn’t help but shriek as well.

As he looked into the air and saw how his master, Lin Xiu was riding the Angel towards the opening in the air, he let out a breath of relief.

When Duan Zheyan saw his body flying towards the air, his eyes were filled with joy.

He’s leaving this place!!! He has been in this space for 10 years and now he’s finally leaving!

Wu Mei and the rest of them were pulled by the same force as well as they flew into the air.

Lin Xiu sat on the Angel and looked down at the ground beneath him. He could clearly see that the entire place was falling apart.

The grounds cracked open and water suddenly rushed in.

Xiu – –

At that moment, Lin Xiu followed the rest of them and left the space.

“I’m finally back!!!”

Duan Zheyan’s body appeared outside the space and he was feeling excited.

As he laughed out loud, there were tears in his eyes as well.

He has been stuck inside for too long. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Lin Xiu, you got out as well?”

Wu Mei got out of the space as well and she was delighted to see Lin Xiu who had just jumped off the Angel.

Lin Xiu nodded his head in return.

“Warriors! Please gather here!”

Yi Changkong called out to the warriors.

His voice rang through the space.

All of the warriors who had gotten out of the space walked closer to him including Lin Xiu.

Yi Changkong looked aro7und and noticed that there were only 8 of them left.

This was something unexpected.

“The sage warrior space has been destroyed and therefore, the cultivation will be ending now.” Yi Changkong said to the rest of them.

After hearing the announcement, the rest of them nodded their heads.

This was because they could clearly see that the entire space was breaking down.

“First on the ranking, Lin Xiu.”

Yi Changkong looked at the crowd and looked at Lin Xiu as he made the announcement.

After hearing the announcement, everyone turned towards Lin Xiu.

Seeing how many rings Lin Xiu had on his arm, their eyes were filled with shock.

Including Wu Mei.

She didn’t think that after Lin Xiu left the Ancient Ruins, he still got so many rings.

Then, she thought of the huge commotion that happened inside the space. It was as if everyone could hear the fight. Could it be because of Lin Xiu…?

As she put things together, she was looking at Lin Xiu with admiration.

“Looks like you have the most rings as well.”

Yi Changkong looked at Lin Xiu’s arms that were filled with rings.

Xiu – –

He swept his left hand and there were two golden boxes made of a special material that appeared in front of Lin Xiu.
