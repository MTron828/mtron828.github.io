Chapter 814: The Competition Begins

The next day came quickly.

Early in the morning, everyone gathered at the gate of the hotel here.

Jiang Jun led the team to the other side of the field.

This time, because there were many people participating in the warrior competition, in order to quickly decide the top 36, it is divided into four venues, east, west, north and south. Each venue will determine the top nine, then on the second day, the final duel will happen on the biggest tournament stage in Fengyun City – Feixian stage.

“Those on the East follow Zhang Jun and those on the West follow…” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“When you get there, take out your entry cards, then draw lots. You’ll compete according to the arrangement of the staff.”

Jiang Jun said aloud as he led Lin Xiu and the others forward.

When these warriors heard his words, their bodies trembled with excitement.

After all, the competition was about to start and it was even held in Fengyun City.

Qian Jin and Lin Xiu were assigned to the East and Jiang Jun led them there.

“This is the eastern battlefield? It’s so big…”

Walking to the front, Qian Jin looked at it from a distance. The so-called eastern battlefield covers a huge area and is an open field.

It’s like being on a huge football field.

In all directions, there are already a large number of people sitting on the seats.

“Hurry up and sign in, then draw lots.”

Jiang Jun said to Lin Xiu and Qian Jin at this time.

He was optimistic about Lin Xiu and Qian Jin, so he personally led them here.

As long as Lin Xiu and Qian Jin achieve good rankings, it will be good news for Tianlong City, or for him.

Take out your entry card and go to the competition area to compete.

The lottery was drawn very randomly. As Lin Xiu clicked on a large screen in front of him, the numbers turned and soon, the two numbers “18” appeared.

“You are No. 18. You can wait in the waiting area here.”

A staff member put a circular number plate with ’18’ written on it in front of Lin Xiu’s chest and said aloud.

Lin Xiu nodded. In the waiting area, he could clearly see that there were many warriors here.

The Analytic Eye swept across and it was clear that most of them were master warrior-level warriors.

The strength seems to be quite strong.

“Lin Xiu, what’s your number?”

Qian Jin came over at this time and said with a smile.

“18.”

“Damn, fortunately, I’m number 20.”

When Qian Jin heard Lin Xiu’s words, he could not help but heaved a sigh of relief.

If they fought in order and you are next to Lin Xiu’s number, you are likely to meet Lin Xiu.

Although he always wanted to fight Lin Xiu before, Lin Xiu was too perverted.

They haven’t seen each other for just a month, but his strength has grown to such an extent.

There were more than 100 warriors in this east field and each warrior was an elite among the elites sent from cities all over the world.

“Okay! The competition is about to start!”

“In the first match, No. 5 will play No. 13!”

“They are Lei Zhan from Kaiyang City and Lin Yong from Shenmu City!”

At this moment, as the host’s voice sounded, the whole venue was boiling.

The competition has finally started!

“These two people look quite strong.”

In the waiting area of ??the participating warriors, Qian Jin couldn’t help saying aloud while watching the scene on the field.

“They’re okay, both of them are master warrior-level warriors.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Master Warrior-level!?”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Qian Jin’s eyes widened.

“Didn’t you also step into the master warrior-level?”

Lin Xiu rolled his eyes at him.

“I’ve just been promoted to the Master warrior-level not long ago...” Qian Jin said a little depressed.

He didn’t expect that there were so many master warrior-level warriors.

From this perspective, the rest of the Tianlong City contestants should be miserable.

boom boom boom —

And at this time, the battle on the field has reached a white-hot battle.

The whole ground seems to be shaking slightly because of this battle.

“Don’t let me fight a pervert like you later.”

Qian Jin said aloud while watching the scene on the field.

Because from this battle, it seems to be random numbers drawn and the number is just a sign for people.

Lin Xiu was not interested in fighting and his eyes were still searching for Luo Yue’s figure.

But unfortunately, although there are some female warriors, Luo Yue was not seen at all.

Is it because Luo Yue didn’t come, or was it because she wasn’t in this venue?

And on the other side.

“After the competition is over, you can hold your engagement ceremony.”

Luo Yue’s elder brother Luo Jiucheng said to Luo Yue at this time.

“I reject.”

Luo Yue still said so coldly.

“You!”

When Luo Jiucheng heard Luo Yue’s words, he was instantly angry.

But thinking of the benefits to their Luo family as long as the marriage is successful, he calmed down.

“Humph!”

“Luo Yan, you take her to the competition, get a good ranking and show it to the people from the Huang family.”

Luo Jiucheng said to Luo Yan.

“En.”

Luo Yan nodded.

The two quickly left Luo’s house and headed to the western battlefield.

Behind the two, there were two middle-aged men escorting them.

This is the bodyguard sent by Luo Jiucheng.

Said to be bodyguard, in fact, he was more like monitoring their actions.

“Don’t think we can escape.”

Luo Yan walked side by side with Luo Yue at this time and said in a low voice.

Luo Yue’s good-looking brows also furrowed slightly. The strength of the two ‘bodyguards’ behind them seemed to be at the level of King warrior.

She wanted to run, but she couldn’t.

“Let’s take part in the competition first.”

Luo Yue said.

“We can only do that.”

Soon, Luo Yue also entered the field to participate in the competition.

The West arena seems to have started a little slower due to a machine failure.

However, the registration and inspection of player information have already started and it will start soon.

Luo Yue stood in the waiting area for players and looked around as if she was expecting someone.

“Did I sense wrong...” Luo Yue put her hand on her chest and felt that her heart was beating a little faster.

“No. 18, Lin Xiu from Tianlong City, against No. 29, Jiang Mo from Cangqiong City!!!”

At this moment, with a loud voice, Lin Xiu immediately stood up from the seat in the contestant area.

“Lin Xiu, come on!”

Qian Jin also spoke to Lin Xiu at this time.

“En.”

Similarly, Jiang Mo also stood up from the chair on the other side.

Looking at Lin Xiu, there was a look of disdain in his eyes, then he raised his middle finger.

Eh?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but raise his brows. Even the Marqi planet does the middle finger?

As Lin Xiu and Jiang Mo stood on the stage, the host who rode the aircraft in the air shouted excitedly, “Okay! Both sides are ready!”

“Competition begins!!!”
