Chapter 276: Fighting A Rank 6 Evolved Beast Alone (II)

Rumble-

The Giant Black Rock Beast opened its large mouth and formed a large ball of blue energy and spat it at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu avoided the ball that struck the ground and formed a large pit.

The Giant Black Rock Beast had gone crazy after having one of its eyes destroyed.

It moved its limbs and its gigantic body started to charge towards Lin Xiu.

The Giant Black Rock Beast was large and according to logic, it should be slow. But at this moment, its berserk speed was truly too horrifying.

It charged forward and the ground around shook incessantly.

“Damn!”

Qiu Li was almost smashed down by the gigantic claws and cursed under his breath after narrowly avoiding the leg.

The Giant Black Rock Beast had its eye glued onto Lin Xiu and charged at him.

Lin Xiu did not dare be reckless and placed all of his focus on the Giant Black Rock Beast.

The Giant Black Rock Beast was like a train that charged straight on, allowing Lin Xiu to jump to the side and avoid it successfully.

But it did not let him go that easily. It turned and charged back at him!!!

Roar-

After a loud roar, it spewed out many balls of energy that destroyed the surrounding area.

The rocks on its body continued to fall and turned into shattered debris and shot at Lin Xiu like bullets.

But Lin Xiu moved too quickly like an agile monkey. It was impossible to hit Lin Xiu.

But of course, Lin Xiu was unable to find an opportunity to attack the Giant Black Rock Beast.

Its weakness was at its head and attacking its other body parts was useless.

But after experiencing having its eye destroyed, the Giant Black Rock Beast was obviously more cautious.

It was difficult for Lin Xiu to get close to its head.

“Guo Ling, what do we do now?” Qian Lin stood beside Guo Ling and watched as Lin Xiu battled against the Giant Black Rock Beast.

It was clear that the beast was infuriated by Lin XIu and wanted to kill him.

It’s erupted state wielded power that even a sphere formed by a rank 6 warrior could not handle.

“We can’t get close for now.” Guo Ling watched on and sighed.

The rank 6 evolved beasts in Dark Forest was too perverse. Not only were they extremely large, they were extremely strong as well.

They would not be able to approach or kill it instantly if they joined in.

“Damn it!” Qiu Li pressed his knuckles against each other in anger.

Everyone felt helpless against the terrifying Giant Black Rock Beast.

It was already dark and their surroundings had turned eerie.

But fortunately, their light installation was not completely destroyed and there were sources of light around them.

‘No, I’ll be exhausted to death if this goes on.’

Lin Xiu held Dark Edge and avoided the Giant Black Rock Beast while thinking to himself.

It seemed to possess endless energy and constantly charged at Lin Xiu.

One pounce with its immensely large body caused the ground to tremble.

Roar-

The Giant Black Rock Beast was infuriated at the fact that it was unable to land a strike on Lin Xiu. The eye that was pierced by Lin Xiu’s spear was bleeding incessantly.

This grotesque sight made it look even more so terrifying.

Lin Xiu watched as it raised its gigantic claw to smash down on him again. Lin Xiu made a move but instead of dodging, he charged towards the gigantic body!

“He’s taking action!” The rather quiet Wan Qianshui who was standing beside Qiu Li suddenly announced.

‘Taking action!?’

‘Can Lin Xiu really take care of this thing!?’

Upon hearing Wan Qianshui’s words, the others were stunned as they stared at Lin Xiu.

If they were in his place, they would most probably be killed by that thing.

Lin Xiu charged forward and the Giant Black Rock Beast missed its strike. Seeing Lin Xiu approaching, it used its other claw to smash down at him!

The claw moved extremely quickly and even produced vacuum sounds due to the velocity.

Bang-

Lin Xiu thought of dodging the claw but could not react fast enough as it reached him!

Qian Lin exclaimed out loud when she saw that.

But she regained herself because she recalled Lin Xiu’s strange skills.

As expected, Lin Xiu’s real body appeared in the air!

The Giant Black Rock Beast was fooled by Lin Xiu once again. It opened its mouth and spat out energy balls with the intent of exploding Lin Xiu to bits.

But it also seemed to become more anxious and reacted with its body.

It used its remaining eye to focus on Lin Xiu.

Roar-

Lin Xiu stabbed down towards its eye as the Giant Black Rock Beast let out a roar.

All the black rocks on its body exploded and shot towards Lin Xiu rapidly!

“Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall!!!!”

Lin Xiu held Dark Edge tightly and roared out loud while descending from the sky.

Stars quickly appeared before him.

Silver light blossomed out from Dark Edge.

Clank clank clank-

Lin Xiu swung Dark Edge repeatedly and struck the black rocks. He deflected every single rock that was aimed at him. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The spear drew silver arcs across the air and destroyed all the impending rocks!

“Go and die!” Lin Xiu roared out loud as he approached the head of the giant beast and swung hsi spear down. Like a silver comet, he rushed towards its eye!
