1298 Fight against Huangfu Gu!

The Fire of Chaos, also known as the Great Sun Golden Flame, is said to be the flame that was born when the world first began.

Even he dared not touch this kind of flame.

“En, it is rumored that when Xiao Qingchen went to the land of chaos in order to escape from powerful enemies, he had no choice but to enter a region burning with the fire of chaos.”

“The most surprising thing is that he came out alive in the end, and his whole body has been forged. His physical strength makes me feel ashamed.”

Zhang Qinghua said approvingly at this time.

“En, he can become a Noble God.”

Noble God Riyan looked at Xiao Qingchen who was waiting for the next battle, and said immediately.

Hearing his words, Zhang Qinghua and Wan Gan were not surprised.

After all, this Xiao Qingchen does have the strength.

“There’s also Yuan Zhen, Qian Yixiao… These warriors have all been on the list of noble gods, and their strength is very good.”

At this time, Wan Gan was looking at the various battle platforms below, talking eloquently.

At the same time, Lin Xiu fought the third battle.

“Lingxian City, are you the warrior from that small city?”

At this time, as soon as Lin Xiu came to the stage, the warriors on the opposite side began to mock.

These warriors seem to be very dismissive of Lingxian City, a little-known town. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

But Lin Xiu ignored his words. In the next moment, he took the White Moon spear in his hand and directly attacked!

“Lin Xiu, Lingxian City, wins!”

Soon, as the warrior fell into a pool of blood, his eyes widened in disbelief.

He never imagined that Lin Xiu possessed such powerful strength.

“The fourth match…”

“Lin Xiu from Lingxian City won!”

“Fifth match…”

Lin Xiu from Lingxian City won…”

At this time, as Lin Xiu continued to fight, the referee’s voice continued to come over.

“Nine consecutive victories!”

At this moment, Lei Tong secretly broke into a cold sweat.

Nine consecutive victories – it’s not easy ah.

Nine battles, almost no chance to rest in the middle.

The more the fight goes on, the more unfavorable it will be for Lin Xiu.

But in the end, Lin Xiu still won.

“No. 99, Lingxian City, Lin Xiu, and No. 10,000, Huangfu Gu from the holy city!”

Lin Xiu, who had just stood on the stage, heard the referee’s words, and the pupils in his eyes suddenly shrank.

Huangfu Gu, I seem to have heard of this name somewhere…

“Lin Xiu…?”

At this time, Huangfu Gu also jumped onto the battle stage, mumbling to himself.

But when he looked at Lin Xiu standing on the battle platform, his expression suddenly changed.

“Hahaha, one can wear iron shoes out in fruitless searching, and yet by luck, one may find it without even looking. Boy, you’re finally here!”

Huangfu Gu laughed wildly.

In the beginning, the people of Divine Domain used the method of descending the gods to come to earth, but they were defeated by Lin Xiu again and again, and even a lot of divine power was swallowed up by Lin Xiu.

To Huangfu Gu, this was a great shame and humiliation.

I’ve always wanted to find an opportunity to take revenge, but I haven’t found a suitable one.

“So it’s you; no wonder the name sounds familiar.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly at this time.

“By the way, some time ago, there were ruins in Lingxian City. Many of my subordinates passed by, but they all disappeared. Did you kill them?”

Huangfu Gu stared at Lin Xiu at this moment and said in a cold voice.

“So what.”

Lin Xiu sneered.

“Why? Aren’t you called Divine Domain? Why did you change the name to Holy City?”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Huangfu Gu’s face darkened.

Today, the capital of Tianling Kingdom is called City of God. As the city lord of a medium-sized city in Tianling Kingdom, how dare they continue to call themselves the Divine Domain?

This is a taboo.

“Anyway, this time, you are going to die here!”

Huangfu Gu ignored Lin Xiu’s words and gritted his teeth at this moment.

“Hm? Huangfu Gu from the holy city; I didn’t expect that he, who hasn’t participated in the competition for so many years, would come here this time.”

...

At this time, Zhang Qinghua, on the rostrum, looked at Huangfu Gu on the battle stage, showing surprise.

“Well, back then Huangfu Gu had a little strength, but he never participated in the Multi City contest. This time, he easily won nine consecutive victories. His strength is indeed good.”

Wan Gan also nodded and said.

“Who is he?”

Noble God Riyan ignored the words of these two people, and looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

Huangfu Gu has won nine consecutive victories, so the opponent is naturally a warrior who has won nine consecutive victories.

But Lin Xiu looks very young, and Noble God Riyan also found him very unfamiliar.

he has never seen this warrior before.

“The warrior of Lingxian City…”

“what?”

Wan Gan was also surprised when he saw Lin Xiu’s figure.

...

Lingxian City, he checked it out, it was clearly a small town.

Logically speaking, the city lord of this kind of small town is obviously a weak existence when he comes here.

But he actually won nine consecutive victories!

Noble God Riyan seemed to be very curious about Lin Xiu at this time, and looked at Lin Xiu at this time.

Lin Xiu, who was standing on the battle stage, was holding the White Moon spear tightly in his hand, and was about to wait for the referee’s voice to make a move.

But at this moment, a strange force came from behind.

A feeling of being stared at by someone gave Lin Xiu a chill down his spine.

Turning around suddenly and looking back, the strange feeling just now disappeared in an instant.

who is it?

At this moment, Lin Xiu frowned, but he couldn’t figure out who was spying on him.

“Kid has a quick reaction.”

Noble God Riyan was even more surprised at this time.

Just now he glanced at Lin Xiu to check Lin Xiu’s strength, but Lin Xiu quickly sensed it.

“interesting.”

Noble God Riyan, who had always been expressionless, became interested in this battle at this time.

“Although this kid’s strength is good, Huangfu Gu is very strong. The outcome of this round should be decided already.”

Wan Gan seemed to be very optimistic about Huangfu Gu. At this moment, he stroked his beard and said with a smile.

“No, I feel that this kid from Lingxian City may win.”

But at this moment, Noble God Riyan suddenly said.

Wan Gan and Zhang Qinghua were surprised when they heard the words of Noble God Riyan.

It was the first time they heard that Noble God Riyan was so optimistic about a warrior.

“Match begins!”

And Lin Xiu also heard the referee’s voice at this time.

As soon as the referee’s voice was heard, Lin Xiu’s whole body burst out with force, and rushed towards Huangfu Gu!

“Looking for death!”

A ferocious expression appeared on Huangfu Gu’s face. Holding a long sword, he rushed towards Lin Xiu in an instant!

His heart was full of resentment. Thinking of what happened before, he must make Lin Xiu unable to say ‘admit defeat’ and die directly on this battle platform!!!
