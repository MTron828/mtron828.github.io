Chapter 1132: Inside the Ruins

“Can only go in, can’t go out?”

Lin Xiu exerted a little force and found that he still had no way to break out of the light.

It seemed that after he entered, the light blocked him inside.

And at this time, Lin Xiu’s eyes could clearly see someone walking in from the outside.

!!

“Oh? You came in too?”

When the man saw Lin Xiu standing here, he sneered and said.

When he was outside, he noticed Lin Xiu.

After all, when Lin Xiu was cultivating at that time, he felt a lot of source strength gathered towards Lin Xiu.

At this time, Lin Xiu ignored his words.

“Hmph, there are some things that not everyone can get.”

When he saw that Lin Xiu didn’t pay attention to him, he snorted coldly.

Then went straight inside.

Lin Xiu looked at the passage at this time, then walked directly to the front.

This passage was very wide and very long.

Lin Xiu’s walking speed was not fast.

But after walking for a long time, he saw the Sage warrior-level warriors who had entered before. They all stopped there without any movement.

Hm?

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he immediately raised his brows.

Taking a closer look, he could see that there were a large number of warriors standing there in the front passage.

At this time, if you look closely, you can clearly see those warriors and they all look at the front passage, as if they are observing something.

Continuing to walk forward, he found that there were several corpses of warriors lying in front of them.

There are many blood holes on the corpses of these warriors and it seems that some powerful energy has penetrated their bodies.

Moreover, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that there was a strong aura around him.

“After all, it is the ruins of the Ye family. What did you expect huh? Any random person could enter?”

One of the Sage warriors sneered at this moment, moved and rushed forward.

Whoosh whoosh—

But when he rushed in, energy rays shot out from the surrounding walls!

These energy rays are different from ordinary energy rays and they were very powerful.

However, the Sage warrior’s reaction speed was very fast and after the body skill was activated, he moved forward quickly.

He soon disappeared from everyone’s sight.

“Humph!”

The other Sage warriors snorted coldly when they saw this scene.

But looking at those energy rays, they didn’t seem to be completely sure that they would be able to dodge them all.

Lin Xiu walked over at this time and went forward step by step.

“Courting death.”

Seeing that Lin Xiu was walking forward like those energy rays were nothing, the Sage warriors around couldn’t help but say coldly.

Lin Xiu ignored their words and continued to walk forward.

Whoosh whoosh—

At this time, the surrounding energy rays madly charged towards Lin Xiu!

He is dead meat!

When the surrounding Sage warriors saw this scene, they all thought to themselves.

But at the next moment, their eyes widened and were full of disbelief.

Because those laser rays couldn’t penetrate Lin Xiu’s body at all at this time.

Shooting on Lin Xiu’s body was like a tickle.

And Lin Xiu simply walked slowly to the front.

“It doesn’t seem to be anything.”

Lin Xiu looked back at the Sage warriors and said in a faint voice, but the figure disappeared in the next moment.

“This is impossible!”

One of the Sage warriors let out a low roar and was about to rush over!

“what!!!”

But the moment he rushed over, a large amount of energy rays shot out and hit his body.

He let out a whimper.

His body was instantly pierced with countless holes by those terrifying energy rays.

Lin Xiu continued to walk.

There was a cold breath around.

But Lin Xiu didn’t stop because of this.

After continuing to walk forward for a long distance, he saw the front side and it seems that the end is coming.

When he walked to the end and looked ahead, he could clearly see that there was a huge space in front.

There was a large number of warrior statues around this space.

Those warrior statues were very huge and lifelike and they all looked like gods of war.

And there were many giant pillars around.

There were various strange patterns engraved on the giant pillars.

In the middle, there was a staircase.

Above the stairs, there was a huge stone door.

The stone door was tightly closed.

Taking a closer look, some of the advanced warriors were already going up the stairs.

Is there something just behind that stone gate?

Lin Xiu raised his eyes and looked forward, then thought to himself.

At this time, Lin Xiu took a deep breath and was about to walk forward.

Those warriors seemed to have already started to climb the stairs at this time.

But when they were standing on the stairs, it seemed as if a very strong force suddenly struck.

With the attack of this extremely powerful force, the faces of those warriors suddenly turned pale.

Their bodies started to tremble.

On this seemingly ordinary and steep staircase, there was an extremely strong force!

This terrifying power made it impossible for them to stand firm.

Lin Xiu saw the extremely ugly faces of these warriors and seemed to have guessed something.

After a little hesitation, Lin Xiu still stepped up.

As soon as he stood up, Lin Xiu felt a terrifying force strike. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

It seemed like it was going to hit his body down.

It was similar to the ruins in Wildfire City before.

Lin Xiu looked at the stairs and thought to himself.

But to the current Lin Xiu, this kind of terrifying power is nothing at all.

At this time, Lin Xiu had already continued to walk up.

When the warriors below saw Lin Xiu’s movements, their eyes widened.

They were enduring a very terrifying power, but Lin Xiu, it seemed that nothing happened at all!

how can that be!

Their eyes were wide open at this time and their eyes were full of disbelief.

Lin Xiu ignored these people and continued to walk upstairs.

Every time he took a step, Lin Xiu felt an increasingly powerful force hitting his body.

But this kind of powerful force was very terrifying for most Sage warriors.

But for the current Lin Xiu, this was still nothing.

Step by step, soon, Lin Xiu reached the top.

And the Sage warriors behind, at this time, also rushed over.

“The ruins are mine!”
