Chapter 105: Journey to the Path of Death!

“We don’t have to…”

The two men hesitated when they heard the middle-aged man’s words, then spoke up.

“We don’t have to do it.” The middle-aged man nodded.

“If we let the people at headquarters know that the people in our Black Sea division died while dealing with a young boy, we’re going to lose our dignity!”

After all, killing was their business and it wasn’t worthwhile to go through that.

Offering a reward for others to deal with Lin Xiu was also returning a favor to the Tang family’s lord.

At this moment, Lin Xiu was still sitting cross-legged in the hotel room practicing the ‘Cultivation technique’. He had a feeling that his ‘Cultivation technique’ had broken through to another level!

After some time, he suddenly heard a system prompt.

“Ding~~~”

“Congratulations Master on the successful promotion to a rank 3 warrior! You received the title of a rank 3 warrior!”

“Congratulations Master on receiving a chance on the lottery!”

Two consecutive system prompts came which surprised Lin Xiu.

Rank 3, he was finally rank 3! This should be due to his ‘Cultivation technique’ reaching the level of a rank 3 warrior!

From a beginner warrior to a rank 3 warrior, he took only about two months!

If this had been known to anyone else, the whole world would have been shocked.

After all, it was simply too fast.

He entered his system interface and could clearly see his attributes:

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: Level 16

Experience: 2,139,635 (3,200,000 experience required for the next level)

Strength: 311

Physique: 107

Speed: 79

Skill: ‘Analytic Eye’, ‘Fury’, ‘Disguise’

Rage build-up: 0/100

Potential points: 0

Title: Rank 2 warrior

Overall Combat Strength: 2,560

It improved his combat strength by more than 500 points! This was really unexpected.

To reach the level of a rank 4 warrior, one would need a combat strength of 4,000 points, which was a bit difficult.

There were three important watersheds, rank 1 to 3, rank 4 to 6, and rank 7 to 9.

So between rank 3 and rank 4, it wasn’t simply one level.

With the title of a rank 3 warrior, Lin Xiu quickly clicked on it and saw the note behind the title: Increase Physique attribute by 20

Lin Xiu was elated when he saw this, there was only a 5% increase in strength for a rank 2 warrior which was just a dozen points, so an increase in Physique by 20 points was quite a lot. However, when his strength attribute is high, he could remove the rank 2 warrior title.

Lin Xiu hesitated and decided not to change.

Forget it, he shall just use the title of a rank 2 warrior first.

He had accumulated four lottery chances and after thinking about it, he entered the turntable interface. However, there weren’t ‘?’ on the sections today, they were some ordinary skill cards and weapons that he didn’t need.

He decided to keep them and use them when there were better rewards.

After cultivating for a while, Lin Xiu stretched, then laid in bed and slept soundly.

After some time, Lin Xiu was woken by the ringing of his phone.

Lin Xiu rubbed his sleepy eyes, then subconsciously reached out and answered the phone.

“Hello.”

“Lin Xiu? Where are you now?” There was a familiar voice at the other end of the call.

“Teacher Luo?” Lin Xiu propped himself up as soon as he heard his voice.

The sunlight filtered in through the curtains, shining on Lin Xiu’s body. He looked at the clock on the wall, the time was past seven o’clock. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“En, have you been on the hunting net before? I see that a bounty has been offered for your life!” Luo Li said anxiously.

He happened to hear that a teenager was being posted on the hunting net so he went to take a look and did not expect to see Lin Xiu’s photos.

“The hunting net?” Lin Xiu has now woken up and frowned slightly.

The hunting net was a website dedicated to rewarding killers. Nobody knew who created it and even the Federal government couldn’t find the base of operations of the server. Also, the creator’s network technology was very strong, there was no way of hacking this site.

Almost all of the people posted on the site were heinous, there were some rich and powerful people occasionally, and more. Hence, the federal government has one eye closed.

“Be careful, I think there should be a lot of people finding trouble with you.” Luo Li said seriously.

“En, I got it, I’ll be careful.”

After hanging up, Lin Xiu then walked to the computer and began to search for the hunting net.

It was a gloomy website with many posts of people and a reward below.

Lin Xiu soon found his notice.

The reward amount was 10 million union coins!

Lin Xiu was a little offended – he was only worth 10 million union coins!

But this was no big deal, the task would probably be taken up by low-ranking warriors as high-ranking warriors couldn’t be bothered with such small amounts and would profit so much more by killing a high-ranking evolved beast.

At this moment, Lin Xiu saw that it was almost time and he returned to the room and began to walk toward the station.

The time was almost eight o’clock and after getting his ticket checked, Lin Xiu went straight into the G2 carriage.

As Lin Xiu entered, he paid special attention to the people going to the Path of death, nearly all the carriages were occupied.

There was no doubt that these people were all warriors, there were high-ranking ones, but also ordinary warriors.

The carriage was like a unique little room, with a large screen playing a movie.

Next to it was a bed and chair.

Lin Xiu sat on that bed and began to close his eyes to rest. After all, he must have ample rest before reaching the Path of death, otherwise, it would be trouble if something unexpected happens.

Once it was eight o’clock, the maglev train began moving, it was very fast. Looking out from the window, there wasn’t any scenery, everything went by in a flash.

“Di di di”

Just then, Lin Xiu’s phone vibrated again. He looked at it and a 3D penguin looked as if it was running out of the phone, then it rolled and said with a delicate voice, “You have a new message!”

Lin Xiu saw this penguin and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. Even after all these years, this penguin communication still exists in the future world, but it had a more high-end look.

Lin Xiu tapped on it and a light flashed on his phone, then a person was projected out in front of Lin Xiu.

“Big brother Lin Xiu?”

“Shuang’er?” Looking at the girl that was projected, Lin Xiu was a little surprised.
