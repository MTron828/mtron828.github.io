“En?”

Looking at these people attacking him, Lin Xiu furrowed his brows and retreated to dodge their attacks.

“Kid, first come first served. We attacked this money silver leopard first, you can’t snatch it.”

Murong stood in front and pointed the long sword at Lin Xiu as he spoke with a tone of displeasure.

The rest of the people looked at Lin Xiu.

“I see.” Lin Xiu nodded, then he thought, “But I was the one who stabbed it till its this way.”

Hearing the words of Lin Xiu, their eyes turned to the money silver leopard who was covered in blood and had stabs all over its body.

This money silver leopard didn’t even get hit with all of their attacks, but once Lin Xiu made a move, he caused such a huge damage.

“This is ours!”

Murong’s face turned ugly. At the next moment, he held the long sword in his hand, did not attack Lin Xiu, but the money silver leopard instead!

If he killed this money silver leopard, he would immediately reach the next floor!

“This is mine.” But in this moment, Lin Xiu appeared in front of the money silver leopard, then waved the Dark Edge Spear and collided directly with the long sword.

Bang–

As a dull sound rang, Murong felt that his hand was numb, and he almost let go of the sword.

He even took a few steps back.

The four people also came to their senses and wanted to rush over when they saw Lin Xiu charging towards the money silver leopard’s head!

This money silver leopard was originally seriously injured because of Lin Xiu’s attacks and this time, it couldn’t dodge at all.

At this moment, the spear went through the evolved beast’s head!

With the system prompt ringing in his head, a purple ray of light instantly covered Lin Xiu’s body and he disappeared on the spot.

“Damn it!!!”

Those who wanted to attack Lin Xiu attacked the air in the end!

“Shit!!!”

Murong was furious.

“I will remember you. You’d better not leave the Tower of Trial, otherwise, I will kill you!!!”

This was just a small episode to Lin Xiu. Very soon, he continued to challenge to reach the top.

This Tower of Trail was indeed a little troublesome for ordinary warriors, but for Lin Xiu, this was relatively simple.

After some time, Lin Xiu stepped into the 60th floor and sat down to cultivate. He did not continue.

“I shall stop here today.” Lin Xiu cultivated for a while and found that cultivating in this Tower of Trial was a bit slow. So he stood up and mumbled to himself.

Lin Xiu did not continue to challenge, soon, a beam of light shone on Lin Xiu, and he disappeared.

Lin Xiu was not transferred directly, but appeared in a lobby.

“Eh?” When he saw this scene, he felt a bit strange. He looked ahead and saw that there was a huge screen with his information on it.

En?

Lin Xiu looked at it and was stunned.

However, at the next moment, this screen started to show the number of floors that Lin Xiu got through.

From the first floor and the item he received after getting through the level – everything was refreshing.

It turns out that after the challenge, he would receive a reward for every floor he conquered.

“Ding!”

“The calculation is completed.”

Soon, as a crisp sound rang, Lin Xiu saw that on the side, a robot was holding a silver box to Lin Xiu.

“Your reward.” The robot said to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded, then took this box directly.

This box had a bit of weight and they were the rewards shown.

“I shall go and take a break first, then continue the challenge later.” Lin Xiu took this box and went straight out.

After fighting all day, Lin Xiu was actually a bit tired.

Especially since the difficulty increases as the floors get higher.

Even for Lin Xiu, it was not so easy to win.

As Lin Xiu left the Tower, he saw a number of warriors standing around.

Although it was already nighttime, there were still lights around, so it was very bright.

The faces of these warriors were different from when they had just come. Lin Xiu ignored these people and found a spot, then sat cross-legged.

He opened the silver box in his hand.

There were a lot of odd crystals, skills cards, and some Tower of Trial challenge cards.

There were 11 challenge cards, which meant that Lin Xiu could continue to challenge 11 times even if he failed.

The skills card was just some ordinary skills. Although there were one or two diamond skill cards, but they didn’t catch Lin Xiu’s attention. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Because he already had several diamond skill cards.

“You guys can have them.”

Lin Xiu looked at those odd crystals – all of them were about rank 6 or 7 and Lin Xiu didn’t care for these low-ranking crystals anymore.

Rollie and Xiao Bao ran out from Lin Xiu’s pocket immediately and began gnawing on the odd crystals.

They were very quiet in Lin Xiu’s pocket every day like they were asleep.

At this time, when they saw some odd crystals, they began eating them like they were starving.

“Hello there.”

At this time, several men walked over.

Looking at those people, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed, then he faintly said, “What’s the matter?”

“My name is Chen Haoran, I’m a 3rd year student and I want to make a deal with you. Wonder if you’re interested?” The man who claimed to be Chen Haoran maintained a safe distance from Lin Xiu respectfully and smiled.

“Oh? What deal?”

Lin Xiu was a bit interested at this time – this is still the first time someone talked to him about a deal.

“You probably got a challenge card?”

Chen Haoran continued to say.

“Well, yes.”
