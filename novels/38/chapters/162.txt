Chapter 163: I Won

Lin Xiu was originally enclosed by ice when many cracks suddenly appeared on the ice. At this moment, with a huge sound, it suddenly exploded!

What happened!? 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Yu Yi’s gaze changed, and he saw Lin Xiu, who had broken out of the ice, charging toward him with a black spear!

Dang––

Yu Yi’s reaction speed was also very fast, the weapon in his hand was about to block Lin Xiu’s attack.

Lin Xiu’s attack was too fast and the power it generated was shocking, the weapon in his hand was directly knocked out.

Swish swish swish——

The spear was vigorous and it kept aiming for his body!

Although Yu Yi dodged frantically at this moment, he accidentally got stabbed a few times, and his white clothes were stained with blood.

“Damn!!!” The intense pain from his body made Yu Yi’s face become ferocious at this moment.

And he was already a little dazed by this situation – how could a rank 3 warrior break free of his attack just now in such a short time?

While he was thinking, his body had already jumped to the other side, and he picked up his long sword directly.

‘Awe of the phoenix’!!!” At this moment, Lin Xiu yelled abruptly.

A large amount of flames burst forth at this time, turning into flaming birds and flying towards Yu Yi, encircling him!!!

“Do you think you can hit me!!!” Yu Yi roared at this time, then dodged and avoided the attack.

Although Lin Xiu’s power had somehow increased drastically, it was not a problem for a rank 5 warrior like himself to avoid these flaming birds!

Boom boom——

As the flaming birds charged towards him, he kept retreating and avoiding.

While avoiding, he also saw Lin Xiu rushing over!

The tip of the Dark Edge spear was about to pierce his body.

The pupils in his eyes constricted slightly at this moment as he watched the flaming birds rushing from both sides and Lin Xiu attacking from the opposite side, his body instinctively dodged backward.

“I won.” Lin Xiu, who was charging over, stopped at this moment, then looked down at Yu Yi and said aloud.

“You won…” Yu Yi was about to laugh. He completely avoided his attacks. How could he lose?

But his smile froze in the next moment.

Because he discovered that while he was avoiding the Flaming Bird and Lin Xiu’s attacks, he was forced to retreat and accidentally left the arena.

He glared at Lin Xiu who was looking at him condescendingly.

“ID9814126, Lin Xiu, victory!”

“Damn it!” At this moment, those who saw this scene outside were so surprised that their eyes widened.

‘This is too… too incredible, right?’

The man with the goggles was already a little skeptical of life at this moment.

Rank 3 warrior… against the top of rank 5 warrior, and he actually won?

Although this victory was a bit of a fluke, he still won!

“Damn, this guy actually used tricks!?” The man standing next to Zhuo Qixing also had his eyes widened and said irritably.

Even if Lin Xiu reaches the 21st floor, he will become first on the freshmen list. That is 1,000 points a day!

Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but feel envy, jealousy, and hatred.

“Interesting, interesting, it seems that I have to pay attention to this person.” Zhuo Qixing couldn’t help laughing.

I believe that he will be a good ‘whetstone’.

Yu Yi looked at Lin Xiu with gloomy eyes, his eyes were filled with grievances.

‘I lost, this was originally a definite win, but I actually lost!!!’

“Boy, you have won me with your tricks, and you will regret it later.” Yu Yi said, staring at Lin Xiu in the arena at this time.

From the beginning, he used those Flaming birds to trick him.

Lin Xiu made the Flaming birds attack from all directions while he attacked from the front, just to make Yu Yi retreat to the back.

And while he panicked, he did not notice that he was already on the edge of the arena.

Damn it!

“You are welcome to find me any time,” Lin Xiu said indifferently.

Lin Xiu’s expression didn’t seem to have changed much, but his body still felt cold.

His gold skill was indeed very strong. If he hadn’t reacted in time and activated the ‘Fury’ skill, which increased the strength of his body, he might have lost.

“You can choose to continue to fight or wait for others to challenge you on the 21st floor.” At this moment, a young woman said to Lin Xiu.

She looked at Lin Xiu; he appeared quite young and didn’t look particularly strong.

Yet he managed to defeat Yu Yi, an old dough stick that had been on the 20th floor for so long.

“Remain on the 21st floor.” Lin Xiu said directly without hesitation at this time.

He couldn’t continue fighting now, otherwise, his body wouldn’t be able to take it anymore.

And he would suffer from the aftereffects of ‘Fury’ in the next few minutes.

Lin Xiu took the elevator back to the bottom of the tower.

At night, there were still a lot of bright lights around and the ranking of the freshmen list has now been replaced.

It was his name in first place!

As long as he maintained this ranking until morning, 1,000 points would be automatically entered into his information card!

If he remained there for a month, it would be 30,000!

As Lin Xiu stepped out, the students below all looked towards Lin Xiu.

Most of them were filled with curiosity. The strength of this freshman was too abnormal, right?

Lin Xiu ignored the gaze of these people. Due to the aftereffects of ‘Fury’, Lin Xiu felt as if he had no strength at all at this moment.

The Dark Edge Spear on his back also felt very heavy.

‘Can’t do it… can’t walk anymore.’

Not long after walking on the road, Lin Xiu sat directly on the ground, panting.

The aftereffects caused Lin Xiu to completely lose his strength in this short period of time.

“Oh? It looks like you have no strength.” At this moment, a voice came from the other side and several figures appeared in front of Lin Xiu.
