Chapter 698 The Terrifying Domain Abilities!

But Wu Chengkong wasn’t about to give up. With a sharp look in his eyes and screamed, “Destroy him!”

With the loud scream, the signs on his sword suddenly lit up brightly.

It was already a huge sword and now, it was as if it had become even bigger. The huge sword was then swung against Lin Xiu’s tiger that was formed by his source energy!

Koong Loong – – Lin Xiu, who was holding onto his spear with both arms, suddenly felt the terrifying energy from the other side and his palm started feeling numb as well.

However, Lin Xiu did not dodge his attack. Instead, he decided to continue attacking.

Wu Changkong had a sharp look in his eyes. He swiftly moved the sword in his arm and there was a terrifying aura coming from his sword. There were large cracks all over the ground.

As they continued fighting, Lin Xiu could feel the blood in his body getting heated up.

His strength was not getting any weaker; in fact, he was feeling stronger!

The white ball of energy in his body was starting to get active.

It was activating the energy in Lin Xiu’s body, allowing him to get stronger.

Damn it!

Wu Changkong widened his eyes. He could clearly feel that something wasn’t right as he fought Lin Xiu.

His energy was getting weaker but Lin Xiu’s was the opposite. Not only was it not reducing, it felt stronger than they had first started.

“Red Moon Field!”

At that moment, Wu Chengkong roared. With him being the centre, there was a bright red glow that appeared and the source field soon covered the entire stage!

What was this?!

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but was shocked by what he saw.

Just when Lin Xiu wanted to continue his attack with the spear, he felt that there was someone who was attacking from behind him.

His eyes narrowed. Lin Xiu had planned on attacking Wu Changkong, who was right in front of him but he subconsciously activated his skills – ‘Disappearing without a trace’ in order to dodge the attack.

As he moved aside to dodge the attack, he quickly turned around and noticed that there was another figure that looked exactly like Wu Changkong! This figure was completely covered in red and he was the splitting image of Wu Changkong.

As he took a closer look, there were multiple red coloured energy figures that appeared all over the stage. All of them looked exactly like Wu Changkong.

There were four of them in total. With the help of his ‘Analytical Eye’, he noticed that these figures had two thirds of Wu Changkong’s strength!

Was this the power of his source field?!

“Earthlings, it’s an honour that you get to witness this.”

Wu Changkong had his eyes on Lin Xiu and he was ready to kill.

This was because he felt threatened by the power that Lin Xiu had shown earlier. Wu Changkong no longer wanted to waste his time, he wanted to end Lin Xiu as quickly as possible.

“Heh.”

Lin Xiu gave a cold laugh but did not say anything else. With the spear in his hands, he started moving them once again.

ON

With that, the flaming birds were released from the spear!

All of them headed directly onto Wu Changkong’s energy figures that were found all over the stage.

However, these flaming birds seemed to have no effect on these figures!

What was going on?!

Just when Lin Xiu was still confused, the four figures that looked exactly like Wu Changkong suddenly moved.

They were moving quickly and each of them held a huge sword, attacking Lin Xiu at all angles!

Although these were just energy figures, Lin Xiu still felt threatened.

He decided to move and dodge the figures.

Koong Loong – – On the ground where Lin Xiu was standing a second ago, there was a huge hold formed as all four of them attacked together.

After moving to the other side of the stage, Lin Xiu took a closer look at their attacks and he narrowed his eyes subconsciously.

They may only have 2/3rds of the strength of the actual person but they were still extremely strong

Plus, he couldn’t attack these figures but they could attack him in return.

This was a terrifying problem!

“His source field is quite powerful!”

When Lei Chong saw what was happening, his eyes widened in shock. He was also getting worried about the rest of Lin Xiu’s battle.

“This is also my first time seeing Wu Changkong using such strength.”

Chen Lan had a solemn look on his face as well.

Since he was in Tianlong Cheng, he would watch every single warrior competition and had watched a few of Wu Changkong’s matches.

But, there has not been anyone who could force such strength from Wu Changkong.

“Is this the strength of Wu Chengkong’s source field?”

Qian Jin, who was on the other side of the stage, looked surprised as well.

However, he wasn’t feeling frightened. He wanted to fight!

He wanted to battle Wu Changkong as well. If it wasn’t because he wanted to play safe so that he could get to Fengyun City, he would have chosen the first stage …

46

…

Since no one would be happy with always being

second.

At the same time, Wu Changkong who was on stage, noticed that Lin Xiu had dodged the attacks earlier. He quickly lifted his sword and planned for another round of attack!

Then, all four of his figures started dashing towards Lin Xiu as well; all at the same time!

Lin Xiu had no other choice but to release his ‘Yuan’.

Boom boom boom – –

The four figures were the ones that reached Lin Ciu first and had started attacking Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu groaned a little when his ‘Yuan’ was being attacked by the large sword.

Fortunately, the ‘Yuan’ was able to block the attacks of these figures or else, it would have caused even more trouble.

Just when Lin Xiu was blocking the attacks from the figures, Wu Changkong leaped into the air with his sword and aimed it towards Lin Xiu’s head from above!

His leap was extremely powerful as if he had frozen the air around him and the terrifying sword aura caused a storm.

Some of the weaker warriors, who sat close to the stage, were thrown away by it!

Lin Xiu, who was protected by his ‘Yuan’, looked up and as he saw what was headed towards him, his eyes widened in shock. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

With all four of Wu Changkong’s figure attacking him, it was already quite a burden for his ‘Yuan’. If he were to take another attack from Wu Changkong himself, it would immediately break Lin Xiu!

Within a split second, Lin Xiu grabbed onto his spear and there was a bright white glow that appeared all around Lin Xiu.

“What’s…..what’s happening?!”

The light was so bright that some of the audience had to cover their eyes with both their hands.
