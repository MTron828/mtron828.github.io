Chapter 182: Space Cracks

Three rank 5 Odd Crystals.

“I got it from those people,” Luo Yue said.

“En, I also got two rank 5 Odd Crystals.” Lin Xiu nodded. Adding the other three Odd crystals, his team already got eight rank 5 Odd crystals and this was only the first day!

Seems like the chances of winning first place were still quite high.

“Lin Xiu!” Seeing Lin Xiu and Luo Yue coming back, Zhang Yin and the others waved in surprise.

Lin Xiu nodded. When he looked at them, he found that there were five other strangers with Zhang Yin and the rest.

“Class 10 of the North campus?” Lin Xiu saw the emblem on them and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

‘What a coincidence, they were all in Class 10.’

And looking at their dusty and dirty faces, they probably encountered a lot of danger here this morning.

“Hello.” Those people smiled nervously as they looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

They had seen Lin Xiu and Luo Yue’s names on the freshmen list on the Tower of Tournament which had their photos next to their names.

Seeing that these two people were in Class 10, their eyes were filled with shock.

Lin Xiu nodded and after he greeted them, he looked at Zhang Yin and the others and said. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“The people above have been eliminated by us and we even obtained a few rank 5 Odd crystals.”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Zhang Yin and the others laughed, “These guys actually gave us Odd crystals for free.”

“Let’s continue ahead.” Lin Xiu thought for a while and said.

The strength of these people was also around rank 3.

The deeper they went into the G17 Ruins, the more dangerous it would become. If these people tagged along with them, they would definitely drag them down.

“Wait.” Just as Lin Xiu said that, a tall guy among the group of people from Class 10 of the North Campus stood up.

“What’s the matter?”

“I think we can make a deal.” The tall and sturdy man from Class 10 of the North Campus looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“What deal?” Lin Xiu raised his brows.

“We can use a piece of information to exchange for Odd crystals with you.” The sturdy man said.

He sounded very confident like Lin Xiu would definitely agree to this deal.

“What information do you have?” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

“Space cracks, I know there is a space crack somewhere.” The sturdy man said in a deep voice.

Hearing the words ‘space cracks’, the gaze of Lin Xiu and the others changed.

In recent years, space shocks have occasionally occurred in various places on the earth, resulting in some space cracks. Some creatures or treasures from other worlds all came out of these space cracks.

But this kind of space crack would disappear after a period of time. It was very magical and so far, no one knew how it happens.

But what was certain was that there would definitely something from another world around these space cracks.

Treasures and the like were also highly possible.

“How do you prove that your words are credible?” Lin Xiu said lightly.

If his information was accurate, then it was really worth taking a look at.

“Information card – we can leave our information cards with you guys and you can give them back to us after you guys return.” The sturdy man continued to say.

Lin Xiu shook his head, “This card is of no use to me.”

“We just don’t want to return being in the last place. As long as you give us three rank 5 Odd crystals, I will tell you the location of this space crack.” The sturdy man said.

It was very likely that there were horrifying creatures from other dimensions in these space cracks and this was a matter of both danger and opportunity.

But this place was simply too dangerous. They were merely at the borders and were almost unable to go further.

“Sure.” Lin Xiu pondered for a moment, then directly took out three rank 5 Odd crystals from his backpack and tossed the crystals to them.

“You trust me?” At this moment, the sturdy man was stunned.

He never expected Lin Xiu to be so straightforward.

“We’re in the same academy anyway. If you lie to me, wouldn’t it be easy for me to find you?” Lin Xiu smiled.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the people in Class 10 of the North Campus smiled bitterly. What Lin Xiu said was indeed the truth.

After receiving Lin Xiu’s Odd crystals, the man took out his phone and sent a map to Lin Xiu’s phone.

“Follow according to the map above and that is the space crack. Rest assured, although the strength of Class 10 of the North Campus is not as good as yours, we will never lie.”

Lin Xiu nodded.

After separating from these people, Zhang Yin hesitated for a moment, then said to Lin Xiu, “Lin Xiu, do you think this is real…?”

Just as Zhang Yin’s words were being uttered, Jiang Li and Li Ping’s eyes looked towards Lin Xiu.

“You could tell if someone is lying through their expression and the look in their eyes, There is no doubt that what they are saying is true.” Luo Yue, who was standing next to Lin Xiu, said faintly.

“Indeed, I don’t think they’re lying, let’s go there and take a look.” Lin Xiu held the long spear in his right hand and the Dark Edge spear in his left hand, then proceeded to the area marked on the map.

This so-called space crack appeared to be somewhere in the center of this city.

As Lin Xiu and the others continued to walk forward, there were more and more moss-like things on the surrounding ground and it was a little wet.

There were many weird vines entwined on the surface of those buildings.

“Be careful, I think it’s a bit weird.” Lin Xiu frowned, his eyes constantly scanning around.

‘Quiet, it’s too quiet here.’

Squeak squeak squeak——

They just stepped into the dilapidated street in front when a weird sound rang out, causing the tensed-up Li Ping to exclaim.

“It’s just a mouse.” Zhang Yin heaved a sigh of relief when he saw the dark creatures clearly.

These mice were a bit big like the size of rabbits and their mouths were full of jagged teeth, which looked very disgusting.

“So many… so many skeletons…” The few people continued to move forward and at the next corner, Jiang Li’s eyes widened as he looked at the scene ahead, trembling.

On the street in front, there were bones everywhere. It seemed like some belonged to humans and some were evolved beasts.

And on the bones, there seemed to be quite a few rats standing.

“Be careful, don’t attack them!”
