Chapter 201: Rank 8 Evolved Beast – Ice Crystal White Bird

Lin Xiu leaped onto a flat roof nearby and looked ahead. The expression on his face turned to shock.

The evolved beast was extremely large, it had a pure white body that resembled ice crystals.

It was a bird, a gigantic bird!

And the mist seemed to be formed from the ice crystals released from its body while it was in slumber.

Analytic Eye was unable to analyze it.

“It’s getting cold.” As the giant evolved beast flapped its wings, the cold winds that surged forth made Lin Xiu cold.

At the same time, the evolved beast flew into the sky, opened its mouth and expelled a cold smoke.

This was an extremely terrifying scene.

The location that was struck by the cold smoke froze instantly. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Everything seemed to have been sealed in ice.

The exterior of the buildings had layers of ice all over them.

‘That’s… too insane, right?’

“Rank 8 evolved beast, Ice Crystal White Bird.” Luo Yue stood beside Lin Xiu and looked at the evolved beast and spoke indifferently.

Her eyes were filled with shock.

How could such a powerful evolved beast be here!?

The evolved beast was clearly in deep slumber but someone might have headed to its location to break through and aggravated it.

At this moment, it was flying in the air and attacking the surroundings.

“The mist… is gone!” At the same time, Zhang Yin and the others realized that the dense mist had disappeared and were extremely happy when they felt the ground shake. When they looked in the direction, they saw the gigantic evolved beast flapping its wings.

Although they were a great distance away, they were able to see the gigantic Ice Crystal White Bird’s body.

By the looks of it, it would be about the size of a mountain?

It was too terrifying.

“So cold.” Jiang Li hugged his own body and sneezed.

“What do we do now?” Li Ping looked at Zhang Yin.

Just by standing at their positions, they were able to sense the powerful pressure emitting from the evolved beast. It was fanatically spewing terrifying cold air around it as though it was infuriated.

“Let’s look for Lin Xiu and the others!” Zhang Yin decided and said.

Rumble rumble-

At the same time, everyone in G17 had a change in expression as they witnessed the change.

Many evolved beasts were running away frantically.

“Young Master Zhuo, what rank is that evolved beast?” Luo Xiaoqi stood beside Zhuo Qixing and asked when he saw the shocking scene.

‘That’s too terrifying, all of the evolved beasts there have turned into ice sculptures of an ice world.’

If they had rushed over, they would most probably be frozen as well!

“Rank 8 Evolved Beast – Ice Crystal White Bird.” Zhuo Qixing replied as he watched the majestic bird.

“Rank 8?!!” The other three warriors all had a change in expressions.

What did rank 8 signify? It was equivalent to a rank 7 warrior. A rank 7 warrior could kill them as easily as squashing an ant!

“Don’t worry, there will be people who will come to take care of it in a while.” Zhuo Qixing looked at the Ice Crystal white bird and smirked.

He took out his phone and started recording.

‘As long as someone comes to kill the evolved beast, I can be the fisherman to snag everything up.’

“All of you can go and die!” On the other hand, Cheng Fan watched his efforts play out with a sinister look in his eyes.

The Ice crystal white bird had been in deep slumber due to its physique. It released a unique gas that would react with the surrounding air and produce such an effect.

They had long discovered the ice crystal white bird but they had focused on hunting other evolved beasts and killing and seizing treasures from other warriors, so they never woke the evolved beast.

‘As long as this evolved beast awakens, it will induce a terrifying beast tide and zombie tide, see how they survive this!’

“Goodbye!” Cheng Fan sat on a small plane and flew off.

It was an automatic plane, so he was able to escape safely with one arm.

Lin Xiu was a student of Sacred Region Academy and very few people used spears. Adding that Lin Xiu’s spear was pitch black that was rare to be found, he believed that finding Lin Xiu would be easy.

Upon thinking about this, his expression became sinister.

He had to take revenge for his missing arm!

Roar-

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue stood on the roof and were able to see the streets below. There was an endless wave of evolved beasts charging in their direction!

All sorts of evolved beasts as well as zombies seemed to have sensed danger and rushed over.

Wa-

A shriek came out. Lin Xiu turned to see a zombie with a rotten body and a white maggot on its face rushing towards him while opening its bloodied mouth!

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted, he did not expect a zombie to crawl up and attack him.

But Lin Xiu did not hesitate to use his spear to explode the zombie’s head.

But it was not over. Once Lin Xiu killed the zombie, more evolved beasts and zombies rushed towards them.

‘It’s a disaster!’

Lin Xiu used his spear to attack without hesitation.

Luo Yue engaged them as well.

Lin Xiu’s eyes swept across the streets while killing the evolved beasts and zombies and saw an endless wave of them approaching.

‘Damn it! Why are there so many?!’

‘This can’t go on, even if we continue fighting, we can’t kill all of them. Luo Yue and I will die from exhaustion!’

Countless experience notifications sounded out in his head as Lin Xiu massacred the creatures and zombies, but Lin Xiu did not pay attention to it at all.

He looked at the building ahead. ‘We can cross over and head to a higher roof and move higher and higher. The evolved beasts and zombies should not be able to climb so easily.’

“Luo Yue! This way!”
