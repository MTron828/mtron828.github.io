Chapter 766: Bloodthirsty Beetle

“You don’t know about them?”

“They are similar to a global committee.”

Qian Ling quickly explained.

“It’s not that.” Lin Xiu shook his head as he chuckled.

He just suddenly thought of the warrior union that he knew back on earth.

It has already been quite some time since he has landed on the Marqi Planet and Lin Xiu was now slowly missing earth.

Then, he turned around towards the crowd and noticed that Qian Qiurong was still speaking.

Most of it was just for the warriors to work together in order to kill the raging flame lion.

“If we kill the raging flame lion, how would we divide the loot?”

When one of the warriors heard Qian Qiurong’s request, he quickly stood up and asked.

The rest of the warriors nodded their heads in agreement as well. They were all looking at Qian Qiurong while waiting for an answer.

“The treasure that is found in the raging flame lion’s den as well as all the items received would be shared equally.”

Qian Qiurong smiled before explaining himself. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“As for the odd crystals, we will purchase from all of you, if you’d like; in exchange for gold coins.”

After hearing the answer, most of them were moved.

There were still a few who were still being cautious.

However, none of these mattered because the most important thing now was that no one in the crowd had any objections.

“Alright. Since there are no other questions, let’s work together for now.”

“From what I know, there are quite a few clans here. Let’s join forces and head to our destination first.”

Qian Qiurong jumped off the huge canyon rock that he was standing on and walked in front as he led the crowd.

The rest of the warriors did hesitate for a short moment before following him into the canyon.

Wan Qianshan galared at Lin Xiu, who was right behind him, with his eyes filled with a murderous intention.

You shall be allowed to be arrogant for now but once I get the chance, you will be dead!

Lin Xiu could also feel a peculiar murderous feeling coming from the other side and he couldn’t help but narrowed his eyes as well.

He wants to kill me?

“Brother Lin, what should we do now?”

Liu Pan looked at Lin Xiu as he asked.

An Qi and Qian Ling were also waiting for an answer from Lin Xiu.

After these past few days, both of them have already subconsciously taken Lin Xiu as the group’s leader.

“We shall follow the rest of them.”

Lin Xiu gave a small smile.

“But, both of you should be careful.”

“En.”

An Qi and Qian Ling nodded their heads and Liu Pan was rather looking very excited.

Lin Xiu and his group followed behind the group that was now huge as they walked into the canyon.

“It’s hot and it’s cold, such a weird place.”

After walking for some time, Liu Pan couldn’t help but shivered.

As they looked to both sides, they could clearly see that in the distance, there were two peculiar looking mountain peaks.

One of them was covered with snow while the other had white smoke coming out of the centre of it. There were no signs of living things on that mountain.

Such a peculiar looking phenomenon.

Koong Loong – –

At the same time, the entire ground started shaking.

But, it wasn’t a rigorous one.

“Why is it shaking again?”

Qian Ling and An Qi asked as well out of curiosity.

Just as they finished their sentences, they noticed that there was a huge, black figure that was right in front of them and it was headed towards them!

“What is that?!”

The warriors who were in front stared at the scene with their eyes opened wide.

“Bloodthirsty Beetle!! Be careful!!”

One of the warriors immediately realised what it was and screamed out loud to warn the rest.

As he screamed, the huge, dense-looking black figure was actually made of multiple huge beetles!

Koong loong – –

The warriors, who faced the warriors straight on, started attacking the creatures with their weapons.

There were all sorts of warrior skills that were being released and was followed by multiple loud explosions.

There were some of them who were unfortunate and were pierced by the beetle.

The bodies of those who were pierced suddenly looked as if their blood had been sucked dry.

“What on earth are these?!”

Liu Pan grabbed onto his double-bladed axe as his body trembled.

These things are so disgustingly scary!

“Hmph!”

As for Qian Qiurong, who was leading the crowd, held onto his sword and released a terrifying sword aura.

The sword aura was so strong that there was a large drain that appeared in the centre of the ground.

As for the rest of the beetles that were on the ground, they were all chopped into halves by the sword aura!

Within a blink of an eye, there were about twenty of those terrifying beetles that were killed.

Due to Qian Qiurong’s attack, the rest of the warriors felt less afraid and started swinging their weapons in the air, releasing powerful and strong warrior skills to kill the beetles!

“These bloodthirsty beetle….how did they become so big?!”

An Qi and Qian Ling were both surprised.

Not only did they look huge, their strength seemed to have been much stronger as well.

“Have you seen these before?”

Lin Xiu asked out of curiosity.

After checking with his analytical eye, Lin Xiu knew that these bloodthirsty beetles were rank 9 evolved beasts.

Plus, there was a ‘mutant’ word written at the end of its name.

No matter if it was their strength or speed, these beetles were strong.

Even for a rank 9 warrior – if they weren’t being careful, they might get attacked.

“En. These bloodthirsty beetles are found only in this region.”

“But….according to what we know, we have never seen such huge ones…..”

An Qi nodded his head and took out her phone that looked like a card. She was reading up on its information before informing the crowd.

From the information given, it was about these bloodthirst beetles.

“Bloodthirsty Beetles, rank 8 evolved beast...”

Liu Pan turned towards them as well. He read it out loud as he was looking at the projection that was given from the phone.

Rank 8?!

When Lin Xiu read about it, he frowned.

But, with his analytical eyes, these creatures were definitely rank 9 evolved beasts.

From the looks of it, perhaps there was something that could have changed these evolved beasts, causing a mutation?

“Be careful!”

As when Lin Xiu was thinking about it to himself, he heard Qian Ling’s cry.

Lin Xiu turned around quickly and noticed that there was a huge bloodthirsty beetle that came out of nowhere, headed towards Lin Xiu.

His pupil shrank and he immediately released hia ‘Yuan’.

A dark red ‘Yuan’ appeared and it managed to stop the huge bloodthirsty beetle.

Boom – –

As it hit Lin Xiu’ Yuan’, it let out a loud explosion.

“Damn it!”

Liu Pan’s reaction was the fastest and has already started chopping the beetles with his double bladed axe!
