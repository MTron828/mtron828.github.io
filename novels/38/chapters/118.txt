Chapter 119: Ferocious Attack In The Rain

Lin Xiu was already immersed in the technique.

The marvel of the technique laid in its ability to transform the body to be as graceful as a swallow.

But it had its shortcomings too, the technique’s ability to dodge was not strong. It was only fast and it required the user’s own reactive ability to avoid and dodge.

But it was extremely good to him, Lin Xiu’s reactive ability was already extremely fast. Matched with this skill, he would truly be extremely slippery.

After staying excited for a while, the fresh sensation disappeared.

He took out another gold card.

This was the card he obtained through the Synthesis System, Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall.

It was considered a large-scale skill that consumed a great amount of source strength and stamina.

After absorbing all the information from the card into his mind, it was as though the skill had imprinted itself into his brain.

But he could not use it at the present, otherwise, he would fall into danger from the over exhaustion of the body.

Lin Xiu looked at the whitefish corpse and dug out the odd crystal. He then set up a fire and started barbecuing.

After investigating on his phone, he found information that the giant turtle whitefish was considered a delicacy.

The reason for this was that it thrived in waters with extremely high salt concentration. At this time, he did not even need to add seasoning and the flesh was already extremely sweet.

And the flesh in the pincers was even better than lobsters.

Thunders and lightning continued to roam in the clouds.

After the meal, Lin Xiu patted on his own tummy, kept everything, and prepared to move on.

Pitter-patter

Bean-sized raindrops started to fall. Lin Xiu frowned, he knew it was about to get big.

This is a really weird place.

But his battle robes were extremely water-resistant and were far better than raincoats. Although he had just gone underwater, the water on his body and clothes had all dripped dry.

Rumble-

Right at this moment, a loud thunder boomed and rain started to pour down heavily.

Lin Xiu continued onwards, his vision of his surroundings had narrowed due to the weather.

“In such weather, rain flies will definitely appear!” Lin Xiu muttered to himself, then casually took out Dark Edge. He thrust right at the tree next to him and saw a completely blue fly creature that was the size of a palm.

“Ding! Congratulations Master, obtaining 10000 experience from killing rank 2 rain fly.”

Hmmm…10000 experience points is not too bad.

But the blue rain fly looked rather disgusting. It was said that these flies were reproduced from dead warrior corpses or animal carcasses. After rotting for a long time, maggots would form on the rotting flesh and due to the unique surroundings, the maggots would slowly turn into flies.

And they loved rain the most.

Lin Xiu walked while wielding the spear that would occasionally shoot forward and kill the blue rain flies.

There is a distance of about 50 kilometers ahead of Black Salt Lake and I have covered less than 10 kilometers of it.

Due to the pouring rain, Lin Xiu’s vision was heavily obstructed. He had heightened his mental state because it was such times where danger was the most prevalent.

And upon recalling the T-rex leeches that might appear from the soil, he immediately felt disgusted.

He continued ahead for a period of time and suddenly heard a scream.

“Save me…” A female voice could be heard in the distance. Lin Xiu caught a glimpse of a figure walking past under the rain.

Lin Xiu frowned as the lady staggered and fell to the ground.

She was covered in the blackish-blue soil as she attempted to crawl back up, but she looked to be too weak to do so.

“Save me…” Right then, she raised her head and extended her right hand towards Lin Xiu.

As though she wanted Lin Xiu to support her up. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“There… there is a high rank evolved beast there…” The girl said with a look of panic on her face.

She had a beautiful face and a tear on her clothes at the chest area revealed a white and deep ravine. She was extremely attractive.

Lin Xiu nodded his head. Right when he extended his hand out to pull her up, the look in his eyes changed as he formed a fist and gave her a punch!

The girl that looked extremely weak originally had a change in expression. She moved her body and avoided Lin Xiu’s punch and retreated with smooth agility.

“How did you know.” The lady had drawn out two short daggers from who knows where and glared at Lin Xiu.

She was sure that her act was flawless and ordinary men would be swayed and would never refuse to help a lady in distress.

But why, why did Lin Xiu attack her?!

“You can change your eyes, appearance, expressions, but you can’t conceal the killing intent on your body, although I know you tried.” Lin Xiu replied indifferently.

He held Dark Edge and maintained his stance under the rain as raindrops splattered on his face.

“Hmph! Kill him!” The lady snorted and a few figures shot out from all directions.

They pounced straight at Lin Xiu!

Although he was unable to identify their appearances, he was able to see their movements.

“The difficulty on the hunting net was C+, seems like this is an extremely easy mission.” The girl sneered.

All the warriors in Path of Death would frequently look for missions on the web. They had coincidentally stumbled upon a reward for a bounty on the hunting net and saw that the boy was actually here.

10 million union coins, this was an astronomical figure for them.

Lin Xiu stood in his original spot and waited. When a guy from his back attacked, he swept his right leg back and shot the spear forward!

In a second, 20 stabs appeared in front of the guy!

Clang clang clang-

The man struggled to block the attacks with his weapon, but even his weapon was penetrated through by Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge!!!

His body was covered in holes in a short period of time.

Blood splattered on the floor.

Lin Xiu remained calm and turned his gaze to the others that had launched a simultaneous attack on him.

They wanted to make use of their numbers!

Lin Xiu frowned and drew a circular arc with Dark Edge.

Clang clang clang-

His powerful strength forced all the men to be flung away.

Under the rain, one man, one spear, seemed to wield power that could look down on the whole world with disdain.
