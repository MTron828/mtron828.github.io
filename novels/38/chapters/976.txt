Chapter 977: Ten Years

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

He was a tall man.

The man was dressed in a very unique looking combat suit.

He had a machete in his hands and it was giving out a dim blue light.

He looked like a powerful warrior.

With the Analytical Eyes, Lin Xiu easily found out that this man was at the peak of a respected warrior.

He was only one step away from being a sage warrior.

“Before I came here, you were able to hide in order to ambush me.”

“So…..this means that you have stayed in this space for a long time?”

Lin Xiu did not answer him. Instead, he looked back at the man and asked calmly.

The look on the warrior’s face changed after hearing what Lin Xiu was saying.

Lin Xiu was right. He was from the previous batch.

With some help, he was able to stay here longer than the others.

He did this because he wanted to find a way of becoming a sage warrior.

However, he didn’t expect that after such a long time, he still remained at the same progress!

“As long as I kill you, your source ring will be mine…”

Then, his eyes were looking at Lin Xiu’s source ring in greed.

“Hmm? This source ring would get you out of here?”

Lin Xiu asked the man as he took a look at his source ring.

“Shut up!!!!!”

The man turned furious as Lin Xiu guessed everything that was going on in his head.

He roared in rage and the next moment, he dashed towards Lin Xiu and started attacking him!

Xiu – –

The way that he moved was odd and even his steps were awkward before he got close to Lin Xiu.

He tightened his grip around the machete and swung it towards Lin Xiu!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

As he moved his machete, there were continuous sounds of explosion.

Although every swing of his were powerful and strong, none of them were able to hit Lin Xiu!

Plus, the most shocking thing was when he realised that Lin Xiu was not moving at all. He was also slight tilting his body to dodge the attacks!

Micro-dodges!

The man was extremely shocked.

He never thought that Lin Xiu would have learnt such moves.

This move would require great reflexes and body physique in order for it to succeed.

If he made any slight mistake, he would be killed instantly.

But, no matter how hard the man tried to kill Lin Xiu, his machete did not touch him at all.

It was horrifying! Terribly horrifying!

Boom – –

He was trying to activate the source energy from his sourcemark and that’s when Lin Xiu grabbed onto his machete.

“You can stop now.”

Lin Xiu said to the warrior bluntly after grabbing his machete.

The man’s pupil shrank when he saw Lin Xiu was able to hold his machete with only one hand.

But then he realised that he couldn’t pull out his weapon from Lin Xiu’s grip!

“You…”

He wanted to warn Lin Xiu but that’s when he heard a crackling sound coming from his weapon.

The man looked at his machete and for him, his weapon was indestructible but now, there were cracks on his weapon!

Crack – –

With a blink of an eye, the entire machete broke into pieces.

The warrior was dumbfounded.

“If I wanted to kill you, you would be dead by now.”

Lin Xiu gathered his energy together and showed it to the man.

It was a tough, overpowering source energy and the man could clearly feel it as he was standing close to Lin Xiu.

It was indeed terrifying.

The man suddenly felt helpless and immediately fell to his knees.

“Just kill me.”

The man gave a bitter laugh.

The weapon that he was most proud of has been destroyed by this man single-handedly.

How strong was this man to be able to do so?

He was sure that none of the respected warriors would be able to do so.

This man may possibly be…..wait, no….this man was definitely a sage warrior!

Lin Xiu slowly walked toward the man.

When he heard the footsteps, he quickly closed his eyes.

However, the pain that he had expected did not come.

“Why should I kill you?” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When he heard Lin Xiu talking to him, the man quickly opened his eyes and stared at Lin Xiu in disbelief.

He couldn’t understand why Lin Xiu didn’t kill him when he was a failure.

“I’m giving you a chance now.’

Lin Xiu looked at him and told him the truth.

The man was stunned as it was a lie if he said that he wasn’t afraid of dying.

He had no other choice since Lin Xiu was much more powerful than he was.

If he had a chance to live, he could definitely hold on to it.

“I’ll tell you! What do you want to know?!”

The man quickly answered.

“You have been here for ten years?”

Lin Xiu asked a question.

The Tianjiao Competition happened once in every decade which means that the portal would only happen once in every ten years.

“That’s right.”

The man paused for a moment before answering.

It has been ten years and he still hasn’t become a sage warrior.

In return, he was stuck in this place and he couldn’t leave.

“Tell me everything that you know.”

Lin Xiu said to the man.

The man was a little hesitant but he still told Lin Xiu everything that he knew.

His name was Duan Zheyan, one of the top 100 warriors ten years ago.

While he was in space for 5 days, he didn’t find what he wanted and he never became a sage warrior either.

In order to stay here longer, he gave his source ring to a friend and found a spot where he could hide from the warriors detecting those left behind in space. That’s how he stayed inside the space all these years.

He was stuck here for 10 years.

He came in as a young warrior in his twenties and he was now a middle aged man in his thirties.

“I bought these robots in the city. S grade robots each for 100 gold coins.”

The man looked a little heartbroken as he mentioned the robots.

He had five of them who had skills similar to a respected warrior and he didn’t think that they would be destroyed so easily.

When he thought of how Lin Xiu had a ‘sphere’ that was offensive instead of just a defensive one, he was still surprised.

“Gold coins? You use gold coins here?”

Lin Xiu has only seen this grassfield and a wooden house nearby. He could imagine that this sage warrior space was like a world on its own.

“It’s a little difficult to get them.”

Duan Yanzhe nodded his head.

“Do you have a map of this place?”

“Yes.”

With that, Duan Yanzhe pressed onto one of the buttons on the watch on his wrist and a projection came out of it.

“This is the mini computer that all of us have to get in this sage warrior space.”

As Duan Yanzhe explained it to Lin Xiu, he slowly moved the projection and it showed a map of the space.

There was a tiny dot on the map which pinned his location.
