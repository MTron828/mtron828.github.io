1428 Finally Obtained the Spatial Magic Cube

“No!!!”

Thank you readers!

Looking at Lin Xiu’s Dark edge spear, Long Yingtian let out a roar.

He wanted to use the remaining source strength in his body to form a shield to resist.

boom–

However, Lin Xiu’s spear easily pierced through the shield formed by his source strength, and stabbed his heart!

!!

The tip of the spear with the Netherworld flame pierced directly through his chest.

The severe pain caused Long Yingtian to let out a howl.

“Long…Long Yingtian is dead!?”

When the warriors around saw this scene, their eyes were filled with shock.

He’s the number one person under the God King, and yet he was pierced through the chest by Lin Xiu’s spear!

“Impossible… This is impossible…”

Long Yingtian grabbed the barrel of the spear with both hands and roared loudly.

With a thought, a large amount of dark blue flames burst out from the entire body of the Dark edge spear.

These dark blue flames penetrated into his entire body directly along the tip of the spear that pierced through his heart.

Boom——

In the next moment, Long Yingtian’s entire body was covered in flames!

At this moment, his soul strength has been completely swallowed up by the little black dragon.

At this time, the little black dragon’s body seems to have become even bigger.

It can no longer be called a little black dragon, it should be called a black dragon.

“This is a black-level divine soul…”

“A black-level divine soul that can devour other people’s divine soul…”

The warriors and spectators around couldn’t help but tremble when they saw this scene.

A black-level divine soul is not scary.

This is simply unheard of.

horrible.

boom–

Following Lin Xiu’s withdrawal of the Dark edge spear from his chest, Long Yingtian’s entire body instantly fell to the ground.

The Netherworld flame had already burned his flesh.

There is only one sentence left.

And Lin Xiu, at this time, has also become the number one on the god battle list!

The surrounding audience suddenly went into an uproar.

Unexpectedly, on the last day of the god battle list, Lin Xiu went directly from the bottom to the top!

This strength is too terrifying.

“This guy, could he be the God King…”

Some warriors in the audience couldn’t help but exclaim.

Even Long Yingtian, who was known as the number one person under the god king, was killed so quickly. How strong is this guy?

“Impossible. If it is the strength of the god king, he will not be able to enter the power of the rules here.”

A warrior shook his head.

This place was established by several powerful god kings in ancient times, and they had set specific rules.

Only warriors below the god king level would not be affected by the power of the rules.

At this moment, Lin Xiu sat cross-legged on the spot.

Then start to practice the cultivation technique.

With the operation of the cultivation technique, the source strength that Lin Xiu lost just now was recovering at an extremely fast speed.

Once it’s twelve o’clock midnight, if no one challenges Lin Xiu again, he will directly take the first place.

The top 100 fighters on the God Battle List have all entered the God Battlefield.

Although there were still many fighters fighting on the stage, there ases no fighters who dared to go to the main stage and challenge for the first place.

After watching the battle just now, as long as you are not a fool, you will not challenge it.

At the same time, Lin Xiu also felt the arrival of the sequelae of [Fury].

Although his whole body was weak and uncomfortable, Lin Xiu was still expressionless at this moment.

Time passed quickly.

It’s twelve o’clock.

“Ding!”

Following a loud and crisp sound, a dazzling light suddenly appeared in the sky above.

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked toward the sky.

A few huge phantoms of the god kings appeared in the air.

“The god battle list is over.”

“All participants will be blessed.”

The ethereal voices of these god kings came out.

Streams of energy immediately flew toward the bodies of the warriors!

One of the energies flew to Lin Xiu’s body immediately.

It made Lin Xiu’s whole body glow white.

As soon as this energy entered his body, Lin Xiu felt very comfortable.

It seems to be bathed in sunlight.

“One hundredth place, Zhang Jiejie, award, god-level skill.”

At the same time, in the sky, the ethereal voices of those god kings came again.

A special god-level skill card appeared directly in the sky and flew towards Zhang Jiejie, who was ranked 100th.

“Ninety-ninth place, Tan Liang, award, Sky fire stone.”

“Ninety-eighth place, Zhao Chaoying, award, Divine ember wing.”

“Ninety-seventh…”

“…”

At this time, as the voice of the god king continued to sound, various treasures appeared, and they all flew towards the warriors on the top hundred list!

The warriors around saw this scene, their eyes were red. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

These were all legendary treasures!

Even the 100th ranked god-level skill was a god-level skill that doesn’t exist anywhere else!

Soon, as the awards continued to be issued, it was the first place’s turn.

The huge phantoms of these god kings seem to be looking at Lin Xiu.

“First place, award, Spatial Magic Cube.”

As soon as they finished speaking, a bright light suddenly burst out in the air.

Its whole body is black, but from the gaps, a large amount of white light burst out from the Spatial Magic Cube, which suddenly appeared in the air.

At this moment, it flew directly towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu looked at this scene, and immediately fixed his eyes on the Spatial Magic Cube.

Finally, I got it!

Stretching out his right hand, the Spatial Magic Cube began to land in Lin Xiu’s palm.

At this moment, a tingling pain came out, and blood immediately seeped out of Lin Xiu’s palm.

The seeped blood was instantly absorbed by the Spatial Magic Cube.

And Lin Xiu, at this time, seemed to feel that he had a special connection with the Spatial Magic Cube.

Do you recognize the Lord?

Lin Xiu also showed surprise in his eyes.

Obviously, this Spatial Magic Cube is an artifact!!!

“The ranking of the god battle list is over.”

As the voice of the God King came from the sky again, the dazzling white light also began to slowly disappear.

The whole space, at this time, also tends to be calm.

Lin Xiuxi was holding the Spatial Magic Cube in his hand, and at this moment his thoughts were triggered.

The Spatial Magic Cube, also following Lin Xiu’s thoughts, was suspended in an instant, and then spun wildly.

Soon, it burst out with white light, covering Lin Xiu directly!

In the next moment, both Lin Xiu and the Spatial Magic Cube disappeared in place.
