1346 Practicing God-level skills

Sure enough, what Xiao Qingchen said was right, in this God warrior Realm, besides the Flame of chaos, there are other terrifying flames.

This Netherworld Flame is one of them.

This kind of flame is in the Netherworld of the God warrior Realm.

It’s another continent in the God warrior Realm, Dark continent.

!!

It is said that there are many undead creatures there.

It’s hard to deal with.

Ordinary warriors are not willing to go there.

And the Netherworld flame appeared in that area.

A very strange flame, which is said to be able to burn not only a person’s flesh, but also a person’s soul.

“This flame is a bit terrifying…”

Looking at the explanation on the information, Lin Xiu also showed surprise.

Because it could burn people’s souls!

For the God warriors, the most terrifying thing is not the attack on their bodies, but the damage to their souls.

“I can go and have a look though.”

The more powerful and terrifying the flame, the more attractive it is to Lin Xiu.

But before going, he wanted to practice the God-level skill Cards he obtained earlier.

‘Dragon’s Abyssal Fury’ ‘True Flame Fist’ ‘Soul Eater’.

He chose these three in total.

In the past few days, he has allowed himself to completely absorb the power of the blood marrow in his body.

He took out one of the ‘Soul Eater’ god-level skill cards.

“It’s said that even God King Tianling couldn’t use this one, but for me…”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly at this moment.

Although God King Tianling is much stronger than Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu should be able to do things that he cannot do.

At this time, as Lin Xiu put the ‘Soul Eater’ skill card on his forehead, the source strength immediately gathered on his head.

Then it was passed on to the god-level skill card attached to the forehead.

But no matter how my source power poured into this ‘Soul Eater’ skill card, there was still no way to communicate with this skill card.

Just like an ordinary card, without any fluctuations.

“Analysis, engulf…”

At this time, Lin Xiu activated these two skills at the same time.

Soon, this god-level skill card began to tremble slowly.

Sure enough, what he thought was right, he was able to crack these cards with his system skills.

Soon, Lin Xiu heard a crisp sound from the system.

It’s the prompt sound that the ‘Engulf’ skill has been completed.

This card has special energy that cannot be sensed. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

It is because of the existence of this special energy that this card is protected.

And the Analytic eye also analyzed this card.

In the next moment, Lin Xiu easily communicated through his source strength, and transmitted all the information in the skill card to his mind.

This god-level skill card contains much more information than other god-level skill cards.

It made Lin Xiu accept the pain in his head for a while.

Damn…the information on this skill card is too much…

About a day passed before Lin Xiu stood up from sitting cross-legged.

“This skill… is a bit difficult…”

Even if all the skill information is printed in his mind, Lin Xiu still finds it very troublesome to use.

And it consumes a lot of energy.

“I’ll try again next time.”

This ‘Soul Eater’ is capable of directly devouring the soul of a warrior. It looks very powerful, but it is indeed a bit troublesome to use it.

After looking at the remaining two god-level skill cards, he continued to use them.

Compared to the ‘Soul Eater’ just now, using these two god-level skill cards is relatively easy.

Of course, it was only relatively easy, but it still took a day.

“Lin Xiu! Lin Xiu!”

Early the next morning, Lin Xiu heard Baili Haoling’s excited voice.

“What’s wrong?”

Lin Xiu opened the door and stretched.

“I have absorbed all the power of the blood marrow!”

...

Baili Haoling looked excitedly at Lin Xiu and said excitedly.

It took about a week before she finally absorbed all the power of the blood marrow.

At this time, the strength of the body is obviously much stronger.

“Oh, I see.”

Lin Xiu yawned. It’s really tiring to learn this god-level skill card these two days.

“What do you mean by that?”

Baili Haoling glared at Lin Xiu. Her strength has improved a lot!

But after feeling it carefully, Lin Xiu’s strength has improved even more terrifyingly.

“You… you are simply a monster…”

Baili Haoling couldn’t help but said at this time.

“The energy fluctuations in the air are quite strong…”

...

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked around and couldn’t help but sigh.

Lei Tong has completely installed the energy conversion device, and a large number of energy stones have been converted into energy.

The energy of the entire Lingxian City has become extremely strong, and now the entire city is cultivating.

“Well, this time is indeed suitable for cultivation.”

Baili Haoling nodded slightly.

“By the way, I’ll go to a place first, Rollie and Xiaobai, you can take care of the place for a while.”

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something, and said directly.

“Where are you going? I’m going too!”

Baili Haoling was a little curious and said quickly.

It’s so boring here!

“The Netherworld in the Dark Continent.”

Lin Xiu said in a low voice.

“It is said that there are many undead creatures there, like zombies, skeletons and so on.”

Baili Haoling listened to his words, and after imagining it in her mind, she suddenly felt goosebumps.

She really hates this kind of disgusting-looking things.

“I won’t go then.”

At this moment, Baili Haoling shook her head like a rattle.

“Okay, then I’ll go first.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu rubbed Baili Haoling’s head subconsciously and then left directly.

After Baili Haoling was stunned for a moment, she said angrily, “Damn Lin Xiu, I’m not a child!”

She could be Lin Xiu’s mother with her age!

But soon, she stood rooted at the same place, as if she was a little doubtful of life.

“It seems that the kid is only about nineteen years old…”

On the previous earth, being a rank 6 warrior at this age was already quite powerful.

But this guy… has become a God warrior now!

And he’s a very powerful one!

“City Lord Lin, you’re here?”

At the same time, Pang Tong in the forest clearly sensed Lin Xiu’s arrival.

“Um.”

Lin Xiu came out and nodded slightly.

“I want to go to the Dark continent.”

“Now that I have been canonized as a god king by God King Tianling, and I have an identity certificate, I should be able to leave this place at will, right?”
