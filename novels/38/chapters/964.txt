Chapter 965: News on the Orchid of Heaven

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Wu Hao looked into Lin Xiu’s eyes.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would refuse such a great exchange.

“Are you sure you have information about the Orchid of Heaven?”

Lin Xiu asked once again.

He wasn’t interested in the shares of the Wu family.

!!

He was only interested in the orchid of Heaven.

He has to find it as soon as possible.

Lin Xiu has already been on this planet for quite some time. The longer he stayed here, the more he felt tortured.

“I can guarantee it with my life.”

Wu Hao answered him solemnly.

“Deal.”

Lin Xiu answered without any hesitation.

“Pass me the information on the Angel’s Tears.”

“Great!”

Wu Hao nodded his head and passed a micro computer over to Lin Xiu.

“This is where I kept all the information that I have collected about the Angel’s Tears.”

Lin Xiu took the computer and left.

As Wu Hao watched Lin Xiu leave the room, he took a puff from his cigar.

“Boss, he doesn’t look like someone who’s easy to control.”

One of the warriors who were hiding in the dark suddenly appeared and spoke to Wu Hao.

“There’s something that he needs.”

Wu Hao said bluntly.

As long as Lin Xiu needed something, he would be able to use it as a condition for exchange in order to help himself.

“Would you be able to kill him?”

Wu Hao asked the man standing next to him.

All of the warriors who were hiding in the dark turned quiet after hearing what Wu hao asked.

They knew that they were powerful and knew lots of techniques.

But, when they were head on with Lin Xiu, they really couldn’t detect how strong Lin Xiu was.

It felt like a black hole and it was impossible for them to know what his actual abilities were.

“That’s enough. I have a feeling that he will be able to get me the Angel’s Tears.”

Wu Hao waved his hands as he looked at the door where Lin Xiu left.

“Wang Qiang, are you alright?”

Lin Xiu got back to the treatment room and asked Wang Qiang who just had his wounds tended to.

“I’m much better now.”

Wang Qiang moved his arm before showing Lin Xiu a big smile.

The healing potions on this planet were extremely efficient. For most of the wounds and injuries, they only have to use these healing potions and the wounds will close within a short period of time.

However, it was extremely hard for them to restore their stamina.

“Let’s go. The competition is about to start.”

The stage right outside was now filled with people.

“The 1300th group Lin Xiu and Wang Qiang against the 630th group, Zhang Zhen and Sun Kai!”

As the announcer reported their names, all of the audience gathered around the stage.

Zhang Zhen and Sun Kai were both tall and muscular men.

They were both carrying huge weapons as well.

One of them had a massive axe while the other was holding onto a massive hammer.

“You were hired by Wu Hao as well?”

Sun Kai looked at Lin Xiu and Wang Qiang before asking Lin Xiu.

His eyes had a murderous look in them.

“Hmm?”

Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows.

As for Wang Qiang, he had no idea what they were talking about.

“Sun Kai, don’t waste your time with them. No matter who it is, we just have to kill them and get our hands on the 51% of shares in the Wu family.”

Zhang Zhen showed a hideous smile on his face as he spoke to Sun Kai.

“Match Start!”

As soon as the announcement was given, Sun Kai and Zhang Zhen instantly rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Wang Qian panicked as he saw Sun Kai heading towards him with the giant axe.

He grabbed onto his spear and was ready to fight.

Clang clang clang – –

There were loud explosive sounds that came from their weapons as they fought.

Sparks were flying everywhere.

“Hahahaha….that’s all you’ve got?”

“Indeed, those who use spears are rubbish!”

Sun Kai continued swinging his giant axe as he laughed.

“Shut up!”

Wang Qiang shouted in rage and all the energy in his body exploded. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He continued blocking the attack that was coming from Sun Ka with his long spear.

Sun Kai’s attacks were too strong and Wang Qiang could only block his attacks. Wang Qiang had no chance to attack Sun Kai!

“Kid! Let me show you how this is done!”

On the other hand, Zhang Zhen was holding onto his giant hammer and was getting closer to Lin Xiu. He leaped into the air, held the hammer above his head and threw it downwards!

He was about to make Lin Xiu into a patty!

Boom – –

Then, Lin Xiu looked up at the hammer that was getting closer to him. He smirked, lifted up his right hand and touched the hammer with his index finger.

“This…”

The warriors in the audience thought that Lin Xiu would end up being a burger patty.

However, the thing that happened next shocked all of them.

This was because Lin Xiu managed to stop the hammer with only one finger!

This giant hammer didn’t even bend Lin Xiu’s finger!

“Well, it is what I expected.”

Wu hao, who was amongst the audience, mumbled to himself.

Zhang Zhen and Sun Kai were respected warriors.

Although it wasn’t long since they became respected warriors, they were still considered strong and powerful warriors.

But, Lin Xiu managed to block the attack so casually which meant that he was much stronger than the both of them.

“This dude…”

Zhang Zhen was shocked as well.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be able to block his attack in such a manner.

This was one of the biggest humiliations that he has ever faced!

“Explosive Hammer!!!!!”

He screamed as soon as he hit the ground. Zhang Zhen continued swinging the huge hammer that he was holding onto and aimed it towards Lin Xiu.

As he slowly transferred his source energy into the hammer, the weapon slowly turned red.

As he continued swinging the hammer, there were multiple small explosions that happened into the air.

Boom – –

There were also explosions on the ground happening around them.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

However, Lin Xiu was moving around like a shadow.

The explosions that were coming from his hammer didn’t even hit Lin Xiu once.

“Go to hell!!!!”

“Crushing Thunderbolt!!!!”

Zhang Zhen was slowly becoming mad. He was screaming out loud when a purple sourcemark appeared on his forehead.

There was a bright light that appeared from his head as well.

Right at that moment, there was a large number of purple coloured thunderbolts that came from his giant hammer!

“Quick! Move aside!”

When the announcer saw what was coming out of the hammer, he started screaming at the audience.

With warrior skills on such a large scale, most of the audience might be affected by it!

The warriors who were busy watching the match suddenly looked frightened as well.

Soon, all of them released their ‘sphere’ and was running away from the stage!
