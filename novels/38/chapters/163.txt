Chapter 164: Inferiority Complex

Lin Xiu looked up and saw a few men who were in the Sacred Region Academy white school uniforms.

Looking at the symbols on their clothes, they were clearly second-year students.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Xiu raised his brows at this moment and said while looking at them straight in the eye

There was no trace of fear in his eyes.

“Oh, it seems that this freshman is very smug huh.” One of the men saw the way Lin Xiu looked at them and grabbed him by his collar, lifting him up.

The other two men also looked at Lin Xiu with an unfriendly gaze.

“Yu Yi’s friends?” Lin Xiu looked at him and asked.

At this moment, because of the aftereffects of ‘Rage’, he really had no strength.

“You went up to the 21st floor on the very first day. It seems that you’re very powerful. Come and fight with me.” The man did not answer Lin Xiu’s question and spoke with a smirk.

At this time, he also discovered that Lin Xiu was exceptionally weak, which seemed to be caused by the battle just now.

“I see.” Lin Xiu thought about it, then mumbled to himself.

“What do you know?” The man frowned at this moment.

Lin Xiu seemed undaunted, making the man even more annoyed.

“You’re at the bottom of the second grade, right?” Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Shut up!” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the man yelled as if Lin Xiu had touched his sore point.

The other two men’s expressions changed too.

“Why don’t I take a guess?” Lin Xiu raised the corner of his mouth and said.

“Before you guys came to the Sacred Region Academy, all of you were the top in school, right?”

“But you didn’t expect that after coming to the Sacred Region Academy, there were too many top students here, stealing your limelight.”

“So you guys like bullying freshmen, right?” Lin Xiu continued to speak.

At this moment, the faces of these people turned nasty.

Every word that came out of Lin Xiu’s mouth was opening their bloody wounds.

“Shut up!!!”

The man pulled Lin Xiu’s collar forcefully at this time and roared loudly.

“You can’t bully people of the same grade, so you can only bully freshmen to gain a sense of superiority?”

“And seeing that I defeated Yu Yi, as long as you guys managed to teach me a lesson, all of you would feel very strong?”

“How inferior do you guys feel ah?” Lin Xiu said with a sigh.

“I told you to shut up!!!” Lin Xiu’s last sentence almost made him vomit blood and completely set off his anger.

He wanted to punch Lin Xiu in the face.

At this moment, when his fist was about to hit Lin Xiu’s face, he was stopped by someone.

“You…” The man turned around and saw that a very beautiful girl appeared next to him.

Yes, very beautiful, her soft black hair was drifting lightly in the breeze.

But her eyes were very cold and just looking at them made him tremble.

“Let go of him.” Luo Yue said indifferently.

Then, her hand slammed hard and there was a ‘click’ which sounded like the bones were shattered.

The intense pain caused the man’s eyes to widen instantly, and in the next moment, he let go of Lin Xiu.

“Courting death!!!” At this moment, the other two men suddenly attacked Luo Yue!

Their speed was fast, but Luo Yue was faster.

Luo Yue kicked the man who had just pulled Lin Xiu’s collar into the air.

Then immediately fought with the other two men.

Luo Yue was not holding a weapon and it was the first time that Lin Xiu has seen her fight with bare hands.

Lin Xiu was surprised that even without a weapon, Luo Yue’s skills were exceptional.

Click, click, click——

As Luo Yue’s fist hit their arms, their arms made bone-cracking sounds.

‘Rupturing Fist’!!!

Luo Yue also knew ‘Rupturing Fist’!?

This was really beyond Lin Xiu’s expectations.

“Ah!!!” Following Luo Yue’s attack, they let out a scream.

“Get lost.” Luo Yue glanced coldly at the people who had been knocked down on the ground and said.

Their eyes were full of fear at this moment. How can this amazingly beautiful girl have such a terrifying skill?

And she’s so ruthless.

They heard Luo Yue’s words and tolerated the severe pain of their broken arms, then left immediately.

“Phew, thank you.” Lin Xiu, who was sitting on the ground, smiled at Luo Yue.

There were still several minutes left in the state of ‘Fury’ and Lin Xiu’s body was still immobile.

Although the explosive power of ‘Fury’ was very powerful, the aftereffects were too terrible.

He encountered a few students from the Sacred Region Academy this time, but if he encountered someone who wanted his life next time, it would be a big problem.

“Can you walk?” Luo Yue asked as she looked at Lin Xiu. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Hold on, I have no strength now.” Lin Xiu said, panting.

“Come up.” Luo Yue hesitated a little then squatted down in front of Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was startled- was she going to carry him?

“Come up.” Luo Yue frowned slightly and repeated herself.

Lin Xiu was not pretentious and simply put his hands on her shoulders directly.

“I am returning you the favor.” Luo Yue said faintly and easily carried Lin Xiu on her back.

She recalled that Lin Xiu carried her like this when he saved her and her cold eyes revealed a hint of warmth.

But it was fleeting and Lin Xiu didn’t notice it either.

Lin Xiu curled his lips when she heard what she said, thinking that she had found her conscience and decided to treat him better.

From time to time, some students from the Sacred Region Academy would widen their eyes in surprise when they saw them.

‘An extremely beautiful girl carrying a man?’

While some people despised Lin Xiu, they were envious in their hearts.

And Luo Yue continued in her own way, she didn’t care about their stares at all.

Lin Xiu’s cheek leaned against her shoulder at this time and there was a faint fragrance on her body which smelled very good.

Lin Xiu didn’t know why but his heartbeat seemed to have accelerated.

Seeing her delicate and fair side profile, Lin Xiu unexpectedly kissed her gently…
