Chapter 987: Divine Domain’s Moves

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Elder Yi, what’s wrong?”

One of them walked over to Yi Changkong silently and said curiously.

“Look at the monument.”

Yi Changkong pointed to the stone tablet representing the Tianjiao Ranking and said.

“Um?”

He followed Yi Changkong’s eyes to the stone tablet.

Taking a closer look, he also saw Thirty-Three next to Lin Xiu’s name.

“Has this kid obtained thirty-three source rings?”

The eyes of this Sage warrior were full of surprise.

“But Qian Zheng has forty source rings.”

He looked at it with his eyes, then pointed to the number one warrior on the tablet and said aloud.

“He has thirty-three sources and ranks thirty-three, don’t you think it’s a bit strange?”

Yi Changkong said.

“Indeed… this guy didn’t get them out of sheer luck, right?”

The warrior also said out of curiosity.

Yi Changkong looked at the list and felt a little weird.

Logically speaking, after ordinary warriors touch the stone tablet, they will form a special source power mark on them.

In the Sage warrior Space, this tablet can also feel their changes in strength and change their position ranking.

Even if a warrior deliberately hides his strength, it is useless.

“It’s really weird…”

Just when Yi Changkong felt extremely strange, there was a sound of footsteps from the other side.

There are many people coming and there is a strong strength.

Feeling all this, Yi Changkong’s eyes changed slightly.

“Who is coming!”

At this moment, he roared angrily, like thunder rolling in the sky and the surrounding ground shook.

The rest of the Sage warriors around here all looked to the back.

At this time, a large group of warriors in uniforms came over from the other side.

“Elder Yi, long time no see.”

A white-haired old man walking in the front said aloud to Yi Changkong.

“Huangfu Bai?”

Looking at the white-haired old man walking at the forefront, Yi Changkong frowned slightly.

The other Sage warriors also stood beside Yi Changkong at this time.

At this time, beside Huangfu Bai, there are Huangfu Lin and Huangfu Zhong, these two warriors who are also at the Sage warrior level.

And those warriors behind him are all top-level Respected warrior-level warriors, there are as many as one hundred!

“People from the Divine Domain, what do you guys want?”

One of the warriors standing beside Yi Changkong also said coldly at this time.

“Sorry, we have no intention of conflicting with your ‘Ten Sages’.”

Huangfu Bo said with a smile at this time.

The ten Sage warriors headed by Yi Changkong are called the ‘Ten Sages’ by the world. They are the Sage warrior-level warriors who are responsible for the opening of the Sage warrior Space every year.

They were very famous in the whole world.

People in the Divine Domain don’t dare to offend them easily.

“Stop talking nonsense, now is the time to open the Sage warrior Space, what do you guys want?”

Yi Changkong glanced at them, then said lightly.

“The three elders of the Divine Domain came here. I’m afraid it’s not as simple as coming to us to reminisce about the past and chit chat, right?”

Another Sage warrior also looked at the people in the Divine Domain and said.

“We want to enter the Sage warrior Space.”

Huangfu Bai also restrained the smile on his face at this time, looked at Yi Changkong and others and said.

“no.”

Yi Changkong directly shook his head and said.

“According to the rules, only the top 100 warriors in the Tianjiao competition can enter, the rest of the warriors are not allowed to enter!”

The rest of the Sage warriors also looked at the people in the Divine Domain and did not step back in the slightest.

“Elder Yi, don’t be so inflexible.”

Huangfu Bai showed a smile, then took out a token from his arms and threw it to Yi Changkong.

Yi Changkong snorted coldly, waved his right hand and caught the token.

Pressing the token and looking at it, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

“Huangfu is undefeated…”

“Your Divine Domain, what are you going to do?”

Yi Changkong put away the token and said coldly.

“Just looking for someone, don’t worry, we won’t destroy this Sage warrior space.”

Huangfu Bai said lightly.

“You can’t destroy it either.”

Yi Changkong said coldly.

“I’ll take back the token, this is the last time.”

As Yi Changkong spoke, he glanced at the other nine Sage warriors.

These nine Sage warriors also knew what Yi Changkong meant.

At the next moment, the ten Sage warriors headed by Yi Changkong simultaneously exerted their power.

Boom—

As their strength gathered together, there was a huge explosion sound in front of them.

Immediately, the space in front was directly broken and a huge opening was opened.

“Very good, let’s go!”

Huangfu Bo looked at this scene at this time and nodded with satisfaction.

With the triggering of his thoughts, his body flew in directly.

Huangfu Lin, Huangfu Zhong and the warriors behind them all flew in at the same time.

Huangfu Lin’s eyes are now full of killing intent.

Thinking of the scene when Lin Xiu snatched the Beast Saint-level Odd Crystal and later returned to Wildfire City to fight and severely injured him, his eyes were filled with infinite killing intent.

This time, Lin Xiu, must die!

And Lin Xiu, who was in the burial place, didn’t know all of this at this time.

At this time, after Luo Hu gave the source ring to Lin Xiu and when Lin Xiu didn’t kill him, he quickly left.

He didn’t want to find anything to improve his strength in this Sage warrior space now and he didn’t even want to stay here for another moment.

“This guy shouldn’t be lying.”

“But where is the entrance…”

Lin Xiu was walking on this burial place at this time and said aloud like he was talking to himself.

clap clap-

As Lin Xiu walked on this burial ground, a strange sound suddenly rang out.

The more and more gloomy wind burst out around, especially with this kind of strange sound, it gave one goosebumps.

boom–

Just as a black figure rushed towards Lin Xiu from behind, Lin Xiu punched it directly.

A white light burst out from the fist.

‘Fist Ray’!

Boom—

With a sound that sounded like a space explosion, a skeleton was instantly smashed into countless pieces by Lin Xiu.

Skeleton?

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked around and saw the dirt of the surrounding tombs slowly slipping out.

The wrists of some skeletons slowly stretched out from the soil on the ground.

It was as if they were about to rush up from the ground. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

clack clack——

A lot of bone cracking sounded and more and more skeletons seemed to come alive.

“It seems that some hidden mechanism has been triggered.”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu said thoughtfully.

Because this world was like a game world, everything that happens here should be guessed with the logic of a game.

Luo Hu should have been here before, but this event was not triggered.

Before Lin Xiu could continue to think about it, all these skeletons rushed toward Lin Xiu!
