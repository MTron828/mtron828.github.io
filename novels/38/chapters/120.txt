Chapter 121: Desert Zone

Rumble-

As Lin Xiu’s spear came forth, the thunder seemed to fill the entire sky.

The female warrior felt that Lin Xiu’s black spear seemed to release a blinding light.

The entire spear seemed to have transformed into a translucent galaxy river and was extremely beautiful yet dazzling.

And as the light pervaded the entire area, the region seemed to have turned into a sea of stars!

‘What kind of skill is this?!’

All the crescent blades she had unleashed had disappeared as well.

Sou-

Before she could even react, a gigantic burst of white light flashed past her!

“Goodbye.” Lin Xiu’s figure had appeared behind her.

He held the Dark Edge spear with his right hand as the bottom of the spear pressed against the soil.

It was as though Lin Xiu was a god of war that stood in his original position as the wind and breeze whistled past him.

“You…” The female warrior finally reacted. Upon recalling all his movements, her body froze as it was cut into two.

“Whew.” Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief. The gold skill was indeed powerful, and all the skills provided by the system were unique and never before seen in this world. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

At this time the notification of him earning experience appeared again. Lin Xiu did not take a look, a rank 3 warrior yielded about a few hundred thousand experience points. It was not that easy to level up.

He held the Dark Edge spear and continued forward.

Rain flies appeared endlessly but they were nothing to Lin Xiu. He was able to kill them with ease.

After walking for an unknown period of time, Lin Xiu stumbled upon a sight that rendered him speechless. It was the end of the zone and on to the new zone.

The zone ahead did not have any azure blue trees and looked as though the place was radiating with sunlight.

Ahead of him was a desert region!

One side was a heavy downpour while upon stepping out, the entire weather changed into a desert. It was simply inconceivable.

Once he stepped onto the sand, the water droplets on his body dripped onto the ground and produced steam.

Hot, it suddenly became extremely hot.

If one did not prepare sufficient water in this region, they would be dehydrated very quickly.

Fortunately, Lin Xiu had come prepared.

Lin Xiu took out a small vase filled with blue liquid. As long as he drank a mouthful, it was enough to keep him hydrated for a day.

After having a drink, he continued onward.

Pitter Patter-

As Lin Xiu continued, he would hear a strange sound as though raindrops were falling.

But he was in a barren desert, how could there be water?

No, the sound came from beneath his feet!

Lin Xiu became alarmed and immediately jumped upwards!

Right when he jumped, the sand on the ground seemed to tremble as a gigantic worm charged out!

The worm’s entire body was cylindrical and had golden skin with thorns all over. Even more terrifying was its mouth, the entire mouth was circular with densely clustered teeth. The sight of it made his scalp go numb.

Lin Zi was shocked out of his skin and immediately activated Analytic Eye:

Rank 4 Evolved Beast – Hermit Worm

Found in barren deserts, Hermit worms were extremely fast and thrived beneath the surface to launch deadly attacks from underneath.

Right as Lin Xiu was analyzing the Hermit Worm, it charged towards him again.

It opened its large mouth with the intent of swallowing him up.

“Awe of the Phoenix!” Lin Xiu leaped upwards as he swung his arms wildly and summoned phoenixes that swept down at the fastest speed towards the mouth of the giant worm.

Gululu-

As the phoenixes entered the mouth, the Hermit Worm felt immense pain and started to roll on the ground.

That easy?

Lin Xiu landed on the ground and stared at the Hermit Worm.

The Hermit Worm stopped moving soon afterwards.

As though it was dead.

Lin Xiu looked at it and sneered, the rank 4 evolved beast was truly intelligent, to actually feign dead in such a situation?”

“Hahaha, that’s a Hermit Worm!” Right at this time, a group of people saw the sight of the ‘dead’ hermit worm from another side of the desert and rushed over.

The group consisted of four males and one female. They rushed over very quickly.

“You killed it?” One of the taller men looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

While saying that, he sized Lin Xiu up and felt that Lin Xiu was only a rank 1 warrior, he was able to come here with such strength? And even kill a hermit worm?

He must have taken advantage of it!

“I hunted it,” Lin Xiu replied indifferently.

“It’s yours just because you said it is?” An unbridled-looking man snorted.

He saw that Lin Xiu was alone and did not look strong, so his attitude was extremely detestful.

‘I can kill with a pinch from my fingers!’

“Chen Kun, if it was his, then forget about it.” The tanned girl spoke up.

“Zhang Yin, control your woman, where does she think she is now. This is the Path of Death!” The man called Chen Kun snorted coldly, it was obvious that he was unhappy with the lady.

“Let’s go, we will dig out the Odd Crystal of the Hermit Worm then the teeth. These are all good materials for crafting weapons!” Chen Kun’s eyes lit up.

“I said it once, this is my prey.” Lin Xiu’s eyes turned cold.

Chen Kun glanced at Lin Xiu and did not care about him and ran towards the worm with another guy.

Chen Kun stood on top of the Hermit Worm’s head and dug out metal pliers from his bag, he wanted to pull the teeth out!

The Hermit Worm’s teeth were extremely sharp and were considered materials to craft weapons. Be it to sell or use, it was extremely good stuff.

But right as Chen Kun reached out to the gigantic mouth, the seemingly dead Hermit Worm suddenly moved!
