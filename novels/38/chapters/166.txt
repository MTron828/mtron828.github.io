Chapter 167: Luo Yue’s Rank 7 Odd Crystal!

“Class 10? Don’t tell me you went to find that kid?” The man beside Zhuo Qixing was taken aback.

“Young Master Zhuo, do you want me to help you teach him a lesson.”

“Find a chance, take a few people with you, and teach those in Class 10 a lesson first.” Zhuo Qixing nodded and a strange smile rose from the corner of his mouth.

At the same time, Lin Xiu who was in the gravity room was gritting his teeth as he slowly got up.

But as soon as he stood up, his body was pressed down on the ground.

No way, he couldn’t bear five-fold gravity at all.

This so-called five-fold gravity was not just a five-fold increase, the load on him caused by this has already exceeded his limit.

“How weak.” Luo Yue said coldly as always.

Hearing her venomous words, Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and glared at her. He really wanted to beat her little ass up.

Then he tapped on the screen over there and in the next moment, he adjusted the gravity to four-folds.

“Phew…” Lin Xiu suddenly felt relieved.

Although he was under four-fold gravity, it was still extremely strenuous for Lin Xiu. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

But compared to five-fold gravity, the pressure was still a lot less.

“I have this kind of machine at home.” Luo Yue fiddled with it, then as she skillfully pressed the machine, two long iron chains appeared from both sides of the machine.

Zi zi zi——

At this moment, a lot of electric currents appeared on the iron chain.

She was holding such a strong current in her hand but it was like nothing to her.

“10,000 volts.”

Lin Xiu swallowed his spit and said, “You’re totally fine?”

This was not a short-term current, but a continuous current. Holding these two chains, he could see a lot of electric currents flashing on her body.

But she seemed to be perfectly fine, it was simply shocking.

Luo Yue shook her head, “I have been training since I was a child.”

While she was talking, she walked towards Lin Xiu.

“What are you trying to do?” Lin Xiu’s eyes widened as soon as he saw her walking over and had a bad feeling about it.

But it was too late, Luo Yue directly grabbed his body.

“Ah!!!”

A miserable shriek came from the gravity room and the people in the training room outside seemed to have heard it.

“What’s wrong with Lin Xiu…?” Zhang Yin had goosebumps when he heard the screams.

Sure enough, the more beautiful a woman is, the more terrifying…

“It’s only 10,000 volts.” Luo Yue said curiously when she saw Lin Xiu’s whole body trembling from the electric shock.

“Hurry up… I’m going to… be burnt…” Lin Xiu said while trembling.

After Lin Xiu spoke, Luo Yue left Lin Xiu’s side.

Bang––

Lin Xiu simply laid on the ground at this time. That kind of ‘painful and refreshing’ feeling was really… he never wanted to experience it again.

But what surprised Lin Xiu was that when he was shocked, his experience bar was also rapidly rising.

But it was still a lot lesser compared to the absorption of Odd crystals.

Luo Yue continued with her electric shock resistance training and she increased the voltage of the electric current.

Holding the two silver chains with both hands, she seemed to be surrounded by a ball of silver electric current.

Lin Xiu was dumbfounded at this time.

Seeing that she was holding these two silver chains with a lot of electricity flowing through, he couldn’t help but imagine her whipping him up with these two chains…

Just thinking about it gave him the chills.

After resting for a while, Lin Xiu slowly eased up. Under the four-fold gravity, Lin Xiu felt that his body was extremely heavy.

At this moment, it was impossible to perform the laser ray avoidance training.

Bang––

At the same time, Luo Yue threw an object toward Lin Xiu.

‘What is this?’

Lin Xiu instinctively caught it. It was a sapphire blue Odd crystal, which looked exceptionally exquisite, like a brilliant blue diamond.

Seeing the appearance of this Odd crystal clearly and feeling the powerful energy contained in it made Lin Xiu’s eyes widen.

This is… the rank 7 Odd crystal!!!

“As a reward for using your points.” Luo Yue said faintly, her face was still the same and there weren’t any changes in her expression.

“But this is too precious…” Lin Xiu said.

‘Rank 7 Odd crystal!’

Even if he used his points to redeem, he would need 500,000 points!!!

“I’ll throw it away if you don’t want it.” Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu, then said indifferently.

Hearing her words, Lin Xiu held the Odd crystal tightly.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s reaction, the corner of Luo Yue’s mouth raised slightly, but it quickly disappeared.

With these rank 7 Odd crystals… it would speed up his cultivation.

As the freshmen assembly was approaching, Lin Xiu has been practicing in the gravity room.

From the initial four-fold gravity, he slowly upgraded to five-fold gravity!

The energy in the rank 7 Odd crystal was too dense, he hasn’t even absorbed half of the energy contained in it although he had been continuously absorbing it the past few days.

“Teacher, Luo Yue has been going to Class 1 recently to train with those scumbags, which is simply detrimental to the pride of our class!” In Class 1, a guy pointed at Luo Yue at this moment and said to the man on the podium.

As he said that, every student turned to look at Luo Yue.

Luo Yue was still minding her own business and writing something down. At this moment, she felt many eyes on her and she raised her head slightly, then said plainly, “You are also quite weak.”

“What do you mean, huh!!!” Hearing Luo Yue’s words, the guy’s face suddenly reddened with anger.

But it was true that his strength was indeed inferior to Luo Yue, which also made him very indignant.

Luo Yue got up at this time, ignored these people, and walked directly to the door.

“Interesting.” When Zhuo Qixing saw this scene, he couldn’t help but become even more interested in Luo Yue.

“Luo Yue, where are you going?” The teacher of Class 1 looked at Luo Yue with a headache and asked.

The daughter of the Luo family – he knew about Luo Yue’s family background and with their status, even the dean had to be friendly with them.

“Transfer class.” Luo Yue still looked like a person of few words. As soon as she said that, she walked outside without looking back.

She didn’t care about anyone’s feelings and opinions.
