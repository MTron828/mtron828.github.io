Chapter 964: Angel’s Tears

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

With the warriors’ fist on Lin Xiu ‘sphere’, there were cries of pain.

It was the warriors who were wailing.

As for Lin Xiu, he was fine the entire time.

Wu Hao stared at Lin Xiu, who was seated opposite him, and he was shocked.

He noticed that Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’ was dark blue in colour.

!!

It looked like a layer of dark clue flame that was surrounding Lin Xiu.

The warriors who had their fist on Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’ were now covered with a dark blue flame as well.

The warriors who were a little stronger could see the flesh and bones on their fist.

As for the weaker ones, their fists were burnt into ash because of the dark blue flames!

“Did you have fun?!”

Lin Xiu took a sip of his drink before gently shaking his cup as he asked Wu Hao.

“I’ll admit that you’re good.”

Wu Hao suddenly looked serious.

“But….do you know who I am?”

“So?”

Lin Xiu gave a sarcastic smile as he asked.

“I am the head of the Wu Corporates, about 50% of the cash flow on this planet is in my control. My family is also one of the strongest on this planet.”

Wu Hao glared at Lin Xiu as he told him.

Xiu – –

As he was talking, Lin Xiu’s fingers suddenly appeared right next to his temples.

There was also a bright, white light on the tip of his fingers.

This was the light coming from the source energy that was gathered at the tip.

“So what if you have those powers? With one snap of my fingers, you’ll be going to hell.”

Lin Xiu asked in return.

There were a few more men hidden in the dark and at this moment, all of them had shown themselves as they stood next to Lin Xiu.

“Four respected warriors. You have a very strong team.”

Lin Xiu said flatly.

But Wu Hao’s face was now looking awful.

These respected warriors were his hidden bodyguards and they would usually be unnoticed.

However, before they had an idea on how Lin Xiu’s abilities were, his life was already in Lin Xiu’s hands.

How strong was he?

Could it be that….his abilities were much higher than a respected warrior like he had expected? FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

He couldn’t help but shiver as he thought of it.

“I’ll admit that I must have underestimated you.”

Wu Hao’s forehead was now covered in cold sweats as he spoke to Lin Xiu.

“Tell me. Why do you want me to lose the match?”

Lin Xiu removed his fingers that were on Wu Hao’s temples and got back to his seat.

The four warriors wanted to attack Lin Xiu instead when they saw how Lin Xiu was no longer a threat to Wu Hao.

“Leave!”

Wu Hao looked at his men and screamed.

All of the warriors instantly disappeared within a blink of an eye.

They immediately went back into hiding.

“I’m looking for something.”

Wu Hao looked at Lin Xiu as he told him the truth.

As he spoke, he signalled the rest of his men.

Those who weren’t injured from earlier had to carry those who had been injured from attacking Lin Xiu.

“There is something that can only be found inside the sage warrior space.”

“So, I have paid a few of them in order for them to qualify.”

“Because I realised that your abilities are unique and you should be way above a respected warrior. I wanted you to lose so that my men could qualify instead.”

Wu Hao told him everything.

He really did not expect Lin Xiu to be such a powerful person.

However, at that moment, he could really feel the murderous intention coming from Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu could have really killed him with one finger.

He was sure about that.

This was why he became more cautious after that.

“What are you looking for?”

Lin Xiu got curious.

What would he be looking for if Wu Hao had to pay so many warriors?

The look in Wu Hao’s face changed as he was hesitant.

“The Angel’s Tears.”

He hesitated for a minute before telling Lin Xiu.

“The Angel’s Tears?”

“What’s that?”

Lin Xiu was lost as he had never heard of it previously.

“It’s the name of a flower. Legend says that it can bring people back to life.”

“I heard that there was once a man who saw this flower in the sage warrior sage. However, there was a huge evolved beast guarding it and he got severely injured instead.”

Wu Hao continued talking.

Since they were already at this stage, there was no need for him to hide anything else.

“A flower?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

“Let me ask you something.”

“Go ahead.”

Wu Hao was now looking at Lin Xiu as someone on the same level as him and there was no longer disrespecting Lin Xiu.

“Have you heard of the Orchid of Heaven?”

“It is also the name of a flower.”

Lin Xiu asked Wu Hao.

He has been on this planet for a long time but he has heard nothing about the Orchid of Heaven.

He couldn’t go back to the Dark Shadows now and he couldn’t get them to look for it.

“The Orchid of Heaven…”

“Of course.”

The look in Wu Hao’s eyes changed before he nodded his head.

“You’re telling the truth?!”

After hearing Wu Hao’s answer, Lin Xiu jumped in excitement as he couldn’t control himself.

Wu Hao was surprised by Lin Xiu’s movement and almost fell off his chair.

“Of course.”

Wu Hao patted his chest before saying.

“Tell me more.”

Lin Xiu looked at him and asked sincerely.

This time, he had come all the way to the Namir planet for two reasons. Other than completing the task given by the man who gave Lin Xiu his powers, Old Man Ye, he was also here to get the Orchid of Heaven to treat Luo Yue’s condition.

“There’s a condition for you to get the information that you want.”

Wu Hao smiled instead as he told Lin Xiu.

He was only afraid of people who didn’t want or care about anything.

This was good news for him that Lin Xiu wanted something.

“What is it?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes instead when he heard what Wu Hao said.

There was a vicious look in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

But, Wu Hao could now completely ignore the look coming from Lin Xiu.

“Get to the sage warrior space and get me the Angel’s Tears.”

Wu Hao clenched onto his fist as he told Lin Xiu.

“If you can find the Angel’s tears, I will tell you everything about the Orchid of Heaven and 51% of the shares of the Wu family.”

Wu Hao had a serious look on his face.

“51% of the shares would give you the power to control the Wu family and you will then become the richest person on the planet.”
