Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Boom

With a dull sound, the head pierced by Lin Xiu’s spear exploded in the next moment.

There was no blood and water, only a lot of lightning burst out.Hu Seeing that he finally died, Lin Xiu was also relieved.

A sense of exhaustion hits his body.

The source field on the platform disappeared in the next moment.

Amazing!”

The surrounding audience cheered excitedly at this time.

After all, fighting against a rank 9 warrior with one’s own strength, even though it was a rank 9 warrior whose strength was suppressed, was too powerful.

This kid”

Seeing this, Bai Litao couldn’t help but smiled helplessly.

Although Lin Xiu was victorious, this made many people have their eyes on him.

Especially the people of the Zhuo family, they would definitely not let Lin Xiu go like this!

“Where are you going?”

At the same time, Luo Yue, who had been sitting quietly in the seat on the other side, immediately got up and walked to the other side.

Seeing this scene, Yu Muchen said subconsciously. But Luo Yue didn’t answer his words and left the place.

Seeing this scene, Yu Muchen shook his head helplessly.

“It seems that this kid’s strength is much stronger than when he was in the Thunder Valley, but for me, it’s still too weak.”

At this time, Nan Huang still looked at Lin Xiu on the rooftop, then said with a smile.

“Prepare for the next game!”

At this time, the host watched Lin Xiu jump off the platform, then quickly arranged for the staff to clean up the scene.

Although the Zhuo family was not a small family in Sky City, but Lin Xiu killed the two Zhuo family members in a life-and-death battle and those Zhuo family members did not dare to do anything.

“Humph!”

At this time, the vice president of Sky City was so angry that his face became extremely ugly, he snorted coldly and left directly. There was no Sky Academy in the next battle and he couldn’t be bothered to watch

He stared at Lin Xiu over there, with a vicious look in his eyes.

“You kid, how much power are you hiding!

When Ouyang Hang saw Lin Xiu walking down, he said with a bit of dissatisfaction.

Originally, he thought that Lin Xiu’s strength was very strong, but now it seems that Lin Xiu has preserved so much strength that he actually killed Old

Monster Zhuo and Zhuo Qjxing on the platform. Lin Xiu smiled and did not answer Ouyang Hang’s words.

After the battle just now, many people have probably noticed him. In the next game, he would likely be the target.

The same was true for Baili Haoling.

“Have intemal injuries?

Baili Haoling glanced at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“En, I got a little hurt.”

Lin Xiu nodded. He was hit on the shoulder by the old monster Zhuo when they were fighting. After all, he was a rank 9 warrior. Now he felt a faint pain in his

shoulder.

“Here.

Baili Haoling took out a bottle of blue líquid from her pocket and threw it to Lin Xiu, “Apply it to the wound and you will recover faster.”

Well, thank you.”

Lin Xiu took the bottle of liquid directly. The next game is in the afternoon. It’s still early, so you can go back and rest

first.”

Baili Haoling looked at the time. It was around ten o’clock in the morning. The quarter-finals started at two in the afternoon.

“Wel, Ill go to the lounge to have a rest first.”

There was a lounge specially prepared for the top sixteen players nearby. The environment of the lounge was very good, like a very exquisite room.

The area of the room was about 50 square meters, which was quite large.After Lin Xiu walked in, he took off his battle suit and took a closer look. There were quite a few bruises on his skin.

Especially on the shoulders, there were red bloodstains.

“Damn...”

Lin Xiu poured the bottle of potion that Baili Haoling had just taken out on his shoulders and suddenly a tingling sensation came, causing Lin Xiu to clench

his teeth.

This was painful but good.

However, as the liquid poured into the wound, the bruises gradually dissipated.

“Huh”

Lin Xiu laied helplessly on the bed and took a deep breath.

After the battle just now, lying in bed now was really comfortable. Oh right

Lin Xiu only remembered at this time that he had just killed Old Monster Zhuo and Zhuo Qixing and he had not checked the experience he had gained. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

After entering the system, Lin Xiu could clearly see a bunch of system prompts. The experience gained from killing a rank 9 warrior is: 100,000,00..

Lin Xiu’s eyes were a bit blurry when he saw the series of numbers behind him.

However, the final result was that he was promoted by one level and now his level has become level 42!

After quickly and evenly distributing the acquired potential points, Lin Xiu felt his body relax for a while.

At this time, Lin Xiu was a little tired. Lying on the bed, he quickly fell asleep.

After some time, Lin Xiu was still sleeping, but he seemed to instinctively sense the danger and at this time he suddenly opened his eyes!

When he just opened his eyes, he saw a cold light appear in front of his eyes! The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank suddenly, but at this time, it seemed that it

was too late to dodge!

Dang–

At this critical moment, a crisp sound instantly rang.Tsk tsk, the rank 9 warrior of the Zhuo family is just like that?”

A coquettish voice came from behind.

“Humph!”

Looking around, he found that in front of him, there was a middle-aged man holding a handful of white cold light. His aura was very terrifying, making Lin

Xiu feel a strong sense of oppression.

And behind him, there was a woman in white clothes, holding a long sword, with a smile on her face, she didn’t seem afraid at all.

“Luo Yue!

“No.”

Seeing this woman, Lin Xiu said subconsciously, but soon he shook his head.

At first glance, this woman was somewhat similar to Luo Yue, but if you look closely, it was not her.

Tsk tsk, little guy, if that girl hadn’t asked me to protect you, you would be dead by noW.

The woman said to Lin Xiu with a smile. Looking closely, she was I sister, Luo Yan.

“You are..”

Just when Lin Xiu wanted to say something, the middle-aged man over there charged towards Lin Xiu with a dagger again!

His speed was too fast, so fast that Lin Xiu had no time to react.

But when the man was just swinging the dagger in his hand to Lin Xiu’s neck,

Lin Xiu felt his body being pulled directly behind him.
