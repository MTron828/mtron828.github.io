Chapter 733 Intensive Kill

The masked man held a long sword in his hand and was carrying a long stick or some kind of weapon on his back. It was wrapped in black cloth, so he couldn’t tell.

“Who are you!”

The middle-aged man looked at the blood-stained weapon in the masked man’s hands and said in surprise and anger.

His guards were all rank 8 warriors but they were all killed and didn’t even notice a thing when they were inside! How did he do it?

Through the mask, Lin Xiu looked towards Huangji who was behind him, his eyes narrowed involuntarily.

Lin Xiu specially spent money on the warrior website to inquire about information about Huangji.

Although the information was not very detailed, he knew that he has a good relationship with some local warrior groups in many areas.

In this Ice and Snow city, Huang Ji and one of the leaders, Xue Liantian, named ‘Xuehong Guild’, seem to have a good relationship.

Lin Xiu hid his aura and went over just now, but he didn’t expect that this Huangji was really here.

He seemed to be preparing to lure Lin Xiu out to kill him.

Therefore, Lin Xiu did not show any courtesy and immediately killed some of the guards of the Xuehong Army. The middle-aged man was Xue Liantian. At this time, Lin Xiu, who was wearing a mask, didn’t seem to want to answer him so he shouted angrily, “Kill him for me!”

Someone dared to come to his guild to make trouble and killed so many of his guards secretly. This was simply unbearable.

If he didn’t kill this person, their guild will lose all face.

At this time, as Xue Liantian’s words just fell, the men beside him were already attacking Lin Xiu with their weapons!

Lin Xiu directly used the Analytic Eye and found out that these people were all at the level of rank 9 warriors.

Only that Xue Liantian was a warrior at the master warrior level.

It seems that he had overestimated this ice and snow city a bit and the overall strength of the warriors in this city did not seem to be too strong.

But compared to Tianlong City, there should be more master warrior-level powerhouses.

Dang dang

Seeing those people attacking, Lin Xiu directly resisted with the long sword in his hand.

Because Lin Xiu had studied many weapons in the library of the Tower of Trials before, although it was not as powerful as using a spear, it was not weak at all.

When the long sword in his hand resisted the attacks of these people, he swung the long sword in his hand and all of a sudden, sword aura burst out, charging directly at these people!

These bursts of sword aura were very terrifying and there were swishing sounds in the air.

The expressions in the eyes of the warriors changed greatly. They did not continue to attack Lin Xiu, but directly dodged.

But when they dodged, Lin Xiu had already attacked with his sword!

One of the warriors looked at Lin Xiu who was attacking, roared and instantly unfolded a ‘Sphere’.

But Lin Xiu didn’t stop his offensive because he launched the “Sphere” and the long sword in his hand still slashed directly at it!

Boom–

The long sword slashed on his ‘Sphere’ and the powerful impact made his body retreat several steps.

Before he could regain his senses, the long sword in Lin Xiu’s hand continued to slash.

He didn’t stop the attack at all.

The speed of the long sword slashing was very fast, even if the man unfolded the ‘Sphere’, he couldn’t handle it.

The rest of the warriors have also reacted now and all attacked Lin Xiu.

Boom

But Lin Xiu seemed to have eyes on his back. He didn’t look back at this time and just waved his left hand and a huge lotus flame charged towards the back!

The flame was dark red and at the next moment, all the petals of the lotus blossomed out and turned into huge flames.

When those warriors saw this scene, they immediately felt the horror of the flames and they also subconsciously switched from attacking to defending, directly unfolding the ‘Sphere’ to resist the impact of the flames.

“That’s it?”

Xue Liantian’s face showed a strong killing intent and he held a large sword in his right hand, waiting for the flames that blocked his vision to disappear, he would rush over and directly kill the masked man!

At this moment, Huangji, who was at the back, frowned slightly, because he vaguely felt that the masked man seemed a little familiar.

“Hahaha, your sword is broken!”

Lin Xiu kept attacking a man’s “Sphere” with a long sword, but under this crazy offensive, the long sword actually broke!

Seeing that the long sword in Lin Xiu’s hand was broken, the man who unfolded the “Sphere” constantly to resist Lin Xiu’s domineering offensive couldn’t help laughing. The lesser weapons a warrior has, it would be losing an arm and and his strength would also drop a lot.

Except for those who specialize in boxing and use gloves as weapons.

But just when he was gloating, he saw a cold light strike.

A black spear pierced through his ‘Sphere’, then pierced through his head!

The man’s eyes widened, as if he didn’t know how he died.

The strength of these people was pretty good. If he just used the long sword, there was really no way to kill them so quickly.

While Lin Xiu felt a little pity and waved the spear in his hand again!

boom boom boom —

As Lin Xiu waved the spear in his hand, a large number of flaming birds burst out from the tip of the spear!

The temperature of these flaming birds was too high. The surrounding warriors who had just resisted the dark red lotus flames looked at these terrifying flames and their eyes were full of horror.

But now they can’t do anything about it. The speed at which the flaming birds are charging is too fast. They can only use the ‘Sphere’ to resist this terrifying flame.

The temperature of the flame is extremely high, even if there is a ‘Sphere’ to resist, they still feel like the whole body was burned by the flame and began sweating profusely.

Boom–

Before they could respond, Lin Xiu’s body charged over again and with a wave of his spear, the ‘Sphere’ of one of the warriors was blasted off.

Then he directly used ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’, that person was tied into a hornet’s nest in an instant.

The state of death looked extremely tragic.

When the rest of the people saw this scene, their eyes were full of fear.

Now they don’t have any courage to fight. After all, even the “Sphere” can be easily broken, how terrifying is this power?

Thinking of this, their bodies could not help trembling

“Spear!?”

Originally, Huangji felt that this masked man was a bit familiar and when used the weapon wrapped in black cloth on his back that turned out to be a long spear, he seemed to think of something and his face changed greatly.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
