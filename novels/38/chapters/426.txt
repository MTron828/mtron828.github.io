Chapter 427: The Unusual “Sphere”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but blurt out at this time.

Lin Xiu looked like Zhao Yun seen on those Computer Graphics posters. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

And as Lin Xiu wielded the Dark Edge spear, this image became clearer.

“Zhao Yun?” Luo Yue looked a little puzzled when she heard Lin Xiu’s words.

“A god of war in the ancient century.” Lin Xiu wasn’t surprised to see Luo Yue’s puzzled expression.

After all, this century had passed a long time ago. It was normal that she didn’t know this history.

“Very well, I like it very much, thank you.” Lin Xiu swung his Dark Edge spear and said to Luo Yue.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue, who had always been indifferent, seemed a little unnatural.

“I’m going to bed.” As if to maintain her cold appearance, Luo Yue said indifferently while walking upstairs.

“This girl.” Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but chuckle.

He swung the Dark Edge spear in his hand wildly and felt the strength of his body, surging more than ever before.

Power, power!

The whole body was full of power!

“‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!” Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear and stabbed the front – many spears were shot in an instant!

Moreover, Lin Xiu felt that this skill seemed to be smoother than before.

“Oh right, try ‘Sphere’ first.” Lin Xiu seemed to think of something at this moment, and then said to himself.

The iconic skill that a rank 6 warrior has was ‘Sphere’.

At this level, the source strength in the warrior’s body was already very full and the warrior could release a form of protective cover to protect his body.

It could be said that with the ‘Sphere’, most laser weapons were useless and cannot penetrate the ‘Sphere’ at all.

This was why all warriors used weapons instead of laser guns.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, and then, according to what he had seen in the book before, he concentrated the whole body’s energy and released the source strength.

Following Lin Xiu’s thoughts, a faint blue light quickly appeared on Lin Xiu’s body at the speed that the naked eye could see.

Soon, after about ten seconds, these light blue rays of light began to stay on Lin Xiu’s body, and quickly formed a Sphere, like a cover, surrounding Lin Xiu’s body.

“It’s so simple!” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise when he saw the “Sphere” he unfolded.

If it was an ordinary warrior, who has just reached the level of a rank 6 warrior, it would take half a month to adapt and do the training to unfold the ‘Sphere’.

But it seems that after Lin Xiu received special training from master Baili Haoling, his perception of his source strength seemed to be much deeper than that of ordinary warriors.

At this time, it was clear that the ‘Sphere’ was unfolded.

Moreover, Lin Xiu clearly felt that the source strength in his body was being rapidly consumed at this time.

It seemed that to maintain this state of using ‘Sphere’, it used up quite a lot of energy from the body.

“It’s not easy to master it thoroughly,” Lin Xiu thought to himself.

If you have thoroughly mastered it, the consumption of physical energy should be very small.

At this time, he looked at the ‘Sphere’ and Lin Xiu found that this thing seemed to have a layer of… lightning on top of the faint blue shield!?

Why would there be lightning?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu was stunned. He had seen a lot of warriors unfold the ‘Sphere’, but he had never seen lightning on it.

Lin Xiu was shocked.

“Wait, could it be… because of that skill he had learned before?”

Lin Xiu smacked his thigh and said aloud like he had a sudden realization.

Because in the past, he learned a skill that turned source strength into lightning and it covered his body like a lightning ball.

If this was the case, could the two be combined?

With this thought, Lin Xiu felt that his heart was beating fast.

At this moment, Lin Xiu took a deep breath. With his thoughts, there was a burst of ‘cracking’ sounds.

Taking a closer look, the light blue barrier has been covered with more lightning!

It was like a Sphere full of lightning, surrounding Lin Xiu’s body!

“Success!” Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help clenching his fists.

And the voltage of the lightning was very high because there was a slightly burnt smell in the air.

Lightning appearing with the ‘Sphere’ – ordinary warrior has no way to do this, right?

Even if they could turn their source strength into lightning, ordinary people couldn’t bear such a strong voltage.

“Is this considered my own unique skill?” Lin Xiu thought happily at this time.

But soon, Lin Xiu’s face became a little upset and the unfolded ‘Sphere’ and the lightning disappeared instantly.

“First time using ‘Sphere’ is still quite a burden on the body…” Lin Xiu sighed.

“Oh right, let me try that diamond skill card.” Lin Xiu crossed his legs on the ground and began the ‘cultivation technique’. After absorbing the source strength in the air and supplementing the loss of his body, he took out the diamond skill card and the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ that he hid in his room.

“Squeak!”

“Gu Gu!”

As Lin Xiu walked in, the little ice crystal white bird inside and Rollie seemed to be doing something on the table, and when they saw Lin Xiu coming over, they called out happily.

“What are you guys doing?” Lin Xiu was taken aback, and then asked.

Just when Lin Xiu spoke, he could clearly see that there were many odd crystals on his desk!!!

And these odd crystals come in various colors and were not low ranks. Lin Xiu could even see some rank 5 odd crystals!

“Damn, where did you guys get them!?”

“Did you guys rob someone?”

Lin Xiu said in shock.

Because the odd crystals that he gave to the little ice crystal white bird before should have been mostly eaten already and these colorful odd crystals were taken from the bodies of various evolved beasts.
