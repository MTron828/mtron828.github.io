“If that’s the case, you’re mistaken, I’m not the same as them!”

This sturdy body was like a small mountain, and the warrior known as the King of Power held his huge axe and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

His body looked very sturdy, but his speed was not slow at all. Ina short moment, he was about to rush in front of Lin Xiu!

‘The huge axe slashed at Lin Xiu’s body, making a sound that broker through the air.

Dang–

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in both hands. After directly blocking his blow with the body of the Dark Edge long spear, he pushed hard, and the powerful force made the King of Power retreat.

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers!

At this moment, Lin Xiuhui rushed over directly, and the moment the spear was pierced, it turned into hundreds!

‘The King of Power on the opposite side was dazzled by the attack and had to use a huge axe to block it.

‘The sharp spearhead stabbed on the axe, making a metal collision sound.

‘Taking a closer look, there were already slight dents on his axe, which were stabbed by the Dark Edge spear.

“That’s all you’ve got?”

The battle between Lin Xiu and King of Power continued, and at the same time, Baili Haoling was still at war with two other interstellar academy members. While fighting, she did not forget to taunt.

“Shut up!”

The two warriors of the Interstellar Academy who used long swords snorted coldly and continued to attack Baili Haoling with a fierce offensive.

But Baili Haoling’s body looked very flexible, and she easily resisted these attacks.

Dang dang-

While dodging, she attacked the two with a pair of knives.

One person against two people, she didn’t feel that she was struggling at all, on the contrary, she seemed to be able to fight with ease.

Swoosh—

Every time the long knife was slashed, there was a sound of breaking through the air, and at this time, there were many holes on the two warriors’ uniforms.

‘The skin on their bodies had a tingling sensation.

“Damn…”

Baili Haoling said lightly at this time.

At this time, the surrounding audience exclaimed and began to whisper.

“Impossible! Our Interstellar Academy would not do such a thing!”

This time, the person in charge of the Interstellar Academy heard Baili Haoling’s words, and immediately stood up from the rostrum and exclaimed.

“It’s not up to you to decide whether it’s true or not.”

“Wait for someone from our own organizing committee to investigate.”

When Bai Litao heard the man’s words, he sneered and said.

‘The man’s complexion suddenly became ugly, and he sat directly in the seat with a hint of panic in his eyes.

“Goodbye.”

At the same time, on the rooftop, Baili Haoling looked at the two men whose arms had been cut off by her, then holding long knives in both hands, she continued to attack!

“We admit…”

The eyes of the two men showed incomparable horror, but before they could say anything about admitting defeat, Baili Haoling killed them.

In an instant, there was a lot of blood on the ground, and the whole scene looked bloody.

‘Those viewers couldn’t help being shocked when they saw this scene. Baili Haoling looked like a cute little girl, but they didn’t expect that the attack would be so cruel, it was simply too terrifying.

“Humph! With your weapon, it’s impossible to do any harm to me!”

At the same time, Lin Xiu was still fighting fiercely with King of Power.

The movements of the two were very fast, and under the frantic attacks, there was actually back and forth, and it seemed that there was no winner or loser. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

And Baili Haoling looked at the scene, and didn’t seem to intend to help.

“Chloe Water, I didn’t expect that you guys would use such a method.”

Lin Xiu said coldly while fighting with him.

“What a joke, this is just a method used by those rubbish warriors, I don’t use this method!”

King of Power roared loudly, and the axe and tomahawk he held in both hands slammed wildly.

“Lion Fight!!!”
