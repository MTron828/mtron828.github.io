Chapter 831: The Everlasting Aftermath

After hearing what Chen Dong was saying, the look in his eyes changed. Lin Xiu grabbed onto his collar and said in a panic tone.

“I’m sorry. I was being irrational.”

Lin Xiu quickly let go of Chen Dong’s collar and apologised.

“It’s alright.”

Chen Dong let out a breath of relief.

“How did you know the skills that she used?”

Lin Xiu asked in a cold tone.

“To be honest, I had a friend who was from the Luo family as well and I know a thing or two about the situation of that family.”

“Did she use the secret skill of the Luo family ‘Sacrifice’?”

Chen Dong’s face turned solemn and lowered his voice as he asked Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s had a slight change of expression.

After seeing the look on his face, Chen Dong was sure that his assumption was right.

“My friend and I were caught in a situation where we faced a horrible evolved beast. Both his eyes had been paralysed from being injured and in the end, he had no other choice but to do so. He transferred all the energy in his body into mine and the both of us made it out alive.

“From then, he was asleep in the hospital for the entire year.

“Plus, he told me himself that the after effects of it were severe. Once every two days, he would fall into a deep sleep.”

Chen Dong sighed.

“I noticed your girlfriend’s condition and it was similar to my friend’s.”

Lin Xiu’s heart sank as well after hearing what was said.

His heart ached as well.

This was all because of him.

“Your friend….what happened to him?”

Lin Xiu paused for a moment before asking.

“He left the world.”

Chen Dong seemed to be reminiscing about his friend as he said in a sad tone.

“Because of the fight in the Luo family, he became a sacrificial lamb.”

Chen Dong mocked as he gave a cold laugh.

“Such a stupid man.”

As he was reminded of his friend, Chen Dong was reminded of the days and his eyes turned red.

“Do you know when the after effects would disappear?”

Lin Xiu asked something that he wanted to know the most.

“I’m not sure.”

Chen Dong shook his head.

“My friend….went across the world hoping to find someone to cure it but no one was able to help him.”

“This skill…. Was considered a forbidden skill. Those who used it would suffer deadly consequences.”

“I guess that’s it.”

Lin Xiu said flatly.

Boom – –

Then, he immediately closed the door.

“This...”

Chen Dong was slapped on the face by Lin Xiu’s door and he didn’t know if he should have laughed or not.

He shook his head and left.

“Huuuuuuu….”

Lin Xiu supported himself from the wall with his left hand as he rubbed his temples with his right.

If what Chen Dong said was true, it would be a little problematic.

Luo Yue had completely recovered earlier but now this was something that would never disappear.

He took a deep breath and walked towards the bed. He stared at Luo Yue who was sleeping and there was a gentle look in his eyes. He mumbled to himself and said, “No matter what, I will still be by your side.”

Time passed by quickly and Luo Yu finally woke up after sleeping for an entire day.

It was indeed like how Chen Dong had described it to be.

“You’re awake? Quick, I’ll bring you some food.”

Lin Xiu was sitting in a chair nearby and when he saw Luo Yue who just woke up, he smiled and greeted her.

However, Luo Yue looked a little down. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Her head hung low as if she was occupied.

“What’s wrong? Are you alright?”

Lin Xiu walked to her and placed his palm on her forehead before asking, “Do you have a fever?”

“Was I asleep for an entire day?”

Luo Yue suddenly asked.

After hearing what Luo Yue asked, Lin Xiu was stunned.

“I know that ….this is the aftermath of using that skill.”

Luo Yue looked up and said to Lin Xiu.

“I know.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head as well. Then, he slowly brushed her hair as they looked a little messy.

“Then...”

“You don’t have to say anything. I will be by your side.”

“Plus, the world is huge. Maybe we may be able to find another cure on another planet. Won’t we?”

Lin Xiu laughed.

In times like these, if he lost confidence, Luo Yue would lose confidence as well.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was smiling, Luo Yue was shocked.

“En.”

They were looking into each other’s eyes and there was a flirtatious mood in the air.

Boom boom boom – –

Just as the both of them were getting close, there was a loud knock at the door.

Luo Yue was blushing as she pushed Lin Xiu away.

“Who is it?”

Lin Xiu was boiling mad. He felt that he was extremely close to that kiss!

But….someone knocked at the door!

“Who is it?!”

Lin Xiu asked in frustration as he opened the door.

“Brother Lin, we found an island outside!”

A man stood in front of his door and exclaimed.

After the fight with the octopu the other night, everyone was aware that Lin Xiu was extremely powerful.

Most of their attitudes towards Lin Xiu had changed.

“Island? What Island?”

Lin Xiu frowned.

“It’s just….magnificent. You have to take a look at it.”

“Leader Chen called for you as well.”

The man was extremely anxious.

“Alright. I’ll come soon.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

Soon, Luo Yue and Lin Xiu headed to the deck.

After the storm that night, the sky was still cloudy after an entire day.

For the past two days, the weather has not been the best.

“Oh? Lin Xiu? You’re here?”

When Chen Dong saw that it was Lin Xiu, he greeted him with a smile.

“What’s wrong?”

Lin Xiu looked around and noticed that all the staff and warriors were on the deck. They were looking at something in the distance.

“Look over there.”

Chen Dong pointed in a direction where everyone was looking.

Most warriors have very good eyesight. As they turned towards that direction, they noticed that there was a huge island right in front of them.

Luo Yue, who was standing next to Lin Xiu, turned as well and she was surprised.

“According to the map, there shouldn’t be an island here.”

Luo Yue was looking around before she commented.

“That’s right!”

Chen Dong gave an approving look.

“I just checked the most updated map and even the satellite did not catch this island.”

Chen Dong explained.

“A few days ago, there were storms here but I can’t help but feel that the water level in the Black River was much lower than before.”

“This island….did it appear because the water level got lower?”

Another warrior asked when he heard what Chen Dong said.

“It’s possible.”

Chen Dong nodded his head.

Koong Loong – –

At that moment, there was lightning that appeared all over the sky.

It looked like there would be another thunderstorm coming.

“Previously, this is where the ghost ship would appear. Maybe…..we might be able to find something...”
