1151 Lingxian City

“Have.”

Lin Xiu nodded and took out the phone from his expansion space.

In the phone, there is a photo of Luo Yue.

At this time, Mr. Pang waved his right hand and a machine next to him flew over and scanned the photo of Luo Yue on Lin Xiu’s mobile phone.

Di di di-

In the next moment, a strange sound could be clearly heard.

The flying machine immediately projected a huge screen.

There is a lot of information flashing on the screen.

It seems that the machine is running frantically, searching for something.

“There is no such person.”

But at the next moment, under Lin Xiu’s expectant eyes, this scene appeared.

“Can’t be found?”

Lin Xiu was startled, then said subconsciously.

“If she arrives here as a god warrior, there will definitely be information.”

“But if you come to the God warrior Realm by other illegal methods, there will be no registration information here.”

“So I can’t find it.”

Mr. Pang shook his head and said.

“If you want to find her, I think there is only little hope.”

The God warrior Realm is so large, it is indeed very difficult to find someone in the vast sea of ??people.

“Okay, I’ll take you to Lingxian City now. After three years, you’ll get an identity token. At that time, you can enter and leave any city at will.”

At this time, Mr. Pang said aloud and waved his right hand.

In the area ahead, a teleportation array suddenly appeared.

“Go.”

“Also, at this time, the city lord ordered that someone over there will pick you up.”

At this time, the old man threw a token to Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“En.”

Lin Xiu hesitated for a while, then took the token.

In the next moment, he walked straight ahead.

Walked into the teleportation array.

With the teleportation array running, at the next moment, a dazzling light burst out from it.

Lin Xiu’s figure instantly disappeared in place.

When Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, he realized that he was now on the other side.

In front of him was a city that didn’t seem to be big.

In front of this city gate, there were two huge statues of warriors, but they seem to have become a bit worn out due to the passage of time.

There are two guards at the gate of the city, one on the left and one on the right.

There are a lot of warriors, coming and going back and forth at this time.

Above the city gate, there were two words: ‘Lingxian City’.

But there were slight cracks in the words.

Lin Xiu walked straight ahead at this time.

“Stop!”

The guards walking at the gate of the city saw Lin Xiu approaching and immediately stopped Lin Xiu.

“Show your ID token.”

The two stared at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

“Is this the one?”

At this time, Lin Xiu took out a special token and said lightly.

When the two of them saw the token in Lin Xiu’s hand, their expressions changed slightly.

“City...City Lord!?”

On this day, the people of Lingxian City felt very surprised, because after three years, they finally welcomed a new city lord.

“Hello, City Lord, my surname is Pang. You can call me Mr. Pang. I was the one who took care of the affairs of the City Lord’s mansion in Lingxian City.”

At this time, under the leadership of a warrior, Lin Xiu had already arrived at the City Lord’s mansion.

This City Lord’s mansion looks like it hasn’t been lived in for a long time. Although it has been cleaned spotlessly, the surrounding equipment and so on are all very old.

This Pang Sa is a middle-aged man, who should be the housekeeper arranged by the City Lord’s mansion.

“Your name is Mr. Pang too?”

Lin Xiu said with a strange expression.

The name of this person and that of the receptionist was the same, which Lin Xiu found a little strange.

“Am I going to live here in the future?”

Lin Xiu walked into the city lord’s mansion for a while and after getting acquainted with it, he said lightly.

“Well, this is your residence, City Lord.”

Mr. Pang smiled and nodded.

“If you have any questions, just ask me.”

Mr. Pang’s speech was a little sloppy.

“Well, okay, then I’ll take a break first.”

Lin Xiu nodded.

“Okay, then I’ll leave first. If you have anything, call me directly through the contactor.”

While speaking aloud, Mr. Pang left.

“Is this the so-called City Lord’s Mansion...”

At this time, Lin Xiu looked around, then shook his head helplessly.

This so-called City Lord’s Mansion is far more rubbish than the City Lord’s Mansion when he was on the Namir planet.

Everything around looked very shabby.

However, Lin Xiu didn’t think much about it at this time and went straight back to the master bedroom.

It is impossible to work here for three years. He has to find Luo Yue’s location as soon as possible, then give Luo Yue the Orchid of Heaven.

To treat the sequelae that Luo Yue suffered previously.

He just came to the God warrior Realm and didn’t know many things.

The most important thing right now is to quickly understand the realm of the God warriors.

“By the way, it seems like I got something before...”

Sitting cross-legged on the ground at this time, Lin Xiu suddenly thought that when he upgraded himself, the system rewarded him with some items.

He didn’t look closely at the time, but now that he thought about it, Lin Xiu directly entered the expansion space.

“Divine remolding pill...”

Lin Xiu took out a bottle from the expansion space.

At this time, he saw the introduction of this bottle.

This is a bottle of elixir that can transform one’s own body into a real body of God.

very powerful.

Opening it up, there was only one inside.

Lin Xiu found it a pity.

Otherwise, he could leave one for Luo Yue.

Also, the expansion space has become much larger than before.

There was also a set of God warrior suits presented by the system.

This God warrior suit is a set of clothes and shoes.

Lin Xiu read the introduction of this suit.

“It’s made of special materials, it doesn’t feel the slightest weight and has powerful defence.”

This God warrior suit is all white and feels very comfortable to touch.

Lin Xiu put the suit aside and looked at the pill, Lin Xiu directly took it out of the bottle.

This pale golden pill was lying in his hand and a fragrant smell came over immediately.

It smells good. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and in the next moment, he swallowed the pill.

This pill for washing the marrow is very strange and it melted directly as soon as you entered it.

Soon, a cold feeling spread to Lin Xiu’s body, making Lin Xiu feel very comfortable.

But this feeling of comfort didn’t last for a while, then it started to get hot.

“Damn it!”

This burning sensation became more and more intense, causing Lin Xiu’s eyes to widen.
