Chapter 864: Warrior Union Headquarters (1)

“Your strength has improved, and it’s too terrifying.”

Ouyang Hang said aloud at this time.

“The people from the Warrior Union are probably going to come again.”

Now most of the top management of the Warrior Union has changed and they are all people from other countries.

Bai Litao said aloud at this time.

“Don’t worry, they won’t dare to come again.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

“The execution force of our Warrior Union was hit hard in the Huaxia region.”

Soon, the news here also spread to the Warrior Union headquarters in the United States.

A middle-aged man with blond hair and blue eyes called out Lin Xiu’s information at this time, and then spoke to everyone present.

“This man killed some members of the Huaxia family before, so he was wanted. Now I don’t know when he will come back.”

“It doesn’t matter if Jiang Qian died, but our country’s warriors also died there. We can’t let go of this matter so easily.”

The man said coldly at this time.

He is the current general leader of the World warrior Union. When such a thing happened, it was a slap in the face.

The current warrior Union is not the same as it used to be, it is a super large force group.

“En, I think we should destroy sky city in Huaxia.”

The other man in the seat said lightly at this time.

“Just throw a nuclear bomb over there.”

“Wall, this will be condemned by the federal government.”

The other man frowned slightly and said.

There are many weapons that can destroy a city now, but if those weapons are really used, the whole world may be directly destroyed.

“What are you afraid of? Does anyone still dare to stop our federal government from doing things?”

The man called Wall sneered at this moment.

“Well, it does make sense.”

Huaxia people have many powerful warriors in recent years, it’s time to teach them a lesson.

The other men also nodded at this time.

The general leader of the Warrior Union thought for a while, then showed a strange smile and said, “Alright, it’s time to let them know the strength of our Warrior Union...”

“Just this bit of strength?”

At this moment, a voice came from here.

Who is it!?

Hearing this voice, the complexion of the people sitting at this round table changed slightly.

All eyes turned to the left, and he could clearly see a Chinese man, leaning on the door over there, playing with a knife.

This person is Lin Xiu.

The next day, Lin Xiu arrived here.

With Lin Xiu’s current strength, it was an easy task to come up here without knowing it.

“Who are you?”

These people were also surprised when they saw Lin Xiu.

One of the men said subconsciously.

“What? You were talking about me just now, but you don’t recognize me?”

Lin Xiu was playing with a small knife, and then said lightly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, these talents reacted.

Lin Xiu, who appeared here at this time, was exactly the same as the picture of the Chinese man displayed on the screen!

“You still dare to show up here.”

The general leader of the Warrior Union stared at Lin Xiu at this time, and then said lightly.

Although he looked calm on the surface, he was still a little shocked inside.

Because this is the headquarters of the Warrior Union, Lin Xiu, a man, sneaked in here without anyone knowing. Just this alone was enough to show that his strength must be extremely powerful.
