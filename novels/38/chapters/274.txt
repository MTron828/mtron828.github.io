Chapter 275: Fighting A Rank 6 Evolved Beast Alone (I)

Damn it!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened when he saw this scene.

What the hell is this? It could even absorb his flames and turn them into its weapon.

This was the first time Lin Xiu had seen this kind of evolved beast.

The dark and weird trees around had already rooted and fled. The ground around seemed barren as if it was the wilderness.

The lighting equipment was scattered on the ground but it still provided some light.

Boom——

At this moment, the noise became louder and louder and the flames that were absorbed and spat out by the Black Rock Giant Beast were rushing towards Lin Xiu and the others.

The flames turned out to be even more terrifying after the beast had absorbed and spat them out.

Lin Xiu and the rest quickly dodged.

The flames filled the sky and the surrounding air seemed to be distorted by the high temperature.

Lin Xiu was hit by some flames but he didn’t feel much pain.

After all, he was the one who released these flames and his body already had resistance to them.

“What kind of evolved beast is this…”

Guo Ling’s gaze also changed. Before he had time to dodge the flames, he unfolded the ‘sphere’ directly and blocked all the flames.

But even though the ‘Sphere’ blocked the flames, Guo Ling could still feel the scorching heat around his body.

He felt as if he was getting cooked.

It was very uncomfortable.

Roar–

The Giant Black Rock Beast was clawing frantically at this moment as it rushed towards Lin Xiu.

Its body was huge and when Lin Xiu saw this, his gaze changed suddenly. Without any fear, he held the Dark Edge spear and rushed forward directly.

Bang–

The Giant Black Rock Beast rushed towards Lin Xiu and waved its claws like he was going to smash Lin Xiu into a pulp of meat!

As his claws slapped down, the whole ground shook again.

Lin Xiu’s movements were very fast. At this moment, he jumped directly onto the claw and used it as a springboard. At the next moment, he leaped up again!

He jumped directly onto the head of the Giant Black Rock Beast and saw the Giant Black Rock Beast’s black eyes clearly.

Its eyes were like black pearls and they looked very strange.

It was not easy to attack other parts of its body and he could only attack its head and its eyes right now!

Swish—— UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Lin Xiu’s spear slammed vigorously and when he was about to pierce its eyes, a flame burst out from the spear tip and directly attacked his eyes.

Roar–

The Black Rock Giant opened its mouth and let out a howl. Lin Xiu’s flame seemed to be absorbed by its weird ability again and converged on the other side of its mouth.

Lin Xiu, who was suspended in the air, frowned at this moment; the ability of this rank 6 evolved beast was really weird.

It seems that his Red Lotus Fire wasn’t very effective in dealing with this darn thing.

Bang bang bang——

Those flames that were absorbed turned into a ball of flames that continuously sprayed out from its mouth.

Although Lin Xiu was in the air now, he twisted his body slightly and managed to dodge.

In the next moment, it pierced its eyes directly with his Dark Edge spear!

Bang——

But at this moment, something strange happened. A large amount of rubble broke out of its back that was like a small mountain.

Then rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Swish swish swish——

Those black rubble that looked like small rocks rushed towards Lin Xiu at a crazy speed.

They moved very quickly, even more terrifying than bullets.

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened, but he was in the air and had no chance of dodging them!

Bang bang bang——

These things were like bullets. At this moment, they penetrated Lin Xiu’s body directly!

A dull sound kept resounding. At this moment, Lin Xiu had already turned into a sieve from all the hits.

Qiu Li and the others, who originally wanted to attack the Giant Black Rock Beast, widened their eyes. They never thought that this Giant Black Rock Beast that was only rank 6 would be so powerful.

What surprised them even more was that Lin Xiu was actually attacked so severely and his body was full of holes.

“Hurry up, go and kill it!”

Guo Ling called out calmly at this time.

“But this…” Chen Jin, who was next to Guo Ling, seemed a little hesitant when he heard Guo Ling’s words.

After all, Lin Xiu was killed over there!

“Don’t you get it? He is not dead.” Guo Ling looked at the Giant Black Rock Beast and rushed over.

Not dead!?

After hearing what Guo Ling said, these people were all startled and suddenly came to a realization.

Lin Xiu must have used that skill!

Bang–

At this moment, the black rocks emitted from the Giant Black Rock Beast’s back penetrated into the sieve-like ‘Lin Xiu’ in the air and exploded like a smoke bomb.

“”Go to hell!

The real Lin Xiu appeared above the Giant Black Rock Beast with the Dark Edge spear in his hand as he swooped down and attacked directly!

Lin Xiu didn’t intend to use ‘Mirror Image’ initially, after all, this skill had a cool down time.

After using it, he could only use it again after 12 hours.

This Giant Black Rock Beast was obviously fooled by Lin Xiu’s fake. At this time, the sharp tip of Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear had already pierced through the Giant Black Rock Beast’s huge black eyes!

Boom–

Like bursting a bubble, a crisp sound rang out and its black eyes burst!

Its blood mixed with some black liquid splattered in the air in an instant.

Roar–

After Lin Xiu pierced one of his eyes, the Giant Black Rock Beast suddenly became furious. Its mouth which was densely packed teeth opened wide at this time and it roared ferociously.

It was about to bite Lin Xiu and its claws almost tore Lin Xiu’s body in half.

In the twinkling of an eye, just after Lin Xiu pierced its eye, his body suddenly flipped forward and he jumped onto its head.

At this time, its claws slapped on its own head!

Lin Xiu’s mental power was very concentrated; his body reacted quickly as he dodged and jumped to the ground.
