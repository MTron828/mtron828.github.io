Chapter 168: Level 20!

Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Lin Xiu was still training in the gravity room at this time.

When the classmates were adapting to triple gravity, Lin Xiu had already started training for the five-fold gravity.

Lin Xiu used the ‘Cultivation Technique’ to absorb the energy of the Odd Crystal while adapting to the five-fold gravity.

At this moment, Lin Xiu was already able to perform activities under five-fold gravity, but it was still impossible to fully exert his original power under that amount of gravity.

“Over here!” Lin Xiu has activated the laser ray avoidance training at this time.

These laser rays seemed to attack everywhere from the ceiling.

Lin Xiu was dodging frantically.

While dodging, an expressionless face surfaced in Lin Xiu’s mind.

‘Why didn’t Luo Yue come… today?’

He had been practicing with Luo Yue recently, but Luo Yue did not show up in the afternoon that day which made Lin Xiu feel a sense of emptiness.

He hasn’t fallen for that chick, has he?

With that thought, Luo Yue’s cold face suddenly appeared.

“Damn!” When Lin Xiu cursed, he was accidentally hit by a laser beam.

A hole appeared in his clothes in an instant and a strong burning sensation made Lin Xiu grimace in pain.

Although his physical strength was already very strong now, it still hurts to be hit by this kind of laser beam. There was probably a little blood in the spot where he was shot.

This made him very alert as he dodged frantically until the set time was up.

After the training, Lin Xiu took out the rank 7 Odd Crystal that Luo Yue gave him.

At this time, there was still a lot of energy in this Odd Crystal. After so many days, there was still so much!

Lin Xiu sat down cross-legged and instinctively used the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

Not long after, a clear “ding” rang out!

“Congratulations Master for leveling up to level 20. You’ve gained 20 potential points!”

“Congratulations Master for acquiring the new skill ‘Engulf’!”

“Congratulations Master for winning a chance to draw a prize!”

“Congratulations Master for successfully advancing to a rank 4 warrior!”

“Congratulations Master…”

At this time, one after another system prompt sounded, which surprised Lin Xiu.

Level 20! Finally level 20!

He had been absorbing the energy of Odd crystals these days and the experience bar has risen so quickly that he didn’t expect to finally hit 100 million that day!

Without much thought, Lin Xiu directly looked at his stats board.

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: Level 20

Experience Points: 0/2 Billion

Strength: 400

Physique: 158

Speed: 101

Skill: “Analytic Eye’, ‘Fury’, ‘Disguise’, ‘Engulf’

Rage build-up: 0/100

Potential points: 20

Title: Rank 2 warrior (Unused title: Rank 1 warrior, Rank 3 warrior, Rank 4 warrior)

Combat strength: 4,520

More than 4,000 combat strength!

And with his training during this period of time, his attribute points had also increased a lot.

Lin Xiu didn’t think much and directly added these 20 potential points to his physique.

As soon as he finished adding the attribute points, Lin Xiu felt relief in his body for a while and in the next moment, the five-fold gravity seemed to have a much weaker effect on him.

Lin Xiu clicked on the ‘Engulf’ skill and could see the effect of this skill.

‘Engulf’: Absorb all the energy and transform it into experience.

The short introduction made Lin Xiu’s a little puzzled.

‘This skill looks a bit useless ah…’

‘Regardless, let’s see how the new title is.’

Rank 4 warrior (Increase Physique attribute by 50)

Seeing this, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted – an increase of 50 points!

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu directly replaced the original Tier 2 warrior title with the title of Tier 4 warrior.

At this moment, the strength attribute points were instantly reduced by a dozen points, and the physique attribute has increased to 228!

At this moment, the load on his body has decreased a lot.

The promotion to Rank 4 warrior was simply drastic for Lin Xiu! There was no need to be afraid of tomorrow’s freshman assembly.

With that thought, Lin Xiu couldn’t help clenching his fists.

He immediately looked over to his attributes and the rank 2 gene lock required one to be level 25 in order to unlock, which was five levels away.

Lin Xiu was rewarded with two lottery chances, but he didn’t want to use them now and decided to wait for more.

‘Awe of the phoenix’ skill had been promoted to a Gold skill and he had already learned it.

‘Adjudicate’ – this weapon was not particularly useful now while ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ and ‘Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall’ were still pretty good.

But his fist techniques and footwork really couldn’t keep up with his cultivation speed.

He had to exchange for a few gold skills to train his fist techniques or footwork.

And he could also see if there were any strong spear arts skill over there.

As the freshmen assembly was the next day, most people chose to have a good rest and get ready.

When Lin Xiu left the training room and headed to the exchange center, he suddenly saw that there was a lot of people on the road over there.

The school uniforms for the freshmen had been distributed and Lin Xiu easily recognized that all of them were freshmen.

“Zhao Huang, what is the meaning of this!” Li Ping and several guys from Class 10 had their white clothes dirtied.

Also, there were a lot of bruises on their faces and blood seeping out of the corners of their mouths.

“Nothing much, just want to tell you that from today on, you people from Class 10 can’t take this path.” The man called Zhao Huang said with a sneer.

Several people beside him laughed.

The guys from other classes around also watched this scene like it was an entertaining drama.

“This path doesn’t belong to you, why can’t we walk here!” Li Ping clenched his fists and stared at him.

While talking, he wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth.

They wanted to go to the exchange center that day but didn’t expect to be stopped by these people halfway and got beaten violently.

This path was the only one that led to the exchange center. If they couldn’t take this path, how were they going to get to the exchange center?

There were warriors’ necessities there.

“Or, if you walk under my crotch, I’ll let you walk this way in the future.” Zhao Huang stepped forward, then spread his legs and laughed at Li Ping.

Hearing his words, everyone around him also laughed.

Bullying others to the extreme!!!

Li Ping and the others clenched their fists tightly, but they were completely unable to fight them.

There was a huge difference in strength!
