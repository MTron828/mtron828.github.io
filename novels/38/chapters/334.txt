Chapter 335: The Two Injured

Bang-

Following the loud bang, the sword cut straight through Zhang Jie’s head and sliced it right off!

Zhang Jie’s fervent struggle immediately became weak.

Lin Xiu witnessed Zhang Jie’s head being sliced off by Luo Yue’s sword and heaved a sigh of relief.

One could still see flickers of lightning across Zhang Jie’s neck.

Bang-

Lin Xiu released Zhang Jie’s hand and kicked the corpse away.

As her body was being flung, her arm that was stabbed into Lin Xiu’s body was removed as well.

But the immense pain caused his face to crunch up.

“Is she dead?” Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief and endured the pain as he walked over to Luo Yue.

Luo Yue looked at Zhang Jie’s head and replied, “She’s dead.”

Zhang Jie’s eyes were still wide open as though unresigned to her death. Her chopped neck had no blood and revealed machinery.

They could tell that apart from her head, she was a cyborg.

“Cough cough.” Luo Yue’s complexion turned pale as she coughed and stabbed her sword into the ground to support herself.

Her vision started to blur.

Her body started to tremble as well.

“Luo Yue!?” She saw Lin Xiu’s blurred figure appear in front of her, but in the next moment, her eyes rolled backwards and she fainted.

Lin Xiu immediately reached out to grab her. He endured the pain in his body and carried her.

Blood continued to flow from her body.

Evidently, Luo Yue’s shoulder was cut by Zhang Jie’s blade and lost a lot of blood. The overexertion was another factor that led to her fainting.

Lin Xiu carried Luo Yue back to their original position and laid her down gently on the grass.

He then walked over to his bag and took out a blue bottle.

“I’m healed?” The part of his shoulder that Zhang Jie had stabbed through with her arm had started to heal, and the blood had gradually dried up.

Although he could still feel the pain, blood no longer flowed and Lin Xiu felt that it no longer hindered him.

It might be due to his second Gene Lock that strengthened his body to a level far unlike anyone.

Lin Xiu took the blue liquid and returned to Luo Yue.

Blood continued to flow from her body.

Lin Xiu frowned at this, her wounds were obviously still open and fresh blood was still coming out.

This was extremely dangerous for her.

‘We should return quickly and get to the hospital for treatment.’

But they were a long way away from the town.

Without a choice, he could only use the medicinal liquid to heal her.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and tore her battle robes slightly. The layer of inner white robes was dyed blood red.

He continued to tear along her wounds and saw a deep wound.

Blood was incessantly flowing out, and it caused his expression to change.

The wound seemed to have enlarged after Luo Yue’s attack.

The wound laid her muscle tissues bare open.

Lin Xiu was unable to comprehend what level of willpower Luo Yue had to endure the pain and continue fighting.

It was fortunate that Zhang Jie had died.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and carefully placed the blue liquid on Luo Yue’s wound.

The medicine produced effects as white bubbles started to foam, and a hissing sound rang out.

Luo Yue frowned as it was a very painful process.

Very quickly, Lin Xiu applied the medicine all over Luo Yue’s wound. The blood on the wounds were cleansed away.

The horrific-looking wound quickly started healing.

“Whew.” Lin Xiu wiped away the perspiration on his forehead and took a deep breath.

Lin Xiu felt extremely fatigued and his vision was slightly blurry. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Gugu?” Rollie rolled out and saw Lin Xiu in a strange state.

“Rollie, quickly find me some odd crystals.” Lin Xiu looked at Rollie and laughed. He closed his eyes and activated his cultivation technique.

As it circulated in his body, the energy in the area around him started to converge and got absorbed into his body.

He gained back his energy and recovered quickly from the fatigue.

After cultivating for a period of time, he opened his eyes and looked around.

He was injured and Luo Yue was still resting. It was a bad situation for them if any warriors came with bad intentions.

Time passed as Lin Xiu remained guarded by Luo Yue’s side. After a long time, Luo Yue frowned slightly and her eyelids started to flutter slightly.

“Luo Yue?” Lin Xiu whispered when he saw her slight movements.
