1227 Sha Qiang and Sha Li

“Seems to have some strength huh.”

Sha Qiang also said with a sneer at this time.

“Where are you from?”

Lin Xiu looked down, looked at their figures and said.

“Why, you killed my brother Sha Li and you still don’t know where we come from?”

Sha Li showed a weird smile.

Shachang City?

Lin Xiu raised his brows. He didn’t expect the people from Shachang City to come first.

“Get… down!”

At this moment, Sha Li spoke coldly to Lin Xiu in the sky.

With the triggering of his thoughts, a space crack opened directly on Lin Xiu’s side!

A black giant hand came out of the space crack instantly.

Grabbing Lin Xiu’s body!

swoosh—

But just when the huge black hand was about to grab Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared.

The pupils in Sha Li’s eyes shrank slightly, and the figure stepped back directly at this time.

boom–

And Lin Xiu’s figure also appeared on the side where Sha Li was just now, and he punched out, but because Sha Li dodged in advance, he directly hit the air.

Beautiful responsiveness!

At this time, Lin Xiu had to admit that Sha Li’s reaction ability was indeed very fast.

“go!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

At the same time, Sha Qiang’s source strength has exploded.

His source strength was the same as that of Sha Li at the beginning, it can be materialized to gravel.

This grit-like source strength formed a slender spike at this time and stabbed directly towards Lin Xiu.

“Humph!”

Seeing this scene out of the corner of his eyes, Lin Xiu snorted coldly and the fist of his right hand slammed into it.

Boom—

The spikes formed by the gravel-like source strength instantly collided with Lin Xiu’s fist and a loud sound erupted.

The spike broke and scattered on the ground.

“kill!!!”

The other warriors in Shachang City have now surrounded Lin Xiu and were attacking Lin Xiu!

Among these warriors from Shachang city, there were many warriors at the level of god warrior.

The lineup can be said to be really strong.

Lin Xiu looked at the warriors attacking from all directions, without the slightest fear.

‘Sphere’ unfolded directly.

bang bang bang-

At this time, all the skill powers were blocked.

“It’s my turn.”

At this time, Lin Xiu waved his right hand and his mind was triggered and the Dark Edge spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

“go!”

Lin Xiu said coldly.

As the spear drew an arc, an incomparably huge force rushed out in an instant.

Those warriors who came over were affected by this incomparably powerful force and flew out directly!

The ‘Sphere’ unfolded on their bodies was directly blown off by Lin Xiu’s spear!

pfft—

Those warriors who flew out tried their best to stabilize their bodies, but they still vomited out a mouthful of blood.

At this moment, their eyes were full of shock and horror.

They never thought that Lin Xiu’s strength would be so powerful!

And at this time, Lin Xiu disappeared again.

Appeared in front of one of the God warrior-level warriors!

The Dark Edge spear in his hand stabbed out!

The look in the warrior’s eyes changed greatly, holding the weapon in his hand to resist Lin Xiu’s attack.

Dang–

Under the collision between the spear’s head and his weapon, an extremely loud sound suddenly erupted.

The terrifying power that came from made him unable to hold his weapon.

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!

And at this time, Lin Xiu directly used his skill power.

Dangdang-

He was already struggling to grip his weapon firmly against Lin Xiu’s blow just now and after resisting several attacks in a row, the weapon in his hand went straight out of his hand.

But Lin Xiu still didn’t stop attacking, the spear continued to stab out.

The speed at which the spear was moving was too fast. Although this man was a warrior of the God warrior level, there was no way to dodge it!

boom–

The spear charged out, directly piercing his ‘Sphere’.

He stabbed a hole in his head!

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for killing the God warrior-level warrior! Gain experience…”

Lin Xiu looked at his increase in experience and was immediately speechless.

Not even 1%!

Just as Lin Xiu was looking at the experience bar, a warrior appeared behind Lin Xiu, holding a weapon in his hand and wanted to cut Lin Xiu in half!

Dang–

However, Lin Xiu seemed to have eyes on his back and the Dark Edge spear in his hand directly blocked the attack, colliding with his weapon.

“Get lost.”

Boom—

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, a dark blue flame suddenly erupted from the body of the Dark Edge spear.

At this time, these dark blue flames spread directly to his weapon.

“what!!!”

Holding the weapon, he suddenly felt as if his palms were about to be melted.

blood dripped down.

In the next moment, the dark blue flame continued to spread towards his body and his whole person turned into a burning man!

swoosh—

Lin Xiu continued to use the ‘Flashing Souls’ movement technique and kept appearing in front of these warriors.

With the long spear in his hand, he directly killed those warriors.

The warriors who came from Shachang City kept falling to the ground.

“The city lord… is too strong!”

Some warriors from Lingxian City also came out at this time.

Looking at this scene in the distance, they all showed extremely shocked expressions.

Some warriors have only heard of the legend of the new city lord, but they have never seen Lin Xiu’s battle.

At this time, watching Lin Xiu kill those warriors in Shachang City like he was mowing the grass and their eyes widened.

“Damn!!!”

At this moment, Sha Qiang’s eyes became red.

He brought so many warriors and before they even entered the city, they were almost all killed by Lin Xiu!

“interesting…”

At this time, Sha Li had a very interested look on his face.

It seemed that he didn’t show any anger at all when Lin Xiu killed these warriors. Instead he became more interested in Lin Xiu.

“Do it!!!”

At this time, Sha Qiang couldn’t help looking at this one-sided situation.

“What’s the hurry, let him clean up the garbage first, then we’ll kill him.”

Sha Li licked his lips, revealing a hint of madness.

“Sha Li! These warriors are the elite troops that my father asked us to bring! When we go back, see how you can explain it to him!!!”

When Sha Qiang heard Sha Li’s words, he was furious.

“Explain? Taking this guy’s head back is the best explanation, isn’t it?”

Sha Li pointed to Lin Xiu in the distance and said lightly.
