Chapter 189: Continue To Fight

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 6 Blue-winged beetle. You’ve gained 10 million experience!”

Lin Xiu was out of breath and was startled when he heard the system prompt.

It actually has 10 million experience points!?

Over one million more experience than killing a rank 6 Green Vine beast!

But 10 million experience points were still too little. It now takes 300 million experience for him to level up!

At this moment, Lin Xiu came back to his senses and thought about the skill he had just released. It was clear that it was the Red Lotus Fire that he had just engulfed and he released a flame that was just as powerful as the Red Lotus Fire through the majestic source strength.

But if that was true, it also consumes a lot of physical strength and source strength. Just after releasing it, Lin Xiu felt as if his body had been emptied.

Bang bang bang—— ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

At the same time, Lin Xiu heard a weird sound, and it sounded like it was from the Blue-winged beetle that was torn apart.

“Damn! So many small bugs!” Li Ping saw that there were many small Blue-winged beetles on the body of the Blue-winged beetle that had been split into several pieces and they were flying over frantically!

Without hesitation, Zhang Yin and the others quickly picked their weapons and attacked the little Blue-winged beetles that rushed over.

Lin Xiu felt a little weak at this time. The flame that was released just now used up too much of his strength.

When the Analytic Eye was activated, he realized that these small Blue-winged beetles were only rank 3 evolved beasts, which pose no threat to Zhang Yin and the others.

Lin Xiu lifted his head and looked toward the building. There were still a few rank 6 Blue-winged beetles on it. It seemed like they had been affected by the battle just now and were now waking up.

As they climbed on the wall, their bodies were shaking slowly and the dust and mud on the surface were falling off.

Oh no, if these three rank 6 Blue-winged beetles all come down, it would be very troublesome.

He used up so much energy just killing one of them, there was no way he could deal with those few.

“Luo Yue?” Lin Xiu quickly jumped back into the pit.

Luo Yue was still using the ‘Cultivation Technique’ as a guide, constantly absorbing the energy of the odd crystal in her hand.

Lin Xiu could clearly see the odd crystal in her palm turning transparent at a speed visible to the naked eye.

It could be seen that she was madly absorbing the energy in the odd crystal now.

“Go to hell!!!” Zhang Yin and the others waved their weapons continuously, cutting the bodies of the little blue-winged beetles in two.

But there were so many of these darn things like they couldn’t be killed no matter what.

Boom——

At this moment, thunder and lightning flashed from the space crack above. Some stones fell from above, almost hitting Lin Xiu.

“Damn it!” Lin Xiu rushed to Luo Yue, then dodged.

At this moment, Luo Yue came to her senses and saw Lin Xiu pressing on her body.

Of all places, his right hand was on her chest.

“There were some stones just now, I didn’t mean it.” Lin Xiu’s eyes widened when he felt that his right hand was just pressed against something soft.

He stood up immediately.

I’m doomed!

He originally thought Luo Yue would go crazy, but her expression didn’t seem to change and she stood up directly.

“Kill those three.” She watched the three huge rank 6 Blue-winged beetles jumping down from above and said faintly.

“I don’t think they can be killed…”

These were three rank 6 Blue-winged beetles and they had already consumed a lot of power just now.

“Absorb the energy, I will deal with them first.” At this moment, Luo Yue tossed the rank 5 Odd crystal that she had just absorbed most of its energy to Lin Xiu and immediately jumped out.

Lin Xiu looked at her jumping out, hesitated for a moment, and directly sat down cross-legged as he began absorbing the energy of those odd crystals.

“Don’t go!” Li Ping was surprised when she saw Luo Yue jumping out and was rushing toward the three rank 6 Blue-winged beetles that seemed to have just awakened.

Dealing with just one of them was awful enough, and now these three were awake – there was no way to deal with them.

“You can deal with the younger ones.” Luo Yue seemed to hear his voice and as she spoke, she rushed over and her body was like a white shadow.

“We’re not leaving! If we kill these rank 6 Blue-winged beetles, we’ll get the rank 6 Odd crystal!” Zhang Yin exclaimed.

Money comes from danger.

As long as they got these rank 6 Odd crystals, the chances of getting the first place would be greatly increased!

Lin Xiu started using the ‘Cultivation Technique’ as a guide, absorbing the energy of the Odd

crystals hurriedly.

He wasn’t sure if it was because of the increase in his strength, Lin Xiu felt that he had absorbed the energy of the Odd crystal a lot faster and it didn’t take long for him to absorb all the energy inside.

His body was like a dried fish pond just now but at this moment it seemed like a rainstorm suddenly came, and the fish pond was filled up again.

Relaxing!

Lin Xiu opened his eyes and immediately picked up the Dark Edge spear on the side.

“Gu?” Just then, Rollie jumped onto Lin Xiu’s shoulder, holding a blue jewel-like crystal with both hands.

“Rank 6 Odd crystal!?” Lin Xiu turned his head to look and said in surprise.

Oh right, it was obtained when he killed the rank 6 Blue-winged beetle.

And the Odd crystals of these evolved beasts from other dimensions were clearly different from ordinary Odd crystals. The energy contained in these Odd crystals appeared more full and powerful.

“Put it into the backpack!” Lin Xiu said to Rollie.

Rollie seemed to understand Lin Xiu’s words as it jumped directly into Lin Xiu’s backpack holding this Odd crystal.

At this moment, Lin Xiu leaped over and saw that Zhang Yin and the others were still fighting the little Blue-winged beetles and they looked very tired. He suddenly swung the Dark Edge spears in both hands and a flaming Bird flew over!

Bang bang bang——

As soon as the flame collided with the little Blue-winged beetles that flew toward Zhang Yin and the others, there was an explosion.

Moreover, Lin Xiu discovered at this time that his skill ‘Awe of the phoenix’ seemed to have changed. The flames of those flaming birds became fiery red and the temperature was much higher than before.

Those little Blue-winged beetles that touched them and were burnt to slag.

“Collect all the rank 3 crystals and absorb the energy first, Luo Yue, and I will kill those darn things!”
