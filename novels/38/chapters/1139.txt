1140 One Hit K.O.!

The sage warrior’s eyes were opened wide.

Before he could react, Lin Xiu’s spear had already gone through his head!

Pfft – –

Blood splattered everywhere.

The rest of them had their eyes stretched wide as well.

Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

That was incredibly terrifying! How did a sage warrior get killed so easily?!

“Be careful!”

Bai Lin warned his men after seeing what happened.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu could be someone so powerful.

Within a short period of time, he was able to kill so many sage warriors.

At the same time, Bai Lin noticed that he could no longer use his domain energy.

Crap!

As he cursed under his breath, he tried to gather a large amount of energy onto his palms.

Boom – –

He waved his hands in the air and a large claw formed by energy appeared. It was headed to Lin Xiu!

When he saw what happened, the look on Lin Xiu’s face changed. He grabbed onto his long spear with both hands and attacked the large claw.

A loud explosion appeared in the air.

The huge claw was instantly destroyed.

Pfft – –

Bai Lin got a severe backlash from the attack. He almost lost balance of his own body in the air as he spat out a mouthful of blood.

The sage warriors around Lin Xiu started attacking him once again!

Lin Xiu sneered as he raised the long spear above his head.

Clang clang clang – –

With the loud noise in the air, there were sparks everywhere.

The looks on the faces of the sage warriors who were attacking Lin Xiu looked horrible.

There were so many of them attacking Lin Xiu at the same time but Lin Xiu wasn’t defeated at all. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Plus, they could feel that their hands were turning numb due to the attacks.

Then, with the movement of the long spear in Lin Xiu’s hands, all of the weapons that the sage warriors were holding onto were thrown into the distance.

This was impossible!

All of them looked shocked.

However, Lin Xiu did not give them any time to react as he continued moving his long spear.

Boom boom – –

With each loud explosion, there were lightning bolts and flames that were released from the spear.

The sage warriors might have released their ‘sphere’s but all of them instantly exploded when they were attacked by the long spear.

Boom boom boom – –

Soon, the warriors around started falling back onto the ground due to Lin Xiu’s mad attacks.

The battle only happened for a short period of time.

At this moment, other than Bai Lin, the rest of the sage warriors were killed.

The flaming birds that Lin Xiu had released were still flying in the sky.

Soon, all of the remaining warriors of the Bai family were all dead.

“You...”

Seeing how Lin Xiu had killed all of the warriors around him, Bai Lin widened his eyes in shock as he clenched onto his fist. He got so mad that his entire body started trembling.

This time, all of the warriors that he brought along were killed by Lin Xiu!

This was definitely a huge blow to him and the Bai family.

“That’s all you’ve got?”

Lin Xiu looked at him and answered calmly.

“I WILL KILL YOU!!”

Bai Lin was furious as he screamed.

With the large amount of energy released from his body, there was a bright purple glow that surrounded his body.

Xiu – –

Then, with the skills released, his body disappeared into thin air.

Suddenly, he appeared right in front of Lin Xiu!

Bai Lin wasn’t using any weapons to attack Lin Xiu, he was only reaching out to Lin Xiu with both hands.

As he moved his claws towards Lin Xiu, there were explosions continuously heard from the sky.

Lin Xiu sneered and defended himself with the long spear in his hand.

Clang clang clang – –

Lin Xiu was able to perfectly dodge his claws with the long spear and there were loud noises coming from the collision.

“Leave!”

A large surge of energy came from Lin Xiu’s body. When he tried to attack it again, both his hands were hit by the long spear.

Due to the large impact, Bai Lin’s body was thrown far into the distance as well.

Then, Lin Xiu quickly continued attacking Bai Lin who still couldn’t steady himself!

Boom – –

His long spear was thrust toward Bai Lin.

Bai Lin’s pupil shrunk uncontrollably and he wanted to dodge it subconsciously.

However, Lin Xiu was moving too quickly. Although he was able to react quickly, the long spear still managed to slice off his right arm.

Blood splattered everywhere in the air.

Just when Lin Xiu wanted to continue his attack, an opening appeared out of nowhere in the sky.

Bai Lin’s body was then captured in the opening.

When Lin Xiu saw what was happening, he was a little shocked.

Lin Xiu quickly swung his long spear and before the opening was about to close, there were flaming birds that went straight into the opening!

The opening was then closed shut.

“AHHHHHH!!!”

At the same time, back at the mansion of the Bai family, there were a few warriors who got attacked by the flaming birds and were screaming in pain.

“Damn it!”

Bai Qi was looking extremely furious when he saw what happened.

“Elder Bai, are you alright?”

Bai Qi was looking straight at the man ahead before asking.

“I’m fine.”

Bai Lin gritted his teeth as he answered.

One of his arms has been sliced off by Lin Xiu.

Fortunately, the people from the Bai family used their special ability in time to save him.

“Get Elder Bai treated first.”

Bai Qi also noticed that Bai Lin’s right arm was missing.

“Yes!”

Back at the Divine Domain, Lin Xiu frowned as he stared into the sky where the opening was found earlier.

It was so close. He could have killed Bai Lin!

It was such a waste.

Without thinking much about it, Lin Xiu got back to the ground.

Due to the battle, the entire place was now a mess once again.

But, most of the architects have been hiding inside the building and they were not injured at all.

With their technology, it shouldn’t be difficult for them to repair the place.

“Are all of you alright?”

Lin Xiu checked on Wang Qiang and Wu Hao.

“We’re fine.”

Both of them were sitting cross-legged on the ground and were healing their bodies with the ‘cultivation technique’.

When they heard what Lin Xiu asked, they quickly shook their heads.

“Get the rest of the warriors here. I have things that I want to pass to you.”

Lin Xiu told his men to gather around.
