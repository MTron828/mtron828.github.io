These flaming birds all charged towards the warriors surrounding them! UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The entire space became extremely hot due to the appearance of the flaming bird.

When those warriors saw this scene, their faces suddenly showed fear.

They rushed down from the sky to besiege Lin Xiu. At this time, they instinctively sensed the crisis and they unfolded a ‘Sphere’.

Those flaming birds collided with their ‘Sphere’ and the extremely scorching temperature made them feel that their ‘Sphere’ was about to be melted away!

“what!!!”

Some weaker warriors let out wailing and roaring at this time.

Although they unfolded the ‘Sphere’ for defense, they were burned by this terrifying flame, which directly melted their ‘Sphere’.

Without the ‘Sphere’ protection, the flames directly burned their bodies into coke.

Some of the more powerful warriors also struggled to resist Lin Xiu’s attack.

But at this time, Lin Xiu’s figure flashed and he appeared directly in front of them.

The long spear in his hand attacked them directly!

bang bang bang-

These warriors had no ability to resist Lin Xiu’s attacks and their heads were instantly pierced by Lin Xiu!

The situation quickly turned into a one-sided battle.

Lin Xiu proved with his powerful strength that these warriors could not cause him any harm at all.

Instead, one warrior after another kept falling from the sky.

Mr. Pang was originally worried about Lin Xiu, but at this moment, seeing this shocking scene, his eyes widened.

Amazing, simply amazing.

“Run, run!!!”

Some warriors watched Lin Xiu swing his spear and kill several warriors. Their hearts were filled with fear.

At this time, there was no desire to fight at all.

In such a one-sided battle, who has the courage to fight?

“Since you guys didn’t want to leave just now, where are you guys going now, huh.”

Looking at the warriors who wanted to leave, Lin Xiu showed a sneer.

At this moment, a black source mark appeared on Lin Xiu’s forehead.

With the use of the source mark power, a large number of matrices suddenly appeared.

These matrices instantly surrounded the sky into a huge circular space.

Those warriors wanted to escape, but their bodies hit the matrix and there was no way to leave!

No matter how they attacked, there was no way to break through the matrix.

“Die… all of you!”

And Lin Xiu waved the spear in his hand without mercy at this time!

Everything happened in a flash.

These warriors had all been killed by Lin Xiu!

“Only one percent gain in experience?”

After killing these warriors, Lin Xiu looked at the experience progress bar and felt extremely depressed.

He killed so many warriors by himself, but he only gained this bit of experience!

It seems that it is too difficult to continue to upgrade.

“Mr. Pang, the reconstruction here is up to you.”

At this time, Lin Xiu looked at Mr. Pang who was not far away and then said.

“Sure.”

Mr. Pang nodded.

Back in the room on the other side of the City Lord’s Mansion, Lin Xiu took out the secret inheritance scroll he had just obtained.

“Hm?”

When Lin Xiu just wanted to open the inheritance scroll, he found that it seemed that there was no way to open it directly.

Lin Xiu found it strange.

He picked it up and fiddled with it, but Lin Xiu didn’t see any switches.

At this time, he could not forcefully pull the scroll open, it would be bad if he accidentally destroyed it.

Could it be that this thing has the same nature as a skill card?

Lin Xiu thought of a possibility at this time.

With the triggering of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, at this moment, the source strength of his body was released, passed to the hand, and then passed to the scroll.

It’s like communicating with the skill Card and absorbing the information of the skill Card.

Soon, as Lin Xiu’s source strength was transferred to this scroll, it suddenly burst into a faint white light.

At this time, the entire scroll became white and lit up.

Indeed!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu suddenly became excited.

At this time, although the scroll had not been opened yet, Lin Xiu felt that a large amount of information was pouring into his mind.

There was too much information and it flooded into his mind crazily at this time, making Lin Xiu feel like his head was going to explode!

And Lin Xiu also slowly got the information at this time.

This scroll was indeed the inheritance of Bai Lingxian!

There was not only a powerful force passed down to Lin Xiu’s body, but also a lot of information about the divine marks.

Because this Bai Lingxian, in the past, was a powerful Divine Marker.

The power of the Divine mark also greatly increases the strength of a warrior.

Lin Xiu closed his eyes and comprehended the information that poured into his mind.

At this moment, the scroll, which originally radiated white light, suddenly became bleak.

Soon, at a speed visible to the naked eye, it slowly disappeared.

This thing was just a carrier.

The real inheritance has all poured into his mind.

“Don’t worry, I will protect this city.”

Lin Xiu said indifferently after some time when he opened his eyes again.

From that information, Lin Xiu learned that Bai Lingxian, this powerful god warrior, has feelings for the city he founded.

bang bang bang-

At this moment, Lin Xiu heard a knock on his door.

As soon as Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered, he could sense who was outside the door.

“Come in.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Squeak-

The door was quickly pushed open and Mr. Pang walked in quickly.

“City Lord.”

“Well, what’s the matter?”

Lin Xiu said.

“Tomorrow is the day when the Manhuang City will hold a conference. Do you want to prepare?”

Mr. Pang said respectfully.

“tomorrow?”

Lin Xiu was startled when he heard Mr. Pang’s words.

“How long have I been here?”

“The city lord has been in seclusion for three days.”

Mr. Pang said.

It’s been three days!?

At this time, Lin Xiu was a little dumbfounded.

Unexpectedly, it has been three days since he absorbed this inheritance power.

He thought it was just a while.

Lin Xiu stood up at this time and stretched.

“By the way, how is the reconstruction over there?”

“The reconstruction has been completed. In the past few days, no other warriors have come here.”

Mr. Pang said.

The strength that Lin Xiu showed that day was too terrifying. After killing so many warriors, who would dare to easily set foot in Lingxian City?
