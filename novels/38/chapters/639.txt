Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

Mark’s eyes were still wide open at this time, full of disbelief.

“How can it be…”

He opened his mouth wide and wanted to move, but he couldn’t.

Lin Xiu pulled the spear out of his head.

Boom–

‘As the spear was drawn, a streak of blood spurted out.

Mark fell to the ground, and there was no sound.

“Mark!!!”

The man who was fighting with Ouyang Hang, saw this scene out of the corner of his eyes, and roared loudly.

“Your opponent is me!”

And at the moment when he was distracted, Ouyang Hang continued to attack him!

In the battle with this man, Ouyang Hang still didn’t have much advantage, and he was even stabbed with a sword. At this time, under the white battle suit, there was already a wound, and blood was flowing down his body.

But now, taking advantage of this man’s distracted moment, Ouyang Hang seized the opportunity and frantically attacked him!

“Get lost!”

Under Ouyang Hang’s series of attacks, the man was a little annoyed and there was a wicked look in his eyes.

Just like when Mark dealt with Lin Xiu, he waved his right hand as if he was releasing something from his sleeve.

Ouyang Hang, who was originally imposing and was about to defeat the man from the Interstellar Academy, suddenly felt the strength of his body draining at an extremely fast speed at this moment.

The skill that he originally wanted to use couldn’t be used at all!

What exactly is going on!?

Feeling all this, the expression in his eyes suddenly changed greatly.

The long sword in his hand was directly cleaved by the man’s weapon. In the next moment, the man from the Interstellar Academy would directly kill Ouyang Hang!

“Go to hell!”

The man from the Interstellar Academy roared loudly, and the weapon in his hand was about to penetrate Ouyang Hang’s body!

It’s over!

‘When Ouyang Hang saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank.

Dang–

But at this critical moment, the man’s weapon was instantly stabbed by a long spear, and the tip of the spearhead directly blocked his weapon!

“are you playing such despicable means again?”

Lin Xiu looked at the man and said aloud.

“Despicable means?”

‘When Ouyang Hang heard Lin Xiu’s words, he had a sudden realization.

“It seems that the people of your Interstellar Academy were able to win by using some despicable means!”

Ouyang Hang said in a cold voice, no wonder his body’s strength has suddenly decreased a lot just now. It turned out that this person used some tricks.

“Shut up!”

At this time, the man seemed to be a little angry. Looking at Lin Xiu in front of him, he waved his weapon and wanted to kill Lin Xiu first!

But he hasn’t attacked yet, Lin Xiu has already attacked!

The long spear in his hand was constantly waving, flowing like a cloud, and he frantically attacked the man!

Dang dang-

‘The man originally wanted to attack Lin Xiu, but at this time, he could only counterattack, constantly resisting Lin Xiu’s attacks.

Lin Xiu’s offensive was too violent, and the pressure made him a little breathless.

Moreover, every shot that was stabbed was aimed at his vital part, which was going to kill him!

‘Watching his body retreat to the edge of the platform, this man has no way to defend!

He thought of the scene where Mark was directly pierced through his head by Lin Xiu’s spear just now, and he felt a little chill in his heart.

That kind of ‘method’ could only be used once. It was used on Ouyang Hang just now, so now it couldn’t be used anymore!

Dang–

The moment Lin Xiu’s spear stabbed out again, the weapon in his hand resisted Lin Xiu’s attack, and then he retreated back and directly exited the platform.

When the referee over there saw this scene, he immediately whistled, which meant that the man from the Interstellar Academy had been disqualified.

“Tsk, how useless!”

“Rubbish!”

‘As he jumped out of the platform, the surrounding audience booed.

This man could no longer care about these things. Lin Xiu didn’t attack his body just now, but now he just got off the stage, and he felt severe pain in his body, like the organs and bones were beginning to burst.

Pff—

Just after walking a short distance, he vomited out a mouthful of blood, and then fell to the ground.

Life or death on the platform was not an issue but outside of the platform, there were still some professional medical teams who carried the man from the Interstellar Academy away.

“This guy, he will die.”

Ouyang Hang sneered when he saw this scene, but now the strength of his body had not recovered, which was very strange. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Bang bang bang-

And at this moment, a dull sound came from the side on the wide platform.

Lin Xiu looked sideways and saw that Huang Zhen and Qian Yao were both sent flying!

‘The two people who fell on the ground were covered in blood and looked like they were seriously injured.

Similarly, some professional medical teams also carried away Huang Zhen and Qian Yao.

“Hahaha, the students of Sacred Region Academy are just so-so.”

The man with the huge axe laughed loudly at this moment.

His body had somehow became much bigger than before, and the swollen muscles seemed to be full of strength.

“Next, it’s you guys’turn.”

He looked at his other two companions who were fighting with Baili Haoling, then looked at Lin Xiu and Ouyang Hang, and said with a grim expression.

“This is the warrior known as the King of Power. He is a top expert in the Interstellar Academy. People from the Sacred Region Academy are going to lose!”

“One against two people from the Sacred Region Academy – simply too strong!”

At this time, watching this King of Power knock Huang Zhen and Qian Yao out, the audience who supported the Interstellar Academy shouted.

“Humph!” Ouyang Hang was very upset when he heard this but now he had no choice, his body still had no strength, and he didn’t know what trick the guy just played. He had lost so much internal power.

“You just sit there and watch.”

Lin Xiu glanced at Ouyang Hang, and then said lightly.

Because of the existence of the ‘Engulf skill, Lin Xiu’s power has completely recovered. At this time, he looked at the King of Power and his eyes narrowed.

“Boy, how dare you look at me like this?”

Seeing Lin Xiu looking at him with mocking eyes, King of Power’s face became even more sinister.

“Do you think you can beat me just because you beat the two weakest members of our team?”
