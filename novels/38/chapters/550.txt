They had entered the most important phase in their match and were both surrounded by a thick layer of ashes. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Boom – –

Along with a few soft groans, there was a man who got thrown on to the ground.

But, who was it?!

The rest of them had a curious look in their eyes and as they turned around, they noticed that the rank 7 warrior was the one who was lying on the ground!

“Damn it…”

The rank 7 warrior widened his eyes in shock and only managed to say these two words before blood started splurging out of his mouth.

As they looked at the man on the ground, his body was filled with holes and there was a large amount of blood spurting out of his body.

He struggled for a bit and then, he turned completely silent.

He died.

“Dead…..dead?!”

All of the rank 6 warriors were shocked.

That man was the strongest amongst them and because of him, they always thought that they would be able to defeat Lin Xiu since he was just a young man. No matter how powerful he might be, they assumed that it was impossible for Lin Xiu to survive their cooperative attack.

However, they didn’t think that the reality was so different from what they had expected.

“Anyone else wants the same thing?”

While they were still in shock, there was another figure that appeared from the other side. It was Lin Xiu who was asking them in a calm tone as he stared at the warriors before him.

Lin Xiu’s smile was still as innocent as before. With the look on his face, who would have expected that this young man was the one who killed a rank 7 warrior?!

“We’re the ones who didn’t know any better.” One of the men looked at Lin Xiu and his lips were trembling.

Lin Xiu’s spear was already covered in blood and the colour of it was still fresh. It was obvious that they were the blood of the rank 7 warrior.

“I’m sorry. We’re the ones at fault!” The rest of the warriors said respectfully towards Lin Xiu as well.

At this moment, they definitely weren’t Lin Xiu’s opponent which was why they immediately surrendered.

“What’s wrong? Now that you can’t defeat me, you want me to let you go?” Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows and asked.

“Did you think that there would be such good news in this world?”

“What do you want?”

When the men heard what Lin XIu said, they frowned and grabbed onto their weapon as well.

Although the rank 7 warriors were killed, the rest of them were rank 6 warriors as well. It’s not like they were useless men!

“Keep one thing here.” Lin Xiu said bluntly.

“What do you want? We can give you anything!” One of the warriors clearly did not want to fight Lin Xiu. When he heard what Lin Xiu suggested, he let out a breath of relief and quickly asked Lin Xiu.

“There’s only one thing that I want. One thing…” Lin Xiu put out one of his fingers and said, “Your life.”

When Lin Xiu was done, his spear was already heading towards the warriors within a blink of an eye.

“Defeat him!!!!”

Most of them had a determined look in their eyes when they heard what Lin Xiu said and screamed out loud.

If they fled and allowed Lin Xiu to defeat them one by one, death would be the only way out. They might as well fight him together!

However, they didn’t think that their abilities would be so far behind Lin Xiu’s.

Clang Clang Clang – –

With the sound of the metals colliding into each other, the rank 6 warriors started dashing towards Lin Xiu but most of them lost control of the weapons. Before they could even activate their ‘Yuan’ for protection, there was already a bloody hole that appeared on their heads.

“The EXPs aren’t too bad.” Lin Xiu mumbled to himself as he got rid of the ones that wanted to rob him and checked the EXP that he gained from them.

He took a good look around and headed in the other direction.

“He’s so strong…” Some of the warriors hid in the back as they watched Lin Xiu fight and when they saw Lin Xiu leaving, they let out a breath of relief.

In fact, there wasn’t only one group of men who were interested in the colour changing mantis. There were lots of warriors who stayed back and watched Lin Xiu fight the creature, hoping to get the load as well.

However, they didn’t expect for it to end this way.

Lin Xiu continued heading towards the exit of the Thunder Valley.

Initially, he thought of looking for a safe spot in the Thunder Valley to absorb the energy from the rank 8 odd crystals but Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the dangers in this area were much more than he expected. It is important that he isn’t disturbed during the process while he was absorbing the energy from the crystal or else it may cause some irreversible effects to him.

Then, he decided to head back to the Sacred Region Academy.

As he continued walking forward, Lin Xiu suddenly found that he had returned to where he picked the Dark Sacred Fruit.

“So that’s where this is. There is a byroad here…”

As Lin Xiu muttered to himself, he continued walking forwards and then he noticed that the Dark Sacred Fruit tree had been chopped!

There were also a lot of bodies surrounding the area.

When he saw what happened, Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank uncontrollably and rushed forward.

The bodies that were lying on the ground belonged to Jiang Tao and his team.

Were they in a fight with someone else? Just for the Dark Spirit Fruit?!

He looked around and saw that these people died a painful death as if they had been slashed a thousand times with a sword.

Their eyes were still wide open and were filled with dissatisfaction.

Lin Xiu felt heartbroken as well when he saw them since these were the men who fought by his side with those from the Royal Beast Sect.

“Pfft, pfft…”

Just when Lin Xiu was walking around, checking the scene around him, there was a soft voice that caught his attention.

Who was it?!

Lin Xiu turned around and saw a familiar face.

“Jiang Tao?!”

Lin Xiu walked towards him and noticed that Jiang Tao was now lying in a pool of blood. He was in such a horrible state that Lin Xiu’s scalp turned numb.

This was because all of his limbs had been chopped off and there was some substance that had been sprinkled on his wounds, causing a large amount of ants that gathered around his wound. It looked incredibly gross.

“You…” Jiang Tao was also numbed by the pain from his limbs. When he saw that it was Lin Xiu, he was trying to warn Lin Xiu.

A warrior’s determination to stay alive was strong and this was why Jiang Tao was still alive.

“You….should… leave…”

Jiang Tao said with all the strength left in his body.

“Who was it?!”

Lin Xiu was a little heartbroken after hearing what Jiang Tao said. They haven’t known each other for long but Lin Xiu knew that Jiang Tao was a righteous man.

At moments like these, instead of asking Lin Xiu to save him, Jiang Tao was asking him to leave.

“The royal…..Royal….” His mouth was moving, trying to say something when Lin Xiu noticed a black shadow that was rushing towards him!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened in shock and moved backwards due to his reflex.. The black shadow immediately landed on Jiang Tao’s head and caused it to break into a million pieces!
