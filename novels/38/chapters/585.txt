Chapter 586: The Rock Monsters

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Along with Lin Xiu’s loud cry, there was a black shadow that appeared on his spear and at the moment when he pierced his spear forward, there was a huge black dragon that appeared!

The black dragon had huge fangs and was rushing towards the ground at an extremely fast speed!

Koong Loong – – Koong Loong– –

The entire ground started to shake violently and it was followed by a loud explosion!

“BREAK IT!!!”

The soil from the ground flew everywhere and there was a huge hole that was instantly formed on the ground!

Although the entire place was now completely surrounded by dust, Lin Xiu could still see the huge crater on the ground that he had created with his skills – ‘Heavenly Dragon Breaks The City’. There’s where Lin Xiu found the thing that was glowing brightly.

This thing was connected to the roots of the huge black tree and it was surrounded by lots of roots. It was buried deep underneath the ground as if it was connected to all the trees that were in this forest.

That’s it! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Boom boom boom– –

Suddenly, Lin Xiu released his ‘Yuan’ and directly blocked the attack that was coming from the branches.

With the spear in his hand, his body was like a shadow that was moving forward without being stopped by the branches.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

He was moving so quickly around that he was just like a blur figure.

When he saw the thing that was giving out a bright, white glow, Lin Xiu widened his eyes in surprise. He grabbed onto his spear tightly and thrusted it forward in the direction where the glow was coming from!

Koong Loong – –

As soon as his spear touched the thing, an eye-blinding light was released along with a loud, terrifying explosion.

Koong Loong – –

The entire Tower of Trials started shaking as well.

“What’s happening?!”

The students who were outside of the tower could also feel the grounds beneath them shaking.

“What’s happening?”

Some of the students started to panic.

“Let’s have a look.”

When they thought about what might be happening, they quickly looked at the screen that was showing the progress of those inside the tower.

“I’ll be damned!’

They looked up and quickly noticed that Lin Xiu, who was first on the list, had just reached the 93th floor!

“Such a monster...”

Yang Jian and his men walked over to the screen as well and when they saw that Lin Xiu was now on the 93th floor, their bodies trembled as well.

93th floor! What the hell?!

This was impossible!

“Who is he?!”

The students gathered around the tower started discussing it and as for those who weren’t present yesterday were all completely shocked when they saw what was happening.

“This floor.....could it be earth?”

As Lin Xiu broke the soil beneath him that was giving energy to the black trees, Lin Xiu already won the challenge.

Now, he was undoubtedly on the 93th floor.

As he looked around, he was now completely surrounded by huge rocks.

The rocks were everywhere and it was found all over the ground.

Lin Xiu remained motionless on the ground. This was because from the previous floors, Lin Xiu could already tell that this floor wasn’t an easy one as well.

He took a deep breath and sat on the ground, activating his ‘Cultivational Technique’ in order to recover his strength.

As time passed, Lin Xiu took his time to rest while the students who were on the ground started feeling nervous when they saw Lin Xiu doing nothing.

“That fella should just come down here if he doesn’t want to challenge that floor. Why isn’t he doing something?”

Some of the students noticed that Lin Xiu was already on the same floor for the past 3 hours and there was still no progress from him which was why some of them became annoyed.

“He was on the same floor yesterday for the entire day but he still won.” One of the students spoke up when they heard the others complaining.

He was curious as well. Theoretically speaking, the maximum time needed for one floor would only be an hour. There would only be 2 outcomes, either win or lose.

But for some reason, Lin Xiu liked staying on the same floor for an extremely long time.

Perhaps it was because the level above the 90th level was different?

“Chirp chirp?”

Rollie and the Ice Crystal White Bird were staying on top of a huge tree that was below the Tower of Trials and were looking curiously at those who were staring at the screen.

Lin Xiu knew that the floors from the 90th floor wouldn’t be as easy which was why he left them on the ground.

At the same time, Lin Xiu was taking deep breaths as he sat on the ground of the 93th floor. Then, he opened his eyes and stood up with his spear.

He took a good look around and he was still completely surrounded by these huge rocks.

It has already been hours but there was nothing abnormal that appeared on this floor.

However, while Lin Xiu was cultivating earlier, he could feel that there was indeed something or someone around him.

As he looked at the huge rock that stood before him, Lin Xiu’s eyes were filled with a cold murderous look. He gathered his source energy onto his spear which immediately gave a white glow.

Soon, the entire body of the spear turned from black to white.

Xiu – –

With a strong leap, Lin Xiu headed forwards like an arrow released from the bow.

The tip of his spear was aimed towards the huge rocks before him.

Koong Loong – –

As the spear and the rocks collided, there was a loud sound that rang throughout the floor.

Then, a huge piece of rock broke off and fell apart.

Koong Loong – –

The rocks did not break as Lin Xiu had expected. Instead, the rocks started moving.

Roar – –

As the rocks moved, there was a loud roar.

Then, the rocks that were slanted by the sides slowly started moving.

From the moment Lin Xiu entered the room, he had already activated his Analytical Eye and realised that all of the rocks around him were alive!

This was a rank 8 rock monster!

The rocks around him started moving and most of them stood up. They gathered together to form a huge fist that swung around, headed towards Lin Xiu!

The body of the rock monster was huge but it didn’t make it slow.

Fortunately, Lin Xiu’s reflexes were quick enough and easily dodged the attack by moving himself backwards.

Koong Loong – –

As the huge fist of the rock monster landed on the ground, there was a loud sound that came from it.

It was followed by the ground shaking vigorously and then a huge, deep crater that was formed on the ground.

The rock monsters around him were slowly awakened and they were all swinging their fist towards Lin Xiu.

Xiu xiu – –

Lin Xiu waved his spear in the air and was moving himself around the dodge the attacks.

Koong Loong – –

As the monsters kept attacking and hitting the ground, it kept shaking vigorously.

Lin Xiu continued jumping around the dodge the attacks and while one of the rock monsters were trying to attack him, Lin Xiu grabbed onto his spear with both his hands, pierced the rock monsters from above downwards!
