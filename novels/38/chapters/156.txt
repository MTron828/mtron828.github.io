Chapter 157: Gravity Room

Lin Xiu held onto the same weapon and continued to train in the training ground.

After the small hiccup, no one dared to doubt Lin Xiu’s ability.

“Lin Xiu, take a look at this!” Right at this time, Zhang Yin discovered something and waved for Lin Xiu’s attention.

“What is it?”

Lin Xiu put down his weapon when he heard Zhang Yin and headed towards him.

He saw a large door where Zhang Yin and Lei Lei stood.

At the side was a small sign that read ‘Gravity Room’.

Is this the gravity training room?” Zhang Yin asked curiously.

He wanted to push the doors open but could not.

Lin Xiu’s eyes turned bright. Although training could strengthen a warrior’s body, it was not effective in strengthening the weak organs inside.

But training in a gravity room was different. The air and pressure were heavier inside that would violently exhaust the cells in the body, as well as making it difficult for blood circulation. The burden on the heart, lungs and other organs was extremely large.

Life would only evolve under the harshest environments. If a person trained inside the gravity room and used his or her cultivation technique to absorb energy, the entire body would undergo a heaven toppling change.

“Seems like we need to swipe a card…” Jiang Li looked from around and commented.

Lin Xiu took out the silver key card immediately without hesitation.

“Di di di”

Once Lin Xiu flashed the card, the door lit up and opened automatically.

“It’s a gravity room!” Many people came over and spoke up in surprise.

It was an extremely large room with various strange machines around.

A few saw the name “Gravity Room” and exclaimed.

The students followed Lin Xiu as he entered the gravity room.

“Two times gravity, every minute will consume 2 points.”

“Three times gravity, every minute will consume 3 points.”

There was an ‘Attention’ sign on the surrounding walls that wrote the instructions.

“What the hell, this requires points as well?!” Zhang Yin could not help but curse when he saw what was required to operate the room.

“It will require 200 points for an hour if we use two times gravity, where will we have enough points to train in this room…” The people around started to complain.

They needed points to rent accommodations and had to spend on food and necessities. The expenditure of points was too harsh.

“You guys can enter the Sacred Region Academy website to accept missions and earn points, or exchange materials and such for points at the exchange center.”

“There are many ways to earn points, you guys can take a look there.” Lin Xiu informed the crowd.

It had the same logic as playing games. There were times that the player would need to check the website’s F.A.Q to learn how to play and not be a noob.

Everyone was enlightened when they heard his words.

Sacred Region Academy was unlike ordinary academies, it did not tell them where things were or what they needed.

The freshmen needed to find things out themselves.

“You guys can use my card, those who wish to train can stay here. Those who don’t can continue training outside.” Lin Xiu then placed his own card into the slot on the machine and said.

None of the students left when they heard his words and stayed on. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Everyone was moved by Lin Xiu’s action, after all, no one was willing to use up their own points to allow everyone to train together.

“Let’s try the simplest, two times gravity!” Lin Xiu said and pressed the button for the two times gravity.

Right at this time, bright lights flashed around them.

Bang-

The doors closed right away.

The gravity room started to move.

Lin Xiu immediately felt his body become heavier, his chest became even stuffier and his ears seemed to buzz.

Some freshmen that felt the change in gravity fell on their butts as they felt an unbearable pain on their bodies.

The majority were able to grit their teeth and persist.

But everyone was rank 3 warriors. Aside from being uncomfortable at the start, they began to get used to gravity.

Lin Xiu sat in a cross-legged position. Fortunately for him, he had brought in the rank 6 odd crystal that he had absorbed halfway through the night.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and slowly retrieved the rank 6 odd crystal as he activated the cultivation technique to cultivate.

The energy in the gravity room was extremely weak and would be ineffective to absorb the energy in the air inside.

Lin Xiu was able to sense that under the heavier gravity, the cells in his body were constantly breaking down but at the same time performing cell division. The new cells were stronger than their predecessors and every new cell nucleus would not be damaged after the division, as though they were able to divide endlessly.

The students around started to adapt and did not waste time and started training.

Seconds and minutes past. Right at this time, people gradually started to be unable to tolerate the gravity room.

Lin Xiu remained seated and unmoved inside like an old monk.

Li Ping stood at his original spot as beads of perspiration dropped down his forehead, but Lin Xiu’s indifferent expression as though nothing had changed pissed him off.

No, I can continue!

But he was no longer able to handle it after one minute. It was their first time in a gravity training room and the burden on his body was too strong. If he persisted to stay, it would instead harm him.

Right at this time, almost all the freshmen had walked out while gasping for breath, leaving only Lin Xiu inside.

But Lin Xiu felt the energy in his body increasing endlessly. Training here for three hours was like training for three days outside!

But his body had absorbed the maximum and he could no longer continue otherwise his body might crumble.

He took a deep breath and opened his eyes, only to discover that he was alone.

“Two times is so so, let’s try three…”
