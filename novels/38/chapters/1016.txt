Chapter 1017: Revenge

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu looked at the box that she was giving to him and he was surprised.

What’s this?

“You will know once you see it.”

She was afraid that Lin Xiu would reject it which was why she immediately placed the box in Lin Xiu’s hand and left.

“Bye!”

Wu Mei waved her hands and walked out of the place.

She was looking very casual about the parting.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but laughed and shook his head.

“Master.”

Wang Qiang had awakened from his cultivation as well.

“Hmm? Looks like you’re at the peak of a respected warrior now.”

Lin Xiu couldn’t easily tell what level he was at by just one look.

The peak of a respected warrior.

He was only one step away from being a sage warrior.

“En.”

After hearing what Lin Xiu asked, Wang Qiang nodded his head as well. He gently touched his head and said, “Well, I still have a little bit more before I become a sage warrior.”

“En. You will be able to break through it very soon.”

Lin Xiu told his apprentice.

Then, there were two men behind them with masks on, were getting excited too.

From the looks of it, their strength has improved drastically as well.

One of them looked at Lin Xiu and Wang Qiang and there was a murderous look in his eyes.

Boom – –

He raised his hand and aimed it at Wang Qiang.

At that moment, a bright light appeared on his palm as it was covered by a bright white energy. All of these were aimed at Wang Qiang!

Lin Xiu noticed all of it with the corner of his eyes and he swept his right hand. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

A barrier formed by his source energy appeared that blocked the man’s attack.

He managed to block all the white energy that came from the other man’s palm.

At the same time, Lin Xiu moved his left hand and a thick lightning bolt flowed through his arm and onto the man with the mask on!

The lightning bolt was like a vicious snake that rushed straight to his face.

Boom – –

Then, the mask on the man’s face broke into 2!

“Anda?!”

Wang Qiang quickly realised who it was.

As he looked at the man with the mask removed, he could clearly see that it was Anda.

Anda was staring at both Lin Xiu and Wang Qiang with a vicious look on his face.

“You didn’t think that I would still be alive now…”

Anda gritted his teeth as he spoke.

The man standing next to him seemed to realise that he no longer needed the mask.

He removed the mask and threw it on the ground.

Lin Xiu raised his brows as he looked at the man.

This was because Lin Xiu could clearly feel that this man was different from the rest of them.

His abilities were much stronger than the rest.

With the help of his Analytic Eye, it was obvious that this man was a safe warrior.

He was definitely considered one of the strongest one here.

“HAHAHAHAHAHAH!!!!”

Suddenly, Duan Zheyan opened his eyes and started laughing.

He had been in space for many years and never broke through.

But now, he was now a sage warrior!

Why wouldn’t he be delighted?!

As he stood up, he saw Lin Xiu and quickly bowed to him.

“Thank you.”

If it wasn’t because of Lin Xiu, it would be impossible for him to be free from that space and he would never be able to get the energy from that old man that allowed him to be a sage warrior.

Lin Xiu shook his head as he didn’t do much.

Duan Zheyan then noticed Anda and the man standing next to him.

Especially when he saw the murderous look in Anda’s eyes, he already knew what was about to happen.

“Just go. I will settle this.”

Lin Xiu could sense what Duan Zheyan wanted to do and he stopped him.

Duan Zheyan was stunned.

He really wanted to help in order to repay Lin Xiu.

But, when he thought of how strong Lin Xiu might be, he realised that Lin Xiu might not need his help.

“By the way, the person that you fought earlier is called Sun Jian, from the Ancestral Star.”

Duan Zheyan thought of something and told Lin Xiu about it.

He knew that Lin Xiu had things that he had to do.

Then, he passed Lin Xiu a mini computer.

“There will be information about them on this computer.”

Lin Xiu took the mini computer and nodded his head in gratitude.

“Goodbye.”

Duan Zheyan nodded his head and gave another bow to Lin Xiu as a token of appreciation before leaving.

As for the two remaining warriors, they left immediately.

They didn’t want to be part of this mess.

“Wang Qiang, would you like to take revenge on your own?”

Lin Xiu looked at Anda with his eyes narrowed.

“Of course.”

Wang Qiang clenched onto his fist and nodded his head.

“Go ahead then.”

Lin Xiu told him calmly.

With that, Wang Qiang immediately started attacking Anda!

“You’re asking for it!”

When Anda saw how Wang Qiang was coming at him, he screamed in rage.

He was prepared to attack Wang Qiang as well.

None of them had weapons but they had already started fighting.

Boom boom boom – –

As they continued fighting, there were continuous loud explosives that rang throughout the place.

The other man seemed to be waiting for an opportunity to join the fight between Anda and Wang Qiang.

But soon, Lin Xiu appeared right in front of him.

“It’s not good to ambush.”

Lin Xiu said to the man.

“Hmph!”

The man sneered and immediately reached out for Lin Xiu.

Xiu – –

Suddenly, the hand that was about to grab Lin Xiu turned into a black material.

When Lin Xiu saw what was coming at him, he frowned and immediately took a few steps back to dodge the attack.

But, even when he dodged it, some of the black material still landed on Lin Xiu’s arm.

At that moment, there were rotten wounds that appeared on his arms.

However, with Lin Xiu’s ability to heal, the wounds quickly recovered.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frowned when he saw what happened.

This man’s source energy seemed a little peculiar.

“Young man, I’m warning you not to mingle into this.”

The man glared at Lin Xiu and warned him.

“The An family is protected by me now.”

“So?”

Lin Xiu was not bothered at all.

“So? You will end up dead!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was not taking him seriously, he screamed in rage. As his body moved, he continued attacking Lin Xiu!

Then, his nails started growing.

The nails turned black as well as they got longer and it looked incredibly disgusting.

Plus, there was a black colour energy source that surrounded the finger which made it look even more peculiar.
