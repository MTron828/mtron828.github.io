After hearing what Lin Xiu said, Bingbing immediately offered.

Lin Xiu was instantly stunned after hearing her suggestion.

The Hao Yue Sect also seemed to be one of the forces in Bai Di City.

“It’s alright.”

He thought about it for a while and then shook his head.

All of them in the Hao Yue Sect were women and it would be inconvenient for him to be there.

As for the intel on Bai Di City, he could get his own men to look for it.

“I still have other things to deal with.”

Lin Xiu continued explaining himself.

Bingbing and Lanlan had disappointed looks in their eyes.

They were really hoping that Lin Xiu would be able to join them.

“Lin Xiu had other things that he had to do.”

Ji Mei felt helpless as she glared at both Bingbing and Lanlan.

These two girls must have been attracted to the unique temperament of Lin Xiu due to the skills and abilities that he had shown earlier.

“If there’s anything that you need help with, you have to let us know.”

Ji Mei looked at Lin Xiu and told him in a serious tone.

Lin Xiu had just saved their lives.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and smiled.

After bidding goodbye to Ji Mei and the girls, Lin Xiu headed back into the city.

However, this time, Lin Xiu was going to the other side of Bai Di City.

“The Bai family?”

At one of the underground bards, one of the staff heard what Lin Xiu asked and the look on his face changed.

“Why are you looking for the Bai family?”

“Nothing much. I have a relative that works there as a guard. I just came to pay him a visit.”

Lin Xiu intentionally showed a blunt smile.

Initially, he was going to get the Dark Shadows to do so but the Bai Di City had been undergoing strict inspection which made it difficult to get any information.

As for the internet, there aren’t many details about the Bai Di City, especially when it comes to the Bai family.

“Tsk! Can’t believe that you have a relative there working as a guard. That’s pretty good.”

After hearing what the waiter said, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but laugh.

“The Bai family is located in that area…”

The waiter then continued telling him more things about the Bai family. He told Lin Xiu where their house was and also some basic information about it.

The Bai family was located in the centre of Bai Di City and it was stretched across a very huge piece of land.

In the middle of the city, there was a mountain valley that belonged to the Bai family and they lived on one of the peaks that was at least 2000m from sea level.

However, this was not the actual Bai family and was only one branch of it.

After getting some information from him, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

The Bai family was indeed a strong one. The Bai Di City revolves around the Bai family and the city has been built surrounding it.

This was already happening when they weren’t even the actual Bai family. They were only one of the branches of the almighty Bai family.

Bai Zhanfei should be one of them that belonged to the Bai family here in Bai Di City.

But, without much time, they would know that Bai Zhanfei and the rest of his men have been killed.

“Thank you.”

Lin Xiu smiled and then gave the waiter a few odd crystals.

The waiter caught the crystals subconsciously and when he saw that it was a beast king odd crystal, a smile grew on his face.

By selling these crystals, he would be able to exchange it for a large amount of money.

“Hehe…..brother, if there’s anything that you would like to know, you can always ask me. I might not be good at anything but I do have a lot of information on hand.”

Since Lin Xiu was being generous, the waiter started being more friendly.

“Hmm….Do you know the Road of Ice and Fire?”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and asked.

“The Road of Ice and Fire?”

After hearing what Lin Xiu asked, the man was stunned for a moment before saying, “Of course.”

“That is known as the road to death.”

With that said, the waiter seemed to have thought of something and he was looking frightened.

“The road to death?”

Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows.

“En. While travelling on that road, you have to bear the torture of both ice and fire.”

“Plus, there are lots of scary evolved beasts on the road. You could die very easily there.”

The waitress said to Lin Xiu.

“Do you know how to get there?”

Lin Xiu then continued asking.

“You want to go there?”

The waiter asked subconsciously.

“No. I would definitely die if I went to someplace so scary.”

Lin Xiu chuckled.

“I just wanted to know more about it.”

“Let me tell you about it then. In order to get to the Road of Ice and Fire, you can go to the Warrior’s Guild at the Northern side of the city. They would usually hire warriors to complete missions on that road. Once you accept the mission, they will have people guiding you there.”

“If you went on your own, it would be difficult for you to find your way in.”

The waiter continued.

“En. I understand. Thank you.”

Lin Xiu took a sip of the alcohol and smiled.

Although he didn’t get much, he still found out a few things about what he wanted.

Then, the waiter no longer spoke with Lin Xiu as he had to serve the others.

As the night passed, there were more and more people in the bar.

Bakk – –

Lin Xiu then took out both the golden boxes from his expansion space.

This was the reward that he got for being first in the Tian Jiao Competition.

Lin Xiu had no idea what was inside this box.

He never got a chance to open it.

Now that he has, there was an eye-blinding light that appeared from inside the box.

An odd crystal. It was an odd crystal that was shining brightly.

A beast saint odd crystal.

If Lin Xiu was still a respected warrior, this beast saint’s odd crystal would be useful for him.

However, at his current stage now, he was already a sage warrior. Even if he absorbed it now, it wouldn’t help much.

But…..it was better than having nothing.

What would there be in the other box?

He returned the gold box with the odd crystal back into his expansion space before opening the other one.

As soon as he opened it, there was a bright light that came out of it and a scorching heat came from inside the box.

What was this?

Lin Xiu was stunned. When he took a colour look, he noticed that there was a white flame inside the box.

The flame was in the space of a lotus.

White Lotus Flame.

This was considered as a unique type of flame.

The box must be made out of some special material and technique so that it could keep such a flame inside it. As Lin Xiu held onto the box, he couldn’t even feel the warmth coming from inside.

Without even thinking much, it must be the old man who built this box.

Only the old man would be able to come up with such things.

“This flame…..how would it be when compared to Hellfire?”

Lin Xiu looked at the flame in front of him and muttered to himself.

As he looked at the white lotus flame inside the box, he could somehow feel a cold feeling coming from it.

This was a burning flame but it feels cold?

Lin Xiu had a confused look in his eyes.
