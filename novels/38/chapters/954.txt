Boom – –

Lin Xiu’s body was thrown so far away that he ended up inside one of the buildings.

Roar — –

Just when Huang Fulin was headed towards Lin Xiu in order to attack him, there was a huge roar from behind him.

He quickly turned around and noticed that the black scaled crazy lizard was now right behind him with his claws coming at him!

Crap!

Huang Fulin had a bad feeling about it and quickly released his ‘sphere’, taking the blow from the attack face on as he had no time to dodge.

“Zhao Rui, are you still alive?!”

Huang Fulin shouted as he continued fighting the humongous lizard.

“I will still be alive even if you’re dead!”

Zhao Rui’s body slowly rose from the ground.

However, this time, his face was looking ghastly pale.

This was because Lin Xiu had pierced through his ‘sphere’ with the long spear and it almost broke it!

......

“Let’s kill this humongous beast first!”

Seeing how Zhao Rui had returned, he shouted at Zhao Rui so that they could work together.

“Hmph!”

Zhao Rui sneered and joined Haung Fulin in attacking the black scaled crazy lizard.

They had to at least get rid of either Lin Xiu or the lizard because it was too much for them to handle.

Especially the lizard. They weren’t afraid of it but everytime they had the opportunity to kill Lin Xiu, this lizard would be there to stop them.

“You’re dead!”

On the other hand, with Heilong and Bailong working together, Sima Qiang’s condition was slowly getting worse.

He had exhausted most of his energy and could no longer stand the attacks.

Crap!

When Sima Qiang saw Heilong and Bailong gathering their energies for the final blow, Sima Qiang knew that his time was up.

This time, he had no confidence on whether he could take the attack!

Heilong and Bailong were both sage warriors and they definitely weren’t weaklings!

“Move!”

At that crucial moment, a figure came flashing from one of the buildings.

That’s when they noticed that Lin Xiu was now standing right in front of Sima Qiang.

From the attack earlier, Lin Xiui seemed to be hit hard and caused him to land amongst the debris of the collapsed buildings.

But in actual fact, Lin Xiu wasn’t injured at all.

No longer because Lin Xiu was protected by his ‘sphere’, he had also activated the skills attached to his title. A 30% chance on reducing 50% of the damage!

The damage that Huang Fulin had done to Lin Xu was only 50% effective!

As Lin Xiu noticed the large amount of energy coming from both Heilong and Bailong, Lin Xiu started swinging his long spear as well.

A large number of flaming birds flew out of the spear and gathered together to form a phoenix.

The huge flaming phoenix flapped its wings and headed straight towards the energy ball that was released by Bailong and Heilong!

Boom – –

As both the energy collided, there was another loud explosion.

However, Heilong and Baiilong were sage warriors. The flaming phoenix was soon destroyed by the strong, powerful energy that was coming from both the sage warriors.

This terrifying energy headed straight towards Lin Xiu’s body!

“Bye!”

Bailong couldn’t help but laughed when he saw what was about to happen.

From his point of view, Lin Xiu was being too arrogant with his abilities!

“Young master!”

Sima Qiang was shocked and frightened.

There was a huge crater form on the spot where Lin Xiu was standing because of the source energy that had been released by Heilong and Bailong

“Huuu….I almost got killed.”

Just when Bailong and Heilong thought that they had successfully killed Lin Xiu, there was a familiar voice that came from the thick layer of dust on the ground.

The look in their eyes changed.

They could clearly see Lin Xiu’s body that was slowly rising into the air.

Although he was covered in dust, he still didn’t look injured at all!

It was also the skill attached to his title that allowed him to receive only 50% of the damage.

The odds of it noly happening 30% of the time was already good enough for him.

With so many attacks coming at him continuously, it would easily trigger this skill.

Plus, he also had the ‘source strength absorption’ skill activated. Whenever Lin Xiu attacked them, he would be able to absorb Lin Xiu’s energy which was why Lin Xiu would never run out of it!

With sufficient energy, he managed to continuously strengthen his ‘sphere’.

“This brat…”

Bai Long was looking mad.

They had failed in killing Lin Xiu even with these skills!

Lin Xiu was still looking energetic with no damage done to him. He didn’t seem exhausted at all and was looking like they had just started the fight.

Damn it!

“Young master, are you alright?”

Sima Qiang wiped off the blood from the corner of his lips and asked Lin Xiu, who was still floating in the air.”

“Elder Jiang, you can leave this to me now.”

Lin Xiu said flatly.

He noticed that Sima Qiang was already severely injured while he was fighting Heilong and Bailong.

If he continued, Sima Qiang would die in their hands.

Then, Lin Xiu took a deep breath and decided to reset this entire system.

He was allowed to use ‘rage’ once again!

Plus, the sky was turning dark.

This was good news for Lin Xiu.

As this would mean that he could use his other skill – Power of the Stars!

Lin Xiu gathered his thoughts and all of the stars in the night sky lit up brightly!

What was happening?

Huang Fulin and Zhao Rui, who were busy fighting the black scale lizard, were horrified when they saw what was happening.

Bailong and Heilong stared at the sky that was now immediately filled with stars and they were shocked as well.

Soon, all of the stars that were brightly lit were shining down onto the ground like a spotlight.

All of them were shining on Lin Xiu’s body.

At that moment, Lin Xiu’s body was completely covered with the bright light.

He looked like a war god that had just descended from heaven.

What skills were there?!

Sima Qing was in awe as well.

He didn’t think that this man, the descendant of the Ye family who had the Imperial Order, would be so powerful.

He felt comforted at the same time.

The stronger the descendants of the Ye family, the probability of the Ye family returning would be higher!

“Bailong! Heilong! Quick! Kill him!!!”

Huang Fuling and Zhao Rui had a feeling that something was getting out of control and he quickly shouted at the other two sage warriors who were closer to Lin Xiu!

At the same time, Huang Fulin finally managed to chop off the claws of the huge lizard!

This was a beast summoned from another space and it definitely wasn’t a match for a sage warrior. Although it was huge with a very thick skin, it still couldn’t withstand it any longer.

Lin Xiu had closed his eyes and he slowly raised the long spear above his head!

“Torrential Storm….of Rose Flower!!!!!”
