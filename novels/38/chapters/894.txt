Chapter 895: ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’

Although it was said that the stronger the warrior was, the longer the life expectancy would be, but to stay at this darn place for a hundred years, it might drive a person crazy.

“I train daily and time flew very fast for me.”

Seemingly knowing what Lin Xiu was thinking, Zhao Yongyuan continued to speak at this time.

“You never went out?”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but continue.

“Order.”

Zhao Yongyuan shook his head as if he absolutely obeyed the orders of the ancestors of the Zhao family.

“Then today, you can go out with me.”

Lin Xiu said.

Actually, Lin Xiu had another reason for following Zhao Xiaoqing to Zhao’s house.

Because this Zhao family was one of the families that Lin Xiu was looking for.

At that time, it was a hidden force that belonged to the Ye family.

To destroy the Bai family, the first thing to do is to integrate the forces of the Ye family.

“Sure.”

Zhao Yongyuan nodded slightly.

“But Master, you can learn skill first, then go out.”

Seeing that Lin Xiu was about to leave, Zhao Yongyuan said aloud at this time.

“All right.”

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment, then nodded.

After sitting cross-legged, Lin Xiu looked at the skill card.

On the skill card, there were calligraphy characters and three words were written:

‘Heaven Breaking Strike’

This is the name of this holy-level skill card.

Just looking at the name gave one a sense of domineering.

But what kind of skill is this?

Spear art skill, swordsmanship, or boxing?

Lin Xiu didn’t know that this holy-level skill card was completely different from ordinary skill cards, so Lin Xiu couldn’t understand it.

“Yongyuan, do you know what kind of skill card this is?”

Lin Xiu looked up at Zhao Yongyuan and said aloud.

“I am not sure as well.”

Zhao Yongyuan shook his head at this time.

“But I’ve heard that it can be practiced as long as the three major skills of the Ye family reach a certain level.”

so...

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then sat cross-legged, then placed the holy-level skill card on his forehead.

With the communication of his own mind with this holy-level skill card, this holy-level skill card burst out with a lot of white light.

This dazzling light instantly drowned Lin Xiu’s whole body.

At this time, Lin Xiu also felt that a large amount of information was pouring into his head like a tide.

There was so much information and it poured in so fast, that Lin Xiu felt that his head was aching. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

But correspondingly, with the influx of information, Lin Xiu closed his eyes and felt as if he were in an ancient barren land.

A tall and strong figure stood there, he was holding a long sword at this time and behind him, there were various weapons.

It seems that he is proficient in every weapon.

At this moment, he raised his long sword and moved slowly.

This sword seems to be drawn out slowly.

But looking at this scene, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the extremely potent power contained in this seemingly slow sword.

Boom—

In the next moment, this sword cut a hole in the sky!

All kinds of beasts flying over in the sky were all absorbed by this broken space.

Splitting the space!

And at this moment, Lin Xiu’s whole person instantly returned to reality.

Looking around, he couldn’t help panting.

There was cold sweat on his forehead.
