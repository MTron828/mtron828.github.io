Chapter 443: Here Comes Trouble?

“What’s happening…?”

As Lin Xiu looked at the scene before his eyes, he was shocked as well.

According to the knowledge stored in his memories, this area remained frozen throughout the years and it has been the same for the past decade.

Now it has suddenly started to melt?

When he took a closer look at it, the peculiar-looking ancient trees that would only grow on frozen rivers had now fallen onto the ground and there were cracks all over the frozen grounds.

It was looking as if the place was about to break down.

Underneath the frozen river, there were thousands of zombies, from the viral apocalypse that happened in the previous century, that were sealed in these rivers

There were also a few other horrifying creatures that are sealed below!

“I wonder if these things would actually come back to life once the ice melt…” Lin Xiu frowned as well as he thought about it.

This was because the northern part of this ice land was close to Xing Yao Academy!

Although there were a lot of them that had ridiculed him previously, there were still a number of friends and teachers that are there. If these creatures came back to life and have decided to head in that direction…

“That’s impossible.” Luo Yue frowned as well as she looked at the screen in front of them.

“What is impossible?” When Lin Xiu heard what she said, he got curious and asked Lu Yue what she meant.

“Usually, this place wouldn’t start melting all of a sudden.” Luo Yue replied.

“Plus, I just checked it through the satellite. There isn’t much change in the temperature over that area. Since all of these happened suddenly, I have a feeling that there’s someone behind these.”

“Manmade?” Lin Xiu was surprised.

If it was really manmade, what was the person’s purpose for doing all these?

There were thousands of zombies and creatures beneath the frozen river. Could it be…?

“There would already be someone else there to investigate on this matter.” Luo Yue seemed to know what Lin Xiu had on his mind and immediately answered him.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded his head in agreement.

The crowd around them was shocked as well when they saw the news but none of them were bothered about it. Since the news was happening on the other side and it wouldn’t affect the Sacred Region Academy. In other words, the Sacred Region Academy was one of the safest places on earth.

“It’s about time. I should get going.” Lin Xiu looked at the time and informed Luo Yue.

“En.” Luo Yue nodded.

After Lin Xiu left, Luo Yue was still looking at the screen with a frown on her face.

Then, she noticed something odd about it and her pupils constricted.

On the other hand, Lin Xiu was already walking towards the main building.

As he looked at the tall building before him, Lin Xiu was surprised.

This was the first time that he was called here.

He took a second to look around before walking towards his destination that had been pointed out by Nan Zhengjun.

The building was designed in a sci-fi manner and the entire shape of the building was a sphere.

As he entered the building, there weren’t many people inside.

Lin Xiu took the lift to the 21st floor and saw the huge silver doors that were shut.

“This should be it…”

He walked towards it and just when he was about to push it, the door opened on its own.

“Come in.”

Before Lin Xiu had the chance to react to it, a voice came from inside the room.

He took a good look around. This room was an office with lots of weapons around and there were also painting placed all over the room.

Initially, Lin Xiu thought that this was a conference room. He didn’t think that it would be something like this.

As he walked inside, he could see that there were a few middle-aged men in the room with an elderly man sitting in the middle of it. When the elderly man saw Lin Xiu, he was looking at him as if he had been waiting for Lin Xiu. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“Dean Baili?” Lin Xiu was shocked as he greeted the elderly that had white, long hair.

He heard from Zheng Nanjun that the deputy dean wanted to meet him. He didn’t think that it would be the dean himself.

When he saw the dean, Lin Xiu was shocked as well because Lin Xiu knew that this elderly was a very powerful man.

“Do you remember me?” Just when Lin Xiu was still overwhelmed with meeting the dean, there was a cold voice that interrupted Lin Xiu.

As Lin Xiu turned in that direction, he could clearly see the idle-aged man who was glaring at him.

“I’m sorry. I am not aware of which teacher you are.” Lin Xiu smiled as he replied politely.

But, deep inside, Lin Xiu’s heart sunk. This was because the middle-aged man standing right in front of him was obviously the man who tried to catch him at the power station.

Lin Xiu remembered that he had been toasted that night and therefore, the other person wouldn’t have any evidence that it was him.

“You may not know me but I know you very well.” The middle-aged man sneered as he spoke to Lin Xiu.

“You were the one at the power station, aren’t you?!”

“I have no idea what you’re talking about.” Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulder in confusion.

“Stop lying! Your figure as well as the skills that you used were exactly like the one that was used at the power station the other day!” Seeing how Lin Xiu wasn’t admitting to his mistake, the middle-aged man screamed at him.

“Where’s your evidence?” Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows as he questioned the man.

“In this society, it is all about evidence.”

“Sir, I think you got the wrong person.”

“You…” When the middle-aged man saw how calm Lin Xiu was being, he started jumping in rage. Just when he was about to stand up, Dean Baili, who was next to him, gently patted his shoulder and told him to calm down.

“HMPH!” He glared at Lin Xiu and returned to his seat.

“You are Lin Xiu, am I right? You are an outstanding man.” Dean Bailli spoke to Lin Xiu as he gently stroked his beard.

“I heard from Teacher Nan that you called me here so that we could discuss the rewards from winning the match?” Lin Xiu turned towards Dean Baili and asked, without looking nervous or afraid.

“En. We should be rewarding your class for it but before that, there is something that I would like to discuss with you.” Dean Baili nodded his head as he explained to Lin Xiu.

“What is it?” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he asked.

This time, he could feel that it wasn’t as simple as he had imagined. With so many teachers present, it was as if he had gotten himself into trouble…

Dean Baili hinted at another man next to him and the man nodded his head in response. He picked up the remote control, pressed a button and there was an image that appeared on the screen.

There was a very clear figure that appeared on the screen.
