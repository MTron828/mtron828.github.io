1272 Surging Dark Power

Liu Mo’s right hand, which was pierced through the body by the iron chains and could not move, was directly cut off by Lin Xiu!

Liu Mo’s face was full of pain.

“Kill me if you dare!!!”

At this time, he looked at Lin Xiu and roared with a ferocious face.

!!

“Kill you?”

“No, I won’t just kill you like that.”

Lin Xiu said rhetorically.

Thinking of Mr. Pang and Lei Tong’s hands and feet being cut off by him in this way, Lin Xiu’s eyes also revealed a hint of cruelty.

The frosty giant sword in his hand continued to chop at his arms and feet!

This time, the severe pain finally caused Liu Cheng to let out a scream.

“Wait for yourself to die slowly.”

Lin Xiu looked at Liu Cheng, whose hands and feet were cut off by him, bleeding profusely and said in a cold voice.

At this moment, Liu Cheng screamed crazily.

“Kill me! Kill me quickly!”

He yelled frantically.

But Lin Xiu didn’t reply. He threw away the frosty giant sword in his hand and walked directly to the other side.

Xiaobai also flew down at this time. It also let Baili Haoling down, allowing Baili Haoling to stand on the ground.

“Lin Xiu…”

Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu who was coming and was startled.

Because now Lin Xiu’s state looks very strange.

There was a large amount of weird dark energy released from the whole body.

What Baili Haoling found really starnge was that that killing intent in Lin Xiu’s eyes was too strong.

It was so strong that even Baili Haoling felt a sense of fear when she saw it.

“Haoling… are you okay…”

But when Lin Xiu walked over, the dark power released from his body began to dissipate slowly.

The killing intent in the eyes also began to disappear quickly.

At this moment, the eyes also returned to their original expressions.

“I’m fine.”

Baili Haoling shook her head.

Although there were many wounds on her body, her healing energy was very strong and the bleeding has completely stopped at this time.

It was only a matter of time to heal.

“I’ll go and see them first.”

Lin Xiu walked over to Mr. Pang and Lei Tong.

Although their hands and feet were cut off, they were not completely dead at this time.

Because they were peak Sage warriors after all, it will take some time for them to die completely.

That Liu Cheng had his hands and feet cut off by Lin Xiu just now and there were dark iron chains running through his body, but he would have at least two or three hours to die completely.

This means that he will still experience two or three hours of pain.

“City… City Lord…”

Lei Tong and Mr. Pang looked at Lin Xiu’s arrival and seemed to be able to speak.

But their bodies were already extremely weak.

Both hands and feet were cut off and those hands and feet were still around their bodies and blood flowed all over the ground.

“do not speak.”

Looking at their miserable situation, Lin Xiu felt complicated in his heart.

In this situation, it is impossible to save them.

Unless, time can be turned back. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Lin Xiu sighed in his heart.

But at this moment, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly, as if thinking of something.

Unless time can be turned back… Time can be turned back…

“That’s right!”

Lin Xiu said excitedly at this time.

He could give it a go.

“What’s wrong?”

Baili Haoling, who came over at this moment, was taken aback.

“I want to save them.”

...

Lin Xiu looked at Mr. Pang and Lei Tong and said.

Baili Haoling also looked at their bodies.

Seeing their miserable situation, Baili Haoling couldn’t bear it anymore.

After all, they worked closely with Lei Tong and Mr. Pang and were very familiar with each other. She didn’t expect them to become like this now…

But it should be impossible to save them…

At this time, Lin Xiu stretched out his hands and aimed at the area where Lei Tong and Mr. Pang were.

With a thought, the source strength in the body surged crazily.

Boom, boom, boom——

At this moment, the whole ground shook!

What’s happening!?

Seeing this scene, Baili Haoling’s eyes were full of surprise.

...

Especially seeing Lin Xiu’s hands stretched out, facing Lei Tong and Mr. Pang’s words, Baili Haoling felt that Lin Xiu wanted to end Lei Tong and Mr. Pang’s miseries.

But soon, as Lin Xiu’s power was released, Baili Haoling felt an aura coming from him.

Not only was there an earthquake around, but there was also a strong wind.

The space around Mr. Pang and Lei Tong seemed to be distorted.

What is Lin Xiu going to do?

Baili Haoling became more and more shocked.

“Go… back!!!”

At this time, Lin Xiu let out a low growl and all the strength in his body was released.

Soon, the area between Mr. Pang and Lei Tong seemed to undergo changes visible to the naked eye.

The cracks on the ground were restored rapidly.

Lei Tong and Mr. Pang’s limbs also began to move slowly by themselves at this time.

Soon, as Baili Haoling looked at them in astonishment, these severed arms and broken feet automatically moved towards their broken wounds.

The wounds on Lei Tong’s and Mr. Pang’s bodies also healed at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Poof——

But at this moment, Lin Xiu spat out a mouthful of blood.

The earthquake stopped and the surging wind also stopped.

Lin Xiu gasped heavily and blood kept flowing out of his mouth.

“I’m fine…”

Seeing Baili Haoling approaching, Lin Xiu waved his hands.

Just now he used ‘Time Control’, this skill may be able to control the time at will.

Lin Xiu took control of this range, allowing time to go back to the past.

Originally, he thought that after he reached the God warrior level, it would be easier to control, but he didn’t expect that it would actually make his body so uncomfortable.

Just now, the strong pressure seemed to explode Lin Xiu’s internal organs.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s appearance, Baili Haoling didn’t bother Lin Xiu either.

“We…”

At this time, Lei Tong and Mr. Pang opened their eyes wide and their eyes were full of surprise.

Their hands moved subconsciously, then they looked at their own hands.

They found that their severed hands were back!

Not only the arms, but also the feet have returned to their appearance before they were cut off.

“Are you guys okay…”

Lin Xiu had already recovered slightly at this time, but his face was extremely pale.

Looking at Lei Tong and Mr. Pang, he wiped the blood from his lips and said.

“Thank you, City Lord!”

When Lei Tong and Mr. Pang heard Lin Xiu’s words, they came back to their senses in an instant, knelt down on the ground, and said gratefully.
