1233 Absorbing Sha Li

“Hmph!”

Hearing how Lin Xiu was still trying to fight him when he was already inside Lin Xiu’s mind, Sha Li instantly sneered.

He immediately entered Lin Xiu’s brain, trying to take over his body.

“Ding!”

“Unknown energy detected…”

” ‘Engulf’ activated…”

With the notification from the system, Sha Li who was already inside Lin Xiu’s mind looked frightened.

“Ahhhhh!!!!”

Sha Li’s painful cry rang throughout Lin Xiu’s mind.

“What is this?! What is this?!!!!!”

Sha Li’s face was covered with fear as he stayed inside Lin Xiu’s mind.

The black energy that infiltrated Lin Xiu’s mind was obviously the spirit energy of Sha Li.

Sha Li’s spirit energy has infiltrated into Lin Xiu’s body and he wanted to get rid of Lin Xiu’s spirit so that he could take over Lin Xiu’s body.

However, what he didn’t expect was that he could now feel that his spirit energy was getting absorbed into Lin Xiu’s body by some weird energy!

What on earth was happening?!

Sha Li was about to turn mad as he had never encountered such things.

“Is it fun?!”

Lin Xiu stared at Sha Li’s vicious face that appeared in his mind.

He didn’t care if Sha Li was now looking as if he was in a lot of pain.

Lin Xiu coldly looked at the progress bar of ‘Engulf’ that appeared in his system which was now absorbing the unknown energy that entered his body.

“Please! Let me go!!!”

“I’m sorry! I’ve learnt from my mistake!!!”

Sha Li was now covered with fear.

His face was distorted from the pain that he was feeling. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

But, Lin Xiu was not bothered at all.

Soon, the face that was in his mind had turned into a shadow.

As the spirit power of Sha Li was getting absorbed into the system, the energy that he had left in Lin Xiu’s body slowly disappeared as well.

“I’ll curse you!!!!”

“You will be going to hell with me!!!”

Before Sha Li completely disappeared, he had a cruel look on his face.

With that said, his entire body then disappeared into thin air.

“Ding! Congratulations master on absorbing the unique energy. EXP gained 72574245…”

Soon, there was another notification that rang from the system.

There was a slight movement in his progress bar.

When he took a closer look, it was about 5%!

So much?!

Lin Xiu was surprised. He never thought that Sha Li would have so much energy in him.

It has to be noted that the warrior gods that he killed wouldn’t even give me 1% of progress in his EXP.

Lin Xiu quickly returned to reality.

However, he had a feeling that something wasn’t right.

He couldn’t tell what he felt off.

“Hmm?”

Lin Xiu looked onto the ground and he could clearly see Baili Haoling who was standing still at the same spot.

There was a meat patty that was right in front of her that looked a little disgusting.

She killed him?

The other warrior known as Sha Qiang seemed to have been killed by Baili Haoling.

Although there was also blood all over Baili Haoling’s body, it didn’t look like they were serious injuries.

Lin Xiu didn’t think much about it and flew next to Baili Haoling.

“Haoling?”

Lin Xiu called for Baili Haoling who remained stagnant.

When he looked closely, he noticed that Baili Haoling’s condition was a little odd.

Her eyes were blood red and it looked much scarier than before.

Lin Xiu suddenly had chills running down his spine.

Plus, Lin Xiu was surprised to find that there was a large amount of blood-like energy that surrounded Baili Haoling’s body.

“Haoling?”

Seeing how there was no reaction from Baili Haoling, Lin Xiu waved his hands in front of her face and continued calling for her.

There was still no reaction from Baili Haoling.

It was as if she had entered some sort of peculiar zone.

Lin Xiu frowned as he felt that something wasn’t right.

Then, he quickly patted Baili Haoling on her shoulder.

Slap – –

However, as soon as Lin Xiu’s hands came in contact with the red energy around her body, he could feel an intense pain on his arm. It felt as if his hands had been electrocuted and he quickly pulled back his hand.

Then, there were a large amount of small wounds all over Lin Xiu’s body.

Seeing how his hands were injured, Lin Xiu was in shock.

What were these red energies?! How was it possible that they injured his hand?

“Baili Haoling! Wake up!”

Lin Xiu didn’t dare to touch Baili Haoling recklessly anymore. He continued shouting at her in order to wake her.

However, there was no response from Baili Haoling.

Plus, on her face, there were tiny blood vessels that appeared. All of them looked as if they were about to pop.

This was definitely a bad situation for Baili Haoling.

If this continued, Baili Haoling might be in danger!

But….what can he do now?

This was the first time that Lin Xiu had encountered such things and he didn’t know what to do as well.

He hesitated for a moment. Then, Lin Xiu clenched onto his jaw and reached out to the red energy that was around Baili Haoling’s body.

At the same time, he quickly activated ‘engulf’.

Boom – –

As soon as his hands touched the blood red energy, Lin Xiu could feel an intense pain all over his body.

Damn it.

Lin Xiu clenched onto his jaw and he could no longer pull back his hands.

Although it hurts, Lin Xiu could still clearly feel that the blood red energy was being absorbed by the system inside him.

It was something that his system could absorb.

This allowed Lin Xiu to heave a sigh of relief.

As Lin Xiu activated ‘Engulf’, all of the blood red energy was starting to get weaker.

The pounding blood vessels all over Baili Haoling’s face slowly disappeared as well.

All of the red energy seemed to feel that they were being absorbed by Lin Xiu and instantly returned into Baili Haoling’s body.

When Lin Xiu felt what was happening, he widened his eyes in shock.

These red energies seem to have their own consciousness?

Lin Xiu felt even more surprised.

This definitely wasn’t source energy but what on earth was it?

Baili Haoling’s eyes slowly reverted back to normal as well.

Her blood eyes slowly turned pitch black once again.

There was finally light in her beautiful eyes.

“It hurts…”

Baili Haoling held onto her shoulder as she spoke.

“You’re awake?!”

Lin Xiu spoke out of surprise.

“Lin Xiu?”

Baili Haoling was surprised to see Lin Xiu standing in front of her. Then, she noticed that there was a crushed body of Sha Qiang on the ground, with only his head that was left intact.
