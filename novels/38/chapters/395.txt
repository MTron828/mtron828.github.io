Chapter 396: Come Prepared

“Aren’t you afraid of the Sacred Region Academy’s punishment by doing this?” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, then looked at Yu Yi and said aloud.

There was a different air around Yu Yi this time but Lin Xiu didn’t know what the difference was.

“At this hour, the leaders and teachers of the Sacred Region Academy are having a meeting in the conference building on the west side. If a student suddenly disappeared, who would know about it?” Yu Yi looked at Lin Xiu with a cold smile.

It seemed that he remembered what happened before as Yu Yi clenched his fists and looked at Lin Xiu with a murderous aura.

Twice! He was knocked down by Lin Xiu twice with so many people watching.

“It seems that you came here prepared.” Lin Xiu was not afraid at all at this time, then said with a smile.

The black-clothed men standing behind Yu Yi stared at Lin Xiu and when their body was about to move, Yu Yi suddenly said coldly, “Back off!”

Hearing Yu Yi’s words, these black-clothed men were startled for a moment. They looked at each other and seemed to hesitate.

“He is my prey, whoever dares to come forward, I will kill you!” Yu Yi turned around and shouted abruptly.

He has to kill Lin Xiu with his own hands in order to vent his wrath!

The people in black stood still and didn’t move anymore.

Lin Xiu noticed this scene and revealed a smile, then said, “I see, they were sent by the guy named Ouyang or something, right?”

Yu Yi snorted when he heard Lin Xiu’s words and didn’t say much.

“In addition to being able to play tricks, what else can you do!”

As soon as Yu Yi spoke, he rushed towards Lin Xiu like a phantom!

The speed was astounding!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and the pupils in his eyes constricted.

Yu Yi appeared much stronger than when he was fighting against him before!

In this short period of time, he had improved so much too!?

But it was too late for Lin Xiu to think about this because Yu Yi has already thrust his sword towards him!

Swish swish swish——

The moment the long sword pierced over, there was a bit of cold light.

Bang bang bang——

Lin Xiu couldn’t dodge and was accidentally stabbed a few times. Several holes appeared in his clothes.

“Are you only going to dodge! Come at me with your fighting spirit at the Tower of Tournament eh!” Yu Yi yelled at Lin Xiu who kept dodging because of his fierce offensive.

Tear——

The long sword swung again, leaving a deep mark on the wall behind.

“Come here!” Seeing Lin Xiu dodge his attack again, Yu Yi became even more furious.

Lin Xiu looked at the long sword in his hand about to slash into the refrigeration box on the tabletop and Lin Xiu quickly rolled over. While rolling over on the tabletop, he carried the refrigeration box to the other side.

“Squeak——!”

The Little Ice Crystal White Bird looked at Yu Yi through the transparent glass and seemed very angry.

“Don’t come out.” Lin Xiu said to the ice crystal white bird in the refrigeration box.

Regardless of whether ice crystal white bird could understand, he directly placed the refrigeration box in the direction of the stairs.

At the next moment, Lin Xiu’s right foot slammed to the ground and the whole ground instantly made a loud noise and shook.

Swish——

The Dark Edge spear placed on the other side fell down instantly, then flew directly to Lin Xiu!

Dang–

Originally, Yu Yi held the long sword in his hand and wanted to chop Lin Xiu’s body, but he didn’t expect that at this moment, Lin Xiu had already held the Dark Edge spear and directly blocked the spear.

“Oh? Change of weapon?” Yu Yi clearly noticed that the weapon in Lin Xiu’s hand was different from the previous one and sneered at this moment.

Lin Xiu ignored his words and put force on his Dark Edge spear, pushing away the long sword.

The look on Yu Yi’s face changed and he took several steps back due to the powerful impact.

Lin Xiu did not stop the movement in his hand, holding the new Dark Edge spear forged by Luo Yue, he rushed directly to the front!

Swish swish swish——

The spear was in Lin Xiu’s hand, turning very flexibly.

“Hng!” Seeing Lin Xiu rushing over, Yu Yi snorted coldly and the long sword turned into bright light and continued to slash towards Lin Xiu who was rushing over!

Dang dang dang——

The spear formed an arc with Lin Xiu’s rotation, then collided with the long sword in Yu Yi’s hand, making a powerful sound.

So strong!?

The pupils in Yu Yi’s eyes constricted as he felt the power from Lin Xiu’s spear.

The sword shook so much that his hand was hurting. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He did it without difficulty at all.

Lin Xiu, who was holding the new Dark Edge spear, did not feel any discomfort and found the movement of the spear very smooth.

Dang dang dang——

Lin Xiu grasped the body of the Dark Edge spear with both hands at this time and attacked Yu Yi’s body wildly.

Yu Yi, who was in an offensive state just now, could only block constantly with the long sword in his hand at this moment.

“Damn!!!” Yu Yi, who had been overwhelmed by Lin Xiu’s fierce offensive, was furious at this time.

With a loud roar, a light blue light suddenly burst out from his body.

Lin Xiu, who wanted to cut Yu Yi’s body with his spear, suddenly felt that his spear had hit something extremely hard.

Boom–

The powerful recoil force caused Lin Xiu to take a few steps back.

“Sphere!?” After a closer look, Lin Xiu saw that Yu Yi’s body was covered by a light blue circular barrier!

“You seemed to have become stronger again.” Yu Yi said with gloomy eyes as he looked at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s fierce offensive just now made him feel a little overwhelmed and he couldn’t help but unfold the ‘Sphere’.

Lin Xiu looked at him without responding to his words and with a wave of his right hand, a huge flaming bird hit him directly!

The flame was very huge, directly blocking Yu Yi’s vision – all he could see were fiery red flames.

“Insignificant skill!” Yu Yi was very familiar with Lin Xiu’s flame; he had already studied it and now he was not afraid!

“Get… lost!!!”
