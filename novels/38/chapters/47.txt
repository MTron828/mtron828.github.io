Chapter 48: Sacred Region Academy

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Sacred region?” Xu Wen and the others were taken aback when they heard this question, then pondered for a while.

“I don’t seem to have heard of it…” After a while, almost everyone shook their heads.

Lin Xiu was a little disappointed. Could it be that she simply made a casual remark and there was actually no such place...

“Wait, I seem to have heard of it.” Li Yi was still deep in thought, and after some time, he suddenly had enlightenment.

“On top of the five major academies, there is still the strongest one – the Sacred Region Academy!”

“Sacred Region Academy?” Lin Xiu knitted his brows. From his understanding, other than the five major academies, there wasn’t any other well-known warrior academy.

He hadn’t heard of this Sacred Region Academy, but it sounded quite prestigious. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Of course you haven’t heard of it. I only heard it from my brother-in-law,” Li Yi said with a proud look.

“Sacred Region Academy is a super warrior academy placed above the five big academies. Every warrior there is recognized to be a genius by other academies!”

“Is that an exaggeration?” A soldier pursed his lips, obviously a little doubtful, and felt that Li Yi was bragging.

Even Xu Wen was a little doubtful as he had not heard of this Sacred Region Academy.

“Nonsense, the minimum requirement for high school graduates was rank 2 and above in order to have the opportunity to enroll in this academy.” Li Yi stretched out two fingers and said.

He didn’t know about it, but he overheard it from his brother-in-law, who was an official in the federal government. Initially, he had forgotten about it, but now that Lin Xiu brought it up, he suddenly recalled.

“You have to be rank 2 just to qualify?” When the rest of the soldiers heard this, they gasped in surprise.

They were only rank 1 at this moment, and they graduated from high school long ago and then joined the federal government directly as soldiers.

Lin Xiu raised his brows at this moment. I see, the so-called Sacred Region is actually a college academy?

Initially, he thought that it was the name of a place.

Rank 2? There was still a year, reaching rank 2 was just a matter of time.

But thinking of that girl who was around his age, she was already higher than rank 3 – it was truly quite aggravating.

No, he could not fall behind. When he became a high-ranking warrior and stood in front of her, that impassive face of hers would show a hint of surprise.

With that thought, the corners of Lin Xiu’s lips couldn’t help but twitch slightly.

“Lin Xiu, don’t tell me you want to get into that academy,” Li Yi said.

“Yup.” Lin Xiu nodded.

“Hahaha.” The rest of the soldiers laughed when they heard Lin Xiu’s words.

They still thought that Lin Xiu was only a quasi-warrior. After all, a high school student wanting to become a rank 1 warrior wasn’t so easy.

“What are you guys laughing about? He’s already a rank 1 warrior.” Xu Wen glanced at the soldiers and said.

“What!?” Hearing Xu Wen’s words, the rest of the soldiers were shocked.

Although they knew that Lin Xiu’s performance today was very brave, they thought that he just had the guts to charge forward and didn’t think much about it.

After all, when Lin Xiu first came, he was at best a quasi-warrior, right?

“Am I right?” Xu Wen looked at Lin Xiu like he was looking at a monster.

Today, after Lin Xiu used a skill called Profound Intent, Xu Wen had been secretly observing him. He did not expect that Lin Xiu’s strength not only reached the level of a warrior, but he had also become much stronger than those soldiers who had long been a rank 1 warrior.

Lin Xiu nodded and did not deny it.

“Tell me, how old are you this year? Which year are you in?” Li Yi’s eyes widened. As everyone was anxious and focused on killing the zombies today, they didn’t have time to think about it carefully. After Lin Xiu’s battle today, it was impossible that he was just at the level of a quasi-warrior.

The moment Li Yi’s words came out, the rest of the soldiers looked at Lin Xiu as well.

“Er... sophomore, 17 years old.” Lin Xiu didn’t think much of it and replied straight away.

“Oh my God, go and ram yourself against a tofu!” Li Yi suddenly wanted to cry but didn’t have the tears to do so when he heard Lin Xiu’s reply.

He was in his twenties and was only a rank 1 warrior. This chap was only 17 years old and he was already a rank 1 warrior. In one year’s time, with better talent, he might even become a rank 2 warrior.

“That’s amazing.” Xu Wen also gave Lin Xiu a thumbs up at this moment. These soldiers now did not treat Lin Xiu like a high school student, after all, who has seen such a perverted high school student ah?

It was completely dark and other than the light from the flames, the other areas were pitch-black.

“Let’s take turns to keep watch at night.” Xu Wen thought about it and proposed.

There were only seven people left, Lin Xiu, Xu Wen, and Li Yi would keep watch in the first half of the night, while the remaining four soldiers would keep watch in the next half of the night. This way, they wouldn’t be unaware if any monsters attacked.

As for going to sleep in those abandoned houses, it didn’t even cross anyone’s mind.

As those houses had been abandoned for a long time, they did not know whether there would be any mutated insects or something.

After all, that building was full of giant spiders earlier, which made them disgusted.

At this moment, the four soldiers were asleep by the tree over at the other side while Lin Xiu held his long spear and began brandishing it.

Fundamental Spear Arts.

“Stil training at this hour?” Li Yi yawned and said.

“En, I can’t sleep anyway.” Lin Xiu nodded, then continued to train.

Although it was ordinary spear art, it looked very strong and powerful when Lin Xiu was brandishing his spear.

Block, take, jab.

Lin Xiu performed the basic actions of these spear arts skillfully and easily. As he waved under the moonlight, it felt as though this Silver Immortal Soul spear had a silver luster

It was the first time Xu Wen saw someone dancing with a spear and he danced perfectly at that.

No wonder Lin Xiu was so strong and progressing so quickly. Even when he was keeping watch at night, he didn’t waste any time and continued practicing.

“Okay, I’ll practice too!”

At this moment, Xu Wen was influenced by Lin Xiu and also took out his own weapon and began brandishing it.

Li Yi sat on the ground and folded his hands under his chin as he looked at the two men. His eyelids were drooping and saliva was dripping out of his mouth, as if he was about to fall asleep.

“Still training at this hour? Tsk tsk, when you don’t have enough strength, you’re dead.” In the dark, a figure appeared, looking at Lin Xiu from a distance.
