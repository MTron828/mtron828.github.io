Chapter 594: The Origin and the Truth

Soon, the surroundings became a vast expanse of white.

Moreover, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the pain in his body had completely disappeared, and his vision has become clearer.

“Looks like it’s really fake.” Lin Xiu pouted at this time, then stood up.

Looking down at the jade pendant on his neck, a touch of gentleness appeared in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

In this environment, everything was very real, but only when he found out that he still had the jade pendant that Luo Yue gave him hanging around his neck, Lin Xiu instantly come back to his senses and was sure that everything was an illusion.

It could be said that Luo Yue had helped him invisibly.

But this was a vast expanse of white, where exactly was he?

“Congratulations, you passed the test.”

At this moment, a voice that sounded a bit old came over.

Lin Xiu turned around abruptly and saw a man in a white robe with gray hair and a long beard.

“You are…”

When Lin Xiu saw him, his eyes were full of surprise.

“I’m the light.” The old man touched his beard, then said with a smile.

That light?

Hearing the old man’s words, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly.

“This tower came to the earth when we escaped from the planet Namir.”

The old man looked at Lin Xiu and continued to speak.

“You mean… the Tower of Trials was not built on Earth?”

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened at this time, and he said.

The information this old man gave was huge so Lin Xiu was still in a state of shock.

“Look.” The old man smiled, then waved his right hand. At this moment, the surrounding white scene became like a universe at the next moment.

Soon, the scene turned to an azure planet.

This planet looked a bit like Earth, but it’s not Earth.

On this planet, a battle broke out, countless warriors were fighting, and the entire planet was in chaos.

It seems that one side lost in the end, and then escaped in a jet-black super spaceship.

They tossed around in the universe, and finally came to Earth.

But at this time, the earth was going through a terrifying apocalyptic catastrophe. Those in the space battleship seemed to have been infected by some kind of virus and died one after another.

The last remaining young man, who seemed to have immunity to these viruses, survived.

Although this man was still in his infancy, because he has a lot of technological memory in his head, he has created a large number of intelligent robots and forged a huge island (actually a giant spaceship). In order to avoid being discovered, he put this island-like gigantic spaceship somewhere on Earth, using some kind of high-tech power to block satellite detection.

And the black spaceship was damaged due to flying in the universe and was later transformed into the so-called tower of trials.

At this time, the earth was still in the midst of a virus disaster. The man discovered that the earth was actually a world where skills could be learned, and then he began to spread those skills.

Although some common skills and cultivation methods were spread, the creativity of earthlings was really too powerful. Under the cultivation of basic skills, they slowly explored and created, and finally form a variety of powerful skills. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

And later, the era of warriors has officially arrived!

Many years went by, and at this time, the men headed by Baili Tao came to the island, and then began to establish the Sacred Region Academy.

But at this time, the old man had already died because of some kind of trauma to his body, and the middle-aged man who was guarding the library just now, dealt with everything here.

Lin Xiu looked at these as if he was watching a historical documentary, and his eyes were filled with a look of shock that could not be concealed.

“I have recently felt that the people of the Bai family have begun to discover that I am here.”

The old man looked at Lin Xiu and said.

The Bai family was a powerful warrior family on the planet Namir. It was the head of this family who killed all the members of the old man’s family.

The global battle that broke out at that time was led by their two families.

“Do they have the ability to break through space and teleport here?” Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something and said suddenly.

Because some time ago, under the sea area of this Sacred Region Academy, there was an intelligent robot that came from nowhere, broke through space, and then attracted monsters from other planets.

When he thought about it, Lin Xiu felt that everything suddenly became clear.

“It is impossible to transmit the power here from another planet.”

The old man shook his head and said.

“But if you use some kind of force from the earth to detect this place, it is possible.”

“They have their spies on earth.”

The old man spoke earnestly at this time.

Lin Xiu frowned at this time. The energy on that planet seemed to be very abundant, and the power of those warriors seemed to be much stronger than the earth.

The strength of those warriors, even ordinary ones, seemed to be able to reach rank 9. If those warriors came over, it would be a disaster for the earth!

“But don’t worry, the planet Namir is many light-years away from earth. It is not easy to find the earth accurately among many planets. I just have this hunch. After all, as long as my battleship is around, they could use technical means and sense the energy contained in it.”

The old man seemed to see what Lin Xiu was thinking, so he continued to speak.

“Then right now you…”

“Now? I am an energy body, an energy body that is about to disappear.” The old man laughed heartily.

“Why?”

Lin Xiu was startled, and then said subconsciously.

“Absorb my remaining energy and all the energy in the tower.” The old man stood in front of Lin Xiu at this time, and then said to Lin Xiu seriously.

Originally, Lin Xiu’s purpose was to absorb these energies, but after hearing the old man’s words and seeing everything just now, Lin Xiu seemed to have seen the old man’s life. At this time, he didn’t know why, but he didn’t really want to absorb the energy anymore.

“No, then you will disappear completely.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

This old man could be said to be the ancestor of all warriors on earth…

“Even if you don’t absorb my strength, I won’t be able to hang on for long. You are the most suitable candidate.”

“Also, absorb the power of the Tower of Trials.”

“But I have a request..”
