Chapter 765: Rank 10 Odd Crystal

Wan Qianshan’s figure slowly appeared in the sight of the crowd as he was catching his breath.

Wan Qianshan who was inside the ‘Yuan’ was already covered in sweat.

He looked incredibly exhausted.

“You already used such a large skill. You would have ran out of energy by now!”

Wan Qianshen wiped off the sweat on his forehead as he spoke to Lin Xiu. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Damn it. He might have successfully blocked the attack just now with his ‘Yuan’ but he could clearly feel that the power of it was overwhelming.

He felt as if his body was inside an oven.

His body felt as if he had been burnt and roasted even when he was protected inside his ‘Yuan’.

This brat’s strength was extraordinary.

“Huh? That was just a warm up.”

Wan Qianshan looked at where Lin Xiu was at. He could clearly see that Lin Xiu was still looking fine as if he didn’t use any strength.

When he saw Lin Xiu’s state, not only Wan Qianshan himself, even his men who were behind him were shocked.

The bigger the skilled use and the stronger it was, the amount of energy needed would be more as well.

But, Lin Xiu wasn’t even panting.

How was this possible?!

“Eh? Wan Qianshan, you’re the one who’s fighting?!”

Suddenly, a group of warrior appeared from another direction and spoke to Wan Qianshan.

“Guan Qian?” Wan Qianshan looked at the man who appeared and frowned.

This man wasn’t a simple person as well and it was someone who had bad blood with Wan Qianshan as well.

He turned to another side and noticed that there were other warriors walking towards them as well.

“Brat! How about a pause?”

Wan Qianshan was looking tired as he asked Lin Xiu.

“What do you think?”

Lin Xiu gave a provocative look towards Wan Qianshan as if all these were just a game to him.

“You wouldn’t win me.”

Wan Qianshan said bluntly.

“Maybe but I think with some help, I might.”

Lin Xiu peered at Guan Qian before answering Wan Qianshan.

When Wan Qianshan noticed Guan Qian and his men who were walking towards him, Lin Xiu noticed that there was something odd about the look on his face.

It seems like they weren’t on good terms.

“You…..” Wan Qianshan looked mad after hearing what Lin Xiu said.

Looks like Lin Xiu’s assumptions were right.

Wan Qianshan was definitely enemies with Guan Qian.

Wan Qianshan would not be able to promise that he would still be in his best state…..

No, it wouldn’t be possible.

In order to kill Lin Xiu, he would definitely get injured as well and that would put his life at risk.

“What do you want?”

Seeing how Guan Qian and his men were getting closer, Wan Qianshan asked in a soft voice.

“Offer something in exchange that is worth it for me to stop this fight.”

Lin Xiu offered.

Both of them lowered their voices and only those close to them could hear their conversation.

“You...”

“If you don’t want to, we shall continue then.”

Lin Xiu said coldly.

Wan Qianshan glared at Lin Xiu with rage before reaching into his pocket. He grabbed something from it and threw it to Lin Xiu.

Bakk – –

Lin Xiu caughted the item out of reflex.

It was an odd crystal; a high rank odd crystal.

“A rank 10 odd crystal. Is that enough?”

Wan Qianshan asked.

“Deal.”

Lin Xiu agreed to stop the fight.

Both of them slowly returned to their companions.

“Hahahahaha….Wan Qianshan, can’t you hear me?!”

At the same time, Guan Qian appeared right in front of him.

There was also a group of warriors following behind Guan Qian.

“Guan Qian? What do you want? You wanna fight me?”

Wan Qianshan glared at Guan Qian who suddenly appeared at the scene.

“Aren’t you fighting that boy over there? What’s wrong? Why did you stop?”

Guan Qian smiled as he asked.

“We were just fooling around. Did you really think it was a serious fight?”

Wan Qianshan sneered as he answered Guan Qian.

Guan Qian stared at Wan Qianshan as well and noticed that Wan Qianshan was still full of energy. He didn’t seem hurt at all.

“Hahahaha…..I was joking as well.” Guan Qian laughed out loud.

“What about you? Here on a suicide mission?”

Wan Shanqian continued speaking in a cold tone.

“Tsktsk….that is a raging flame lion. Who wouldn’t want a peek of it?”

On the other end, Lin Xiu had already returned to Liu Pan and his gang.

“Brother Lin, are you alright?”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was already back, he quickly asked out of concern.

An Qi and Qian Ling were staring at Lin Xiu as well.

“I’m fine.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“Plus….I even got this.”

As he answered them, Lin Xiu opened his right palm.

The rank 10 odd crystal that he just received was sitting carefully in his palm.

When the rest of them saw the crystal, they were surprised.

It was shining bright! It looked like an incredibly brilliant odd crystal and it was obvious that the glow of it belonged to a rank 10 odd crystal!

“That fella gave it to you?”

Liu Pan couldn’t help but ask.

“That’s right.”

Liu Xin laughed.

“Why would he give you...”

An Qi and Qian Ling were both confused and were in disbelief.

Both of them were still trying to kill each other a while ago but now….not only have they stopped fighting, Wan Qianshan even gave the crystal to Lin Xiu.

“This is great!”

“Wan Qianshan is a powerful man. I should have told grandfather to kill him.”

An Qi pursed her lips.

At the same time, there was a growing number of warriors that were heading their way.

“Looks like the game is getting fun.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he took a good look at the warriors around.

Most of them were rank 9 warriors, there wasn’t even one that was of rank 8.

In fact, even since he left Tianlong City, the average rank of the warriors around him have become stronger.

With such strength, they would have been able to destroy the entire planet if they were back on earth.

The warriors who were at the scene seemed to know each other as they started chatting.

“Everyone….looks like we have a huge crowd today. I am sure that everyone knows what we are here for.”

“The Raging Flame Lion.”

“That’s right. The Raging Flame Lion.”

A tall, muscular man walked out from the crowd as he looked at the warriors who were gathered together.

As he spoke, everyone around stopped talking and it became quiet.

All of them were looking at him.

“The president of the warrior union from the Southwest region, Qian Qiurong.”

An Qi seemed to know who this man was. When she saw the man, she subconsciously told the rest of her gang who he was.

“The Warrior Union?”

Lin Xiu was stunned when he heard this familiar term.
