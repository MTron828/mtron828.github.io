Chapter 862: Sword Breaks the Heaven! (1)

Hearing his daughter’s words, Luo Zhen’s eyes widened.

The people of his family belong to the powerful beings on that planet.

Lin Xiu, can he alone really crush their family?

But if it wasn’t for that, Luo Yue and Luo Yan wouldn’t have come back so easily.

If it wasn’t for Luo Yue’s life at stake, he would not have let his daughter go back.

“Yue’er, your hair...”

Luo Yue’s mother looked at Luo Yue’s hair and felt a little heart pain.

What happened this year?

boom boom boom —

But at this moment, the whole ground suddenly shook!

what happened!?

The expressions in the eyes of everyone who felt all this could not help but change slightly.

bang bang bang-

Soon, a large number of giant armored vehicles rolled over, directly crushing and destroying the surrounding walls of the Luo family.

There are a large number of warriors in all directions, surrounding the surroundings.

“Where’s Lin Xiu?”

At this time, an old man headed by walked in first, glanced at everyone and said aloud.

At this time, the Luo family was surrounded by groups and if you look closely, there are many aircraft flying high in the sky.

The muzzles of those laser cannons were all aimed down.

“Jiang Qian?”

When Bai Litao saw this man, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

Jiang Qian, a member of the Jiang family in Sky City, this year, he officially became the vice chairman of the World warrior union and his strength is very powerful.

“Bai Litao? Humph.”

Jiang Qian glanced at Bai Litao, then sneered.

“Where is that guy named Lin Xiu? If you don’t call him out, everyone will die.”

Hearing his words, Luo Zhen’s hands clenched tightly.

If it wasn’t for the fact that he was abolished on Marqi Planet before, with his strength, he could easily crush him.

But now, not.

“Scram.”

At this moment, Luo Yue glanced at him, then said lightly.

“Do you know who you are talking to?”

Jiang Qian’s expression became stern.

“You guys, now you are fighting against the entire warrior union!”

Tsk tsk, you Huaxia people are really stubborn. It seems that they don’t know the strength of people in other regions of the Warrior union.

At this time, several blond men came out, looking at Luo Yue with a mocking look.

They slowly walked over to Luo Yue, then took out the weapons behind them and they were about to make a move.

“Let us try the strength of you Chinese people!”

They laughed loudly as if they could see themselves killing Luo Yue and others in the next moment.

“Be careful!”

When Baili Haoling saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank a little.

The speed of these people is very fast.

Just when she was about to pull out her double knives to block in front of her, Luo Yue moved.

Whoosh whoosh—

As soon as the long sword came out, it instantly turned into countless rays of light, directly impacting the past. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

bang bang bang-

Those foreign warriors who were attacked had not had time to react and their bodies were torn apart in an instant!

When Jiang Qian saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes could not help but change slightly.

how can that be!

A single blow, just a single blow, even killed all the senior leaders of the World warrior union.

What terrifying strength is required to be able to do all this!?

“Kill them!”
