1153 Kneel Down

Lin Xiu looked at the situation with a puzzled look on his face.

“Come here!”

Just when Lin Xiu walked to the front, he heard a stern shout coming from the front.

“Save me, save me...”

At this moment, a man rolled and crawled over from the front.

Looking at Lin Xiu who just came over, as if he saw a lifesaver, he said with a trembling body.

“Hm?”

Lin Xiu looked at the man who fell behind and was startled.

The clothes on the man’s body were a bit tattered, and there were many scars on his body.

It looks like he was hit by a whip.

Snapped–

At this moment, a whip came from the front!

The whip rushed over very fast, and it was about to hit Lin Xiu’s face.

But at this moment, as Lin Xiu raised his hand, he grabbed the whip tightly.

The face of the man who swung the whip had a sudden change of expression.

He stretched out his hand, but found that the whip in his hand could not be pulled back at all.

“who are you!”

He stared at Lin Xiu with murderous intent in his eyes.

“City Lord.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly, and then said lightly.

City Lord!?

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the man was slightly startled.

Immediately, he sneered: “What a bastard city lord! Those who hinder the work of Tianlan Pavilion get slapped!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the warriors behind him rushed toward Lin Xiu.

They looked like they wanted to grab Lin Xiu.

“Get lost.”

When Lin Xiu saw this scene in his eyes, he immediately shouted.

With Lin Xiu’s loud shout, a terrifying power burst out, and those warriors who wanted to grab Lin Xiu were all blown away by this terrifying power!

bang bang bang-

Their bodies were slammed into the ground far away, making a dull sound.

From their mouths, a lot of blood spat out.

“You dare to attack our Tianlan Pavilion people, you’re courting death!!!”

The man with the whip shouted fiercely at this time.

Boom—

In the next moment, with Lin Xiu’s thoughts, a dark blue flame burst out from Lin Xiu’s hand.

At this moment, the whip in his hand burned directly.

The speed of this flame burning was too fast, and in the next moment, it was passed to his hand holding the whip.

“what!!!”

A burning sensation caused him to let out a scream of pain.

The blue flame instantly burned his hands and turned them black.

And these blue flames, at this moment, directly covered his whole body.

It seems that there is no way to extinguish it.

The man frantically rolled on the ground, screaming constantly.

“What do they want you guys to do?”

At this time, Lin Xiu said indifferently to the man hiding behind him.

The man was shocked by everything in front of him, and he still didn’t come back to his senses.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words at this time, his body trembled for a while, and then he quickly said, “They... they want us to dig source stones, and if we don’t, they will kill us...”

When the man said this, he seemed to think of some kind of terrifying experience, and his body trembled even more.

“En, you go.”

Lin Xiu said lightly. Ignoring the rest of the people, he looked directly over to Tianlan Pavilion.

It seems that there were still many things that he didn’t know about this Lingxian City.

Things seem to be getting more and more interesting.

As Lin Xiu went to the location that Mr. Pang told him, Lin Xiu was able to clearly see the huge building in front of him very quickly.

Compared to the shabby appearance of the City Lord’s Mansion, the buildings here look very grand. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Everything around is brand new, and it seems to be quite imposing.

Above the gate here, there are two big gilded characters ‘Tianlan Pavilion’.

“who are you?!”

When Lin Xiu just walked to the door, the guard of Tianlan Pavilion blocked Lin Xiu’s way.

“New arrival, City Lord.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the two guards glanced at Lin Xiu with a look of disdain in their eyes.

It seems that they didn’t care about Lin Xiu’s identity as the city lord.

Even the two gatekeepers had such an attitude, not to mention the rest of the people from Tianlan Pavilion.

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“Go in, Master is in Xiantian Mansion.”

The two guards said coldly to Lin Xiu at this time.

“Hmph, came empty-handed.”

One of the guards continued to speak coldly after watching Lin Xiu walk in.

Lin Xiu ignored their words and continued to walk in front.

The Tianlan Pavilion covers a very large area. Not long after Lin Xiu walked in, he saw a group of warriors approaching from the front.

“Newbie, Xiantian mansion is here.”

The warrior who took the lead said coldly to Lin Xiu at this time.

“Come with me!”

He shouted sharply.

Lin Xiu showed a sneer at the corner of his mouth.

These people from Tianlan Pavilion are really arrogant.

However, what caught Lin Xiu’s attention was that the leader of the group of warriors in front was obviously a warrior of the God warrior level.

Things seem to be getting more and more interesting.

At this time, Lin Xiu was still calm, and followed them to the front.

Soon, they reached the middle area of ??Tianlan Pavilion.

In the middle area, there is a huge building with two big characters ‘Xiantian Mansion’ written on it.

After walking into the lobby of Xiantian Mansion, Lin Xiu could see that in the middle of the lobby, there was an old man sitting there.

“Sir, we have brought him here.”

The God warrior walked over at this time and respectfully spoke to the old man.

“En.”

The old man was still drinking tea, but he put down the teacup in his hand and looked at Lin Xiu who walked in.

“New huh, not bad.”

The old man looked at Lin Xiu and said lightly.

“You’re the first to crush the wrist bones of the people I sent.”

“Kneel down!”

The God warrior just now looked at Lin Xiu standing here, still motionless, and said coldly.

But Lin Xiu still stood where he was, ignoring him.

“I told you to kneel down, did you hear me!”

At this moment, his face sank, and with a wave of his right hand, a burst of energy rushed towards Lin Xiu’s legs, wanting to hit him directly to his knees!

bang bang—

But at this moment, a faint source strength appeared on Lin Xiu’s legs, directly blocking his power completely!
