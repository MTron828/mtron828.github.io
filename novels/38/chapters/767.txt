Chapter 768: The Raging Flame Lion Reappears!

“Same situation.” Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

At this time, the leaders of various warrior groups all gathered at this time, then chatted with Qian Qiurong.

From the results of their conversation, it seemed that they have encountered those evolved beasts.

“It seems that that thing has appeared.” At this time, Qian Qiurong seemed to have a strange look in his eyes.

“What, did you hear anything?”

Lin Xiu was also among a group of warriors at this time, then he looked at Liu Pan, who trotted back from there and said.

“I heard that when the other warriors came over, they also encountered a large group of evolved beasts.”

Liu Pan said aloud at this time.

“And, also...”

“What is it?”

An Qi and Qian Lin also looked a little curious at this time.

“I heard that the evolved beasts they encountered just now seem to have become stronger.”

“From a low-level evolved beast, it suddenly became stronger and violent.”

Liu Pan said lightly at this time.

“Could there be something ahead that affects the changes of these evolved beasts...”

An Qi and Qian Lin also said subconsciously at this time.

“Should be.”

Lin Xiu looked into the distance, narrowed his eyes and said.

Interesting, it seems to be getting more and more interesting.

Soon, everyone rested here for a while, then continued to move forward.

When they walked to the front, they really did not encounter any evolved beasts.

But there was an even more disturbing feeling around.

It seems to be more and more dangerous.

There are more and more warriors coming and it was crowded.

“In front, it should be in front.”

At this time, Qian Qiurong’s face became even more serious.

Not only Qian Qiu Rong, but even many warriors seemed to feel something and their faces became serious at this time.

“Brother Lin, do you feel it?

Liu Pan looked at the front and said.

“I felt it...”

A sense of oppression, a very powerful sense of oppression, came from the corner in front.

This sense of oppression was too strong, so strong that Lin Xiudu subconsciously clenched the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

And apart from this terrifying oppression, the surrounding environment seems to have become extremely hot.

boom boom boom —

And at this time, the tremor, which had already stopped long ago, started again.

clack clack——

On the surrounding stone walls, a lot of rocks fell down.

“Careful!!!”

After a warrior shouted, a huge roar came over!

Lin Xiu, who was at the back, looked at the front and he clearly saw a huge figure appearing!

Roar–

A deafening sound, at this moment, as if the entire space was shaken.

A huge figure rushed over directly!

Raging Flame Lions!!!

Some of the warriors in the front reacted a little slower and the Raging flaming lion that rushed over smacked them into slugs in an instant!

After some rank 9 warriors unfolded the ‘Sphere’, even the ‘Sphere’ was almost destroyed.

In just an instant, dozens of warriors died instantly!

Although thousands of warriors gathered here, dozens of them died in an instant and they were all high-level warriors.

Roar–

As if these warriors broke into its domain, it continued to roar at this time and the claws full of flames slapped the surrounding warriors again!

bang bang bang-

Loud noises also rang out continuously at this time.

However, there were still many warriors who reacted very fast and avoided it.

“Don’t panic everyone, let’s use skills to attack together!”

Qian Qiurong roared loudly at this time, took the lead in leaping into the air, held the long sword in his hand and directly released his skills in the air to attack the Raging Flame Lion!

There are nearly 10,000 warriors gathered here. Most of the warriors also reacted when they heard Qian Qiurong’s words, holding the weapons in their hands and they counterattacked!

With so many people attacking at the same time, even if this is an evolved beast at the peak of the king level, they believe it won’t last long!

“what should we do!?”

Looking at all kinds of warriors with their source strength bursting out as they attacked the Raging Flame Lion, Liu Pan couldn’t help but say aloud.

“Wait and see.”

Lin Xiu and the others found a corner, looked at the battle over there and said aloud.

The battle situation is really too intense. Among the nearly 10,000 warriors, there are still quite a few warriors with decent strength.

At this time, as they all released their most powerful skills, the surrounding space seemed to be filled with brilliance.

boom boom boom —

A loud noise continued to sound and the entire ground shook crazily again.

Roar–

The Raging Flame Llion was attacked by so many warriors at the same time and it seemed to become even angrier at this time.

As it roared loudly, a black shadow that was visible to the naked eye suddenly appeared from above the mountain peaks on both sides.

And there were increasingly more of these black shadows, it seems that something was flying over here.

“Look over there!”

Lin Xiu was stunned at this moment, looked over there and saw those things in an instant.

The dense dark shadows got bigger and bigger as they got closer.

“Killer bees!”

Seeing these things, Qian Lin immediately recognized them.

These bees are the size of a human head, with a black body and some colored markings on their bodies.

The most eye-catching thing is that on its front and tail, there is also a sharp needle that looks very sharp.

“Blue Flame Bird...Monitor Lizard Beast…”

And at this time, not only these killer bees but also many other evolved beasts rushed down from the cliffs on both sides!

The number of these evolved beasts seems to be very large, making people feel terrified.

Many warriors around, seeing this scene at this time, could not help but change their expressions slightly.

Almost the vast majority of warriors above the master warrior level were fighting the Raging Flame Lions.

And some warriors who originally wanted to hide and take advantage of the situation had a change of expression when they saw this scene.

Originally, they wanted to hide their strength.

Damn it!

As these evolved beasts charge down, whether they want to or not, at this time they have to take out their weapons and fight against these evolved beasts.

“Kill!!!”

Liu Pan’s eyes also turned red at this time as the killer bee flew over to him and was instantly cut in half by his double-sided axe!

“Stab!”

Lin Xiu looked at An Qi and Qian Lin and said loudly.
