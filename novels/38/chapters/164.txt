Chapter 165: You’re Laughing

The kiss stunned Lin Xiu.

He cried to himself ‘what bad luck’ in his heart, he was truly seeking death.

His head was almost chopped off by the lass the last time, but he actually did such a thing.

But what made Lin Xiu confused was that Luo Yue did not have a reaction.

She continued to carry him and walk.

Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief. ‘She shouldn’t have discovered it right?’

What Lin Xiu did not see was Luo Yue’s gaze had changed. With a turn, Lin Xiu fell to the ground.

“Hey…”

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide only to see his clothes being pulled as he got dragged on the floor.

Revenge had come!

“Don’t!” Lin Xiu screamed.

But Luo Yue ignored his words and continued to pull him as though she was pulling luggage.

They finally arrived at the villa through many difficulties with Lin Xiu’s clothes torn and tattered. He looked as though he had gone through a lot.

‘I knew it, she won’t let me off so easily!’

Lin Xiu glared at her.

But Luo Yue ignored him and walked to the living room and started to train with her sword.

“It wasn’t intentional..” Lin Xiu called out weakly.

Upon hearing his words, Luo Yue’s usual calm and white face was flushed with a faint pink that disappeared right away.

“Shut up.” Luo Yue glared at him.

Lin Xiu quickly covered his mouth and acted innocent.

Puchi-

Upon seeing his actions, Luo Yue could not help but laugh out loud.

“You’re laughing…” Lin Xiu was stunned when he saw her new expression.

It was his first time seeing her smile and it was completely unlike her usual cold expression. Her facial expression felt warm.

But this smile lasted for a second and she regained herself in the next moment.

After showering and changing into a new set of clothes, Lin Xiu walked over to the training ground in the living room and started practicing with Dark Edge Spear.

“Let’s spar.” Luo Yue suddenly requested.

She thrust her sword forward without waiting for him to reply.

Lin Xiu had mostly recovered from the aftereffect of Fury and quickly blocked Luo Yue’s attack.

Clang-

The spear and sword moved extremely quickly and produced metal sounds every time they collided.

Luo Yue’s eyes revealed a faint hint of surprise.

Lin Xiu’s display of strength seemed to be far stronger than what he was the day before.

As a warrior’s rank became higher, training and cultivating became even more difficult. Lin Xiu’s increase in strength was a tad exaggerated.

“Damn, slow down.” But Lin Xiu still felt that Luo Yue’s attack was too serious.

He had the feeling that he could not ward off her attacks.

She did not use any skills and only utilized the basics of sword arts.

But she had trained the basics so well that she was proficient in it. Adding the strength she used while attacking Lin Xiu felt his palms turning slightly numb while holding Dark Edge.

Clang-

Right at the next moment, Luo Yue grasped the opportunity and attempted to throw his weapon off!

Lin Xiu reacted in time and counterattacked!

The two collided again and produced a loud metallic sound.

“Your spear art is good.” Luo Yue commented indifferently.

“Of course.”

“Right, you practiced Rupturing Fist before?” Lin Xue suddenly recalled her fists that sent a few warriors flying.

Luo Yue nodded and placed her sword at the side.

“Continue.”

Lin Xiu thought for a moment and threw Dark Edge onto the weapon rack.

The two looked at each other and moved at the same time as though they had telepathic powers!

Luo Yue was extremely fast and matched with her strange body arts, she moved around like a white figure.

Bang-

Before Lin Xiu could react, he was punched at the back. The immense pain caused him to grit his teeth.

“Do not be bound entirely with your eyes, use your body to feel.” Luo Yue spoke up indifferently.

As soon as she said that, another fist came towards him.

Lin Xiu did not expect that a young lady like Luo Yue could explode with so much power at close combat.

She was even stronger than those big brutes.

After taking in a few punches, Lin Xiu gradually calmed down.

He recalled the feeling when avoiding the laser beams in the gravity room. Slowly, he started to avoid Luo Yue’s unending punches.

At this moment, Lin Xiu was not using his eyes to capture the movements but relied on his body’s instincts and the flow of air around him to dodge the attacks.

Luo Yue’s eyes revealed surprise. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

From being unable to retaliate to being able to completely avoid her attacks, it was too shocking.

Remember, Lin Xiu was only a rank 3 warrior while she was a rank 4 warrior.

This 1 rank level was supposedly enough to overwhelm Lin Xiu, but she realized that she was unable to do it.

Just a few months ago when she first met Lin Xiu at District A20, he was not even at rank 1.

‘How did he do it? To grow a rank a month?!’

“Haha, it’s my turn to attack now!” Lin Xiu sent out a fist towards Luo Yue who was distracted by the thoughts in her head. By the time she reacted, Lin Xiu’s fist was on her!

She subconsciously grabbed his wrist.

Lin Xiu was startled because the punch had to land at her chest of all places.

Although Luo Yue had held onto his wrist, his fist was slightly in contact with her bulging breasts.

A soft feeling was transmitted through his fist.

The two froze as though time had stopped.

Rollie rolled out for some reason and onto the table where it started to bite on a crystal and look at them curiously.

“It was not intentional.” Lin Xiu swallowed saliva and spoke up.

“I know.”

“So you can’t hit me.”

“En.”

Lin Xiu sighed with relief but in the next moment, he found his body being pulled across.

‘I will rather believe that there are ghosts in the world than to believe the words of a woman!!!’
