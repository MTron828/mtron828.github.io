1429 Furious Lin Xiu

In the next moment, Lin Xiu’s figure suddenly appeared in Lingxian City!

Thank you readers!

“So simple?!”

Lin Xiu was surprised.

This Spatial Magic Cube seems to be able to locate the coordinates with its own memory, directly break open the space and teleport itself there!

But like this, it seems to be consuming my own strength.

At this time, with a thought, the Spatial Magic Cube disappeared in his hands.

Lin Xiu moved and flew directly to the city lord’s mansion.

“Luo Yue?”

When Lin Xiu just flew back to the courtyard, he found that Luo Yue’s figure seemed to have disappeared.

Not only Luo Yue, but Xiao Bai and Rollie who were sleeping in the courtyard also disappeared!

Lin Xiu frowned, obviously having a bad premonition.

“City Lord!?”

At the same time, Lei Tong’s voice also came from behind.

“Lei Tong, have you seen Luo Yue?”

Seeing Lei Tong’s arrival, Lin Xiu nodded immediately and then said.

At this time, Lei Tong hurriedly said: “It’s not good, it’s not good. A group of people wanted to arrest her today, but they have disappeared now.”

“Where did they go!?”

“They went in this direction…”

As Lei Tong pointed, Lin Xiu’s figure flew into the air.

It disappeared in an instant.

Looking at this scene, Lei Tong opened his mouth slightly.

Lin Xiu’s figure flew in the sky. At this moment, when he moved his mind, he sensed everywhere.

At this moment, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the energy fluctuation left over from the battle at that time.

Following these clues, he quickly flew to the front.

Damn it!

Someone took advantage of his absence to catch Luo Yue!

Unforgivable.

Lin Xiu’s face became extremely cold.

At this time, he kept flying forward and after a while, he could see that there was an ocean in front.

But Luo Yue’s aura was no longer around.

The position he was in now seems to have had a very powerful existence.

“Um?”

Taking a closer look at this moment, Lin Xiu seemed to see a familiar figure in the ocean below.

Without the slightest hesitation, Lin Xiu flew down directly.

At this moment, if you look closely, you can clearly see Xiaobai’s body floating on the ocean.

“Lin…Xiu.”

At this time, Rollie’s body also floated up to the surface of the ocean.

“Are you okay?”

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu said nervously.

With a thought, Lin Xiu stretched out his hand on their bodies and suddenly a white light began to spread out.

It is directly transmitted to their bodies.

Both Xiaobai and Rollie were injured. At this time, as Lin Xiu’s power passed over, their physical injuries began to heal slowly at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Crash——

At this moment, Xiaobai’s body flapped its wings in the sea water and then slowly flew up.

Rollie’s body also recovered from the injuries at this time and flew up from the sea water at this time.

“Xiaobai, get out, do you know where Luo Yue has gone?”

At this time, Lin Xiu spoke to the two evolved beasts.

“Yes.”

Rollie said in a childish voice at this time.

“Take me there.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were full of killing intent.

At the same time, Hetian Divine Domain.

“Hetian God King is the most powerful being in this Divine Domain, what are you still thinking about?”

At this moment, Ling Tianxi was in a room, speaking to Luo Yue.

Next to this room, there was already a wedding dress beside it.

“Be good, put it on for me.”

At this moment, Ling Tianxi saw Luo Yue not paying any attention to her and her eyes also became ugly.

“You can marry him if you like.”

Luo Yue said coldly.

“You wanna die!”

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, the look in Ling Tianxi’s eyes immediately became gloomy and cold.

A long sword with condensed source strength suddenly appeared in her hand.

Pointing directly at Luo Yue’s forehead.

But there was still no fear in Luo Yue’s eyes.

She stared at Ling Tianxi.

“Don’t forget, you are cultivating in our sect! It’s time for you to make some contributions to our sect.”

“You killed 30 of my God warriors from the Law Enforcement Team, you are capable huh.”

When Ling Tianxi said this, her face became even nastier.

At the same time, with Rollie leading, Lin Xiu also arrived at the gate of the Hetian Divine Domain.

The gate of the Hetian Divine Domain was very large and there was a group of God warrior-level guards guarding it.

“Who is it!”

Seeing Lin Xiu fly over, the surrounding guards immediately blocked Lin Xiu’s way.

“Felt it.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath at this time.

It was obvious that there was Luo Yue’s aura here.

Someone clearly removed her aura just now.

It’s just that Lin Xiu is a little curious. If this is the case, how did Rollie know?

At this time, Xiaobai became like a little bird, standing on Lin Xiu’s shoulder, Rollie also became smaller.

“Go away.”

Lin Xiu ignored these people and went in directly.

“Courting death!”

At this moment, the expressions of these guards became ugly.

With a low growl, they held the weapons in their hands and attacked Lin Xiu!

Whoosh—

But at this moment, with a wave of Lin Xiu’s right hand, the Dark Edge spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand instantly.

The moment their weapons attacked, they were directly interrupted by the Dark Edge spear!

How can this be!?

These God warrior guards watched their weapons being cut off in an instant and their eyes were full of disbelief.

Before they could react, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand continued to dance.

Instantly killed these God warriors!

At the same time, all the rest of the fighters guarding the gate of Hetian Divine Domain all attacked Lin Xiu!

Whoosh whoosh——

While Lin Xiu flew forward, the Dark Edge spear in his hand kept attacking these people.

In a short moment, all these guards were killed, not a single one was left!

At this moment, Lin Xiu stepped directly into the Hetian Divine Domain.

“Report to the Divine King! The Divine Gate has fallen!”

At the same time, on the other side of the main hall of God King Hetian, some warriors rushed over here.

“What happened!?”

God King Hetian was in the main hall, discussing matters with other gods, when he heard the warrior who came to report, his expression became extremely ugly.

Someone actually dared to come to the Hetian Divine Domain! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

And even broke through his divine gate!

Shame! This is definitely a disgrace to any god king!
