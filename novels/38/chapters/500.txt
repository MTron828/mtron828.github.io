Chapter 501: Help Luo Yue Take A Bath?

“Could it be that some forces entered the Bai Di City!?”

Some people’s expressions changed drastically when they saw this scene.

If that was the case, people like them would feel threatened too.

They couldn’t imagine that this powerful tyrannical mercenary group was destroyed by Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

They thought that another group more terrifying than the mercenary group had entered Bai Di City! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

And the people killed the Tiger Mercenary Group like they were killing a chicken.

For a while, everyone felt insecure.

Lin Xiu didn’t know what was happening here and had already gone to the other side.

In a hotel nearby, Lin Xiu booked a room and put Luo Yue on the bed.

The blood on her body soon stained the white quilt.

But Lin Xiu didn’t care because the quilt was not worth much.

Luo Yue was still sleeping like a baby and looked unusually cute.

But Lin Xiu remembered Luo Yue’s expression just now and it was a vast difference from her usual.

Luo Yue was like a murderous machine with no emotion at all.

Lin Xiu shook his head and didn’t think so much. He took out the restoration fluid that he had just bought from the drugstore and wiped off the blood on Luo Yue’s arm, then began to slowly pour the restoration fluid on her wound.

Although the wounds have closed up and no blood was flowing out, it was still impossible to recover so quickly.

The restoration fluid Lin Xiu bought was top-notch. At this moment, as the restoration fluid poured on Luo Yue’s arm, the wounds began to heal at a speed visible to the naked eye and it even formed a scab.

The wound was not too deep and should be healed soon.

Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief when he saw this.

He glanced at the new clothes he had just bought at the hotel and at the bloodstain on Luo Yue’s body. Then, hesitated for a moment and walked over to the bathroom with Luo Yue in his arms.

Luo Yue’s clothes were covered in blood – it should be quite uncomfortable with it sticking to her body.

“I’m just rinsing it off for you, it’s not on purpose.” Lin Xiu said to the sleeping Luo Yue.

But seeing Luo Yue’s face, Lin Xiu still felt guilty.

He slowly removed the buttons of the white clothes on her body and saw her delicate collarbone.

Moving down, he could see a touch of white.

“See no evil, see no evil.”

Lin Xiu swallowed but continued to mutter.

Soon, Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and removed Luo Yue’s clothes and pants swiftly.

At this time, Luo Yue was only wearing a singlet and panties.

Although there was still blood on Lin Xiu’s body, Lin Xiu felt parched for some reason.

Luo Yue’s figure was really good, except that she was a little flat somewhere.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and abandoned all other thoughts as he held the shower head, then helped Luo Yue wash away the blood from her body.

Soon after that, Lin Xiu used a special dryer on the side to dry Luo Yue’s singlet and panties, then quickly took the new clothes he bought and put them on. Then, he threw away the blood-stained quilt, replaced it with another quilt from the cabinet, and tucked Luo Yue in.

“Phew…” After he was done, Lin Xiu sat on the ground, panting.

Lin Xiu had used too much energy during the fight and was also a little tired at the moment, and he slowly fell asleep next to the bed.

More than an hour has passed. Luo Yue, who was sleeping on the bed, had her eyelashes trembling slightly, and she opened her eyes slowly.

Looking at where she was, her expression suddenly changed, and she got up suddenly as if she was about to jump off the bed.

But when she got up halfway, Luo Yue found Lin Xiu asleep next to the bed.

Lin Xiu sat on the floor with his hands on the side of the bed and his head in his arms.

He seemed to be too sleepy and hadn’t woken up.

Seeing this scene, Luo Yue was stunned, as if she remembered what had just happened.

She looked down at her body and found that her clothes seemed to have been changed, her face turned red, and glared at Lin Xiu.

But there was no anger in her eyes, only shame.

If Lin Xiu saw her teenage girl kind of expression, he would probably be in disbelief.

Luo Yue, who has always shown a straight face would actually have this expression?

She took a closer look at this time and found that only her clothes outside were changed and Lin Xiu hadn’t changed anything else of hers.

She knew that she was probably covered in blood so Lin Xiu helped her to wash it off in order to make her feel comfortable and rest.

After Luo Yue heaved a sigh of relief, she seemed to feel a little strange again.

This strange feeling made Luo Yue wonder what was going on.

“Hey…you’re awake…” Although Lin Xiu was very tired, but he was not in deep sleep and also woke up at this time and stretched.

Luo Yue didn’t speak, her eyes were fixed on Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu quivered at this moment and was completely awake in an instant, then explained to Luo Yue, “I saw that you were covered in blood, so I washed it off for you, I didn’t molest you deliberately…”

Lin Xiu was really afraid that Luo Yue would raise the sword again.

Pffff——

But at this moment, Luo Yue who was staring at Lin Xiu suddenly smiled.

Looking at Luo Yue’s smile, Lin Xiu was stunned.

Her smile could overthrow a city.

When the two of them made eye contact, they seemed to freeze.

But this situation lasted only for a while and Lin Xiu’s phone rang.

Luo Yue seemed to have realized that she was in a strange state at this time and turned her head to look at the other side.

“Ahem, you have quite a pretty… smile.” Lin Xiu smiled and said, at this time, he also took out his mobile phone.

It was a call from Ye Shuang’er.

“Come to the West Industrial Zone before 4 o’clock.” Just when Lin Xiu answered the phone, there was a deep voice on the other end of the phone.

Lin Xiu was startled, isn’t this Ye Shuang’er’s mobile phone number? How come…

“Who are you!!!”
