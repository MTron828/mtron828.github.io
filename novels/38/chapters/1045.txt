Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

They were on the verge of death because of the explosion of the matrix just now. At this time, with the fire of hell, they all died in the next moment.

Burned to charcoal by flames.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for killing the Sage warrior-level warriors and gaining experience 867570967…”

“…”

At this moment, there was a system prompt of experience gained in his mind.

Taking a closer look, the entire experience progress bar has risen to sixty or seventy percent!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu was also excited.

If it goes on like this, if he killed a few more Sage warrior-level warriors like this, then he would be able to level up again.

At the Sage warriorlevel, every level up was extremely difficult.

“Damn!”

At this moment, because of the after-effects of ‘Fury’, a sense of dizziness came, causing Lin Xiu’s body to fall directly to the ground. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Exhausted.

Damn, he almost forgot the time of ‘Fury’, it has already begun to disappear.

But fortunately, the surrounding warriors were all killed, so there was nothing to worry about.

so tired…

An extremely tired feeling came and Lin Xiu slowly closed his eyes.

The artificial angel’s eyes also had purple light blooming at this time.

She stood up, then walked over to Lin Xiu and sat beside Lin Xiu.

She seemed to be protecting Lin Xiu.

White light.

At this moment, Lin Xiu saw a white light.

But this white light soon began to slowly disappear.

Then he saw the surrounding scene.

On this mountain, a woman with long white hair was waving the long sword in her hand day after day.

“Luo Yue!!!”

Looking at the familiar back, Lin Xiu suddenly shouted loudly.

It’s just that when he said the words, he suddenly woke up.

When he opened his eyes, he found that the surrounding sky had become pitch black.

Night had fallen.

Lin Xiu could clearly feel that his strength had completely recovered.

“Huh, I actually slept for so long.”

Lin Xiu shook his head at this time, a look of surprise in his eyes.

Generally, after using ‘Fury’, the after-effects only took a while.

Unexpectedly, this time, he actually fell asleep directly.

And the picture in the dream was obviously Luo Yue.

With this thought, Lin Xiu looked down at the moon-shaped jade pendant around his neck and Lin Xiu held it.

Feeling the residual warmth from this jade pendant, it seemed as if Luo Yue was beside him.

“Let’s set off.”

Lin Xiu stood up at this time, looked around and said aloud.

The artificial angel also stood up slowly at this time and followed Lin Xiu.

Bai Di City, now Lin Xiu is going to Bai Di City,

Where the Orchid of Heaven was at also happened to be in the direction of Bai Di City.

Lin Xiu also wanted to see what the Bai Di City was like.

At this time, riding the artificial angel, he quickly flew to the Bai Di City.

Baidi City was very far away from this place. Although the artificial angel was flying very fast, they only arrived at Bai Di City in the early morning.

Baidi City was an extremely huge city.

At this time, from a distance, Lin Xiu could see the bustling scene of the Bai Di City.

“What a thick source strength in the air…”

Lin Xiu looked at this city and was surprised.

Because he could feel the strong source strength fluctuations coming from there.

This source strength fluctuation was really too strong.

It was richer than any city in the planet Namir where Lin Xiu was before.

However, in the airspace above Bai di City, you can clearly see that there were many flying machines patrolling the sky.

Some powerful warriors stood on those flying machines.

Seems like he couldn’t ride on the artificial angel and fly in…

As soon as his thoughts were triggered, he controlled the artificial angel to stay in a deep mountain on the other side.

Lin Xiu looked at the Bai Di City at this time, thought for a while, then walked straight ahead.

“Stop!”

Just when Lin Xiu was about to walk in, the warriors guarding the door immediately blocked Lin Xiu’s way.

Peak respected warrior.

Taking the lead, the warrior standing in the middle turned out to be a warrior at the Sage warrior level.

This made Lin Xiu a little surprised.

Now, are there such strong warriors even for those who guard the city gate?

You must know that in the cities where Lin Xiu lived, there were almost no sage warriors.

There were only five sage warriors in Wildfire City, except for Sima Qiang, and all of them have been killed by Lin Xiu.

Could it be that the cities where Lin Xiu had gone before were rural cities?

With this thought, Lin Xiu was a little dumbfounded.

“I’m talking to you! Do you hear me!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu did not answer his words at this time, one of the guards frowned and reached out to push Lin Xiu.

However, Lin Xiu, who had regained his senses, turned his body slightly to the side and easily avoided him.

“I’m here to play.”

Lin Xiu said with a smile at this time.

“Play?”

The guard stared at Lin Xiu for a while, then said coldly, “You can’t simply play at any city.”

“Come here for an inspection.”

He said coldly at this time.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly and walked over at this time.

There seems to be a huge machine at this gate.

When a warrior passes this way, the system will scan it.

The information of a person was easily scanned.

At this time, Lin Xiu walked over and when a red light swept across Lin Xiu’s body, he could clearly see Lin Xiu’s figure on the projection on the screen over there.

The above shows Lin Xiu’s various functions, as well as the comprehensive strength, whether he committed a crime in Baidi City and other information.

“Junior respected warrior, hng.”

Just now, the guard looked at Lin Xiu’s strength level displayed on the screen and couldn’t help sneering.

It seems to him that a warrior of the Respected warrior level was not worth mentioning at all.

Could it be that the Respected warrior-level warriors were flooding the streets already.

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu felt speechless for a while.

After all, when he was on Marqi Planet before, the Respected warrior-level warrior was an invincible existence.

“What are you looking at, get in quickly!”

The warrior guarding the door said coldly to Lin Xiu at this time.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly, then walked directly into the Bai Di City.

Unlike the cities he had been to before, this Bai Di City had very wide streets.

And there are a lot of people coming in and out, it looks very lively.
