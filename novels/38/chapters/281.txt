Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu walked cautiously, staring at his surroundings.

The corpses were everywhere and Lin Xiu also discovered that some warriors had killed each other by hacking each other with weapons.

?

It appeared that there was a huge battle here previously.

It should have been a battle between warriors, it wasn’t some evolved beast that killed these warriors here.

“Let’s go.” After Lin Xiu looked around for a moment, he said to Guo Ling and the others behind.

This battle probably happened three days ago and now some corpses were starting to have maggots, which looked very disgusting.

“Hmm, let’s go.” Guo Ling nodded.

At this moment, everyone continued to move forward and soon reached the other side. They saw that there were still many corpses in front. The corpses of some warriors were soaking in the river not far away. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Many corpses of evolved beasts began appearing. The corpses of these evolved beasts were very huge, their heads had been chopped off and blood flowed into the river.

That was why Lin Xiu and the others saw the fresh blood in the river downstream.

“These warriors were probably rank 6 or 7, how did they die, what happened here…” Chen Jin looked at the corpses of the warriors and muttered.

And now they saw the corpses of evolved beasts as well. It seemed like the evolved beasts had a fierce battle with the warriors here.

He wondered if there were Odd crystals in their corpses?

But when he recalled the strange liquid on the Odd crystals just now, Chen Jin gave up the idea.

The situation here was too weird to act rashly.

“If I didn’t guess wrongly, these people were probably fighting over the Ice Lotus Fire.” Lin Xiu said aloud at this time.

From the information he got before, the appearance of this weird Ice Lotus Fire in the Dark Forest lured many warriors to enter the Dark Forest.

“Ice Lotus Fire? Is that thing really worth fighting with so many people?” Qiu Li subconsciously said when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

There were countless high-ranking warriors and evolved beasts that died and it wasn’t even an exaggeration to call it a bloodbath.

It turned out to be for the so-called Ice Lotus Fire.

“Of course it is worth it. Even a rank 9 warrior wants it – what do you think?” Guo Ling glanced at Qiu Li and said.

Then she hesitated for a while and continued to say, “But we still have to complete our mission first. It is impossible for us to fight over this Ice Lotus Fire with them.”

Chen Jin and the others nodded at the same time when they heard Guo Ling’s words.

These warriors were of a higher rank than them and there were so many terrifying evolved beasts that died in order to get this thing. If it were them, they would probably die.

Ice Lotus Fire...

Lin Xiu was a little interested in this thing and felt that this thing must be an energy body that was even more terrifying than the Red Lotus Fire.

Lin Xiu’s lit up when he thought of the increase in strength brought about by the Red Lotus Fire that he had absorbed before.

If he has a chance, he must see where the Ice Lotus Fire is now.

“Let’s continue walking.” Guo Ling said, seeing the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

She saw a hint of danger in Lin Xiu’s eyes, he seemed to be interested in the Ice Lotus Fire?

“En.” Lin Xiu’s eyes also returned to normal at this time, then he nodded and said aloud.

The group of people continued to walk forward. After walking out of this side, they suddenly found that the corpses were gone and the pungent bloody smell in the air had completely disappeared.

“Hu.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath. The air over there just now was too unpleasant. Lin Xiu felt refreshed when he reached this area.

Now the road here has become more and more rugged, surrounded by towering rocks and what was even weirder were the trees that looked like huge umbrellas.

It was as if they arrived in ancient times, just looking at them made Lin Xiu feel apprehensive.

Time passed quickly and the sky, which was not very bright, became even more gloomy at this time.

“Are we there yet?” After reaching this side, Lin Xiu saw a huge crack on the ground in front of him and it was pitch black as if it was bottomless.

If they wanted to reach the other side, they just had to sprint with all their strength and it shouldn’t be a problem.

“It’s here.” Guo Ling walked over, stared at the huge crack in front, and said aloud.

‘Here?’

Lin Xiu was taken aback. He looked down and took out one of his high-beam flashlights from the backpack.

“Don’t shine into it.” When Lin Xiu was about to use the high beam flashlight to shine down, Guo Ling’s eyes changed and stopped Lin Xiu immediately.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Xiu was a little confused.

“The Black Tooth Spiders live on the cliff below.” Guo Ling explained.

“The bright light is very stimulating to them and once it shines on them, they will rush up like moths darting into a fire.”

While listening to Guo Ling’s explanation, Qiu Li and the others began to take things out of their backpacks.

‘What!?’

Lin Xiu looked at the weird things they took out of the backpack and become curious.

“A flamethrower, as you know, these things in the Dark Forest are all afraid of fire.” Guo Ling said.

This was also why she liked Lin Xiu’s ability and asked him to come to the Dark Forest together.

But to Guo Ling’s surprise, Lin Xiu’s skill was so terrifying that she was also shocked.

She was glad that she found Lin Xiu to complete this task together.

“Flamethrower ah…” Lin Xiu nodded at this time, it seemed that they were indeed ready.

But are these Black Tooth Spiders really so easy to deal with?

At this time, Guo Ling and the others were ready with their mini flamethrowers and held them in their hands.

“Do you want one?” Guo Ling looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

“No need.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said. He was getting stronger and stronger and using source strength to create the Red Lotus Fire was very simple.

Guo Ling nodded. Of course, she knew how strong Lin Xiu was and was merely asking casually.

“Begin!” Guo Ling looked at Qiu Li and the others who were standing beside her and called out.
