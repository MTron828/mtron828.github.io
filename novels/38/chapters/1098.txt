Lin Xiu held tightly onto his long spear.

The four sage warriors who were standing at each corner were still motionless as they stared at the scene before them. Even when the warriors from the Bai family were getting killed, they still didn’t do anything.

It was obvious that there was something peculiar about them.

Lin Xiu was trying to be cautious as well.

“Move back. Battles at such levels will only kill an idiot like you!”

!!

Elder Bai stared at Lin Xiu as he muttered to himself.

“Yes, yes…”

After hearing what Elder Bai said, Chen Jing nodded his head and retreated to the back.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

However, at the same time, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared out of nowhere.

Chen Jing trembled. When he had the time to react, he noticed that there was a dim, golden glow around his body.

He was a sage warrior after all. So, he could quickly react by activating his own skills, allowing his body to be teleported to the other corner of the room.

What was this?!

As he looked behind him, he noticed that there was a semi-transparent golden array that was on the ground where he was standing at previously.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

He didn’t even get the chance to breathe when a large number of arrays suddenly appeared all around him.

Even when Chen Jing’s reflexes were quick, his body was still trapped inside the arrays.

“Let me out!”

Chen Jing was struggling like mad but he soon noticed that there were no ways where he would be able to escape from this array!

Elder Bai also noticed that there was an obvious black source mark that appeared on Lin Xiu’s forehead.

This must be the energy of Lin Xiu’s source mark.

Was this a spatial source mark?

Elder Bai was starting to feel that Lin Xiu’s abilities were peculiar.

But, without much hesitation, his body shifted and he appeared right in front of Lin Xiu.

He held onto the sword with his left hand and was about to chop Lin Xiu’s body in two parts!

He wanted to just chop this man into two!

Clang – –

Lin Xiu raised the long spear above his head and blocked the attack.

Then, with the energy in his body, he blasted them and sent Elder Bai flying into the distance.

Following that, before Elder Bai could react, the long spear that was in Lin Xiu’s hands was already coming at him.

Elder Bai’s face turned pale as he started a fight with Lin Xiu and his long spear.

He slowly transferred the energy into his sword. The body of the long sword that was pitch black was slowly replaced by a bright, white light.

Soon, the entire body of it that was black slowly started glowing with a bright light.

As for Lin Xiu who was fighting this sword with his long spear, Lin Xiu could feel that there was a terrifying sword aura that came from Elder Bai.

This caused all of the skin on Lin Xiu’s arms to break.

It was such a terrifying sword aura!

However, it was only the superficial skin that broke and soon, they were quickly healing on their own.

Now, Lin Xiu was transferring his energy onto his long spear and soon the entire body of the long spear turned transparent like glass.

As the skills of the Destiny Spear Art were being used, Elder Bai felt an intense pressure coming over him.

As he was trying to block Lin Xiu’s attack with his sword, he kept moving backwards.

“Quick!”

Elder Bai screamed on top of his lungs.

As Lin Xiu heard his scream, Lin Xiu started looking around as well.

All four of the sage warriors were still like monks standing at their respective corners.

With Elder Bai’s commands, all four of them started releasing a large amount of energy.

This energy slowly materialised and there was an eye-blinding glow that came from it.

Soon, there were rays of bright light that shone from the ground.

Slowly, these rays join together to form a huge complicated rune.

What was this?!

When he saw what was happening, Lin Xiu immediately used the ‘Purification Domain’.

Lin Xiu tried to use his domain force and a bright, white glow came out of Lin Xiu’s body.

It slowly covered the entire floor.

However, the ‘Purification Domain’ was unable to get rid of these things that were on the ground.

This was not a domain!

As soon as the huge runes appeared, the entire ground was shining brightly in purple.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Before Lin Xiu could react to what these things were, there were numerous purple energy ropes that appeared from the ground.

These purple ropes then tangle themselves all over Lin Xiu’s body.

At the same time, there were still more energy ropes that kept coming out of the ground.

All of them were headed towards Lin Xiu.

It was only a short period of time where Lin Xiu was completely locked by the ropes.

Initially, he wanted to use the energy in his body to set himself free but Lin Xiu realised that he could no longer use the energy inside him.

It felt as if all of the energy inside his body had been sealed by this peculiar energy!

“Young master!”

Ye Kai, on the other side of the room, was getting anxious.

He was still stuck inside an array and he couldn’t get out of it.

But, even if he could, there was nothing that he could do as well.

“HAHAHAHAHAHAH!!”

Bai Zhan laughed as he saw what happened.

“What’s wrong? You can’t use the energy inside your body?”

After hearing what Bai Zhan said, Lin Xiu had an awful look on his face.

Since the beginning, Lin Xiu has been paying attention to the four warriors.

He was already extremely cautious but he didn’t think that these sage warriors would work together to release their energy from their source marks!

Lin Xiu figured it out when he saw the source mark on each of the warriors’ foreheads.

Damn it!

Lin Xiu was still struggling to set himself free but Lin Xiu realised that he wasn’t able to do so.

These energy ropes seemed to have a special ability. Not only were they able to tie him up tightly, they stopped him from using the energy inside his body.

“Elder Bai, kill him!”

Chen Jing, who was inside the array, started screaming.

“Shut up!”

Elder Bai was obviously unhappy with Chen Jing.

Then, he held onto his sword and headed towards Lin Xiu.

“Give me the Imperial Order.”

When he didn’t see the Imperial Order on Lin Xiu, Elder Bai frowned.

Lin Xiu ignored him and the look on Lin Xiu’s face started turning bad.

What the f**k?!

The source marks of these warriors were able to join together to release such unique strength.

Plus, while he was being tied up, he couldn’t even use ‘Mirror Image’.

“I’m telling you to tell me where the Imperial Order is!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was ignoring him, Elder Bai felt furious.

He used the sword in his hand and pierced it toward Lin Xiu’s shoulders!

Boom – –

But, just as the tip of the sword slightly entered into Lin Xiu’s body, it couldn’t go any further!
