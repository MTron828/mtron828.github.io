1299 The Powerful Huangfu Gu

The instant Huangfu Gu attacked with the sword in his hand; red flames appeared on the sword.

The entire long sword seemed to possess extreme power suddenly.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and at the same time, a dark blue flame emerged from the White Moon spear he was holding.

Dangdangdang——

When the weapons of the two collided, a loud sound suddenly erupted.

Damn…

Huangfu Gu gritted his teeth at this moment, his eyes full of resentment.

He clearly felt that Lin Xiu’s strength at this time was very strong, not weaker than him.

When the weapon collided, he felt a sharp pain in the hand holding the weapon.

And Lin Xiu, who was holding the White Moon spear, was not feeling great as well.

The scarlet flames released by the long sword in Huangfu Gu’s hand were no worse than his own hellfire.

Moreover, the strength of his sword swing was also very strong. For a moment, Lin Xiu’s hand felt a little numb holding the White Moon spear.

But at this time, Lin Xiu still burst out with all the source strength in his body.

‘Profound Intent·Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

Whoosh whoosh——

The moment the spear stabbed out, Huangfu Gu also quickly swung the long sword in his hand.

The speed of Lin Xiu’s long spear was extremely fast, but Huangfu Gu did not panic at all. The long sword in his hand danced wildly, constantly resisting Lin Xiu’s attack.

This Huangfu Gu is different from the God warriors he encountered in the previous nine battles, and his strength is very strong.

However, Lin Xiu still gritted his teeth at this time and did not use the ‘Fury’ skill.

After winning this match, there will still be other matches. If he used it now, he would be in trouble later.

“Is this person so powerful?”

Lei Tong, who watched the live broadcast of the battle on Lin Xiu’s battle platform, frowned at this time.

Although it seems that Lin Xiu is still able to handle it with ease, in fact, Huangfu Gu has already taken the upper hand.

Baili Haoling frowned slightly at this time.

The situation is indeed not optimistic. The old man’s strength is indeed very strong.

But Baili Haoling knew that Lin Xiu still had a trump card, so she wasn’t too worried.

“Huangfu Gu’s strength is indeed strong.”

Wan Gan on the rostrum couldn’t help but sigh with emotion as he watched the weapons of the two collide crazily.

Judging from the current situation, Lin Xiu has little chance of winning.

Noble God Riyan did not speak but continued to stare at the scene on the battle platform.

Although Lin Xiu seems to be at a disadvantage now, he always feels that Lin Xiu’s strength has not been fully utilized.

Zhang Qinghua didn’t speak but looked at Noble God Riyan, who was sitting next to him, with curiosity in his eyes.

He didn’t understand why Noble God Riyan was so optimistic about that kid.

“Go to hell!!!”

And Huangfu Gu, who was on the battle platform, was frantically waving the long sword in his hand at this time. This fierce offensive made Lin Xiu keep retreating.

And at this moment, following his roar, the long sword in his hand burst out with sword-like scarlet flames, rushing towards Lin Xiu’s body frantically!

Lin Xiu looked at this scene, and the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

This kind of scarlet flame, which resembled sword energy, made Lin Xiu feel a great sense of crisis.

Without the slightest hesitation, Lin Xiu directly unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

Bang bang bang——

As soon as Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ unfolded, those sword-shaped scarlet flames directly hit the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu had unfolded and loud noises erupted.

The whole body was pushed to the edge of the battle platform by this huge impact.

“Humph!”

Huangfu Gu snorted coldly at this time and the long sword in his hand was thrown out directly.

As he waved his hands to both sides, the long sword that flew out turned into tens of thousands in an instant.

All rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Domain power?

Seeing those thousands of long swords charging toward him, Lin Xiu clearly saw that the ground was also slowly covered by purple power.

Unknowingly, this Huangfu Gu has already set up his domain power.

At this time, Lin Xiu, who had clearly noticed this situation, released his ‘Purification Domain’!

With the release of the ‘Purification Domain’, the white light directly covered all the purple energy.

And at this time, Lin Xiu also activated ‘Heavenly Array’ at the same time!

With the use of the ‘Heavenly Array’, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that his strength had grown a lot.

...

The increased power of the ‘Heavenly Array’ seems to increase by a percentage.

The higher one’s basic attributes are, the stronger one’s strength can be increased!

‘Mirror Clone’!

At this time, seeing the thousands of swords rushing towards him, Lin Xiu directly used the system skills.

Boom——

At this moment, Huangfu Gu clearly saw Lin Xiu’s figure which was riddled with holes by his thousands of spears.

“No!”

But soon, Huangfu Gu realized it.

This kid is doing these tricks again!!! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Huangfu Gu, who clearly felt something, turned around suddenly at this time and saw Lin Xiu stabbing toward his body from behind with the White Moon spear!

“Die!!!”

...

At this moment, Huangfu Gu let out a roar and spat out a sword ray from his mouth, which instantly penetrated Lin Xiu’s head!

But as Lin Xiu’s head was pierced by the sword ray from his mouth, Lin Xiu disappeared like a burst balloon.

It’s fake again!

And at this time, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared from the side again.

No, not just from the side, but also from the front, back, left and right, there was exactly the same Lin Xiu attacking with the White Moon spear!

“Oh? Clones.”

Wan Gan was a little surprised when he saw this scene.

He thought that Lin Xiu was going to lose, but he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would actually dodge such a powerful blow from Huangfu Gu.

And at this time, so many clones appeared.

With his strength, it can be clearly felt that each of Lin Xiu’s clone has a certain strength.

This is interesting.

Because clones were usually used as a cover and will not have any power at all.

But Lin Xiu’s clones were obviously different.

“Go away!”

At this time, Huangfu Gu was completely furious.

Following his roar, a long sword was withdrawn from his hand.

Holding the long sword, he slashed straight out!

Dangdangdang——

His long sword hit the White Moon spear stabbing from all directions and there was a loud metal collision sound.

“Die!”

At this time, Huangfu Gu, who was already a little bit crazy, pierced the head of one of the “Lin Xiu” with a sword while he knocked these “Lin Xius” into the air!

boom–

This ‘Lin Xiu’ also instantly exploded like a balloon and disappeared.
