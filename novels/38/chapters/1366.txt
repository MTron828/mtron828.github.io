With Lin Xiu using the ‘True Fire Fist’, there were continuous fireballs that appeared in the air, headed straight for the warrior gods!

All of them thought that they were quick but when they saw the fireballs coming at them, they couldn’t dodge it.

They had no other choice but to immediately release their ‘sphere’s.

Boom boom – –

!! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

As the balls landed on their ‘sphere’s, it was followed by several loud explosions.

Pfft – –

The ‘True Fire Fist’ caused them to spit out blood.

At the same time, there were cracks on all of their ‘sphere’s.

“This brat…”

The bald man, who was the level of the group, suddenly looked frightened.

He was powerful! Incredibly overpowering!

All of his warrior gods were defeated by this peasant!

Damn it!

The look on his face turned horrible and there was countless dark energy that appeared.

As the dark energy was released, there were also black tiny particles that appeared around the man.

‘True Fire Fist’ was a warrior god’s skill and as Lin Xiu was the one who released it, it was terrifying.

Boom boom – –

The entire place started shaking once again.

The countless fists that appeared in the air threw all of the warrior gods to the ground.

Boom boom boom – –

All of their ‘sphere’s instantly blasted.

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered. In an instant, he appeared right before the warriors who had been smashed to the ground.

‘Sonic Star’!!!

He released another attack and there were countless punches that attacked one of the warrior gods.

That poor man ended up being a meat patty because of Lin Xiu.

Boom – –

At that very moment, there was a god warrior that suddenly appeared behind Lin Xiu. He had a machete in his hands and he was about to chop off Lin Xiu’s head!

However, his machete couldn’t do as he had imagined!

“This is impossible!”

Seeing how his sharp machete had failed to cause even a cut on Lin Xiu’s head, he was confused.

“Is that all you’ve got?”

Lin Xiu asked in a cold tone.

Lin Xiu changed his skills and the warrior god behind him suddenly felt a cold breeze coming at him.

Then, his entire body turned into an ice statue!

Lin Xiu stares at the man who had turned into ice and gave him a hard punch!

Boom – –

With that, the entire ice statue crumpled to the ground.

Lin Xiu killed another warrior god!

“Boss, shall we…”

The rest of them stared at the bald man.

All of their ‘sphere’s have been destroyed by Lin Xiu with his ‘True Fire Fist’.

Lin Xiu was definitely a powerful man and they no longer have the courage to fight him.

“Useless.”

The bald man sneered. Then, there was a huge surge of dark energy that was released from his body.

The dark energy turned into a huge hand and started grabbing the warrior gods.

All of them were stunned to see what was happening!

They wanted to run but soon realized that it was impossible!

The huge hand had grabbed all of them in an instant!

What was that?!

Seeing what was happening, Lin Xiu was surprised as well.

However, what happened next was even more shocking.

The bald man’s mouth was opened wide like a black hole and he swallowed all of the warrior gods that had been captured!

He was…..eating his own men?

...

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes subconsciously.

Something obviously felt wrong and Lin Xiu instantly threw out another punch.

There was a huge fire fist that went straight for the bald man.

Boom – –

However, the dark energy formed a ‘sphere’ and protected the bald man.

It was impossible for the fire fist to break the bald man’s ‘sphere’.

“Hmm?”

Lin Xiu frowned instead.

Lin Xiu continued using the ‘True Fire Fire’ and the bald man was being attacked continuously.

There were loud explosions that followed one after another.

However, these dark energies formed a tough ‘sphere’ and it was impossible for Lin Xiu to cause any damage to him.

...

At the same time, the bald man was still devouring his own men.

Crack – –

Then, there was a strange sound that came from the bald man’s body.

His entire body was slowly expanding!

“This dude…”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frown.

With the help of his analytic eye, he could clearly feel that his strength was growing tremendously!

The bald man, who was already tall and muscular, became even bulkier than before!

“Oh, you’re dead!”

The bald man roared as he rushed towards Lin Xiu.

He held onto a huge machete and swung it at Lin Xiu!

Xiu – –

The machete swung in the air and instantly let out a huge air-striking noise!

There was a strong sword aura in the shape of a crescent that was released and it was headed for Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but narrowed his eyes when he saw what was happening.

He quickly used ‘Flashing Souls’ to dodge the attack!

Then, he appeared right behind the bald man!

He gathered all the energy onto his right fist that had a boxing glove on it.

Boom – –

However, when Lin Xiu tried to attack him again, Lin Xiu noticed that the bald man had a layer of dark energy protecting his body.

This dark energy was the reason why this man had suffered no damage at all!

“Hmph! Did you think that these energies of yours would work?”

The bald man could feel Lin Xiu’s attack and he let out a cold laugh.

The bald man quickly turned around and wanted to capture Lin Xiu.

However, Lin Xiu’s reflexes were too quick. Lin Xiu had already gone missing before the bald man could catch him.

As he dodge the huge black hand, Lin Xiu’s body was completely covered with a blue flame.

Lin Xiu moved his left hand and there was a blue flame that was headed for the bald man!

Netherworld Flame?!

Seeing how he was getting attacked by such flame, the bald man’s pupil shrunk uncontrollably.
