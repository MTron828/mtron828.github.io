Chapter 1123: Arrived in the Holy City

At this time, Lin Xiu was not in a hurry to activate the teleportation array.

Cross-legged on the ground, he began to run the cultivation technique, absorbing the surrounding source energy.

During the battle just now, Lin Xiu consumed a lot of his energy.

To go there, you must ensure that your strength is at its peak.

It was soon evening time.

At this time, with Lin Xiu standing up, looking at the teleportation array, he directly pressed the start button next to him.

boom boom boom —

A strange sound came out and soon, the teleportation array began to light up.

From here, he should be able to reach the so-called holy city…

Lin Xiu looked at the bright teleportation array in front of him, hesitated for a moment and stepped directly into it.

Soon, Lin Xiu’s figure slowly disappeared.

When Lin Xiu looked around again, he realized that his position had changed.

“Domain lord?”

Hearing this voice at this time, Lin Xiu looked forward.

Taking a closer look, he could see a warrior walking towards him.

“You are…”

Originally, he thought he was the domain lord of Divine Domain, but at this time, when he saw Lin Xiu appearing here, his eyes were full of surprise.

Lin Xiu seemed to be wearing thick armor and a mask, which seemed very strange.

“He asked me to complete some tasks.”

Lin Xiu hesitated for a while, then said lightly.

Now he still needed to get information from these people.

It’s better to conceal his identity first.

“I see.”

The man nodded at this time.

He didn’t seem to have any doubts about Lin Xiu’s arrival.

Ordinary people probably can’t get close to this teleportation array at all.

It can only be used by the order of the domain lord of the Divine Domain or by the domain lord himself.

“I need information about the Bai family, can you give it to me?”

Lin Xiu walked directly to a table, sat on the chair over there and said lightly.

“The Bai family…”

The man looked at Lin Xiu suspiciously at this time.

“To work with them, I will need some information about them.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

There was no panic at all.

The man looked at Lin Xiu and seemed to believe Lin Xiu’s words.

At this time, he took out a tablet computer.

“Didn’t the domain lord tell you before?”

He said aloud while handing the tablet to Lin Xiu.

“Well, he’s busy and has to go to other cities to deal with other affairs, so let me take a look.”

Lin Xiu still spoke calmly.

“All the information about the Bai family collected by the domain lord before is in it.”

The man nodded, then clicked on the tablet. After unlocking it with his own iris, the screen was projected.

Lin Xiu looked at the information projected on the screen at this time and it really was all about the Bai family in the holy city and even the Bai family in the entire planet Namir.

The domain lord of this Divine Domain is really good and even collected this information.

It seems that Divine Domain has a deep cooperation with the Bai family on the surface, but they don’t trust the Bai family.

And very quickly, after constantly browsing the information, Lin Xiu discovered that there was a floor plan of the Holy City Bai Family!

The domain lord of this Divine Domain actually collected this kind of information.

However, this is indeed very good news for Lin Xiu.

In this way, it is only a matter of time before he finds that holy water.

Perhaps he could take advantage of the night and do something…

“Okay, I’m going out. If you need anything, I’ll find you again.”

Lin Xiu handed the small tablet back to the man and said.

“Okay.”

Although this man found Lin Xiu a little strange, he just saw Lin Xiu come from the teleportation array with his own eyes so he should be sent by the domain lord.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Otherwise, it would be impossible for ordinary people to come from that teleportation array.

Unless he is a Divine Domain warrior who killed the entire Divine Domain City.

What the man didn’t know was that what he was thinking in his heart was indeed the truth.

At this time, while Lin Xiu was walking outside, his thoughts were triggered and the tablet computer that recorded a lot of information about the Bai family entered Lin Xiu’s expansion space.

After walking out of this gate, the outside is the streets of the Holy City.

Because the sky was getting dark, the lights began to shine at this time.

As if it were daytime.

There are many warriors walking back and forth on the street.

These warriors didn’t pay much attention to Lin Xiu.

After all, in a place like this, there were weirder people around and Lin Xiu’s dressing is also very ordinary.

“There are quite a few warriors at the Sage warrior level…”

Walking to the streets of this holy city, looking at everything around him, Lin Xiu mumbled to himself.

And the overall strength of the surrounding warriors seems to be very strong.

“Have you guys heard? Baidi City seems to have been captured!”

Just as Lin Xiu was wandering around on the street and was getting familiar with the terrain when a voice came from the front.

Taking a closer look, he saw that some warriors were sitting there drinking and discussing.

“Well, I also heard that it seems that those warriors from other cities joined forces to ban the Bai family in Baidi City and the City Lord Council.”

“Because of this, the Bai family in the holy city is fuming.”

“They occupied Baidi City, but they probably won’t be able to hang on to it.”

“…”

At this time, Lin Xiu was standing nearby. Lin Xiu, who had good listening skills, could hear all the words clearly.

It seems that the fact that Baidi City was captured has now been known to the real Bai family…

Seems like Baidi city will soon be in crisis.

He still had to find an opportunity to sneak into the Bai family and find holy water to restore his body.

Lin Xiu immediately walked to the other side according to the information about the Bai family he had just obtained on the tablet computer.

Soon, when Lin Xiu walked to the other area, he saw the towering city wall in the distance.

There are many warriors guarding the city wall.

The Analytic eye glanced over and Lin Xiu also found that there were many warriors of the sage warrior level.

It looks very serious.

At the gate, there were also more than a dozen powerful warriors.

“It seems that the real Bai family’s strength seems to be a bit strong…”

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but say out loud to himself.

However, he still had to figure out a way to sneak in there.

Lin Xiu found one of the high walls where the guards were relatively weak.

At this moment, the figure moved and the whole person disappeared in place.

swoosh—

The guard on the city wall over there also suddenly felt a gust of wind blowing.

“Where did the strange wind come from?”
