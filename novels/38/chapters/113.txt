Chapter 114: Kill, Mission, Upgrade!

With Lin Xiu holding the Dark Edge spear and using the ‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers’ skill, he could clearly hear the Dark Edge spear making clanging sounds.

Bang bang bang——

At this moment, Lin Xiu used force with his right hand and stabbed out more than 20 times!

Tian Zhi was dumbfounded and only saw many shadows!

‘What kind of skill is this!?’

His jaw dropped and it was as if he could not return to his senses.

And at this moment, those T-Rex Leech larvae were all stabbed by the sharp tip of Lin Xiu’s spear.

The T-Rex Leech larvae and the T-Rex Leech were different. After being stabbed in the body by the tip of the spear, they exploded to death.

“Ding! Congratulations Master on killing the T-Rex Leech larva. You’ve gained 15,000 experience points!”

“Ding! Congratulations…”

“…”

A series of notifications kept ringing and Lin Xiu got very excited.

He gained so much experience from just one small leech!!!

Lin Xiu stared at those little T-Rex Leech larvae on the ground and constantly attacked with ‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers’, accurately exploding a large number of leech larvae on the ground!

In the blink of an eye, Lin Xiu had already stabbed all those little leeches.

And he was left with the last one, the T-Rex Leech that was split in half and still moving!

At this moment, the T-Rex Leech that was split into two curled its body like a compressed spring, ready to spring itself toward Lin Xiu and Tian Zhi!

“Move back a little!” Lin Xiu turned around and said to Tian Zhi.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Tian Zhi returned to his senses from the shock and nodded, then he took a few steps back without hesitation.

He knew that by staying around, he was courting death.

Sure enough, in the next moment, these two T-Rex Leeches rushed over directly like cannons!

Lin Xiu stared at their movements, then stepped forward with his right leg, and did not back away as his long spear pierced like a dragon coming forth from its lair!

At this moment, flames burst forth and the surrounding air became warped because of this intense temperature!

Bang——

The long spear ran directly through the T-Rex Leech that was in front!

And at this moment, the flames on the spear suddenly burst out as a dazzling flaming bird rushed out from it!

In the next second, the body of the T-Rex Leech was burned from the inside out, becoming a layer of skin.

But the other half of its body was still alive and was charging over quickly!

This darn thing was very horrifying, you could tell from the warrior who died so tragically just now.

Lin Xiu reacted as quickly as he could, and after destroying one of its bodies, he turned to the side and that T-Rex Leech pounced in the air, then fell into the mud!

Lin Xiu shook the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

The T-Rex Leech that got stabbed by his spear was burned and left with only its skin as it fell to the ground with his spear. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Lin Xiu looked ahead and realized that the other half of this T-Rex Leech was already drilling into the wet mud at this moment!

“Trying to escape?” Lin Xiu sneered and went over swiftly. His hands gripped tightly around the spear as he forced the Dark Edge spear into the mud!

“‘Awe of the Phoenix’!!!”

As Lin Xiu roared, the mud seemed to bulge up, and there was a loud “bang” in the next moment!

“Ding! Congratulations Master on killing a rank 4 T-Rex Leech! You’ve gained 1,888,888 experience points.”

“Congratulations Master on successfully leveling up! Current level is level 17!”

Level up!!!

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but get excited at this moment! But it was time to see where those Odd Crystals were.

He turned around and looked back. Those rank 3 T-Rex Leech larvae actually didn’t have any Odd Crystals, probably because the Odd Crystals had not formed in their newborn bodies, which made Lin Xiu a little disappointed.

Otherwise, with so many rank 3 small leeches killed, if they all had rank 3 Odd Crystals, he would be rich!

At the same time, Lin Xiu looked at the huge pit he created from using the ‘Awe of the phoenix’ and found a transparent light blue Odd crystal!

Rank 4 Odd Crystal!

This thing could sell for millions…

However, it was said that at the later stages of the ‘cultivation technique’, the crystals wouldn’t help much in improving the human body. Hence, only absorbing the large amount of energy stored in the Odd Crystals for one’s own use was effective.

Without much hesitation, Lin Xiu threw the Odd Crystal into the backpack behind him.

On closer inspection, this T-Rex Leech’s layer of transparent skin didn’t look like it was completely burnt. This surprised Lin Xiu as its skin could be cut but couldn’t be burnt.

He took out his phone and ran a search on the Warrior Union’s official website. Then, he found the T-Rex Leech skin mission in the missions section, the mission difficulty was three stars, the reward was 10 million!

“Damn!” Lin Xiu was surprised to see this.

‘This damned thing is worth 10 million?!’

Lin Xiu quickly picked up these two pieces of T-Rex Leech skins.

It felt like a thin piece of paper in his hand and he didn’t know what people wanted it for.

But since it was so valuable, he was definitely going to keep it, and when he reached the next area, he could hand over the mission.

He went to take a look at his stats board:

Host: Lin Xiu

‘Damn, the experience bar has changed?’

Previously, he could accumulate his past experience, now it seemed to have changed and they cleared the moment he leveled up?!

Lin Xiu cursed as he looked at his potential points.

’17 potential points… Let’s put it all on Strength!’

As Lin Xiu added 17 potential points, his Strength attribute instantly became 328. And at this moment, Lin Xiu could feel the long spear in his hand become a little lighter.

No, it wasn’t that the Dark Edge spear had gotten lighter, it was him who got stronger.

“Kill… Killed it?” At this moment, Tian Zhi slowly walked out and was shocked to see this scene.

Just how strong is this teenager?

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu nodded.

The sky was a little strange now, the clouds above their heads had become ominous.

It looked like something was about to change…
