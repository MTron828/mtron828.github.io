Chapter 299: Obtaining A Rank 7 Odd Crystal Again

“Hmph!” The man snorted and walked over to the Black-haired Violent Bull.

He sneered when he saw that Lin Xiu had no intentions of blocking him, thinking that Lin Xiu was afraid of the group.

“We have obtained the odd crystal…” Right as the man held his sword up to stab at the Black-haired Violent Bull, a loud sound came out and the bull that was lying down suddenly leaped upwards!

The sharp horn went through the man’s body instantly!

“AH!!!!”

The man never thought that the seemingly dead evolved beast would jump up again.

The sharp horn had penetrated through his chest!

Blood spurted out immediately.

He screamed and struggled for a moment before dying.

His remaining teammates were stunned, they never thought that the Black-haired Violent Bull was still alive!

And it had killed their comrade!

Lin Xiu was inwardly shocked when he saw how the Black-haired Violent Bull had killed the man with one blow of the horn.

He knew that the Black-haired Violent Bull was not dead but did not expect it to be able to kill the man in one short. After all, he was still a rank 6 warrior.

Roar-

The Black-haired Violent Bull unleashed a howl and its gigantic body fell to the ground, causing the entire place to tremble.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing rank 6 Black-haired Violent Bull, obtaining 30 million experience points!”

’30 Million?’ Lin Xiu was inwardly ecstatic, although he was far from leveling up, 30 million was a good number.

And he was the bane of all the evolved beasts inside Dark Forest.

“You guys still want to try?” Lin Xiu looked behind and spoke up to the group that had walked over indifferently.

They looked at him and no longer dared to take a step forward.

It was clear to them that Lin Xiu had intentionally baited their comrade to go up, so he knew that the Black-haired Violent Bull was still alive!

Upon recalling the scene of Lin Xiu fighting against the Black-haired Violent Bull, they felt that he was not someone that they could provoke. They were not as stubborn as the man who just died.

“No, you killed it.” One of them took charge and smiled at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was faintly surprised, he thought that they wanted to steal the odd crystal as well.

“But can we have a deal, we need the Black-haired Violent Bull’s odd crystal and the horns.” The man looked at Lin Xiu and asked after hesitating for a moment.

Upon hearing his words, Lin Xiu squinted his eyes.

“What kind of deal?” Lin Xiu looked at him and said.

“We really need the odd crystal and its horns.” The man hardened himself and replied earnestly.

He looked at Lin Xiu as though afraid that Lin Xiu would not agree.

“What will you give in exchange for them?” Lin Xiu revealed a smile and replied indifferently.

“A rank 7 odd crystal.” The man immediately took out an odd crystal from his bag when he heard Lin Xiu’s interest and revealed it to him.

It was a fiery red odd crystal that emitted an extremely powerful energy undulation.

Although the rank 7 odd crystal could not compare to the majestic beauty of the Ice crystal white bird’s odd crystal he had, it was also filled with an abundance of energy.

“Fine.” Lin Xiu nodded his head and handed the rank 7 odd crystal in his hand.

Lin Xiu was not interested in the Black-haired Violent Bull’s corpse, although the corpses of high rank beasts were treasures. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The man heaved a sigh of relief when he heard Lin Xiu agree to his request.

If Lin Xiu did not agree, they would have to risk their lives to fight him, since the Black-haired Violent Bull was extremely important to them.

“Oh right, I want to ask you something.” Lin Xiu seemed to have recalled something and asked.

The man was stunned by his informality and replied subconsciously, “What’s up?”

“Do you know how those warriors back there die?” Lin Xiu pointed in the direction that he came from and asked.

The instant he said that, all of their expressions changed.

Lin Xiu’s gaze changed when he saw the change, do they know something?

“Tell me.” Lin Xiu saw their eyes looking around as though they were unwilling and became serious.

When they heard his tone, the leading male hesitated and sighed, “They were trying to steal something.”

“Steal something?” Lin Xiu frowned and asked, “The Ice Lotus Fire?”

“No, not that.” He shook his head.

This stumped Lin Xiu, if they were not after the Ice Lotus Fire, then what?

“We don’t know either, but many of the warriors were killed there.” Upon reaching this point, his heart trembled.

They were all rank 6 warriors and although it looked like they were extremely similar to rank 7 warriors, the difference in one grade at higher ranks was extremely difficult to overcome. This also meant that the disparity in strength was too great and almost impossible for them to kill enemies of higher rank.

“We all just stepped into rank 6 and did not dare linger around. We left and returned to discover that they have all died.” The man continued.

They also felt that it was strange, what happened for so many high ranking warriors to die at the same place!?

Lin Xiu frowned after taking in the information.

“That sword… I think I saw it before.” One of the warriors seemed to have noticed Luo Yue’s sword on Lin Xiu’s back and muttered.

Lin Xiu’s ears were extremely sharp and upon hearing that, he rushed over the guy and questioned him, “Where did you see it!?”

The man was frightened by Lin Xiu’s sudden appearance and replied immediately, “I saw it back there too…”
