Chapter 480: Destroying A City on Their Own

What happened?!

Those on the spaceship were frightened.

“The zombies are attacking our engine…” One of the crews found the security footage and said in a trembling voice.

This was because from the video that he was looking at, they could clearly see what was happening in the rear of the spaceship. There was a huge mutant creature that appeared out of nowhere and caused a huge dent in the engine that was in the rear.

Kong Loong– –

With the huge noise, the entire spaceship shook once again.

“Oh no! The monster is coming in!” The students started panicking.

With the creature continuously hitting, the spaceship would not be able to hold against these mutant creatures that were crazy.

“What’s happening?!” The soldiers outside heard a long bang. When they turned around, they noticed that there were a few huge ape evolved beasts that were right behind them, that were hammering the spaceship.

“I don’t think I’ll be able to get rid of them in 10 seconds.” Lin Xiu, who was swarmed by the zombies, swayed his Dark Edge and killed a few of the zombies that almost touched him before informing Luo Yue.

“En.” Luo Yue answered calmly but she was still swiftly swinging her sword around. There was a sharp, bright light that went across the zombies that seemed to be invisible to the nakes eyes and it instantly chopped the zombies into pieces.

There were way too many zombies around them; it was even more than the number that they had met in the Xing Yao Academy.

Lin Xiu saw from his side view that there were a few evolved beasts that were at the end of the spaceship and were hammering the ship.

Although the zombies were occupied with Luo Yue and himself and has stopped attacking the students from Bai Dou Academy, there was another problem now because of the evolved beasts that had suddenly appeared.

With the abilities of the students, they would be the ones getting killed by the beast.

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu activated the skill from his system.

‘Heavenly Array !!!’

The skill was activated and there was a pale silver spherical glow that expanded with Lin Xiu as the center. Slowly, there was a pale silver dome that formed in the balcony.

Lin Xiu, who was in the array, could clearly feel the increase in his strength, speed and reflex.

The power of the Heavenly Array does not only apply to Lin Xiu. It would also help the others who were around him. With Lin Xiu’s help, Luo Yue could also feel a drastic increase in her strength.

Luo Yue was a little shocked with what happened but the zombies were attacking them like crazy and she didn’t have time to even think about how it happened.

Kill it!!!!!

With both of them getting faster, the zombies who were attacking them in waves were completely slaughtered by Luo Yue and Lin Xiu.

There were a large amount of chopped up zombies that remained on the ground.

There was blood everywhere and the place looked like the Shura Fields.

“Be careful!” One of the soldiers from the back shouted at the students when he saw an evolved beast heading towards the students. He screamed and pulled the trigger, releasing a bright laser ray towards the creature!

The laser beams landed on these evolved beasts but what they didn’t know was that these beams had no effect on these creatures.

At that moment, the evolved beast had already lifted its gigantic fist and was aiming towards the students who were right in front of it.

“Shuanger!” The girl who was next to Ye Shuanger screamed when she saw the first that was headed towards them.

Suddenly, a figure appeared in front of them.

Xiu – –

With a flash of light, the gigantic fist from the evolved beast that was heading for them was chopped off!

There was blood that came squirting out of it and it spilled all over the floor.

“Are you alright?”

“Shuanger.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Lin Xiu held onto his spear as he turned around and asked Ye Shuanger who was right behind him.

“Brother Lin Xiu!” When she saw that it was Lin Xiu, she screamed in excitement.

She believed that it was Lin Xiu when she saw the figure a while ago.

But now, after seeing that it was truly him, she was surprised.

“En. Are you alright?”

Lin Xiu didn’t care about the zombies or the evolved beast nearby. Instead, he walked towards Ye Shuanger and subconsciously wanted to pat her head like he used to but when he saw that his hands were full of blood, he paused.

“I’m fine.”

“So you are Brother Lin Xiu that Ye Shuanger always talked about! You are awesome!” The girl next to Lin Xiu said in awe.

She was the one who saw with her eyes how Lin Xiu got rid of the large number of zombies.

Hongggg – –

At that instant, the evolved beast whose fist has been chopped off, let out a loud cry. Then, with his other hand, he swung it towards Lin Xiu once again!

When he saw what was happening, he didn’t look nervous at all. He drew a circle in the air with his spear and chopped the beast’s head into half.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate. He dashed towards the creature, leaped forward with the Dark Edge in his right hand and pierced into the body of the creature!

Lin Xiu was fast and the spear was moving faster. It looked as if there was a bright right from the tip of the spear as it entered the body of the evolved beast.

When Lin Xiu landed behind the beast, there was already a huge hole in the middle of the creature’s head.

Kong Loong – –

The huge body fell onto the ground

“He’s…..so powerful…” The soldiers from the federation stared at Lin Xiu with their jaws on the ground.

This was an evolved beast that was at least rank 5. How did Lin Xiu get rid of it so easily?!

The soldiers weren’t the only ones who were shocked, even the students were surprised.

“By the way, what’s that?” One of the soldiers looked at the ground and noticed that there was a pale silver glow.

“Is this the Source field….that could only be used by a rank 9 warrior?”

An experienced soldier asked as his body trembled. There was fear in his eyes as he stared at Lin Xiu.

A rank 9 warrior was known as a legendary warrior!

These people were said to be able to destroy an entire city on their own!
