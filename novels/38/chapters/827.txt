Chapter 828: Boarding

Crackling-

At this moment, a large amount of lightning burst out from Lin Xiu’s hands.

The moment these people rushed over, Lin Xiu slammed his fists out!

Boom—

With a loud noise, at this moment, the bodies of those people all flew out!

Those who surrounded Lin Xiu didn’t even touch Lin Xiu’s fingers.

There is also a lot of lightning around their bodies.

The body fell to the ground, twitching constantly.

The impact of these bolts of lightning on them now makes them feel paralyzed in addition to the severe pain in their bodies.

Luo Yue pulled out her long sword at this time and just as she was about to make a move, Lin Xiu covered her hand.

“I’ll do it.”

Luo Yue has just woken up, although her strength has not dropped too much because he has been pouring source energy into her body for the past six months, but after all, she has been asleep for too long and her current body coordination has not fully recovered so she’s not suitable for combat.

Luo Yue also retracted the long sword that she was about to draw.

“Get lost.”

Seeing that there were still people trying to attack Luo Yue, Lin Xiu snorted coldly.

There were sounds like thunder as he sent those people flying out alive and vomiting blood.

This strength... so strong!

Some warriors who originally had thoughts about Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were completely shocked at this time.

The battle continued, but no one dared to provoke Lin Xiu and Luo Yue again. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

This created a very strange situation.

It was obvious that there was constant fighting here, but Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were standing here, as if they had nothing to do with them and no one attacked them.

When Old Man An saw this scene, his eyes lit up.

“You guys, how do you feel about that kid’s strength?”

Old Man An said to the bodyguards behind him.

These tall and sturdy bodyguards are also very powerful. At this time, they glanced at Lin Xiu.

Originally, they wanted to see what level of warrior Lin Xiu was based on his powerful sensing ability.

But as their perception abilities were released, they found that they couldn’t detect the appearance of Lin Xiu’s power at all.

It’s like a warrior with a very low level and a very weak strength.

“Very strong.”

A bodyguard said aloud at this time.

The strength that Lin Xiu showed just now was very powerful.

But now they couldn’t sense his power.

There is only one possibility, that his strength is much higher than theirs.

“Interesting.”

At this moment, Old Man An couldn’t help but smile.

Soon, with the end of the battle, there were just eighteen people who were still able to pass by and stand on the spot.

“Hm? It seems that the number is just right.”

At this time, Old Man An couldn’t help but say aloud. ,

“Now, have we gotten through?”

A middle-aged man smiled and said.

He was wearing a cloak and looked very weird.

“Yes.”

Old Man An nodded.

“However, life crystal, I will give it to you guys after you guys find it.”

Old Man An continued to speak.

“No problem.”

These warriors also nodded.

“Okay, now follow me and set off.”

As soon as Old Man An’s words fell, at this moment, other personnel carried away the moaning warriors on the ground for treatment.

Everyone also followed Old Man An and walked to the other side.

“Boy, what level are you in?”

At the same time, a man looked at Lin Xiu and said out of curiosity.

“My strength is very low.”

Lin Xiu smiled lightly and didn’t say much.

“Look at what you’re carrying, is it a spear?”

He didn’t get Lin Xiu’s answer but was not annoyed and simply looked at the weapon that Lin Xiu was carrying and said aloud.

Although the weapon was wrapped in black cloth, it was obvious that the weapon was a long spear.

“En.”

“Tsk tsk, there are not many warriors who use spears.”

The other middle-aged man said with a sneer at this time.

On the Marqi planet, there were fewer warriors with spears than on Earth.

And most of the warriors who use spears are not very strong.

Although seeing Lin Xiu using a gun as a weapon, many people showed disdain.

“Although your strength is not bad, I will give you two pieces of advice. This trip is not one you can set foot on.”

The middle-aged man in the black cloak before said with a sneer.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue ignored his words and continued to walk forward.

Under the leadership of Old Man An, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue walked over and they could clearly see the pier in front of them.

The pier seems to be very ancient and what it faces is the Black River.

The Black River, but this was a name from a hundred years ago.

Time has changed and now the Black River has been come into contact with the sea and it was more like a sea than a river.

When he looked to the front, he found that the surface of the Black River was completely dark.

But these waters are not polluted, but they are and there are a lot of living things.

It does look very weird.

boom boom boom —

And at this time, with a loud noise, at this moment, a huge cruise ship came over.

“You will spend the next days on the cruise.”

Old Man An said to Lin Xiu and the others with a smile.

“On the cruise ship, there is enough food and water and the captain will drive in the direction where the ghost ship appeared before.”

“If you find the ghost ship and bring it back, I will give you life crystals.”

“Of course, the things in the ghost ship belong to me.”

At this moment, Old Man An said lightly.

“Old man An, it’s ready.”

At this time, after the cruise ship docked, a middle-aged man in a black uniform came over and said respectfully to the old man.

“This is the captain of your mission this time, called Chen Dong.”

An old man introduced to the crowd.

“Well, I am mainly responsible for leading you to complete this mission.”

Chen Dong glanced at everyone, then nodded.

“The strength is probably the middle level of King warrior.”

Following his self-introduction, surprises appeared on the faces of the people around him.

Although they have seven or eight warriors who are at the level of king warrior, all of them have just stepped into the realm of king warrior and the gap between their strength and that of middle-ranked king warrior is still quite large.

“It’s almost time, I’ll be waiting for all of you to come back.”

After Old Man An looked at the time, the corners of his mouth curled up, then he said.

“Well, let’s go!”

At this time, Chen Dong waved to the crowd, then went straight to the cruise ship.

Seeing this scene, the rest of the people hesitated for a while and just followed.

“Let’s go too.”

Lin Xiu held Luo Yue’s hand and said with a smile.

As if this is not to complete a task, but go on a holiday.
