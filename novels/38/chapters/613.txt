Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“It’s nothing, it’s just an arrogant guy who was taught a lesson by me.”

Lin Xiu watched them come back, and then said lightly.

“You’re dead!” The man’s face was still pale at this time, but after he recovered, he looked at Lin Xiu over there and roared loudly with a ghastly face.

“You outsiders will definitely die in Sky City!”

Some warriors around, heard the man’s roar, and left here at this time.

After all, more is worse than less.

“Yo? It’s amazing to live in Sky City?” Ouyang Hang sneered at this moment, then looked back and said coldly.

“Hang... Young Master?”

The man seemed to know Ouyang Hang, but his expression changed slightly when he saw Ouyang Hang.

“Oh? So it’s you, why are you so arrogant now?”

Ouyang Hang looked at him at this time, then said with a sneer.

“No... It’s my dog’s eyes that look down on people, I’m sorry.”

At this moment, the man hurriedly said, and in the next moment, he looked at Ouyang Hang, and he ran away in despair.

“Yo, are you still flying?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows and said deliberately.

“Hmph, how can I say that my Ouyang family is also a family in Sky City, and it’s still a bit well-known.”

Ouyang Hang said proudly at this time.

“Are you from Sky City?” Huang Zhen and Qian Yao were also surprised at this time.

Everything Ouyang Hang showed before made them think that Ouyang Hang was the first time he came to Sky City.

“I’m from Nancheng. This side belongs to Beicheng. Sky City is very big. I’m not very familiar with this side.”

Ouyang Hang explained at this time.

“I happened to know that guy just now, but he is from a small family and is rather arrogant.”

“Huang Zhen, if you want to buy this martial arts card, hurry up and buy it, or you will be preempted later.”

Lin Xiu looked at Huang Zhen and reminded him.

“Okay.”

Huang Zhen also came back to his senses at this time, and then quickly went there to scan and buy a martial arts card.

“Have you all bought your martial arts cards?”

Lin Xiu said to Ouyang Hang and Qian Yao.

“Um.”

The two nodded, and after a closer look, they saw that they were both holding a martial arts card.

“What martial arts card did you buy?”

Ouyang Hang said to Lin Xiu.

“Well, it’s just an ordinary martial arts card.”

Lin Xiu said casually.

“Hey, you’re all here now?” Baili Haoling also came out at this time, looking at Lin Xiu and the others.

“We’ve all bought the martial arts cards we want, let’s go.”

Lin Xiu said with a smile.

“Don’t you look at the weapon or something?”

Baili Haoling continued to speak.

“I don’t need it.” Lin Xiu shook his head, now his black awn spear is the most convenient weapon.

And Ouyang Hang and the others also shook their heads. For them, the weapons they have now are the most handy.

“Then let’s go.”

After everyone left the main store of the Warrior Alliance, they rushed to the hotel where they stayed.

The Martial Artist Alliance’s hotel is very large and covers an extremely wide area.

There are all the supporting facilities around.

After showing his entry card downstairs, some staff started to help Lin Xiu and others arrange housing.

Everyone lives on the same floor, the twenty-fifth floor.

“Okay, I’ll take a break first. What do you want to do, do your own activities.”

Baili Haoling stretched and walked into his room.

“Let’s go back and have a rest first.”

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao also seemed a little tired at this time. After talking to Lin Xiu and others, they also returned to their room.

Ouyang Hang originally wanted to rest in his room, but at this moment, Lin Xiu said, “Do you know where you can earn Alliance Coins?”

“You want to make money?”

Ouyang Hang was stunned for a moment, then said subconsciously.

“Um.”

Before, because at Sanctuary Academy, everything could be exchanged for items using points.

But now that it comes out, everything needs alliance coins.

If it wasn’t for this martial arts card being sold at a special price just now, the Alliance Coins in Lin Xiu’s card would not be enough at all.

“Generally speaking, it is not easy for Sky City to make money...” Ouyang Hang pondered for a while and then said.

“But there is a place where you can make quick money, but not enough is dangerous.”

“Where?”

Lin Xiu was intrigued, he narrowed his eyes and said to Ouyang Hang.

“Sky Arena.”

At this moment, Ouyang Hang carefully spit out these five words.

“Is it similar to the competitive tower of Sanctuary College?” Lin Xiudao.

“No, it’s not the same. This sky arena belongs to the underground arena, it’s like playing a black fist.”

“However, those who participate in the battle there are unruly battles, and everyone will wear special armor before the battle. Ordinary people don’t know your strength at all.”

Speaking of this, Ouyang Hang’s face also became more cautious.

“So, you don’t know who the opponent is, no matter their strength or appearance, so sometimes if you want to admit defeat, you will be killed directly.”

Lin Xiu raised his brows, it did sound a little dangerous.

“I advise you to give up your heart. If you don’t have money, I can lend you a little.”

Ouyang Hang continued to speak.

“Well, tell me the address.” Lin Xiu said.

“Oh... what? Are you really going?”

Ouyang Hang opened his eyes wide and said incredulously.

Just now he told Lin Xiu of the danger here, does Lin Xiu still want to go? Isn’t this looking for death?

“Lin, I tell you, even if you go there, you will still die!”

At this moment, Ouyang Hang roared at Lin Xiu.

“Why, don’t you want me to die?”

Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

“Humph!”

“I want you to die, but now we are competing as the Sanctuary Academy. Although your strength is not very good, it is not enough without one person.”

Ouyang Hang said with a sneer.

“address.”

Lin Xiu ignored his words and continued to speak.

“You’re going to die yourself, I don’t care about you!” Ouyang Hang said in a frantic manner at this time.

Sky Arena, located in the west side of Sky City, is an underground arena acquiesced by the federal government.

At this time, in the evening, the surrounding lights were all lit up, and the whole city seemed to have turned into daytime.

Because this sky city is in the sky, there is still a lot of wind blowing around.

“Well, it should be here.”

At the same time, Lin Xiu had already arrived at the west city of the sky city, the position on the side of the sky arena.

Taking a closer look at this time, there were already quite a few warriors coming in and out in front.

These warriors look different from ordinary warriors. Their eyes are full of extremely strong.... murderous aura!
