Chapter 249: Get Ready To Set Off

“This thing should be difficult to find, right?” Lin Xiu looked at the old man and asked.

If this thing was easy to find, he would not have lent him 100,000 points.

“It’s not that difficult, as long as you go inside and pay close attention, you might find it.” The old man touched his beard and said to Lin Xiu.

“Sure.” Lin Xiu nodded at this time and said, “But I don’t want you to lend me points.”

No need to lend him points?

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words at this time, the old man was taken aback and didn’t understand why.

“I’ll find it for you and these 100,000 points are mine.” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said.

While talking, Lin Xiu took out his phone.

“I’ve checked and this thing costs a high price in the Warrior Union.”

“You sneaky boy.” Seeing this, the old man sneered.

“I’ll lend the 100,000 points to you. If you can bring this thing back, you won’t have to return the points.”

“Deal.”

“However, I need you to give me something as collateral.” The old man squinted at Lin Xiu and said.

“Something as collateral?”

“Yes, if you die over there, my 100,000 points will be gone, right?” The old man touched his beard and said.

“I don’t have anything to give you as collateral right now and I believe that I can come back alive.” Lin Xiu stared at him and said confidently.

Actually, he has one which was the diamond body skill card and ice crystal white bird’s egg.

These were all priceless things.

But Lin Xiu would not be so stupid to take them out. Although this person was an official member of the Sacred Region Academy, Lin Xiu was not sure if the old man would do anything if he was tempted by profits.

After all, he probably saw Lin Xiu as a young and naive boy.

“Nevermind, nevermind.” The old man shook his head at this time and lent the 100,000 points to Lin Xiu.

Including the points Lin Xiu had, he had just enough points to redeem the Fire scale suit.

Soon, the old man took out a large wooden box from the warehouse inside.

This wooden box looked like it was made of very high-end materials and there were two large words “Fire Scale” in the middle.

“Try it on and see if it fits.” The old man put the box directly on the table and said to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded, then quickly opened the box.

A fiery red uniform appeared in the middle of the box with a thin layer of unusual plastic on it.

As Lin Xiu took out the combat suit, he tore off the film on it.

There were fiery red scales on the combat suit and you could see that it was really made of the scales of the Flame beast.

The defensive effect of this combat suit should be much stronger than the one he was wearing at the moment!

Lin Xiu tried it on and this combat suit fits perfectly.

“Okay, I will bring that thing back.” After Lin Xiu felt no discomfort in wearing the combat suit, he said to the old man.

“En, I hope so.” The old man touched his beard, then nodded.

Looking at Lin Xiu’s retreating figure, a smile appeared on the corners of the old man’s mouth.

“What an interesting boy.”

Back at the villa, Lin Xiu didn’t continue training, but packed up his things and put them in one of his backpacks, preparing for the journey to Dark Forest the next day. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

While packing his backpack, Lin Xiu discovered that the ice crystal white bird’s egg was still in the backpack.

“Where do I put this thing?” Lin Xiu looked at the white egg and at this moment, it felt cold to the touch.

It was very strange.

What exactly is going on? Even in the hot weather now, the egg still felt cold, as if it was taken out of the cold storage.

It was really amazing.

After thinking about it, Lin Xiu decided to put it in his backpack and took it with him.

After all, he wouldn’t be at the Dark Forest for only a few days, he might be there for more than half a month.

If he left it in this villa, it might be very unsafe.

And it might hatch suddenly? Although this possibility was very low.

After Lin Xiu was done packing, he looked at his phone.

He sent Luo Yue a text message before, but Luo Yue did not reply to it which made Lin Xiu frown.

At night, Lin Xiu began to sit cross-legged on the ground and cultivated using the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

Soon, the energy in the air poured into Lin Xiu’s body.

After some time, when Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, it was already morning.

After eating breakfast, he continued to brandish the Dark Edge spear and practiced. Seeing that it was almost time, Lin Xiu carried his backpack and walked to the agreed place with his Dark Edge spear.

Rollie also jumped from Lin Xiu’s shoulder into his backpack.

“You’re here?” Guo Ling seemed to have arrived at the field very early. At this moment, watching Lin Xiu walk over, she smiled.

She still had a ponytail and looked very energetic.

She was also carrying a long sword behind her back. She was a warrior who uses a sword.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded and stood there with her.

Lin Xiu had put on the Fire scale combat suit and he was decked in red.

Together with the scale armor with unique patterns, he had a special air around him.

“Fire scale combat suit!?” Guo Ling noticed the combat suit Lin Xiu was wearing and her eyes lit up.

This kind of combat suit was considered quite expensive. She didn’t expect Lin Xiu to be able to afford it.

“Didn’t expect that as a freshman, you actually have more points than us.” Guo Ling smiled bitterly.

Fire scale combat suits were only available in the exchange center of the Sacred Region Academy. She was sure that Lin Xiu got it there.

And she checked previously that this set of combat suit required 200,000 points!

“Just lucky.” Lin Xiu smiled and didn’t say more.

Soon another girl and three guys walked over. Including Lin Xiu, there was a total of six people.

The people required for this mission had all arrived.

“Where are we going next?” Lin Xiu glanced at Guo Ling and asked.

“Over there.”

Guo Ling pointed at the gate.
