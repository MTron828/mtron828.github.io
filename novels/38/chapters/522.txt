Chapter 523: Beast Skin Map

Seeing Luo Yue approaching, they began to retreat slowly.

The few warriors who were indirectly rescued by Lin Xiu just now also had a look of disbelief.

They had no idea that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue’s strengths would be so strong.

Even Liu Kun felt that it was just a coincidence that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue had killed the rank 7 evolved beast.

And with so many people in their Requiem Group, how could they be afraid of two young people?

But the truth was far from what they imagined.

“Where is the space crack.” Luo Yue said indifferently as she stared at these people.

“On the other side,” Liu Kun slowly pushed away a tree that was on his body at this time, then slowly stood up.

He had no idea that Lin Xiu would be so powerful.

Although he unfolded the ‘Sphere’ in time just now, he still suffered a lot of damage.

Pfff——

When he got up, he vomited a mouthful of blood.

“Damn kid, I must smash you into pieces and I’ll ravage that woman to death!!!”

Liu Kun was so furious, he roared loudly.

He was really angry, and he had never been so humiliated.

Just when he was about to move, he seemed to feel something, and when he looked up, he saw a silver light in the sky.

What’s this!?

The pupils in Liu Kun’s eyes shrank suddenly.

Because maintaining the ‘Sphere’ was really exhausting, he could not use it anymore.

“Sword breaks the sky!!!”

Liu Kun obviously felt something was wrong, the sword in his hand swept in the air, and a huge crescent-shaped sword aura burst out.

It charged directly into the air!

But at this moment, he saw that there seemed to be a silver stream flowing down from the sky like a silver ray.

Boom–

With a dull sound, Liu Kun opened his eyes wide, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“How can this be…”

Liu Kun said strenuously. In the next moment, his body made an explosion-like sound and he instantly burst into countless pieces.

And Lin Xiu’s figure appeared amongst the explosion.

The skill that he just used was obviously the ‘Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall’.

Even if it was just a gold skill, when Lin Xiu uses it, the power is greatly increased.

After killing Liu Kun, Lin Xiu walked back.

As he headed back, he saw the group of people in the Requiem Group. At this time, their bodies were trembling, and some of them were sitting on the ground with their legs limp.

“We really don’t know where the space crack is…”

The man who said before that he knew the location of the space crack, said with a sad face at this time.

He merely said it just to survive but didn’t expect that Lin Xiu really killed the rank 7 Unicorn thunder bull.

“So you were messing with me?” Lin Xiu, who came from behind, said lightly at this time.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, these Requiem Group members turned around and saw Lin Xiu slowly walking over with a dark edge spear.

They could clearly see that the tip of Lin Xiu’s Dark edge spear was covered in blood.

And when they recalled how Liu Kun had been knocked out, their bodies trembled even more.

It was clear that their captain was already killed by Lin Xiu!

“Although I don’t know where the space crack is, we know where it is most likely to be!”

Seeing that the long sword in Luo Yue’s hand was about to stab here, one of the men’s face changed drastically, and then he shouted.

Lin Xiu found out from this guy that a few days ago, the Thunder Valley had shaken violently.

Because they often go in and out of Thunder Valley to hunt for evolved beasts, they were very familiar with the terrain here.

After feeling the strong tremor, they began to approach the source of the tremor.

“There were many evolved beasts over there, we can’t get close at all…”

“But according to our experience, even if there isn’t a space crack in that area, there may be other ruins…”

“Tell us the address.” Lin Xiu said coldly.

The man hurriedly rummaged through his backpack and took out a worn-out beast skin.

“This is the map of Thunder Valley that we drew.”

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate and took it directly. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

He took a closer look. On this beast skin map, the terrain of Thunder Valley was clearly marked.

“The place where the tremor occurred is right here…” After the man watched Lin Xiu spread out the beast skin, he stood up and pointed to the middle of the beast skin map.

Lin Xiu nodded, then put the beast skin map in his pocket and looked at Luo Yue.

Then the two of them walked straight ahead without looking back.

After these warriors saw Luo Yue and Lin Xiu both left, they heaved a sigh of relief at the same time, lying limply on the ground.

They have encountered many dangers, but not once, as dangerous as this time.

“This unicorn thunder beast… I don’t think they want it ah…” A warrior muttered to himself as he looked at the unicorn thunder beast’s body not far away.

At the same time, Luo Yue and Lin Xiu had already continued to advance deep into the forest.

After two days of observation, Lin Xiu already knew that the lightning in this Thunder Valley had a certain pattern.

There was almost no thunder and lightning from 6 to 10 in the morning, but after 10 o’clock, the lightning from the thunder valley began to be frequent and lasted until 11 o’clock in the evening.

“According to the map, it’s here…” Lin Xiu looked at the map, shaking, and the place where a large number of evolved beasts appeared was the hinterland of the valley of thunder.

Those warriors were scared out of their wits just now, and logically speaking, they would not lie.

“It’s more dangerous here.” Luo Yue said, looking at the location marked on the map.

“Are there strong evolved beasts?” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but become curious.

“Yeah.” Luo Yue nodded.

“But it shouldn’t be a big problem.”

“That’s good and according to the markings on the map, the lightning here should be the strongest in Thunder Valley – it’s good for training the body.”

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu became excited.

“Be careful.” Just when Lin Xiu wanted to continue walking, Luo Yue seemed to feel something, and then instantly hugged Lin Xiu and hid behind a giant tree.
