Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Hmm?

Something like this actually existed?

Lin Xiu was a little surprised when he saw what was happening.

“Lin Xiu!”

Soon, Lin Xiu heard his name being called by Yi Changkong.

!!

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and directly walked towards the stele.

Yi Changkong also noticed that it was Lin Xiu and he kept staring at Lin Xiu.

From the first time that he saw Lin Xiu, he had a clear feeling that he was different from the rest.

As for what it specifically was, he couldn’t tell.

Lin Xiu placed his hand on the stele and his name slowly appeared on the stele. At the same time, there was a bright light that came from the stele slowly enveloped Lin Xiu’s body.

Soon, Lin Xiu’s name was moving upwards on the stele.

His name appeared on the upper half of the stele.

“You’re good.”

Yi Changkong said flatly.

“Head over there.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and joined the others who were already in line to enter the space.

He could clearly feel a sense of energy around him.

This energy seemed to be testing the energy inside his body.

If the energy detected in him was stronger, his name would be higher up on the stele.

“Wang Qiang!”

Soon, as each of the warriors were called to the front, their names soon appeared on the stele.

“As you enter the sage warrior space, those whose name remain on the top of the stele will be listed as the first on the Tianjiao Rank.”

Yi Chankong looked at the warriors before explaining it to them.

“Now, look at your right hand.”

Yi Chengkong waved his hand and the sourcemark on his head was lit up.

There were rays of bright light that headed towards the warriors’ right hand.

Soon, there was a bright ray of light that appeared on their wrist.

“This is a source ring. Once you enter the space, you can snatch it from anyone that you like.”

“In the end, other than your names on the stele, the warrior with the most number of rings would be rewarded as well.”

Extra rewards?!

The warriors around started whispering after hearing what Yi Changkong said.

“Ready?!”

Yi Changkong screamed.

With that loud command, the sage warriors that were gathered around him raised their arms and let out the energy from their bodies!

Boom – –

Their source energy gathered together and there was a bright white light that was seen.

Then, the ground beneath them started shaking.

Some of the warriors were also gasping in shock.

There were a few who used levitation and placed themselves in the air so that they wouldn’t be affected by the shaking grounds.

As the movement on the ground became stronger, they couldn’t help but feel as if the entire planet was shaking.

Boom – –

They heard another loud explosion and suddenly, a bright light pierced into their eyes.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but narrowed his eyes as well.

Soon, he noticed that there was an oval shape opening right above them.

From the opening, most of them peered into it and they could clearly see that there was a large green luscious ground.

Is that….the sage warrior space?

After seeing what was right in front of him, Lin Xiu was surprised.

From what he has read previously, the sage warriors space was a place built by a group of sage warriors. Inside this space, not only were there warrior skills available, there were also godly weapons found.

“In you go!”

“Five days later, you will be teleported out of the space.”

With that, all of the warriors rushed into the opening that would lead them to the sage warrior space!

“Let’s go!”

Lin Xiu said to Wang Qiang, who was standing next to him.

“En!”

Wang Qiang nodded his head and he was getting excited.

This was the legendary sage warrior space!

It was something that every warrior had dreamt of!

Plus, most of them who had entered the sage warrior space would usually become sage warriors when they return.

As Lin Xiu flew into the sage warrior space, he noticed that everything before him turned white.

After some time, Lin Xiu felt his feet landing on the ground and his vision slowly came back.

He was now standing in the middle of a grassfield.

“Hmmmm….the air is good in here.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath.

So….this was what they referred to as the sage warrior space.

The air was fresh. Lin Xiu immediately laid on the ground and took a nap.

As the wind blew, Lin Xiu was feeling incredibly comfortable.

This space was much different from what Lin Xiu had imagined.

He thought that this space would be an abandoned area but he didn’t think that it would look like this.

If he was right, all of them would be teleported onto different parts of the sage warrior space.

As Lin Xiu was resting on the grass field, the black figures that were in hiding finally stood up.

“Heheheh…finally! There’s someone here now!”

Crack – –

It was followed by a peculiar noise.

The shadow that was previously on the grow suddenly stood up, looking like an actual human.

Xiu xiu xiu –

Then, these figures started rushing towards Lin Xiu from all directions!

They were about to attack Lin Xiu!

Boom– –

But, when they got close to Lin Xiu, a dark blue light suddenly appeared and Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’ appeared around him.

The figures crashed onto Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’ and it was a loud crash.

All of them exploded on the spot.

“Hmmm? Robots?”

When Lin Xiu opened his eyes, he looked at the things that had fallen around him and mumbled to himself.

Most of them were parts of artificial intelligence robots.

However, as they crashed onto Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’, all of them were destroyed.

“Damn it!”

From a distance, there was a person hiding behind a tree who was gritting his teeth. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“You can bring robots here?”

Lin Xiu asked him.

The man was stunned when he heard Lin Xiu talking to him.

Lin Xiu had found him?!

He slowly peeked around but noticed that Lin Xiu wasn’t looking in his direction.

Lin Xiu was still playing around with the parts that were on the ground as if he was trying to find something.

“Behind the tree.”

When he let out a breath of relief as he thought that Lin Xiu had not noticed him, he suddenly heard Lin Xiu speak of where he was.

His pupil shrunk and he stopped moving.

“How did you find me?”

The man walked out of his hiding spot with a machete in his arm as he asked Lin Xiu.
