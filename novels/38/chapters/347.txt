Chapter 348: 300 Million Experience Points!

At this moment, Lin Xiu clearly heard a clear sound in his mind.

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 7 warrior. You’ve gained 300 million experience.”

Hearing this voice, Lin Xiu was stunned.

300 million experience! 300 million experience!

When he killed those rank 7 warriors previously, Lin Xiu didn’t gain so many experience points. He didn’t expect that it would be 300 million this time!

This was really a surprise for Lin Xiu.

He looked to the other side and saw Luo Yue over there still battling against that man.

“Damn it!” The man had no weapons with him and was fighting Luo Yue with his bare hands.

Luo Yue’s long sword slashed on his body, giving off a clear sound after another, as if it had hit a metal object, there was no way to kill him.

And this man was also very angry at this time because no matter how hard he tried, his fist couldn’t attack Luo Yue’s body.

Luo Yue’s body skill was really too unique and he couldn’t hit her at her. He was always so close each time.

Dang–

Just when Luo Yue’s long sword slashed his body again, the man did not continue to attack Luo Yue’s body with his fist but grabbed the sword from her hand instead.

“Come here!!!” He roared then with a violent force, he dragged Luo Yue’s sword, along with Luo Yue!

The look in Luo Yue’s eyes changed slightly – she didn’t expect that this man would suddenly make a move like this.

At this moment, she suddenly felt a trace of warmth from her hand.

She took a glance and saw that Lin Xiu had appeared in front of her as he took her hand and held on to the hilt of the sword with her.

The man originally thought he could pull Luo Yue’s long sword abruptly, along with Luo Yue, but at this moment, he couldn’t move the sword at all.

He looked up and saw Lin Xiu!

“Use the Ice Lotus Fire!” Lin Xiu said without any hesitation.

Luo Yue’s reaction was very quick. The moment Lin Xiu spoke, a large number of white flames appeared on the long sword in an instant.

Because the man’s hand was holding the tip of the sword tightly, the Ice Lotus Fire went directly to his body!

“Damn!!” The man saw the flames spread to his body and he revealed a look of horror. His hand that was grabbing the long sword also let go at this moment.

But it was too late now. The Ice Lotus Fires had spread throughout his whole body in this short period of time. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

These white flames were very strange. They didn’t have a scorching sensation, on the contrary, they were bone-chilling cold.

He was covered in the Ice Lotus Fire and there was already a large amount of frost that had appeared on his body.

“I can’t be killed by these things!” The man roared loudly and the frost on his body shattered then fell to the ground.

But there was still a lot of Ice Lotus Fire on the body.

It seemed that because he took the forbidden medicine, he didn’t feel any pain now.

He didn’t care about the Ice Lotus Fire burning on his body and rushed to Lin Xiu’s side!

Lin Xiu’s pupils shrank and he yelled, “Get lost!!!”

Following Lin Xiu’s roar, he swung the Dark Edge spear abruptly and a flaming bird burst out instantly!

It attacked the man who leaped toward him!

Bang——

This man didn’t seem to think that Lin Xiu would release his skill. He could not escape at all and was directly hit by the flame!

Moreover, the Ice Lotus Fire and the red lotus fire were incompatible in the first place. At this time, the two types of flames collided and they had a special reaction. It gave off a loud sound like an explosion!

Bang——

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were sent flying to the back by the powerful impact.

“Damn…”

Although they were hit by this powerful impact, they were fine.

The two people quickly got up and looked towards the front.

“This fellow, is he dead?” Lin Xiu asked.

All they saw was thick dust flying and they couldn’t see clearly.

“Hahaha!”

At the next moment, a peal of loud laughter echoed, causing Lin Xiu and Luo Yue’s expressions to change.

In front of the dust, a figure quickly appeared again.

Not dead!

“Did you think that you could kill me like this!!!” The man slowly walked out, smiling at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue in the distance.

He appeared very battered and his hair was burned into a ball, but his body seemed to have no injuries.

There was only some dirt on the body at most.

Luo Yue frowned and she clenched the long sword in her hand. When she was about to rush to the front and continue attacking the man, Lin Xiu immediately grabbed her arm.

Luo Yue was taken aback and looked at Lin Xiu, puzzled.

“Don’t bother, he is dead.” Lin Xiu said faintly.

Dead?

Luo Yue was taken aback when she heard Lin Xiu’s words then she continued to look in front and could clearly see that this person’s skin seemed to be turning red.

What’s happening?

“Go to hell…” When the man saw Lin Xiu and Luo Yue standing over there, his eyes suddenly changed and he was about to dash over with a loud roar.

But his body was stuck in the same place.

“AH!!!”

At the next moment, he let out a miserable cry.

He had just clearly felt no pain in his body a moment ago. But right now, he actually felt severe pain, as if the flesh and skin from his entire body had been peeled off. The pain made his eyes wide open and it looked as if his eyeballs were about to fall from the eye sockets.

“The after-effects of the forbidden medicine.” Lin Xiu looked at the man in the distance and said faintly.
