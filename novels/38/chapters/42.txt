Chapter 43: Learning the Silver Skill

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Lin Xiu, what’re you looking at?” Li Yi looked at Lin Xiu who was standing at the edge and looking down at the situation. He became curious and came over to take a look at what Lin Xiu was looking at.

When he saw the dense clutter of zombie figures below, he could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva and felt cold perspiration trickle down his spine.

It was truly too horrifying, was their team supposed to kill all of these monsters?

“Let’s take a rest first.” Lin Xiu patted him on the shoulder then sat at the side and took out the silver skill card Torrential storm of rose flowers.

I am a rank 1 warrior now, I should be able to learn this silver skill, right?

“You’re going to learn a silver skill, right here and now?” Xu Wen saw Lin Xiu’s action and asked in shock.

It was extremely difficult even for a warrior like him that was of rank 2 to learn a silver skill. And in Xu Wen’s eyes, Lin Xiu was at most a quasi-warrior.

“Yeah, Lin Xiu, I think you should wait a while before learning it,” Li Yi spoke up.

The reason behind their advice was that all the recording and training patterns inside the skill card would flow into the user’s head once used.

But even with all the information, it still required endless training and practice to unleash the might of the skill.

It was like pouring all the memory and skills of an expert into the mind of an ordinary person. Even if he knew how to utilize the techniques, they would still be useless if the physique and muscles were not trained well enough.

Information from a bronze skill card could be retained for about a week, while a silver skill card could be retained for three weeks.

‘I have to learn Torrential storm of rose flowers completely within the three weeks.’

He placed the silver card on his forehead as a cool metal sensation seeped in.

The silver skill card released a bright light, and Lin Xiu immediately felt new information appear in his mind.

It was as though he had trained in the skill for very long and could unleash them at any moment.

Lin Xiu’s eyes sparkled as he sensed the marvel of the skill. He gripped onto Silver Immortal Soul and started practicing it.

As the saying goes, ‘In martial arts, the speed at its utmost extreme cannot be defeated.’

And the main aspect of the Torrential storm of rose flowers was speed!

To unleash hundreds of attacks on surrounding enemies in a short span of time and prevent them any opportunity of defending.

Even if the enemy withstood one attack or two attacks, would they be able to withstand 100 explosive attacks in a second?

Although the skill was extremely powerful, it demanded a great deal from the user as well. Not only must the user have explosive strength, but he also needed to harmonize the power as well.

Lin Xiu held onto Silver Immortal Soul and faced the wall near the steel doors and took a deep breath. His gaze turned cold as he bellowed out loud, “Torrential storm of rose flowers!”

“Sou Sou Sou”

It felt as though little specks of cold aura had appeared for every spear that he brandished. A few holes appeared on the wall before him.

No, it’s slow, too slow.

“This guy…” Xu Wen looked over and saw the spear unleashed by Lin Xiu as shock appeared on his face.

Even he might not be able to defend against that speed.

He had just learned the silver skill and used it for the first time, but he was able to reach such a degree of finesse?

One had to know that a silver skill’s exhaustion on the body was not something a bronze skill could compare to.

Li Yi could not help but stare at Lin Xiu seriously. In the beginning, he only had a good feeling towards Lin Xiu as he had graduated from the school that Lin Xiu was in. But he always felt that Lin Xiu was just an ordinary beginner or quasi-warrior.

He could not compare to an official warrior.

But after interacting, he realized that Lin Xiu was not only calm and collected in battles, his strength was not inferior to his.

No, Lin Xiu might even be stronger than him.

He looked at Lin Xiu’s spear. That’s such a heavy weapon, how is he able to wield it so freely?

“Damn it!”

While staring at Lin Xiu, Li Yi suddenly realized that Lin Xiu had stabbed out five holes in a second!

That was five strikes in a second!

Wasn’t that improvement too fast? Although it was just a single spear strike in the second, it was already extremely terrifying!

“Damn, I can only stab five times,” Lin Xiu muttered to himself in dismay.

The figure in his mind was able to unleash 100 spear strikes in a second! That was the true power of the Torrential storm of rose flowers!

Seems like I need to practice more.

But just as Lin Xiu was about to dance with his spear and utilize the Torrential storm of rose flowers again, he felt the airstreams around him. In that instant, the airstreams collided and formed a beam of light. He instinctively thrust the spear in that location. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

A loud bang rang out when he stabbed forth, and the wall immediately exploded.

What’s going on?

What is that feeling upon using the skill?

It was like… being one with the spear.

“How did you just do that?!” Xu Wen’s pupils constricted when he saw that.

He had only seen such a move occur from the strongest warrior in his family.

Although it had been many years, he would never forget that scene.

“I don’t know.” Lin Xiu regained himself when he heard Xu Wen and shook his head.

“What was that? Why did it seem that your might was multiple times stronger?” Li Yi questioned.

It was too exaggerated, the wall actually exploded the instant he thrust out.

“Profound intent, that was profound intent!” Xu Wen bellowed.

“You’re saying that this is…” Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted, he suddenly recalled the knowledge in his memory from reading books.

Although there was bronze to diamond ranking for skills, even the lowest bronze skill could unleash extreme power when trained and enlightened to a certain degree.

With Lin Xiu’s Rupturing Fist as an example, there was a limit to how much he could train. It was impossible for it to be comparable to a gold skill at its later stages, but if he could comprehend Rupturing Fist’s profound intent, the power it could unleash would definitely match a gold skill.

But it was extremely difficult to gain enlightenment on a skill’s profound intent. Not only did it require a deep understanding of the skill, but it also required… luck!

That’s right, luck.

It was said that out of a thousand people that trained the same skill to great success, only a handful could be successful in gaining the skill’s profound intent.

Upon thinking about it, Lin Xiu became excited. If he could gain the profound intent of Torrential storm of rose flowers, his Torrential storm of rose flowers would be much more powerful than the ordinary Torrential storm of rose flowers!
