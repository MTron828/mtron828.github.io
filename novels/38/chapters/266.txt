Chapter 267: Robbery

His surroundings remained quiet as though no one was around even after he spoke up.

Lin Xiu frowned and continued, “The one hiding at the corner at my left, are you not coming out?”

Following his probe, a figure walked out.

“Who would have thought that you discovered us.” Three men walked over and eyed Lin Xiu with faint surprise in their eyes.

They thought that they had hidden well and did not expect Lin Xiu to discover them.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Xiu turned and looked at them.

Lin Xiu knew that their sudden appearance was of ill intent without even thinking.

“Nothing, I just saw you spend 1 million for information, you seem to be rich.” One of them looked at Lin Xiu and chuckled.

The other two also stared at Lin Xiu, their eyes revealing greed when they saw his Fire scale combat suit.

They were knowledgeable people and knew that the Fire scale combat suit was the most suitable combat suit to enter Dark Forest.

“And then?” Lin Xiu revealed a smile that showed interest in their words.

“And then?”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s calm expression as though he was not afraid, the trio looked at each other and laughed at the same time.

“Brat, you’re rather arrogant.” A middle-aged man looked at Lin Xiu and commented.

They saw Lin Xiu as an ordinary young man and because Lin Xiu had used disguise, they sensed that he was not strong at all.

“Give us the black card and the Fire scale combat suit and you can go.” One of them looked at him and said.

The black card was the card that Lin Xiu had used to transact with.

There were unique engravings on the black card that only appeared when the account had more than 100 million union coins.

It was rare for warriors like them to have 100 million union coins.

Lin Xiu replied, “Oh? So you guys want to rob me?”

“Rob? You can say that.” The middle-aged man laughed and wielded his saber and pointed it at Lin Xiu.

“Bring it over, otherwise you’re dead!” He glared at Lin Xiu and said ferociously.

They were extremely greedy when it came to valuable things.

Regardless, they would go to the extent of killing Lin Xiu to take the items.

“I can give it to you.” Lin Xiu replied indifferently.

The middle-aged man laughed when he heard Lin Xiu’s words, “Hahaha, seems like you understand the situation.”

“Bring them over.” He looked at Lin Xiu then spoke to the two men beside him.

They immediately walked over.

“Take it out…”

Just as they finished speaking, Lin Xiu sent two fists at them!

Rumble-

Vacuum explosions came out in the air.

The two that were about to tear off the Fire scale combat suit from Lin Xiu’s body were frightened by Lin Xiu’s punch.

Fortunately for them, they were not ordinary warriors and reacted to avoid the punches.

“Damn it!”

Although they dodged the punch, Lin Xiu’s fists had given them a shock.

“Kill him!!!” The middle-aged man holding the saber became furious and roared out loud.

Just as he said that, he launched an attack at Lin Xiu!

The two other partners reacted and immediately erupted with source strength. It enveloped their fists as they rushed toward Lin Xiu as well!

Lin Xiu could tell that they were peak rank 5 warriors even without Analytic Eyes.

Although Lin Xiu was at the early stage of rank 5, he was not afraid. He watched as they approached and moved, not to dodge, but to attack!

“Seeking death!!!”

The expressions of the two men changed when they saw him rush at them as they executed their fist skills at Lin Xiu!

Bang bang-

As their fists came outwards, gigantic explosions occurred.

This revealed the might of their fists.

Lin Xiu raised an eyebrow. As he charged towards them, he moved to the side and avoided one of the fist while sending out one of his own! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Whoosh-

Lin Xiu’s fists was clearly enveloped in a large amount of lightning !

This caused their surroundings to be lit up.

What is that!?

One of the men that wanted to punch Lin Xiu’s body had a change in expression.

What is going on!?

He wanted to retract his fist but it was too late.

It collided right smack into Lin Xiu’s fist!

Rumble-

A large sound came out the instant their fists collided.

The large amount of lightning crackled and spread throughout his entire body!

Lin Xiu’s punch was nowhere inferior to his and the man felt as though he had punched an object that was many times harder than steel. As the immense pain spread from his hand, his bones started to crack as though they were about to break.

“AHH!!!”

Adding the electric currents that enveloped his body and caused him immense pain, he started to wail out loud.

He was flung backwards and fell to the ground while twitching endlessly.

“Go and die!!!”

The middle-aged man with the saber was shocked at the sight of his man falling and brandished his saber frantically at Lin Xiu!

Just as he was about to attack from the front, the man behind launched a fist at Lin Xiu!

“Fiery Fist!!!”

He roared out loud without any intent to hide and used his skill.

Following his outburst were flames that enveloped his fist!

The temperature of the flames was very high and as his fist was completely enveloped, he charged forth with extreme speed!
