1426 Luo Yue’s Battle

Luo Yue was still fighting those people, and fell into a bitter battle.

Thank you readers!

“Catch her!”

Zhang Linlin looked at Luo Yue at this moment, and continued to shout loudly.

Although Luo Yue’s strength is strong, how can she withstand the attack of thirty warriors?

Seeing Luo Yue unfolding the ‘Sphere’ now, obviously unable to resist, Zhang Linlin also showed a sneer at the corner of his mouth.

But at this moment, a scream came.

what was that!?

The expression in Zhang Linlin’s eyes changed slightly.

In the next moment, he could clearly see a huge ice crystal white bird rushing up from below!

Boom——

At this time, as Xiaobai, who was flying high in the sky, waved its wings, a gust of frost suddenly rushed towards the God warriors who surrounded Luo Yue!

Some God warriors who were caught off guard were directly frozen by the frosty wind, and instantly turned into ice sculptures!

Luo Yue also seized this opportunity and directly attacked those warrior gods who had turned into ice sculptures and hadn’t fallen yet.

Bang bang bang——

As she slashed across with her sword, those warrior gods who had turned into ice sculptures were all shattered.

At the same time, Rollie also flew up.

It held a huge warhammer and swung it at the surrounding god warriors!

Boom, boom, boom——

Several God warriors were directly sent flying by its big hammer head, and hit the energy barrier below heavily.

Blood also kept spitting out from their mouths.

With Xiaobai and Rollie’s help, Luo Yue was suddenly less pressured.

“Stop her!”

Looking at Luo Yue’s movements, Zhang Linlin thought that Luo Yue wanted to run away, so he said loudly at this moment.

The warriors of the law enforcement team also quickly caught up at this time.

Xiaobai is still dealing with these God warriors, but the power of the God warriors is obviously very strong.

After being attacked by the skill of those warrior gods, Xiaobai’s body also hit the ground below.

But it crawled on the ground, then flapped its wings and chased after them.

At this time, Rollie also followed Luo Yue to fly to the other side.

“Where are people!?”

Lei Tong was just about to fly up to help, but found that everyone was gone!

“Luo Yue! You can’t escape!!!”

Zhang Linlin chased after him with a ferocious face.

Luo Yue flew out very fast, and the God warriors of the law enforcement team could only follow closely behind, and couldn’t surpass her at all.

Soon, when Luo Yue flew to the beach, her figure stopped in place.

“Aren’t you running away?”

Looking at this scene, Zhang Linlin immediately sneered.

The remaining twenty-two warriors surrounded Luo Yue in an instant.

At this time, Rollie was hovering beside Luo Yue, holding the war hammer, and took the lead in swinging towards several God warriors among them!

When those god warriors saw this scene, they originally wanted to use their own weapons to block it.

But when their warhammers collided with their weapons, there was an incomparably loud sound.

The terrifying power directly sent them all flying.

What the hell is this?! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Looking at Rollie, Zhang Linlin’s eyes were filled with shock.

At this time, Luo Yue raised the thin-winged long sword in the air, and the sea water below flew up towards the sky in an instant!

A large amount of sea water flew to Luo Yue’s side.

Forming a series of water curtains.

When the members of the law enforcement team were about to pass through the water curtain, those water curtains instantly condensed into ice!

All of them were frozen in it.

At this time, Xiaobai also flew over from behind.

As it screamed, a large number of ice crystals on its body immediately charged toward the frozen God warriors of the Law Enforcement Team!

Those God warriors who were frozen in the water curtain couldn’t even unfold their ‘Sphere’!

At this time, those icicles hit their bodies, and immediately pierced their bodies!

“Damn it! Get lost!”

Zhang Linlin looked at the ice crystal white bird rushing from behind, and his face became extremely ugly at this moment.

With a roar, he slashed directly at it with a saber in his hand!

Very strong saber energy rushed out and directly hit Xiaobai’s body.

boom–

A lot of ice crystals on Xiaobai’s body fell off, but he didn’t seem to have suffered much damage.

Hell!

Zhang Linlin’s eyes became extremely ugly.

He didn’t know how this ice-crystal white bird grew. This low-level evolved beast can actually grow to god-level!

And that one, an evolved beast that looks like a snowball, is also wielding a huge warhammer.

Many members of the law enforcement team were beaten out!

Whoosh whoosh——

At this time, Luo Yue was holding the thin-winged long sword in her hand and was constantly attacking the surrounding God warriors of the law enforcement team.

With Rollie and Xiao Bai restrained, Luo Yue killed several God warriors in an instant.

“How… how could this happen.”

Zhang Linlin was a little panicked at this moment.

If things go on like this, all members of the law enforcement team will die!

Damn it!

Seeing another God warrior of the Law Enforcement Team die by Luo Yue’s sword, Zhang Linlin hesitated for a moment, then turned around and was about to flee.

Luo Yue saw this scene. At this time, the long sword in her hand raised into the air, and the sea water below splashed directly.

Charged towards Zhang Linlin!

Zhang Linlin turned around and looked at the sea water rushing towards her, and the pupils in her eyes shrank slightly.

At this moment, she quickly unfolded her ‘Sphere’.

But as soon as her ‘Sphere’ opened, all the sea water had already hit her ‘Sphere’!

Crash——

And at this moment, a terrifying icy air rushed over directly.

At the moment when the icy cold air hit, the sea water enveloping Zhang Linlin who was unfolding the ‘Sphere’ completely solidified.

In an instant, a huge circular ice ball was formed, directly enveloping Zhang Linlin in it!

Although separated by the ‘Sphere’, at this time Zhang Linlin clearly felt the bone-chilling cold.

Now she doesn’t dare to retract her ‘Sphere’ easily, and can only let those ice cubes freeze on her ‘Sphere’.

“Damn it!”

Her face became extremely nasty.

Boom——

At this time, with a wave of the warhammer in its hand, Rollie sent another God warrior of the law enforcement team flying.

From the thirty people just now, there were only three left!

The faces of the three warrior gods all became extremely ugly.

It seemed completely unexpected that things would develop to this extent.

Luo Yue withdrew and wiped the blood from her lips, holding the thin-winged long sword in her hand, and continued to attack the last three God warriors!

Rollie and Xiaobai also attacked the three God warriors from behind!
