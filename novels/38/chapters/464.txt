Chapter 465: Awakening!

“An artificial intelligence robot?” Dean Baili took some time to process it as he exclaimed about what he saw with his eyes widened in shock.

With artificial intelligence robots, it would uncover a danger that has emerged from the previous century.

In the future, artificial intelligence robots were something extremely common. However, as the robots became smarter, it brought forward a disaster.

A large amount of artificial intelligence robots had refuse to work for the humans and instead, they wanted to make humans their slaves.

The battle between humans and artificial intelligence carried on for decades. In the end, the human’s intelligence managed to win against the robots but this battle has already caused immense damage to the humans.

There was approximately one-third of the human population that was sacrificed in that battle.

Most of the wasted lands that were seen now were because of what happened back then.

If they paid a visit to these waster lands, they would be able to find lots of debris from these artificial intelligence robots.

After being threatened by these robots, humans got afraid of them. Therefore, in the end, most of the leaders of the world declared that they would ban all artificial intelligence from being created. The robots that they have now in charge of cleaning the houses were just normal robots. They weren’t even close to being known as artificial intelligence robots.

But the one that they are seeing now was definitely not a normal robot.

“That’s right. They found an artificial intelligence robot undersea!” The middle-aged man got excited while speaking about it.

“Plus, it seems like it has been badly damaged and there is something wrong with it. Our staff had no other choice but to draw it out of the sea.”

“Have they disassembled it?” Dean Baili was still focused on the image as he asked.

As long as they were able to dismantle the robot, there would be a possibility for them to retrieve important messages from its brain.

“We have already analyzed it but we haven’t found anything useful yet. Plus, there is an automated destructive device near its brain where the memories are stored. If we tried to remove it, it would explode on its own.” As he was explaining it, the middle-aged man felt devastated.

“Did you get anything else from the analysis?” Dean Baili kept quiet for a brief moment before asking.

The middle-aged man nodded his head and continued, “This is an older model of artificial intelligence robots. It isn’t as smart as newer models. These models were usually used for specific missions that involved harvesting materials. Its entire body was waterproof and resistant to high pressure. If we guessed it correctly, someone has left it in the ocean surrounding the Sacred Region Academy.”

“Oh, so that’s what it is…” After hearing the middle-aged man’s explanation, it got Dean Baili thinking.

He thought about it and felt that this situation may not be as simple as he thought.

Would it be possible that Lin Xiu has also found this artificial intelligence robot and something else has happened underwater?

Otherwise, with Lin Xiu’s abilities that he has shown previously, he would definitely be able to complete this mission.

“Right, what about the space crack?” Dean Baili suddenly thought of it and asked the middle-aged man who was seated opposite him.

“The space crack disappeared. We are not sure what has caused the space crack but theoretically speaking, the barrier around us should be tough and this situation should have occurred.” The middle-aged man answered accordingly.

“Could it be because of that?” Dean Baili pointed at the image of the artificial intelligence robot that was being projected on the wall opposite him.

“From the appearance of the robot, other than giving our nuclear energy bullets, it wouldn’t have been able to do such things. However, it would still be possible for it to form a space crack.” The middle-aged man told Dean Baili.

“En. Get it checked then.” Dean Baili nodded his head.

“Yes, Sir!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Time passed by quickly. During one of the mornings, Luo Yue was right beside Lin Xiu, with a wet towel in her hands as she wanted to clean his body when she noticed that Lin Xiu’s body was trembling.

Luo Yue, who clearly felt his body shaking, was stunned.

She took a closer look at Lin Xiu and noticed that his fingers were gently moving as well.

When she noticed what was happening, Luo Yue’s pupil shrank uncontrollably. Lin Xiu has been asleep for days. What does this mean?

This would mean that there was a possibility that Lin Xiu is about to be awake!

“Luo Yue, is Lin Xiu done with the drip?” At that time, Nan Zhengjun was holding onto a bag of nutrition fluid that he got from the doctor.

Lin Xiu has been maintaining his body with the help of these nutrition fluids. These nutritions could be easily absorbed by the body and he wouldn’t have to use the toilet.

When Nan Zhengjun walked into the room, he realized that Luo Yue was staring at Lin Xiu, frozen.

“What’s wrong? Nan Zhengjun was shocked as well and subconsciously asked Luo Yue.

Then, Luo Yue’s eyes moved towards Lin Xiu’s body and he saw Lin Xiu’s fingers moving slowly.

He couldn’t help but widen his eyes in surprise and he also dropped the bag of nutrition fluid that was in his hands.

“Doctor!!!!!” Nan Zhengjun immediately came back to his senses and screamed out loud.

Soon, the doctor from before came running into the room and when he saw Lin Xiu’s fingers moving, he was shocked as well.

Usually, with Lin Xiu’s state where he was in a deep coma, it would be impossible for him to wake up anytime soon but now, Lin Xiu’s fingers were slowly moving. It was an obvious sign that this boy was about to regain his consciousness.

“If I’m not wrong…..he should be awake soon.” The doctor said in shock.

Plus, with the numbers that he saw on the machines, his eyes were filled with disbelief.

This was because Lin Xiu’s body was not only tougher than before, all of the readings from his body systems were much higher than an ordinary human being.

If it wasn’t because Lin Xiu looked like one, the doctor would have assumed that Lin Xiu was an alien.

Luo Yue remained stunned on the spot after noticing the movement in Lin Xiu’s fingers. As for Nan Zhengjun and the doctor, they were staring at Lin Xiu as well, waiting for him to be awake.

Lin Xiu slowly bent his fingers and then stretched them.

Boom – –

All of a sudden, Lin Xiu, who was in a deep sleep, suddenly sat up, and both his eyes were now wide open!
