Chapter 1058: The Last Battle

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

As the black source mark appeared on Lin Xiu’s forehead, there was a large amount of arrays that appeared in front of them while they were trying to run away!

What are these?!

Both of them left as quickly as they could but that’s when they realised that there were huge arrays right before them.

With the control of his mind, more and more arrays kept appearing.

Soon, the entire sky was covered by the semi-transparent arrays and it formed a huge dome.

Their bodies were completely covered by the dome formed by the arrays and there was no way for them to escape from it.

“Damn it!”

The look in their eyes changed. At the very next moment, they tried to activate their warriors skills in order to break open the array!

Boom boom boom – –

As they continued to madly attack the dome, it did not affect the dome at all.

It was impossible for them to break through!

“Such powerful strength…”

Seeing the scene up in the air, Ji Mei’s eyes were wide open as well.

Lin Xiu, the Right Guardian and Elder Lin were all inside the huge dome, formed by the arrays.

“Me’er, he’s so powerful…”

Bingbing and Lanlan, who were standing next to Ji Mie, had their eyes open wide as well.

They were looking extremely surprised.

The strength and abilities that Lin Xiu showed them were alarming!

As for Tang Qi who was behind them, his entire body started shaking.

They were killed again! Another two sage warriors from the Tang Pavilion were killed!!!

If this goes on, Elder Lin and the Right Guardian would soon be killed by little girl Lin.

But, what can he do now?

Suddenly, his legs started feeling weak.

Xiu – –

At the same time, the array that was over Ji Mei and the rest had disappeared.

When Ji Mei noticed what happened, she subconsciously looked at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu noticed that she was looking at him as well and nodded his head.

Under such circumstances, no one would be able to threaten them.

As for warriors like Tang Qi, Lin Xiu wasn’t even bothered about killing him.

The EXP that he would get was too little.

“There’s nothing over them now!! Kill them!!”

Tang Qi saw what was happening as well and he screamed at the top of his lungs.

Without the protection of the array, there was nothing to be afraid of.

This was what Tang Qi thought.

But, he seemed to have forgotten that Ji Mei was also a sage warrior.

“Is that so?”

There was a cold look in her eyes.

She held onto her sword and slowly walked closer toTang Qi.

Bingbing and Lanlan, who were also by her side, grabbed tightly onto their weapons as well.

Now, the ones left were Tang Qi and two respected warriors.

Ji Mei would be able to kill all of them on her own.

“What are you two doing?! I’m telling you to kill her!”

Tang Qi soon noticed that both the warriors by his side looked nervous as they were walking backwards. He couldn’t help but scream once again.

“You fight her then, you rubbish!”

Both the respected warriors were mad as well after being shouted at by Tang Qi.

Rats leave the sinking ship. Tang Qi was the young master of the Tang Pavilion previously and this was why they would obey his commands.

Now that the Tang Pavilion has been annihilated and Tang Qing is dead, why should they still fight for Tang Qi?

This was a joke!

Then, at that moment, both the warriors ran.

“Hmph!!”

Ji Mei sneered. As her body moved, the sword in her arms was aimed at both the respected warriors who were trying to escape!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

She was moving the sword in her arms and there was a bright cold light that was released from her sword.

Both the warriors who were trying to run had their bodies cut in half!

Tang Qi, who has been acting fierce all along, fell to the ground when he saw such a bloody scene.

“Don’t…..don’t come any closer…..”

He had just realised that he was nothing.

With Ji Mei’s abilities, she would be able to kill him without breaking a sweat.

“Bingbing, Lanlan, I’ll leave him to the both of you.”

Ji Mei glanced at Tang Qi before telling the two girls.

“Sure!”

These girls may look soft but they were sage warriors who were at their peaks.

With their weapons in their hands, they started walking towards Tang Qi.

“Both you b*tches!!! You better leave or I’ll destroy the Hao Yue Sect!”

Tang Qi subconsciously grabbed onto his weapon as well and pointed it at the girls who were getting closer to him.

“Do you think that with you and your stinky mouth, you will be able to destroy the Hao Yue Sect?”

Bingbing asked in a cold tone.

Then, Lanlan attacked him without any hesitation!

Clang clang clang – –

There were sounds of metals colliding with each other and it was followed by a loud, painful cry. Tang Qi’s body then soon fell onto the ground.

“Damn…”

Elder Lin and the Right Guardian noticed this as well and the looks on their faces became even uglier.

Other than Elder Bai, who managed to escape, they were the only two left in the Tang Sect.

“Now, this is the last battle.”

Lin Xiu, whose body was floating in the air, looked at Elder Lin and the Right Guardian.

“Young man, you need to know your limits.”

Elder Lin warned Lin Xiu in a serious tone.

The right guardian had an awful look on his face as well.

The array had trapped them and there was no way where they could leave. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The only choice that they had left was to fight Lin Xiu.

“Enough with the nonsense, I’m waiting for a level-up.”

Lin Xiu sneered.

A level-up?

Both of the men were confused after hearing what Lin Xiu said.

“We have no other choice, Elder Lin. We have to kill him.”

The right guardian took a deep breath before telling Elder Lin.

“En.”

Elder Lin nodded his head in agreement.

This array was incredibly odd and there was no way where they could break it open.

The only thing that they could do now was to fight Lin Xiu till the very end.

They have to kill Lin Xiu.

With the control of their mind, there were source marks that slowly appeared on their foreheads.

Boom – –

The right guardian had an ice element source mark which caused the whole place to be covered with ice.

Soon, there were large blocks of air that appeared in the air and soon it looked like huge ice picks!

“Go!!!!!”

With his command, these ice picks then headed toward Lin Xiu!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

At that instant, there were noises that sounded like the air around them was being pierced.

Lin Xiu’s body was still floating in the air and he remained motionless.

Go to hell!!

The right guardian screamed deep inside his heart.

Lin Xiu was still standing in the way. He was definitely asking for it!

These ice picks weren’t things that could be blocked by his ‘sphere’!

“Did you really think that I would be afraid of these ice picks?”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

He had the Heart of Frost and his control over the power of the ice element were stronger than anyone else.

Without using much strength, all of the ice picks that came from different directions, froze the second before it touched Lin Xiu’s body.
