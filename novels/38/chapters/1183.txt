1184 The Underground Battle 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Where did you get it?”

Mr Lui asked the man who was standing behind him and asked about Little Bai.

When the men heard what he said, the looks in their eyes changed.

Then, they stood beside Mr Lui and spoke in a soft voice.

Lin Xiu didn’t get to hear what they were saying since they were being very soft.

“I’m sorry but our members were the ones who captured this evolved beast. Even if it used to be your pet, we won’t be able to give it to you now.”

Mr Lui told Lin Xiu their decision after hearing what the man said to him.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

“When you captured it, did you also capture another evolved beast with it?”

When the man heard the question from Lin Xiu, he was stunned.

“Answer him.”

Mr Lui glared at the man and then got him to answer Lin Xiu’s question.

“Yes, we did.”

“There was a lady who said that the evolved beast was hers as well. She is now at our venue now.”

The other man nodded his head.

“Oh? There was someone else who said the same thing?”

Mr Lui suddenly showed an interested look in his eyes.

When Lin Xiu heard what they said, there was a drastic change in his expression.

Could it be…

“Look. There is another woman who is saying that these evolved beasts are her pets as well. I don’t know if you are both only using this as an excuse to take these beasts from us but you have indeed beaten up my men. So…”

Mr Lui smiled.

There was a murderous intention in his eyes.

“Where is your venue? What is it?”

Lin Xiu didn’t bother answering his question and instead, he changed the topic.

“It’s an underground wrestling ring.”

Mr Lui didn’t think that Lin Xiu would suddenly bring it up but he still answered Lin Xiu.

“Right! You have a chance right now. Win three of the matches and you can take away this evolved beast with you.”

Mr Lui suddenly thought of something and offered Lin Xiu something different.

They had an underground wrestling ring. The rules there were for the warriors to fight each other for the treasure. The last one standing on stage would walk away with the reward.

As soon as they enter the ring, they will be responsible for their own lives and they will have to beat their opponent with whatever methods that they have.

The ring was gruesome. This was also the reason why it attracted a lot of audience who found these interesting.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu answered him without any hesitation.

Lin Xiu knew that Baili Haoling was here in the warrior god realm as well.

This was because she was the one who had been taking care of his pets.

According to what the men said, it was possible that Baili Haoling and Rollie were at the wrestling ring!

“Bring him along!”

Mr Lui looked at the rest of the men with a smirk on his face.

He only took these as an interesting game.

“Of course.”

The rest of the men looked at Lin Xiu cautiously and led the way to the wrestling ring.

Lin Xiu gently patted the head of Little Bai who was sitting on his shoulder and followed the other men.

Xiao Bai seemed excited to see Lin Xiu after being away from him for a long time.

It kept running his head all over Lin Xiu’s neck.

With the other warriors guiding the way, Lin Xiu walked over to the opposite street. Then, they walked through a huge door and entered the ‘venue’ that they’ve been talking about.

“Kill him!”

“Kill him!”

Lin Xiu could hear the loud and excited voices as soon as he walked through the doors.

The entrance was dark but when they got inside the ‘venue’ everything became bright.

“This is the largest underground battlefield in Manhuang City. Due to the meeting that will be happening soon, this place has been getting crowded.”

Mr Lui looked at the scene before his eyes as he muttered to himself.

When Lin Xiu first got into the venue, he took a good look at the place that he was at. There was a wrestling ring in front of him and there were already two warriors who were battling it out.

Both of them were covered in blood. Their eyes were looking murderous as if they were ready to kill the other person.

Soon, both the warriors started another round of battle.

Limbs were cut off and blood splattered everyone which excited most of the audiences who were present.

Lin Xiu frowned when he saw what was happening on stage.

“Look. I can allow you to walk away with the ice white crystal bird but according to the rules here, you would have to win at least 3 rounds of battle.”

Mr Lui glanced at Lin Xiu before explaining it to him.

He thought that Lin Xiu would be afraid once he saw the battle fired but he didn’t think that Lin Xiu would still remain so calm.

This got Mr Lui to get curious about Lin Xiu.

He badly wanted to see how Lin Xiu would tremble in fear once he got on the ring.

“The other beast that came along with it. Where is it?”

Lin Xiu looked at the rest of them as he asked about Rollie.

When the warriors heard the question, they turned towards Mr Lui first.

He quickly nodded his head.

“On the other side. The battle is about to start soon.”

One of the warriors only answered Lin Xiu after getting permission from Mr Lui.

“Any warrior is welcome to sign up for the battle. The last one to remain standing would be the winner and he will win the treasure.”

Mr Lui smiled as he told Lin Xiu about the rules.

“Bring me there.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

Then, Mr Lui signalled one of the warriors around him.

“This way.”

The warrior nodded his head before leading the way.

Here in the underground battlefield, there were different areas which made it difficult to find their direction while being inside the venue.

“Hehe! Little girl, my eyes are locked onto your pet!”

As Lin Xiu walked into the other area, he heard a harsh voice that was loud.

It was a muscular warrior who was standing inside the right with an axe on his shoulder.

“It belongs to me!!!”

The young girl opposite him screamed on top of her lungs.

There was blood coming out of the corner of her mouth and she looked like she was in trouble.

“Hahahahaha…..Grey Bear! She’s such a cute young girl. You shouldn’t just kill her!”

“Hehe! You should at least shred her clothes into pieces first before torturing her slowly…”

The rest of the audience started laughing as well.

The young girl started feeling enraged.

The warrior who was known as ‘grey bear’ was a powerful opponent.

The young girl tightened her grips of both her swords.

She was ready to attack.

“Haoling.”

Just as she was about to attack the man before her, she heard a familiar voice.

The young girl was shocked. When she turned to see who it was, her eyes widened in shock.
