1157 Destroying the Xiantian Pavilion

As the huge phoenix rushed towards his body, the entire phoenix then turned into a large flaming tornado.

It was spinning like crazy!

Boom – –

The entire ground started shaking vigorously.

“What’s happening…..to Xiantian Mansion?!”

The members of the Xiantian Pavillion turned towards the mansion.

“Don’t worry. It must be the pavilion teaching the amateurs.”

One of the warriors sneered when he saw what was happening.

From their perspectives, Lin Xiu was definitely being tortured by the pavillion master of the Xiantian Pavillion.

“Ahhhhhh!!!!”

However, they didn’t think that it was their master who was screaming instead.

The temperature of the flame was too high. Even if he had used up all of the energy in his body to strengthen his ‘sphere’, he could still feel the scorching heat from the tornado as he was completely tangled in it.

It felt as if his entire body was about to melt.

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s body appeared at the entrance.

Lin Xiu wiped away the blood from the corner of his mouth and he could still feel an intense pain coming from his chest.

In the beginning, when he was hit by the old man, Lin Xiu did suffer minor injuries.

If it wasn’t because of the warrior god suit that was gifted by the system that blocked part of the impact, Lin Xiu’s heart could have been crushed from the impact.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath. He glared at the old man who was being covered in flames. Then, Lin Xiu closed his eyes in order to find where the old man was before rushing into the tornado!

“You’re dead!!!”

The old man who was still trying to defend against the flame tornado, he could see Lin Xiu getting closer to him.

The old man roared and the huge purple eye behind him started glowing brightly.

However, Lin Xiu did not stop. He gripped onto his spear and rushed into the tornado!

This was impossible!

When the old man saw what happened, the look in his eyes changed drastically.

But soon, he realised that Lin Xiu had his eyes closed!

From the very beginning, Lin Xiu had already noticed that something wasn’t right with the huge eye figure behind the old man.

He realised that as soon as he looked at it, his entire body would be frozen and he could no longer move.

“Go…..to hell!!!!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were closed as he was finding his target with his other senses. He shouted out loud as he drew an arc in the air with his long spear.

‘Profound Intent – Heaven Breaking Strike!’

“Nooooo!!!!”

The old man could clearly feel how horrible it was and he screamed at the top of his lungs.

Boom – —

With the terrifying energy that came from the warrior skills, the old man’s ‘sphere’ that had already been weakened, immediately exploded.

The energy from the ‘Profound Intent – Heaven Breaking Strike’ instantly hit his body.

Without the protection from his ‘sphere’, the energy from it was incredibly strong.

The body of the old man instantly splited into two!

At the same time, with the flame tornado that was burning from before, the entire Xiantian Mansion was burning brightly.

All of the wires around started burning as well and there were loud explosions that followed one after another.

Lin Xiu gathered his thoughts and quickly left the mansion.

Soon, the huge Xiantian Mansion was slowly collapsing so quickly that everyone could see the building falling apart!

Those who were around the mansion ran toward it.

This distinguished building was about to fall apart and it would definitely catch everyone’s attention.

“Why…..did the Xiantian Mansion collapse?”

Most of the warriors were shocked as they couldn’t believe their eyes.

As they took a closer look, they noticed that there was a man glowing with a golden light, standing on top of the Xiantian Pavillion.

“Look! Who’s that?”

Most of them turned towards Lin Xiu who was floating in the air above the mansion.

All of them felt frightened when they saw him.

“From now on, there will be no Xiantian Pavillion.”

Lin Xiu took a look at the warriors who were standing around the mansion before speaking to them.

The strongest warrior from the Xiantian Pavillion should be the old man from before.

Most of them who were city lords would be new warrior gods who have joined this place. It would be normal for them to be bullied by the old man.

However, he wasn’t someone ordinary.

With the help of his system, other than those who were at the peak of a warrior god, no one would be able to beat him.

“Who do you think you are?!”

“Kill him!”

At that moment, most of the members from the Xiantian Pavilion were furious after hearing what was said. They quickly moved and went straight for Lin Xiu.

“Huh?” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

Then, he grabbed his long spear and moved it across the sky.

The long spear drew an arc in the air and it went after the warriors!

Boom boom boom – –

There were soft groans that were heard and soon, all of their bodies were torn into pieces before the energy that Lin Xiu had released.

Seeing what had happened, most of the members of the Xiantian Pavilion were shocked.

Those who rushed toward Lin Xiu were mostly sage warriors. How were they so easily killed by Lin Xiu?

“Kill him!!!!!”

Then, there were still a large number of members from the Xiantian Pavillion who weren’t very wise, and started attacking Lin Xiu who was floating in the air.

But, Lin Xiu did not look scared at all.

He continued moving the long spear in his hand and continued releasing his warrior skills.

With the ‘Full Blown Profound Intent’ activated, all of his skills were now with profound intent.

All of them were extremely powerful.

Most warriors would not be able to stop it.

Therefore, there were bodies of the warriors that continuously fell to the ground.

Within a short period of time, all of the members of the Xiantian Pavilion were either dead or injured.

“Anyone else?”

Lin Xiu looked at the other warriors. There weren’t many members left as he spoke.

“He isn’t human!”

The remaining warriors screamed and quickly flee like flocks of birds.

This man was incredibly terrifying. It was as if he was the undefeatable war god. Who would be stupid enough to challnege him now?

Only idiots would do so.

Lin Xiu sneered and he ignored all of them before returning to the City Lord Council.

He still had things that he wanted to ask Mr Pang.

“Sir, you’re back?”

Mr Pang, who was cleaning the City Lord Council, saw Lin Xiu who was floating in the air and his eyes clearly showed that he was surprised.
