Chapter 1005: Come Again

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

This time, there were three Sage warriors and a hundred peak Respected warriors from the Divine Domain.

In a short period of time, he was the only one left.

He simply could not accept this.

“I am going to kill you!!!”

At this moment, Huangfu Bo roared in a piercing voice.

!!

At this moment, the clothes on his body burst open.

On the body, a large number of golden words appeared immediately.

what is this!?

At this time, Huangfu Bo was muttering to himself with his hands together.

Lin Xiu didn’t know what he was saying.

But the words he said seemed a little weird.

He sounded as if he was chanting scriptures and when it was transmitted to Lin Xiu’s mind, Lin Xiu frowned.

boom boom boom —

With a loud noise, at this moment, in the high sky above, this Sage warrior space was broken open again!

“Um!?”

In the outside world, Yi Zhangkong and others saw that the space was broken open again and the pupils in their eyes shrank slightly.

“What is happening!?”

Some Sage warriors looked at this scene and showed surprise.

Yi Zhangkong raised his eyes and looked up into the sky and found that the entire sky turned pitch black at this moment.

The thunder and lightning flashed and the wind surged.

“Something’s going to happen.”

Seeing this scene, Yi Zhangkong seemed to feel something and said aloud as if talking to himself.

Lin Xiu, who was in the Sage warrior Space, looked at Huangfu Bai’s strange state and suddenly remembered what happened before.

His expression suddenly changed.

Without the slightest hesitation, he directly waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

boom boom boom —

As the Dark Edge spear waved, all of a sudden, terrifying dark blue flame birds charged towards Huangfu Bai!

boom boom boom —

When those flaming birds were about to hit Huangfu Bai’s body, the “Sphere” he unfolded instantly blocked all these attacks!

Damn it!

Without the slightest hesitation, Lin Xiu rushed forward with the spear in his hand!

boom–

The spear attacked at his ‘Sphere’ and a huge sound erupted in an instant.

But at this moment, Huangfu Bai’s body was stagnant in the air, not shaking at all!

Now he was still chanting the weird words and a golden light shone in from the broken space.

It directly irradiated Huangfu Bai’s body!

‘God Descend’!

Lin Xiu, who saw this scene, was even more certain that the current Huangfu Bai was performing God descend!

In the previous competition, the two warriors from the Divine Domain used this method to gain power.

Directly from Respected warrior level to Sage warrior.

This Huangfu Bai, without a doubt, also used this method.

It’s just that Huangfu Bai was now at the Sage warrior level. If he uses this ‘God Descend’ again, then the power he gets…

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu frantically attacked the ‘Sphere’ he unfolded. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

bang bang bang-

Following Lin Xiu’s attack, a loud sound rang out.

But there was still no way to break his ‘Sphere’ directly.

And as those golden rays of light shone on his body, slowly, Huangfu Bai’s entire body became swelled up.

His white hair was slowly turning black at a speed visible to the naked eye.

The slightly wrinkled skin on the body gradually tightened.

It’s like… he was turning younger!

“Ah!!!”

In the next moment, he opened his mouth wide and let out a huge roar.

As this huge roar came out, the entire space seemed to vibrate.

Lin Xiu, who was holding the Dark Edge spear and wanted to break his ‘Sphere’, was shocked by the huge roar at this moment and retreated to the back.

Lin Xiu’s body flew out like a broken kite.

But soon, Lin Xiu stabilized his body.

Wiping the blood on his lips, he looked forward and far away and the figure of Huangfu Bai was already suspended in the air.

As the golden light continued to converge on his body and he roared loudly.

Huangfu Bai seemed to be in great pain.

But in the same way, as the incomparably powerful force poured into his body, Lin Xiu felt an extremely strong sense of oppression.

Damn it, he still can’t stop it!

At this moment, the artificial angel on the ground has already waved the spear in her hand and rushed over there!

The huge spear was filled with white light.

He directly attacked Huangfu Bai who was suspended in the air!

Boom—

The spear hit Huangfu Bai’s “Sphere” directly.

But he still couldn’t break Huangfu Bai’s “Sphere”!

And what’s even weirder was that now Huangfu Bai’s “Sphere” has turned golden!

“Boy! I want you to die!”

At this moment, Huangfu Bai stopped roaring and looked at Lin Xiu in the distance.

Looking at the artificial angel who was attacking him, his figure moved and he directly attacked the artificial angel!

Boom—

In the next moment, the artificial angel’s body was directly blasted back to the back.

The huge body fell directly to the ground.

What a powerful force!

Seeing this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly.

swoosh—

Just when Lin Xiu was about to make a move, the figure of Huangfu Bai appeared directly in front of Lin Xiu!

He didn’t have any weapons in his hand and directly attacked Lin Xiu’s body with his fist!

Dang–

At this time, Lin Xiu also reacted very quickly and directly blocked his attack with the spear in his hand.

But the power of Huangfu Bai’s punch was too powerful. Although Lin Xiu blocked his attack, his entire body was still sent flying to the back.

“Dare to absorb my divine power, you are courting death!”

At this time, Huangfu Bai’s voice was obviously different from the one just now.

It seems to be… one of the voices that appeared when the two warriors were using ‘God Descend’.

Warrior God!

Huangfu Bai, obtained the power of the Warrior God through ‘God Descend’!

The moment he finished speaking, his figure appeared in front of Lin Xiu again.

‘Flashing Souls’!

But in the same way, Lin Xiu’s figure, at this moment, also disappeared.

Huangfu Bai frowned, but soon, he seemed to feel something and his figure also disappeared.

Just when Lin Xiu’s figure appeared on the other side, the figure of Huangfu Bai also instantly appeared in front of Lin Xiu!

At this moment, Huangfu Bai has a faint golden light emerging from his body.

His source strength turned out to be golden!
