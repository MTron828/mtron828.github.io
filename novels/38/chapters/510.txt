Chapter 511: Come Knocking

Another member of the Chen family also said aloud at this time.

“Must kill him! How dare he beat my godson like this!” Chen Jinqian’s mother said with tears at this time.

“Alright, it’s all your fault for spoiling him!” Chen Jinqian’s father said coldly.

He knew his son’s character. He used the power of the Chen family to act absurdly in Bai Di City previously but this time he didn’t expect to get into trouble.

“But can those killers really kill him? I heard that the kid’s strength is extraordinary.” At this time, one of the men said aloud while smoking a cigarette.

After all, everyone in the Chen family was alarmed when something like this happened.

Many Chen family members were in this ward now.

“Hng! Those are top killers, he is dead meat.” A man said coldly at this time. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

When the others heard his words, they nodded.

Those assassins are all rank 5 warriors, and they were good at assassination. The average warrior would definitely die.

“What if he survives?” At this moment, a voice came from behind.

Everyone who heard this voice turned their heads and looked behind, and they could clearly see a young man walking up with his arms around a man’s shoulders.

“He said he’s Young master Chen’s friend and came to see Young master Chen.” At this time, a nurse hurried up from behind and said, out of breath. This was the intensive care unit so no ordinary personnel could come here at all.

“You may take a leave.” A middle-aged man waved to the nurse and said.

When the nurse heard the man’s words, she immediately left the place like she had received a pardon.

She knew that those in there were all from the Chen family, and most of the people in the Chen family were fierce and violent. She was so terrified that if she accidentally provoked any of them, her life would be over.

“Are you Jinqian’s friend?” Chen Jinqian’s father looked at Lin Xiu at this time, and then said with a frown.

“Who?” Lin Xiu frowned and asked – his friend?

“Why, don’t you recognize me?” As Lin Xiu walked in, Chen Jinqian’s expression suddenly changed.

He opened his eyes and opened his mouth slightly, looking at Lin Xiu as if he saw a ghost.

As for the man who came with Lin Xiu, his body was also trembling at this time.

He has been a killer for so long, and he has never encountered such a thing.

He was actually held hostage by the assassination target and came here to find the one who employed him.

“What’s wrong?” At this time, the Chen family who arranged for the killer to kill Lin Xiu also walked out of the bathroom.

As soon as he walked out, he saw the man next to Lin Xiu, his expression suddenly changed.

“Why are you here?!”

He clearly sent this man to assassinate Lin Xiu, how could he suddenly come to him?

Upon closer inspection, he saw Lin Xiu standing next to the man. Although it was Lin Xiu’s side profile, he felt that this boy was very similar to the Lin Xiu he saw on the surveillance video before.

Seeing this, he was even more shocked, this guy has come knocking?

“What’s going on!?” The Chen family members present felt that something was wrong at this time.

“It’s him! It’s him!!!” Chen Jingqian went crazy at this time, looking at Lin Xiu, his eyes were full of fear.

“You are the one who beat up my son!?” Chen Jingqian’s father also came to his senses at this moment, and looked at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

The Chen family was shocked. They had no idea that Lin Xiu not only was not killed by the killer, he even came to find them!

“Courting death!” Two of the Chen family’s bodyguards reacted quickly at this time, and then attacked Lin Xiu!

Although Lin Xiu was holding a long spear in his right hand, watching them attack at this time, he didn’t need to move the long spear in his hand. He kicked with his right leg and kicked the two men directly onto the opposite wall!

Chen Jinqian’s father was also a warrior. Just when he was about to move, he saw the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand move, and the tip of the spear appeared in front of his forehead in an instant.

As long as Lin Xiu exerts a slight force, the spear can penetrate his head directly.

“Stop it!” Everyone in the Chen family was shocked when they saw this scene.

“Do you know who we are!” The man from the Chen family who sent the killer to kill Lin Xiu also looked at Lin Xiu with an ugly expression.

“Aren’t you guys the Chen family from Bai Di City?” Lin Xiu stared at him, and then said faintly.

“Glad you know that. Do you know what the consequences will be if you dare to kill anyone here now!?” Although this man was shocked on the inside, he still acted calmly on the surface.

“Your family will die!” The man looked at Lin Xiu and continued threatening.

“You’re threatening me?” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said aloud.

Without waiting for these people to answer, Lin Xiu continued, “The people from the Zhao family also threatened me like this.”

“Do you know the consequences?”

Zhao’s family!?

When Lin Xiu mentioned the Zhao family, everyone in the Chen family was shocked.

Although their Chen family was a large force in Bai Di City, they were still not qualified to be compared to the leading Zhao family.

“What did you do!?” a man said in surprise.

“It’s nothing, I went to their Zhao family and killed someone named Zhao Xia.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

Zhao Xia!?

After hearing this name, many people came to their senses.

Isn’t Zhao Xia a direct descendant of the Zhao family? Although Zhao Xia was a hedonistic son, but he was someone from the Zhao family after all. He actually rushed into Zhao’s house and killed Zhao Xia?!

Although it was still unclear whether it is true or false, if this is true, this man would be too scary…

“Okay, it’s time to put an end to this.” Lin Xiu glanced at Chen Jingqian who was lying on the bed and said.

“No! Don’t kill me!” Seeing Lin Xiu easily restraining his father, Chen Jingqian’s expression changed drastically.

Moreover, his limbs were still unable to move at this time, and he was here now, he would undoubtedly die.

“I’m going all out with you!” Chen Jingqian’s mother yelled, and was about to rush towards Lin Xiu.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” unfolded instantly, and she bounced back, and because of the paralyzing effect of the lightning on the “Sphere”, she fainted.

Rank 6 warrior!?

The rest of the Chen family were dumbfounded when they saw the “Sphere” unfolding around Lin Xiu’s body, and they were even more frightened.
