Chapter 98: The Warrior Assessment Begins!

“You…” The tall, thin man looked at the long spear running through his chest incredulously, then went silent.

“Ding~~”

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 2 warrior. You’ve gained 150,000 experience points!”

Lin Xiu curled his lips. It was getting harder and harder to level up, and killing a rank 2 warrior only gave him 150,000 experience.

“It’s done?” Just then, a familiar voice came from behind.

Lin Xiu turned around and saw that above the window behind him, Baili Haoling was sitting there, sipping coffee.

“When did you come?” Lin Xiu was stunned and asked.

“From the time they barged in.” Baili Haoling thought about it and said.

“You’ve been here all this while?” Lin Xiu gasped. This was too scary. If Baili Haoling wanted to assassinate him, he would probably be dead by now.

“Your skills are not bad, seems like you’ve benefited a lot from all the training these days.” Baili Haoling jumped down at this moment and said approvingly.

Lin Xiu nodded. Baili Haoling was right; when that midget wanted to use his sharp nails to cut Lin Xiu’s neck, Lin Xiu had already covered his body in source strength, in addition to his tough body, which led to the midget’s failure.

“What are we going to do now?” Lin Xiu looked at the mess in the room and asked.

“Don’t worry, someone’s going to take care of it,” Baili Haoling said while he took his phone out to look at the time, then continued, “It’s almost time, the warrior qualification exam is about to start.”

‘Oh right!’

Lin Xiu came to his senses at this moment. It was already seven o’clock and the warrior exam was at nine o’clock sharp, it’s almost time.

Lin Xiu quickly grabbed a bite nearby and walked toward the designated point.

On the road, there were many warriors armed with all kinds of weapons on their backs walking in the same direction.

Lin Xiu secretly sized these people up and they were also checking Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling out.

Especially the android wolf which attracted a lot of people’s attention. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

In the northern part of Black Sea City, there was a Warrior Union branch.

The arena was spacious and there were many soldiers in camouflage uniforms standing there.

From their aura, one could clearly sense that they were at least rank 3.

It was indeed the branch of the Warrior Union and they took a lot of precautions.

There were more and more warriors present, almost two hundred people!

It was very lively.

“The warrior qualification assessment begins at 9 o’clock. Warriors who had signed up, please submit the reference card here, then proceed to the North Court for combat strength testing.” At this moment, next to the front door in front, a beautiful female staff member smiled at the warriors around.

Hearing her instructions, the warriors began to queue up and submitted their reference cards in an orderly manner, then went into the Warrior Union hall.

“I’ll go over there first, I’ll look for you later.” Baili Haoling was riding on top of the android wolf and said to Lin Xiu.

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu nodded. This cheap master was so strong, he should have already obtained the warrior certification, right?

Lin Xiu didn’t think much of it and continued queuing up there.

“Make way, make way!” Just then, a man who looked as strong as a mountain came to the front and directly pushed the people in the queue.

This strong man chuckled as he looked at Lin Xiu who was standing in front and walked toward him.

“That boy is in trouble. This chap is Bi Biqiu and I heard that he has been assessed last year, but he was disqualified because he killed someone in the hall.” A guy saw this strong man and couldn’t help but tremble while saying. He seemed to have recalled last year’s scene and appeared quite fearful.

“Boy, I told you to move, let me get to the front, do you understand?” Bi Biqiu stretched out his hand which was the size of two people’s palms and grabbed Lin Xiu’s body.

He wanted to lift Lin Xiu up.

“Don’t touch me.” Lin Xiu turned around at this moment, his right hand grabbed Bi Biqiu’s big wrist, then he twisted it.

“Ah!!!” A cry came out of Bi Biqiu’s mouth in an instant.

‘It hurts, it hurts so badly!’

Also, Lin Xiu’s hands were very strong and Bi Biqiu wanted to use force, but it was completely useless.

“A**hole!!!” Bi Biqiu was furious and his other fist slammed toward Lin Xiu’s body!

Lin Xiu raised his brows and smashed his fist over as well.

As the two fists collided, there was a sudden clear and crisp sound of bones breaking.

“You’d better go home this year,” Lin Xiu said indifferently. In the next moment, the cracking sound came from Bi Biqiu’s arm, and it sounded as if beans were being fried.

Under severe pain, everything before Bi Biqiu turned black and he fainted on the ground, letting out a dull sound.

Soon, nearby staff called the rescue team to carry Bi Biqiu away.

The rest of the warriors were dumbfounded.

A strong man as huge as a mountain was dealt with just like that!? It was so unexpected.

“I think people should queue up properly, don’t you think so?” Lin Xiu glanced at the people behind him and said plainly.

“Yes, we’re all civilized people. We have to queue up.” At this moment, a few people who wanted to cut the queue suddenly smiled and wiped the sweat off their foreheads, then lined up obediently.

Soon, as Lin Xiu submitted the reference card and verified whether the information was correct, he went through and headed into the hall.

Lin Xiu’s had a number stuck to his body at this moment and the assessment would probably be carried out in the sequence of this number.

He followed the person in front and walk to the so-called North Court.

There were already five huge combat strength test apparatus, each with a staff member next to it.

Those whose numbers were called out were already lined up and had started the testing.

Lin Xiu’s current strength was being suppressed to a rank 1 warrior, and it wouldn’t attract too much attention.

But he didn’t know if the combat strength test apparatus would be able to detect that he’s in the state of ‘Disguise’.
