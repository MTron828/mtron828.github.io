Chapter 284: Mutated Black Tooth Spider

Lin Xiu looked at the weird thing and revealed a look of surprise.

‘What the hell is this?’

Wait, could it be the so-called mutated Black Tooth Spider?

With that thought, Lin Xiu’s eyes suddenly changed, and he waved the spear in his right hand. A flaming bird burst out from the spearhead instantly and rushed straight at the Black Tooth Spider with the pale blue skin!

Bang–

The flaming bird hit the strange Black Tooth Spider and its flame instantly swept through it.

But that Black Tooth Spider was very weird. It didn’t care about the flames at all and rushed towards Lin Xiu at an extremely fast speed!

Damn!

Lin Xiu saw this scene and cursed in his heart.

He was gaining experience just now when a strange Black Tooth Spider that isn’t afraid of fire suddenly appeared.

“Guo Ling! Look, is that mutated?”

Lin Xiu did not hesitate to shout directly to Guo Ling behind.

Guo Ling was still holding a flamethrower and killing the Black Tooth Spiders that kept climbing up from the bottomless crack. Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, he instinctively turned and looked behind him.

“Mutated black tooth spider!?”

Its body was larger and it was really fast; it was about to approach them soon!

“It’s really mutated!?”

Lin Xiu saw that the appearance of this darn thing was different from the normal Black Tooth Spider and it was able to resist fire, so he thought it might be the so-called mutated Black Tooth Spider.

Hearing Guo Ling’s confirmation, when Lin Xiu was about to move, the Black Tooth Spider suddenly opened its mouth like a pair of huge black iron pincers and some threads shot past Lin Xiu’s body!

Ss ss ss–

Accompanied by a sound that gave one goosebumps, this large amount of thread was about to cover Lin Xiu’s entire person!

“Run!” The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted. At the next moment, with a violent wave of his right hand, his powerful source strength turned into the Red Lotus Fire and flew out directly.

The large amount of silk-like things that it spat out were all burned away at this moment.

Click, click, click——

Seeing that Lin Xiu had burned all the threads, this mutated Black Tooth Spider seemed enraged. The huge black pincers on its mouth were constantly biting and it charged directly towards Lin Xiu!

Damn it!

Lin Xiu cursed and leaped up at this moment!

Boom–

As Lin Xiu dodged, the huge pincers of the mutated Black Tooth Spider directly snapped off the branches of a giant tree behind.

Boom——

As the black tree fell, the surrounding ground vibrated, making a loud noise.

Dang–

Lin Xiu, who was in the air, attacked the mutated Black Tooth Spider with the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

But the skin of this mutated black tooth spider was like a natural protective shell. The tip of the spear pierced its back and made a crisp sound.

“Guo Ling! How are we going to catch it?” Qiu Li looked over and swallowed his spit.

This thing was too big, even killing it was tough, not to mention capture it alive.

“It shouldn’t be so big ah…”

The size of this thing was beyond Guo Ling’s expectations.

With such a huge body, it would definitely be a challenge to bring this mutated Black Tooth Spider back alive.

“Kill it first!”

Guo Ling thought for a moment and said. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After all, it was not realistic to bring this thing back alive and the mutated Black Tooth Spider wasn’t particularly rare so there would probably be more later.

Thye just had to find a smaller one and would be able to bring it back alive.

“No, these things keep climbing up…” Qian Lin took the flamethrower and sprayed the Black Tooth Spiders that were constantly climbing up, but it was obvious that the number of these Black Tooth Spiders showed no signs of decreasing.

On the contrary, because of the burning of this flame, it seems that these Black Tooth Spiders have become crazier and crazier.

Also, the flames were slowly becoming smaller. If this continues, the situation would become more and more dangerous.

“I’ll deal with these Black Tooth Spiders. You guys think about how to bring it back alive.” Lin Xiu initially wanted to continue attacking this mutated Black Tooth Spider, but he saw that the flames from the flamethrower were getting smaller.

It was clear that the flamethrower in their hands would not have any flames to release soon.

It would be very unfavorable for them to fight in close combat.

After all, these Black Tooth Spiders were all rank 6 evolved beasts!

They merely happened to find their weakness, that was why they could kill them so quickly.

“Well, let’s go!”

Guo Ling also understood this point. The flame of the flamethrower was activated and the flame ejected reached the maximum value.

Qiu Li and the others responded quickly to release all the energy stored in the flamethrower at once.

The entire ground seemed to turn into a sea of flames in an instant.

After doing all this, they threw the flamethrower in their hands on the ground and then directly took the weapon behind their back and attacked the mutant black tooth spider behind.

Lin Xiu stood where they were just now, looking under the bottomless crack, those Black Tooth Spiders were still climbing up continuously.

Lin Xiu looked at this scene not only without the slightest fear, but also with a hint of fire in his eyes.

These… were all experience points!

The mutant Black Tooth Spider seemed to be even angrier when he saw Guo Ling and others rushing over, his eyes were like red light bulbs.

Boom boom——

As its limbs continued to walk quickly, the ground made a vibrating sound again and again.

Kill! Guo Ling’s eyes changed and he took the lead in attacking the past with the long sword in his hand.

After all, it’s not the first time they went out for a mission, so they worked together very well.

Lin Xiu watched the flames emitted by the flamethrower disappear completely, then charged upwards wildly.

‘Awe of the phoenix’!!!

Lin Xiu smirked and waved the Dark Edge spear in his right hand as a large number of flaming birds rushed out!

Due to the Red Lotus Fire, the flaming birds were much stronger than the flames emitted by the flamethrowers.

As soon as these Black Tooth Spiders came into contact with the flaming birds, they exploded instantly!

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master on killing the rank 6 Black Tooth Spider and gaining 50 million experience!”
