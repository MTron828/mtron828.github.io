Chapter 198: Mutated Red-Eyed Dog

His eyes were still open as he was cleaved into two, as though he could not believe that he was dead.

After killing him, Luo Yue swung her hand and all the blood on her sword dropped off

She walked over to Lin Xiu, who was lying on the ground.

After multiple attempts, she lifted Lin Xiu up and got him to sit.

“You killed them all?” Lin Xiu looked at her.

Their close proximity allowed him to see her delicate face and her skin that seemed flawless.

Be it in his previous world or in this world, Luo Yue was definitely the most beautiful person he had ever seen.

Luo Yue nodded and noticed Lin Xiu staring at her. She frowned and hesitated for a moment, “Do I have something on my face?”

“Cough cough, no, nothing.” Lin Xiu shifted his gaze away awkwardly.

He had lost his energy and was out of strength.

He felt that it was a pity that they allowed Cheng Fan to run away alive.

“Are you hurt?” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu’s state curiously and after studying him, she realized that he did not have a single wound on him.

“Is this concern coming from you?” Lin Xiu smiled.

Bang-

Lin Xiu had just replied when Luo Yue’s expression became cold again. She immediately released her hand on his back and made him fall to the ground.

‘What a petty girl!’

Lin Xiu grimaced in pain upon falling to the ground.

“They will return.” Luo Yue suddenly said.

“You mean that guy? If he comes back, I’ll kill him.” Lin Xiu snorted while lying on the ground.

It was a pity that he only got an arm and not killed him.

“Do you know what the Moon Wings Corp is?” Luo Yue glanced at him and asked indifferently.

“An ordinary mercenary unit?” Lin Xiu was startled by her question and asked.

He truly did not know the Moon Wings Corp.

“You’re right that they are a mercenary unit, but they are in no way ordinary.” Luo Yue shook her head and took her phone out. She keyed in the phone and an image appeared before him.

Moon Wings Corp, the world’s strongest mercenary group that accepts all missions including assassination and sieging small countries.

Their members are not ordinary and even the most ordinary members were at least rank 5 or higher.

They had one specialty, that was ‘debt had to be repaid’.

As long as one of their members was killed, they would hunt the killer until the end of the world.

There was a record of a king of a small country in Africa that killed a member of the Moon Wings Corps. The country was razed to the ground in a week.

“What the hell, so rampant?!” Lin Xiu cried out with his eyes wide open when he saw the article.

“The union doesn’t care about them?” Lin Xiu asked.

Although there were territories for countries, most of the countries were allies and had a union leader.

It could even be said that Earth was one country.

Although there were still some standalone independent countries.

“Moon Wings Corp have people everywhere and many of them have concealed their identities. Most importantly, their leader is said to be a rank 9 warrior.” Luo Yue replied indifferently.

Rank 9 warrior?!

Lin Xiu sucked in cold air when he heard the explanation.

Rank 9 warriors were warriors that were extraordinarily strong!

“You think that that guy will bring his corp members over for revenge? That’s bullying, they can kill others but we can’t kill them? And they will take revenge?” Lin Xiu whined at the unfairness of the world.

“They see it that you are bullying them by attacking them.” Luo Yue nodded her head.

“It’s fine, no matter how many comes, we’ll just kill them.” Luo Yue looked towards the mist with a cold glare and said.

After resting for 10 minutes, Lin Xiu gradually recovered his strength and he stood up slowly.

The corpses had many odd crystals but they were all rank 3 or rank 4 crystals. They were not as useful for Lin Xiu.

He quickly used his cultivation technique and absorbed the energy within the odd crystals.

His source strength was greatly replenished from this.

The death of the warriors emitted a dense blood stench that made Lin Xiu scrunch his nose up.

It was unbearable.

Right at this time, strange sounds could be heard around them. Lin Xiu opened up his eyes wide.

‘What was that?!’

The mist around was extremely thick and they could vaguely make out the distance, but it was all white.

“Something’s coming.” Luo Yue became cautious.

There was never an opportunity to rest in here and every location seemed to be as dangerous as the next.

Lin Xiu focused on his hearing. The sound seemed to come closer. He turned and looked behind him.

He saw pairs of flaming eyes in the distance.

“Mutated Red Eye Dogs.” Luo Yue looked in the same direction and the gaze in her eyes changed as she explained.

Rank 5 evolved beast, Mutated Red Eye Dog.

The corrosion of the virus in their bodies stimulated a mutation that caused their bodies to be large, and with rot all over their exterior. They were extremely disgusting.

Their eyes were red and looked menacing.

Gulu gulu-

As the strange sounds became clearer, Lin Xiu could see sets of teeth inside their bloodied mouths.

There were traces of meat between their teeth and liquid flowing down from their mouths.

‘One, two, three…’

There were seven or eight of them!

They had pounced onto one of the corpses and devoured the entire body and did not even leave a single bone.

The sound of the bones being broken down caused Lin Xiu’s hair to stand.

“What do we do?” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue.

“Kill them.”

With that said, she charged towards the closest mutated red-eyed dog!

Lin Xiu followed up without hesitation.

The two that were like a pair of black and white shadows charged to the front!
