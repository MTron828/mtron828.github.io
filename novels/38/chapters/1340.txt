1341 Absorbing Like Mad

Although absorbing such powerful energy was good news, having it in access while having the ‘Cultivation Technique’ actively running, his body was already at its brink!

Huuuu–

Lin Xiu quickly calmed himself and continued absorbing the energy around him.

His entire body was in the pool so that every inch of his body would be able to absorb the energy.

Due to how Lin Xiu had unlocked the gene lock, Lin Xiu was able to breathe through his skin.

Although the oxygen content inside the pool was low, it was already sufficient for Lin Xiu.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng soon came out of the pool, panting while trying to catch their breath.

Without any oxygen, even if they had good lungs, they would not be able to stay inside any longer.

“An hour. That’s not too bad.”

Riyan God Lord was sitting on a rocking chair nearby. He smiled when he saw Yuan Zheng and Xiao Qingchen.

“Where did he go?”

Xiao Qingchen looked around and noticed that T

ianling God King was not around.

But, it was expected as the God King would not be sitting around, waiting for them.

Yuan Zheng looked at the Riyan God Lord as well.

Could it be that Lin Xiu had already come up once and returned into the pool?

From their perspectives, being able to stay longer inside the pool would bring them more benefit.

If he got out once, it would mean that his cultivation got paused halfway and the energy that he could absorb in the second round would give him much less effect.

“Him? You mean Lin Xiu? He hasn’t come up yet.”

Riyan God Lord gave a casual reply.

He was shocked as well.

Lin Xiu has been inside the pool for quite some time and has not come out of it yet.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng looked at each other after hearing what the God Lord said. They took a deep breath and went back into the pool!

Lin Xiu, on the other hand, was still cultivating inside the bloody pool.

There was no need for him to come out of it.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations master on the upgrade. You are now at level 73!”

The system rang a notification but Lin Xiu ignored it and continued cultivating and absorbing the energy around him.

‘Engulf’ was still active and was running automatically.

Then, his system automatically turned the energy into EXP.

“Hmm?”

Riyan God King, who was by the side of the pool, turned back and looked at the pool. He noticed that the level of water inside had lowered.

“Perhaps I saw it wrongly?”

Riyan God Lord rubbed his eyes and he looked confused.

This wouldn’t be possible. How could any absorb all the energy inside the pool so quickly?

He winced a little but closed his eyes and continued napping.

After some time, Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng came out of the water once again.

They couldn’t take it anymore. If they stayed any longer inside the pool, their bodies would have exploded.

“Hmm? You can’t stand it anymore?”

Seeing how both of them jumped out of the pool, Riyan God Lord smiled as he asked gently.

Both of them were talented as they were able to stay inside until now.

As long as they are able to cultivate and digest all of the energy that they have absorbed here, their abilities will definitely improve.

“I can’t take it anymore.”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng put on their combat suits and their bodies were trembling.

It felt as if the energy from inside the pool was stretching out their bodies.

It was like a balloon that had been filled. If they pumped any more gas into it, the balloon would just break.

It would definitely take some time to digest all of the energies inside.

“What about him? He hasn’t come up yet?”

Yuan Zheng’s body was also stretched out to its brim.

He looked around and still did not see Lin Xiu.

“He hasn’t come out yet.”

Riyan God Lord shrugged his shoulders.

“He hasn’t come up yet?”

Xiao Qingchen felt confused.

...

“He hasn’t come up? Not even once?”

Both of them have already come out twice.

But, none of them saw Lin Xiu.

“Nope.”

Riyan God Lord nodded his head.

That dude!

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng’s eyes turned red. In addition to the first time that they’ve come up, they have already come out of the water thrice.

But….Lin Xiu hasn’t even come up once.

“Would it be possible that he drowned….?”

Yuan Zheng couldn’t help but suggest the worst thing that he could think of.

“Can’t you feel his breath of life?”

...

Riyan God Lord peered at them.

His breath of life…

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng quickly tried to locate Lin Xiu.

Soon, they could clearly feel that there was a powerful yet terrifying breath of life inside the pool.

It was incredibly strong!

“He….is indeed a monster.”

Xiao Qingchen couldn’t help but comment on it.

“Well, if you want to head back, you can.”

“Or…you can also continue your cultivation here.”

Riyan God Lord looked at them and gave them the option.

“I will be staying here.”

Xiao Qingchen thought about it and sat cross-legged on the ground.

He wanted to see how long Lin Xiu would be able to stay inside the pool!

Yuan Zheng also hesitated for a moment and decided to stay.

He also wanted to see how long Lin Xiu could stay inside.

Yuan Zheng felt defeated by just thinking about it.

Time passed but Lin Xiu was still at the bottom of the pool.

He continued cultivating with his ‘Cultivation Technique’ while ‘Engulf’ was absorbing the energy inside the pool and turning them into EXP.

If he stayed here, he would have been able to upgrade one to two levels!

Although that’s what he wanted, his body was already stretched to its maximum.

The energy that he had absorbed into his body could not be immediately digested.

So, the speed at which they were getting digested was much slower than how his body was absorbing the energy from the pool.

His entire body had expanded.

Lin Xiu now looked like an obese man.

Damn! He can’t take it anymore!

Five minutes later, Lin Xiu could no longer stand it.

His body then flew to the surface.

Whoosh– –

As Lin Xiu rushed out of the pool, the sound of water splashing everywhere woke Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng.

Then, they saw Lin Xiu standing next to the pool.

“This fellow finally came out…..”

Xiao Qingchen clenched his jaw. They wanted for so long before Lin Xiu came out.

Along with how bloated Lin Xiu looked, he must have absorbed a crazy amount of energy!

“Damn it! A little more!”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but curse.

This was because with the help of ‘Engulf’, he almost got to another level!
