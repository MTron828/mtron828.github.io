Chapter 686 Shocked People

Lin Xiu’s beard has fallen off!

Also, a layer of skin on his face seemed to have sloughed off.

Obviously, the skin that Lin Xiu showed before was not real.

“Um?”

Lin Xiu touched his beard subconsciously at this time, and found that his beard had fallen off at some point.

It probably dropped during the battle just now.

Never mind.

Lin Xiu didn’t think much about it at this time, he just pulled the layer of skin on his face with force, and it was immediately pulled off.

Lin Xiu’s original face was revealed. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Anyway, no one here knew him at all, and Lin Xiu was not afraid of his face being seen by others.

Comfortable.

After recovering his original face, his originally tensed cheeks suddenly felt relaxed.

Chen Lan and the others widened their eyes even more at this time.

Because the current Lin Xiu’s face really surprised them too much.

Too young “Why, don’t you know me?”

Lin Xiu watched Lei Tong’s eyes widen, and at this moment he couldn’t help but smile and said.

“Fuck, Brother Lin, this… is this your original face?”

Lei Tong rubbed his eyes at this time, still looking at Lin Xiu in disbelief.

“Of course.”

Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

“You’re only twenty years old?” Lei Tong secretly swallowed his saliva and said, after all, Lin Xiu was too young to have such a powerful force, this was really too terrifying… “Twenty?”

Lin Xiu was stunned, then shook his head.

“Sure enough, Brother Lin just looks young…” Hearing Lin Xiu’s answer, Lei Tong couldn’t help but heaved a sigh of relief.

After all, for him, if Lin Xiu was so young and had the strength to defeat these rank 8 warriors, it would be too terrifying.

“Almost eighteen.”

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then said aloud.

Pff

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Lei Tong almost stumbled and fell to the ground.

“You’re not yet eighteen!?”.

Lei Tong’s eyes were round, and his mouth was wide enough to fit an egg.

After Chen Lan and others heard Lei Tong’s words, they were also stunned.

He hadn’t turned eighteen and was able to kill all three rank eight warriors with overwhelming strength!

This strength, even if he had not reached rank 9, he should be really close right?

“What are you surprised about, there are quite a few warriors with such strength in Sky City.”

Lin Xiu indifferently spread his hands and said.

But there were very few people who were as young as you!

Lei Tong complained in his heart. “All… all killed?”

At the same time, a figure came over from the other side, looked at the bodies of those people on the ground, and was in shock.

“Boss Jiang.”

When Chen Lan saw the middle-aged man walking over, he said aloud at this time.

“Sorry, we caused trouble.” “Old Chen, aren’t these people those hateful people? Are they the traffickers? You killed them?” said the middle-aged man who was called Boss Jiang.

“No, Brother Lin killed them.”

Chen Lan shook her head, then looked at Lin Xiu.

Boss Jiang also looked at Lin Xiu, and when he saw the blood on the Dark Edge spear that Lin Xiu was holding, he couldn’t help shivering. After taking a closer look at Lin Xiu’s face, he was even more shocked.

So young?!
