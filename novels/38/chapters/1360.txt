1361 Energy Liquid

That thing is obviously its core heart!

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate at this moment, a ball of lotus fire appeared in the palm of his hand.

With Lin Xiu’s sudden wave of his hand, the lotus fire was released in an instant, and directly charged toward the core!

“die!!!”

!!

But at this moment, the body of the Black Iron Tree King moved sideways to the other side.

Its roots were constantly moving, just like it has thousands of little feet, quickly fleeing to the other side.

Boom——

At this time, the lotus fire hit the nearby area.

Suddenly, an extremely loud sound erupted.

“Want to escape?”

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he immediately sneered.

Just now, this darn thing caused him a lot of trouble. Now it’s trying to flee before he could defeat it – how could Lin Xiu let it happen?

Lin Xiu’s figure moved, and he continued to display his body skills, and instantly appeared in front of the black iron tree king who wanted to escape!

Whoosh whoosh——

At this moment, the black iron tree king’s torso opened and closed like a mouth.

Roar–

And at this time, it let out a roar like an evolved beast.

Its roots grew longer in an instant, and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu’s face remained unchanged, and he slashed directly with the sword in his hand!

With the source strength covering the sword in his hand, this sword, which was already extremely sharp, became even sharper.

Bang bang bang——

With the swing of the sword, a large number of those vine-like tentacles were chopped off.

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s left hand directly punched the black iron tree king’s body.

As the fist hit his body, there was a dull sound.

Its huge body fell directly to the ground.

Good chance!

And at this moment, the fist of the left hand was immediately surrounded by blue flames.

At the next moment, Lin Xiu directly dropped the sword in his right hand, and with a sprint, his fist hit the core of its roots!

Boom——

With a loud sound, the mouth in the middle of its torso opened.

There was howling and screaming.

Its huge body completely lost its movement the next moment.

“Is it dead?”

Lin Xiu also heaved a sigh of relief at this time.

This black iron tree king is indeed a bit difficult to deal with.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu lifted a sword on the ground.

He stared at the black iron tree king’s body with hesitation in his eyes.

The odd crystals of evolved beasts are usually in the head.

But this plant god, will there be odd crystals?

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment, then used the sword to cut open its trunk.

Its trunk is too hard. At this time, Lin Xiu used a lot of strength to break it open.

Soon, some crystal clear liquid began to flow out.

What’s this!?

Looking at these crystal clear liquids, Lin Xiu’s eyes showed surprise.

Because Lin Xiu can now clearly feel that these crystal clear liquids exuding a faint white light seem to contain extremely strong power!

It’s a bit like the blood of the gods, and the blood marrow in the blood marrow pool.

Good stuff!

Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up right now, and he took out a large glass bottle directly from his expansion space, and began to collect these energy-filled liquids.

After about half an hour, the energy liquid in the body of the Black Iron Tree King was finally collected by Lin Xiu.

It filled several large bottles!

Fortunately, I had nothing to do and prepared these bottles.

Lin Xiu looked at these big bottles at this time, and couldn’t help talking to himself.

With Lin Xiu’s thought, these glass bottles filled with energy liquid instantly disappeared in place.

Seems like this plant god doesn’t have odd crystals, but has these energy liquids…

...

At this moment, Lin Xiu mumbled to himself. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

These energy liquids are much better than odd crystals!

It’s a pity that this kind of plant god seems to be very difficult to come across.

This is the first time Lin Xiu has met the black iron tree god.

After looking around and seeing nothing worth taking away, Lin Xiu left here directly.

He continued to run into the depths of the deep forest.

At this moment, the most important thing was to quickly find the Netherworld flame.

It would be best to absorb the power of the Netherworld flame.

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu’s eyes revealed a look of determination.

It has been less than half a month since he left, so he must improve during this period of time! _

As Lin Xiu continued to walk deeper into the forest, the surroundings became weirder and weirder.

...

There were a large number of vines constantly appearing on the ground.

Lin Xiu held the sword and subconsciously slashed at these vines a few times.

He found that these were indeed real vines, not the same as the previous Black Iron Tree King.

This made Lin Xiu feel a little pity.

It would be great if it was a real plant god.

Then he can obtain those energy liquids again.

He can’t remember how long he walked, but when he was in the front, Lin Xiu suddenly noticed clusters of faint blue light appearing.

Um!?

Seeing this blue light, Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly.

This thing, could it be… the Netherworld Flame!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly at this time, and in the next moment, he rushed directly to the front!

Soon, as Lin Xiu rushed to the front, he felt a bone-chilling chill all over his body.

cold!

Is this Netherworld Flame…

Lin Xiu looked at the flames floating in the air, emitting faint blue light, and there was a look of surprise in his eyes.

That’s right, this bone-chilling coldness and the feeling that seems to be able to intimidate one’s soul must be the Netherworld Flame from the Netherworld!

Lin Xiu took a deep breath at this time and kept the sword on the ground beside him.

Stretching out his right hand, he slowly touched the Netherworld Flame.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s arms were trembling slightly.

Because he can feel that this Netherworld Flame is very terrifying.

It’s even scarier than the hellfire!

Boom——

At this time, as Lin Xiu stretched out his hand, his right hand was covered by the dark blue hellfire.

But when his hand was about to touch the Netherworld Flame, he could clearly feel it. The hellfire began to be assimilated by those Netherworld Flames and slowly disappeared.

Moreover, there was a terrifying cold feeling coming from his fingertips. Even Lin Xiu, who had a heart of frost and strong fire resistance, still couldn’t resist the terrifying cold feeling at this time!
