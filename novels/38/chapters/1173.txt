1174 Fight Back

Zhao Laosan had already rushed over from the other side at this time.

The swords in both hands slashed directly at Lin Xiu!

Because he was just sent flying out, at this time, Zhao Laosan’s eyes were full of murderous intent.

swoosh—

The moment he slashed over with this knife, he could clearly see a substantial, huge slashing energy, slashing toward Lin Xiu’s body!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he used his body skill directly and dodged in an instant.

Boom—

That terrifying blade aura instantly hit the ground on the other side, cutting out a huge ravine directly.

At this time, Lin Xiu, who appeared on the other side, turned around and jumped directly to a divine mark floating in the air.

As Lin Xiu’s body jumped onto the divine mark, the divine mark instantly seemed to be attached to Lin Xiu’s body.

“Go to hell!”

At this time, Zhao Laosan continued to attack, but was easily dodged by Lin Xiu.

On this kid’s body…!?

At this time, Zhao Laosan also clearly saw that on Lin Xiu’s body, there was the cyan divine mark attached to his body.

Because of the special power of this divine mark, it seems to have given Lin Xiu a faster speed.

Lin Xiu waved his right hand and the Dark Edge spear appeared in his hand again from the expansion space.

Some of these divine marks suspended in this space were dangerous, but many have assisting effects. Once you touch these divine marks, you can make these divine marks increase your power.

The divine mark that Lin Xiu touched just now was the divine mark of the wind, which can increase one’s speed.

“It’s my turn.”

Lin Xiu sneered at this time, instead of dodging the attack of Zhao Laosan, he held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and attacked Zhao Laosan frantically!

Dangdang-

Zhao Laosan, who was going to attack Lin Xiu, could only turn his offense into defense at this time.

The spear stabbed out at great speed.

He stabbed on Laosan Zhao’s sword and made a loud noise.

At this time, Zhao Laosan could only resist constantly, but he didn’t have any chance to fight back.

how can that be!

How could this kid have such power!?

At this time, Zhao Laosan’s heart was full of shock.

Zhao Laosan always thought that although Lin Xiu was a Divine Marker, he was an ordinary warrior.

If he wanted to kill Lin Xiu, it’s very simple.

Because the power of the Divine mark was strange and terrifying to ordinary warriors, but in actual combat, it will not give the Divine marker any chance to use it.

But at this time, the actual combat ability that Lin Xiu showed was really too strong.

“kill him!!!”

And at this moment, Ye Yu also got up from the other side and shouted out with a ghastly expression.

He never thought that Lin Xiu would dare to plot against them!

At a critical moment, the divine mark giant punched him, causing a lot of damage to his body.

Those warriors from Luanxuan Palace had already reacted quickly and attacked Lin Xiu!

Although they and Zhao Laosan harbored an ulterior motive and wanted to snatch the secret scroll, but since they had to kill Lin Xiu first, they could only unite.

Ye Yu, who had a ferocious face, looked at the scroll of Bai Lingxian on the other side.

He found that the divine mark giant was still there. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Now, it was impossible to snatch the scroll of divine marks.

The power of the divine mark giant was too strong and they dare not pass over easily.

At this time, the surrounding warriors had already started to disperse.

The battle between these God warrior-level warriors is too terrifying and they didn’t want to be implicated here.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly as he watched those warriors from Luanxuan Palace rush over.

Originally, he was holding a long spear and pressing against Zhao Laosan, but at this time, Lin Xiu directly withdrew the long spear in his hand.

He turned around and jumped directly to the other side.

The body jumped directly to the pale golden divine mark suspended in the air.

At this moment, the pale golden divine mark was instantly attached to Lin Xiu’s body.

Lin Xiu also felt a powerful force surging up from his body.

This was the Divine Rune of Power.

“Die!”

And at this moment, the God warriors of Luanxuan Palace had already rushed to Lin Xiu’s side.

Attacked Lin Xiu wildly!

Lin Xiu didn’t have the slightest fear in his eyes and the Dark Edge spear in his hand waved wildly.

With the blessing of the Wind Divine Mark and the Power Divine Mark, Lin Xiu, who was originally very powerful, was even stronger at this time.

With a thought, the ‘Purification Domain’ and ‘Heavenly Array’ unfolded at the same time.

Now Lin Xiu didn’t want to use the ‘Fury’ skill.

Because outside, he didn’t know what’s going on.

These days, although Lin Xiu was immersed in cracking the divine mark giant, he clearly felt that there were still warriors entering.

In anticipation of the situation that may happen after he obtained this secret scroll, he will not use ‘Fury’ for as long as possible.

“Get lost!”

At this time, looking at the God warriors in Luanxuan Palace who surrounded him, Lin Xiu roared and swept the spear!

‘Clean sweep’!

With an incomparably powerful force bursting out, at this moment, all the warriors who surrounded Lin Xiu were shocked and flew out by that powerful force.

All of them fell to the ground like kites with broken strings, making a loud noise.

“The cyan divine mark, as well as the pale golden divine mark, both have amplifying effects!”

Zhao Laosan, who is experienced and experienced, quickly reacted at this time.

Following Lin Xiu, he leaped into the cyan divine marks and the pale golden divine marks.

Soon, those divine marks were attached to his body.

At this moment, Zhao Laosan could clearly feel his own strength and speed increasing!

“I see.”

Ye Yu also laughed wickedly at this time.

Also following Zhao Laosan’s movements, his body leaped into those divine marks.

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he immediately raised his brows.

This was what he expected.

These divine marks floating in the air were not under the control of Lin Xiu.

Now they were getting the same boost.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath. The source strength of his body was not hidden at this time and it completely burst forth.

With the body’s source strength fully functioning, Lin Xiu’s body also radiated golden light.

“This kid…has hidden so much power…”

Zhao Laosan and Ye Yu’s faces have become extremely ugly.

They had no idea that Lin Xiu had been hiding his strength.

“Zhao Laosan, we must kill him.”

Ye Yu clenched the golden long sword in his hand and said through gritted teeth.
