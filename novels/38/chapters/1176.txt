1177 Kill All of Them

Boom –

The divine mark giant punched Ye Yu’s body.

Although Ye Yu unfolded a ‘Sphere’ to resist at this time, the power of this punch was too terrifying.

He directly shattered his ‘Sphere’!

“NO!!!”

After his ‘Sphere’ was smashed to pieces by the fist of the divine mark giant, Ye Yu spat out a mouthful of blood and roared loudly.

Because the fist of the divine mark giant immediately hit his body again!

Holding the golden long sword in his hand, he was about to resist.

boom–

But the power of the Divine mark giant was really terrifying. Even if he wanted to resist with his long sword, at this moment, his long sword was directly knocked into the air by this punch.

The giant fist of the divine mark giant slammed into his body.

smashed him directly to the ground.

With Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the divine mark giant continued to pursue the victory, frantically waving the divine mark fist in his hand and smashing it on his body.

bang bang bang-

At this moment, the entire ground made a loud noise.

Ye Yu’s body, under the crazy attack of this divine mark giant, had already been hammered into a mass of meat sauce.

And in Lin Xiu’s mind, there were also system prompts of experience gained.

“They’re all dead…”

Lin Xiu looked around, and said aloud to himself.

The effect of ‘Fury’ also disappeared at this time, and the after-effects hit, causing Lin Xiu to feel completely weak.

Fortunately, there were no warriors here anymore, so Lin Xiu sat cross-legged on the ground, absorbing the surrounding energy.

Waiting for the sequelae of ‘fury’ to disappear.

Looking at his attribute panel, Lin Xiu found that his experience progress had risen to about 12%.

After killing so many god warriors, he gained just this bit of experience.

After reaching the god warrior level, it seemed to be more difficult to level up.

boom boom boom —

After a while, as the after-effects of ‘fury’ disappeared, the surrounding ground began to vibrate wildly.

what’s happening!?

Lin Xiu, who felt the shock, immediately frowned.

He glanced around, and found that the divine marks around him had begun to slowly disappear at a speed visible to the naked eye.

The same is true for the divine mark giant that he controls.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s expression changed slightly.

The power of this god-printed giant is so powerful that it just disappeared?

Looking at such a scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but found it a pity.

But the space here was about to collapse, so he had to quickly leave.

Without thinking much, Lin Xiu just ra.

The vibrations in the surroundings became more frequent, and Lin Xiu quickly left the ruins here, and flew straight into the sky!

Boom—

The whole area made a loud noise again.

Taking a closer look, you can clearly see that the bottomless abyss below was immediately buried by a large amount of soil.

The entire underground abyss seemed to be filled up again in an instant.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes showed surprise.

At this time, Lin Xiu flew down from the sky and stood on the ground.

“I didn’t expect…that it could be like this.”

Lin Xiu said to himself.

“You got the scroll!?”

At the same time, there were a large number of warriors in the air, surrounding Lin Xiu.

Just now, they also felt the strong vibration from their surroundings.

They didn’t expect the ruins to be buried automatically.

As for Lin Xiu, he was the last warrior who appeared before the relic was buried. It was very possible that he got the inheritance inside.

Lin Xiu glanced at them with a faint killing intent in his eyes.

“The ruins have disappeared, you can leave Lingxian City.”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

“Leave, joke, is that up to you to decide? Who do you think you are!”

One of the men sneered.

“The city lord of Lingxian City.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly and said lightly.

The city lord of Lingxian City!?

When these warriors suspended in the air heard Lin Xiu’s words at this time, they couldn’t help but be slightly startled. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“The city lord of Lingxian City? I think you are a fraud!”

The man just now had a killing intent in his eyes, and said coldly.

“I’ll help Lingxian city get rid of you impostor now!”

As soon as he finished speaking, he was about to rush down towards Lin Xiu. The sword in his hand had already burst into a dazzling white light due to the transmission of the source strength.

A sneer appeared on the corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth. With a thought, the Dark Edge spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

Before the man could attack Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu charged with a spear!

‘Profound Intent·Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

As the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand stabbed out, it instantly turned into thousands of spear shadows.

Before the man who rushed over had time to react, countless holes were stabbed out of his body, and he died in an instant!

“Again, the ruins are gone, and those who are still thinking of fooling around here in Lingxian City, leave now.”

Lin Xiu raised his eyes and looked at the warriors in the air, and said lightly.

The warrior looked at the scene in front of him, and his face became extremely ugly.

As soon as Lin Xiu made his move, he killed a powerful warrior in an instant.

Let them not have time to react.

If they were the ones who attacked Lin Xiu just now…

Thinking of this, most warriors shuddered.

However, there are also some warriors who were still unwilling.

They finally came here, but they didn’t gain anything, now they have to leave?

“Let’s attack together! This kid must have obtained Bai Lingxian’s inheritance and secret treasure!”

Some men shouted loudly at this time.

Those warriors who were originally afraid did not leave at this time, and all looked at Lin Xiu.

After all, the temptation of the inheritance is too great, these people don’t want to let it go easily.

These warriors looked at each other, and in the next moment, they all rushed down from the sky!

With so many warriors fighting together, they no longer have any fear.

“City Lord, be careful!”

Standing on the other side of the City Lord’s Mansion, Mr. Pang looked at this scene and couldn’t help shouting loudly.

“Experience points are here.”

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he sneered and said to himself.

At this time, with a large amount of source strength converging on the Dark Edge spear, the entire body of the Dark Edge spear became as transparent as glass.

“Get… lost!”

At the moment when they surrounded him, Lin Xiu directly swung his long spear.

boom boom boom —

One after another, dark blue flaming birds burst out with the dancing of the spear in an instant!
