Chapter 907: Underground Fighting Arena

“This is our seat.”

One of the warriors looked at Lin Xiu who was sitting there and said lightly.

His words were full of arrogance.

Lin Xiu continued drinking his tea without the intention to move like he hadn’t heard his words.

When the warrior saw this scene, his brows could not help wrinkling.

He directly reached out and smacked Lin Xiu’s head.

Pa–

But it was different from what he imagined. Lin Xiu grabbed his hand as soon as he stretched it out.

“En? Is there a problem?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly and spoke to him in a light voice.

...

“you...”

Just as the warrior was about to say something, he felt a sharp pain on his wrist.

The whole body trembled slightly and a coldness hit.

“Bro, isn’t it a little too much?”

The few warriors behind him stared at Lin Xiu and said coldly..

“When he attacked me just now, why didn’t you guys say that it was too much huh?”

As Lin Xiu spoke, he grabbed the man’s wrist and exerted a little force.

“what!!!”

The severe pain that came made the man cry out.

“Courting death!”

Seeing this scene, one of the men seemed to be unable to bear it any longer. He roared angrily, held a sword in his hand and attacked Lin Xiu directly.

Dang–

Lin Xiu’s expression didn’t change, the other hand collided directly with the man’s sword.

Suddenly there was a crisp sound.

Lin Xiu actually sent that sword flying with just his bare hand!

The sword that flew out was directly inserted into the wall behind.

The warriors were all startled at this moment.

The expressions of the others also changed greatly.

At the same time, holding their weapons, they attacked Lin Xiu.

boom–

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, raised his foot and kicked the man who smacked his head.

And while he sent the man flying, Lin Xiu continued to attack from the front.

Just when they were about to attack Lin Xiu, they saw Lin Xiu wave his hand so fast that he couldn’t even see a shadow.

Their bodies immediately flew out and fell heavily on the ground.

“what...”

The warriors who fell on the ground trembled and twitched slightly and there was a whimper in their mouths.

“Bill please.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Yes... Yes.”

Everything happened in a flash.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words at this time, the waiter came back to his senses.

Lin Xiu didn’t even look at them, then walked out of the store.

At this time, in a corner of the store, a warrior stared at Lin Xiu’s back as he left.

After coming out from the store, Lin Xiu continued to walk slowly down the street.

There were so many people on the street, it looked very crowded.

After walking through the street in front, Lin Xiu took a detour and walked into one of the alleys.

“It’s been so long, it’s time to come out?”

As soon as Lin Xiu walked into this alley, he stopped and said indifferently.

“Huh? You found out...”

As Lin Xiu finished speaking, a short-looking warrior with glasses walked out from the front.

He slowly walked towards Lin Xiu.

“Don’t worry, I have no ill intentions.”

The short warrior spread his hands and said.

Although he is about 1.8 meters tall, to the people of the planet Namir, he is a dwarf.

“I just saw your fight in that restaurant. I admire you very much.”

The short warrior pushed the glasses he was wearing, then said with a smile.

“And?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

He looked surprised on the surface but was calm inside.

“Are you interested in attending an underground party?”

He walked up to Lin Xiu and handed Lin Xiu a card.

The card looks dark and reflective, with a skull in the middle, which looks kind of weird.

After receiving this card, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Come to the above location, I think you will be interested.”

The short man smiled, watched Lin Xiu take the card and left.

“Looks like I can get some more information.”

Holding the card, Lin Xiu smirked.

Wildfire City – an underground fighting arena.

In an underground fighting arena in Wildfire City, there will be warriors fighting in it every night.

And fighting in a match was a matter of life and death.

Today, there seems to be some kind of competition being held here, with a large number of warriors guarding the entrance.

Ordinary warriors are not allowed to enter casually.

“Huh? You have a black card?”

Looking at the black card that Lin Xiu handed to him, the guard seemed a little surprised.

“go in.”

After checking the card, the guard returned the card to Lin Xiu, then let Lin Xiu in.

The passage inside is a bit dark, like an underground passage.

After walking slowly for a while, everything he saw started to become brighter.

And everything became brighter after he walked out of the passage.

Inside, there is a huge fighting arena!

Around the arena, there are already quite a few warriors sitting around.

As Lin Xiu walked in, many warriors looked at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu walked forward as if nothing had happened.

In the four corners of the fighting arena, there are four warriors sitting there.

There are three males and one female.

These three warriors look different from ordinary warriors and they all seem to be very strong in terms of aura and strength.

In the middle of the fighting arena, there are four corpses lying in it.

Blood stained the entire fighting arena and it looked a little bloody.

“you come up!”

At the same time, the warrior sitting in one of the corners pointed to a warrior below and said aloud.

The other three warriors located in other directions also began to look for warriors, then let them enter the arena.

“Hey, little brother, is this your first time?”

While Lin Xiu was still looking at the scene, a middle-aged warrior came over, stood beside Lin Xiu and said to himself.

“The four people there are selecting warriors for a life-or-death match. If you are lucky enough to be selected and those four likes you, it is possible for you to follow them to the Secret Realm.”

“What is the Secret Realm?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows, then said lightly.

“What? You came in here and didn’t know about it?”

The middle-aged man seemed a little surprised.

“Haha, but you don’t need to know. Those four probably wouldn’t pick you anyway.”
