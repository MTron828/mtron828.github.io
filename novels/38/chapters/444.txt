Chapter 445: Who Is That Person?

The other people spoke up when they heard Dean Baili’s promise.

In their opinion, Dean Baili was really too tolerant of Lin Xiu.

After all, Lin Xiu went to the power supply center to destroy the power supply. If it was looked into, it would be enough for Lin Xiu to be severely punished.

“Tell me exactly what to do.” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said to Dean Baili.

He was also a little surprised, he didn’t expect that Dean Baili would be so direct and actually agreed.

You know, there were a lot of treasures in the Sacred Region Academy, and he actually promised to give him whatever he wanted.

“The weather on Saturday is just right for you to go down.”

“When the time comes, I will tell you the specifics.”

Dean Baili touched his beard and said.

“Dean, are you really going to let this kid go down?” At this time, these people began to whisper to Dean Baili.

Lin Xiu’s ears were very sensitive. Seeing their expressions and tone about this matter, he became curious.

Why do these guys take this matter so seriously?

Is there something under this island?

With this thought, Lin Xiu become even more curious.

“Okay, you all go back first, I have something to discuss with him.” After listening to these people’s comments, Dean Baili rubbed his beard, and then said aloud with a smile.

“Okay, Dean, then we will go back first.” Those people wanted to continue to say something, but when they heard Dean Baili’s words, they couldn’t say much. They nodded and went to the door.

And the middle-aged man just now gave Lin Xiu a stern look before he left.

Bang–

As those people left, the gate closed.

Lin Xiu looked at Dean Baili, who was sitting on the chair, but at the next moment, he actually appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

And Lin Xiu clearly saw a cold light flashing in front of his eyes.

Boom–

In the next moment, Lin Xiu’s entire body was cut in half by Dean Baili’s knife.

“Not bad.” Dean Baili turned behind and said with a smile.

“You want to kill me!?” Lin Xiu’s figure appeared at the back and exclaimed towards Dean Baili, a little breathless.

The strength of this old guy was really terrifying. If Lin Xiu hadn’t reacted fast enough and used ‘Mirror Image’, he would have been killed.

He didn’t use any weapons at all, but the fingers of his right hand were put together and they instantly turned into a sharp blade.

This powerful strength sent a chill down Lin Xiu’s back.

“If I want to kill you, do you think you could still stand here?” Dean Baili looked at Lin Xiu and then said with a smile.

“What on earth do you want?” Lin Xiu became more cautious, and he said aloud to him.

The old man in front of him was definitely an old monster. He didn’t know how strong he was but with Lin Xiu’s current strength, even with the system, he wouldn’t be able to deal with him.

The chance of winning was almost…zero.

“Don’t be so nervous, it was just a small game, sit down first.” Dean Baili smiled and said.

Lin Xiu was still looking at him with a wary expression, but he thought about it and realized that his strength was probably nothing to him. So he was relieved and simply sat down on the sofa. Then, he drank the brewed tea prepared on the side.

Seeing Lin Xiu suddenly become so careless and unafraid, Dean Baili was startled and laughed, “You kid.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Do you know, I heard of you before you arrived at the Sacred Region Academy and someone mentioned you to me a few days ago.” Dean Baili sat opposite Lin Xiu, then smiled widely.

“You heard of me?” Lin Xiu couldn’t help being stunned when he heard Dean Baili’s words, and then subconsciously said aloud.

“A few days ago, when chatting with Weird Old Xia, he suddenly mentioned you, saying that you are a good seedling with good strength.” Dean Baili did not directly answer Lin Xiu but mumbled to himself.

“Weird Old Xia?” Lin Xiu frowned, searching for the memory of this ‘Weird Old Xia’ in his mind, but he didn’t seem to know the so-called ‘Weird Old Xia’ at all.

“Xia Xing!?” But in the next moment, Lin Xiu seemed to think of something, and then subconsciously said aloud.

“Yes, it’s him.”

“That old guy told you about me?” Lin Xiu quickly remembered what happened when he was in the Sacred Region Academy branch. The strength of the old man was also very strong, probably comparable to Dean Baili.

“He said that you are a very interesting person.” Dean Baili touched his beard, then smiled and said.

“Earlier, there was another person who asked me to take care of you. Otherwise, do you think that the matter of you destroying the main power supply could be cleared up so easily?” Dean Baili looked at Lin Xiu.

“Ahem.” Hearing the words of Dean Baili, Lin Xiu cleared his throat embarrassingly.

“But who is the person you are talking about?”

Lin Xiu was a little curious – there was actually someone he knew who knows Dean Baili?

He even asked Dean Baili to take care of him. In Lin Xiu’s memory, there didn’t seem to be a person with that great ability.

“You really don’t know?” Dean Baili looked at Lin Xiu and then said meaningfully.

“I don’t know.” Lin Xiu shook his head.

Could it be his former mentor at Xing Yao Academy? But it can’t be…

“You’ll find out in the future.” Dean Baili didn’t say much at this time. He smiled, stood up, looked through the French window at the gate of the Sacred Region Academy, then said, “This time you beat the Class 1 of the North Campus and you already have 10 points. What reward do you want?”

“Isn’t this reward for everyone in our class?” Hearing his words, Lin Xiu asked.

“You still care about your classmates? Not bad.” Dean Baili turned and looked at Lin Xiu, then nodded in satisfaction.

“There will be rewards for the class and a personal reward.”

Personal reward?

Lin Xiu was startled. Just when he was about to say something, he saw Dean Baili walking over.

At this time, his hand slapped on the table next to him and there was a ‘click’.
