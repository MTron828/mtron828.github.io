Chapter 936: Horrifying Devouring Rat

??

Boom!

That red lotus fire flew directly over.

It was swallowed directly by the Akash sandworm.

Just as it swallowed, a loud sound rang out.

The body of the Akash sandworm swelled directly.

In the next moment, the entire swollen body burst.

A large number of flames appeared next to its corpse.

And Lin Xiu, grabbing the middle-aged man’s body, jumped over to Wu Jie and the others!

“Run quickly!”

At this time, Lin Xiu said to Wu Jie and the others who were stunned by the scene just now.

“Run!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Wu Jie also reacted at this time.

He didn’t care so much and shouted directly.

As his words just fell, the rest of the warriors hurried forward.

The middle-aged man looked at the back at this time, his head was covered in cold sweat and he hurried to the front.

Although he was shocked by Lin Xiu’s performance just now, it was too late to think about it now.

Under the rush of the crowd, soon, those strange sounds were no longer heard.

The surrounding ground did not surge like a sea of ??sand again.

“Phew, I didn’t expect that Akash sandworms would appear. It’s really unfortunate.”

Wu Jie and the others also stopped at this time, sitting on the ground, panting.

Looking at Lin Xiu, Wu Jie was very surprised.

Because the strength that Lin Xiu showed just now is indeed strong.

No, it should be said that it was very strong.

Because he felt that by himself, there was no way he could go over and save the middle-aged man.

“Uncle Fu, are you alright?”

Wu Jie looked at the middle-aged man with a pale face and said.

“I’m fine.”

The middle-aged man Wu Jie called Uncle Fu shook his head and said.

“Brother Lin, I really wanted to thank you just now.”

Uncle Fu looked at Lin Xiu at this time and said aloud.

Just now, he really thought he was going to fall into the sand and die, or be swallowed by the Akash sandworm.

“It’s fine.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

“By the way, Brother Lin, how did you do it just now?”

Wu Jie hesitated for a while, but still said aloud.

After all, Lin Xiu stepped in those sand seas just now, but he didn’t get caught in it. It was very strange.

The rest of the warriors also looked towards Lin Xiu and their eyes were also full of curiosity.

After all, Lin Xu has done what none of them can do.

“Well, this is a kind of secret technique handed down from the family. You can step on the surging sand without sinking.”

Lin Xiu casually made up an excuse and said.

“I see.”

Wu Jie nodded and it could be seen that Lin Xiu didn’t seem to want to say more and he wouldn’t ask any further questions.

“It’s a pity we lost Xiong Jie.”

Wu Jie seemed to think of the warrior who just died and couldn’t help sighing.

The expressions of the other warriors also became a little gloomy at this time.

After all, these warriors were teammates who interacted with each other day and night so it was inevitable that they would be upset when they lose a teammate.

“The black wind camels just now ran away when they encountered these Akash sandworms.”

A warrior said at this time.

Although the Akash sandworm was not high in rank, it can cause the surrounding desert to sink, which is a very terrifying thing.

Even if the black wind camel is an evolved beast of the Beast king level, if it encounters such a situation, it will all sink and die, or be swallowed by the Akash sandworms.

“It’s very possible.” Wu Jie also nodded.

“No, it should be something else.”

Just when the other warriors were relieved, because the disaster was over, Lin Xiu suddenly said.

“What is it?” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Uncle Fu was stunned, then said subconsciously.

Wu Jie and the others also looked toward Lin Xiu.

Because of what happened just now, they looked at Lin Xiu differently now.

In their eyes, Lin Xiu also became quite mysterious.

“Have you guys seen the front?”

Front?

These people were stunned for a moment, then subconsciously looked in front of them.

“It seems that there is nothing...”

Wu Jie said subconsciously.

But after a closer look, the expression in his eyes changed slightly after seeing a white skeleton in the distance in front of him.

His face also became extremely ugly.

“Wu Jie, what’s wrong?”

A warrior said curiously.

“Look over there.”

Wu Jie pointed his finger to the front, his body trembled slightly.

The rest of the people also followed Wu Jie’s gaze curiously to the front.

Taking a closer look, there are two or three golden mice on the white skeleton.

The mouse’s body was not very big, but its eyes were red and it looked very strange.

“It’s not just a few mice...”

Seeing this scene, Uncle Fu said subconsciously.

But when he just said the words, he seemed to think of something, his eyes widened and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

“Devouring rats!?”

As soon as he spoke, the faces of the surrounding warriors turned white.

Devouring rats was only a rank 10 evolved beast.

Just looking at the rank, they were not very strong and seemed to be very easy to deal with for a warrior of the King warrior level.

But the horror of this devouring rat was that there were so many of them.

To the point that it sent the, goosebumps.

Moreover, the teeth of these devouring rats were so sharp that they could easily bite off even hard metal.

Even those very powerful evolved beasts will be gnawed into bones by them.

After all, there were so many of them that they were not afraid of death at all and their teeth were too sharp!

There was nothing they can’t chew!

“Devouring rats usually appear in groups, then...”

Wu Jie mumbled to himself.

Taking a closer look, in the next moment, you can clearly see that behind that white skeleton, there were tens of thousands of devouring rats rushing up!

The number of these devouring rats was simply too many.

If the black wind camel they encountered before was a sea of darkness, then the current swallowing rat was simply covering the sky and earth!

Terrible, it’s really too terrifying.

“We’re dead!”

When the other warriors saw this scene, their legs softened and they knelt down directly on the ground.

In this black wind desert, because of special power control, the body cannot float in the air.

Now, as soon as these devouring rats rush over, they will directly bite them into a skeleton!

“Isn’t it enough to unfold the ‘Sphere’?”

Lin Xiu said aloud at this time.

He also felt that something was wrong just now, but he didn’t expect that there would be such a large group of mice.

“No, these devouring rats can even swallow a ‘Sphere’!”
