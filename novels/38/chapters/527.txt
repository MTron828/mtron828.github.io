Chapter 528: The Royal Beast Sect

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

And the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was about to stab the man’s neck!

If nothing else happens, the spear would pierce his throat and kill him directly!

“‘Sphere’!”

The man roared, and a light blue light suddenly appeared on his body, a circular barrier that instantly surrounded his body.

But even so, the impact of Lin Xiu’s stabbing caused him to fly straight out of the “Sphere”.

Boom—

His entire body hit the cliff behind him directly, making a loud noise.

“Isn’t it a bit too much?” Bai Fei and the others glared at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“Too much? This belongs to me yet you guys said it’s yours. How funny.” Lin Xiu said with a smile at this time.

Bai Fei frowned, and then smiled coldly, “There are some things that might burn your hands when you get them.”

“That’s none of your business.” Lin Xiu replied.

“Brother Lin, they belong to the Royal Beast Sect.” Although Jiang Tao was also very angry just now, but in this situation, he still stood beside Lin Xiu and reminded in a low voice.

Like the Warrior Alliance, the Royal Beast Sect was a global force but the Royal Beast Sect’s power was obviously relatively smaller.

But even so, it should not be underestimated.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s arrogant words, Bai Fei’s eyes were already full of killing intent, but the strength Lin Xiu just displayed made him a little startled.

After all, Lin Xiu’s shot sent a rank 6 warrior flying. This kind of strength was obviously beyond the power of a rank 6.

“Looks like you have a death wish!”

Swoosh—

Just when the killing intent flickered in Bai Fei’s eyes, he saw a cold light stabbing towards him.

Not good!

Looking at this cold light, the pupils in Bai Fei’s eyes shrank a little, and his body quickly retreated back.

“Be careful!” The warriors behind quickly rushed up to resist the attack.

Bai Fei stepped back and touched his neck, there was still blood dripping down.

Only his skin was cut.

But thinking of the situation just now, he still has some lingering fears – he nearly died!

Looking up, he saw a beautiful girl holding a long sword and attacking the warriors who were guarding him.

It was her just now!?

Bai Fei’s eyes widened slightly. To be honest, it was the first time he had ever seen such a beautiful woman, but it was such a beautiful woman that almost killed him just now.

Unforgivable!!!

“Catch her alive for me!” Bai Fei roared.

At this time, the men who were fighting with Luo Yue did not hide their strength. While ‘Sphere’ was released to protect his body, he held the weapon in his hand and frantically attacked Luo Yue.

Although Luo Yue was a rank 7 warrior, she was besieged by so many warriors and was not able to kill them directly in a moment.

Jiang Tao and others were also surprised. Just now, the stunning woman who had been standing beside Lin Xiu in silence actually started making a move without a word.

The people of this Royal Beast Sect were above rank 6 and they could be regarded as a very strong team. At this time, seeing a few warriors behind them about to attack Luo Yue, Lin Xiu did not hesitate at all and rushed over directly!

Holding a spear, he stabbed and it seems to turn into dozens of spears!

Whoosh whoosh—

The long spear that was pierced out suddenly made a sound of breaking through the air.

When the few warriors in front looked at Lin Xiu who was attacking, they were shocked.

There are relatively few people who use spears as weapons and they rarely encountered any. At this time, the spear used by Lin Xiu seemed to be able to swing freely and his attacks were very fast.

Dang dang-

The spear seemed to be like a phantom, these people did not dare to continue to charge forward, and could only block with the sword in their hands.

But the force of Lin Xiu’s spear stab was really terrifying, and these people all felt that their hands were going numb.

Boom boom boom —

Lin Xiu waved his spear and brought up flames, and from the flames, terrifying flaming birds burst forth one after another, and they charged directly at their bodies!

Those flaming birds hit the ‘Sphere’ of those warriors. Although they couldn’t break through their ‘Sphere’ directly, they still made them feel a burning sensation.

“Damn!!!”

When did these people from the Royal Beast Sect suffer this kind of grievance? They were warriors above rank 6 yet they couldn’t even defeat a guy in this Thunder Valley!?

At this time, these warriors directly faced Lin Xiu’s flaming birds and attacked!

As long as they had a ‘Sphere’, it was impossible for them to be directly impacted by Lin Xiu’s flaming bird!

Lin Xiu watched as these people attacked again. At this time, his eyes narrowed, and the pattern on the Dark Edge Spear he held in his hand began to light up.

At this time, Lin Xiu also felt that these patterns were breathing lights on and off.

And as these patterns glowed, Lin Xiu felt that the spear seemed to vibrate slightly like a heart.

What is going on!?

Lin Xiu was surprised. The patterns on the Dark Edge spear were forged by Luo Yue by dissolving and forging the mysterious spar.

In the previous battle, Lin Xiu found that these patterns would light up as his source strength burst out, and the power of the spear also became stronger, but it was not as obvious as this time.

Seeing these people charging at this time, Lin Xiu didn’t think about it anymore.

Crackling-

Moreover, when Lin Xiu slashed across, lightning burst out from the spear.

“You’re dead! You think you can break our ‘Sphere’!” a warrior shouted loudly.

As long as there was a ‘Sphere’, Lin Xiu couldn’t hurt their lives at all.

Under their siege, Lin Xiu would definitely use up his strength before them, so Lin Xiu would definitely die! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Boom–

But when Lin Xiu slashed diagonally with the spear in both hands and collided with his saber, there was a dull sound. The lightning on Lin Xiu’s spear passed through the ‘Sphere’ to the sword and on to his body!

Damn…

The man was struck by the high-voltage lightning, his body went numb and he was in great pain!

“Go to hell!” Lin Xiu shouted angrily, and the spear stabbed straight at the guy!

“It’s useless!” The man roared loudly. In his opinion, he had the ‘Sphere’ unfolded and at most he would only be sent flying by the huge impact of Lin Xiu’s attack..
