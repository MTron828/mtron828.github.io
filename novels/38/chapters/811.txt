Chapter 812: The News About Luo Yue

“You are my subordinates, my lackeys, not his!”

Zhao Nian looked at the eyes of his subordinates and roared.

“I have had enough of you!”

A warrior seemed to dislike Zhao Nian from the beginning. At this time, he directly held his own weapon and turned to attack Zhao Nian!

After all, Lin Xiu’s strength is too terrifying, a flaming bird can easily kill them.

Even the ‘Sphere’ can be easily broken and it is only a matter of time before he and others will be killed.

With him taking the lead, the rest immediately turned to attack Zhao Nian.

Looking at this scene, the corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth could not help but twitch.

From just observing the faces of these people, Lin Xiu knew that these people were not loyal to Zhao Nian.

Moreover, Zhao Nian’s strength is not that strong enough to completely suppress them and many people were probably already upset with him.

Instead of directly killing these warriors, Lin Xiu also had his own plans.

“You dogs!!!”

Zhao Nian roared angrily, then seemed to fight these people.

Although he was the peak master warrior, he has not yet reached the level of a King warrior.

And these people are also master warrior-level warriors and their strength is not very weak.

boom boom boom —

Loud noises continued to be heard and it didn’t take long for Zhao Nian to die on the ground under the siege of these warriors.

And the rest of the warriors were also panting at this time.

Taking a closer look, they also had a lot of injuries.

After all, Zhao Nian is also a powerful warrior.

At this time, their eyes all turned to Lin Xiu’s side and there was a little panic in their eyes.

The power displayed by this young man is really too powerful.

“Who hit my friend just now?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, glanced at these people and said lightly.

Feeling Lin Xiu’s gaze, their bodies could not help but tremble.

Lin Xiu’s eyes were really terrifying.

It was a look from someone who has experienced death and crawled back from hell. “It’s Zhao Nian...and the two of them...”

A warrior trembled at this moment, pointed at Zhao Nian and the corpses of two or two men said aloud.

“Who else.”

Lin Xiu said lightly, staring at them, putting a lot of pressure on them.

The expressions of these people changed a bit and finally one person couldn’t bear the pressure and fell to his knees directly on the ground, begging for mercy, “I’m sorry, I didn’t know he was your friend...”

Boom— DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

As soon as he finished speaking, he saw a group of flaming birds charging towards him!

The surrounding warriors were startled and subconsciously dodged.

The flame rushed over and without any defense, at this moment, he instantly turned into a skeleton.

“The hellfire...”

A warrior seemed to feel something. Originally, because of the appearance of the flaming bird, the surrounding environment was extremely hot.

But at this moment, cold sweat broke out on his forehead.

Because yesterday, he just saw the news about the disappearance of the flames in the Divine Fire Cave.

You must know that the hellfire in the Divine Fire Cave is known as the most terrifying flame in Marqi and the flame has existed for many years and is endless, but now there was news about it.

People still found this news unbelievable.

He has been to the Divine Fire Cave and he has seen this kind of flame, which is exactly the same as the one released by Lin Xiu.

Moreover, the hellfire at this time seemed to be even more terrifying than what he saw at that time.

“Who else?”

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand, then pointed at the people around him and said aloud.

“It’s not us, we really didn’t!”

When these people looked at the long spear that Lin Xiu pointed at, they shuddered and said quickly.

They looked at Lin Xiu as if they were waiting for judgment.

“All right.”

Lin Xiu said lightly and put down the spear.

Seeing this scene, these people immediately heaved a sigh of relief.

Just now, they really felt like they had one foot in hell.

“Tell me what happened.”

Lin Xiu continued to speak.

Without any hesitation, these warriors told Lin Xiu what happened before.

It turned out that Liu Pan was introduced by someone and came to ask them for help to find out about Luo Yue.

But because Zhao Nian’s asking price was too high, Fatty left, but was stopped by Zhao Nian’s men.

And because of Fatty’s resistance, he got beaten by them.

After all, they were all master warriors and Fatty has no power to fight back.

Later, it was because they found Lin Xiu in Fatty’s phone address book, so they wanted to blackmail Lin Xiu.

Fengyun City is not a peaceful place in the first place. Although it is possible to make any transactions here and to inquire about news, there are also many risks.

Therefore, people with average strength would not dare to set foot here.

“In that case, you guys have intel right.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Yes, we are first-class intelligence experts.”

When these warriors heard Lin Xiu’s words, they hurriedly said.

As long as they had value, Lin Xiu would not kill them.

“Help me find someone.”

Lin Xiu was silent for a while, then said aloud.

The night passed quickly and on the second day, Liu Pan, who was lying on the bed, opened his eyes immediately.

The dazzling sunlight instantly shone into his eyes.

“Fatty, are you awake?”

At this moment, a familiar voice came over, causing Lin Xiu to widen his eyes.

“Brother Lin?”

Fatty abruptly sat up halfway. The injury from last night has now fully recovered.

Because after Qian Jin took Fatty away last night, he went to the hospital, where his injuries were treated.

“En, are you alright?”

Lin Xiu said to Liu Pan.

“It’s okay, those guys yesterday...”

Liu Pan shook his head, then seemed to have thought of something and said quickly.

“Don’t worry, I’ve taken revenge for you.”

Lin Xiu smiled and didn’t say much.

“You scared me to death yesterday.”

Qian Jin, who was standing on the other side, couldn’t help but complain at this time.

After all, the warriors who faced yesterday, just by looking at them, you can feel the terrifying aura brought by them.

He also didn’t know how Lin Xiu came out in the end.

“He...”

“His name is Qian Jin, he’s barely a friend.”

Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

“Barely?”

Qian Jin complained a little unhappily.

“I’m sorry, Brother Lin, yesterday I...”

Liu Pan thought that he was originally helping Lin Xiu yesterday, but in the end it was Lin Xiu who helped him and he couldn’t help but apologize.

“It’s okay, I already got the information I needed.”

Lin Xiu laughed.

“You’ve got news about sister-in-law?”

“En... that’s right.”
