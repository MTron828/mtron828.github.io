Chapter 233: Feeling Of Unease

Lin Xiu continued to swing Dark Edge and dance in the large hall.

Be it Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City or Overlord Spear Art.

Both were extremely tyrannical.

Spear arts and skills focused on offense and did not care much about defense.

It was said that the final defense is the offense, this phrase explained Overlord Spear Art the best.

The skill and spear art was too strong and Lin Xiu was able to sense the tyrannical qi while training it. This qi brought immense pain to his body.

Lin Xiu would occasionally have blood in his mouth as well.

If not for Lin Xiu’s second gene lock that strengthened his body, an ordinary body would never have been able to endure the skills.

Fortunately, the super vitality gift pack came in time.

The 20 pills proved extremely effective for the injuries in his body.

While practising, he would reach his limit and swallow another pill.

The internal injuries and pain in his body would quickly recover and subside.

The exhaustion and loss of strength from training in the skill and spear arts would recover as well.

At this time, Luo Yue was seated in her own room. She received an email and frowned.

Just like that, Lin Xiu repeated this repetition all the way to the morning.

“It’s morning…?” Lin Xiu rubbed his tired eyes and looked at the light that shot in through the window as he stretched.

‘That’s right, I trained in the skill and spear arts for the entire day and fell right asleep after that.’ The bottle of pills was right beside him with only 8 pills left.

Although it was a pity that he finished 12 in one day, the good news was that Lin Xiu had grasped Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City and Overlord Spear Art completely.

He was able to control the strength and power when using it and no longer suffer harm from the tyrannical power of the skill.

“Eh?” He looked at the table and noticed a set of breakfast on it.

It was still warm as though it was prepared not long ago.

Lin Xiu revealed a smile at the sight of this and felt warmth in his heart.

Luo Yue always made breakfast for him and according to her, it was always her over-preparing and having leftovers.

But Lin Xiu knew she was acting cold but filled with warmth inside.

Lin Xiu headed to class after breakfast.

“Class monitor! So early today?” Just as Lin Xiu opened the doors to the training room, Li Ping walked over and greeted him with a smile.

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

After returning from G17, Li Ping had grown a lot stronger.

As expected, dangerous places would temper an individual greater.

Be it willpower or strength, dangerous places were also good places to train.

But what Lin Xiu found strange was that Luo Yue did not come here. Where did she go?

“Morning Lin Xiu!” Zhang Yin walked over and waved at him.

“Lin Xiu?” Zhang Yin waved his hands right in front of Lin Xiu’s face when he noticed Lin Xiu in a daze.

“What’s up?” Lin Xiu regained himself and asked.

“You were stoning, did you overdo it last night?” Zhang Yin was more familiar with Lin Xiu and started to tease him.

“Screw you.” Lin Xiu glared at him when he heard him.

Lin Xiu felt a little strange as though his heart was feeling uneasy. He sensed that something might have happened.

He was about to head to the arena at 1 to spar with Yu Yi.

‘Would something happen?’

Lin Xiu frowned. Regardless of what happens, I won’t shrink back.

He headed to the gravity room. He was already used to four times gravity and after unlocking his second gene lock and becoming a rank 5 warrior, he had become a lot stronger than before.

‘I should be able to adapt to six times gravity now, right?’

Upon thinking about it, Lin Xiu slotted his card into the machine and activated it before clicking on six times gravity.

Li Ping and Zhang Yin who were relaxing inside suddenly had a change in expression: “What the…” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

They were forced straight to the ground from standing positions.

They had difficulty in breathing and it felt as though their brains were cut short of oxygen.

“How many times gravity is this…” Li Ping clenched his teeth and said.

They had become rank 4 warriors the night before but did not expect to feel unbearable under this gravity.

But Lin Xiu stood as though there was no difference.

Unlocking the second gene lock had affected his body greatly and improved his physique substantially.

Although his movements had turned slower and had been impacted, he was able to accept the intensity.

Lin Xiu activated the laser beam training and the ceiling opened up for many laser machines.

Bang bang bang-

They shot at Lin Xiu right away!

The dense cluster of laser beams looked as though there were no delays in between and was extremely terrifying.

“What the hell…” Li Ping stood up after much difficulty and his face changed when he saw Lin Xiu’s training.

Zhang Yin’s expression was also of shock as they both quickly hid at the corner.

Lin Xiu continued to avoid all the laser beams!

The laser beams came extremely close one after another, but it was nothing for Lin Xiu as he avoided them.

Bang bang bang-

All the laser beams struck the ground that was made out of a unique material that caused the laser beams to bounce off and shoot towards Lin Xiu. Lin Xiu continued to avoid every single laser beam that missed him by a hair’s breadth!

These laser beams were nothing to Lin Xiu!

“This is too much…” Zhang Yin and Li Ping gulped down their salivas at the sight of Lin Xiu’s training.

They already had difficulty moving under the heavy gravity but Lin Xiu was able to avoid all the laser beams!

This was a strength that they could no longer strive for, they were simply eating his dust!
