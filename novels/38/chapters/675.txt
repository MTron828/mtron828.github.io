”Well, I will pay attention.”

Lin Xiu laughed and said with a grin.

“Which way are you going?”

Lei Tong looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

"This way."

Lin Xiu looked at the far side at this time, and then said aloud.

"Then let's stop here, if fated will meet again."

Lei Tong patted Lin Xiu's shoulder at this time, and then said aloud.

He seems to have already thought about where to go.

“Well, goodbye.”

Lin Xiu laughed, looking at Lei Tong, and after the other Martial Artists left in different directions, Lin Xiu walked to the older one In front of the pilot, he said to him: “Do you know where Fengyuecheng is?”

“Fengyuecheng!?”

I heard Lin With Xiu's words, the elderly driver immediately startedled, and then subconsciously said: “Where are you going?”

His face seemed to have changed slightly and he became a little ugly. .

"Yes."

Lin Xiu nod, although Luo Yue's parents didn't tell Lin Xiu the specific address, Lin Xiu received a message from him who didn't know who sent him information.

Luo Yue, in this city.

“This is the main city of Marci planet. The distance to go there is very long.”

“And the Martial Artists there are very strong, not good Deal with it.”

The older driver said with a serious face at this time.

"How far is it?"

Lin Xiu raised his brow and said aloud.

“March Week is about the same size as our Earth, and probably needs more than half the distance of Earth.”

The driver said helplessly.

“This is too far.”

"Can you send me there."

Lin Xiu said.

"You are our life saving benefactor, if we can, we will send you there, but this can't work."

“We are not the people of March planet, Spaceship will be attacked if it flies to other cities.”

“Look, this is why we can only stay here.”

He said with a bitter smile.

“In this way, they seem to discriminate against us Earth people…”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said.

"In fact, in the eyes of the Markey planet, we Earth is just an indigenous planet."

This pilot helpedlessly said.

"I'll go first, goodbye."

Lin Xiu nodded, and then follow the direction he said, go ahead.

The older driver looked at Lin Xiu's back and couldn't help shook the head.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Although Lin Xiu's strength was very strong before, but even so, Lin Xiu's strength is still too weak on Marki planet.

At the same time, Lin Xiu has continued to go to the front.

Looking at the far side, there is an endless forest.

Take out his mobile phone and look at it. That anonymous text message says that Luo Yue is in Fengyicheng.

Now that the mobile phone is on this planet, there is no signal anymore, and it is temporarily unavailable.

It can only serve as the role of checking time.

“Most of Earth…”

Even if the distance is farther, he will go there, and there should be other means of transportation on this planet. Just take those transportations Tools, it should be fast.

Soon, Lin Xiu entered the forest.

The surrounding air is a bit cool, and there seems to be some strange birds in the forest, making strange noises.

The trees on this planet are also different from those on Earth, they are very tall, and these trees have many spikes, which look a bit scary.

oh la la oh la la ——

When I walked to the front, I heard a sound of running water.

There is a small river.

At this time, Lin Xiu was also a little hungry. After a closer look, there seemed to be fish in the river.

Lin Xiu took his black glow spear and walked into the river.

The fishes in the water didn't seem to panic at all when they saw themselves walking by.

Moreover, there is a fish that looks bigger, but it swims towards itself!

Very fast!

Lin Xiu brows slightly wrinkle, in this brief moment, the fish just flew directly!

When it was in the air, its mouth opened wide, showing two rows of unusually sharp teeth, and it was going to bite Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu saw this scene, his eyes widened, and the spear in his hand pierced out instantly, penetrating the entire fish body directly from its mouth!

"Congratulations to the master for killing the Tier 4 Evolution Beast Toothfish and gaining experience 425740!"

Huh? Is this fish still a Tier 4 evolutionary beast?

Lin Xiu was also surprised at this time.

This Marki planet's creature is really different from Earth.

The most direct difference is that the creatures here seem to be too big.

Big mosquitoes, big caterpillars, and those big plants, flowers…

Lin Xiu was also a little hungry at this time, sitting on the bank of the river On a stone, and then with a thought, as the source power was released, it instantly lived into a red lotus fire, and the fish on the spear was directly cooked.

There is still a slight focus on the epidermis.

“en? It smells pretty good.”

Lin Xiu sniffed it, and it seemed to be ok, take another bite, this fish is a bit salty, don't Said it was delicious.

"Help! Help!"

As Lin Xiu was enjoying the fish, Lin Xiu suddenly heard a sound from not far away.

Lin Xiu brows slightly wrinkle, and I can see several people and ran to my side.

Two men and one woman, they are all wearing something and some more gorgeous battle uniforms.

But it looks rather embarrassing.

Especially one of the men who looked relatively tall and sturdy, his face turned pale with fright.

“Chen An, be careful!”

When the man kept running forward, accidentally, he tripped on the ground by a branch.

I fell a dog to eat shit.

The other men and women looked panicked and wanted to pull the man to continue running, but at this moment, dozens of people came out of all directions and surrounded them all.

"Run? Where do you go?"

These people are wearing black clothes. One of them seems to be the leading man, holding a long halberd and pointing The two men and the woman said aloud.

The blood on the long halberd in his hand looks terrifying.

“You…what do you want!”

The man who just fell a shit-eating man, then slowly got up and said to him.

His eyes are full of panic expressions.

Lin Xiu is right behind them, watching this scene, not panicking at all, but eating fish each minding their own business.

This is really Interesting. I didn't expect that I encountered this kind of interesting thing when I first came to March Planet.

And Lin Xiu also noticed that these people have yellow skin and black hair. They look like Huaxia people. The only difference is their eyes.
