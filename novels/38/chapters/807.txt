Chapter 808: Find News About Luo Yue

“That’s right, that’s Fengyun City!”

Seeing this scene, Liu Pan said a little excitedly.

“It’s been ten years since I last went there. I didn’t expect it to change so much now.”

Liu Pan said with emotion.

“En, then let’s go down quickly.”

Lin Xiu nodded, then drove the mechanical tiger from the mountainside to the city gate of Fengyun City.

thump thump-

At this time, Lin Xiu felt that his heart was beating a little faster.

Fengyun City – after so long, he finally arrived at Fengyun City.

Luo Yue, are you really here?

/

It didn’t take long for the two of them to stand at the gate of Fengyun City.

The city gate looked very tall and imposing.

The open city gate was very huge, with two rows of warriors standing guard on both sides.

Wearing a uniform and had the same sword.

Lin Xiu subconsciously activated the Analytic eye to scan them and found that the strength of these guards turned out to be all master warrior-level warriors.

Moreover, these master warrior-level warriors were at the peak of the level.

Sure enough, the strength of Fengyun City is too terrifying.

This kind of warrior is actually just a gatekeeper.

Anyone who goes to the earth would probably be a ruler.

“Stop!”

Just when Lin Xiu and Liu Pan rode the giant mechanical tiger and wanted to enter, two soldiers came over and blocked them both.

“Except for contestants, or spectators, no entry or exit will be allowed in the recent days.”

The two soldiers said to Lin Xiu and Liu Pan.

“We are contestants.”

Lin Xiu jumped out of the mechanical tiger, then took out the competition card he had obtained earlier.

When Lin Xiu went to the Divine Fire Cave, he asked Liu Pan to keep it for him.

Otherwise, it would have been burned into the scum in the cave.

At this time, Liu Pan also took out his entry card and handed it over.

The two soldiers scanned the entry card with a special machine and the information of Lin Xiu and Liu Pan was immediately displayed on it.

The two checked it and once they were sure that it was correct, they were relieved.

“My darling, Brother Lin, do you feel that the strength of these soldiers seems to be at the master warrior level!”

After Liu Pan entered Fengyun City, he immediately took a breath and said.

“En, the captain just now was at the King warrior level.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

When he just arrived, he realized that the strength of one of the leaders turned out to be King warrior.

A King warrior is just a team leader who guards the gate.

How strong is this Fengyun City?

“These cannot be ridden.”

After entering quickly, some staff who managed the street immediately blocked Lin Xiu and Liu Pan’s way.

“Alright.”

Lin Xiu and Liu Pan didn’t ride this thing at this time and just let them drag it away.

Now the sky has darkened, but the entire Fengyun City seems to be full of lights, extremely bright.

There are a lot of pedestrians on the street and found that there are almost as many master warrior-level warriors on the street as dogs.

“There were numerous rank 9 warriors too and so many master warriors.”

Liu Pan couldn’t help but exclaim at this time.

“Oh right, let’s find a place to rest first.”

Liu Pan continued to speak.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded and soon found a large hotel.

There were so many people checking in and it was hard to get a double room.

After entering the room, Lin Xiu took a shower, stood in the hall wearing pajamas and could not help but exhale comfortably.

It was indeed a little tiring to be rushing around these few days.

He stood on the balcony, opened the windows, and looked outside.

“Fatty, do you know anyone here?”

At this time, Lin Xiu said to Liu Pan, who was sitting there watching the projection.

“Hehehe...”

Liu Pan didn’t know what to watch and showed a wretched smile.

At this time, it seemed that Lin Xiu hadn’t heard the words.

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment, then walked over and saw Fatty watching some kind of indescribable action movie

.

This action movie was even a real 3D projection, it looked like a real person was there.

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he was speechless.

“Fatty!”

Lin Xiu shouted at this moment and Liu Pan came to his senses.

“Haha, Brother Lin, there are good brothers here...”

“Don’t look at these, let me ask you, do you know anyone in Fengyun City?”

Lin Xiu helplessly rubbed his eyebrows at this time, then said aloud.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s serious expression at this time, Fatty also turned off this thing and said seriously, “Well, I do know some people.”

The fat man nodded.

“If you want to get some news, I do have a way.”

This fat man seemed to know what Lin Xiu wanted to do and said aloud.

“Take me, I want to find someone.”

Lin Xiu said aloud. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“No.”

But Liu Pan shook his head directly at this moment.

“Why?”

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment, then said subconsciously.

“Because...”

Liu Pan seemed a little hesitant at this time.

“Just tell me.”

Seeing Liu Pan’s hesitant expression, Lin Xiu said lightly.

“They only accept people from the Marqi planet.”

Liu Pan spoke directly at this time.

Lin Xiu quickly came to his senses, probably because he had black pupils, those people would not entertain him.

He has been on this Marqi planet for a while and Lin Xiu knew that the people of this Marqi planet are very discriminatory towards those who do not have blue pupils.”

“Well, you can help me find someone.”

Lin Xiu said.

“Who are you looking for?”

“Her.”

Lin Xiu took out his phone at this time and there was a photo of Luo Yue on it.

It was taken by Lin Xiu secretly.

“Damn, who is this beauty?”

Looking at the photos on the phone, Liu Pan’s eyes widened, as if shocked.

Although it’s not a proper photo, it’s surprising enough.

“Looks good huh.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said.

“Cough, this, is this sister-in-law?”

Looking at Lin Xiu’s face, the fat man also touched his head and said with a smile.

“Don’t waste time, help me find out if she is in Fengyun City.”

Lin Xiu glared at him helplessly, then said.

“Okay, send me the photo.” Liu Pan nodded and said.

“How much gold do you need?” Lin Xiu said aloud after watching Liu Pan prepare to go out to help him find out.

“Damn, don’t ask me that if you treat me like a brother.” Liu Pan laughed and scolded when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

“Okay.” Lin Xiu also smiled.

After spending time together these days, Lin Xiu knew that this fat man was indeed a friend worth making.

“By the way, what’s my sister-in-law’s name?”

When Liu Pan was about to go out, he seemed to think of something and asked out of curiosity.

“Luo Yue.”
