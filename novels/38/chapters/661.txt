Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Luo Yue widened her eyes before looking down at the blood all over her chest.

Boom —

‘At the next moment, there was a sharp pain in her chest as her ‘Yuan’ disappeared.

Then, she immediately fell to the ground.

“How are you? Are you alright?!”

At that moment, Lin Xiu had immediately got to Luo Yue. He held his spear with his right hand and caught Luo Yue with his left.

Lin Xiu’s eyes were both blood red as the pain of losing her was worse than himself being injured.

“Tm fine...”

Luo Yue’s face had turned ghastly pale.

But she was still trying to smile while reassuring Lin Xiu.

Right at that moment, there was a scary laser beam that came from the distance!

Xiu–

Lin Xiu’s eyes completely changed as he held onto Luo Yue and moved aside.

‘There were a large number of drones in the air and all of them were giving out a large amount of terrifying laser beams.

‘These laser beams were powerful enough to fire through a rank 8 warrior’s ‘rank’.

“Hehe.....looks like all of them are here. The both of you will be buried here!”

‘The elder from the Zhuo family quickly took the opportunity to hide in a corner as he said with a twisted expression on his face.

Crack Crack – —

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue’s face. He tightened his grip on his Dark Edge Spear and he cracked his knuckles.

Hmm?

The elder from the Jiang family wanted to look for a chance to attack Lin Xiu but Lin Xiu’s condition was a little peculiar.

There was a murderous intention in his eyes and it surprised a rank 9 warrior like him as his body trembled.

Damn it. Does this brat have some other hidden skills....?

There was a large amount of energy gathered around the muzzle on the drone. It looks like there was another round of laser beams that would be released soon!

The hospital in Sky City...

Lin Xiu took a look around and ran in the opposite direction!

“Don’t let him get away!”

‘When the elder from the Zhuo family saw what happened, he screamed.

As he screamed, Lin Xiu could see a large number of warriors headed towards him from the end of the street!

‘These warriors were fully equipped and it was obvious that they were normal warriors.

As he took a closer look in the sky, all of the muzzles from the drones were all aimed at Lin Xiu!

“Move!!!”

Lin Xiu was enraged and rushed forward!

Luo Yue had been badly wounded. If he didn’t get her to the hospital soon, the consequences could be deadly.

Lin Xiu grabbed Luo Yue along with his spear and rushed out of the place!

Xiu xiu xiu -—

The drone in the air was shooting out laser beams from its muzzle and all of the beams were headed towards Lin Xiu!

However, Lin Xiu had already released his ‘Yuan’. His protective shield was now red in colour and was looking horrifying.

Boom boom boom – —

As the scary laser beams landed on Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’, there were continuous explosions that came from it.

There were holes around the entire ground around them and with smoke everywhere.

However, with the protection of his ‘Yuan’, Lin Xiu wasn’t affected at all. Lin Xiu was still headed face on with the hundreds of warriors!

“Go to hell!”

‘When the elders from the Zhuo family and Jiang family saw how Lin Xiu was still moving forward, they couldn’t help but screamed.

These warriors were the best amongst those in their family. The warriors from the Nan family were here as well. With all of these men gathered together, Lin Xiu would definitely be dead!

There were no other expressions on Lin Xiu’s face as there was only hatred written all over his face.

He held onto his spear with one hand as he tried to move past all the warriors ahead of him!

Clang clang clang – —

As the sounds of metals collided together, it sounded as if Lin Xiu had rushed into a no-man’s land.

Each time he moved his spear that was glowing in a dark red hue, there were several warriors that would lose their ‘Yuan’ and the tip of his spear would have pierced through several heads.

“Luo Yue, hand in there!”

Lin Xiu was swinging around his spear like a mad man. He looked down at Luo Yue who was in his arms and noticed that she was slowly closing her eyes, looking weak.

“Do not sleep!”

Seeing how weak she was, Lin Xiu’s eyes turned red and he was moving his spear around frantically.

Koong loong —

As he moved his spear around, there were large numbers of flaming birds that were released into the air. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Lin Xiu’s strength now was much stronger than he used to be and the flaming birds were the same as well. With Lin Xiu’s strength that increased, they had become even more terrifying.

Lin Xiu could feel the anger in his chest that was beyond words. He wanted to destroy every one of them here!

‘The energy source that he got in the Tower of Trials that looked like a white flame was initially buried deep inside Lin Xiu’s body but they have not been completely absorbed.

At this very moment, the energy source had started becoming active.

The blood in his veins had become heated as well.

‘There was a bright white glow that covered Lin Xiu’s entire body. Along with the effect from the skills – ‘Power of the Stars’, the glow around him was becoming even brighter and was blinding their eyes.

So warm...

Luo Yue rested her head against Lin Xiu’s chest. She could feel that Lin Xiu’s chest was extremely warm and the pain on her body seemed to have reduced.

‘What was happening?!

‘The elders from the Zhuo family and Jiang family were both confused when they saw what was happening in front of him.

They could clearly feel that the energy around Lin Xiu was getting stronger!

Lin Xiu continued moving the spear in his hands like a robot who wouldn’t get tired. He was killing all the warriors that dare come close to him.

‘These warriors were all rank 7 warriors but for Lin Xiu, they were weaklings. They were so weak that with one gentle sweep from Lin Xiu’s spear, it was already powerful enough to take away their lives.

‘The ‘Yuan’ that they had around them was nothing for Lin Xiu.

With one easy move, he could immediately break their ‘Yuan’!

“Bomb him this instant!!!”

‘The elder from the Jiang family was getting anxious as he screamed into the air.

Lin Xiu was moving around like a lawnmower. As he moved his spear, he had already gotten rid of a huge amount of their warriors.

His abilities were terrifying.

With the elders command, the drones in the air released their largest muzzles and started releasing all types of bombs from the air!

‘They were all attacking Lin Xiu from the back!

The three main families of the Sky City were attacking Lin Xiu and the Federations would not be involved in this..
