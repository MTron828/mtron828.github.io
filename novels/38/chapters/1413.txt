1414 God Weapon – Dark Edge!!! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

As the Spirit Fire Energy Stone was placed into the Book of Reform, there was a bright light released.

“What is that…”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng who were still sipping on their water looked stunned.

“What.is that?!”

Luo Yue was surprised as well to see the Book of Reform.

Lin Xiu did not say a word but continued taking out huge numbers of god-level odd crystals.

Then, he threw them into the Book of Reform.

The Book of Reform was like a black hole and all of the odd crystals disappeared into the book.

“God-level odd crystals…”

Xiao Qingchen was in shock.

This was because he noticed that Lin Xiu was still throwing more god-level odd crystals into it.

How many of them did this man have?!

Both of their mouths were wide open.

“A hundred. That should be enough.”

As Lin Xiu put in the last crystal, there was an even brighter light that was released!

Bubbling

The book floated in the air and there was a sound coming from it that was similar to boiling water.

“Lin Xiu, what is that?”

Luo Yue started asking as well.

She was incredibly curious.

“Dark Edge.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

Then, the tip of the spear slowly appeared from the book!

The spear was slowly coming out of the space inside the Book of Reform.

When half of it had appeared, Lin Xiu grabbed onto the spear and pulled it out!

The entire sky was filled with lightning and thunder when Lin Xiu pulled out Dark Edge from the book.

Boom

“What’s happening?!”

The rest of the warriors had no idea what was going on.

“Is it about to rain?!”

Some even thought that a storm was coming.

Thunder

The thunder did not disappear but instead, they became even bigger.

Lightning strikes.

The huge lightning was about to land on Lin Xiu’s spear!

“Move aside!”

Lin Xiu realised what was about to happen and quickly warned the rest.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng disappeared from the ground.

Luo Yue also knew that she shouldn’t be there and quickly took a few steps backwards.

Boom

The thick lightning immediately struck Dark Edge and it travelled through Lin Xiu’s body.

Pfft

The impact from the lightning was horrifying and even Lin Xiu spat out a mouthful of blood.

Damn it! How is it so powerful?!

However, at the same time, the lightning did not stop and continued striking the Dark Edge.

The spear started shaking and there was a ‘ringing’ sound that appeared.

“The birth of a God-level weapon?!”

Mr Sima’s figure was in the air as he stared at the weapon in Lin Xiu’s arm. He looked beyond shocked.

He knew that it was Lin Xiu but he couldn’t understand how Lin Xiu had a god-level weapon!

God’ weapon was something that was rare even for God Kings!

“Right…”

Mr Sima thought of the Spirit Fire Energy Stone that Lin Xiu picked. Did he ask for that because he wanted to build this weapon?!

So..he only got the weapon now?!

Mr Sima’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

...

Lin Xiu remained standing on the ground. Just as his spear was getting attacked by the lightning, Lin Xiu suffered along with it as well.

However, after nine lightning strikes, all of them disappeared.

“Are you alright?!”

Luo Yue quickly stood by Lin Xiu’s side as she was worried sick.

Blood has been coming out of Lin Xiu’s mouth continuously.

“Don’t worry. I’m fine.”

Lin Xiu smiled as well.

“But why was there a lightning strike? It felt like a God’s test.”

Lin Xiu complained about it to the sky.

There were still lightning bolts all over Dark Edge.

It looked terrifying.

...

“Hmm?”

Lin Xiu noticed it as well.

Some part of the lightning must have been left behind in the spear.

“Lin Xiu, what happened earlier?!”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng came back and were both curious.

“I don’t know. Probably went through a God’s test.”

Lin Xiu spitted nonsense.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng were both dumbfounded. As if anyone would actually believe what Lin Xiu was saying.

“Well, both of you better finish the water first before it expires.”

Lin Xiu pursed his lips.

The other two men quickly finished their water.

The Divine Soul Water evaporated quickly and they would be heartbroken to even waste one drop of it.

“Let’s go back to my city first then back to earth?”

Lin Xiu thought about it before asking Luo Yue.

“En.”

Luo Yue nodded her head.

“Earth? The place where you were before this?”

Xiao Qingchen overheard the conversation and wanted to know more gossip.

“En.”

“Why would you want to head back?”

Yuan Zheng couldn’t understand.

In the Warrior God Realm, the energy in the air was richer and it was definitely better to cultivate here.

“Back home to get married.”

As soon as those words came out of his mouth, Luo Yue blushed but she didn’t say anything against it.

“Married?”

“Why get married at such a young age?”

Xiao Qingchen asked subconsciously.

“Did you really think that everyone is like you? Where no one wants you?”

Yuan Zheng pursed his lips.

“Huh? Yuan Zheng! Are you making fun of me now? Why don’t we fight it out?!”

Yuan Zheng was unhappy about it and he glared at Yuan Zheng.

“Come on! Why would I be afraid of you?!”

Yuan Zheng pulled up his sleeves and shouted.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but laughed as he stared at these men.

Back then during the contest, these two were supposedly the most decent people.

But at the look of it now, they were both clowns.

Boom

After some time, the city gates finally opened.

“It’s opened!”

“Let’s go!”

Most of the warriors started leaving.

Warrior God City’s sky has been locked by a special force and all of them were only allowed to leave through the gates.

Lin Xiu held Luo Yue’s hands and they were ready to leave.

“This is goodbye then. We shall meet in the future if there’s a chance.”

Standing by the gate, Lin Xiu bidded farewell to both Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng.

“Alright, goodbye!”

“Right! When you get married, you have to invite us!”

“I would like to experience life on earth as well to see what type of world that is that gave birth to a monster like you.”

Xiao Qingchen laughed.

“Goodbye.”

Just as Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were about to step out, there was a loud explosion in the sky.
