1438 Tianbei City

One day, the God Kings found this planet and found the tool spirit.

They dug deep into the ground and absorbed all of the core energy of the Dark Planet.

Most of the powerful warriors on the planet were killed.

Ever since they’ve absorbed everything from the core of the planet, they then worked together to seal the planet.

No one from the planet was allowed to leave.

At the same time, no one was allowed to enter.

“Damn it! I heard that those from Tianbei City have already become slaves for the Tianshen Pavillion. They’re getting them to dig the Ruins!”

“If this continues, the entire planet will be destroyed!”

They continued sipping on their beers as they rant about their satisfaction.

However, they were helpless.

Those from the Warrior God Realm were too powerful.

None of them from the Dark Planet could resist against them.

“Brother…”

Lin Xiu suddenly appeared next to those who were ranting.

“You are?”

The rest of them looked up at Lin Xiu.

He looked like a stranger here.

“Excuse me but I just want to know where Tianbei City is?”

Lin Xiu chuckled as he asked.

“Tianbei City? You don’t even know where it is?”

Everyone in the bar then glared at Lin Xiu.

Tianbei City was one of the most famous cities on the planet.

Everyone knew about it.

All of them had a different look in their eyes.

But soon, these assumptions disappeared.

If these two were not from the Dark Planet and did not live here, they wouldn’t have been able to survive for long.

Lin Xiu looked like he was comfortable being here.

“I was busy cultivating and haven’t been out for a long time.”

Lin Xiu simply gave an excuse.

Then, he casually released a small amount of his energy.

With that done, all of them looked at Lin Xiu with a different look in their eyes.

Such terrifying energy!

As they felt the surge of energy coming from him, they were surprised.

“Senior! Tianbei City has already been conquered by those from the Warrior God Realm!”

One of them thought that Lin Xiu must have been an elder, strayed far away from civilization.

“I heard about it as well.”

“What would be the fastest way to get there?”

Lin Xiu then continued asking.

“All of the transportation has been ruined. You’ll have to walk at least 2 miles North to reach Tianbei City.”

Another man answered.

“Alright. Thank you.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head, looked at Luo Yue as they both left.

“Such terrifying energy! That man must have been one of the elders from our planet!”

As soon as Lin Xiu left, all of them let out a breath of relief.

When Lin Xiu stood by them, they felt pressured.

It was terrifying.

“Those in Tianbei City are doomed.”

One of them commented about it.

“That may not be necessary. Tianbei City is now filled with powerful warrior gods!”

Another man spoke as his face turned gloomy.

Those from the Warrior God Realm were too powerful.

None of them from the Dark Planet were able to fight against them.

“I’ve never been there so I can’t set a coordinate for us to be transported there.”

Lin Xiu looked at the Spatial Cube and let out a bitter smile.

The only reason why he could get here was because he once saw the coordinate from Commander Pang.

“Let’s just fly over there.”

Luo Yue spoke after thinking about it.

If they don’t it would take a long time.

Both of them gathered their energy and levitated in the air, headed toward North!

“Continue looking for it!”

“You bunch of rubbish! You don’t even know where the ruins are on your own planet?!”

There were several warriors from the Warrior God Realm that were looking at a group of slaves who were digging the ground beneath them.

The Dark Planet was different from the other planets. They have black stones that are incredibly tough.

It was difficult to dig anything here.

But, if they used the machinery, they were afraid that they might destroy the ruins.

It has been a long time and most energy from the ruins would have dissipated.

“Cough cough – – ”

One of the men, who seemed weaker, was moving slower than the others.

Slam– –

Suddenly, there was a whip that landed on his body.

There was a bloody streak that instantly appeared on his arm.

“I told you to get on it!”

One of the men who wore a peculiar uniform with his head wrapped inside a transparent helmet screamed at the man on the ground.

The man on the ground had long hair and no one could see what he actually looked like.

“I know….Cough cough…”

“Rubbish!”

The man swore and sent another whip to the slave.

“Isn’t that enough?”

Another man frowned and resisted them.

He also had a diamond shovel in his hand.

This was none other than Luo Yue’s brother, Luo Huatian.

Slam– –

The man’s eyes turned vicious after hearing what Luo Huatian was saying.

He lifted his whip and aimed it at Luo Huatian!

Luo Huatian did not give in and grabbed it with his hand.

He caught onto the whip and pulled on it.

“This man is resisting orders! Kill him!”

The man had a horrible look on his face.

He turned around and shouted for help.

With the commotion, the other warriors then pulled out their machete and headed over.

Luo Huatian then had a bad feeling about it.

He threw the shovel at them and ran in the opposite direction.

“Where do you think you’re going?!”

The man with the whip roared.

“Get him back here right now! I want him alive!” Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

Luo Huatian might have been quick but the guards were faster.

Soon, they surrounded Luo Huatian.

F*ck!

There was a huge machete on his neck.

“Well, well….aren’t you trying to get yourself killed?”

The man with the whip slowly walked towards him and slowly pulled out a dagger from his pocket.

“Run? Well, I shall then teach you a lesson for doing so…”

“Let go of him!”

Another man rushed forward but he was whipped by one of the guards.

“This is your consequence for resisting…..”

Just as he was about to thrust the dagger into Luo Huatian, there were two figures that appeared from the sky!

Boom – –

The entire ground started shaking as they landed on the ground.
