Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Bai Chuan, what do you mean?”

When the left and right guardians heard Bai Chuan’s words, their eyes suddenly changed.

“That’s exactly what I mean, I don’t want to die like this with you idiots.”

Bai Chuan said with a cold snort.

Now, he should be able to clearly feel that Lin Xiu’s strength is unusual.

If they continue fighting, although there is a chance of winning, it is also possible that Lin Xiu will kill him.

These old guys, they value their own lives even more.

“Bai Chuan, you dare to leave?”

Elder Lin had just used the Wind attribute source mark and he was very upset that he did not cause any damage to Lin Xiu. Hearing Bai Chuan’s words at this time, his face became even more sinister.

“You dare to keep me?”

Bai Chuan sneered.

“I didn’t belong to your Tang Pavilion at first, I belonged to the Bai family.”

Hearing Bai Chuan’s words, the expressions of the other three Sage warriors became ugly, but they did not dare to make any move.

“You don’t have to leave, just stay.”

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s voice came over.

Hearing this voice, they all subconsciously raised their heads and looked in the air and they clearly saw Lin Xiu’s figure.

“Courting death!”

Bai Chuan’s face changed slightly and with a wave of his left hand, all the rocks on the ground burst.

And at this moment, all those bursting rocks floated in the air. With the use of Bai Chuan’s power, these rocks directly formed a huge earth dragon, which charged towards Lin Xiu in the air!

“Humph!”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu snorted coldly, without dodging, the Dark Edge spear in both hands stabbed straight down from the top!

“Boy, die!”

Bai Chuan roared angrily and a more powerful force suddenly came from the body of the rock dragon, charging towards Lin Xiu!

The rock dragon was showing its teeth and claws, as if it was going to tear Lin Xiu’s body to pieces.

“Break!”

Lin Xiu looked at the giant rock dragon charging towards his body, holding the Dark Edge spear in both hands, he continued to charge down from the air!

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s figure was surrounded by a large number of flames.

boom boom boom —

As the spear charged down, the huge rock dragon was directly hit by Lin Xiu’s spear and exploded.

swoosh—

And at this moment, a cold light appeared in front of Bai Chuan.

The pupils in Bai Chuan’s eyes shrank slightly, but it seemed that there was no way to dodge and there was no way to unfold the “Sphere”!

boom–

The next moment, Bai Chuan’s head was directly pierced by Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear!

“Elder Bai!”

Although Bai Chuan wanted to escape just now and made the expressions of the two guardians and Elder Lin change greatly, seeing Bai Chuan being killed at this time, they suddenly felt a kind of sadness like they sympathized with him.

“Huh? Where did you go?”

There was no system prompt in his mind, so Lin Xiu could be sure that the warrior did not die.

At the same time, Bai Chuan’s figure appeared several miles away.

“Damn boy… Almost died in his hands.” Bai Chuan was panting at this time.

Thinking of the shot just now, he almost burst his head!

At this time, if you look closely, you can see that there is a white strange source mark on Bai Chuan’s forehead.

His source mark was different from the source mark strength of ordinary warriors. It was not an attribute source mark, but a source mark with a special ability to clone.

What Lin Xiu just killed was just his clone.

“Boy, if you want to kill me, I won’t let the matter drop!”

He muttered to himself with a grim expression.

In the next moment, his figure disappeared.

“I actually let him go.”

At this time, as Lin Xiu’s thoughts were released, feeling the aura of the warriors in the surrounding area, Lin Xiu couldn’t help frowning.

Looking at Tang Pavilion’s left and right guardians and Elder Lin, there was a strong killing intent in his eyes.

He already let one of them escape, so the remaining three can’t be let go so easily.

Clearly aware of the strong killing intent in Lin Xiu’s eyes, the three Sage warriors directly unfolded the ‘Sphere’. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

They didn’t want to be killed by Lin Xiu’s strange movement technique.

The left and right guardians also looked at each other at this time and the source mark on their foreheads lit up at the same time.

There is a red source mark on the left guardian’s forehead and a blue source mark on the right guardian’s forehead.

“go!!!”

As the two of them roared loudly, a burst of ice-attribute energy, along with fire-attribute energy, gathered together and charged towards Lin Xiu!

what is this!?

Seeing this scene, the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes also changed slightly.

Under the convergence of the two forces of ice and fire, it seems that a special reaction has occurred. Forming a terrifying ice and fire tornado!

Looking at the incoming ice and fire tornado, Lin Xiu quickly waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand and immediately released flames one after another, colliding with the ice and fire tornado.

bang bang bang-

But the fire and ice tornado seemed to be extremely powerful. In the next moment, all the flaming birds released by Lin Xiu have blasted away.

Hitting Lin Xiu in an instant!

Although Lin Xiu unfolded the ‘Sphere’ for protection, this powerful force made Lin Xiu fly out!

Boom—

He flew a distance and the entire ground shook wildly!

“Lin Xiu!”

Seeing this scene, Ji Mei couldn’t help shouting loudly.

“Hmph, this is our strength.”

The left and right guardians were suspended in the air at this time as they said coldly.

They can be sure that this time, Lin Xiu would either die or be disabled.

The ‘Source of ice and fire’ of the left and right guardians is really powerful.

Elder Lin watched this scene and after heaving a sigh of relief, he also spoke to the left and right guardians.

“The power generated from layering the two kinds of source mark power is really terrifying.”

Hearing Elder Lin’s words, both the left and right guardians touched their beards, with a proud look on their faces.

This ‘Source of Ice and Fire’, combined with the source mark, is the most powerful force they can release together.

“Let’s go and see if that kid is dead.”

At this moment, Left Guardian looked at the explosion caused by the source of ice and fire and there was even a mushroom cloud rising from the ground.

That was enough to see the horror of this power.

Lin Xiu was definitely dead.

At the same time that the three of them flew over to Lin Xiu’s side, Tang Qi and the other two warriors also walked over to Ji Mei’s side.

“You three bastards have caused my Tang Pavilion to suffer heavy losses. You are all dead meat!”
