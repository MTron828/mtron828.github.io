Chapter 529: Break the Sphere!

Break right now!

Lin Xiu roared in his heart and the spearhead stabbed directly on the man’s ‘Sphere’!

Boom–

With a sound, at this moment, a crack appeared on the Sphere and at the next moment, a hole appeared!

Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear directly penetrated the ‘Sphere’!

The man also relied on the ‘Sphere’ and did not expect such a thing to happen at all.

At this moment, his head was pierced by the Dark Edge spear directly!

“Congratulations to the master for killing a rank 6 warrior! You’ve gained 50 million experience!”

But now Lin Xiu didn’t pay attention to the prompt of experience gained in his mind. At this time, he looked at the Dark Edge spear he was holding and pierced the warrior’s head, still in disbelief.

Because just now, he actually stabbed with force and actually broke his ‘Sphere’.

It was not so easy to break the ‘Sphere’, unless you have overwhelming strength but he didn’t use the ‘Fury’ skill just now.

“He… he actually killed Elder Jiang!” The people from the Royal Beast Sect were all shocked.

The confrontation just now was only a short moment. They didn’t expect that one of them was killed!

“Kill him for me!” The rest of the people’s eyes turned red, then shouted loudly.

A warrior took out a whistle from the air and these huge bird evolved beasts heard this strange blowing sound and in the next moment, they all seemed to go crazy and rushed towards Lin Xiu frantically!

The claws of these bird evolved beasts were very sharp. Lin Xiu was not paying attention for a second and was scratched on the back of his hand and there were several deep wounds on the back of his hand.

But this wound didn’t make Lin Xiu afraid, instead, it ignited Lin Xiu’s fighting spirit.

Jiang Tao and the others looked at Lin Xiu who was not far away. Even in the face of several rank 6 warriors and the terrifying bird evolved beast, Lin Xiu did not concede at all.

Just now, they thought that Lin Xiu was very strong, but they didn’t expect that he was so strong.

“Captain, what should we do?” The warriors beside Jiang Tao looked at Jiang Tao and said.

Jiang Tao looked at Luo Yue and Lin Xiu and the expressions in his eyes flickered.

After a brief wave of silence, Jiang Tao clenched the weapon in his hand, then shouted, “Kill these bastards!”

With Jiang Tao’s order, the dozens of warriors behind all attacked the people from the Royal Beast Sect!

“You dare!” Bai Fei’s expression suddenly changed as he watched Jiang Tao and the others attack.

Under normal circumstances, Bai Fei and the others would not be afraid of Jiang Tao and the others.

Because Jiang Tao had many people with him but most of them were rank 5 warriors, and there were only two or three rank 6 warriors.

But now Luo Yue and Lin Xiu’s combat power was too strong and just these two people could contain all their people.

“Kill!”

Jiang Tao ignored Bai Fei’s words and roared.

Although the Royal Beast Sect was strong, there was no surveillance in this place. So what if all the people from the Royal Beast Sect die?

And Bai Fei’s attitude just now really annoyed him.

“Go away!” Lin Xiu looked at those bird evolved beasts attacking him again. Lin Xiu’s eyes changed suddenly and he pointed a spear towards the sky and immediately split a bird evolved beast in half!

Blood spurted out of the air in an instant.

Those warriors who originally wanted to go to Lin Xiu’s side to continue to attack saw Jiang Tao and others attacking at this time and their faces changed greatly.

Although most of them are rank 5 warriors, in this situation, it was very unfavorable for them!

“Bastard, get out of here!” Lin Xiu was immediately annoyed by the scars on the back of his hand scratched by those bird evolved beasts.

Because those rank 6 warriors were restrained by Jiang Tao and others, Lin Xiu did not continue to attack them at this time, but attacked those bird evolved beasts first.

Although these bird evolved beasts are ferocious, they were only rank 6 evolved beasts after all. Under Lin Xiu’s attack, they were all killed!

Those Royal Beast Sect people watched their evolved beasts all being killed by Lin Xiu and their hearts were bleeding.

You must know that evolved beasts were ferocious beasts. It was still very difficult to tame them. Even if they had special methods, it was not an easy task.

“Master Bai, hurry up!” A man protected Bai Fei at this time, then said aloud.

Bai Fei looked around and already knew that he had suffered a setback. His eyes were full of resentment as he looked at Lin Xiu who was fighting a short distance away.

Looking at Luo Yue again, Luo Yue was actually holding the long sword in her hand, splitting a warrior’s body into two halves!

If it goes on like this, all of their Royal Beast Sect people would die here!

“Catch her!” Bai Fei looked at Luo Yue over there and roared in a low voice. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

The warrior standing next to him showed hesitation at this time. If they wanted to leave now, there was still a chance, but catching Luo Yue was almost impossible.

Luo Yue’s body skill was so strong that they couldn’t even touch the corners of her clothes even under the siege of these rank 6 warriors.

“I have a way.” Bai Fei gritted his teeth and said, then slowly took out a bottle of powdered thing from his pocket.

When the man saw what Bai Fei had taken out, his eyes suddenly changed.

“But…”

“Do what I tell you to do! Only if we catch her, we will have a chance!” Bai Fei said with a grim expression.

Luo Yue was still holding the long sword in her hand and continued to frantically attack the surrounding rank 6 warriors.

Although those rank 6 warriors were evenly matched with Luo Yue just now, but now that the warriors led by Jiang Tao have joined the battlefield, the battle has changed in an instant.

Although those warriors unfolded the “Sphere”, the “Sphere” consumes their physical strength very quickly and because of the restraint of Jiang Tao and others, Luo Yue was not under so much pressure.

At this time, a warrior’s “Sphere” was about to disappear due to the lack of source strength in the body.

Luo Yue seized this opportunity and slashed directly at him with the long sword!

Swish-

But at this moment, Luo Yue saw a powdery thing sprayed towards her!

Seeing this scene, Luo Yue subconsciously used ‘Sphere’ to block out these powdery things.

But even though she reacted quickly, she still smelled a strange smell.

Not good!

The look in Luo Yue’s eyes changed and when she was about to make a move, her body went limp and she couldn’t even maintain the ‘Sphere’ at this moment!
