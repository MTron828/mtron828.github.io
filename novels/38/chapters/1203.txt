1204 Black Grade

With the huge rock that exploded, the large dragon that was formed by the black particles suddenly appeared.

The rest of the warriors around were shocked. They were so surprised that they froze.

How was this even possible?!!

Fu Tianling looked at the divine soul of the huge black flame dragon that was in the sky. His eyes were filled with disbelief!

!!

He…..he managed to acquire one!

Suddenly, the huge divine soul flew into the air and headed for Lin Xiu’s body.

Fu Tianling looked at the scene that was happening before him and a vicious look appeared in his eyes.

It wasn’t that easy…..to acquire a divine soul!

He screamed loudly internally. Then, he moved and reached out towards Lin Xiu’s body.

Xiu – –

When he moved, there was a bright ray that appeared before him.

His left hand that was aimed at Lin Xiu’s body was forced to stop.

“Are you trying to get yourself killed?”

When he took a closer look, it was Baili Haoling that stood inches away from him.

Her eyes were different from how they were usually. It was now bright red in colour.

It looked frightening.

Fu Tianling shivered as well.

He was afraid of Baili Haoling!

“You…”

Fu Tianling took a few steps backwards subconsciously. Then, when he looked at Lin Xiu who was standing behind her, he saw that the spirit of the black dragon had already entered Lin Xiu’s body!

It’s done!

Lin Xiu slowly opened his eyes that were closed previously.

Fu Tianling took a good look at Lin Xiu. His eyes were pitch black but soon it reverted to normal.

The dragon mark that was on Lin Xiu’s forehead had slowly disappeared as well.

“You wanted to kill me?”

Lin Xiu turned and looked at Fu Tianling before asking in a cold tone.

Although his eyes were shut, he could still guess what happened around him.

When he was about to complete the process, Fu Tianling wanted to disturb him.

“Hmph!”

Fu Tianling pulled his arm back and sneered. Then, he turned around and left.

When Baili Haoling saw what happened, she grabbed onto her dagger and rushed forward.

“Forget it.”

However, Lin Xiu patted her shoulder and stopped her.

Baili Haoling was stunned. When she was about to say something, she turned aside and noticed that Fu Tianyuan and the rest of the warriors were walking toward them.

Fu Tianling was Fu Tianyuan’s younger brother. If they killed him here, the rest of them would definitely help Fu Tianyuan as well.

With her current abilities, she wasn’t strong enough to be able to kill all of the warrior gods here on her own.

“Congratulations, City Lord Lin.”

Fu Tianyuan stood next to Lin Xiu and congratulated him with a bright smile.

“Congratulations!”

The rest of them got close as well and congratulated Lin Xiu.

They looked envious of Lin Xiu as well.

They didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be able to acquire the strongest divine soul here!

It has to be noted that this wasn’t the first time here for most of the city lords but they have failed in comprehending their own divine souls.

“City lord Lin, I’m sure you don’t know anything about spirit power yet?”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was still calm and wasn’t excited at all, he couldn’t help but ask.

“This divine soul is of black grade.”

“Balck grade?”

Lin Xiu was stunned.

Black grade? What does that mean?

Lin Xiu didn’t have much information about the divine soul.

Even with the divine soul that he had acquired earlier, Lin Xiu felt that it was the divine soul who chose him instead.

It was a peculiar feeling.

“City Lord Lin doesn’t know anything about these divine souls?”

Fu Tianyuan seemed surprised.

“Divine souls are also categorised according to their strength. There are three grades in total – red, gold, and black.”

“Gold is most common while red is not found often. As for black, they are extremely rare.”

Upon mentioning these, he took a good look at Lin Xiu.

Fu Tianyuan might not show anything on his face but he was actually quite surprised.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be able to acquire such spirits.

Afterall, that was…

“Brother Lin, you’re powerful indeed.”

Ling Yu and Sun Ruo let out a bitter smile.

It wasn’t their first year here. They would always join the meet every year but until today, they have not acquired their own divine soul.

This was because it was something incredibly difficult.

The odds for a warrior god to comprehend a divine soul was low.

“There’s still time. This space would only be closed after 24 hours. All of you can stay here and take a look around. Maybe you would be able to acquire some other divine soul too.”

Fu Tianyuan mentioned it to the other warriors.

Usually, a warrior god would only be able to acquire one divine soul. It wasn’t that a warrior god couldn’t have two divine souls but it was just a rare occurrence.

Perhaps in the whole warrior god realm, those who had two divine souls could be counted with one hand.

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

The rest of the crowd gathered around for a short moment before heading their ways.

They were only here to congratulate Lin Xiu since he had just acquired such a strong divine soul. His future was bright.

Now that they had done what they were supposed to, all of them went back to their respective places and continued looking at the seals, hoping to acquire their own divine soul.

“Fu Tianyuan looks like someone powerful.”

Baili Haoling whispered to Lin Xiu after Fu Tianyu had left.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

Not only was he strong, Lin Xiu also had a peculiar feeling about him.

This was because Lin Xiu did not sense any hostility coming from him.

This was odd. Doesn’t he know about the conflict between Lin Xiu and Fu Tianling?

“You should also look around and see if you can acquire a divine soul too.”

Lin Xiu shook his head. He no longer wanted to think about it.

“Hmph! I am your master. Obviously I would be able to do better than you!”

Baili Haoling showed a funny face to Lin Xiu. Then, she looked around and stood in front of another huge rock.

Lin Xiu smiled. As he stood on the same spot, he felt that there was an energy inside his body that was connecting with his mind.

The black dragon mark once again appeared on his head.

“Come out here.”

Lin Xiu muttered softly.

With that said, there was a large number of black particles that appeared from Lin Xiu’s body.

All of them gathered right above Lin Xiu.

Then, they slowly formed the shape of a dragon and continued flying around Lin Xiu’s body.

“This…..is so small?”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were wide open as he asked unconsciously.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎
