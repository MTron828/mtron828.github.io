Chapter 514: Did You Change My Clothes For Me?

“Lin Xiu stop! You will be wanted by the federal government!” Lui Wei yelled in terror when he saw this scene.

Hearing Lui Wei’s voice, Lin Xiu’s expression suddenly changed and the tip of the spear stopped when he was about to pierce Zhao Feng’s body. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Spare your dog life, get out.”

Looking at the spearhead so close, Zhao Feng’s body trembled. He really couldn’t imagine that Lin Xiu’s strength was so powerful that he could be killed from just meeting face-to-face.

To be wanted by the federal government was a troublesome thing. It meant that he couldn’t enter any city. Once he entered, he would be arrested.

And the federal government even had rank 9 warriors.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, then said to Lui Wei, “I didn’t break the law I think.”

When Zhao Feng heard Lin Xiu’s words, he was already fuming. He broke into his Zhao family and killed hundreds of people in his Zhao family, then actually said that he did not violate the federal law!?

He was angry inside, but he was still lying on the ground and didn’t dare to move because the tip of the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was still pointing at his head.

Lui Wei frowned, the evidence was conclusive; Zhao’s family was killed and injured and according to the surveillance cameras, it was indeed Lin Xiu’s work. How could he still dare to deny?

“Look.” Lin Xiu pressed a button on the phone at this time and suddenly a small round ball flew over from the air.

Lui Wei looked at this thing, he was taken aback, isn’t this a mini aerial camera?

Lin Xiu took the small ball,, then pressed the button on it. In the next moment, the ball projected some videos in the air.

Everything from Lin Xiu’s arrival at Zhao’s house was recorded!

Zhao Feng saw this scene and his eyes widened. He had no idea that Lin Xiu would record all this!

“I just wanted to find the Young master Zhao to reminisce. I didn’t expect that they would kill me. Moreover, I have a one-star medal. They dared to attack a veteran so it’s not wrong that I defended myself, right?”

Lin Xiu looked at Lui Wei and said.

Lui Wei secretly cursed. As if I would believe that you went to the Zhao’s house to find someone to reminisce about the past.

He had investigated the relationship between Lin Xiu and Zhao’s family and it was obvious that Lin Xiu and Zhao Xia had a grudge.

But it was obvious from the video that all the people from the Zhao family first made a move on Lin Xiu before Lin Xiu resisted.

Everything seemed like Lin Xiu was forced to fight back.

He is really careful…

Lui Wei couldn’t help but sighed when he thought of this.

“Put away the guns.” Lui Wei sighed, then said aloud.

“Chief!” When Zhao Feng heard Lui Wei’s words, his eyes changed and he was about to say something.

“Shut up.” Lui Wei said with an ugly look at Zhao Feng.

Both times today, he caught Lin Xiu by mistake, which made him feel ashamed.

“How about letting me handle this video first?” Lui Wei pointed to the monitor and said.

“Of course.” Lin Xiu nodded, then threw the thing to Lui Wei.

“Let’s go!” Lui Wei glanced at the surrounding soldiers, then said sternly.

The surrounding soldiers all left.

Just as Lin Xiu stopped pointing the spear at Zhao Feng’s head, Zhao Feng got up and looked at Lin Xiu bitterly.

He didn’t expect that Lin Xiu actually had this on hand and Lin Xiu had a one-star medal. This time, the Zhao family had suffered a dumb loss.

“Tsk tsk, so this is the Zhao family, huh. Do you still want to use the federal government to threaten me?” Lin Xiu glanced at Zhao Feng and shook his head in disdain.

After hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Zhao Feng was furious, but he didn’t dare to say anything.

After watching these people leave, Lin Xiu took his mobile phone and thought of the death of his parents, his eyes gradually became gloomy again.

At this time, Lin Xiu rushed to the hotel where Ye Shuang’er and others were staying.

“Luo Yue?” As soon as he walked into the lobby of the hotel, Lin Xiu saw Luo Yue sitting on a chair by the lobby of the hotel.

It was like a beautiful scenery with her sitting there, it looked so pleasing to the eye.

“You are back.” Luo Yue heard Lin Xiu’s voice, then stood up.

“I’m back.” Lin Xiu smiled. For some reason, he felt warm when he heard Luo Yue’s words.

Many guests noticed Luo Yue over there, but Luo Yue’s face was very cold and nobody dared to talk to her.

But Luo Yue was so beautiful. Those men had never seen such a beautiful girl. Even if some people didn’t dare to talk to her, they all sat on the bar next to the hall, pretending to drink, but in fact, they were secretly admiring Luo Yue’s face.

At this time, they noticed that Lin Xiu seemed to know Luo Yue, which aroused envy in many people who saw him.

“Did you change my clothes for me?” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu, then suddenly said.

As soon as Luo Yue’s words were spoken, many men in the hall heard it and they looked like they wanted to tear Lin Xiu apart.

“Ahem…” Lin Xiu was also a bit embarrassed at this time. It was true that he had changed her clothes. At this time, thinking of Luo Yue’s white and tender skin, Lin Xiu subconsciously swallowed.

“I wasn’t thinking about anything.” Lin Xiu said quickly at this time.

The tip of Luo Yue’s ear suddenly became red, but they disappeared quickly and Lin Xiu didn’t notice.

“There is a space crack in Thunder Valley.” Luo Yue said to Lin Xiu faintly at this time.

Lin Xiu, who was a bit embarrassed and didn’t know what to say and was shocked.

“Really?”

Luo Yue took out her cell phone and handed it to Lin Xiu.

The message displayed on the screen of the mobile phone was the website of the Warriors Union with paid information.

This piece of information clearly stated that there were spatial fluctuations in the Thunder Valley and there were quite a few. It seems that the resulting space crack was quite large.

A space crack appeared, possibly accompanied by some foreign objects falling from another space.

And Lin Xiu had originally planned to go to the Thunder Valley, once again using the power of thunder and lightning to train his body.

“Shall we leave tomorrow morning?” Lin Xiu thought for a while and said.

There were super-speed air planes from Bai Di City, but there was only one flight a day and it was in the morning, so they could only wait till tomorrow.

“Yeah.” Luo Yue nodded.

“Go get a room first.”

Lin Xiu thought about it and walked to the front desk.

“Damn it, he’s going to book a romo with the goddess?” The men around the bar in the hall held their glasses so tightly that they were almost breaking.

“Two single rooms.”

But hearing Lin Xiu’s words, these people heaved a sigh of relief.

“Sorry, there are more guests today and now there is only one single room.” The lady at the front desk said with a smile.

“This…”

Lin Xiu was a little helpless. When he was about to say that they should go to the hotel across, Luo Yue stood up and said indifferently, “We’ll take it then.”
