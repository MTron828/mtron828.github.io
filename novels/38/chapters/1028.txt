Soon, with the help of the Angel, Lin Xiu soon arrived at the place where he first landed on Namir Planet.

As he looked at the ruins ahead of him, Lin Xiu slowly moved the rocks with his mind.

All of them rose to the air and disappeared.

That’s when the tunnel to the basement became visible.

Lin Xiu walked into the tunnel.

!!

“You can stay here and wait for me to come back.”

Lin Xiu said to the Angel as he walked into the tunnel.

The Angel was too big for the tunnel and he would not be able to bring the Angel along through the space teleportation device as well.

Angel stood by the tunnel and guarded the place like a guardian of the place.

Lin Xiu quickly headed towards the space teleportation device as soon as he got to the basement.

As he stared at the empty holes on the device, Lin Xiu quickly took out the odd crystals that he had prepared earlier and placed them on the space teleportation device.

Boom boom – –

With the loud noises, the entire space teleportation device started glowing with a bright, white light.

The settings have already been keyed into the device and he only had to activate it.

With the device activated, the entire space was covered with a bright light. By the time Lin Xiu got to see his surroundings clearly once again, he noticed that he was on another planet.

He was back on earth.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu pushed open the door of the device and noticed that he was inside a cave.

“I’m back.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath as he mumbled to himself.

After walking out of the cave that hid the teleportation device, Lin Xiu took a good look around before making sure that he was already back on earth.

Lin Xiu could feel that his body was much lighter than before.

It felt as if he was floating the entire time.

“I’ve been used to the gravity on The Namir Planet and it’s a little uncomfortable here…”

Lin Xiu was heading back as he muttered to himself.

“Who are you?!”

Lin Xiu was about to entire the Luo Mansion when a sword suddenly appeared behind him.

“Luo Yan.”

Lin Xiu didn’t have to turn around to know who it was.

“Lin…..Lin Xiu?”

The person who was standing behind Lin Xiu with a sword in her hand was none other than Luo Yan.

She couldn’t help but widened her eyes in shock when she saw the familiar figure.

“En. I’m back.”

Lin Xiu turned around and smiled.

“Where’s Luo Yue?”

Lin Xiu felt excited as he thought of Luo Yue.

It has been months and Lin Xiu was truly missing her.

Every time he looked at the crescent jade pendant on his neck, he would always think of Luo Yue.

“You bastard! You have finally returned!”

When Luo Yan heard Lin Xiu talking about her sister, she got furious.

Then, she wanted to kick him.

But it was easily dodged by Lin Xiu.

“Luo Yue was taken away from us!”

“Taken away?”

After hearing what Luo Yan said, Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank and his eyes turned cold.

Thunder roared across the sky.

Lin Xiu could no longer control the energy in his body and the ground started shaking.

“What’s…..what’s happening?”

Luo Yan suddenly felt the ground shaking and she was shocked.

“What’s happening?”

Luo Yan’s father walked out of the house as well.

“Lin Xiu, you’re back!”

He was surprised to see Lin Xiu standing in the courtyard.

Huuuuu – –

Lin Xiu took a few deep breaths, trying to calm himself down.

“Uncle, where’s Luo Yue?”

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Zhen and asked for Luo Yue.

“She…”

Luo Zhen was stunned but he still told Lin Xiu everything that happened.

After hearing the incident, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frown.

Warrior God Realm. Where’s that?

“The woman said that she wanted to make Luo Yue her apprentice and become a warrior god?”

Luo Yan added onto the story.

“Do you know how to get to that place?”

Lin Xiu asked Luo Yue’s father about the location.

“The woman is too powerful. She cut open the space and took Luo yue with her.”

Luo Yan looked helpless.

A sage warrior?

A sage warrior that took Luo Yue to meet another person in the Warrior God Realm?

Lin Xiu felt much better after thinking about it.

This was because it meant that the other party meant no harm.

Since it was true that Luo Yue had the physique of a warrior god.

The woman probably admired Luo Yue’s talent and wanted to take her away.

“I will try my best to find her.”

Lin Xiu promised Luo Yan and her father.

“Lin Xiu, how have you been?”

Luo Zhen finally spoke up.

“I’m fine.”

Lin Xiu answered accordingly.

“There shouldn’t be any more of them coming onto earth with the teleportation device.”

As he told them about it, Lin Xiu was suddenly reminded of something and he asked, “By the way, has there been anyone dangerous that suddenly appeared on earth?”

“I don’t think so but weird things have been happening recently.”

Luo Zhen thought about it before telling Lin Xiu.

“Weird things?”

Lin Xiu was stunned.

There seemed to be lots of robots that appeared all over earth.”

Luo Yan was the one who told Lin Xiu about it.

She mentioned that the robots were artificial robots and they aren’t the ones that were seen previously on earth. These were artificial robots that have the consciousness and intelligence of normal human beings.

These robots are the ones that have been banned on earth.

There had been a crisis previously and these robots almost took over the world.

This was why the Federation had stopped the production of these robots.

“There are still robots like these being created?”

Lin Xiu was aware of the ban on these robots which was why he got curious as well.

Not long ago, they found a similar robot in the waters under the Sacred Region Academy.

They were also the ones who broke the space and summoned some of the scariest evolved beasts that they have seen.

“I’m not sure.”

Luo Yan shook her head.

“The government is doing an investigation on it.”

“Hmm…. other than that, has anything else happened?”

Lin Xiu asked once again.

“Nothing special.”

Lin Xiu didn’t stay with the Luo family for long as he quickly headed towards the Sage Region Academy.

It has been a long time since he returned to the academy and he wanted to pay a visit.

His pets, Rollier and Xiao Bai, were still there.

Lin Xiu could now travel freely in the air and with his strength now, he was able to fly at a super fast speed and got to the academy in no time.

“Hmmm?”

When Lin Xiu got to the academy, he couldn’t help but frowned when he saw what was happening.
