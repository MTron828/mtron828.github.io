Although he also expected that Lin Xiu might resist the blow just now.

But he never expected that Lin Xiu could resist it so easily.

And Lin Xiu was holding the White Moon spear in one hand!

Not only was the spear unmoved, but it made his hand feel numb due to the powerful impact.

“It’s my turn.”

The corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up and at the next moment, the White Moon spear in his hand started to dance!

Dang–

A powerful force struck and Liu Tian, who was holding a saber, was directly sent flying.

Before he had time to fight back, Lin Xiu had already stabbed directly with the White Moon spear in his hand!

Whoosh whoosh——

The moment the spear stabbed out, there were loud cracking sounds.

The pupils in Liu Tian’s eyes shrank slightly and the battle in his hand danced crazily, resisting Lin Xiu’s attack.

But the power of Lin Xiu’s spear is too powerful.

The tip of the spear pierced his saber and loud noises erupted one after another.

He felt that his hand holding the saber could no longer hang on!

‘Sphere’!!!

There was no other way. At this moment, Liu Tian already felt that he was going to be unable to hold on anymore!

How can someone from this small city be so powerful!

He roared in his heart.

‘Flood the golden mountain’!!!

Just as Lin Xiu was about to continue attacking, he immediately let out a roar.

Crash——

With the burst of his source strength, at this moment, an incomparably tall water curtain appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

Then, like a pouring flood, it rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu abruptly withdrew the long spear he stabbed and retreated to the back.

Looking at the surging water, the water attribute energy ball on Lin Xiu’s neck instantly lit up.

Stretching out his left hand, in the next moment, the raging flood stopped immediately.

“Hoo hoo…”

Liu Tian, who retreated to the back, was panting. When he just raised his eyes to look forward, he found that the flood that was rushing towards Lin Xiu had stopped immediately!

This is impossible!

This was the first time Liu Tian saw such a situation and his eyes widened.

The purple source mark on his forehead was constantly flashing.

This is his source mark power, why it seems out of control!?

“go!”

And at this time, with Lin Xiu’s wave of his left hand, the flood directly went toward Liu Tian!

Liu Tian’s eyes widened, full of disbelief.

Boom——

In the next moment, the flood directly hit his body.

The speed of these floods is extremely fast and the impact caused by them is also extremely strong.

At this moment, the entire battlefield was shaking crazily.

Crackling——

And at this time, there were strange noises erupting from the flood.

A large amount of electric current appeared in the flood!!!

“What!”

At this time, Liu Tian’s wailing came out.

Originally, he thought that even if the flood hit his body, he would be fine.

But he didn’t expect that there would be an extremely terrifying electric current mixed in the water.

The entire current was transmitted to his body at this time.

And at this time, as the flood disappeared, Lin Xiu’s figure continued to rush over!

Those electric currents not only brought pain to Liu Tian but also paralyzed his body.

At this moment, looking at Lin Xiu who was rushing towards him, he couldn’t dodge anything.

The source strength of the whole body was mobilized and just after the ‘Sphere’ was unfolded, the tip of the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand pierced the ‘Sphere’.

boom–

Liu Tian’s ‘Sphere’ had just unfolded, but at this moment, it was subjected to such a powerful impact that cracks appeared in the entire ‘Sphere’ instantly.

...

Lin Xiu didn’t attack and at this moment he frantically waved the White Moon spear in his hand.

‘Profound intent.Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

With the use of this skill becoming more and more proficient, Lin Xiu can now directly use the profound intent of ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’.

‘Profound Intent·Torrential storm of rose flowers’ was much stronger than the normal ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’.

Whoosh whoosh——

With the sound of piercing through the air, Lin Xiu’s spear stabbed thousands of times at this instant!

Ordinary warriors have no way to react.

You can only use ‘Sphere’ to resist.

And at this moment, Liu Tian didn’t even have the slightest strength to resist.

The spear crazily pierced his ‘Sphere’ and there were extremely loud noises.

The ‘Sphere’ that was cracked by the stab just now completely exploded.

...

Poof——

As soon as the ‘Sphere’ exploded, Liu Tian spat out a mouthful of blood.

“I surrender!!!”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s spearhead stabbing towards his eyebrows, Liu Tianqiang held back the severe pain all over his body and roared loudly.

Blood also splashed out as he roared.

White Moon spear, which was about to stab between his eyebrows, also stopped at this moment.

boom–

At this moment, Liu Tian’s body was limp and kneeling on the ground.

“Are you really… from Lingxian City…”

At this time, he looked at Lin Xiu with eyes full of disbelief.

“Victory!!!”

And Lei Tong, who was watching the live broadcast with special glasses, said excitedly at this moment.

“Now it’s just dealing with these weaker warriors.”

Hearing Lei Tong’s excited voice, Baili Haoling couldn’t help saying.

“The truly powerful ones are yet to come.”

While talking, Baili Haoling took off the live broadcast glasses and looked at the huge screen hanging in the middle.

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu’s number ’99’ is still on, but the opponent’s number dimmed.

“Eh?”

And at this moment, she saw Lin Xiu’s opponent’s number and it changed.

“3400.”

“3400”

“going to challenge a new opponent so soon?”

Lei Tong also took off his glasses at this time and when he saw the numbers displayed on the screen, he couldn’t help saying in surprise.

“En, I just read the rules, you have to win ten games in order to be able to advance.” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Baili Haoling nodded slightly.

“Win ten games in a row?”

Lei Tong couldn’t help but speak out at this time.

And now that Lin Xiu has just finished, he will face the next match immediately.

There is no chance to rest at all.

Unless those warriors are very powerful, ordinary warriors will easily run out of physical strength, then they will have no way to fight against those with sufficient physical strength.

Winning a streak was too difficult.

“Unless Lin Xiu encounters particularly perverted ones, he should be able to win.”

Baili Haoling has confidence in Lin Xiu.

At this time, Lin Xiu had jumped onto the other side of the battle platform.

Although he went directly to the next battle without a break, it was nothing to Lin Xiu.

The battle just now didn’t consume much combat power.

“This time, the opponent is no. 3400 huh…”
