Chapter 175: Kill The Zombies!

One person was holding a long spear while the other was holding a long sword and the two of them rushed in like two shadows!

‘Awe of the phoenix’!!!

The moment Lin Xiu rushed over with his spear, his hands swept across the air.

At this time, a large number of flames began to appear from the bottom of the spear.

Then, he released them directly from the tip of the spear!

The flames instantly turned into huge flaming birds and rushed forward!

As the current ‘Awe of the phoenix’ has become a gold skill, everything in their surroundings seemed to have turned flaming red.

The flames seemed to cut through the sky as they rushed toward those zombies!

Roar——

The zombies roared ferociously as a large number of flaming birds rushed over and formed a tornado of flames, spinning like crazy!!!

The zombies that were attacked by this move got roasted instantly and their entire bodies became black and they shattered.

“Congratulations Master on killing rank 4 zombies. You’ve gained 100,000 experience points.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Congratulations Master…”

Many system prompts rang out, but Lin Xiu ignored them and continued to rush over.

“Amazing… such amazing skill…” Zhang Yin and the others stared and looked a little dumbfounded.

Lin Xiu’s ‘Awe of the phoenix’ wiped out about ten zombies in an instant, and the lingering flames also injured the surrounding zombies.

“Let’s go fight too! If you’re so fearful, you might as well not come!!!” Zhang Yin held the weapon in his hand and did not continue escaping, but attacked the zombies and rushed over instead!

Jiang Li gritted his teeth and followed behind Zhang Yin as he leaped up and used the ‘Landslide Strike’ to split a zombie in half from top to bottom!

“You guys are insane..:” Li Ping saw this scene and the shadow in his heart seemed to emerge again.

Even the weapon he was holding began to tremble slightly at this time.

What was he going to do?

“I won’t lose to you guys either!!!”

After hesitating for a while, Li Ping yelled, and attacked the surrounding zombies violently!

Luo Yue had no expression on her face, but her hands were moving very quickly.

Every time she waved her long sword, she chopped a zombie into two.

Her long sword was not an ordinary weapon and with her own strength, killing these zombies was like cutting tofu.

Lin Xiu was also holding the Dark Edge spear tightly and thrusting it like crazy!

These zombies were really disgusting and as long as their heads were not pierced through, they could still continue to attack.

It was as if they were immortals.

“I’m doomed!” Meanwhile, after Zhang Yin killed a zombie, he turned around and suddenly saw another zombie with its mouth wide open, revealing its horrifying fangs. It was about to bite and tear him apart!

At this critical moment, Zhang Yin suddenly saw a series of cold lights flashing in front of him, and the zombie that was about to pounce on him suddenly had more than 20 holes on its body.

Thud——

With a dull sound, the zombie fell to the ground.

“Be careful.” Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief when he saw that the zombie was severely stabbed by him and died.

“Thank you.” Zhang Yin patted his chest. He was almost bitten by the zombie just now.

Not long after, the zombies had been wiped out by Lin Xiu and the rest.

Lin Xiu probably killed more than 30 of them and gained more than three million experience points in total.

But it takes 200 million experience points to level up so this was simply a drop in the bucket.

Luo Yue also killed dozens of them and there was still a lot of blood on her long sword. As she swung the sword with force, all the blood was splashed on the ground.

“If we killed people using a weapon that has been used to kill zombies, it would probably cause them to be infected, huh.” Jiang Li looked at the blood on his machete at this time and said subconsciously.

The blood on the machete still exuded a foul smell that gave people goosebumps.

“Those viruses only can survive for five seconds after being exposed in the air.” Luo Yue said plainly.

“That’s good.” Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Zhang Yin also heaved a sigh of relief. If he encountered some malicious warriors and accidentally got injured, he was really afraid that he would be infected if he came into contact with those blood.

“Go to hell! Go to hell!!!” At the same time, Li Ping seemed to have been too engrossed in killing and was slashing frantically at the corpse of a zombie on the ground.

The zombie was already completely dead and under Li Ping’s frenzied slashing, it looked like mud at this moment.

“It’s dead.” Lin Xiu stood beside him at this time, then patted him on the shoulder and said.

“Ah!” When Lin Xiu patted his shoulder, Li Ping roared and turned around to attack Lin Xiu.

Bang——

Lin Xiu grabbed him by the wrist and shouted sternly, “Li Ping!”

“Class… class monitor?” The crazy look in Li Ping’s eyes disappeared and he returned to normal.

He looked around and saw the corpses of zombies everywhere, and the blood seemed to stain the whole ground red.

“It’s okay,” Lin Xiu said lightly.

Coming here probably evoked the terrifying memory in his heart, but if he managed to survive, he should be fine.

“The zombies that these warriors mutated into are really terrifying.” Jiang Li also had a lingering fear in his eyes at this moment.

If Lin Xiu and Luo Yue didn’t take on most of the firepower, they would be in trouble for sure.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu looked around and found that no zombies had appeared.

His main goal this time was to hunt for evolved beasts, but there weren’t any evolved beasts appearing. Instead, they killed dozens of zombies.

Although the strength of these warrior zombies was terrifying, they had no intellect, after all. As long as they were careful, it wasn’t too difficult to deal with them.

The architectural style of this city was from thirty years ago. The surrounding buildings were corroded, the walls were ragged, and there were a lot of black marks.

The air quality was very bad, there was always a choking smell.

“Strange, why haven’t we seen any evolved beasts yet?”
