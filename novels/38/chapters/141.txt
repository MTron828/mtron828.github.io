Chapter 142: We Are Also Freshmen

Luo Yue held the long sword that was as thin as cicada’s wings as she stared coldly at Kong Haotian and the others.

“Rank 4 warrior!?” At this moment, a guy covered his eyes with source strength and could clearly see the long sword covered with a light green source strength.

He was shocked to see this.

“Hng, so what!” Kong Haotian was slightly afraid at this moment but still gritted his teeth and said.

She was a rank 4 warrior, after all, and the gap between and a rank 3 warrior and a rank 4 warrior could be said to be poles apart.

“But she’s hurt.” One man noticed that Luo Yue’s shoulder pads had been split in half and there were traces of medicinal powder.

“Oh?” Hearing the man’s words, Kong Haotian raised his brows.

From the first time he saw Luo Yue, he felt an itch in his heart, he had never seen such a beautiful woman with such disposition.

In today’s world, getting cosmetic surgery was easy, but it couldn’t give a person class.

“You guys know the Black Tiger Bandits?” Lin Xiu looked at them and asked indifferently.

They froze when they heard Lin Xiu’s words. Of course, they knew that the Black Tiger Bandits were a C-grade criminal group on the borders of the Path of Death.

“So what? They’re just a hundred over people and they don’t have many rank 3 warriors – did you think I will be afraid?” Kong Haotian said with a cold smile at this time.

He thought Lin Xiu brought up the Black Tiger Bandits to intimidate him.

“No.” Lin Xiu shook his head, then continued to say, “They were all killed by us.”

Killed!?

The moment Lin Xiu said that, they gasped.

The Black Tiger Bandits had at least a hundred people and there were about five powerful rank 3 warriors.

Even they didn’t dare to provoke them.

“Do you think I’ll believe you?” Kong Haotian was shocked, but he still said with a smile.

“You want to give it a go?” Lin Xiu raised his brows.

“Sure!” Kong Haotian was annoyed when he saw the look of arrogance on Lin Xiu’s face then with the sword in hand, he charged toward Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and moved slightly, dodging him immediately.

Although Lin Xiu was still carrying a spear box and a backpack, this did not affect his speed.

Rollie seemed to sense danger at this moment too and it hugged itself with its little arms, then jumped into Lin Xiu’s bag.

Kong Haotian was shocked when he saw that Lin Xiu had dodged his sword.

He thought that Lin Xiu was a very weak warrior and wasn’t his match at all, he was also confident that he could kill Lin Xiu with one blow.

But he did not think that Lin Xiu, who looked very clumsy carrying so many things, was as light as a swallow and dodged his sword.

Lin Xiu glanced at him and after dodging a couple of his attacks, Lin Xiu threw a punch over!

Bang——

The punch hit him directly in the shoulder and the sheer impact made him take a few steps back.

Had it not been for his combat suit, his shoulder bone would have been broken.

“Courting death!!!” The people behind were shocked when they saw this and one of the guys charged towards Lin Xiu with a weapon.

But just then, there was a cold blade on his neck.

A tingling sensation came from his neck and he didn’t dare to move at all.

“Move again or say a word and I will kill you, I’ll kill you if you look at me too.” Luo Yue stood at the same spot and said plainly.

The man tensed up and the skin around his neck was slowly dripping with blood.

The fear of death made him afraid to move.

“Let him go!!!” The remaining people yelled when they saw this.

“Three seconds, leave or fight.” Lin Xiu put up three fingers and said indifferently.

Kong Haotian covered his wounds at this moment and stared at Lin Xiu as he gritted his teeth.

He was in a very disadvantageous situation right now and Lin Xiu had clearly concealed his strength, there was also a rank 4 warrior around, and if he continued fighting…

“Let’s go!!!” Kong Haotian said reluctantly.

Luo Yue put the long sword down from his neck and shed the blood off her blade with a forceful wave.

Kong Haotian glared at Lin Xiu and led the four people and left.

The man who had a sword to his neck seemed to be immersed in his near-death experience and didn’t dare to look back at all.

“Thank you, Senior!” Zhang Yin heaved a sigh of relief. They had just become rank 3 warriors and weren’t very strong.

If they didn’t meet Lin Xiu, it would have been over for them.

“And thank you…” Zhang Yin looked at Luo Yue, but Luo Yue’s eyes were cold, she didn’t look at them and they were a little embarrassed.

“Don’t call me Senior, just call me Lin Xiu.” Lin Xiu found it very awkward.

“Okay, Senior.” Zhang Yin nodded, making Lin Xiu somewhat speechless.

“How are your injuries? Are you all right?” At this moment, Lin Xiu obviously saw Luo Yue frowning and it was clear that the move just now had hurt her wounds.

Luo Yue shook her head.

Lin Xiu also knew her character and didn’t say much.

“Are you guys students of the Sacred region academy?” Lin Xiu heard what they said just now and was quite surprised. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“En, we’re freshmen, but the address is at the end of the Path of death and we’ve never gone there before.” Zhang Yin said with a wry smile at this time.

“And that person called Kong Haotian is an elite from another school in our city but he’s very violent.”

Not just violent, he nearly killed Zhang Yin ah.

He couldn’t help but felt a slight lingering fear when he thought about it.

“Senior, where are you guys going?” Zhang Yin asked.

“The Sacred region academy too.” Lin Xiu said.

“Are you a teacher at the Sacred region academy?” Zhang Yin and the others were surprised.

“We’re freshmen, too.”

“What?” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Zhang Yin and the others were dumbfounded, especially Zhang Yin. He always believed that Lin Xiu was an expert and might be older than most of them.

But he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu was also a freshman.

Looking closely at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, both of them seemed to be only 17 or 18 years old.

They’re so powerful at such a young age? It’s unbelievable!
