Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Those warriors who rushed over died in an instant.

Seeing this scene, Chen Jing’s expression changed greatly.

What exactly is going on!

He looked up at Lin Xiu and he could clearly see that Lin Xiu’s body was covered with a large amount of dark energy.

There is no doubt that everything just now was done by Lin Xiu.

The power of this kid… how can he be so strong!?

“Who the hell are you!”

At this moment, Chen Jing stared at Lin Xiu and said angrily.

Just now, Lin Xiu used this strange power to instantly kill more than 30 warriors from his Chen family.

Those warriors are all at the Respected warrior level!

They were the backbone of their Chen family.

All of them died instantly.

“It’s okay to betray your faith, but you hand over Ye Kai and the others to the Bai family, that’s not right.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Humph! You garbarge, do you really think you can overthrow the Bai family?”

Chen Jing snorted coldly at this moment and when he moved his right hand, a long sword flew from the ground into his hand.

swoosh—

Holding the long sword, he directly slashed into the air.

With the swooshing in the air, a sword aura burst out immediately and charged towards him!

Lin Xiu saw this scene in his eyes and showed a mocking smile.

With a flick of his finger, the sword aura was directly annihilated.

When Chen Jing saw this scene, his eyes widened.

Just annihilating your sword aura?!

Chen Jing’s expression changed at this time.

Looking at Ye Kai on the other side, a savage expression appeared on his face.

In a flash, he disappeared in place.

The moment it appeared again, it appeared in front of Ye Kai!

Holding the long sword in his hand, he slashed directly at Ye Kai!

Because Lin Xiu’s displayed strength is really too powerful, now he can only kill Ye Kai first. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Ye Kai looked at Chen Jing who suddenly appeared in front of him and instinctively wanted to block with the sword in his hand.

Dang–

But the moment Ye Kai resisted with his weapon, the weapon in his hand was shot straight away!

Go to hell!

The long sword in Chen Jing’s hand was about to pierce Ye Kai’s heart.

But at this moment, out of the corner of Chen Jing’s eyes, he saw a cold light stabbing towards him!

The pupils in Chen Jing’s eyes shrank slightly. He was about to stab out with the long sword, but at this moment, he directly held the long sword in his hand and blocked it from behind.

Dang–

With a crisp sound, in the next moment, the long sword in his hand was knocked out.

Lin Xiu, it was Lin Xiu who attacked with a spear from behind.

At this time, Ye Kai also reacted quickly and retreated to the back.

“you…”

Chen Jing didn’t expect Lin Xiu to attack so quickly and the expression on his face changed slightly.

At this moment, Lin Xiu continued to hold the Dark Edge spear in his hand and continued to attack Chen Jing!

“Get lost!”

Chen Jing’s face changed greatly and when he moved his hands, the soil on the ground surged instantly.

Then a wall was formed, blocking the front.

boom–

But at this time, Lin Xiu directly slashed and smashed the wall.

The spear stabbed Chen Jing’s ‘Sphere’ in the next moment!

Boom—

The huge impact force made Chen Jing’s body fly straight out!

He hit a huge boulder behind it heavily.

pfft—

In the next moment, a mouthful of blood spit out from Chen Jing’s mouth.

“Master!”

At this time, the warriors of the Chen family all gathered towards Chen Jing.

“Get away from me!”

Chen Jing directly pushed away the warriors who wanted to help him get up, then wiped the blood flowing from his mouth.

And at this moment, a lot of light flickered in the entire sky.

what is this?!

Lin Xiu, who originally wanted to continue attacking the past, frowned slightly when he saw this scene.

Taking a closer look, he saw that some aircraft were flying over.

There were also a large number of warriors on the aircraft.

“Hahaha, you are dead meat!!!”

When Chen Jing saw this scene at this time, he suddenly burst into laughter.

“People from the Bai family.”

Ye Kai, who was standing on Lin Xiu’s side, looked at the aircraft at this time and his face became ugly.

At this time, a large number of warriors in white uniforms jumped down from the aircraft.

These were all warriors of the Bai family.

“Elder Bai, it’s him!”

“This person is the remnant of the Ye family!”

Chen Jing looked at the warrior who jumped down first and immediately pointed at Lin Xiu and shouted loudly.

The warrior jumped to Chen Jing’s side at this time and looked up at Lin Xiu and Ye Kai.

“He killed my Bai family and escaped.”

He glanced at Lin Xiu and Ye Kai and said coldly.

Undoubtedly, what he was talking about was the Bai family warriors who were killed in the inner courtyard of the Bai family when Lin Xiu rescued Ye Kai.

“Boy, can’t you imagine that from the very beginning, you’ve already been a turtle in the jar (trapped)!”

Chen Jing also said coldly at this time.

“It seems that I’ll have a lot of experience tonight.”

Lin Xiu and Ye Kai were surrounded by many Bai family warriors, not only did he not have any fear in his eyes, but he was a little excited.

Because of killing these warriors, he would be able to gain a lot of experience.

“The Ye family, the so-called big family, has long since perished.”

The warrior known as Elder Bai approached at this time and said coldly to Lin Xiu.

“Still trying to restore it huh.”

“It’s a fool’s dream.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

“The Bai family only brought so many warriors, I’m afraid it’s not enough.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Crazy! Your won’t even know how you died later!”

When Chen Jing heard Lin Xiu’s words, he immediately shouted.

With the arrival of the Bai family’s warriors, it seemed that Chen Jing’s nervousness just now was relieved.

He was really afraid that he would be killed by Lin Xiu.

After all, the strength that Lin Xiu showed was simply too powerful.

“Elder Bai, he has the token of the Ye family in his hand.”

Chen Jing spoke to him at this time.

“Imperial token?”

Elder Bai clearly knew something and the pupils in his eyes also shrank slightly at this time.

That thing was ‘key’ to open that place…

“Hand it over.”

Elder Bai stared at Lin Xiu at this time and said lightly.

There was murderous intent in his eyes.

Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly. Through the Analytic Eye, this time, there were a total of five Sage warriors from the Bai family.

There were also many warriors of the Respected warrior level.

And the power of this Elder Bai is considered very powerful among the Sage warriors.

With this kind of strength, ordinary warriors can only wait for death.

Unluckily for them, the person they were against was Lin Xiu.
