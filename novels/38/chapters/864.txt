Chapter 865: Warrior Union Headquarters (2)

“Of course, the defense of your Warrior Union headquarters is so weak, why don’t I dare to come over?”

Lin Xiu said with a faint smile. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“How dare you!”

One of the warriors sitting at the round table, with a wave of his right hand, a flame of fire directly charged toward Lin Xiu!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he immediately raised his brows, then with a wave of his right hand, the knife in his hand flew out.

The moment the knife hit the flame, the flame instantly dissipated!

The pupils in the warrior’s eyes shrank abruptly and he subconsciously used ‘Sphere’.

But even though his speed was already very fast, a hole appeared on his ‘Sphere’ directly.

When he looked to the front, he could clearly see that a hole had been pierced through his head.

There is also a small hole in the wall behind him.

The knife that flew out directly pierced through the area behind.

“Golden steel!”

When the general leader of the Warrior Union saw this scene, his eyes widened.

This warrior with the most powerful physical defense actually died just like that!

Killed by a knife!

“Why, you all want to die too?”

Seeing that the others were about to make a move, Lin Xiu said lightly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words and the terrifying power Lin Xiu used just now, they were all shocked.

At this time, they all used ‘Sphere’ subconsciously.

Everyone looked on guard.

Although Lin Xiu was calm and taking it easy just now, he actually killed one of their high-level officials.

Moreover, that official was also a super warrior who specializes in physical strength!

“Boy, if you dare to enter our warrior Union to do this kind of thing, you are doomed!”

The general leader of the Warrior Union looked at Lin Xiu at this time and said with a gloomy expression.

Although he didn’t know how Lin Xiu suddenly killed Jin Gang, he still spoke out instinctively.

“You guys talk a lot.”

Hearing his repeated threatening words, Lin Xiu became a little impatient.

With a wave of his right hand, the terrifying source of strength burst out.

Boom—

With a loud noise, the high-rise building seemed to vibrate violently.

The glass was all shattered and a large number of cracks appeared on the surrounding ground and walls.

Those warriors felt the blood surge and in the next moment, they spit out a mouthful of blood.

And the ‘Sphere’ they unfolded has a lot of cracks at this moment.

pata pata——

With a crisp sound, all their ‘Spheres’ burst directly.

Because of the explosion of the ‘Sphere’, they seemed to have suffered some kind of backlash and vomited out a mouthful of blood again.

Their bodies were shaky and they sat weakly on the chairs.

“Now, do you know how weak you guys are?”

Lin Xiu glanced at them, then said lightly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, these people’s faces no longer had the vicious look on their faces, instead, they were shocked.

Extremely shocked.

Lin Xiu, with just a wave of his hand, shattered all their ‘Spheres’.

With such terrifying power, what kind of warrior can achieve such terrifying power?

At least, it is absolutely impossible for a rank 9 warrior.

“You... who are you?”

The general leader of the Warrior Union, covering his chest at this time, looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.
