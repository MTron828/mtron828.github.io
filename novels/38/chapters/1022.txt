Chapter 1023: The Triple Sourcemark Technique

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Of course.”

Wu Hao was a little caught off guard when he heard Lin Xiu talking to him but he still nodded his head.

The Wu Corporation was also one of the strongest in Tianjiao City.

“Master. Are you leaving now?”

Wang Qiang sensed something different as he looked at Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

He only hid in this city because he was hurt from the battle.

Then, he heard that the sage warrior would make him one which was why he stayed.

Since he was already a sage warrior now and he got his hands on the information for the Orchid of Heaven, it’s time for him to get to the place where the flower could be found.

“Work hard. We will be soon.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

Before Wang Qiang had the time to answer him, Lin Xiu leaped and landed on the Angel’s shoulder.

The eyes of the Angel lit up brightly with a purple light and her wings started flapping.

The huge wings blew up a strong breeze.

“Goodbye, everyone.”

Lin Xiu smiled. He looked at the rest of them on the ground and soon disappeared with the Angel.

“Master, I will not disappoint you.”

When Lin Xiu left, Wang Qing clenched onto his fist and made a promise to himself.

“Thank you.”

Wu Hao stared at the direction where Lin Xiu left and held onto the box that contained the Angel’s Tears.

He had finally found the Angel’s Tears after all these years.

When he thought of how his wife may be awakening soon, his eyes turned red.

Huuuuu – –

Lin Xiu was flying across the sky with the Angel.

There was still some time before they would reach Wildfire City which was why he took out a mini computer.

He clicked onto it and there was a projection that appeared.

“The Ancestral Star…”

Lin Xiu raised his brows when he read through the information given by Duan Zheyan.

Sun Jian, the man that he had just killed, was from the Ancestral Star.

The Ancestral Star was the name of a planet.

It was a small planet, located on the other end of the Namir Planet.

Although it was small, it had everything that was necessary.

The people from the Ancestral Stars looked a little different from normal human beings and the energy that they had was different as well.

All of them had the energy of darkness.

The most surprising thing was it would not be enough to kill them by just destroying their physical body.

This is because they can live in the form of a mass substance and get attached onto another living thing.

“This is weird.”

Lin Xiu was surprised as well as he read through the information from the document.

There was one thing that all of them had in common which was revenge.

If one of them got killed, the rest of them from the planet would take revenge for their comrades until the day they die.

The energy from the Ancestral Planet was exhausted years ago and has been destroyed.

The rest of them had escaped to Namir Planet.

Most of them from the Namir Planet would choose not to mess with those from the Ancestral Star.

This was because after killing one, the consequences would be the fury of the entire clan from the Ancestral Star.

When Lin Xiu read this part, it didn’t bother him.

If they wanted to kill him, they could but he could kill all of them first.

As he thought about it, Lin Xiu had a cold glare in his eyes.

“Oh!”

Suddenly, Lin Xiu thought of the box that Ji Mei passed to him earlier and he quickly took it out from the expansion space.

It was a flat box.

Lin Xiu had no idea what was inside it.

When he opened the box, there was a card placed in it.

“Triple Sourcemark Technique.”

Seeing the writings carved on the card, Lin Xiu was stunned.

It looked like some unique technique.

“This should be used like a normal warrior skills card…”

As he took a good look at the special card in front of him, he muttered to himself.

Then, Lin Xiu gently placed the card on his forehead.

He gathered his energy onto his forehead and soon the card was glowing brightly.

A large amount of information rushed into Lin Xiu’s mind.

As the news was slowly being accepted into his brain, Lin Xiu slowly opened his eyes.

“Such a mysterious skill…”

Lin Xiu continued talking to himself as he was surprised by what he had just learnt.

This was because the ‘Triple Sourcemark Technique’ would allow him to take in another 2 new source marks.

In addition to the one that he already had, he would have three in total!

These sourcemarks were practical things as they would elevate his warrior skills.

Lin Xiu didn’t think that Ji Mei would give him something this priceless.

Lin Xiu quickly took a deep breath and started cultivating according to the instructions given.

Soon, there was a large amount of energy that rushed towards his head and there was a golden mark that appeared on his forehead.

The golden light slowly turned into a sourcemark.

A golden sourcemark.

This was not the end. The golden sourcemark suddenly liquified and disappeared from Lin Xiu’s forehead.

Then, another bright purple light appeared and formed a new source mark once again.

Those who are below the level of a sage warrior, they would only get one sourcemaker with this skill but as a sage warrior, he would be able to get 3.

This was how he had 3 source marks in total now.

“They have the elements of ice and fire…”

Lin Xiu continued muttering to himself.

As a sage warrior, it was a piece of cake to cultivate a new sourcemark.

Getting one each from the element of ice and fire was already something within his expectations.

However, being able to use the strength of all three was a huge surprise for Lin Xiu.

With the Angel flying in the sky, Lin Xiu soon returned to Wildfire City and was above the poor regions of the Dark Shadow Team.

Wung wung wung – –

As there was a weird sound all around him, Lin Xiu suddenly noticed that there were drones everywhere. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

All of them were surrounding him and the Angel.

“Who are you?! How dare you fly across Wildfire city?!”

There were warriors on the drones and they were questioning Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu looked at them and noticed that they were dressed in both blsck and white combat suits.

Lin Xiu was familiar with these combat suits.

They were those from the Black and White Troops.
