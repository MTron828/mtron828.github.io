Chapter 73: The Final Match Begins!

Not only was there a large amount of information on the Warrior Union website, but there were also online shopping stores that sold a variety of weapons.

Lin Xiu entered the weapons store and clicked on the spear-type weapons, where there were many images of weapons.

“‘Black Demon’- made with foreign black brilliant stone, extremely sharp, price: 130 million.”

“‘Overlord’…”

Looking at these spears, Lin Xiu could feel their beauty and power just by looking at the images, but the exorbitant prices made him speechless.

He finally found one that was of a suitable price, but when he clicked to purchase it, a notification popped up asking him to log in.

Lin Xiu smacked his head at this moment and suddenly remembered that he hadn’t obtained the warrior certification yet.

He shook his head helplessly and found the column to register for the exam. When he read the information inside, it just happened that there was a warrior qualification trial next month.

Without hesitation, Lin Xiu directly entered his information and registered for it.

As long as he got a warrior certification, everything would be very convenient.

Lin Xiu did not practice anything that night and simply sat cross-legged to absorb source strength.

The body is like a container and as it reaches its limit of storage, the container will begin to grow larger and gradually be able to store more source strength in the future.

While Lin Xiu was resting, Tang Tian was still practicing his skill in the Tang Family’s courtyard.

There were many screens around and the screen was playing a scene of every match that Lin Xiu fought.

This time, he did not want to make any mistakes and wanted to kill Lin Xiu!

“Young master, I’ve bought all the skill cards you needed.” Just then, a man came in with a silver box and opened it directly in front of Tang Tian.

There were all sorts of skill cards lined neatly in this box and were all emitting a dazzling white glow.

Tang Tian took a glance, and a cold smile appeared in the corners of his mouth.

‘Lin Xiu, I have a way of dealing with all your skills, let’s see how you’re going to fight against me!’

Time flew by and it was the next day.

Anyone who understood the end-of-term matches knew that those who were in the top few places would have a chance to qualify for the top five prestigious colleges.

So every student who entered the top 12 was bursting with energy, after all, if they got into the top five colleges, most of them would be successful in the future.

And it was now the finals, nobody wanted to lose. It could be said that the finals would definitely be a fierce struggle and extremely exciting.

At this moment, the place was filled with a large number of students and there wasn’t a single empty seat!

Those without seats simply stood under the arena.

Although they couldn’t take part in the battle, they could take the chance to watch the experts fight and it would still be very beneficial for them.

“Hahaha, I didn’t expect that Tang Tian is going to fight against that student in your class again.” On the seats at the back, the teacher in charge of Class 2 said to Luo Li with a smile.

He knew how strong Tang Tian was this time and would definitely defeat Lin Xiu. Also, he could wash away the humiliation of being defeated by a student of Class 29.

“It’s hard to say.” Luo Li scoffed coldly.

Liu Bai shook his head and did not say much. It was even possible for Tang Tian to take first place with his current strength.

“Lin Xiu!” Luo Li, who was at his seat at first, walked over to Lin Xiu immediately when he saw Lin Xiu coming.

“Teacher Luo,” Lin Xiu was slightly surprised to see Luo Li coming over.

Luo Li nodded, looked a little stern, and said, “Be careful when you deal with Tang Tian later, he’s not easy to deal with.”

When Tang Tian came over previously, Luo Li had secretly observed him. He knew that Tang Tian’s strength was unfathomable, even he himself was a little shocked.

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu nodded.

There was a huge match table in front of the field and he could see that he would be up against Tang Tian during the third match.

“Lin Xiu, do your best. Trample on Tang Tian once again in this place!” Yang Tian waved his fist at this moment and said out loud.

“You want to beat my older brother? Dream on!” At this moment, a cold voice sounded.

Tang Ping appeared out of nowhere and had a group of lackeys following behind him as he laughed coldly.

“Whether I can defeat him or not, we’ll find out after the match.” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said coldly.

He didn’t have much to say to him and simply sat in the front seats prepared for the 12 students taking part in the match.

Bai Lichang, the top student on the combat strength list, was the first to go up. He was said to be a rank 2 warrior already and his weapon was a sword.

Long Potian, ranked 2nd in the combat strength list, was up against him, and his weapon was a saber.

The moment the match started, there was a sudden uproar all around, and everyone was very excited.

After all, they were the top two students on the combat strength list and it was rare to even see them.

Lin Xiu looked at the stage at this moment as well. The strength of these two people could be said to nearly reach the level of a rank 3 warrior already. Their fight was very exciting and the usage of skills was extremely magnificent and powerful too.

But there were good protective measures done around the stage, so they didn’t have to worry about hurting those students below the stage. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Bai Lichang, I lost to you previously, I’ll definitely win this time!” Long Potian yelled and charged toward Bai Lichang with his saber.

But Bai Lichang was calm and blocked Long Potian’s attack with his sword swiftly.

The battle between the two guys did not last long, and soon the results were out. In the end, Bai Lichang was more skilled and was victorious in the first match.

That was when Lin Xiu began to close his eyes.

“Hng, it looks like he’s scared now.” Tang Ping, who was sitting at the seat behind, saw Lin Xiu’s appearance and sneered coldly.

Tang Mubai turned his gaze toward that direction as well.

Lin Xiu actually came back alive from Guang Ming Fort and became a lot stronger which was quite surprising. But Tang Mubai still believed that Tang Tian would definitely win this time.

It didn’t matter if Lin Xiu was killed, after all, he was just an ordinary student. By then, he could just pull strings to settle the matter.

Soon, the second match was also over and the loudspeaker suddenly sounded: “Third match, no. 1024 Lin Xiu against the no. 85 Tang Tian!”

The moment the announcement was made, the entire place was in an uproar. This was even more exciting than the match between the top two students in the combat strength list.

Last time, Lin Xiu defeated Tang Tian here. This time, would the result be the same?
