“I actually leveled up?” Lin Xiu was startled but felt that it was right after thinking about it. As he absorbed source energy continuously, the experience he had gained was more and more. From the original 100 experience points per hour, it swelled up to a few hundred per hour. It far exceeded Lin Xiu’s expectations.

Lin Xiu quickly brought up his stats board:

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: Level 11

Experience: 65 (220108 experience required for the next level)

Strength: 78

Physique: 50

Speed: 52

(Note: Ordinary individuals have values above 38)

Skill: Analytic Eye, Fury

Rage build-up: 0/100

Overall Combat Strength: 699

Remaining Potential Points: 11

11 Potential Points? Where do I add them to? Upon thinking about it, Lin Xiu added 10 points into Physique and the last point into strength.

Very quickly, Lin Xiu felt his body loosen up, the burden on his body was no longer as intense.

He continued down the board: Progress 9504/10000

“Still not enough?”! Seeing the numbers made Lin Xiu want to cry. Although he was getting used to the burden, Lin Xiu felt terrible under the stress.

It seemed that he had to fight with less than 70% of his original strength.

But he had no other choice, the martial arts battle was in the night and he could no longer continue his high-intensity training.

He had to rest.

He returned to the dorm and applied the remaining medicine to his body. Lin Xiu felt all the wounds from training Rupturing Fist recover at an astonishing rate.

He sat down cross-legged and began absorbing source energy.

After being proficient in the cultivation technique, he was capable of activating and absorbing source energy in his sleep, but the effectiveness was much slower.

“Martial arts battle. The martial arts battle is about to begin!”

The night was bound to be rowdy and filled with excitement. A large number of students had gathered at the martial arts hall with all the seats filled up.

Many were excited about the upcoming battle. Trash vs genius!

“When was the last martial arts battle, a year ago?” An old man with a long white beard sat at the front table and smiled.

“Yes, Mr. Ye.” Luo Li nodded and replied from the side.

They were seated at the judges’ panel. Aside from the man called Mr. Ye in the center, the other two were the respective teachers-in-charge.

“Luo Li, I will get Tang Tian to be merciful and not threaten Lin Xiu’s life.” Tang Tian’s teacher, also Class 2 teacher-in-charge, Liu Bai, smiled and said.

A trash challenging his excellent student to a martial arts battle, wasn’t that seeking death?

“Winner and loser haven’t been decided.” Luo Li snorted.

“Luo Li, you are still as stubborn as ever.” Liu Bai smiled and shook his head. In his eyes, the battle had been determined.

“The battle is about to begin, may both competitors go up the stage!” Speakers in the middle called out the announcement that reached every corner of the hall. Two figures standing at opposite ends moved towards the center stage.

Lin Xiu was dressed in loose white robes with a silver spear in hand. Matched with his handsome face, he gave off a suave aura.

“That is your big brother Lin Xiu, he is so handsome…” Ye Shuang’er had found a good spot with two bosom friends at her side that complimented Lin Xiu.

“Of course!” Ye Shuang’er replied happily when she heard their compliments.

But upon thinking about Lin Xiu’s martial arts battle, her heart tensed up again. She only found out that the martial arts battle was extremely dangerous after that day.

‘You cannot get hurt…’

Ye Shuang’er clenched both fists and muttered under her breath as she looked at the figure on stage.

Tang Tian stood at the other hand with a long sword and a cold glint in his eyes.

He could clearly sense that Lin Xiu had gotten stronger. What exactly happened?

Was it from all that foolish running from day to night?

“Do your best, Lin Xiu!!” Yang Tian stood from his seat and shouted, although Lin Xiu could not hear anything from his position.

The majority of Class 29 students were there, and they clenched their fists as they looked at Lin Xiu.

“Lin Xiu, you cannot lose.” Zhang Yi muttered with a dark expression as he gazed at Lin Xiu’s figure on stage.

Although he was at odds against Lin Xiu initially, Lin Xiu’s battle would reflect on the class honor.

Xin Yao Academy’s class was ranked based on results. In theory, Class 1 overall strength was the strongest while Class 29 was the weakest.

“Alright, students. The very first martial arts battle for the year is about to begin!”

“On the one hand, we have Lin Xiu from Class 29, and on the other hand, we have Tang Tian from Class 2!”

Right at this time, Mr. Ye, who was seated at the judges’ panel, shouted into the microphone which reverberated throughout the entire hall.

“Tang Tian! Tang Tian!” Following Mr. Ye’s announcement, the majority of spectators cried out for Tang Tian’s name.

Although Tang Tian was ranked in the 100s, every one of them was hailed as a genius and was extremely popular in school.

On the contrary, Lin Xiu received many ridicules from the crowd.

“Lin Xiu! Lin Xiu!” Ye Shuang’er and her friends screamed loudly.

But their support was quickly overwhelmed by the others.

The clock struck 8 and Mr. Ye waved his hands before speaking, “The time is on the dot, both parties get ready, the first to admit defeat will end the competition!”

“Are you ready to kneel and admit defeat, or be killed by me?” Tang Tian spoke to Lin Xiu coldly.

“Even when you are admitting defeat later, I won’t stop.” Lin Xiu replied indifferently.

“Seeking death!” Tang Tian’s face changed as he charged straight for Lin Xiu!

The sword was unleashed with a cold glint as it thrust toward Lin Xiu’s neck!

“Bronze skill – Bloodthirst, throat sealing!”

“Who would have thought that Tang Tian was the first to strike and with a killing technique!” A few students cried out in shock.

‘Bloodthirst, throat sealing’ was extremely fast and was capable of killing even before the opponent could react.

Ye Shuang’er gasped when she saw the move and her heart moved to her throat.

“Clang.”

Right in that instant, Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted as the Silver Immortal Soul in his hand moved. The sharp tip blocked the sharp end of the sword and produced a metallic sound as sparks were ignited from the collision.
