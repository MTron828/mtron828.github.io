Chapter 313: Luo Yue!

Hua Tian’s eyes saw this scene then he rushed towards Qian Ma and wanted to pull Lin Xiu’s body back.

But at this moment, the two warriors who had just fought with Lin Xiu directly attacked Hua Tian with their own weapons.

Dang dang dang——

Hua Tian saw this scene, his expression suddenly changed and he attacked with the weapon in his hand.

Lin Xiu had fallen directly into the lake!

Some warriors saw Lin Xiu falling and they all showed a scornful smile.

From their point of view, a low-ranking warrior like Lin Xiu coming here to snatch the Ice lotus fire was simply courting death!

There were no ice crystal white birds flying up anymore and Lin Xiu had also plunged into the lake.

These men all looked at Lin Xiu like they wanted to watch if those lakes would simply burn Lin Xiu.

But what surprised them was that Lin Xiu’s body sank directly into it and it seemed that nothing happened.

What exactly is going on!?

Gurgle gurgle——

Lin Xiu’s body kept sinking.

The Fire scale combat suit on his body seemed to become fiery red instantly because of the fire.

It was emitting a red glow.

As Lin Xiu sunk, he had instinctively activated the ‘Fury’ skill and burst out with source strength, allowing the source strength to surround his body.

But Lin Xiu still clearly felt that even with his own strong source strength wrapped around his body, these terrifying lake waters were still eroding his source strength crazily. The water was about to cover him, eroding the source strength on the outer layer!

Now Lin Xiu was sinking into the bottom of the lake and there was no way to float. The water of this lake was very strange. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth, frantically using the source strength to surround his body and resist the erosion of the lake.

Because Lin Xiu knew that as soon as his source strength disappeared, the water would burn his flesh directly!

Lin Xiu stared at this scene, gritted his teeth then ran the ‘Cultivation Technique’, absorbing the Odd crystals behind him!

This time, if it weren’t for the many Odd crystals in his backpack, his own source strength probably wouldn’t be enough.

The energy of the Odd crystals in the backpack was continuously absorbed by Lin Xiu.

But because these Odd crystals did not touch Lin Xiu’s body directly, it was very difficult to forcibly absorb them.

Damn it! What was he going to do!?

Now Lin Xiu couldn’t even move and it was very uncomfortable. The water density of this lake was very high and Lin Xiu’s body felt very uncomfortable being pressed down.

Fortunately, after Lin Xiu unlocked the rank 2 genetic lock, his body was different from ordinary people. Even at the bottom of the lake, he could breathe with his skin, but his breathing obviously couldn’t compare with normal breathing.

As he continued to sink below, Lin Xiu saw a white light.

What is that!?

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened when he saw the scene below.

Lin Xiu had a faint feeling of familiarity.

At this moment, he clenched his teeth, then waved his hands vigorously and slowly moved his body closer to that side.

But just that small movement was so challenging due to the relatively high water density.

Also, he had to use the ‘Cultivation Technique’ at the same time to forcibly absorb the energy of the Odd crystals to make up for the source strength that the water was eroding.

As Lin Xiu’s body continued to sink and he approached closer to that side, Lin Xiu clearly sensed that there was a… person in the light!?

No way, someone sank to the bottom of this lake!?

At this moment, the person in that cluster of light seemed to have noticed Lin Xiu’s existence and suddenly moved, then turned and looked towards Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was stunned.

Both eyes were filled with shock, then happiness.

Because this person… turned out to be Luo Yue!

Just when Lin Xiu was about to speak, he realized that he was at bottom of this weird lake!

As he got distracted, those terrifying lake water was about to erode his body!

He’s doomed!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and the look on his face changed drastically.

But just at this moment, Luo Yue instantly moved closer to Lin Xiu and her right hand directly embraced Lin Xiu’s body.

The white light on Luo Yue’s body was all transmitted to Lin Xiu’s body at this moment.

Then, these lights surrounded both Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu felt that his body became more relaxed.

The uncomfortable feeling of being under the pressure of the water seemed to disappear in an instant. Even breathing was fine!

What exactly is going on!?

Although Lin Xiu was shocked at this moment, he saw Luo Yue in front of him.

“Luo Yue, it’s really you!?” Lin Xiu said a little excitedly as he reached out to hold her other small hand and it was indeed a real touch, not an illusion.

“Are you done touching?” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and said indifferently.

“Ahem.” When Lin Xiu heard her words, he immediately returned to his senses, then let go of her hand and said a little embarrassingly, “I’m a little excited.”

And you’re holding my waist eh.

Lin Xiu mumbled.

But Lin Xiu understood that this appeared to be the only way to transfer the white light on Luo Yue’s body to his body.

“Why are you here?” Now in this white light, he was able to speak normally.

Luo Yue asked Lin Xiu.

“I just came over to take a look.” Lin Xiu said casually.

Now that Luo Yue is fine, Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief. When he heard that middle-aged man saying that a young girl was attacked by him and fell into the lake, Lin Xiu was very mad and wanted to kill him directly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue seemed to know something and the corners of her mouth rose up, revealing a dazzling smile.

But it disappeared very quickly, Lin Xiu didn’t notice it either.

“By the way, what are these things!? It’s too amazing…” Lin Xiu looked at the white light covering his body and exclaimed.
