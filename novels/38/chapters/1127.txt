Chapter 1128: Regeneration Complete!

Soon, with Lin Xiu’s guidance, all of the Holy Water then slowly formed its internal organs and the flesh around his body.

Time passed and Lin Xiu only felt extremely comfortable. There wasn’t even a sense of discomfort.

When Lin Xiu opened his eyes once again, he raised his hands and noticed that he now had muscles and tendons. It was no longer just skeleton bones.

“The regeneration worked!”

!!

Lin Xiu was excited as he took a look at his body.

His skin now was extremely fair after the regeneration.

Lin Xiu looked surprised by how his body was now.

As he slowly got up, Lin Xiiu noticed that all of the Holy Water had disappeared.

He must have absorbed all of it earlier.

Then, he went into his expansion space and took out the combat suit that he wore earlier. This made him feel relieved.

When he was only a body of bones, it felt uncomfortable.

He also had to wear that thick armour.

After changing into his clothes, Lin Xiu leaped out of the well.

Then, there was a bright, eye-blinding light that came out of nowhere.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrunk as he lifted his right hand and sweeped the energy that was coming at him to the stone wall behind.

Boom – –

The entire place shook when the energy landed on the wall.

Lin Xiu looked up and noticed that there was a middle-aged man standing by the entrance.

It was obvious that he just got here.

“Did you absorb all of my Holy Water?!”

Bai Qi was shocked when he saw Lin Xiu but it was immediately replaced by rage as Bai Qi asked in rage.

There was only one drop of it everywhere. They had to collect it for years before getting all of these.

Most of the masters didn’t even get the chance to have them.

Only those who were at the peak of a sage warrior and had the chance of becoming a warrior god would be allowed to drink the Holy Water.

“So what if I did?”

Lin Xiu let out a cold laugh.

After having his body regenerated, he felt as if his body was filled with much more energy compared to before.

He also had much more strength.

“You’re dead!”

Bai Qi roared in rage. His body shifted and it instantly appeared right in front of Lin Xiu.

There was a purple energy that covered his fist and he aimed it at Lin Xiu’s body!

The look on Lin Xiu’s face changed drastically when he saw what was coming. He did not dodge the attack. Instead, he lifted his right hand and swung it at Bai Qi’s fist!

‘Explosive Strike!’

There was a loud noise heard when Lin Xiu’s fist that was covered with a bright glow collided with Bai Qi’s who had a purple glow.

Lin Xiu felt a large surge of energy coming at him. Then, his body was like a broken kite as he flew backwards.

He landed heavily on the wall behind him.

Pfft – –

Lin Xiu tried to steady himself and mouth came out of his mouth.

The collision that he had with Bai Qi’s fist earlier caused a huge impact on his body.

The horrible impact felt like it had entered Lin Xiu’s organs which caused him to cough up blood.

“You shall stay here forever since you killed eight of my sage warriors and even took my Holy Water!”

Bai Qi screamed as he rushed towards Lin Xiu!

The way that he moved was peculiar. It was similar to ‘Flashing Souls’ where he could teleport instantly.

Then, he appeared in front of Lin Xiu once again.

Damn it!

Seeing how Bai Qi was coming at him again, about to attack him, Lin Xiu did not want to have another head on collision with him.

He used his skills and then disappeared into thin air before reappearing on the other side of the cave.

Lin Xiu immediately got his long spear from the expansion space and held it in his hands.

“Go!”

Lin Xiu held onto his long spear and summoned the flaming birds to attack Bai Qi!

Bai Qi was surprised to see what was happening and he quickly realised his ‘sphere’ to block the attack.

“Do you think that you’ll be able to harm me with these flames?!”

Bai Qi screamed.

His ‘sphere’ was different from the rest as he was purple in colour.

All of the dark blue flaming birds were stopped by his ‘sphere’.

What was even more surprising was that his ‘sphere’ seemed to have some special ability, allowing it to absorb the energy from the flaming birds.

Just when he was about to retaliate, he noticed that Lin Xiuw as gone! He had disappeared!

Where did he go?!

Bai Qi’s pupils narrowed and he realised what had happened.

Lin Xiu ran!

“Damn it!!”

Bai Qi roared in rage.

Then, he quickly looked into the well and noticed that the dazzling light was gone.

There was no more Holy Water left!

“Where’s the mouth of the well?!”

When he took a closer look, the bottom of the well seemed to have been dug and the mouth of the well that bred the Holy Water was gone as well!

Without the mouth of the well, this entire place was useless!

“I WILL KILL YOU!!!!”

Bai Qi was about to turn crazy. Then, he quickly went towards the exit.

As for Lin Xiu, he was already walking out of the tunnel.

Lin Xiu also realised that the thing that bred the Holy Water was found at the bottom of the well. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Therefore, he immediately blasted the bottom, took out what was breeding the Holy Water and placed it in his expansion space.

When he was fighting Bai Qi earlier, Lin Xiu had already read his stats with the Analytic Eye.

For some reason, without knowing how he trained, this man’s speed and strength were much above Lin Xiu’s !

If he didn’t use ‘Rage’, he would not be able to defeat this man.

However, even if he did use ‘rage’ and killed Bai Qi, the aftermath would follow. If the other sage warriors got to them in time, there was a possibility that he might end up getting killed.

He had just got his body back and it was not suitable for him to continue the fight.

Soon, when Lin Xiu rushed out of the cave, he placed his mask back on his face.

Then, he went straight into the sky!

Sizzling– –

As Lin Xiu got into the air, he couldn’t clearly see that there were currents all over the sky.

An electric net?

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frown.

This huge electric net covered the sky of the entire Bai family.

The currents on this electric net seemed scary and it would not be that easy for ordinary sage warriors to pass through them.

However, for Lin Xiu, who had certain control over electricity, he was not afraid at all.

He didn’t even release his ‘sphere’ as he went for the net!

When the current got into contact with Lin Xiu’s body, it did not cause him any injuries.

“This is…”

Bai Ling looked at how Lin Xiu had just flew passed the net and he was terrified.
