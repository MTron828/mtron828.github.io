Chapter 243: Defeat!

The entire Tower of Tournament trembled.

All the projected screens flickered from the impact.

“What’s going on?” Those not present at the arena and were watching from the screens were confused.

The collision of the powerful skills was too impactful and had even distorted the signal for the live broadcast.

“It’s back to normal!” A few spectators saw that the screen had stabilized and commented.

Everyone had their eyes fixed on the screen.

Everyone held their breaths as they stared at the dense cloud of dust on the Tower of Tournament.

The cloud of dust quickly scattered and two figures appeared.

“Fortunately that brat’s skill seems to be on par with Yu Yi. Otherwise, I think the entire floor will be destroyed.” Ouyang Hang heaved a sigh of relief.

But after that, his expression became ugly.

‘So who is the winner, Lin Xiu, or Yu Yi?’

‘If it’s Lin Xiu, it’s going to be troublesome…’

He clenched his fists tightly as he thought about this.

As the dust scattered, everyone saw Lin Xiu and Yu Yi’s figure.

The two had their weapons against each other and they seemed to be frozen in place.

“Who won…!?”

Everyone stared at the two competitors in shock.

They did not know who suffered more from the clash.

“Who would have thought that you have such a powerful skill?” Yu Yi stared at Lin Xiu and moved his lips to speak.

Pu-

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide as blood came out from the corners of his lips.

“I’m right! The freshman lost! Yu Yi’s skill is a diamond skill, as a rank 5 warrior, his strongest is most probably a gold skill!”

“Even the legendary Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City can’t win that!”

All the spectators saw blood dripping from Lin Xiu’s mouth and started to whisper among themselves.

Lin Xiu had lost in their eyes.

After all, Yu YI looked as though he was not injured anywhere.

“Very good.” Ouyang Hang who was staring at the fight finally heaved a sigh of relief.

Everyone could see that Lin Xiu had sustained heavy injuries while Yu Yi was fine.

If Lin Xiu won, the diamond body art that the Zhang family had given him would become Lin Xiu’s card.

How could he accept that?

After all, his family only had a few body arts!

It was extremely difficult to create a diamond skill card, not only must the creator be extremely powerful and well versed in the body art, there were many procedures to go through.

Ouyang Hang sat back in his seat but his eyes remained fixed on the Tower of Tournament.

“Goodbye.” But right at this moment, Lin Xiu looked at Yu Yi and spoke up with blood in his mouth.

Yu Yi opened his eyes wide as crack sounds came out from his body.

At that moment, his mouth, eyes, ears, nose all started to bleed.

Bang-

His entire body trembled and he fell to the ground as his eyes rolled to the back. No one knew if he was dead or alive.

Everyone opened their eyes wide at that.

Especially for the students that thought Yu Yi had won. All of them had their mouths wide open.

It was an inconceivable scene.

“Impossible…” One of the students rubbed their eyes and commented.

The change was too abrupt, how did Yu Yi fall when he looked completely fine? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Winner, Lin Xiu!”

Yu Yi remained unmoved on the ground after the time limit. A worker walked over and announced to the crowd after counting down.

“He won!!! Lin Xiu won!!!”

Once the announcement was made, Zhang Yin and the others screamed out in joy.

All the freshmen were cheering in excitement.

After all, Lin Xiu was their representative of the freshmen. How could they not be happy when a fellow freshman defeated a great senior?

All of the year two students had ugly complexions.

They definitely wanted to beat the freshmen up!

“Trash! Trash!!!!”

Amidst the cheers, Ouyang Hang fumed with rage to the point that his entire body was trembling.

He thought that Yu Yi had won since Lin Xiu had spat blood out.

Who would have thought that Yu Yi was the one to be even more injured!

Yu Yi was still comatose as a group of medical workers came over and carried him out.

“Do you wish to continue or stay at this level?” A worker came and asked Lin Xiu.

He looked at Lin Xiu with surprise in his eyes.

He did not expect this result at all. The freshman actually won against a rank 6 year 2 senior.

“I’ll stay.” Lin Xiu struggled to reply.

He was no longer able to stand by himself if not for the fact that he was leaning on Dark Edge.

The aftereffects of Fury were too intense and he was currently weaker than a child.

“Lin Xiu, too powerful! You really beat him down!” Zhang Yin and the others crowded around Lin Xiu beneath the stage and looked at him.

“It wasn’t much.” Lin Xiu smiled when he saw them. Unable to hold it in any longer, he fell to the ground.

He was completely devoid of strength.

He could not even lift a finger.

“Are you ok?” They all leaped onto the stage and asked Lin Xiu with concern.

“I’m fine, don’t worry. I’ll be back up after a bit of rest.” Lin Xiu replied weakly.
