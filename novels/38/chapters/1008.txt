Chapter 1009: Absorb the Power of a God

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“That’s right, that kid…”

Huangfu Gu was half-sitting on the ground at this time, as if his qi and blood were a little out of order.

“Most of your power descended and you still didn’t manage to kill him?”

The old man beside him frowned and said.

In Namir Planet, the most powerful warriors were only Sage warriors, how could they not be killed?

“This kid’s skills are too weird!”

Huangfu Gu gritted his teeth and said.

Originally, with the power he descended on Huangfu Gu’s body, he should have been able to kill Lin Xiu.

But in the end, Lin Xiu killed him instead.

Moreover, Lin Xiu devoured his power again!

This is the second time!

“Let’s go to the planet Namir.”

Huangfu Gu stared at the old man in front of him and gritted his teeth.

Now he has a wave of anger in his heart and there is no way to relieve it.

“No, there is a sealing force over there, we can’t go directly.”

When the old man heard Huangfu Gu’s words, he immediately shook his head and said.

“But…”

Huangfu Gu’s face became extremely ugly.

He was very upset, his power was just swallowed up by Lin Xiu.

And twice in a row!

Especially this time, he was hit hard.

“Don’t worry, someone is already looking for a way to break the seal over there. Give it some time, there should be no problem going down then.”

At this moment, the old man continued to speak.

“very good.”

At this time, Huangfu Gu had a ferocious look on his face.

Thinking of Lin Xiu’s figure, his eyes were filled with infinite killing intent.

At this time, Lin Xiu, who was under the sea, was still automatically absorbing the energy by the Engulf skill.

Huangfu Gu’s energy was really too pure. At this time, Lin Xiu was constantly absorbing this energy and a crisp sound suddenly sounded in Lin Xiu’s mind.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for successfully upgrading, the current level is 66!”

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for winning the lottery once!”

Upgraded!?

At this moment, when he heard the system prompt in his mind, Lin Xiu’s eyes showed a look of surprise.

Now with the continuous leveling up, the required experience points increased more and more.

Therefore, Lin Xiu rarely checked how much experience he had gained.

At this time, Lin Xiu couldn’t move much, so he directly entered the system in his mind.

Rage build-up: 0/100

Level 66, comfortable!

Lin Xiu looked at the information in his mind and immediately found it pleasing to the eye.

But now he needed too much experience to level up and Lin Xiu felt dizzy when he saw the number of zeros.

It is really difficult to reach the level of a Warrior god.

Strength, recovered.

At the same time, Lin Xiu felt that the strength of his body had recovered a lot.

The sequelae of ‘Fury’ have begun to disappear.

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide and his body rushed out of the ocean as soon as his thoughts were triggered!

wow-

As he rushed out of the ocean, Lin Xiu felt that his whole body was very comfortable!

He got 66 potential points, which was directly added to the strength attribute by Lin Xiu.

Although there were only sixty-six points, when the sixty-six points were added to the strength attribute, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the difference.

boom boom boom —

At the same time, at the next moment, the artificial angel also shook its six wings and flew over at an extremely fast speed from the other side.

Stayed on the shore of this ocean.

Lin Xiu’s body was suspended in the air, then flew beside the artificial angel.

Taking a closer look at this time, he saw that the armor on the shoulders of the artificial angel was dented.

Looking at this scene, a look of surprise appeared in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

Lin Xiu couldn’t even cause any damage to this armor. He didn’t expect that Huangfu Bai, after ‘God Descend’, would cause a dent on it.

“Elder Yi, just now…”

At the same time, outside the Sage warrior Space, those Sage warriors looked at Yi Zhangkong curiously and said aloud. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The Sage warrior Space, which was suddenly broken open, was automatically closed at this time.

And the sky that was originally covered with dark clouds, at this moment, also cleared up.

“The ‘God Descend’ of the Divine Domain.”

Yi Zhangkong seemed to understand something and said lightly at this time.

“‘God descend’?”

Some of the Sage warriors who had heard of it were surprised.

No wonder the powerful force just now directly caused such a change.

“But it seems that it has failed.”

Yi Changkong looked into the distance, as if speaking to himself.

So many Divine Domain warriors died, who did it?

At this time, Yi Changkong looked over at the huge monument not far away. The first one was a warrior named Sun Jian.

And next to his name, there is the number ‘forty-five’.

Forty-five source rings.

“Huh, not bad.”

“The harvest is good.”

Lin Xiu stretched and walked to the other side.

“You are Lin Xiu, right?”

At this moment, a voice came from the front.

Hearing this voice, Lin Xiu raised his brows immediately, looked ahead and realized that there was a group of warriors coming over.

And among this group of warriors, there were re two familiar figures.

Duan Zeyan and… Wang Qiang.

At this time, the two of them had a lot of scars on their bodies.

They looked disheveled.

The man walking in the front was carrying a black long sword.

This long sword was very long and wide and it looked very strange.

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

“Energy Source Stone, hand it over.”

The man with the black long sword on his back stared at Lin Xiu and said lightly.

“I didn’t say it…he used…”

Duan Zeyan’s hands were restrained by two warriors and he said with difficulty.

“Shut up.”

But when he spoke, a warrior next to him slammed his fist directly into his abdomen.

pfft—

A mouthful of blood spat out from his mouth in an instant.

Lin Xiu looked at this group of people without saying a word.

At this moment, with a movement of the right hand, the source strength from his body was directly released!
