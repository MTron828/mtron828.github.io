Chapter 510: I Hate It The Most When Others Threaten Me

What he really wanted to do now was to quickly escape from this nightmare.

If he didn’t run now, Lin Xiu would definitely kill him!

Lin Xiu turned towards Zhao Xia, with the spear in his hand. He ran in directly and dashed towards Zhao Xia!

Lin Xiu’s speed was extremely quick and with his ‘Yuan’ open, he was undefeatable!

He was alone but it looked as if he had the force of a hundred men and soon got all the way to the front!

“Don’t even think about it!!!”

Some of them who took the forbidden drug immediately formed a human wall. They stood next to each other, blocking Lin Xiu’s path.

Since they took the drugs, their body size had become much bigger, especially their muscles. It was so big that they looked a little scary.

“Move!” Lin Xiu no longer wanted to fight with these men. The only reason why he was here was to kill Zhao Xia and he wouldn’t let him get away!

As Lin Xiu roared while swinging the spear in his hand, there were multiple black-colored figures that appeared from the tip of his spear. The figures slowly turned into a huge dragon that went after those men!

Hongggg – –

As the black dragon opened his mouth, it instantly burnt off all the men that were blocking Lin Xiu’s way!

Lin Xiu took the chance. He leaped forward using the men’s head as a platform and jumped towards Zhao Xia.

“Where are you heading to?!” All of it happened within seconds and Lin Xiu was already standing right in front of Zhao Xia. Lin Xiu gave a good kick to Zhao Xia who was trying to run. Zhao Xia was immediately on the ground and the tip of the spear was pointed onto Zhao Xia’s forehead.

“Stop!” Zhao Lin screamed when he saw what Lin Xiu was doing.

Lin Xiu was now completely covered by ‘Yuan’ and there was horrifying lightning that surrounded Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’.

He didn’t dare go close to Lin Xiu.

“Stop what you’re doing!” Zhao Lin warned Lin Xiu once again.

“Do you know what you did today?! This is Zhao’s mansion!” Some of the members of the Zhao family started screaming at Lin Xiu as well.

The Zhao family has been the strongest family in Bai Di City. They have already been looked up to while the others bow down to them. When have they ever encountered having bloodshed in their own homes?!

And the most important thing was….he was just a young man with his spear that destroyed the Zhao family!

“He would have to pay the price for what he has done.” Lin Xiu said calmly.

Zhao Xia, who saw the spear on top of his head, felt so scared that he wet his pants.

There was still blood on the tip of the spear and they were slowly dripping onto his face.

“Please…don’t kill me…..don’t…”

“Don’t you dare! I will destroy your entire family!!!!” Zhao Lin screamed at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank uncontrollably after hearing what Zhao Lin said.

“I hate it the most when others threaten me.”

Then, Lin Xiu thrust his spear deep into Zhao Xia’s head as soon as he was done warning the Zhao family.

Blood splattered everywhere.

Zhao Xiong immediately passed out. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Zhao Lin, on the other hand, froze on the spot when he saw what Lin Xiu did.

Perhaps it was because he got too angry, he spitted out a mouthful of blood.

“Remember. If there’s anyone from the Zhao family that dares to mess with me or my friends, I will come again.”

“I will cause a bloodbath with the Zhao family.”

Lin Xiu warned them word by word, picked up his spear, and left in the other direction.

As Lin Xiu was leaving, the men that surrounded him earlier knew that they couldn’t stop him. They decided to move aside, clearing a path for Lin Xiu to leave.

As Zhao Lin looked at Lin Xiu who was leaving, his vision turned black and turned unconscious.

“The smell of blood is so disgusting.” As Lin Xiu was leaving, he shook the Dark Edge in order to get rid of the blood that was on the spear. All of the blood then fell off the spear.

The entire spear looked brand new.

He finally solved the issue with the Zhao family.

Well…. There wouldn’t be anyone else left who would look for trouble with him from now onwards.

But..would Chen Jinqian, the man who he paralyzed, come looking for him?

As Lin Xiu walked out of the alley, he could feel that there was someone following behind him.

Are they here already?

“Show yourself.” Lin Xiu, who was walking at a slow pace, suddenly stopped and spoke to the person behind him.

But, no one answered and it doesn’t look like the person following him would show himself.

Then, within a blink of an eye, Lin Xiu’s figure suddenly disappeared from the alley.

“Where is he?!” All of the men that were in hiding suddenly appeared and asked in shock.

“Who sent you here?”

As soon as they appeared, there was a clear voice that came from behind them.

They quickly turned around and when they saw Lin Xiu, it was as if they had seen a ghost.

“You…”

The men were filled with shock but they reacted quickly and immediately attacked Lin Xiu with the weapons in their arms!

Boom – –

Before their weapons could even touch Lin Xiu, there saw a few gunshot figures appearing before their eyes and at the very next moment, there were bloody holes that appeared on their foreheads.

“Bring me to him.” Lin Xiu had purposely left one of them alive and instructed the man.

The man was in shock.

They have been hired to kill Lin Xiu but before they could do anything, Lin Xiu had already killed all of them.

What is with his skills…

“I…..” His body was shaking and before he could say anything, Lin Xiu’s bloody spear was already pointing against his forehead.

“I don’t think that you should reject me?” Lin Xiu said bluntly.

He had just killed so many of the trained men of the Zhao family and they should be afraid right now. It wouldn’t make any sense for them to send men after him right now.

If he had guessed correctly, Chen Jinqian was the one who sent them here.

“I’m going to kill him!! I’m going to kill him!!” On the other side of the town, inside an exquisite medical ward, Chen Jinqian was screaming in fury.

His bones were completely crushed and were now replaced by artificial bone. They were strong, but they have lost their ability to grow.

This was a heavy blow for a warrior.

“Don’t worry about it. I have already sent men to kill him. If he dares to show his face in Bai Di City, he would be dead.” A middle-aged man that looked exactly like Chen Jinqian comforted him.

“We will definitely take care of this! This is an embarrassment to the Chen family!”
