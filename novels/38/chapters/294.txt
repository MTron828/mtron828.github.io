Chapter 295: Luo Yue’s Sword

Lin Xiu looked at the location ahead in surprise and quickly rushed over.

Upon arriving, he squatted down and picked up the weapon that was covered in mud.

It was a sword, a very fine sword.

This sword was extremely thin and although it was dirty, it could not hide the beauty of the weapon.

“Whoo.”

Lin Xiu blew on it and all the dirt came off the sword.

As he scrutinized it, he confirmed that the sword was identical to Luo Yue’s!

Lin Xiu looked carefully. The form and weight of it was definitely Luo Yue’s weapon!

Lin Xiu frowned. Luo Yue always carried her weapon and the possibility of her throwing her weapon on a whim was impossible.

This meant that she had encountered trouble and had no choice but to throw the weapon.

Lin Xiu looked ahead where there were many messy footprints. He was unable to distinguish them.

‘What is going on here!?’

Lin Xiu was deeply puzzled by the situation.

“Damn it…” After investigating around, Lin Xiu did not obtain any hints. He clenched his fists tightly and held onto her sword. He then continued in the same direction ahead.

He used to feel that the sword was heavy, but the weight was negligible to him now.

His own strength had increased by leaps and bounds over the few months.

Bang bang bang-

Right at this time as Lin Xiu was walking, he heard urgent footsteps from his side.

His eyes immediately changed expressions. There were clearly people rushing over!

Sou-

Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted right away as though he saw something. He raised Dark Edge and thrust forward!

Bang-

Following an explosion, the black and large trees were penetrated by the spear!

“Wait!”

Right at that moment, a loud roar came out.

Lin Xiu’s stab stopped abruptly.

He watched as a male appeared. Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge tip was at his forehead. Just a bit more and it would have blasted his head off.

Lin Xiu looked at the man indifferently, “What are you doing here?”

They were separated by a gigantic tree but Dark Edge was able to pierce through the trunk and appear at his forehead.

Sou-

Lin Xiu exerted a force and pulled Dark Edge back.

Due to the spear strike, the trunk had a hole that revealed the opposite side.

“I… I have no ill intent.” The man swallowed his saliva and replied.

He was scared and came over here but was almost killed by Lin Xiu.

After seeing Lin Xiu retract the spear, the man felt as though he was rebirthed with a new life.

As though he had been relieved of all burdens.

“Zhang Yao! What’s going on?” Right at this moment, more footsteps could be heard.

Lin Xiu cast his gaze over behind and saw many figures walking over.

“It’s nothing.” Zhang Yao saw his companions walking over and heaved a sigh of relief.

He was at ease when they were here.

“Who are you guys?” Lin Xiu squinted his eyes as his gaze swept across them. Under Analytic Eye, he could see that aside from two or three that were rank 6, the rest were peak rank 5.

Weren’t they seeking death with such strength inside Dark Forest’s center region?

“Zhang Yao, who is he?” A man saw Lin Xiu and frowned. He immediately spoke to the person that Lin Xiu scared.

“I don’t know.” Zhang Yao shook his head.

“Brat, who are you?” The man looked at Lin Xiu and snorted.

“Boring.” Lin Xiu glanced at them. With their strength, they would not be able to affect anything inside Dark Forest.

As for all the rank 6 and rank 7 warriors that were killed, they were most probably unaware of it.

Upon thinking of this, Lin Xiu no longer held any interest in asking them and continued going ahead.

“Stop for me!” The man saw that Lin Xiu had ignored them and immediately felt disregarded when Lin Xiu walk away. His expression changed as he ordered Lin Xiu.

He became enraged when Lin Xiu continued to walk and ignored him.

He extended his hand out to pull Lin Xiu.

Just as he was about to do so, he saw a cold gleam.

His pupils constricted but he was no longer able to dodge!

Bang-

But Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge stabbed onto a pale blue barrier, causing him to frown.

“Sphere?”

The man stumbled back a few steps upon receiving Lin Xiu’s strike. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

He looked at Lin Xiu with shock in his eyes.

‘How can this young man have so much power?’

He, a rank 6 warrior, was that close to being stabbed to death by Lin Xiu’s spear!

“Young brother, I apologize, he was too impulsive.” Right at this moment, a man walked forward and smiled at Lin Xiu.

“What do you want to say?” Lin Xiu looked at him and replied indifferently.

He was stunned as he did not expect Lin Xiu to be so straightforward.

The man chuckled bitterly then answered seriously, “Do you know what happened there?”
