Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Who are you?”

Ouyang Hang was also an extremely arrogant person. At this time, he stared at him and said coldly.

“Jiang Zhen, a sophomore, ranked first in the sophomore year!” Jiang Zhen said arrogantly at this time.

“You should call me Senior.”

“You are not a match for me.” Ouyang Hang looked at him and said lightly.

Hearing his words, Jiang Zhen’s eyes suddenly changed and were full of a strong murderous aura.

“Dean, let me spar with this senior.” Ouyang Hang asked Dean Baili for permission.

Hearing Ouyang Hang’s words, Dean Baili touched his beard and nodded.

At the same time, many students seemed to have seen this scene, and they all gathered there.

Ouyang Hang and Jiang Zhen stood in the center of the field. The two looked at each other for a moment. In the next moment, they suddenly charged towards the each other!

Bang bang bang-

Without using weapons, the two fought with bare hands.

As they fought, there were sounds breaking through the air.

Moreover, they looked equal in strength.

“Break!”

The more Jiang Zhen fought, the more frantic he became, and his fists waved wildly.

But Ouyang Hang showed a crazy look on his face at this time, without any concessions, he directly confronted Jiang Zhen head-on!

As the fists of the two collided again, it was as if two powerful forces collided together, a loud sound suddenly erupted.

The eyes of the two people changed, and in the next moment, they both flew out at the same time.

Jiang Zhen fell to the ground, sat up abruptly, and spat out a mouthful of blood.

On the other hand, Ouyang Hang retreated for a long distance before regaining his balance.

Pfft—

Just like Jiang Zhen, Ouyang Hang also vomited out a mouthful of blood at this time. His face was a little pale, it was obvious that he had also received a strong impact just now, and he looked a little uncomfortable at this time.

“Jiang Zhen!”

At this time, Jiang Zhen’s companions quickly helped Jiang Zhen up.

Jiang Zhen stood up, then looked at Ouyang Hang who was not far away, with a complex look in his eyes.

In the next moment, he sighed and said, “I lost.”

“Jiang Zhen...”

At this time, the sophomore students looked very unwilling.

But this was the truth. From the battle just now, Ouyang Hang was indeed stronger.

“Students, this time, do you have any opinions?”

Dean Baili touched his beard and seemed to be quite satisfied with the battle just now.

“We have no opinion.” Jiang Zhen said with a sigh at this time.

Ouyang Hang wiped the blood from his lips, and at this moment, he stood upright arrogantly.

“Then let’s go.”

Lin Xiu said at this time.

He couldn’t wait to pass the audition and go to Sky City!

“No!”

“We recognize his strength, but as for you, not yet!”

At this time, a tall and muscular man walked over from a distance and said loudly.

“Wild Bull?”

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao frowned slightly when they saw this person coming.

Wild Bull, his nickname, was the most rebellious student in junior year, and ranked third in the academy, on par with Huang Zhen and Qian Yao. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Because the senior students were all going out to gain experience, so strictly speaking, there were no senior students in the academy.

And third-year students were already considered the most powerful in the academy.

“So what if a freshman is the number one freshman? This is the World Warrior Conference, Dean, I, Wild Bull is not convinced!”

Wild Bull looked at Lin Xiu over there, his eyes were full of provocation.

“It seems that I have to prove myself just like you did?”

Lin Xiu looked at Ouyang Hang who was standing beside him, and smiled lightly.

“This person’s strength is not simple.” Ouyang Hang was not in the mood to joke at this time, because he clearly felt that this man nicknamed Wild Bull was full of explosive power.

“Well, you’re not convinced, huh?”

Lin Xiu stepped out at this time, stood in front of Wild Bull, and said lightly.

“Your strength is not worthy.” Wild BUll looked at Lin Xiu up close, and said with a hideous smile on his cheek.

He looked extremely arrogant.

“One punch.”

Lin Xiu raised a finger at this time, and then said lightly.

“Arrogant!”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s arrogant expression, Wild Bull who was already a violent person from the start was like a lit gunpowder, he suddenly became furious.

“Go to hell!”

He let out a loud roar, and in the next moment, he swung his fists and attacked Lin Xiu!

Boom—

His fist smashed out and made a loud sound.

But when this punch was about to hit Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared instantly!

Where did he go?!

Wild Bull’s eyes widened, and the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

“Goodbye.”

Just the next moment, before he had time to react, a voice came from his side.

Lin Xiu, who appeared on his side, slammed his right hand straight out!

Boom–

His entire muscular body flew out instantly and fell to the ground far away, making a dull sound.

The huge impact made Wild Bull instantly dizzy.

When the people around saw this scene, all their eyes widened, as if they had not recovered from the shock.

One punch, really just one punch knocked Wild Bull into the air!

Even Huang Zhen and Qian Yao were in disbelief.

Wild Bull and them were in the top three of the junior year. Although Wild Bull was ranked third in terms of strength, their strength was still similar.

Unexpectedly, Lin Xiu dealt with Wild Bull with just one punch.

How strong is he?!

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao looked at each other, and they could see the shock in each other’s eyes.

“Now, is there anyone who is not convinced?”

Lin Xiu glanced at the students around him and said lightly.

Not convinced?

Even the Wild Bull was knocked down by Lin Xiu, and those students didn’t think their strength was more powerful than Wild Bull.

Those students all ducked when they saw Lin Xiu glancing over.

They didn’t dare to look at Lin Xiu at all.

“Then let’s go.”

Lin Xiu looked at Ouyang Hang and the others and saw that no one was talking, then said with a faint smile. As soon as he walked to the gate of the academy, Lin Xiu suddenly thought of something, and said to Dean Baili, “By the way, there are four of us now, where is the other student?”

“Look..” As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, Dean Baili pointed to the figure beside the beach in front of the entrance, and smiled.
