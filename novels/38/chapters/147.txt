Chapter 148: Electing The Class Monitor!

“I’ll introduce myself, my name is Nan Zhengjun and I will be your teacher.” The teacher of Class 10 was a seemingly young man. At this moment, he smiled and said to everyone standing there.

Lin Xiu looked at this man who seemed to be only 27 or 28 years old. He looked ordinary, but Lin Xiu felt a peculiar aura coming from him.

This person is very strong.

Lin Xiu instinctively used the Analytic Eye, but realized that the Analytic Eye indicated that he could not be analyzed.

At this moment, Nan Zhengjun seemed to sense something and looked curiously at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was still smiling and there weren’t any strange expressions on his face.

Seeing that Nan Zhengjun had looked away, Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief.

This person’s strength was too terrifying, he even noticed that Lin Xiu was sizing him up?

“Now, I will take you to our class first.” Nan Zhengjun’s gaze swept across 40 freshmen at this moment and walked directly in the other direction.

Lin Xiu, Zhang Yin, and the others looked at each other, then nodded, and walked to the other side.

Everyone went to the left and followed Nan Zhengjun as he led the class.

Lin Xiu looked at the people in the other classes as he walked and found that they were all heading in different directions with their respective teachers.

It didn’t take long before they saw a tall building in front.

The architectural style was a bit peculiar and the exterior seemed to be made of piled rocks.

But when they walked in, they found that everything was high-tech in there.

There were some cleaning robots that were cleaning the dirt on the ground at lobby of this building.

With Nan Zhengjun leading in front, everyone arrived in a huge classroom on the second floor.

There was a strange machine on every desk and even the seats looked like seats for some kind of simulation training.

“Just find a seat and insert your card to bind to the desk.” Nan Zhengjun said with a smile.

Lin Xiu found a seat and sat down.

On this strange table, he found a place to insert his card and it started up instantly.

There were flashes of light on the table and soon, a computer screen was formed by a holographic projection.

You could clearly see your own photo on the screen, as well as admission information and so on.

Then, there was a prompt on it, showing whether to confirm the binding.

After binding, this multifunctional desk could only be activated with this card.

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate and clicked Yes directly.

“This is the classroom of Class 10. No, it should be said that this building is ours. In addition to basic theoretical knowledge, the daily curriculum includes simulated acting, practical mecha operations, special training for warriors, etc.” Nan Zhengjun said from the podium.

“We need to choose someone in the class to be the class monitor who is responsible for assisting class affairs.”

“Is there anyone you guys would like to recommend?” Nan Zhengjun squinted and glanced at the crowd.

The moment he said that, everyone looked at each other.

These people didn’t know each other, after all.

“What are the benefits of being a class monitor?” Lin Xiu smiled.

Everyone turned to look at Lin Xiu.

“That is a good question.” Nan Zhengjun nodded.

“The class monitor can obtain the key to the training room on the third floor, where you can perform physical training, as well as mecha practical operations and simulated battles.”

“You can train at any time.”

“And every month, you will be rewarded 500 points.”

Hearing Nan Zhengjun’s words, the students’ eyes suddenly lit up.

They all wanted this kind of preferential treatment.

“All right, since none of you have a good candidate, let’s cast votes then.” Nan Zhengjun smiled, then tapped on the keyboard on the podium and the name list of the class appeared on their screens. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“The one with the most votes will be the class monitor of our Class 10.”

At this moment, these freshmen hesitated when they looked at these names and they clicked on their own names without hesitation.

Soon, the statistics came out. Nan Zhengjun looked at the result and smiled: “Lin Xiu, four votes, he will become our class monitor this semester.”

“No way! They know each other, it’s not fair at all!” A tall and big student stood up and said loudly.

“Yes, Teacher Nan, this is not fair at all!” The rest of the students also yelled at this moment.

The class monitor has too much preferential treatment and he would even receive 500 points every month.

One must know that ordinary students were given 500 points every month as well. They didn’t know how important the points were yet, but they felt that these points would be closely related to the rest of their campus life.

“Then what do you guys think is fair?” Nan Zhengjun smiled.

When these students heard Nan Zhengjun’s words, they suddenly seemed a little nervous, afraid that the teacher would get angry.

“Don’t worry, the Sacred Region Academy emphasizes the freedom of speech.”

“A battle, I think as the class monitor, he must be at the top of the class in strength, right?” The tall and big student said with his fists clenched.

“Yes!” The other students nodded in agreement.

The people here could be regarded as geniuses in their former high school and they clearly wouldn’t submit to one another.

“Okay, but it’s a bit late for the battle now, let’s use this to decide first.” Nan Zhengjun nodded, then pressed a button on the desktop.

Boom boom——

As the noises rang out, the ceiling above cracked open and a machine slowly descended from the suspension on the ceiling.

“A strength test machine – the student who has the strongest fist strength wins, how about that!?”

“Yes!!!” Most people were pleased with this and they nodded in agreement.

“Let me go first!” The first guy who objected just now cracked his knuckles and slammed the strength test machine with his fist!

Bang——

With a dull sound, the strength test machine shook slightly, and ‘9800KG’ appeared on it.

“9800KG!?” Some guys who saw this gasped. His fist could probably smash them to death.

“Not bad.” Nan Zhengjun nodded in approval.

“Let me try it too!” At this moment, every freshman began to test their strengths, but no one could exceed his 9800KG.

“Lin Xiu, what should we do?” Zhang Yin and the others frowned when they saw this scene.

They all thought that Lin Xiu was going to be the class monitor, but this Cheng Yaojin intercepted all of a sudden.
