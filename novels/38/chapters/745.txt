Chapter 746: Weird Cloak Man

Clack clack-

At this time, a large amount of ice and snow covered Lin Xiu’s body and instantly solidified.

Revealing on Lin Xiu’s head.

“You can’t believe it huh! This is the inheritance I got from the legacy land!”

Zhang Zhiheng roared angrily, then the sword in both hands was about to slash at Lin Xiu’s neck.

He wanted to chop off Lin Xiu’s head directly!

boom–

But just as he was holding the sword in his hand and slashing at Lin Xiu, the ice and snow on Lin Xiu’s body exploded in an instant!

The ice and snow that exploded and flew out, in turn, hit his body!

What happened!?

When Zhang Zhiheng saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

“Go away!”

Looking at the ice and snow charging toward his body, he roared and wanted to continue using the skills he had learned.

But this time, the ice and snow couldn’t be controlled by him like when he used skills just now.

swoosh—

At the next moment, his body was instantly covered by a large amount of ice and snow.

No matter how hard he struggled, it was useless!

“Go!!!”

At this moment, Lin Xiu swung the spear in his hand and the source strength in his body started to run wildly.

In the next moment, the surrounding ice and snow flew wildly.

“What!!!”

Zhang Zhiheng roared loudly, trying to break free from the ice and snow that had frozen half of his body.

As for the members of the God’s Punishment Guild, their bodies were trembling at this time and they felt that the environment around them was cold, but at this time, it became even colder.

Those wildly blowing ice and snow covered their bodies.

The Heart of Frost in Lin Xiu’s body seemed to be working like crazy at this time.

Those warriors of the Guild were almost all rank 9 warriors. For Lin Xiu, who has now been promoted to a master warrior, this was really... too weak!

In the next moment, those people were all frozen in ice!

All turned into ice sculptures.

Except...the man in the cloak.

There was a look of surprise in the man’s eyes, as if he didn’t understand how Lin Xiu could use such power.

“Damn…”

At this time, Zhang Zhiheng’s whole body’s source strength was running and the ice and snow covering his body were all shattered at this moment.

“How did you do this.”

Zhang Zhiheng looked at Lin Xiu grimly and said.

He never imagined that Lin Xiu would actually also use this skill that he inherited!

Moreover, he slowly learned it from the words on the stone tablet.

It took him a lot of time.

But when Lin Xiu used it, he was much stronger than him. Even his own subordinates were completely frozen in ice at this moment!

Why is his skill so powerful?

“It seems that you haven’t grasped the essence of this trick yet.”

Lin Xiu said with a sneer.

Zhang Zhiheng didn’t even know that he possessed the Heart of Frost and using this kind of skill was simply extremely handy!

“Courting death!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s sarcastic words, he became even more embarrassed.

Holding the sword in his hand, he attacked Lin Xiu again!

Dang– RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

When he slashed over with the long knife in his hand, Lin Xiu directly resisted the blow.

Boom—

And at this moment, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand instantly burst into a dark red flame.

In this flame, there was also lightning.

These flashes of lightning were directly transmitted to Zhang Zhiheng’s body through Zhang Zhiheng’s weapon.

The lightning seemed to be small, but the voltage was indeed extremely high, which made Zhang Zhiheng’s face change greatly.

And there was also a sense of numbness.

boom–

At this moment, the Dark Edge spear that Lin Xiu was holding directly exerted force, sending Zhang Zhiheng’s body flying out and at the same time, the spear continued to stab at Zhang Zhiheng!

Whoosh whoosh—

The moment the spear was pierced, it turned into thousands of spear shadows.

Each one seemed to be so real.

In the air, there was a sound breaking through the air.

‘Sphere’!!!

Zhang Zhiheng roared in his heart and the source strength of his body instantly gathered.

A ‘Sphere’ was formed, surrounding his body.

Because there were so many spears shadows, he didn’t know if it was really possible to stab so many spears in just one second and he couldn’t resist at all.

bang bang bang-

The spear pierced his ‘Sphere’, making a dull sound.

The huge impact force made Zhang Zhiheng keep retreating.

But Lin Xiu didn’t stop his movements at all and continued to attack him with the Dark Edge spear in both hands.

It seemed that he wanted to break his “Sphere”!

“Hurry up and help me!”

Zhang Zhiheng finally couldn’t stand it anymore and shouted loudly at the man in the cloak behind.

From just wanting to kill Lin Xiu slowly, now, he finally felt that Lin Xiu’s power did not seem to be weak at all and he was stronger than himself!

“I’m afraid the price will increase.”

The man in the cloak thought for a while, then said aloud.

“Three times!”

Zhang Zhiheng continued to resist Lin Xiu’s attack, then roared.

“Deal.”

The man in the cloak thought for a while, then nodded.

He waved his hands and in the next moment, strands of source threads emitting white rays of light were released from the fingers of his hands.

Like thick and long spider webs, they all charged toward Lin Xiu who was attacking Zhang Zhiheng!

It’s those things just now!

Lin Xiu saw this scene out of the corner of his eyes, his body stopped attacking and instantly retreated back.

Whoosh whoosh—

But these source threads, which seemed to be transformed from the source, continued to fly towards Lin Xiu’s body.

The hands of the man in the cloak flicked in the air and those threads kept charging towards Lin Xiu.

This kind of ability was really strange. This was the first time Lin Xiu has seen someone use the source strength like this.

But after Lin Xiu unfolded the ‘Without a Trace’ movement technique, the whole person was like a phantom and the speed of dodging was very fast.

bang bang bang-

Those silk threads impacted the bodies of the frozen warriors behind and instantly penetrated their bodies.

Seeing this scene in his eyes, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but look surprised.

How could this kind of thread formed from the source strength be so terrifying?

Just when Lin Xiu was surprised, Zhang Zhiheng attacked again!

He jumped up and slashed from top to bottom with the sword in his hand.

‘Heaven and Earth Collapse Strike’!!!

It originally looked like a blood-red sword, but at the moment when it slashed down in the air, a lot of red light burst out.

This blow seemed to be extremely powerful and Zhang Zhiheng was sure to kill Lin Xiu, so he used all his strength without hesitation, which made this blow even more terrifying.

Boom—
