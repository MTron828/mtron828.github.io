1471 Pseudo True God

How can this be!

His energy did not cause any harm to him!

And at this moment, the flames on Lin Xiu’s body suddenly condensed.

A terrifying flame was formed, and it charged towards his energy ray in an instant.

The energy he spat out from his mouth was directly impacted away.

!!

A large number of flames rushed directly towards his body.

Those Flame of chaos are about to cover his body!

“No!!!”

Huangfu Yuanshen roared.

In the next moment, these flames directly hit his entire body.

Boom——

With a loud sound, those flames formed a huge flame column and impacted into the sky.

At this moment, the whole ground vibrated crazily.

This time, he must die!!!

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu snorted coldly.

A large amount of source strength was mobilized, turned into more Flame of chaos, and rushed towards Huangfu Yuanshen.

The entire surrounding space was directly distorted by this terrifying Flame of chaos.

Still not dead?

A minute has passed, and these Flame of chaos soaring into the sky have not disappeared yet.

Lin Xiu’s system still hasn’t prompt him of the experience gained.

Which meant that this guy is not dead yet.

His eyes fixed on the position where Huangfu Yuanshen was just now.

Soon, a figure slowly walked out.

A… skeleton!?

“Damn guy…”

As the skeleton came out, Huangfu Yuanshen’s voice was directly transmitted to Lin Xiu’s mind.

“How could it be possible for me to die so easily?”

His voice continued to come over.

It is a sound released with special energy.

Huangfu Yuanshen, who was burned into a skeleton, slowly walked towards Lin Xiu at this time.

“you are dead.”

Lin Xiu stared at him, then said lightly.

“I won’t die…!”

He said grimly.

Soon, as he walked forward, a large number of cracks appeared on his bones.

Kala Kala——

With the sound of clear and crisp sounds.

His skeleton began to slowly disintegrate.

After he took a few steps, the whole skeleton completely shattered!

A golden light cluster instantly gathered from its shattered bones.

Then they flew to the other side!

Where is he going!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu flew directly into the sky as soon as he moved.

Chasing after this golden ball of light.

Boom——

But at this moment, a huge sound erupted in the sky.

The whole sky seemed to be shattered.

It opened up an incomparably huge space.

Looking at this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly.

This is…!?

At this time, Lin Xiu’s body was suspended in the air. Looking at this scene, his expression became ugly.

What a terrifying power!

This kind of power, even Lin Xiu, who has been upgraded to the current level, felt terror.

This was absolutely impossible to be the power released by Huangfu Yuanshen.

The current Huangfu Yuanshen only has a soul, without any power at all.

As long as you grab his soul, you can devour it.

But looking at this weird scene in the sky now, Lin Xiu didn’t dare to make any moves.

At the next moment, in the huge opening in the sky, a huge palm directly grasped the soul power of Huangfu Yuanshen.

Then this huge arm retracted into the broken space again.

“Pseudo-true god!?”

The figure of Zhulong also appeared in front of Lin Xiu instantly at this moment.

“What is a pseudo god?!”

When Lin Xiu heard his words, the expression in his eyes couldn’t help but change.

“It’s only one step away from the true God.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“According to what you are saying now, his strength should surpass all the god kings in the

God warrior Realm.”

Zhu Long continued to speak.

“What does he want to do?”

Lin Xiu’s heart was also filled with shock.

At this level, even a god king can be easily crushed to death by him.

“eat you.”

At this time, Zhulong looked at Lin Xiu, and said lightly.

At this moment, a huge head began to appear from the space crack.

A giant.

There were many totem marks on his face.

“found it.”

He stared at Lin Xiu, and couldn’t help saying aloud.

At this time, his body slowly emerged from the space.

The whole body is huge.

“Huh? You also found the Zhu Long Tool Spirit?”

He stared at Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear, and immediately said.

“The sky is overcast!?”

The phantom of Zhu Long appeared. Looking at the giant, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

“Zhulong, your strength seems to be very weak.”

The giant stared at the phantom that Zhulong transformed into, and continued to speak.

Can he see it?!

Only Lin Xiu could see the phantom of Zhulong before, but now this person seems to be able to see it.

“He is Tianyin, a child who was taught by the true god before.”

Zhulong looked at this giant, and immediately said to Lin Xiu.

As soon as Zhulong finished speaking, he stared at Tianyin and continued: “Tianyin, he is the inheritor of the true god. What do you want to do?”

“Inheritor of the true god? A joke.”

His voice was very loud, as if it had been transmitted to the entire earth.

“I’d like to see what kind of true god strength he obtained…”

Tian Yin laughed grimly.

He reached out and was about to grab Lin Xiu’s body.

Whoosh—

The moment his hand grabbed it, Lin Xiu’s body disappeared immediately.

He caught nothing at all.

Lin Xiu, who dodged to the other side, couldn’t help but feel a moment of fear at this moment.

At that moment just now, the speed of this guy’s capture was really too fast.

Logically speaking, with his size, his speed cannot be too fast.

But just at that moment, he almost couldn’t escape.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s figure instantly reached Luo Yue’s side.

The power of the Spatial magic Cube was released, instantly breaking a space beside it.

“Go back to the God warrior Realm first.”

“This guy is hard to deal with.”

Lin Xiu now clearly senses that this giant called Tianyin obviously wants to devour him.

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and was a little hesitant.

This battle is obviously the most dangerous in history.

“Don’t worry, nothing will happen.”

“Hm.”

At this time, Luo Yue didn’t hesitate, and stepped directly into the space crack.

Because she knows that if she is here now, it will only distract Lin Xiu.

“Don’t worry, my target is only you.”

At this moment, Tianyin’s voice continued to come over.
