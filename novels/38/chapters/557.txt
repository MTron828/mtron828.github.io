Chapter 558: Level 37!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

And killing this middle-aged man, he also gained 5 billion experience.

Now he has reached level 37! This upgrade speed was like riding a rocket.

If this was always the case, he would probably be able to reach the level of a rank 8 warrior in a short time.

But this was just a thought, how could it be so easy.

Moreover, he was still a bit far from becoming a rank 8 warrior.

Now he had a total of 108 potential points.

Lin Xiu pondered for a while; now that his strength and physique were almost the same, how about... increasing his speed?

With this thought, Lin Xiu allocated 50 attribute points to Speed, making his speed 308 points.

The rest was added to Physique.

As soon as the potential points were added, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that his body felt a little lighter and had a sense of comfort.

Oh right, he had to find his weapon!

Lin Xiu began to swim around, looking for the Dark Edge spear he threw from the cliff.

After searching for about half an hour, Lin Xiu found his Dark Edge spear and also found his backpack full of the forelimbs of the color-changing mantis.

This is not bad.

After all, the forelimbs of this color-changing mantis were a little difficult to collect and the value of this thing was also high.

Hu—

Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief as he carried his backpack and Dark Edge spear to the riverbank.

Although being underwater didn’t have a huge impact on him, he still liked being on land.

The warm sunlight shone on Lin Xiu’s body, making Lin Xiu feel very comfortable.

But at this moment, a screeching sound came over. Looking up, those huge bird-type evolved beasts rushed towards Lin Xiu at this moment!

“Humph!”

These bird evolved beasts were undoubtedly brought by the rank 8 warrior. Looking at them rushing over at this time, Lin Xiu snorted coldly, then slammed the Dark Edge spear in his right hand and suddenly flaming birds burst out from the tip of Lin Xiu’s spear.

The power of the flaming bird seemed to be getting more and more terrifying as Lin Xiu’s strength becomes stronger.

The flaming birds gathered together in the air, forming a fire phoenix and pounced directly on those bird evolved beasts.

In a short moment, the bird evolved beasts were all scorched, then fell into the bottom of the river.

However, one of the bird evolved beasts dodged, glared at Lin Xiu, then fluttered its wings and left.

Although Lin Xiu wanted to kill the last bird evolved beast, it flew away too fast and Lin Xiu didn’t have wings, so he couldn’t chase it at all.

“Forget it.” Lin Xiu shook his head and glanced at the surroundings. There were cliffs on both sides and there was no place to stand except where he was at.

There was no way of going to the top.

It seems that if you want to leave, you can only swim through the river.

Lin Xiu didn’t think much about it, he took the Dark Edge spear in his hand and plunged into the river.

After swimming along this river for an unknown amount of time, Lin Xiu finally swam to the shore again.

After passing through a forest, Lin Xiu found that he had arrived at the entrance to the Thunder Valley before he knew it.

“I see, you can go out from here…” Lin Xiu also suddenly realized at this time. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Because of the sunlight, Lin Xiu’s body was completely dry now.

“Have you heard? The Thunder Corp has found a space crack!”

As soon as Lin Xiu walked out, he heard the warrior standing in the marble archway at the entrance of the Thunder Valley, discussing something.

“Yes, I also heard that they hunted down a huge space creature!”

“This is a space creature ah. The materials on their bodies should be able to sell for a lot of money!”

When Lin Xiu heard their words, he couldn’t help but snicker secretly. The most useful energy body, the energy of Fire Lotus has been absorbed by him. What use are those evolved beasts from different dimensions?

“They’re out, the people from the Thunder Corp!”

At this time, some warriors seemed to see something and exclaimed.

Lin Xiu stood aside and looked very ordinary so not many people paid attention to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s eyes also looked to the front and he saw a crowd of people in black coming out from the entrance.

A huge black evolved beast was being carried out by more than a dozen warriors.

Taking a closer look, this evolved beast was like a huge beetle and its forelimbs were like two sickles, with a lot of blood on them.

At this time, as those people carried it and walked forward, the blood kept dripping on the ground.

It seems that these people really found the space crack...

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes when he saw this scene.

This evolved beast was obviously the huge evolved beast that came out of the space crack. At that time, Lao Bai and Wan Lu were both dealing with this evolved beast, so they gave him the opportunity to devour the thunder lotus fire.

“Get out of the way!”

As they approached, all the people around were driven away.

Lin Xiu, who was standing by the side, wanted to leave, but at this moment, Lin Xiu found out that Lin Lang and the others were following behind.

But they looked like they were in a difficult situation and there were also a few burly men who seem to be watching over them.

They lowered their heads and seemed very down.

“Senior!”

Just as they continued to walk forward, one guy among Lin Lang and the others looked up and saw Lin Xiu standing in front.

Hearing his voice, Lin Xiu smiled helplessly.

However, these people obviously regarded him as a year 3 or 4 student.

When Lin Lang and the others heard his words, they all raised their heads to look at Lin Xiu, their eyes filled with surprise.

They didn’t expect that they would find Lin Xiu at this time.

“What are you doing standing there! Walk!”

The burly warriors standing beside them looked at them and pushed them violently, then said aloud.

“What are you doing!”

Seeing his classmate being pushed to the ground, Lin Lang immediately got angry and shouted at him.

“Yo? Boy, do you know your current situation?”

The strong man looked at Lin Lang and instead of getting angry, he laughed.

“If you’re not going to be obedient and tell us what exactly did you guys get, you guys… can just stay in Black Rock City forever!”

A man said coldly.

“What’s going on?” Lin Xiu came over at this time and said to Lin Lang.

After all, they were from the same school.. Since they met here, Lin Xiu couldn’t ignore them.
