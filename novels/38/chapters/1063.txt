Chapter 1064: Silence

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Hmm….. ‘Silence’ huh?”

As Lin Xiu walked out of the bar, he muttered to himself.

This warrior skills one of the top three of the Ye family which meant that it was definitely a powerful one.

There must be a long line of warriors waiting to get their hands on this skill.

The Ice Dragon that he mentioned must also be a difficult evolved beast to deal with.

!!

Otherwise, the man behind this wouldn’t have used such a legendary skill as the bounty.

However, Lin Xiu was more curious to who this man might be. Who was it? He was using the Ye family’s skill as the bounty. Wasn’t he afraid that the Bai family would be coming for him?

He thought about it on the way and finally reached the hotel that he had booked earlier.

After getting into his room, he took out the gold box.

He opened the gold box and the White Lotus Flame was sitting inside it.

As he opened the box, the entire surrounding suddenly felt cold.

This was such a weird flame.

Lin Xiu thought that it was a little peculiar as he stared at the flame.

What was he supposed to do with it? Should he swallow it or…?

Lin Xiu sat cross-legged on the ground and hesitated for a moment before touching the flame.

It’s cold!

As soon as he placed his hand on the flame , he could feel the frost that came from it.

However, it was then replaced by a scorching heat.

The first came along with the heat. It was indeed peculiar.

Luckily for Lin Xiu, his body has been remodelled and he had resistance against fire. Plus, he also had the Heart of Frost which prevented his finger from being burnt by the flame.

However, the finger that touched the flame slowly turned grey which was unexpected.

As the saying goes, the fingers are directly linked to the heart. With his fingers turning grey, he could feel the intense pain that was coming from his finger.

He took a deep breath and tried to bear the pain coming from it. Then, he slowly guided the energy of the White Lotus Flame from his finger over to his forearm. Then, he slowly moved them to his arm and later, entered into his body.

“Foreign energy detected. ‘Rage’ activated…”

The computer generated voice from the system appeared announcing the notification.

With the help of ‘Rage’, the energy from the White Lotus Flame were slowly being absorbed by Lin Xiu’s body.

Damn!

As the energy from the White Lotus Flame was slowly being absorbed, Lin Xiu could feel an intense cold accompanied with the heat travelling all over his body.

He was feeling both intense cold and heat which made it terribly painful for Lin Xiu.

However, even with that happening, Lin Xiu was still trying his best to control the energy from the White Lotus Flame. He kept absorbing its energy into his body.

With each seconds and minutes that went by, Lin Xiu remained seated on the ground as he finished absorbing all the energy from it.

“Hu….”

In the end, when Lin Xiu finally absorbed all of the energy from the flame, Lin Xiu sighed.

He was now drenched in sweat.

He fell onto the ground, feeling completely exhausted.

“That…was tiring.”

Lin Xiu didn’t think that it hurt that much to absorb the energy from the White Lotus Flame.

Fortunately, he had been through things that were even more painful and now, this was nothing for Lin Xiu.

He took a look into his system and noticed that not only has his strength has increased, even his EXP increased by 10%. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

This was great news for Lin Xiu.

He looked outside the window and noticed that the sky was getting bright.

Lin Xiu did not expect that he would take the entire night to absorb the energy of the White Lotus Flame.

“This flame is indeed odd…”

Lin Xiu summoned the White Lotus Flame and it instantly appeared in its palm. As he stared at the flame, he mumbled to himself.

No one would have thought that bone-piercing cold could be associated with flames.

Anyone would have associated heat with flames instead.

Lin Xiu shook his head and put away the thought in his head.

Since he had completely absorbed it, he could easily control the flame with his mind. With one slight move, the flame would appear right in the center of his palm.

He could also control the strength of the flame with his source energy.

After washing up and changing into a new set of clothes, Lin Xiu left the hotel.

Since ‘Silence’ had appeared, Lin Xiu had to get his hands on it.

He only had to wait for another day before meeting at the address given on the invitation card.

As for today, he would take a look at the Bai family.

Lin Xiu thought about it and he narrowed his eyes subconsciously.

He was walking on the streets of Bai Di City and Lin Xiu could feel that all of the warriors in this city were much stronger than those in the other city.

They were stronger by quite a lot.

There were respected warriors everywhere and there were even a couple of sage warriors on the same street.

When Lin Xiu noticed this, he was beyond shocked.

The entire Bai Di City was strong. If he were to really fight the Bai family, it would be quite difficult for him to conquer this place.

It wasn’t a far journey for him to get to where the Bai family was located.

Soon, Lin Xiu could see that there were tall walls right at a distance and the entire area was secluded.

“This is a private property of the Bai family. Admission has to be permitted.”

There were lots of warriors gathering around the tall walls.

If he guessed it correctly, these warriors came because of the rumours, wanting to see the legendary Bai family.

Lin Xiu stood with them as well and looked into the distance. From behind the tall wall, there was a huge empty piece of land and a mountain peak in the center of it.

There were lots of buildings seen on the top and base of the mountain.

The important members of the Bai family must be staying in the buildings on the top of the mountain.

The walls built around it were far away from the peak of the mountain. The entire area here belonged to the Bai family.

The Bai family was indeed a powerful family.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

Plus, this was only just a branch of the Bai family and they were already so powerful. As for the main family, they had occupied the entire city which meant that they would be even more powerful.

“I’ll have a look up there.”

Since the Bai family was the most influential family here on this planet, most of the warriors were curious about it.

One of them who was foreign to this city suddenly floated into the air.

He was attempting to jump over the wall.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Then, there was a loud explosion that covered the entire sky.

The warriors one the ground then noticed that there were a large number of laser rays that came out of nowhere.

They were all directly headed towards the warrior that was in the sky!

“Leave!”

The warrior noticed the laser rays as well and was enraged. Then, he released his ‘sphere’.
