Chapter 59: Imminent Peril – ‘Profound Intent: Torrential Storm Of Rose Flowers!’

The blade of the giant black sword had a glint on it.

The sound of it cutting through the air kept ringing.

Looking at Lin Xiu, who seemed like he needed to lean against the wall to steady himself, Zhou Diaoyu couldn’t help but reveal a cunning smile.

It’s all over!

Lin Xiu looked at Zhou Diaoyu who was charging over and gripped the spear even tighter with his right hand. His five fingers were like steel, grasping it tightly.

He couldn’t die, he couldn’t die here!

With his strong will to survive, Lin Xiu’s blood began to boil.

At this moment, Zhou Diaoyu’s tall figure had already appeared before Lin Xiu. With his hands gripping the black giant sword tightly, his veins had bulged out.

With him in the center, a strong gust of wind rose around and dust was blown off the ground.

Witnessing this powerful sense of oppression, even Li Yi and the others who were a distance away felt stifled like they couldn’t breathe properly.

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted, and in the blink of an eye, he calmed himself down.

While the winds intertwined with each other, they produced a bright light.

Oh right, this was what he saw before…

Just as Zhou Diaoyu was about to attack, he saw that Lin Xiu had a look of surprise and couldn’t help but frown, then quickly reverted back to normal.

No matter what, he was dead meat!!!

“Dodge it! Lin Xiu!!!” Li Yi roared loudly.

This blow, if he didn’t dodge it, even if he’s strong, it would crush his bones!!!

Xu Wen was stunned at this moment because he realized that Lin Xiu seemed to be… laughing?

“I’ll show you… what is the true ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’.” Lin Xiu bellowed. He didn’t dodge and directly thrust his spear out instead!

A silver glint flashed and everyone saw many illusions appear in an instant.

Zhou Diaoyu, who was brandishing his giant sword in the air and was about to attack down, heard a loud ‘bang’. His hands were still in the air as he stood on the ground.

“What kind of skill is this!?” Zhou Diaoyu’s hands appeared to be frozen and he was still holding the black giant sword, about to wave it down.

“‘Profound intent: Torrential storm of rose flowers!'” yelled Lin Xiu indifferently.

Zhou Diaoyu’s pupils suddenly constricted, followed by a series of loud sounds.

Countless stab wounds appeared on Zhou Diaoyu’s body. At the same time, fresh blood was gushing out of them.

“叮~~~”

“Ding~~~”

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 3 warrior. You’ve gained…”

Before Lin Xiu finished listening to the voice in his head, his eyes darkened suddenly and he fainted on the ground directly.

He was not sure how long had gone by, and all Lin Xiu felt was the pain on his head. He shook his head hard and opened his eyes slowly.

He was still lying in a room.

On closer inspection, the decoration in the room seemed a little familiar.

“Eh? Lin Xiu, you’re awake?”At this moment, a familiar voice came from the side and he took a closer look – isn’t he Li Yi?

Oh right, he killed Zhou Diaoyu previously and because of the after-effects of ‘Fury’, coupled with the injuries on his body, he fainted.

Wait, how much experience did he gain from killing Zhou Diaoyu?

He instinctively got the stats board out:

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: Level 15

Experience: 85,994 (3,599,984 experience points required for the next level)

Strength: 148

Physique: 89

Speed: 65

Skill: An Analytic Eye, Fury

Rage build-up: 0/100

Overall combat strength: 1,249

Potential points: 15

“Hahaha, level 15, I’m finally level 15!” Lin Xiu jumped and shouted with joy.

After so long, he finally reached this dividing line.

And at this moment, he also saw a message icon flashing next to the stats board.

It seems that I still have many notifications that I haven’t looked at.

“Lin Xiu… hasn’t lost his mind, has he?” Li Yi saw this scene and his jaw dropped as he mumbled to himself.

“Cough, cough.” Lin Xiu then noticed Li Yi at the side and immediately smiled. “Li Yi, are we on the airship now?”

“Yup, you’ve been asleep all day.” Seeing that Lin Xiu seemed to have reverted back to normal, Li Yi said with a sigh of relief.

“Lin Xiu? He’s awake?” Just then, a sound rang out as the automatic door opened and Xu Wen walked in directly, then exclaimed in surprise.

“Yeah.”

“We’re on the way back already and would be reaching Xing Yao City pretty soon. Your weapon and the android is outside.” Xu Wen nodded and took a silver card out of his pocket, then handed it to Lin Xiu.

“This is…” Lin Xiu looked at the card and was taken aback.

“It’s the reward you got for killing Shadow and Zhou Diaoyu. I applied for it on your behalf and it was approved. There are 3 million union coins inside,” Xu Wen said with a smile.

3 million!?

Lin Xiu was a little surprised, then he remembered that those two men were warriors that the federal government had a bounty for.

With this money, he could get new equipment.

“By the way, what’s the date today?” After the surprise, Lin Xiu suddenly recalled that it was quite close to the end-of-term exam period. If he didn’t rush back in time, he would fail this term!

“12.” Li Yi was slightly taken aback and answered. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“12!?” Wasn’t it today! Oh no, if he didn’t hurry back, he would be in trouble.

“Don’t panic, it’s four o’clock in the morning now, and you’ll be able to get to Xing Yao City in two hours.” Xu Wen patted Lin Xiu on the shoulder and said.

“Gather!!!”

Just then, a loud voice rang out from a loudspeaker at the side.

“The instructor wants us to gather, quick!” Hearing this voice, Xu Wen’s face became serious.

“Lin Xiu, do you want to rest more?” Li Yi was about to go out too and said to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu shook his head. “I’m fine.”

He followed the two of them out and saw a lot of soldiers standing outside.

Compared to a month ago, these people were obviously much darker, and their faces were full of determination.

Soon, everyone lined up and stood in two rows.

There were only 18 people left in the original team of 40 people.

Those 22 people, needless to say, must have perished.

“Well, is everyone here?” Qin Qiang walked over from the other side, and there were two other instructors beside him.

The two instructors were holding two black boxes in their hands.
