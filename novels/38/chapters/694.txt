Chapter 695 Advance to Rank 9!

Lu Jiang never imagined that his own skill would attack him in reverse! “What!!!”

With a loud roar, his source strength mobilized frantically and he wanted to use his ‘Sphere’ to block the cross sword aura.

This was originally an extremely powerful blow he unleashed, but now it was not so easy for him to resist.

Boom

As the cross sword aura hit his ‘Sphere’, there was a loud noise.

The violent impact even broke through his ‘Sphere’, and the cross sword aura directly cut Lu Jiang’s body into four pieces.

Blood splattered all over the ground in an instant.

“Lu… Lu Jiang is dead!?” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

When the rest of the people saw this scene, their eyes were filled with disbelief.

Lu Jiang, such a powerful warrior, ranked seventh on the Tianjiao list, actually died just like that!?

Not only the surrounding warriors, but Qian Jin, who has been paying attention to the situation, can’t help but open his eyes wide when he saw this.

He saw the scene just now. Lu Jiang unleashed his most powerful move, but Lin Xiu bounced it back!

How was this done? Simply unheard of.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing a rank 9 warrior and gaining experience…”

A series of prompting sounds for gaining experience suddenly sounded in his mind, but the amount of experience was too long, and Lin Xiu didn’t care about it at first, but in the next moment, a large number of prompts came. “Congratulations to the master for successfully upgrading! The current level is 45!”

“Congratulations, master, you have advanced to the rank 9 warrior!” “Congratulations to the master for acquiring the new skill – ‘Golden Body Immortality’!”

A large number of system prompts kept coming out, which surprised Lin Xiu.

Rank 9! I have really been promoted to a rank 9 warrior!

Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the strength he had just used in the battle seemed to be fully recovered at this moment.

Ignoring those who were shocked in the audience, Lin Xiu went directly to the system in his mind to check his attributes:

Level: 45

Experience point: 0/5000000000000

Strength: 1420

Physique: 860

Speed: 600

Skills:[Analytic Eye](Fury][Disguise][Engulf] [Mirror Image][Heavenly Array][Reset][Power of the Stars][Golden Body Immortality

Rage build-up: 0/100

Potential Points: 45

Title: Rank 8 warrior (unused titles: Rank 1 warrior, Rank 2 warrior, Rank 3 warrior, Rank 4 warrior, Rank 5 warrior, Rank 6 warrior, Rank 7 warrior, Rank 9 warrior)

Lin Xiu checked the new warrior title, the effect of the rank 9 warrior title could inherit the effect of the original title, and has a new skill: ‘Bloodthirsty’: 1% of the damage caused to the enemy will restore his own strength.

Only 1%?

Lin Xiu was a little depressed, but this was a very good skill.

He went to check the ‘Golden Body Immortality’, this skill was immune to all damage for the duration of one second!!!

It might just be a short second but during a battle, this second is fatal!

This skill is insane!

However, it is a pity that the cooling time is a bit long, and it takes a full week!

At this time, he came back to his senses and looked at the competition stage. Lu Jiang’s body had already been taken away by the staff.

“Is there anyone else?”

Lin Xiu glanced at everyone in the audience, and then said lightly.

This time, no one dared to say anything.

The strength that Lin Xiu showed just now has already explained everything. Even the rank 9 warrior, Lu Jiang, who was seventh on the Tianjiao list, was beheaded by Lin Xiu, and these people got even less confident.

At this time, many warriors had already left here and turned to other competition platforms.

“You know this guy?”

At the same time, a man looked at Qian Jin who was standing on the competition stage, and said indifferently. “Forget it, there was a little misunderstanding just now.”

Qian Jin looked at the man under the stage, then smiled and said.

The man who spoke to Qian Jin was Jiang Lin, who ranked third on the Tianjiao list. He was surprised to find Lin Xiu’s existence.

And looking at Qian Jin’s eyes, it seemed that he and Lin Xiu know each other.

“Do you think that with his strength, he can defeat Wu Changkong?”

Jiang Lin said with a sneer.

“Not necessarily.”

Qian Jin smiled and didn’t say much.

“That boy, he can’t be happy for long.” Jiang Lin glanced at Lin Xiu over there, and said coldly.

“If you think he can’t do it, you can go up and challenge him.”

Qian Jin looked at him, then smiled.

Hearing Qian Jin’s words, Jiang Lin’s face suddenly turned a little nasty.

If he goes up now, even if he wins against Lin Xiu, what he will face next is Wu Changkong.

After losing to Wu Changkong, he will be completely withdrawn from the Tianjiao list, and he had no chance to go to Fengyun City.

After all, the rule of this competition was that on these ten competition stages, the one who stands at the end is the winner.

“Humph!”

Jiang Lin snorted coldly at this time, and then jumped to the other side of the competition stage.

He would not do anything he was not sure about.

“It looks like no one else?”

Lin Xiu looked at the warriors under the stand, then sat directly on the ground, then closed his eyes.

“Brother Lin, he is really too strong…”

Chen Lan and the others are now dumbfounded.

The battle just happened just for a moment, and a strong man on the Tianjiao list was defeated.

Lin Xiu, how much power is he hiding?

“Haha, I just said Brother Lin would definitely win!”

Lei Tong was also very happy at this time. Those people from Marqi Planet who looked down on them, the people on earth, were beaten in the face.

The warriors sitting around Lei Tong were also silent at this time.

“Hmph, don’t be complacent, wait for Wu Changkong to come over, this kid is still going to die.”

Some of the audience sitting in the back said coldly at this time.

“This top person on the Tianjiao list is really so strong?”

Lei Tong frowned and said to Chen Lan beside him.

“Very strong, I think Brother Lin should be a rank 9 warrior but the top warrior on the Tianjiao list is a Master Warrior!”

Chen Lan said this, still very excited.

Lei Tong had heard before that there were many powerhouses on this Marqi planet, and rank 9 is considered to be just a step into the ranks of the powerhouses, and the warrior was even more powerful than a rank 9 warrior. “It’s a little troublesome now…”

Lei Tong is also a little worried now.

After all, on Earth, the most powerful was the rank 9 warrior. As for the existence that is stronger than the rank 9 warrior, he has never even heard of one, let alone seen one before.

“He’s coming! He’s coming!”

At this moment, an excited voice broke out from the crowd.
