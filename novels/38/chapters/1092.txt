Chapter 1093: Finally Getting the Orchid of Heaven

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu shook his head and stopped thinking about how to get onto the next level.

He quickly flew back to the ground.

As the flame dragon died, the body of it seemed to be turning soft.

Lin Xiu raised the long spear above its head and gave it a clean chop.

Blood went everywhere and the dragon’s head broke apart.

Soon, Lin Xiu kept the red odd crystal into his pocket.

After getting rid of the flame dragon, Lin Xiu continued his journey.

He continued walking toward where the flame dragon appeared.

There was a dim, green light that he saw next to the cave from where the flame dragon flew out. It was coming from the border between ice and fire.

When Lin Xiu saw what it was, his eyes widened in shock.

This…would it be the Orchid of Heaven?

When he thought about it, Lin Xiu felt excited. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

He was about to get his hands on the Orchid of Heaven that he had been looking for.

The excitement from it caused his entire body to be trembling.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and got himself to calm down.

Then, he slowly walked forward to where the light was coming from.

The scorching heat that was coming from the sea of fire was making Lin Xiu’s body uncomfortable.

Even when his body was already resistant to fire, it was still the same.

Lin Xiu released the energy from his body and it slowly turned into an energy suit that wrapped around Lin Xiu’s body.

With the energy protecting his body, Lin Xiu finally felt that the scorching pain from the flames were getting lesser.

He took another deep breath and walked into the sea of fire.

As he continued walking into the sea of fire, Lin Xiu could clearly feel a burning sensation all over his body.

The pain of it was getting so strong that Lin Xiu gritted his teeth.

As he entered into the sea of fire, Lin Xiu could clearly see that there was a dim, green light on the ground.

He quickly activated the Analytical Eye and Lin Xiu could clearly read the information from it.

It was the Orchid of Heaven!

It was truly the Orchid of Heaven!

Lin Xiu tried his best to suppress his emotions as he got closer to the flower.

The Orchid of Heaven looked like a normal plant with green leaves but the green light around it looked peculiar.

Although he was now surrounded by the flames, Lin Xiu could feel a cold air coming from the flower.

“Here you are…”

Lin Xiu had ignored all of the cold and heat coming from around him. He bent forward and stared at the Orchid of Heaven. He was feeling incredibly anxious.

After taking another deep breath, Lin Xiu pulled out a box from his pocket.

This was a gold box, the same one that kept the White Lotus Flame.

Since this was a unique box, it would not be burnt or melted by the terrifying flames around him.

There was only a mild burning sensation.

Bakk – –

Lin Xiu opened the box and slowly got closer to the flower.

Soon, Lin Xiu slowly pulled out the Orchid of Flower from its roots and placed it inside the gold box.

Hu – –

As he looked at the Orchid of Heaven that was inside the box, Lin Xiu uncontrollably took another deep breath.

Finally, he finally found it.

Lin Xiu quickly closed the box and held onto it tightly.

It was as if Lin Xiu could see Luo Yue’s face right now and there was a warm, gentle look in her eyes.

“I think….the rest of them have died inside.”

At the same time, by the entrance of the Road to Ice and Fire, there was a sage warrior who spoke to Yu Tu who sent them here.

Elder Gong and 6 remaining sage warriors were sitting inside the plane.

“Let’s wait a little longer.”

“Other than those whom you witnessed, there are still 6-7 of them that have not returned.”

“It could be possible that they killed the frost dragon.”

Yu Tu thought about it before saying.

Although the possibilities of it were not that high.

“I think so too that the frost dragon might have been defeated.”

Elder Gong sat on the other end and spoke after thinking about it for a while.

He suddenly thought of Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu might be young but the skills that he had shown were indeed powerful.

Plus, Lin Xiu was one of them that did not leave back then.

Elder Gong had a feeling that Lin Xiu would kill the frost dragon.

“Elder Gong, you’ve overestimated their abilities. The frost dragon is so powerful. They wouldn’t have the chance.”

One of the sage warriors, who had witnessed the power of the frost dragon, shook his head and spoke out loud.

As he thought of the scene that happened during the fight, he was still looking frightened.

“That’s right. Let’s leave now. If the frost dragon comes after us…”

As for the rest of the sage warriors, they nodded their heads in agreement as well.

They were reminded of how scary the dragon was and the look in their eyes were changing drastically.

“Fine.”

Yu Tu kept quiet for a moment before agreeing with them.

Although he was not there personally, the looks on these sage warriors’ faces were enough to show how scary the frost dragon must have been.

It has to be noted that there were 20 sage warriors who entered the Road of Ice and Fire!

Sage warriors were already the strongest people here on Nano Planet.

“Eh?”

Just as Yu Tu was heading towards the cockpit to start the engine, he saw something through the window and his eyes were stretched wide.

Lin Xiu! It was Lin Xiu that was standing right in front of him.

“What’s wrong?”

Elder Gong noticed that Yu Tu was standing by the window and he asked out of curiosity.

As Elder Gong got closer, he could clearly see that it was Lin Xiu.

When Lin Xiu saw that it was Yu Tu and Elder Gong staring at him from the window, he waved his arms.

“He….he’s back?”

The rest of the sage warriors were shocked as well.

Although Lin Xiu was a powerful man, all of them had thought that Lin Xiu had died inside the mouth of the frost dragon.

But now, Lin Xiu’s back!

Yu Tu pressed one of the buttons on the plane and the doors instantly opened.

A flight of stairs slowly descended.

“Welcome back.”

Yu tu smiled as he looked at Lin Xiu.

“Thank you.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and went into the plane.

“You…..killed the frost dragon?”

Elder Gong looked at Lin Xiu who got into the plane. He couldn’t wait any longer and he had to ask Lin Xiu.

After hearing what Elder Gong asked, all of them turned to look at Lin Xiu.

All of them were waiting for an answer from him.

“Yes.”

Lin Xiu had a small smile on his face as he answered.

The rest of the sage warriors on the plane were all surprised after hearing Lin Xiu’s answer.

“Indeed, heroes come from amongst the youth.”

Elder Gong let out a bitter laugh.

There were so many of them but they couldn’t kill the frost dragon but Lin Xiu was able to do so!

How did he do it?!
