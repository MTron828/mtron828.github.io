“There won’t be another spider, will there?” Li Yi looked at that huge spider carcass that had fallen to the ground.

“Close your big mouth!” Lin Xiu glared at him and said.

He picked up that black spider’s carcass but realized that there wasn’t any Odd Crystal.

Could it be because these things were the product of nuclear contamination, so they were different from evolved beasts and didn’t have any Odd Crystal?

It was a bit of a disappointment for Lin Xiu.

The stairs weren’t wide and could only fit three people side by side, it really looked a bit crowded.

And it was very hard for Lin Xiu to wave his long spear in a place like this.

“Spiders... Spider!” Just as they were about to go up to the third floor, a soldier seemed to see something and got a fright.

Even his voice was shaking.

Spider?

Lin Xiu walked to the front and saw a large number of spiders crawling on the wall, they were crawling toward them.

Why are there so many of them?

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted when he saw this scene.

And Li Yi covered his mouth, thinking that he really jinxed it – whatever he said actually came true.

The size of these spiders was no different from the one they saw just now, and they looked terrifying.

“Shoot quickly!” Xu Wen’s expression changed when he saw this and quickly reacted.

At this moment, everyone quickly took out their laser guns when they heard him. If they went into close combat with this type of large-scale evolved beast, they could get entangled in their bodies easily and it would be very troublesome.

“Here you go!” Xu Wen looked at Lin Xiu and saw that he did not carry a laser gun, so he tossed the laser pistol that the dead soldier was carrying over to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu did not stand on ceremony and simply took it. He carried the Silver Immortal Soul spear in his left hand and held the laser pistol on his right as he shot at the spiders!

A series of laser rays kept shooting out, and a large number of giant black spiders were killed.

The eight people continued to shoot, and more than half the spiders that were coming from that corridor were dead.

After pulling the trigger crazily for some time, those spiders along the corridor were finally all dead.

There were black spider carcasses all over the ground and looking at them gave one goosebumps.

“Xu Wen, do we have to keep going up there?” It wasn’t easy to get rid of all those spiders and everyone was a little tired.

At this moment, a soldier asked Xu Wen.

Xu Wen became silent. If they continued to walk up and encountered any weird creatures, they would be in trouble. Right now, nobody was in great condition and they must take a quick rest.

But it was obviously not a good place to rest, and they weren’t sure if those zombies would catch up to them...

“Keep going.” Lin Xiu put the laser gun in the pocket behind his pants and said as he walked upstairs.

“But upstairs…” The soldier frowned and was about to say something when he heard banging from that iron door below.

It must be that those zombies had caught up and were constantly hitting the iron door below!

“Let’s go!”

At this moment, no one objected and directly followed Lin Xiu upstairs.

There were a lot of cobwebs in the whole building and they should be made by those black spiders.

Lin Xiu made a slash upwards with his long spear and with a slight use of skill, a flame was released in an instant.

Those cobwebs caught fire, and soon, all the cobwebs in the corridor began to slowly disappear with the fire burning. Those small spiders and spider eggs on the webs were all burned by the fire.

“Finally, there are no spiders.” Li Yi patted his chest and said.

Although these spiders were not too difficult to deal with, there were many of them and just looking at them was disgusting.

They continued going upstairs and didn’t encounter anything strange which allowed everyone to heave a sigh of relief.

“Bang!” Lin Xiu kicked open the locked iron door leading to the roof.

In an instant, the glaring sunlight shone on everyone’s bodies.

“I’m so tired!” Their tensed emotions could finally be at ease, and those soldiers couldn’t help but lay on the ground and rest comfortably.

“Let’s restore some energy here first.” Xu Wen also sat on the ground, then took out a packet of special compressed biscuits from his pocket to eat.

Before setting off, everyone took a lot of iron rations, which provided a lot of energy and was very small and easy to carry.

The so-called iron rations of the former world simply could not be compared with those in the future world.

Lin Xiu also took out some iron rations from his pocket to replenish some physical strength. Then, he stood at the edge of the roof to look down and found that in the area below, there were still a large number of zombies.

And at this moment, there was a giant evolved beast in the middle, and it was biting the zombies and tearing them up.

As soon as the analytical eye was activated, Lin Xiu found that the beast below was only a rank 2 Sabertooth Hound; it was very large in size, and its body was also very flexible.

As its claws waved, several zombies were killed in an instant.

But there were so many zombies that the Sabertooth Hound was soon surrounded by zombies.

As the saying goes, ‘No matter how big elephants are, they are still afraid of ants.’

That’s because when the number of ants reached a certain point, they would be able to tear the whole elephant into shreds.

And now the same was true; that ferocious Sabertooth Hound quickly tore the zombies up, and within minutes, a huge skeleton appeared.

Lin Xiu could not help but gasp when he saw this. If they continued to fight just now, this could possibly be their outcome.

Only now did he understand the dangers of this task.

He continued looking and found that the Odd Crystal seemed to be swallowed by a zombie.

Zombies also devour Odd Crystals!?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu pupils constricted as he stared at the zombie that devoured the Odd Crystal.

The zombie’s body, which was originally a little thin and frail, appeared to change after devouring the Odd Crystal.

It became taller and stronger!

The Analytic Eye was activated. This was originally a rank 2 zombie, but now, it actually turned into rank 3 according to the Analytic Eye’s analysis!

‘I see! These zombies rely on devouring the Odd Crystals to evolve!’
