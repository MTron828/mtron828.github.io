Chapter 120: Ferocious Battle With The Female Warrior

This time, Lin Xiu did not wait for them to attack. He moved and arrived at the closest warrior!

The effect of Awe of the Phoenix weakened greatly under the rain, so Lin Xiu did not utilize it but instead used Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers that consumed less source strength and stamina!

Sou sou sou-

Following the sound, the man’s body became a honeycomb with holes all over.

“Use your skills and kill him!!!” The lady bellowed when she saw the scene.

The few men that had been swung away immediately charged forward. This time, all of them utilized their strongest skill against Lin Xiu!

They were all rank 2 warriors and not very strong, but even a rank 3 warrior would feel the immense threat when faced against several rank 2 warriors that used their strongest skills at the same time.

But that was for ordinary warriors…

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear tightly and unleashed ‘Adjudicate’!

All of their expressions changed as their bodies exploded at the same time. All of them had died together!

The woman opened her eyes wide when she saw the sight of them dying, her face filled with shock

‘What is going on?!’

She clearly sensed that Lin Xiu’s strength was that of a rank 1 initially, but the power that he had unleashed was clearly of someone above rank 3.

Just when she was sizing him up again, Lin Xiu sneered at her.

‘Seems like disguise is really effective, at least it attracts many detestable people to send themselves up for free experience points.’

“Hohoho.” The lady suddenly laughed as she extended her tongue to lick her dagger.

“Interesting, really interesting!” The lady was not only unafraid, but she was also excited.

Wasn’t killing always interesting?

Especially when it was to take down the head of a powerful warrior!

The lady exerted her full force and charged straight for Lin Xiu!

She was extremely fast!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened when he saw her speed.

The raindrops splattered on his body and a few had fallen into his eyes and obstructed his vision. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The lady’s figure seemed to transform into a few figures and caused his expression to turn grave.

‘Movement technique?!’

Lin Xiu swiped his right leg out and both hands fixed on the spear.

He spread his consciousness out to a range of 5 chi. He would discover anyone that stepped in.

Behind!

Lin Xiu squinted his eyes and suddenly stabbed his spear backwards!

Clang-

The speartip had struck her incoming dagger perfectly and the collision produced a clear metal ringing sound.

“Zeze, not too bad.” The lady revealed a strange smile and continued to brandish her daggers at Lin Xiu.

Clang clang clang-

Lin Xiu frowned, his vision was dampened by the pouring rain and the lady obviously relied on her speed. The Dark Edge spear was too heavy and had affected his own speed as well.

“Hmph!” Lin Xiu snorted and thrust out the spear, producing multiple black figures.

The lady’s eyes constricted. Right at that moment, she seemed to have turned into a shadow as she dodged the attacks.

Lin Xiu knew she was a rank 3 warrior from Analytic Eye and her stats were more balanced. She was not weaker in terms of strength but faster than him!

“Dragon Imprisonment slash!” The lady leaped backwards onto a tree and threw her daggers towards Lin Xiu!

The daggers suddenly increased in speed as they were approaching Lin Xiu and produced black mist at the same time. The black mist became dense and formed into two horrifying black dragon heads just as they approached Lin Xiu. They looked as though they wanted to devour him!

Lin Xiu felt the immense power and sucked in a breath of cold air. He twisted his body at a 90-degree angle.

The two daggers that transformed into dragonheads missed him but immediately turned backwards.

They became even faster as they chased after him!

Clang-

Lin Xiu unleashed his strength and struck one of the daggers down.

But the dagger did not fall to the ground and instead flew back up at him!

It was extremely fast, so fast that it surprised Lin Xiu.

It was as though it had many pivot points on all four directions as it fervently tried to attack him.

“Hahaha, the more power you put, the more powerful it becomes!” The lady laughed sinisterly.

Lin Xiu’s inattentiveness allowed one of the daggers to swipe past his neck. He immediately felt a burst of pain.

‘No, this can’t go on like this. The daggers will still get back up and attack me even faster no matter how they fall.’

‘It’s do or die!’

“I’ll just get rid of you first!” Lin Xiu ignored the daggers and charged straight for the lady!

He crouched down and sprung forward like a spring as he swung his spear midair toward her!

The lady was alarmed and immediately retreated just as his spear struck the gigantic azure blue tree trunk.

Bang-

The trunk ripped apart and the entire tree fell.

He held onto the spear tightly and continued to chase after her!

The lady’s body was extremely soft and leaped into the air with ease. She performed a roll in midair and grabbed onto the two daggers that had returned.

She landed on a tree trunk with her right feet and used the momentum to flip and charge back at Lin Xiu!

“Crescent moon slash!” The lady swung her daggers endlessly as she shot towards Lin Xiu and produced many crescent moon blades that were even capable of cutting through the raindrops.

Lin Xiu stood in his original position and stared straight at her. He held the body of the spear tightly, moved his right feet forward, and exerted force in his left. He activated all the source strength in his body at this moment!

“Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall!”
