Chapter 692 Replaced By Me

Lin Xiu raised his brows and he did not relax in the face of this warrior’s attack.

With the movement of the mind, the ‘Sphere’ unfolded instantly!

Boom boom boom —

The dark red ‘Sphere’ directly blocked all the sword aura that was coming.

“He… his ‘Sphere’, why is it dark red?”

Seeing this scene, the rest of the warriors couldn’t help showing extremely shocked expressions. Because for them, the ‘Sphere’ of ordinary warriors was white light. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Even Qian Jin’s expression changed slightly when he saw this scene.

“Who are you?”

At this time, Qian Jin was still holding a long sword and instead of attacking Lin Xiu, he said in a faint voice.

“Earthling.”

Lin Xiu looked at him without any fear.

Qian Jin’s eyes narrowed. Just when the surrounding warriors thought that the two would have a huge fight next, the “Sphere” that Lin Xiu and Qian Jin opened up disappeared at the same time in the next moment.

“Get to know each other, my name is Qian Jin.” Qian Jin walked up to Lin Xiu at this time, then stretched out his hand and smiled at Lin Xiu.

“Lin Xiu.”

Lin Xiu also shook hands with him, then said with a faint smile.

“You are the strongest Earthling I have ever seen.”

Qian Jin looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“I’ll apologize to them about what happened just now. I think we can be friends.”

“Maybe.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said aloud.

“Is this the end?”

The rest of the warriors who originally wanted to watch the fun, at this time, were full of disbelief.

Soon, Qian Jin left with those people and Lin Xiu also returned to Chen Lan and the others.

“Brother Lin, this guy admits he’s cowardly?”

Lei Tong said with a smile.

Just now, Qian Jin even brought the person who splashed the drink to apologize to Zhang Hu and Su Qiang, which was indeed a little unexpected.

“No.”

Lin Xiu shook his head. “I don’t know what he meant either.” From the battle just now, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that Qian Jin’s strength was also very strong and he has not yet exerted his full strength. The game was about to start and it was not a good time to fight now.

“Forget it, there is no need for Brother Lin to fight him. After all, the game will start soon.”

Chen Lan and the others said aloud at this time.

After all, Lin Xiu stood up for them, Qian Jin and others also apologized just now and the provocateur among them was also injured by Lin Xiu and now the matter has been settled.

Dang dang

Just at this point, a crisp sound suddenly sounded.

“Hey, what’s that sound?”

Lei Tong seemed to have heard something and looked around.

“The game is about to start.” After all, Chen Lan lives in Tianlong City and he came to his senses very quickly.

“Can we go see it together?” Lei Tong asked curiously.

“Of course you can, but you have to buy tickets first.”

Chen Lan nodded and said.

“Crap, we have to buy tickets.”

Lei Tong complained.

“I’ll get going first.”

Lin Xiu looked at the huge competition hall not far away. The next competition will be held in this competition hall.

To enter the competition hall, you can directly do it through the machine.

Because when he just signed up, all of Lin Xiu’s information had been recorded, so there was no need for a registration pass. In the next moment, Lin Xiu would be able to enter directly.

As soon as he entered, Lin Xiu felt it instinctively. There were many warriors around him looking at him.

These people’s pupils were all light blue pupils and they were of course surprised when they suddenly see a person with black pupils. “Tsk tsk, this year there are still people like this who came to sign up, they don’t know what they had signed up for.”

Some warriors looked at Lin Xiu and whispered.

Although their voices were very soft, Lin Xiu, who had sensitive ears, could still hear their words clearly.

Lin Xiu didn’t care about this.

The venue was very large and it was in the open. At this time, the warm sunlight shone down, causing Lin Xiu to close his eyes and take a deep breath.

Although the Marqi planet has two suns, Lin Xiu didn’t feel that the sun was very hot, instead he felt quite warm.

From the battle in Sky City to the arrival of Marqi Planet.

Everything felt as if they happened yesterday.

“I will find you and go back with you.”

Lin Xiu said to himself.

In the next moment, he opened his eyes and his eyes were full of fierceness.

Looking at the stage not far away, Lin Xiu jumped straight up.

“This competition platform is mine.”

Lin Xiu, who was standing on the competition stage, glanced at the crowd of warriors below and then said lightly. The rules of this competition in Tianlong City were very simple. There were ten warrior platforms around and on each platform, the last warrior standing at the end is the winner.

“Boy, do you know where you are standing?” A warrior below, looking at Lin Xiu’s “arrogant” appearance, immediately said with a sneer.

“This is the first competition stage, that is, the ‘head stage’.”

“You want to snatch Wu Changkong’s position at the top of the Tianjiao list? What a joke.”

These competition stages were all numbered, which was also the basis for the ranking of the ten people on the Tianjiao list.

Anyone who wanted to take the place of someone on the Tianjiao list would challenge them on different competition platforms.

“I see.”

Lin Xiu nodded as if he finally understood.

“Boy, now you know it’s wrong, just get off obediently!”

“That’s right, when Wu Changkong comes over, this kid’s death will be ugly.”

“A fool who doesn’t know his own strength…”

The surrounding warriors all burst into laughter at this time.

Looking at Lin Xiu standing on the competition stage, it seemed like the funniest joke.

“So…”

“Today, let me replace the number one position on the Tianjiao list.”

Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear hit the ground, his sharp eyes glanced at the crowd below the competition stage and he said confidently. “This earthling is interesting.”

As soon as Qian Jin walked into the arena, he saw Lin Xiu over there. Hearing his words, Qian Jin couldn’t help but laugh out loud.

“This kid, he’s stupid.”

The men who followed Qian Jin just now looked at Lin Xiu over there and couldn’t help sneering.

They were very upset with Lin Xiu just now, but for some reason, Qian Jin asked himself and others to apologize. “No, I have a feeling that sanctimonious guy, Wu Changkong, might be replaced by him.” Qian Jin shook his head and said.

“Boy, before Wu Changkong comes, I’ll help him deal with you!!!” Hearing Lin Xiu’s arrogant words, a brawny man finally couldn’t bear it any longer and leaped onto the stage immediately.
