1378 Self-destruction

Boom boom – –

There were five god warriors on the team and all of them had released their most powerful skills while attacking Yuan Zheng and Xiao Qingchen.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng thought of resisting it in the beginning but soon, they realised that it was getting more dangerous. Then, they quickly released their ‘sphere’s to defend themselves.

Cracking – –

A large amount of lightning bolts appeared all over Xiao Qingchen’s body and after blocking an attack from one of the warrior gods, Xiao Qingchen raised his machete and let out the terrifying lightning bolts.

As they were released from his body, they turned into a dragon and started attacking the team of warrior gods.

Those who were still trying to attack Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng had a drastic change in the look of their eyes when they saw the dragon.

They quickly took a few steps backwards and tried to hide from it.

“Ahhhhh!”

One of the warrior gods did not get to hide in time and was hidden by the dragon. Following that, there was a loud, painful cry.

This was his chance!

Yuan Zheng saw his opportunity and raised his warhammers, aiming at the warrior god that got attacked by the lightning dragon.

“The Messy Dance Hammer Technique!”

The hammer in his hands was then filled with intense energy.

Soon, there was a black panther that appeared behind Yuan Zheng.

A black grade divine spirit!

As the panther appeared, Yuan Zheng’s strength and speed grew tremendously.

HIs hammers looked even scarier than before.

Boom boom boom –

The warrior god didn’t even have the chance to release his ‘sphere’ and was hit by the hammers.

Instantly, the warrior god turned into a meat patty!

The energy mark on the warrior then flew over to Yuan Zheng.

The rest of the warriors looked surprised.

They didn’t think that one of theirs would die because of their own carelessness.

“That guy has a black grade divine spirit!”

One of the warriors spoke as he had a bad feeling about this.

“Well, he’s not the only one.”

Xiao Qingchen sneered.

He was hoping to keep a low profile but these warrior gods are annoying. They were like chewing gum stuck to their shoes, constantly attacking them.

Boom – –

Just as Xiao Qingchen spoke, there was a huge flaming giant that appeared behind him.

There were three divine marks on the divine spirit.

All four of them were incredibly shocked when they saw this scene.

They didn’t think that these two would have black grade divine spirits!

“Let’s go!”

One of them noticed that things were going out of hand and he quickly warned the rest of his comrades.

“Go? Where do you think you’re going?”

Xiao Qingchen let out a cold laugh as he looked at Yuan Zheng. Both of them released the most powerful skill that they had and aimed it at the four remaining warrior gods.

“You’re dead!”

All four of them screamed when they saw Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng coming at them.

As they released their ‘sphere’s, they were also trying to release their greatest skills.

However, Yuan Zheng and Xiao Qingchen had already used their divine spirit and were able to block all these small warrior skill attacks.

“Go to hell!”

Xiao Qingchen roared as he released the flames from his divine spirit. Then, there were two warrior gods that were lit up in flames.

“Ahhhhh!!!!!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Both of them were screaming loudly in pain.

They quickly got on the ground and started rolling around.

However, these flames were terrifying. No matter how hard they tried, they still couldn’t get rid of the flames on their bodies.

Soon, their bodies turned into ashes.

There were two more energy marks that appeared on Xiao Qingchen’s forehead.

At the same time, Yuan Zheng was swinging his warhammer and blasted off another warrior’s head!

Then, both of them ended up with three energy marks on their foreheads.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng stared at the last warrior standing and attacked him!

The warrior started shuddering in fear as he looked at the both of them.

...

He didn’t think that his comrades would all die so quickly!

As for him, he couldn’t have the power to resist the attack from two warrior gods with black grade divine spirits.

He had no other choice. He would definitely be killed.

“Well, then you two shall come along with me!”

He clenched his fist as his body trembled as if he had made a decision. Then, it was followed by a loud roar.

Damn!

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng seemed to have realised what this man was about to do and they had a bad feeling about it.

Boom – –

Following that, there was a loud explosion and all of the trees around were blasted away.

There were even cracks seen on the ground.

Lin Xiu was already headed in that direction. He felt that something was wrong and subconsciously released his ‘sphere’.

...

There was a huge impact that followed the explosion which caused the ground to shake. All of the trees around them have been uprooted as well.

At that moment, the entire forest looked empty.

“Such strength….. Was it self-destruct?”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

Without much hesitation, Lin Xiu fastened his pace.

If there were a large number of warriors fighting there, perhaps he would be able to get what remained from the match.

“Damn it…”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng were both lying on the ground.

There was blood hanging from the corners of their mouths.

Although they had released their ‘sphere’, they were in close proximity to the warrior who self-destructed which was why they were also severely injured.

“Tsk tsk! So….there was a fight that happened here.”

Suddenly, there was a voice that appeared from behind them.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng looked worried and quickly got back on their feet while trying to withstand the pain.

When they turned around, they noticed that there were at least 10 warrior gods around them!

The self-destruction had caused a huge scene and most of the warriors came to see what had happened.

“Well, this is mine.”

One of the warriors noticed the energy mark in the air that was about to disappear and went for it. Then, another mark appeared on his head.

“Those two have three energy marks on their heads. Well, Zhang Laosan, we will be taking them first!”

Two of the warriors spoke up instantly.

They already had two marks on their foreheads and with the additional three from them, these two warriors would be able to leave this place immediately.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng looked helpless.

They were already injured and would not be able to fight these men.
