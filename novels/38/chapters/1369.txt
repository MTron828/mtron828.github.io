1370 Warrior God City

“Leave?”

Mr Pang was caught off guard with what Lin Xiu had just told him.

From the tone of it, it sounded as if Lin Xiu would never return.

“Will you still be coming back?”

Mr Pang hesitated for a moment before asking.

Humans are emotional animals. After spending some time with Lin Xiu, Mr Pang had started respecting Lin Xiu.

Hearing that Lin Xiu had to leave, Mr Pang seemed depressed.

“Hmm….I may or may not return.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

He had been used to being alone. Guarding one city was not something that he was used to.

Plus, he had to look for Luo Yue.

“I’ll be leaving now.”

Lin Xiu felt something vibrating. Then, he took out a card from his expansion space.

The card was violently shaking and there was also a bright glow that came from it.

It was like a breathing lamp.

“It’s asking me to leave.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he looked at the card.

It was obvious that someone else from the other side was calling for him which was why the card started shaking.

“Goodbye.”

Lin Xiu smiled as he bidded farewell.

Before Mr Pang could answer him, Lin Xiu crushed the card that was in his palm.

Crack – –

With a soft crack, the card broke into pieces and Lin Xiu’s body was immediately covered by a soft glow. Soon, his entire body disappeared.

“City Lord…”

Mr Pang called after Lin Xiu subconsciously but he soon noticed that Lin Xiu was gone.

“City Lord!”

Lei Chong ran from the other direction but as he was running, he noticed Lin Xiu that disappeared as well.

“City lord left…?”

Lei Chong was still in shock. There was so much that he wanted to say but not a single word came out of his mouth.

Both of them stood frozen on the spot and sighed.

“Oh! His pets are still here which means that he will return!”

Lei Chong suddenly thought of something and started screaming with excitement.

Mr Pang’s eyes lit up with hope as well after hearing what Lei Chong said.

“Let’s take good care of the city before City Lord returns the next time! We have to make this place better than ever!”

Lei Chong clenched his fist. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Although he wasn’t a powerful man, he had inherited vast knowledge in regards to technology. This was something that he excelled in!

He was confident that he could turn Lingxian City into a powerful city!

Huuuu~

At the same time, Lin Xiu had arrived at the Central Pavillion once again.

When he felt the air around him that was rich in energy, Lin Xiu took a deep breath. It felt great.

“You got here quickly.”

Lin Xiu looked up and saw Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng.

Riyan God Lord was standing on the other side.

“Hmm… All of you are here now.”

Riyan God Lord looked at the three of them and gently stroked his beard.

“Are we leaving now?”

Lin Xiu asked out of curiosity.

According to what he was told before, the entrance to Tianmen City would only be opened three days later.

“Yes. You will first be departing for Warrior God City.”

Riyan God Lord gently nodded his head.

“Warrior God City?”

Lin Xiu felt lost.

Didn’t they say that they were going to Tianmen City? How did it suddenly become Warrior God City?

Xiao Qingchen looked at Lin Xiu with disdain. “You can only go to Tianmen City through Warrior God City.”

...

“Did you really think that Tianmen City is just a regular city? It’s an ancient ruin far away.”

“Well, you really did not do any research on it.”

Lin Xiu quickly rebutted.

“You seem to know a lot about it.”

“Of course.”

Xiao Qingchen was confident.

“I heard that there will be lots of people joining this year.”

Yuan Zheng thought about it before speaking up.

“That’s right. There will be more people who will be going to Tianmen City compared to the years before this. All of them are very powerful as well. You have to be careful.”

Riyan God Lord nodded his head.

“Before I send you over to Warrior God City, let me tell you more about your mission.”

...

Here it comes.

Lin Xiu furrowed his brow as he paid attention to what Riyan God Lord had to say.

With how magnanimous they were with allowing them to use the pool, they would definitely ask for something in return.

“Try your best to look for the Water of Life.”

Riyan God Lord took a look at all three of them and spoke in a solemn tone.

“Water of Life?!”

Xiao Qingchen was stunned to hear what the Riyan God Lord wanted.

“Is that something difficult to find?”

Yuan Zheng turned and looked at Xiao Qingchen and asked curiously.

“Of course. This is a legendary fluid. It is said that it could even revive a dead warrior!”

Xiao Qingchen nodded his head.

“Well, that would be something difficult to find.”

After hearing what Xiao Qingchen said, Lin Xiu looked at Riyan God Lord helplessly.

“Well, of course it would be difficult.”

Riyan God Lord continued smiling.

“But, just try your best to look for it. If you are able to do so, do not worry because the God King will definitely reward you with something equivalent.”

“Alright. It’s time for you to head over to Warrior God City and wait for the doors to Tianmen City to be opened.”

“Whether or not you win will be up to faith.”

Then, Riyan God Lord gathered all of his energy in his body and released them.

There was a huge storm that suddenly appeared in the pavilion.

Such massive powers!

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank subconsciously.

He always knew that Riyan God Lord was someone powerful but he didn’t think that Riyan God Lord would be this overpowering.

His energy itself was able to cause such a storm.

Riyan God Lord focused all of his energy onto his arms. With the movement of his arms, there was a weird rune that appeared in the air.

“Ha!”

With a loud cry, there was an explosion that happened.

Then, an oval-shaped space opening appeared.

“Get in quick!”

Riyan God Lord screamed. Lin Xiu and the rest of them quickly entered the space opening.

Then, there was an eye-blinding light that appeared.

Their bodies seem to be falling as well.

Lin Xiu quickly activated the levitation technique and steadied himself.

It felt as if he was in midair!

When he looked far into the distance, he could see a huge city ahead of them.

“The air here is rich!”

Yuan Zheng was incredibly shocked.

“Well, this is the core of the Warrior God Realm. It does not belong to any City Lord and is not controlled by any forces.”

“The city floats in the sky so it is huge.”

“Plus, there is an age limit to those who are allowed to enter.”

“Only younger warriors are allowed inside.”

Xiao Qingchen was like a walking encyclopedia as he continued explaining it to the rest of them.

“Let’s go!”

Lin Xiu was finally getting interested in the Warrior God City.

He had been told that all of the strongest warriors for the Warrior God Realm would be gathered here. He wondered how this city would be like.
