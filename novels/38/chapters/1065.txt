“Show yourself!”

The captain looked around and screamed in rage. With him being in the centres, there was a source of energy that was released from his body.

Soon, with the source energy released, there was a bright light that appeared as well and it was expanding to the rest of the room.

Domain!

He would be able to clearly feel the stranger’s energy whenever they were hiding on his domain.

It’s over here!

The captain seemed to have felt something and he turned over to another direction.

Xiu – –

Then, there was a bright light that pierced into his eyes that forced him to close his eyes.

The rest of the warriors did the same as well.

When they opened their eyes once again, they noticed that Ye Kai who was supposedly right in front of them, disappeared into thin air.

“Where did that man go?!”

The captain naturally realised what had happened and quickly asked in a cold tone.

He was about to release his domain once again to feel where Ye Kai was but he realised that the domain that he had released had gone missing!

The thing that replaced it was a bright white glow that soon covered the entire region.

What was this?!

All of them were surprised to see the white glow on the ground.

“This is a domain! Who’s releasing it?!”

The captain started screaming once again.

The rest of the warriors started looking around.

“Uncle Ye, are you alright?”

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared from the other side.

Ye Kai widened his eyes in shock. He stared at Lin Xiu who was standing right in front of him and he was still in disbelief.

“You are…”

“It’s me.”

Lin Xiu removed his mask and showed his face.

“Young master?!”

Seeing how it was Lin Xiu underneath the mask, Ye Kai’s eyes were opened wide. He really couldn’t believe who he was looking at.

Lin Xiu was standing right in front of him.

Lin Xiu even managed to save him!

“Young master, why are you here?!”

Ye Kai looked surprised and he was feeling excited as he asked Lin Xiu.

“I was at Bai Di City. What about you? How did you end up being captured?”

Lin Xiu asked in return.

Previously, when they went their separate ways, Ye Kai said he would be exploring and cultivating in order to boost his skills.

He would also be looking for allies of the Ye family.

“Long story short, I…”

Just as Ye Kai was about to speak, there were noises coming from all around them.

“So the rats are hiding here.”

The warriors of the Bai family were standing all around them.

As for the captain, he glared at Lin Xiu with a murderous intention in his eyes.

Oh? They found him so quickly?

Lin Xiu raised his brows.

With the control of his mind, he could then feel that there were cameras around them.

Boom boom boom – –

He quickly released all of the energy in his body and soon, all of the hidden cameras exploded.

“Hmph!”

The captain sneered coldly. With his commands, the rest of the warriors from the Bai family surrounded Lin Xiu and Ye Kai.

“Do you know what the consequences are for messing with the Bai family?”

The captain stared at Lin Xiu and asked coldly.

“En. I’m terrified now.”

Lin Xiu had already put on his mask and was speaking in a exaggerated tone.

“Kill him!”

When the captain heard what Lin Xiu said, he felt mad.

Then, he screamed in rage.

With the signal from their captain, all of the warriors from the Bai family held onto their weapons and attacked Lin Xiu!

“Young master, be careful!”

Ye Kai’s pupil narrowed when he saw the men attacking Lin Xiu. He was prepared to get up and fight.

“Let me do it.”

Then, Lin Xiu patted his shoulder and told him to rest.

At the same time, the water element energy stone shone brightly. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Soon, there were droplets that were blue in colour that appeared in the air.

All of them rushed toward Ye Kai’s wounds.

Ye Kai still had some injuries on him but at that moment, all of them were slowly recovering on their own!

This…..was incredible!

Ye Kai had his eyes opened wide when he saw what was happening.

He could no longer hide the look in his eyes.

At the same time, the rest of the warriors from the Bai family were coming at them!

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered and with the control of his mind, the long spear that was in his expansion space soon appeared in his hand.

Clang clang clang – –

He held onto the spear with both his hands and there was a loud sound that followed along with it.

All of the warriors who held onto their weapons could clearly feel a large surge of energy coming at them.

They held their hands turned numb and their weapons flew out of their grasp.

When the captain saw what happened to his men, his pupil shrank as well.

He knew this group of warriors at the back of his hand. He knew that they were powerful men.

But, while they were fighting Lin Xiu, the weapons in their hands just flew out of control! How was this even possible?!

However, Lin Xiu did not stop. Instead, he looked at the warrior closest to him and his figure instantly appeared milimetres away from the warrior.

Then, with his long spear, he thrusted it into the warrior’s body!

The warrior from the Bai family that was being attacked was in shock as well but he managed to gather his energy and quickly released his ‘Yuan’.

Boom — –

But, as soon as the tip of Lin Xiu’s spear landed on his ‘sphere’, there was a loud explosion that followed.

The warrior’s ‘sphere’ then instantly exploded because of Lin Xiu’s spear!

How was this even possible?!

The warrior’s eyes were wide open and he couldn’t believe what was happening to him.

Pfft– –

However, the impact of his ‘sphere’ exploding caused him to spit out a mouthful of blood.

As for the long spear, it went directly through his chest.

An experienced, high-grade warrior had been killed.

Lin Xiu didn’t waste his time. With both his hands, he pulled out the long spear that went through the man’s body and started attacking the rest of the warriors.

“Go to hell!!!”

The rest of the warriors looked frightened as they saw Lin Xiu coming closer to them.

There were source marks that appeared on their foreheads.

All sorts of source mark energy were being released and were all aimed at Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu quickly released his ‘sphere’ as well.

The energy that came from the sourcemark was all blocked by Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’.

It didn’t cause any damage to Lin Xiu!

As Lin Xiu swung the long spear with his hands, another warrior from the Bai family died!

Lin Xiu was unstoppable. He was like a war machine and was killing all of the warriors with his long spear.
