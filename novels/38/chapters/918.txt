Chapter 919: Black Troop

Below this wall, there was a dark red plant.

“what is this?”

Looking at this dark red plant, Lin Xiu felt a strange feeling for some reason.

He instinctively activated Analytic eye and was surprised to find that now the Analytic eye could also analyze this plant!

Name: Blood Moon Tree (Plant)

Features: An extremely rare plant that can grow blood moon fruit. After taking the blood moon fruit, the power of the warrior can be greatly increased.

Is it extremely rare…

Lin Xiu thought about it and uprooted the Blood Moon Tree without these people paying attention.

There was still a lot of mud sticking to the roots.

With the activation of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the blood moon tree directly entered Lin Xiu’s expansion space.

“Did you find something?”

Hu Ling looked at Lin Xiu who was squatting on the ground and said curiously.

“No.”

......

Lin Xiu shook his head.

Although Hu Ling felt a little puzzled, she didn’t say much at this time.

“Okay, let’s move on.”

Everyone ate a lot of Origin Blood Bodhi. After replenishing their energy, Hu Ling continued to speak.

Continuing to walk forward from this side, she heard the sound from the other side.

“There’s someone?”

Hu Ling’s eyes changed slightly, then she clenched the weapon in her hand.

Because this secret realm is not only discovered by people in the Divine Domain.

Other team forces found it as well.

Besides, she was also carrying this priceless sword on her back.

It is not uncommon in this world to kill people and steal treasures.

“Watch out.”

Hu Ling said at this time.

At this moment, the warriors behind them all held their weapons in their hands and looked ahead.

Those voices got closer and closer, accompanied by the sound of footsteps.

“The black troop?”

Soon, Hu Ling could see clearly the group of people coming from the front and the pupils in her eyes could not help shrinking slightly.

“Leave!”

She weighed it for a while and said suddenly.

“Where to!”

But at this time, it was already a bit late.

The people in front rushed over in an instant and surrounded Lin Xiu and the others.

The speed of these people is really too fast.

It was too fast for them to react.

Respected warrior!?

Lin Xiu’s eyes couldn’t help but change.

Because among the people in the Black Troop, there were also strong warriors at the level of Respected warrior!

“We are from the Divine Domain!”

Hu Ling looked at these people and said suddenly.

There are more than thirty people in these Black Troop.

And all of them seemed very strong.

Especially the strength of the middle-aged man who seemed to be the leader of this team, even Hu Ling felt a little scared.

Respected warrior.

Moreover, among Respected warriors, he was still the most powerful warrior!

“Divine Domain? So what?”

The middle-aged man sneered.

“You…” Hearing his words, Hu Ling’s face became ugly.

In a place like this right now, even calling out the name of Divine Domain is of no use at all.

The other party doesn’t care where you are from.

“Eh? A sword made of the Divine Black Rock?”

The middle-aged man’s eyes lit up when he saw the black sword on Hu Ling’s back.

.

This kind of thing was useful even for a warrior of the Sage warrior level.

“bring it here.”

He looked at Hu Ling and said lightly.

Damn!

Hu Ling clenched her teeth.

If this thing was brought back to the organization, her status could be improved.

But the overall strength of the Black Troop that suddenly appeared now was obviously much stronger than them.

There was absolutely no way for her to refuse.

She looked at Lin Xiu and saw that Lin Xiu was standing in the middle of this group of warriors and he didn’t dare to resist at all.

“Okay, I’ll give it to you.”

There was no way, Hu Ling could only take down the sword and throw it directly to the middle-aged man.

“Looks like you have a good harvest, is there anything else?”

The middle-aged man looked at the sword made of the Divine Black Rock with satisfaction and continued to speak.

“there is nothing left.”

Although Hu Ling was a little unwilling, she said aloud at this time.

The middle-aged man glanced at the rest of the warriors and found that they really didn’t have anything, so he nodded.

“Okay, take them all away.”

“Where are you taking us?”

Hearing this person’s words, Hu Ling was also startled and said directly.

“You don’t need to know that.”

The middle-aged man said lightly.

“You…” Hu Ling was also angry at this time and the source strength of her body was about to be mobilized. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“If you dare to move, you will die!”

At this moment, a long sword appeared in front of Hu Ling!

What a fast speed!

When the surrounding warriors saw this scene, their expressions changed slightly.

Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly at this time.

The strength of this person is very strong.

He was stronger than An Nengxing and Shadow, who were killed by Lin Xiu.

If they really fought, Lin Xiu didn’t necessarily have the advantage.

He should just observe calmly.

“If I want, I can kill all of you at will.”

“Be obedient!”

The man said coldly to Hu Ling, then retracted his long sword.

“Take them away!”

At this time, these black-clothed warriors surrounded Hu Ling, Lin Xiu and others.

Under their hostage, the crowd continued to walk forward.

Light.

After walking forward for a while, they found that the front side became extremely bright!

The place just now seemed to be in the ruins of an ancient city. Now, everything here is full of technology.

“See? This is one of the secret realm central areas we found.”

The middle-aged man said to Hu Ling with a sneer.

Taking a closer look, there were quite a few people in the Black Troop in the front.

Some warriors in white uniforms were also caught by them and were sitting there.

“Go up there!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes turned to the front and he was surprised to find that these people were all from the white troop.

And at this time, a warrior from a White Troop had a weapon around his neck and walked towards the front.

There is a circle of white light rising above the front.

Below this is a staircase emitting white light.

The people in the Black Troop forced those in the White Troop to walk up the stairs.

The warriors of the White Troop seemed to be very scared.

But under the coercion of the warriors in the Black Troop, there was no other way but to stand on the stairs.

“what!!!”

As soon as he took a step, a dazzling light burst out from the stairs.

This man was cut in half in an instant!

This scene was extremely bloody!
