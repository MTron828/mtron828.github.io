Chapter 188: Self-invented Skill- ‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’

Some dead skin fell from his cheeks and arms.

Lin Xiu touched his face subconsciously and a large amount of light red dead skin fell off.

His skin seemed to have become a lot smoother.

There seemed to be a fiery red color in his eyes, but it quickly disappeared.

‘Oh right, I think I heard the prompt for gaining experience just now.’

Lin Xiu instinctively entered the system and was surprised to find that he had leveled up!

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: Level 21

Experience Points: 0/3 billion

Strength: 432

Physique: 235

Speed: 101

Skill: ‘Analytic Eye’, ‘Fury’, ‘Disguise’, ‘Engulf’

Rage build-up : 0/100

Potential point: 21

Title: Rank 4 warrior (Unused title: Rank 1 warrior, Rank 3 warrior, Rank 4 warrior)

Combat strength: 4650

Level up! He actually leveled up!

Oh right, Lin Xiu recalled at this time. When he fainted previously, he vaguely heard that he had gained more than 300 million experience!

Could it be that the ‘Engulf’ skill completely swallowed the Red Lotus Fire and turned it into experience points?

This was also a bit weird because the first time he used this ‘Engulf’ skill, he could only absorb so little energy.

He didn’t have time to think so much. Without hesitation, he added these 21 potential points to his strength directly.

His strength attribute instantly became 453.

A wave of power seemed to be transmitted to Lin Xiu’s body in an instant.

But it takes 300 million experience to rise to level 22, which was simply insane! How many evolved beasts did he have to kill to be able to reach that amount?

And it was not always possible to encounter this space crack!

“We’re doomed!!!” At the same time, Zhang Yin, who was on the opposite side, staggered and fell to the ground.

He turned around and saw that the rank 6 Blue-winged beetle opened its big mouth and was about to bite into his body!

Thinking of the bloody scene of the rank 4 warrior in Class 2 of the North Campus who got directly bitten in half by the monster, Zhang Yin’s body trembled and he had no strength to get up and escape.

“Zhang Yin! Run!!!” Li Ping and Jiang Li had already fled to the other side and were out of breath.

Seeing this dangerous scene, they couldn’t help shouting loudly.

Bang——

Just when Zhang Yin opened his eyes wide and had accepted his fate, the huge Blue-winged beetle flew out as if it had been hit by a train!

Its whole body smashed into the first floor of the building at the other side, making a loud noise.

“This…” He was dumbfounded when he saw this scene – what the hell happened!?

“Are you okay?” Lin Xiu had already appeared in front of him as he asked Zhang Yin.

“Lin Xiu! Are you okay!?” Zhang Yin turned his head abruptly and suddenly found Lin Xiu standing next to him, perfectly fine!

He clearly remembered that Lin Xiu swallowed that terrifying fire lotus-like energy cluster into his body!

“En, I’m fine already.” Lin Xiu nodded.

“Class monitor!” Li Ping and Jiang Li were excited when they saw Lin Xiu who suddenly appeared.

After all, Lin Xiu’s strength was tyrannical, as long as Lin Xiu was here, it was possible to kill that terrifying monster!

Boom——

As soon as they spoke, there was another huge noise from the building on the other side and the whole ground seemed to shake at this moment.

The Blue-winged beetle, which was just knocked out by Lin Xiu, suddenly revealed its wings that were hidden in the carapace.

Then rushed towards Lin Xiu and the others at an extremely fast speed!

“Hurry up and run away!!!” Lin Xiu saw this scene and the pupils in his eyes constricted.

Although this monster was knocked out by a violent attack by Lin Xiu, the carapace on its body formed a very good shield and it did not cause much damage at all.

As it flapped its blue wings and charged over, it seemed like a gust of wind was surging around it.

Lin Xiu was not nervous but it was completely silent around him all of a sudden that he could hear his heartbeat.

He had a feeling that he could unleash a very powerful skill, but he didn’t know the name of the skill.

Swish——

The Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hands rang out loudly at this moment and a small flame spread from the bottom to the tip of the Dark Edge spear.

“Go to hell!”

“‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’!!!”

At this moment, four words appeared in Lin Xiu’s mind and he yelled. He didn’t retreat but put force in his legs and he flew up. He waved the Dark Edge spear he was holding and the entire sky suddenly turned a fiery red color!

‘This… What kind of skill is this!?’

Zhang Yin widened his eyes and watched this horrifying scene. He had seen Lin Xiu’s ‘Awe of the phoenix’, but he had never seen Lin Xiu use this kind of skill.

Also, the temperature of the flame was very terrifying and the surrounding ground turned red in an instant, their bodies felt like they have suddenly fallen into a heated bricked bed.

Very soon, the flame swept over the rank 6 Blue-winged beetle that rushed over!

Boom——

As soon as the wings of the rank 6 Blue-winged beetle touched the flame, they burned directly.

The evolved beast that originally flew in the air, fell directly to the ground because of its burning wings.

The ground around shook at this moment.

Hiss hiss hiss——

The body of the rank 6 Blue-winged beetle was struggling violently and seemed to be wailing in pain. But at this moment, no matter how hard it struggled, the flame still did not go out, but burned more violently instead!

‘This is too scary!?’

Zhang Yin and the rest trembled slightly as they watched this scene.

What kind of weapon is this? It could produce such a terrifying flame, just like the fire of hell!

The carapace of the rank 6 Blue-winged beetle seemed to be slowly melting away!

Lin Xiu continued to hold the spear with both hands at this time and rushed forward!

On the body of the rank 6 Blue-winged beetle that was wrapped in flames, Lin Xiu clearly saw flashes of light.

There was nothing wrong; each time he used the ‘Profound intent’, there would be these bright things that only he could see.

‘Profound intent. Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!

Lin Xiu had already rushed to the Blue-winged beetle and thrust his Dark Edge spear as flashes of light burst out!

Because of the burning of the flame, the skin of the Blue-winged beetle has become fragile. At this moment, the body exploded in an instant!

Torn apart!!!
