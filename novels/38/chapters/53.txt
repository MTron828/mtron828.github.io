Chapter 54: One Month Later

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

There were more and more creepers, as if they were endless.

Xu Wen and the others began feeling tired, and if this went on, they would probably be in danger.

“I can’t do it anymore, I’ve got no more strength…” Li Yi felt that he had very little strength left in his arm just as he brandished the saber to kill a zombie.

He began to get tired, but the creepers behind him did not stop moving and rushed madly towards him.

He was doomed!

Li Yi looked up and found several white creepers rushing up with their mouths wide open, about to bite down on his body.

Li Yi instinctively closed his eyes, but in the next second, the pain he imagined did not come.

What’s going on?

He opened his eyes, and at this point, he saw that a silver spear had penetrated the bodies of the creepers.

“Lin Xiu!?” Seeing Lin Xiu in front of him, Li Yi was taken aback.

His arm was badly injured, how could he still hold the spear and attack at this moment?

Wouldn’t that cause the wound to open and bleed?

“Don’t be in a daze, kill!”

Lin Xiu quickly pulled out his spear and waved it again.

He did not think at all and simply added the potential points to his physique. At this moment, his wound recovery speed had accelerated and if his guess was right, his wound there had now begun to form a scab already.

“Keep attacking! Stop and you’ll die!” Xu Wen revealed murderous intent in his eyes right now and howled loudly.

Everyone continued to attack desperately, and a large number of creepers were constantly beheaded.

Not sure how long had gone by when the last creeper was killed, everyone couldn’t even hold their weapons properly and were trembling from the lack of strength.

Lin Xiu was panting hard and blood was seeping out of the white gauze around his shoulders.

He had no choice. Even if the recovery speed was much faster, waving the spear like that would definitely open up the wound.

Fortunately, all the creepers were killed.

But there were only six people who survived, including Lin Xiu.

“Zhang Qi!!!” The soldiers burst into tears when they saw the completely disfigured body.

Li Yi’s and Xu Wen’s faces also turned pale, they had a stifling feeling in their hearts, making them extremely uncomfortable.

In just two days, they had gone from a team of ten to a team of six.

They had to watch their teammates die in front of them each time and couldn’t do anything about it, even Lin Xiu felt awful at this moment.

“Come on, let’s find a place to take a break,” Lin Xiu sighed and said.

He didn’t have a choice but to continue fighting.

A month later.

Time passed quickly.

It had been almost a month since the clean-up mission in this Guang Ming Fort, and no one else had lost their life except for the four soldiers who died in the first two days.

“The clean-up should be completed already,” Xu Wen muttered to himself after the death of the last ferocious zombie that got shot in the head by Lin Xiu.

During this one month, all the zombies of the towns nearby, as well as some nuclear-contaminated evolved beasts were killed by them.

Now the whole town was empty, except for the six of them, it was as if they couldn’t see a single living creature around.

Lin Xiu pulled out the spear that was in the zombie’s head and flung it hard, waving the blood off the tip of the spear.

Actually, other than killing a lot of zombies in the first two days, the number of zombies dropped in the remaining 20 days.

As they were exposed to the sun and rain all day, Lin Xiu’s skin had a layer of bronze color within a short period of one month.

The originally fair-skinned and handsome young man had now turned into a dashing soldier.

The contours of muscles on his arms were evidence of his explosive strength.

Every night, Lin Xiu still continued to practice and the fight during the day was great training for his physique and skills.

At this moment, he looked at his stats board again:

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: Level 14

Experience: 1,534,529 (72,999 experience points required for the next level)

Strength: 148

Physique: 89

Speed: 65

Skills: An Analytic Eye, Fury

Rage build-up: 0/100

Overall combat strength: 1249

‘My overall combat strength is already 1249?’

Lin Xiu was surprised to see this. He could achieve so much more fighting out here than cultivating in the academy.

As long as he reaches level 15, he could probably be at the level of a rank 2 warrior!

A sophomore who was a rank 2 warrior – how terrifying was that?

With that thought, Lin Xiu got a little excited, but unfortunately, he was only about 70,000 experience points away. However, there were no more zombies or evolved beasts to kill.

On the way back, they passed the little town that had relics of the mech era. Suddenly, Li Yi seemed to have tripped on something and exclaimed as he fell to the ground.

“Damn, what the hell is this!” Li Yi got up unhappily, holding something strange like the wrist of an android.

Looking at this thing, he was about to throw it into the distance when Lin Xiu quickly walked up to him and stopped him.

“Don’t throw it away, let me take a look.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“It’s just some scrap metals.” Li Yi said. But when he saw Lin Xiu examining it carefully, he got a little curious.

During this one month, Lin Xiu kept finding these strange scrap metals every day and brought them back to their temporary lodging which made him very curious.

What’s the use of these things?

“Hahaha, this is it, it’s finally pieced together!” Lin Xiu studied it for a moment, then laughed loudly like he was very surprised.

“What’s pieced together?” Li Yi asked, but Lin Xiu was already running toward their temporary lodging.

“Hey, wait for me!”

They were staying in the lobby of a building for the time being because there weren’t any monsters in that building, so it was very safe.

Looking at the pile of machine parts in the corner, Lin Xiu’s eyes glistened.

He finally found all the parts after a month!
