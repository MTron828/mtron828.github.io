1423 It’ll Be A Piece of Cake to Kill You

Thank you readers!

“Just watch.”

The girls remained in their seats as they continued watching Lin Xiu.

40th!

Lin Xiu has picked the warrior ranked 40th.

“Forget it.”

On the other side, there was also another warrior looking at Lin Xiu and he shook his head.

Then, he cursed the card that was in his hands.

The bright light on the stage where Lin Xiu stood instantly disappeared as well. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Looks like he rejected the challenge too…”

The rest of the warriors were surprised.

This was the second warrior in the top 100 that rejected.

This meant that Lin Xiu would be able to challenge the warrior rank 30th!

He only had to win against two more warriors to get to the first.

As Lin Xiu thought about it, his eyes narrowed.

Without any hesitation, he picked his next opponent!

Ranked 30th, Jiang Luo!

With the choice made, there was a bright light that appeared before Lin Xiu once again.

“There’s someone who wants to challenge me?”

At the same time, one of the warriors sitting by Long Yingtian felt the vibration coming from his card.

As he took it out of his pocket, he frowned.

“Well, looks like this man is coming for me.”

Long Yingtian let out a cold laugh.

“Well I…”

The man turned over to Long Yingtian.

“If you feel that you can’t defeat him, you don’t have to go.”

Long Yingtian’s words were monotonous.

After hearing what Long Yingtian said, the look on the man’s face changed drastically, “I’m Jiang Luo, why should I be afraid?”

With that said, he transferred his energy into the card in his hand.

Then, with the energy placed in the card, there was a bright light that appeared.

He finally appeared on the stage, standing opposite Lin Xiu.

“Oh? You’re here?”

Lin Xiu sneered when he saw his opponent.

He raised Dark Edge above his head and moved it quickly in the air.

Boom

There were several dark blue flaming birds that were headed directly at Jiang Luo!

“Hmph! These are useless!”

Jiang Luo had just appeared on the stage when he saw the dark blue flaming birds before his eyes.

Then, he quickly released his ‘sphere’.

The sphere managed to stop all of the flaming birds.

“Jiang Luo!”

“That kid actually managed to challenge Jiang Luo who’s in the top 30!”

There were some warriors who left in the beginning and had just returned. They were shocked to find what was going on inside the arena.

It has only been a while but this fellow managed to fight his way into the top 100 and was not fighting the warriors ranked 30th?!

How powerful can this young man be?!

Xiu

Jiang Luo gathered his energy and a sword formed by source energy appeared in his hand.

Weapons like this would only grow stronger as their owner’s abilities became stronger.

The downfall of it was that it would exhaust one’s energy very quickly.

Jiang Luo held onto his sword and started swinging them in the air.

There were several crescent shaped sword aura that went after Lin Xiu!

These sword aura were so terrifying that even the air around it was scorched.

If it wasn’t because there was an energy barrier around it formed by a powerful god king, the entire place would have been destroyed!

Lin Xiu’s body flashed across the stage.

Then, the next moment, he appeared right in front of Jiang Luo.

With both hands on his spear, he thrust it into Jiang Luo’s body!

Boom

The spear landed on Jiang Luo ‘spear’ and a loud explosion followed.

Jiang Luo had to take a few steps back from the impact.

“Sh*t!”

Jiang Luo, who still looked unbothered before, started looking worried.

He clenched his jaw and roared in rage before attacking Lin Xiu with his sword!

The sword was formed from source energy.

As the sword was moved around, there was a terrifying sword aura that followed.

Boom

Lin Xiu was quick and he managed to stop the attack with his spear.

Jiang Luo was already enraged and he started attacking Lin Xiu like mad.

He wanted to finish Lin Xiu within the shortest time possible.

However, no matter how hard he tried, Lin Xiu was still able to withstand his attacks.

“Well, as the 30th, it looks like you do have some skills up your sleeves.”

Lin Xiu spoke as he continued defending against Jiang Luo’s attacks.

“It’ll be a piece of cake to kill you!”

Jiang Luo was obviously mad.

His strength doubled but Lin Xiu still managed to stop him.

Lin Xiu’s defense was watertight. There was no way he could find a way to defeat Lin Xiu.

However, there was bright light that was released from Lin Xiu’s body.

To be precise, there were two rays of bright, white light.

As they were released, all of them quickly spread across the ground and formed a unique mark.

Divine Realm?!

Jiang Luo was surprised to see what was on the ground.

Then, the terrifying energy that came from Lin Xiu’s spear forced him to move further behind!

As he was moving backwards, Lin Xiu then released another warrior skills [Profound intent, Torrential Storm of Roseflower!]

There were hundreds and thousands of spears that were covered in a dark blue flame floating in the air.

Jiang Luo wanted to fight Lin Xiu but the look in his eyes changed drastically.

So terrifying energy!

He had no other choice but to continue strengthening his ‘sphere’ with his source energy.

Within the shortest period of time, all the spears above him attacked his ‘sphere’ at once!

Boom

Loud sounds followed one after another and soon there were cracks that appeared all over Jiang Luo’s ‘sphere’!

This was impossible!

Jiang Luo’s eyes were filled with shock.

Forget about Jiang Luo, even the rest of the audience were stunned.

This young man had just destroyed the ‘sphere’ of another warrior god?!

“What rubbish.” Long Yingtian sneered after seeing the fight.

He furrowed his brows as he started at Lin Xiu.

He could obviously feel that there was something odd about Lin Xiu’s abilities.

“Jiang Luo is a dead man.”

He muttered under his breath.

Lin Xiu, who was in the ring, raised his spear and blasted Jiang Luo’s ‘sphere’ once and for all!

Pfft

Jiang Luo spat out a mouthful of blood.

Just as he was about to use his divine energy, he realized that all of them disappeared instantly!

How is this even possible?!

The look on his face changed drastically.

But then, there was a bright light that flashed across his eyes!
