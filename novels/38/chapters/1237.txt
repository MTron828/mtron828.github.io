1238 Dark Energy

Boom boom boom—

Following Sha Yan’s hand pinching in the air, there were loud noises on the ground under Lin Xiu’s feet.

At this moment, the entire ground unexpectedly split into terrifying ravines.

“that’s it?”

Baili Haoling had already used the levitation technique at this time.

An incomparably huge gully appeared as the ground under their feet cracked.

But for them, it is impossible for them to fall just because of this.

At this moment, Sha Yan showed an extremely strange smile on his face.

At this moment, under the huge ravine under the feet of Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling, there were a lot of black hands grabbing up from below!

Bang bang bang——

...

These black hands grabbed Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ and made loud noises.

Hm!?

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked down and found that these black hands were formed by some kind of dark energy.

And this energy is very weird and powerful. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

As they kept grabbing his ‘Sphere’, Lin Xiu could clearly feel his ‘Sphere’ trembling.

“Go!”

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly, obviously feeling something was wrong.

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, Baili Haoling flew into the air with Lin Xiu.

“Humph!”

Seeing this scene, Sha Yan immediately sneered.

At this time, with a movement of his right hand, the black energy hands below instantly became extremely long and rushed towards Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling who were flying into the sky!

...

“Hao Ling, go to the other side!”

Lin Xiu looked at this scene and his face became serious.

What this sand is using is not ordinary energy, but special dark energy.

This kind of dark energy is really weird. Just now, his ‘Sphere’ seemed to be unable to withstand the attack of this dark energy.

“Okay.”

Baili Haoling nodded slightly and flew to the other side as soon as he moved.

At this time, Sha Yan waved his hands in the air, as if he was manipulating these dark energy hands.

And just as Lin Xiu thought, these dark energy hands did not attack Baili Haoling who was leaving but towards himself.

Sha Yan wanted to kill Lin Xiu first.

But Lin Xiu would definitely not be killed so easily. At this moment, with a thought, the dark attribute energy ball in the energy glass ball collar on his neck suddenly shook slightly!

When those black hands were about to catch him, Lin Xiu waved his right hand and a huge shield of dark energy appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

...

Bang bang bang——

These dark energy hands hit Lin Xiu’s energy shield, making loud noises.

But there was no way to blow up the dark energy shield.

It seems that because they are both dark energies, the impact of this dark energy hand has become weaker.

“You also have dark energy!?”

When Sha Qiong on the ground saw this scene, the look in his eyes changed slightly.

Dark energy generally appears very rarely and there are very few warriors who can use dark energy.

But he never expected that Lin Xiu could also use dark energy!

Lin Xiu, who was in the sky, narrowed his eyes slightly.

Sure enough, the same dark energy can withstand the impact of these dark energy hands.

“Hao Ling, get rid of all the other fighters first and I’ll deal with this old chap.”

...

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked at Sha Yan below, then said to Baili Haoling.

Baili Haoling nodded slightly, clenched the two swords with both hands and looked down.

The rest of the warriors retreated to the back because of Sha Yan’s words just now.

However, their eyes were fixed on Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling, as if they were ready to attack them at any time.

Whoosh—

Baili Haoling didn’t think too much about it. At this moment, she moved, then she directly charged toward the bottom!

She loved a good fight and at this moment she felt as if her blood was boiling.

Although she had just fought with Sha Qiang not long ago and was injured, Baili Haoling at this time not only did not feel that her strength was weak instead, she felt much stronger.

As for Lin Xiu in the sky, at this moment, with the Dark Edge spear in his hand, a series of dark blue flaming birds rushed straight down!

The temperature of the dark blue flaming bird was very high. At this time, as the dark blue flaming bird flew downwards, the surrounding air seems to become distorted.

Sha Yan watched this scene, still standing there, without any fear.

...

As the dark blue flaming birds were about to hit his body, his ‘Sphere’ had already unfolded.

Taking a closer look, he found that the ‘Sphere’ he unfolded turned out to be black!

This ‘Sphere’ looked extremely strange. As the dark blue flaming bird that hit his ‘Sphere’, it didn’t have any impact at all.

Sure enough, it was using dark energy.

This is a bit tricky…

While Lin Xiu was talking to himself, he directly used the ‘Reset’ skill, then used ‘Fury’ again!

This Sha Qiong is difficult to deal with and Lin Xiu is not confident of being able to kill him if he was not in the state of ‘Fury’.

And at this time, just after using ‘Fury’, Lin Xiu also continued to use ‘Heavenly Array’, as well as his ‘Purification Domain’.

He must kill him in one hit!

At this time, Lin Xiu held his Dark Edge spear and charged down from the sky!

Because of Lin Xiu’s transfer of source strength, the spear body slowly began to have a large amount of black energy.

...

Those black energies quickly gathered into a giant black dragon!

The dark attribute energy ball on Lin Xiu’s neck was still shaking.

Because of the power of the dark attribute energy ball, the power of the black dragon seems to have become even stronger.

Circling the Dark Edge spear, it followed Lin Xiu as he charged down from the sky to Sha Qiong who was below!

At this moment, Sha Qiong had just seen that the dark blue flaming birds were all blocked by his own ‘Sphere’.

At this time, after a closer look, he found that Lin Xiu had already struck down!

And the spear rushed down with a black dragon!

“Small tricks!”

Looking at this scene, he didn’t panic at all and he didn’t even move his footsteps in the slightest.

It seems that he has incomparable confidence in the ‘Sphere’ he unfolded.

At this time, Lin Xiu held the long spear tightly with both hands and directly stabbed at the ‘Sphere’ unfolded by Sha Qiong!

Boom, boom, boom——

The ground where Sha Qiong was standing was constantly shaking.

Suddenly, a large number of cracks appeared.

The spear pierced his ‘Sphere’, making strange noises.

The black dragon also crazily rushed towards his ‘Sphere’.

It seems that this black dragon is also transformed from dark energy. At this time, his seemingly indestructible ‘Sphere’ started to shake!
