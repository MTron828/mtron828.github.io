Chapter 235: Entering the 22nd Floor

At this time, more and more people watched the live broadcast of the battle.

The no. 1 freshman wants to challenge a second-year student.

This piece of news had spread to almost every student.

This was a battle related to their pride as second-year students so countless second-year students were staring at the live broadcast.

Lin Xiu looked at Zhang Yizhi holding the hammer. Through the Analytic Eye, he found out that Zhang Yizhi’s power attribute was very high and his physique was also great.

But his speed was much lower than the two other attributes.

“One minute.” Lin Xiu stared at him, then raised a finger and said out loud.

‘One minute? What a minute?’

At this time, the students went blank when they heard Lin Xiu’s words.

They didn’t really understand.

“I only need one minute to beat you.” Lin Xiu looked at Zhang Yizhi and explained like he knew Zhang Yizhi’s doubts.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Zhang Yizhi’s face changed drastically.

“Arrogant!!!” He yelled. At this moment, he directly carried the hammer and attacked Lin Xiu!

The hammer looked very huge and there were spikes on it. Once hit, you would be severely injured if not dead!

Lin Xiu’s words really made him furious.

Bang——

At this time, the hammer slammed directly on Lin Xiu’s head.

Some students who saw this scene couldn’t help exclaiming.

This warhammer swung vigorously, and if one was hit in the head, the head would be smashed!

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s body moved slightly to the side and he dodged it directly!

Zhang Yizhi didn’t stop his movements just because Lin Xiu dodged the attack. At this time, he waved his hammer crazily and slammed it on Lin Xiu’s body!

Bang bang bang——

It sounded like explosions that made Lin Xiu frown.

The power of this hammer was too great.

“Hng, although Zhang Yizhi isn’t very smart, his limbs are great. His strength is also one of the best among the second-year students. This so-called no. 1 freshman doesn’t seem like he’s a match for Zhang Yizhi.” At this time, some second-year students saw this scene and began discussing.

“Be careful!” Zhang Yin watched the thrilling battle from below and couldn’t help exclaiming at this time. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The explosive sounds produced by the hammer could be heard clearly.

If you were hit by that hammer, you can imagine how severe the damage you would suffer.

“Don’t hide if you have guts!” As time went by, Zhang Yizhi started to feel a little tired.

From the start of the battle to this time, his attacks had not even hit Lin Xiu at all!

The hammer would brush past Lin Xiu’s body each time, it seemed as if Lin Xiu did it on purpose.

This made Zhang Yizhi even more frustrated.

“59 seconds.” Lin Xiu said faintly when he dodged the next blow.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Zhang Yizhi was so angry that his lungs were about to explode.

But he saw Lin Xiu make a turn and he disappeared!

Where did he go!?

He was shocked and when he was about to turn around to look behind him, a fist covered in electricity slammed directly on his body!

The speed of this punch was so fast that Zhang Yizhi had no chance to dodge at all.

Boom–

The fist covered in electricity hit his body directly, giving off a loud noise.

At this moment, the light of the electricity filled his whole body.

There was a burst of crackling noises.

His body was like a broken kite and flew out to the opposite side.

Boom——

His body hit the back and there was a loud noise.

“We won!!!” Li Ping and the others couldn’t help but exclaimed excitedly when they saw this scene.

One minute, Lin Xiu said one minute, he really defeated the big guy in one minute!

And he even knocked him out of the field directly!

This was simply terrifying.

“This…” The second-year students who were still bragging about Zhang Yizhi’s power were completely stunned at this time.

They didn’t expect that once Lin Xiu made a move, he could just knock Zhang Yizhi out!

“Next floor.” Lin Xiu took his Dark Edge spear, then jumped off to the ground without turning back at all and went straight to the next floor.

21st floor!

“It seems like he is coming soon.” Yu Yi was already waiting on the 22nd floor.

He got stirred up just thinking about being able to fight Lin Xiu in a while.

This time, he must wash away his previous shame and knock Lin Xiu to the ground in front of all these students!

“The warriors of this floor are not in the Tower of Tournament today. You can get the opportunity to advance to the next level unconditionally.

A staff member said to Lin Xiu who had just arrived.

This was the rule of the Tower of Tournament. There will be warriors on each floor, but if the warriors are not in the academy and cannot accept the challenge, the challenger will be promoted directly.

“How lucky, if he went against those guys on the 21st floor, this so-called no. 1 freshman will definitely lose here!” Some second-year students said with a cold snort.

Lin Xiu knocked down Zhang Yizhi so arrogantly just now which made those second-year students very upset.

It would be great if someone came to suppress Lin Xiu’s arrogance.

“Just wait, Yu Yi on the 22nd floor is already a rank 6 warrior, it is impossible for this freshman to win!”

There was a threshold to cross in order to advance from a rank 5 warrior to a rank 6 warrior and it was impossible to get promoted so easily.

Many of the second-year students had advanced to a rank 5 warrior in their freshman year, but there were very few rank 6 warriors, which was enough to prove the difficulty of advancing to a rank 6 warrior.

“You finally arrived.” On the 22nd floor, Yu Yi was already sitting cross-legged on the arena, with a long sword like he was waiting for Lin Xiu to arrive.

Lin Xiu looked at him and the Analytic Eye was activated instantly.

Target: Yu Yi

Level: Rank 6 warrior

Strength: 553

Physique: 275

Speed: 151

Whether it was strength, physique, or speed attributes, they were much higher than their Lin Xiu’s.

But it was not as difficult as he imagined and with the skills he had acquired, he was not afraid to deal with Yu Yi at all!
