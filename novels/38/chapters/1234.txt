1235 Borrow

“You’re right!”

Baili Haoling thought of something and a smile appeared on her face.

“You want to borrow it from the other cities?”

Lei Chong had no idea what they were talking about and asked subconsciously.

“Borrow? Hmm….you could say so…”

“Let’s ‘borrow’ some then.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu spoke to Baili Haoling.

Baili Haoling nodded her head and followed behind Lin Xiu.

“You can come along if you want.”

Lin Xiu told the rest of them as he left the scene.

“Of course!”

Lei Chong felt excited and followed behind Lin Xiu.

He still didn’t know much about this world.

He would obviously want to follow Lin Xiu and see how this city lord would be able to borrow odd crystals from another city.

Rollis had reverted to the size of a fist.

This was because Little Bai, who had recovered from its wounds due to the energy stones from Lin Xiu, noticed the signal that was given.

Then, Little Bai stopped in front of the crowd.

Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling then jumped onto Little Bai’s back.

When Lei Chong saw what was happening, he wanted to do the same as well.

However, Little Bai flapped its wings and pushed Lei Chong aside. Then, it grabbed onto Lei Chong with its claw.

Before Lei Chong could come to his senses, Little Bai flapped its wings and flew into the sky.

With the guidance of the smart watch, Lin Xiu quickly arrived at the next city.

Shachang City.

This was a city on the north side of Lingxian City.

This city was much bigger than Lingxian City and their defences were much stricter as well.

“Stay there!!”

When Little Bai was about to enter the sky above Shachang City, there were a large number of warriors riding on evolved beats that surrounded Little Bai.

Lin Xiu got on his feet as he was on Little Bai’s back. He stared at the warriors around him with an indifferent expression.

“So…this is Shachang City?”

Lin Xiu looked at one of the men who was dressed in a different uniform as he asked.

“This is the airspace of Shachang City.”

The man sneered at Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling who were sitting on Little Bai’s back.

He could clearly feel that these two were powerful people.

He knew that they were warrior gods.

However, he was also a warrior god himself and he shouldn’t be afraid of Lin Xiu.

“You have trespassed into our airspace. You will be killed for not having a reasonable explanation.”

The man continued speaking in a cold tone.

“Of course we have a reason for this.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he spoke.

“We’re here…”

“To borrow a few odd crystals from your city lord.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

With that said, the man’s pupil shrunk in shock.

From the look on Lin Xiu’s face, it was obvious that he had said this on purpose.

This man was asking for trouble!

“Kill him!”

The man did not hesitate and gave his commands.

With that, the rest of the warriors who were riding on flying evolved beasts started attacking Lin Xiu!

“Save me!!!!!”

Lei Chong, who was being grabbed by Little Bai’s claws, started screaming with his pale face.

He almost peed in his pants!

He wanted to cry but there were no tears coming out of his eyes. He didn’t do anything but why was he getting killed?!

Swoosh – –

However, just when the warriors who surrounded them got close, Little Bai flapped its wings. There was a strong frost that was released and it went straight for the warriors around it.

“Ahhhhh!!!!”

The warriors who wanted to attack Lin Xiu suddenly felt the attack from the frosty air. All of them quickly released their ‘sphere’s for protection but there were still some that weren’t quick enough to do so. Their bodies immediately came into contact with the frost and all of them started screaming in pain.

This was because their bodies were destroyed by the frost!

“Kill them.”

There was a murderous look that appeared in Lin Xiu’s eyes as he saw how they had surrounded him.

Baili Haoling licked her lips as she was starting to get excited.

The wound on her arm had completely recovered and she couldn’t feel any pain now.

She pulled out both her daggers and activated levitation skills before she attacked the warriors around them!

Boom – –

The warriors had their ‘sphere’s released in order to dodge the frost released by Little Bai. However, with Baili Haoling’s attack, all of their ‘sphere’s blasted as soon as it came into contact with the daggers.

Baili Haoling did not stop there. As she whacked their ‘sphere’s with her daggers, she continued hacking them with her weapons even when their sphere’s exploded.

Other than the man who was the leader of the group, the rest of the warriors were only sage warriors.

With Baili Haoling’s form while her eyes turned red, her abilities were similar to a warrior god. It was a piece of cake for her to kill them.

Plus, she could also feel that her strength has improved as well!

This was definitely something that surprised her.

However, she didn’t have the time to think about it now. She turned her focus into killing the rest of them.

“You’re dead.”

Seeing how the rest of his men were killed instantly because of Baili Haoling, he was starting to feel mad.

He jumped off his evolved beat and wanted to grab Baili Haoling!

He had a pair of gloves on and the tip of it was sharp and long.

Then, with his source energy being transferred onto the fingertips on the gloves, the entire glove was glowing brightly in purple.

“Hey, your opponent is here,”

However, before he could get his hands on Baili Haoling, there was a dark blue flame that appeared before his eyes.

His pupil shrank and subconsciously dodged the attack.

He managed to dodge the flame that was coming at him.

What was that?!

Although he had successfully dodge it, the man was still feeling a little frightened. This was because the flame earlier definitely wasn’t something simply.

Then, Lin Xiu appeared right in front of him.

“You’re the one who released the flames.”

The man frowned as he stared at Lin Xiu.

Although he already knew that Lin Xiu was a warrior god, he still wasn’t afraid of Lin Xiu.

This was because they were both warrior gods.

However, the flames that he saw a while ago were indeed terrifying.

“Call for your city lord to be here. I want to borrow a few odd crystals from him.”

Lin Xiu completely ignored what the man said and mentioned what he was here for.

“If he doesn’t bring it out for me, I’ll get it myself.”

“Madness!!!”

With that said, the man had an extremely awful look on his face.

Lei Chong, who was still being grabbed on by Little Bai’s claws, was in shock.

So…..when they said that they wanted to borrow it from another city, they were actually referring to snatching it from another city!
