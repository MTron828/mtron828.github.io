Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Watching Dean Baili leave, Lin Xiu was still a little puzzled, who was he talking about? Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Squeak!”

However, at this moment, Little Ice Crystal White Bird and Rollie ran over and jumped directly onto Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

“Let’s go back!”

Lin Xiu looked at them, then said with a smile.

Back at the residence, Lin Xiu took a shower, shaved his beard, and then lay directly on the bed.

On the top floor of the Tower of Trials, Lin Xiu felt that several months had passed, and he was constantly absorbing the knowledge of those books for the past few months. Lin Xiu finally felt tired.

It was not physical fatigue, but mental fatigue.

Phew...

After lying in bed for a while, Lin Xiu fell asleep.

Xiaobai and Rollie were still in the room and were noisy, but they noticed that Lin Xiu was asleep. They stood on the table and became very quiet at this time.

Time went by in a flash, and soon it was the next morning.

As soon as Lin Xiu opened his sleepy eyes, he felt a touch of sunlight shining on his body.

Very warm.

Squeak-

Just as Lin Xiu opened his eyes, Xiao Bai flew up and stood on Lin Xiu’s shoulder, rubbing Lin Xiu’s cheek with its mouth.

Its body was very cold, like an ice cube, which made Lin Xiu feel a touch of cold.

“Rollie, let’s go.”

Lin Xiu looked at the snowball-like Rollie at the head of his bed and said with a smile.

It seemed that he heard Lin Xiu’s voice, and Rollie also opened its beady black eyes at this time.

Because the battle suit had already been damaged in the Tower of Trials, Lin Xiu changed into a normal outfit, wearing a short-sleeved gray shirt, and then holding his Dark Edge spear, he left.

“I wanted to call you, but didn’t expect you to come out already.”

When Lin Xiu just walked out, he saw an old acquaintance.

Ouyang Hang.

“Oh? Why are you here?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows when he saw his figure, and said lightly.

“The audition of the warrior conference.”

Ouyang Hang said proudly at this time.

“Dean Baili allowed you to join with your strength?”

Lin Xiu looked at him for a while, and then said deliberately.

Because this time the World Warrior Conference was divided into individual competitions and academy competitions.

In the academy competition, each academy sends five representatives to a five-on-five decisive battle, and the only requirement for the individual battle was age.

“Hey! Don’t look down on me, I’m already a rank 7 warrior!” Ouyang Hang heard Lin Xiu’s words, his cheeks flushed with anger, and he shouted at Lin Xiu.

“Oh?”

Lin Xiu was a little curious at this time, how did Ouyang Hang’s strength improve so quickly?

He instinctively used the Analytic Eye; his current strength was really the strength of a rank 7 warrior!

How did this guy do it?

Lin Xiu was able to quickly level up because of the level-up system and various coincidences. He didn’t expect this guy to reach rank 7 too.

“This is a secret technique that our Ouyang family doesn’t pass down.” Ouyang Hang seemed to see Lin Xiu’s surprised expression, and at this time he became even more proud.

“Yes, Not bad.”

Lin Xiu nodded, then went passed him and walked ahead.

“Hey!”

Ouyang Hang was stunned for a moment, then quickly turned around to look behind him, only to find that Lin Xiu had gone far.

He widened his eyes. Originally, he wanted to show off in front of Lin Xiu. After all, he had failed to deal with Lin Xiu so many times before, and he even lost the battle against Lin Xiu very badly.

But he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would ignore him at all, which made him feel very discouraged.

“Damn!”

Ouyang Hang slammed his fist on the tree next to him, and then quickly followed him there.

“Teacher Nan.”

Just as Lin Xiu walked down, when he arrived at the field of the Sacred Region Academy, he saw Nan Zhengjun.

He seemed to have been waiting here for a long time.

Taking a closer look, Zhang Yin, Jiang Li and others were there too.

“You guys are here too.”

Lin Xiu looked at Zhang Yin and others and said with a smile.

“You’re going to participate in the audition later, do you feel a lot of pressure?”

Nan Zhengjun looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“Not really.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

“There are many areas for the audition, and we were assigned to Nanyang City.”

“After you get through the audition, we’ll go directly to Sky City to participate in the knockout.” round.

Sky City!

When Lin Xiu heard these two words, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

“Lin Xiu has already reached rank 6, and could definitely set foot in the Sky City!”

Zhang Yin also said a little excitedly at this time.

This is the central city in the Huaxia region!

“En, I will go.”

Lin Xiu said seriously.

At the same time, people came here one after another.

Dean Baili was one of them.

“Lin Xiu, Ouyang Hang, Huang Zhen, Qian Yao, you guys are the representatives selected from the elites of the academy. Don’t let me down at the audition.”

Dean Baili looked at Lin Xiu and the others and said.

“Yes!”

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao were both junior students and the two strongest warriors in the junior year.

At this time, they seemed to be very excited when they heard the voice of Dean Baili.

“Dean, we can’t accept this!”

At this moment, some students of the Sacred Region Academy came over from the other side and looked at Lin Xiu and Ouyang Hang and said aloud.

Dean Baili heard their voices and glanced at them.

Being glanced at by Dean Baili, they suddenly felt a chill.

However, the leading student still said bravely at this time, “Senior Huang and Senior Qian are the top 2 warriors, we have no opinion, but the other two are both freshmen. We can’t accept the fact that they are going to participate in the World Warrior Competition, we are not convinced!”

Because the competition was carried out under the name of the academy, each academy could only send one team, and the team could only have five people.

Lin Xiu and Ouyang Hang, two freshmen, actually occupied two places, which made these people feel very uncomfortable.

“Are you questioning my decision?” Dean Baili looked at them, then smiled and said.

His smile seemed to be very gentle, but these students felt a little scared.

After all, Dean Baili was still very dignified at this time.

But now it was impossible to stop halfway and these people were not willing to let this opportunity pass.

“We just question their strength.”

A man looked at Ouyang Hang and Lin Xiu with a provocative look in his eyes.
