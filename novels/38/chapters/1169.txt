When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

“Don’t move, your head will fall to the ground.”

A voice came from the front at this time.

Taking a closer look, it was Zhao Laosan.

He was holding a sword and at this moment it was placed on Lin Xiu’s neck.

This man is so fast!

At this time, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but exclaimed in his heart.

But Lin Xiu didn’t show any panic.

“What do you mean.”

Lin Xiu raised his brows, then said lightly.

“I saw it.”

Zhao Laosan sneered at this moment.

“You can destroy those divine marks, right?”

Just now, he clearly saw Lin Xiu’s spear destroying the divine mark on the skeleton of the beast god.

These divine marks were like delicate arithmetic. Those who don’t know how to solve them can’t solve them no matter what.

These divine marks on the skeleton of the beast god bring too much power to the skeleton of the god beast. If they are not destroyed, even he has no way to destroy the skeleton of the god beast.

This beast god’s skeleton blocked the way ahead. If it is not destroyed, there is no way to move forward.

“I saw it too.”

At the same time, Ye Yu also jumped over from the other side.

“Boy, how dare you say that you are not a Divine Marker?”

Ye Yu said with a sneer at this time.

From the moment Lin Xiu destroyed the divine marks on the giant gate, Ye Yu was 100% sure that Lin Xiu was the divine marker.

If one wasn’t a Divine Marker, one wouldn’t be able to decipher those Divine marks at all.

“Decipher all the divine marks on the bones of this beast god for me.”

At this time, Zhao Laosan snorted coldly.

“I can decode them, but now this thing is too aggressive, I need someone to contain it.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Although the two were wrong and Lin Xiu wasn’t a Divine Marker at all, but with the help of the Analytic Eye, he was still able to parse out all the methods of deciphering the Divine Marks.

Although Ye Yu and Zhao Laosan were not the same group, but now they also want to destroy the beast god’s skeleton, then move on.

The two looked at each other and nodded.

“The two of us will help you hold it back, you’d better decipher them for us quickly.”

Ye Yu said coldly at this time.

“If you dare to mess with us, we will kill you.”

At this time, Zhao Laosan said coldly.

As if in his eyes, killing Lin Xiu was a very easy task.

It’s easier than crushing an ant.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu also said lightly at this time.

“As long as you help me restrain it, I will destroy all the divine marks on it.”

“good!”

At this time, Zhao Laosan retracted the sword that was hanging around Lin Xiu’s neck and he and Ye Yu charged directly at the beast god’s skeleton that was frantically attacking the surrounding warriors!

boom boom boom —

The two of them were the elites among the god warriors.

At this time, they frantically attacked the beast god’s skeleton and loud noises erupted.

Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly at this time.

At this time, if he wanted to leave, it would be a very simple matter.

However, he also wanted to enter the ruins to see what was there.

Moreover, it was not easy to decipher those divine marks on the beast god’s skeleton with one’s own strength.

Someone has to hold it back.

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t think about it any further. His body moved and he rushed straight ahead!

Lin Xiu’s speed was very fast and he rushed in front of the beast god’s skeleton in an instant.

The Dark Edge spear held in his hand stabbed directly at the divine mark on its skeleton.

The long spear carries the source strength and at this time, a strange trajectory is drawn on this divine mark and that divine mark immediately disappeared!

Zhao Laosan and Ye Yu were still frantically attacking the beast god’s skeleton and Lin Xiu looked for opportunities to continue cracking the divine marks on its body. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

With the analysis of the Analytic eye, Lin Xiu cracked the divine marks on its bones.

Everything went very smoothly.

“Destroy it!!!”

After Lin Xiu destroyed all the divine marks on the beast god’s skeleton, Zhao Laosan roared angrily and the sword in both hands burst out with incomparably powerful strength.

Directly smashed the beast god’s skeleton!

Many warriors around were relieved when they saw this scene.

This damn thing was finally destroyed.

“Boy, this time, you will follow me.”

After Zhao Laosan destroyed the beast god’s skeleton, he looked at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

From the Divine Marks on the giant gate just now, he can clearly feel it. In this ruin, there were obviously many mechanisms and so on, which were related to the divine marks.

If Lin Xiu was there, he would be able to decipher all the divine marks.

For him, it is also a good thing.

“He has to follow me.”

Ye Yu walked over from the other side at this time and said coldly.

“Do you think that’s possible?”

At this moment, Zhao Laosan’s face turned gloomy and he said coldly.

“Zhao Laosan, are you sure you want to oppose my Luanxuan Palace?”

Ye Yu didn’t step back at this time and said coldly.

Zhao Laosan’s eyes were gloomy and uncertain.

“Go together.”

Then he spoke out.

“Fine.”

Ye Yu nodded.

“If we find Bai Lingxian’s inheritance, we’ll talk about it later, but for now, we need this kid to help us decipher the divine marks that may appear in front of us.”

Ye Yu glanced at Lin Xiu and said lightly.

Zhao Laosan was silent for a while, then nodded.

“Keep an eye on him.”

Ye Yu gestured to the warriors behind him.

At this moment, those warriors from Luanxuan Palace walked directly to Lin Xiu’s side.

These warriors are all warriors of the God warrior level and it is impossible to kill them so easily.

Forget it, Lin Xiu will think about it later.

Lin Xiu did not directly resist.

This Ye Yu and Zhao Laosan were obviously not ordinary god warriors. It is not that easy to kill them and he might lose his life if he was not careful.

“Walk.”

Ye Yu said lightly, then walked straight ahead.

The rest of the warriors also walked in at this time.

But after what just happened, these warriors became more cautious at this time.

After all, it’s too dangerous here, so they had to be careful.

Continuing to walk inside, it seems to suddenly become more spacious and well-lit.

The surrounding space suddenly became bigger.

There were a lot of weird patterns on the surrounding walls, emitting a faint light.
