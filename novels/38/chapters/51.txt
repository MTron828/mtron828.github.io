Chapter 52: A Robbery

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked on the ground and searched carefully.

There were a lot of scraps on the ground, some rusty gears, other scrap metals, and various parts of certain machines.

Click, click——

Just as everyone continued to walk forward, a strange noise was heard.

It sounded like someone stepping on the scraps on the ground.

Lin Xiu knitted his brows and gripped his spear tightly.

Xu Wen and the others were also on their guard.

It was clear that someone was walking over – if it wasn’t a human being, it would be an evolved beast or a zombie.

For sure!

Sure enough, as everyone turned the corner and walked over there, they saw six tall men standing there.

They were all dressed in combat uniforms and had all kinds of weapons in their hands.

You could tell from one glance that these people were all warriors.

“Oh, federal soldiers?” A man standing in front with an inch of hair looked at Lin Xiu and the others, then revealed a strange smile.

“Looks like you guys found something nice.” A man glanced at Lin Xiu’s hand.

Seeing the mechanical sword, a hint of greed appeared in his eyes.

The area here was dangerous, and no one would come over except for federal soldiers on a ‘clean-up’ mission.

These people got the information and knew that there were remains from the mech era at a nearby area in Guang Ming Fort.

Although these things had now been eliminated, they could be used as crafts. After all, these things were full of steampunk style and many people liked them, hence they could fetch a good price.

“Hand over everything you’ve found, we don’t want to kill federal soldiers,” another man laughed sinisterly.

“Hahaha.” The rest of the people heard his words and laughed too.

“What do you mean?” Xu Wen’s face darkened at this moment.

These guys knew that they were federal soldiers but still dared to threaten them.

They were clearly confident in their own strengths.

Xu Wen sized these six people up; five of them should be the strength of a rank 1 warrior, but the one standing behind with waist-length hair gave him a dangerous feeling.

What were they going to do?

Just as he hesitated, Lin Xiu threw the mechanical sword over.

But he had already secretly pulled out the Odd Crystal that was embedded in the groove.

“Wow, this boy is quite smart.” A man said as he took the mechanical sword and looked at Lin Xiu.

The mechanical sword only had a little rust and was barely damaged.

It could definitely sell for a good price.

“Nothing else? Did you guys hide them, huh?” A man looked at Lin Xiu and the others and frowned.

“We’re just federal soldiers on a mission.” Xu Wen looked a little upset and said.

“Let me search.” A sharp glint appeared in the man’s eyes and he went over to Lin Xiu and the others.

Xu Wen and the others’ pupils narrowed, and they gripped the weapons in their hands tightly.

This was too much!

“Come on, let’s go.” Just then, the long-haired man standing behind him, who had been silent all this while, spoke up.

When the man heard his words, his face changed suddenly, then scoffed coldly and said, “You guys are lucky.”

That group held the mechanical sword and slowly left in the other direction.

“Xu Wen, why didn’t you kill those guys?” Li Yi said in a fit of anger.

“This is a robbery!”

Just the arrogance of those people infuriated him.

The rest of the soldiers also looked at Xu Wen at this moment as he was the leader of the team. If he didn’t give out orders, the rest of the soldiers wouldn’t dare to launch an attack.

But they all felt very aggrieved at this point.

Xu Wen glanced at them, then said out loud, “Do you want to die?”

“What do you mean by that?” Li Yi was taken aback at first and flew into a rage.

That man is a rank 3 warrior,” Lin Xiu said out loud.

“What!?” The moment Lin Xiu said that, Li Yi and the rest were shocked.

“You knew?” Xu Wen was also a little surprised. Even though he felt that the man was very strong, he did not know his rank.

“En,” Lin Xiu nodded and did not do too much explanation. When the Analytic Eye was activated, Lin Xiu could tell immediately.

Li Yi and the others slowly calmed down from the anger as well.

The strength of a rank 3 warrior was too strong and they couldn’t fight back. Moreover, Lin Xiu was injured, and if they fought, there wasn’t a chance of winning at all.

“Let’s ignore those people and continue ahead.” Xu Wen spoke up.

“Yes!”

Walking in front, Lin Xiu looked down and found some scattered parts. Some of which were very familiar so he took a closer look and found that they seemed to be part of some kind of machine. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

What is it? Seems familiar…

Lin Xiu thought hard about it and seemed to recall something. His pupils constricted and he had a look of surprise.

He carefully picked it up and placed it in a hidden corner when no one was looking.

It was a little heavy holding it and he wasn’t sure if he could find all the other parts so he placed it over there first.

And Xu Wen and the rest were paying attention to what was up ahead.

At first, they didn’t see any monsters appear but finally found some here.

“What kind of zombie is this?” Xu Wen looked at the white zombies that were climbing over the walls and roofs not far away and felt nauseous.

Those zombies were creeping slowly and they looked like worms from a distance.

“Rank 2 zombies, creepers.” After Lin Xiu put the things away, he walked over and said.

The Analytic Eye showed that this type of zombies was very fast, but from afar, they appeared to be creeping slowly like worms.

What the hell is going on here?

“Lin Xiu, you’re really a walking encyclopedia. You know everything,” Li Yi praised.

Along the way, Lin Xiu could recognize almost everything and Li Yi really had to hand it to him.

“I’m going to destroy them.” A soldier saw the zombies moving slowly and couldn’t help but smile. He held his weapon and was about to charge forward to release the anger that those people brought about just now.

“Be careful, don’t rush!”
