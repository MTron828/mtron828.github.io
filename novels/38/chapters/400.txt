Chapter 401: You’re Gorgeous

Lin Xiu, who was lying on the ground, turned his head and looked in the direction from where the noise was coming from. Then, he noticed a few men in black who flew into the hall.

Boom–

One of them landed next to Lin Xiu and there was blood coming out of his mouth.

The man’s body trembled and soon, there wasn’t any more sound coming from him.

“You killed all of them?” Lin Xiu looked to the side and asked out loud.

“En.” Luo Yue was looking around cautiously as she was walking in from outside, with her sword that was now covered with blood.

“What’s wrong?” Lin Xiu still couldn’t move his body. He was still absorbing the energy from the environment with his cultivation technique in order to replenish the energy in his body.

“Someone’s watching us.” Luo Yue looked around before saying it in an indifferent tone.

There’s someone watching him and Luo Yue?

Just as Luo Yue finished her sentence, the look in her eyes changed. Then, with the sword in her arms, she started running in a different direction!

Bong – –

With a loud sound, a small black box broke into two because of Luo Yue and it was followed by a loud explosion.

“Sh*t!”

At the same time, the person on the other end, Ouyang Hang suddenly saw the flashes across the screen and violently threw it onto the ground.

He was watching the live battle with a small control security camera and he didn’t expect that Luo Yue would find it and destroy it.

The thing that he was angrier about was that all the men that he sent, including Yu Yi, were all dead because of Liu Xiu and Luo Yue.

“You should be dead! Dead!!!”

Ouyang Hang started throwing things around in a rage and was violently hitting them as if this was the only way for him to release his anger. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

After a while, when everything around him had been destroyed, Ouyang Jing finally calmed himself down.

“That fella is now a rank 6 warrior?” Ouyang Hang looked behind him and spoke to a young man.

“Young Master, from the news that we got, he is just a rank 5 warrior.” The young man behind Ouyang Hang answered respectfully.

When Ouyang Hang heard the answer, he took a deep breath. The look on his face was much better than before as he said, “Rank 5 warrior… this means that he wouldn’t be able to use my skill card…”

The skill card that he had at such a level was a rare item. No warrior would sell away such a skill card and this was applicable to Lin Xiu as well.

Plus, Lin Xiu’s skills still weren’t as good yet and he wasn’t at rank 6 which meant that he wouldn’t be able to use it.

“From how it looks now, my skill cars should still be with him.” Ouyang Hang mumbled to himself.

Modifying Yu Yi into a cyborg had already wasted a lot of his energy and he couldn’t help but feel a little heartbroken seeing how Yu Yi was destroyed so easily.

But, he had no other choice now.

What should he do now?!

“Call home.” Ouyang Hang finally made a decision and told the young man who was standing respectfully next to him as he took in a deep breath.

“Young Master…” The young man was stunned when he heard Ouyang Hang’s decision.

One should be aware that if the news of Ouyang Hang’s skill card being in the hands of another person was told to his family, he would be badly punished.

“Call my father, hurry!” Ouyang Hang gritted onto his teeth and he demanded it to be done.

He had no other choice now. He has to get rid of Lin Xiu and get his card back before Lin Xiu uses it.

On the other side, back at the mansion, Nan Zhengjun finally arrived with a few of the guards from the school.

Since there was quite a commotion and someone was bound to find out about it.

“Lin Xiu, what’s the matter?!” As Nan Zhengjun and the guards arrived at the scene, they saw the mess around and also the bodies of the man in black.

“Someone was trying to kill me.” Lin Xiu spoke as he slowly stood up.

“Kill You?” Nan Zhengjun asked as he was shocked to hear the news.

Lin Xiu nodded his head. Then, he slowly told the details as to what happened before to Nan Zhengjun.

“This is unbelievable!” After hearing what Lin Xiu said, Nan Zhengjun punched the wall that was next to him.

“Who was the one who helped transform Yu Yu into a cyborg?” Nan Zhengjun asked as he looked at the guards who were cleaning the scene and removing the bodies.

“The Ouyang family.” Luo Yue was looking at the mini camera that she destroyed a while ago and answered their question.

As he got the answer from Luo Yue, Nan Zhengjun frowned, “The Ouyang family? Perhaps it’s…”

Nan Zhengjun was thinking of Ouyang Hang since he was the only person from the Ouyang family who was attending Sacred Region Academy.

“It should be him.” When Lin Xiu saw the look on Nan Zhengjun, he nodded his head.

It was obvious that other than trying to kill him, they also wanted the diamond-grade skills card.

This card was the top skills card of the Ouyang family and they have not passed it to any outsiders. Now that the card is with him, Lin Xiu was sure that Ouyang Hang was extremely mad.

“I’ll discuss this with the other leaders…” Nan Zhengjun hesitated for a moment before telling Lin Xiu.

The Ouyang family wasn’t an ordinary family. They were powerful and influential. If they wanted to get rid of Lin Xiu, he would definitely be in great trouble.

“If they come again, we’ll kill them.” Luo Yue looked at him with her cold eyes.

Nan Zhengjun gave a bitter smile when he heard her reply, thinking that this young girl was such an arrogant one.

But, she did have the right to be this arrogant since her background was something that even the Sacred Region Academy wasn’t comparable to…

“Be careful. We’ll be leaving now.” After getting rid of the bodies, Nan Zhengjun carefully noted down how the accident happened after listening to what he said. Then, he patted Lin Xiu’s shoulder and left.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded his head. The side effects from the Rage were gone and Lin Xiu could now stand on his own.

“Here.” Luo Yue handed him an exquisite-looking lunch box that she had somehow gotten.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but be stunned when he saw her holding out a lunchbox with her thin, fair hands.

“I bought it just now and got one extra.” Luo Yue said calmly.

Lin Xiu finally understood the reason why Luo Yue disappeared a while ago. It was because she went to buy them dinner.

With the sunset next to them and the sun bright shining on Luo Yu’s face, she looked as if she was covered in gold.

“You’re gorgeous…”
