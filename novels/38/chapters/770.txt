Chapter 771: Kill Me!

The tenth rank is a special rank second only to the king rank.

Such evolved beasts are also very rare.

But they were much stronger than a rank 9 warrior.

And there are three of them ah...

If he guessed correctly, it was the Raging Flame Lion who arranged them to guard these things here.

Looking at his wound at this time, it had already turned blue.

It was obvious that he was a little poisoned.

But it didn’t matter, he had unlocked the gene lock and the body has evolved differently from ordinary humans, so the power of the body can slowly clear the toxins out automatically.

At this moment, Lin Xiu clenched the Dark Edge spear tightly and held his breath.

These three dark stone beasts have no hair on their bodies, like thick armor covered with a layer of rock.

At this point, their forelimbs stretched out to the front.

In their eyes, their pupils were like a burning flame.

The huge mouth opened wide, revealing a pair of sharp teeth and a lot of saliva dripped from the sharp teeth.

Roar–

In the next moment, without waiting for Lin Xiu to make a move, these three dark stone beasts rushed towards Lin Xiu from three corners!

The speed was very fast, so fast that Lin Xiu was surprised.

Whoosh whoosh—

Lin Xiu’s cultivation method activated and he kept dodging.

And while dodging, the Dark Edge spear in his hand stabbed out at the same time.

Dang–

However, the sharp point of the spear pierced the skin of these dark stone beasts and suddenly made a crisp sound.

The spear tip of the spear has no way to penetrate the skin of these dark stone beasts.

So tough!

Lin Xiu frowned and stabbed out many times in a row, but he didn’t even break the defense. The skin of these dark stone beasts was too hard.

And at this time, these dark stone beasts seemed to be furious because of Lin Xiu’s attack.

At this moment, while roaring continuously, from the inside of his mouth, he could see a red light bursting out.

Boom—

At this moment, a terrifying flame burst out from the mouth of the dark stone beasts!

These three dark stone beasts already have a certain amount of wisdom and they spew these terrifying flames from three directions at the same time. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

So Lin Xiu had no way to dodge!

But at this moment, Lin Xiu didn’t plan to dodge either, but directly unfolded his ‘Sphere’!

Those flames, at this moment, were all blocked by Lin Xiu’s “Sphere”!

The dark red ‘Sphere’ perfectly blocked these terrifying flames.

Lin Xiu, who was in the ‘Sphere’, also felt that his whole body was hot.

But this was nothing to Lin Xiu.

On the ground outside the ‘Sphere’, the rocks on the ground seemed to have been burned to the point of melting.

And at this time, Lin Xiu also started to fight back because of the protection of the ‘Sphere’!

With a shot of the spear in his hand, a loud noise suddenly erupted.

crackling-

A large amount of lightning was released as Lin Xiu swung his spear.

These flashes of lightning gathered above, then fell directly, all of which hit the bodies of these dark stone beasts.

‘Thousand Thunder’!!!

Lin Xiu let out a loud roar and lightning burst into the entire huge cave!

boom boom boom —

The surrounding ground also began to vibrate.

A lot of lightning burst out, all impacting these dark stone beasts.

Roar–

Looking at the lightning that came from these shocks, they wanted to dodge, but there was no way to dodge it.

Although the skin of these dark stone beasts is too hard to break, these electric currents directly went straight through their defense!

At this moment, they all roared loudly and seemed to feel severe pain as well.

Die!

Lin Xiu continued to unleash his skills, but these dark stone beasts seemed to be adapting to the impact of these lightning strikes in the next moment.

They even rushed towards Lin Xiu!

bang bang bang-

But because of Lin Xiu’s “Sphere”, these dark stone beasts had no way to attack Lin Xiu’s body.

All of their attacks were blocked by the ‘Sphere’.

The sharp claws kept slapping Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, making a loud noise after another.

Damn, these darn things.

Lin Xiu was thinking about counterattacks while mobilizing the source strength of his whole body to support ‘Sphere” for protection.

These dark stone beasts were really terrifying and their defenses were terribly strong.

What should he do?

Originally, he didn’t intend to use the ‘Fury’ skill, because later, Lin Xiu wanted to wait for the opportunity to come to snatch the odd crystals of the Raging Flame Lion.

But now there was no way.

Where those blue liquids were, Lin Xiu felt that there was more powerful energy in them.

Thinking like this, Lin Xiu took a deep breath, then directly activated the ‘Fury’ skill!

And at this moment, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the strength of his whole body, at this moment, skyrocketed.

‘Heavenly Array’!

And next, Lin Xiu also used the ‘Heavenly Array’ directly.

With Lin Xiu as the center, a bright white light was released.

In the next moment, these rays of light covered the ground.

Strength, once again increased!

boom–

‘Sphere’; the power also became stronger at this time.

As the source strength of Lin Xiu’s body exploded, these dark stone beasts that were constantly impacting his ‘Sphere’ were all sent flying out at this moment and slammed into the stone wall behind above.

Time was limited for ‘Fury’, so he had to hurry up and get rid of these dark stone beasts in a short period of time.

After retracting the unfolded ‘Sphere’ at this moment, the source strength in Lin Xiu’s entire body has reached the extreme.

Roar–

The dark stone beasts that were impacted and hit the stone wall behind fell to the ground and quickly got up again.

Shaking their huge heads, they roared loudly at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu looked at these dark stone beasts without any fear and the Heart of frost in his body was running wildly at this time.

‘Freezing the Distance’!

As Lin Xiu directly used this purple gold skill, the originally scorching space around him became extremely cold in an instant.

And at this moment, a large amount of frost appeared on the ground at a speed visible to the naked eye.

The entire space seemed to have turned into a world of ice and snow in an instant.

And those dark stone beasts, at this time, were all frozen into ice sculptures!

“Just... go to hell!”

The Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand turned dark red, extremely hot.

Holding a long spear, he charged directly towards one of the dark stone beasts!

The long spear pointed at its huge head and stabbed it directly!

boom–
