1430 Hetian Divine Domain

“How many people are here?”

Thank you readers!

The God King Hetian also had a gloomy face at this time.

Could it be that the god kings from other Divine Domains wanted to attack him?!

“Only…”

The warrior who reported also became a little hesitant at this time.

“Hurry up!”

At this time, the God King Hetian sternly shouted.

“There is only one warrior!”

He hurriedly said aloud.

A warrior broke through his divine gate!

“Could it be the God King?”

One of the Noble gods also looked surprised at this time.

“Send combat troops to kill him!”

The God King Hetian’s face darkened at this time.

The combat unit was the strongest actual combat unit under God King Hetian.

Following the Hetian God King, they fought in countless areas.

The fighting power was very strong!

At the same time, Lin Xiu has already entered the main area of Hetian Divine Domain.

“Should be here.”

Based on his feeling, Lin Xiu continued to fly to the other side.

At this moment, with a loud sound, Lin Xiu’s body was directly blown away by a short distance.

But soon, Lin Xiu stabilized his body.

Looking forward, he suddenly saw dozens of well-equipped warriors appearing in front of him.

These warriors were all at the level of god warriors!

And Lin Xiu could feel that these warriors were not weak at all.

Their eyes were full of killing intent.

They had obviously killed many people before.

“Where did this clown come from, he actually dared to break into the Hetian Divine Domain!!!”

One of the God warriors stared at Lin Xiu and shouted.

“Hand over the person.”

Lin Xiu looked at him and said in a calm voice.

“kill!”

The god warrior, not heeding Lin Xiu’s words, shouted out again. As he yelled, the surrounding god warriors unleashed powerful skills, charging toward Lin Xiu!

“Get lost!”

Lin Xiu was already holding back his anger.

At this time, the Dark Edge spear held in both hands burst out with faint blue flames.

With a sharp swipe of the spear, these faint blue flames immediately charged toward the surroundings!

Boom, boom, boom——

The skill power released by them was completely blocked by the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded before it hit Lin Xiu’s body.

And at this time, a large number of flaming birds charged toward those God warriors!

These God warriors clearly sensed the horror of Lin Xiu’s flaming birds and subconsciously unfolded their ‘Sphere’.

The flaming birds impacted their bodies and a loud sound erupted immediately.

Their seemingly solid ‘Sphere’ began to melt at a speed visible to the naked eye under the impact of the flaming birds!

Their eyes widened and their eyes were full of disbelief.

“Die!”

Some warriors have already approached Lin Xiu’s side at this time.

Holding the weapon in their hands, they were about to split Lin Xiu’s body in half.

“Hng!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and with the Dark Edge spears in both hands, he slashed across, killing a God warriorin an instant and at the same time, he swept out with a whip kick and several God warrior who had surrounded him were kicked away. go out!

‘Clean sweep’!

Lin Xiu looked at the God warriors who were charging toward him. At this moment, the black spear in his hand directly drew a huge arc!

The powerful energy fluctuations made the surrounding space seem to be distorted.

Those warriors who surrounded them were cut in half by the black spear at this moment!

The entire fighting force was killed by Lin Xiu in just a few moments, leaving only a few members.

These God warriors also looked ashamed. They had just resisted the flaming birds released by Lin Xiu and even their ‘Sphere’ were burned off.

Under the backlash of the source strength, blood flowed from the corners of their mouths.

“This is impossible…”

One of the God warriors had a look of disbelief in his eyes at this moment.

He was a little suspicious of life.

Their army, which fought countless battles, was defeated so easily by one person?

“Go back and report to the God King!!!”

One of the God warriors also reacted at this time and roared loudly.

In this situation, if they continued to stay here, they would be looking for death!

Just when the few of them wanted to escape, several flames appeared behind them in an instant!

They obviously felt something and the pupils in their eyes shrank suddenly.

But at this moment, these flames had already covered their bodies.

Boom——

The extremely terrifying flames instantly burned their bodies.

They didn’t even let out any wailing screams and they were burned into bones in an instant.

“What’s happening!?”

At the same time, Ling Tianxi, who was on the other side, obviously felt something and immediately frowned.

Loud battle sounds came from outside and they seemed to be accompanied by extremely strong energy fluctuations.

“He came.”

At this time, a faint smile appeared on the corner of Luo Yue’s mouth.

“He?”

At this moment, Ling Tianxi looked at Luo Yue in a blink of an eye.

She was stunned for a moment.

It was the first time she saw Luo Yue with a smile on her lips.

Just looking at Luo Yue’s smile, her expression suddenly became extremely ugly.

“So what if he’s here!!!”

“Courting death!”

At this moment, Ling Tianxi’s face became extremely ugly.

“Keep an eye on her!”

Ling Tianxi said to the maid here.

In the next moment, she walked out.

“Just ahead.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu could feel Luo Yue’s aura becoming more and more obvious.

Right in front!

Just as Lin Xiu flew forward, a golden-white figure appeared in front of Lin Xiu!

A woman.

This woman is dressed in white, but with golden accessories, she looks a bit elegant and luxurious.

At this time, her eyes were cold and she raised her hand and a series of huge ice picks pierced directly toward Lin Xiu!

Seeing this scene, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes also changed slightly.

With a wave of the spear in his hand, a series of dark blue flaming birds rushed directly toward him.

The flaming birds clashed with those huge ice cones and instantly melted those ice cones.

The flaming birds continued to attack Ling Tianxi.

“Hng!”

Looking at this scene, Ling Tianxi snorted coldly, moved her hands and a water curtain appeared in front of her body.

The dark blue flaming birds began to disappear the moment they hit the water curtain.

They seemed to be completely resisted by the power of those water curtains.

God King?

At this time, Lin Xiu subconsciously activated the Analytic Eye and directly analyzed the information of this woman.

But her attributes were indeed unknown.

All he know was that her rank was God king!

“Looking for Luo Yue?”

Ling Tianxi looked at Lin Xiu and said coldly.
