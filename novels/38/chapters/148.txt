Chapter 149: Instant Explosion!

“I’m fine.” Lin Xiu shook his head and smiled. He waited for them to finish battling before making his way forward slowly.

“Teacher, can I ask if I need to pay if this spoils?” Lin Xiu hesitated at the strength machine for a moment before asking Nan Zhengjun.

Nan Zhengjun was startled for a second before revealing a smile, “No need.”

His eyes sized Lin Xiu up carefully. Out of the 40 odd students here, Nan Zhengjun had placed most of his attention on Lin Xiu.

Not only was he the youngest, but he also emitted an extremely weak warrior aura as though there was some sort of disguise in place. This made him very curious.

“Hahaha, foolish child, you’re afraid of spoiling this thing with one punch?” The tall and sturdy man held his belly and laughed out loud.

The other new students laughed as well as though they had heard the funniest joke of all time.

Lin Xiu shook his head and placed his bag and spear sheath at the side. After loosening his body, he clenched his right fist.

Lin Xiu’s eyes became serious as though he could not hear any other sound.

He looked at the strength test machine as though he was looking at an enemy.

He unleashed his punch right away!

Bang-

When Lin Xiu punched, his gloves seemed to turn red from the friction with the air.

Lin Xiu’s strength stat was extremely high and after adding on Tiger Strength Fist and Rupturing Fist, this punch was the most powerful punch he had ever unleashed!

Even Nan Zhengjun who was originally smiling on stage had a change in expression.

Rumble-

All the new students that watched Lin Xiu make a joke out of himself were witnesses to his immense punch that produced an extremely loud sound on the strength test machine!!!

The entire machine instantly broke into pieces!

“What…” The people that were laughing were dumbstruck and their mouths were opened so big that eggs could be put in them.

Is he still a human?

“Little crafty boy.” Nan Zhengjun was the first to react and smiled at Lin Xiu.

He could see that Lin Xiu’s punch had skills supplemented onto it.

That was how he produced such an effect.

But even so, the strength unleashed was a little too terrifying and Nan Zhengjun reckoned that his own flesh body could not take it head-on.

“Thank you all for giving me a chance.”

Lin Xiu turned to all of the people that were originally laughing at him but turned to stare at him in shock.

“Haha, I just knew it!” Zhang Yin laughed out loud.

“If no one has any opinions, the class monitor for Class 10 this term will be Lin Xiu.” No one had any objections now when Nan Zhengjun spoke up.

Many were still immersed in their thoughts of Lin Xiu breaking the strength test machine in one punch.

How did he do that?

“As long as everyone scans your cards with your phones, you can utilize the school’s web and information.”

“The school map is inside as well.” Nan Zhengjun continued to explain.

“If there is nothing else, then we will end it here for today. Please gather in class at 6 in the morning tomorrow.”

“Wait a minute, Teacher Nan. I want to ask, where are our dorms?” Zhang yin stood up and asked.

The others nodded, they were not assigned any residence after coming here.

“Sacred Region Academy does not allocate dorms.” Nan Zhengjun smiled and said.

Not allocate dorms? Then sleep in the dorms?

As though aware of everyone’s skepticism, he continued, “But you can head to the housing registry and rent a room or house with points and choose the accommodation you want.”

They walked out and Lin Xiu walked with Zhang Yin and the others to the registration area.

It was a large hall with bright lights that lit up the entire place well.

At this time, there were many other new students around.

Lin Xiu looked around and saw many screens that indicated the accommodations at various regions.

“Bamboo Villa with a training room and a complete set of necessities, the monthly rent of 500 points…”

“Ordinary apartment of 50 square meters, the monthly rent of 50 points…” 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“We have to stay in the best accommodations!” Jiang Li, the big man, commented excitedly.

“I think that this is good too.” Zhang Yin and Lei Lei looked extremely happy as well.

Although there was no allocation of dorms, they needed to use points to gain lodging, the more points, the prettier the accommodation as though they were on holiday.

“You guys used all your points, so what are you going to eat?” Lin Xiu laughed and said.

“Isn’t the points provided for us to change for accommodations?” Jiang Li asked in shock.

“That’s right, they talked about the points as though it was very important.” Zhang Yi also reacted.

“I went into the school website to check.”

“The ordinary school food breakfast costs 5 points, lunch and dinner 10 points each. That is only the most ordinary of meals. If you want high-quality dishes, every meal will cost more than 20 points.” Lin Xiu pressed the buttons on his phone and brought up the information.

Zhang Yin and the others were stunned when they read the information.

“These 500 points are not enough for food, why do you want to use it all on expensive rooms?”

The excited Jiang Li deflated like a balloon.

“So, only a fool will spend all 500 points to stay in a high-grade villa.” Lin Xiu chuckled.

It was always best to study and investigate before deciding on taking action.

Lin Xiu believed that this might be a pit that Sacred Region Academy made for unaware students to spend all their points at one go.

“Who are you calling a fool.” Right at this time, a cold voice sounded out from behind him.

Lin Xiu was stunned and turned to see Luo Yue standing behind him with a rare shy expression as she stared at him.

“Did you spend all your points on a villa?” Lin Xiu stared at her with open eyes.

Lin Xiu was sure of his guess when he saw the high grade card in her hand.

“Can we get a refund?” Lei Lei asked in a soft voice.

After all, if she could not get her points back, she would not have points for dinner.

Zhang Yin noticed the strange atmosphere between Luo Yue and Lin Xiu and kept quiet.

“Lend me your card.” Luo Yue demanded.

“I haven’t chosen my residence.” Lin Xiu did not know whether to laugh or cry.

“My place is big.”
