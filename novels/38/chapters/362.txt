Chapter 363: Uninvited Guest

Lin Xiu froze in the hall when he heard this voice and stood by the floor-to-ceiling window. He looked towards the sky, and saw many things gleaming. They seemed like laser beams constantly shooting in the air.

What’s going on!?

Luo Yue, who was chasing after him with a long sword, seemed to have noticed this. She also stood by the floor-to-ceiling window and looked with a frown.

“Did they find the person who stole the alien ore?” Lin Xiu looked at the sky in the distance and said.

“Maybe.” Luo Yue nodded.

“Shall we go out and have a look?” Lin Xiu thought for a while and asked.

The current Deep Blue City seemed to be in turmoil. Lin Xiu still didn’t really know what happened, but he still wanted to go out and see what was going on.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue nodded.

“I’ll go get changed first.” Lin Xiu looked at the wet bathrobe on his body and didn’t have the mood for a bath anymore.

“I’ll go first.” Luo Yue seemed to have thought of something, stared at Lin Xiu then ran quickly in front of him.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but laugh when he saw this scene. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Soon, both of them changed their clothes and when they were about to go outside, the whole building suddenly shook violently.

Bang——

A loud noise echoed at this moment.

“What’s going on!?” Lin Xiu held the wall next to him to stabilize himself and a look of surprise appeared in his eyes.

Why is the whole building shaking suddenly?!

It was like something hit the building.

Just as Lin Xiu was confused, Luo Yue had begun tapping on the virtual keyboard next to the computer in the lobby.

“What’s happening?” Lin Xiu saw this scene and stood beside Luo Yue.

Luo Yue’s slender fingers were tapping frantically on the virtual keyboard. The speed was so fast that even Lin Xiu looked a little dazzled.

Soon, as Luo Yue finally hit the “ENT” key, multiple squares of surveillance screens appeared.

“This is…”

“I hacked the surveillance of this building.” Luo Yue said casually like she was talking about something very ordinary.

Lin Xiu was surprised when he heard Luo Yue’s words.

One must know that this was a branch of the Sacred Region academy and hacking into the surveillance then transferring to this computer was not a simple task.

What he didn’t expect was that Luo Yue had accomplished this within a short amount of time!

He looked at the screen and found that the corridors on each floor of the entire building could be clearly seen.

But although the lights were turned on in these corridors, they were empty.

Luo Yue glanced around then clicked on the surveillance of one of the small squares. At this moment, the screen zoomed in.

“What is this!?”

Seeing this enlarged surveillance screen, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank sharply.

Because on this surveillance screen, it was obvious that a huge aircraft fell on the roof of this building.

At this moment, there were black figures crawling out of the aircraft.

No wonder there was such a loud noise just now. It turned out that a huge aircraft hit the roof of this building from the sky.

Just as Lin Xiu stared at the situation on the screen, a black figure walked over.

A cold light flashed by. At this moment, the surveillance video instantly turned into a bunch of snowflakes and nothing was seen.

“It was destroyed.” Luo Yue frowned slightly then said aloud.

Lin Xiu nodded then continued, “What should we do now?”

“Kill them.” Luo Yue’s eyes were cold then she said with a tight grip on the long sword in her hand.

“These people should be on their way down by now if I’m not wrong.”

Lin Xiu also clenched the Dark Edge spear at this moment. The people just now didn’t look friendly and Lin Xiu could faintly sense that this could possibly be the people who stole that ‘Alien Ore’, the group of thieves who want to escape from the Deep blue city!

With this thought, Lin Xiu’s expression became serious.

This building has twelve floors and they were now on the tenth floor!

It wouldn’t take long for these people to come down!

Bang bang bang——

Just then, Lin Xiu heard a knock on the door.

His expression changed and he held his breath.

All the lights in this room were switched off with only the faint light from the floor-to-ceiling windows shining in.

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue, only to see that Luo Yue did not move and was looking at the door.

There should be nobody in this building right now, otherwise, there wouldn’t be just the old man when they arrived.

Could it be those people just now that are knocking the door?

With that thought, Lin Xiu gripped his Dark Edge spear.

Bang–

At the next moment, there was a loud bang at the door and the whole door was kicked down directly!

The pupils in Lin Xiu and Luo Yue’s eyes constricted suddenly then they both rushed towards the front at the same time!

Swish swish swish——

Their weapons slashed directly at this moment.

Bang–

But at this moment, both of their weapons seemed to hit something and there was a dull sound.

The sharp-eyed Lin Xiu has discovered that his Dark Edge spear has pierced a light blue barrier!

‘Sphere’!!!

“There are people here indeed.” At this moment, a cold voice resounded.

Taking a closer look, the person standing at the door with the unfolded ‘sphere’ was a middle-aged man with a beard.

He was wearing a black suit. At this moment, he was looking at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, who tried to attack him but were blocked by his ‘Sphere’.

The expression on Luo Yue’s face did not change. At this moment, the long sword in her hand became white because of the concentration of source strength gathered on it.

At the next moment, the long sword continued to slash towards this ‘Sphere’!

Bang–
