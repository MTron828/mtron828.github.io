Chapter 382: Crazy Engulf

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened at this moment.

But it was too late to dodge and Lin Xiu was not yet a rank 6 warrior, so he couldn’t unfold the ‘sphere’ for protection at all!

Boom——

This thick blue lightning struck Lin Xiu’s body directly.

Although because of the cultivation of ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’, the voltage of normal electricity was nothing to Lin Xiu.

But when this thick lightning struck down, Lin Xiu felt severe pain all over his body, accompanied by numbness.

Horrifying, the power of this lightning is really terrifying.

Now Lin Xiu understood why the man was electrocuted just now and got carried away.

Lightning of this intensity, even he could barely stand it.

But after feeling the sharp pain in his body, Lin Xiu felt that his body seemed to be absorbing the power of the lightning.

What the hell is going on!?

Lin Xiu was a little shocked and entered his system interface immediately, then found that the passive skill ‘Engulf’ was activated!

And while absorbing part of the energy brought by lightning, it was quickly transformed into experience points!

Taking a closer look, the icon previously displayed: LV3, but now it has become LV4! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

This skill was probably upgraded!

With this thought, Lin Xiu ignored the pain caused by the lightning and was pleasantly surprised.

Although this lightning caused a lot of damage to him, his ‘Engulf’ skill seemed to be able to absorb the energy of this lightning, then temper his body!

The numbers on the experience column also increased frantically at this time.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu clenched his fists.

This was a very terrifying lightning for those warriors, but for Lin Xiu, it was the exact opposite.

Here… he could have a breakthrough by relying on this lightning!

With this thought, Lin Xiu watched another bolt of lightning strike his body and did not dodge at all, accepting the impact of this lightning!

Crackling——

Lin Xiu’s body was covered with a lot of lightning and it sounded like beans getting fried on his body.

At this moment, when Lin Xiu’s ‘Engulf’ skill was activated automatically and he also started running the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

What surprised Lin Xiu was that when he started the ‘cultivation technique’, he could feel that the pores on his skin were absorbing the energy in the air and even the energy of the lightning was being absorbed.

The severe physical pain still exists, but Lin Xiu clenched his teeth to suppress it.

Boom boom——

The dense bolts of lightning continued to fall from the air. Lin Xiu couldn’t remember how many lightning strikes he had suffered. In the next moment, he couldn’t bear the pain anymore and fell directly to the ground.

“This lightning… is really a bit too powerful…” Lin Xiu fell on the ground, panting, then said to himself.

His clothes have become scorched black. One must know that this was a special school uniform made by the Sacred Region Academy. Although it was not as good as a battle suit, it still had a defensive ability.

Moreover, Lin Xiu’s exposed skin has also become scorched black.

“Hurry up, he’s dying!” And at this moment, Lin Xiu heard a voice from the side. A man who was scorched by lightning and spitting white foam from his mouth was carried away on a stretcher by those guards.

“I don’t need it.” And in the next moment, Lin Xiu saw a guard walking towards him.

Seeing him approaching his side, Lin Xiu said suddenly.

The guard glanced at Lin Xiu and didn’t say much.

And at this time, no lightning appeared in the sky either. Those thunderbirds seemed to have engulfed the lightning and they flew to the top of the surrounding mountains, no longer hovering and dancing in the air.

“Boy, you got struck so many times yet you’re not dead yet.” The man who had spoken to Lin Xiu before looked at Lin Xiu who was lying on the ground and said with a surprised smile.

He had just seen Lin Xiu ‘exhausted’ and had no energy to dodge. He got struck so many times, yet Lin Xiu was safe and sound. This really surprised him.

“You are not dead yet, why would I be dead?” Lin Xiu took a deep breath, then smiled and said out loud.

There was still a burning sensation on Lin Xiu’s body at this moment. The power of the lightning just now was very strong and he was also struck so many consecutive times.

“Hahaha, kid, you’re interesting.” The man was stunned when he heard Lin Xiu’s words, then said aloud.

“My name is Lan Tu, sophomore, class 5, what about you?” Lan Tu looked at Lin Xiu, then said with a smile.

He wasn’t sure why but he was quite interested in Lin Xiu who seemed to be a young warrior.

He always felt that Lin Xiu didn’t seem like a simple person.

“Lin Xiu, freshman, class 10.” Lin Xiu said directly.

“From Class 10? But I think I heard of your name before…”

Lan Tu said thoughtfully, but he didn’t seem to remember anything.

“By the way, how did you get here?” Lan Tu looked at Lin Xiu, then asked.

He dodged with all his strength and was not struck by the lightning at all, but he was still a bit tired.

“Fight.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Fight? Me too. I was upset with a guy and had a fight with him in the library. In the end, I damaged some things and was fined and locked up.” Lan Tu said helplessly.

“En.” Lin Xiu replied, then continued to lie on the ground to rest.

He still experienced severe pain in his body but Lin Xiu also felt as if a special force was being transmitted into the body.

He took a closer look at the system interface and with the absorption of the ‘Engulf’ skill, he had already absorbed more than five million experience points!

Did he get more than five million experience points in such a short time?

And Lin Xiu also saw that this ‘Engulf’ skill was about to reach LV5! Once it reaches LV5, the speed of absorbing energy and experience should also increase.

“By the way, do you know how often these lightning strikes come?” Lin Xiu looked at Lan Tu at this time and asked.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s question, Lan Tu was stunned for a moment, then laughed and said, “Don’t worry, it wouldn’t be so fast, it won’t be dangerous, so please rest assured.”
