‘God warrior’ Battle

Give him the power of god again?

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the two seemed to have recalled something.

Combined with the familiar black spear that Lin Xiu was holding, they could be sure that was Lin Xiu, who they didn’t manage to kill and was robbed of their power of god. Lin Xiu!

“It’s you, kid!”

!!

Huangfu Gu roared at this time.

He was the one who was deprived of the power of god the most. He could remember clearly the time he spent in the Sage warrior Space.

Recently, in the God warrior Realm, they have already thought of a way to break the seal of the planet Namir and headed here directly.

Unexpectedly, now they meet Lin Xiu again.

“This time, you will die here!”

Huangfu Gu growled.

This time, the Sage warriors they possessed were stronger, so they can withstand more of their power.

“Wait and see.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

There was no sign of panic at all.

“Courting death!”

The two god warriors were already furious at this time.

Although the power was attached to the bodies of Huangfu Zhong and Huangfu Ling, the power they can use now is far stronger than that of ordinary Sage warriors.

At this moment, the two of them triggered their minds and the source strength in their bodies instantly converged into a golden long sword, which appeared in their hands.

The source strength is materialized and weapons appear?

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

In the next moment, the figures of the two disappeared and appeared on both sides of Lin Xiu.

Holding the golden long swords in their hands, they stabbed at Lin Xiu’s body at the same time!

Dangdang——

But Lin Xiu seemed to have anticipated their attack long ago and with a move of his hands, he blocked their attack.

wow-

And at this moment, the power of the dark energy ball on Lin Xiu’s neck began to bloom.

Starting from Lin Xiu’s body, a large amount of black energy surged towards the surroundings like a tide.

what is this!?

Huangfu Gu and Huangfu Tai wanted to continue attacking Lin Xiu.

But they didn’t expect that so much black energy would burst out from Lin Xiu’s body.

And they sensed that these dark energies were very dangerous.

At this time, their bodies instinctively retreated to the back.

However, this dark energy continued to attack the entire air like a tide at this time.

They looked at the matrices behind them, while holding the swords in their hands, they attacked those matrices.

bang bang bang-

With a loud noise, those matrices remained motionless.

Their attacks cannot break the matrix at all!

And at this time, those dark energies have already swept towards them!

‘Sphere’!

There was no way, at this time they unfolded ‘Sphere’ at the same time.

Because of their power of god, the unfolded ‘Spheres’ turned out to be pale golden.

Those dark energies, at this moment, were resisted by the ‘Sphere’ they unfolded.

But there was still a trace of dark energy that penetrated their ‘Sphere’.

And into their bodies.

pfft—

As these dark energies entered their bodies, they spat out a mouthful of blood at the same time.

At this moment, they all quickly mobilized the power in their body to clear out the dark energy that had penetrated inside.

After all, they are God warrior-level warriors. Although it is said that the power of the gods transmitted to the two people’s bodies is not their full power, they can still annihilate those dark attributes of energy from their own bodies.

“Damn boy…”

Huangfu Gu wiped the blood from his lips and clenched his hands.

If it wasn’t for their quick reaction to unfold the ‘Sphere’, they would be finished!

These dark energies are too destructive.

At this moment, Lin Xiu appeared in front of them with the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

‘Profound Intent· Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

Lin Xiu continued to use his skills.

Looking at the thousands of spear shadows stabbed out, Huangfu Gu and Huangfu Tai did not directly block the attacks.

They flashed and dodged directly to the other side.

“Die!”

Huangfu Gu roared angrily at this time.

The long sword in his hand was directly swung out at this time.

Whoosh whoosh—

The instant the long sword flew out, it turned into thousands of long swords.

All of them charged towards Lin Xiu’s body!

Dangdang-

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and his hands holding the Dark Edge spear danced wildly.

Those thousands of long swords that flew over were all blocked by Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear.

“Huangfu Tai, go!!!”

While Huangfu Gu continued to release thousands of long swords, he roared at Huangfu Tai on the other side.

At this moment, Huangfu Tai flashed and appeared behind Lin Xiu.

The long sword in his hand burst out with a dazzling golden light and he slashed directly at Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’!

Lin Xiu also clearly felt the Huangfu Tai who appeared behind him, but at this time, he resisted the thousands of long swords released by Huangfu Gu and there was no way he could resist the attack of Huangfu Tai who was attacking from behind!

boom–

The long sword full of golden light slashed at Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ in the next moment! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

With a loud noise, he remembered that Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ was directly split into two halves.

“Go to hell!!!”

Huangfu Gu shouted fiercely at this time.

Huangfu Tai’s special power is that he can use his source strength to condense an extremely sharp long sword and this long sword is designed to attack the ‘Sphere’ of warriors.

Can easily break the opponent’s “Sphere”!

And as Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ broke, the golden long sword continued to slash at Lin Xiu’s head.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu raised his left hand and grabbed the long sword.

Snapped–

The armor in his hand was instantly torn off by the golden long sword and Lin Xiu’s hand was also revealed.

Hand bones!?

Huangfu Tai also clearly saw it; Lin Xiu’s hands were golden bones, with no flesh at all.

“Get lost!”

While he was in shock, Lin Xiu stabbed his body with the Dark Edge spear in his hand!

The speed of this stab was very fast and Huangfu Tai thought that if Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” was broken, he would be attacked.

But he didn’t expect that even though the ‘Sphere’ was broken, Lin Xiu didn’t seem to be fighting back.

boom–

At this moment, the Dark Edge spear pierced through his chest.

Boom—

And on the Dark Edge spear that penetrated his chest, a large amount of dark blue flames bloomed.

Those flames instantly entered his body along with the Dark Edge spear!

Directly burn the flesh and blood in his body.

“what!!!”
