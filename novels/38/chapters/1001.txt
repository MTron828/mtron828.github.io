Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

With the appearance of this green source mark, in the next moment, a green light covered Huangfu Lin’s body.

Eh? Is it the healing source mark again?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu immediately raised his brows.

Soon, as the green light covered Huangfu Lin’s body, Huangfu Lin’s fractured fist was instantly repaired.

“Thanks.”

Huangfu Lin said to Huangfu Bai.

While he was talking, he looked towards Lin Xiu, and his eyes were full of coldness.

Snapped–

At the same time, Lin Xiu looked at the warriors who surrounded them and snapped his fingers.

boom boom boom —

The artificial angel who was originally half-kneeling on the ground, holding a shield in a defensive posture, seemed to be activated at this moment.

It made a loud noise.

Her originally dull eyes also lit up at this moment.

“What is this?”

Seeing this scene, Huangfu Zhong and Huangfu Lin frowned.

“Wait, this is…”

Huangfu Bai looked at the artificial angel who suddenly moved, as if he had thought of something and the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

Just now he thought it was just an ordinary large robot, but now that he thought about it, he seemed to have recalled something.

“Withdraw!!!”

he yelled.

But just as he finished speaking, this artificial angel, holding the spear in her hand, directly attacked the warrior in front of her!

Boom—

This blow directly killed dozens of top warriors.

And those warriors around were also affected by this blow and their bodies were directly impacted and flew out.

“Kill them all.”

Lin Xiu glanced at the surrounding warriors, then said lightly.

“How did you control No. 0?”

Huangfu Bai looked at this scene with a terrifyingly gloomy expression on his face. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

boom boom boom —

There was a constant sound of loud noises around and the whole ground seemed to vibrate wildly.

“Zero?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows, this old guy, does he know something?

“Old Bai, what is this?”

Huangfu Zhong and Huangfu Lin’s eyes were full of disbelief at this time.

He looked towards the front, the artificial angel was huge, but her movements were not slow at all.

Moreover, her body, they didn’t know what it was made of but it was so hard that no matter how powerful the skill of the warriors were, they could not cause any damage to her at all.

In an instant, a large number of these Respected warrior-level warriors died.

Looking at this scene, Huangfu Lin’s heart was bleeding.

These were the elite powers of the Divine Domain.

“One of the warriors who created this Sage warrior space is proficient in various technological creations.”

“It is said that he used his life’s energy to create an artificial angel whose strength is comparable to that of the Sage warrior.”

Moreover, the outer armor is made of the hardest metal in the world and even the skill of the Sage warrior may not be able to cause damage to it.

This is the most terrifying.

“Is this the thing?”

Huangfu Lin couldn’t help but said aloud.

An intelligent robot with strength comparable to that of a Sage warrior!

Just when they were in shock, Lin Xiu had already taken out the Dark Edge spear from the expansion space.

As the body’s source strength burst out, Lin Xiu directly attacked them!

“Since you guys want to give me experience, then I will accept it.”

Lin Xiu said lightly as he attacked with the Dark Edge spear.

Although Huangfu Lin and the others didn’t know what Lin Xiu said about giving experience.

However, when they saw Lin Xiu who was attacking, the expressions in their eyes changed slightly and at the same time they unfolded a ‘Sphere’!

boom–

The Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand swept straight away and directly attacked Huangfu Lin, Huangfu Bai and Huangfu Zhong!

Although the long spear didn’t directly cut through their ‘Sphere’, the powerful impact force made their bodies fly straight out.

After Huangfu Bai flew out for a distance, he stabilized his body.

He looked forward, looking at Lin Xiu who continued to charge with his spear, his eyes were also full of caution.

“This kid is hard to deal with, give me your best!”

Huangfu Bai said in a cold voice while directly pulling out the long sword behind him.

It seems that due to the transmission of source strength, the long sword he drew suddenly burst into dazzling light.

swoosh—

The long sword he was holding slashed into the air and all of a sudden, thousands of cold lights bloomed.

Directly charged towards Lin Xiu!

The surrounding space was opened up because of the large number of sword lights rushing past, as if it was about to be torn apart.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and the spear in his hand spun frantically.

Dangdang-

Those sword beams were all blocked by Lin Xiu in an instant.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu’s figure has appeared in front of Huangfu Bai!

The spear in his hand stabbed out and in an instant it was like a black dragon rushing out!

Looking at this scene, the pupils in Huangfu Bai’s eyes shrank slightly.

He wanted to dodge, but he couldn’t dodge at all!

boom boom boom —

The black dragon fluttered its teeth and claws, frantically charging towards Huangfu Bai’s ‘Sphere’.

Although the impact of this skill was very powerful, it was still blocked by Huangfu Bai.

And Huangfu Lin and Huangfu Zhong, also armed with weapons, attacked from both sides!

‘Sphere’!

Lin Xiu looked at the two who were attacking from the left and the right and with a thought, the dark blue ‘Sphere’ opened directly.

bang bang—

They attacked Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ with the long swords in their hands, but they were completely unable to break through Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

Instead, because of the dark blue flames on Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, the weapons that hit his ‘Sphere’ became extremely hot.

They felt a strong urge to toss their weapons away.

They had no choice, at this time, they can only stop the attack and retreat directly to the back.

“rise!!!”

When Huangfu Zhong stepped back, a turquoise source mark flashed on his forehead.

boom boom boom —

With the use of his Source mark power, the entire ground began to vibrate wildly.

There were also many huge cracks on the ground.

Huge blocks of rock were directly suspended in the air.

“go!”

Huangfu Zhong roared and at the next moment, these huge rocks charged directly toward Lin Xiu!

bang bang bang-

As those rocks hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, a loud noise continued to sound.

Lin Xiu was very strong in melee combat, so they distanced themselves to fight him.

At this time, with those huge rocks hitting Lin Xiu’s side, a thick layer of dust was instantly raised around him.
