Chapter 118: Gold Skill- ‘Without a Trace’

At this moment, Lin Xiu punched it directly in the head.

On the shore, without any water resistance, Lin Xiu had fully exerted the power of his ‘Rupturing fist’.

Also, with the enhancement of ‘Fury’, this power was multiplied, and even this rank 4 evolved beast had a deep dent in the skull after being hit by Lin Xiu as fresh blood flowed out in an instant.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 4 evolved beast. You’ve gained 350,000 experience points!”

“Phew.” Lin Xiu sat next to the Giant Turtle Whitefish and heaved a sigh of relief.

Thinking about what just happened, it was really dangerous.

If he hadn’t lured this Giant Turtle Whitefish ashore, there would be no way of dealing with it.

“Lin Xiu…” Just as Tian Zhi was about to say something, Lin Xiu had already jumped into the water.

He continued swimming and soon reached the place where he saw the Salt Crystal.

The Salt Crystal that looked like a white lotus was still lying there quietly.

Lin Xiu looked around and after he found that nothing appeared, his hand slowly approached the Salt Crystal.

Although this thing was made up of some special white particles, it appeared very hard.

Like a mushroom growing on a tree, Lin Xiu used a little force and broke it off from the black rock.

After that, Lin Xiu began swimming back.

“Are you all right?” Seeing Lin Xiu swimming out of the lake, Tian Zhi asked with concern.

Lin Xiu nodded, then took off his goggles, and stretched out his right hand. “This is the Salt Crystal, isn’t it?”

Tian Zhi looked at Lin Xiu’s hand and suddenly saw that huge Salt Crystal. He couldn’t help but gasp.

How could this thing be so big!?

And the shape was very beautiful.

“Yes, this is it, but look at this size, you wouldn’t find it in a hundred years…” Tian Zhi’s eyes widened and mumbled.

“How many do you need?” Lin Xiu asked Tian Zhi.

“Just a little bit, you just have to gently rub some particles off from the bottom.” Tian Zhi said excitedly at this moment, then he looked around in his backpack and took out a small unique box.

Lin Xiu nodded, then rubbed the bottom of the Salt Crystal in his hand, and some white particles slowly fell into Tian Zhi’s box.

This thing was really no different from the ordinary white salt.

But Lin Xiu knew that although they looked similar, the composition was very different.

“Enough! Thank you!” Looking at these salt-like particles in his box, Tian Zhi was extremely excited.

With this thing, his daughter’s illness would surely be cured!

“Thank you! Thank you!” He said to Lin Xiu earnestly.

“No problem.” Lin Xiu shook his head, he didn’t think it was much because he went down to look for something anyway.

Although he scratched out a small amount of Salt Crystal particles for him, the Salt Crystal still retained its shape of a white lotus and still looked the same.

‘This thing is so big, I wonder how much it can sell for…’

“Are you going to leave now?” Lin Xiu saw him packing up like he was going to leave.

“Yes, I’m going to rush back to the hospital and give this to the doctor to make drugs.” Tian Zhi nodded and said.

“Thank you so much.”

“It’s okay, but if I continued walking from here, where will it lead me?” Lin Xiu asked Tian Zhi.

The website of the Warrior Union did have a lot of information about the Path of Death that could mostly be purchased with money, but some not only asked for money but also required star ranking. For example, the information of the Path of Death’s routes would require one to be a two-star member in order to purchase to view.

“About 50 kilometers or so ahead, it’s probably the Azure Forest zone, but if you continue on, I’m not very certain because I’ve only heard about it from others and didn’t really go there myself,” Tian Zhi said with some regret at this moment.

He reached this area before and ran away after being attacked by some evolved beasts.

“Hmm, that’s fine.”

“By the way, this is for you.” After Tian Zhi packed up, he took out a wooden palm-sized box and said to Lin Xiu.

“What’s this?” Lin Xiu was surprised and asked.

“This is handed down by my warrior ancestor, it’s a Body skill, but I can’t learn it so I’ll give it to you.” Tian Zhi smiled and said.

‘Body skill!?’

Lin Xiu was already a rank 3 warrior and could cultivate Body skills now, as well as the previous gold skill – ‘Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall’.

“Well, it’s goodbye then.” Tian Zhi smiled at Lin Xiu, then walked in the original direction they came from.

Lin Xiu shook his head as he watched his retreating figure, then sat on the ground, and looked closely at the wooden palm-sized box.

Then, he opened it without hesitation.

“Gold body skill!?”

When he saw the body skill card in the box, Lin Xiu was shocked. Body skills were very expensive, much more expensive than ordinary skill cards, they were rare too. However, he never expected that Tian Zhi would actually give him a gold body skill.

At this moment, Lin Xiu was very moved, it seems that many things have causes and effects.

If he hadn’t helped that old uncle at the start, he would have fallen into the locusts’ trap and if he didn’t help Tian Zhi, he wouldn’t have gotten this Body skill.

“Gold body skill- ‘Without a Trace’!”

When Lin Xiu saw the name of this skill, he thought it sounded really cool. Then, without hesitation, Lin Xiu placed this dazzling gold Body skill card on his forehead slowly.

As he used this gold Body Skill card, Lin Xiu felt a lot of information surging in his mind. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

Soon, the card, which was initially glistening with a golden glow, slowly poured information into Lin Xiu’s mind and grew dimmed.

Lin Xiu stood up at this moment, then moved his body a bit. He felt as if he was walking on air and his speed was really fast!

He hadn’t used ‘Without a Trace’ skill, and he already felt that his whole body was light.

What a strong body skill!
