1198 Soul Armor

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly and at this critical moment, he had already unfolded his ‘Sphere’ to resist.

boom–

This punch directly hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

With the huge impact, an loud sound rang out.

Lin Xiu flew out the next moment and seemed like he was about to fly out of the battle platform!

But Lin Xiu quickly stabilized his body.

“Die!!!”

At this moment, Sun Qi shouted loudly and continued to charge at an extremely fast speed.

This time, he didn’t have a weapon in his hand, but used his fist to blast directly at Lin Xiu.

His whole body was covered by this translucent golden energy armor.

Even his fists were no exception.

“I didn’t expect that Sun Qi had already gathered the Soul and the Soul was actually an armor.”

Seeing this scene, Ling Yu said in surprise.

“What is the Soul?”

Baili Haoling said subconsciously.

Now, with this golden translucent energy armor covering his body, Sun Qi’s strength seems to have increased a lot.

Lin Xiu had the upperhand just now and was beating him up just now, but now, he has attacked Lin Xiu instead!

“Soul is a special kind of energy that can only be formed by a god warrior. There are thousands of shapes of the soul, each of which can endow the warrior with different powers.”

“And it is also very difficult for ordinary warriors to comprehend the soul.”

Sun Ruo, who was beside him, explained at this time.

He looked at Sun Qi on the platform and there was still surprise in his eyes.

The main reason for them to come to this barren city is to observe the Divine Soul Engraving, so as to understand their own Divine Soul.

One must know that even Sun Ruo and Ling Yu have not yet realized the divine soul!

“Boy, it’s your honor to see my divine soul power!” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At this time, Sun Qi frantically waved his fists and attacked Lin Xiu!

bang bang bang-

At this time, Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and used the body of the spear to block his attack.

At this moment, Sun Qi’s power seemed to suddenly become much stronger.

Is this the power of the divine soul?

To give him such a mighty power?

While Lin Xiu was shocked in his heart, his eyes narrowed slightly.

It is impossible to use ‘Fury’ now, because once you use it, he will enter a state of after-effects later, which will affect him too much.

“Go to hell!!!”

Seeing Lin Xiu continuously resisting his attacks, Sun Qi’s face became more and more ugly.

He roared angrily and continued to bombard Lin Xiu with his right hand!

boom–

Lin Xiu’s body was smashed to pieces at this moment!

The people around were also shocked when they saw this scene.

“No, he’s not dead!”

The city lord of Tianyi City quickly reacted.

Sun Qi, who was on the platform, also clearly felt something and suddenly turned around and looked in the air.

Looking at the scene in the sky, the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

Because in the sky, there are eight identical Lin Xiu!

“He can also do the clone technique!?”

When some warriors saw this scene, their faces were full of surprise.

The skill of Clone Technique is rarely used by warriors.

Moreover, Lin Xiu summoned so many clones at one time!

“Hmph, a bunch of puppets.”

When Sun Qi saw this scene, his face showed contempt.

Obviously, the one on the left in the sky is Lin Xiu’s real body.

He could clearly feel that the power of the rest of the ‘Lin Xiu’ was much weaker than the real one.

In other words, it is a kind of illusion that is similar to the clone technique that he uses and it is probably not as good as his own clone technique.

And Lin Xiu, who was in the sky, was already holding the spear in his hand and charged down!

Sun Qi snorted coldly, ignored the other ‘Lin Xiu’, raised his hand and attacked Lin Xiu’s body!

The fist in his hand collided directly with the spear Lin Xiu was holding!

boom–

He had a fist covered by a divine soul armor and it collided with the tip of Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear and an loud sound suddenly erupted.

Lin Xiu’s entire body, because of this incomparably huge impact, flew straight into the air.

But the other Lin Xiu’s ‘clone’ held a spear and stabbed directly at Sun Qi’s soul armor!

With the continuous use of the skill ‘Mirror Image’, the level of this skill is also increasing.

Not only can it be divided into seven clones at the same time, but each clone has 40% of the power of the main body.

Although only possessing 40% of the power of the main body is nothing to an ordinary God warrior, but at this time, seven warriors with 40% of Lin Xiu’s power attacked Sun Qi’s soul armor, still making the quite an impact to Sun Qi’s Soul Armor.

Kala-

A crisp sound sounded and a little crack appeared in his divine soul armor!

These clones all have power!?

pfft—

At this moment, he vomited out a mouthful of blood.

Not to mention, the simultaneous attacks of the seven warriors who possessed 40% of Lin Xiu’s power still caused him a lot of damage.

“Get lost!!!”

At this time, he roared angrily, before waiting for those Lin Xiu clones to attack again, his fists danced wildly.

As his fists danced, all of Lin Xiu’s clones were knocked out in the next moment.

As those clones hit the ground, an incomparably loud sound suddenly erupted.

At this moment, those clones all burst into smoke and disappeared.

rumbling rumbling—

And at this moment, he raised his eyes and looked into the air and he saw one after another of flaming birds, rushing down from the sky!

It’s this dark blue weird flame again!

“Humph!”

Seeing this scene, Sun Qi snorted coldly, his eyes filled with disdain.

Although the temperature of this flame is extremely high, he was using the soul power so he was unafraid.

“Get… out!!!”

Just when the flaming birds were about to hit Sun Qi’s body, Sun Qi roared and the entire divine soul armor burst into a strong light.

His Soul Armor mainly gives him strong defense and slightly increases his strength.

In this state, he believed that his soul armor would definitely be able to resist Lin Xiu’s attack!

“Hahaha, it’s useless! It’s useless!”

Sure enough, it was exactly as Sun Qi thought, those flaming birds impacted his body, but it only made him feel a burning sensation and did not cause any harm to him.

“Idiot.”

And Fu Tianyuan, who was on the high platform not far away, clearly noticed something at this time and said coldly.
