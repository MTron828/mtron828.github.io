Chapter 172: G17 Ruin

As soon as he walked out of the door, he realized that Luo Yue’s figure had long disappeared.

Lin Xiu was not surprised and walked directly to the meeting place.

As he knew that there was a ‘competition’ today, Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear had already been placed in the spear box and he went out with it on his back. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Our Class 10 seating is over here!” On the spacious field of the Sacred Domain Academy, there was already a crowd.”

Class 10 of the South Campus.

Lin Xiu saw the words on the ground and walked over there.

“Lin Xiu!” Seeing Lin Xiu coming over, Zhang Yin waved.

“En, line up, everyone. We’ll be starting the freshmen assembly at eight o’clock.” Lin Xiu nodded, then his gaze swept across everyone in the class and he said.

Lin Xiu was now very respected when he is in class.

Not only because of Lin Xiu’s strength, but he has been using his points to open the gravity room for them to train, which was very well-liked.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words at this time, they quickly lined up in a row.

“Come on, let me introduce her to everyone. This student has just transferred to our class. Her name is Luo…” At this time, on the other side, Nan Zhengjun slowly walked over with a girl in white.

“Luo Yue!?” Seeing the girl, Lin Xiu was stunned.

Why did she come here?

The students in class all knew that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue seem to have some kind of unexplained relationship and Lin Xiu had been training with her these days. At this moment, they began jeering.

“You guys know each other?” Nan Zhengjun was taken aback at this moment.

“Of course.” Lin Xiu nodded and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

Not only acquaintances but roommates living together…

“That’s good. She will be joining our class, you guys are not allowed to bully her ah.” Nan Zhengjun nodded and said aloud.

You should ask her not to bully us…

Lin Xiu muttered in his heart.

Luo Yue’s strength was now at the peak of rank 4 and was very close to reaching rank 5.

“Why did you join our class suddenly?” Lin Xiu saw Luo Yue standing next to him and asked curiously.

Luo Yue was originally in Class 1 and he would have to fight against her. The thought of Zhuo Qixing in her class made him a little uncomfortable.

“You guys are too weak, it wouldn’t be fun to crush all of you.” Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu and said indifferently.

Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched, but what she said really left him speechless.

There was indeed a gap in the strength of the people in his class from those in other classes.

At this time, he took a closer look and there were many unfamiliar faces on the opposite side.

On the ground at their side, one could clearly see Class 1 to Class 10 of the north campus.

So this Sacred Region Academy was actually divided into the North and the South campus.

The freshmen at the North Campus seemed to arrive at the Sacred Region Academy earlier than them.

“Everyone, welcome to the Sacred Region Academy after passing all the tests. I believe that in the past few days, you have all learned about the Sacred Region Academy, right?” At this moment, an old man with long hair and a long beard stood on the high platform over there and said aloud.

He didn’t use any loudspeaker, but when he spoke, the sound seemed to pass into everyone’s ears.

Dean of the Sacred Region Academy?

Just standing there, everyone felt a strong sense of oppression from him.

This is the strength of a rank 9 warrior!?

“My name is Baili, you can call me Dean Baili.” The old man glanced at the thousands of people in the audience and said lightly.

“I won’t talk too much nonsense today. According to the practice of the Sacred Region Academy, we are going to have a freshmen assembly.”

“It can also be said to be a freshmen test.”

Test!?

Hearing what he said, everyone’s expressions changed slightly.

Could it be that the previous test on the Path of death was not the real test?

Dean Baili snapped his fingers at this time and two huge projections appeared in front of him in an instant.

“This test, no, it should be called a competition, will be held in two venues.”

“The first one is the Emerald Forest.”

At this moment, a forest covered in greenery could be seen on the screen and some evolved beasts flashed by from time to time.

The Emerald Forest was in the southern region. The trees there were affected by radiation and became very huge, and there were many high-ranking evolved beasts in there.

But as long as you didn’t go deep in the forest, it wasn’t too dangerous.

“All the students are allowed to go to this area. The class that collects the most Odd Crystals here will immediately win. In addition to the points rewards, there are also various skills that are not sold on the market.”

Hearing this, the eyes of these people couldn’t help but brighten.

Skills that weren’t sold in the market must be very strong and precious.

“The second area is the G17 Ruin.”

As Dean Baili spoke, everyone’s eyes turned to the other projection.

This was an abandoned city, surrounded by darkness and there was some acid rain in the sky.

In these abandoned cities, you could still see some zombies and terrifying evolved beasts.

This map was obviously different from the Emerald Forest just now, it looks dark and terrifying, and it made people feel uncomfortable just looking at it.

“The G17 Ruin… this will be deadly…” Seeing this map, Li Ping trembled.

“You know this place?” Lin Xiu asked.

Li Ping nodded, “A very powerful virus broke out in this area that year. Some warriors went over to carry out ‘clean-up’ missions, but they were all infected and turned into zombies.”

It was very scary when ordinary people become zombies but when these warriors turned into zombies, they were even crazier. When they see human beings, they would go wild and attack.

They don’t feel pain at all and there was no other way to kill them other than to cut off their heads.

“Almost all the evolved beasts in there are rank 4 and above, and I heard that there are also rank 7 ones…:” After saying this, there was a hint of fear in Li Ping’s eyes.

After listening to Li Ping, the rest of the people felt a chill down their spines.

What is a rank 7 evolved beast like?

It could probably kill all of them with just one slap.

“It is not necessary for everyone to go to the G17 Ruin, you can pick five people from the class.” Hearing what Dean Baili said, these people heaved a sigh of relief.

After all, it was too dangerous there. If you got attacked and infected by those warriors who have become zombies, there will be no cure.

“If all of you are ready, let your teachers lead you out!!!”
