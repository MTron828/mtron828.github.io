Chapter 691 Qian Jin’s Strength

Lin Xiu looked at them at this time, and then said lightly.

“Humph!”

Lei Tong also looked at those people a little angrily at this time.

“Is it a little too much?”

And at this time, Qian Jin, who was known as the second person on the Tianjiao list, also stood up and looked at Lin Xiu.

He could clearly feel that Lin Xiu was not a good person to deal with.

Where did he come from?

Thinking of this, Qian Jin’s eyes couldn’t help but flash a hint of doubt.

“It should be obvious who started it, right?”

Lin Xiu didn’t have any fear in his eyes and said.

“Shall we head out and have some fun?”

Qian Jin looked around, saw the frown of the boss, and said lightly.

“Just for fun.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said.

This drink shop was not a good place to fight, and the battle would affect too many people.

At this time, the two of them walked directly outside the door.

Opposite this drink shop was a wide square.

At this time, there were no people in the square, only some warriors who had just signed up were walking around.

“Let’s go.”

Lei Tong and the others walked out at this time.

The men who were with Qian Jin did not hesitate, and rushed to the opposite side at the same time.

Those who witnessed what just happened in the drink shop were now rushing out as if they wanted to join in the excitement.

“An outsider who actually confronts Qian Jin is simply courting death!”

“There’s a good show to watch.”

“I’m guessing he can’t last five seconds.”

Some warriors whispered while walking to the opposite square.

“That guy, is he really a rank 9 warrior?”

Although Lei Tong seemed very enthusiastic just now, after calming down, he was still a little worried.

“That’s right, it is said that Qian Jin is about to be promoted to a Master Warrior.” Chen Lan nodded and said.

There was also a look of nervousness on his face.

If Lin Xiu was defeated, these people probably wouldn’t give up so easily.

“You use a spear?”

Qian Jin looked at the long spear that Lin Xiu was carrying, and suddenly said lightly.

“You use a sword? It doesn’t look like much.”

Lin Xiu didn’t answer his words, looked at the long sword in his hand, and said lightly. At this moment, the two of them stood on the empty space in the middle of the square, facing each other, and there seemed to be a burst of fire in the air.

“Interesting, it’s the first time I’ve heard someone say that.”

Qian Jin laughed loudly, and in the next moment, his figure flashed, and he rushed towards Lin Xiu!

“What a fast speed!!!”

Those warriors who saw this scene not far away had shocked expressions in their eyes.

Because in their eyes, Qian Jin’s figure just flashed, as if he teleported and appeared in front of Lin Xiu!

Dang–

Just when Qian Jin waved the long sword in his hand and wanted to split Lin Xiu in half, Lin Xiu took down the Dark Edge spear he was carrying and easily blocked his sword!

“Interesting.”

Qian Jin saw that Lin Xiu blocked his attack, as if he had expected it and wasn’t surprised at all.

Dang dang

At the next moment, the two of them held the weapons in their hands and attacked each other frantically at the same time!

A loud metal collision sounded suddenly.

“Falling Flowers and Flowing Water’!”

Seeing Lin Xiu holding the spear in his hand and fighting him at a distance, Qian Jin frowned slightly, and the long sword in his hand swiped in the air, and energy bodies that looked like water splashes rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu looked at these strange things, and instead of resisting, he activated his ‘Without a Trace’ movement technique.

At this moment, the whole person’s body seemed to be transformed into impenetrable phantoms, and they dodged directly.

Those bland things that looked like splashes of water hit the ground where Lin Xiu was just now, instantly causing pits to appear there! It could be seen that the power of Qian Jin’s skill was still very great.

Lin Xiu looked at Qian Jin and wanted to attack Qian Jin at close range. With a wave of the Dark Edge spear in his hand, flaming birds burst out one after another!

‘Awe of the phoenix’!!! What kind of skill is this!?

Those warriors who watched the battle not far away were full of surprise in their eyes.

Because they ahd never seen this kind of skill.

This skill was really gorgeous. With Lin Xiu’s waving, dozens or hundreds of flaming birds appeared.

These flaming birds were circling frantically in the air, and then they rushed towards Qianjin in all directions!

Even if those warriors stood far away from Lin Xiu, they could clearly feel that the temperature of the surrounding air had rapidly increased!

Qian Jin looked at the flaming birds that were charging over, and the expression in his eyes suddenly changed.

At this moment, the body began to dodge quickly. Boom boom boom —

These flaming birds kept hitting the ground, causing the whole ground to vibrate wildly.

Damn it!

Qian Jin didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would be able to unleash such a powerful skill at this time. For a while, he was also a little flustered.

There was really no way for him to dodge, so he just unfolded the ‘Sphere’!

The ‘Sphere’ that emitted a strong white light instantly blocked all the flaming birds that were madly charging over.

“Is this the ‘Sphere’ of a peak rank 9 warrior…”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes when he saw this scene.

Now, not only did he not feel the fear, but because of the surging fighting spirit, he was a little excited.

Becoming stronger when he meets a strong opponent!

Qian Jin stared at Lin Xiu on the opposite side, his long sword slashed into the air, and a terrifying sword aura charged directly toward Lin Xiu!

Swoosh,

This sword aura seemed to be able to break open the space, making a huge sound.

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened, and the Dark Edge spear he held in both hands directly blocked the attack!

Because the speed of this sword aura was really too fast, it was still a bit difficult to dodge completely.

Boom

As the sword aura hit Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear, the strong impact force made Lin Xiu’s body fly to the back.

Blocked!?

Seeing this scene, Qian Jin had a look of surprise in his eyes, because the sword aura he unleashed could even cut a super tough weapon in half directly.

But what he didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu’s body merely flew out. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Qian Jin didn’t hesitate any longer, holding the long spear in his hand, he continued to charge out!

At the moment of rushing out, the long sword in his hand was constantly waving, and the terrifying sword aura continued to charge toward Lin Xiu!

As long as Lin Xiu didn’t dodge, he would be cut in half by this terrifying sword aura!
