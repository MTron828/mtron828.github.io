1264 Rollie with a Warhammer

Rollie’s mouth was wide open, but it didn’t try to suck those warriors into its body.

But at this moment, with a flash of light, it seemed that something spat out from its mouth.

Taking a closer look, it was a huge warhammer!

‘Shining Giant Hammer’!

It was the warhammer that Lin Xiu got in the lottery.

As the shining giant hammer spit out from Rollie’s mouth, Rollie’s hand suddenly stretched out and grabbed the handle of the shining giant hammer.

“what?”

Lin Xiu’s eyes obviously noticed this scene and his eyes widened in surprise.

Before, he thought that Rollie wanted to devour this weapon, but he didn’t expect that Rollie seemed to store this shining giant hammer in his body, intending to use it as a weapon!

Rollie has always looked chubby. Lin Xiu was even more surprised to see it stretch out a pair of small hands at this time.

“Gugu!!!”

Seeing those warriors besieging Xiaobai, Rollie seemed to be angry.

Holding the shining warhammer, it attacked those warriors!

This shining warhammer was already very huge. As it swung the hammer, even if those warriors unfolded the ‘Sphere’, they would all be blown away by the hammer!

The shining warhammer exuded a dazzling light and as Rollie danced, it crazily hammered at the surrounding warriors.

Even warriors of the Sage warrior level couldn’t resist this blow!

“So strong?”

Baili Haoling was holding a pair of swords and was fighting with several warriors around her.

Seeing the Rollie movements over there, she was very surprised.

And she also clearly felt that the shining giant hammer exploded with even stronger power after Rollie used it.

This is too amazing.

Rollie was still frantically dancing the shining giant hammer, knocking out a large number of warriors.

Taking advantage of this moment, Xiaobai also opened its mouth wide, spraying out a large amount of frosty air. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Those warriors were affected by the frosty air and instantly turned into ice sculptures.

They fell from the sky to the ground and broke into countless pieces.

Baili Haoling was watching the battle over at Rollie’s side, but at this time the surrounding God warriors had already continued to attack!

“Humph!”

Baili Haoling quickly came to her senses, holding the two swords in her hands, she started to fight.

With two swords in both hands, she crazily attacked the warriors who were attacking around her.

The best defense is offense!

And after her strength reached the God warrior level, she became even stronger.

Against these fighters, she was on par with them!

“Thank you for your lightning power.”

At the same time, Lin Xiu looked at Liu Mo who continued to fly towards him and the corners of his mouth curled up.

“What’s the use of talking so much bullsh*t?”

Although Liu Mo wished to tear Lin Xiu’s body into pieces, at this moment, he still kept a sneer on his face.

“Of course it’s useful.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

Before Liu Mo could attack again, Lin Xiu waved his right hand and a red lotus fire was instantly released!

Seeing the slap-sized red lotus fire rushing towards him, Liu Mo said coldly, “Small tricks.”

He didn’t even unfold the ‘Sphere’. At this moment, he was about to extinguish the red lotus fire with his hand.

Boom——

But the moment his hand touched the red lotus fire, there was an extremely loud sound.

This red lotus fire, like a bomb exploded, made an extremely loud sound and the entire flame directly covered Liu Mo’s body.

But in the next moment, the red lotus flames covering Liu Mo’s body began to slowly disappear.

“Hm?”

Lin Xiu frowned when he saw this scene.

“You think you can hurt me with a mere flame.”

Liu Mo still said coldly.

“Your hair is burnt.”

Lin Xiu pointed to Liu Mo’s hair.

“…”

Liu Mo remained expressionless for a moment and the next moment, he roared angrily: “I want you to die!!!”

He felt that Lin Xiu was really annoying, so he must be killed!

...

Whoosh—

The blood-red long sword in his hand was thrown out the next moment.

The blood-red long sword that came out of his hand directly turned into tens of thousands.

Moreover, these long swords did not directly stab at Lin Xiu, but combined into a sharp cone, then charged toward Lin Xiu!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, there was no fear in his eyes.

The ‘Heavenly Array’ was directly activated!

With the use of the ‘Heavenly Array’, Lin Xiu obviously felt that his body’s strength had increased a lot.

On the fist of the right hand, there were also a lot of hellfire erupting.

Seeing the thousands of long swords coming towards them like a cone, Lin Xiu directly blasted them with his fist!

Boom——

When Lin Xiu’s fist blasted out, an even bigger fist suddenly appeared, which collided with the cone formed by thousands of long swords.

...

“what!!!”

Lin Xiu roared angrily. At this moment, he directly activated the skill of ‘Fury’!

Originally, his strength had improved because of ‘Heavenly Array’. Now, after using the skill ‘Fury’, his strength has been greatly improved.

The power of this punch was also much stronger.

In the next moment, the cone-shaped attack composed of thousands of long swords was directly impacted by the power of Lin Xiu’s fist and collapsed.

Poof——

At this time, Liu Mo also spat out a mouthful of blood.

Looking at Lin Xiu not far away, his eyes were full of shock.

how can that be!

He clearly felt that Lin Xiu was weaker than his own, but at this moment, Lin Xiu’s strength had greatly improved.

And it was not just a little bit!

This kid has taken forbidden drugs!? Or did he burn his own vitality to forcibly increase his strength?

Liu Mo didn’t have time to think about it, because at this moment, Lin Xiu had already swung his fist with hellfire and smashed it over!

Looking at the fist that appeared in front of him, Liu Mo didn’t react for a while and was directly hit in the face by Lin Xiu’s fist.

boom–

With a dull sound, Liu Mo’s body flew out directly.

Blood flowed from his mouth and nose.

Looking at Liu Mo who flew out, Lin Xiu continued to chase after him.

In a flash, he appeared behind him again and continued to punch his body.

Bang bang bang——

He kept attacking Liu Mo crazily. At this time, Liu Mo was like a sandbag being beaten and flew around by Lin Xiu constantly.

“die!!!”

With the last punch, Lin Xiu punched Liu Mo’s chest from top to bottom directly to the ground!

Whoosh—

Liu Mo’s body instantly fell to the ground.

The whole ground shook violently.
