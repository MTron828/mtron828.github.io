Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Ning Tianluo was completely shocked at this time.

“Impossible, impossible, the Ye family, we have already killed all of them back then…”

Ning Tianluo then shook his head and mumbled to himself.

“Oh? It seems that you also participated.”

Lin Xiu heard his words. Suddenly his eyes narrowed slightly.

“So what!”

Ning Tianluo snorted coldly and black energy burst out from his body.

He wanted to use his domain force.

swoosh—

But at this moment, Lin Xiu waved his right hand and white energy burst out at the same time.

As this white energy bloomed, his domain force disappeared instantly.

The pupils in Ning Tianluo’s eyes shrank a little when he clearly noticed this situation.

And without waiting for him to make a move, Lin Xiu’s figure instantly disappeared.

Then he appeared in front of Ning Tianluo!

At this moment, the Dark Edge spear in his hand attacked Ning Tianluo!

Dang–

Ning Tianluo held the sword in his hand to resist.

But the impact of Lin Xiu’s attack was so terrifying that his hands instantly felt numb for a while.

Moreover, Lin Xiu’s offensive was not at all sloppy.

Under the frantic attack of the spear, Ning Tianluo could no longer hold the sword in his hand.

Even the sword was directly knocked out!

And in the next moment, this long spear will attack Ning Tianluo.

bang bang bang-

At this time, Ning Tianluo had already unfolded his ‘Sphere’, but Lin Xiu’s offensive continued to attack his ‘Sphere’.

With a loud sound, Ning Tianluo who thought that his “Sphere” was indestructible had a large number of cracks appearing on his ‘Sphere’!

Ning Tianluo’s eyes widened, his body moved, his body skill was displayed and he was about to leave!

He already felt the gap between himself and Lin Xiu and he didn’t want to fight at all, he just wanted to leave quickly.

Whoosh whoosh—

When his body skill was displayed, his whole body seemed to be transformed into phantoms and he fled frantically in an instant.

But Lin Xiu’s body skill was even faster.

The body disappeared in place and instantly appeared on the other side.

“Where are you going?”

Ning Tianluo, who had fled to the other side, found Lin Xiu’s figure in front of him!

Damn it!

The pupils in Ning Tianluo’s eyes shrank slightly and after cursing, he turned to flee to the other side.

But just when he wanted to escape, he found that the front side was blocked by a large number of matrices and there was no way to escape!

With his eyes wide open, he looked around and found that the surrounding space was surrounded by a large number of translucent matrices.

These matrices formed an elliptical space, so Ning Tianluo who was inside had no way to escape.

bang bang bang-

He waved his fist and frantically attacked the matrix. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

But no matter how he attacked, these matrices seemed to remain intact.

There was absolutely no way to break this matrix!

There was no way!

The strength of his whole body was gathered in his hands and he was about to tear the space and escape.

But at this moment, he was shocked to find that he couldn’t tear this space apart at all!

What exactly is going on!?

“This was learned in your dungeon.”

“The power of rules, isn’t it?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“The power of rules… Impossible, you can’t learn it!”

Ning Tianluo heard Lin Xiu’s voice from behind, turned to look at Lin Xiu who was approaching, his eyes widened and he said in disbelief.

In the dungeon, there was indeed the power of rules.

But it was left over by the previous city lord and it has been more than a hundred years.

That city lord had entered the realm of warrior god.

He has already left the planet Namir.

“You can feel it now, don’t you?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

In the space formed by this matrix, there is already a specific rule force.

The power of rules was to make it impossible for anyone other than Lin Xiu to use the power of space.

Therefore, it is impossible for Ning Tianluo to break through the space and escape.

Ning Tianluo’s face at this time has become extremely ugly.

“The real Bai family is in the holy city, they are the main force that participated in the killing of the Ye family!”

“Boy, you are dead meat!”

Ning Tianluo roared at this time.

“That’s none of your business.”

Lin Xiu ignored Ning Tianluo’s words and at the same time, all the source strength he had just absorbed with ‘Source Strength Control’ gathered in the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand!

At this time, the Dark Edge spear also burst into dazzling light.

hu—

Lin Xiu took a deep breath at this moment and at the next moment, the Dark Edge spear in his hand waved directly into the air!

‘Profound Intent: Awe of the phoenix’!!!

A large number of flaming birds burst out at this moment.

These hundreds of flaming birds instantly gathered together to form a huge flaming phoenix, which charged directly towards Ning Tianluo!

The entire space, because of the appearance of the flaming phoenix, seems to be a melting core of a large furnace.

Incredibly hot.

“Get away from me!!!”

When Ning Tianluo saw this scene, he roared in his heart.

The source strength of the whole body also burst out at this time.

With a wave of his hands, a huge black-red flame was also released from his body.

This time, he used all the source strength of his body to form this huge black-red flame.

And the black-red flames turned into the shape of a huge alien beast at this moment.

Pouncing towards the flaming phoenix that was charging over!

“what!!!”

Ning Tianluo roared loudly and the strength of his whole body was completely released!

The flaming phoenix and the black-red flame beast collided together and a strong and dazzling light suddenly appeared.

But obviously, the crazy energy of this flame was even more powerful.

At the next moment, the black and red flames began to be madly impacted by the flames. They gradually weakened, then began to disappear.

“No!”

Looking at this scene, Ning Tianluo’s eyes widened and he roared loudly.

This was the flame he unleashed with all his strength and it disappeared!?

While he was roaring furiously, the flaming phoenix had already impacted his body!

And the moment the flaming phoenix hit his body, it formed a flame tornado and swept across his body frantically.

Ning Tianluo’s body turned into a skeleton at a speed visible to the naked eye, then completely disappeared.
