Chapter 473: The Tide of Zombies Is Approaching!

Seeing this scene, the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed.

Xing Yao City’s personnel were all low in combat strength and the strength of these zombies should be very high.

At least rank 5 zombies.

And at this time, when he looked over there, Lin Xiu could clearly see that the people who were bitten by the zombies just now had turned into zombies. They slowly got up and ran to the other side.

Looking towards the city gate, there were more and more zombies as the water rushed to this side. They climbed the city gate and were entering Xing Yao City!

Near the city gate was the Xing Yao Academy. Obviously, the next one to bear the brunt would be Xing Yao Academy.

“Let’s go help.” Lin Xiu stared at this scene and said to Luo Yue.

Luo Yue nodded, she didn’t care about saving people or anything, she just followed because Lin Xiu wanted to save people.

The speed of the two was very fast and they rushed downstairs in a while.

There was still some distance from here to the city gate. At this time, Lin Xiu put force on his legs and used the ‘Without a Trace’ body skill.

Although the evasion ability of this body skill was not very good, it could increase his speed.

“Damn it, how could there be such a darn thing?!” The teachers and leaders in Xing Yao Academy looked at the zombies that hit the gate of Xing Yao Academy and their expression changed drastically.

Fortunately, Xing Yao Academy has a defensive system. The entire gate was quickly closed and a large number of laser guns installed on the gate shot at the zombies that rushed over.

Swish swish swish——

With the sound of breaking through the air, some zombies were directly penetrated through their heads and bodies, lying on the ground.

But those zombies that came from the flood and awakened after many years still did not die!

Those laser guns shot through their bodies, but it seemed that they had no effect at all.

“The strength of these zombies… at least rank 5 and above…” A middle-aged man said, breaking out in cold sweats.

The dean of Xing Yao Academy was only a rank 4 warrior.

“Luo Li! Take the students in your class and run flee. Your class is the weakest, don’t let them all die!” A middle-aged man looked at Luo Li behind him and said aloud.

“Yes.” Although it was very uncomfortable to hear that, Luo Li knew that the situation was urgent now and there was no way to think about this.

Now in the center of the Xing Yao Academy’s field, there were already several aircraft there.

The students of the entire Xing Yao Academy rushed over there anxiously.

“Dean, you go!” At this time, a man said to an old man standing in front of him. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“No, you go, Xing Yao Academy can’t be destroyed this way!” The old man looked at the door of the Xing Yao Academy in the distance, then shook his head and said.

There was an extremely firm look in his eyes, which surprised the people behind him.

“But…” When a man wanted to persuade him, there was a sudden loud noise and the floor began shaking.

A closer look, there was a crack in the gate of Xing Yao Academy!

How could this be!!!

The people who discovered this scene were shocked. The gate of Xing Yao Academy was made of special material and it actually cracked!

Click, click, click——

Soon, the crack grew bigger and bigger and the arms of the zombies stretched in from the crack.

“Ah!!!”

Seeing this scene, many people yelled, the whole scene was a mess.

“Hurry up, get on the aircraft quickly!!!”

“Don’t squeeze!”

“Teacher Luo! Zhang Xiaoai is still over there in the classroom!” Yang Tian ran over from the other side at this moment and said to Luo Li out of breath.

“What!?” Hearing Yang Tian’s words, the expression in his eyes changed.

“Why is she still in the classroom!?”

The gate of Xing Yao Academy was the one closest to their class. If they didn’t take the aircraft and leave, it would spell trouble!

Boom——

At the next moment, a huge sound rang again and the gate of Xing Yao Academy burst open!

“She’s there!” Yang Tian looked to the front and saw the girl named Zhang Xiaoai. She was carrying a schoolbag and seemed anxious to rush over to the center of the field.

It was too late.

But at this time everyone saw the zombies rushing in from the broken academy gate behind her.

These zombies had sinister faces and they look horrifying.

“I’m going to save her!” Yang Tian saw this scene and rushed down there.

“Shut up! With your strength, you will die if you go down!” An academy leader stood in front of Yang Tian at this time and said coldly.

“Forget about her, she’s just a useless student in Teacher Luo’s class. Let’s hurry up and let the Class 1 go first!”

“What do you mean!!!” Hearing the man’s words, Luo Li became angry and pulled his collar.

“Luo Li! Are you trying to rebel!” The academy leader was so angry that Luo Li grabbed his collar.

And the girl called Zhang Xiaoai looked behind her and saw a large number of zombies rushing toward her!

This horrifying scene made her face pale suddenly.

Her whole body seemed to have lost all strength.

Seeing the zombie rushing in the front with a hideous face, a mouth with two rows of white teeth was about to bite her. However, a cold light flashed and the head of this zombie was directly chopped off!

Blood splashed on the ground in a flash.

“This…what’s going on!?” Yang Tian, who originally wanted to rush down to save her, couldn’t help but widen his eyes when he saw this scene.

Two figures, two white figures appeared below.

The speed of these two people was very fast, waving their weapons in their hands and attacking the group of zombies.

Even the dean of Xing Yao Academy didn’t seem to be able to see their figure clearly. He saw a lot of cold light flashing and all the terrifying zombies were dismembered.

Blood and stumps were everywhere on the ground.

Boom——

And in the next moment, the entire sky seemed to be covered with flames!

This shocking scene made all the teachers and students of Xing Yao College on the field stunned.
