Chapter 738: Source Mark Ability – ‘Brilliant Star’!

What’s going on, what’s going on!!!

In this short period of time, how could this kid’s strength increase so much!

This was simply beyond Huangji’s imagination.

“Damn boy…”

Huangji frantically used the source strength of his body and it was released from his body steadily!

[Hidden Source Technique]!

He has no choice but to use his last resort.

Originally, a lot of source strength was consumed, but at this time, it was quickly replenished.

And in the next moment, with the replenishment of source strength, his ‘Sphere’ also became stronger.

“Boy! Your skills can’t break through my defenses!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu was still madly waving the Dark Edge spear in his hand to attack him, Huang Ji suddenly shouted loudly.

After being replenished with a lot of source strength, his ‘Sphere’ was indestructible!

Boom—

But at this moment, the surrounding ground suddenly made a loud noise.

At this moment, the entire ground also shook and a lot of snowflakes fluttered.

He looked to the front and saw the space there, it seemed that a hole had been opened!

“This... what’s going on here!?”

Looking at the broken hole, Huangji’s eyes widened.

How could a space crack suddenly appear? Even he didn’t know it.

And the opening of this space crack is very long!

boom–

At the next moment, the hole seemed to be pulled open from the inside and a huge black arm suddenly stretched out from the space crack.

boom–

As soon as the huge black arm came out, it slammed heavily on the ground, making a loud noise.

What... what monster...

When Huangji saw this scene in his eyes, he couldn’t help swallowing secretly and his body trembled slightly.

This feeling, as if facing this extremely terrifying creature.

It seems to be comparable to a king-level evolved beast, no, it seems to be a creature even more terrifying than a king-level.

It’s about to come out of this space crack!

“I’ll kill you!!!”

Huangji roared angrily. At this time, he didn’t think much about it. Looking at Lin Xiu who was still madly attacking his ‘Sphere’ in front of him, he roared suddenly.

Holding the long sword in his hand, he turned from defense to attack!

His swordsmanship was extremely fierce and the source strength covered the long sword. Every time he slashes, there would be long and thin sword beams.

Sword beams flew out continuously, impacting Lin Xiu’s body.

Dangdang-

The long sword and the long spear collided, making a loud noise.

Huangji was furious and used his terrifying power, but even so, they were still evenly matched!

Impossible! Impossible!

He roared loudly in his heart.

He didn’t understand why Lin Xiu’s strength could increase so much in a short period of time!

This level of improvement was impossible no matter what external objects were used!

Even if a special medicinal liquid could stimulate the human body’s potential in a short period of time, even if it burns life, the energy stimulated could only reach a certain level.

How is it possible that it would be stimulated to such an extent?

And at this time, the monster from the space crack seems to be rushing out soon!

Although he didn’t know what’s going on, Huangji still vaguely feels that this thing has something to do with Lin Xiu!

At this critical moment, the source mark on Huangji’s forehead instantly lit up!

Source mark Ability – ‘Brilliant Star’!

With the use of the power of the source mark, the source mark on Huangji’s forehead suddenly burst into dazzling white light and a pattern was instantly reflected on his whole body!

What’s this!?

Lin Xiu, who originally wanted to continue to pursue the victory, suddenly felt as if his body was being restrained by something.

At this moment, he couldn’t move!

Can’t move! This is fatal!

If the body is immobilized and unable to move, ‘Mirror image’ cannot be used.

“Die!”

Huangji roared angrily and in the next moment, he immediately rushed in front of Lin Xiu.

The long sword in his hand, because of the terrifying source strength, was filled with terrifying white light in the next moment.

This sword is a sword full of mighty power!

You... go to hell!

Huangji’s eyes widened, he clenched his teeth and the long sword stabbed out instantly!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and he felt a threat of death.

And now, he has no way to expand the ‘Sphere’ at all!

This Huangji’s source mark power was really weird, it felt like he’s shackled all over.

Source strength was completely bounded!

Huangji’s face was hideous, the next moment, the tip of the long sword stabbed directly into Lin Xiu’s forehead!

Got him! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Dang–

But at this critical moment, a golden light burst out from Lin Xiu’s body.

What exactly is going on?!

Seeing the golden light bursting out of Lin Xiu’s body, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

Dang–

The tip of the long sword stabbed Lin Xiu in the forehead, as if it had stabbed some indestructible metal and a crisp sound suddenly burst out.

How can it be!

My long sword has no way to penetrate his head!

Roar–

And just when he wanted to continue the attack, there was a loud roar.

This loud roar seems to be able to shatter demons!

A strong gust of wind, along with this roar, directly sent Huangji to the back.

“King...Is this a king-level evolved beast!?”

On the other side, Xue Liantian’s subordinates, their legs trembled at this time, looking at the terrifying creature that appeared from the space crack.

This is a fierce beast with a head like a devil and the beast’s limbs are thick and long, the claws are also huge and there are a pair of bat-like wings behind it.

Its body is very huge, so huge that it looked like a building.

It looked at Huangji who was hit by his roar over there, stretched out its hand and slapped!

Huangji, who was sent flying out, looked up and saw the huge black claws that were coming.

At the same time he was startled, he quickly moved his body and jumped to the other side.

The monster that came out of the space crack...!

From the terrifying sense of oppression, you can feel that the strength of this monster is definitely at the level of a king!

And what made him even more frightened was that this evolved beast only attacked him, not Lin Xiu.

Which meant the appearance of this evolved beast was related to Lin Xiu!

Just one Lin Xiu gave Huangji a headache and with an evolved beast of this level, he would be dead!
