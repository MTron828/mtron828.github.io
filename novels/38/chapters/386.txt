Chapter 387: Trouble

Lin Xiu screamed with his fist clenched together. Then, he struck the Lightning Bird that was coming in his direction!

Kong kong – –

As Lin Xiu’s fist landed on the body of the Lightning Bird that was dashing towards him, it let out a loud roar.

At the same time, the Lightning Bird was thrown into the air and landed far away.

Although the lightning wouldn’t work on these birds, Lin Xiu’s punch had an additional power of the Rupturing Fist which managed to injure the Lightning Bird from the inside to the outside.

Lin Xiu continued waving his hands and was continuously hitting Lightning Birds who were swiftly heading in his direction.

“What’s the matter?! Is my student alright?” Nan Zhengjun was the closest to this area. He immediately arrived at the scene when he heard the news.

Since he was a teacher at the Sacred Region Academy, it was easy for him to reach the mountain top. Then, he saw the guards who were frozen on the spot as he reached the gates. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Seeing the scene right before his eyes, he got even more worried. He quickly walked past the few guards who were standing in front and as he entered the area, he saw a huge Lightning Bird that was thrown in his direction!

When he noticed what was headed towards him, the look in his eyes changed and within seconds, he swiftly moved his boy and dodged the bird.

Li Li – –

The bird that was now on the floor started shivering and it let out a weak, trembling cry.

It was obvious that the Lightning Bird got attacked which explained why it was in this state. He initially thought that the Lightning Bird wanted to attack him instead.

Then, Nan Zhengjun looked towards the other side and noticed that there were a lot of other Lightning Birds on the ground. All of them were trying to move their wings while wimping continuously.

What just happened here?!

Nan Zhengjun stared at the scene with his eyes wide open and had a surprised look on his face.

“Shit… It’s so difficult to deal with these things…” Lin Xiu placed both his hands on his knees and started panting.

When Nan Zhengjun heard the familiar voice, he looked towards the direction from where the voice came and saw Lin Xiu who was in a terrible state. His clothes were ruined and his hair was standing on ends.

“Lin Xiu!” As soon as he saw Lin Xiu’s figure, Nan Zhengjun instantly dashed towards Lin Xiu.

After making sure that Lin Xiu wasn’t severely injured, he let out a breath of relief. Lin Xiu was a really good student and may have the chance to be the best quasi-warrior. If there was any accident that happened here, it would have been a waste.

“Teacher Nan?” Lin Xiu laughed when he saw his teacher.

“Are you alright?” Nan Zhengjun asked Lin Xiu when he saw Lin Xiu laughing.

“I’m fine.” Lin Xiu took a deep breath before answering him.

Although there weren’t many injuries on his body, Lin Xiu was still feeling a little exhausted. These Lightning Birds were quite powerful as well. If it wasn’t because he had been strengthening his body with the lightning for the past few days in order to make himself stronger, he would have been picked by these Lightning Birds till he became a bloody mess.

“You’re the one….who defeated all these birds?” Nan Zhengjun looked around and observed the situation around him. There were lots of Lightning Birds lying around and most of them were badly injured as they were struggling to move their wings.

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu nodded his head and answered the question.

When Nan Zhengjun heard the question, his mouth twitched. He was only worried about Lin Xiu’s safety before this but when he took a closer look of what was happening around, he couldn’t help but feel his head pounding.

These Lightning Birds have been bred here for years and nothing has ever happened. Plus, there were a lot of lightning poles around the mountain top. The Lightning Birds would attract the lightning and the mountain top in the center would be used to collect these energies and turn them into electricity.

In other words, the Lightning Birds played an important role in their academy. Especially when these Lightning Birds belonged to …..that person!

As he thought about it, there were already droplets of sweat forming on his forehead.

“What’s wrong?” Lin Xiu saw the change of expression on his face and subconsciously asked a question.

“Don’t worry about it. Let’s go.” Nan Zhengjun shook his head and said to Lin Xiu.

“What’s the matter?! What’s the matter?!” At the same time, there were already a few of them who were walking towards the mountain top.

These men were wearing the same white uniform from the Sacred Region Academy. They were different from the normal uniform. They looked as if they were of a higher level than Nan Zhengjun.

It was obvious that they were one of the leaders of the Sacred Region Academy.

“Nan Zhengjun ?” One of the men frowned when he saw Nan Zhengjun.

“Director Zhang.” Nan Zhengjun greeted him respectfully. Then, he directly walked forward and screamed at Lin Xiu.

“What happened here?!” When Director Zhang saw the injured Lightning Birds that were lying on the ground motionlessly, he screamed in anger.

“There are so many injured Lightning Birds here as well as students who are severely injured. Don’t you dare tell me that you are the one who caused all these!”

Nan Zhengjun wiped off the sweat on his forehead and then told Director Zhang the entire story that happened.

“Lin Xiu didn’t do this on purpose. It was the Lightning Birds who attacked him first. He would have died if….” Nan Zhengjun continued to intercede for Lin Xiu.

Since things were already at this point, it wouldn’t be as simple as isolation.

“I will investigate it and will follow up on the outcome of this matter.” Director Zhang said with a serious face after hearing Zheng Nanjun’s explanation on the matter.

“Then, can I leave with him? He is injured as well.” Zheng Nanjun let out a breath of relief and looked at the figure who was behind him.

Lin Xiu overheard the conversation and reacted quickly as he pretended to be severely injured.

Director Zhang also noticed that there were several injuries on Lin Xiu and his clothes were already shredded into pieces. He frowned as hesitated before nodding his head, “Bring him away and get him treated first.”

“But in regards to this matter, it’s not over yet.”

“Thank you, Director Zhang. I’ll get him treated first.” Zheng Nanjun smiled and nodded his head. Then, he supported Lin Xiu and left.

As for the rest of them, they took their medical kit and started treating those Lightning Birds.

“Give me all the information of that student.” Director Zhang said to one of the guards, seeing how Lin Xiu and Zheng Nanjun had left the scene.

“Yes, Sir!” One of the guards took out a tablet that was as thin as a paper and looked for Lin Xiu’s information before passing it to Director Zhang.

Director Zhang looked at the information on the screen and frowned, “Lin Xiu, first year student…”

“Warrior… rank five?!”
