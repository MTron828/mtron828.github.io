Chapter 151: Diamond Skill Card

Grand prize?

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment, then became excited.

It has been a long time since he saw the grand prize appear.

As a bright light flickered in the sky, he suddenly saw a resplendent glow.

“Congratulations Master on obtaining the Diamond skill card- [Mount Hua Strike]!

Diamond skill card!!!

Lin Xiu heard the system prompt and felt his body tremble with excitement.

He reached out and held the card floating in the air, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the smoothness and brilliance of the card.

The entire card was like a work of art and there was also a tall and strong man printed on it, holding a huge saber, and was splitting a mountain in half.

“Saber techniques!?” Lin Xiu was shocked and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

This was almost like a slap in the face.

Lin Xiu, who was still excited just now, now has a bitter face.

He didn’t need a saber, it was of no use to him…

But this thing could still be sold.

With that thought, Lin Xiu picked up his backpack and prepared to go to the Sacred Region Academy exchange station to have a look.

When Rollie saw Lin Xiu going out, its chubby body jumped up like a cannonball and stood on Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

As soon as he walked out, he saw a white figure on the training ground in the hall.

Luo Yue seemed to have just taken a shower as her hair looked a bit wet.

The fair and tender cheeks now looked a bit flushed after the bath.

“Would you like to go out to have some fun?” Lin Xiu asked with a smile.

Luo Yue shook her head, then ignored Lin Xiu and continued to practice with the long sword.

“What an idiot…” Lin Xiu curled his lips up but had to admit that she was very pleasing to the eye when she danced with the sword.

Lin Xiu walked out of the hall and walked over to the exchange center according to the area shown on the map.

Although the sun was already setting, the exchange center appeared very lively.

Many students in the Sacred Region Academy uniforms were standing there.

Although the uniforms of the Sacred Region Academy were all white, they were marked with Ⅰ, Ⅱ, Ⅲ, and Ⅳ according to the different grades.

They represented the first to fourth grade respectively.

As Lin Xiu walked over, many people glanced in his direction.

“Tsk tsk, it seems that this year’s freshmen aren’t very good.” Some guys revealed a mocking smile when they saw Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu ignored them. At this moment, he was the only one who was not wearing the uniform of the Sacred Region Academy.

Seems like he was the first to come to this place eh?

“Freshman, what do you need?” At the counter over there, an old man touched his beard, then smiled and said to Lin Xiu.

Behind the counter here, you could see a lot of things, weapons, skill cards, Odd Crystals, and even various evolved beast materials.

“I want to sell something.” Lin Xiu stood beside the counter and said to the old man who had his hands on the counter.

“Oh?” The old man seemed a little surprised.

It was the first time he saw that a freshman selling something during his first visit.

“The things sold here can only be exchanged for points, not for union coins.” The old man said.

“I know.” Lin Xiu nodded, then took out the skin of the T-Rex Leech from the backpack. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The old man’s eyes lit up when he saw the transparent skin.

Then, he touched it with and lauded, “Rare evolved beast, rank 4 T-rex Leech skin.”

“This can be exchanged for 1,000 points.” The old man smiled at this time.

“This kid is lucky…” Some people around were surprised to see this scene.

The rank of this evolved beast was not high, but it was considered rare.

“Sure.” Lin Xiu nodded and handed him his information card. Soon, 1,000 points were added to the card.

“And this.” Lin Xiu thought for a while, then took out the ‘Salt Crystal’ that looked like a white lotus.

“Salt Crystal!?” Seeing this scene, many people’s eyes widened.

There was a hint of jealousy in most.

The Salt Crystal was one of the things that could only be encountered by chance and it was such a big piece, its completeness was almost perfect.

“This…” Even the old man was shocked at this moment.

“Yes, it is indeed the Salt Crystal.” After looking at it for a while, the old man nodded.

“How many points can I redeem for this?” Lin Xiu said with a smile.

“100,000.” The old man hesitated, then said.

Hearing his words, many warriors turned to Lin Xiu.

100,000 points! Just how long would it take for them to earn that amount!

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu nodded, this thing was not particularly useful to him, and it was not helpful to improving his strength.

“Do you accept skill cards?”

“Skill cards, weapons, and combat suits are not accepted.” The old man shook his head.

The Sacred Region Academy produced many of these things so they wouldn’t accept them.

“Okay.” Lin Xiu was a bit regretful, otherwise, the Diamond skill card could sell for hundreds of thousands of points, right?

“Give me a Tier 6 Odd Crystal.” Lin Xiu pointed to the Odd crystals in the shop window and said.

“The rank 6 Odd crystal is 80,000 points for one.”

“OK.”

After redeeming the Odd Crystal with his points, Lin Xiu’s had a total of 21,025 points remaining.

It was still considered quite a bit.

After leaving the exchange center, Lin Xiu thought for a while and decided to return to absorb the energy of the rank 6 Odd Crystal.

The Sacred Region Academy was huge and there were some areas where there was nobody walking at night.

“Come out.” Halfway along the tree-lined path, Lin Xiu stopped and said aloud.

But the surrounding area seemed a bit quiet and there was no one at all.

“Those two at ten o’clock and one at two o’clock.” Lin Xiu looked at the tall bushes on both sides at the front and said faintly.

Just like what Lin Xiu had said, three white figures appeared in the middle of the road.

“Tsk tsk, it seems that this year’s freshman is not bad, huh.” The leader was a man with short hair. Lin Xiu glanced at a mark on his uniform and knew it was a second-year student.

“Let’s get to know each other, my name is Chai Jiuming.”

“Students of the Sacred Region Academy – why are you guys following a freshman so sneakily?” Lin Xiu stood at the same spot and stared at him without fear.
