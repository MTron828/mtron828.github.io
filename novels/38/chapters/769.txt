Chapter 770: Rank 10! Dark Stone Beasts!

The magma red lizard, rank 9!

This flaming lizard looks a little translucent throughout.

It turned out to be a rank 9 evolved beast.

But for the current Lin Xiu, the rank 9 evolved beast is nothing.

Lin Xiu stabbed the long spear in his hand and directly stabbed the magma red lizard that was biting at him.

The sharp point of the spear directly stabbed through it.

Just when Lin Xiu thought it would be easy to deal with, at this moment, the magma in the cracks on the surrounding ground began to boil frantically.

What’s happening?

Lin Xiu, who wanted to move on, could clearly see that one after another magma red lizards kept emerging from the ground.

This number was really too much, Lin Xiu couldn’t help being shocked when he saw this scene.

And these magma red lizards that jumped out of the magma all pounced toward Lin Xiu.

According to the information obtained by the Analytic Eye, these magma red lizards have fire poison in their bodies and if bitten, even a master warrior-level warrior may not be able to survive.

Lin Xiu didn’t care at all at this time, the Dark Edge spear in both hands kept swiping at it.

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

As soon as the skill was used, it instantly killed a large number of magma red lizards that rushed over.

This was just a small episode. Soon, all those magma red lizards were killed by Lin Xiu.

And in the magma, no other magma red lizard jumped out.

Continuing to walk towards the front, Lin Xiu found that this area was all like this.

There were many cracks on the ground like before and there were many magma-like things inside.

The surrounding area became hotter and hotter, and Lin Xiu started to sweat.

Lin Xiu already felt this way, if other warriors came over, there would be signs of burns.

At this time, Lin Xiu saw that there was no path in front of him. There was a huge but not very tall mountain blocking.

And under the mountain, there was a huge cave.

Is this... the cave of the Raging Flame Lion!?

Thinking of this, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes could not help shrinking.

At this time, he carefully looked around and found that no strange creatures appeared, then Lin Xiu continued to walk forward slowly.

When he just walked to the front entrance of the cave, Lin Xiu discovered that there were quite a few strange creatures at the entrance of the cave.

They were licking something on the ground.

As Lin Xiu just walked over, these evolved beasts ran away.

“What is this…” Lin Xiu lowered his head and looked down and he could clearly see that on the ground, there was some light blue liquid.

Those evolved beasts just now were licking these things.

At this time, Lin Xiu clearly felt that these light blue liquids seemed to have a strange energy fluctuation.

What the hell is this?

Lin Xiu squatted down and looked at it and felt that these things were very strange.

But now Lin Xiu didn’t think much about it, then continued to walk into the cave.

Except for the appearance of some evolved beasts at the entrance of the cave, the area inside is very quiet and it seems that no evolved beast dares to approach.

And inside the cave, just like the outside, it was very hot.

What’s in here?

Lin Xiu had already held his breath at this time and walked inside step by step.

The Dark Edge spear in his hand was still tightly grasped.

Lin Xiu instinctively felt that there was an unusually dangerous aura inside.

Is there anything other than the Raging Flame Lion?

Because at this time, Lin Xiu always felt that it was very dangerous inside.

Not long after he continued to walk inside, Lin Xiu saw a bright light.

“This...”

Lin Xiu squinted his eyes slightly and his face was full of incomparable surprise.

Because in front of you is a pile of odd crystals piled up like a mountain!

The number of odd crystals is really too many, more than what he saw before at Legacy Land.

And there were many human skeletons next to it, which were also piled up like a mountain.

You don’t have to think about it to know that those warriors who wanted to break in must have been swallowed up.

In addition to these things, there are many battle suits and weapons, all piled up into mountains.

“Are these what the Raging Flame Lion collected…”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but was stunned.

There were too many of these things, especially odd crystals.

There are so many odd crystals, there are all kinds of different ranks and the lowest was rank 8!

If these things appeared on the earth, it would definitely scare people to death.

“It would be nice if I could have a storage ring or something…”

Lin Xiu thought of the peculiar things in the Xianxia drama and couldn’t help but say aloud to himself.

The number of these odd crystals is too many, if he wanted to take them all away, it was impossible.

And it seems that there is not enough time to absorb all the energy of these odd crystals.

There was no other way. After thinking about it, Lin Xiu continued to walk towards the cave.

The more you go inside, the hotter it seems, as if you are in a furnace.

It feels like something has appeared...

Just as Lin Xiu continued to walk in, he found that there was a square-shaped pool in the middle that looked like it was made of rocks.

Inside the pool, there is a liquid that emits a faint blue light.

Just standing here, Lin Xiu can clearly feel that there are extremely strong energy fluctuations in these liquids!

These things...what are they! ?

Lin Xi suddenly thought that the evolved beasts were licking the liquid on the ground just now, weren’t they similar to these?

And those evolved beasts that have become stronger before, could they be affected by these.

Lin Xiu couldn’t think clearly, but he still walked over here.

Roar–

Just as Lin Xiu walked over, a loud roar came over.

What happened!?

Hearing this huge roar, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly.

From the other entrances of the cave, several figures rushed over towards Lin Xiu!

Although Lin Xiu’s body responded quickly, even so, at this moment, he was scratched at his arm and a tingling sensation came.

Roar–

Taking a closer look, there were three dark-blue beasts whose skins were like the surrounding stone walls!

Lin Xiu didn’t think much about it and at this moment, he directly used the Analytic eye:

Type: Dark stone beasts

Level: Level 10

Features: The skin of the body is extremely hard and the color can change according to the surrounding environment, the speed is extremely fast and the sharp teeth are highly poisonous.

Rank 10!? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu’s pupils narrowed slightly at this time.
