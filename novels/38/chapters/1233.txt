1234 Rollie’s Past

“How did he die?”

Baili Haoling’s eyes were opened wide in shock. She was in disbelief as she saw the scene before her.

All she remembered was that she was still in a battle with Sha Yuan. How did he suddenly die?

“You don’t know?”

Lin Xiu was shocked as well as he subconsciously asked.

Baili Haoling shook her head as she was a little shocked as well.

She had no idea what had just happened. When she came back to her senses, the scene before her had already happened.

“You were the one who killed him.”

Lin Xiu looked at Baili Haoling with a peculiar look in his eyes.

The blood red energy that Baili Haoling released a while ago was indeed questionable.

“That’s weird…”

Baili Haoling stared at her hands and she looked lost.

What really happened just now?

Boom boom – –

Suddenly, Rollie’s huge body appeared out of nowhere.

The entire ground shook as Rollie started getting closer towards them.

Its mouth was open wide and it immediately swallowed Sha Yuan’s body.

Then, it let out a loud and satisfied burp.

“This fellow!”

Lin Xiu didn’t know if he should be crying or laughing at Rollie.

It went missing during the battle and now that everything was over, it instantly appeared to eat Sha Yuan’s body.

Little Bai flew down from the sky as well.

“You’re hurt?”

Lin Xiu looked at the wings of Little Bai and there was a deep wound.

It was obvious that it got injured by Sha Yuan during the fight earlier.

Lin Xiu lifted his right arm. The water element energy ball lit up brightly with a purple glow.

Then, there were water droplets that came out of the energy ball.

All of them rushed towards the wound found on Little Bai’s wings. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

As the water droplets landed on the wound, there was a comfortable feeling that went through its body.

The deep wound that was on its wing started recovering on its own.

“That’s weird. How did I kill that guy?”

Baili Haoling was still feeling lost.

Sha Yuan was a powerful man and she had been having difficulties fighting him.

But, she completely forgot everything that happened after that.

“I don’t know either but there was blood red energy around you earlier. It was pretty strong.”

Lin Xiu quickly suggested what might have happened after hearing her question.

He was busy fighting Sha Li earlier and he didn’t see how Sha Yuan was killed.

When he came back to the ground, he noticed Baili Haoling who was standing still.

“A blood red energy?”

Baili Haoling tried to think of what might have happened.

“Let’s head back first.”

Lin Xiu stretched his back.

Lin Xiu had activated ‘Rage’ when he fought Sha Li earlier. He was finally feeling the aftermath of it now and he felt as if his body had turned weak.

Rollie seemed to have felt something wrong as well then it rolled and stood before Lin Xiu.

This allowed Lin Xiu to be able to use its body as support.

Suddenly, there was a faint glow that came from Rollie’s body.

Lin Xiu could feel a warm feeling travelling through his body because of the glow.

The fatigue that he felt earlier was starting to disappear.

Lin Xiu’s body was filled with energy once again.

“This…”

Lin Xiu felt that this was something incredible. His mouth was opened wide in shock and he couldn’t believe what was happening.

This was exactly what happened the last time as well. The aftermath of using ‘Rage’ had completely disappeared because of Rollie.

It was as if there were no aftermath!

Lin Xiu was pleasantly surprised when he learnt about this.

This skill of Rollie seemed to be quite useful!

“Haoling, do you know what evolved beast Rollie might be?”

Lin Xiu asked out of curiosity as he gently patted Rollie.

Its body was covered with soft fur and it was incredibly comfortable to stroke them.

“I don’t know either.”

“I couldn’t find any information about him.”

Baili Haoling was finally pulled back from her thoughts about the fight earlier. Then, she stared at Rollie before shrugging her shoulders.

“Is that so…”

Lin Xiu felt lost as well. For some reasons, he felt that Rollie wouldn’t be a simple evolved beast.

“Sir!”

Mr Pang came running with the rest of the guards.

“Are you alright?!”

Mr Pang was panting as he asked.

The rest of the guards looked cautious as well as they checked the surroundings, ready to fight.

However, they soon noticed that all of their enemies had disappeared!

They were all quite shocked. This was because from the footage that they saw inside the city, there was a large number of people who were trying to attack their city.

“It’s already over by the time you guys get here.”

Lin Xiu teased the rest of them.

Mr Pang felt a little awkward after hearing what Lin Xiu said.

“Alright. Let’s head back.”

Lin Xiu waved his arm.

Mr Pang hesitated for some time before nodding his head. Then, he got the guards to return to their post.

“City Lord, you have really become incredibly powerful.”

Lei Chong ran over to Lin Xiu and started flattering him.

He had watched Lin Xiu fight earlier from a distance and he was beyond shocked.

Lin Xiu was now definitely a few more times stronger than when he was back at Marquis Planet.

Was that the strength of a warrior god?

He heard it from the warriors by the city gate that all city lords would have to be warrior gods.

This meant that Lin Xiu was undoubtedly a warrior god.

“Stop it.”

Lin Xiu glared at Lei Chong before pointing at the city gates.

“Would you be able to fix that?”

This was because all of the firm structures of the city gate had been destroyed by Sha Yuan and his men.

The people of Lingxian City did not have high architectural and engineering skills. It would be difficult for them to fix these buildings.

“Of course! I will be able to make it as good as new!”

When it came to recovering these buildings, Lei Chong was confident.

“Along with the energy barrier. You have to get it done as soon as possible.”

Lin Xiu continued giving his orders.

Lin Xiu wasn’t afraid of being attacked but if there are people who aren’t as dumb as those men today who wanted to attack slowly, the entire Lingxian City would be now in ruins.

So, they would definitely have to build an energy barrier.

“It’s easier to build one but in order to build something that could withstand the attacks from the warriors we saw today, I still need a few more things…”

Lei Chong raised a problem.

“What do you need?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows.

“God level odd crystals.”

“I need at least 10 of them.”

Lei Chong spoke in a serious tone.

“So, you need ten god level odd crystals.”

Lin Xiu pursed his lips as if this was a small issue.

“I don’t think we have that many now?”

Baili Haoling rolled her eyes seeing how arrogant Lin Xiu was acting.

“We might not have it here in Lingxian City but it doesn’t mean that the other cities don’t have it.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he gave his solution.
