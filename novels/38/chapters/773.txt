Chapter 774: Born To Die!

This loud roar is really terrifying and there are a lot of cracks on the surrounding ground.

Some of the warriors who were close to it and were attacking it all felt that their heads were in severe pain.

There are also warriors who are slightly weaker, even if they unfold the ‘Sphere’, at this time, their bodies are directly shaken and their seven orifices bleed to death.

At this moment, it fluttered a pair of flame wings and his huge body flew straight up, then flew to the other side.

The surrounding warriors, at this time, simply do not have the ability to continue to fight back.

“Damn...”

And Liu Pan also looked a little out of breath at this time.

The huge roar of the Raging Flame Lion just now was really terrifying.

Even though he was a little far away from the Raging Flame Lion, but even so, the roar shook his head.

And An Qi and Qian Lin also looked pale.

He looked towards the front and in the valley over there, many warriors were killed and injured.

Especially on the ground, there are many wounded warriors wailing.

“I wonder how is Master doing…”

“Why did Brother Lin go there?”

At this time, Liu Pan also said out of curiosity.

Just now, they saw Lin Xiu and rushed over there.

It seems that he wants to go to the area behind the Raging Flame Lion.

“Oh right!”

Liu Pan seemed to have thought of something at this time, then exclaimed, “Brother Lin, don’t tell me that you want to find the cave of the Raging Flame Lion?”

At the same time, Lin Xiu seemed to be in a state of slack consciousness at this time.

The pain that the body felt as if it had been blown apart was really excruciatingly painful.

Taking a closer look at this time, Lin Xiu’s flesh and blood were indeed all festering.

Because the ‘Cultivation Technique’ absorbed too much energy, coupled with the impact of unlocking the gene lock, Lin Xiu’s entire body actually exploded in an instant.

But the heart, liver, spleen, lungs and other organs were not destroyed. Lin Xiu’s bones could already be seen at this time.

And near the heart, there is a cloud of white energy protecting him.

The Heart of Frost also merged into Lin Xiu’s heart at this time.

“Gene lock unlock failed!”

“...Unknown energy detected…”

“Gene lock unlocking begins...”

bang bang bang-

The heart was still beating, but all the blood had flowed into the blue liquid and mixed with it.

According to this situation, Lin Xiu should definitely die.

But in the next moment, a miracle happened.

Those remaining flesh and blood that have not completely detached from the body began to grow back slowly.

It was as if the entire body had been reshaped.

At this time, those blue liquids also began to slowly gather towards Lin Xiu’s body.

Time passed minute by minute and soon, the body that was festering was repaired again!

“Ding!”

“Gene lock unlocked successfully!”

What Lin Xiu didn’t know was that the gene lock was unlocked for the second time.

If it wasn’t for the protection of the white light in his body, Lin Xiu would be dead at this time.

Only after this time, the white light suddenly become much dimmed.

Moreover, at this time, the ‘Body Burning Art’ started to operate automatically and with those blue liquids, Lin Xiu’s body had been completely remodeled again.

And after this remodeling, the increase in physical strength is very terrifying.

“Damn, that kid really broke in!?”

Qian Qiurong had already rushed into the cave at this time and Lin Xiu was not found. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

At this time, he didn’t think much about it and rushed in quickly.

Every year, someone wants to hunt down the Raging Flame Lion, but it has been unsuccessful for several years.

And the power of the Raging Flame Lion seems to be getting stronger every year.

This was a very strange thing.

Is there any treasure in this cave??

Thinking like this, Qian Qiu Rong’s speed increased and after stepping inside, he found the pile of odd crystals!

Even Qian Qiu Rong was stunned when he saw this scene.

The number of these odd crystals was too many, there are countless eight and ninth ranks and even more terrifying, there are many rank 10 odd crystals!

“How come there are so many...”

Looking at these odd crystals, his body trembled slightly.

The number of these odd crystals was really to die for. Is this the treasure house of the Raging Flame Lion?

He had long heard that this Raging Flame Lion likes to collect treasures and it was indeed the case.

When he looked to the other areas, he saw that there were all kinds of things piled up into mountains.

Wait, what else is there!?

At this time, he clearly felt that there were other things in the depths of this cave.

And he still hasn’t found the man’s body!

Without looking at those odd crystals, he continued to walk inside with his long sword.

He looked to the front and he could clearly see the corpses of three huge evolved beasts inside.

“Rank 10?!”

Looking at the bodies of those evolved beasts, even when they were already dead, Qian Qiurong could still feel the powerful aura coming from their bodies.

And next to the corpse of one of the monsters, you can see the existence of a rank 10 odd crystal on the exploded head.

This scene made Qian Qiurong take a deep breath.

Who did it!?

Was it that kid he saw just now?

Qian Qiurong continued to walk towards the front and found that in the middle, there was a naturally formed pool. Inside the pool, there seemed to be terrifying energy.

When he walked over, he saw a person lying in the pool.

This person is Lin Xiu!

The clothes on his body were tattered, only the battle suit was intact and he seemed to be asleep when lying inside.

Next to Lin Xiu was a long spear.

There are many cracks on the spear, as if it is about to shatter.

But there is a lot of blue liquid in this crack.

These remaining blue liquids are infiltrating the cracks of the Dark Edge spear.

“Amethyst Divine Water!?”

Seeing those liquids, Qian Qiurong seemed to sense something and his eyes widened.

The complexion of the whole person changed greatly.

His body trembled.

“No!!!”

Seeing that the strange dark long spear actually sucked the last blue liquid into the spear body, he stretched out his hand to stop it, but it was too late.

“Damn! Damn!”

Seeing that the last blue liquid disappeared, his face suddenly became extremely hideous.

Amethyst Divine Water, a special liquid formed by gathering the spiritual energy of heaven and earth, is full of incomparably terrifying power, even a little bit can benefit people a lot!

This kid, don’t tell me he found the Amethyst Divine Water Source and devoured it all!?
