Chapter 885: He Is A Monster

Did he really reach the third floor?

Zhao Xiaoqing was startled at this time.

The tower on the third floor had already emitted a faint light, which proved that someone went to the third floor.

Lin Xiu didn’t know how shocked the people were outside. At this time, he had already stepped into the third floor.

When he first stepped on the third floor, he could clearly see many strange bronze knights around.

These people were wearing armor and holding giant swords and shields on their bodies and they looked lifelike.

As soon as Lin Xiu stepped onto the third floor, he heard a strange sound.

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

He looked around and saw that there was nothing else besides these strange bronze figures.

There are no stairs.

It seemed that there was something strange about these bronze figures.

Lin Xiu looked at the bronze man and thought subconsciously.

Just as Lin Xiu was observing these bronze figures and trying to find some pattern, he heard a faint sound from behind.

......

boom–

Lin Xiu subconsciously moved his hand to the back and a bronze man’s giant sword slashed on Lin Xiu’s arm!

The giant sword looked very sharp, but even so, there were no scars on Lin Xiu’s arm.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly, raised his foot and kicked the bronze figure who attacked him from behind, sending it flying.

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

At the same time, the surrounding bronze figurines seemed to be resurrected and they all started to move.

All of them attacked Lin Xiu!

It turns out that this floor was to deal with these darn things.

swoosh—

With the movement of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the spear on his back flew out directly.

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and the spear waved wildly as soon as his thoughts were triggered.

bang bang bang-

Following the piercing of the Dark Edge spear, the bronze figurines also reacted quickly and directly raised their shields to resist.

The spear tip stabbed on those shields and a dull sound erupted.

But there was no way to pierce those shields.

clack clack——

And at this time, these bronze figures gathered again and they all attacked Lin Xiu.

These bronze figures seem to have a large number of gears moving inside and every time they moved, they make a strange sound.

As Lin Xiu swept the Dark Edge spear in his hand, the surrounding bronze figures were swept away again.

Lin Xiu’s weapon-wielding was very powerful, but even so, there is still no way to directly smash these copper figurines.

You could tell the toughness of these bronze figurines.

Seeing these copper figurines who didn’t feel any pain, after flying out, got up and attacked him again – Lin Xiu got a little irritable.

His eyes narrowed slightly and his body’s source power was mobilized at this moment.

boom boom boom —

The spear in his hand drew an arc in the air.

At this moment, a large number of flames burst out directly.

The flame is a dark blue flame.

Hellfire.

The moment those flames flew out, they turned into streaks of flaming birds and swept towards the surrounding bronze figures!

This hellfire is the most terrifying flame on the Marqi planet.

Even on the planet Namir, this flame is one of the most terrifying flames.

At this time, as the flames rushed past, the surrounding bronze figures slowly began to melt at a speed visible to the naked eye.

clap clap-

In the next moment, they all exploded.

“This guy... is on the fourth floor?”

The people around have been paying attention to the nine-story tower, but they didn’t expect that at this time, the tower on the fourth floor also lit up!

Zhao Xiaoqing covered her mouth to prevent herself from exclaiming.

This was something she hadn’t expected at all. Lin Xiu actually broke into the fourth floor!

“Xiaoqing, what’s wrong?”

At this moment, a familiar voice rang beside Zhao Xiaoqing.

Zhao Xiaoqing was stunned for a moment, then turned to look aside, there was a middle-aged man who looked like her.

It was her father, Zhao Lin.

“A friend... broke into the fourth floor.”

Zhao Xiaoqing said subconsciously.

“Oh?”

Zhao Lin was also stunned for a moment, then looked up at the tower and saw the fourth floor of the nine-story tower, which was already emitting a faint light.

This obviously indicates that someone is on the fourth floor.

“Not from Aoshuang City?”

Zhao Lin hesitated for a while, then said to Zhao Xiaoqing.

Zhao Xiaoqing’s friend should be of the same age as Zhao Xiaoqing, but among her peers, there should be no such powerful warriors in Aoshuang City. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“I met him when I was hunting outside the city.”

Zhao Xiaoqing nodded.

“Well, if he can come out alive, bring him to meet me.”

Zhao Lin also had a curious look in his eyes at this time.

Boom—

At the same time, when Lin Xiu first stepped into the fourth floor, a terrifying flame rushed toward Lin Xiu.

The temperature of this flame is extremely high, as if it could annihilate a person directly.

If it is an ordinary warrior who is caught off guard, he would definitely be directly annihilated at this time.

But to Lin Xiu, this kind of flame is nothing at all.

Walking in this flame, directly ignoring the existence of this flame.

Under the protection of source strength, Lin Xiu’s clothes were not damaged in the slightest.

After five minutes passed, the stairs leading to the upper floor appeared again.

“Is it that simple?”

Lin Xiu said aloud to a place in the corner.

Taking a closer look, in the corner, a dark shadow moved slightly.

From the very first floor, Lin Xiu felt that the nine-story pagoda had someone else hiding in it.

This person used some kind of power to hide his body in the tower, so that people can’t find him.

But Lin Xiu could clearly feel it.

Seeing that the shadow seemed to disappear, Lin Xiu shook his head slightly, looked at the stairs that appeared on the opposite side and continued to walk up.

The fifth floor is a world of ice and snow.

For Lin Xiu, it was nothing at all.

Just keep going up like this, the sixth floor, the seventh floor, the eighth floor.

The eighth-story tower is lit up!

Those warriors outside the nine-story pagoda were completely dumbfounded at this time.

Because Lin Xiu actually broke into the eighth floor!

“The eighth floor?!”

Zhao Lin, who originally wanted to take a casual look, was extremely surprised at this time.

He remembered that the last time someone broke into the eighth floor was when he saw his grandfather there when he was a child.

But he came out with serious injuries. If it wasn’t for the Zhao family, he would have died inside.

After so many years, someone broke into the eighth floor again!

“He... he’s a monster!”

Zhao Xiaoqing’s body trembled slightly and her beautiful eyes were full of shock.
