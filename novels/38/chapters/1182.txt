1183 This Is My Pet

“He’s headed for Manhuang City as well…”

As the rest of them walked towards Ah Qing, they stared at Lin Xiu who was leaving them and one of them muttered out loud.

“With his abilities, if he’s willing to help us…”

The man who got on his knees to thank Lin Xiu, got back on his feet. As he looked at Lin Xiu who was leaving, he was hoping that Lin Xiu would be able to help them.

!!

“Ah Qing, that would be impossible. Warriors like him would not bother themselves with our problems.”

Another warrior quickly denied his suggestion.

Lin Xiu walked past the mountain. As he looked at the city ahead of him, he could see a bustling city before him.

This was Manhuang City.

Lin Xiu stood on the high ground and he could clearly feel that there was a rich amount of energy in the air.

The closer he got to the city, the more this became obvious.

It looks like there was something different about this city.

At the same time, there was a large number of warriors who started heading toward Manhuang City.

Most of the warriors wouldn’t miss the chance to join the imprint of the Divine mark.

This time, most of the city lords would be joining them as well. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

The city was filled with people.

Plus, it has been said that this time, the city lord of Manhuang City has discovered a huge ruin near the city. He would be heading to the ruins together with the rest of the city lords who have come together for the meet.

“What a crowd…..”

At the same time, Lin Xiu has finally arrived at the gates of Manhuang City.

Seeing how there were large groups of warriors walking in and out of the city, Lin Xiu was surprised to see such a loud crowd.

The Xianling City that was managed by Lin Xiu was an ant compared to an elephant.

Lin Xiu shook his head. He stopped his thoughts and went straight into the city.

The security of the city wasn’t strict. There were automated scanning machines at the entrance and after getting scanned, they would be able to get the information of the warrior entering the city.

Those with criminal records would be denied entrance.

“The meet will only be happening tomorrow. Where should I go now…?”

Lin Xiu wandered on the street and he muttered to himself.

The thing that Lin Xiu wanted to do most when he got to the warrior god realm was to find Luo Yue.

However, with the situation that he was in now, Lin Xiu had no idea where he would find Luo Yue.

“Catch it! Don’t let it get away!”

Just when Lin Xiu was walking on the street, there was a loud commotion coming from behind him. When he turned around, he saw a huge white figure flying towards him.

This….?!

When he saw the huge, white bird, Lin Xiu’s pupil narrowed his shock.

The Ice Crystal White Bird!

It was flying toward Lin Xiu!

Then, he rested on top of Lin Xiu’s body.

“Little Bai?!”

Lin Xiu exclaimed in surprise.

This Ice White Crystal Bird was definitely his pet, Little Bai!!

Although it was huge now, Lin Xiu could still recognise it immediately.

Little Bai was now much more beautiful than before.

Plus, Lin Xiu could feel that Little Bai was now a beast king.

This was incredible!

It has to be noted that when they were back on earth, Little Bai’s mother, who was also a huge Ice Crystal White Bird, was not as powerful as Little Bai was now.

“I found him! He’s here!”

Then, there were footsteps that followed.

Lin Xiu looked up and saw that there were several warriors that were running toward him.

Soon, there was a large group right in front of him.

“Young man, this evolved beast got away accidentally. Hand it back to us now.”

One of the warriors reached out to Little Bai as he spoke to Lin Xiu.

“Wait.”

Suddenly, Lin Xiu grabbed the man’s wrist.

“This….is my pet.”

Lin Xiu said calmly.

“How dare you!”

When the man saw how Lin Xiu had the balls to touch him, the man was enraged. He tried to pull his hand back but he realised that he couldn’t do so because Lin Xiu was grabbing onto it.

Then, he swung his left arm and aimed it at Lin Xiu’s head!

“Leave.”

Lin Xiu warned him with a low voice and gave him a good kick.

Boom – –

When the man got kicked, his body flew hard away before landing heavily on the ground. Then, there was a loud sound that followed.

“Get him!”

The rest of the warriors were shocked to see what had happened.

Then, all of them went after Lin Xiu.

“Hmph!”

Lin XIu smirked when he saw what they had in mind.

These warriors were too weak for him.

Boom boom boom – –

When they stood around Lin Xiu, they were all thrown into the air.

The horrible energy that was released caused all of the warriors to wail in pain as they fell onto the ground.

When the Ice Crystal White Bird saw what happened, it started chirping loudly.

It looked like it was getting excited.

“Little Bai, where’s Rollier?”

Lin Xiu started petting the Ice Crystal White Bird as he asked with a smile on his face.

Then, he noticed that there were wounds on Little Bai and a cold glare appeared on Lin Xiu’s face as he stared at the men on the ground.

“My brother, isn’t this too much?”

Then, there was a warrior dressed luxuriously that appeared .

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he looked at the man who walked out from the crowd.

This was because he noticed that this was a warrior god.

Compared to the men before, this man was different.

“Too much?”

“They wanted to kill me but I didn’t. I was already being nice.”

“Plus, this is my pet.”

Lin Xiu sneered.

These men had murderous intentions in their eyes and it was obvious that they wanted to kill him.

If it wasn’t because he was new in town, Lin Xiu would have killed them all.

“Mr Lui, this brat took away our evolved beast. I don’t think it’s necessary for us to be nice to him now.”

At the same time, there were other warriors who stepped forward.

All of them had an unfriendly look in their eyes as they stared at Lin Xiu.

These warriors saw how their comrades were struggling on the ground in pain and they were unhappy about it.

“Let’s do it then.”

Lin Xiu challenged them.

“You…”

When the rest of them saw how arrogant Lin Xiu was, they grabbed onto their weapons.

They were ready to fight!

“Wait.”

Suddenly, the man known as Mr Lui, raised his arm.

“You are saying that this is your pet?”

Mr Lui pointed at the bird that was resting on Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

“Yes.”

Lin Xiu gave a firm answer.

Although he had no idea how Little Bai got to the warrior god realm, this Ice Crystal White Bird was definitely his pet.

It has to be!
