1136 Cultivating ‘Time Control’

As soon as he fell to the ground, Lin Xiu discovered that those terrifying wind blades had disappeared.

There is a breeze blowing constantly around.

Sha Lala–

Some sand on the ground was blown up.

There was a strange sound.

“Can’t use levitation huh...”

Lin Xiu raised his eyes and looked at the sky at this time and said aloud as if talking to himself.

In the next moment, as soon as his figure moved, he continued to walk forward.

As he slowly walked forward, Lin Xiu discovered that there were a large number of half-covered bones on the surrounding ground.

Some are like human skeletons, while others are more like huge evolved beasts.

On the ground, there were still many weapons left.

At first glance, these weapons were not ordinary weapons. If they were brought back to be restored, they should be able to create extraordinary weapons.

It’s just strange, why didn’t any warrior come here?

Just when Lin Xiu felt puzzled, the entire ground seemed to shake slightly.

Boom—

From the sand in front of him, a huge claw suddenly stretched out from there, then smacked Lin Xiu’s body!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

In the next moment, his figure flashed and he dodged directly.

The huge claw slammed directly on the ground.

Soon, a beast with a dark body and a hideous appearance crawled out of the sand from below!

This giant beast has a huge head and a mouth full of sharp white teeth, which looks extremely terrifying.

“Beast saint level...”

Lin Xiu can clearly feel that this evolved beast is of the level of a beast saint!

Roar–

At this time, the evolved beast let out a huge roar.

With his mouth wide open, it spat out blue flames at Li Xiu.

These blue flames seem to carry extremely high temperatures.

The surrounding air was distorted by the appearance of this flame.

Whoosh whoosh—

But at this time, with Lin Xiu’s body skill, he quickly dodged. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

And in the next moment, Lin Xiu jumped up, waved his right hand and the Dark Edge spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

swoosh—

In the next moment, the Dark Edge spear charged directly at the head of the beast!

Roar–

The evolved beast’s reaction speed was very fast. Looking at Lin Xiu who was charging over, it opened its mouth wide and seemed to be about to tear and bite Lin Xiu directly.

boom–

But at this moment, Lin Xiu seemed to be transformed into a stream of light, directly breaking through its head.

A huge hole appeared in its head.

A large amount of blue blood sputtered out at this moment.

Boom—

The huge body of this evolved beast fell directly to the ground in the next moment.

Lin Xiu, who was in the air, waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand directly into the air.

swoosh—

An arc of cold light bloomed.

The head of that beast was split in half directly.

A blue odd crystal was taken by Lin Xiu.

At the current level, it is not difficult for Lin Xiu to kill these beast saints.

Just at this time, Lin Xiu wasn’t in the air for a long time, when he felt the impact of wind blades in the air.

It’s really weird.

After Lin Xiu landed on the ground, he continued to walk forward.

As Lin Xiu continued to go deeper, the surrounding ground shook crazily.

Some evolved beasts hidden under the sand kept coming out and attacked Lin Xiu.

Looking at a large number of Beast Saint-level evolved beasts, Lin Xiu’s eyes were full of surprise.

Why are there so many powerful evolved beasts hiding under this sandy soil, Lin Xiu was a little unclear.

But this is undoubtedly good news for Lin Xiu.

Because he needed Beast Saint-level odd crystals.

Without the slightest hesitation, Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and continuously fought against those evolved beasts of the beast saint level.

Fought all the way.

Time passed quickly.

Here, it’s amazing that the whole sky doesn’t get dark at all.

It seems that there was no night.

Lin Xiu can’t remember how far he has traveled and how many evolved beasts he has killed.

On this day, Lin Xiu sat cross-legged on the ground.

Around him, it was still a piece of land covered in sand and there were a large number of evolved beast corpses on the ground.

Those were all killed by Lin Xiu just now.

At this time, Lin Xiu had a holy-level skill card on his forehead.

This is ‘Time Control’.

This skill card was different from ordinary skill cards.

There was a lot of information in it.

After Lin Xiu used this skill card, he found that a lot of information poured into his mind.

The information on this skill was so huge that Lin Xiu felt as if his head had been squeezed out.

It’s really uncomfortable...

At this time, Lin Xiu was still clenching his teeth, constantly absorbing the information on this skill.

After some time, Lin Xiu was still in the same position.

Because there is only day and no night in the space here, it is impossible to tell how many days have passed.

But the corpses of the evolved beasts around had already begun to be eaten away by some sandworms and were slowly turning into huge bone armor.

Those weird sandworms wanted to crawl over Lin Xiu’s body.

But when they just climbed over, they were burned by blue flames.

Directly into black charcoal.

hu—

The next moment, Lin Xiu took a deep breath and the skill card on his forehead instantly fell to the ground.

The bright light on this skill card has long disappeared.

This is because the skill power of this skill card has been completely absorbed by Lin Xiu.

“This skill is really difficult to learn...”

Lin Xiu stood up at this time and said aloud to himself.

Although the skill card has already packed all the skill information into his mind.

But to really control this skill was indeed more difficult than all the skills that he had learned before.

Lin Xiu looked at the surrounding ground.

In this piece of sandy soil, there is a small plant emerging.

Lin Xiu stood beside this plant and put his hand on top of it.

With the triggering of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, at this moment, the plant that had just emerged was growing rapidly at a speed visible to the naked eye!

Soon, from a small plant, it began to grow to the height of Lin Xiu’s knee.

“try again...”

Lin Xiu felt a little pain in his head when he saw this scene.

This ‘time control’ consumes too much of one’s own strength and mental power.
