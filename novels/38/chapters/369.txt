Chapter 370: What’s Inside

It was the first time that Lin Xiu saw Luo Yue filled with such a strong murderous aura.

There was no doubt that Luo Yue was very serious now.

“Oh? You seem quite capable.” The old man looked at Luo Yue who disappeared in front of him at this time, a little surprised.

The corners of his mouth curled up.

At this moment, Luo Yue’s body appeared in front of him again.

Swish swish swish——

Her body kept flashing in front of the old man like phantoms.

Lin Xiu was very surprised.

This is Luo Yue’s body skill!?

At this time, Lin Xiu looked over and couldn’t tell where Luo Yue would appear at.

What a fast speed!

At the next moment, the fist of the old man who had been standing still slammed to the side!

Boom–

At this moment, as a cold light flashed, the old man’s fist collided with a dagger

It turned out that at that moment, Luo Yue held a dagger next to the old man and stabbed him directly!

And the old man’s fist seemed very tough. Not only was it perfectly fine after it collided with the dagger, but the strong impact made Luo Yue’s hand numb.

At the next moment, this powerful force passed over, causing Luo Yue’s entire body to fly out behind.

Bang–

Lin Xiu who was in the back saw this scene, rushed over, and caught Luo Yue.

“Are you alright?”

Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue who was in his arms at this time.

Initially, Luo Yue wanted to continue to attack the old man, but at this moment, her eyes met Lin Xiu and the murderous intent in her eyes seemed to fade.

Luo Yue shook her head, then looked at the old man, her eyes full of caution.

“Little girl, where did you learn these killing techniques?” The old man looked at Luo Yue and said with a smile.

This old man always looked very relaxed and his strength was a bit unfathomable.

Luo Yue gave a cold snort and didn’t say anything, but at this time she covered her shoulder.

“Is your injury coming back?” Lin Xiu frowned when he saw Luo Yue’s movement, and then said aloud.

Luo Yue shook her head. Just when she was about to say she was okay, Lin Xiu stood in front of her, then turned around and smiled at her, “Let me go next.”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue was stunned. At this moment, Lin Xiu had already walked slowly towards the old man.

This old man was very strong and had a fast reaction speed, it would be impossible to use ordinary methods to attack him, even if he and Luo Yue go up at the same time.

“Did you hear that?” The old man looked at Lin Xiu with a smile, and then said aloud.

Lin Xiu’s hearing was very good and he could hear the footsteps coming from above.

Those people were already coming down.

“Two minutes, the last two minutes.” The old man stretched out his two fingers at this time, and then said with a smile.

As soon as he said that, Lin Xiu’s had already rushed to him!

At this time, Lin Xiu burst forth very swiftly but for the old man, it was far from enough.

Swish swish swish——

As Lin Xiu’s fists attacked his body wildly, the old man kept dodging.

He couldn’t even touch the corners of the old man’s clothes!

And Lin Xiu also noticed that the old man was almost standing still and didn’t make any movements, only relying on the powerful reaction speed of his body to dodge the attacks.

“Ten seconds left, it seems that you guys can’t win.” The old man smiled and said as he leaned to one side avoiding another fist attack from Lin Xiu.

However, Lin Xiu still didn’t stop his movements and continued to attack the old man.

Lin Xiu’s fist had bursts of lightning for this punch and made a “crackling” sound.

“I said it already, you can’t hit me.” Seeing that Lin Xiu seemed to be angry because he couldn’t hit him and he even used his skill, the old man said in a calm manner.

“I’m sorry, the game is over.” Just when the lightning punch was about to hit the old man’s body, the old man stretched out his right hand and wanted to grab Lin Xiu’s fist directly.

But at this moment, the pupils in his eyes changed suddenly.

Wait!

Swish——

He leaped to the other side.

Boom–

Lin Xiu, who suddenly appeared behind him, seemed to hit the air at this moment, making a dull sound.

“So close. Kid, how did you do it?” The old man jumped to the other side in an instant, and his eyes were full of surprise as he looked at Lin Xiu.

And the ‘Lin Xiu’ just now stood in place, and two ‘Lin Xius’ suddenly appeared over there.

“Your reaction speed is really fast.” Lin Xiu commented.

Just now, Lin Xiu used ‘Mirror Image’ to attack the old man by surprise, but his reaction was indeed too fast.

“But I did hit you, right?” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu looked at the old man and said with a smirk.

Taking a closer look, there was a faint red mark on the old man’s arm.

This was caused by a light hit from Lin Xiu’s fist while he was dodging.

The old man was taken aback, then looked at the red mark on his arm, and couldn’t help but laugh.

“Not bad, not bad!”

“This is the first time I’ve seen this skill.” The old man looked at Lin Xiu with approval and said.

At this time, he looked to the side and opened the box containing the alien ore, then took out the alien ore that was glistening in faint blue light. It looked very eye-catching.

At this moment, the old man took the alien ore and then used force in his hands.

Click, click, click——

With a clear sound, this alien ore was actually crushed in half by this old man!

“You…” Lin Xiu was puzzled when he saw this scene. Why did he destroy the alien ore?

“The good stuff is inside.” The old man seemed to know what Lin Xiu wanted to ask. At this moment, he looked at Lin Xiu and said with a strange smile.

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu looked toward the middle of the alien ore that he had broken in half.
