Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu’s expression changed when he saw what was happening.

But soon, he gathered his thoughts and the energy source stones that were in his watch appeared by his side.

“Did you think that you’re the only one who knows how to use it?”

Lin Xiu looked at the energy source stone that was shining brightly next to Sun Jian before asking him a question.

As he waved his hand, the Source Stone of Darkness, Source Stone of Electricity and Source Stone of Fire immediately appeared next to Lin Xiu.

!!

“Go!”

Lin Xiu gently placed his hand on the stones and placed the energy in his body into the Source Stone of Darkness.

Suddenly, the Source Stone of darkness started glowing brightly with a peculiar black glow.

Soon, the large amount of energy that were black in colour covered the entire area.

It had completely enveloped Lin Xiu’s body.

Boom – –

The rock snakes and the water cones formed by the waves were all headed towards the black glowing energy.

But, they were all instantly blocked by it and it couldn’t get to Lin Xiu!

Then, Lin Xiu did the same thing and placed his energy into the Source Stone of Electricity.

The stone started shining brightly and it was followed by thunder and lightning appearing in the sky.

The lightning that was thick and horrifying started coming at them.

All of them were directed at Sun Jian!

“Damn it!”

Sun Jian was looking at what was happening and he had an awful expression on his face.

He started moving in order to dodge the attacks from the lightning.

Boom – –

As for the ground beneath their feet, there were already huge craters formed because of the horrifying lightning.

It was obvious to them how strong these lightning bolts were.

Lin Xiu, whose body was still in the air, started pushing energy into the Source Stone of Fire.

With that, the Source Stone of Fire started shining brightly with a red flow and there were flames appearing out of nowhere.

These flames were filled with source energy!

Slowly, all of the red flames gathered together and formed a flaming dragon.

Lin Xiu gently moved his hands and with that, the huge flaming dragon started attacking Sun Jian!

The flaming dragon was huge and it completely covered the sky above their head. It was a glorious scene to experience.

“Such…..such a horrifying skill…”

Looking at what was happening, Duan Zheyan widened his eyes in shock.

Lin Xiu’s strength surprised him even more.

“Move!!!”

Seeing how the large flaming dragon was heading towards him, Sun Jian roared in rage.

He continued pushing energy into the Source Stone of Rock and Source Stone of Water.

The rocks from around them slowly formed a huge rock snake and the sea water soon gathered together and formed a huge water snake!

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered. He gathered his thoughts and transferred a minimal amount of energy into the Stone Source of Fire.

Then, the Stone Source of Fire was shining even brightly.

The flaming dragon that was already huge became much bigger than it previously was.

It immediately went head to head with the rock snake and water snake!

The rock snake and water snake were immediately crushed into ashes by the flaming dragon.

“That’s impossible!”

Sun Jian screamed in horror as he looked at his snakes.

That’s when he noticed that the flaming dragon was now headed towards him!

“AHHHHHH!!!”

He was screaming in rage and immediately released his ‘sphere’ in order to protect himself!

Boom – –

As the huge flaming dragon rushed towards him, the entire ground started shaking as well.

The ‘sphere’ that he had released could be seen to be disappearing slowly with their naked eyes.

“Goodbye!”

Lin Xiu gathered his energy into his long spear and with that, the entire spear had turned transparent.

Only the markings on the spear were now glowing with a bright red glow.

He held his spear with both his hands and grew a line in the sky!

Boom – –

There was a bright white light gathered at the tip of it and as a small crescent shape was drawn in the air with the spear, it formed a huge white crescent sword aura that was headed towards Sun Jian!

The air around it as the crescent passed were all destroyed.

‘Heaven Breaking Strike’!

“What on earth is this?!”

Duan Zheyan and Wang Qiang, who were standing far away, looked shocked as they stared at the scene before them.

This…..this was horrifying.

With this warrior skill, Lin Xiu was about to break the space around them!

“Move!!!!!”

Sun Jian’s face looked hideous as the veins all around his face were popping out.

All of the energy in his body has now turned into a black atomic material.

The black atomic material slowly formed a huge black shield.

He was trying to stop Lin Xiu’s attack with it!

But then, the black shield was then sliced into two pieces.

Sun Jian was in disbelief when he saw what happened but before he could react, the white crescent have already went through his body.

Boom – –

His body was then cut into two!

He’s still alive?!

Lin Xiu looked at Sun Jian’s body that was already cut into half but he still didn’t receive the notifications from his system.

This meant that Lin Xiu was not dead.

Sun Jian’s eyes were still staring at Lin Xiu in rage.

Then, Sun Jian’s body slowly disappeared in the air as if it were sand being blown by the wind.

There were still black atomic materials that were slowly being formed as his body disappeared.

The black atomic material tried to fly towards the cut in the space that had been sliced open.

It was trying to run away from that cut!!

Lin Xiu immediately activated his sourcemark that was on his forehead.

Xiu – –

An array instantly appeared in the air and it immediately trapped the black atomic material!

Lin Xiu then slowly flew towards the array.

When Lin Xiu got close to the array, the black atomic material suddenly showed Sun Jian’s face.

He was looking mad as he glared at Lin Xiu.

“You brat! Let me go!”

The black material formed the head of Sun Jian.

He was screaming at Lin Xiu relentlessly.

But Lin Xiu was not bothered by it.

He gathered his thoughts and the array started expanding. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Let me out!!!! Let me go now!”

Sun Jian suddenly had a bad feeling about it and his eyes were filled with fear.

Then, the entire array exploded!

Boom – –

With the huge explosion, all of the black atomic material disappeared into thin air.

That’s when a notification from the system appeared in his head.

“It’s over now.”

Lin Xiu looked at where Sun Jian was earlier and there were two energy source stones floating in the air.
