Chapter 787: Clone

Seeing Lin Xiu stand up again, the expression in the old man’s eyes couldn’t help but change.

What’s the matter with this kid?

He’s still able to stand up now?

Hu...

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and in the next moment, those lightning bolts on his body began to slowly disappear.

The power of King Warrior is really strong.

At this moment, Lin Xiu clenched the Dark Edge spear in his hand and the spear seemed to sense Lin Xiu’s fighting intent and it trembled.

The source strength of the whole body was mobilized at this moment.

swoosh—

As Lin Xiu’s figure moved, Lin Xiu’s body rushed towards the old man!

And at this time, the body seemed to be subconsciously swallowing the energy of the odd crystals of the Raging Flame Lion.

The meridians of the body seem to have become incomparably hot due to absorbing the energy of this odd crystal.

“Humph!”

The old man saw that Lin Xiu actually rushed over with a sneer on his face.

His body, at this time, was full of electric lights flickering.

These lightnings are far more terrifying than the lightning that Lin Xiu possessed in his previous skills.

At this time, as these lightnings appeared around his body, the surrounding ground was scorched black by the lightning.

Whoosh whoosh—

Lin Xiu’s spear continued to stab over, but the old man not only did not dodge, but also waved his fist and charged directly at Lin Xiu’s spear!

Taking a closer look, you can see that the old man already had gloves on his fists.

Because of this glove and the source strength of the old man over it, even if his fist directly hit the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand, he would still be fine.

On the contrary, it was Lin Xiu who charged with a spear, but at this time he felt his body being shaken back.

What a powerful force!

But even so, Lin Xiu kept attacking!

“Courting death!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu dared to continue to attack, the old man was provoked and even more terrifying lightning burst out from his body, frantically attacking Lin Xiu.

Moreover, the electric light of his fist hit Lin Xiu’s body in the next moment.

This terrifying lightning made Lin Xiu’s body feel a sharp pain. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Energy detected...”

“The Engulf System is on...”

But at the same time that these terrifying lightning hit Lin Xiu’s body, the system’s ‘Engulf’ skill was also activated.

Many times, the ‘Engulf’ skill is automatically activated and Lin Xiu didn’t notice it before.

Now if you take a closer look, you can clearly find that this ‘Engulf’ skill has become LV.8, which means that it is now level 8.

It can absorb 10% of the energy and convert it into experience!

In other words, 10% of the energy of the lightning shocks that he received was directly absorbed!

So even though the lightning was terrifying, it was still within the range that Lin Xiu could bear.

“Who is this old man...”

Watching the battle, Liu Pan couldn’t help but sweat for Lin Xiu.

The lightning released by this old man was really terrifying, especially on the ground where he was located, because of this terrifying lightning, it was completely blackened by the electricity.

“Yan Yongxin is the King Warrior who has the nickname of the Lightning King.”

At this moment, An Qi said with a disgusting expression on her face.

The appearance of such a powerful king-level warrior can be said to be very dangerous for Lin Xiu’s situation.

She looked to the other side, but her reinforcements hadn’t come yet.

Sun Zi and the others naturally dare not do anything to them, but Lin Xiu...

boom boom boom —

As the battle became more and more intense, the silhouettes of the two seemed to have become shadows and it was impossible to see clearly.

There was a lot of terrifying lightning bursting out in the air and the surrounding air seemed to have a burnt smell.

What a terrifying power!

At this time, Sun Zi also showed a wicked smile, as if Lin Xiu would definitely die.

But only Yan Yongxin, who was fighting against Lin Xiu, knew that although his offensive was very fierce, he still couldn’t seem to be able to kill Lin Xiu directly.

What exactly is going on!?

Yan Yongxin’s face has become a little nasty. His attacks felt as if they were blocked by an invisible force and the power of his attack was only average.

So he seems to have attacked many times, but they were not really effective attacks.

What he didn’t know was that this was the effect of the title of Lin Xiu’s master warrior, with a 30% chance of resisting 50% of the damage!

This can be regarded as a very buggy skill.

‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!

At this moment, when Lin Xiu once again resisted the man’s attack and directly attacked!

Boom—

At the moment when the Dark Edge spear pierced out, a large amount of black matter suddenly gathered into a giant dragon, which directly bit his body!

“Insignificant skill!”

Yan Yongxin roared angrily and suddenly a pair of huge lightning hands appeared, tearing the dragon to pieces!

Looking at this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes could not help shrinking.

The power of this guy is really too terrifying...

His ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’ broke just like that?

“Humph!”

At this moment, Yan Yongxin snorted coldly, with a grin on his face, as if his body teleported to the back of Lin Xiu and the huge hand of lightning directly pinched Lin Xiu’s head.

Boom—

The next moment, Lin Xiu’s head was crushed!

“Brother Lin”

“Master!”

Looking at this scene, Liu Pan and the others all shouted loudly at this moment.

They couldn’t believe that Lin Xiu was killed just like that!

“Okay, take all the odd crystals on him!”

At this time, Sun Zi turned his eyes to the front and said with a big laugh.

But Yan Yongxin’s eyes turned to the other side, as if he was searching for something.

And Lin Xiu’s body actually disappeared?

As if it turned into smoke, it disappeared in an instant!

“This...” Liu Pan was very excited and wanted to chop Lin Xiu with the axe in both hands, but at this moment, he found that Lin Xiu’s body, like the smoke of an explosion, was gone!

“Master is not dead!”

At this time, Qian Lin looked to the other side and she could clearly see where Lin Xiu was over there.

Lin Xiu stood on the spot and seemed unaffected.

“Wait, why is there another Brother Lin here?!”

At this moment, Liu Pan saw Lin Xiu appear on the other side.

What exactly is going on!

“No... Also, there is another master!”

An Qi’s eyes widened.
