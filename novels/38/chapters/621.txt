Chapter 622: Adapt to the Circumstances

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“What do you mean?” Lin Xiu said helplessly, spreading out his hands, and then yawned. The bed in this Warrior Union hotel was really comfortable.

“I’m not going in circles with you anymore. Last night, the direct descendants of several small families in Sky City were killed.”

At this moment, Ouyang Hang lowered his voice and said cautiously.

“What does this have to do with me?”

Lin Xiu said with a smile.

“It’s best if it doesn’t concern you. I just deduced it based on the time it happened, and it’s similar to yours.”

Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu meaningfully and said.

“Even if it was me, so what?”

Lin Xiu looked at him and said aloud.

“Really? It’s you?”

The pupils in Ouyang Hang’s eyes shrank slightly.

“Hey, that’s enough, I just came to Sky city, why would I kill those young masters?”

Lin Xiu deliberately pretended to be helpless.

“Sky City is different from other places. Even a small family has peak rank 8 warriors and there are many rank 8 warriors among them so it would be quite troublesome if you provoke those people.”

Ouyang Hang said to Lin Xiu.

“Nevermind, it’s good that it wasn’t you, I don’t want to have one person missing from our academy for the competition.”

“Those young masters shouldn’t be so weak, right? I don’t have such great ability.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lin Xiu smiled bitterly.

“That might not be true.”

Ouyang Hang pouted and said, after all, Lin Xiu’s recent combat strength has far exceeded Ouyang Hang’s imagination, and he didn’t know what training Lin Xiu has undergone.

It was too perverted that his strength was improving so fast.

“But there are witnesses, and some surveillance cameras captured his back. I think this person must be doomed.”

“He can’t get out of Sky City at all, and he will be found soon.”

“How much is the reward? If I go and catch him, will I be able to make a fortune?” Lin Xiu seemed very interested.

“Forget it, that kind of person might be a killer from the underground world.”

Ouyang Hang seemed to scoff at Lin Xiu.

“By the way, your master said that we will start training in the training room this morning. Come over later.”

After Ouyang Hang finished speaking, he left without looking back.

Watching Ouyang Hang leave, Lin Xiu closed the door.

The corners of his mouth turned up at this moment, revealing a strange smile.

“It seems that there is still no way to completely destroy the surveillance...”

Thinking of what Ouyang Hang had just said about his back being captured, Lin Xiu suddenly said to himself a little helplessly.

“But, no one would know it was me.”

Clack clack——

As Lin Xiu was talking to himself, the bones of Lin Xiu’s body seemed to be slowly squeezing together, and his body instantly became shorter.

Shrinking skill!

On the top floor of the Tower of Trials, Lin Xiu had read many manuscripts on skills, all of which he had memorized. Now Lin Xiu could be said to be a mobile encyclopedia.

Although there was no record of those powerful diamond skills, those basic skills benefit Lin Xiu even more.

It also provided a solid foundation for being able to create his own skills in the future.

Clack clack——

With Lin Xiu’s thoughts, his bones returned to normal.

On that day, his attire had changed, and with the changes in his body, and wearing a mask, it was impossible for anyone to find him.

“You guys should stay in the room, I’ll go out first.” Lin Xiu said aloud as he looked at the noisy Rollie and Xiao Bai.

After washing up and having breakfast, Lin Xiu came to the training room on this floor again.

The three students of the Interstella Academy seemed to be afraid to come here because of what happened last night.

In the early morning, there were not many people in the training room.

“Come here quickly!”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s appearance, Baili Haoling waved to Lin Xiu from a distance.

Huang Zhen, Qian Yao, and Ouyang Hang had arrived a long time ago, and they were seated in a circle on the extremely clean ground.

“What, what are you training for today?”

Lin Xiu also smiled at this time, and then sat directly on the ground.

“Well, today’s training is teamwork.” Baili Haoling said aloud at this time.

“The battle that starts tomorrow will not be as easy as the audition. In particular, there are several teams from academies in other galaxies, which are not so easy to deal with.”

“Other galaxies?”

Hearing Baili Haoling’s words, Lin Xiu’s brows suddenly twitched.

“Well, there’s the Interstellar Academy, Yunxin Academy, and Galaxy Academy.”

“These three colleges are colleges from other galaxies, and their strength should not be underestimated.”

“Especially the Interstellar Academy. Your Sacred Region Academy lost to them last time.”

Having said this, Huang Zhen and Qian Yao’s faces became slightly ugly.

“They don’t seem to be strong eh?”

Lin Xiu thought of the few people from last night, then spread his hands and said.

“No, that’s not team 1 of the Interstellar Academy.”

Huang Zhen shook his head and said.

“Hm?”

Lin Xiu was also a little puzzled, team 1?

“The ones we met last night were only team 2 of the Star Academy. Team 1 seemed to be carrying out some mission in another galaxy and was delayed.”

Qian Yao explained aloud.

“There are two teams from this academy?”

Lin Xiu said in surprise.

“Well, because this academy is a seed academy, they have a privilege.”

Qian Yao helplessly spread his hands and said.

“It’s getting interesting now.”

After Lin Xiu heard their words, not only did he not feel scared, but he became a little excited.

The stronger the opponent, the more it aroused Lin Xiu.

“Okay, we’ll discuss these later. Now let’s talk about team cooperation.”

“Except for Lin Xiu, who uses spears, you all use swords, right?”

Baili Haoling interrupted at this time, and then said to the crowd.

“No, actually I can also use a hammer.”

Huang Zhen shook his head and said.

“I can also use a shield. We both practice two weapons at the same time.”

Qian Yao also smiled and said.

Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu and Ouyang Hang.

“I can only use swords.” Ouyang Hang said a little embarrassedly.

“I can do anything.” Lin Xiu said confidently.

“Don’t brag.”

Ouyang Hang immediately complained when he heard Lin Xiu’s swear words.

“As a team, we don’t need too much output and we’ll need defense. Qian Zhen and Qian Yao, you can replace your swords with shields and hammers to cover the attacks. I am responsible for attacking the opponent’s main force, and Ouyang Hang attack the others.”

Everyone nodded when they heard Baili Haoling’s words.

“As for you....” Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu, then thought about it and said, “Adapt to the circumstances.”
