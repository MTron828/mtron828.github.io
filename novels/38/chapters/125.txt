Chapter 126: Mutants

After all the vines had been cut off by Lin Xiu, they curled up like injured hands. It was really an unusual sight.

Bang bang bang——

At this moment, those sounds became louder and louder. Lin Xiu turned around and saw the mutants frantically hitting the glass container.

“Exit, where’s the exit!?” Zhang Yin and the others were looking around like headless flies at this moment.

Lin Xiu frowned, he did not see the exit either.

They would be in deep trouble if they continued like that. Having to deal with such mutants in such a small space, even Lin Xiu wasn’t very confident.

These mutants were different from the average warrior, they didn’t feel any pain and their bodies were also integrated with certain characteristics of evolved beasts. Hence, they had exceptionally tough skin and ordinary laser guns couldn’t deal with them, they would attack their targets relentlessly.

“We’re doomed… we’re doomed…” said the big man, Jiang Li, as he trembled.

Those mutants were just a nightmare and he was the one who activated them ah!

He stumbled back and accidentally hit the console behind him.

Rumbling——

He seemed to hit a button and a blue iron wall in front suddenly rose up.

One could see the darkness in the distance.

“This is…” Jiang Li’s eyes widened and he looked at the scene in disbelief…

“Haha, the exit!” Zhang Yin was over the moon at this moment, he did not expect that Jiang Li would accidentally hit a certain switch!

He pulled Lei Lei aside and ran to the front.

Just as they were running toward the darkness, there were cracks on several of the glass containers at this moment. In the next second, they actually broke completely!

“Roar!!!”

Those mutants had many characteristics of evolved beasts and were roaring loudly like a beast.

A large amount of the light blue liquid flowed to the ground as the glass container broke.

Lin Xiu looked at the light blue liquid and frowned. This liquid… seemed to contain the ‘AMZ’ Virus too.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and directly ran toward the darkness as well. As he ran over, he saw these mutants chasing!

Their bodies looked very strong and their speed was extremely fast as they pounced directly on Lin Xiu who was at the back!

“‘Awe of the Phoenix’!!!” Lin Xiu yelled, then waved his spear in the air, and several phoenixes charged over in an instant!

The whole place seemed to be covered in flames!

Bang bang bang——

The phoenixes collided with those mutants, instantly melting off their epidermis to reveal the muscle tissue. However, instead of bleeding, their bodies looked terrifying.

Lin Xiu was shocked to see this and activated the Analytic Eye:

Rank 3 mutant characteristics: Possess the same physical fitness and strength as a rank 3 warrior, no sense of pain, will chase its target to death.

Comparable to the strength of a rank 3 warrior!?

Lin Xiu widened his eyes at this moment and thrust his long spear toward the mutant in front that had already charged to him!

The tip of the spear turned into little cold lights and stabbed about 10 to 20 times, instantly stabbing that mutant into a bloody mess!

But this mutant could still move its body, and it waved its fist toward Lin Xiu’s body!

Bang——

As the mutant threw a punch, Lin Xiu retreated a few steps and felt a sharp pain in his chest.

The strength of these mutants could indeed be comparable to his own, and it could still move after having suffered over a dozen stabs – what kind of a monster was that?

Fortunately, these guys didn’t know how to use skills!

“Senior!” Zhang Yin yelled when he saw Lin Xiu at the back.

“Go first!” Lin Xiu snorted coldly, then put the wooden box behind him weighing tens of hundreds of jin to the ground. In the next moment, he suddenly chopped the mutant that was rushing over from the top to bottom!

His power source strength covered the top of the Dark Edge spear, coupled with the sharpness of the Dark Edge, it directly cut the mutant’s body into two! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 3 mutant. You’ve gained 589,127 experience points…”

‘Half a million experience points!?’

Lin Xiu heard the system’s prompts and was surprised. A look of excitement then appeared on his face.

He didn’t simply flee just now because he wanted to see how much experience he could get from these mutants and didn’t expect it to be so high!

Dealing with these mutants was dangerous, but it was a real opportunity to increase his experience.

As the saying went, danger and opportunity coexist!

Lin Xiu gripped his long spear tightly, then began frantically attacking those mutants that were rushing over!

The skin of these mutants was very tough, if not for his Dark Edge spear, it would probably be very hard to kill them.

Lin Xiu continued attacking, chopping off the heads of two mutants, but these darn things would still attack even after their heads were gone!

Lin Xiu snorted coldly. This time, he directly cut the bodies of these mutants in half from top to bottom.

At this moment, after Lin Xiu killed these mutants, the remaining mutants rushed out of those glass containers toward Lin Xiu.

And Lin Xiu was like a killing machine charging through the battlefield, he didn’t use his skill again and merely relied on the fundamental spear art of chopping as he attacked all the mutants around.

A large number of limbs and arms were cut off by Lin Xiu, but there was no blood coming out, and these mutants still wanted to attack him even without a head.

‘Damn it! There are too many!’

Lin Xiu gradually began to feel tired and was sent flying by a punch from a mutant!

His chest was hurting at this moment and he tasted something sweet in his throat, then spat out a mouthful of blood.

Lin Xiu wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth, he was still standing straight as he watched a dozen mutants still charging over without any fear.

He took a deep breath, clenched his teeth, and rushed over again!

“Senior Lin!” At this moment, Zhang Yin seemed to have returned to his senses and wanted to help when he saw Lin Xiu attacking again with his spear.

A cold tip appeared first, then the spear flew out like a dragon!
