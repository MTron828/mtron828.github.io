Chapter 113: Horrifying Leech

‘Damn!’

Lin Xiu was extremely disgusted when he saw this scene and his force burst forth, dodging swiftly.

That T-Rex Leech’s body slammed against the branch of a gigantic tree behind.

Those sharp thorns on its body pierced into the thick branch of the tree and let out hissing sounds.

White smoke emitted from that thick branch as it corroded rapidly.

Thump––

A huge towering tree simply fell on the ground just like that.

Whoosh––

At the same time, Lin Xiu had calmed down. He pressed the button on the box and Dark Edge rushed out. Lin Xiu immediately grabbed the spear, then waved it, and flames were released instantaneously!

More than a dozen flaming birds charged toward that T-Rex Leech!

Then, they covered its body, forming a flaming tornado, and spun at fast speeds!

Ss ss ss!!!

That T-rex Leech let out a strange sound like it was in pain.

Done…?

Logically speaking, leeches were terrified of a lack of water, and the flames that Lin Xiu released should be able to burn it!

However, this T-rex Leech seemed to be drilling into the soil in the next moment and those flames were extinguished.

“It’s gone?” Tian Zhi walked over at this moment and was on his guard as he looked around.

The looks of that T-Rex Leech was too disgusting and still made him tremble.

“It’s still here.” Lin Xiu tensed up and he gripped Dark Edge tightly.

As Dark Edge was simply too heavy, Lin Xiu was getting tired at this moment.

“Hehe, there’s another rookie here again.” Just then, a voice resounded from the other side.

They saw a bald warrior with scars on his face, his clothes were made of beast’s skin and he was walking over.

He had two long machetes in his hand, there was even fresh blood trickling down from them which proved that he had just killed someone or an evolved beast.

“He’s a ‘Predator.'” Tian Zhi looked at the man cautiously.

There were many such people who specialized in ambushing evolved beasts and warriors in the Azure Forest.

They had no morals and only knew how to kill and plunder.

So they were known as ‘Predators’.

“What do you want?” Tian Zhi glared at the man and asked.

Judging by this man’s imposing manner, he should be a rank 3 warrior and above, and they couldn’t afford to offend him.

“What do I want?” The bald man chuckled then licked the long machete in his hand, sucking the blood into his mouth.

He revealed a perverted expression. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“I want your heads!!!” In the next second, the bald man’s face turned crazy as he charged toward Lin Xiu!

Bang––

But the second he charged over, he seemed to have stepped on something on the ground and a dull noise resounded. That T-rex leech drilled out of the soil and wrapped around his feet!

What is this thing!?

The bald man was shocked and felt a sharp pain in his leg, he couldn’t move either.

Also, what’s worse was that his pants were emitting smoke and corroding at this moment like it had touched acid!

“F*ck your mother!” The man howled as he began brandishing his machete toward that horrifying T-rex Leech at his feet.

As he chopped down, that T-rex Leech’s body was halved!

That’s all!?

Lin Xiu was taken aback when he witnessed this – it shouldn’t be that simple…

When that bald man halved that T-rex Leech, a large amount of thick light blue liquid began flowing out to his feet.

Ss ss ss——

A louder cry was heard and his entire leg was completely corroded!

“Ah!!!” The immense pain made the bald man wail loudly.

Lin Xiu ignored him and was focused on that T-rex Leech that was split into two. At this moment, there seemed to be many things surging out of its body, like several transparent worms…?

Activating the Analytic Eye, he found:

Rank 3- T-rex Leech (Larva)

Characteristics: T-Rex Leech Larva, moves at fast speed, possess a suction pad on its head, and could attach itself to people to suck their blood.

High in nutrition and crunchy when eaten raw.

“Damn!” After seeing the information, Lin Xiu trembled in disgust.

Crunchy? This system is too gross eh.

Those T-Rex Leech larvae crawled onto the bald man’s body and stuck their suction pads to him as they began to suck frantically.

“Get lost! Get lost!” The bald man was howling crazily at this moment and both his machetes were on the ground. He tried to squeeze those T-Rex Leech larvae into clumps but there were simply too many of them and there was no way to kill all of them.

In just a few seconds, his body fell to the ground with his eyes wide open and he stopped moving.

“Serve him right.” Tian Zhi had lingering fears when he saw this scene but still cursed softly.

Also, that T-Rex Leech that had been halved was starting to move again!

It’s not dead yet!?

Lin Xiu was astonished – this monster is too terrifying eh?

“Lin Xiu, let’s go now!” Tian Zhi yelled.

That bald man’s body was already completely sucked dry and those little T-Rex Leeches had increased in size, they were wriggling to Lin Xiu’s side at this moment!

“Go!” Tian Zhi saw this dangerous scene and roared. He had goosebumps all over his body, these things were too disgusting.

However, Lin Xiu wasn’t afraid at this moment. Instead, he was very excited.

Each of these larvae was considered one entity and they were rank 3!!!

Experience! A huge wave of experience was coming to him!

“Hurry up!” Tian Zhi thought that Lin Xiu was terrified and wanted to pull him away when Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear and charged over!

“Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!”
