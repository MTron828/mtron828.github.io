1267 Crazy Liu Mo

The domain force of a warrior was very strange. If Lin Xiu didn’t have ‘Purification Domain’, it would not be so easy to kill the warrior quickly.

But this time, Lin Xiu’s ‘Purification Domain’ failed, which made Lin Xiu feel extremely troublesome about the domain force released by Liu Mo.

In this domain, there were many black lightning bolts.

These black lightning bolts were different from ordinary lightnings, they were extremely weird.

Moreover, Lin Xiu, who has a strong resistance to lightning, also found that he could not block the impact of these black lightning bolts on his body.

Bang bang bang——

And at this time, Baili Haoling also rushed in front of Lin Xiu, and with the two swords in her hands, she slashed at the black lightning bolts on Lin Xiu’s body that seemed to bind Lin Xiu’s body.

But these black lightning bolts did not break due to Baili Haoling’s slashing.

Instead, through Baili Haoling’s double swords, they were directly wrapped around Baili Haoling’s arms.

“Damn…”

Baili Haoling’s red eyes widened.

Because she clearly noticed that, as these black bolts of lightning wrapped around her arms, she felt a sharp pain in both arms.

In addition to the pain, it seemed to have a paralyzing effect.

The hands holding the two swords became a little uncontrollable.

“I want you guys to die, I want you guys to die!!!”

Liu Mo, whose arm was torn off by Lin Xiu just now, has already become a little crazy.

Originally, when he got the news that Lin Xiu was going to come to Changqing City on his own initiative, he was pleasantly surprised. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Because in his opinion, Lin Xiu was courting death.

But he never expected that Lin Xiu’s strength would be so powerful. Not only did he destroy all the attack machines in Changqing City, but even almost all of his subordinates were killed!

You know, Lin Xiu was only with a young guy and two weird evolved beasts and he destroyed everything!

He had trained so many subordinates, but in such a short period of time, all of them were killed!

With infinite killing intent, Liu Mo’s only remaining hand pointed at Lin Xiu.

Crackling——

In an instant, a large number of black lightning bolts in this domain gathered in his palm.

“die!”

Following his roar again, these terrifying black lightning bolts directly charged toward Lin Xiu!

The gathered black lightning bolt was huge, like a giant black snake.

Lin Xiu looked at this extremely huge black lightning bolt and the look in his eyes changed drastically.

What powerful energy!

“Go away!”

Seeing that Baili Haoling, Rollie and Xiaobai were coming over, Lin Xiu immediately shouted angrily.

The power emanating from the body directly shook them away.

Prevent them from being affected by this terrifying force.

This Liu Mo obviously wants to use up all the black lightning generated in this domain and directly destroy Lin Xiu.

This move was indeed extremely terrifying. Even if Lin Xiu unfolded the ‘Sphere’, Lin Xiu felt that there may be no way to deal with it.

However, he still has ‘Golden Body Immortality’!!!

Before this extremely terrifying black lightning struck, Lin Xiu directly activated the system’s ‘Reset’ skill.

Then release ‘Golden Body Immortality’ again!

At the same time that the seemingly incomparably terrifying black lightning hit Lin Xiu’s body, a dazzling light burst out again!

Seeing this scene, Liu Mo’s face became extremely ferocious.

Golden light, this kind of golden light again!

It was because of this golden light that his attack was ineffective just now and one of his arms was torn off by Lin Xiu.

Unexpectedly, the golden light burst out again.

“I want you to die!!!”

Liu Mo’s face was full of unwillingness and his right hand was facing Lin Xiu. A large number of black lightning continued to charge toward Lin Xiu!

The duration of the ‘Golden Body Immortality’ was only one second, which was just enough to resist the most terrifying bolt of lightning.

But at this time, the rest of the lightning continued to hit him, making him feel extremely uncomfortable.

At this time, it was already getting dark.

Lin Xiu endured the pain caused by the black lightning and after looking up at the sky, surprise appeared on his face.

‘Power of the Stars’!

This skill can only be used in the dark.

And at this time, Lin Xiu can just release this skill!

As soon as the ‘Power of the Stars’ came out, thousands of stars twinkled in the sky.

And the light from those stars quickly converged on Lin Xiu’s body.

...

Taking a closer look, at this moment, Lin Xiu’s entire body was filled with white light.

Like a god of war.

Time was almost up for ‘Fury’, because Lin Xiu just used the ‘Reset’ skill, at this time, he continued to use ‘Fury’.

Lin Xiu found it a pity that the second use of ‘Fury’ cannot be superimposed, it can only increase the duration of ‘Fury’.

“Impossible! This is impossible!”

Liu Mo looked at Lin Xiu who was not far away. At this time, he, who possessed the power of the stars, became even stronger!

Liu Mo roared like crazy.

Because he had just burned his life force, he forced himself to become extremely powerful.

However, the two attacks that he gathered with his strongest strength failed to kill Lin Xiu and he had already consumed a lot of energy.

And at this time, his already wrinkled skin became even more wrinkled.

Obviously, his life force was about to be completely exhausted.

...

“Ding! When abnormal energy is found, the ‘Engulf’ skill will be activated automatically!”

And at this moment, those black lightning bolts seemed to want to penetrate Lin Xiu’s body, and destroy it.

But at the same time, the notification sound from the system that made Lin Xiu feel extremely pleasant sounded.

Can ‘Engulf’ these dark lightning bolts!?

Lin Xiu was extremely pleasantly surprised.

When he wasn’t able to swallow it just now, the black lightning caused pain and paralysis to the body.

Now with the devouring of the system’s ‘Engulf’ skill, Lin Xiu instantly felt much better.

Seeing this scene not far away, Baili Haoling couldn’t help but heaved a sigh of relief.

Although she didn’t know what happened just now, Lin Xiu did resist the attack of the terrifying black lightning.

It was his turn to fight back.

Lin Xiu looked at Liu Mo not far away and wanted to gather those black bolts of lightning in this domain to attack him.

With the triggering of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, Heart of frost started to work.

The surrounding air became extremely cold at this moment.

Kala Kala——

Following the crisp sounds, Liu Mo felt an extremely cold feeling coming from his feet.

what is this!?

The pupils in Liu Mo’s eyes suddenly shrank and he looked up at his feet.
