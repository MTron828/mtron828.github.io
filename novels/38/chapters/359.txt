Chapter 360: Lockdown

Seeing that Lin Xiu had activated the special silver card, Zeng Ruo’ suddenly appeared very nervous.

Lin Xiu was stunned then instinctively pressed a circular pattern on the card. In the next moment, the 3D projection disappeared instantly.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Xiu was a little puzzled.

“This thing is a very rare ore collected from another galaxy. It cannot be shown publicly.” Zeng Ruo looked around and heaved a sigh of relief when nobody noticed them, then whispered to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded. He stared at the silver card in his hand and revealed a hint of surprise.

The alien ore…what exactly is it?

“We can’t leave this area by air?” Luo Yue looked at the sky and there was a light blue barrier covering the entire area.

This was an all-around defense weapon. Once an aircraft passes this barrier, it will be directly shot down by a large number of powerful and terrifying lasers.

“Yes, we’re on high alert now and Deep Blue City has stopped letting people outside come in by air.”

Zeng Ruo answered Luo Yue immediately.

“So we can’t go back either?” Lin Xiu frowned slightly, then looked at Luo Yue and asked.

After finally leaving the dark forest, he thought he could return to the Sacred Region academy, and didn’t expect to encounter this.

“Go back where?” Zeng Ruo asked.

“Sacred Region Academy.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

Sacred Region Academy!?

Zeng Ruo looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue with a hint of surprise – that’s the most famous and mysterious academy in China! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

He did not expect that they turned out to be students of the Sacred Region Academy!

But after thinking about it carefully, with Luo Yue’s identity, there was nothing strange about her being a student of the Sacred Region Academy.

“The entire place is on lockdown, we don’t have a way…” Zeng Ruo said embarrassedly.

Although he was the captain here, he was not the person in power and there was no way he could do anything.

“Forget it, let’s go.” Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu and said.

“En.”

“Be careful, if you need anything, just tell the soldiers on patrol to look for Zeng Ruo.” Zeng Ruo said when he saw that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were leaving.

Because he knew of Luo Yue identity, he spoke very cautiously as if he was afraid that Luo Yue would be unhappy.

Watching Lin Xiu and Luo Yue leave, Zeng Ruo wiped the sweat from his forehead then heaved a sigh of relief.

“I didn’t expect that someone from that family actually came here…” Zeng Ruo opened his palm at this time and looked at the stamped seal. There was still a hint of horror in his eyes.

“What did you give him?” After leaving with Luo Yue, Lin Xiu looked at her with a curious expression.

Zeng Ruo should be pretty strong, at least a rank 7 warrior, and Lin Xiu didn’t expect that after he saw the seal that Luo Yue threw to him, he became like this.

“Clan seal.” Luo Yue seemed to have known what Lin Xiu wanted to ask and answered almost instantly.

Clan seal?

“That thing should be quite important, right…”

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu recalled that Luo Yue’s family was probably a very strong family, so Zeng Ruo was shocked when he saw that seal, right?

“No, that kind of thing is easy to get.” Luo Yue shook her head then said indifferently.

They continued walking and arrived at the Aviation Building of the Sacred Region academy.

This was a branch of the Sacred Region academy that was responsible for shipping.

Di——

They walked to the gate and Lin Xiu and Luo Yue took out their student identity cards and tapped them at the gate. The transparent glass gate opened automatically.

“Oh? There are students going back now?” At this time, in the hall inside, a white-haired old man was sweeping the floor while he looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue who came in.

Lin Xiu looked around and found that there was no one in this empty hall except this old man.

“Well, hello, are we unable to return to the Sacred Region Academy now?” Lin Xiu nodded, then walked to the old man and said to him.

“En, now is not possible.” The old man touched his beard then said with a smile.

Although Lin Xiu already knew it, he was still a little upset when he heard the old man’s confirmation.

“When will it be possible?” Lin Xiu thought for a while and asked.

The status of Sacred Region Academy was very extraordinary. As a gathering point for the branches of the Sacred Region Academy, you should be able to find out some information that even Zeng Ruo didn’t know, right?

“I don’t know.” The old man said directly.

“I heard that the Deep Blue City has lost an important thing and it is now being in complete lockdown. This level of lockdown hasn’t happened in the past ten years.”

He touched his beard at this time, then shook his head and sighed.

Lin Xiu was speechless.

Luo Yue has already walked to the front desk, but it was very weird today. Except for this old man, there was no one at the front desk.

” Don’t bother, everyone is on leave today,” the old man spoke as he swept the floor.

On leave?

Lin Xiu was taken aback. Just as he was about to say something, he saw the old man walking towards the front desk and said to Luo Yue, “Do you want to rest here??”

“After all, the whole place is on lockdown and it wouldn’t be easy to return to the Sacred Regino Academy.” The old man said at this time.

“Why don’t you stay here for a day or two to see the situation?” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue at this time and suggested.

Other than aviation purposes, the Sacred Region academy branch building here also functions as a hotel, providing accommodation and rest for the people of the Sacred Region academy.

“Alright.” Luo Yue nodded.

“There is no one here now, do you want the most luxurious room?” The old man sized Lin Xiu and Luo Yue up at this time then said with an ambiguous expression.

Hearing this old man’s words, Lin Xiu’s forehead was covered with black lines.

This old man was… so vulgar!
