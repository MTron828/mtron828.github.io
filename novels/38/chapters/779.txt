Chapter 780: Kill Raging Flame Lion and Upgrade Again

Lin Xiu directly unfolded his ‘Sphere’!

As Lin Xiu’s strength increased, Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” became even more terrifying now.

Although those terrifying flames hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, they were all blocked.

And because Lin Xiu was good at using fire, he didn’t have any fear at all.

With those terrifying flames, he continued to charge over!

Roar–

The Raging Flame Lion clearly felt that Lin Xiu’s figure was familiar and at this time became even more furious.

But the flames it spewed out could not harm Lin Xiu at all.

And Lin Xiu, who rushed up, rushed directly into its huge mouth!

boom–

With a dull sound, a huge hole instantly appeared above the head of the Raging Flame Lion.

Roar–

The last cry of the Raging Flame Lion came out and the pair of eyes that seemed to be full of flames slowly extinguished at this time.

The whole body seemed to lose its vitality in an instant.

In the next moment, it fell directly to the ground, making a loud noise.

The surrounding warriors were all stunned. Just now, they were busy avoiding the terrifying flames of the Raging Flame Lion and didn’t pay attention.

Now they realized that this terrifying Raging Flame Lion is dead! VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Finally died.”

Some of the surrounding warriors ran over there and heaved a sigh of relief.

“Odd crystal!”

“The odd crystal is mine!”

The surrounding warriors went crazy after hearing about the Odd crystal.

This Raging Flame Lion is a king-level evolved beast and it is also a peak king-level.

Obtaining the odd crystal of this king-level evolved beast would be very beneficial for one’s own strength growth.

Some warriors have already shoved and beat other warriors and they were fighting for it.

“Odd crystal! Where’s my odd crystal!?”

At this time, Wan Qiansan rushed to the opposite side and found that there was a huge hole in the head of this beast.

As if it was penetrated at some point.

There was still blood on Wan Qiansan’s cheeks and at this moment, the whole person froze in place.

Looking up, he saw a man with a mask on the cliff above.

And in his hand, he was holding a spear that looked like amethyst-colored glass and in the other hand, was a fiery red Odd crystal!

It was the Odd crystal of the flame lion!

Undoubtedly, it was snatched by this masked man!

“This is mine!”

At this moment, Wan Qiansan roared angrily, then jumped, stepped on the cliff and rushed upwards!

Guan Qian watched Wan Qiansan’s movements, looked up and saw the existence of the masked man.

Not only him, but also a large number of Master Warrior-level warriors around him, all used their own source strength to display their own body skills and leaped up.

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

With so many Master Warrior-level warriors, it would be a little troublesome to deal with them all.

Moreover, the strength of Wan Qiansan and Guan Qian is not weak.

With this thought, Lin Xiu jumped directly to the top of the cliff, then left.

“That one just now...is Brother Lin right…”

The Warrior’s eyes were very good. Liu Pan saw the figure of the man wearing a mask and jumping on the cliff from a distance and said subconsciously.

“Shut up.”

When An Qi and Qian Lin heard Liu Pan’s words, they glared at Liu Pan and said.

Liu Pan also seemed to have reacted at this time and quickly covered his mouth.

Lin Xiu got the king-level odd crystal and this must not be known to the others or Lin Xiu might be killed.

After all, Lin Xiu is not from Marqi Planet and he has no power here.

If the rest of the people knew that he had a king-level odd crystal, they would definitely send a lot of people to besiege him.

As the saying goes, a person’s talent would arouse the envy of others.

“Oh right, let’s go to the cave over there quickly. Didn’t Brother Lin say that there are many Odd crystals in it!”

Liu Pan, who had originally covered his mouth, seemed to have thought of something and suddenly said a little excitedly.

An Qi and Qian Lin also reacted at this time and the eyes of the three suddenly turned to the cave in the distance in front of them.

Almost all the warriors wanted to snatch the king-level odd crystal and some were frantically slaughtering the corpse of the Raging Flame Lion with weapons and taking its body materials.

But they seem to have forgotten that there is something inside the cave!

At this time, the three hurried to the cave.

Lin Xiu’s speed was very fast at this time. When he just jumped onto the cliff, he saw the forest in front of him and rushed in instantly.

Then took a detour and returned to the bottom.

There were still many high-level odd crystals in the cave and Lin Xiu didn’t want to give up on these either.

And just after killing the Raging Flame Lion, Lin Xiu had already heard the system prompt.

Upgraded! Upgraded!

While running, Lin Xiu had already started to check his attributes:

He is now level 52!

Lin Xiu just thought about it for a while, then added all the remaining potential points to his strength.

At the current speed of Lin Xiu and with the ‘Without a Trace’ movement technique, they couldn’t catch up with Lin Xiu at all.

Soon, Lin Xiu had detoured again and returned to the valley just now.

There was a large number of corpses of warriors on the ground, blood flowing into rivers.

It attracted a lot of weird evolved beasts.

These evolved beasts looked at Lin Xiu who came over and seemed to ignore him, they were all devouring the corpses of those warriors on the ground.

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help feeling a chill down his spine.

Continuing to walk to the front, there are still a lot of broken hands and feet on the ground.

It can be said that the battle this time was very tragic.

That gigantic Raging Flame Lion had already been dissected by the warriors in a short time and revealed an huge skeleton.

Lin Xiu didn’t pay much attention to this and walked directly to the cave at this time.

“These are all ours.”

At this time, there, some warriors were holding long knives at the necks of Liu Pan and the others.
