1152 Tianlan Pavilion

This hot feeling is too strong.

Lin Xiu found it a little bit unbearable now.

And at this moment, there was a strange cold feeling in the body.

Lin Xiu felt extremely uncomfortable as it was a combination of sharply contrasting elements.

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and forced himself to calm down.

No matter how painful he has experienced, this kind of pain is nothing!

At this time, as time passed slowly, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that this uncomfortable feeling gradually became weaker and weaker.

“Hu…”

At this moment, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

When he opened my eyes, he found that what he saw became clearer.

And on the body, there was a little sticky feeling.

“It stinks…”

Lin Xiu took a closer look at this time and found that there was a lot of black matter seeping out of his body.

Logically speaking, the body after being reshaped by holy water should be very pure, but now, some substances were still discharged with the cleansing pill.

Although a little puzzled, at this time, Lin Xiu clearly felt that his body became more comfortable.

After washing and cleaning in the room, he immediately felt refreshed.

After wearing the God warrior suit presented by the system, Lin Xiu looked majestic and radiant.

After taking a deep breath, Lin Xiu walked out.

“Oh? You’re out?”

At this moment, an unfamiliar voice came from outside.

When Lin Xiu walked to the lobby of the City Lord’s Mansion, he could see that there were quite a few warriors sitting there.

After these warriors saw Lin Xiu come out, they immediately looked at Lin Xiu.

But the eyes of these people don’t seem so kind.

“Mr. Pang, what’s the matter?”

Lin Xiu looked at Mr. Pang who was not far away and said aloud.

He saw bruises on Mr. Pang’s face as if he had been punched.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but raise his brows.

“You are new here.”

Before Mr. Pang could say anything, one of the men sitting on the chair over there with his legs crossed, said coldly.

“Pour me a cup of tea first.”

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu was startled for a moment, then he couldn’t help laughing out loud.

Immediately, his face scrunched up, “Are you a fool?”

Lin Xiu now could tell that these people must be looking for something.

“Courting death!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the man’s face suddenly turned into a snarl.

In the next moment, he stood up suddenly and slapped Lin Xiu on the cheek.

boom–

But at this moment, Lin Xiu grabbed his wrist as soon as he moved his right hand.

Kala——

As Lin Xiu’s hand exerted a little force, at this moment, the sound of a broken bone suddenly sounded.

“what!!!”

The bones of his wrist were directly crushed by Lin Xiu!

Some sharp bones pierced out of his skin at this time.

“Get lost.”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and in the next moment, the man’s body was directly sent flying out.

When the other warriors saw this scene, they all reacted quickly and hugged the body of the man who flew out.

They looked at Lin Xiu with murderous intent in their eyes.

But because of Lin Xiu’s God warrior-level strength, they don’t dare to make a move.

“Do you know who we are!”

One of the men looked at Lin Xiu angrily at this time.

It never occurred to him that Lin Xiu would show no mercy at all.

“That has nothing to do with me.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Get out of here, or else, die.”

When Lin Xiu spoke out, his eyes were full of killing intent.

This kind of killing intent was so terrifying, they looked at Lin Xiu as if they had seen a hellish scene.

At this moment, they trembled slightly.

“Just you wait!”

At this time, these people left quickly.

He didn’t seem to have thought that Lin Xiu would be so tough.

“Mr. Pang, who are they?”

After watching them leave, Lin Xiu said to Mr. Pang.

“They are from Tianlan Pavilion.”

At this time, Mr. Pang sighed and said.

According to Mr. Pang, this Tianlan Pavilion is the most powerful force entrenched in this Lingxian City.

Every three years, new city lords come over and they are forced to join their Tianlan Pavilion, or become the lackeys of Tianlan Pavilion and help them do things.

Once rejected, those city lords will suffer annihilation.

The previous city lords fought against them and died for no reason.

“It seems that this so-called city lord is useless.”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help sighing at this moment.

At least it was a fact here.

“City Lord, you should leave this place.”

Mr. Pang thought for a while, then said aloud.

“leave this place?”

Lin Xiu said curiously.

“Why should I leave?”

“These people will not give up.”

Mr. Pang has been here for so long and has seen too many such examples.

“Where is Tianlan Pavilion?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Mr. Pang originally thought that Lin Xiu would listen to his words and leave, but when he heard Lin Xiu’s words, he was stunned.

“you want to…”

“Destroy him.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“No, the power of Tianlan Pavilion has been entrenched here for more than a hundred years and its strength is deeply rooted, there is absolutely no way…”

Mr. Pang said quickly at this time.

“Tell me the address.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

This so-called Tianlan Pavilion can actually control every city lord, so it is certain that the power is very strong.

But he is not someone who will be obediently controlled. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

And after coming to the God warrior Realm, Lin Xiu could also feel that the strength of the warriors here is much stronger than that on the Namir planet.

The warriors just now were all at the Sage warrior level.

Of course, after reaching the God warrior level, a Sage warrior was nothing at all.

At this time, Lin Xiu also understood a little why the ancestor of the Bai family, even if he had reached the God warrior level, did not want to come to the God warrior Realm.

This God warrior Realm is far more complicated than Lin Xiu had imagined.

“Ay.”

At this moment, Mr. Pang looked at Lin Xiu walking out, shook his head and sighed.

In his opinion, Lin Xiu is still too young.

Compared with the previous city lords, Lin Xiu was even more reckless.

At this time, as Lin Xiu walked out of the door, he saw that this Lingxian City was not so prosperous.

Although there were warriors walking around, but the faces of these warriors were full of exhaustion.

It looked very weird.

What’s happening?
