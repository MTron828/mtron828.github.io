Chapter 223: Fighting Zhuo Qixing!

Everyone turned to look at them when they heard Lin Xiu’s words.

The majority of the students looked at him in confusion.

His opponent was the class monitor of class 1, the number 1 freshman Zhuo Qixing. Wasn’t he seeking death?

Zhuo Qixing looked at Lin Xiu and smirked.

He was not afraid of a fight, but afraid that Lin Xiu would not agree to the fight!

Dean Baili looked at Lin Xiu and Zhuo Qixing with interest in his eyes.

It was his first time seeing class 1 and class 10 competing.

How could it be that the boy was actually at rank 5, he was not weak at all! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

‘When they split classes, him being placed in class 10 meant that his strength was insufficient. This also meant that in the short timespan, he actually reached rank 5?’

“What do you think?” Dean Baili looked at the teachers in charge of class 1 and class 10 and said.

“I have no objection.” Class 10 teacher replied indifferently.

He knew Zhuo Qixing’s strength and if nothing was out of sorts, their class would definitely win!

As long as they won the battle, they would be in the first place!

Nan Zhengjun’s expression was not as great.

Although he was ecstatic that his class was tied for first place, he knew that Zhuo Qixing was already at peak rank 5 and close to rank 6.

The chance of Lin Xiu winning him with that strength was extremely bleak.

“What? Is teacher Nan afraid of losing?” Class 1 teacher looked at Nan Zhengjun and asked indifferently.

“Hmph!” Nan Zhengjun snorted when he heard his words and looked over to Lin Xiu: “Since he said that it is fine, I won’t interfere.”

Dean Baili nodded his head then looked at the crowd and announced, “Let everything go as it is. Let the competition for first place start now.”

‘Start now!?’

All the students were surprised and looked over at Lin Xiu and Zhuo Qixing.

“Then come.” Zhuo Qixing held his sword tightly and pointed it at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu did not reply but held Dark Edge Spear tightly, his eyes fixated on Zhuo Qixing with fighting intent.

All the Sacred Region Academy students that suffered under Lin Xiu’s hands looked over at him.

The competitors looked at each other as though electricity were flying out from their eyes and colliding in the center.

Although they did not want to admit it, they knew that Lin Xiu was extremely strong.

“Hmph, this brat will definitely be killed by Zhuo Qixing.” Tian Zixia looked at Lin Xiu and commented.

If not for him, her class would have been first.

The prizes for first place and third place were extremely different!

Upon thinking about this, she hated Lin Xiu even more.

“No, that brat’s skills are too strange.” Ouyang Hang replied gloomily from beside her.

Although he had yet to recover from his injuries, they did not impede him.

Tian Zixia nodded, it had to be admitted that Lin Xiu was strong to defeat Ouyang Hang.

All the students gradually separated and formed a large circle.

Lin Xiu and Zhuo Qixing both stood inside the circle.

“Lin Xiu, defeat him!!!” Zhang Yin waved his fists and said.

The people from south campus class 10 were anxious, after all the person opposite them was no ordinary freshman, he was the strongest freshman!

And Lin Xiu was just the class monitor of south campus class 10.

The expression in Luo Yue’s eyes changed but she stood by the side quietly and observed Lin Xiu.

She believed that Lin Xiu would definitely win.

“The winning class will take first place for the freshmen assembly.” Dean Baili stroked his beard and said.

It had been many years since such an interesting matter occurred, he stroked his own beard and watched on with excitement.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath. He had recovered all his energy and after leveling up, he felt as though his strength had reached its peak state.

It was a pity that fury was still on cooldown and he was unable to use it.

‘Maybe the battle will be slightly dangerous.’

“Who would have thought that you would absorb the energy inside the rank 8 odd crystal.” Zhuo Qixing glared at lin Xiu.

A rank 8 evolved beast was rare and he needed the ice attribute rank 8 odd crystal.

But Lin Xiu had taken it and actually absorbed it in a short time span.

“There are many things you can’t even think of.” Lin Xiu squinted his eyes and replied.

“Fine, let us battle!” Zhuo Qixing heard Lin Xiu’s unbridled tone and killing intent flooded his eyes. He suddenly lunged forward with his sword!

‘He’s on the move!’

All the students immediately flew into an uproar, Zhuo Qixing was too fast and he quickly arrived before Lin Xiu.

He slashed towards Lin Xiu with his sword!

All the south campus class 10 people held their breaths as their hearts flew up to their throats.

Clank-

But right at that moment, Lin Xiu moved his right hand and used Dark Edge to block the sword.

This produced a clear and crisp sound.

“Hmph! Take this!” Zhuo Qixing snorted as his eyes glazed with a cold aura.

Source strength suddenly surged forward as he slashed down at Lin Xiu!

His sword arts were sharp and direct, every strike was aimed at Lin Xiu’s vital parts!

Clank clank clank-

Lin Xiu frowned, Zhuo Qixing’s attacks were too sharp which was followed up by his explosive source strength.

Lin Xiu was able to sense the sharp sword aura just by deflecting his blows and caused pain in his arms.

Zhuo Qixing was already furious when Lin Xiu escaped in G17 ruin, this made him go all out.

“Scram!” Lin Xiu became annoyed by Lin Xiu’s unrelenting attacks.

He pushed forward with both hands on the spear and forced Zhuo Qixing back!

“Awe of the Phoenix!!!!” Lin Xiu unleashed his skill immediately without hesitation!
