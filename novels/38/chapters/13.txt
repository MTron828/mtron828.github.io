Chapter 14: Poisoned

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“What material is this made of…” Lin Xiu clicked his tongue. It might be made up of a special metal from another planet. Otherwise, it was impossible for it to be so sharp.

“Stop talking nonsense. Lay me down and deal with it,” said Luo Yue coldly.

Lin Xiu quickly lay Luo Yue down next to a huge tree, then pulled that long sword out of the ground, and held it tightly with both hands.

It was really too heavy. Judging by the way she previously brandished the sword, just how strong were those two small arms of hers?

“On your left...” Luo Yue hurriedly called out.

Left!?

At this moment, the red-winged snake had already charged over at a fast speed.

The snake kept spitting and its red eyes were staring straight at Lin Xiu, as though it saw something delicious.

“Swish.” Lin Xiu waved the sword with force.

But that red-winged snake was simply too quick and managed to dodge.

“Turn and pierce downwards!” Luo Yue knitted her brows and said plainly.

For an evolved beast of this rank, she could deal with it easily if she wasn’t injured.

Hearing Luo Yue’s instructions, Lin Xiu was taken aback at first but quickly reacted to it. He held the sword with both hands and did accordingly. That red-winged snake was instantly stabbed in the middle and nailed to the ground.

“Ss ss——”

It let out a few noises and desperately struggled to bite Lin Xiu. Since its body was stuck to the ground by the long sword, it couldn’t move at all.

It’s that simple!?

“Tsk, you are really mad, huh!” Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief and said to that snake.

“Come on, bite me, bite me, ah…” Just at this moment, that red-winged snake’s head actually broke apart and it flew straight to Lin Xiu, biting his arm.

Luo Yue couldn’t help but smile when she saw this scene, but she quickly returned to her usual self.

“Darn it!” Lin Xiu pulled its head from his arm, then tossed it on the ground and trampled on it hard, turning it into mud.

“Ding~~”

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 2 red-winged snake. You’ve gained 2500 experience points.”

When Lin Xiu heard the icy cold voice in his head, he heaved a sigh of relief.

“You didn’t warn me.” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue and said angrily. She definitely knew that this red-winged snake’s head could be separated from its body!

“You didn’t ask.” Luo Yue glanced askance at Lin Xiu and replied indifferently.

Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched, then he retrieved the odd crystal from the snake’s head that he had trampled on.

Rank 2 odd crystal – it was worth quite a bit.

However, Lin Xiu froze all of a sudden. He suddenly felt a sharp pain where he was bitten.

Subsequently, his entire body became scorching hot.

Oh no, the Analytic Eye had mentioned that this snake’s fangs were venomous!

“There’s cold water over there.” Luo Yue’s eyes glanced at the side as she spoke.

“Cold water can detoxify?”

Lin Xiu returned to his senses when he heard her. ‘Did she mean that cold water could get rid of this snake’s venom?’

He didn’t think much about it and quickly walked to the side, then jumped into that river directly.

The river water was very clear and the bottom could be seen under the moonlight.

As the cold river water soaked his whole body, Lin Xiu immediately felt the burning sensation being suppressed.

“Phew.” He felt relieved.

Such a type of venom would cause one’s body to be burning hot. But with the help of cold water, it shouldn’t affect him much.

“Oh, it’s you.” The leader of the group laughed and said.

Not long after, a group of people walked over and saw Luo Yue sitting against the tree.

“Go away or be killed by me!” Luo Yue frowned and shouted coldly at them.

Zhang Liang looked at Luo Yue leaning against the tree and the long sword that was a distance away. He could roughly guess that she was injured. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

And he was delighted!

He saw this woman previously and she managed to kill a rank 3 evolved beast with her sword. He was quite surprised by her terrifying strength.

More importantly, she was quite young.

“Boss, it looks like she’s severely injured and can’t move.” One of the men whispered into Zhang Liang’s ear.

Zhang Liang nodded, he thought so too.

“Zheng, zheng——”

Just at this moment, Luo Yue’s eyes constricted as she extended her right arm and that long sword flew toward her hand.

She stared at those people and said coldly, “Get lost.”

“Don’t try to scare me, you can’t use any force now, can you…” Zhang Liang was frightened, but he still said with a smirk.
