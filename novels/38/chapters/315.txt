Chapter 316: Fighting At The Bottom Of The Lake

After the warrior got stabbed, a lot of blood flowed out.

And at this moment, because the body of this warrior had no protection from the source strength, the flame began burning his body wildly in the lake.

In a short moment, the man was left with white bones and they were still being eroded continuously. It didn’t take long for them to completely disappear.

Such a powerful rank 7 warrior simply disappeared.

Lin Xiu’s eyes were filled with shock when he saw this scene.

This lake was really terrifying. If it weren’t for Luo Yue and these strange rays of light that could protect his body, he would probably share the same fate as this man after his source strength disappeared.

As time passed, more and more warriors jumped into the lake and rushed to the Ice Lotus Fire.

Everyone coveted the Ice Lotus Fire and the warriors were now fighting over it in the lake.

They were very powerful and with their source strength protecting their bodies, they began fighting wildly.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue hid on the other side and watched the battle and the Ice Lotus Fire over there.

When a warrior approaches this Ice Lotus Fire, he will be attacked by other warriors immediately and the situation was very chaotic.

But this Ice Lotus Fire was still growing and lotus petals were beginning to unfold.

Lin Xiu stared at this scene and suddenly his eyes widened.

The flame seemed to become more and more beautiful as it slowly grew into what looked like a white lotus.

And the shape looked like the red lotus fire that Lin Xiu swallowed previously.

It was clear that this Ice Lotus Fire is very powerful. If a warrior absorbs the power of this Ice Lotus Fire, his strength would be greatly enhanced.

Lin Xiu, who has swallowed the red lotus fire, knew this fact very well.

At this moment, as Lin Xiu and Luo Yue continued to watch these people fight, a warrior seemed to see a faint light behind the towering rocks and swam over immediately.

He swam behind Lin Xiu and Luo Yue; looking at the backs of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue hiding there, there was a ferocious glint in his eyes.

This was a good spot and as long as he hid here, he could take advantage of the situation and snatch the Ice Lotus Fire…

With that thought, the man drew half of the short knife from his back then slowly approached them.

Just as he was about to approach Luo Yue, he used a short knife to slash towards Lin Xiu!

Although the speed was not very fast due to the resistance of the water, this short knife was extremely sharp and it could directly cut Lin Xiu’s body in half!

Bang–

But at this moment, Luo Yue suddenly turned around and with a dagger in her hand, she directly blocked the attack! 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The man’s short knife instantly collided with the dagger that Luo Yue swung suddenly, making a dull sound.

Lin Xiu turned around abruptly at this moment and saw a warrior appearing behind him.

This warrior also held a short knife and it collided with the dagger held by Luo Yue.

As they were in the water, there wasn’t a loud metal clanging when their weapons collided.

Lin Xiu’s expression changed when he saw this scene. When did a warrior approach and attack them from the back!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu felt a chill down his spine. If not for Luo Yue’s fast reaction, he would probably be in danger.

With that thought, Lin Xiu directly reached out and attacked the man!

‘Rupturing Fist’!!!

Because of the strange light on his body, Lin Xiu’s punch didn’t seem to be greatly affected by the water resistance and he quickly attacked the man’s body!

Although the power of ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’ was much greater than the ‘Rupturing Fist’, if he used the ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’ now, the other warriors at the other side would probably notice the lightning generated and it would be very troublesome for him.

As they were fighting over the Ice Lotus Fire, the best way was to wait here. When the warriors kill each other, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue can take the advantage of it and snatch the Ice Lotus Fire!

Boom–

Lin Xiu’s ‘Rupturing Fist’ directly attacked the man’s shoulder!

It made a dull sound.

The man’s gaze changed, his body was knocked back and he felt the bones in his shoulder cracking.

A sharp pain came over him.

And Luo Yue did not hesitate at all. She held the dagger and continued to attack the man!

When the man saw this, the pupils in his eyes constricted.

He initially wanted to sneak an attack and kill Lin Xiu, but didn’t expect that Luo Yue would notice him.

What’s even more terrifying was that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue weren’t very affected by the extremely high water density.

They could still attack so swiftly!

Although he was a rank 7 warrior and Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were clearly of a lower rank than him, he was affected by the lake and his speed of reaction had been significantly reduced by about 70%!

Bang–

When the dagger in Luo Yue’s hand was going towards the man’s body again, he suppressed the sharp pain in his shoulder and used the short knife to block her attack.

Although he blocked Luo Yue’s attack, Lin Xiu was behind and continued to attack!

Lin Xiu’s speed was also very fast and he directly used the ‘Rupturing Fist’ to attack wildly!

Bang bang bang——

As the soft and dull sounds rang out, Lin Xiu’s punches landed heavily on the man’s body.

Each punch to the flesh!

Click, click, click——

As Lin Xiu’s fist attacked his body, all the bones in his body fractured.

Luo Yue seized the opportunity, then directly swung the dagger across his neck, killing him instantly.

Gurgle gurgle——

Following the killing of this warrior, his body was instantly burned due to the lack of protection from the source strength.

Soon, like other warriors, the lake corroded his body completely till there was nothing left!

Phew——

Seeing that this man was dealt with, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but heaved a sigh of relief. If other warriors found out that he and Luo Yue were here, it would probably cause a lot of trouble.

But at this moment, a bright light reflected from behind Lin Xiu.

What’s happening!?
