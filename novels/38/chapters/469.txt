Chapter 470: Return to Xing Yao City!

“Huh? There is one in the E99 area?” Dean Baili was startled when he heard the middle-aged man’s words.

This kind of artificial intelligence robot was very rare on the market.

Because the current federal government has banned the production of such independent artificial intelligence robots.

Only semi-intelligent robots could be produced as they were no threat to human beings.

“Yes, there is an artificial intelligence robot of the same model that seems to be salvaged on E99.” The middle-aged man nodded, then took out his mobile phone, and after pressing the button, some photos were projected on the opposite wall.

Looking at the pictures, Dean Baili’s brows furrowed.

Who made these robots…?

Thinking of this, a puzzled expression appeared in his eyes.

“Continue to let people investigate.” Dean Baili said to the middle-aged man at this time.

“Yes!” The middle-aged man nodded, and he clearly felt that this matter may have been targeted at the Sacred Region Academy.

But what about the artificial intelligence robots that appeared in the E99 area?

He was a little bit confused.

“Artificial intelligence…” Seeing the middle-aged man leave, Dean Baili stood beside the French window, staring at the scene below and mumbled to himself.

As for Lin Xiu, who was at the villa, he was still practicing in the hall at this time.

These diamond skills, as well as the diamond body arts, although all the information was recorded in Lin Xiu’s mind, the coordination of his body has not been able to keep up, so he must practice continuously.

“According to the report, as the glacier in the E99 area melted, the zombies under the ice restarted their activities…”

“The neighboring cities are all on first level alert…”

Just as he was about to take a break, Lin Xiu saw the news on the huge screen in the lobby.

The picture on the screen was the scene in the E99 area.

In the past few days, all the glaciers over there seem to have melted, and the entire ice city has turned into a vast river.

What was even more terrifying was that thousands of zombies in those cities under the glacier had come back to life!

They were rushing towards the nearby city along with the current!

“Damn!” Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

Because Lin Xiu knew that these zombies were not ordinary zombies. They wouldn’t drown in water and all the terrifying zombies would flood into nearby cities!

And Xing Yao City was not very far from that area, it was obvious that Xing Yao City would be affected!

And most importantly, in Xing Yao Academy, he still had one or two friends, and his little sister next door, Ye Shuang’er, who also goes to school there!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but get nervous.

He logged into the Warrior Union website because the information on the website was the most detailed.

Soon, by paying Union Coins, Lin Xiu found out that those awakened zombies and evolved beasts had really attacked that area!

Seeing this, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank suddenly.

No, I have to go back!

Lin Xiu ran to the other side without any hesitation.

Dean Baili was still standing by the window, his eyes looked far away, as if thinking of something, his brows were frowning.

But at this moment, the closed door was opened directly.

Bang–

Dean Baili was taken aback at this moment, and then subconsciously turned around and saw that Lin Xiu had run in.

He seemed anxious.

“What’s the matter?” Dean Baili stared at Lin Xiu who ran back and then said with a smile. |

“I want to apply to go back.” Lin Xiu looked at Dean Baili and said seriously.

“Xing Yao City?” Dean Baili knew Lin Xiu’s background very well. Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, he said directly.

“That’s right.” Lin Xiu nodded.

In this situation, he had to go back; the overall strength of Xing Yao City was weak compared to the nearby cities.

The zombies that awakened this time and those evolved beasts were very powerful.

Generally speaking, if the union government did not send troops there, the people in Xing Yao City would be in a very dangerous state.

And Lin Xiu also knew that for the people in Xing Yao City, that was their home. Even if there were spaceships, many people would still stay there to fight back.

“Because of the E99 area right.” Dean Baili seemed to think of something, then smiled and said.

“En.” There was nothing to hide so Lin Xiu nodded and said directly.

In the Sacred Region Academy, if you don’t have a task to complete, you wouldn’t be allowed to simply go out and even if you go out, it was a vast ocean, and you didn’t know where you are.

“I can approve and let someone send you there.” Dean Baili thought for a while, then smiled and said.

This old fox!

Seeing Dean Baili’s smile, Lin Xiu knew that this old guy must have something he wanted him to do.

“Tell me, what are the conditions.” Lin Xiu glanced at him contemptuously and then said. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Haha.” Dean Baili patted Lin Xiu on the shoulder and smiled, “It’s very simple, stop by the E99 area and check if there is any other information.”

“What information?” Lin Xiu was taken aback and said a little bit puzzled.

“We found an artificial intelligence robot of the same model over there.” Dean Baili pondered for a while, and then said meaningfully.

“Just the robot?” Lin Xiu heard Dean Baili’s words, and then subconsciously said.

“What else is there?” Dean Baili looked at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s heart jumped but there was no change in his eyes or expressions.

“I thought there were still space cracks or some terrifying evolved beast.” Lin Xiu said helplessly.

He looked very natural.

“Space crack…” Upon hearing this word, Dean Baili seemed to think of something, and fell into deep thoughts while touching his beard.

“Okay, when can I leave?” Lin Xiu interrupted Dean Baili’s thoughts and said.

“Tomorrow morning, I can arrange for the spacecraft to take you there, and give you one month, and you must be back on time.” Dean Baili nodded and said.

“Why?” Lin Xiu was a little surprised when he heard Dean Baili’s emphasis on coming back on time.
