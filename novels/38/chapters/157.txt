Chapter 158: Three Times Gravity

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and walked over to the control stage and turned up the gravity three times!

Upon increasing the gravity, Lin Xiu felt his eyes go black and almost fell to the ground.

Whew-

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and sat down in a lotus position.

He had unlocked rank 1 gene lock and his body composition had already gone through a heaven-toppling change.

His body looked like a human, but the cells in his body had turned into a direction of strengthening, the path of evolution.

Continue absorbing the energy!

Lin Xiu clenched his jaws and activated his cultivation technique. All the pores on his body seemed to open up and frantically absorb the energy from the rank 6 odd crystal!

Crack crack-

As the energy surged into his body, his veins, arteries, bones, and cells, a weird sound came out.

Lin Xiu frowned.

His entire body was in pain as though it was about to crumble.

At the same time, the system experience was jumping at an astronomical pace. Following the absorption of the energy inside the odd crystal, it was jumping by tens of thousands, hundreds, and even to a million!

No way, just a bit more, just a little bit more and I will absorb all the energy inside this rank 6 odd crystal!

Although his body was in pain, Lin Xiu knew that it was the constant breaking down and division of new cells in his body, induced by the energy to stimulate evolution.

The pain stemmed from too much energy flowing in.

“AHH!!!!” Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and roared. Very quickly, all the energy inside the odd crystal was absorbed into his body!

Huuuu-

Lin Xiu opened his eyes while gasping for breath.

All the pain gradually faded away and was replaced with an extremely comfortable feeling.

Lin Xiu wiped the blood away from his mouth and stood up slowly.

His reaction and speed had turned extremely slow under three times gravity.

The difference between two and three times gravity was not a literal one time increase and had a huge effect on warriors.

“Rupturing Fist!” Lin Xiu took a deep breath and launched a punch out!

Bang-

His punch became extremely weak inside the gravity room and his gloves did not even turn red.

“It’s already been five hours… god, did something happen to Lin Xiu?” After training for two hours outside, Jiang Li wiped away the perspiration on his forehead and looked at the gravity room entrance.

He had trained inside for two hours and already found it unbearable.

Although he was a warrior with a strong body, it was suited for normal gravity and it was normal to find it unbearable when suddenly placed inside two times gravity.

The most apparent symptom was shortness of breath, restricted blood circulation, and lightheadedness.

“No, there is an A.I. inside, if something happened to him, the A.I. will send him out.” Zhang Yin shook his head and replied.

His eyes were filled with surprise, how strong had Lin Xiu become? To actually stay inside for 5 hours!

“Class monitor should be training in three times gravity already.” Right then, Li Ping walked over and saw the number 3 at the side of the door and commented.

His eyes were filled with reverence. He was completely convinced by Lin Xiu at this point.

“Three times gravity?!” The others only realized that the number had turned to 3 after Li Ping’s comment!

The fact made them inhale in cold breaths.

Is he still human?

“Training systems under heavy gravity?” After training in Rupturing Fist inside the gravity room, Lin Xiu discovered there were other choices on the console for the machines in the room.

Lin Xiu walked over curiously, there were options 1 to 99.

Seems like there’s a difficulty level as well.

After pondering for a moment, Lin Xiu chose ‘1’.

Rumble-

When Lin Xiu hit confirm, a series of sounds came out and the ceiling opened up.

Lin Xiu looked up and saw laser beam machines above.

“Level 1 response training activated…”

“Starting in 3…”

What is this?!

Just when Lin Xiu was in shock, the laser beam machines started to shoot at him!

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted as he retreated backward and dodged a laser beam.

What shocked him further was that the laser beam that struck the ground actually bounced towards him!

What the hell is that!

Sou-

He was careless against one as it swept past his arm and instantly charred his skin!

Pain set in immediately.

If I get shot accurately by the laser beam, it might penetrate my body!

Upon thinking about this, Lin Xiu became tense.

Sou sou sou-

The machines above started shooting without any pattern. Lin Xiu could only rely on his reaction ability to avoid the attacks.

Damn it! Without my battle robes, I can’t block against these laser beams. I’ll be in trouble if I get shot for real!

At the brink of death, any human would unleash their latent potential.

Lin Xiu was no exception. He started to dodge all the laser beams with his tensed body!

He used Without a trace. Although his speed had been affected by the gravity, it was enough for him to avoid the laser beams.

Lin Xiu gradually relaxed as he got used to it.

After half an hour, Lin Xiu was able to close his eyes and sense where the laser beams were coming from. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

He would avoid them miraculously with an inch of a margin perfectly!

He was like a butterfly dancing.

Di di di-

Time hit 30 minutes and the machines on the ceiling retracted.

“End of training.”

Following the notification, Lin Xiu slowly opened his eyes.

“It’s over!?”

Lin Xiu was drenched in perspiration, but his face was covered with excitement.

Lin Xiu could sense that his body could improve greatly under such training!

‘The equipment and machines in Sacred Region Academy are too awesome, to train here is like having 10 days equivalent in one day!’

‘No wonder so many peak warriors want to come here.’

And only Sacred Region Academy had such unique training rooms, much less the other special training rooms they provided!
