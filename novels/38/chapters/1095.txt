Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

On both sides of this gate, there was a large number of laser weapons hidden.

At this time, all those laser rays were coming toward Lin Xiu!

“Be careful!”

Ye Kai watched this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank a little and said subconsciously.

Whoosh whoosh—

But at this moment, Lin Xiu had already unfolded the ‘Sphere’.

All those terrifying laser beams hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ and they did not have any effect on Lin Xiu.

And at this time, with a wave of Lin Xiu’s hand, all the laser weapons hidden on the walls on both sides exploded! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

At this moment, Lin Xiu stepped into the Chen family compound.

Because of Lin Xiu’s intrusion, a lot of red light flickered around.

It seems to be a warning device.

“Who dares to break into our Chen family!!!”

At this time, with a loud noise, Lin Xiu, who had just stepped into the Chen family compound, could clearly see that there were a large number of warriors and they were coming over.

Ye Kai watched this scene, holding the sword in his hand at this time, watching these warriors rushing out vigilantly.

“Oh turns out to be you, Ye Kai.”

And among the warriors who surrounded him, a middle-aged man came over.

At this time, the middle-aged man saw Ye Kai here and said coldly.

“Chen Jing, you betrayed your faith!”

Seeing Chen Jing, Ye Kai immediately said coldly.

The swords in his hands were held tightly.

You can clearly feel Ye Kai’s anger.

“Don’t be stupid, the Ye family has been exterminated for so long and you told me it’ll be back, what a joke.”

Chen Jing looked at Ye Kai in front of him and said coldly.

“But I’m very curious. You actually escaped from the Bai family, how strange.”

Chen Jing said indifferently.

“Master, he is Chen Jing.”

Ye Kai ignored Chen Jing’s words and said to Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly, then raised his hand and waved in the air and the token appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

“People from the Chen family, have you forgotten about this?”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Chen Jing looked at Lin Xiu’s hands subconsciously.

Taking a closer look, you can clearly see what Lin Xiu is holding.

“The token!?”

Seeing the token in Lin Xiu’s hand, the pupils in Chen Jing’s eyes shrank slightly.

“who are you!?”

He stared at Lin Xiu and said.

At this time, he clearly felt that Lin Xiu’s strength was only a warrior at the level of Respected warrior.

But tonight, guarding the gate were four warriors at the level of Respected warrior. How did they get in?

“Since you know about the token, do you still remember how your Chen family reached this status?”

Lin Xiu ignored Chen Jing’s words and continued to speak.

“Humph!”

“The Ye family has been destroyed, you people, don’t try to fool me with this kind of thing!”

At this moment, Chen Jing shouted with a gloomy expression.

“Kill them for me,”

At this time, with his flick of his sleeves, all the warriors of the Chen family around him attacked Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu didn’t panic when he saw this scene.

With a wave of his right hand, a large amount of flames burst out at this moment.

Charge towards the surrounding warriors!

“what!!!”

Those warriors were hit by the dark blue flames released by Lin Xiu and they began wailing and screaming.

These warriors were burned by the hellfire and soon, they were burned into black coals.

Chen Jing looked at the scene in front of him with shock in his eyes.

What kind of skills is this?!

The temperature of this flame is too terrifying.

Even he felt as if he was in a big furnace!

The rest of the Chen family’s warriors retreated subconsciously.

Looking at the row of warriors who rushed out first, all turned into coke!

This is too scary.

“Stop!”

When Chen Jing saw that they actually stepped back, his face suddenly became ugly.

When these warriors heard Chen Jing’s words, they also recovered from their fear.

Looking at Lin Xiu over there, the weapon in his hand clenched tightly.

“Boy, there are some people you can’t mess with.”

At this moment, Chen Jing’s eyes became gloomy.

At this moment, the source strength of his whole body burst out.

The surrounding ground shook slightly.

Sage warrior level.

Lin Xiu looked at Chen Jing’s movements and narrowed his eyes slightly.

Chen Jing moved his hands and suddenly the rocks on the ground shattered.

flew directly into the air.

“go!”

As Chen Jing waved his hand again, all these flying rocks charged towards Lin Xiu!

Ye Kai watched this scene and was about to make a move when he noticed a glass bead on Lin Xiu’s neck, emitting a yellow light.

Lin Xiu raised his hand and waved, all the rocks that were charging towards him stopped in the air.

how is this possible! ?

When Chen Jing saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank.

And at the next moment, these rocks, in turn, charged towards him!

At this time, Chen Jing’s reaction quickly unfolded the “Sphere”.

All the rocks charged toward him and were blocked by his ‘Sphere’.

However, the powerful impact still made Chen Jing’s body retreat a short distance.

“Damn…”

Chen Jing, who retreated to the back, his expression became extremely ugly.

“Attack!”

He looked at the warriors around him and continued to shout at this time.

“kill!”

The warriors of the Chen family, although they were frightened by the flames that Lin Xiu had just released, retreated to the back.

But when they heard Chen Jing’s words at this time, they all burst out with powerful killing intent and charged directly towards Lin Xiu!

Because the flames that Lin Xiu unleashed just now were so terrifying, they all started a ‘Sphere’ at this time.

To prevent being hit by the flames released by Lin Xiu later.

Lin Xiu watched as they charged towards them and the corners of his mouth twitched.

The ‘Silence’ skill that he just learned, he decided to test it on them!

Boom—

With the triggering of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the source strength in his body instantly transformed into a large amount of black energy.

At this moment, these dark energies swept towards the surrounding warriors!

These dark energies directly penetrated the ‘Sphere’ that they unfolded and wrapped directly around their bodies.

bang bang bang-

With a strange sound, the bodies of these warriors all burst out!
