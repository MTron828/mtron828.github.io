1449 Obtaining Coordinates

“I don’t know how to get there, but someone in the city seems to know.”

Luo Yuetian said at this time.

“I just don’t know, they…”

Zhang Tiansheng came over just now, and nobody knows if he massacred all the people in the city.

Thinking of this, Luo Huatian’s face also became ugly.

!!

“Let’s go and have a look.”

Lin Xiu seemed to know what Luo Huatian was thinking, so he spoke directly at this time.

“I’ll stay here.”

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu, hesitated for a moment, and then said to Lin Xiu.

“Why?”

Lin Xiu was taken aback, then subconsciously said.

“I want to absorb the power of this black river.”

Luo Yue looked at the water of this black river, and said seriously.

“no.”

Lin Xiu shook his head directly.

Just now he has clearly seen that the water of the Black River has a great influence on the god king.

It would be really difficult for Luo Yue to absorb the water of the Black River.

“I must try.”

Luo Yue was rarely stubborn.

“I want to help too.”

Luo Yue stared at Lin Xiu, and said seriously.

She has already made a decision, she must absorb the power of the Black River.

“However, you don’t know where the source water of the Black River is.”

This Black River water is really too dangerous.

If you’re not careful…

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu’s back felt a little chill.

If something happened to Luo Yue, he couldn’t bear it.

“I won’t let you take risks alone, but I can’t help you with anything.”

Luo Yue continued to speak out.

Lin Xiu was going to take the Flame of chaos.

That’s also a dangerous mission.

And in the current situation, there will definitely be a god king coming here again.

Now her strength is not enough.

Against the God King, there is no chance of winning at all.

The only chance to become stronger now is to absorb the energy of the Black River water.

Although this process may be very difficult, it is not without opportunities.

Because she just obtained the method to control the water of the Black River.

“Okay, be careful.”

Lin Xiu thought about it for a long time, and sighed.

At this moment, Lin Xiu approached Luo Yue’s side, and directly squeezed and exploded the attribute energy ball.

Electric attribute, dark attribute, water attribute, fire attribute, and earth attribute.

The original power of the five attributes appeared in Lin Xiu’s palm instantly.

With Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the five original attribute energies flew directly towards Luo Yue’s mouth.

Instantly integrated into Luo Yue’s body.

“Absorb all the energy in it.”

Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue.

Luo Yue was slightly taken aback, but at this moment, she quickly came to her senses.

The cultivation technique was activated and she frantically absorbed these attribute energies.

These attribute energies could already be controlled by people, so they were absorbed very quickly.

As Luo Yue absorbed the energy of these attributes, she also gained the power of the dark attribute.

With the power of this dark attribute integrated into her body. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

It will also help her to absorb the power of the Black River.

At this time, the three returned to Tianbei City.

Taking a closer look, those people in the city did not die.

This made Luo Huatian heave a sigh of relief.

But today they had to hurry up and notify these people to evacuate.

There would probably be powerful god king-level warriors coming from the dark planet.

At this time, Luo Huatian took Lin Xiu and Luo Yue to find someone who knew the location of the Flame of chaos.

“Master Bai!”

Soon, with Luo Huatian leading, an old man with a long white beard was found in a dilapidated room.

“Oh? Luo Huatian, you’re here.”

The old man looked at Luo Huatian’s figure, and suddenly showed surprise.

“I heard that you led people to kill all those hateful guys.”

“They killed them.”

At this moment, Luo Huatian helplessly spread his hands.

At this time, the man Luo Huatian called Master Bai looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

“My sister, and my brother-in-law.”

When Luo Yue heard Luo Huatian addressed Lin Xiu as his brother-in-law, her face seemed to be a little shy, but it passed away quickly, and she still looked cold.

Master Bai nodded, stroked his beard and smiled.

“If you have anything to say, just speak.”

He knew that Luo Huatian must have something to bring up, so he said it straightforwardly at this time.

“We want to know where the Flame of Chaos is.”

“You’re looking for the Flame of chaos?”

Hearing Luo Huatian’s words, Master Bai was startled.

“Um.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

“No, that kind of flame is really terrifying.”

“As soon as you touch it, you will lose your soul.”

Master Bai looked cautious.

He seemed to have thought of something, with a look of fear on his face.

“I know, I want to try it.”

Lin Xiu looked at him and said seriously.

Master Bai looked at Lin Xiu, and clearly felt the firm look in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

He must go!

“Are you sure you really want to go?”

At this time, Master Bai still spoke again and again.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu nodded.

“Well, this is the path you chose.”

Master Bai sighed.

At this time, he tapped his finger, and a projection appeared next to it.

Soon, the coordinates of the Chaos Realm were displayed.

Lin Xiu has also studied this kind of cosmic coordinates, and it is easy to understand at this time.

“You have teleported to the Chaos Realm. Go east and you will encounter the Flame of Chaos.”

“The intensity of this kind of flame is beyond your imagination. I advise you to give up this idea as soon as possible.”

“Besides, there is no space teleportation device here, and the entire dark planet is blocked by those damned guys…”

When Bai Ye said this, he felt a little resentful.

So many people on the Dark Planet were massacred, and now even the entire planet is sealed off, making it impossible to even break through the space.

It’s simply not giving them any chance to survive!

“Take care, I’m leaving first.”

Lin Xiu stood in front of Luo Yue and stroked Luo Yue’s soft hair.

Smiled softly.

“I’ll wait for your return.”

Luo Yue also said seriously.

At the next moment, with Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the Spatial Magic Cube instantly appeared beside Lin Xiu!

“This is…”

When Master Bai watched this scene, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

Following Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the Spatial Magic Cube started to rotate rapidly.

Soon, a space crack appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s eyes and Luo Yue’s looked at each other for the last time, and the expression in their eyes also became firm.

Chaos Realm, here I come!

Taking a deep breath, without any hesitation, Lin Xiu walked in directly!
