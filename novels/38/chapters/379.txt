Chapter 380: Top of the Lightning Region

“What’s that?” Lin Xiu’s eyebrows were in knots when he heard the ear-piercing squeal.

The squeal was sharp as if it could pierce through his eardrum, causing Lin Xiu’s brain to shake which was extremely uncomfortable.

“That is the cry of the Lightning Birds.” Nan Zhengjun who was leading the way answered Lin Xiu.

Lightning Birds?

Lin Xiu was still looking around the mountain peaks and saw that there were lightning appearing one after another continuously.

He could also see a few shadows that were flying around in the air.

Were those the Lightning Birds that were mentioned…

For some reason, Lin Xiu felt a sense of excitement. He wanted to fight those Lightning Birds.

While they were on their way there, Lin Xiu saw two other people walking towards them.

“Yo, are you headed for the Lightning Region? With the gloating voice that came from them, Lin Xiu was able to see Zhang Liangqian who was in front of him.

Next to him was a middle-aged man who was wearing a teacher’s uniform.

This was the teacher of the second-year students.

“That’s right. I’m just wondering if you got your arm treated.”

Lin Xiu looked into Zhang Liangqian’s eyes and wasn’t even angry about what he said. Instead, he smiled and asked Zhan Liangqian about his arm.

“You…”

When he heard Lin Xiu’s reply, Zhang Liangqian got angry again. In fact, he went for a check-up on his arm and found out that there were multiple fracture lines on his bones.

From this, he was well aware of how powerful Lin Xiu was. His arm was still hurting until now whenever he tried to use it since it hasn’t fully recovered.

“Zhengjun, long time no see.” The middle-aged teacher who was standing next to Zhang Qianliang greeted Nan Zhengjun.

“It’s true that we haven’t met for some time. You’re already the teacher of the second-year students.” Nan Zhengjun nodded his head and smiled.

Lin Xiu, on the other hand, noticed that there was something peculiar about the way they were talking to each other. It sounded as if they were giving tit for tat.

There must be a story here between the both of them!

“I heard that you’re teaching the tenth class? Good luck then!” The middle-aged teacher patted onto Nan Zhengjun’s shoulder as they started walking away.

“I hope you come back alive.” Zhang Liangqian looked at Lin Xiu and sneered before leaving with his teacher.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he stared at the pair that was leaving.

“Teacher Nan, it looks like you have some stories with him.”

“It’s true but those are things in the past.” Nan Zhengjun smiled and didn’t say anything else.

“They should be here to clear Zhang Liangqian’s punishment. We should hurry as well. There isn’t much time left.”

Nan Zhengjun started walking as soon as he finished his sentence.

With Nan Zhengjun’s guidance, Lin Xiu soon arrived at the foot of the mountain that was known as the ‘Lightning Region’.

Right there, he could clearly see that there were a few guards that were standing and there was also a huge electric gate set up there.

When the guards saw Lin Xiu walking towards them, all of them gave a peculiar stare.

Nan Zhengjun walked towards the guards and greeted the guards. After talking to them for a while, he started typing things into the computer next to them.

“Lin Xiu, you can go with them now.” When Nan Zhengjun was done, he called Lin Xiu who was sitting at the back.

Lin Xiu eyes landed on the monitor and saw his name clearly written on it along with;

‘[Enclosed]: Three days.’

He would be on top of his mountain for three days… alone?

Lin Xiu looked towards the huge mountain top and thought to himself.

“Be careful by yourself and come back safe.” Nan Zhengjun patted Lin Xiu’s shoulders and said to him earnestly.

“Alright.” Lin Xiu nodded and walked towards the huge electric gate.

“Take off your suit and your gloves.” The guards were scanning Lin Xiu with a machine when they told him to remove his clothing.

Lin Xiu was shocked when he heard the instructions. He has never heard of it being done this way which was why he only wore a simple combat suit that day.

The gloves that he had on were the pair of ‘Red Moon’ that he won from a lottery previously,

“Just do as he said.” Nan Zhengjun nodded at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu had no other choice. He slowly removed his combat suit followed by the pair of gloves.

The guards placed his combat suit and gloves into the box and placed them on the other side.

“Let’s go!” One of the guards called out to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded his head and walked towards the electric gate.

“Be careful!” Nan Zhengjun continued to exhort.

Lin Xiu felt helpless as he wasn’t even allowed to wear his combat suit. It was obvious that this was a heavy punishment.

If he wasn’t allowed to wear his combat suit, it would be extremely dangerous if he got attacked by one of the Lightning Birds up there.

The way to the mountaintop was winding. Lin Xiu was not aware of how long it had been but he already felt dizzy when he got to the top.

“Quick, bring him down!” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

As Lin Xiu stepped onto the mountain top, he heard a loud cry.

When he took a closer look, he saw two guards, who wore the customized uniform of the guards in the Sacred Region Academy, carrying a man in a stretcher. Most of his skin was toasted and his clothes were burnt as well.

Seeing how they were in a hurry, Lin Xiu quickly made way for them.

“What happened?” As they went down the mountain, Lin Xiu asked the guard who brought him up to the top of the mountain.

“He was struck by lightning.” The guards gave him a short answer.

“He was punished as well?” Lin Xiu was stunned but continued asking another question.

“Umm, if I remember correctly, he stole a skill card from the academy. His punishment is to be locked up here for a week. Today is only his second day and he has already turned out this way.” The guards shook his head as he replied to Lin Xiu.

“If he is already in this state, would his punishment be over after he recovers?”

“No way. He still has to finish the number of days that he is punished. He will come back here after his recovery until he has completed all 7 days.” The guard explained it to Lin Xiu as he shook his head.

Lin Xiu felt the chills running down his spine after hearing the guard explain about the punishment. The punish here at the Sacred Region Academy is much tougher than he thinks.

“Alright, you’re up.” Lin Xiu looked to the front and saw another huge door. There were also a few other guards standing in front of it.

As Lin Xiu took a good look at the area behind it, there was still such a spacious ground on top of this mountain.
