“Thank you but I won’t be needing it.”

Lin Xiu chuckled as he told her.

The strengthening fluid is definitely something good but the withdrawal effect of it would mean that it would be more difficult for cultivation for the next few months. It would not be as strong as the forbidden pills.

Plus, the amount of strength that it would increase wouldn’t be as much as the forbidden pills. These types of things were widely available within the black market.

This is because they would have to include some very rare ingredient in these pills.

“Are you sure?”

Luo Yan laughed as she asked.

She was not getting more and more curious about Lin Xiu. Those from the Sky Academy were much stronger than he is. How could he be so confident about fighting them?

“Even if you can defeat them, what about your teammates? All three of them are rank 7 warriors. Do you think that you and that girl alone would be able to fight all 5 of them?” Luo Yan continued asking.

“Plus, I think Luo Yue mentioned that she would only be your girlfriend if you win this match?”

Luo Yan raised her eyebrows and she was looking for some drama.

“You eavesdropped on us?!”

When Lin Xiu heard what Luo Yan heard, his eyes widened in shock.

“Ummm…” Luo Yan looked around as if nothing had happened and continued saying, “The weather looks good again…”

“How could you see the weather from here…2”

Lin Xiu’s head was filled with questions now.

“Forget it. Since you don’t want it, I would like to see if you would win this match.”

Luo Yan took back the fluid and she smiled at Lin Xiu.

“If you want to be the son-in-law of the Luo family, it would not be possible if you don’t have the abilities.”

“Good luck, buddy.”

Luo Yan blew him a kiss before disappearing into thin air.

After making sure that Luo Yan had left the room, Lin Xiu laid on his bed like a huge starfish.

“Tm so tired.”

Lin Xiu was indeed exhausted from the battle from before.

As he recalled what Luo Yan said, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but gave a bitter smile. Luo Yan and her elder sister had completely different personalities. If it wasn’t because the both of them looked really alike, Lin Xiu wouldn’t have known that Luo Yan was Luo Yue’s elder sister.

Their personality was total to the extreme.

“Let’s just cultivate now…”

After lying down for a while, Lin Xiu immediately sat up and took out the odd crystals that he had prepared from earlier.

Lin Xiu placed the off crystal onto the palm and activated his ‘cultivation technique’. He quickly absorbed the energy from the odd crystals and he could also absorb the tiny specks of universal energy that were in space.

Time passed by slowly and when Lin XIu opened his eyes, he immediately felt refreshed.

As he took a closer look, the time now was 9:30 at night.

“About time…”

Lin Xiu stretched his body and moved a little to warm up his body. Then, he picked up the Dark Edge and walked towards the audience seat.

It was already late at night but it was still bright outside.

As he had already absorbed a huge amount of energy from the odd crystals, Lin Xiu’s body had been completely replenished as well and was at its best condition.

“You’re here already?”

‘When Lin Xiu saw Huang Zhen and Qian Yao, he was surprised.

“En. We just got here.” They smiled and said.

Lin Xiu took a look at their wounds and noticed that they were mostly healed. There were some scars visible but the rest of them were almost gone.

But, it shouldn’t be much of a problem.

“What’s our strategy for the match?”

Ouyang Hang looked at Baili Haoling who was completely absorbed into a piece of paper that she was holding onto.

“AHHHHHH….I CAN’T THINK OF ANYTHING.”

Then, she tore the paper into pieces.

“Just do as you feel.”

Baili Haoling did not know what else she could say.

“As we like?”

Qian Yao and the rest were confused.

“Those from the Sky Academy are at least rank 8 warriors. There’s too much difference between both the teams. There’s no strategy that would be able to make up for it.”

Baili Haoling told the truth.

After hearing what she said, Qian Yao and Huang Zhen felt a little offended but they still nodded their heads in agreement.

It’s true. Both of them were rank 7 warriors but those from the Sky Academy were rank 8 warriors. There was nothing much that they could do.

The difference between rank 7 and rank 8 was wide.

“Be careful. Just don’t get killed.” Baili Haoling said in a serious tone.

Ouyang Hang’s face turned solemn as well.

He had watched the semifinals earlier. Those from the Sky Academy were merciless. They killed every single one of their opponents and there was no space for their opposite team to defend themselves.

‘They were too strong.

“If there’s nothing that you could do, just jump off the stage. Don’t be stubborn.”

Lin Xiu told them the same thing as well.

“alright.”

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao wanted to say something else but after thinking about it, they thought that it was best to just agree.

‘They were well aware that sacrificing their lives here weren’t some heroic moves.

“Alright! Ladies and gentlemen as well as those who have joined us online, this is the finals for the World’s Warrior Competition of the Huaxia region. We are about to begin shortly!”

“Let’s welcome our champion school, one of the contestants of the International Warrior Competition Finals!”

‘The announcer was on his flying gadget once again and was moving around in the air as he made the announcement.

The speakers around allowed his voice to be heard by each and every audience that were there.

After hearing what he said, the audience cheered with excitement.

Some were cheering for the Sky Academy while others were screaming for the Sacred Region Academy.

This was because from the past matches, these teams have done the best. In each of their matches, they have defeated their opponents without any difficulties.

“Although the Sacred Region Academy isn’t some champion team, I’m sure that they’ll be the champion tonight.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“I checked it already. Those from the Sky Academy are all rank warriors. They’re dead!”

“Not necessary. The girl from the Sacred Region Academy and the dude knows how to control source field. They might be rank 9 warriors!”

All around the hall, the audience were having a heated discussion about the match tonight.

It was obvious that the audience were excited for the finals.

“Alright, let’s welcome the Sacred Region Academy!”

As the announcer shouted, Lin Xiu looked at his teammates before jumping onto the stage.

“The Sacred Region Academy has been one of the brightest teams from their region. They have defeated all the other schools in their area and have put up an incredible fight in the elementaries round as well. Those who support them, please vote for them!”

“Sacred Region Academy!”

“Sacred Region Academy!”

The audience started cheering out loud..
