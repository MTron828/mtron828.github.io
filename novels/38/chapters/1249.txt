1250 Engulfing Success

As Lin Xiu bit down, the black sphere instantly had a bite mark!

Gulu——

The bitten piece entered Lin Xiu’s mouth and it felt like jelly.

And it’s very slippery.

In the next moment, it was directly in Lin Xiu’s mouth.

Just swallowed it like this?

Lin Xiu said to himself in surprise.

“It seems… there is no smell…”

Lin Xiu smacked his mouth, then looked at the remaining black ball.

Without doing anything, Lin Xiu continued to open his mouth wide and bit down on the remaining black ball.

Soon, the black ball were swallowed by Lin Xiu.

“It’s a bit like eating jelly…”

After eating everything, Lin Xiu burped.

He didn’t feel anything.

“What effect does this have?”

After carefully feeling his body, Lin Xiu still didn’t feel any signs, so he couldn’t help but let out a depressed voice.

This thing is obviously not an ordinary thing and he could feel that it contains extremely strong energy.

But why after swallowing, it seems that there is no change in his body?

Just when Lin Xiu felt a little helpless, a cold feeling rose from the bottom of his heart instantly.

Ok? I have a reaction?

Lin Xiu felt the coldness and immediately became nervous.

After all, he swallowed something he didn’t know what it was just now, he wasn’t sure if there would be a problem.

And at this moment, Xiao Bai who was standing by the window seemed to see something and made a loud and clear sound towards Lin Xiu.

“What’s wrong?”

Hearing Xiaobai’s cry, Lin Xiu said in confusion.

In the next moment, Lin Xiu found that there was a faint black energy floating around his body.

What is this!?

Looking at these smoky black energies, Lin Xiu was surprised.

Soon, Lin Xiu could clearly see these black energies surging everywhere in his body.

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide and looked at the black energy pouring out of his body, his eyes were full of shock.

How come this kind of thing keeps coming out of my body!?

What made Lin Xiu feel even more horrifying was that the black energy coming out of his body covered his entire body.

The sight in front of him instantly became dim.

That cold feeling continued to hit and spread throughout the whole body.

“Damn!”

At this time, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but swear and his body kept struggling, trying to break free from the dark power emanating from it.

But what he didn’t expect was that this dark energy was so weird that he couldn’t break free at all.

The cold feeling became more and more strange and it seemed to come with a special feeling.

Very depressing.

Lin Xiu felt that he was in some kind of strange world now.

Everything here is dark.

There was no one, no sound and no light.

Lin Xiu felt dizzy, as if he was constantly drifting in this dark world.

His eyes were distracted and he seemed to have lost his mind.

“Unknown energy has been detected, beginning to engulf…”

But at this moment, a cold electronically synthesized sound came from his mind.

Lin Xiu, whose eyes were starting to lose sight, regained his spirit at this moment.

As if his whole body was jolted, Lin Xiu woke up instantly.

Oh right, he swallowed that black ball just now…

Thinking of the state just now, Lin Xiu couldn’t help breaking into a cold sweat.

These dark energies were really weird. Just now, it seemed that he was about to put myself in a situation where he lost any ability to think.

But fortunately, there was a systematic ‘Engulf’ skill.

Although the body is still surrounded by the dark energy emanating from it, everything in front of him was pitch black.

But Lin Xiu could no longer feel any other abnormalities.

...

As long as the ‘Engulf’ skill was used, all these dark energies can be swallowed up.

After entering the system interface in his mind, Lin Xiu could clearly see that the progress of the skill ‘Engulf’ had reached 1.2%.

But when it reached 1.2%, Lin Xiu found that the progress of the ‘Engulf’ skill became extremely slow.

After some time, Lin Xiu realized that the progress had increased by 0.1%.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu was speechless.

This engulfing speed is too slow…

However, Lin Xiu was not in a hurry. He sat cross-legged on the ground at this moment, ignoring the black energy completely covering his body.

Time passed minute by minute and I don’t know how long it had passed. Lin Xiu heard a crisp sound of ‘ding’ coming from his mind.

“The engulfing is complete!”

“‘Engulf’ skill upgrade!”

What followed was the system’s notification sound.

...

When he opened his eyes, he could clearly see the scene in his room. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Those black substances that surrounded his body and blocked his vision have completely disappeared!

It seems that it has been completely swallowed by the system’s ‘Engulf’ skill.

At this time, Lin Xiu quickly entered the system panel to see how much the experience progress bar had increased.

Generally speaking, after devouring so much energy matter, the experience progress bar will definitely increase.

“what?”

But when Lin Xiu looked at his experience progress bar, he was stunned.

Because his experience progress bar was still the same as before, about 20% and it hasn’t increased at all!

“Damn it!”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but swear.

This black ball obviously contained such a powerful energy, the system’s ‘Engulf’ skill took so long to absorb it completely.

But now it has not risen!

Not at all!

Then what is the effect of swallowing this black ball?

“Rollie, do you know what this thing is for?”

After returning to reality from the system interface in his mind, Lin Xiu spoke to Rollie who was still standing on his shoulder.

“Gu gu!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Rollie made a sound.

It seemed that it was very excited, but Lin Xiu couldn’t understand what it meant at all.

“I forgot that you can’t speak human language.”

Lin Xiu smacked himself on the head and said a little dumbfounded.

Squeak——

At this moment, the door of his room was opened.

“Eh? Lin Xiu, are you awake?”

It was Baili Haoling who pushed the door open.

She looked at Lin Xiu now and seemed to be surprised.

“Could it be that I fell asleep for a long time?”

Lin Xiu was startled when he heard Baili Haoling’s words and subconsciously said.
