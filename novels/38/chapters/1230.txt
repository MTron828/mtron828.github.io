1231 The Explosion of Baili Haoling (Part 1)

At this moment, Lin Xiu mobilized all the energy in his body and punched out again!

This punch is ‘Destroy the Sky’.

Boom——

With an incomparably loud sound, the ‘Sphere’ exploded immediately!

Poof——

Sha Li opened his eyes wide at this time, because of the backlash brought about by the burst of the ‘Sphere’, he immediately spit out a mouthful of blood.

Just when Lin Xiu wanted to continue punching his body, the black energy substances on his body burst out again.

Instantly wrapped Lin Xiu’s fist.

what is this!?

Looking at these black energy substances, Lin Xiu frowned.

Because he now clearly discovered that these black substances seemed to wrap around his hands.

And it made it impossible for him to use his strength normally!

Just as Lin Xiu was about to pull out these black energy clusters with all his strength, he found that more black energy covered them.

At this time, Sha Li’s face was ferocious. The black energy that should have covered his body all hit Lin Xiu’s body.

And his body kept falling at this moment.

“Go… to hell…”

Sha Li, who was falling, let out a roar at this moment.

At this moment, his eyes turned completely black.

Cracks seemed to appear in the whole body and he swelled up gradually.

boom–

With a loud sound, his body exploded directly.

And after it exploded, what came out was not his flesh and blood, but a large amount of black energy substances.

These black energy substances rushed toward Lin Xiu’s body in an instant.

Lin Xiu’s body was completely covered!

what is this!?

Seeing the black energy entwined around his body, Lin Xiu’s expression changed drastically.

Just now there was a mass of black energy wrapped around his fist and he couldn’t break free and now it has wrapped around his whole body.

And looking carefully at this time, Lin Xiu can clearly feel that these black energies are constantly invading his body!

“Lin Xiu!”

Baili Haoling down there looked at the scene in the sky and couldn’t help shouting.

Now Lin Xiu’s situation looks very strange, his whole body is wrapped by those black energies.

Obviously in a very unfavorable state.

“Ignore me!”

Lin Xiu frowned and mobilized all the energy in his body.

In this state, there is no good solution at all.

He could only resist these black energy substances from invading his body.

And Lin Xiu has not yet felt what effect these black energies will have on him.

The unknown is the scariest thing.

Kala Kala——

At the same time, a large number of cracks began to appear on the frozen Sha Qiang.

Useless!?

At this time, Baili Haoling looked at the scene in front of her and the pupils in her eyes shrank involuntarily.

But fortunately, because Sha Qiang was sealed in ice just now, the power of the gravel hands transformed by his source strength has also weakened.

Baili Haoling struggled and got out with a little effort.

Before Sha Qiang broke free from the frozen state, she held the two swords and attacked the ice sculpture!

“Go to hell!”

At this moment, the Baili Haoling swords seemed to be stained with blood, which was extremely strange.

Her strength also reached its peak at this time.

Boom——

As she slashed with her two swords, the entire ice sculpture suddenly cracked.

Her two swords directly slashed at Sha Qiang’s body!

The sword in the right hand was chopped at Sha Qiang’s neck and the sword in the left hand was chopped at Sha Qiang’s chest.

But what made Baili Haoling feel unbelievable was that neither of these two swords could cut off Sha Qiang directly.

The two sharp blades directly cut into his skin a little and appeared as if they were stuck.

“Get lost!!!”

At this time, Sha Qiang’s face became extremely ugly. With a roar, his body burst out with extremely strong strength.

This incomparably terrifying power directly sent Baili Haoling flying!

“Humph!”

At this time, Sha Qiang looked at the two blood-red long swords on his body with a gloomy expression.

With a little force, the two long swords were pulled out and thrown on the ground.

“I have gone through special training. With this level of attack, you think it can kill me huh.”

Sha Qiang looked at Baili Haoling and said coldly.

And at this time, the wound that Baili Haoling caused was also recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Sha Qiang waved his right hand directly and a large number of ice cones that fell from the sky were directly blocked by his strength.

Xiaobai was still trying to attack Sha Qiang in the sky, but Sha Qiang easily blocked its attack.

After all, Xiaobai’s current strength has not yet reached the level of a beast god and there is no way to compare with a god warrior.

Sha Qiang glanced at Lin Xiu in the sky and when he saw that Lin Xiu was surrounded by those black energies, the pupils in Sha Qiang’s eyes shrank slightly.

The corner of his mouth curled up in a strange arc: “It seems that Sha Li can transform into a new body again.”

While he was mumbling to himself, he moved his right hand and a large amount of energy around him turned into gravel and began to gather towards his palm.

“go!”

Soon, a huge sharp spiral formed and with a wave of Sha Qiang’s right hand, it directly charged toward Baili Haoling! nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Baili Haoling, who was sent flying out just now, saw this scene before she had time to stabilize her body.

The expression on her face suddenly changed drastically.

Her body instinctively wanted to dodge, but she couldn’t dodge completely!

At this moment, the spiral composed of gravel-like source strength directly penetrated Baili Haoling’s shoulder.

In an instant, it went through.

Fresh blood kept flowing out.

“Too bad, that was close.”

Sha Qiang looked at this scene and suddenly said with pity.

“However, this time, I won’t let you go.”

While talking, Sha Qiang walked towards Baili Haoling.

Xiao Bai charged down from the sky, as if trying to stop Sha Qiang.

But it was slapped violently by Sha Qiang’s right hand, sending its body flying!

Sha Qiang continued to walk in the direction of Baili Haoling and the gravel-like source strength continued to gather.

“Hu…hu…”

At this time, Baili Haoling lowered her head and covered her wound with her right hand and seemed as if she was panting.

It was hot, she felt her whole body become extremely hot.

It’s as if, the blood in the body has become boiling at this moment!!!
