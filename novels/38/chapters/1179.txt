1180 Killing and Snatching

When the men heard what Teng Yuan said, all of them had an awful look on their faces.

“Kill them…” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Teng Yuan ordered with a hideous expression on his face.

However, before he could finish, Teng Yuan’s pupil narrowed as he could suddenly feel something coming at him.

!!

“Who is it?!”

He turned around and threw his axe.

Then, there was a crescent shaped energy that appeared and it travelled in a straight line.

The huge trees were instantly chopped off within a blink of an eye.

Boom – –

When all the huge trees fell, there was a man that appeared.

It was Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu just came across this area and witnessed the whole incident.

“I was just passing by. You can go on.”

Lin Xiu took a look at them before leaving.

“Passing by?”

Teng Yuan chuckled when he heard what Lin Xiu said.

“Brother, run!”

The warriors, who were being surrounded by Teng Yuan’s men, screamed at Lin Xiu to warn him.

“Those who step foot in Wu Hei Mountain would not be allowed to leave!”

Teng Yuan sneered. He looked at his men and got them to stop Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as well when he saw what happened.

These warriors were indeed powerful.

It was explainable why all the beasts on the mountain fled. It was because of the fight that was happening here.

These beast could feel danger coming from these men.

However, Lin Xiu didn’t think that after a peaceful journey for the past two days, he would be stopped by these men when he was about to arrive at Manhuang City.

“What do you want?”

Lin Xiu glanced at the warriors.

“What do we want?”

“To kill and to take what’s yours.”

The warriors laughed as they answered Lin Xiu without any hesitation.

When they saw the combat suit that Lin Xiu was wearing, their eyes lit up with excitement.

They could tell that Lin Xiu’s combat suit was a priceless treasure.

“Quick! Get rid of him.”

Lin Xiu gave his commands.

For him, Lin Xiu was merely a normal warrior. Lin Xiu was not worth his attention.

“Hmm?”

When Lin Xiu heard what he said, he frowned.

Then, all the warriors started attacking Lin Xiu!

They held onto the weapons in their hands, ready to kill Lin Xiu!

Clang clang clang – –

Just when they were about to attack Lin Xiu with the weapon in his hands, there was a cold ray that flashed across their eyes.

They could feel a strong impact that came from the weapons in their hands and it was so strong that they had to take a few steps back.

What on earth was happening?!

They felt as if their weapons were about to be thrown onto the ground!

As they took a few steps backwards, they looked up and noticed that there was a long spear that appeared in Lin Xiu’s hands.

Where did that come from?!

When they saw the weapon in Lin Xiu’s hands, they were all surprised.

This was because they were sure that Lin Xiu had no weapons earlier!

“What’s happening?”

Teng Yuan frowned as well.

“Kill him!”

The warriors quickly calmed down. Then, they roared as they rushed toward Lin Xiu with their weapons!

“Hmph!”

Lin XIu sneered when he saw the men coming at him.

Then, he started moving the long spear in his hands.

Lin Xiu’s speed was quick and with the strong energy that he had, the spear was being moved so quickly that the others couldn’t even see the spear.

All of the warriors who wanted to attack him were surprised.

It was followed by the sound of metals colliding with each other and soon, the warriors noticed that they no longer had their weapons with them!

At this moment, they quickly released their ‘sphere’s in order to protect themselves.

Boom boom boom – –

Just as they released their ‘sphere’s, Lin Xiu had already rushed forward!

With Lin Xiu’s attack, all of their ‘sphere’s were crushed into pieces instantly!

Pfft – –

As their sphere’s were broken, they spat out blood from their mouths.

[Profound Intent – Torrential Storm of Rose Flower!]

Lin Xiu did not give them the chance to breathe and continued attacking with his long spear.

Without the protection of the ‘sphere’, none of them could stop Lin Xiu’s attack.

Soon, most of the arrogant warriors had multiple bloody holes that appeared all over their bodies after being pierced by the long sphere.

Their eyes widened in shock as they fell onto the ground.

They would have never believed till the moment that they died that they were defeated so quickly.

Teng Yuan had a change of expression on his face as well.

“Initially, I didn’t want to be involved in this but you insisted on wanting to take my life…”

Lin Xiu stared at Teng Yuan with a smile that slowly appeared on his face.

These men were nothing to Lin Xiu.

Other than Teng Yuan who seemed to be more powerful, Lin Xiu believed that he could easily killed the rest of them.

“Kill him!”

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, Teng Yuan was enraged and he screamed at his men.

The remaining warriors then headed straight for Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu could clearly sense that their warriors were mostly warrior gods.

However, he did not feel threatened by them.

Lin Xiu gathered his thoughts and transferred the energy on his left arm. Then, he slowly moved it in the air.

Soon, there were two divine mark that appeared in the air.

The power divine mark! The wine divine mark!

Both the divine mark appeared and went straight onto Lin Xiu’s body.

With the help of the divine mark, Lin Xiu’s speed and strength grew tremendously.

The warriors were just inches away from Lin Xiu.

Divine spear art!

Lin Xiu looked at the warriors who were getting closer to him and swung the long spear in his hand.

Lin Xiu was a lone man fighting eight other warrior gods but he didn’t seem to be the one on the losing side. In fact, it was the other warriors that seemed frightened.

Lin Xiu’s skills were too vigorous and he was too quick. They were already being defeated by Lin Xiu without even trying.

Teng Yuan got even more furious when he saw what happened.

He thought that this brat was just a normal kid but he didn’t think that Lin Xiu could be someone so powerful.

This young man seemed to be someone strong.

Damn it…

Teng Yuan grabbed onto his axe and his eyes were filled with unlimited murderous intentions.
