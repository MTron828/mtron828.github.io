Chapter 1135 - 1135 Twilight of the Gods

1135 Twilight of the Gods

With the collapse, the broken arms and limbs of those warriors just now flew out!

All… are dead!

Wang Qiang looked at this scene with his eyes full of disbelief.

This is too scary.

!!

“Are you alright?”

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s figure also slowly flew down from the sky.

“Master!”

Looking at Lin Xiu’s arrival, Wang Qiang said in surprise.

“They… seem to have all been exploded to death.”

Lin Xiu stood on the ground, and Wang Qiang spoke to him.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

He had already arranged a matrix here previously.

As long as these warriors were sent over, they would be trapped like turtles in an urn and were doomed.

However, what made Lin Xiu feel a little regretful was that, according to the experience-gaining system prompts coming from his mind, the strength of these warriors was not strong.

It seems that the people from the Bai family were still quite smart, and they didn’t directly let the powerful warriors come over.

Instead, they let these warriors be cannon fodder.

“The people of the Bai family should be preparing to deal with us now, be careful.”

Lin Xiu spoke to Wang Qiang.

“Yes!”

Wang Qiang nodded.

Lin Xiu patted Wang Qiang on the shoulder and walked to the other side.

The teleportation array has now been destroyed due to the explosion of the matrix.

The people of the Bai family can no longer come from the teleportation formation.

When he walked to the other side, Lin Xiu could clearly see where Wu Hao was.

Wu Hao is directing those engineers to carry out construction.

With the high-tech construction of the Wu Group, those areas that were razed to the ground by Lin Xiu’s powerful skills had many buildings built.

And buildings that enable energy barriers were also under construction.

“Brother Lin, you’re here?”

Wu Hao, who was instructing the architects, saw Lin Xiu’s arrival and said in surprise.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded.

“How is the progress here?”

“It’s almost done, I brought a lot of engineers here this time.”

Wu Hao said with a smile.

“Thanks a lot.”

Lin Xiu patted Wu Hao on the shoulder.

“Don’t say that.”

Wu Hao shook his head and said.

“By the way, do you know where there are the most Beast Saint-level evolved beasts?”

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something, and said aloud.

“Twilight of the Gods…”

Wu Hao subconsciously blurted out his debut at this time.

“Twilight of the Gods?”

Lin Xiu was startled when he heard Wu Hao’s words.

Ever since he came to Namir planet, he hadn’t heard of it.

“Well, this is the most dangerous place on Namir planet.”

“It is said that there were warriors of the God warrior level fighting there.”

Wu Hao said this with a cautious look on his face.

“Tell me the location, I’m going.”

Lin Xiu didn’t have the slightest fear and said directly. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He knew that on this Namir planet, there were special rules and powers, and it was impossible for a warrior of the God warrior level to appear here.

Below the god warrior level, Lin Xiu really has nothing to fear.

“Brother Lin, are you going to…”

Wu Hao was slightly startled, and then said subconsciously.

“I’m going over there to hunt some evolved beasts.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

The power he owns was too weak, he was going to scavenge a wave of Beast Saint-level odd crystals to increase the power of all his subordinates.

“Be careful.”

Wu Hao nodded, then told Lin Xiu the location.

After getting the information, Lin Xiu heard a huge sound coming from the sky.

When he looked up, he could see the artificial angel, which had already flown over.

Boom—

At this time, her body slowly descended from the sky.

The whole ground shook.

“Next, can you help me guard this place.”

Lin Xiu looked at the artificial angel who appeared in front of him and said aloud.

At this moment, the artificial angel assumed a defensive posture, it was as if she had turned into a statue.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and flew straight into the sky.

According to the direction given by Wu Hao, Lin Xiu went to the so-called ‘Twilight of the Gods’.

“Damn!”

At this time, on the other side, among the Bai family in the holy city, Bai Qi’s face became extremely ugly.

“This kid had set up an ambush at the other end of the teleportation array, and all the warriors who went there were killed.”

Elder Bai Lin said to Bai Qi at this time.

“What a bunch of trash.”

Bai Qi’s face became extremely ugly.

The holy water was taken away, and many warriors who went there died.

For the Bai family, this is a great shame.

“How long will it take to build a teleportation array?”

Bai Qi took a deep breath at this time, after calming himself down, he looked at the people around him and said aloud.

Those who are here now are all core members of the Bai family.

“The teleportation array on the other side of Divine Domain was destroyed. Now we can only fix the teleportation array leading to Tianxing City, and then attack Divine Domain City through it.”

One of the old men came out at this time, and said respectfully to Bai Qi.

To use the teleportation array, the teleportation array needs to exist on both sides at the same time.

And the teleportation array of the Divine Domain, obviously, has all been destroyed.

“Build it as soon as possible.”

Bai Qi said coldly at this time.

“Should be done in a day and a half.”

The old man nodded.

“And over there in Baidi City, hurry up and kill those people for me.”

Bai Qi said with a gloomy expression.

The strength of Baidi City was equivalent to the existence of a second Bai family. He didn’t expect it to be captured.

The Ye family… a family that was destroyed by them in the past and they actually wants to make a comeback – this was simply a joke!

“Yes!”

When they heard Bai Qi’s words, everyone said respectfully.

At the same time, Lin Xiu on the other side had already reached the so-called Twilight of the gods.

Lin Xiu, who was flying at an extremely fast speed in the air, saw the area in front of him, and his eyes were full of surprise.

The sky in front of him looked bizarre, and a piercing cold breeze came over.

The expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly.

clap clap-

And in the next moment, a gust of wind rushed over, causing Lin Xiu’s complexion to change slightly.

Whoosh whoosh—

Before Lin Xiu could react again, he felt wind blades coming from the front.

These wind blades made a sound like cutting through the air, so Lin Xiu had no choice but to fly directly to the ground.

In the air, it is difficult to dodge.
