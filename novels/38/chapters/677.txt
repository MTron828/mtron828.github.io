Lin Xiu sneered, and with the force of his hands, he directly broke the combat knife that he was holding with his hands into two halves!

How is this possible!

When the two warriors saw this scene, their eyes widened with incredible expressions.

But it was too late for them to react. Lin Xiu held the broken blade in both hands and slashed towards their necks with his backhand!

Pff—

As their throats were cut, blood splattered all over the ground in an instant.

“Humph!”

Seeing that the others were about to attack, Lin Xiu snorted coldly. With a few punches, he sent all of them flying!

Bang bang bang-

With a dull sound, the bodies of those who flew out hit the tree trunks heavily.

There were a lot of barbs on this trunk, like it was covered with sharp awls. When those people hit these trunks, a lot of blood sputtered out.

In a short moment, all these people were killed by Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu turned his eyes to the other side at this time.

When the two men over there saw Lin Xiu look over, their bodies trembled, and the hands that had grabbed Liu Yanran were released at the same time.

Their legs almost didn’t have the strength anymore.

“No…don’t kill me…”

Their faces were full of horror.

Lin Xiu instantly killed the people that were terrifying to them just now so he was definitely a more terrifying existence.

“Get lost.”

Lin Xiu witnessed what just happened, and looked at these two men full of disgust.

“Okay, okay, let’s go, let’s go…”

When the two men heard Lin Xiu’s words, they quickly left.

The woman named Liu Yanran watched Lin Xiu come over at this moment, and tears flashed in her eyes.

She seemed so helpless as if Lin Xiu was about to do something nasty to her.

“Where is the nearest city here?”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

This woman originally thought that Lin Xiu wanted to do something to her, but when she was about to bite her tongue and commit suicide, she couldn’t help but be

stunned when she heard Lin Xiu’s words.

“Don’t worry, I’m not interested in you.”

Lin Xiu seemed to know what she was thinking, and then said lightly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Liu Yanran was stunned for a moment, and a look of embarrassment appeared on her face.

But at this time, she didn’t hesitate and said directly, “Yes…about ten miles.”

“En, take me there.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lin Xiu nodded, then said with his Dark Edge spear.

“Okay…”

Liu Yanran nodded, even if Lin Xiu didn’t go, she would have to go over there herself.

With Liu Yanran leading, Lin Xiu quickly walked out of the forest, and there was a road in front of him.

“Thank you for just now”

Lin Xiu was silent along the way, Liu Yanran looked at Lin Xiu’s side profile, then thought about it, and said aloud.

“It’s fine.”

Lin Xiu shook his head, and then didn’t say anything more.

Currently, Lin Xiu was still observing the surrounding scene.

The flowers and trees around here were bigger than those on earth.

Even some insects too.

Moreover, there were actually two suns in the sky. At this time, under the sunlight, it felt very hot.

However, Lin Xiu was a high-level warrior. For Lin Xiu, this kind of heat was nothing at all.

On the other hand, Liu Yanran was already dripping with sweat on her forehead.

“Over there, is the city where I live, Tianlong City.”

After walking for about seven or eight kilometers, he turned his eyes to the front, and he could clearly see that there was a city in front of him.

There was a high city wall outside the city, the city gate was very large, and there were many people coming and going around.

This city wall looked different from the ancient city walls on the earth. It was made of special metal. Under the sun’s rays, the surface has a black light reflecting.

“This is our solar city wall. Most of the energy supply in the city relies on these to run.”

Liu Yanran said aloud at this time.

Lin Xiu nodded slightly, looked into the distance, and narrowed slightly.

“By the way, my benefactor, my name is Liu Yanran. I don’t know your name?”

“My last name is Lin, first name is Xiu.”

Lin Xiu said indifferently that when he got to this place, it was impossible for anyone to know him.

Moreover, in this situation at Mardi Planet, even if the people from the three major families knew that he was here, the warriors on the earth would not dare to come here

in large numbers to find trouble with him.

“Are you… an Earthling?”

Liu Yanran hesitated for a while, and then said to Lin Xiu.

“Yes, why?”

Lin Xiu stopped, looked at her and said.

“Nothing!”

Liu Yanran was startled when Lin Xiu suddenly stopped and looked at her. she quickly shook her head and said.
