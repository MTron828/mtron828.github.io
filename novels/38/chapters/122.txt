Chapter 123: Fall

“We have no ill intentions toward you, we just want to trade something with you.” Zhang Yin looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“Trade?” Hearing his words, Lin Xiu was taken aback.

“We need the teeth of this Hermit Worm as one of the materials for forging weapons.” Zhang Yin smiled bitterly and said to Lin Xiu.

“So what are you going to trade it with?” The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up at this moment and he asked with great interest.

Lin Xiu didn’t mind giving them the material, he wanted to throw it away anyway, but now that someone wanted to trade, it was like an opportunity.

“How about a rank 4 Odd Crystal?” Zhang Yin took out the crystal from his pocket and asked.

Lin Xiu gave an awkward look at this moment which made Zhang Yin nervous. The biggest chip he had right now was this crystal.

“Okay,” Lin Xiu nodded but was laughing in his heart. What a silly chap, he would obviously take the Odd Crystal. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Thank you.”

After taking this blue Odd Crystal, Zhang Yin and the others went to the body of the Hermit Worm.

After they confirmed that the evolved beast was dead, they began to bring out tools to pull out the teeth of the Hermit Worm.

Lin Xiu took the Odd Crystal and continued walking straight ahead.

The afternoon sun hung in the cloudless sky, completely different from the storm in the Azure Forest.

Gradually, there was a slight breeze and the golden gravel on the ground was constantly being blown around.

But as Lin Xiu walked, he began to feel something amiss because his footsteps seemed to be sinking.

Crash——

The wind was blowing even harder at this moment and the gravel was blowing against his face.

And the gravel beneath his feet seemed to become a swamp and he sunk straight into it.

‘What’s going on?’

Lin Xiu frowned and burst forth as he directly leaped to the opposite side.

But when Lin Xiu landed, his whole body sunk!

‘Damn!!!’

This terrifying scene made Lin Xiu curse in his heart as he fell to the bottom.

Pitch-black, completely pitch-black.

Lin Xiu felt his back aching badly. The spear box on his back was very tough and didn’t break at all, but his back was hurting instead.

At this moment, Lin Xiu was holding the Dark Edge spear and let out a force, igniting a flame from the spear.

With the light from this skill, Lin Xiu took out the pair of night vision devices that Tian Zhi gave him previously and put them on.

Lin Xiu pressed a button and the headlights on the top of the night vision device lit up. At this moment, it looked like daytime within his field of vision.

Lin Xiu looked up and above him was all gravel. He didn’t know why this gravel didn’t seem to fall off.

He couldn’t jump over this height at all.

Looking around, he could see that he seemed to be surrounded by blue iron walls and there was also a strange pattern on them.

‘Could it be… a relic!?’

Lin Xiu was surprised. In previous centuries, mankind had a variety of different civilizations, and when fighting against extraterrestrial life, they also left behind a lot of bases.

Generally in those bases, not only were there treasures but also… monsters!

Lin Xiu held his breath and walked slowly to the front.

This tunnel seemed like it was a square-shaped tunnel. As he walked to the front, he could see everything around him, and everywhere were blue iron walls. There were many dents on them, like a pattern.

As he continued to walk forward, Lin Xiu heard a loud noise.

It sounded like… a water source?

Swish swish swish——

At this moment, a burst of sounds came from the distance, and in the dark, he could see many pairs of small, bright red eyes.

Rank 3 Gold Rats!

These were no different from ordinary domestic rats, but they were much larger, almost the size of rabbits, and the most frightening thing was that the teeth in their mouths were rows of inverted thorns.

Lin Xiu was shocked when he saw them and quickly brandished his Dark Edge spear and charged over!

Rumbling rumbling——

Before he got close to these damned things, Lin Xiu waved the long spear in his hand frantically, and several phoenixes flew over instantly!

But these phoenixes seemed to have little effect on the Gold Rats. In the next moment, a large number of Gold Rats sprinted toward Lin Xiu!

‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers’!!!

Lin Xiu did not cloak his incompetency at this moment and directly used all his strength. The tip of the spear was like cold rays of light and kept stabbing like the dazzling stars. With the sharpness of the Dark Edge spear, as well as his own source strength covering it, a dozen rats were killed.

The notifications in his head kept ringing but Lin Xiu didn’t care about this, he still had to accumulate a lot more experience to upgrade.

There were more and more Gold Rats and Lin Xiu was attacking crazily with his spear. He killed almost a hundred rank 3 Gold Rats and gotten more than a hundred rank 3 Odd crystals.

But this was quite tiring for Lin Xiu. The Dark Edge spear was already very heavy and with the continuous usage of ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’, it was simply too laborious.

At this moment, Lin Xiu knelt on the ground, panting, then put all these Odd Crystals into his backpack.

This was simply the place to gain experience and Odd crystals.

Although Lin Xiu felt tired, this was still pretty good.

But at this moment, there was no Gold Rat running over anymore. Thinking about it, what just happened was really unusual; it was as if these things weren’t attacking him but were fleeing.

This strange tunnel seemed to extend in all directions, he didn’t know where was the end or how to get out at all.

‘Someone is here!?’

Just then, Lin Xiu heard footsteps at the front. Although these footsteps were very soft, it was obvious that someone deliberately walked quietly. However, Lin Xiu could still hear them.

Lin Xiu turned off the night vision device’s headlights. He could still see quite clearly with the night vision, just not as clear.
