Chapter 479: Secret Technique of Rejuvenation?

Boom Boom Boom – –

By now, the soldiers no longer care about it. They frantically pulled the trigger and released a large amount of laser rays towards the zombies that were rushing towards them.

But, there were too many of them and most of the laser beams didn’t hit the zombies’ brains, which were the crucial points for the zombies to be killed. This was why the laser beams did not make much of a difference.

The students who did not get onto the spaceship suck close to it and were all screaming in fear.

Ye Shuanger saw that there were increasing numbers of zombies around them and just when one of the zombies was about to reach her, she immediately closed her eyes.

She’s doomed!

Boom – –

The pain from being bitten did not happen as she had imagined. All she heard at that moment was a soft groan.

What’s happening?!

Ye Shuanger was shocked when she opened her eyes. She noticed that all of the zombies that were surrounding them had been cut at their waist and there were now seperated into halves.

She wasn’t the only one, the rest of the students and the soldiers were shocked as well.

“Huuuu….I didn’t think that the students from your school would be hiding here.”

Then, there was a sound that came from a distance.

There was a young man….who was accompanied by a young woman.

But, before they were able to see them clearly, the door that was connected to the balcony had been destroyed.

Kong Loong – –

Following the loud bang from the door, there was a huge amount of zombies that rushed towards them.

“AHHHHHHH!!!”

Most of the younger girls screamed after seeing such a horrifying scene.

“How many seconds?” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue who was by his side and asked.

“Ten.” While answering, she swung the sword that was in her hands!

Xiu– –

There was a crescent shaped energy that was released from the sword and it immediately chopped all the zombies into halves. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The corpse of the zombies all fell to the ground.

“That’s…..so cool…..”

The soldiers and students, who saw what happened, widened their eyes in surprise.

These terrifying zombies were completely destroyed by this young woman and her sword. This was extremely scary for them.

But, these zombies were much more disgusting than normal zombies. This was because even though most of their bodies had been chopped into two, they could still move their heads.

They continuously moved their mouth and grabbed onto the ground with their hands, trying to crawl towards Luo Yue.

Luo Yue frowned at such things. She swung her sword the second time and all of the zombies’ heads were broken into two.

Lin Xiu, on the other hand, was occupied as well. With the Dark Edge in his hands, he was dashing towards the large group of zombies that were nearby!

Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers!!!!

Lin Xiu groaned and pierced Dark Edge through the sky, it looked as if there were hundreds of spears that were being pierced into the zombies’ brains. There were bloody holes on the zombie’s head and most of the content inside the head came flowing out of the hole.

Both of them were finally getting serious. They moved their weapons swiftly and were attacking all of the zombies around them.

However, there were way too many zombies around and soon, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were swamped.

The very next moment, all of the zombies that drowned Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were killed.

As they took a closer look, they noticed that there was a spherical pale, blue screen that was surrounding Lin Xie and Luo Yue.

“That’s ….. Yuan?!” When the soldiers realised what it was, their eyes were filled with shock.

These skills of using high grade energy were only used by warriors that were at least rank 6 and above.

These two looked like they were only teenagers who were 18. How is it possible that they have such powerful skills?!

“I have heard of how some rank 8 warriors were able to reduce the size of their body as well as their strength, known as the Secret Technique of Rejuvenation. They were able to change their body back to when they were much younger…”

One of the soldiers spoke with a trembling voice as they watched how Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were busy slaying the zombies around them.

From their experience, most of the rank 6 warriors were older men.

They would never believe that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were only teenagers.

One should remember that the headmaster of their academy was only a rank 4 warrior and he was at least 50 years old.

“Brother Lin Xiu?!” Then, Ye Shuanger seemed to have caught a clear glance of the man who was in front of them. Her eyes widened and she was looking extremely surprised.

“Shuanger, do you know them….?” The girl next to her asked out of curiosity.

Her body was slightly injured because of what happened but it wasn’t a big injury.

“En!” Ye Shuanger continued looking at Lin Xiu and the Dak Edge that he was using. She was sure that the man was Lin Xiu!

Although she didn’t know how Lin Xiu’s abilities improved so drastically and the weapon that he was slightly different from the spear that he had before, Ye Shuanger was still able to recognise Lin Xiu.

“What are you doing?! Can’t you see that there are zombies heading our way?! Fly this stupid thing!” The boy who closed the doors to the spaceship screamed at the men who were opposite him.

There was a window on the spaceship and they could clearly see how Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were killing the zombies like madmen.

But still, he just wanted to leave this place.

“Zhao Xia, that’s enough! Your classmates are still down there!” Teacher Zhang frowned and quickly told the boy in front of him.

He was already extremely unhappy about how this boy decided to close the door because Zhao Xia was being selfish but after considering who he was, Teacher Zhang had no idea but to keep it to himself.

But now, this boy was about to abandon his classmates and Teacher Zhang couldn’t bear it any longer.

“If the rubbish there is meant to die, they shall.” Zhao Xiao said in a cold tone.

Slap – –

As soon as he said those words, Teacher Zhang gave him a huge slap.

“That’s enough!”

After being slapped, there was a red mark on Zhao Xia’s cheek.

The students around who witnessed the scene did not dare to say a single thing. They knew who Zhao Xia was and Zhao Xia was a petty person.

Those who dared to go against him were killed by his family and as the rest of them got reminded, none of them dared to stand up against him.

“Did you just slap me?” Zhao Xia glared at Teacher Zhao and gave a wicked smile.

“Get the spaceship flying! Or else, all of you will be fired!!” Zhao Xia turned around and screamed at the staff who were at the back.

However, at that very moment, the entire spaceship shook as if it had been hit by something. There was a huge noise and the entire spaceship started to shake vigorously.
