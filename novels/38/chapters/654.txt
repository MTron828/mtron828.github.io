Chapter 655: I Am Your Ancestor

Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

Boom –

At this moment, a huge sound rang out, and the platform made a huge vibration.

‘The surrounding audience covered their ears instinctively.

Because the sound was really too loud, especially since there was amplifying equipment on the competition stage, making the sound so loud that it seemed to burst everyone’s eardrums.

“It seems that I won in the end.”

At this time, Lin Xiu said lightly.

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu’s spear had already penetrated Nan Huang’s head.

Moreover, there were still a lot of wounds on Nan Huang’s body, the battle suit was extremely tattered, and blood was flowing out.

The most talented existence in Sky City, dead.

“Huang!!!”

‘When Nan Huang’s grandfather saw this scene, he could not help wailing.

But now, he has no way to go up to the platform at all.

The girl was still standing there. Her strength was really terrifying. He went up to kill Lin Xiu, but he had not succeeded, so he would probably be killed by this girl.

“What a weak ant.”

The girl looked at Nan Huang’s body at this time, and then glanced at the old man over there. At this time, she couldn’t help shaking her head and said aloud.

“You are…”

Baili Haoling came over at this time, and said to the girl with a face full of surprise.

She had a very familiar feeling with the girl.

And her style and face were somewhat similar to her own.

“Whose daughter are you?”

The girl looked at Baili Haoling and said aloud.

“My father is Baili Jing.”

Baili Haoling said seriously at this time.

“Baili Jing… um… I don’t think I’ve heard of it.”

The girl touched her chin and shook her head after thinking about it.

“Oh right, I think I haven’t come back for almost two hundred years…”

At this time, before Baili Haoling could speak, the girl mumbled to herself.

Two hundred years!?

Lin Xiu, who has a good hearing ability, could not help but widen his eyes when he heard this.

It means that the girl in front of him who looked like fifteen or sixteen years old is at least two hundred years old!?

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu was extremely shocked.

He was in disbelief.

However, as the strength of a warrior increases, the structure of the body will also change, and cells will also evolve. It is very easy for a high-ranking warrior to live to be more than 170 years old.

It’s just that they would still be age, just like Bai Li Tao – he looks like an old man now.

But this gril i front of him – he couldn’t tell at all!

“Are you the elder of our Baili family?”

Baili Haoling couldn’t help saying at this moment.

Because she really found the girl in front of her really familiar.

“Elder?”

The girl raised her brows, then thought for a while, and suddenly said, “I am your ancestor.”

Pit

Hearing her words, Lin Xiu almost laughed.

No matter how you listen to this, it sounded like she was cursing.

But the girl’s expression seemed to be very serious.

“Ancestor?”

Baili Haoling couldn’t help but widen her eyes, and now her eyes were full of shock.

“Tl give you a present.” The girl thought for a moment, then stretched out her finger and tapped in the middle of Baili Haoling’s forehead.

Immediately, a ray of light burst out, as if a water pattern rippled on her forehead.

And in the next moment, Baili Haoling felt dazed in her eyes, and as a warm feeling came, she fainted.

However, the girl seemed to know that Baili Haoling would faint and she easily hugged her at this time.

“Hm, what’s your relationship with her?”

At this moment, the girl looked at Lin Xiu, and said curiously.

“She is my master.”

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then said helplessly.

The background of my cheap master was really too strong.

This girl was obviously an old monster.

“Who are you calling an old monster?”

Just as Lin Xiu was thinking about it, the girl stared at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

She looked gloomy and stared at Lin Xiu, which made Lin Xiu feel a little terrified.

“No, you’re my elder sister…: Although Lin Xiu didn’t know why she could see through his own thoughts, he quickly changed his words.

“Hmph, that’s more like it.”

The girl said with a cold snort.

‘When she was about to leave with Baili Haoling in her arms, she stopped and threw a bag to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu caught this thing subconsciously at this time.

“This is…

Lin Xiu looked at the small airtight bag that could not tell what was inside, and there was a curious look in his eyes.

“QQ candy, have some.” The girl said at this time.

As soon as she finished speaking, in the next moment, she just jumped away.

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment, and after watching the girl leave the competition stage with Baili Haoling in her arms, he felt a little dumbfounded.

QQcandy?

What is this all about…

But at this time Lin Xiu still put this thing in his pocket.

At this moment, Lin Xiu suddenly felt the strength of his whole body seemed to disappear in an instant.

The sequelae of ‘Fury’ have already appeared at this time!

Damn it!

Lin Xiu directly held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and pressed it against the ground, preventing his body from falling on the ground.

At this moment, the host looked at the rostrum.

Seeing the people on the rostrum nod, he immediately held the microphone and shouted loudly, “Okay, friends from the audience, the wonderful final is over, let’s congratulate the winning team this time…” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“The Sacred Region Academy!!!”

“Phew—”

At this time, when the host announced the result, the surrounding audience was all excited.

Although something went wrong in the end, it was still very exciting in general, especially the Sacred Region Academy, which had been suppressed at the beginning, actually defeated the five warriors in Sky City with just two people.

And the most exciting thing was that Lin Xiu directly used that terrifying skill to kill Nan Huang.

“The corpse, move it back.”

When the surrounding audience cheered, Nan Huang’s grandfather’s expression became extremely ugly.

“Yes.”

Hearing Nan Huang’s voice, some men quickly walked up to the sky platform and moved Nan Huang’s body away.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu looked afar, and met the old man’s eyes.

Nan Huang’s grandfather looked at Lin Xiu gloomily, his eyes were full of terrifying killing intent.

Lin Xiu didn’t have the slightest fear when he saw this. He held the Dark Edge spear in one hand to support the ground, and the other hand gave him a middle finger.

When the old man saw this scene, his lungs were about to explode with anger.

“You will definitely die in Sky City!”
