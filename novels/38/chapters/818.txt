Chapter 819: Life or Death, I Will Be By Your Side

When Lin Xiu heard the noises behind him, he quickly turned around and that’s when he clearly saw a large group of warriors flying in the air.

Behind them, there were even more warriors.

There were too many of them!

“Both of you….leave!!!”

After seeing what it was, Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank uncontrollably.

As he activated his analytical eyes, he could clearly feel like all of the warriors who were flying towards them were warrior kings.

As for those running on the ground, there were at least hundreds of warrior masters!

There were too many of them and all of them were extremely strong which worried Lin Xiu.

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and shook her head.

“Life or death, I will not leave you alone.”

“Luo Yan…leave right now! If you stay here, I’m worried that they might harm you.”

Lin Xiu said to Luo Yan.

Luo Yue has dramatically improved from before and he knew her too well. No matter what he said, she would never leave as long as she had made up her mind.

Luo Yan was aware of it as well. She clenched onto her jaw and when she finally made up her decision, the warrior kings were already headed towards them!

Everything happened within a blink of an eye. All of the warrior masters had already surrounded the group from all directions.

“Hmph! You will not be able to leave even if you wanted to!”

There was a loud voice that came from the sky.

Luo Jiucheng looked down at Lin Xiu and the Luo sisters with eyes filled with murderous intention. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Such useless people…just like your father!”

“Don’t you dare insult my father!”

When Luo Yan heard what Luo Jiucheng said, she glared at the arrogant man who was in the air.

“Luo Zheng is just a man that I defeated. The one who ran to that useless planet and gave birth to a pair of useless daughters.”

Luo Jiucheng had already decided to cut ties with them which was why he spoke coldly to Luo Yan.

Hua Zhen has been killed and the marriage proposal would naturally be over as well.

Plus, Luo Yue is related to a man from earth and the royal family would never accept Luo Yue’s existence.

“This is the man who killed Huang Zhen?”

There was another elder in the air as well. His eyes were cold as he glared at Lin Xiu.

There were 14 other warrior kings as well that were looking at Lin Xiu. They were watching him as if Lin Xiu was a dead man.

“Since you killed a member of the royal family, it won’t be over with just dying. Capture all of them alive.”

The elder was known as Huang Lin, the ultimate warrior master. He was the strongest amongst all the others.

Other than Luo Jiucheng, the rest of the warriors there belonged to the royal family.

“Hmph!”

One of the men in the air glared at Lin Xiu. He sneered as he swung a fist. There was a gigantic fist figure in the air and it was thrown towards the ground!

Koong Loong – –

There was a huge explosion that occurred on the ground.

At that moment, all three of them dodged the attack.

Luo Yan was aware that she was weaker amongst them and quickly released her ‘Yuan’.

Most of the warriors around were warrior masters. All of them headed towards Luo Yan, hoping to be able to capture her first.

Lin Xiu noticed what they wanted to do and swung his spear. With the source energy from his body being transmitted into his spear, the entire weapon looked as if it was made of purple gold crystal.

‘Heavenly Array’! ‘Rage’!

As he combined both of these powerful skills together, he released the both of them together!

With both of them together, Lin Xiu moved the spear in his arm and instantly, there were multiple flaming birds that were released at the same time.

These flaming birds were dark blue in colour and they had a high temperature.

With the appearance of the flaming birds, the entire place felt like the centre of a volcano.

‘Profound Intent – Torrential Storm of Rose Flower’!!!

Koong Loong – –

There were thousands of huge flaming birds being released at the same time as Lin Xiu moved his spear.

With him being in the best condition, Lin Xiu’s strength has already reached his peak!

The power of these flaming birds was beyond terrifying!

The warriors around did not even get the chance to react and they were already attacked by the flaming birds!

In that instant, thousands of warrior kings around them died instantly.

With Lin Xiu’s abilities at this point, he was extremely close to being a warrior king!

With his system strengthening him, Lin Xiu’s strength was already beyond a warrior master. He was definitely a warrior king!

‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’!!!!

The energy in him was more than enough to allow Lin Xiu to continue these large-scale warrior skills.

The warrior skills released by a warrior king was enough to destroy an entire city.

Plus, Lin Xiu’s warrior skills consist of hellfire.

It was extremely terrifying.

The warrior masters around them didn’t even have the chance to release their ‘Yuan’ as they were facing the large number of flaming birds and the flaming balls.

Almost all of them died on the spot!

Luo Yan’s eyes were filled with shock as well.

The man who was being attacked by the rank 9 warriors has now grown to this extent!

Initially, she thought that it was only possible for Luo Yue to improve so quickly because of her inborn talent but she didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be even scarier than her!

Luo Yue swung her sword and there was a bright light that headed towards the men!

‘First sword – Chopping the sky’!

Luo Yue!! The peak of a warrior master!

Luo Jiucheng looked at the scene in shock and there was a complicated look in his eyes.

Luo Yue had inherited the true blood of the Luo family and she was the strongest amongst them all.

If they continue to allow Luo Yue to cultivate, her future would be bright.

But….they didn’t have a chance now. The royal family would never let her go!

For their own benefit, no matter what Luo Yue must die.

“Damn it, this brat!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was using such horrifying skills, the warrior kings started to look worried.

It wasn’t easy to raise a warrior master, especially when most of them were at their peak of warrior master. Most of them were now dead after getting killed by Lin Xiu.

Huang Lin started moving and appeared right in front of Lin Xiu.

With his fist clenched tight, he threw it towards Lin Xiu!

Koong Loong – –

The punch was extremely quick so that there was no opportunity for Lin Xiu to dodge the attack.

At that moment, Lin Xiu’s brain immediately exploded!

However, he was a warrior king after all. He quickly noticed that this was not Lin Xiu’s physical body!

When he turned around, there was a bright light that headed towards him!

Lin Xiu, who was holding onto the spear, came from behind!

When the spear was being thrusted forward, there was a bright glow from the tip of it.

In a split second, there were thousands of spears that appeared in the air!

There was a blue flame at the tip of the spear. Even when it was Huang Lin, he wouldn’t be able to take it face on and was forced to release his ‘Yuan’!

Boom boom boom – –

The spear landed on his ‘Yuan’ and there were multiple explosions that followed after it.

The expression on the warrior king’s face changed drastically.

But, at this time, it would be better for them to not participate.

This was because for a warrior king, if they had to work together to kill a young man, it would be an insult!

“Damn it! This brat!!!”
