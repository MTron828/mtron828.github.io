Chapter 266: New Information

Additional information?

Lin Xiu frowned when he heard that and revealed a pondering look.

The information in here was rather reliable and the most updated.

“Latest news, Ice Lotus Fire was discovered in Dark Forest.” The attendant looked at Lin Xiu and whispered.

This was paid information and he was not foolish enough to reveal it loudly.

Ice Lotus Fire? Lin Xiu was stunned when he heard the slightly unfamiliar name.

‘What is that?’

Little girl Li was confused, but information that cost so much meant that the object was definitely precious.

“There are many warriors gathering here for it. Even the rank 9 warrior proclaimed that he is willing to pay anyone who finds this Ice Lotus Fire 10 billion.” The attendant added.

10 billion!?

Lin Xiu breathed in cold air when he heard that.

10 billion was not a small amount and extremely abundant. Even a few warriors would not be able to achieve that sort of wealth even if they completed missions for their entire lives.

And this 10 billion was enough to buy all sorts of skill cards and weapons.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and replied, “Then do you know where this object is in Dark Forest?”

The attendant waved his hands at the question, “If I knew, all these warriors wouldn’t have to form groups to look for it, right?”

“The number of warriors that are here today is 10 times more than the usual.”

The attendant continued to add. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“So there’s no difference whether you say this or not.” Lin Xiu sneered.

“Is my money so easily earned?”

“No, I have supplementary information to tell you that will help you.” The attendant shook his head and continued.

“What is it?” Lin Xiu asked.

“There are a few dimensional creatures in Dark Forest that started becoming active, and there are even sightings of rank 7 dimensional creatures.”

“I suspect that the appearance of the Ice Lotus Fire is related to those monsters.”

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted when he heard that.

Dimensional creatures!?

And rank 7 at that!

The Dark Forest was formed when an object dropped out from a space crack and mutated the ecosphere around the area.

So it was a common occurrence for dimensional creatures to appear.

But a rank 7 dimensional creature was surprising.

A dimensional creature was many times stronger than an ordinary evolved beast.

Everyone knew that it would become dangerous if this went on.

“By any chance, did you see a beautiful young lady that came here for information?” Lin Xiu pondered for a moment before asking the attendant.

Lin Xiu thought about Luo Yue. If she was nearby, would she do the same and gather information from the same restaurant?

Lin Xiu felt that it was very probable and therefore questioned the attendant.

“A beautiful young lady?” The attendant was stunned when he heard the question and started to think about it.

He scratched his chin as though recalling something.

Lin Xiu shook his head when he saw that. By the looks of it, Luo Yue did not pass through here.

Although he knew she would definitely head into Dark Forest, it was extremely large. Whether or not they would encounter each other was an unknown matter.

Lin Xiu’s mood dampened when he thought about this.

Lin Xiu felt bored having not seen the cold poker face for a few days.

‘People do get used to things easily!’

Lin Xiu muttered to himself inwardly.

Just as Lin Xiu was about to leave, the attendant clapped his hands and said, “I got it, there was indeed a young lady that passed through here.”

“What does she look like?” Lin Xiu immediately asked.

There were very few warriors that were young like Luo Yue, especially one that had the strength to come to Dark Forest.

Lin Xiu guessed that the person the attendant was talking about was Luo Yue.

“It was a few days ago, the young lady came and asked for information. I was almost stabbed by her sword.” The attendant chuckled bitterly upon recalling the incident.

“What does she look like?” Lin Xiu looked at him and asked.

“Uhm…. roughly the same age as you, she was really beautiful. It’s my first time meeting such a pretty young lady.”

“But she’s rather ice cold and has a poker face that makes people dislike her.”

The attendant shook his head as he said that.

Lin Xiu became sure that it was Luo Yue. The ice-cold aura and poker face was definitely Luo Yue.

“Which part of Dark Forest did she go to?” Lin Xiu continued to ask.

He figured it would be great if he could find Luo Yue and if he failed, he would have to level up by killing evolved beasts and see if he could find any more information on her.

He was unhappy she left without a word.

“I don’t know about that.” The attendant shrugged his hands helplessly. “Dark Forest is too big and it’s difficult to find a person. And there are special magnetic fields within that block all communication inside.”

“But similar to you, she asked the three secret questions and left as though she was in a hurry…”

Before he could complete his sentence, Lin Xiu jumped down from his seat and walked out.

He had got the information he needed and returned back. He decided to take a look at Dark Forest the next day.

Lin Xiu logged onto the warrior union website records on his phone after returning to his room and investigated the Ice Lotus Fire.

He had a faint guess that it was similar to the Red Lotus Fire and were unimaginable and terrifying energy bodies.

They were extremely precious that people would be willing to afford 10 billion.

“Come out.”

After turning a corner on the road, it became somewhat darker. Lin Xiu suddenly stopped and spoke up indifferently.
