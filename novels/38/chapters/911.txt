Chapter 912: Fighting A Respected Warrior Again

Seeing this scene, the people around couldn’t help but exclaim.

They didn’t see Lin Xiu’s movements at all and Lin Xiu had already dodged and was in the air.

crackling-

And at this moment, a large number of electric lights were gathered in both hands.

“This…”

Seeing this scene, the pupils in An Nengxing’s pupils could not help but shrink.

This terrifying electric current seemed to make the surrounding air scorched.

Moreover, warriors who generally use source strength to convert to electricity must have a strong resistance to electricity.

.

Otherwise, before others get the electricity, they will electrocute themselves to death.

Therefore, it is very difficult to transform source strength into electric current or flame.

“go!”

Lin Xiu waved his hands in the sky and the two balls of electricity in his hands were all released from his hands.

Immediately charge towards Shadow below!

......

The speed at which these two huge electric currents slammed down was too fast and they covered the entire platform.

Shadow had absolutely no way to dodge.

Unless he jumped out of the platform.

But if you jump out of the platform, it meant that you lost the game.

Shadow frowned.

Just when the two electric balls were about to hit his body, his ‘Sphere’ unfolded directly!

The blue ‘Sphere’ directly surrounded his body.

boom boom boom —

The two huge groups of lightning energy collided with his ‘Sphere’, making a huge sound after another.

But it was completely blocked by his ‘Sphere’.

“Hahaha, Shadow is a warrior of the Respected warrior level, so you thought that your energy could break defenses?”

An Nengxing looked at Lin Xiu who was floating in the air and said with a sneer.

swoosh—

But Lin Xiu didn’t answer his words at this time. With a flash, he flew straight down from the sky!

boom boom boom —

The hands, which were full of electricity again, blasted directly at the ‘Sphere’ unfolded by Shadow!

A powerful force slammed into his ‘Sphere’ and the huge impact made his body constantly retreat.

Shadow’s eyes also changed suddenly.

The sword he was holding slammed towards Lin Xiu who wanted to attack again!

Dang–

His sword collided with Lin Xiu’s fist. Instead of cutting Lin Xiu’s fist in half, it made a loud noise.

“interesting.”

Lin Xiu took a few steps back, revealing a faint smile.

At the same time, he used his legs hard and continued to punch toward Shadow’s ‘Sphere’!

“Let me try my newly learned skill.”

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, the punch he threw out burst into a dazzling light!

Purple-gold skill – ‘Fist Ray’!

The surrounding warriors could not help but squint from the dazzling light.

Some warriors also subconsciously stretched out their hands to block their eyes.

Boom—

This fist hit Shadow’s ‘Sphere’ again.

What’s different this time was that the loud sound made by this punch seemed to make the entire space explode!

Shadow’s body also flew out directly, hitting the wall in the distance behind heavily.

Boom—

At this moment, many cracks appeared directly on the wall.

A large number of rocks fell, causing the front side to be filled with thick dust.

“It looks like I won.”

Lin Xiu looked at his fist, then looked at An Nengxing.

“you…”

.

An Nengxing stood up, his eyes full of disbelief.

He saw Lin Xiu’s punch just now.

Slamming on Shadow’s ‘Sphere’, it not only cracked Shadow’s ‘Sphere’, but also blasted out his body.

The power of that punch was really terrifying.

“Why, An Nengxing, you’re not going to renege on a debt, are you?”

Hu Ling looked at An Nengxing’s face and couldn’t help but sneer.

They had a bit of disagreement before and Hu Ling was happy to see such a result.

“Hmph, who’s going to do that huh.”

An Nengxing’s face became extremely ugly.

“It’s just that I didn’t seem to say that if Shadow flew out of the platform, it would be counted as a loss, right?”

Hu Ling frowned.

An Nengxing did not say that just now, because it has always been a consensus.

Hua la hua la-

And at this time, Shadow appeared from the dust just now.

At this time, Shadow’s mask had fallen to the ground, revealing a face full of scars.

Combined with his sinister eyes, it made people shudder.

“This is the true face of Shadow…”

When some warriors saw this scene, they couldn’t help but exclaimed.

“I want you to die.”

Shadow looked at Lin Xiu on the platform and said in a strange voice.

The murderous intent in his eyes has reached its peak.

“Is that so? You’ll have to try then.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

He could feel that the power of this Shadow was rising.

Now Shadow was really serious.

Respected warrior.

This is the second time Lin Xiu has fought against a Respected warrior-level warrior.

However, Lin Xiu didn’t have the slightest fear.

He raised his hand in the air and waved and the Dark Edge spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

“A spear?” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Some warriors were stunned when they saw this scene.

This long spear is so conspicuous, if Lin Xiu has been carrying it, everyone around should be able to see it.

But just now, Lin Xiu really had nothing in his hands.

How did that long spear come about?

Everyone’s eyes were full of shock.

Seeing this scene, Hu Ling was also very surprised.

The shock that Lin Xiu brought to her was really too much.

swoosh—

Shadow ignored this change and his physical strength exploded to the extreme and he appeared in front of Lin Xiu in an instant.

A flash of cold light split Lin Xiu’s body in half!

This blow, like a lightning strike, killed Lin Xiu, making An Nengxing extremely excited.

“Purple-gold skill, ‘Flash’!”

An Nengxing laughed loudly.

Because he saw that Lin Xiu’s body was instantly split in half!

However, his smile didn’t stay for long and he suddenly froze.

Because there were several figures of Lin Xiu around!

These Lin Xiu were all holding Dark Edge spears, so they couldn’t tell which one was the real Lin Xiu!

“He also knows the clone skill!?”

Zhang Jin and Luo Kun were a little surprised.

Clone-type skill were still very rare in the warrior world.

In particular, this kind of cloning that looked exactly the same, was even rarer.

“Playing all sorts of tricks huh!”

An Nengxing gritted his teeth and said.

Shadow looked around.

There was no movement.

He glanced at the surroundings, every Lin Xiu was exactly the same.

He could not sense his true strength!
