Chapter 966: I Play With Lightning Too

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Koong Loong – —

A large number of lightning appeared in the sky and all of a sudden, with his hammer swinging in the air, there was a huge lightning that looked like a dragon headed towards Lin Xiu!

This man would definitely be dead!!

Zhang Zheng roared in rage.

He wanted to kill Lin Xiu badly and had used the strongest skill that he had from his sourcemark.

“I don’t think that this would be enough.

Lin Xiu smirked as he looked at the terrifying lightning that looked like a dragon heading in his direction.

Lin Xiu did not move an inch.

He did not dodge the attack and did not release his ‘sphere’, he just looked at the lightning and allowed it to directly hit his body.

“You’re dead!”

On the other hand, Wang Qiang was still fighting Sun Kai.

He noticed the huge lightning released by Zhang Zhen and he knew how strong the lightning was.

However, Lin Xiu was not dodging from it nor defending it with his ‘Sphere’.

......

He was trying to take the attack physically! Does he have a death wish?

“Master! Be Careful!”

Wang Qiang couldn’t help but scream when he saw what was happening.

He could already clearly feel the horrifying energy coming from the lightning.

There was already a burnt smell in the air because of the lightning.

“Hey! Your opponent is over here!”

Sun Kai let out a hideous laugh as he attacked Wang Qiang!

Boom – –

Wang Qiang, who was still trying his best to block the attack coming from Sun Kai, his body was thrown far away.

His body landed far away by the edge of the stage and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Boom – –

At the same time, the lightning that Zhang Zhen released immediately headed towards Lin Xiu’s body!

“It does hurt a little.”

The terrifying looking lightning instantly wrapped itself around Lin Xiu’s body.

But, the scene of Lin Xiu being toasted black did not happen before his eyes.

Lin Xiu remained at the same spot and he did not seem to be in any pain.

“NO! That’s impossible…”

Zhang Zheng mumbled to himself after seeing how Lin Xiu was still standing straight.

It felt as if his world was about to crumble into pieces.

“How is this even possible?!”

Wu Hao, who was nearby, stared with his eyes open wide.

When he decided to bribe Zhang Zhen, he knew that Zhang Zhen was not someone ordinary.

However, he wouldn’t have thought that the skills that Zhang Zheng was most proud of were now useless against Lin Xiu!

It was just like a tickle to him!

It had crumbled Wu Hao’s world as well.

“Could it be possible that his body is resistant to lightning? Otherwise, no reapested warrior would be able to do this.”

One of the warriors who stood by Wu hao said instead.

To be frank, he couldn’t have been able to take the lightning.

Even if he had released the ‘sphere’.

“I know how to play with lightning as well, would you like to try?”

Lin Xiu allowed the lightning from Zhang Zhen to envelope around his body as he stared at Zhang Zhen and asked flatly.

Cracking – –

As soon as Lin Xiu was done, there was a horrible lightning that came from Lin Xiu’s body instead.

The entire ground immediately turned black because of the lightning.

“Indeed!”

The warrior standing by Wu Hao had his eyes opened wide when he saw Lin Xiu’s attack.

“This is what I call ‘Thousand Thunder’.

Lin Xiu moved his right hand and there was another horrifying lightning that came from his hands.

Boom —-

As the lightning rushed in all directions, there was a loud thunder that followed.

“Dirty Tricks!”

Zhang Zhen roareddin rage and quickly released his ‘sphere’.

As he did that, he raised his giant hammer, hoping to continue his attack towards Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

Then, multiple thick lightning directly landed on his ‘sphere’!

Zhang Zhen thought that he could block the attack with his ‘sphere’ in order to continue his attack on Lin Xiu but the large lightning coming from Lin Xiu threw him away!

Boom – –

His entire body fell to the ground.

Even with his ‘sphere’ released, it was still useless!

The remaining thousands of lights that were as thick as snakes were still heading towards Zhang Zhen’s ‘sphere’.

The sounds of the thunder could be heard continuously.

Even with his ‘sphere’ released, these terrifying lightning were still able to seep through it.

“Ahhhhh!!!!”

He cried in pain as the lightning hit his body.

Even if he could play with lightning and his body was resistant against lightning, he still couldn’t take the attack from such a terrifying attack.

Soon, with the large number of lightning attacking his body, Zhang Zhen’s body was completely toasted.

Zhang Zhen died! He’s dead!

“God damn…”

Wu Hao took another puff from his cigar.

As he thought of what happened earlier, he had cold sweats appearing all over his forehead.

This young man was incredibly powerful.

If he wanted to kill him, Wu Hao might have to get the elders of the Wu family.

However, that would be a difficult thing to do.

He couldn’t help but let out a breath of relief. It was fortunate that Lin Xiu wanted something from her. Otherwise, his life would have been in great trouble when he was at the bar.

“Zhang Zhen!”

Sun Kai couldn’t help but shiver when he saw what happened to his partner.

Zhang Zhen’s level was the same as his but now Zhang Zhen’s body was toasted.

This man…how could he be so powerful?!

“Wang Qiang, are you alright?”

Lin Xiu looked at Wang Qiang before asking about his condition.

“I’m alright.”

Wang Qiang shook his head as he stood up.

He tried to hold himself up with his long spear. He had to clean up the blood that was hanging by the edge of his mouth.

Damn…

Sun Kai looked at Wang Qiang before turning towards Lin Xiu. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Now that Zhang Zhen is dead, he would have to fight the both of them alone and he wasn’t sure if he could do it.

“What should he do now?”

“You….will be able to deal with him right?”

Lin Xiu sat on the ground as he asked Wang Qiang.

“Yes, master!”

Wang Qiang nodded his head as he grabbed onto his spear.

Even if it was a respected warrior standing before him, he still wasn’t afraid.

“Are you sure that you will stay out of this?”

Sun Kai looked at Lin Xiu and asked in a cold tone.

“Of course.”

Lin Xiu answered flatly.

Sun Kai glared at Lin Xiu as he was still a little sceptical.

But, he didn’t have the time as Wang Qiang was already attacking him!

“Go to hell!”

Seeing how Wang Qian was already ready to fight him, he picked up his axe and wanted to attack Wang Qian as well!

As he was fighting Wang Qiang, he kept looking at Lin Xiu.

Then, he realised that Lin Xiu was telling the truth. He wasn’t moving at all!
