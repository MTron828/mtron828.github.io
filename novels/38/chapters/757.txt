Chapter 758: Fierce Battle Again

“Fatty, these two are master warriors, don’t be careless.”

Lin Xiu looked at Liu Pan, whose eyes were red and his fighting power was constantly rising and he said aloud.

“Qian Lin, An Qi, stay where you are.”

Lin Xiu continued speaking.

An Qi and Qian Lin, who were planning to rush up to fight together, were startled.

After thinking about it for a while, they still listened to Lin Xiu’s voice and stood where they were without rushing up.

Because now they can clearly feel that these two ‘hunters’ were different from the previous ones.

Especially the clothes they wore, although they were all black cloaks, the patterns on them obviously seemed to be of a higher grade.

At this time, Liu Fat’s eyes were already full of hatred, anger and murderous intent.

At this time, he could no longer control himself and rushed straight ahead!

Swinging his axe, he is about to chop at these two ‘hunters’!

“Courting death!”

These two ‘hunters’ looked at Liu Pan, a rank 9 warrior who dared to attack them, which made them furious.

Holding the machete in their hands, they wanted to kill Liu Pan!

Boom—

But at this moment, with what seemed to be a slight explosion, they saw two flaming birds attacking!

The temperature of the flaming bird was very high and the moment they appeared, the surrounding temperature seems to have increased a lot in an instant.

Their faces changed slightly, then they dodged directly.

“Go to hell!!!”

And Liu Pan roared at this time, then frantically swung the double-sided axe to attack one of the ‘hunters’!

Dang dang- VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

The ‘hunter’ subconsciously held the weapon in his hand to resist Liu Pan’s attack.

But Liu Pan’s strength was very great and in this strange state, his strength seems to have increased a lot.

He kept parrying Liu Pan’s attacks, making metal collisions after another.

The expression in the eyes of the other ‘hunter’ changed slightly and he was about to attack Liu Pan over there.

They both wanted to kill Liu Pan together first.

“Your opponent is me.”

But just when he wanted to rush over, Lin Xiu had already appeared in front of him!

Looking at Lin Xiu’s figure, he snorted coldly and slashed towards Lin Xiu with the machete in his hand.

When the machete slashed over, there was a swooshing sound in the air.

Dang–

But at the next moment, Lin Xiu blocked him with his spear.

The ‘hunter”s eyes changed and the machete in his hand swung faster.

And Lin Xiu didn’t show weakness at all. He also waved his Dark Edge spear. While resisting his offensive, he also looked for opportunities to stab him!

“So fast...”

An Qi and Qian Lin, who were not far away, could not help exclaiming when they saw this scene.

The ‘hunter’ who fought against Lin Xiu also clearly felt that Lin Xiu’s strength was unusual.

At this time, he didn’t underestimate the enemy and directly used the domain forces!

“Humph!”

The ‘hunter’ who fought against Fat Liu also snorted coldly at this time, wanting to use the domain forces at the same time.

But at the moment when the domain forces of the two were used at the same time, Lin Xiu waved his left hand and a white light was instantly released!

Seeing that Lin Xiu also expanded his domain, the two of them were not surprised at all.

But as soon as Lin Xiu’s domain forces were released, they discovered that their domain had disappeared in an instant!

How can that be!

Not only them, but even An Qi and Qian Lin had their eyes wide open at this time, their eyes filled with disbelief.

Boom–

And right here, the long spear in Lin Xiu’s hand waved and the machete in the hands of the stunned ‘hunter’ was blown away.

The spear continued to stab over!

Seeing the sharp spearhead stab over, the ‘hunter’ was horrified, he activated his body skill and ducked directly behind.

And while dodging to the back, a pattern suddenly lit up between his eyebrows.

Source mark!

Boom—

And at the same time as the source mark appeared, a purple light lit up on his forehead.

As this purple light lit up, in this source mark, a series of very huge diamond-shaped ice crystals appeared in an instant!

These ice crystals were very sharp and terrifying and they all charged toward Lin Xiu!

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and did not continue to attack.

The source mark power of the element system.

But it seemed that because this ‘hunter’ had just reached the master warrior level, the strength was not too strong and the corresponding source mark strength was not very strong either.

So at this time, after Lin Xiu activated the ‘Without a Trace’ movement technique, his body quickly dodged.

boom boom boom —

The surrounding ground was impacted by those ice crystals, making a loud noise after another.

And An Qi and Qian Lin hurriedly unfolded their ‘Sphere’.

Because of the huge ice crystals released by his Source mark power, the surrounding trees kept falling.

“Go to hell!”

Just as Lin Xiu was dodging, he suddenly discovered that a huge diamond-shaped ice crystal had already reached right in front of him!

boom–

Lin Xiu’s entire head was pierced out!

When An Qi and Qian Lin saw this scene, their faces turned pale.

Lin Xiu... dead?

“Hahaha!!!”

The ‘hunter’ kept laughing at this time.

But at the next moment, he seemed to sense something was wrong and the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

When he turned around suddenly, he saw a flash of cold light!

Boom–

At this critical moment, he still reacted quickly and unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

Looking at the shot blocked by his ‘Sphere’, he couldn’t help but sweat.

Diffraction looked at the gun-wielding boy in front of him, he never thought that Lin Xiu was not dead!

“What kind of skills did you use!”

He growled.

It turned out that he was being tricked! The person who almost died just now was himself!

Sure enough, the reaction speed of the master warrior level was still too fast. If he was only a rank 9 warrior, he may have been deceived by his trick.

But Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate at this moment, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he waved it frantically!

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ Although he learned this skill a long time ago, it is really very useful.

And it hardly consumed source strength.

The long spear in his hand also began to slowly turn red at this time.

Boom boom boom —

After using ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’, the spear stabbed frantically.

In one second, it seemed as if hundreds of shots were stabbed, all of them impacting the Sphere of the ‘hunter’.

The huge impact force made him keep retreating.

He wanted to dodge, but Lin Xiu was chasing after him!
