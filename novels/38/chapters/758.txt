Chapter 759: Damn It!

His weapon was just knocked away by Lin Xiu and the Source mark power was also used.

Now there is no way to fight back!

“You can’t break my ‘Sphere’!!!”

The man looked at Lin Xiu and roared.

He has never had this kind of suffocating feeling of being attacked and only able to keep defending.

They were the only ‘hunters’ who hunted these warriors and killed them.

How could there be times when they were pressed and beaten!

And at this time he discovered an even more terrifying situation.

Every shot Lin Xiu stabbed seemed to be aimed at a spot on his ‘Sphere’.

At this moment, a crack started to appear on the ‘Sphere’!

How can that be!

The ‘hunter’ was shocked at this moment.

Could it be that he really wants to break his ‘Sphere’!?

Seeing that the cracks on his ‘Sphere’ became more and more, the look in his eyes also became panic.

If without the protection of the ‘Sphere’ and Lin Xiu’s spear penetrated directly into his body, then he would be dead! Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Run!

At this moment, the word he had never thought of had popped up in his mind.

“Where are you running to?”

Lin Xiu seemed to know his plan. With a wave of the spear in his hand, flaming birds charged away!

boom boom boom —

In an instant, those flaming birds impacted his ‘Sphere’, as if forming a fireball.

The ‘hunter’ who originally wanted to escape, but now all he sees is flames.

Apart from a sea of ??flames, nothing else could be seen.

Damn it!

Although these flames are all blocked by his own ‘Sphere’.

However, this situation also blocked his vision.

Now he doesn’t know the direction at all!

boom–

And at this moment, he felt his ‘Sphere’ being hit hard again.

The whole person took a few steps back.

This is not over yet, the continuous attack and the continuous impact on his ‘Sphere’ went on.

bang bang bang-

A loud sound rang out and Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and used the simplest and most effective skill- ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’, constantly hitting his ‘Sphere’.

And the location of the attack is also locked somewhere in this ‘Sphere’.

Such a concentrated attack is more conducive to breaking the ‘Sphere’!

As Lin Xiu’s strength became stronger and stronger, the Dark Edge spear slowly began to fail to keep up with Lin Xiu.

The biggest problem is that it feels lighter now and as the strength of the warriors against him becomes stronger, the effect of breaking the ‘Sphere’ becomes less and less obvious.

But as long as he keeps attacking a point, he can still break the ‘Sphere’!

Especially this ‘hunter’, who obviously had just been promoted to the Master warrior level, Lin Xiu is 100% sure that he could kill him!

Boom—

As Lin Xiu’s spear stabbed out again, the sharp spearhead slammed into the ‘Sphere’ that had begun to crack and it sounded like an explosion.

His ‘Sphere’ was just pierced by Lin Xiu!

“What!!!”

As soon as the ‘Sphere’ was pierced, those flames poured in directly!

His body, at this moment, was completely covered by flames!

The clothes on his body were also burned at this time.

The temperature of the flame was extremely high, causing him to let out a wailing scream.

bang bang bang-

The spear touched his body, but did not penetrate it directly.

It seemed that because the quality of the battle suit he was wearing was very good, at this time, he was directly knocked out just because of the powerful impact.

When the ‘hunter’ who was fighting against Liu Pan saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

He never imagined that his companion would be defeated like this!

“Where are you looking!!!”

At this moment, Liu Pan with red eyes roared and the double-sided axe in both hands attacked the man again!

There were already many wounds on Liu Pan’s body and blood flowed from his arms to the weapon in his hand.

But even so, he didn’t seem to feel the pain caused by the wound on his body at all. He was still holding the double-sided axe in his hand and frantically attacking the man’s body!

Damn it! Is this fat guy crazy!

Originally, this ‘hunter’ thought that Liu Pan could be easily dealt with, but Liu Pan’s relentless attack method was really terrifying.

As long as he could cause harm to the ‘hunter’, Liu Pan completely disregarded his physical damage.

This was definitely something only a lunatic can do.

On Lin Xiu’s side, the ‘hunter’ was already frantically rolling on the ground, trying to put out the flames on his body.

But the flames released by Lin Xiu were too terrifying and there was no way to put them out.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu appeared in front of his eyes again.

boom–

The long spear pointed at his head and stabbed it directly!

With a dull sound, the spear head pierced through his entire head!

He widened his eyes, his body trembled and he completely softened.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for killing a master warrior and gaining experience...”

At the same time, a system prompt sounded in Lin Xiu’s mind.

Lin Xiu didn’t look at the specific experience. He just looked at the experience bar and found that it only increased by 1%.

The total experience obtained now is only 8% and it is still far from being upgraded again.

This made Lin Xiu feel depressed.

Since being promoted to the master warrior level, the experience gained by killing a master warrior level is not too much.

It really hurts.

Not far away, Qian Lin and An Qi were still in a daze.

Both of them seemed stunned.

Just now Lin Xiu was clearly ‘dead’, but he didn’t expect it to be fake.

And under Lin Xiu’s counterattack, this master warrior-level ‘hunter’ was also killed by Lin Xiu!

How much power did he hide!?

Thinking this way, they all felt that Lin Xiu became more and more mysterious.

At this time, Lin Xiu looked to the other side and found that Liu Pan was still fighting.

“Don’t come to help!”

At this moment, Liu Pan seemed to sense something, then roared loudly.

Lin Xiu, who really wanted to help Liu Pan kill this warrior, was startled.

“I want to kill this son of a bitch with my own hands...”

Fat Liu shouted loudly.

At this moment, the crimson color in his eyes became even darker.

Lin Xiu, are you alright?

At this time, An Qi and Qian Lin, who had come to their senses, also walked to Lin Xiu’s side and said.

“Your arm is bleeding.”

Qian Lin looked at Lin Xiu’s right hand and said aloud.

Lin Xiu looked at his right arm and there seemed to be a bloodstain.
