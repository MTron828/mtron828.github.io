Chapter 1129: Time to Leave

How did he do that?!

Bai Lin’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

If he guessed correctly, the man who just flew through the net must also be the one who barged into the forbidden ground.

“Where do you think you’re going?!”

!! CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Bai Lin screamed. He quickly shifted his body and leaped into the air!

He was quick. With a blink of an eye, he was already next to Lin Xiu who had flown through the net.

“Hmm?”

Lin Xiu turned around and saw Bai Lin who was flying close to him.

Bai Lin reached out his arm, about to grab Lin Xiu’s body.

However, Lin Xiu managed to easily dodge it by slightly moving his body sideways.

“Get down here!”

Bai Lin screamed as he waved his right hand. Then, there was huge claw that appeared and it was headed toward Lin Xiu’s body.

It was about to capture Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frown when he saw how there was a huge arm formed by Bai Lin’s source energy that was getting closer.

Then, Lin Xiu started using his own source energy as well!

As the energy in Lin Xiu’s body gets blasted off, the huge claw that was formed by Bai Lin’s source energy was completely destroyed.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was about to escape from his huge claw, the look in Bai Lin’s eyes changed.

However, with his quick reaction speed, he still managed to threw a hard punch onto Lin Xiu.

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered and this time, he did not dodge the attack.

Then, there was a huge current that appeared on his right fist.

Boom – –

As he swung his fist, there was a huge explosion that occurred as it collided with Bai Lin’s fist!

With the powerful energy coming from Lin Xiu, Bai Lin felt the huge impact.

Then, his entire body fell to the ground.

Lin Xiu flew in the opposite direction without ever turning back.

He left from the forbidden grounds.

“Where did he go?!”

Bai Qi had just gotten out of the tunnel and he was screaming in rage.

When he looked up, he saw Bai Lin’s body falling from the sky.

Bai Lin only managed to steady his body seconds before he reached the ground.

Pfft – –

Then, he spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Master…..I was too weak. He got away…”

When Bai Lin saw Bai Qi, who had just come out of the tunnel, he quickly wiped off the blood from the corner of his mouth.

“It’s not your fault.”

Bai Qi answered him with a cold tone.

His eyes remained locked onto the sky and he had a horrible look on his face.

He had no more chance left for him to catch Lin Xiu now.

But, no matter how difficult it gets, he would have to capture Lin Xiu.

“Where did it go?”

Lin Xiu flew in the opposite direction.

He flew close to one of the galleries and started walking in the other direction.

The Bai family’s abilities were strong. Plus, he had just regained his body. He hasn’t been able to fully adapt to it. It wasn’t a good idea for him to be in a fight now.

“You’re back?”

When Lin Xiu headed back to the Divine Domain, the man that he saw before spoke respectfully to Lin Xiu.

Until now, this man still thought that Lin Xiu was someone sent by the City Lord of the Divine Domain for some special mission.

He looked at Lin Xiu and noticed that he was no longer wearing the armour from before, which made him a little suspicious.

“En. I just finished the mission.”

Lin Xiu answered calmly.

“I will need to go back to report myself to the City Lord.”

“Alright. Over here.”

The man nodded his head before answering Lin Xiu.

Then he guided Lin Xiu to the teleportation device.

As the man activated the teleportation device, the device that was dull previously, started shining brightly.

“Oh….could you please return the tablet to me?”

The man suddenly thought of something and he quickly asked.

“I am just doing according to the rules.”

“No.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“Well, it’s mine now.”

With that said, Lin Xiu’s figure instantly appeared inside the teleportation device.

“You…”

The look in the man’s eyes changed drastically.

He tried to grab Lin Xiubut soon noticed that the entire teleportation device had been teleported along with Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

Following that, there was a huge explosion from the device.

The entire thing has been destroyed!

The man’s body was then thrown far into the distance because of the impact from the explosion.

Pfft – –

There was fresh blood that came out of his mouth.

His eyes were opened wide and he couldn’t believe what had just happened.

He didn’t understand why Lin Xiu had destroyed the teleportation device.

Just when he was still feeling confused, there were footsteps that came from outside.

A large group of warriors from the Bai family had arrived!

“Where is he?!”

Bai Lin, who led the group of warriors, saw the man who was lying on the ground. Then, he grabbed the man by his collar and asked for Lin Xiu’s whereabouts.

“Elder…..Elder Bai, who are you looking for…”

The man obviously knew who Bai Lin was and his body trembled as he asked.

“This man!”

One of the warriors standing next to Bai Lin pulled out a card and showed it to the man.

The man was shocked when he saw the person on the card.

This man…..was Lin Xiu who had just left!

“He….had just returned to the Domain Lord through the teleportation device…”

The man quickly answered.

“Divine Domain?”

“Hmph! The Divine Domain has already been destroyed!”

Bai Lin told the man the cold truth.

Destroyed?!

The man was in shock.

As he thought of what happened earlier, there were chills running down his spine.

The Divine Domain that was extremely powerful has been destroyed.

But…..he didn’t know about it.

He even thought that Lin Xiu was someone sent by the Domain Lord.

“Damn it! The teleportation device has been destroyed.”

Bai Lin threw the man on the ground. Just when he stepped on the device, his face turned gloomy.

It was obvious now that Lin Xiu had left a small amount of energy here in order to destroy the device after he left.

“Get everyone here and fix this device!”

Bai Lin screamed at his men.

“Yes, Sir!”

The rest of them quickly answered.

“Huuuu~~ It’s finally over.”

At the same time, Lin Xiu had returned to the Divine Domain.

Looking at the teleportation device, Lin Xiu wanted to destroy it but after thinking about it, he decided against it.

The teleportation device on the other side has been destroyed. It would not be that easy for them to repair it.

“By the time you guys come over, it’s time for you to present me with some EXP.”

Lin Xiu smiled as he thought about it.

There were no warriors left in the Divine Domain Mansion.

Lin Xiu walked out of the place and sat cross-legged on the ground.

Although his body has been successfully regenerated, there was still some energy from the Holy Water left in him that still has not been completely absorbed.

In other words, Lin Xiu’s body now was a flask made of the Holy Water that was also filled with Holy Water at the same time.

As he used his ‘Cultivation Technique’, he started slowly absorbing the energy in his body.

Now, the energy in his body was finally getting more stabilized.

Once he had completely balanced the energy in his body, Lin Xiu finally opened his eyes and started practicing with his long spear.

As the long spear moved with his arm, the body that he had just built was slowly getting adapted to it.

For the next few days, Lin Xiu continued cultivating.

Until one day, in the middle of day, there was a loud explosion that could be heard everywhere.

Then, there were loud footsteps that came from outside the mansion.

“Oh? They’re here already?”

Lin Xiu smiled when he heard those footsteps.
