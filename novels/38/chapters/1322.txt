1323 Are You Qualified to Command Me?

While Lin Xiu rushed over, the White Moon spear in his hand danced in the air.

A large number of flaming birds burst out directly from the spears.

Yang Tiantong looked at the flaming birds charging towards him, a sneer appeared on the corner of his mouth.

He used his movement skills, quickly dodged and stabbed toward Lin Xiu with the long sword in his hand!

!!

Whoosh—

As his long sword stabbed over, there seemed to be a whooshing sound piercing in the air.

Dang–

At this moment, Lin Xiu stopped waving the spear, holding the end of the spear with both hands, then blocked his attack with the barrel of the spear.

His sword seems to have a very strong sword energy.

Although Lin Xiu resisted, he clearly felt a tingling sensation from his arm.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and the strength of his body burst out.

Yang Tiantong’s body was instantly sent flying.

“Damn it!”

Yang Tiantong, who was thrown out by the impact, cursed angrily and quickly stabilized himself.

He didn’t suffer any harm.

At this time, his eyes turned to the other side and he saw Yuan Zhen attacking Lin Xiu with a pair of hammer.

very good!

Looking at this scene, the corners of Yang Tiantong’s mouth curled up.

As long as the two of them work together, Lin Xiu will definitely be the first to be killed!

At this time, Lin Xiu couldn’t help frowning when he saw Yuan Zhen attacking him with a pair of hammer.

The spear collided with his double hammer and he really felt a powerful force.

But Lin Xiu always felt that Yuan Zhen didn’t seem to be fighting seriously.

strange.

“Very good, you hold him back, here I come!”

Yang Tiantong looked at Yuan Zhen who was fighting and laughed loudly at this moment.

His body skills continued to be displayed, like phantoms, appearing in front of Lin Xiu in an instant.

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu snorted coldly. While blocking Yuan Zhen’s attack, his body retreated directly to the back.

Whoosh—

Yang Tiantong, who rushed to Lin Xiu again, waved the long sword in the air and a powerful sword energy burst out.

With the appearance of this sword energy, even the surrounding space seemed to be pierced.

Lin Xiu didn’t dodge, the source strength of his body was concentrated on the White Moon spear in his hand and he stabbed directly at the sword energy that was coming over!

boom–

With a loud sound, Lin Xiu’s body retreated directly to the back and a mouthful of blood suddenly appeared at the corner of his mouth.

“die!!!”

Watching this scene, Yang Tiantong was overjoyed and continued to stab with the long sword in his hand.

Originally, he was a little jealous of Lin Xiu, but now the strength Lin Xiu has shown is really mediocre.

He is confident that this sword can kill Lin Xiu.

“Yuan Zhen, come on!!!”

The moment the long sword in his hand stabbed out, because of the powerful source strength gathering on the sword, it immediately turned blood red.

Even if he resisted this sword, he would not be able to move within a second.

Yuan Zhen can kill Lin Xiu if he directly attacks Lin Xiu in this second!

“These guys are too shameless.”

Lei Tong clenched his hands as he watched the battle on the battle platform.

It was obviously a three-person melee, but now it has almost become two against one!

“Hmph, you won’t win even if you play small tricks.”

Baili Haoling also said in a cold voice at this time.

“I told you, the chances of winning are not great.”

The middle-aged man looked at this scene, narrowed his eyes slightly and said aloud as if he was talking to himself while stroking his beard.

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked at Yang Tiantong’s stabbing sword and the pupils in his eyes shrank involuntarily.

This guy, so rampant?

He dared to directly use this powerful skill that consumes a lot of energy to attack him!

Lin Xiu’s face became gloomy.

“die!”

...

And at the next moment, the long sword in Yuan Zhen’s hand directly penetrated Lin Xiu’s body!

Looking at this scene, Yang Tiantong just showed joy on his face.

But at the next moment, his smile froze.

Because the penetrated ‘Lin Xiu’ did not shed any blood at all.

Poof——

And this ‘Lin Xiu’ exploded directly as if it wasn’t Lin Xiu who was hit, but an inflatable person. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Damn it!!!

Yang Tiantong’s face became extremely ugly. After looking around, he found five identical Lin Xius appearing in all directions!

And these Lin Xiu’s auras are all exactly the same.

Because Lin Xiu used the ‘Disguise’ skill, it always made people feel that his strength was very low.

At this moment, although the avatar has less than half of the strength of the main body, he still has no way of feeling which one is Lin Xiu’s real avatar.

...

Boom——

The next moment, the White Moon spears in the hands of the five ‘Lin Xiu’ all burst into dark blue flames.

Directly attacked Yang Tiantong!

Looking at this scene, Yang Tiantong couldn’t help but have a change of expression.

“Yuan Zhen, what are you doing!”

Out of the corner of Yang Tiantong’s eye, seeing Yuan Zhen on the other side, he roared angrily.

At this moment, Yuan Zhen was standing there, seemingly not making any movements.

It’s like watching a good show.

“Are you qualified to command me?”

At this moment, the corners of Yuan Zhen’s mouth curled up and he said lightly.

“you…”

Yang Tiantong’s expression changed.

This Yuan Zhen is not the same as before. At this moment, he looks full of arrogance.

Damn, this guy tricked me!

“‘Sphere’!!!”

At this moment, seeing ‘Lin Xiu’ attacking with a spear from all directions, he had no way to dodge.

With no other choice at this time, he directly unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

As the ‘Sphere’ unfolded, the white moon spears held by these ‘Lin Xiu’ directly pierced his ‘Sphere’.

Loud noises erupted.

Because White Moon spear was full of hellfire, as the tip of the spear pierced his ‘Sphere’, Yang Tiantong’s ‘Sphere’ seemed to start to melt.

Yang Tiantong’s face inside the ‘Sphere’ became extremely ugly.

Because not only did he feel the powerful impact, but also because of the extremely high temperature of the flame, he felt as if he was going to be burned.

“what!!!”

At this moment, Yang Tiantong roared crazily.

The veins on his whole body seemed to be bulging.

Taking a closer look at this moment, there is a blood-red source mark on his forehead, blooming!

What kind of source mark power is this!?

It was the first time Lin Xiu to see the power of this blood-red source mark and the pupils in his eyes couldn’t help shrinking.

“I see you!”

Yang Tiantong noticed that the expression in the eyes of one of the ‘Lin Xiu’ had changed obviously. At this moment, he roared angrily and waved the blood-red long sword in his hand!

A powerful force rushed out of the ‘Sphere’ directly!
