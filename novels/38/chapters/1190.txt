1191 It Should Be Getting Interesting Soon.

When Baili Haoling saw the black spear that appeared on Lin Xiu’s hands, she was a little stunned.

This was Dark Edge?

She was the one who Lin Xiu the Dark Edge.

But now, the spear had countless white marks on it and the spear looked incredibly different.

!!

Plus, there seems to be a mysterious power around the spear.

Seeing how the rest of them were surrounding him, Lin Xiunarrowed his eyes.

Then, the long spear that was the centre of attention was suddenly swung in the air.

There was a terrifying force of energy that formed a huge arc and it expanded quickly to the rest of the crowd!

Boom boom boom – –

The warriors who had rushed forward were pushed back by the impact from the horrifying energy.

They had released their ‘sphere’s but the energy that Lin Xiu had released was too overpowering.

All of their ‘spheres’ instantly exploded!

Not only that, the horrifying energy instantly blasted their bodies into two halves.

How is this even possible?!

When Mr Lui saw what happened, his eyes were filled with disbelief as well. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

All Lin Xiu did was swing his weapon and all of his men were killed?

“Kill him! Kill him right now!!!!”

Mr Lui was now looking a little crazy.

So many of his men had died so suddenly and this was indeed a huge blow to him.

The rest of the warriors standing next to Mr Lui quickly rushed forward.

Lin Xiu let out a cold laugh seeing how they were still trying to attack him. He shifted his body and appeared right in front of the warriors.

He swung his long spear once again and all of the warriors along with their ‘spheres’ were split into two.

The other side was completely defeated.

Little Bai was still blowing out large breaths of white, cold frost.

The ground around them was covered with a thick layer of ice.

As for the warriors who were killed or defeated, all of them became an ice statue because of the cold breath of the Ice Crystal White Blood.

As for Rollie, who was standing next to Baili Haoling, its body was bloated like an inflated balloon.

Soon, it became incredibly huge.

Rollie looked like a huge white ball.

Then, its mouth was opened wide.

The huge mouth was like a dark hole.

All of the warriors that have become an ice statue were all being sucked into his mouth like it was eating beans.

“This…..this…..”

Mr Lui looked at what had happened right in front of him. His fingers pointed at the beasts and his body started trembling.

He didn’t think that things would turn out this way!!

“Hmph! A bunch of idiots.”

Baili Haoling looked at Mr Lui and there was a sarcastic smirk on her face.

“Well, you are next.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he stared at Mr Lui.

With the long spear in his hands, he slowly walked towards Mr Lui, who was standing in front of him.

“Do you know who owns this place?! You’re dead!!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was getting closer to him, Mr Lui’s body started trembling.

He started screaming as he stepped backwards.

“Oh? Who is it?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows and sneered.

Since he dared to kill these warriors, he definitely wouldn’t be afraid of the man who owns this place.

It would be best if they come looking for him. It would be gifts of EXP presented to him.

“He is the younger brother of Manhuang City’s city lord! I am the one in charge of overseeing his businesses. If you dare lay hands on me, you will die!”

Mr Lui screamed on top of his lungs.

He thought that Lin Xiu would be afraid after hearing it but he didn’t think that Lin Xiu was still walking toward him.

There was still a faint smile that was on his face.

It looked like this man didn’t care about what Mr Lui had just said.

“He is the…”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was standing right in front of him, his eyes were filled with fear.

His body shivered but before he could say anything, he saw a sharp, bright ray that appeared before his eyes.

Before he could react, there was a warm fluid that came rushing out of his head.

One strike KO.

It was only one strike and Lin Xiu was able to pierce the long spear straight through his head.

Mr Lui’s eyes were wide open but until the moment that he died, he still had no idea how he died.

“I didn’t think that this place belonged to the younger brother of the city lord.”

Baili Haoling commented about the new piece of news that they have just received.

“Looks like we’re in trouble.”

Baili Haoling said helplessly.

She didn’t like trouble but sometimes, she couldn’t help it when they came running to her.

She would be able to kill them all with both her short dagger!

“How long have you been here?”

Lin Xiu asked Baili Haoling about something that he had always been curious,.

“About a month?”

Baili Haoling answered.

“You already had such powers when you only stayed here for a month?”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were opened wide as he was feeling shocked.

It took a long time for him to become a warrior god. He killed countless warriors and evolved beasts in order to become a warrior god.

The last time when he returned to earth, Baili Haoling’s strength was obviously much weaker than it is now.

She was progressing faster than Lin Xiu who had an uprank system.

“Hehehe….it’s just that the powers in my body have been awakened.”

Baili Haoling chuckled.

“The power of your body?”

Lin Xiu was surprised.

This was the first time that he had heard of such things.

“En. Due to how my ancestors are someone extremely powerful, as his descendants, I would also inherit their powers as well.”

“But, it’s not that everyone in my family would get such awakenings. I was the one in a million members that got it which was why they brought me here to further cultivate my strengths.”

Baili Haoling explained to Lin Xiu about her current situation.

“I’m really curious. Your ancestors…..what level are they? Warrior gods?”

Lin Xiu asked out of curiosity.

As his levels get higher, Lin Xiu was clear that there are many more people out in this universe that were stronger than him.

Back then,he thought that Baili Haoling’s ancestor was a rank 9 warrior who was at its peak but now it was obvious that he had underestimated them.

“Is he still here in the warrior god realm?”

“They? They have already left.”

Baili Haoling pursed her lips.

“They left me here and went missing. If it wasn’t because I met you, I would have been really bored here.”

“Let’s go. It should be getting interesting soon.”

Lin Xiu looked at Baili Haoling.

Little Bai was flapping its wings and it looked excited.

As for Rollie, it burped. Then, it started deflating like a huge balloon and slowly returned to its original state.
