1253 Go Back and Drink Tea

Boom–

In the next moment, the frosty giant sword directly slashed at the energy barrier!

At this moment, the entire energy barrier seemed to shake slightly.

Just when Liu Cheng thought that the energy barrier was about to be broken, the look in his eyes changed drastically.

Not broken!

This energy barrier was not broken!

And not only was it not broken, there was not even the slightest damage to the energy barrier.

there weren’t even any cracks!

This is impossible!

Liu Cheng roared in his heart.

When he swung his sword just now, even the space was broken, but now he can’t cause even a single crack in the energy barrier!?

Liu Cheng felt that his heart had been hit. At this time, he frantically held the huge sword in his hand and waved it at the energy barrier.

Dangdangdang——

There were incomparably loud sounds and the energy barrier seemed to vibrate slightly under Liu Cheng’s constant attacks.

But there was no damage at all.

There isn’t even a single crack.

“It seems that the energy barrier built by Lei Tong is really good.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked at this scene and couldn’t help saying aloud.

“En.”

Baili Haoling also nodded slightly.

Looking at Liu Cheng, who was still madly attacking the energy barrier, there was also fear in his eyes.

Liu Cheng frantically swiped the giant frosty sword and attacked, causing a large number of space cracks to appear in the surrounding space.

It’s really terrifying.

“What shall we do next?”

Looking at Liu Cheng who was still madly attacking the energy barrier, he spoke to Lin Xiu.

“Go back and drink tea.”

Lin Xiu shrugged.

He looked at Liu Cheng and he could clearly feel that Liu Cheng’s power was very strong.

Without ‘Fury’, it was still a little dangerous.

Most importantly, if this person cannot be killed directly, the threat to Lingxian City is too great.

The entire Lingxian City might be destroyed by him.

“I want to see when he would break this energy barrier.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

Now he can already feel that this energy barrier is very hard.

“Lei Tong, you said that even if this energy barrier is deployed all the time, it can last at least a year, right?”

Lin Xiu said to Lei Tong at the bottom.

“Yes! At least one year!!!”

Lei Tong said confidently. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Although he was shocked by Liu Cheng’s strength, Lei Tong was still full of confidence in his energy barrier.

“Well, let’s go back and drink tea.”

Lin Xiu didn’t even look at Liu Cheng and said lightly.

Then he returned directly to his City Lord’s Mansion.

Time passed and a week passed quickly.

Liu Cheng was still frantically attacking the energy barrier as if he wasn’t tired at all.

And Lin Xiu, at this time, is flying in the sky sitting on Xiaobai’s back.

A table was placed on Xiaobai’s broad back and he was drinking tea while looking at Liu Cheng who was only isolated by an energy barrier.

“Oh, it’s been so many days, why hasn’t it been breached yet?”

Lin Xiu took a sip of tea and said to Liu Cheng who was still swinging his sword wildly.

Baili Haoling was drinking tea at this time and when she heard Lin Xiu say that on purpose, she almost spit out a mouthful of water.

“Your words will probably piss him off.”

Baili Haoling smiled and said.

“He can’t come in anyway.”

Lin Xiu said calmly as before.

Although isolated by an energy barrier, Liu Cheng was able to hear Lin Xiu’s words.

...

At this time, Liu Cheng completely exploded and the strength of his whole body burst out at this moment.

Frantically attacking the energy barrier.

The same is true for the white tiger.

“Lei Tong, get ready, I’m going out.”

Lin Xiu said to Lei Tong who was standing below and was already ready.

“You can just wait here, I will deal with him personally.”

Seeing that Baili Haoling was also about to move, Lin Xiu said lightly.

“yes!”

Lei Tong, who was below, heard Lin Xiu’s carefulness and immediately pressed a button on the remote control in his hand.

Click——

As he pressed it down and wiped it, a crisp sound suddenly sounded.

...

Lin Xiu’s figure rushed directly toward the energy barrier!

This switch is the switch that allows people inside the energy barrier to rush out.

As Lin Xiu rushed out, the Dark Edge spear instantly appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand!

Liu Cheng clearly saw Lin Xiu’s figure and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

“Die!!!”

In the past few days, while Liu Cheng was constantly attacking the energy barrier, Lin Xiu was constantly mocking and sarcastic.

Over the past few days, Liu Cheng’s hatred for Lin Xiu has accumulated to a certain extent.

The giant frosty sword held in both hands slashed toward Lin Xiu!

The speed of his sword was extremely fast and the explosive power was also very powerful. It was obvious that he will split Lin Xiu in half!

DAng–

Lin Xiu snorted coldly. At this moment, he held the Dark Edge spear in both hands to resist and made a clear and crisp sound in an instant.

There was an extremely icy aura in his frosty giant sword, which was transmitted to the body of Lin Xiu’s spear.

It made Lin Xiu feel like his fingers holding the spear would be frozen.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and with a thought, the entire barrel of the spear was filled with dark blue flames.

The hands holding the Dark Edge spear exerted force again and the frosty giant sword he had hacked bounced away.

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

While shaking his Frosty Giant Sword away, Lin Xiu directly used a skill!

The Dark Edge spear with dark blue flames stabbed towards Liu Cheng frantically.

At this moment, with a lot of piercing sounds, thousands of spear shadows pierced out!

Liu Cheng’s complexion changed drastically and the frosty giant sword in his hand instantly burst into dazzling white light.

At the next moment, the huge sword became extremely large, blocking Liu Cheng like a shield.

Bang bang bang——

The tip of the spear pierced the blade of the frosty giant sword and a strange sound erupted.

This frosty giant sword does not look like a giant sword made of metal at all.

Under the attack of Lin Xiu’s ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’, the magnified Frosty Sword remained motionless.

“Get lost!”

And at this moment, Liu Cheng let out a roar.

The Frosty Giant Sword once again burst into dazzling white light.

That light formed an incomparably terrifying energy ray, which directly charged towards Lin Xiu!

what is this!?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s pupils couldn’t help shrinking.

The body subconsciously unfolded the ‘Sphere’!

Boom——

Impacted by this energy ray, Lin Xiu felt that his ‘Sphere’ was violently shaken and his whole body flew out!

“Lin Xiu!”
