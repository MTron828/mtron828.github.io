1463 Explosives!

Both of them rushed towards Ling Tianxi and wanted to kill her first!

Both the long sword and spear were thrusted forward.

Boom!

However, both of them were stopped as their weapons hit on an invisible barrier.

There was a loud sound that followed.

Both Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were forced to take a few steps backwards.

“With me here, you will never be able to breach these areas!”

Xia Huang sneered as he stared at Lin Xiu from above.

There was an obvious black mark on his forehead.

It was clear that Xia Guang was using the energy from his spatial source mark!

Plus, along with how he was an expert in controlling these spatial abilities, the entire place was now covered with an overpowering spatial force.

It was impossible to get in or come out!

“Is that so?”

Lin Xiu let out a cold smile.

Then, the Spatial Cube appeared in his palm.

Lin Xiu then flushed his energy into the Spatial Cube. Then, it started spinning almost instantly.

Soon, there was a bright light that appeared before them.

There was a gap that appeared as well!

Xiu – –

Lin Xiu then rushed through the gap!

The Spatial Cube!

Xia Guang’s pupil shrunk in disbelief.

He had indeed forgotten about this.

Xia Guang then had a horrible look on his face.

Lin Xiu ignored the other God king and went directly after Ling Tianxi with his spear!

“Move!”

Ling Tianxi roared in rage.

Then, there were waves of water that rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Instead of dodging it, Lin Xiu sneered instead.

The long spear in his hands then started spinning like mad.

Boom boom – –

With the long spear moving, there were countless flaming birds that were headed right for Ling Tianxi.

As soon as the golden flaming birds were released, the air around them was scorched and looked twisted almost instantly.

The next moment, these flaming birds came into contact with the water.

Splash – –

Ling Tianxi then heard the water getting evaporated.

Her eyes were opened wide when the water evaporated.

They were filled with shock.

This was because Lin Xiu’s flames now have the ability to evaporate the waters that she controlled!

Lin Xiu ignored her and continued attacking her with his long spear!

He was standing right in front of Lin Xiu.

The tip of the long spear was about to pierce through his head.

She quickly shifted her body and dodged the attack.

Lin Xiu had missed his attack.

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered. When he turned around, he noticed that Ling Tianxi had gotten away with it.

He waved his spear once again and then, there was another rush of golden flaming birds going after Ling Tianxi.

All of them were coming at him at a particularly fast speed.

It was getting extremely hot!

These flames that were released were much stronger than the ones that he had before.

“Kill him!!!”

Ling Tianxi did not have the guts to go against Lin Xiu now.

She then turned to the other God Kings for help.

Then, Huangfu Yuansheng and Xia Guang joined the fight.

They immediately stopped Lin Xiu’s attack!

Huangfu Yuansheng and Xia Guang each had a sword in their hands and they collided with Lin Xiu’s spear.

Clang clang clang – –

As their weapons collided, there were countless loud explosions heard around them.

At the same time, Luo Yue held onto her sword and went after Ling Tianxi.

She wanted to kill Ling Tianxi first.

Clang – –

But, as the sword in her hand got closer, Hetian God King appeared out of nowhere and stopped her.

His machete then instantly collided with Luo Yue’s sword.

There was a crisp sound heard.

“Luo Yue! How dare you kill me?!”

Ling Tianxi looked at Luo Yue with her black sword. Seeing how Luo Yue had wanted to kill her, Ling Tianxi was furious.

Luo Yue ignored her. Then, with the sword in her hand, she continued attacking the Hetian God King.

“Hmph! Since you don’t want to marry me, you shall die too!”

Hetian God King had a furious expression on his face and as he waved his machete.

“Kill all of those who are on earth!”

Ling Tianxi shouted once again.

The other God Kings then continued damaging the earth with their overpowering warrior skills.

The ninth rank warriors could do nothing against these God Kings!

“MOVE!!!!!”

Lin Xiu was infuriated at this point.

There were countless flames that were released from the long spear.

The rest of the God Kings didn’t dare to get close to Lin Xiu because of the Flames of Chaos.

Xia Guang and Huangfu Yuanshen were also dodging the flames.

Then, Lin Xiu quickly rushed forward.

He was as quick as lightning and went straight after the God King who was destroying earth!

Clang – –

The warrior looked at how Lin Xiu was suddenly coming after him and how the long spear was getting closer to him. The God King was shocked and quickly tried to defend himself with his machete. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

‘Rage!!!’

‘Heavenly Array!!!’

Lin Xiu immediately used both the skills from his system.

As these skills were released, Lin Xiu offences became even scarier.

He had thrusted forward a thousand times with his spear!

The God King had released his ‘sphere’. The tip of the long spear that was covered with the Flame of Chaos continuously attacked his ‘sphere’ and there were countless explosions that followed.

Then, his ‘spear’ was destroyed by Lin Xiu!

Pfft – –

He spat out a mouthful of blood instantly.

Before the God King could react, there were already numerous bloody holes on his body.

He was definitely dead!

The God King’s physical body has been destroyed but his spirits were still around.

Lin Xiu then instantly activated ‘Engulf’ as soon as he saw the blue energy coming out of the God King’s body.

With that, all of the energy from the God King has been absorbed by Lin Xiu.

HE’S DEAD?!

Huangfu Yuanshen and Xia Guang then finally realised that Lin Xiu had already killed a God King!
