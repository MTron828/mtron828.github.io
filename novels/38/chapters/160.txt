Chapter 161: Fighting Yuyi!

The weapon Yu Yi used was a long sword.

His long sword was a bit different from normal long swords, it appeared a little wider.

And there were special patterns on it which looked gorgeous.

Dang dang dang——

As Lin Xiu rushed over and the spear pierced toward Yu Yi’s body, Yu Yi moved easily and completely resisted Lin Xiu’s attack.

“If you’re only at this level, you’re not a threat to me at all.” Yu Yi seemed at ease at this moment, waving a long sword in his hand, and easily dodged all the attacks.

There was already a large number of people around the huge screen at the bottom of the tower, watching the live broadcast of Lin Xiu vs. Yu Yi!

“Yu Yi!? It’s Yu Yi, the second-year student on the top 100 list!?”

When they saw the warrior going against Lin Xiu, the people around began exclaiming in shock.

There were more than 2,000 people in the second year of the Sacred Region Academy. All of them were elites, but those who were on the top 100 list were extremely strong.

“It seems that this freshman just entered the 20th floor. What a pity. I thought there would really be a record-breaking freshman who could break through to the 21st floor in one fell swoop.” Seeing the live broadcast, some people could not help but sigh regretfully.

Rank 3 vs. rank 5? This was nothing suspenseful at all!

“If he can win this time, I’ll eat the floor.” The man wearing the goggles sneered at this moment.

“Qixing! A guy has also reached the 20th floor!” At the same time, on the other side, a man rushed to Zhuo Qixing’s side and said, panting.

“Is he from our Clas 1?” Zhuo Qixing was tapping the keyboard at this moment, searching for some information.

“No, he’s not.” The man shook his head, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“Judging from your expression, is he from Class 2?” Zhuo Qixing said lightly.

When he was on the 20th floor, that second-year guy was indeed very powerful. He went all out and almost won, which made him feel a bit unfortunate.

“He’s from Class 10!”

“Class 10!?” Hearing his words, Zhuo Qixing’s gaze changed.

Of course, he also noticed that in the Sacred Region Academy, classes were assigned according to their strength.

According to reason, the combat strength of the students in Class 10 should be relatively weak, but how could this person reach the 20th floor?

Although luck played a part as well, one couldn’t rely on luck to ascent this Tower of Tournament.

“That’s interesting.” The corners of Zhuo Qixing’s mouth raised slightly and he tapped on the keyboard. Soon, he opened the live broadcast of the Tower of Tournament.

Lin Xiu was still fighting Yu Yi at this time.

But his speed seemed very slow in Yu Yi’s eyes, and he appeared to be playing a game, catching all his attacks easily.

Was this the difference between a rank 5 warrior and him?

He’s really strong!

Lin Xiu didn’t have any fear at this time, instead, he got more and more courageous.

‘Awe of the phoenix’!!!

The current Awe of the phoenix was only the strength of a Silver skill. Lin Xiu had been focused on training his physical strength recently and somewhat disregarded the practice of skills.

‘Awe of the phoenix’ was a skill card that could improve in rank and it had now become a Gold skill. After the battle, he must find an opportunity to continue practicing.

“What skill is this!?” Yu Yi saw Lin Xiu’s spear volley in the air and flaming birds flew out all of a sudden!

“Is this some kind of spear art?!” Those watching the live broadcast were taken aback by Lin Xiu’s skill.

Some of the students who used spears were astonished.

Yu Yi frowned. He also felt that the temperature of these flaming birds seemed to be extremely high. If he got hit accidentally, they would probably burn his clothes off.

Just when he dodged, these flaming birds seemed to be tracking their target and they followed him closely!

What!? The pupils in Yu Yi’s eyes constricted and he couldn’t use his strength, his body skills were activated and he dodged instantly!

Bang bang bang——

A series of flaming birds hit the stone slab on the arena, making a crashing sound.

This guy was really fast when he’s serious!

But…

Lin Xiu stared at Yu Yi, who was constantly dodging the flaming birds he released. In the next moment, the pupils in his eyes constricted slightly.

Found it!

“[Torrential storm of rose flowers]!!!” Lin Xiu rushed to the corner in front as soon as he exerted force on his legs!

Without any hesitation, he used the skill directly!

The spear suddenly appeared like a black dragon, turning into many shadows!

“Why did he attack there for?” The students who watched the match looked at Lin Xiu’s movements and were puzzled.

But then, a shocking scene happened!

When Yu Yi evaded the last flaming bird attack, his figure flashed and he reached the area where Lin Xiu had attacked!

The tip of the spear was about to pierce his body!

Yu Yi’s eyes widened and his reaction ability was extremely terrifying. At this moment, he swiftly resisted with a long sword.

Dang dang dang——

Even so, one of Lin Xiu’s attacks still managed to pierce a hole through his shirt, cutting his shoulder.

A trace of blood flowed out in an instant.

“Get out!!!” Yu Yi was furious at this moment.

He didn’t expect that he would be injured and bleeding, and Lin Xiu was merely a rank 3 warrior!!!

Enraged, the source strength in his body suddenly surged and a huge impact made Lin Xiu’s body fly out!

Boom——

Lin Xiu’s body fell heavily at the back of the arena and he almost fell off.

Pff—— Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

After receiving the impact just now, Lin Xiu also felt a tightness in his chest and there was a sweetness in his throat as a mouthful of blood came out.

“I’m not mistaken, right… he just hit Yu Yi?” The students below, watching the live broadcast on the big screen, couldn’t help but open their mouths in disbelief.

Yu Yi, the rank 5 warrior at his peak, was actually injured!?

He was even stabbed by a rank 3 warrior!

“How did you do it?” Yu Yi said with a gloomy expression at this time, looking at Lin Xiu who was standing up slowly.

The tingling sensation from his shoulder made it clear that it was real – a rank 5 warrior was actually stabbed by a rank 3 warrior!!!

Disgraceful! This was disgraceful!
