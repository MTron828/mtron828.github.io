1211 The Odd Divine Soul

Both the evolved beasts were staring at the warriors as if they were warning them.

However, after hearing what Lin Xiu said, they ran in the opposite directions after a slight moment of hesitation.

Then, they completely disappeared.

The rest of the warriors did not go after them since the only people that they wanted to kill were Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling.

“Damn it…”

The warriors who were hit earlier by Lin Xiu’s ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’ noticed that there were cracks on their ‘spheres’.

“Haoling, I will be killing that old man first. Be careful!”

Lin Xiu held onto his long spear as his eyes were locked onto the old man.

From the information received through the analytic eye, this old man was the strongest amongst them.

Once he killed this old man, everything else would be easy.

“No problem.”

Baili Haoling nodded her head. With the control of her mind, there was a large amount of energy released from her body and they gathered at both her short daggers.

Both the daggers turned blood red.

Then, Baili Haoling immediately released the spirit power that she had just acquired!

There was a red energy that gathered above Baili Haoling’s body and there were in the shape of two short daggers.

Xiu – –

At the same time, Lin Xiu suddenly disappeared into thin air.

The old man’s eyes narrowed with shock. Then, he could only move forward with his long sword by instinct.

Clang – –

Lin Xiu suddenly appeared right in front of him and the long spear collided with the sword that the old man had.

There was a huge impact that followed and the old man’s body was thrown into the distance!

How?!

How did this young boy suddenly get so powerful?!

The elder’s pupil shrunk uncontrollably. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Even if Lin Xiu had killed all the other warriors, he still felt that Lin Xiu was just average but the strength that Lin Xiu was showing right now was so much more powerful than he had expected!

Lin Xiu did not give him any chance. He quickly released ‘flashing souls’ and stood right in front of the old man.

With both hands on his long spear, Lin Xiu aimed it at the old man’s ‘sphere’!

Boom – –

With a loud sound, the ‘sphere’ that was already covered with cracks instantly exploded.

Pfft – –

As the ‘sphere’ exploded, the elder suffered from the backlash and a mouthful of blood came flushing out of his mouth.

The elder’s eyes were filled with fear.

“How dare you?!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was continuing to attack him with the long spear, the old man roared and his body was covered with a golden glow.

The glow then slowly turned into particles and they formed a golden panther that stood behind the old man.

The Divine Soul of a Golden Panther.

The old man seemed skinny and weak but as the divine soul appeared, the muscles on the old man’s body started expanding.

When Lin Xiu’s long spear got close to him, the old man moved. As he dodged the attack, he also managed to catch Lin Xiu’s spear.

The strength that came from the old man felt as if he was able to snatch the long spear away from Lin Xiu!

Such strong energy!!!

Lin Xiu’s pupils narrowed. This gold divine soul seemed to have given him a major boost in his strength!

However, Lin Xiu smiled instead.

As he controlled it with his mind, there were a large amount of dark blue flames that were released.

All of them completely covered the body of the long spear!

“AHHHHHH!!!!!”

The old man had both his hands on the long spear. When he got burnt by the dark blue flames, he cried out loud due to the pain!

He quickly let go of the long spear and took a few steps backwards.

“Did you think that I don’t have a divine soul?”

Lin Xiu sneered.

Then, as he slowly released it, there were large amounts of black particles that were released.

Slowly, all these particles gathered together and they formed a small black dragon.

Lin Xiu had no idea what’s the use of this black dragon but he didn’t care about it now. He would have to attack first!

“Leave!!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu still wanted to attack him, the old man roared.

Then, the divine soul of the black dragon that was next to Lin Xiu, seemed to be travelling faster than Lin Xiu himself!

The little black dragon aimed for the old man’s chest and it immediately pierced through his chest, leaving a bloody hole behind.

The old man’s eyes were opened wide. He looked at the hole in his chest and he couldn’t believe what he had just seen.

Lin Xiu was shocked as well.

He never thought that his divine soul would have such powerful energy.

This old man was a strong warrior god. How was it possible that the dragon pierced through his body so easily?

However, Lin Xiu did not waste anything thinking about it. He quickly stood before the old man and swung his long spear.

The old man’s head was chopped off from his body!

“Elder Jiang!”

Fu Tianling, who was still levitating in the air, was waiting for Lin Xiu to turn weak so that he could finish Lin Xiu with only one strike. However, what he saw was the opposite and he was shocked as well.

Fu Tianling has brought along one of the strongest warrior gods and he ended up getting killed?!

Lin Xiu did not have the time to check how much EXP he had received from killing the old man. He soon realised that the black dragon that he had released was chasing after the golden panther.

What were they doing?

Lin Xiu was stunned. It felt as if the divine soul of the black dragon had a thought of its own.

But….it’s something that was formed by particles?

When Lin Xiu looked at it, the black dragon opened its mouth and started biting the golden panther.

Soon, the entire panther was torn into pieces and was swallowed by the black dragon.

Lin Xiu’s eyes were stretched wide open when he saw such a peculiar scene.

However, he did not waste anything here and rushed forward.

There were still 6 other warriors who were attacking Baili Haoling. It seemed like they wanted to kill Baili Haoling first before helping the old man kill Lin Xiu.

But, they did not think that Lin Xiu would kill the old man first!

“Damn it!”

All six warrior gods assumed that they would be able to quickly kill Baili Haoling first but they didn’t expect for her to be just as strong as them!

Especially that pair of red eyes. It felt devilish. When they looked into it, their speed would get slow and their reflexes would slow down as well.

Even so, with so many warriors attacking her at the same time, Baili Haoling was still wounded.

“Go to hell!!!”

One of the warriors found the opportunity and attacked her from the back!
