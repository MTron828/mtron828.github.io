Chapter 319: Luo Yue’s Brother!

Ice Lotus Fire!

That woman actually got the Ice Lotus Fire!

When these warriors saw this scene, their bodies tensed up, their eyes fixed on Luo Yue like they wanted to pounce on her.

“Hey, I thought you guys were dead.” At this moment, a voice came from the back.

Hearing that voice, the other warriors all looked behind and saw a young man approaching.

Hua Tian?

Lin Xiu saw that the man speaking was Hua Tian. At this time, Hua Tian walked directly towards Luo Yue and stretched out his hands like he wanted to embrace her.

But at this moment, Luo Yue was already pointing a dagger at the Huatian who was getting closer to her.

“Come any closer and I will kill you.” Luo Yue said coldly as she watched him.

Lin Xiu was stunned when he saw this scene. Isn’t this Hua Tian a friend of Luo Yue?

When Lin Xiu saw his action, he was a little uncomfortable, but he didn’t expect that Luo Yue would point the knife at Huatian.

“You don’t have to do this to your older brother, right?” Hua Tian saw the sharp knife pointed at him and said helplessly.

“Hmph.” Luo Yue snorted coldly then said, “Then don’t get your dirty hands close to me.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Older brother?” Lin Xiu was stunned at this time. He had just heard very clearly that Hua Tian claimed to be Luo Yue’s brother?

“Yes, blood-related brother.” Hua Tian nodded, then smiled as if he thought of something and said, “By the way, my full name is Luo Huatian.”

“He is dangerous, let’s stay away from him.” Luo Yue looked at Luo Huatian then said to Lin Xiu who was next to her.

Lin Xiu thought it was a little odd when he heard Luo Yue’s words. Luo Huatian is Luo Yue’s elder brother, but judging by Luo Yue’s reaction, it seemed like she didn’t want to see him?

But at this moment, the surrounding warriors looked at the Ice Lotus Fire in Luo Yue’s hand and seemed a little too impatient to wait as they rushed towards her!

“Hand over the Ice Lotus Fire!”

These warriors were all rank 7 and above, they were very fast and were about to charge to Luo Yue’s side in an instant.

Luo Huatian, who was in front of Luo Yue, saw this scene. With a wave of his right hand, the thin-winged long sword on the ground flew back to his hand and he threw it directly towards Luo Yue.

“This kid brought it back for you, take it.” Luo Huatian said while he kicked a long sword on the ground with his right foot. Then, he reached out to catch the hilt of the sword in the air and directly blocked the attacks of the men.

Dang dang dang——

“Don’t pay attention to him.” Luo Yue said when she saw that Lin Xiu had just found the Dark Edge spear that he dropped before he fell into the lake and seemed to want to step forward to help.

“But…”

“These people are no match for this guy.” Luo Yue said indifferently as she looked over.

No match for him?

Lin Xiu was stunned. The people who were attacking were all warriors that were rank 7 and above!

And there were so many warriors, how could he deal with them by himself!?

What’s more, his strength was only at rank 6.

“He is different from us. He is a demon who returned from the Dark World.” Luo Yue looked at Luo Huatian who looked quite sunny there then said cautiously.

This is the second time Lin Xiu has heard the term ‘Dark World’. Are these places really so scary?

“Damn! Boy, why are you blocking the way, I’ll kill you!” Some warriors were blocked by Luo Huatian and were getting mad.

But what surprised them was that Luo Huatian, a man who seemed to be only a rank 6 warrior, actually blocked all of them.

“Hey, this Ice Lotus Fire seems to have become…” Lin Xiu looked at the Ice Lotus Fire on the square card in Luo Yue’s hand at this time and he felt that the Ice Lotus Fire seemed to be giving off spots of light that seemed to flutter in the air.

Luo Yue’s expression changed slightly when she saw this, then she sat cross-legged on the ground.

“This Ice Lotus Fire is about to disappear now.” Luo Yue’s eyes looked at the white glow that the Ice Lotus Fire gave off and it appeared very sacred.

“What should we do now?” Lin Xiu asked. Seems like the lake water ensured that the Ice Lotus Fire could survive. Now that Luo Yue has taken it out of the water, this energy couldn’t last long.

Moreover, Lin Xiu could see that at this time, there was a thin layer of frost on Luo Yue’s hands.

It was obvious that it was due to the Ice Lotus Fire.

This thing is named ‘fire’ yet it has such icy attributes, which was indeed very strange.

“You swallow it, I’ll protect you.” Lin Xiu said while looking at Luo Yue.

Luo Yue was definitely looking for this Ice Lotus Fire to absorb its energy.

Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu and he nodded.

Luo Yue did not hesitate at this time. She looked at this cluster of Ice Lotus Fire, then slowly opened her mouth.

‘Swish’ and the Ice Lotus Fire was sent directly into Luo Yue’s mouth.

“Take out the Ice Lotus Fire!!!” At this moment, the people over there saw this scene and began yelling as they charged over from another direction!

Lin Xiu saw this scene and the look on his face changed. The person who rushed to the front was the one who made him fall into the lake previously!

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s eyes were full of murderous intent and he clenched the Dark Edge spear even more tightly in his right hand.

Before the guy could attack, Lin Xiu rushed over!

“Courting death!” Seeing that Lin Xiu dared to attack him, the warrior’s face suddenly became sinister like he felt that his self-esteem had been challenged.

With a saber in his hand, he was about to chop Lin Xiu’s body!

Dang–

But Lin Xiu’s reaction was too fast. The Dark Edge spear in his hand had thrust out and it collided with the saber, making a loud noise.

“Hng!” This warrior snorted coldly and when he wanted to continue to attack, he saw a flaming bird coming directly!

Seeing this scene, his expression changed.

But he was a rank 7 warrior after all and he came to his senses quickly, then unfolded the ‘sphere’!
