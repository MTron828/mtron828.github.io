Rage Built-up: 0/1

All of his stats have improved tremendously!

Plus, there were 4000 potential points!

“Did the system go crazy…..”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but complain about it and there was a speechless look on his face.

He turned 2 thousand of them onto strength, a thousand of it onto physique and the remaining 1 thousand onto strength.

After adding these potential points, Lin Xiu felt a surge of energy in his body.

It felt comforting!

Then, Lin Xiu noticed that he was butt-naked and quickly put on his combat suit. That’s when he noticed that his entire body was now bloated.

He had absorbed too much energy from the pool.

If he continued, his entire body would explode.

As for his progress bar, he was already at 60%.

If he continued soaking himself inside the pool, he would definitely be able to break through level 74.

What a waste!

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng looked at Lin Xiu who thought of this as a waste and they had to hold the urge to punch Lin Xiu.

This fellow has been in the pool for so long and his body had already been so bloated! How much more energy does he want?!

Both their eyes turned red.

Lin Xiu did not think too much about it. He sat cross-legged on the ground and slowly activated the ‘Cultivation Technique’ in order to digest all of the energy that was inside his body.

“Forget about him. Let’s continue with ours.”

Xiao Qingchen spoke to Yuan Zheng who sat next to him.

He could now feel that Lin Xiu was now much more powerful than before. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

If he had to fight Lin Xiu now, there was a chance that he might be defeated very quickly.

As he thought about this, he felt pressured and he had to force himself to continue cultivating.

Time passed and Lin Xiu was still busy cultivating the energy that he got from the pool.

He was trying to get all of this to penetrate into his flesh and bones; even to the smallest cell in his body.

Minutes and seconds passed. His body that was bloated earlier was slowly returning to its original state.

Crack– –

His bones that seemed to have been reformed started making weird noises.

The sky here did not change no matter what time of the day it was.

Therefore, Lin Xiu had no idea how long it had been.

But, when he opened his eyes again, he felt that his entire body was now lighter.

He felt as if he was floating in the air.

“You’re awake?”

Riyan God Lord stood before Lin Xiu and smiled.

“En.”

Lin Xiu stretched his back and felt good.

“You have indeed absorbed a lot of energy from the pool.”

Riyan God Lord looked surprised when he told Lin Xiu about this.

This was because after Lin Xiu had got out from the pool, Riyan God Lord checked the water level and there was one third of it missing!!!

This amount was indeed massive.

Riyan God Lord even felt a little heartbroken for the God King.

How did this fellow manage to absorb so much of it?

“It was alright. Can I still go in again?”

Lin Xiu chuckled as he asked.

Riyan God Lord’s mind was filled with questions but his answer was, “No.”

“You have already absorbed the maximum amount of energy while you were inside earlier. If you continue to stay inside, the effect of it would be much less now.”

“What a waste.”

...

Lin Xiu pursed his lips. He thought to himself that if he could only go down once more, he would be able to break through another level.

“Your abilities have increased again?!”

Xiao Qingchen hesitated before asking Lin Xiu.

Yuan Zheng was looking at Lin Xiu as well.

Both of them have just awakened.

They could clearly feel that the energy inside them had grown tremendously.

Lin Xiu’s energy seemed to be even more powerful now!

If they had an increase of at least 20%, Lin Xiu’s energy must have increased by more than 40%!

This fellow was incredibly scary.

“Well, it did improve a little.”

Lin Xiu smiled as he answered them.

...

He was trying to stay humble even when it wasn’t only a little!

His entire body has been rebuilt by the essence and with the potential points that he had, there would be at least a 40% improvement in his stats!

This was considered a huge leap.

Lin Xiu felt that he could fight Xiao Qingchen even without using ‘Rage’.

Lin Xiu could even defeat him.

“Alright. Now that you have absorbed the energy from the pool, would you like to head back or stay in God City?”

Riyan God Lord asked about their plans after this.

“I would like to head back.”

Lin Xiu quickly gave an answer.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng nodded their heads as well.

They still have to return to their city and deal with the other things.

Although the air here was rich in energy, it would still be better for them to return to their own cities.

Riyan God Lord then walked towards the tunnel.

The rest of them followed behind him.

Just like before, as soon as they were inside the tunnel, they couldn’t hear anything.

This was because they had been in here once and this time, they didn’t feel any discomfort.

“We’re finally out…”

Yuan Zheng was excited to be out of the tunnel.

Soon, they arrived by the Central Pavillion.

“Here. One for each of you.”

Riyan God Lord waved his right arm and there were three sparkling pieces that headed towards them.

Lin Xiu and the rest quickly caught them.

It was a transparent card.

There was also a dim glow around it.

“This is a teleportation card. Crush it and you will be transported back here.”

Riyan God Lord stroked his beard as he explained it to them.

Lin Xiu had a good look at the card since he was curious about the material that the card was made of.

“28 days later, crush it and come here immediately.”

They mentioned 31 days earlier but it now looks like he has already spent 3 days by the pool.

“You….specialises in using the fire element, right?”
