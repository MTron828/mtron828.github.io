Chapter 848: Above the Palace!

According to the above records, this kind of flower can only appear in the place where the spiritual energy of heaven and earth is most abundant.

Does the so-called weather aura mean the place with the most energy in the air?

Continuing to look at it, this scroll was made three hundred years ago.

“Have you looked for it before?”

Lin Xiu retracted the scroll, looked at Luo Jing and said lightly.

“Yes, I’ve searched the entire Marqi planet, but I can’t find it.”

Although Luo Jing was very reluctant, he still had no choice but to tell Lin Xiu.

“If you really want to find it, you may have to find another powerful planet.”

“A stronger planet than Marqi Planet.”

A stronger planet than the Marqi planet?

Hearing this, Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something and the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

After taking a deep breath and calming down, Lin Xiu left here.

“By the way, a warning, if you don’t want to die, don’t go to Earth.”

Just when Lin Xiu was about to step out of the gate, Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Also, your king probably would not exist anymore after today.”

As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Xiu’s figure immediately disappeared.

hu—

Luo Tian let out a long sigh of relief at this time.

A young man would give him such a great sense of oppression.

“Damn kid...”

At this time, Luo Tian also panted and stood up leaning against the wall.

Thinking of the terrifying flame bird just now, he has lingering fears now.

“Luo Jing, has this kid’s strength reached Respected warrior?”

Luo Tian spoke to Luo Jing over there.

“Probably.”

Luo Jing thought for a moment, then nodded.

“Respected warrior... Does this kid really want to fight with His Majesty?”

There seemed to be a strange light flashing in Luo Tian’s eyes.

“Father, you...”

“Although His Majesty’s strength is very strong, but...”

Luo Tian didn’t finish his words, there were some things he couldn’t say.

“I’ll go get ready.”

Luo Jing also seemed to understand Luo Tian’s meaning at this time and said aloud at this time.

And Lin Xiu, at this time, has already headed towards the palace of Fengyun City.

“Huang Ying, get out of here!”

At this moment, above the palace, Lin Xiu’s figure was suspended in the air, making a loud noise.

With Lin Xiu’s source strength, this voice spread throughout the entire Fengyun City.

A large number of warriors were shocked.

All of them stood on higher grounds and looked over the top of the palace in the distance.

“He is back!?”

Anyone who had heard of the battle a year ago had subconsciously thought of that boy at this time.

Only he, the warrior who defeated ten thousand armies alone, could be so crazy to shout for His Majesty.

“Long spear, white battle suit, young man, the rumor is true!”

Some people used special telescopes to look at Lin Xiu suspended above the palace and they were immediately shocked.

At this time, the entire Fengyun City was almost paying attention to the situation over there.

Whoosh whoosh—

Lin Xiu, who was standing in the air, heard a clear voice at this time.

A large number of missiles charged down directly!

boom boom boom —

The entire sky, at this moment, sent out a terrifying explosion.

At this moment, the entire Fengyun City vibrated violently.

As the thick smoke in the air dissipated, a dark blue ‘Sphere’ appeared.

Under the protection of ‘Sphere’, Lin Xiu did not suffer any harm at all.

“Get out here.”

Lin Xiu’s voice continued to resound throughout the entire Fengyun City.

Although the power of these missiles is powerful, to Lin Xiu, they are like mosquito bites.

And they didn’t dare to launch even more powerful missiles, because in this way, the entire Fengyun City would be destroyed.

“How dare you come to the palace, courting death!”

A stern shout came and at this moment, dozens of top King warrior-level warriors instantly appeared in the air.

They all attacked Lin Xiu!

“This old turtle doesn’t dare to come out yet?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows and then said lightly.

“Insult His Majesty, you die!”

A warrior roared, holding a huge axe and slashing at Lin Xiu’s body!

“Humph!”

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he snorted coldly and waved the Dark Edge spear in both hands!

Dang–

The spear and his giant axe collided together and a huge sound suddenly erupted.

The terrifying power was transmitted to the axe of the King warrior, causing the axe in his hand to fly straight out.

Can’t even hold it steady.

Boom—

And at this moment, a flaming bird burst out without knowing when and rushed directly to his body!

He couldn’t even cry out, his whole body instantly turned into a white bone and he fell directly.

“The power of this kid...”

In the distance, Luo Tian and Luo Jing also stood at the highest point of Luo’s house and they were shocked when they saw the pictures taken by the aerial camera from a high altitude.

The fifty-four guards of the royal family are all top King warriors and they are the strongest troops in the emperor’s victory.

This troop is capable of leveling the entire Marqi planet.

But Lin Xiu actually killed one of the King warriors with just one move.

Thinking of the battle with Lin Xiu just now, they couldn’t help but tremble in fear.

boom boom boom —

At this time, Lin Xiu, who was in the air, was facing the attacks of more than fifty King warriors and these terrifying skills, but he seemed to be able to handle it with ease.

The dark blue ‘Sphere’ blocked all the skills outside Lin Xiu’s body.

“Bloodthirsty Domain!”

“Dragon Domain!”

“...”

All these King warriors unleashed their domain forces.

Even a Respected warrior would find it extremely difficult to deal with so many domain forces.

But Lin Xiu was not in a hurry at all. With a thought, a lot of light burst out from his body.

‘Purification Domain’!

All the power of the domain disappeared at this moment.

“‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’!”

At this moment, Lin Xiu roared loudly.

The spear in his hand spun wildly.

A sea of ??fire instantly appeared in the entire sky!

The flames were dark blue. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

In the sea of ????fire, a large number of huge fireballs appeared, like meteorites falling from the sky, all of them impacted down!

boom boom boom —

When those King warriors saw this scene, their eyes changed greatly and they quickly dodged.

Now they have no time to think about why all their domain forces had just disappeared.

Because this terrifying fireball, with its terrifying flame power, made them feel a sense of threat to their lives.

Above the entire palace, like a meteor shower, a large number of flame balls impacted down!

The missile cars and laser weapons below were all hit by the flame ball.

Suddenly a sea of ??fire!
