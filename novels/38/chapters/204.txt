Chapter 205: Hand Everything Over

The flame on the blade was so intense that the faces of the students of Sacred Region academy could not help but changed slightly.

Using this saber covered in flames to attack Lin Xiu, he would probably be chopped in half!

But what was surprising was that Lin Xiu was still standing at the same spot and didn’t seem afraid at all.

“Careful!!!” Seeing this thrilling scene, Zhang Yin and the others yelled.

“Go to hell!!!” Sha Qiu’s face contorted in anger.

With this blow, he was absolutely determined to kill Lin Xiu. If he couldn’t even deal with someone from Class 10 of the South Campus, then it would really be too shameful for him to be in the Sacred Region Academy.

But Lin Xiu was still standing there, unafraid, staring coldly at Sha Qiu who was holding the saber covered with flames as he charged over.

At the next moment, Lin Xiu’s body moved and the Dark Edge spear in his hands burst into flames!

What is going on!?

Sha Qiu’s eyes revealed a hint of shock.

As the flames that appeared on top of Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear seemed to be even more terrifying, the surrounding air seemed to be contorted.

“I’ve said before that I’ve swallowed the Red Lotus Fire.” Lin Xiu said coldly and immediately held the body of the Dark Edge spear with both hands.

In the next moment, he waved it toward Sha Qiu!

Boom–

Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear that was covered in flames collided with Sha Qiu’s saber and there was a huge explosion.

The two of them flew apart in an instant.

Lin Xiu took a few steps back and pressed his Dark Edge spear against the ground before his body stopped retreating.

At this time, Sha Qiu hit the wall behind him heavily.

His saber has broken into two!

“Class monitor!” The two guys from Class 2 of the North Campus rushed towards Sha Qiu. As soon as they helped Sha Qiu up, he spat out blood.

“Ah!” When the two guys touched his body, Sha Qiu let out a scream.

Looking closely, his arms and legs were twisted.

They seemed to be broken.

Miserable, it was really miserable.

The rest of the people turned to Lin Xiu with a look of horror. The class monitor of Class 2 of the North Campus was beaten up so badly by Lin Xiu. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

At this moment, almost all the bones in his body were broken. He would probably have to spend a lot of time in bed to recuperate.

When these two guys were about to help Sha Qiu up, Lin Xiu had already walked over.

That blow just now was just an impact, he didn’t suffer much actually.

Lin Xiu looked at them and pointed the tip of his Dark Edge spear at them then said faintly, “Trying to flee?”

“What do you want!?” The two men said angrily at this time.

But looking at Lin Xiu holding a spear, although they were angry, they didn’t dare to move at all.

Not only were they afraid of Lin Xiu’s horrifying skill, but they were in the wrong first.

“You can save him, but you must hand over all the Odd crystals.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Class 10 of the South Campus – don’t go too far.” At this time, the students from the North Campus said to Lin Xiu.

The South Campus and North Campus had a certain competitive relationship from the beginning. Although some of them did not like the people in Class 2 of the North Campus, they had to stand up for them because they were bullied by the South Campus.

“What? You guys would like to give me some free Odd crystals too?” Lin Xiu raised his brows and pointed at them with his spear.

“Outrageous!!!” Hearing the words of Lin Xiu, some students in the North Campus became furious.

This was related to the reputation of the North Campus.

“Hng! The people in the South Campus are not ones you guys can bully. Your Sha Qiu from Class 2 of the North Campus attacked first and now that they have been defeated, you still want to bully us, huh!”

At this time, the students in the South Campus also stood up, especially Zhang Yin and the others, who had already taken up their weapons and confronted them.

At this time, the students at the North Campus frowned. If this continues, the situation would be very unfavorable for them.

After all, the people in Class 2 of the North Campus have suffered a serious setback, and they had no idea where the team in Class 1 had gone, they haven’t appeared yet.

Fighting in the current situation, their Odd crystals would probably be snatched away by the South Campus.

“We’ll give them to you!!!” The people in Class 2 of the North Campus gritted their teeth and took out all the Odd crystals from the backpack.

They hunted a lot of evolved beasts and there were more than 20 Odd crystals that were obtained from rank 5 evolved beasts, and the rest were mostly rank 4 Odd crystals.

“I only need these.” Lin Xiu put the 20 over Odd crystals directly into his backpack and glanced at the people around him, “I don’t take the initiative to provoke anyone.”

“But if someone dares to provoke me and the people in my team again, this will be the consequences!” Lin Xiu let out a cold snort, waved his right hand and released a flaming red-eyed bird from the Dark Edge spear.

In a short time, the huge stone nearby was instantly annihilated as the flaming bird slammed against it.

The warriors present were shocked when they saw this scene and it was terrifying that he could simply unleash such a strong skill at will.

The people in Class 2 of the North Campus had undoubtedly lost in this freshmen competition. They did not have a single rank 5 Odd crystal. When they return to the airship, their score will be recorded as zero.

The rest of the people dispersed slowly at this time. Although the G17 Ruin near the city center was now very dangerous, the situation here was much better.

And because the evolved beasts of rank 5 and above ran out, it was a good thing for them. As long as they were more careful around the borders, they could kill those rank 5 evolved beasts and obtain the rank 5 Odd crystals!

“Shall we go now?” Lin Xiu said as he watched those people disperse and looked at Luo Yue behind.

“En.” Luo Yue nodded.

But she was not in a hurry. That peak rank 8 evolved beast was not so easily killed.

“You guys be careful here, Luo Yue and I will go and take a look there.” Lin Xiu looked at Zhang Yin and the others and said.

He wanted to put the crystals with Zhang Yin at first, after all, there were a bit too many Odd crystals and it was slightly troublesome to carry them on his back.

But thinking about the number of students from the Sacred Region Academy nearby, they might encounter other warriors and it would be troublesome if they were robbed.

“You guys be careful.” Zhang Yin nodded. This level of battle was not something he could join and if he wasn’t careful, he may never come back!

At this moment, a cold breeze blew over, causing him to shiver.
