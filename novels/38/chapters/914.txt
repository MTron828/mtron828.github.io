Chapter 915: To the Secret Realm

“Phew.”

Lin Xiu let out a breath of turbid air, watching the sunlight slowly coming in with his eyes, he felt extremely warm all over his body.

Comfortable, really comfortable.

There was a lot of sweat on the body and he felt a little sticky.

After taking a shower, Lin Xiu walked out of the hotel.

It took one entire night to absorb the energy of this divine spark.

What surprised Lin Xiu was that his body seemed to have become stronger after being baptized by the energy of the divine spark.

The hands clenched and it seemed to become stronger.

Moreover, the flame attribute carried by Divine Spark also has a lot of boosting effects on one’s own flame energy.

According to the location Hu Ling said, Lin Xiu rushed over there.

It was going to be noon soon.

Not far from the Wildfire City, quite a few warriors were already gathered there.

Luo Kun, Zhang Jin, Hu Ling and a strange man led the four teams.

......

Every team has a lot of warriors.

“finally here.”

At this moment, Hu Ling looked at the young man walking not far away and suddenly showed a faint smile.

She still saw the strength that Lin Xiu showed.

With such a powerful warrior here, the chance of success in this secret realm is also greatly improved.

And Luo Kun and Zhang Jin’s faces seemed to be a bit unpleasant.

They had a good relationship with An Nengxing. Unexpectedly, An Nengxing’s Shadow Squad was eliminated.

And even he himself was killed.

But they couldn’t say anything. After all, Lin Xiu was strong.

“Hmph, this kid came so late.”

Some warriors around looked at Lin Xiu with disdain.

Because after each warrior is successfully selected, they will directly leave the underground fighting arena, then gather here the next day.

Therefore, almost the vast majority of people were unaware of Lin Xiu’s strength.

At this time, seeing that Lin Xiu was still so young and ordinary, many people looked down on him.

“I’m sorry, I took a bit longer.”

Lin Xiu walked over to Hu Ling’s side, then said with a faint smile.

“It’s okay, let’s get ready to go.”

Hu Ling smiled and said.

“By the way, I haven’t asked your name yet.”

“Lin Xiu.”

Lin Xiu said casually.

“Everyone, this is Lin Xiu, he is a super strong warrior.”

Hu Ling nodded, then introduced.

Judging from the strength that Lin Xiu showed yesterday, almost every warrior here is not an opponent.

After the surrounding warriors heard Hu Ling’s words, they all perfunctorily said “hm”.

No one believed that Lin Xiu would possess great power.

Moreover, Lin Xiu also looked very handsome.

In their opinion, Lin Xiu must have entered this team because of some unknown relationship with Hu Ling.

“Let’s get ready to go.”

Hu Ling looked around and when everything was ready, she said aloud.

Zhang Jin and Luo Kun also nodded, then walked towards the front at the same time.

Lin Xiu followed behind the team and looked ahead.

This area is all barren and it seems that there is nothing to see.

Is this so-called secret realm here?

.

With doubts, when he slowly walked forward, Lin Xiu could clearly see some buildings and figures in front of him.

someone?

Lin Xiu raised his brows.

“Everyone, please keep everything that happens later a secret.”

Luo Kun, who was walking at the front, stopped immediately, then spoke to many warriors.

“Whoever leaks the secret will be hunted down in our Divine Domain.”

After he glanced at the surrounding warriors again, he said lightly.

Hearing his words, the people around can clearly feel the killing blow. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

It made their bodies feel a chill.

“Go in.”

There are a large number of guards guarding the front there.

At this time, they watched as Hu Ling and others brought them over, checked the information, then said aloud.

Soon, Lin Xiu and the others also walked in.

Inside, there is a building with a huge mask over there.

With a warrior here leading, everyone walked into the building.

Lin Xiu looked around.

The strength of these guards was all at the peak of the King warrior and there were several warriors at the level of Respected warrior!

Lin Xiu was a little surprised by such a powerful guard force.

But this secret realm shouldn’t be here, right?

Lin Xiu felt a little puzzled.

“You are the guy who killed An Nengxing?”

At this moment, a strange man came over and said to Lin Xiu with a faint smile.

His smiling face was full of pride.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

This time there were a total of four teams and this person was obviously the man who took An Nengxing’s place.

“You want to fight?”

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up slightly, then said lightly.

“No, I just want to remind you that in the secret realm, no matter how powerful you are, if you are not careful, you will still die.”

After speaking, he left.

Lin Xiu raised his brows and ignored this man.

Now all he wants is to see this so-called secret realm.

There must be many rare things in this kind of place. There might even be an orchid of heaven.

This is the reason why Lin Xiu came here.

“Okay, team one please enter.”

At this time, a person in charge here waved his hand.

As soon as he finished speaking, Luo Kun entered with his team of warriors.

boom boom boom —

In the room they entered, suddenly there was a strange sound.

The sound is not too loud, like the sound of some machine starting up.

There are four rooms in total and Hu Ling led the rest of the warriors to the fourth room.

As soon as he walked in, Lin Xiu saw a familiar machine.

Space teleportation machine.

Lin Xiu’s eyes could not help narrowing slightly.

Now that he understands everything, these people in this Divine Domain probably did not want people to know where this secret realm is.

So using the method of teleportation, they would directly teleport into the secret realm.

“In the secret realm, all the items obtained are ours, but if you get the inheritance power, the items can be owned by you, any problem?”

A person in charge here glanced at the warriors led by Hu Ling, then said lightly.

“no problem!”

When these warriors heard the man’s words, they immediately shouted loudly.
