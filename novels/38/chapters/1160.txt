A Noble God?

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes subconsciously when he heard the news.

The Noble God was a title that has been awarded by the God king to the warriors gods who have been exceptional in the warrior god realm.

Lin Xiu had learnt quite a lot about the realm after reading about it for the past few days.

“How could I be able to find the Noble God?”

Lin Xiu then asked Mr Pangh after thinking about it.

“Ummm….I’m not sure about that.”

Mr Pang shook his head and was helpless as well.

“It’s alright. I’ll figure it out on my own.”

Lin Xiu answered helplessly.

Suddenly, Lin Xiu could clearly see that there were white snowflakes that fell from the sky.

“This…”

Lin Xiu looked at the sky and he was surprised.

He reached out his arm and there were snowflakes that landed on Lin Xiu’s palm.

It’s snowing.

“It would snow every year here in Lingxian City during this time.”

“But it looks like it’s a little earlier this year.”

Mr Pang quickly told Lin Xiu about it when he saw the snowflakes.

He seemed to be surprised as well to see it snowing.

“Here’s another one…”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

At the same time, on another side of the realm.

“Luo Yue, you’re 301th on the Warrior God Rank!”

One of the women, who looked surprised, told Luo Yue about the news.

“En.”

Luo Yue was the same as before without any expressions on her face.

“Luo Yue.”

Then, an elegant woman appeared from the other end of the room.

“Master.”

The woman who spoke to Luo Yue, immediately greeted the elegant woman respectfully.

When Luo Yue saw who it was, she asked, “When will I be able to return home?”

“Return?”

The woman frowned.

“With your physique, you can definitely be a warrior god. Why do you want to go back to that lowly planet?”

The woman answered with a monotonous tone.

“It’s none of your business.”

Luo Yue answered coldly.

The woman was a little stunned after hearing Luo Yue’s answer.

“I’m telling you that you have to be in the top 200 of the Warrior God Rank by next month or I will destroy that planet with my bare hands.”

The woman threatened Luo Yue.

“Don’t you dare!”

Luo Yue, who had always been emotionless, finally had a different look on her face.

Her family was all on earth and she could never allow anyone else to destroy it.

“Do you think that you would be able to fight against your master just because you are a warrior god now?!”

The woman spoke coldly before walking away.

“You better stay right here!”

When the woman left, the lady standing next to Luo Yue finally sighed.

“Luo Yue, you shouldn’t talk to her like that. She’s doing it for your own good.”

The lady looked at Luo Yue. She hesitated for a short while before trying to comfort Luo Yue.

Luo Yue did not answer her. Instead, she continued moving the sword in her hands and was practising the new set of warrior skills.

Before she had the ability to do anything else, she could only focus on improving herself. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Three days have passed.

Due to the continuous snow that happened for the past 3 days, the entire Lingxian City was covered with white, glistening snow.

Logically speaking, with such weather, there should be lesser pedestrian on the streets.

However, since the day before yesterday, there have been warriors from other cities that entered Lingxian City.

As Lin Xiu walked on the street, he took a good look at the warriors. All of them entered from the main gates and were all looking curious.

Why were there so many new warriors here in Lingxian City?

Lin Xiu didn’t think that these warriors were here to watch the snow.

“Perhaps….there are ruins that have appeared?”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

This was because according to what Mr Pang told him, the Lingxian City was built by a God King. The ruins that he left behind were in Lingxian City.

Every year when it snowed, the doors to the ruins would be opened.

But….this was merely a legend and no one knew if it was true.

“Young man, do you know how to get to Tianlan Pavilion?”

Suddenly, there was a group of warriors that came from opposite Lin Xiu.

One of them spoke to Lin Xiu after seeing how he was sitting in the middle of the street.

“Tianlan Pavilion?”

Lin Xiu was a little shocked to hear what the man said.

Tianlan Pavilion no longer existed in Lingxian City.

This was because it had been destroyed by Lin Xiu.

“There is no such thing as the Tianlan Pavilion here in Lingxian City.”

“Nonsense!”

Another man spoke instead after hearing Lin Xiu’s answer.

“Bring me to the Tianlan Pavilion!”

He pulled out his sword and pointed it at Lin Xiu.

From his point of view, Lin Xiu was only an ordinary warrior and they didn’t have to be respectful towards him.

“Brother, we’re allies of the Tianlan Pavilion. Bring us there now.”

The muscular man from before spoke as he glared at Lin Xiu.

“I don’t like it when others point their weapons at me.”

Lin Xiu looked at the tip of the sword that was close to his face and warned them about it.

“I will be doing so. What are you going to do about it?”

The young man laughed as he glared at Lin Xiu.

Bakk – –

Lin Xiu raised his right arm and caught the tip of the sword with his index and middle finger.

With a slight push, the tip of the sword was snapped off!

The warrior looked surprise when he saw what happened!

The sword that he had was a sturdy one as it was made of a special material. How could it be so easily broken by two fingers?!

“Your sword is a little rusty.”

Lin Xiu threw away the broken piece before speaking to the young man.

“You’re dead!”

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, the man felt furious. He screamed as he rushed toward Lin Xiu!

He threw away the sword in his arm and gathered all the energy onto his fist. Then, he swung his fist at Lin Xiu’s body!

As his fist moved across the air, there was the sound of an explosion that travelled through the air.

Lin Xiu remained unmoved.

Seeing how the fist was about to hit his head, Lin Xiu did not hide and returned it with another punch!

Boom – –

With the loud explosion, the man’s fist instantly exploded!

It blasted into pieces!

“Ahhhhhhhh!!!!”

A loud painful cry came out of the man’s mouth.
