Chapter 159: The Tower of Tournament!

But his body seemed to be overburdened due to the high-intensity training.

If he continued to train, not only would he stop improving, but it may also have counterproductive effects.

After taking a deep breath, Lin Xiu took out his information card.

“The card has been taken out…”

“The machine is shutting down…”

With the end of the gravity skill, Lin Xiu immediately felt his body relaxed for a while, and he felt as light as a swallow!

Lin Xiu pressed on the information card and the card suddenly turned into a screen.

“360 points deducted for three hours of double gravity, 360 points deducted for two hours of triple gravity, 100 points deducted for laser shooting avoidance training [level 1].

In this short period of time, he had already used up 820 points!

Looking at this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help feeling that if it wasn’t for his accumulation of points, he wouldn’t be able to cultivate!

Bang——

As Lin Xiu walked towards the door, the automatic door of the training room opened instantly.

“Lin Xiu is out!?” Zhang Yin said in surprise when he saw this.

At this moment, there were still many students on the training ground. Lin Xiu had just walked out and there were many eyes on him.

“Are you okay?” Jiang Li looked at Lin Xiu and asked instinctively.

“What could happen to me?” Lin Xiu smiled at this moment.

“You stayed for five hours ah… We all had a terribly uncomfortable feeling when we were inside just now.” Zhang Yin couldn’t help but sigh.

Lin Xiu smiled. After coming out of this training ground, he felt as light as a swallow.

This feeling was fantastic!

“You guys continue training, I’ll leave first.” Lin Xiu said to Zhang Yin and the others then carried the spear box he left in the training room on his back, and walked out.

The energy of the rank 6 Odd crystal has now been absorbed by Lin Xiu. Lin Xiu thought for a moment and decided to exchange for a few rank 5 Odd crystals.

At his current level, if he wanted to continue to improve his strength quickly, he could only use high-ranking Odd crystals with the ‘Cultivation technique’ to absorb the energy inside to transform his body. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Walking down from the building of his class, Lin Xiu walked towards the exchange center again following the directions on the map.

But at this moment, he found two very conspicuous spots on the map.

The Tower of Tournament and the Tower of Trial.

These two towers were a hundred stories high, and they were located at the opposite ends of the island of the Sacred Region Academy.

And that Tower of Battle was very close to him.

Lin Xiu pondered and walked over to the Tower of Tournament.

As soon as he got there, he could clearly see that there were a large number of students from the Sacred Region Academy there.

This is the Tower of Tournament?

Lin Xiu stood under the tower, looked up, and the so-called Tower of Tournament was so high that it seemed to reach the clouds.

There was a huge screen next to it, which seemed to be showing a list.

Freshmen list:

First place: Zhuo Qixing, 20th floor

Second place: Ouyang Hang, 20th floor

Third place: Tian Zixia, 19th floor

Fourth place: Luo Yue, 19th floor

…

…

Luo Yue is here too?

Lin Xiu had a look of surprise when he saw this scene.

Lin Xiu continued to look at the screen and instantly understood that battles started from the first floor of the Tower of Tournament and if you win a game on that floor, you can advance to the next floor.

You could battle at least once a day to ensure that your floor count don’t decrease. If you fail three consecutive battles, you must start again from the first floor.

And according to the floor you’re at, you can get corresponding points every day.

For example, at the 20th floor, you can earn 200 points every day!

And the top ten on the freshmen list wil receive additional rewards. The first place will be rewarded with 1,000 points a day, the second place will get 500, and the third place will get 200. The remaining fourth to tenth places would only get 100 each.

In addition to the freshmen list, there is also a top 100 list, which is ranked according to the students in the whole school.

“The freshmen in this intake are very strong. They even entered the 20th floor on the first day!?” Some people began whispering.

Lin Xiu still hesitated for a while, then took out his information card, registered in front, and was ready to enter the Tower of Tournament.

“Another freshman is here.” At this moment, some people next to Lin Xiu couldn’t help whispering when they saw him.

Lin Xiu hasn’t changed into his school uniform yet, so he was easily recognized as a freshman by these people.

“Tsk tsk, this guy looks like he would reach the third floor at most.” A man couldn’t help but shook his head when he saw Lin Xiu’s young appearance.

He stepped inside and noticed that the environment was a little gloomy.

He looked around and saw a huge arena in the middle, surrounded by seat, and a lot of students could be clearly seen sitting around.

The people above were fighting desperately, and soon a warrior was sent flying out directly.

“Next match, staff get ready!”

“ID9814126,林修!”

“ID9814126, Lin Xiu!”

“ID5222187,欧震!”

“ID5222187, Ou Zhen!”

Not long after Lin Xiu came in, he heard the broadcast.

So fast?

Lin Xiu was stunned, then he quickly jumped up and went up.

“Another freshman is here!” At this moment, many people began to whisper when they saw Lin Xiu going up.

As there were already several freshmen today who broke into the tenth to twentieth floors on the first day, many seniors were quite surprised.

“This one wouldn’t be able to. The previous ones were all rank 5 and rank 4 warrios, he’s only rank 3, and his combat strength is only about 3,000.” A man wearing a pair of goggles said.

This was not an ordinary pair of goggles, but a combat strength test apparatus.

Although it couldn’t evaluate the human body’s muscle, bone density, strength, and other aspects as detailed as a real test apparatus, it could still see a person’s approximate strength.

“I think so too. He is up against a second-year rank 4 warrior – this round would probably end quickly.”

Lin Xiu was already standing in the arena at this moment. The arena looked like it was made out of a marble slab, but it was actually made of very strong material.

“Freshman? Do you think we should use weapons or fists?” Ou Zhen, a guy who looked very strong, said while looking at Lin Xiu with a smile.

At this moment, he looked at Lin Xiu like he was looking at a chicken that could only be held at will.

“Whichever.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Ou Zhen! Don’t give the freshman such a hard time!” Just then, the seniors behind laughed and called out.

Ou Zhen made an ‘OK’ gesture to those people, then waved his fist and attacked Lin Xiu!
