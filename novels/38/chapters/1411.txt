1412 Getting the Spirit Fire Energy Stone

The rest of the crowd followed behind Mr Sima and continued walking forward.

As Mr Sima walked over to one of the walls, he stopped.

Then, he raised his right arm.

Thump Thump

!!

The entire place started shaking all of a sudden.

Soon, there was a door that appeared before their eyes.

As the door was pushed open, there was an eye-blinding bright light that came from inside.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

The light was so bright that it was impossible to look at it.

The bright light continued shining brightly for some time and only became weaker after some time.

The rest of them had also gotten used to the bright light.

As they finally got to have a closer look, they finally realised what it looked like inside.

“There are so many treasures..”

Seeing what was inside the space, all of them had their eyes wide open.

One of the warrior gods felt envious.

He shifted his body and wanted to rush inside, hoping to take away the first thing that he could get his hands on.

However, the bright light from inside rushed towards him and his entire body was sliced into two parts.

His body had also turned into small particles and disappeared.

That man.died?!

The rest of the warriors were shocked.

There were some who wanted to attempt the same thing in order to get what they wanted but were forced to stop.

It was terrifying. That man died in a blink of an eye.

“Those who violate the rules will have to bear the consequences.”

Mr Sima warned the others.

“Come in.”

With that said, he walked through the doors.

The rest of the warriors were a little hesitant but they still followed him inside.

This was a huge space and it was obvious that there were all sorts of treasures arranged in shelves inside the space.

There were even some that had only been mentioned in the books.

All of them were getting excited but none had the guts to do anything now.

Those who were after the 99th place, felt their heartache when they saw these treasures.

They were not getting anything from this place.

“The first place, you may pick your treasure now.”

“You can pick up to three of them.”

Mr Sima reminded Lin Xiu about his reward.

This place was huge and loaded with treasures.

It wasn’t an exaggeration to say that the entire floor was covered with treasures.

All of them seemed to have an invisible glass-like barrier that separated the energy coming from these treasures.

“Do you have the Spirit Fire Energy Stone?”

Lin Xiu immediately asked Mr Sima.

This was the one thing that he wanted most.

“We do.”

Mr Sima waved his right arm and then, a scarlet rock from afar that was covered with an energy barrier flew towards them.

Lin Xiu was excited to see the stone energy.

He finally found it!

“Here.”

As Mr Sima raised his right hand, the Spirit Fire Energy Stone flew over into Lin Xiu’s arms.

He caught them with both hands.

With the energy barrier around it, Lin Xiu did not feel the burning heat from the energy stone.

“Just break the energy barrier and you will be able to get the stone.”

“Alright.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head then he kept the Spirit Fire Energy Stone inside his expansion space.

The others were a little surprised but none of them gave a huge reaction.

...

It was not something shocking for certain warriors to have an expansion space of their own.

“Next, what would you like?”

“Do you have the Water of Life?”

This was the mission that Tianling God King gave them.

Although he didn’t necessarily have to complete the mission, he still felt that he could. In fact, other than the Spirit Fire Energy Stone, there was nothing else in this room that caught his eyes.

“Yes.”

Mr Sima waved his right arm and a bottle filled with the Water of Life appeared before Lin Xiu.

“Last pick.”

Lin Xiu looked around and noticed a black ball that was on the ground and picked it up.

“Are you sure?”

Mr Sima was a little surprised by how casual Lin Xiu was with his choices.

...

“En.”

Lin Xiu then kept the remaining two into his expansion space.

“Alright. You can leave now.”

Mr Sima waved his left arm and a white source of energy covered his entire body.

“I’ve already completed the mission. You don’t have the look for it.”

Before Lin Xiu disappeared, he informed Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng about it.

“Luo Yue, I’ll wait for you at Warrior God City.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Then, he disappeared into thin air.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng were both grateful towards Lin Xiu.

It was a mission given to all three of them; no matter who, they would have to complete it.

But, Lin Xiu has picked the Water of Life as one of his rewards and their mission has been completed.

There was no need for them to try looking for it.

“What would you like?”

Luo Yue looked around and simply picked two items.

“Are you sure?”

Mr Sima raised his brows.

“En.”

Luo Yue nodded her head.

“Alright then.”

Mr Sima waved his hands and Luo Yue disappeared in the midst of the white light.

“It’s finally over.”

Lin Xiu had now been transported back to the wide space in Warrior God City.

He muttered to himself as he felt bored.

His journey in the Ancient Ruins of the Tianmen City was over.

He felt that it happened very quickly.

As if. Something should have happened but did not.

He looked around at the warriors around him. These young warriors looked mad. It seems like most of them didn’t even get to enter the Ancient Ruins in the first round.

Lin Xiu stood by the side and looked into the distance.

Soon, there was a bright light that appeared and he finally saw Luo Yue.

He immediately smiled when he saw who it was. Then, he ignore those who were around him and quickly walked toward Luo Yue.

Luo Yue also had a smile on her face as if the ice around her had melted.

Both of them hugged tightly onto each other.

It felt great to see each other again.

Lin Xiu hugged onto Luo Yue tightly as if he wanted to melt Luo Yue into his own body.

“Come with me.”

Lin Xiu whispered in her ears.

“En.”

Luo Yue nodded her head that rested on Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

Both of them finally got to enjoy their time together and ignored everything around them.
