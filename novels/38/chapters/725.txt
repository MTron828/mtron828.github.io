Chapter 726 Collapse

There were many scars on their bodies and they dare not continue to fight.

Although Zhang Zhiheng was also injured, his injuries were obviously lighter than theirs.

At this time, Zhang Zhiheng looked at the long sword and when he blew it lightly, all the dust on it flew away.

Revealing the sharp blade of the long sword.

“Sure enough, it is the divine weapon used by King warrior.”

Zhang Zhiheng laughed loudly, then took off the battle uniform on the skeleton.

This double-edged sword was crystal clear and looked like something ingenious.

Looking at these things, Zhang Zhiheng couldn’t help but smile proudly.

“Captain, is this the inheritance?”

Some warriors from their legion also spoke out at this time.

Hearing their words, Zhang Zhiheng then came to his senses.

Oh right, where is the inheritance?

He knew that a warrior of the king warrior level could store all his power and consciousness in a certain carrier, then pass it on to others.

However, once this method is used, one’s own power would also completely disappear.

Therefore, this method was generally used only before death.

“Stone tablet?”

At this moment, Zhang Zhiheng also saw clearly that behind the skeleton, it was not an ordinary chair back, but a stone tablet.

There were many words on the stone tablet.

“This is the inheritance?”

Zhang Zhiheng stared at the stele, with a fiery look in his eyes.

And the other warriors who were just injured were staring at this side.

Although they just conceded defeat, they are now looking for opportunities to see if Zhang Zhiheng will reveal his flaws.

When given the opportunity, they will act.

Boom boom boom —

But at this moment, the whole ground began to shake.

“Why is there an earthquake?”

Some warriors said in surprise at this time.

Boom

The pillars on the palace also began to crack and soon began to collapse!

“Zhang Zhiheng got the inheritance! This legacy land is about to collapse! Run!”

Some warriors seemed to have thought of something and at this time they hurriedly said.

With this crazy shaking, cracks began to appear on the ground, as well as above the head.

And there were some rocks and sand falling down from the top.

Only Zhang Zhiheng rushed to the baffled.

Inheritance, he has not obtained any inheritance at all, why did the earthquake suddenly happen?

Zhang Zhiheng didn’t have time to think about it, put on the obtained battle uniform, then pulled out the stone tablet with all his strength.

“Let’s go!”

He has already decided that the inheritance was on this stone tablet and he just needed to leave with it.

The rest of the warriors felt distressed when they saw that the mountain-like skill cards, gold coins, weapons and battle uniforms all began to fall to the cracked ground.

But there was no way. Now the space here seemed to be collapsing. If they don’t leave, it will be too late!

At this time, a large number of warriors ran frantically to the outside without even looking back.

Everyone quickly returned to the original side through the passage, but the shaking still hasn’t stopped.

At this moment, the ten passages were all blocked by falling rocks.

boom boom boom —

And at this time, a large number of rocks began to fall from above the head.

Now these warriors didn’t want anything, they just want to leave this space quickly.

“Where are you going?”

Zhang Zhiheng was holding the heavy stone tablet and he was a little injured from earlier, so his speed seemed to be a little slower.

Just when he was about to run to the front, a voice came.

“What, want to die?”

Zhang Zhiheng looked towards the front and immediately saw Lin Xiu’s figure.

Looking at Lin Xiu who appeared here, Zhang Zhiheng’s face suddenly became gloomy.

A rank 9 boy dared to provoke him. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Don’t think that just because this place is about to collapse, I won’t dare to kill you.”

“No, you have no chance to kill me.”

Lin Xiu shook his head, then his eyes became serious and the Dark Edge spear in his hand instantly turned dark red.

And there was a faint flame on the spear’s body.

At this time, the surrounding warriors were all in a hurry to escape and no one noticed what was going on here. The huge stones that kept falling also blocked the vision of those warriors in Zhang Zhiheng’s team.

“Go to hell then.” Zhang Zhiheng’s face revealed a ferocious look, then he dropped the stone tablet and the double-edged sword, holding his own sword and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

He directly burst out with all the strength of his body and he was about to kill with one blow!

Because if he didn’t kill Lin Xiu quickly, after the space here collapsed, he wouldn’t be able to leave and he would die here.

“I tell you, I don’t like being threatened by others.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed and as soon as he finished speaking, his body seemed to have turned into a phantom and he rushed over!

bang bang bang

The weapons of the two collided and there were sounds ringing out.

Zhang Zhiheng’s speed was very fast, but Lin Xiu’s speed was not slow either.

The two were like phantoms, fighting against each other while dodging the rocks that fell from above.

Damn it!

Zhang Zhiheng didn’t want to waste time, he wanted to kill Lin Xiu directly.

But the reality was that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t kill Lin Xiu! “Die!!!”

At this time, Zhang Zhiheng was already furious and his whole body’s source strength was mobilized. Holding the sword in both hands, a terrifying blow broke out.

Straight from top to bottom, he chopped Lin Xiu’s body in half!

Just when Zhang Zhiheng thought that Lin Xiu was finally dead, he seemed to sense something, then turned around suddenly and looked behind him.

But at this moment, a cold light flashed and the tip of Lin Xiu’s spear pierced through his shoulder!

Originally, it was not that easy to get hit. After all, this guy was a master warrior and he was even a mid-level master warrior.

But he really wanted to kill Lin Xiu just now and in his opinion, Lin Xiu was only a rank 9 warrior and he didn’t take Lin Xiu too seriously, so he let Lin Xiu hit him.

“Ah!!!”

He roared loudly and when he was about to slash at Lin Xiu with the sword, Lin Xiu had already kicked him out!

‘Awe of the phoenix’!

And at this time, with Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear volleying into the air, the terrifying flaming birds charged directly.

The expression in Zhang Zhiheng’s eyes changed greatly, then he wanted to dodge.

But when he just dodged, he felt that the position he was standing at was covered by a shadow.

When he looked up, he found a huge rock falling!

Hit him directly on the body! “Goodbye.”
