Chapter 643: A Strong Attack

Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

He could clearly feel that his ‘Yuan’ was becoming unstable all of a sudden.

‘What on earth was happening?!

The look in his eyes changed because Lin Xiu ‘s spear had pierced through his ‘Yuan’ and it was about to destroy it!

How is this even possible?!

‘Yuan’ was a protective shield created by the source energy of a warrior. For them, this was the strongest defensive mechanism.

However, this strong protective shield of his was about to be destroyed.

How could Li Wang not be surprised by what he was seeing with his own eyes?!

Just when Li Wang was still filled with shock, Lin Xiu did not hesitate to continue his attack on Li Wang’s ‘Yuan’ with his Dark Edge.

Boom boom boom – —

One after another, the huge explosive noise surround the whole place and soon there was a crack that appeared on Li Wang’s Yuan’.

“What on earth is that?!”

Lin Wang was completely dumbfounded. He decided not to fight Lin Xiu up close. Instead, he jumped backwards in order to put some space between him and Lin Xiu.

He had a feeling that his ‘Yuan’ would break soon if Lin Xiu continued attacking it!

“No….this is not a warrior skill. It’s….. your spear?!”

Li Wang turned his attention towards Lin Xiu’s spear that was glowing with a dark red hue as he asked Lin Xiu.

This was a spear that could destroy ‘Yuan’!

“Looks like this is a good weapon…”

Li Wang said as he picked up his axe, allowing his ‘Yuan’ to disappear.

‘Yuan’ could only be formed by gathering a large amount of source energy. If his ‘Yuan’ gets attacked, his source energy would be reduced as well and for Li Wang, this cost him a lot of energy.

Therefore, instead of allowing Lin Xiu to destroy it, he would rather gather his energy onto his own body so that he could use it on his axe.

He might have stopped using his ‘Yuan’ but Lin Xiu still had his. Li Wang noticed that Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’ was very different from his. Lin Xiu’s one was dark red in colour and it looked extremely odd.

“You brat! Who on earth are you?!”

Li Wang could feel that there was something different with Lin Xiu and his face turned a horrible shade.

“It doesn’t matter who I am. What matters now is that you are dead!”

Lin Xiu sneered and as soon as he was done, he immediately released a huge amount of energy and aimed them towards Li Wang.

“Don’t you dare!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was headed towards himself, Lin Wang got furious. He placed the axe above his head and wanted to chop Lin Xiu’s body into pieces!

However, Lin Xiu’s pace was incredibly odd. As he got closer towards Li Wang, his body suddenly disappeared and easily dodged Li Wang’s attack!

What the hell?!

Due to the continuous attacks, Li Wang’s condition was not as strong as before. Seeing how Lin Xiu was still able to dodge his attack like a spirit, Li Wang was feeling the pressure.

Behind him!

At the next moment, he suddenly thought of something. As he tured around, he saw Lin Xiu who was headed towards his body with that odd spear!

The fatal attack!

The spear was now filled with energy and it contained 130% more than before.

Li Wang wanted to dodge the attack as he had done before but he noticed that this attack was much scarier than the one before. Plus, he didn’t think that the strength in this attack was so much stronger than the previous one.

As he blocked it with his axe, his weapon almost slipped out of his hand because of the impact.

His body took a few steps backwards as well as he had no other choice.

‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flower’!

Lin Xiu had not planned on stopping right here. He had decided to continue his attack.

The spear that was being pushed forward suddenly looked as if it had split into ten different spears.

Li Wang’s pupils shrink when his eyes meet with the spears and immediately use the Chloe Water that he had hidden in his sleeves.

When the water was splashed onto Lin Xiu, it immediately turned into a colourless and odourless vapour.

This would have no effect on them as they had already taken the specific antidote for this fluid before they got on stage.

He initially thought that Lin Xiu’s attack would slow down after being affected by Chloe Water but he didn’t think that it didn’t make much of a difference!

The spear was still headed towards him and it had already pierced into his body!

‘The axe that he was holding onto had already fallen out of his grip because of Lin Xiu’s continuous attacks. He didn’t get the chance to pick it up to block Lin Xiu’s attack. Before he knew it, all ten of the spears had already pierced through his body!

Boom boom boom — -—

As he no longer had ‘Yuan’ to protect him, the spear had directly landed on his body and with one single loud blow, there were countless bloody holes that appeared all over his body!

‘Ding! The fatal attack!”

At that moment, Lin Xiu would still clearly here the notification that was coming from his system.

Boom —

With that reminder, one of Lin Xiu’s spear suddenly let out a huge amount of energy and as the spear was still inside Li Wang’s body, it immediately caused his body to explode. Then, there was a huge bloody hole that appeared on Li Wang’s chest.

Li Wang widened his eyes and they were filled with disbelief.

He looked down at the horrible looking hole on his chest and his entire body fell to the ground.

“Did you think that the Chloe water would affect me?”

Lin Xiu looked at Li Wang’s body that was one the ground and snorted.

When Li Wang used the Chloe Water, Lin Xiu had already activated ‘Engulf’. Since he had done the same thing before this, the system could immediately activate the skill and the effect that it had on Lin Xiu was only for 0.01 seconds.

“Victory….for the Sacred Region Academy!”

When the annoncer saw the scene onstage, he was shocked as well but soon came to his senses and screamed at the top of his lungs.

“Sacred Region Academy!!!”

“Sacred Region Academy!!!”

‘When the audience heard the announcement, everyone started cheering for them.

This match was incredible. Plus, the audience was easily swayed. Those who supported the Interstellar Academy had now started cheering for the Sacred Region Academy after seeing how they had defeated the Interstellar Academy.

“Damn it!”

The leaders of the Interstellar Academy were furious when they saw the end of the match.

“We’ve noticed that your students have been using some illegal skills on stage during the match. Please come with us.”

Right at that moment, there were staff from the federation that walked towards the leaders of the Interstellar Academy.

After hearing what was told, he turned ghastly pale and fell onto his chair.

“Oh? Looks like that kid is pretty good.”

Nan Huang who was in one of the corner inside the hall mumbled to himself after seeing Lin Xiu in action..
