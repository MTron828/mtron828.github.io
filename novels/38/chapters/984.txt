Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Whoosh whoosh—

As the Dark Edge spear swung, there were whooshing sounds.

The sword art looked very sharp and there were all kinds of variations in every move.

If he was fighting with the enemy, it was almost impossible for the opponent to decipher this kind of sword art.

“It’s really amazing…”

According to the information in his mind, Lin Xiu continued to practice this Destiny spear art.

After practicing for about an hour, Lin Xiu put down the Dark Edge spear in his hand and was a little out of breath.

Although this spear art was very strong, it was also very difficult to practice.

After practicing like this for an hour, Lin Xiu felt that his body was a little overwhelmed.

Sitting down cross-legged, he activated the ‘Cultivation Technique’ to absorb the surrounding source power and replenish the consumed physical strength.

“Huh? There seems to be someone here!”

At the same time, some warriors came over from the other side.

It was easy to spot Lin Xiu sitting cross-legged not far away.

As soon as they walked over to Lin Xiu’s side, they found that Lin Xiu, who was sitting cross-legged, had more than 20 source rings on his arms!

Seeing this scene, the pupils in their eyes shrank slightly.

He had more than 20 source rings, which means that Lin Xiu killed more than 20 warriors who came in.

These warriors were all proud people. It was almost impossible to admit defeat and hand over the source ring. The only possibility was that Lin Xiu killed more than 20 warriors.

The other warriors who figured this out all looked at one another.

“Luo Hu, are you sure?”

One of the warriors looked at the strong warrior beside him and said aloud.

This warrior, known as Luo Hu, had a killing intent in his eyes at this time.

There were also several source rings on his arms.

Obviously, he also killed a lot of warriors.

“Being able to obtain more than 20 Source Rings, it seems that this person is not ordinary.”

Luo Hu stared at Lin Xiu over there and said in a deep voice.

“But I think he’s meditating over there now. He should have gotten injured while trying to get the source ring. So, we should have a chance.”

There were more than twenty source rings. As long as they managed to get them, it was very likely that their ranking would directly be at the top.

“Get ready, let’s go together.”

Luo Hu continued to speak.

“Wait, how do you divide the source rings?”

One of the warriors said aloud at this time.

Luo Hu glanced at him, then said lightly, “Just divide it equally amongst those present.”

The remaining few warriors nodded when they heard Luo Hu’s voice.

Now there are about seven of them and if the source rings were divided equally, each of them would get about three.

enough.

At this time, they continued to observe Lin Xiu and found that Lin Xiu was still sitting cross-legged, using the ‘Cultivation Technique’ to absorb the surrounding source strength.

“good chance!”

“Let’s go!”

As Luo Hu let out a low roar, at this moment, these warriors, using their body techniques at the same time, charged directly towards Lin Xiu!

They clenched the weapons in their hands and transmitted their source strength onto them, causing these weapons to glow slightly.

After all, Lin Xiu has more than 20 source rings in his hand and his strength was clearly extraordinary.

At this time, they all unfolded their ‘Sphere’.

Good chance, kill!!!

Luo Hu held the long spear in his hand and looked at Lin Xiu who still didn’t react, with a ferocious look on his cheeks.

The sharp point of the spear was about to stab Lin Xiu’s head!

Boom—

But at this moment, a dark blue flame burst out from Lin Xiu’s body.

In the next moment, a dark blue ‘Sphere’ was formed.

The attacks of these weapons were all blocked by this dark blue ‘Sphere’!

“Damn!”

Seeing that his shot was going to pierce through Lin Xiu’s head, he never thought that Lin Xiu had already opened a ‘Sphere’!

And this ‘Sphere’ was different from the ordinary ‘Sphere’!

The outer layer turned out to be a dark blue incomparably terrifying flame.

Luo Hu originally wanted to forcibly break through Lin Xiu’s “Sphere”, then pierce Lin Xiu’s head.

But the outer flame of this ‘Sphere’ was really terrifying.

The incomparably hot temperature was transmitted to his spear.

His hands felt the heat.

It was as if his hands were about to melt away.

There was no way, Luo Hu could only retreat to the back side.

“What!!!”

Some of the weapons of the other warriors fell directly to the ground and their hands were instantly blurred by the scalding heat.

“Sneak attack huh? That’s not nice.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s voice came over, causing the surrounding warriors to turn pale in shock.

Taking a closer look, the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded disappeared at this moment and Lin Xiu’s figure, too, slowly appeared.

The strength of these people is only at the level of Respected warrior so Lin Xiu sensed their arrival very easily.

He glanced at the past and found that Luo Hu, who was holding a spear, had several source rings on his arms. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Without using the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu simply glanced at him and knew that Luo Hu was a peak Respected warrior and was just one step away from Sage warrior.

Luo Hu stared at Lin Xiu.

Judging from his many years of battle between life and death, Lin Xiu was not easy.

He clenched the long spear in his hand and the source strength of his body continued to explode.

The rest of the warriors also retreated to the back, staring at Lin Xiu.

The weapons in the hands of some warriors fell to the ground when they attacked Lin Xiu and at this time they directly released their own source mark power.

He wanted to attack Lin Xiu from a distance.

crackling-

Especially one of the warriors, as the purple source mark on his forehead appeared, a burst of purple lightning immediately charged towards Lin Xiu!

“Die!”

He shouted loudly and those lightning bolts directly covered Lin Xiu’s body.

But what shocked him was that with the lightning bursting out of his source mark power covering Lin Xiu’s body, Lin Xiu still did not use the ‘Sphere’ to resist, but let the lightning strike his body!

Nothing, Lin Xiu’s body was totally fine!

Those flashes of lightning that could scorch the ground had no effect on him at all!

“Let me do it!!!”

The rest of the warriors also used their own source mark powers in turn.

Fire, Frost…

All sorts of attributes of source mark power rushed toward Lin Xiu.

rumbling rumbling—

The surrounding ground shook wildly at this time.

Due to the impact of those Source mark power, the spot where Lin Xiu was standing at had a huge explosion.

In an instant, the entire ground was covered in dust.
