Chapter 468: Evolution of Rollie

“Hmm… I see.” Upon hearing Lin Xiu’s recount, Dean Baili nodded his head thoughtfully.

“Okay, I have said everything that should be said, should you make up for it now?” Lin Xiu looked at him and said.

“You kid.” When Dean Baili heard Lin Xiu’s words, he was taken aback for a while, then shook his head a little helplessly, then brought Lin Xiu into his small vault again.

“I want these two.” Lin Xiu looked around, then directly picked up the two diamond skill cards, and said to Dean Baili.

Dean Baili glanced at the two diamond skill cards in Lin Xiu’s hand, then nodded and said, “Take them.”

Lin Xiu was not pretentious – this was what he deserved, so he put the two diamond skill cards into his pocket directly.

“I’ll get going then.” Lin Xiu looked at the Dean Baili, then walked out of the gate without looking back.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s back, Dean Baili shook his head but the look in his eyes seemed to change a little.

“He’s really an old fox.” Lin Xiu walked out at this time and couldn’t help muttering to himself.

He took out the two diamond skill cards from his pocket and seemed very pleased.

With these two diamond skill cards, he could practice new skills.

“Lin Xiu!?” Just when Lin Xiu was walking on the road, a voice suddenly called out to him and a figure appeared in front of him.

Ouyang Hang.

“Oh, it’s you.” Lin Xu looked at Ouyang Hang, suddenly showing a meaningful smile.

Seeing the smile at the corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth, Ouyang Hang somehow felt a chill then he took a step back subconsciously and glanced at Lin Xiu, “You woke up?”

“Oh, seems like you knew.” Lin Xiu raised his brow at this moment and then said aloud.

Ouyang Hang still had a bit of power, it was not difficult to find out that he was lying in a coma in the hospital.

“Hng! I want you to sleep forever, that’d be great.” Ouyang Hang stared at Lin Xiu, then said coldly.

“Unfortunately, it can’t be as you wish.” Lin Xiu said and shrugged.

“Sooner or later, I will defeat you with my own hands!” Ouyang Hang saw Lin Xiu’s indifference, clenched his hands into fists, and then glared at Lin Xiu before leaving in the other direction.

Ouyang Hang’s expression became more cautious.

Because he could feel that Lin Xiu’s strength seemed to have grown a lot.

“Damn, is this guy a monster?” Ouyang Hang suddenly felt a sense of powerlessness. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Lin Xiu’s strength has increased too quickly and he wanted to take advantage of Lin Xiu’s coma and train well to surpass him at first.

But what he didn’t expect was that after Lin Xiu woke up this time, he became even stronger.

How did he do it?

The more he thought about it, the more he didn’t understand – Ouyang Hang became a little crazy.

“Not a human! This guy is definitely not a human!”

At the same time, Lin Xiu had already walked to the villa.

When he first entered to the courtyard of the villa, he saw a white figure flying towards him.

What is this?

“Squeak——”

Lin Xiu was taken aback, then he found an ice crystal white bird that had grown slightly bigger, standing on his shoulder!

“Xiao Bai?” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise when he saw this scene.

“Squeak——”

Ice Crystal White Bird seemed very happy, rubbing his little head against Lin Xiu’s cheek.

Lin Xiu smiled, and he could clearly feel the icy air emanating from its body.

It was a bit cold like he was being rubbed against an ice cube.

Now the ice crystal white bird has grown up, and its body could automatically become cold even in this kind of weather.

It no longer need to stay in the refrigeration box.

“Gu Gu——”

And at this time, there was also a strange noise from the front side.

“This is… Rollie?” Lin Xiu’s eyes widened when he heard the familiar voice, and then he saw a round object that was rolling over.

Its body was covered with white hair, and it looked chubby.

“Rollie…you became like this…” Lin Xiu’s jaw dropped when he saw the current Rollie and he was in disbelief.

Because of the dense snow-white hairs on the body, Rollie looked like a snowball.

“Gu?”

Rollie rolled under Lin Xiu’s feet and opened his eyes at this moment.

A pair of dark eyes!

“Damn!” Lin Xiu was completely shocked – Rollie actually has eyes!

Rollie looked like a special creature.

Lin Xiu squatted down and took a good look at it, then was a little bit dumbfounded, “You are…evolved?”

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked towards the other side, and he happened to see Luo Yue’s figure.

Luo Yue also seemed to see Lin Xiu here, and the two of them looked at each other, and Luo Yue’s eyes instantly dodged.

“Why don’t you take a break?” Lin Xiu said without thinking about it.

Because he knew that Luo Yue had been taking care of him these days, and she should be very tired now.

“No need.” Luo Yue shook her head, then seemed to think of something, and handed a black box to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu looked at the black box that Luo Yue had brought over, and was stunned, “This is…”

“What you brought back that day.” Luo Yue said indifferently after passing the box to Lin Xiu.

What I brought back that day?

Lin Xiu was startled, and then instinctively took the black box.

The box was very heavy as if there was something in it.

Wait, this can’t be…

At this time, Lin Xiu seemed to recall something and his eyes widened. After he opened the box, a faint golden light appeared.

Energy body!?

When Lin Xiu saw what was inside, the pupils in his eyes constricted.

As Lin Xiu expected, this was indeed the energy body he found.

He put it in his battle suit pocket but after he passed out, he didn’t know what happened.

“I didn’t let them know, I hid it.” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

Lin Xiu nodded, looking at the weird stone that was glowing with a pale golden light and said to Luo Yue, “By the way, Luo Yue, do you know what it is? “
