Chapter 101: Dark Edge!

Lin Xiu squinted his eyes, then slowly opened them and found that there was a black long spear in the wooden box!

He wasn’t sure what material it was made of but the black long spear actually reflected a cold light.

He touched the spear with his fingers and immediately felt a sound that seemed to resonate.

“This spear is called Dark Edge,” Baili Haoling said.

“A long spear left behind by the spear master, Bai Lirui.”

‘Bai Lirui!?’

Lin Xiu was stunned when he heard the name, then he thought of the founder of the skill ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’, it was Bai Lirui!!!

And his spear arts were well known in the world.

“You’re not his son, are you?” Lin Xiu asked in shock.

As they both had the surname ‘Bai’ and it was amazing that Baili Haoling could get his hands on this spear.

“Nonsense, we just share the same surname.” Baili Haoling glared at Lin Xiu and said.

Lin Xiu rubbed his head in embarrassment and slowly picked up this spear.

“Damn, it’s heavy…” When Lin Xiu picked it up, he felt his hands sink and his waist was about to bend over.

He clenched his teeth and used all his strength to hold the spear in the air.

“How heavy is this?” Lin Xiu took a deep breath and asked.

With his current strength, even holding this long spear was so hard, just how heavy was it!?

“500KG.” At this moment, Baili Haoling put up his five fingers and said.

“So heavy?” Lin Xiu was taken aback.

No wonder it was so difficult to lift this long spear with his hands, and he wasn’t even in the weight-bearing state at the moment.

“Of course, it’s made of black iron meteorites and there’s only one long spear in the world that is made of black iron meteorites,” Baili Haoling said.

‘Black iron meteorites?’ Hearing this, Lin Xiu could not help but gasp. According to historical records, there was a black meteorite in outer space that hit the earth a hundred years ago. Although this meteorite wasn’t small, it destroyed a city.

Of course, it was a good thing for humans because the city was full of zombies and mutated animals.

Although the meteorite passed through the atmosphere and hit the ground, the size was still quite large like a gigantic black rock.

Some people took the stone back and forged it with sophisticated instruments, forging twelve different weapons.

The sharpness of these weapons wasn’t the best, but its toughness was certainly top-notch.

And it was the priceless kind.

“Thank you,” Lin Xiu said earnestly. This was definitely a big gift.

“Knock it off,” Baili Haoling snorted, then curled his lips.

It was then that his phone rang.

“Well, I have a mission and have to go back, so it’s goodbye here.” Baili Haoling looked at his phone, then smiled at Lin Xiu.

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu nodded, then said to Baili Haoling, “I’ll give this to you.”

He seemed to like the android wolf and the android wolf wasn’t very useful for Lin Xiu’s upcoming journey, it would at most be a transportation tool.

And there were a lot of people eyeing this thing like the two men who tried to rob him that morning.

“Haha, you should have said so earlier,” Baili Haoling smiled, then unceremoniously rode on top of the android wolf.

Lin Xiu was speechless – this fella was just waiting for him to offer it to him ah…

“Goodbye, then! If you have a chance, come to Sky City to find me!” As soon as Baili Haoling said that, he rode away on the android wolf.

‘Sky City?’

It was the largest city and was equipped with state-of-the-art suspension technology, which allowed the entire city to be suspended in the air.

Also, not everyone could enter. People who entered that city were at least a rank 5 warrior or people with outstanding achievements in science.

Lin Xiu shook his head. It was not the time to care about these things and he’d better prepare to leave for the Path of Death.

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear with one hand using all the strength in his body and began to brandish it.

As the Dark Edge spear moved, it seemed to leave a track in the air as rays of light appeared.

Looking at this long spear, Lin Xiu liked it more and more. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

And the box containing the Dark Edge spear seemed to be made of very high-grade materials. Lin Xiu hesitated, but still put the spear inside.

At the back of this box, there was a black rope that seemed like it was for people to carry it on their backs.

“Oh right, what’s this for?” Carrying this spear box, Lin Xiu saw a button-like thing at the side. Lin Xiu paused for a moment, then pressed it.

Whoosh——

That was when the whole spear box shook and the spear emerged out of it.

Lin Xiu quickly caught the Dark Edge spear.

So, this box actually had this function which was a little surprising for Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu walked out of the Warrior Union hall, then took out his phone and began to navigate.

The Black Sea City was 1,500 km from the Path of death and would take half an hour to reach by the A85’s ultra-fast maglev train.

It was still early, and after a little hesitation, Lin Xiu decided to set off.

At the same time, at the other side of the mansion, a middle-aged man sipped his tea while listening to the report from a man kneeling on the ground.

“You said those two useless things were killed?” The middle-aged man took a sip of tea at this moment and said lightly.

“Yes,” the man, who was kneeling on the ground, broke out in cold sweat on his forehead.

“Useless! Two rank 2 warriors can’t even deal with a rank 1 warrior!?” The middle-aged man suddenly became enraged as he slammed his teacup on the ground and roared.

“I’m only friendly terms with the Tang family in Xing Yao City and I was supposed to return a favor.”

“But he killed two people from the Temple of Transformation. We cannot let him go and must make him stay in Black Sea city and be killed!” The man’s face grew colder and colder at this moment and said.

“Yes!”

“Sorry, the A85 trains depart only at eight o’clock every morning.” When Lin Xiu arrived at the train station, the attendant said to him.

“Huh? Aren’t there three trains that go there every day?”
