1316 Ice!

“The God King has something to deal with for the time being. He will come to the final.”

Noble god Riyan seemed to know what the God warrior wanted to ask, so he spoke lightly at this time.

“Okay.”

The man nodded slightly.

!!

At this time, everyone’s eyes were still on the battle platform.

“go!”

At this time, the source mark on Ning Yu’s forehead glowed even more dazzlingly.

With his roar, the water that had spread to the entire battle platform gathered directly in the sky.

Formed into a huge flood dragon, it opened its teeth and claws toward Lin Xiu.

Such a powerful force…

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, his eyes were full of surprise.

It is also the first time he has seen someone’s source mark power burst out such a powerful attribute power.

And the water released by his source mark power was different from ordinary water.

My own hellfire even had a faint feeling of being restrained.

Lin Xiu also calmed down at this moment. After taking a deep breath, his body flew directly into the air.

“Humph!”

Looking at Lin Xiu flying into the air, Ning Yu snorted coldly and with a thought, the huge flood dragon formed by the water rushed toward him!

Lin Xiu looked at the charging water dragon, and his body’s source strength exploded crazily.

Then transferred to his hands.

Lin Xiu first activated the ‘Full Blown Profound Intent’ skill, then used ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’!

After activating the Profound intent, the power generated from the ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’ was even stronger.

Already able to exert 100% of the power!

The spear in his hand slashed toward the charging water dragon. At this moment, he could clearly see Lin Xiu’s White Moon spear and it turned into a huge phantom.

“What a powerful force!”

The audience around was amazed when they saw this scene.

They already knew that the water dragon was terrifying, but they didn’t expect Lin Xiu to be able to unleash such a terrifying skill.

Boom——

At the next moment, as Lin Xiu’s spear slashed at the water dragon’s body, there was an extremely loud sound.

At this moment, the water dragon also exploded directly.

It turned into a large number of water droplets and splashed around.

But the moment these water droplets splashed out, it seemed to have stopped in an instant.

In the surrounding space, there are thousands of tiny water droplets floating.

not good!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes suddenly shrank.

“Hehehe…”

At this time, Ning Yu showed a sinister smile and the source mark on his forehead continued to shine brightly.

Whoosh whoosh——

In the next moment, these drops of water rushed toward Lin Xiu’s body from all directions!

Bang bang bang——

These drops of water were different from ordinary drops of water. Although Lin Xiu unfolded the ‘Sphere’ at this time, when it hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, Lin Xiu felt the entire ‘Sphere’ making loud noises.

Moreover, his extremely hard Sphere’ had cracks appearing due to the impact of thousands of water droplets!

the hellfire on the surface of Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ had no way to evaporate these water droplets!

“go to hell!”

Looking at this scene, Ning Yu laughed ferociously. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

He has studied Lin Xiu long ago and the incomparably powerful water attribute power he is using now is just enough to restrain Lin Xiu’s fire!

Seeing that there was still a large amount of water-attribute energy blooming from his body, Lin Xiu continued to release the source strength to strengthen his ‘Sphere’ at this time and at the same time, there was a murderous intent in his eyes.

“Do you want to kill me…”

“Do you think that I only know the power of the fire attribute…”

While Lin Xiu was muttering to himself, the White Moon spear in his hand began to glow white because of the source strength of Lin Xiu’s body.

“It’s useless, fire attribute power is useless!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu seemed to want to use skill again, Ning Yu, who was below, roared and said at the same time, the water on the battle platform began to gather again.

It seems that new water dragons are about to gather again!

“Hm?”

Noble god Riyan, who was watching the match over there, could clearly feel that the temperature had dropped.

...

He looked toward Lin Xiu and there was a look of surprise in his eyes.

This kid, has other powers hidden?

At this time, Lin Xiu’s Heart of frost was in motion and the water droplets that hit him all froze at this moment, then fell directly to the ground.

‘Profound Intent: Freezing the Distance’!

While Lin Xiu was talking to himself, he waved the White Moon spear in both hands directly into the air.

An incomparably terrifying icy air was released in an instant with the wave of White Moon’s spear, sweeping the entire space!

Kakaka——

The battle platform, which seemed to have turned into a river, was frozen in an instant at this moment.

Ning Yu was still standing on the battle platform with both feet and with the water, his feet were frozen below.

Moreover, the water dragon that had just condensed into shape was also directly frozen by the ice at this moment!

“Damn…”

...

Ning Yu didn’t expect that this situation would suddenly become like this.

This kid is obviously a warrior of the fire attribute, so how could he suddenly use the energy of the ice attribute!

Although his water-attributed energy can restrain Lin Xiu’s fire-attributed energy, there is really no way to deal with the ice-attributed power!

Kala Kala——

And at this time, with Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the ice blocks on the surrounding ground instantly cracked, then quickly gathered toward the sky.

This is the ‘water’ formed by the water attribute power released by Ning Yu just now. Although it is frozen at this time, there is still a powerful force coming out.

Moreover, after being frozen into ice cubes, they were no longer under Ning Yu’s control!

What is he going to do!?

Seeing this scene, Ning Yu’s eyes widened and the pupils in his eyes suddenly shrank.

These suspended ice blocks soon gathered an ice dragon with the same shape as the water dragon just now!

“go!”

Lin Xiu looked down at Ning Yu, whose feet were frozen and rushed down with the spear in his hand.

And that ice dragon also charged downwards!

Oh no!

Watching this scene, Ning Yu’s face became extremely ugly and he instinctively felt that his life was in danger.

But at this time, he can’t admit defeat, otherwise all previous efforts will be wasted!

At this time, the legs wanted to break free from the ice, but there was no way to break free.

‘Sphere’!!!

There is no way, Ning Yu could only forcibly resist.

The moment the huge ice dragon stabbed down with Lin Xiu’s White Moon spear, it also impacted the ‘Sphere’ he unfolded!

Boom——
