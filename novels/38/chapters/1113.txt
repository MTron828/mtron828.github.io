Chapter 1114: Level 69!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Boom boom —

The power of various attributes rushed toward Lin Xiu and a huge sound broke out in an instant.

Lin Xiu didn’t use the ‘Sphere’ at all, letting those attacks hit his body.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s resistance had reached its peak.

Lin Xiu’s body was destroyed but the attribute energy collar around his neck was still there.

The control of attribute energy was much stronger than theirs.

“I’ll give it all back to you!!!”

As Lin Xiu roared, he swung the spear forcefully and those terrifying electric currents, flames and other attribute powers suddenly attacked these Sage warriors instead!

“What!!!”

Although these attribute energies were released by them.

But at this time, the impact on their own bodies still caused them to let out a scream.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly. When they were about to unfold the ‘Sphere’, the dark energy ball on the neck jumped wildly in an instant.

‘Silence’!

With the triggering of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, at this moment, Lin Xiu’s body suddenly released a large amount of dark energy.

Because of the dark attribute energy ball, the release of the dark attribute energy appeared more powerful.

In an instant, it spread to those Sage warriors.

The entire sky seemed to be suddenly covered by darkness!

“‘Silence’!!! It’s ‘Silence’! Run!”

Some Sage warriors clearly felt something and roared loudly at this time.

However, the impact of this dark attribute energy was too fast and before they had time to dodge, they were covered by these dark attribute energies.

And these dark attribute energies were very strange, even if they unfold the ‘Sphere’, these dark attribute energies could directly penetrate their ‘Sphere’ and instantly enter their bodies.

A wailing and screaming sound came out continuously.

They frantically mobilized the source strength of their bodies and wanted to break free from those dark energies.

But at this time, the source strength of Lin Xiu’s body had already gathered towards the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

‘Heaven Breaking Strike’!

Lin Xiu looked at the Sage warriors who were still trying to break free from the dark attribute energy and he waved the Dark Edge spear full of infinite power in his hand!

Boom—

With a loud sound, those Sage warrior-level warriors, at this moment, were directly smashed into countless pieces by the powerful force that erupted from the swing of the Dark Edge spear!

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for killing the Sage warrior-level warrior and gain experience…”

“…”

“Ding! Congratulations to the master on your successful upgrade! The current level is sixty-nine!”

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for obtaining the ‘divine blessing’!”

With the sound of the system prompts in his mind, a white light bloomed from the sky.

Then it irradiated Lin Xiu’s body.

With the white light shining on Lin Xiu’s body, Lin Xiu could clearly feel a warm feeling.

Very warm.

The source strength that was just consumed seems to have been replenished at this time.

When he entered the interface of the system, he could see that his system skills and all the cooldowns had been refreshed!

Sure enough, it was the same as before!

This divine blessing could refresh the cooldown of all his system skills.

Moreover, he upgraded himself twice in a row and both received divine blessings.

“Right, leveled up…”

怒气蓄力:0/100

Rage build-up: 0/100

“damn!”

Looking at the attributes displayed by the system, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

His physique points, from more than 7,000 before, had suddenly become 9,000!

And it’s even higher than his strength points!

It was the highest of all attributes.

“Is it because I turned into a skeleton?”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself, dumbfounded.

Without thinking too much, Lin Xiu directly added the potential points obtained from the upgrade to his strength attribute. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

As soon as the attribute points were added, Lin Xiu felt his own strength and became stronger.

He was now level 69.

He just had to level up once more and he would reach level 70.

For every five levels, one can cross a rank.

In other words, when he reaches level 70, Lin Xiu will be a warrior god!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu couldn’t hold back his excitement.

The energy barrier has just been about 80% destroyed – it was almost completely destroyed.

At this time, Wu Hao’s figure also appeared in the courtyard of the City Lord council.

He said helplessly to Zhao Yongyuan and Sima Qiang.

The energy barrier that can cover the entire Baidi City was not fully installed.

Therefore, it was far from being hard and strong enough.

“Fortunately, they were all destroyed.”

Sima Qiang heaved a sigh of relief at this time.

At this time, there was also a look of shock in his eyes that could not be concealed.

There were more than 20 Sage warriors and they were all dealt with by Lin Xiu!

How powerful must one be to do this!

Could it be that Lin Xiu’s power has reached the level of a god warrior!?

“By the way, what about the city lord?”

Wu Hao said subconsciously at this time.

Now he has subconsciously called Lin Xiu the city lord.

Because this Baidi City belongs to Lin Xiu.

“I’m here.”

At this moment, a voice came from behind.

When Wu Hao heard Lin Xiu’s figure, he subconsciously turned around and looked behind him.

He originally had a smile on his face, but when he turned to look behind him, the smile completely froze.

Because in front of him is a golden skeleton!

At this moment, Wu Hao’s body trembled and he subconsciously took a few steps back.

“Skeleton… skeleton…”

And a talking skeleton!

“This is the city lord.”

Sima Qiang and Zhao Yongyuan looked at each other and said helplessly.

Just now, they were all startled.

But looking at the weapon in Lin Xiu’s hand and the skills he just used, it was obvious that it was Lin Xiu.

There was absolutely no one else who could use ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’ and ‘Silence’, or even those flaming birds.

“City Lord!?”
