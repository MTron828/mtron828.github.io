Chapter 434: Lin Xiu’s “Sphere”

Bump–

Another huge sound rang. Although the man unfolded the ‘Sphere’ at this time, the huge impact still affected his body.

At this moment, his whole body was like a kite with a broken line, flying to the back.

Si si si——

But at this moment, there was a strange sound and Lin Xiu saw several steel wire-like things appearing on the man’s battle suit.

And at the end of the steel wire, there seems to be a small hook, which directly hooked the edge of the platform.

In the next instant, as his body exerted force, he flew back in an instant and stood directly on the edge of the platform, he did not fall at all.

Pffff——

Despite this, the powerful impact still made him taste sweetness in his throat and a mouthful of blood spat out instantly.

“Damn…”

He wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth with his sleeve and looked at Lin Xiu with a look of shock.

Lin Xiu’s strength was really terrifying. If he hadn’t unfolded the ‘Sphere’ just now, he would have been cut in half by Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear.

“Oh? There are such things in the battle suit.” Lin Xiu looked at this scene, raised his brows, and said aloud.

This platform was very spacious. Looking at the back, Lin Xiu could clearly see that Luo Yue and Yu Muchen were still fighting.

The two people moved very swiftly and coupled with the use of body skills, they were like two shadows and nobody could see them clearly, only a series of cold flashes of weapons constantly colliding.

Moreover, for this level of battle, it was very troublesome for Lin Xiu to intervene, not to mention that there were three rank 6 warriors around.

Now as long as he dealt with these three rank 6 warriors, he could go over and help Luo Yue!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he looked at the men behind him who were attacking with a saber and a rod.

When their weapon was about to hit Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu moved slightly and quickly avoided the attacks of the two of them like a shadow!

“What is this!?”

Some students were shocked when they saw this scene because they had just clearly seen that Lin Xiu was about to be attacked.

But in a split second, following Lin Xiu’s dodge, there were many illusions and everyone couldn’t tell which was the real Lin Xiu!

“Damn!”

Ouyang Hang, who saw this scene, couldn’t help but stand up excitedly and cursed at Lin Xiu.

This is the body skill!

And it was also a body skill that he was very familiar with – ‘Without A Trace’!!!

What the hell is going on, how did he learn this body skill!?

Ouyang Hang tried to use it at the beginning, after all, it was ranked the world’s 11th skill card, he certainly wouldn’t be so stupid to exchange it directly with Lin Xiu.

When he used this skill card, it was useless. Also, when he used source strength to communicate with the skill card and extract the information inside, the skill card would absorb his source strength frantically.

Like a bottomless pit.

And no one from his family managed to learn it successfully.

That’s why it became a ‘useless card’.

At this time, seeing that Lin Xiu’s footwork was exactly the same as described in the legend, how could this not shock Ouyang Hang? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“This guy is cheating!” Ouyang Hang’s eyes were full of jealousy and he slapped the armrest of the seat, then said bitterly.

But soon, Ouyang Hang calmed down and continued to watch the match.

At this time, Lin Xiu, relying on this weird body skill, dodged the attack of the two men but he was almost shot out. In the end, he relied on some weird little hooks to stay on the platform. At this moment, the guy holding the warhammer had already rushed towards Lin Xiu from the back!

The power of his whole body was running and his speed had reached the extreme.

Boom–

At the next moment, when his warhammer was about to hit Lin Xiu, the “Sphere” on Lin Xiu’s body unfolded again.

The warhammer hit Lin Xiu’s unfolded ‘Sphere’ and in a moment, a dull sound could be heard.

Lin Xiu didn’t move at all but his ‘Sphere’ was different from the normal ‘Sphere’.

At this time, the “Sphere” on Lin Xiu’s body had an electric arc and the voltage of this electric arc was very high!

Crackling——

The electricity from the arc was directly transmitted to his warhammer, then transmitted to his entire body!

“Ah!!!”

His body was covered with a lot of lightning in this short moment.

He didn’t have electric shock resistance training. At this time, after being severely shocked by the lightning, his eyes and mouth widened and he wailed loudly.

The severe pain, accompanied by the numbness of his body, caused the warhammer in his hand to fall to the ground.

Whoosh——

Lin Xiu didn’t give him any more chance, he was holding the Dark Edge spear in his right hand and with a sudden sweep, he directly shot him out!

Thud–

The body of the man who flew out directly hit the wall behind him. There were a lot of cracks in the wall and he was stuck on the wall that caved in.

Horrifying!

“What a terrifying strength!” Seeing this scene, the associations were all shocked.

Not just freshman students, even sophomore students, seeing the strength that Lin Xiu showed at this time, all had a lingering fear.

“Teacher Nan, Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ seems different from everyone else.” Although some of the Class 10 students of the South Academy were very happy to see Lin Xiu knocking a man out, they were surprised to see that Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ had so many weird arcs on it.

And these arcs were very dense on the Sphere, like a lightning ball surrounding Lin Xiu!

“I don’t know what it is.” Nan Zhengjun looked at this scene with a wry smile and said.
