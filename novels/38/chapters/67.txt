Chapter 68: Victory Or Defeat

“Hahaha, you’re not dead yet!” Ye Gulin laughed loudly at this moment.

He used all his strength for that attack just now, even a rank 2 warrior who was almost as strong as him didn’t dare to face it head-on so he didn’t expect that this chap actually didn’t dodge.

“It’s a pity that you jumped off the stage and lost.”

At this moment, as the thick dust dispersed, the entire stage could be seen and there was a huge dent on it.

The middle part was most severely dented.

One must know that the stage was made of special materials and its stiffness was comparable to steel, but it was actually destroyed to this state.

“Lin… Lin Xiu.” Yang Tian looked at the stage in disbelief. ‘Is Lin Xiu really dead?’

A lot of girls covered their eyes and didn’t dare to see the tragic situation on the stage.

“It’s not going to get someone killed, is it?” The school leaders on the seats frowned when they saw the scene here.

Although there was nothing much about the death of an ordinary student, it wouldn’t leave a good impression, especially when Mr. Ye was still here.

But what made them puzzled was that Mr. Ye had a smile on his face as he looked at the stage with interest…

‘What’s going on?’

“Almost… got killed by you.”

Ye Gulin, who was still laughing, had his smile frozen on his face.

“Lin Xiu is fine!!!” Yang Tian rubbed his eyes and exclaimed in surprise.

Those who had covered their eyes also came to their senses and looked over.

As the dust dissipated, Lin Xiu was seen standing in the middle, holding the spear in his hands in a defensive position.

All the clothes on his body were torn and he looked a little sloppy.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, then slowly pulled out his feet that were stuck on the ground.

He wanted to use ‘Fury’ only during the last part of the match, but it seemed like he didn’t have a choice now.

If it wasn’t for the forced enhancement of his attributes using ‘Fury’, he would be doomed just now.

But even so, he suffered a lot of injuries.

“How is that possible! How come you’re not dead!!!” Ye Gulin’s face became extremely pale.

And that elated Zhang Lin’s jaw dropped when he saw that Lin Xiu was fine.

‘That didn’t kill him?’

Crack, crack——

Standing up, Lin Xiu twisted his body and there was a crisp sound of bone cracking.

‘Fury’ only lasted three minutes and Lin Xiu had to make use of these three minutes to attack, otherwise, he would be in trouble!

Lin Xiu looked at Ye Gulin who rushed over again and his pupils constricted. He held his spear and thrust it forward!

His spear was like electricity that pierced directly at Ye Gulin who was charging over!

“It’s no use!” Ye Gulin roared as he instinctively dodged the attack and hammered down toward Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu did not use the silver spear to block this time and used the tip of his spear to jab the hammer instead.

“Tired of living, huh!” Ye Gulin smirked when he saw this.

How could the tip of a spear pierce through his hammer? It was hilarious!

Dang!!!

The sound of metals colliding rang out, it was so loud that it seemed like it could damage one’s eardrums.

Ye Gulin felt his hand becoming numb and the hammer in his hand nearly fell to the ground.

With a large amount of source strength permeating, the Silver Immortal Soul spear had become extremely hard.

His hammer simply couldn’t bend Lin Xiu’s spear.

Instead, the tip of the spear left a dent in his hammer.

“‘Violent Hammer Storm’!” Ye Gulin’s eyes reddened and he glared at Lin Xiu like he wanted to smash him into minced meat.

No one had ever made him so miserable!

Silver skill- ‘Violent Hammer Storm’; this skill gave the user an explosive force for a short period of time. The hammer swung like a phantom and it was just as strong as the ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’.

“‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!” Lin Xiu did not show any weakness at all and also used his skill!

Dang dang dang!!! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The clashing of the weapons kept ringing, and Lin Xiu’s spear blocked every attack.

The ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ stabbed at a faster speed; for every wave of Ye Gulin’s hammer, Lin Xiu could thrust his spear twice!!!

Tear——

Following Lin Xiu’s attack, Ye Gulin’s clothes were torn apart!

“No way! No way!!!”

Ye Gulin went crazy. He never thought that Lin Xiu actually hid his strength.

One must know that the skill, ‘Tiger breaks the cage’ used up a lot of source strength and he didn’t have much source strength left now!

Once he had no more source strength left, his ability would be greatly diminished.

“Ah!!!” At this moment, Ye Gulin was like a crazy person, constantly brandishing his hammer toward Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu knitted his brows and moved sideways to dodge.

Bang bang bang——

The whole stage was destroyed by Ye Gulin.

“Ye Gulin lost.” Luo Li heaved a sigh of relief and said.

Although it now seemed that Lin Xiu was dodging, Ye Gulin was already like an arrow at the end of its flight. At this moment, as long as Lin Xiu continued this way, he would easily win this match.

And his guess was right; after dodging his attacks about a dozen times, Lin Xiu’s spear swooped in the air and Ye Gulin’s hammer directly knocked against Lin Xiu’s spear. There was a loud “bang” and the hammer was sent flying away.

The tip of the spear was directly in front of Ye Gulin’s face at this moment.

“You lost.”

There was a sudden silence all around. Ye Gulin, who was ranked 4th and known as ‘the Tiger of Xing Yao’, actually lost!

A lot of people couldn’t seem to digest this fact, it was simply unbelievable.

“Hahaha, Lin Xiu won! Lin Xiu won!” Yang Tian did not care about the dumbfounded people around him and yelled happily.

As Yang Tian’s words came out, the people around him suddenly came to their senses.

There was an uproar at the scene.

Zhang Lin’s face changed drastically at this moment and he fell directly from the chair.

‘How could it be? Ye Gulin lost!?’

“Haha, prepare to eat the stage!” Yang Tian looked at the student next to him at this moment and said out loud.

The student looked as if he had eaten a fly and stared at Yang Tian with hatred, then hurried away.

“I declare now that Lin Xiu has won this match!”

“Lin Xiu!”

“Lin Xiu!!!”

The whole place was in an uproar – this was an incredible fight.

But at this moment, there was a sinister smile on Ye Gulin’s face as he took a black round object out from his pocket!
