Boom – –

The tip of the spear was still stuck onto the head of one of the rock monsters as it did not completely pierce through; only a small part of the spear managed to enter the monster’s head. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Then, the rock monster’s right fist twisted in an inhumane angle and headed straight towards Lin Xiu who was on top of its head!

Boom – –

Lin Xiu was hit by the fist and with the huge impact, he was thrown far away onto the ground.

As soon as he landed onto the ground, Lin Xiu quickly steadied himself and tried to stand up straight.

But, as he stood up, he could feel a heavy feeling on his chest that was followed by bleeding slowly spilling out of the corner of his mouth.

“Damn it...”

Lin Xiu looked at the rock monsters who were racing towards him and he frowned.

He was trying to look for one of the rock monsters where his spear was still pierced onto.

The body of the rock monsters were too hard and even if he put in all his strength, he only managed to put in a small part of the spear into it.

Plus, this was the first time that Lin Xiu had ever fought something so weird and he had no idea what he should do instead.

Seeing how these rock monsters were attacking him like madmen, Lin Xiu thought of something and immediately released a large amount of light from underneath his feet.

The light slowly spreaded through the ground from Lin Xiu and it looked like a massive array.

‘Heavenly Array’!

With the release of the ‘Heavenly Array’, Lin Xiu could clearly feel his strength growing.

If he wasn’t wrong, his strength has been increased to at least 120%!

The amount that he had extra was the amount of strength that the other party would be losing!

Of course….these compressed effects would be less effective when it came to overpowering enemies.

But, it was already sufficient for Lin Xiu at this moment because he noticed that the rock monsters were running at a much slower speed than before!

“Come on! Let’s see who’s stronger!’

Lin Xiu thought of it as a challenge as he held his fist and at the very next moment, there was a bright red glow that appeared on his hands.

These boxing gloves were the ones that he had gotten previously from the lucky-draw, known as the ‘Red Moon’.

After so long, the boxing gloves were still useful even when he had been cultivating in the lava.

Bi Li Hua La – –

As the source energy in Lin Xiu’s body started increasing, there was a vast amount of lightning that appeared on his fist.

The rock monsters were getting closer to Lin Xiu and had swung their huge fist towards Lin Xiu’s body!

Lin Xiu leaped and landed on top of the fist of one of the rock monsters. It only took him a few leaps before he landed on top of its head and with the scary looking fist, he punched the rock monster on its head!

Koong Loong – –

As the punch landed on the rock monster’s head, there were multiple cracks that appeared on its cheeks.

There were also tiny pieces of rocks that slowly fell off its face.

However, the rock monster was acting as if it wasn’t affecting at all and was about to grab Lin Xiu.

At that moment, Lin Xiu leaped and turned in the air at a weird angle in order to dodge the attack.

Then, he managed to gently land on the ground.

Koong Loong – –

As soon as he landed on the ground, the other rock monsters gathered around him and started attacking him once again.

Boom – –

While he wasn’t aware, Lin Xiu couldn’t dodge one of the attacks and landed face forward with one of the fist of the rock monsters.

The huge impact from it caused Lin Xiu to feel as if he had been knocked by a train.

He wiped off the blood that sipped from the corner of his lips and stood up.

There was no fear in Lin Xiu’s eyes, instead it was filled with a look of surprise.

This was because he could clearly feel that his strength had been slowly increasing while he fought a close combat with these rock monsters.

Although it was a very mild increase, it was still something unexpected of a rank 7 warrior.

Since it would be even more difficult for higher rank warriors to cultivate and ritalin.

Lin Xiu decided not to use ‘Rage’ and continued fighting close combat with the rock monsters.

He realised that by fighting physically with these rock monsters, he was able to improve his physical strength!

Time passed by quickly and another day past.

Lin Xiu was still fighting the monsters and they were also continuously fighting Lin Xiu with no sense of exhaustion.

“It’s already been a day and he’s still there? Could it be that there’s nothing there?”

Lin Xiu was still training his physical strength by fighting with the rock monsters but the students from the Sacred Region Academy were getting impatient as they waited outside the tower.

It has already been one day and one night. Lin Xiu’s name was still on top of the list but it still showed that he was on the 93th floor.

Next to the names, there would be an ‘X’ if the student had failed the mission and his name would be removed from the list.

But, Lin Xiu’s name was still on the list which shows that he was still trying to defeat that floor but he really was taking too much time on the same floor.

“This fella did the same thing as well when he challenged the previous floor. I have no idea how he does it, being on the same floor for such a long time.”

The other warriors were confused as well as this has not only happened once.

Usually, those who won the challenge would be immediately transported to the next level and those who failed would be sent to the ground. It would be highly unlikely that one would be able to stay on the same level for such a long time unless you kept dodging the monsters or machineries that would be attacking you from time to time.

“Hmph…..just be quiet and watch. I have a feeling that he is going to succeed.” Yang Qian walked over to those who were doubting Lin Xiu and stood up for him.

Initially, he wanted to steal Lin Xiu’s challenge card but he didn’t think that Lin Xiu was someone so powerful.

When a person is only a little stronger than himself he may be jealous but when he is so good it would be impossible for Yang Qian to defeat, he had no other choice but to admire Lin Xiu.

“I should end soon.”

Lin Xiu had no idea that he had already become the focus of all those students outside. He was still jumping around, trying to dodge the attacks of the rock monsters on the 93th floor.

Lin Xiu had no clothes left on him. The muscles all over his body that were exposed weren’t massive but it was obvious that they were much bigger than before.

There was also a large amount of sweat dripping from his body.

After taking an entire day and night to train, Lin Xiu managed to make good use of all the strength that he had gotten from the upgrades that he acquired previously.

Seeing how the rock monster in front of him was trying to attack him again with its huge fist, Lin Xiu did not dodge the attack. Instead, he grabbed his left hand into a fist and threw a punch!

“Heaven Split!”
