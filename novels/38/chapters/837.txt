Chapter 838: Aliens

Go to hell!

Then, with the long spear in his arm, Lin Xiu immediately thrusted it through the frog’s body.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

At that moment, Lin Xiu had already attacked multiple times and the creature’s body was now filled with bloody holes.

Then, it turned into a lump of sliced meat and fell onto the ground.

Luo Yue was also fighting one of the mutant purple frogs with her sword.

Although Luo Yue was only a master warrior, her sword skills were impeccable.

She was still much stronger than the mutant purple frog.

In the huge, wide ship, there were a lot of such creatures.

Due to how Lin Xiu had just killed one of them, most of the frogs decided to attack Lin Xiu! All of them were running towards him.

These mutant purple frogs were using weapons created by humans. With their overpowering strength, their attacks were extremely scary.

The air around them was filled with danger and continuous sounds of the air being sliced.

Clang clang clang – –

There were about 6 of them who attacked Lin Xiu at the same time.

Initially, Lin Xiu wanted to attack them first but he had no other choice but to defend instead.

Then, he quickly released his ‘Yuan’.

“Move!”

Lin Xiu screamed and drew a circle in the air with his spear and it immediately threw away all of the mutat purple frogs that were around him.

Following that, there was a black source mark that appeared on his forehead.

As Lin Xiu moved his mind, most of the mutant frogs, that were thrown into the distance earlier, were now trapped inside a semi-transparent array. None of them could move.

They were squashed inside the tiny array and there was no space for any movement.

“Explode!”

Lin Xiu moved his mind again. The array slowly expanded and then exploded.

As for the frogs inside the array, all of them turned into ash.

“AHHHHHHH!!!”

Chen Dong shouted as well as he finally chopped the frog into two.

XIu – –

Luo Yue swung her sword and with a cold sword aura, she sliced another mutant purple frog into half as it was trying to attack her.

“Huhuhu– – ”

As for the rest of the warriors, they finally got rid of the remaining mutant purple frog as well.

When Lin Xiu was done with most of the frogs with his array, the remaining ones of the ship had died as well.

The rest of them who survived were trying to catch their breath.

“I told all of you not to run into this place! Why didn’t you listen to me?!”

Chen Dong looked around and saw multiple bodies on the ground and screamed in rage.

The rest of the warriors were guilty and no one of them dared to look at Chen Dong.

They were being selfish.

Legendary says that there was lots of treasure on this ship and that’s what they were after.

However, they didn’t think that once they got onto the ship, there were no such things. Instead, they were attacked by those horrible frogs.

Most of them almost died.

“These frogs were hunting evolved beasts.”

Luo Yue looked around and was examining the bodies of the evolved beast that were lying on the ground.

There were also lots of odd crystals around them.

It was easy to guess that most of these frogs were trying to hunt for evolved beasts.

So that they could get these odd crystals.

“Hunting for evolved beasts?”

Chen Dong was feeling stunned.

“They should be trying to hunt for odd crystals from the evolved beats and then move it there.”

Lin Xiu then related it to the mountains of odd crystals that they saw previously.

If he was right, most of them were placed there by the frogs after robbing it from the evolved beasts.

“Could it be that…..these creatures are the ones who built this place?!”

One of the warriors asked out of fear.

“I don’t think so.”

Lin Xiu shook his head. These mutant frogs wouldn’t be that intelligent.

He can’t help but think that they were related to the humans inside the glass tank.

“Did you find what you wanted?”

Lin Xiu took a look at the ghost ship. There was nothing valuable inside the ship.

The entire ship was now a space that kept all the bodies of the evolved beasts.

The mutant purple frogs brought the evolved beasts onto the ship and then retrieved the odd crystals out of these bodies.

“I’m not the one looking for it. Master An is the one who’s trying to look for the ship.”

“I have no idea what he wants from this ship. This was the mission.”

Chen Dong answered helplessly.

“Does it mean that we only have to bring back the ghost ship?!”

One of the warriors asked.

Chen Dong frowned and said, “That’s right.”

“Hahahahah! We’re getting the life crystal!”

Most of the warriors were now delighted and none of them were afraid anymore.

Chen Dong felt cheated. These warriors have not done much and have completed their mission.

He was a little angry at them.

“We still have to figure out how to take the ship out.”

Chen Dong told the rest of them.

All of them were walking towards the cab to see how they could move the ship.

“This ship has been modified.”

When they got to the cab, Chen Dong told the rest of them when he saw the controls in the room.

“I don’t even know how to operate these controls.”

“The frogs are the ones who modified it?”

One of them asked out of curiosity. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“That’s stupid. How would that be possible? They might be scary but they aren’t that intelligent.”

Another warrior laughed as he answered.

“Let’s head back to the island. We’ll get our ship here and pull this ship out of here.”

Chen Dong thought about it before giving the commands.

The rest of them had no opinion as well.

As they got off the ship and were about to return to the lab, Lin Xiu looked at the human specimen inside the glass case and frowned.

“Could it be that these are from other planets?”

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, Chen Dong stopped. He turned around, looked at the human specimen inside the glass and nodded his head.

“It’s possible.”

“Look. If we look from outside these glasses, they seem to be shorter than humans.”

One of the female warriors looked at the glass and said to the rest of them.

These glass containers do make them look smaller than they might be.

However, when they took a closer look, they noticed that these humans were at least 3 metres tall. Most of them looked extremely muscular!

“These…..are aliens right…..?”

One of the warriors looked at the body that was three metres tall and asked.

Chen Dong was surprised as well.

But, even when he was shocked, he still shook his head.

“No matter what, let’s get out of here first.”

He didn’t want anymore trouble to happen.
