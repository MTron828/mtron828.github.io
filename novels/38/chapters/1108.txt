Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Ning Tianluo ignored Zhao Yongyuan, who was hit behind him, and continued to wave the sword in his hand, frantically attacking Sima Qiang, who was unfolding a “Sphere”.

Originally, Sima Qiang, who had cracks on the ‘Sphere’, was attacked by Ning Tianluo, and the ‘Sphere’ broke!

pfft—

With the explosion of the ‘Sphere’, Sima Qiang spat out a mouthful of blood.

“go to hell!”

!!

At this time, Ning Tianluo roared fiercely, and the sword in his hand slashed straight down!

The pupils in Sima Qiang’s eyes shrank.

Seeing that he was about to be cut in half by this sword, his eyes were full of horror.

Dang–

But at this moment, with a crisp sound, Sima Qiang saw the sword that Ning Tianluo swung down was blocked by a long spear!

“Master?!”

Sima Qiang’s face suddenly filled with surprise, and upon closer inspection, he found that Lin Xiu had already appeared in front of him.

“Leave it to me.”

Lin Xiu, who appeared in front of Sima Qiang, said lightly.

“Courting death!”

Ning Tianluo looked at Lin Xiu who suddenly appeared, and actually blocked his attack with that long spear, and his face suddenly became ugly.

With a roar, he waved his sword, and he was about to continue slashing at Lin Xiu’s body!

Dang dang-

But Lin Xiu reacted quickly at this time, holding the Dark Edge spear, and continued to fight against him.

As the weapons collided with each other, there were loud noises.

Moreover, Lin Xiu’s Destiny Spear Art was extremely powerful. Under the collision of the two weapons, the powerful force made Ning Tianluo keep retreating.

damn…

At this moment, Ning Tianluo’s expression became extremely ugly. He gritted his teeth, and the source strength of his body burst out in an instant.

‘Blast of Turbidity’!!!

He clenched the sword in his hand tightly, and when he stepped back, he directly slashed into the air!

Boom—

At this moment, an extremely terrifying force charged towards Lin Xiu!

The surrounding ground cracked instantly, and the black-red flames formed a wave and swept across it!

Lin Xiu gave a cold snort when he saw this scene. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The Dark Edge spear held in his hand waved directly into the air.

A more terrifying dark blue flame burst out directly, charging towards the skill power released by Ning Tianluo!

boom–

Under the collision of the two energies, a huge sound suddenly erupted.

The skill power that Ning Tianluo released was instantly dissipated!

This is impossible!

Seeing this scene, the expression in Ning Tianluo’s eyes changed greatly.

He never imagined that his skill power would be neutralized so easily.

“Die!”

Ning Tianluo now looked at Lin Xiu and continued to roar.

He held the swords with both hands and slashed across the sky!

Suddenly, powerful black and red flames burst out from his sword and charged towards Lin Xiu.

The temperature of the black-red flame was extremely high, and Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly as the flame hit.

But at this time, Lin Xiu didn’t dodge at all.

Allowing these flames to his his body.

Die!

Looking at this scene, Ning Tianluo couldn’t help roaring in his heart.

But even though the black-red flames covered Lin Xiu’s body, Lin Xiu, who was in the flames, didn’t seem to be hurt in any way!

how can that be!?

Seeing this scene, Ning Tianluo’s eyes widened.

The flames he released were all extremely powerful. Didn’t the surrounding ground melt because of his powerful flames?

Does this kid have a strong resistance to flames?
