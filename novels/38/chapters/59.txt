Chapter 60: One-Star Medal!

“Let me conclude this operation.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Qin Qiang’s gaze swept across the people who were standing upright and said in a low voice.

“This operation lasted a month, and there were seven deaths in Team 1 and only three survived.”

“Six deaths in Team 2 and four survived.”

“Five deaths in Team 3 and five survived.”

“Four deaths in Team 4 and six survived.”

Listening to Qin Qiang’s words, everyone was silent. Their comrades who were next to them previously would never come back again.

Some soldiers couldn’t help but choke with emotions. It was true that men would only weep when they were deeply hurt.

“Instructors team, one death.” Qin Qiang was silent for a moment, then continued.

Hearing this, the people around were stunned. The instructors in the team were warriors of rank 3 and above. Even so, they had one death?

So what kind of monster did they encounter? Everyone gasped when they thought about this.

“Alright, now let’s present the reward this time.” As Qin Qiang spoke, the two instructors around him opened the small black box in their hands at the same time.

There was something inside that emitted light.

“The ‘clean-up’ mission this time was hard and each person will be awarded a one-star medal.” Qin Qiang looked at the two instructors next to him and nodded.

One-star medal?

Lin Xiu was shocked.

Only federal soldiers could receive the medal and it ranged from one star to five stars. The higher the number of stars, the greater the contribution they had put in.

Not to belittle this one-star medal; with this medal, one would have priority on transportation and the police couldn’t simply arrest you.

There was a unique code at the back of each medal, and after being certified on the Warrior Union website, there seemed like there would even be a discount when you purchase items.

Soon, the instructors helped everyone pin the one-star medal on their shoulders.

Everyone did a military salute and disbanded.

“Lin Xiu, come over.” Just as Lin Xiu was about to return to his room, Qin Qiang called him over.

Hearing Qin Qiang’s words, Lin Xiu was taken aback but still went over.

Coming to the front of the hall, Qin Qiang looked outside through the window of the airship.

They had arrived above Xing Yao City at this moment and were getting closer to the airport.

“Are you interested in becoming a federal soldier?” Qin Qiang was silent for a moment, then turned to look at Lin Xiu and asked.

Lin Xiu had simply surprised him too much. When he first came over, he felt that Lin Xiu must have offended someone and was banished to go to this place to carry out the ‘clean-up’ mission.

And at that time, he felt that the strength of Lin Xiu should probably be less than that of a rank 1 warrior. He didn’t expect that Lin Xiu was now almost close to being a rank 2 warrior!

How could it be? It’s almost impossible for even Xing Yao City’s most talented person to improve so quickly!

And what was even more horrifying was that this guy killed Shadow and Lone Wolf, the men wanted by the federal government. Also, they were both rank 3 warriors!

He wouldn’t have believed it if it wasn’t for the fact that the soldiers had sworn that Lin Xiu had dealt with them alone.

Seeing that Lin Xiu was silent, Qin Qiang raised his brows and continued, “With your talent, I am sure that in a few years, you will certainly be able to achieve an unimaginable status, even possibly becoming a major general.”

Qin Qiang looked at Lin Xiu. The status of federal soldiers wasn’t very high. Once you became a major general or other ranks, it wouldn’t be the same.

It was something that many warriors dreamed of.

“I decline.” Lin Xiu did not even think about it and shook his head straight away.

Qin Qiang was stunned and instinctively asked, “Why?”

Any normal person wouldn’t let go of this opportunity.

“Come on, I’m only in my sophomore year and I want to go to college,” Lin Xiu smiled helplessly and said.

When Qin Qiang heard Lin Xiu’s determined tone, he could not help but sigh. However, he looked at Lin Xiu and still continued to speak, “Okay, but if you’re interested after graduation, you can come to me.”

“No problem.”

The airship soon arrived at the other side of the airport and landed.

Xu Wen, Li Yi, and the others were going back to the federal government, while Lin Xiu was heading back to Xing Yao Academy.

After going through life and death together for a month, they had developed a strong relationship. At this moment, Lin Xiu hugged them, smiled, and said, “Goodbye.”

“Goodbye!” Xu Wen nodded, smiled, and replied.

“Remember to come and see us when you’re free,” Li Yi said with slight reluctance.

Lin Xiu nodded, looked at the time, then pressed the button on the body of the android wolf next to him. He went on it, and with the huge wooden box that stored the Silver Immortal Soul spear on its back, he rushed over to the Xing Yao academy.

“By the way, I just realized that he’s going to take his finals today, and he’s still in his sophomore year,” Li Yi said with a bitter smile.

After living together for a month, Li Yi and the rest simply couldn’t see Lin Xiu as a student.

“He’s going to reach a level we can’t reach.” Looking at Lin Xiu’s retreating figure, Xu Wen muttered to himself.

The android wolf was very fast and was comparable to a normal maglev car.

The outer shell of its body had a hollow design and a large number of gears constantly spinning inside could be seen.

“That’s… That’s cool!” Some youths saw Lin Xiu riding this android wolf and they were very envious.

“Isn’t this something that could only be found in the mech era? Is it an imitation?” Some people who could recognize it exclaimed.

But that sort of technique in the past was different from today’s technology so the manufacturing process was different too. Even if there were imitations, they couldn’t be like that android wolf that Lin Xiu had.

In the hall of the Tang Family residence, Tang Mubai sat on a chair and frowned.

“He couldn’t be contacted for a month, Shadow should be dead.”

Undue delay might bring trouble, and in order to avoid that, Tang Mubai had already bought the federal government’s most wanted killer, a warrior nicknamed Shadow, to kill Lin Xiu directly.

But he did not expect that after a month when he tried to contact Shadow to check how things were going, he couldn’t get a hold of him.

It was like he suddenly disappeared.

“Lord… Lord…”

Just then, a middle-aged man ran in, panting.

“What happened?” Tang Mubai frowned, then looked at him and asked.

“That boy called Lin Xiu is not dead! He’s back now!”

What the!?

Tang Mubai’s pupils narrowed when he heard this piece of news.
