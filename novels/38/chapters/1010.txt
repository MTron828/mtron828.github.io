Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Go to… hell!”

At this moment, Sun Jian clenched the black giant sword with both hands.

In the next moment, he roared with both hands and the black giant sword slashed into the air.

Boom—

The moment he swung his giant sword, a black energy charged directly towards Lin Xiu!

“Leave!”

Lin Xiu watched this scene and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

With a stroke of the Dark Edge spear in their hands, Wang Qiang and Duan Zeyan’s bodies flew directly to the other side.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu’s figure also flashed and disappeared in place.

boom boom boom —

At this moment, those black energies directly impacted the ground in front of them, making a loud sound.

The entire ground was destroyed by those black energies.

Here!

Sun Jian looked at Lin Xiu who had disappeared in place, turned around suddenly and found that Lin Xiu had appeared behind him.

Holding the black giant sword in his hand, he volleyed towards Lin Xiu again and attacked!

This time, the black energy emanating from his long sword turned into crescent-shaped sword aura and charged towards Lin Xiu.

bang bang bang-

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu frantically waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand, directly blocking the black sword aura.

And while resisting, with a backhand wave, the dark blue flaming birds were also released directly.

Looking at the flaming birds that were charging towards him, Sun Jian snorted coldly and waved the black giant sword in his hand and suddenly some black energy was released again, directly blocking the dark blue flaming birds.

Those dark blue flaming birds dissipated directly in the next moment.

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help frowning.

His flames were useless against this man?

“Hmph, insignificant skills.”

Looking at another flaming bird that was still charging toward him, Sun Jian sneered and at the same time, he waved the black giant sword in his hand.

Those black energy substances appeared again.

At the same time that the flaming bird disappeared into the black energy substance, it burst out directly and charged toward Lin Xiu instead!

Hm!?

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes showed surprise.

His own skills actually turned around!

Boom—

This flaming bird directly hit Lin Xiu’s body.

But for Lin Xiu, it couldn’t cause any harm at all.

Because Lin Xiu had a strong resistance to flames.

“interesting.”

This person’s skills were too strange.

However, this did not make Lin Xiu feel intimidated, on the contrary, he became a little excited.

Sun Jian looked at Lin Xiu and also did not treat Lin Xiu as an ordinary warrior.

The black giant sword in his hand swung into the air again.

Whoosh whoosh—

As the black giant sword was swung, a large amount of black energy substance was emitted.

He directly attacked Lin Xiu.

Those black energy substances turned into huge black snakes and they charged towards Lin Xiu with their teeth and claws.

On the other side, Duan Zeyan got up from the ground.

Looking at this thing, both eyes were full of surprise.

Those black giant snakes, just looking at them from such a distance, made him freeze on the spot.

“Master… Be careful…” Wang Qiang also stood up slowly at this time and said with difficulty.

He was caught by those people and was beaten up badly, so now it was very difficult to move his body.

“Reverse skill, I can do that too.”

Lin Xiu looked at the black giant snake that was charging towards him with its claws and said indifferently at this moment.

‘Adjudicate’!

With a wave of the Dark Edge spear, a dazzling light suddenly flashed.

Those black giant snakes were directly reversed by this force and charged towards Sun Jian!

When Sun Jian saw this scene, his face changed and the source strength of his body burst out, forming a ‘Sphere’ to protect his body.

Those black giant snakes directly impacted him and exploded in an instant.

The powerful impact made him fly straight out.

‘Flashing Souls’!

Lin Xiu’s body skill was activated and he instantly appeared behind Sun Jian.

With the Dark Edge spear held in both hands, he swung it hard!

Boom—

Sun Jian, who flew out, had not stabilized his body, and was directly blasted to the ground by Lin Xiu’s long spear.

But because he had unfolded the ‘Sphere’, it didn’t cause too much damage to him.

“Ah!!!”

Sun Jian, who quickly stood up from the ground, let out a loud roar.

He looked very sinister.

“The scum from the lower planes, dare to attack me!”

He looked at Lin Xiu who was suspended in the air and shouted loudly.

Although he unfolded the ‘Sphere’ just now, the powerful impact caused his body to be injured.

A smear of blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.

As he roared, a large amount of black matter appeared on his body.

Lin Xiu looked at this scene and the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

what is this?

Those black substances seem to be materialized source strength.

Terrifying energy.

His face also slowly changed.

His chin became sharper and his face also looked a little darker and there was a faint purple light in the eyes.

He didn’t look like an ordinary human being.

“This person… Ancestral star!?

Seeing this scene, Duan Zeyan seemed to know something and said subconsciously. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Not human?

Lin Xiu frowned slightly when he saw this scene.

And it can be clearly felt that after Sun Jian became this state, his power began to increase crazily again.

Sun Jian looked at Lin Xiu in the air and with a wave of his right hand, the Source Stone of Water and the Source Stone of Earth in the smartwatch instantly floated beside him.

“go!”

By triggering a thought, the Source Stone of Earth emitted a yellow-colored light and in the next moment, the entire ground shook crazily.

With this crazy vibration, a lot of cracks appeared on the whole ground.

In the next moment, the surrounding rocks assembled wildly.

Soon, the huge rocks combined into a large number of rock snakes, charging towards Lin Xiu in the air!

Obviously, he created these using the source stone of earth.

And at this moment, the source stone of water beside him also lit up.

Soon, the seawater in the ocean not far away began to surge.

A large amount of seawater flew directly into the air.

At this moment, those sea water turned into water cones and they rushed over!
