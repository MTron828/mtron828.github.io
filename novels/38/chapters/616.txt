Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“What!!!”

The terrifying electric current hit Elephant’s body, and the severe pain caused Elephant to let out a miserable howl.

He only wailed a little, and because of this terrifying electric current, he could no longer make a sound.

And in the next moment, his body stopped struggling and fell directly to the ground.

There was still white smoke coming out of his body.

If you take off the bronze battle suit on his body and take a closer look, you will find that this man’s body has been burnt by this terrifying electric current.

Soon, some staff came forward, checked Elephant’s condition, and dragged him away.

The supporters were stunned when they saw the staff’s gesture.

Elephant... dead?

“The winner of this battle is... the newcomer Ah Yue”

At this time, the host looked at the people around, and then announced loudly.

The audience also came to their senses at this time. There was only one reason for Lin Xiu’s victory, and that was that Elephant was dead!

“Now you have a choice to rest or continue to challenge, or...

“Continue.”

The host hadn’t finished speaking, and in the next moment, Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Did you hear that! He said to continue the challenge!”

The host heard Lin Xiu’s answer at this time, and shouted loudly – he very good at controlling the atmosphere.

The surrounding audience looked like they were boiling at this moment, and the scene was full of shouts.

“Next, Ah Yue’s opponent is our Ripper... Oder”

Code-named Oder was also a burly man. Holding a huge long knife, he jumped directly to the challenge stage.

“Hng, Elephant is simply a useless guy.” Oder looked at Lin Xiu through the mask, full of killing intent.

“Cut this newcomer in half!”

“Kill him!”

At the same time, the surrounding warriors shouted excitedly.

“Three seconds.”

Lin Xiu looked at the man whose code name was Oder, and said lightly.

“Hahaha, you mean you can deal with me in three seconds?”

Oder laughed, as if he had heard the funniest joke in the world.

“I’ll cut you... in half directly!”

Oder roared angrily, then holding the sharp sword in his hand, he charged directly towards Lin Xiu!

Don’t look at how cumbersome his body looks, but when he moves, his speed was very fast.

Lin Xiu didn’t panic at all when he saw that Oder was holding the huge sword, about to cut Lin Xiu in half from top to bottom! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“That kid must be frightened!”

Just when the surrounding audience was expecting Lin Xiu to be cut in half by Oder’s sword, Lin Xiu’s body moved instantly.

Boom–

Originally, Oder, who was going to cut Lin Xiu in half with the sword, felt pain in his hands, and found that the palms of his hands were broken!

Before he could react, he found that the sword in his hand was held by Lin Xiu with one hand.

Swoosh—

With Lin Xiu’s wave, his body was directly cut into two pieces by his own sword.

Blood splattered all over the ground in an instant.

Oder’s body fell on the ground, his eyes under the mask were wide open, as if he didn’t even know how he died.

The excited audience just now became quiet at this moment.

A dead silence.

“Next.”

Lin Xiu threw his sword on the ground, then raised his eyes and said softly to the host.

The host was also dumbfounded. He had no idea that this would happen.

He was simply... killed in seconds!

But then, one after another warrior fought against Lin Xiu, but Lin Xiu won every time and each time, it was an instant kill.

Lin Xiu didn’t give these people any chance.

“Ayue, 15 consecutive victories!”

At this time, as the host announced this victory, the audience got excited.

“Ah Yue! Ah Yue!”

Lin Xiu was a rookie, and he achieved such a strong record, which made the audience excited.

That kobold looked at Lin Xiu from the sidelines, and then left.

He could see from Lin Xiu’s battle just now that Lin Xiu was very strong, and he didn’t seem to have any chance of winning.

In the beginning, there were still people who challenged Lin Xiu, but after Lin Xiu won fifteen games in a row, no one dared to challenge Lin Xiu again.

After all, Lin Xiu’s methods were too simple and too brutal. Anyone who fought against him would die within five seconds.

What level of strength does he have to be able to achieve such victories?

And some people also noticed Lin Xiu never used a weapon, just melee combat.

That meant that Lin Xiu didn’t go all out.

“Mr. Lin, 100 million union coins have been credited into your card.”

After Lin Xiu returned to the lounge to remove the bronze battle suit and mask, the staff who helped Lin Xiu with the boarding information said respectfully.

After seeing Lin Xiu’s battle just now, he was frightened to death. Lin Xiu was really too powerful, and all of them were instant kills.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded, then said lightly, “Then I’m leaving.”

“Next time you come, you can come here directly through the VIP channel dedicated to the contestants, and you don’t need to buy tickets.”

The staff member became very enthusiastic at this time.

Lin Xiu walked to the door, then turned to look behind him, and said to him, “Just now, did you deliberately arrange for me to go up first?”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the staff member’s face suddenly changed, and his eyes were full of panic.

However, in the next moment, Lin Xiu didn’t say much and left.

This made the staff heaved a sigh of relief. It seemed that Lin Xiu didn’t intend to make a big deal out of this.

After leaving the sky arena, Lin Xiu left the place.

Sky City, Black Fish Mouth.

Black Fish Mouth was the name of the largest black market trading center in Sky City.

Things could be traded here, in addition to skill cards, battle suits, and weapons that warriors need, there were various products that cannot be bought on the market, and even some odd crystals from another dimension.

What was more special about Black Fish Mouth was that here, as long as you have money, you could buy a lot of information.

Lin Xiu was holding his Dark Edge spear at this time. Before coming over, he changed into a suit, and he also wore a black mask, covering most of his face.

The Dark Edge spear was also wrapped in white cloth and carried behind him.

The surrounding was in sharp contrast to the prosperity in Sky City, and the environment looked more retro.

And the dim lights made the surrounding scene even eerier.

“Sir, what do you want? These are flints just collected from the Fire Cloud Star, and they are the first choice for forging weapons....”
