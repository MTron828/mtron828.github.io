1165 Too Weak

The God warrior-level warrior of the Divine Domain roared at this time.

As soon as he finished speaking, in the next moment, all the warriors of the Divine Domain attacked Lin Xiu.

“Too weak.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

!!

With his current strength, to deal with a warrior of this level is as simple as stepping on an ant to death.

Without even using the Dark Edge spear, he directly held the long sword in his hand and attacked the warriors who were attacking him!

Dangdang-

The long sword drew an arc and in the next moment, all the weapons of the warriors who were attacking were sent flying.

Although he used a sword, Lin Xiu didn’t look rusty at all.

As the source strength was transmitted to the long sword, the entire long sword became extremely sharp.

swoosh—

Before they had time to react, the long sword in Lin Xiu’s hand slashed directly!

boom–

Blood red appeared on the necks of these warriors.

In the next moment, a large amount of blood sputtered out.

These warriors of the Divine Domain were killed by Lin Xiu in this short period of time!

The only remaining warrior was a God warrior-level warrior at the back.

“you…”

At this moment, the warrior’s eyes widened when he saw this scene.

His eyes were full of disbelief.

Although the people who just surrounded Lin Xiu were all warriors of the Sage warrior level, but even so, it was impossible to kill them directly.

“People from Divine Domain are really arrogant.”

Lin Xiu held the long sword in his hand and slowly walked over to him and said lightly.

“you dare!”

When the man saw Lin Xiu’s movements, his body trembled.

Lin Xiu knew that they were warriors from the Divine Domain and even dared to kill the warriors from their Divine Domain.

Obviously, he must be the warrior who destroyed the Divine Domain from Namir Planet.

“Goodbye.”

At the same time as Lin Xiu said lightly, the ‘Flashing Souls’ body skill was used and he instantly appeared in front of the man.

The long sword in his hand slashed directly at this man!

Dang–

After all, this man is also a warrior at the God warrior level. At this time, he reacted quickly with the sword in his hand, resisting Lin Xiu’s attack.

But Lin Xiu’s blow was too strong and powerful.

It made the hand of the warrior holding the sword feel numb.

Dangdang-

And Lin Xiu didn’t stop what he was doing, holding the long sword in his hand, he kept attacking!

With that thunderstorm-like attack, the man had no way to fight back and could only keep resisting.

The surrounding warriors in the City Lord’s Mansion also began to pay attention to this side.

“The Divine Domain warrior… Who is that chap?”

At this time, many warriors were secretly surprised when they saw this scene from a distance.

These Divine Domain warriors were all wearing uniform battle uniforms, which was easy to recognize.

There were quite a few corpses of warriors from the Divine Domain lying on the ground and it was obvious that Lin Xiu killed them.

boom–

At this time, Lin Xiu took advantage of the fact that the warrior who was constantly resisting his attacks was not paying attention and the long sword in his hand slashed directly at his body!

His body was cut in half directly by Lin Xiu.

“Um?”

But Lin Xiu clearly felt something wrong at this time.

The body of the warrior who was cut in half by himself did not spatter any blood.

Instead, it turned into a cloud of smoke and slowly disappeared.

At this time, Lin Xiu was a little surprised. He didn’t expect that this warrior would not have a warrior similar to his ‘Mirror Image’.

However, running away was not that easy.

As soon as Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered, it was obvious that the warrior had escaped to the other side.

Soon, a black source mark appeared on Lin Xiu’s forehead.

With the appearance of this source mark, a large number of matrices appeared in the surrounding space.

Soon, in this garden, an oval space was formed.

boom–

Just as the warrior was about to escape, his body slammed into the matrix, making a dull sound.

what is this!?

When the warrior saw the matrix in front of him, the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

The sword in his hand was about to break the wall formed by this matrix.

But when his sword slashed on the wall formed by the matrix, there was a strange sound.

There was absolutely no way to break through the matrix!

how can that be!

His face, at this time, has become extremely nasty.

At this moment, he heard Lin Xiu’s footsteps coming from behind and suddenly turned around to look behind him. At the same time, a golden source mark flashed out on his forehead. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Boom—

With the appearance of the golden source mark, a terrifying golden energy ray burst out from his head and charged towards Lin Xiu!

In the surrounding air, because of the impact of this golden energy ray, a huge sound rang out.

The warriors who watched this scene not far away could not help but burst into an uproar.

This energy ray is indeed extremely terrifying.

For ordinary warriors, unfolding the ‘Sphere’ would probably be useless!

But at this moment, as Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ unfolded, these golden energy rays were completely blocked by Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’!

And at this time, Lin Xiu walked forward while resisting the impact of his golden energy rays.

bang bang bang-

With the impact of the golden energy rays, there was a loud noise, but Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ was still very stable and the rays did not cause any damage to Lin Xiu at all!

This is impossible!

This warrior was already a little crazy.

This was his most powerful source mark power, but it was completely blocked by the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded.

“Next, it’s my turn.”

swoosh—

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, he waved the long sword in his hand and let it go.

Because there was a lot of source strength in the body of the long sword, as the long sword flew out of Lin Xiu’s hand, there was a sound of breaking through the air.

Its speed was also extremely fast.

Looking at the flying long sword, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

The golden energy rays that burst out from his forehead also stopped abruptly.

Directly used his body strength to unfold his ‘Sphere’.

In the next second, the long sword stabbed directly into his ‘Sphere’ and a loud sound suddenly erupted.

Because of the powerful impact brought by the attack of the long sword, his body slammed into the matrix behind him.

This long sword also broke his Sphere, but it got stuck in his ‘Sphere’, just a little bit more and it would have penetrated his heart.

Looking at this scene, he turned cold and pale.
