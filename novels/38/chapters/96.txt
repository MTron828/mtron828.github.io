Chapter 97: The Temple of Transformation

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s right foot suddenly kicked the handle of the spear, and the spear flew over.

Lin Xiu held it with both hands and charged directly at those two men!

There was a murderous intent in their eyes and they probably weren’t only targeting the android wolf. Most importantly, they wanted Lin Xiu’s life.

The tall, thin man saw this, and his pupils constricted. Then, he charged over to Lin Xiu’s side as well.

Although he looked tall and thin, he was very fast!

Lin Xiu thrust the spear over and he dodged it instantly. Then, he rolled over and charged toward Lin Xiu in the next moment, his short knife was going toward Lin Xiu’s neck!

Lin Xiu’s eyes were cold. In a split second, he bent backward 90 degrees and directly dodged this attack.

And at this moment, that midget rushed over too from the other side!

His body was short, but he was even faster!

This kind of midget was naturally suited to be a killer, not only was he fast, but he also looked harmless.

The green veins on his fingers began to protrude, and his nails became sharp and long.

As Lin Xiu bent his body, he stabbed the spear into the ground and used force to spring into the air!

Dang——

At this moment, the midget’s sharp fingernails directly attacked Lin Xiu’s spear, letting out the sound of metals colliding.

“‘Million Divine Stabs!'” The tall, thin man saw Lin Xiu in the air and directly threw the dagger in his hand!

As soon as the dagger was released, it became a million daggers, directly stabbing toward Lin Xiu’s body!

Lin Xiu enabled the Analytic Eye just now and saw that these two people were rank 2 warriors. If Lin Xiu wasn’t bearing any weights, he could have dealt with them quickly, but right now in this state, his strength was severely suppressed.

But with the training from these few days, he should still be able to deal with them.

Lin Xiu descended and looked at the multitude of daggers before him. Then, he brandished the spear frantically and blocked those daggers coming toward him.

Bang——

Just then, the midget directly charged behind Lin Xiu and hung onto Lin Xiu’s back like a baby, his sharp nails were already on Lin Xiu’s neck.

“Hehehe…”

“You’re just a rank 1 warrior, but you’re doing pretty well. Too bad you’re going to die.” The midget made a strange sound, then with his sharp nails, he was about to scratch Lin Xiu’s neck!

Pow——

But when his nails were about to pierce Lin Xiu’s neck, there was a sound of his nails breaking!

How could it be!?

The midget’s eyes widened and he was in complete disbelief.

He was specially trained and could even cut open the body of a rank 2 evolved beast with the sharpness of his nails!

How could this rank 1 warrior’s skin not be pierced?

“I’m getting a little mad.” At this moment, Lin Xiu’s voice became cold.

Then, the long spear in his hand suddenly shook and he released it directly as it flew toward that tall, thin man!

At the same time, the spear had flames on its body and turned into a phoenix, charging to the tall, thin man’s body!

‘Awe of the Phoenix’!

‘What kind of skill is this!?’

The tall, thin man saw this scene and was stunned. Just as he wanted to dodge it, he realized that these phoenixes seemed to be able to track him and were targeting him!

“I’m not going to let go, hehehe…” The midget then clung onto Lin Xiu’s back, his broken nails grew back again in the next instant.

“Let me help you, then.” Lin Xiu moved his hands to his back and directly grabbed the midget’s arms!

‘Tiger Strength Fist’!

Bang——

With a dull sound, the midget’s hands were broken directly.

How could it be!

The midget froze as if he had forgotten the pain of his broken arms and was still in shock.

The information they received was that Lin Xiu was a rank 1 warrior, and they had also sensed that Lin Xiu’s aura wasn’t strong, but how could he be so strong!?

“Goodbye!” Lin Xiu choked his neck, lifted his body from behind, and without showing any mercy, Lin Xiu directly used the ‘Rupturing Fist’ against his head.

Bang——

His eyes were wide open, and there weren’t any injuries on his face, but because of the impact of the ‘Rupturing Fist’, his head was jolted into a complete mess.

“Ding~~~”

“Congratulations to the master on killing the second-order warrior and gaining 150,000 experience!” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Who the hell are you… exactly?” And at this moment, the tall, thin man in the corner looked perplexed. His whole body had just been burned by the ‘Awe of the phoenix’, and there was a charred smell coming from the body, his skin looked completely burnt.

“Didn’t you check on me?” Lin Xiu sneered, then pulled out the spear that was on the wall, and walked toward the man.

Looking at his dead companion, then seeing Lin Xiu’s murderous gaze, the tall, thin man began trembling.

Although he had killed many people, it was the first time that he had been forced to this extent.

He didn’t want to die!

“Don’t come over, you’ll regret killing me.” Although he felt as if his lips had been burned and he was in a lot of pain, he continued to speak.

“Why would I regret it?” Lin Xiu asked coldly, then raised the long spear in his hand.

The tall, thin man was initially not afraid of this seemingly ordinary weapon. But now that he couldn’t move at all and was facing the fear of death, he roared, “I am from the Temple of Transformation, if you kill me, you will be hunted down! Your loved ones and your friends will all be killed…”

‘Temple of Transformation? What nonsense is that?’

He roared and found that Lin Xiu wasn’t moving anymore, he thought that Lin Xiu was afraid and began to laugh viciously. “You’d better let me go and bring me to the nearest medical station. If I am in a good mood, I can consider not killing you…”

“Stupid!” Lin Xiu said faintly, then without hesitation, he lifted the long spear and pierced it directly through his chest.
