Chapter 376: Back to School

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“You’ll know when the time comes.” The corners of Luo Yue’s lips seemed to curl up as she looked at Lin Xiu and said.

Being stared at by Luo Yue this way, Lin Xiu felt a chill on his back.

What is the punishment of the Sacred Region Academy?

Following that, nothing else happened. Soon, the spacecraft slowly began to descend.

“We’re here.” Lin Xiu felt that the spacecraft seemed to be descending and said.

After so many days of torment, they finally returned to the Sacred Region Academy again. With this thought, Lin Xiu got a little excited.

“We’ve arrived, everyone, please remember to take your belongings!”

A crew member on the spacecraft said to everyone on the spacecraft.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue.

Luo Yue nodded and walked together with Lin Xiu.

As soon as he got off the spacecraft, Lin Xiu felt a cool wind blowing over.

There was an endless sea at the entrance of the Sacred Region Academy and that was where Lin Xiu got off at.

“We’re finally back.” Lin Xiu stretched out at this moment and said aloud.

At the same time, in a room that looked a little dark, Ouyang Hang was holding the phone in his hand at this time, looking at the message and his face became gloomy.

“This kid actually came back alive…”

When he recalled losing his Diamond Skill Card to Lin Xiu, he became extremely annoyed.

This skill card was handed down from the family. If he wasn’t confident in winning that time, he wouldn’t have a wager with Lin Xiu with such a thing.

In the end, he lost!

With this thought, his face became sinister.

“I will let you know that some things... are not so easy to get!”

Just as he was talking to himself, on a weird mechanical bed in front of him, a bunch of people in white coats was constantly doing something to a man on the bed like it was an operation.

Di di di——

Soon, the instruments around the mechanical bed began to make a strange noise.

“All done?”

Hearing those noises, Ouyang Hang stepped forward at this time and looked at the bed.

“Done.”

Those people in white coats said respectfully to Ouyang Hang.

Ouyang Hang looked over the bed and saw the man lying there.

Yu Yi!

At this time, a man was still doing the final stitching of his arm. Taking a closer look, there was no flesh and blood in his arm. Instead, everything was mechanical.

“How do you feel?” Ouyang Hang looked at Yu Yi who had opened his eyes but was still motionless.

Yu Yi stared at the ceiling and in the next moment, the pupils that had not moved before, looked towards Ouyang Hang, “You transformed me into a cyborg?”

His voice now was a bit hoarse and weird, like an electronic synthesis.

“Yeah.” Ouyang Hang nodded and said to him, “With your injury, unless you have a prosthesis, you wouldn’t live.”

A prosthetic limb cannot be compared with the real limb and it is also very detrimental to the future cultivation of the warrior.

After all, prosthetics couldn’t grow.

But if you transform him into a cyborg now, although his body cannot be strengthened through ‘Cultivation Techniques’, the natural limbs and body of the cyborg are already very strong, and there was no pain!

As the person stitched up the opening in his arm, his arm appeared like an ordinary human and it wasn’t weird at all.

Click, click, click——

Yu Yi moved his body, then slowly stood up.

“How long have I been in a coma?” Yu Yi looked at Ouyang Hang and said faintly.

“It’s only about a week.” Ouyang Hang replied.

“The kid surnamed Lin has gone out to do some tasks after his battle with you and he just came back today.”

As soon as Ouyang Hang spoke, the look in Yu Yi’s eyes suddenly changed.

Thinking of Lin Xiu’s face, his eyes were full of coldness.

“What do you want me to do?” Yu Yi looked at Ouyang Hang and asked.

He was not a fool. Transforming into a cyborg was not a simple matter. It requires a lot of financial and material resources.

Ouyang Hang wouldn’t have helped him for no reason, he knew that. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Don’t you want to kill him?” Ouyang Hang said to Yu Yi at this time and made a gesture of slitting his neck.

“Of course I do, but…” Yu Yi’s face was filled with murderous intent and nodded, but thinking about the scenes of fighting with Lin Xiu before, he really didn’t have much confidence to be able to kill Lin Xiu, because Lin Xiu’s skills were too weird for him.

“Your current strength should be able to compete with a rank 7 warrior. That kid is merely a rank 5 warrior, it is impossible to kill him.” Ouyang Hang waved his hand and said.

Hearing his words, Ouyang Hang was stunned, then clenched his fists and stretched out his hand, then opened them again. He felt that the power in his hands seemed to be much stronger than before.

“The materials used are all the latest materials, collected from other galaxies. Now that your body is strong, even if you stand in front of the kid and let him stab you with a spear, he might not even hurt you.” Ouyang Hang sneered and continued.

Click, click, click——

Hearing Ouyang Hang’s words, Yu Yi clenched his hand into a fist and his joints made clicking sounds.

At the same time, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue have returned to the school villa.

They were away for some time and it looked a bit dusty inside.

Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge Spear and the violent wind blew all the dust away.

“I’m going to look for the teacher first.”

After Lin Xiu put the backpack away, he seemed to recall something and said to Luo Yue.

Now that the task is complete, he had to report to Nan Zhengjun.

“En.” Luo Yue nodded, then looked at Lin Xiu and continued, “Your spear and that thing, give them to me.”

Thing?

Lin Xiu was startled, then he remembered the alien ore and took it out of his pocket.

This thing was still emitting a faint white light.
