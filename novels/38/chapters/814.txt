Chapter 815: An Instant Kill!

“Tsk tsk, which planet is this ant from?”

Jiang Mo looked at Lin Xiu, did not move and said coldly.

“I’ll give you a chance to get off yourself.”

He looked at Lin Xiu’s dark pupils and said lightly.

His words were full of pride.

It was as if that he could crush Lin Xiu to death with just a wave of his fingers.

“Get lost!”

“Get lost!”

Jiang Mo’s voice was very loud and at this time, many of the audience around him chimed in as well.

“Get lost.”

/

Lin Xiu looked at him, then said lightly.

Jiang Mo, who had raised his head arrogantly at first, was startled when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

He looked at Lin Xiu in disbelief.

This ant actually told me to get out of here!?

“Courting death!!!”

Jiang Mo roared and at this moment, holding the sword in his hand, he charged directly towards Lin Xiu!

He wanted to kill Lin Xiu directly without giving him any chance to admit defeat!

‘Heaven and Earth Slash’!

The sword slashed out, turning into a very huge phantom of the sword.

This blow was so powerful that if you got hit, you would die immediately!

Die!!!

Jiang Mo fiercely used one of his most powerful skills to cut Lin Xiu’s body in half.

boom–

But at this moment, the Dark Edge spear that Lin Xiu was holding struck directly.

Boom—

With a loud noise, the phantom of the huge sword was slashed and dissipated.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu appeared in front of Jiang Mo like he teleported.

The spear in his hand pierced and at this moment, it seemed as if hundreds of spear shadows were stabbed out.

Jiang Mo’s face changed greatly and he was about to unfold his ‘Sphere’ to resist.

But at this moment, the spear that was stabbed out instantly pierced his ‘Sphere’, directly piercing his body.

Blood splashed all over the ground.

Jiang Mo was killed in seconds!

There was an uproar in the audience.

This man with black pupils actually possesses such powerful power. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Jiang...Jiang Mo was killed in seconds?”

Some contestants who knew Jiang Mo had shock in their eyes at this time.

Jiang Mo was a warrior at the master warrior-level. How could it be possible that he was killed without even remembering to release the Source mark power!?

“This is too perverted...”

At this moment, Qian Jin couldn’t help swallowing secretly.

More than a month ago, Lin Xiu and Wu Changkong were evenly matched in the battle, but now Lin Xiu actually killed a master warrior with one move.

This is simply too terrifying.

“No. 18 Lin Xiu, win!”

At this time, the referee has already announced the result.

“How did your strength increase so much...”

Seeing Lin Xiu walking down the stage, Qian Jin couldn’t help but smile bitterly.

Before, Qian Jin had always wanted to fight him, but what he didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu’s strength has improved to this level now.

Now, he didn’t have any intention of fighting Lin Xiu anymore.

With that kind of terrifying strength, how can people raise their fighting spirit?

“Pariah, you dare to kill Jiang Mo!”

As Lin Xiu returned to the competition area, a man stood up, stared at Lin Xiu, pointed the weapon in his hand at him and said grimly.

Lin Xiu didn’t even bother to look at him.

“Hmph, these guys.”

At this time, Qian Jin also glanced at the rampant man with a bad expression.

“Pariah, if you meet me, you will die!”

At this time, the man continued to speak.

“Too weak.”

Lin Xiu finally glanced at him, but shook his head and said.

“You...”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the man opened his eyes wide and was very angry.

But here, it was impossible for him to make a move, leaving him helpless.

“This time, you will definitely be able to enter the top nine.”

Qian Jin still had confidence in Lin Xiu.

Entering the top nine means entering the top 36.

Lin Xiu shook his head.

Qian Jin was stunned for a moment, then continued to say, “Those guys are not strong, you can definitely do it.”

“I mean, not only will I be in the top nine, but I’ll be number one.”

Lin Xiu said indifferently, with a look of incomparable confidence in his tone.

Qian Jin’s eyes widened.

This is also too... crazy.

However, what Lin Xiu said seems to be true.

“The next game, Qian Jin from Tianlong City, will play against Qian Lin!”

Soon, it was Qian Jin’s turn to play.

“It’s that guy?”

When Qian Jin saw the person he was going to fight, he couldn’t help but frown slightly.

His opponent was the man who insulted Lin Xiu just now.

“You are dead.”

The man stood up, looked at Qian Jin and said coldly.

“Be careful.”

Lin Xiu also said aloud at this time when he saw the gaze cast by the man.

“En.”

Qian Jin nodded.

“I’ll give you a good time.”

After Qian Lin watched Qian Jin stand on the competition stage, he suddenly said with a grim expression.

Qian Jin ignored his words, holding a long sword in his hand, all the energy in his body was mobilized.

As the referee announced the start, Qian Jin attacked him directly.

Dangdang-

The weapons of the two collided and loud sounds were heard in an instant.

Lin Xiu on the other side, enabled the Analytic Eye to check and found that Qian Lin’s strength was stronger than that of ordinary master warrior-level warriors.

Although he has not reached the peak, he was still very strong.

No wonder he dared to insult him like this just after he killed Jiang Mo.

“Humph! You are too weak!”

Originally, the two seemed to be evenly matched, but in the next moment, the sword in Qian Lin’s hand released a terrifying skill and Qian Jin was knocked away!

Qian Jin’s eyes widened, he didn’t expect that Qian Lin would suddenly burst out with such a strong power.

“Admit defeat.”

Lin Xiu, who was standing below, spoke to Qian Jin at this time.

On this competition stage, as long as he admits defeat, the opponent cannot continue to attack him.

Otherwise, Qian Lin would definitely kill Qian Jin.

At this time, Qian Jin also clearly felt that something was wrong. There was indeed a little gap between himself and Qian Lin’s strength.

But before he could speak, Qian Lin had already rushed in front of him.

The sword slashed at once!

Boom—

Although Qian Jin unfolded the ‘Sphere’, the terrifying slash caused his ‘Sphere’ to vibrate violently.

Moreover, Qian Lin’s movements did not stagnate at all and he kept waving his sword to attack.

bang bang bang-

A loud noise rang out. Even with the protection of ‘Sphere’, Qian Jin still felt very uncomfortable.

In the next moment, a mouthful of blood was spat out.

Because of the internal injury, the unfolded ‘Sphere’ also became extremely unstable.

“Go to hell!!!”

Qian Lin roared angrily, seeing that the ‘Sphere’ on Qian Jin’s body could no longer be maintained, he immediately slashed down!
