Chapter 366: Team

Lin Xiu saw it from a distance. In order to prevent the ice lotus fire from spreading throughout his body, he even cut off his arms directly.

This was not something ordinary people could do.

“He ran away.” Luo Yue looked at the opened door and said faintly.

“What should we do now?” Lin Xiu nodded, looked at Luo Yue, and asked.

There must be more than one person who came down from the top of the building. That man should have many accomplices with him.

With this thought, Lin Xiu became cautious.

“Go out and have a look.: Luo Yue pondered for a while and said.

Lin Xiu also nodded then the two continued to walk towards the door with their weapons.

went to the passage outside the door and suddenly dazzling light shone on.

And Lin Xiu could clearly see the blood on the ground at this time.

There is no doubt that these traces of blood are left by the man who just cut off his arm.

Lin Xiu looked at the bloodstains on the ground and continued to walk to the front.

The safe passage in front became dark and the light beside it seemed to have just been destroyed by someone.

Lin Xiu glanced at Luo Yue at this time, Luo Yue nodded then the two of them continued to walk carefully to the front.

Bang bang bang——

Just when the two of them passed the opposite side, they heard the sound of a fight as if coming from the lower side.

The entire building seemed to shake slightly at this time.

What happened!?

Feeling all this, Lin Xiu frowned.

carefully pushed open the door of the safe passage, looking at the passage below, Lin Xiu’s brows frowned slightly.

Go down? Lin Xiu thought about it and said aloud.

Go down. Luo Yue nodded.

As I walked down there, the fighting sound seemed to be getting stronger and stronger and the vibration around me seemed to vibrate more loudly.

Boom boom——

A violent sound continued to sound and there was a deafening feeling.

What is going on!?

Lin Xiu frowned, wondering if there were other warriors below fighting with those who just came down from the rooftop? Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Must be up to no good sneaking in here.”

At the same time, in the spacious hall downstairs, an old man was looking at the men in black in front of him with a smile.

“This old man doesn’t look like a simple man.” A tall and muscular man among the black-clothed men looked at the old man and was very cautious.

Boom–

At this moment, a dull sound came from the side.

Take a closer look, the man who just cut off his arm has already walked over.

“Captain.” The man looked a little nasty and said aloud when he looked at the tall and muscular man.

“How did this happen?” He saw that the man’s left arm had been cut off and there was still blood dripping down.

“I met two difficult chaps.” At this time, the man thought of Luo Yue and Lin Xiu and there was a hint of hatred in his eyes.

He thought he could kill two warriors to relieve his boredom, but what he didn’t expect was that he himself was almost killed.

As he spoke, he took a tube of potion handed over by one of the men then poured it directly onto his broken arm.

As the potion was poured onto the wound, a lot of white smoke emerged.

The intense pain caused the man to frown.

But in the next moment, his wound healed and the blood stopped dripping from the broken arm.

“No. 4 is dead?” At this moment, he looked to the ground and saw the body of a man in black.

Seeing this, the look on his face changed.

This was one of their members and he was quite strong, so he didn’t expect that he would die.

“It was the old man who did it.” The man who was known as the captain looked at the old man with a cautious look.

“Him?” The man was taken aback for a moment then looked to the front and saw the old man in a vest and he appeared ordinary.

“If I’m not wrong, you guys were the ones who stole something in the Deep Blue City, right?” The old man touched his beard at this time, then looked at them and said with interest.

“None of your business.” A man in black looked at the old man then said with a cold snort.

The old man ignored him and continued looking at them. Then, he saw a large box in their hands and his eyes narrowed.

“There seems to be something extraordinary in it.”

As the old man spoke, their expressions changed.

“Old man? Why are you here?”

At this moment, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue walked down and saw the old man standing there.

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and asked.

“Oh? You guys came down too?” The old man saw Lin Xiu and Luo Yue coming down from the safe passage over there and said with a smile.

“You two…” The man with the broken arm saw Luo Yue and Lin Xiu and his eyes were filled with murderous intent.

“Don’t tell me those two low-level warriors caused this?” A man in black said coldly to the man with a broken arm.

“Shut up! I was just careless!” Hearing his words, the man seemed to be a little embarrassed and roared angrily.

“Kill this old man first, you should take care of those two yourself.” The captain snorted coldly.

As soon as he said that, the men in black worked together and rushed directly to the old man!

They moved very swiftly like shadows.

Lin Xiu was shocked when he saw this scene.

This speed… is too fast, eh?

The strength of these warriors was definitely already rank 7 and there may even be rank 8 warriors among them.

Before Lin Xiu had time to think, the man who had just severed his arm rushed to Lin Xiu’s side!

“Boy, this time, I will kill you!!!”

The man with the severed arm had an extremely hideous expression at this moment. His eyes were full of murderous intent as he held a dagger that emitted a pale blue cold light in his right hand and was aiming for Lin Xiu’s head!
