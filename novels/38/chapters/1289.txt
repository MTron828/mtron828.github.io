1290 Dominating!

The warrior’s eyes were wide open and his mind was about to explode.

Pfft – –

Then, at the next moment, he spat out a mouthful of blood.

The rest of the warriors were in shock when they saw what happened.

“If there’s anyone who continues to do these tricks, I will no longer be nice.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he looked around.

“Would anyone like to try it?”

Lin Xiu ignored the man and looked at the warriors around him.

“Which city are you from?”

One of the warriors asked Lin Xiu with a dull expression on his face.

From their point of view, Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling were being too arrogant. They have completely ignored the existence of all the warriors around them.

Now, they wanted to teach Lin Xiu a lesson.

“Who are you? Why should I tell you that?”

When Lin Xiu heard what the warrior asked, he sneered.

“You…..!!!”

The warrior got abruptly criticised. His eyes were wide open and they were filled with murderous intentions.

“Since all of you are looking for trouble, all of you do it together then.”

Lin Xiu looked around at the warriors before warning them calmly.

With the help of his analytical eye, these warriors were simply weak.

They were even weaker than Liu Mo from Changqing City.

It does look like these warriors would be at the bottom of the list in the multi-city contest.

“You’re too over yourself!!!”

The warrior could no longer stand it anymore.

His body shifted with a horrifying speed and he went straight for Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu laughed coldly. Then, he started moving the spear in his arms.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

As he moved his spear, there were dark blue flaming birds that rushed out of the spear.

The warrior who headed for Lin Xiu immediately saw the flaming birds that were coming at him.

His pupil shrunk and wanted to dodge them subconsciously.

However, it seems that these flaming birds had tracking skills and were following him everywhere. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The rest of the warriors took a few steps back subconsciously when they saw what was happening.

They could clearly feel the horrifying power of the flames.

The air around them was scorching hot and the air was twisted due to the heat.

The training room that was cooling before suddenly turned as hot as an oven.

It was getting so hot that all of them were sweating non stop.

“One hundred million each!”

Baili Haoling licked her lips with excitement.

As she looked at the warrior gods around, it was as if she had found treasure.

“All of these are mine!”

Lin Xiu glared at her before saying.

“Well, let’s see who defeats them first!”

Baili Haoling completely ignored what Lin Xiu had said. She quickly pulled out her daggers and started attacking the warriors around him!

As for the man who was being chased by the flaming birds, the look on his face was hideous.

These flaming birds were annoying as hell as they kept running after him.

Then, he was forced into a corner.

‘Sphere’!!!

He had no other choice but to release his ‘sphere’.

This was because he could clearly feel that these flaming birds were incredibly powerful.

If he didn’t release his ‘sphere’ and he got hit by it, his body would definitely melt instantly.

Boom boom boom – –

As the dark blue flaming birds hit his ‘sphere’, there were loud explosions that followed.

His ‘sphere’ looked twisted instantly.

“Nooooo!!!!”

He roared with rage. The source energy in his body exploded in order to strengthen his ‘sphere’.

...

However, Lin Xiu’s figure suddenly appeared before his eyes.

Lin Xiu held onto his Hao Yue Spear and it landed directly on his ‘sphere’.

Boom – –

With the loud sounds, there was a massive explosion that followed.

His ‘sphere’ instantly exploded.

The man spat out a mouthful of blood and just as he was about to move, he saw that the tip of the spear was already placed on his neck.

“A hundred million.”

Lin Xiu looked at him and threatened him softly.

“In your dreams!!!!”

He roared in rage but before he could say anything more, he realised that both his arms had been chopped off.

At that moment, he noticed that Lin Xiu had his sphere raised above his head, ready to chop off both his legs as well.

...

“I’ll pay…..!!!”

He begged with mercy.

He had no other choice.

If he didn’t, both his legs would be chopped off.

From what Lin Xiu had shown so far, Lin Xiu would definitely ruin him entirely after chopping off his limbs.

“Now…..time for the rest of you.”

Lin Xiu turned around and looked at the others.

Baili Haoling was too invested into killing them that she was already busy fighting the other warriors.

The rest of them no longer cared about their ego and started attacking Baili Haoling together.

Although Baili Haoling’s abilities have improved and she had the help of her divine spirit, she was still injured after being attacked by several warriors together.

Her body was already covered in blood.

However, Baili Haoling did not care about it and continued attacking them with her daggers.

“All of these are mine! Lin Xiu! Go for the others!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was walking toward her, Baili Haoling told him to leave.

She sounded as if she was scared that Lin Xiu would take away what was hers.

Lin Xiu felt helpless as well when he heard what Baili Haoling said.

However, Lin Xiu stood back and did not help. The injuries seen on Baili Haoling were just superficial and she was not badly injured.

She would even be able to practise her skills on these warriors.

At the same time, most of the warriors gathered around Lin Xiu!

There were about a dozen of them and they seemed to be familiar with each other. All of them attacked Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling at the same time, wanting to teach them a lesson.

But…..they soon realised that Baili Haoling was a ferocious beast and she did not care about defending herself. Instead, she kept attacking them.

It had caused them great damage.

As for Lin Xiu, he was worse.

With the movement of the sphere, all of the warriors lost their weapons.

The spear was too heavy and with the energy that Lin Xiu had instilled into it, the spear was nothing but powerful.

Boom boom boom – –

Soon, all of the warriors around Lin Xiu were thrown into the distance.

Pfft – –

Most had blood trickling from the edge of their mouth while they were on the ground.
