Chapter 133: Activate The Teleportation

A teleportation stage? Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Hearing his voice, Lin Xiu looked over to the middle and could clearly see a large circular area in the middle.

He didn’t notice it just now, but now he realized how strange this place was.

“Do you know how to use it?” Lin Xiu looked at the console and asked.

The console looked very unusual.

He didn’t know how to operate it at all.

“I’ll take a look.” Qin Li nodded, then carefully scanned the console and pressed several buttons. Suddenly, there was a soft rumbling and the console screen lit up.

“That’s it!” Qin Li got excited and tapped speedily on the keyboard.

Soon, Lin Xiu saw some coordinates on that screen.

“This teleportation stage can teleport us all up to the ground level but I think the Odd Crystal could only be used once. Quick, everyone, stand on the teleportation circle!” Qin Li said excitedly at this time.

Everybody nodded, then stood directly in the middle of a huge circle.

Qin Li continued tapping on the console and soon, a light blue light shone from above.

He endured the pain caused by the injury and gritted his teeth. In the next moment, he quickly stood in the circle!

Those blue lights instantly covered the bodies of Lin Xiu and the others, and in the next moment, the figures disappeared in this control room.

Lin Xiu suddenly felt the surroundings become extremely bright, the dazzling sunlight made him squint his eyes.

“We’re out!?”

Zhang Yin exclaimed excitedly. It was simply a nightmare below and fortunately, they were out now.

Lin Xiu looked around and they were still in this desert, he couldn’t see an end at all.

At this moment, Lin Xiu was a little tired and the rest of the people simply sat on the ground.

“We’re finally out.” Jiang Li panted.

“Senior, where are you going later?” Just then, Zhang Yin hesitated for a moment before asking.

“Keep walking,” Lin Xiu said plainly.

Keep walking?

Was he heading to that place too?

“Alright, it’s goodbye here, then.” Lin Xiu did not give him the opportunity to continue to speak, stood up, and patted the gravel off his body, then he turned around and walked away,

The strength of these people was ordinary and if he continued with them, they would slow him down. Also, he was about to start school and if he didn’t reach on time, he would probably be in trouble.

“Hey…” Zhang Yin waved at this moment and wanted to ask if Lin Xiu was going to that place but Lin Xiu was gone.

As Lin Xiu went forward, he was very tense, afraid that he would fall into the ruins again.

Fortunately, he walked over 10 kilometers without hiccups.

Soon, it was the evening, and standing in the desert, he could see a big round moon and it appeared as if it was very close.

Lin Xiu was lying in the desert at this time, it was quite chilly at night and wasn’t as warm as it was at noon.

He ate some processed food and special fluid at night just to replenish his energy.

Oh right, he hadn’t looked at that Odd Crystal yet.

With that thought, Lin Xiu stood up, then took out that Odd Crystal from his backpack but found that the large light blue rank 6 Odd crystal appeared to have two small hands and small feet without fingers or toes. It was holding his rank 3 Odd Crystal and looked like it was absorbing the energy from it.

‘What’s this!?’

Lin Xiu saw this and was shocked, then he picked up the rank 6 Odd Crystal.

Looking closely, in his light blue transparent body, there was also a light blue crystal. If he didn’t take a closer look, he wouldn’t be able to see it at all.

“So the Odd Crystal has not been formed completely yet…” Lin Xiu wanted to pinch its body and burst it so that he could retrieve the Odd Crystal in its body but realized that there were little hands and feet that appeared. At this moment, it was hugging its round body.

Lin Xiu also felt its body trembling like it was afraid?

He was taken aback – what the hell is this?

Its body was round and light blue in color and Lin Xiu thought that a rank 6 Odd Crystal was so big but he didn’t expect to see four limbs appearing. However, it didn’t have fingers and looked like the hands of Doraemon.

“Do I kill you or what?” Lin Xiu was a little helpless as he looked at this thing.

But seeing it stand on his hand, hugging itself with its two tiny hands and looking terrified, Lin Xiu simply couldn’t bear to kill it.

“Forget it, I won’t kill you for now,” Lin Xiu said helplessly.

It seemed to understand Lin Xiu’s words and this weird thing appeared to jump in joy in Lin Xiu’s hand.

It looked really happy.

Lin Xiu was completely stunned at this moment – seriously, what is this?

After pondering about it for a moment, Lin Xiu took out his phone and went online to start looking for information about it.

But he looked for a long time and did not find any information about this which made him feel very helpless.

“Don’t run away or I’ll kill you.” Lin Xiu said to this thing in his hand.

After all, it had a rank 6 Odd Crystal in its body.

It slowly climbed to Lin Xiu’s shoulder then bounced happily.

Lin Xiu could not help but smile, then he reached out to touch it. Its body was meaty and very elastic.

Forget it, it’s quite boring along the way anyway and he had no use for a rank 6 Odd Crystal now. He should just treat it as a pet.

With that thought, Lin Xiu sat down cross-legged and practiced the ‘cultivation technique’.

Due to the upgrade of his level, his physical strength was constantly improving but he had to continuously practice in order to improve his ‘cultivation technique’.

This strange little thing was also lying motionless on Lin Xiu’s shoulder at this moment.

As Lin Xiu practiced the ‘cultivation technique’, he felt his body absorbing the surrounding energy constantly. Also, his cultivation speed was much faster here!
