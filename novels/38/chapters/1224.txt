1225 Powerful Energy Barrier

Lei Tong blushed, thought for a while and said abruptly.

“Fix what?”

Lin Xiu said curiously.

“These things… these things, I can fix them all.”

!!

Lei Tong looked around, then pointed to the damaged buildings outside the door.

“These things can be repaired by the people in my City Lord’s Mansion.”

Lin Xiu shrugged.

Lei Tong was in a daze. He seemed to have thought of something at this time and quickly said, “By the way, you haven’t built a defensive energy barrier in this city, have you?”

“I can help you build a super defensive energy barrier!”

“Hm?”

Hearing Lei Tong’s words, Lin Xiu was a little interested at this time.

Because there is really no effective energy barrier in this Ling Xian City.

“What kind of energy barrier can you build?”

Lin Xiu is interested now.

The general energy barrier is not very useful and it is easily destroyed by other people’s attacks.

After all, this is not the earth, the warriors here were all very powerful and sage warriors were everywhere.

“The energy barrier that I can build should be able to completely resist your attack.” Lei Tong thought for a moment, then said seriously.

“This is impossible.”

Before Lin Xiu could speak, Baili Haoling shook his head.

Of course, she knows Lin Xiu’s strength, but now Lei Tong is not even at the level of Sage warrior. Who would believe this?

“I mean it!” Lei Tong became a little anxious at this time.

“Then try.”

Lin Xiu showed a look of interest.

At that time, he wanted to see if there was any energy barrier that he couldn’t break.

“But I need a… a beast god-level odd crystal.” Lei Tong looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“no problem.”

There are still a few of these odd crystals in the treasure house of the City Lord’s Mansion.

On the contrary, Lei Tong was stunned. He did not expect Lin Xiu to agree so readily.

However, he is also excited now. If there is a beast god-level odd crystal, he has the confidence to create a super energy barrier.

Soon, Lei Tong started using various materials in the computer room.

The tools were all on his spaceship at the time, plus the materials provided by Lin Xiu and a god-level odd crystal as the energy supply. Quickly, a mini energy barrier device was completed.

“finished!”

As soon as Lei Tong finished his work, he excitedly said to Lin Xiu who was not far away.

“So fast?”

When Lin Xiu heard Lei Tong’s words, he couldn’t help but be stunned for a moment. He didn’t expect that Lei Tong would get it done in just two hours.

“certainly.”

Lei Tong looked a little proud at this time.

Although he is not a very powerful warrior, he has acquired a strong inheritance.

Although there are many powerful warriors in the God warrior Realm, they are not very strong in terms of technology.

At least that’s what Lin Xiu has seen so far.

“Is it this little thing?” And Baili Haoling also came over at this time.

Looking at the pyramid-like device in Lei Tong’s hands, she couldn’t help but be extremely curious.

“Well, I’ll start it right now to show you.” Lei Tong said, then put the device on the ground.

Snapped!

As Lei Tong pressed the switch on the small pyramid that looked like a decoration and a purple light burst out!

With this device as the center, a circular energy barrier was immediately formed!

Because the device is not large, the circular barrier formed is not very large.

It just seems to cover this room.

Lin Xiu and the others stood inside the barrier at this time and looked outside.

The energy barrier perfectly covered everything around it and Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the energy fluctuation of the unfolded energy barrier was extremely strong.

“let me try.”

Lin Xiu warmed up a little, then stood by the energy barrier.

Hu.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and the source strength started to work.

At this time, a large amount of source strength gathered on the fist.

In the next moment, Lin Xiu directly punched the energy barrier!

Boom!

As Lin Xiu’s fist slammed, an incomparably loud sound suddenly erupted.

The energy barrier seemed to shake violently.

What shocked Lin Xiu was that the energy barrier was only shaken, but there was no way to shatter it.

“what?”

Baili Haoling also opened her eyes wide at this time and they were full of surprise.

The power of Lin Xiu’s punch just now was not weak at all. She never thought that it would not cause any damage to the energy barrier.

“I’ll just say, this energy barrier can definitely block it.”

Lei Tong looked full of confidence at this time.

“It’s interesting.”

Lin Xiu also became interested at this time.

With a thought, the whole body’s source strength gathered again, all concentrated in the fist in his hand.

“Break!!!” Lin Xiu shouted angrily, his fists filled with dazzling light.

This punch is not an ordinary punch, but a god-level skill, destroy the sky!

As Lin Xiu’s punch hit the energy barrier, an incomparably loud sound suddenly erupted again.

At this time, a large number of cracks appeared in the entire energy barrier.

Lei Tong covered his ears and opened his eyes wide to watch this scene in disbelief.

The energy barrier was blasted with so many cracks!?

This is an energy barrier built with the energy of a god-level odd crystal as the core!

It takes a lot of strength to do this.

However, Lei Tong was relieved that the energy barrier was not directly shattered.

Kaka…

But at this moment, a crisp sound suddenly rang out.

Taking a closer look, the energy barrier with a large number of cracks began to slowly break!

Snap!

With another sound, this energy barrier was completely destroyed.

“Your energy barrier is really strong.”

Lin Xiu said to the already dumbfounded Lei Tong.

What Lin Xiu said is also true. If he hadn’t used the strength of his whole body and used the god-level boxing technique he just learned, he really couldn’t have destroyed this energy barrier.

This Lei Tong is really a talent.

“Lei Tong, how big of an energy barrier can you build?” Lei Tong, who was a little lost, was suddenly shocked when Lin Xiu asked him that question.

“As long as there are enough powerful odd crystals, I can build a more powerful energy barrier!” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Lei Tong was extremely excited at this time.

That’s right, he is indeed confident that he can build an incomparably powerful energy barrier.

“Very good, you can stay in Lingxian City then.”

Lin Xiu said with satisfaction.

“Really…really!?”
