Chapter 550: Exchanging vs Robbing

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

This front foot of the colour-changing mantis was quite useless.

If he was able to collect more of these front feet, he would be able to melt it and make it into a miraculous weapon.

If he didn’t want to, he would even sell them for a good price with the special skills of these materials.

“I think that’s all...”

Lin Xiu took a good look around him before muttering to himself.

There were multiple odd crystals in this place but Lin Xiu could clearly feel that other than this colour-changing mantis and the Scavenger Crow, there was still something even more dangerous out there.

This wasn’t a place that he should stay for a long time.

Lin Xiu carried the heavy front foot of the colour-changing mantis into his bag and headed in the other direction.

Due to what happened earlier, most of the warriors did not want to stay any longer and all of them decided to leave the Burial Ground.

Compared to the odd crystals, their lives mattered more.

He took a look at the road before him and continued walking in that direction.

“Young man, looks like you’re pretty powerful.” Just when Lin Xiu was about to leave the Burial Ground, a voice came from behind him.

Lin Xiu frowned when he heard the voice from behind because he had been feeling that there was someone following him.

When he turned around, he noticed that there were eight warriors who were standing right behind him.

These were the men who at the Burial Grounds earlier and Lin Xiu recognised a few of them.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Xiu smiled as he asked.

Lin Xiu was showing such a gullible smile that it made him look like an innocent, harmless young man.

These men started laughing. According to Lin Xiu’s age, he definitely wouldn’t be a powerful warrior.

He was just lucky and was brave enough to fight the terrifying colour-changing mantis.

“Nothing. We;re just interested in the front foot of the colour-changing mantis. Give them to us.” One of the men pointed towards the backpack that Lin Xiu was carrying, which was now filled with the mantis’s front foot.

“Oh? So you’re planning on robbing me?” Lin Xiu thought about it before saying.

“No, why would we be robbing?” One of the warriors shook his head and took out an odd crystal from his pocket. Then, he held it in his hands and told Lin Xiu, “We will be exchanging it with this odd crystal.”

Lin Xiu looked at the crystal that was held in his hands, it was indeed a rank 7 odd crystal.

Back in the days when Lin Xiu had just started cultivation, he might think that this odd crystals were precious but now, these rank 7 odd crystals were just something mundane.

“Your jokes aren’t very funny.” Lin Xiu smiled as he answered them.

“Young man, there are some things that may be unsuitable for you.” When the man heard Lin Xiu’s answer, their faces turned awful.

“That’s rubbish. Isn’t this a robbery then?” Lin Xiu repeated his question.

“You...” After being repeatedly questioned by Lin XIiu, the man turned even more angry and he picked up his machete.

The rest of them started moving towards Lin Xiu as well with an unfriendly look in their eyes.

It was obvious that these men were aware of the values in these colour-changing mantis and none of them would care about the life of a warrior.

“I didn’t think that there would be someone here to deliver me EXPs.” Lin Xiu shook his head helplessly.

“Go to hell!” Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although they didn’t really understand what Lin Xiu was saying, the man who was negotiating with Lin Xiu with the odd crystal, was already dashing towards Lin Xiu with his machete!

Kill the man and get his load.

The rest of them reacted as well and completely surrounded Lin Xiu. All of them started attacking Lin Xiu at once!

This was because they had already seen Lin Xiu’s full abilities just now and they did not dare to look down on him.

Lin Xiu took his time to observe these men and as he activated his ‘Analytical Eyes’, he could clearly see that these men were all rank 6 warriors and only one of them was a rank 7 warrior.

The man holding the machete was the rank 7 warrior. He leaped high into the machete in both his hands. He aimed it towards Lin Xiu and was about to chop him into halves!

Pili Huala – –

Lin Xiu remained on his spot and in an instant, there was a pale blue sphere that appeared all over Lin Xiu’s body.

’圆’!!!

‘Yuan!!!’

Lin Xiu blocked all of their attacks with his ‘Yuan’!

As their weapons landed on Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’, they suddenly felt a surge of sharp pain all over their body.

It came with a sense of numbness as well!

When they took a closer look, they noticed that the lightning from Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’ had passed on to them and had spread to all over their bodies as well.

“Damn it!!!”

The lightning was deadly for the rank 6 warriors but the rank 7 warrior was the only one who could bear the deadly effects of the lightning.

He was still able to move the machete in his arms and started hacking Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’ uncontrollably!

Boom Boom Boom – –

The loud sound followed one after another. Forget about breaking the ‘Yuan’, Lin Xiu remained on the same spot and was not moved at all by the attacks.

“You’re too weak.” Lin Xiu said calmly.

“What did you just say?!”

The rank 7 warrior got pissed after hearing what he said and the energy in his body burst out like crazy. At the very next moment, even the machete was filled with energy and it was slowly emitting a bright light.

Clang – –

As he tried to attack him with the machete once again, Lin Xiu had the Dark Edge in his arms that blocked the machete.

“Sh*t...”

There was a mast amount of lightning that surrounded the spear. Since both their weapons were in contact with each other, the lightning from the Dark Edge soon spread towards the rank 7 warrior.

The current of the lightning became much stronger than before. Even though he was a rank 7 warrior, he could feel the terrifying lightning all over his body and he was about to turn crazy because of it.

But, how is it that he was still standing?!

The man was filled with questions but he had no other choice. If he doesn’t kill Lin Xiu now, he would be the one who’ll be dead next!

“AHHHHHHHHH!!!!!”

He roared in rage as he continued fighting with Lin Xiu.

Since he was a rank 7 warrior, it wouldn’t be that easy for Lin Xiu to defeat him. Lin Xiu was also frantically waving the spear that was in his arms. Other than the lightning that was already surrounding the spear, there were flaming birds that flew out of the spear!

Koong Loong – Koong Loong – –

The flaming birds landed on the ground and it gave out a loud explosion.

The ground around them was filled with holes all of a sudden..

As for the rest of the rank 6 warriors, they finally escaped the numbness that they felt from the lightning from before.

When they saw Lin Xiu fighting, they didn’t dare to come any closer to him!
