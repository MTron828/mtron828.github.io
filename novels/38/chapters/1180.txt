1181 Teng Yuan

“Keep an eye on them. I’m going to kill that brat first!”

Teng Yuan stared at Lin Xiu as he said to his men.

The rest of the men nodded their heads obediently as well.

As for the rest of the warriors who were captured, they had a bad feeling about it.

!!

However, they didn’t have the abilities to fight them.

With their current strength, they were no match for Teng Yuan’s men.

Teng Yuan had his eyes locked on Lin Xiu who had just killed another warrior. That’s when his eyes turned cold.

Teng Yuan grabbed onto his axe with both hands and then swung it at Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

With the loud explosion, there was a large amount of energy that was released from the enormous axe and it went straight for Lin Xiu!

Due to the huge energy that was released, there were cracks all over the ground.

Lin Xiu could clearly feel that something was coming at him. He quickly turned around and saw the horrifying energy that was about to touch his body.

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered. At that moment, he immediately released his ‘sphere’ to block the attack that was coming at him.

Although Lin Xiu’s reflexes were quick enough, he was still pushed far behind because of the impact.

“Interesting.”

Lin Xiu looked at him and replied calmly.

With the long spear in his arm, he thrusted it sideways and pierced through the head of the warrior who was attacking Lin Xiu from the side.

“Damn it!” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Seeing how arrogant Lin Xiu was being, the expression on his face looked incredibly awful.

Then, his huge body suddenly disappeared from the scene.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and he held onto his long spear, blocking the attack with his reflex.

Clang – –

Teng Yuan suddenly appeared right in front of Lin Xiu with an axe in his arm and Lin Xiu managed to stop it with his long spear.

Teng Yuan had a hideous look on his face as he raised his machete, trying to chop Lin Xiu into pieces!

Xiu – –

Lin Xiu quickly shifted his body, completely dodging the attack.

The huge warrior axe went straight to the ground and then there was a huge explosion.

There was a huge crack that appeared on the ground.

“Move aside!”

Teng Yuan looked at the other warriors and screamed at the top of his lungs.

There were other warriors who were still trying to attack Lin Xiu. When they heard Teng Yuan’s voice, all of them immediately stopped.

However, they were dying for Teng Yuan to get them to stop attacking Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu had killed several of their comrades. With such abilities, it was impossible for him to defeat Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu quickly moved aside. When he saw how Teng Yuan was rushing toward him with the axe, Lin Xiu gripped tightly onto his long spear.

Teng Yuan was indeed someone powerful.

Lin Xiu didn’t want to be careless. He quickly gathered all of the energy in his body and attacked Teng Yuan who was coming at him!

Clang – –

The tip of the long spear landed on the axe that Teng Yuan was holding onto.

There were sparks everywhere.

Teng Yuan, who was attacking with all his might, was pushed backwards because of the impact.

But soon, Teng Yuan managed to steady his body. He grabbed onto his axe tightly and transferred a large amount of energy on it, causing it to turn gold in colour.

Lin Xiu could feel that there was a terrible amount of energy coming from the axe.

Before Teng Yuan moved any further, he quickly moved his long spear.

Xiu xiu xiu — –

The dark blue flaming birds were released all at the same time!

“This is nothing!”

Teng Yuan saw the flaming birds that were coming at him but he didn’t look afraid.

He lifted his axe and started attacking the flaming birds!

The flaming birds that Lin Xiu released were easily destroyed by the axe that was glowing brightly in gold. He chopped them in half and the flaming birds completely disappeared.

He managed to chop these flames?!

When Lin Xiu saw what happened, the look in his eyes changed.

“Young man, you’re dead!”

Teng Yuan had a hideous laugh on his face.

It felt as if killing Lin Xiu was only a matter of time.

“Teng Yuan is too strong…”

However, the rest of the warriors, who were being surrounded by Teng Yuan’s men, clenched onto their jaws as well.

They thought that this young man that suddenly appeared would be able to save them.

But, from how it looks now, it seems like they have expected too much.

Teng Yuan’s abilities were much stronger than they had thought.

Lin Xiu had his eyes locked onto the warrior axe and Teng Yuan who was getting closer to him. Lin Xiu quickly gathered his thoughts and released the energy that was in his body.

Lin Xiu reached out his left hand and clenched onto his fist.

The faint golden energy that was released from Lin Xiu’s body turned into small atoms and they slowly gathered together to form multiple divine marks!

These divine marks quickly joined together and formed a huge giant!

Teng Yuan, who was ready to continue attacking Lin Xiu, looked at the huge giant standing right in front of him. The pupils in his eyes shrank uncontrollably.

What was this?!

Just when Teng Yuan was still in shock, the huge fist of the divine mark giant was coming right at him!

“Ahhhhh!!!”

Teng Yuan stared at what was happening ahead of him. He did not try to dodge the attack and instead, used his axe to block the huge blazing fist that was getting closer to him!

Boom – –

It was followed by a loud explosion, The axe that was in his hands was thrown onto the ground by the giant’s fist.

The huge fist of the giant landed directly on his body and it threw him miles away onto the ground.

The entire ground started shaking vigorously as well.

“What….what was that?!”

The warriors who thought that Lin Xiu would be killed by Teng Yuan stared at Lin Xiu in shock.

Their eyes were filled with disbelief.

“It looked like a divine mark…”

One of the warriors started getting excited.

He has seen a divine mark but he has never seen anyone who was able to create so many divine marks and form a giant out of it!

He has never even heard of it!

“Is…..Teng Yuan dead?”

The rest of the warriors, who were surrounded by Teng Yuan’s men, clenched their fists as they were getting anxious.

Once Teng Yuan was dead, they would have a chance at survival!

“AHHHHHH!!!!”

Suddenly, a loud scream came from Teng Yuan.

The fist that the giant placed on the ground was slowly being lifted upwards!

Teng Yuan wasn’t dead!
