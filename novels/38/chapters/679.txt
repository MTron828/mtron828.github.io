Lin Xiu looked over there and saw a group of people walking over from the side.

Walking in front was a man, dandified in appearance.

At this moment, he glanced at Lin Xiu with a look of disdain in his eyes.

“Liu Cheng, what nonsense are you talking about! He is my savior!”

When Liu Yanran heard his words, she immediately said with a pale face.

“Hey, what kind of savior is he?”

Liu Cheng said with a sneer at this time.

The lackeys behind him also laughed at this time. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“You guys…” Liu Yanran bit her lip lightly, so angry that she almost died.

This Liu Cheng is her cousin, because their parents are at odds, and the relationship between them is also very bad.

“Boy, where did she pick up a beggar like you? Get out of here.”

At this time, Liu Cheng looked at Lin Xiu, then said with a sneer.

“I’m talking about you, if you hear me, get out of here!”

The lackey next to Liu Cheng looked at Lin Xiu at this time, and said cursingly.

While cursing, he walked over to Lin Xiu’s side, reached out and looked like he was about to push Lin Xiu down.

“What are you doing!”

When Liu Yanran saw this scene, her expression suddenly changed.

Boom–

Just when the man’s hand was about to touch Lin Xiu, he felt his wrist was caught!

“You…!”

The man opened his eyes wide, and when his other hand was about to attack Lin Xiu’s body, he was instantly caught by Lin Xiu.

Both his wrists were caught and he couldn’t move them at all.

And at this time, with the sound of ‘click’ and ‘click’, he felt as if his bones were about to crack.

“What!!!”

The intense pain caused him to let out a miserable cry.

Boom–

Lin Xiu pushed him away, he stepped back for a long distance, and then sat down on the ground.

“It won’t be like this next time.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

At this time, the man who fell on the ground was sweating coldly, and he felt that the wrists of his hands were still in severe pain.

“Benefactor, let’s go this way.”

Liu Yanran didn’t want to be on the same level as Liu Cheng, so she spoke to Lin Xiu at this time.

Lin Xiu nodded, and walked over to the other side with Liu Yanran.

“Damn bitch!” Liu Cheng gritted his teeth in anger when he saw this scene.

Looking at the man lying on the ground over there, panting in pain, he walked over and gave him a kick.

“What a waste!”

“That was my cousin just now, a playboy.”

When Liu Yanran took Lin Xiu to continue walking inside, she said to Lin Xiu.

She was really afraid of conflict just now, worried that Lin Xiu would kill Liu Cheng and the others.

After all, when he was in the forest, Lin Xiu was very ruthless.

“En.”

Lin Xiu replied indifferently, and didn’t say much.

Soon, he arrived at a villa.

“Benefactor, you can rest here.”

“This is our reception area, no one lives here.”

At the door of the two-storey villa with a large courtyard, Liu Yanran pressed the machine next to her, and in the next moment, a card came out from the machine.

“This is the key.”

Liu Yanran handed the card to Lin Xiu, then smiled and said.

Lin Xiu was not pretentious either, and took the card directly.

“There are a lot of new clothes in the house, as well as supporting facilities such as computers. If you want to know the situation of Tianlong City, you can also check the

information on the computer.”

Liu Yanran continued to introduce.

“Okay.”

Lin Xiu nodded, slightly surprised. It seems that the Liu family’s status in this Tianlong City should be quite high.

They even had such a high-end villa ready for connecting and entertaining guests.

“T’ll deal with some matters first. If Benefactor needs me, dial 9814 from the phone inside. That’s my phone number.”

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly, and after watching Liu Yanran leave, he walked directly into the villa.

The courtyard of the villa was very large, and around the courtyard, there were a lot of weapons, which seemed to be used for training.

Lin Xiu didn’t look at them, he just dropped the card and entered the villa.

Clap clap-

As soon as he walked in, the lights around the place automatically turned on.

Taking a closer look, the hall was quite spacious, and the decorations around seemed to be very high-end.

There was a large bathtub in the bathroom. After the hot water was put in, Lin Xiu lay down directly in it, and immediately felt comfortable.
