Chapter 372: One of the Founders of the Sacred Region Academy

“No, they wouldn’t say.”

The old man shook his head at this time. He knew that what Lin Xiu wanted to say was whether the people in black would tell the soldiers that they saw him taking out the contents of the alien ore.

Lin Xiu nodded when he heard his affirmation.

“But I’m very curious, how exactly did you do it?” The old man touched his white beard at this time, then looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“This is a secret.” Lin Xiu also said mysteriously at this time.

This was one of the skills in his system. Of course, he couldn’t tell others casually, and even if he said it, people may not believe it.

“Hahaha, interesting, interesting.” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the old man laughed and he wasn’t mad at all.

“By the way, you have to pay for the damaged things here.” The old man glanced around at this time and then said naturally.

Hearing this, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened, and he couldn’t help but cursed inwardly, “Damn, isn’t this caused by you when you were fighting with them?”

This old man was too shameless, he wants to scan him for his money?

“I’ll pay for mine but these damages here were caused by your flames, right?” The old man pointed to the destruction caused by Lin Xiu’s ‘Awe of the Phoenix’.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched, and his head was full of black lines.

“How much?” Although a little unwilling, Lin Xiu still asked. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Let me calculate.” The old man smiled, very satisfied at this time, then looked at the destroyed buildings over there and took out a mini calculator. Then, he said, “I’ll give you a discount. The cost is a total of 500,000 Union coins.”

Hearing this, Lin Xiu staggered, then opened his eyes wide and said, “Why so much!?”

This was basically robbery ah.

“Do you want me to give you a breakdown?” The old man raised his brow at this time.

Hearing his babbling, Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched.

“Alright, I will pay you, I will pay you.” Lin Xiu held his forehead at this time and said.

“En, okay.” The old man nodded in satisfaction. Then he dished out a card machine from nowhere and said to Lin Xiu, “Swipe it.”

Lin Xiu glared at the old man and took out a card from his pocket.

When he returned from the Dark Forest, he sold some materials in the small town there so he still had a lot of Union Coins on the card.

Watching Lin Xiu draw the 500,000 Union coins in the card, the old man smiled contentedly.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue and said.

This old man was too wretched, who knows how much the old man would cheat them if they continued staying here.

Luo Yue nodded. At this moment, she took out the phone while she was walking, and she seemed to be searching for something.

“Wait.” Just when Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were about to return to the upper side, the old man suddenly called out.

“What?” Lin Xiu turned and looked at the old man and said aloud.

Does this old man still want to cheat him?

“Tomorrow at eight o’clock in the morning, there will be a special plane to take you back to the Sacred Region Academy.” The old man stroked his beard and then said with a smile.

“Do we need to pay?” Lin Xiu asked instinctively.

“Hahaha, of course not.” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words at this time, the old man smiled.

Lin Xiu curled his lips, then ignored the old man as he looked up the stairs.

There was no sound coming from the upper side anymore – those people should have left.

“What an interesting young man.”

At this time, only the old man was left. Looking at the mess around him, he touched his beard and said with a smile.

“That girl, she should be from the Luo family, right… how interesting, the Luo family would hang out with ordinary people?”

“Interesting, interesting.”

Luo Yue and Lin Xiu have now walked up.

Going back to the room, Lin Xiu stretched. If these people hadn’t come over tonight, he would have been able to soak in a comfortable hot spring bath.

With Luo Yue…

An image seemed to appear in Lin Xiu’s mind and he swallowed.

At this time, he looked at Luo Yue, who was walking next to him, and saw that she was staring at the phone screen, as if looking at something, her face also showed a rare and cautious expression.

“What’s wrong?” Seeing this, Lin Xiu asked.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue took the phone and handed it to him.

Lin Xiu was taken aback, then took Luo Yue’s mobile phone. Looking at the content displayed on the mobile phone, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but stared.

Because the picture on the phone was the old man just now.

And looking at this interface, it seemed to be the website of the Warrior Union.

Lin Xiu swiped down on the screen at this time and he saw the following introduction:

Xia Xing

Vice President of Warrior Union

One of the founders of the Sacred Region Academy

…

…

“Damn!” Lin Xiu’s eyes widened as he saw the list of his titles below.

This old man was not only one of the founders of the Sacred Region Academy, but also the vice president of the Warrior Union? Thinking of this, Lin Xiu gasped.

This old man is too powerful eh?

“When did you find out?” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but swallowed secretly at this time and said.

Who would have thought that this old man who seemed so petty was actually so powerful?

No wonder he managed to deal with the warriors in black so easily.

“When they called him Elder Xia.” Luo Yue said lightly.

“But the difference between this photo and how he looks in real life is quite big.” Lin Xiu curled his lips, thinking of how the old man cheated his money, he couldn’t help but complain.

When the two returned to the room, Lin Xiu was no longer sleepy.

He went into the training ground and sat down cross-legged, then started the ‘Cultivation technique’.

At this time, the weird ore in Lin Xiu’s pocket seemed to shine through his clothes.
