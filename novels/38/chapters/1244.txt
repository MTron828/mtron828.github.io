1245 Entering the Storage Space

Lei Chong was completely in shock.

However, the end of the machete had already hit the wall in front of him and there was a loud sound.

“It was an…..accident.”

Lei Chong looked at the crack that was on the wall and he felt speechless.

!!

He didn’t think that the machete would be so heavy that he couldn’t even hold it and it fell onto the ground.

“Hmm?”

Lin Xiu looked at the cracks as if it was something interesting.

Baili Haoling immediately threw a few slashes over it.

There were already cracks in the wall and it instantly fell apart.

Soon, they could see that there was a golden door behind the wall that had been split apart.

“So the storage room is hidden in here.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed in interest as he looked at the door.

This must definitely be the entrance to the storage room. It was definitely interesting to know what treasures he had kept in this room.

Baili Haoling then subconsciously pushed the door open.

Just when her hands touched the door, there was a strong force of current that was coming at her.

It was a terrifying one and Baili Haoling’s pupil shrank in fear.

At that moment, she couldn’t free herself from the door.

However, Lin Xiu quickly grabbed onto her shoulder and pulled her backwards, away from the door.

“Huuuuuuu~”

Baili Haoling was still panting.

The current was terrifying and she was almost stuck at the door because of the strong current.

“Are you alright?”

Lin Xiu quickly checked on her.

“I’m…..I’m fine.”

Baili Haoling quickly calmed down before answering him.

“City lord, let me solve this thing for you.”

Lei Chong took a look at it and he knew that there were some contraptions here.

He was an expert in these things.

“That won’t be necessary.”

When Lei Chong was getting excited to show his skills, Lin Xiu shook his hands.

“But…”

Just when Lei Chong wanted to speak up, Lin Xiu placed on of his hands on the golden door.

Sizzling – –

As soon as he touched the door, there was a loud explosion heard.

The thick and strong current went all around Lin Xiu’s body.

It was terrifying for them to look at it and there was a toasted smell in the air.

However, Lin Xiu looked as if nothing was happening to him.

He pushed the door with both hands and the golden door was slowly pushed open.

Ka ka ka – –

It was incredibly difficult for him to push it open and Lin Xiu had to use a lot of strength to move it.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

When there was an opening at the door that could only fit one person, Lin Xiu noticed that there were laser beams being shot out!

What the hell?

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrunk instantly.

Then, he quickly released his ‘sphere’.

Boom boom boom– –

There were multiple laser beams that landed on Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’ and it was followed by loud explosions.

Lin Xiu didn’t think that there would be such powerful laser beams from inside the room.

Although these scary beams did not break Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’, the huge impact that came from it still caused Lin Xiu to be thrown far away from the door.

Lin Xiu clenched his teeth and gripped tightly onto the handles, refusing to let go.

The door was too heavy and once he let go of it, the doors would close once again.

Get it opened!!!!!!!

Seeing how there were still laser beams coming from inside, Lin Xiu roared in rage.

Then, he released all of the energy in his body.

...

Boom – –

At that moment, the door was finally pushed open!

Lin Xiu looked around and noticed that there were multiple unique set ups above his head.

These were the ones that were releasing the powerful laser beams.

Lin Xiu looked at them and sneered. Then, he brought out his long spear.

The long spear moved gracefully in his arms and there were multiple blue flames that were released.

All of them were aimed at the set ups on the ceiling of the room.

Boom – –

With the loud explosion, the equipment that was hung on the ceiling exploded one after another.

All of them have been destroyed by the explosion!

Lin Xiu walked into the room as the door was finally opened. Baili Haoling and Lei Chong followed him into the room as well.

...

“How can there be such powerful equipment here…..?”

Baili Haoling walked into the room and gave a slight comment when she noticed Lin Xiu who was panting.

“These laser beams are formed by god-level odd crystals, it would definitely be powerful.”

Lei Chong walked to the equipment that had been destroyed and started analysing them.

Soon, he dug out an odd crystal from the pile of burnt debris.

“As expected!!!”

Lei Chong was in awe when he saw the odd crystal.

This was a god-level odd crystal! Although it has been used, it was still something surprising!

Then, Little Bai flew into the room.

It was now as small as Rollie and immediately took away the god-level odd crystal that Lei Chong had in his hands.

“Hey! Give it back!!”

Lei Chong’s eyes were opened wide when this happened.

But….Little Bai was flapping its wings in the air and there was nothing that Lei Chong could do.

Little Bai glanced at Lei Chong and started chewing the odd crystal.

There was a crackling sound heard.

Lei Chong continued staring at the bird.

He couldn’t help but feel that this Ice Crystal White Bird was laughing at him.

Lin Xiu thought that it was funny as well but there was nothing that he could do about it. He looked around and noticed that there was something shining brightly inside the room.

“Let’s head over there.”

The space was huge but there was nothing found here.

It looked like the important things were further inside the room.

Boom – – ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

After walking for a while, Lin Xiu walked into an invisible wall.

“Hmm?”

Lin Xiu frowned as he stretched out his hand and confirmed that there was an invisible wall in front of him.

It completely stopped them from moving forward.

Then, there were bright purple lights that appeared before them.

There was also a slight purple glow seen on the invisible wall.

This was an energy barrier. A special type of barrier.

“Are there such things here?”

Baili Haoling frowned when she saw what it was.

Not only were Sha Qiong’s things greatly hidden, he even had so many defences.

“Looks like we need to be verified before being allowed to enter.”

Lei Chong seemed to have noticed something before informing them about it.

“Please complete iris and DNA authentication.”

There was a row of words that appeared on the energy barrier.
