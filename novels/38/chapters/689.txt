Chapter 690 Tianjiao List

There were whispers around.

When Lin Xiu heard these voices, he also looked towards the front.

A young man in a blue uniform with a long sword on his back was walking in at this time.

Beside him were several other warriors. The others, Lin Xiu, didn’t feel anything, but the man in the blue uniform, Lin Xiu felt the terrifying aura coming from him.

After the Analytic Eye was activated, he could clearly feel that this person was actually a rank 9 warrior!

And he was not an ordinary rank 9 warrior, he was even more powerful than the two old men that he killed in Sky City. “Who is this?”

At this time, Lei Tong also noticed the man in the blue battle uniform on the other table, and said to Chen Lan and the others curiously.

Because as he walked in, many people in the store all looked at him.

And even discussed their appearance. “Our Tianlong City has a list of the top ten talents, and all of them are young warriors under the age of 26.” “He is Qian Jin, the second on the Tianjiao list. It is said that his strength is already at the peak of rank 9, and he will soon become a Master warrior.”

Chen Lan was very updated on the news in this aspect, and at this time, he told Lin Xiu and Lei Tong everything he knew.

“This time, in this warrior conference, there are ten places in Tianlong City, and almost every time, all ten people on the Tianjiao list fill the places.”

Chen Lan smiled, then seemed to think of something, and quickly continued, “But Brother Lin, you are much better than them.”

“Don’t flatter me like that.”

Lin Xiu smiled helplessly and said, at this time he was also a little curious, “Where is the person in the first place?”

“The number one is Wu Changkong of the Wu family. His strength is very powerful.”

“It is said that he has reached the level of a Master Warrior, and he is also the only Master warrior in Sky City!”

Chen Lan explained.

“En, it’s kind of interesting.”

Hearing this, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed.

Originally he thought that rank 9 was the apex, but he didn’t expect that above rank 9, there were even more powerful beings.

Lin Xiu now wanted to see how strong a warrior at the Master Warrior level was. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“What are you looking at!” Zhang Hu and Su Qiang, who were at the same table with Lin Xiu, looked at Qian Jin’s table.

A warrior next to Qian Jin clearly felt it, and shouted sharply at this time. Another man simply splashed a drink over them.

In an instant, Zhang Hu and Su Qiang were drenched.

“What are you doing!” Seeing this scene, Lei Tong immediately shouted angrily.

“Forget it.” Seeing this scene, Chen Lan was a little angry, but he seemed to think of something, so he pulled Lei Tong’s clothes and said.

The people at that table didn’t seem to be good people, and there was also the second most powerful warrior on the Tianjiao list.

It was better not to have a conflict with them.

“Yo? Where did this pariah come from, how dare you talk back?”

Hearing Lei Tong’s words at this time, the man who splashed the drink over walked directly to Lin Xiu’s table.

He looked at Lei Tong who was sitting on the chair with a nasty look and said.

“Humph!”

Lei Tong snorted coldly at this time. Although he didn’t say anything, he looked at him without any signs of fear.

“Looks like you’re quite arrogant huh.”

The man’s face suddenly turned ugly, and he was about to smash Lei Tong’s head with his fist!

Lei Tong’s face changed slightly, and he also stretched out his fist, colliding with the man’s fist.

Boom–

With a dull sound, in the next moment, Lei Tong’s body flew directly to the back.

Just when his body was about to hit the wall behind him, he felt that his body was stabilized.

“Are you alright?”

Lei Tong took a look and realized that it was Lin Xiu.

“I’m fine.”

Lei Tong shook his head, but after a closer look, his fists were already red, and there was a lot of blood.

The strength of this man was very strong, Lei Tong was not an opponent at all.

“Isn’t it a little too much?”

Lin Xiu looked at the man who had just walked over, narrowed his eyes and said.

“Too much? It’s not over yet.”

The man laughed loudly, as if he had heard a funny joke.

“What do you want?”

Chen Lan’s face also became ugly.

“You guys, kneel down and apologize to me, and I’ll forget about it.”

The man glanced at Zhang Hu and Su Qiang, who were drenched with drinks all over their faces, then said with a sneer.

When Chen Lan and the others heard his words, their faces became extremely ugly.

Kneel here in public?

This is simply bullying.

“No way!”

Lei Tong became even more furious. “Then go to hell!”

At this moment, the man drew out his long sword and stabbed Lei Tong directly!

Although this was in the city, killing a ‘pariah’ was not a big deal to them.

Boom–

But at this moment, Lin Xiu stretched out his right hand and grabbed the long sword!

The people around couldn’t help exclaiming when they saw this scene.

Although this sword looked ordinary, the power of a sword stabbed by such a high-level warrior was still very powerful.

But Lin Xiu actually grabbed the long sword with his bare hands!

“Courting death!”

Seeing Lin Xiu grabbing the long sword he stabbed, his face suddenly became extremely nasty.

Lin Xiu grabbed the sword with his bare hands, it was just embarrassing!

He roared angrily, using the long sword in his hand, he was about to continue to use force to stab Lin Xiu directly.

But Lin Xiu simply grabbed the long sword in his hand, no matter how hard he tried, the long sword would not move at all.

“You…!”

His eyes widened and the source strength of his whole body was mobilized, but he still couldn’t shake Lin Xiu in the slightest!

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly, and then with a sudden force on his right hand, the man who was holding the long sword was flung out of the gate!

“Can’t even hold your own weapon, tsk tsk.”

Lin Xiu looked at the long sword in his hand, then shook his head and said.

The people around were shocked when they saw the scene just now.

Nevermind that Lin Xiu grabbed the sword with his bare hands, he could even fling the man away!

If this was done by someone from Marqi, they wouldn’t be so shocked, but now it was a man with black eyes, which was simply shocking. “Courting death!”

At the same time, the people at Qian Jin’s table quickly walked out, and after picking up the man who was thrown out by Lin Xiu, he glared at Lin Xiu.

“Why, you didn’t manage to bully others, and now you’re so embarrassed that you’re mad?”
