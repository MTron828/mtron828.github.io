Chapter 333: The Real Awe Of The Phoenix

Bang–

As a dull sound resounded, Zhang Jie’s dagger penetrated Luo Yue’s shoulder.

“What a pity, I was so close to killing you.” As the dagger pierced through Luo Yue’s shoulder, a trace of blood flowed down.

At that moment just now, Luo Yue still dodged instinctively so the dagger did not stab her vital parts.

“But too bad, you have no chance left…!” As Zhang Jie spoke, the dagger in her left hand pierced Luo Yue’s head directly!

Dang–

Just at this critical moment, Lin Xiu suddenly appeared and the tip of the Dark Edge Spear blocked the blade of the dagger.

She looked over and saw Lin Xiu.

“Courting death!!!” Zhang Jie became furious. She pulled out the dagger from Luo Yue’s shoulder and slashed directly towards Lin Xiu!

As she drew the dagger out, a trace of blood splattered in the air.

Lin Xiu’s eyes turned red when he saw this scene.

The veins on his body seemed to have swelled up.

Dang dang dang——

Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge Spear wildly and fought Zhang Jie who was attacking him.

While the spear collided with Zhang Jie’s dagger, there were a lot of sparks.

Zhang Jie was slightly taken aback because she could sense that Lin Xiu’s strength not only did not weaken as they fought, he even became stronger.

“What? You’re mad?” Zhang Jie said while staring at Lin Xiu and fighting.

Lin Xiu didn’t answer her and stared at her with reddened eyes, his whole body exploded with an extremely powerful aura.

Bang bang——

With Lin Xiu’s spear swinging, phoenixes burst out continuously and charged towards Zhang Jie!

But Zhang Jie reacted swiftly and managed to dodge those phoenixes’ attacks!

“Hahaha, although your fighting instincts are great, you are only a rank 5 warrior! Did you think you can kill me!” Zhang Jie laughed and seemed happier when she saw Lin Xiu getting angry.

Just then, she felt an ominous and cold air down her spine which caused her to freeze. She turned around abruptly and saw a huge white flame rushing towards her!

Bang——

This time, her body couldn’t dodge the attack and was directly hit by this white flame.

Her whole body was covered in this white flame.

“Ah!!!” She seemed to feel the intense pain and wailed in agony.

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked over there and saw Luo Yue at the back. She seemed too weak to stand and was clutching her left shoulder with her right hand.

But when he took a closer look, he could still see that there was blood flowing out of Luo Yue’s wound, staining her battle suit. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Hurry up…Kill her!” Luo Yue suppressed the pain from her wound and called out to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu could hear very well. Although Luo Yue was weak at the moment and her voice was very soft, Lin Xiu could still hear her clearly.

At this time, he turned to Zhang Jie. Those ice lotus fires had already covered Zhang Jie’s body but they did not burn her body. Instead, because of the ice lotus fire, a large amount of frost appeared on her body like they were going to freeze her body.

Although this scene looked strangely magical, Lin Xiu had no time to hesitate. Now he was gripping the Dark Edge Spear with both hands. At this moment, all the power in his body was activated and he swung the spear hard!!!

Lin Xiu clearly felt it at this time, the power seemed different.

It seemed that his understanding of the skill has become a little deeper.

“Awe… of the Phoenix!!!”

Bang——

Following Lin Xiu’s roar, hundreds of phoenixes burst out and flew over, forming a huge fire phoenix!

This was the real Awe of the Phoenix!

The surrounding air has become distorted and a scorching sensation has been transmitted to the entire space.

And at this moment, this huge fire phoenix rushed towards Zhang Jie!

Zhang Jie wanted to get rid of those ice lotus fires from her body, but at this moment she suddenly saw that this huge fire phoenix was rushing towards her!

The pupils in Zhang Jie’s eyes constricted. She felt the terrifying power of this huge phoenix.

Her body wanted to unfold the ‘Sphere’ for protection, but what she didn’t expect was that her source strength seemed to be suppressed by some force. At this moment, there was no way to unfold it.

“Get lost!!!” Zhang Jie screamed and as her body trembled, the white flames appeared like they were going to disperse!

She wanted to dodge at this time, but she did not expect that there was already a lot of frost on her body and the reaction ability of her body was greatly reduced.

“Trying to flee!?”

And at the same time, she heard a cold snort behind and saw Luo Yue suppressing the pain from her shoulder as she waved the long sword. The source strength used the long sword as a medium and burst out in an instant. Then, it turned into a huge white flame, directly hitting Zhang Jie’s body!

Ice lotus fire!

Bang——

The white flame hit her body again and at this moment, the ‘Awe of the phoenix’ released by Lin Xiu also charged over!

There was no way of avoiding the attack!

“Go to hell!!!” Lin Xiu yelled. It was as if a fire phoenix pierced through the sky and rushed over. Hitting Zhang Jie’s body right after Luo Yue’s Ice lotus fire!

Bang bang——

The two kinds of flames seemed to have a certain chemical reaction. There was a loud explosion and the entire ground shook violently!!!
