Chapter 185: Fighting Over

“What is the Red Lotus Fire?” Lin Xiu asked when he heard Luo Yue.

It looked like fire but did not feel like so and was more like a ball of energy.

It resembled the energy inside odd crystals but odd crystals were in a solid-state.

“A very powerful type of energy and looks like a fire lotus.” Luo Yue replied.

Zhang Yin and the others rushed over and felt that the surrounding was extremely hot to the extent that they were drenched in perspiration.

When they saw the Red Lotus Fire, the expressions in their eyes changed.

“What a powerful energy…” Zhang Yin muttered to himself when he saw the Red Lotus Fire.

The energy accumulated within could be said to be equal to many odd crystals added up.

And it was slightly different from ordinary odd crystals…

“Can it be absorbed?” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue and asked.

It contained extremely powerful energy and Lin Xiu thought to use his cultivation technique to absorb it…

“No, it’s too dangerous. If you’re careless, your entire being will be disintegrated.” Luo Yue shook her head.

“Then what’s the use of that, did we come here for nothing?” Lin Xiu was unhappy about the worthlessness of the item.

He felt that if he was able to absorb the powerful energy inside like absorbing an odd crystal…

“Everyone quick! Over here!” Right then, shouts could be heard from the buildings where they had just come from.

Lin Xiu turned to discover a few Sacred Region Academy students walking over.

“Damn, people actually arrived here a step ahead of us.” The leader saw and was slightly surprised.

“North Campus class 2?” Zhang Yin and Jiang Li noticed the insignia on their clothes and said.

The five ignored Lin Xiu’s team and walked ahead and saw the Red Lotus Fire brimming with energy and their eyes were filled with joy.

“There’s actually a treasure!” The young man’s eyes lit up.

“Li Mo, Hua Ming, prepare the tools, we are taking this away!” As per his orders, the two guys beside him started rummaging their bags and took out a few tools.

One was a unique box and the other took out a few unique trowels.

“Wait, we found this first.” Lin Xiu noticed their actions and frowned and blocked their front.

The young man who gave the orders sized Lin Xiu up then looked at the insignia on his robes and laughed, “South campus class 10? You can’t take this and even if you could, it’s useless for you.”

“And you can’t even grab it.”

“Whether or not it is of worth to us is not your problem, but if you’re insisting on being this way, we can consider you trying to snatch it?” Lin Xiu asked coldly.

“Hahaha!” The guy laughed out loud when he heard Lin Xiu.

“Yeah, I want to snatch it, what can you do?” The young man stopped laughing and stared at Lin Xiu.

The atmosphere became extremely serious suddenly.

“Then we’ll just kill you.” Luo Yue spoke up and instantly charged towards the young man.

His pupils constricted as he raised his two short blades and blocked her attack.

Clank-

“Get rid of them!!!” The young man was infuriated by Luo Yue’s sudden attack and roared.

“Your granddaddy!” Jiang Li and Li Ping raised their sabers and charged. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

They were annoyed as well, they got to this place with much difficulty and the enemies wanted to snatch the treasure.

Clank clank clank-

Luo Yue moved extremely quickly and unleashed many attacks at her opponent.

After a few clashes, a loud sound came out.

Lin Xiu held Dark Edge and stabbed forward!

Aside from her opponent that used two short blades, the other four wielded broad sabers.

They were all rank 4 warriors, causing Zhang Yin and the others to be under a great deal of pressure. Lin Xiu faced 2 opponents and was able to alleviate their stress slightly.

“You’re Luo Yue?” Luo Yue’s opponent asked through gritted teeth.

She was simply too powerful and there was only one lady that could helm such strength in Sacred Region Academy, Luo Yue who was on the ranking list!

‘Why is she in south campus class 10!?’

“You talk too much.” Luo Yue’s expression did not change as she stabbed forward with sword in hand and replied indifferently.

Her sword arts were extremely sharp and made him feel a great deal of pressure.

After a few clashes, his hand became numb.

‘Damn it, how did she even train herself, why is she such a pain in the ass!!!!’

Lin Xiu felt the pressure while against two rank 4 warriors.

In between their attacks, Lin Xiu suddenly stabbed at one of his opponents!

His spear immediately transformed into 10 afterimages!

The guy became frightened.

He immediately used his skill in an attempt to block the attacks.

Clank clank clank-

Under the ferocious spear attack, his weapon had many dents.

“Damn…” Li Ping was careless and got cut on his arm. His battle robes immediately split apart and blood flowed out.

Zhang Yin and Jiang Li also sustained injuries on their bodies.

The gap was only 1 rank but the strength difference was too great. They were forced to a passive defensive state and were almost killed.

But they had no other choice and focused on defending. If they relaxed, they were bound to die!

Gulu-

Right at this time, no one noticed many large creatures on the walls of the buildings that remained stationary.

But because of their battles, the creatures slowly started to move.

“Go and die!!!” One of the opponents revealed a sinister smile and looked at Zhang Yin, who was gasping for breath with an injured arm. He held his saber with both hands and leaped forward!

He wanted to slice Zhang Yin into two!

“Gulu”

But right at this time, the strange sound came out and the warrior that was in the air suddenly felt a looming figure above him.

It was as though something had suddenly charged down from above him.

‘What the hell is that..!?’
