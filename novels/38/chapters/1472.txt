“Go!!!!”

Lin Xiu roared in rage as he saw what had happened.

Then, he raised his long spear and spun it in the air once again.

Boom boom – —

Countless flaming birds rushed out of the spear.

All of them went straight to the flaming phoenix, hoping to make the phoenix stronger.

However, even with the additional support, the energy released by Sky Eye seemed to be much more powerful than the ones that Lin Xiu has released. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

The next moment, the phoenix looked like it was about to break apart.

The phoenix started getting closer to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s eyes were opened wide. These flames were already much stronger than when he first released them.

Boom – –

Then, the phoenix that was released was pushed backwards and it went straight toward Lin Xiu.

A huge explosion occurred.

All of the grounds within the hundred miles were all destroyed.

There were cracks everywhere on the ground.

The entire scene was heartbreaking.

At the same time, back in Warrior God Realm.

“Huh? Luo Yue?!”

Luo Yue had just gotten teleported to an area right before Lingxian City and she heard someone calling her.

Luo Yue turned around subconsciously and saw that it was Baili Haoling.

Rollie and Little Bai were sitting on her shoulders.

Both of them were badly injured from the previous fight.

Fortunately, Baili Haoling found them on the way back.

“Where’s Lin Xiu?”

“He has been looking for you. So I guess he has found you?”

Baili Haoling laughed joyfully.

She had left Lingxian City for some time for cultivation and had only returned.

“He’s in a fight.”

Luo Yue answered.

“A fight? Where?”

Baili Haoling’s eyes lit up with excitement after hearing what Luo Yue said and started looking around her.

She loved being in a fight.

She enjoyed the moment while she was in a battle.

However, no matter where she looked, she couldn’t see any fight going on.

“On earth.”

As Luo Yue spoke, she drew a circle with her right arm. Then, there was a screen that slowly appeared in the air.

This allowed them to clearly see what was happening on earth.

This had been a secret skill that she had learned previously.

She never thought that there would ever be a day that this would be useful.

“Where is this place?!”

Baili Haoling was shocked to see the scene before her eyes.

Lin Xiu was fighting a huge giant!

The giant had split the sky open but they could only see half of its body.

There was also a large amount of energy seen on the ground.

Lin Xiu was surrounded by flames and they could no longer see his figure!

Luo Yue then started trembling.

However, she had to quickly calm herself.

She had to believe that Lin Xiu would not be so easily defeated.

If she went back now, it would be a suicide mission.

She wouldn’t be able to help Lin Xiu and would even distract him.

“This is earth.”

Luo Yue gave a simple reply.

“Earth? That’s impossible!”

Baili Haoling was shocked.

That place seemed to be completely destroyed. There were cracks and dents everywhere. It wasn’t a place where there would be civilization.

“Yes.”

“That’s impossible!”

Baili Haoling shouted.

“That cannot be earth!”

She could not believe her eyes.

Her hands were tightly clenched together as well.

Her nails dug into her palm.

If this was earth…. Doesn’t it mean that the entire planet has been destroyed.

Her grandfather….. And the rest of her family? Were they all dead?

As she thought about it and calmed down, everything soon made sense.

Afterall, Luo Yue wouldn’t lie to her.

“I want to go back.” Baili Haoling spoke as her eyes turned red.

“You will get yourself killed if you go back now.”

Suddenly, Pang Tong appeared.

“That’s Sky Eye. He’s the strongest being in the Warrior God Realm.”

Pang Tong explained it to Baili Haoling in a serious tone.

Sky Eye was indeed the strongest in the entire Warrior God Realm.

Most warriors in the Warrior God Realm may know the strongest warrior gods but none of them would have heard of Sky Eye.

This was because he doesn’t stay in the Warrior God Realm. He travels around the galaxy to hunt for more powerful energy.

Only a small number of God Kings are aware of him.

“No matter how great he is, he’s merely a God King!”

“Send me back!”

Baili Haoling’s eyes were bloody red and she released the energy in her body.

A storm was immediately whipped up because of it.

She knew that Pang Tong was in charge of the teleportation device.

He would be able to send her back with the device.

“He is not a God King.”

Pang Tong shook his head.

“What do you mean?”

Baili Haoling furrowed her brows as she was already filled with rage.

“Back then, it was the True God who built the Warrior God Realm.

“He was the God and Sky Eye was merely one of his servant.

“However, as soon as True God disappeared, this man started taking over him.

“With all the energy that he had engulfed all these years, his abilities are very close to the True God.”

Pang Tong was familiar with this.

True God?

How powerful would that be?

Baili Haoling still didn’t quite understand.

“Stay calm. If you go over there now, you will get yourself killed.”

Suddenly, another voice appeared in the air.

“God King!”

Pang Tong looked up and greeted the man respectfully.

It was none other than Tianling God King and Riyan God Lord!

Both of them then slowly got to the ground.

“Lin Xiu has received the inheritance of the True God and he may not lose to Sky Eye. Plus, I also heard that Lin Xiu has the overpowering skill of reversing time. As long as he wins this fight, he will make everything go back to normal.”

“But, if you go there now, you will die immediately.”

Tianling God King then gave his warning.

Most God Kings already knew about the inheritance.

Huangfu Yuanshen was the one who spread the news. He wanted to gather more God Kings to fight for him so that he could get the inheritance for himself.

“But…”

Baili Haoling finally calmed down but she still looked anxious.

This Sky Eye must be someone powerful but would Lin Xiu be able to kill this man?
