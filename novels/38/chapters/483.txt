Chapter 484: Arriving In Bai Di City

There were still a lot of zombies at the bottom. In this situation, it was really necessary to leave quickly.

Otherwise, if there was another wave of zombies, things would be troublesome.

“Everyone, get on the spacecraft.” Teacher Zhang said aloud at this time.

When those students heard Teacher Zhang’s words, they all walked up into the spacecraft in an orderly manner.

After all, there was no more threat from zombies and these people were not as nervous and afraid as they were just now.

“Let’s go too.” Lin Xiu watched this scene and said to Ye Shuang’er.

“En!” Ye Shuang’er nodded.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue glanced at each other, as if they knew what was each other’s thoughts and headed straight into the spacecraft.

Although this spacecraft was relatively small, it was still large enough to accommodate these people.

Soon, after everyone got on the spacecraft, the spacecraft took off directly.

As soon as the spacecraft took off, Lin Xiu could clearly see other military planes flying in the sky from the windows of the spacecraft.

“The Federal Army is finally dispatched.” Teacher Zhang was surprised when he saw this scene.

After all, with the situation in Xing Yao City now, if the Federal army still didn’t come, the entire city would probably become unlivable.

Lin Xiu, Luo Yue and Ye Shuang’er all sat on the seats on the spacecraft.

The spacecraft was already very crowded and the students gave these places to them.

“Brother Lin Xiu, Sister Luo is really not your girlfriend?” Ye Shuang’er whispered to Lin Xiu, who was next to her.

She looked at Luo Yue, who was sitting on the other side closing the curtain, and said aloud.

Luo Yue was indeed too beautiful and her face looked as if she was carefully crafted.

She wasn’t the same as Ye Shuang’er’s who was cute.

“Not… Not really?” Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment, then whispered in Ye Shuang’er’s ear.

“I can see that Sister Luo Yue seems to like you too.” Ye Shuang’er leaned close to Lin Xiu’s ear, then whispered.

“Really.” Lin Xiu pretended to be indifferent, but in his heart, he was a little bit happy.

“Go after her boldly!” Ye Shuang’er patted Lin Xiu’s shoulder and said.

Although she has a special feeling toward Lin Xiu in her heart, if Lin Xiu can be happy, she will be very happy too.

At this time, the spacecraft was still flying in the direction of Bai Di City and the other students looked a little more relaxed at this time because they had passed the horrible moment.

“We’re here!” About half an hour later, someone exclaimed.

Lin Xiu, who was leaning against the window, looked outside and he could see a city in the distance.

There were a lot of tall buildings in this city and it seemed larger than Xing Yao City, it was like a city from science fiction.

Around the whole city, there were many flying vehicles hovering around.

“Seems like other cities have suffered too…” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but mutter as he looked at the flying vehicles that were constantly flying towards Bai Di City.

This sudden melting of the glacier was a disaster for many cities.

These floods were not terrible, the terrible things were the zombies.

Because the warriors in those cities were obviously relatively low-ranking, there was no way to deal with so many zombies.

And if those ordinary laser guns didn’t aim at the heads of those zombies precisely, those zombies wouldn’t die at all.

“It was said that Ming Le City has been destroyed.” Ye Shuang’er heard Lin Xiu muttering to himself and said. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“No way?” Lin Xiu was startled. Although it was a small city, it’s gone just like that?

“A lot of evolved beasts rushed there with the flood and those evolved beasts destroyed the entire city.” Ye Shuang’er nodded, then took out her mobile phone, showing this morning’s news.

Those huge evolved beasts destroyed the entire city.

Lin Xiu frowned as he looked at the scene displayed on the phone.

He always felt that the world now seemed to become more dangerous.

Because of the wars of the last century, there were many regions in the world that were very dangerous. Some terrifying evolved beasts may still be somewhere and have not awakened.

Once awakened, it would be terrifying.

“By the way, uncle and auntie are fine, right?” Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something at this moment, then said to Ye Shuang’er.

“They’re okay, they were rescued by the federal government’s search and rescue team this morning.” Ye Shuang’er smiled and said, then clicked on the message on her mobile phone to show Lin Xiu.

“That’s good.” Lin Xiu nodded.

Boom boom——

At this moment, the entire hull of the spacecraft began to vibrate slightly.

Taking a closer look, they had reached the upper part of Bai Di City.

Some small spacecrafts on patrol scanned the spacecraft that Lin Xiu and the others were in and allowed it to land below.

“Finally!”

Some students were excited when they saw Bai Di City.

What happened today was like a nightmare to them.

It was too scary and bloody.

Some students were torn into pieces by those zombies on the spot. The students who saw this scene clearly looked unwell.

“After the descent, everyone, pay attention, don’t squeeze. Our Bei Dou Academy camp is on the west side, I have gotten the address so just follow us later.” Teacher Zhang stood in the middle at this time and said loudly.

“Great!”

The students nodded when they heard Teacher Zhang’s words.

Boom–

There was a dull sound and the spacecraft finally landed on the ground as the hatch began to open slowly.

As the hatch opened, a dazzling light shone in.

“We’re safe.” Teacher Zhang looked at the scene outside and heaved a sigh of relief.

If a large number of students die, it would be very stressful for him.

Although there were casualties, this was really not within his control.

“Seniors, thank you.” Just when Lin Xiu, Luo Yue and Ye Shuang’er got off the spacecraft, the soldiers said to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue respectfully.

Seniors?

Lin Xiu was a little bit dumbfounded. They were all in their twenties and it was a bit strange to call a 17 or 18-year-old senior.

But Lin Xiu also understood that it was probably because of the strength displayed by himself and Luo Yue.

“Hurry up! Call the medical staff over!!!”
