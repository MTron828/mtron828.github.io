Chapter 145: Plundering Admission Notices

Clang clang clang-

Following a series of collisions, people that wanted to attack Luo Yue had their weapons flung away.

Siiilaaa-

Luo Yue quickly ripped their admission notices from their bodies.

With her own, she got two others and was considered a pass.

She looked at Lin Xiu who hinted for her to go, she threw the remaining few to Lei Lei’s side.

Rumble rumble-

At the same time, a gigantic airship rose from the precipice.

A flight of stairs descended down onto the grass.

“Those that passed can come in.” Sima Cheng stood there and said.

Just as he said that, a guy and a girl appeared before him.

“Oh? Seems like the two of you are really fast.” Sima Cheng looked at them in slight surprise.

“Luo Yue, it’s been long.” After handing over three admission notices to Sima Cheng, he turned and smiled towards Luo Yue.

The guy was tall and had long silver hair. He was extremely handsome.

Zhuo Qixing, ranked 1 of Sky Academy!

Luo Yue ignored him and handed her admission notices to Sima Cheng.

“Alright, the two of you can board.” Sima Cheng nodded his head.

He sighed inwardly as he looked at Zhuo Qixing and Luo Yue. This new batch of students seems strong.

“Seems like you still dislike talking. Alright, I’ll see you again in Sacred Region Academy.” Zhuo Qixing shook his head, laughed, and boarded the airship.

“Luo Yue, you can head up too.” Sima Cheng turned and told her.

Luo Yue glanced behind her and replied indifferently, “Waiting for a friend.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Lei Lei had taken the three admission notices Luo Yue had thrown to her, her face filled with joy since she had a surplus.

“Damn!” Zhang Yin gasped as he struck a guy away and plundered his admission notice.

“Zhang Yin, it’s enough!” Lei Lei walked over to him and announced happily.

“This…” Zhang Yin was surprised when he saw her admission notices.

“Luo Yue gave them to me.” Lei Lei immediately explained.

“Alright, keep them well. Let’s help Jiang Li get two more!” Zhang Yin nodded and said.

“Seems like you guys got some admission notices for yourselves!” Just then, a few warriors carrying weapons walked over and started to attack Lei Lei and Zhang Yin.

After taking a careful look at them, they were Kong Haotian and his lackeys.

“It wasn’t easy for you to come here, but you can… go back now!” As Kong Haotian bellowed, his five lackeys charged towards Zhang Yin and Lei Lei!

Danger!

Zhang Yin panicked, he did not expect Kong Haotian’s group to eye on them right from the beginning.

Right as he was about to activate his skill and attack Kong Haotian, blazing birds swept down towards them!

Kong Haotian and his lackeys went from charging towards Zhang Yin and Lei Lei to a full retreat.

Right when they retreated, a figure swept past them from the side.

Sssiilaa-

Ripping sounds could be heard and they discovered that their admission notices had been plundered!

“Why’re you still standing there?!” Lin Xiu called out to Zhang Yin and his group.

Without a Trace was extremely powerful not in its ability to dodge, but in the speed it provided.

He felt as light as a swallow!

Upon hearing his words, Zhang Yin and the group started running.

“Take this!” Lin Xiu waved his right hand and two admission notices flew into Jiang Li’s hands.

“Thanks!” Jiang Li was emotional. With his own strength, plundering two other admission notices would be difficult.

They ran towards Sima Cheng.

“Kill him!!!” Kong Haotian was infuriated and roared at Lin Xiu.

With his words, the five lackeys ran towards Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu sneered, he was not afraid or panicked at all.

Free experience points had sent themselves to the door.

He held Dark Edge and launched his own attack!

With his recovered strength and absorbing all the energy from so many odd crystals, Lin Xiu’s current strength could be said to have increased by another notch!

Zheng Zheng Zheng-

As Lin Xiu’s battle intent soared, Dark Edge seemed to tremble in excitement and released a soft buzz.

As the first warrior in the group tried to attack Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu caught a glimpse of a light spot in his trajectory.

Lin Xiu already realized that every time he attacked the light spot that was the opponent’s flaw, he would unleash Profound Intent Torrential storm of rose flowers!

Go and die!

Lin Xiu thrust the Dark Edge spear forward and the man immediately sensed danger, but it was too late to dodge!

He could only take the blows!

Bang bang bang-

As he drew his large saber to block the attack, he saw many cold beams of light in front of him!

There were so many attacks he could not block the mall!

His body was immediately riddled with holes in the next second and with a small ‘explosion’, his entire body erupted.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing a rank 3 warrior, obtaining 500,000 experience points!”

500,000 is too little.

But Lin Xiu’s attack scared Kong Haotian and the other lackeys. It was too terrifying to kill a rank 3 warrior with one hit, right?!

Lin Xiu did not stop as he brandished Dark Edge.

Rumble rumble-

He unleashed many blazing birds that flew straight for Kong Haotian and company.

They immediately dodged upon sensing the heat from the blazing birds.

Lin Xiu was extremely fast and with Analytic Eye, he could see that the warrior at the most left was the weakest.

He pushed his spear out at him!

Clang0

The warrior was also a spear user and blocked Lin Xiu’s attack.

The collision of two spears produced sparks.

“You think you’re better than me with the spear?!” The man roared and continued to struggle against Lin Xiu with his spear.

“Quick drive stab!!!”

As he utilized a skill, multiple airstreams surrounded his spear as he aimed straight towards Lin Xiu’s chest!
