Chapter 292: Parting

“Hmm, almost done.” Lin Xiu nodded and scanned the surroundings. The ground around this place was covered with Black Tooth Spiders’ corpses, and there were no longer any live spiders that were still climbing up.

Lin Xiu still thought that it was quite a pity. Due to their fear of flames, he could kill these Black Tooth Spiders very quickly.

And they were also worth a lot of experience. If there were more for Lin Xiu to kill, he would definitely gain more experience.

Bang bang bang——

And that mutated Black Tooth Spider was still struggling because it was trapped in the box that Guo Ling used and some noises were heard from time to time.

Now there was a strong smell of blood everywhere, which made one feel very uncomfortable.

“Let’s go.” Guo Ling put the box into her backpack, then glanced at the crowd and said.

The quality of this box was very sturdy. It was impossible for this small mutated Black Tooth Spider to break free from this box, so Guo Ling put it in her backpack without any worry.

At this time, everyone packed up their things and took the lighting equipment, then walked to the other side.

After all, there was too much blood in this place which made them feel very uncomfortable.

Lin Xiu didn’t feel anything when he was fighting, but now that he stopped fighting, he suddenly felt a sense of exhaustion all over his body.

Tired, really tired.

As he used his skill to kill those Black Tooth Spiders, Lin Xiu now felt that the source strength in his whole body was drained.

Just as Lin Xiu and Guo Ling and the others were moving forward and wanted to find a place to take a good night’s rest, Lin Xiu heard a unique noise behind him.

“Rollie?” Lin Xiu turned around and suddenly saw Rollie, not knowing when he appeared behind him.

When Lin Xiu spoke, he carefully looked at Guo Ling and the others who were walking in front.

They were now observing their surroundings warily and didn’t seem to notice the situation here, which made Lin Xiu relieved.

After all, Rollie was a very strange creature, even Lin Xiu didn’t know what it was.

When he was fighting, he didn’t have a choice but to throw Rollie out to kill the two warriors, but he didn’t want them to see the existence of Rollie right now.

At this moment, he took a closer look and Rollie looked like he was gnawing on an Odd crystal in its hands.

Lin Xiu was taken aback. At this moment, he could sense that his backpack seemed to have become heavier.

‘It can’t be…’

Lin Xiu was a little surprised. He instinctively looked into his backpack and found that it was filled with Odd crystals!

These Odd crystals were black and resplendent, they looked quite small too but there were many of them. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

There were so many that it was a little scary.

He didn’t know how many Black Tooth Spiders he just killed, but he didn’t think of collecting their Odd crystals.

After all, there were so many and it was very cumbersome to dig out the Odd crystals from the corpse of every Black Tooth Spider.

But he didn’t expect that Rollie had already helped him to dig out almost all the crystals of the Black Tooth Spider and put them all in his backpack.

“Let’s rest here tonight.”

After walking for some time, they reached an area near the water source.

Lin Xiu nodded. There were many rocks around him and he sat next to one, then rested with his back against the rock.

He was really exhausted after a whole day of fighting.

Not only Lin Xiu, Guo Ling, and the others were the same as well.

“I’m exhausted, I’ll go to bed first.” Qiu Li laid directly on the rock behind him, then yawned and said aloud.

The injury on his arm wouldn’t heal so easily and because of the blood loss, he wanted to go to bed earlier.

“You guys have a rest, I’ll watch the night tonight.” Guo Ling nodded and said to everyone.

“Are you okay?” Lin Xiu subconsciously said when he saw that Guo Ling seemed to be in good spirits.

“No problem, you should be tired after fighting for an entire day.” Guo Ling nodded.

She did not look tired at all.

Lin Xiu was not pretentious and he closed his eyes directly then leaned on the rock behind him, slowly falling into a deep sleep.

He was really exhausted today.

After some time, Lin Xiu, who has a good body clock, opened his eyes at this time and felt the dazzling sun shining on his eyes.

“You’re awake?” Lin Xiu’s eyes just got used to the sunlight when he heard a familiar voice.

The blurry sight also slowly became clear at this time.

Taking a closer look, Guo Ling and the others seemed to have woken up and were packing their things.

“You guys woke up so early?” Lin Xiu said a little surprised.

Seems like he was a bit too tired last night. They woke up earlier than him and he didn’t even notice it.

“Hmm, you looked really tired, so we didn’t wake you up.” Guo Ling nodded, then chuckled.

When dealing with the Black Tooth Spiders yesterday, Lin Xiu did the most and even killed those warriors. Now he looked extremely tired and Guo Ling couldn’t bear to wake him up.

Click, click, click——

Lin Xiu stretched and suddenly there were sounds of his joints cracking.

After taking a rest for the whole night, Lin Xiu had regained his strength and the fatigue from his body was gone, making him feel very comfortable.

“Let’s go, we’re going back now.” Guo Ling looked at the people around him and when she saw that they were all ready, she said aloud.

“Going back already?” Lin Xiu was startled and instinctively said.

“Yes, we have already caught the living body of the mutated Black Tooth Spider and now we can go back to hand in the mission.” Guo Ling smiled, then nodded and said.

She knew before that this task was definitely not easy and they would encounter a lot of problems along the way.

So she prepared many days’ worth of nourishment liquid and was ready to fight for a long time.

But what she didn’t expect was that they caught the mutated Black Tooth Spider in just two days after they had just arrived in the Dark Forest!

It went very well.

This was definitely a very big surprise for her.
