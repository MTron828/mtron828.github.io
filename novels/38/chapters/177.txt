Chapter 178: Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist

‘What skill is this!?’

Jiang Ya opened his eyes wide as he prepared his sword with the intention to block the attacks. He felt more than 10 strikes on his sword in the second and the powerful blows caused his sword to fly out of his hand!

“Scram!”

The instant his weapon was thrown off, Lin Xiu used his left hand and performed a punch!

Crackle-

A large burst of electric currents appeared on Lin Xiu’s fist. It looked as though his fist had been wrapped by lightning and produced a silver light.

Bang-

Jiang Ya could not retaliate at that moment without a weapon.

He was hit directly in the abdomen by Lin Xiu’s Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist. Lightning charged throughout his entire body as he was flung out like a kite and smashed heavily onto a wall behind.

Jiang Ya’s entire body trembled as an immense pain shot through his body and prevented him from moving. He fell to the ground and spat out a mouthful of blood.

On the other side, Luo Yue battled against the other 2 rank 4 warriors with ease and even became increasingly brazen, causing the two to frown.

Cold sweat started trickling down their foreheads.

They had never seen such a powerful female warrior before, and even more importantly, she was beyond beautiful.

‘How in the world did she train?!’

Clank clank-

Suddenly, the sword in Luo Yue’s hand unleashed white auras that erupted with terrifying force.

The two rank 4 warriors wanted to block but upon collision, the immense power forced the two to fly backwards.

“I will kill you if you move another inch.”

Upon hearing her cold words and looking at the sword pointed at them, the two guys froze.

They believed that the lady in front of them would really kill them

They both stood their ground and did not dare move an inch.

They turned to look at Lin Xiu to see their captain on the floor and spasming endlessly.

‘How did it turn out like that?!’

They were overwhelmed with shock. One must know that Jiang Ya was extremely powerful and considered in the mid-tiers of rank 4 warriors, close to peak rank 4.

He was actually beaten up in such a short time by that seemingly weak boy?

“Go and die!” On the other hand, the fight between Zhang Yin’s group and the other two rank 4 warriors was extremely difficult.

After all, they were rank 3 warriors and were different from the rank 4 warriors.

One of the rank 4 warriors roared and held his giant hammer tightly as he smashed towards Li Ping!

‘It’s over!’

Li Ping’s eyes grew wide, he wanted to move but his body could not keep up!

His entire existence would most probably turn into a pulp once hit by the giant hammer!

Clank-

At that critical moment, Sun Wuhai’s giant hammer collided with something and was actually pushed back. The powerful force caused his hands to turn numb as his hammer was flung out of his hand!

Bang-

The gigantic hammer smashed onto the ground and produced a large pit.

“I’ll let you have a taste of my Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist as well!!!” Lin Xiu had just used his spear to block the hammer and sent it flying.

He then used a fist to smash right onto Sun Wuhai’s body!

“Seeking death!” Sun Wuhai was infuriated at the loss of his weapon and sent his own fist towards Lin Xiu!

“Vacuum Punch!!!”

He roared out loud and his fist seemed to explode into the air.

Once their fists met, a loud explosion occurred and he felt as though his entire arm had collided onto a sports car and even ripped apart!

Electric currents flooded his entire body and caused his eyes to turn over.

‘How did that happen?!’

The other warrior was stunned and when he regained himself, two sabers were already at his neck.

“Class monitor, thanks…” Li Ping seemed to be drained of all his energy as he sat on the ground completely drenched in his own perspiration.

If not for Lin Xiu’s timely intervention, Li Ping would have turned into mince meat.

“Just like Professor Yang.” Lin Xiu looked at SUn Wuhai whose body was still crackling with electric currents and spasming about.

“Who is Professor Yang?” Zhang Yin asked curiously.

“Yang Yongxin, an electric king back in my hometown who uses electric skills to deal against students.” Lin Xiu explained.

“Electric skills, so powerful…”

Gugugu-

Just then, Lin Xiu heard a familiar sound.

He turned to see Rollie on his shoulder and holding onto a gold odd crystal.

“You dug it out?” Lin Xiu exclaimed out happily.

It was undoubtedly the rank 5 golden back wild bull’s odd crystal. Unknown to him, Rollie had run out of his pocket to dig out the crystal. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It jumped about happily on his shoulder.

“Powerful.” Lin Xiu complimented: “Put it in my bag.”

Rollie truly understood Lin Xiu’s words and went back into his bag.

“We….we were wrong, please let us go.” The man who had Jiang Li and Zhang Yin’s sabers at his neck trembled and begged.

He was truly afraid, he was still able to see his companion lying on the floor with his rotten arm and spasming as electric currents ran all over his body.

“We are all students of Sacred Region Academy, you can’t kill us!” The two guys who were held hostage by Luo Yue spoke out loud.

“If the teachers find out, you guys are dead!”

They did not expect that a team from south campus Class 10 would actually be so strong?!

It had exceeded their expectations.

“Then we need to see if you guys are worth keeping, take out things to trade for your lives, otherwise….”

“Die!”
