Chapter 222: If You Want To Fight, I Will Fight

Lin Xiu looked at Nan Zhengjun and said aloud.

“You guys didn’t come in last?” Nan Zhengjun was taken aback. Although there was Luo Yue from Class 1 who transferred over and there was also Lin Xiu who was relatively good, Zhang Yin, Li Ping, and Jiang Li were really quite average in strength.

Having this kind of combination in the team, it was already pretty good that they were able to come back alive from the G17 Ruin.

And he also received news just now that the death toll reached more than 40 people this time.

It was one of the highest death tolls. He heard that a rank 8 evolved beast actually appeared over there.

Ranking and whatnot, he really didn’t expect them to achieve any place.

“Teacher Nan, do you think we will be at the bottom?” Lin Xiu raised his brows at this moment and asked.

Zhang Yin and the others laughed when they saw Nan Zhengjun’s expression.

Nan Zhengjun was startled, then smiled, “Let me guess, are you guys in the tenth place?”

Judging the expressions of Lin Xiu and the others, he knew that they must have done well.

“No.” Lin Xiu shook his head.

“Are you guys in the top ten?!” Nan Zhengjun said with a little excitement. There were 20 classes and if they could make it into the top ten, it would be considered very remarkable.

“Guess boldly.” Lin Xiu shook his head, but the corner of my mouth curled up and said.

‘Guess boldly?’

Nan Zhengjun was taken aback at this time and he gasped, his voice trembling a little as he said, “Are you guys in the top five?”

If they got into the top five, the class would not only have a lot of rewards but this Class 10 of the South Campus would also be well-known throughout the entire Sacred Region Academy!

After all, for so many years, no one in the tenth class could get into the top ten, almost all of them were at the bottom.

Lin Xiu raised a finger at this time.

“First place.”

“First place!!!”

As soon as these two words came out of Lin Xiu’s mouth, Nan Zhengjun’s eyes widened.

He seemed so shocked that he stood rooted to the ground.

First place!?

Nan Zhengjun had never expected to hear those simple two words.

Ever since he took on Class 10, he never thought that the class he led could get a place in the top ten.

After all, the students were divided into classes according to their combat strength. People in Class 10 have the lowest combat strength. Even the strongest students in the class couldn’t be compared with anyone in the other classes ah!

“But it’s just a tie, the damn South Campus actually had the same score as us!” Li Ping said grudgingly.

“Good! Good! Good!!!” Nan Zhengjun came to his senses and was grinning from ear to ear.

First place ah!

Even if it was a tie, they were still in the first place!

Class 10 of the South Campus actually won first place. This year’s freshmen assembly would probably be recorded in the history of the Sacred Domain College.

Because this was something that has never happened before!

At this time, there was a blast of noise from the front, as if urging them to gather at the field.

“Let’s go there first!” Nan Zhengjun said aloud.

Just like a week before the freshmen assembly, they were grouped neatly on the field according to their classes.

“Class monitor! We got the sixteenth place!” As Lin Xiu and the others returned, some students in the class said excitedly to Lin Xiu.

They seem to be a little battered now and had probably just returned from fighting over there.

“Not bad.” Lin Xiu smiled and nodded.

Soon, a school leader began to speak eloquently on the platform and after about fifteen minutes, Dean Baili went up on the platform.

“In the first place of those who went to the Emerald Forest- Class 1 of the North Campus!”

At this time, following the announcement, the people in Class 1 of the North Campus burst into loud cheers. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Class 1 of the North Campus, each person will get 50,000 points and an extra gold skill card!!!”

“Second place, Class 1 of the South Campus, each person will get 40,000 points and an additional gold skill card.”

“The third place…”

At this time, as Dean Baili announced the results, some of the classes cheered and those classes that didn’t win looked really unhappy.

“Class 10 of the South Campus, sixteenth place, each student gets 10,000 points!”

“Whoo!!!”

At this time, when they read the name of their class, the people in Class 10 of the South Campus were all excited.

The faces of the four classes behind Class 10 of the South Campus turned ugly – the class that was supposed to be at the bottom wasn’t at the bottom!

“Next, it’s the results for those who went to the G17 Ruin.” Baili Yard said with a smile.

He opened the results on the screen projected in the air and revealed a look of surprise.

“In this year’s freshman assembly, it seems that there are many amazing people appearing.”

“The first place, Class 1 of the South Campus!”

Hearing this, everyone in Class 1 of the South Campus cheered.

But before they could rejoice any longer, Dean Baili continued to say, “And also Class 10 of the South Campus.”

Class 10 of the South Campus!?

As soon as his words came out, everyone around was stunned.

The whole place became silent in an instant.

“This is impossible! How could Class 10 of the South Campus be the first?” Some people were shocked at this time.

It didn’t matter if the Class 10 of the South Campus had just won the sixteenth place, it might be that some of the classes were careless.

But now, Class 10 of the South Campus has won first place!

How could they not be shocked?

After all, this wasn’t the top 20 or top 10, this was first place ah!

“En, there is nothing wrong with the results. Class 10 of the South Campus is indeed tied for first place with Class 1 of the South Campus.” Dean Baili touched his long white beard and said with a smile.

When the rest of the people on the level heard the words of Dean Baili, their faces became nasty at this time.

“As for the reward, we only prepared for one team to receive it so this is a bit of a headache.” Dean Baili patted his head and said aloud.

“Then let’s continue to decide who is in the first place!” Zhuo Qixing said, standing in front of his class.

“Oh? Does this student have any thoughts?” Dean Baili saw Zhuo Qixing stepping out and Dean Baili touched his beard at this time, then said with a smile.

“I want to fight with the people of Class 10 of the South Campus, and only the winner is the real number one!” Zhuo Qixing glanced in the direction of Class 10 of the South Campus and said in a cold voice.

“Yes! Otherwise, who knows whether someone used some tricks to get first place!”

At this time, everyone started jeering.

After all, the gold content of getting first place for G17 Ruin was far better than the ranking from the Emerald Forest.

They refused to accept the fact that Class 10 of the South Campus got first place!

“Bullies!!!” Some people from Class 10 of the South Campus were a little stirred up at this time. After all, the combat strength of Class 10 and Class 1 was too far apart.

“If you want to fight, I will fight.” Lin Xiu stepped out at this time, then looked forward and said indifferently.
