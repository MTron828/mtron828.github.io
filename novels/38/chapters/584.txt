Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

What is this sound?

Hearing this voice, Lin Xiu frowned.

His eyes looked around, but he didn’t find the figure of the evolved beast.

However, with the experience of the previous two levels, Lin Xiu did not dare to relax now. The previous two levels were so difficult, and this one would definitely not be easy. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

At this moment, another strange sound rang out again.

What the hell is it!?

The surrounding environment was very dark, there were no weeds on the ground, and there were only those black trees around.

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

At the next moment, with another strange sound, Lin Xiu turned around abruptly and looked behind him, and found that a lot of cold light flashed.

Lin Xiu’s reaction ability was very fast, and at this time, he quickly waved his Dark Edge spear to block.

Dangdang-

As if hitting something, it sounded like a metal collision.

Taking a closer look, he saw that the branch of the black tree in front of me actually had a huge black ‘fruit’.

The ‘fruit’ split from the middle at this time, and there were sharp seeds in it, and then stabbed at Lin Xiu!

Whoosh whoosh—

Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly, and then quickly dodged.

bang bang bang-

These bullet-like seeds were all shot on the ground at this time.

There were also many holes in the ground.

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

And it wasn’t over yet. The other black trees seemed to be moving, and at this time, Lin Xiu was surrounded by them.

And at the next moment, those ‘fruits’ also appeared on these black trees.

As these ‘fruits’ split into two halves, in the next moment, there were a lot of bullet-like things, and they frantically shot at Lin Xiu’s body!

Damn it!

At this time, Lin Xiu was still dodging constantly, waving his Dark Edge spear to block these things.

Boom–

Accidentally, Lin Xiu seemed to have been shot in the arm and suddenly felt a sharp pain.

This thing was kind of scary.

But now there were those black trees in all directions, all surrounding Lin Xiu’s body, there was no way to escape.

When Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand to block the surrounding attacks, he suddenly felt something wrapped around his body. He was surrounded by those black branches, which bound Lin Xiu’s body to death in the air.

Oh no!

Lin Xiu found that his body was tightly bound, and he looked around, the seeds in those ‘fruits’ were still shooting towards him!

He was bound by the branches of this black tree, and now Lin Xiu’s body can’t even move!

bang bang bang-

Those ‘seeds’ shot on Lin Xiu’s body, causing Lin Xiu to feel intense pain.

However, Lin Xiu’s body has been tempered, and the power of his physical body was also very powerful. These things only broke through Lin Xiu’s skin, but they could not shoot into Lin Xiu’s body.

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

A strange sound, the same as just now, sounded again at this time.

The branches of the surrounding black trees spread like vines towards Lin Xiu.

It wrapped Lin Xiu’s body in the air once again.

A large number of branches were twisting wildly as if they were going to strangle Lin Xiu.

Boom—

But in the next moment, a red light burst out from the gaps in the branches, and the branches that wrapped Lin Xiu’s whole body completely broke in the next moment.

A lot of flames erupted.

The branches of those black trees were just covered by those flames, and in the next moment, they all burned in an instant.

The black trees that originally surrounded Lin Xiu all burned at this time.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly while holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, then waved the spear, and a large amount of flame burst out again.

Sure enough, as Lin Xiu thought, these black trees were afraid of flames. As Lin Xiu frantically waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he released the ‘Awe of the Phoenix’ skill.

A large number of flaming birds swept the entire place.

But what surprised Lin Xiu was that after the branches of the black trees were burnt away, they began to grow again.

The speed of growth seems to be proportional to the speed of being burned by the flame.

What is happening?!

Before Lin Xiu had time to think about it, the branches of the black trees next to him stabbed towards Lin Xiu again!

These black branches became extremely sharp, like spears.

Lin Xiu frowned, he ducked sideways, and with a wave of the Dark Edge spear, he burned the thorned branches away.

No, if it goes on like this, it won’t end at all.

Looking ahead, Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand, letting the flaming birds continue to burn the surrounding black trees.

There must be some sort of mechanism here to clear this level.

Otherwise, if the attack continues like this, it will be endless.

Is this it!?

Just when he rushed to the front and middle position, Lin Xiu saw a very huge black tree with very thick branches!

As Lin Xiu rushed here, all the branches on the huge black tree swayed, as if they turned into thousands of black spears, sprinting towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu hurriedly activated the ‘Without a Trace’ movement technique, and dodged in an instant.

Boom—

The huge black branches stabbed on the ground, the whole ground shook, and there were a lot of holes.

‘Awe of the phoenix’!

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth, then waved his right hand holding the Dark Edge spear, and several flaming birds rushed over.

Just like before, as soon as the flaming birds touched the branch of the black tree, it started to burn again.

But those branches were just burned away, and then grew out at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Damn, why is it endless?

This kind of attack was not fatal to those black trees at all, and his source strength was constantly being consumed.

When Lin Xiu looked at the huge black tree again, he was instantly stunned, as if he had thought of something.

“I’ll dig you out and see how you can still grow!”

The life of a tree was the root, what if he burnt the root directly!?

As soon as Lin Xiu used force on his legs, he jumped high, and stabbed down with a spear from the air!

And at this moment, Lin Xiu’s whole body’s source strength was mobilized.

“Heavenly Dragon.... Wrecks the City!!!”
