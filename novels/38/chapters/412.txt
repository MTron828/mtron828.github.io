Chapter 413: The Sacred Region Academy Is Not Allowed To Have Such Genius

“But the most important reason here is still because you were too weak.” The man continued staring at him and said in a nonchalant tone.

After hearing the man speak, Ouyang Hang’s fists were still clenched together but there was nothing else that he could say.

As for the rest of the men who were with Ouyang Hang, they were shocked to see what was happening.

What on earth was going on?!

“That’s enough. I’m going to reset the record at the Tower of Tournament. That kid seems to be at a very high level.” The man smiled as he patted Ouyang Hang’s shoulder. Then, he bent down and said towards Ouyang Hang, “Listen carefully. The Sacred Region Academy is not allowed to have such genius. Find a chance to get rid of him.”

He left the stadium as soon as he was done speaking to Ouyang Hang.

“Young Master Hang!” The man behind Ouyang Hang looked at him as soon as the man was gone.

This was the first time that he had seen such an expression on his face. It was as if Ouyang Hang was afraid to against that man.

Ouyang Hang, who was the first in the Northern Campus, was afraid of that man?!

“What’s my ranking in the Northern Campus?” Ouyanghang looked at the man next to him and asked.

“Number 1 of course.” The man quickly lowered his head and answered the question that he was given.

It was obvious that the man wasn’t trying to flatter him.

“But from what I’m guessing, my rank would be taken away soon.” Ouyang Hang couldn’t help but sneered when he said these words.

Taken away?

The man was shocked.

“No, perhaps Lin Xiu would be defeated as well. He…. should be number 1.” Ouyang Hang looked at the exit as he mumbled to himself.

After the match, most of the students from the other classes got to know Lin Xiu a little bit more. Those who have not fought the tenth class were busy coming up with their strategies.

None of them wanted to lose.

It was an embarrassment to lose against the tenth class.

But, with Lin Xiu there who was just like a BUG, it was difficult for them to win.

As soon as the match was over, Lin Xiu walked towards the exchange center.

This was because he needed one thing to improve his skills.

Focus Spirit.

“Huh? You’re here as soon as you’ve finished the match.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

As soon as Lin Xiu entered the exchange center, there was an interesting voice that came from inside.

“How did you get here so quickly?” Lin Xiu had a head full of questions when he saw him.

How is this possible?

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but ask when he saw the scene before his eyes.

The old man was the referee for the match before but immediately appeared in the exchange center.

“I have multiple roles since I am a capable man.” The elder gently brushed through his beard as he answered Lin Xiu.

When he heard the answer, Lin Xiu’s mouth twitch uncontrollably.

“Forget about me. What do you want to exchange this time?” The elder was looking at Lin Xiu in interest.

“Do you have Focus Spirit?” Lin Xiu asked without any hesitation.

“Focus Spirit?” The elder seemed a little surprised when he heard Lin Xiu’s question.

“En. You don’t have it?” Lin Xiu nodded his head before asking.

“Of course we do. What did you think of the Sacred Region Academy?” The elder laughed as he tapped on the interface on the table. Soon, there was something that appeared on the table.

As he looked at the screen on the table, he could see the image of the Focus Spirit.

“This quality for this item is much better than the ones that we had.”

Lin Xiu took a good look at it and noticed that the Focus Spirit had been divided into different grades – low, middle, high.

“Give me one of the highest grades.” Lin Xiu asked as his eyes were locked onto the screen.

“That would cost 10 thousand points.” The elder said as he brushed his beard.

“Give me five then.” Lin Xiu took out his card and passed it to the elder.

The elder knew that Lin Xiu had about a hundred thousand points on his card which is why he didn’t say much. He immediately swept off 50 thousand points from his card and said, “Give me a moment. I’ll get it for you now.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and sat on the chair next to the counter while waiting for the elder to get the Focus Spirit.

“Have you guys heard about the newcomer who got into the thirtieth level?!”

“That’s crazy….. The thirtieth level?!”

At that moment, Lin Xiu could hear the voices that were coming from around him.

Lin Xiu was stunned. Then, he turned around and asked the student who was next to him.

“Are you guys talking about the Tower of Tournament?”

When they heard Lin Xiu’s voice, the students next to him who were discussing it paused and looked at Lin Xiu before continuing, “That’s right. There’s a newcomer who entered the thirtieth level of the Tower of Tournament.”

“The thirtieth level?” Lin Xiu looked up with a surprised look on his face. The thirtieth level wasn’t somewhere that anyone could enter.

Warriors with such abilities to do so must be someone extraordinary, right?

One should know that Yu Yi that he fought previously was only on the twenty-second level.

“Plus, they’re still fighting now. The newcomers this year seemed to be of really high quality. Even Lin Xiu that I heard of previously was only on the 22nd floor.” The student seemed friendly and continued chatting along with Lin Xiu.

“En. Thank you.” Lin Xiu nodded his head. When he saw the elder walking out, he immediately went towards the counter.

“Five bottles of Focus Spirit. Here you go.” The elder looked at Lin Xiu who came over and handed him the five bottles as requested.

Lin Xiu picked it up and took a good look at it. The Focus Spirit was placed into a special glass bottle that had been filled in a deoxygenated environment. The color of the liquid was now a pale, blue color. There was a pale, shimmery powder within it and it looked like the galaxy.

“Your identity…. Isn’t as simple as I think, right?” Lin Xiu thought of something and then he took a good look at the old man before saying.

Even his Analytic Eyes wasn’t able to analyze the true strength of this old man. Therefore, it must be that the elder must be much powerful than he looks.

“Then do you know who I am?” The elder looked at Lin Xiu with a peculiar look in his eyes.

After being asked, Lin Xiu was stunned on the spot but he decided to not refute. He had a feeling that this elder wasn’t someone ordinary.

“You’ll find out about it when you have a chance in the future.” The elder continued staring at Lin Xiu. Then, he patted on Lin Xiu’s shoulders as he laughed and left.

“Why do you have to act so mysteriously?” Lin Xiu frowned before leaving with his Focus Spirit.

“The 31st floor! He even won the Sword King! He’s great!”
