Chapter 1072: Elder Yu

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Then, as he swung his right hand, the ball of energy then went straight towards Lin Xiu’s head!

Lin Xiu picked up the glass of energy drink that he got from the waiter. Then, when he saw the energy ball coming at him, he did not give any reaction.

You’re dead!

When the muscular man watched it happening, there was a hideous smile on his face.

He was thinking that Lin Xiu must have been frightened so badly that he could no longer move.

Then, just when the energy was about to hit Lin Xiu’s head, it was stopped by an invincible energy.

The ball stopped inches away from Lin Xiu’s head.

How was that possible?!

When the man saw what happened, his pupil shrank uncontrollably.

“This is interesting.”

Lin Xiu placed the glass back on the table. He reached towards the energy ball that was at his head and gently flicked it.

Xiu – –

Then, the ball turned directly and went back towards the muscular man!

Crap!

When he saw what was coming toward him, the man got scared. He immediately released his ‘sphere’.

Boom – –

When the ball of energy landed on his ‘sphere’, there was a loud explosion heard.

The huge impact caused the man to be thrown far away.

He even flew out of the bar’s entrance.

It was followed by a loud thud when he fell on the ground outside of the bar.

“Now, am I qualified to be here?”

Lin Xiu looked at the other warriors inside the room before asking them a simple question.

The rest of them kept quiet and they didn’t have anything else to say.

But, it was obvious from their eyes that they were shocked.

How could Lin Xiu have such strength?!

This was because in their eyes, Lin Xiu was just a respected warrior!

This little boy….there is something peculiar about him.

Some of the warriors thought to themselves.

“Get out here!!!”

After a short while, the warrior who had just been thrown outside, walked into the bar.

He had a twisted expression on his face and there was a blood stain on the corner of his mouth.

He wanted to kill Lin Xiu with one blow but he didn’t think that he would be kicked out instead.

This happened in front of so many sage warriors.

It was definitely embarrassing.

“Enough!”

When he was furious and wanted to rush into the room to kill Lin Xiu, there was another voice that came from behind.

When they heard the voice, the looks on the rest of the warriors changed and they turned in the same direction.

Lin Xiu followed the voice and turned as well.

When he took a good look at it, it was an old man sitting on a wheelchair made of jade.

There were four warriors, dressed in black combat suit, standing behind his wheelchair.

The four of them seemed different from the rest of the warriors.

By using the analytic eye, it was obvious that these four were sage warriors.

Even the old man on the wheelchair was a sage warrior!

But, it looked like his legs had been injured severely which was why they looked a little odd.

“Elder Yu.”

The rest of the sage warriors looked at the old man and greeted him respectfully.

Elder Yu?

Seeing how the rest of the warriors seemed to be bowing down to him, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

This old man doesn’t look like an ordinary man.

“Everyone’s here?”

The old man known as Elder Yu looked around the bar.

Then, he asked the rest of the warriors in a calm tone.

“We’re all here.”

One of the man stepped out and nodded his head.

It looked like he respected this old man very much.

This old man….who was he?

Lin Xiu was getting curious.

Why was it that he had the ability to show that he had the ‘Silence’…

But those from the Bai family haven’t come after him yet?

This was getting weird.

As for the man earlier, he was glaring at Lin Xiu with a murderous look in his eyes.

However, he didn’t dare to do anything.

It looked like he was quite afraid of this old man.

“Alright. Since all of you are here, I will not be wasting time.”

Elder Yu looked at the room filled with people before briefing them.

“The frost dragon. I want you to kill the frost dragon that is found at the Road of Ice and Fire.”

He told the warriors.

“I want its horns and the odd crystal.”

“Whoever that has got what I want, would be able to take this.”

As he spoke, he pulled out a box that was beautifully carved from inside his pocket.

When they saw the box, all of the warriors got excited.

Elder Yu opened the box and all of them could clearly see that sitting inside the box was a warrior skill card that was shining brightly.

‘Silence’!!!!

All of the warriors were stunned.

This overpowering warrior skills card was making their hearts beat faster.

Bakk – –

But soon, Elder Yu closed the box and did not allow them to take a closer look.

“Yu Tao will be the one guiding you today.”

Elder Yu looked to the side and signalled one of his men.

After getting the signal, one of the warriors stepped forward.

“Hello, I am Yu Tao.”

Yu Tao looked around at the warriors before introducing himself.

Yu Tao looked like a strong man and he had a faint beard around his face.

“There are a total of 26 warriors here who are all sage warriors.”

Yu Tao scanned the room before reporting it to Elder Yu.

“En. That’s enough.”

Elder Yu nodded his head.

“Let me warn you first. The frost dragon isn’t something easy to defeat. My legs are in this state because of the frost that came from it.”

Elder Yu looked around as he continued.

As for the rest of the warriors, they couldn’t help but look at Elder Yu’s legs as he spoke about them.

When they took a good look at it, all of them noticed that Elder Yu’s eyes seemed a little transparent like crystal. It definitely was not normal.

“Alright. If you have decided that you still want to join, you can leave with Yu Tao now. We will not be responsible for your death.”

Death?!

They were all sage warriors and there were so many of them!

But, from how Elder Yue was saying it, it sounded as if this frost dragon was something extremely scary?!

“Let’s go.”

Yu Tao spoke up and led the crowd out of the bar.

The warriors in the bar looked at each other before following after him.

They have no idea how powerful this beast may be but all of them wanted the legendary warrior skills card.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and followed the crowd.

Road of Ice and Fire, here I come.
