Chapter 805: Departing for Fengyun City!

Just as Lin Xiu was walking out of the city, one of the guards noticed Lin Xiu and called out for him.

“What’s the matter?”

Lin Xiu had a neutral expression on his face and he did not look nervous at all.

The security guards stared at Lin Xiu for some time before saying, “Alright. You can leave now.”

“En.”

Lin Xiu continued walking out of the city and was not looking worried or anxious.

Soon, the both of them left the city successfully.

“Huuuuu....we’re finally out of the city. I thought that we almost got caught.”

As soon as they got out of the city, Liu Pan let out a breath of relief.

“Where’s your weapon?”

Lin Xiu looked at Liu Pan and suddenly thought of it when they were far away from the city. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Right! My weapon is still in An Qi’s house!”

Liu Pan finally realised that he left his weapon behind.

“You can head back to get it. I’ll wait for you here.”

Lin Xiu said towards Liu Pan.

Crack crack – –

Suddenly, there were large hoof sounds coming towards them.

They quickly turned to the direction from where the noise was coming from and noticed that there were two huge figures from that direction.

“They’re here?!”

The look in his eyes changed and he exclaimed subconsciously.

“Fatty....your weapon!”

When Liu Pan was getting nervous, a familiar voice reached their ears.

As they took a closer look, it was An Qi and Qian Ling.

Both of them were riding on two android tigers. They were running towards them at a fast speed.

“It’s both of them!”

Liu Pan was surprised.

Then, An Qi threw the double bladed axe towards Liu Pan.

Liu Pan, on the other hand, managed to catch it as well.

“Why are you here?”

When Lin Xiu saw that it was them, he asked with a smile on his face.

“Those idiots are still looking for you in the city.”

An Qi gave a cheeky smile on her face.

“You should travel with this. There isn’t much transportation for you to head to Fengyun City. Plus, there are lots of evolved beats out there. It is safer for you to use this.”

Qian Ling jumped off her android tiger and told them both.

“Thank you.”

Lin Xiu smiled with gratitude.

“You should leave now. The news of Sun Zi’s death is now all over the place and the Sun family will hear about it very soon.” An Qi would miss them dearly but she had no other choice.

“Alright.”

“I guess this is goodbye then.”

Lin Xiu looked at them one last time and gave them a gentle smile.

“Master! I will be watching the match live so you have to defeat all of your opponents till they beg for mercy from the ground!”

An Qi clenched onto both her fists as she spoke to Lin Xiu.

“Sure. That wouldn’t be a problem.”

Lin Xiu smiled and together with Liu Pan, they got onto the android together.

“This....really is goodbye.”

An Qi and Qian Ling waved to Lin Xiu and both of them looked sad.

“Train hard and we shall meet again.”

Lin Xiu smiled. After checking through his android tiger, he started riding it.

The android tiger was travelling at a quick speed like a real tiger and was travelling at a fast speed.

“Goodbye!!”

Liu Pan bidded goodbye as well and left on the android tiger that they brought.

The android tiger was travelling quickly and the odd crystals were sufficient to keep it running.

For the next two weeks, Lin Xiu and Liu Pan were on their android tigers and were moving quickly towards Fengyun City.

At the same time, the World Warrior Championship was about to happen.

Starting from today, there was a holiday for the students from Xuanfeng Academy.

Luo Yue left the campus and headed onto a road.

As she was walking through a quiet alley, she didn’t see anyone there.

But, Luo Yue’s face turned cold and she stopped walking.

“Come out.”

Luo Yue frowned as she said bluntly.

“HEHEHEHE...”

After hearing what Luo Yue said, there was a creepy laughter that rang through the alley.

There were a few men, who looked like gangsters, walking out of the forest behind her.

“Young girl....you’re alone?”

Then, one of the men grinned as he reached out to touch Luo Yue’s face.

There were still no expressions noted on Luo Yue’s face.

When they noticed that, they thought that it was because Luo Yue was afraid.

But, Luo Yue was extremely gorgeous and the man who was reaching out to her started having other thoughts about her.

Just as he was about to touch Luo Yue’s face, she moved and it was followed by a loud crack.

“AHHHHHHH!!!”

The man’s arm was ripped off from his body instantly!

“You’re dead!”

When the others saw what happened, they were furious and all of them ran towards Luo Yue.

“Stop right there!”

Then, there was a man that rushed out all of a sudden.

Just when he appeared at the scene, he was stunned on the spot.

This was because there were already a number of men lying on the ground, whining in pain.

The man who appeared suddenly was Huang Zhen who was trying to flirt with Luo Yue.

“Boring.”

Luo Yue glanced at him before saying coldly.

Then, she turned around and left.

“Damn it!”

Seeing how Luo Yue was already leaving, Huang Zhen punched the tree trunk that was closest to him.

This was a scene that he had planned where he would save the beauty.

But, he didn’t expect for these people to be defeated so easily.

“Bunch of rubbish.”

Seeing how the men were still winning on the ground, he couldn’t help but mumble to himself.

“Huang Zhen, you really are embarrassing the Huang family.”

Then, there was another voice that appeared next to him.

Huang Zhen was surprised when he heard the voice. When he turned around, he saw the man who was dressed in a white luxurious fashion.

“Brother Guang Xuan...”

When he saw who it was walking towards him, Huang Zhen trembled and looked as if he was in fear.

“She’s just a normal girl from the Luo family. Was it necessary for you to do all these?”

The man looked at Huang Zhen as he asked.

Huang Zhen wanted to defeat himself but he didn’t know what to say.

“I will tell my father about this so that she will be married to you.”

The man looked at him helplessly before telling him.

“Really?!”

When Huang Zhen heard what Guang Xuan said, he finally looked energetic.

“Of course. She’s just a peasant from the Luo family.”

“They should be happy about it.”

The man said arrogantly.

“Thank you, Brother Guang Xuan!”

Huang Zhen was getting excited.

When he thought of how he would be able to demolish and torture that arrogant woman, he suddenly had a surge of desire towards her.

“Luo Yue, you’re home?”

At the same time, in one of the rooms in the Luo mansion, Luo Yan was practising with her sword when she saw Luo Yan and greeted her with a smile on her face.

“En.”

Luo Yue only gave a short reply.

“What’s wrong?”
