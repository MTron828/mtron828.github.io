Chapter 46: Promoted Once Again!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Following the large number of skills, the Sabertooth Hound that was fatally injured by Awe of the Phoenix felt its body temperature rise to an extremely high degree.

The numerous skills caused its body to split into pieces.

“We finally… killed it.” Li Yi heaved a sigh of relief before crashing to the floor. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The other soldiers fell as well.

Before leaving, they were informed that Operation Clean Up’s region’s strongest evolved beast would not exceed rank 3 and that rank 3 evolved beasts were extremely few. Who would have thought that they would encounter one on the first day?

Lin Xiu looked up and discovered a shiny Odd Crystal on a corpse.

“What do we do with this?” Lin Xiu used his speartip and retrieved the Odd Crystal.

Since everyone had hunted it together, it was impossible for one person to swallow it.

“Since we have exhausted ourselves, why don’t we use this crystal to recover our source strength? What does everyone think?” Xu Wen looked at everyone and suggested.

The soldiers nodded their heads and agreed.

It was pointless to sell it and since they did not know if they could leave alive, using it to restore their source strength and train was the best choice.

One after another, they held the Odd Crystal and absorbed some of its source strength.

Very soon, it became Lin Xiu’s turn.

He took the source strength and placed it in his palm. He held it with both hands and sat cross-legged as he activated his cultivation technique.

A large amount of source strength was absorbed by Lin Xiu. He was able to sense the Odd Crystal gradually turning smaller.

When the last warrior absorbed the remaining source strength within, it disappeared.

Not long after killing the rank 3 Sabertooth Hound, more and more zombies started to appear from behind.

“Damn it, those guys are back!” Li Yi was lying on the floor and resting when he saw zombie figures. He was alarmed and immediately stood up.

The zombies had left a bit of shadow in his heart as well as other soldiers. They took out their guns and started shooting.

The distance between them was too far and their lasers were unable to explode the zombies’ heads. Instead, the lasers penetrated through the bodies and made the zombies even crazier.

They started running fanatically towards Lin Xiu and the others as though they were competing in a 100m race.

Rank 2 zombies, there were several rank 2 zombies!

“Damn it, why are there so many monsters?” Li Yi took out his battle gear and was prepared to welcome the attack when a figure suddenly shot past him.

The zombies that looked terrifying to the soldiers were all large experience points in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

He used his right hand to wield the spear. When the incoming zombies were almost resolved, he gripped the spear with his left and thrust it forward.

Three rank 2 zombies were quickly killed when Lin Xiu utilized the Torrential storm of rose flowers.

“This brat doesn’t care about his life…” Xu Wen muttered to himself internally when he saw Lin Xiu was the first to rush forward.

He was more and more surprised by Lin Xiu. He had never seen anyone wield a spear and always thought that not only were spears difficult to use, but it was also difficult to train with as well.

But Lin Xiu used the spear with extreme ease, did he train with the spear for decades already?

In fact, what Xu Wen did not know was Lin Xiu had practiced the spear fundamentals with his life when he gained the Rapid Growth Enlightenment Card, so his spear skills looked to be extremely proficient.

Everyone became affected when they saw Lin Xiu struggling with all his might. They had to prevent the zombies from rushing forward, and they advanced together with Lin Xiu as they slaughtered the zombies one after the other.

Ultimately, zombies were still zombies. Without any intelligence, they were easily killed.

Lin Xiu had killed to the point of going crazy as the experience notifications in his head kept on ringing without stopping. Suddenly, Lin Xiu heard a ‘ding!’.

“Congratulations Master for promoting to level 13!”

‘Level 13 already?!’

The speed surprised Lin Xiu. He knew how hard it was as he reached higher levels.

But after thinking about it, the amount of experience gained from so many zombies was reasonable.

Just 2 more levels. Once I level up twice, I will unlock the ‘Gene Lock’. At that time, my abilities will most probably rise substantially again!

With that thought in head, Lin Xiu became even more excited. He quickly activated his stats board:

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: Level 13

Experience: 1005 (899855 experience points required for the next level)

Strength: 111

Physique: 70

Speed: 32

(Note: An average person scores at least 38 for each segment)

Skill: analytic eye, Fury

Rage build-up: 0/100

Overall Combat Strength: 800

Remaining Potential Points: 13

Without further ado, Lin Xiu added all of his potential points into strength and increased it to 124. His overall combat strength jumped from 800 to 839.

After adding his points, Lin Xiu felt the spear in his hand becoming lighter, and attacking became much easier for him!

‘Very good, with this, I will kill all the zombies in one breath!’

He unleashed his spear and used Torrential storm of rose flowers.

As he kept on utilizing the skill, Lin Xiu felt that his original three strikes in one second were improved to a stable four strikes in one second!

Occasionally, he would unleash five strikes in a second as well.

But even with this improvement, Lin Xiu felt dissatisfied at his current position. He charged right into the horde!

“What are you doing!” Li Yi’s eyes narrowed as he extended his hand to pull Lin Xiu back.

However, Lin Xiu was too fast. He was already within the horde by the time Li Yi extended his hand.

As he utilized Torrential storm of rose flowers more and more, Lin Xiu realized that his spear was like a dragon that would release bits of light aura occasionally, and the surrounding zombies would have holes in their heads.

“So strong…” The other soldiers were stunned and exhaled cold air.

These were not rank 1 zombies but rank 2. They were rank 2 zombies that had combat strength comparable to ordinary rank 1 warriors!

However, Lin Xiu was able to kill 3 zombies in the blink of an eye!
