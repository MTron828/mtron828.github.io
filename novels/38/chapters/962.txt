Chapter 963: A Century Is Too Long, I Want It Now

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“You’re progressing too quickly.”

The woman couldn’t help but exclaim when she saw the skills that were released by the young girl with a head full of white hair.

“When will I be able to turn into a warrior god?”

If it was noted, this young girl with white hair looked much older than before but it was still obvious that she was Luo Yue.

“Sister, you’re in a rush.”

“Those who became warrior gods are mostly geniuses but they still have to train for centuries.”

The woman laughed as she told Luo Yue.

“A century is too long.”

Luo Yue looked at the sky before she stretched her arm.

A drop of water fell from the sky and landed on her palm.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

In the next minute, she continued waving the sword in her arms and continued cultivating.

“It has only been a short period of time and she is already in this state. She definitely has the physique of a warrior god.”

......

The woman mumbed to herself as she stared at Luo Yue.

She was looking envious as she stared at Luo Yue.

On the other side, after getting Wang Qiang treated for his injuries, Lin Xiu was loitering around.

There was still half an hour before the next match and he could use this time to check on the abilities of the warriors around him.

However, it disappointed Lin Xiu as most of these warriors were mundane.

Suddenly, there was a man who came from behind Lin Xiu and grabbed onto Lin Xiu’s shoulders.

Boom – –

Before his hands could reach Lin Xiu’s shoulder, Lin Xiu had already grabbed onto his wrist.

“What do you think you’re doing?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lin Xiu turned around and asked.

As Lin Xiu placed pressure on his wrist, there were crackling sounds coming from his wrist.

“I…..I don’t mean any harm…”

The man was sweating and the intense pain caused his body to shiver.

“What’s the matter?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and let go of the man’s wrist.

He immediately let out a breath of relief as his wrist was free from Lin Xiu.

The pain that he felt earlier caused him to have the impulse to chop off his own wrist.

“Sir….our master is hoping to speak with you…”

His voice trembled as he spoke to Lin Xiu.

The pain that he felt earlier on his wrist was too scary and by just looking at Lin Xiu, his body was already shaking.

“What’s the matter?”

Lin Xiu asked in a flat voice.

“I was hoping that you could take some time to meet him.”

The man pursed his lips before mentioning it to Lin Xiu.

“Ummmm…..”

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu smirked.

He had a feeling that something interesting was about to happen.

The man was shocked after hearing what Lin Xiu’s answer was.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would agree to it so quickly.

“Over here please.”

He bowed towards Lin Xiu as he guided the way.

Before he met Lin Xiu, he didn’t care about who Lin Xiu was at all.

But, after the previous encounter, Lin Xiu’s powers were beyond what he had expected.

Although they did not have a fight…

The man could still feel that this man was about to be a respected warrior.

Lin Xiu was able to grab onto his wrist so accurately without much hassle.

He didn’t even have the chance to pull away his hand.

As he was reminded of it, he felt chills running down his spine.

Then, he followed the man to another side of the building.

Soon, they came to an underground bar that was nearby.

“Master, he’s here.”

As they walked into the bar, the man spoke to the people who were inside.

The entire bar was shady and gloomy.

When Lin Xiu walked into the bar, he could clearly see that there was a table in the middle of the room and there was a man sitting next to it.

It was a middle aged man, who was dressed in luxurious clothings, and it was obvious that he wasn’t an ordinary man.

There were a lot of other warriors who were standing next to him.

They seemed to be surrounding him and protecting him.

“Hmm…..all of you can leave.”

The man took a puff from his cigar and let out a ring of smoke before telling Lin Xiu to sit.

Lin Xiu remained calm and did not look anxious at all.

He got to the table, pulled out a chair and sat opposite the man.

“What is it? Tell me.”

Lin Xiu poured a drink for himself and asked the man who was sitting opposite him.

“Nice. I like men like you.”

The man laughed when he saw what Lin Xiu was doing.

“The next match….you will be fighting the 630th group, Zhang Zhen and Sun Kai.”

“I’m hoping that you will lose the match.”

He looked into Lin Xiu’s eyes and said bluntly.

“I noticed that you are quite a strong one but Wang Qiang is already injured. Your odds of winning aren’t high.”

“Instead of fighting another match, why not just enjoy it? What do you think?”

As he spoke to Lin Xiu, he threw out a cheque.

“Fill in a number.”

“This is interesting.”

Lin Xiu thought that it would be something fun but he didn’t think that he would be asked to fake a match.

Lin Xiu looked at the cheque and said, “What era are we in now? Do we still use cheques??”

Lin Xiu started writing on the cheque as he mumbled to himself.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was already filling up the cheque, the man smiled.

But, things didn’t happen according to what he had expected.

This was because Lin Xiu did not stop writing and continued writing zeros on the cheque.

This was still part of his expectation.

However, things got out of hands when Lin Xiu did not stop and there was a long number written on it – “100000000000000…”

“You’re playing tricks with me?!”

The middle aged man glared at Lin Xiu as he questioned him.

The warriors who were standing around him got closer to Lin Xiu instead and surrounded Lin Xiu.

“Aren’t you the one who told me to fill it in?”

“Anyone who got the chance would fill in as much as possible, right?”

Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders.

“Good man. You’re the first one who dares to play games with me.”

The middle aged man laughed in rage.

Soon, the smile on his face disappeared. His face turned grim instead as he said, “Nice. Since you are not taking the chances that you are offered, you shall die instead!”

With that, the rest of the warriors rushed towards Lin Xiu simultaneously!

Boom – –

Their fists were covered with energy as they aimed it towards Lin Xiu’s head!

They were all at the peak of a warrior king and some of them were respected warriors.

If all of them attacked Lin Xiu at the same time, he still wouldn’t be able to dodge it no matter how quick his reflexes were!

He would definitely be dead!

Boom – –

That’s when they saw a blue sphere appearing before their eyes.

Their fists directly landed on top of Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’!

“AHHHHHHHHHH!!!!”
