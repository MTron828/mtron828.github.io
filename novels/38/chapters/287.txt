Chapter 288: Frightening Rollie

As soon as Rollie crawled on his cheek, he wailed loudly.

Qian Lin and Qiu Li stared at the scene. At this moment, there seemed to be blood flowing down the man’s cheeks.

“It… it blasted his eyes off!?”

Qian Lin could see everything clearly. When she saw this, her eyes were filled with shock.

Rollie climbed on the man’s face and actually blew up his eyes! Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He was now frantically struggling to tear Rollie off his face.

But Rollie’s body was like that of a loach, it was so slippery and there was no way of catching it.

At the next moment, Rollie bounced away.

“I want to kill you! I want to kill you!!!”

The man was still struggling crazily at this time, trying to grab Rollie that had already disappeared.

Qiu Li could see clearly that the man’s eyes had turned into two holes of blood and the eyeballs were long gone.

He couldn’t help but heaved a sigh of relief when he saw this scene.

‘Terrifying, this is simply terrifying. What the hell is this thing!?’

“Watch out!” While Qiu Li was still in shock, the man began waving his weapon wildly.

When it was about to hit Qiu Li, Qian Lin quickly picked up the weapon on the ground and blocked the attack.

Dang–

A clear sound rang out as the weapons collided.

Now that the warrior has lost his eyes, Qian Lin didn’t feel so stressed out. When Qian Lin recalled how these people wanted to kill her, her eyes also showed strong murderous intent at this moment.

Take advantage of his disadvantage and kill him!

Without any hesitation, Qian Lin directly used her weapon to chop the man’s body!

Bang–

With a dull sound, the man’s body was directly chopped in half by Qian Lin’s spear.

Blood splashed all over the floor.

“Where did that thing go?” Qiu Li looked around at this moment.

He didn’t know where that weird creature that shocked him just now went.

He had a lingering fear when he recalled that it was this thing that killed the two men that charged over and wanted him dead.

If it wanted to mess with him, he probably wouldn’t be able to fight back at all, right?

With that thought, Qiu Li couldn’t help but shudder.

“What happened!!!”

The man who was fighting with Lin Xiu looked over and found that his two companions who had rushed over to kill Qiu Li and Qian Lin had already been killed!

Lin Xiu also saw the scene on the other side and was immediately relieved – it seemed like Rollie had dealt with them.

“What the hell did you throw over!” The man yelled at this moment.

Those two people could be regarded as his left and right shoulders, he didn’t expect them to die like this!

Scar died and now those two men were also dead. This was a serious loss for their small team.

He was now looking at Lin Xiu with eyes filled with infinite murderous intent.

He needed to tear Lin Xiu limb to limb in order to relieve his fury!

“It’s your turn next!” Lin Xiu snorted and did not answer the man’s question. At this moment, holding the Dark Edge spear, he continued to attack!

Dang dang dang——

When the two weapons collided, there were crisp and loud sounds ringing non-stop.

This man was completely enraged now and he didn’t hide his strength at all, bursting forth with all the source strength in his body!

As the source strength in his body burst forth, the long sword in his hand was also full of sword aura spiraling around it.

Boom–

Lin Xiu blocked his attack while attacking him, only to find that this man has used his rank 6 warrior ability, ‘Sphere’, to resist Lin Xiu’s attack!

The tip of the spear pierced the front of his protective shield and a dull sound resounded, but there was no way of breaking the ‘Sphere’.

“It’s useless! You’re just a rank 5 warrior!” Seeing that the tip of Lin Xiu’s spear couldn’t break his protective shield, the man laughed. Then, he began attacking Lin Xiu wildly with the long sword in his right hand!

The speed of the long sword was getting faster and faster and Lin Xiu could feel the stinging pain brought about by the spiral sword aura just from blocking the attacks.

“Ah!!!” There was no other way but to bite the bullet and attack this guy. With a sudden roar, a bright sword stabbed out!

Damn it!

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and his eyes burst out with strong killing intent!

“Go to hell!” The man felt the dangerous aura coming from Lin Xiu. At this moment, the pupils in his eyes constricted suddenly and the sword in his hand immediately thrust out towards Lin Xiu with a ray of light!

Lin Xiu saw this scene and knew that he must have used a skill.

Boom–

Just as the man used a skill to attack Lin Xiu’s body, a barrier suddenly appeared in front of Lin Xiu and directly blocked the power of the skill.

This barrier was different from the sphere opened by the rank 6 warrior. It only blocked one attack and disappeared.

But even so, about 50% of the power was blocked.

The special ability of the rank 5 warrior title has a 30% chance of resisting 50% of the damage that the warrior was about to receive!

He didn’t expect that the warrior title skill would be triggered at this time.

At this time, Lin Xiu was pleasantly surprised and clenched the spear in his hand tightly. Then, instead of resisting the man’s attack, he attacked him directly!

“‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!!!” Lin Xiu roared and activated all the power in his whole body.

When the Dark Edge spear in his hand thrust out, there seemed to be a burst of sound in the air.

And the whole body of the spear made a clanking sound at this moment.

A large amount of source strength gathered towards the spear body and the spear body was covered in black gas.

Soon, it turned into a huge black dragon that attacked the man!

Oh no!!!

In the twinkling of an eye, the pupils in the man’s eyes constricted when he saw this scene.

The weird barrier that suddenly appeared in front of Lin Xiu’s body just now blocked the damage of his skill by almost 50%!

The damage of his skill was greatly reduced.

And the worst part was that now he has no way of retracting the skill.

He could only defend!
