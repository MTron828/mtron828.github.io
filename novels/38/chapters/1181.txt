1182 Annihilated

When Lin Xiu heard his screams, he furrowed his brows.

The giant man that Lin Xiu controlled had crushed Teng Yuan onto the ground. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

However, it was obvious that Teng Yuan was still alive. Plus, he managed to carry the fist of the giant!

Soon, Teng Yuan was back on his feet.

There was a semi-transparent purple energy around his body.

This energy was in the shape of a huge bear.

A divine soul?

Lin Xiu’s pupils narrowed subconsciously when he saw what happened.

This was the same thing that Lin Xiu had previously experienced with another warrior god.

This was known as the divine soul power.

The shapes of these souls were different and their energy varied as well.

The divine mark of this huge bear has obviously given Teng Yuan an incredible amount of strength.

Teng Yuan was looking hideous as the muscles in his body had expanded till its maximum.

It was obvious that because of the divine soul power, the strength in his body has greatly increased.

Seeing the changes on Teng Yuan, Lin Xiu really wanted to get his hands on these divine soul powers.

This would greatly benefit warrior gods like them.

“You’re dead!”

Lin Xiu finally became serious with the fight and started gathering the energy in his body.

The spirit marks on the huge giant started shining brightly with a golden glow.

He raised his left arm and the arm of the huge arm did the same as well, heading straight for Teng Yuan.

Teng Yuan wanted to push aside the fist of the huge giant but his body was instantly forced back onto the ground.

The strength of the fist now was much stronger than the one before.

Teng Yuan, who had the divine soul power, looked much stronger than before but his body was once again pinned onto the ground by the huge fist.

Boom boom – –

This time, the first did not stop. Instead, it continued attacking multiple times and was punching Teng Yuan continuously.

There was a loud sound that came continuously from the impact of the fist toward the ground.

Soon, there was a huge dent on the ground because of the giant.

Teng Yuan didn’t even get the chance to retaliate.

“Ding! Congratulations on killing a warrior god! You have been awarded…”

Suddenly, there was a notification that came from the system and Lin Xiu let out a breath of relief.

The huge divine mark giant slowly turned into stars and disappeared into thin air.

Using the Divine mark was something exhausting for a warrior god, especially when the giant was released. Not only would it drain the warrior’s energy, it also drained his mental power.

Now, Lin Xiu was feeling exhausted.

This was because Lin Xiu was using the divine mark giant for the first time. Once he got used to it, it wouldn’t be so exhausting for him.

“He’s…..he’s dead?!”

The rest of the warriors watched as the giant turned into dust. In the middle of the huge crater, Teng Yuan laid in it as he was covered in blood.

All of his men looked frightened.

“All of you will be next.”

Lin Xiu looked at the remaining of Teng Yuan’s men and said in a cold tone.

Run!

This was the only word that appeared in all of their minds!

Teng Yuan was killed by Lin Xiu and wouldn’t they be facing the same thing as well?!

The rest of the warriors didn’t have time to hesitate as they fled.

However, Lin Xiu sneered and he started moving his long spear.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

As Lin Xiu moved his long spear, there were dark blue flaming birds that were released from it.

All of them went straight for the warriors who were trying to leave!

They turned around a few times as they tried to run for their lives. When they saw how they were being chased by the flaming birds, all of them looked shocked.

It was impossible for them to hide and they had no other choice but to release their ‘sphere’s.

Boom boom boom – –

The flaming birds landed on their ‘sphere’ and it instantly melted their ‘sphere’s.

The dark blue flames started burning their bodies.

“AHHHHHHH!!!!”

There were loud painful cries that could be heard.

Teng Yuans’ men didn’t even get the chance to run from Lin Xiu.

Their bodies were all toasted by the dark blue flame.

They have all turned into charcoal.

The rest of the warriors shivered in fear as well.

The young man was too powerful.

Lin Xiu managed to kill so many warriors in one blow.

After doing so, Lin Xiu turned around and looked at the warriors who were captured by Teng Yuan earlier.

The warriors turned around as well and saw Lin Xiu looked at them; chills ran down their spines.

Just when they thought that Lin Xiu was about to kill them, he turned round and left.

“This…”

The warriors were all stunned. They didn’t think that Lin Xiu would just ignore them.

One of them hesitated for a moment but quickly ran in the direction where Lin Xiu headed to.

“Ah Qing! What are you doing?”

Seeing where the warrior went, the rest of his comrades were shocked.

From their perspectives, Lin Xiu was an incredibly dangerous person. He had the ability to kill Teng Yuan which showed that he was someone incredibly powerful.

It was a good thing that he had ignored them but if they went after him…

Before they could say anything, the warrior already stood right in front of Lin Xiu.

“What is it?”

Lin Xiu looked at the warrior who stood in his way and asked in a cold tone.

Lin Xiu felt odd as well. What does he want?

The only reason why Lin XIu had killed Teng Yuan and his men was because they wanted to kill him first.

Lin Xiu wasn’t a psychopath. He wasn’t obsessed with killing others. If he was, he would have been a demon by now.

“Life saviour, thank you!”

The man got on his knees and started thanking Lin Xiu.

“I didn’t do it to help you.”

Lin Xiu answered calmly.

“I only wanted to get rid of those who were trying to kill me.”

With that said, Lin Xiu left without turning back.

Once he left these mountains, he should be able to arrive at Manhuang City.
