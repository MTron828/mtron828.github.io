Did someone find him?

Lin Xiu was very cautious at this time.

Because Lei Tong should have just returned to his room to rest, and he was not familiar with other people at all, so who is knocking on the door?

Lin Xiu carefully continued to walk over, and then leaned against the door.

But there was no sound at this time.

Lin Xiu frowned, and he didn’t sense anyone outside the door.

After a little hesitation, Lin Xiu directly opened the door.

As soon as he opened the door, Lin Xiu found that there was no one outside.

‘Taking a closer look, there was a long thing wrapped in black cloth on the ground.

Seeing this scene, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly, and then he picked it up.

Pulling open the black cloth, it turned out to be his own Dark Edge spear!

It seemed that the person arranged by Ye Kai secretly brought it up.

After all, the Dark Edge spear that he used was too distinctive. If he was holding this weapon outside, he would easily be discovered.

Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief at this time. After taking the Dark Edge spear back to his room, he closed the door with his backhand.

Holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, Lin Xiu waved it with joy in his eyes.

This spear, which has been with Lin Xiu for so long, was still very handy.

“Oh right, let’s take a look at the current attributes first.”

At this time, Lin Xiu put the Dark Edge spear aside, and said aloud as if talking to himself.

Soon, as Lin Xiu entered the system, he checked his attribute panel:

Title: Rank 8 warrior (unused titles: Rank 1 warrior, Rank 2 warrior, Rank 3 warrior, Rank 4 warrior, Rank 5 warrior, Rank 6 warrior, Rank 7 warrior)

Level 44, still one level away before he could be upgraded to a rank 9 warrior!

“I still need a little more experience…”

Lin Xiu said a little depressedly.

At this time, he looked at the number of lottery draws he had accumulated, and before he knew it, he had already accumulated eight times!

Let’s take a look at the lottery first.

Lin Xiu entered the familiar lottery page at this time.

It was still the same big turntable as before, nothing special.

“Let’s draw 8 times?”

Lin Xiu thought for a while, and then said aloud to himself.

Soon, as Lin Xiu chose eight consecutive draws, the big turntable tured frantically.

Di di di-

“Congratulations to the master for getting a lot of odd crystals!”

“Congratulations to the master for getting the union coins!”

“Congratulations, master…”

“Damn it! It’s all rubbish!?”

Hearing the system prompts, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

Now, the ordinary odd crystals and those union Coins were useless to him.

Soon, as a white light flashed in the air, a packet of odd crystals and cards of union coins all fell down.

“Skill card, and…”

“Eh?

At this time, as a white light flashed again, Lin Xiu could clearly see that a battle suit fell from the air.

{Star Moon God Armor]!

“This is the grand prize!?”

Lin Xiu hurriedly checked the news of the system at this time, and it was true. Among the eight consecutive draws, he really won a grand prize!

And this award turned out to be a battle suit.

“It looks pretty good.

Lin Xiu touched the white battle suit. There were many white scales on the battle suit, and it felt grainy to touch.

And this uniform looked thin, but it was actually quite heavy.

Very textured.

And at this time, Lin Xiu also saw the information of this battle suit from the system interface, and it actually showed: Strength +50, additional active skill: [Knowing Strike] (cooling time: one hour).

A look of surprise appeared on Lin Xiu’s face. This was the first time he had seen a battle suit with additional attributes.

The previous battle suit was damaged during the battle that night, and now it was used as a pillow when he wanted to doze off.

Lin Xiu couldn’t wait to put on this battle suit.

Lin Xiu could clearly feel it right after he put it on. His strength seemed to have slightly increased!

Don’t underestimate these fifty attribute points. For the current Lin Xiu, a small amount of power has a very big effect.

Moreover, Lin Xiu also allocated the eighty-seven potential points after the upgrade to each attribute.

As soon as the attribute points were allocated, Lin Xiu felt a sense of comfort in his body.

“Oh right…”

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something, then took out his mobile phone and dialed a number.

“Lin Xiu, you’re not dead yet?”

Lin Xiu just made the call successfully, and after the other party answered, he heard a light voice coming over.

“Please, do you want me to die so much?”

Lin Xiu suddenly had black lines all over his head.

“He he.”

‘There was no doubt that the other party was Baili Haoling.

Baili Haoling, who was still a little depressed at first, was still a little excited when she heard the call from Lin Xiu.

“Lin Xiu is okay?”

Because Baili Haoling was over there in the hall, Ouyang Hang heard her voice and said aloud at this time.

Baili Haoling nodded at him.

“You guy, where are you now, let me tell you, the entire Sky City is looking for you now, I’ll find someone to bring you back here, it should be safer…”

“No need.”

Hearing Baili Haoling’s words, Lin Xiu smiled and said.

Baili Haoling was stunned for a moment, then opened her eyes wide and said to Lin Xiu on the other end of the phone, “No? You are courting death, do you know that they…”

“Tm ona spaceship now.”

Hearing Baili Haoling’s caring words, Lin Xiu smiled and said while feeling his heart warm.

“You… what? You said you were on a spaceship?” At this time, it was Baili Haoling’s turn to be shocked. “Well, I’m going to another planet now.”

Lin Xiu didn’t hide it either.

“My friend helped me.”

He knew that Baili Haoling would be surprised, so he continued to speak at this time.

“Your friend is pretty amazing ah…”

Baili Haoling also said in surprise at this time.

You must know that the current sky city was under martial law to such an extent that Lin Xiu can’t escape.

“Well, you can take care of the two pets I have in the room.”

Lin Xiu continued to speak.

Rollie and Xiao bai were both left in the room, and he couldn’t take them away at this time.

“Tsk, I brought them here long ago. We are at the Sky City Building, and now these two little guys are making a fuss.” Baili Haoling said aloud at this time.

While she was talking, she looked behind and saw Rollie and Xiao Bai, who were flying around over there.

“Come back alive.”

At this time, Baili Hao Ling paused, and then said seriously. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
