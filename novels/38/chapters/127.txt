Chapter 128: A Hundred Men Against the Vine Beast

“There’s something beneath.”

Lin Xiu looked at the black zone that resembled an abyss, hesitated for a moment before speaking out.

“That’s right. There’s something down there.” Qin Li looked over at Lin Xiu and agreed with praise.

To discover that there’s something down there when he just arrived, his observation skill is good.

“Thing? What thing?” Zhang Yin and the others blurted out subconsciously.

“Take a look.” Qin Li took out an ordinary rank 1 odd crystal and threw it to the center of the path.

RUmblings could be heard and the odd crystal rolled down. In the next moment, a few vine-like things shot forward and coiled around the odd crystal and pulled it down the abyss zone.

“That…” Zhang Yin and the others stared at the sight in shock.

Lin Xiu became certain that the vine things looked to be the tentacles of some sort of evolved beast.

Just like before.

After making calculated guesses, he reckoned that the creature should be extremely big and the tentacles had pervaded through the place via the cracks.

“Evolved beast, there is a very terrifying evolved beast below.” Qin Li spoke gravely.

“I believe that we can discuss how to defeat that thing together!” Right at this moment, a seemingly built man wielding a large broadsword announced loudly to everyone.

When he finished his sentence, the 100 pairs of eyes turned to him.

“I am Liu Qiang, a rank 5 warrior. I can see that the evolved beast below is a rank 6 Green Vine Beast.” He swept his gaze across everyone.

Green Vine Beast?

Lin Xiu took out his phone and opened up an illustrated handbook on evolved beasts.

Lin Xiu had previously read through all the contents and downloaded it. Even without a connection, it would not influence his queries.

After enquiring about it, Lin Xiu discovered that there was indeed information regarding the creature!

“Rank 6 Green Vine Beast, a gigantic creature that resembles a sea anemone but with length spamming over 10 meters. The tentacles on the body are extremely long and green like vines. Capable of breaking steel, a powerful monster of the sea although it can still survive out of water.” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu’s scalp turned numb when he saw the creature’s tentacles were the ones that he had encountered previously.

Rank 6 evolved beast ah!

Such large types of evolved beasts were the most difficult to deal with.

“You know that it is a rank 6 evolved beast and is a gigantic type evolved beast, you want us to kill ourselves?” A warrior stood up and glared at Liu Qiang.

“We have over a hundred warriors here, as long as we lure it here, we can definitely kill it. And a rank 6 evolved beast’s odd crystal is of astronomical value.” Liu Qiang spoke to the crowd.

The others were in fact moved when they heard his words, but they could not form their resolve because the value of the odd crystal might be astronomical, but it could be earned. If they died, they would have nothing.

“Either we wait to die here or we kill it. It is just a rank 6 evolved beast.” Liu Qiang continued to fan the flames.

“All of you can wait to die, aside from the path ahead to leave, there’s nowhere else to go. In the end, you guys will become exhausted or starve to death.”

“Fine! Let’s give it a go!”

At this time, a small group walked towards Liu Qiang. They decided to gamble one time instead of waiting for their deaths.

Once a team moved, the others started to congregate.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu spoke up.

Liu Qiang was a rank 5 warrior and was the strongest of the group. Although Lin Xiu could tell that he wanted the rank 6 odd crystal, Lin Xiu did not mind. The main goal was to get rid of the creature to leave.

Once all the warriors had gathered, a man looked at Liu Qiang and asked, “how do you plan to kill it?”

“I used a powerful light to illuminate that direction and it seems that it is all water. It will be difficult for us to attack it if it remains down there, but we can use this…”

Liu Qiang chuckled and took out a round object the size of a ping-pong ball.

“L2 type bomb, the might of this small object is extremely powerful.” Liu Qiang chuckled.

“Will this kill us as well?” A man looked at the bomb and revealed a fearful look.

They had heard of the power of this bomb as well, it was classified as a controlled product and could not be purchased on a whim.

“No, everything beneath us is water.” Liu Qiang shook his head, He approached the abyss zone and with the ball and pressed the activation button. At this time, a timer screen appeared on it for 3 seconds.

Liu Qiang threw it down without hesitation!

The other warriors immediately retreated against the metal walls and plugged their ears with their fingers.

Rumble-

Following a loud rumble, the abyss suddenly erupted with flames!

The explosion was so loud it felt as though their eardrums were breaking as well.

All the warriors were flung onto the metal wall from the shockwave of the explosion. If not for them positioning themselves at the wall, their bones might have shattered from the impact.

But the walls were built extremely well. The intense explosion did not even break any of the lights inside the walls.

The place shook for a long while before stopping.

Guuu-

A strange sound came out as tentacles that resembled green vines started to crawl upwards.

It crawled to the surface.

A gigantic creature could be seen crawling upwards from beneath the water!

When it appeared, it was as though a gigantic black figure had covered everyone.

Rank 6 Green Vine Beast!!!

It was cylindrical in shape and had many tentacles all around its body that differed in size. It propped its entire body upwards and looked extremely horrifying.

“Let’s go! Kill that thing!!!” Liu Qiang roared out loud.

He raised his broadsword and charged forward.

All the other warriors reacted and activated all sorts of skills that enveloped the entire place!
