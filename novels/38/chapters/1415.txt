1416 Battle Against God King

“Ah!!!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

An Tiancheng, who had just been repelled, roared angrily at this moment.

The body jumped directly from the Scarlet Flame Beast, and instantly appeared in front of Lin Xiu!

The sword in his hand burst out with an extremely terrifying red flame, attacking Lin Xiu frantically.

Dangdangdang

Lin Xiu looked at this scene, and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

Holding the Dark edge spear in his hand, he frantically block the attacks.

This An Tiancheng is indeed worthy of being a God king. When he fights seriously, his strength is really very strong!

And when Lin Xiu resisted his attack, a fiery red figure suddenly appeared behind him.

The sharp claws of the Scarlet Flame Beast directly clawed at Lin Xiu’s body!

Tear–

The battle uniform on his body was torn apart by his extremely sharp claws at this moment!

A deep bloodstain also appeared on the body.

Damn it!

The expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed. He never expected that the power of the Scarlet Flame Beast was so strong!

It is not comparable to ordinary god-level evolved beasts.

But now that Lin Xiu is resisting An Tiancheng’s crazy offensive, it doesn’t seem so easy to fight back.

Whoosh

But at this moment, the little black dragon that flew out to devour the souls of other martial gods quickly flew over.

Facing the Scarlet Flame Beast, it started to attack!

The Scarlet Flame Beast, which originally wanted to attack Lin Xiu, was directly bitten away by the little black dragon.

Lin Xiu felt that there was no pressure behind him, and he was much more relaxed at this time.

“Do you think that with your strength alone, you can deal with me!!!”

“What a joke!”

An Tiancheng roared angrily at this time.

The flame saber in his hand continued to attack Lin Xiu frantically!

Whoosh whoosh

As he swung his saber, waves of terrifying saber energy were also released.

Some saber energy hit the ground below, and there were loud sounds.

But his attack was still parried by Lin Xiu with a spear.

If it was an ordinary God warrior’s weapon, at this time, it would definitely be split off by his saber.

But the Dark edge spear that Lin Xiu held in his hand didn’t even have a crack!

Not sure what material it is made of.

“die!!!”

At the next moment, An Tiancheng took advantage of most of the source strength in his body, and instantly covered the saber in his hand!

That terrifying source strength made the power of the saber even more powerful and terrifying.

Boom

This blade cut Lin Xiu and his weapon in half!

died!?

The expressions of all the warriors around them changed immediately when they saw this scene.

But at the next moment, Lin Xiu’s body appeared behind An Tiancheng.

The spear he was holding was about to pierce through An Tiancheng’s head!

But the long spear couldn’t penetrate his head at all.

“roll!”

An Tiancheng let out a roar, and his body exploded with terrifying power.

Lin Xiu’s body was instantly shattered into gravel.

At this moment, he saw that there were three figures of Lin Xiu in the sky!

“Don’t engage in such little tricks. Do you think I don’t know which one is the real you?”

An Tiancheng’s face turned cold, and with a thought, Lin Xiu’s body felt an invisible force, squeezing towards him directly!

The bodies of the other two Lin Xius burst instantly.

And Lin Xiu’s body also felt extremely uncomfortable.

That’s right, just now Lin Xiu used ‘Mirror Image’.

But this kind of move has no effect at all in front of a powerful warrior.

Boom

...

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s mind moved, and a terrifying blue flame burst out from his body.

‘Profound Intent.Awe of the Phoenix’!

With a wave of the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand, a large number of blue flaming birds instantly combined into a huge flaming phoenix, and rushed toward him!

This huge flaming phoenix is really terrifying.

The terrifying temperature directly made the faces of the warrior gods not far away become extremely ugly.

“Small tricks!!!”

An Tiancheng let out a roar, and behind him, a huge ice and snow goddess divine soul appeared!

Black-level Ice and Snow Goddess!

With the appearance of this spirit, in the next moment, his saber, which was originally full of flames, suddenly turned into an ice blade.

Holding the saber in both hands, he slashed in the air!

A force of frost was released directly, forming an incomparably huge ice wolf, and charged toward the flaming phoenix!

...

But this flaming phoenix was formed by the power of the Netherfire. When the two powerful forces collided, there was a loud sound!

Boom

The entire surrounding space seemed to vibrate.

“Die!!!”

An Tiancheng roared angrily and continued to follow the huge ice wolf with a lot of strength.

Originally, the two forces collided as if they were evenly matched.

But at the next moment, the ice wolf tore apart the body of the flaming phoenix, and directly charged in front of Lin Xiu.

The extreme coldness it emanated had frozen over years.

The ice wolf’s claws moved toward Lin Xiu’s body, and took a direct shot!

die!!!

An Tiancheng roared in his heart.

It seemed as if he could already see that Lin Xiu was directly crushed by the terrifying power of the ice wolf.

But at this moment, a dazzling golden light erupted from Lin Xiu’s body.

Boom

The cold claws hit Lin Xiu’s body, not only did not smash Lin Xiu’s body into pieces.

Instead, its claws just burst off!

How can this be?

Looking at this scene, the pupils in An Tiancheng’s eyes suddenly shrank.

Pata

At this time, the frost on Lin Xiu’s body burst instantly.

The whole body, holding a spear full of flames, directly attacked the ice wolf!

As the spear pierced through the giant ice wolf, a large number of cracks appeared on its body.

In the blink of an eye, it completely shattered!

And at this time, Lin Xiu’s figure flashed, and he flashed in front of An Tiancheng.

The Dark edge spear he was holding stabbed towards his chest!

Just as An Tiancheng was about to dodge, Lin Xiu’s divine soul, the little black dragon, appeared behind him.

Facing his divine soul, he directly bit down!

“ah!!!”

The divine soul was bitten, and the severe pain caused An Tiancheng to scream.

But he looked at Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear that was about to pierce his chest, and directly grabbed the end of the spear with his right hand.

As soon as he grabbed the tip of the sharp Dark Edge spear, he was directly cut by the extremely sharp tip, and golden blood also dripped out.

The faint blue flames on the tip of the spear also infiltrated into his body from his wound in an instant.

Netherworld flame can not only burn the body but also burn the soul!

Even a warrior of the god king level like An Tiancheng can’t withstand the pain that burns his soul!

“ah!”
