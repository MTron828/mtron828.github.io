Chapter 669: Boarding the Spaceship

Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Go over from here.”

When Lin Xiu just walked over, a federal police officer looked at Lin Xiu, and then said to him.

He looked over and saw a special machine over there.

Walking through that thing, his entire body would be scanned.

Even Lin Xiu’s height, weight, and fingerprints were instantly scanned.

The staff on the side looked at the screen, there seemed to be nothing unusual, and then waved his hand to signal Lin Xiu to leave.

After walking in for a while, Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief. At this time, there were ‘clicking’ sounds and Lin Xiu’s body was clearly a little taller.

Lin Xiu did not expect that this place would be so strict.

Holding his airline ticket, Lin Xiu walked over to the front.

There were fifteen minutes left before the departure time, so people already started to board the spaceship ahead of schedule.

However, Lin Xiu found out that there were very few people going to the Marqi planet, and almost all the warriors were going to the nearby galaxies instead.

“Brother, are you going to Marqi’s planet too?”

At this time, a man in his thirties watched Lin Xiu go to the passage to the Marqi planet, then he smiled and said to Lin Xiu.

“En”

Lin Xiu nodded, then looked at the man and said, “Why are there so few people going to this planet?”

Because compared to the crowds of people who went to other planets, the number of people who went to Marqi planet seemed to be very small.

This made Lin Xiu feel a little strange.

“Brother, don’t you know? Margi Planet is a new route launched recently, and it is relatively far away from the earth.”

“But this is not the most important thing. The most important thing is that the warriors over there are said to be very strong. We ordinary warriors are simply courting death.”

This man also seemed to be a talker, and when he heard Lin Xiu’s words, he babbled on.

Lin Xiu also came to his senses at this time, because the few planets were all in the state of development, and there were risks for warriors who were going to those planets.

Compared with other planets, Marqi planet was really not suitable to go to, and it was very far away.

One must know that the price of such a ticket to other planets was at least several million union coins.

“What about you, why are you going?”

Lin Xiu spoke to him.

“Tm going to find my son.”

The man said this, and suddenly said a little sadly.

“son?”

Lin Xiu was a little puzzled.

“En, my son was taken away by the Galaxy Smugglers. According to the information I got, he should have gone to the Margi planet.”

Saying this, the man clenched his hands tightly, and his fingernails dug in his flesh.

Seems to be a little emotional.

“Tm sorry, I’m emotional.”

The man came back to his senses at this time, and after that, he took a deep breath and smiled at Lin Xiu.

“By the way, brother, what’s your name?”

The man said to Lin Xiu.

“Lin Qi.”

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment, then quickly responded and said.

This was the new identity that Ye Kai arranged for Lin Xiu, and it has been entered into the federal government’s system through special means, so Lin Xiu was able to get through here safely.

“My name is Lei Tong, nice to meet you.”

‘The man was quite friendly and said with a smile.

Soon, when they walked to the front, their tickets were about to be checked and irises verified.

‘When he saw Lei Tong going to get verified, Lin Xiu was a little nervous.

Although there was a layer of artificial fingerprints on his fingers, this iris verification was still quite troublesome.

But since Ye Kai said it was fine, Lin Xiu took a deep breath and continued walking.

The staff member was a middle-aged man. At this time, he took Lin Xiu’s ticket and glanced at it, and asked Lin Xiu to stand in front of the machine to check.

“all right.”

‘The expression on the man’s face didn’t change at all, and quickly let Lin Xiu pass.

“Thanks.”

Lin Xiu said aloud.

If he guessed correctly, this person was the one arranged by Ye Kai.

‘They walked over and then a staff led them into the spaceship.

This spaceship was huge and had various facilities inside.

‘When he was outside just now, Lin Xiu only saw a few people, but after entering the spaceship, he found that there were still dozens of passengers.

‘There were quite a lot of people.

“The flight time of this flight is expected to be one week. After you board the plane, you can rest in your room, or have fun in the spacecraft…”

At this time, as Lin Xiu stepped onto the spaceship, he heard the sound from inside the spaceship.

Aweek…

Lin Xiu frowned at this time, this week is indeed a bit long.

“Tl go back to my room to rest first.”

After Lin Xiu stepped into the spaceship, he said to Lei Tong.

“Okay.”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Lei Tong also nodded.

The facilities in the room here were very good, and everything in it seemed to be brand new.

As soon as Lin Xiu walked in, he laid down on the bed.

He was a little tired…

Subconsciously reaching out to touch his wound, Lin Xiu remembered everything that happened last night.

What were those red packets of candy-like things?

After eating, Lin Xiu found that all the serious wounds on his body had been repaired.

It was really amazing.

Moreover, those people probably thought that he was seriously injured, so Lin Xiu could get through relatively smoothly.

‘Thinking of the man last night, Lin Xiu revealed a hint of shock in his eyes.

‘That kind of strength was really too powerful. In the past, Lin Xiu thought that the rank 9 warriors were very powerful beings, but now, there were even more powerful existences.

Oh right, he should look at his current attributes…

Last night was spent in a very tense state, so Lin Xiu hadn’t had time to enter the interface of the system.

At this time, Lin Xiu was sitting on the bed, and when he first entered the system in his mind, he found that his system had a lot of information prompts.

There were a lot of prompts for killing warriors and getting points, and there were also prompts for leveling up and getting more lottery draws.

‘There were a lot of them, and they kept flashing, making Lin Xiu, who was a little obsessive-compulsive, keep clicking and checking.

Bang bang bang-

Just when Lin Xiu finally clicked to check all the information and was about to enter the attribute panel to check, Lin Xiu heard a knock on the door. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank suddenly, then returned to reality from the system, stood up, and walked carefully towards the door..
