Chapter 216: North Campus Class 1, Ouyang Hang!

“Rank 1 of the freshmen rankings of Tower of Tournament and even squeezed Zhuo Qixing out…” The man chuckled.

He had short hair and a big build. He had fully developed muscles that were not overexaggerated.

It was as though his entire body was brimming with energy.

“Oh, I forgot to introduce ourselves, I am Ouyang Hang, she is Tian Zixia…” The man chuckled and said.

Ouyang Hang… Tian Zixia…

‘Why are their names so familiar?’

Lin Xiu was stumped for a moment but his eyes gradually grew large.

‘Ouyang Hang, isn’t he ranked 2nd on the freshmen rankings in the Tower of Tournament? And if I didn’t remember wrongly, Tian Zixia should be ranked 3rd!’

“We have no ill intent and only want half of your odd crystals.” Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu’s surprised eyes and smirked as he spoke up.

“That is because the reward for first prize is extremely important to us and you guys look like you have plenty.”

‘And that’s no ill intent?’ Lin Xiu sneered.

Luo Yue was at the front and was already walking over with her sword in hand.

“You want to fight us?” Ouyang Hang’s eyes turned cold.

How could a rational person want to fight with five experts from north campus class 1?

And two of them were in the top 5 of the Tower of Tournament freshmen ranking list.

And there were five of them!

And all of them were in their peak states.

“You talk too much nonsense.” Luo Yue replied indifferently.

‘How much nonsense is there in your mouth?’

The words pierced Ouyang Hang’s heart and caused his face to change.

“Seeking death!” Ouyang Hang snorted and grabbed the silver spear that he had stabbed into the ground beside him and thrust it at Luo Yue!

Sou!

His spear moved extremely fast. With a blur and a cold flash, the spear tip was already in front of Luo Yue!

Clank-

Luo Yue moved her right hand and used her thin sword to block the spear. The collision instantly produced sparks.

“Hmph, quite fast of you.” Ouyang Hang snorted and was about to continue his attack when a black spear stabbed right at him!

As his spear came forth, vacuum explosions were produced in the air.

Lin Xiu squinted his eyes. He did not expect Ouyang Hang to use the spear as well, and he was obviously an expert.

Clank-

Just as Lin Xiu’s spear was about to reach, Ouyang Hang retracted his spear and blocked the attack.

At the same time as Luo Yue was about to attack, Tian Zixia intercepted her with her sword: “Your opponent is me!”

Tian Zixia was a pretty lady but was still inferior to Luo Yue.

This made her jealous.

“You’re rank 5?!” At the same time, Ouyang Hang exclaimed after blocking Lin Xiu’s attack.

He had paid attention to Lin Xiu when Lin Xiu got first place in the freshmen ranking in the Tower of Tournament.

After investigating, he found out that Lin Xiu was only a rank 4 warrior. But who would have thought that Lin Xiu would become a rank 5 warrior in such a short timespan?!

This speed was still a bit too horrifying even to a genius like him.

“You guys from north campus class really have a lot of rubbish to spew.” Lin Xiu replied indifferently and stabbed forward with both hands on the spear again!

His spear moved like a dragon!

The eyes of the other three teammates of north campus class 1 changed and they were about to take action.

“You guys don’t have to do anything, we will get rid of them with ease.” Ouyang Hang sensed their movement and spoke up indifferently.

Upon hearing his words, they nodded their heads and stopped.

They watched as Ouyang Hang fought against Lin Xiu while Tian Zixia went against Luo Yue and smiled.

In their eyes, although Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were strong, they could not compare against north campus class 1.

“Seems like you’re slightly talented.” Ouyang Hang fought Lin Xiu with his spear.

His hands turned slightly numb when the spears collided.

“Hand over your odd crystals and I’ll let you go.” Lin Xiu snorted and stared at him.

“Seeking death!!!” Ouyang Hang felt humiliated when he heard Lin Xiu.

They were clearly the predators trying to take Lin Xiu’s odd crystals but Lin Xiu was the one to threaten him instead. How could he take it?

“Earth-shattering Strike!!!” Ouyang Hang held his silver spear with both hands and unleashed terrifying source strength after deflecting Lin Xiu’s attack. With a swing of his spear, explosions occurred as the spear cut through the air.

Rumble-

The powerful attack went straight for Lin Xiu.

The terrifying force caused the ground to split and cracks to spread everywhere!

It felt like an intense earthquake as the cracks pervaded outwards until Lin Xiu’s spot. A dense cloud of dust had formed due to the attack.

“Hmph, even if you’re a rank 5 warrior, there are strong and weak warriors in the same rank.” He looked at the destruction caused by his own skill and smirked.

Earth-shattering Strike was a peak gold skill and the destructive force was not to be looked down upon.

If nothing went wrong, Lin Xiu would be severely injured no matter how fast he could react and block the attack!

“Just with that?” Lin Xiu suddenly walked out from the dust.

Lin Xiu had dust over him as he wiped away the blood on his lips and said indifferently.

“How is that possible!?” Before Ouyang Hang could speak, his teammates all looked at Lin Xiu with shock.

They knew the might of Ouyang Hang’s skill, but who would have thought that Lin Xiu only sustained a light injury!

Ouyang Hang’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

‘Why! How is he able to deflect my skill!?’ Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief, he almost failed to react in time against the terrifying skill, but the rank 5 title’s effect had activated and blocked 50% of the damage!

“It should be my turn now, right?”
