1205 Baili Haoling’s Divine Soul

Lin Xiu looked at the black dragon around him and he suddenly turned speechless.

This was because the divine soul of the black dragon wasn’t as domineering as it had first appeared in the air.

The dragon was only as thick as his arm.

The body of the black dragon was formed by small black particles.

Plus, it was flying beside Lin Xiu.

“It’s slowly using my source energy…”

Lin Xiu could feel that the energy inside his body was being used.

In order to sustain this black dragon, he would be using up most of his source energy.

The longer he sustained the dragon, the more energy would be used instead.

However, Lin Xiu still wasn’t clear what this dragon could bring him.

He still had no idea how to use it as well.

Lin Xiu shook his head helplessly. With the control of his mind, the dragon that was beside him slowly disappeared right in front of his eyes.

It has only been a short period of time but the dragon has already used up half of the energy source in his body.

This divine soul seemed to be consuming a lot of his energy.

This was why Sun Qi did not use his spirit powers while fighting him earlier.

“Someone else acquired a divine soul!!!”

Suddenly, there was a loud cry.

There was a bright red glow that appeared amongst them and all of them were shocked.

There were lots of warriors that would be here every year but there weren’t many of them who would acquire divine souls. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

It was so rare that the total number of them could be counted with one hand.

However, this year it was different. They were only here for a short while and Lin Xiu had already acquired a black grade divine soul. Now, there was another warrior that acquired a red grade divine soul. They were all in shock.

“Haoling?!”

When Lin Xiu turned around, he saw two blood red daggers that were crossed on top of Baili Haoling’s body. It was the divine soul of a pair of daggers.

The daggers looked horrifying and there was a strong murderous aura that came from it.

“Not only does it not look weird, it seems quite powerful…”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

“This is impossible!”

Fu Tianling’s hands were clenched together as he growled.

Lin Xiu had just acquired the strongest divine soul and now another red grade divine soul has been acquired!

This was the woman that came with Lin Xiu!

Fu Tianling was about to turn crazy! It has to be noted that the divine soul that he got was merely a gold grade divine soul!

“Look up where they’re from!”

On the other end, Fu Tianyuan stared at Baili Haoling as well. Then, he gave his orders to the warrior that was standing next to him.

“Yes, Sir!”

“Interesting.”

Fu Tianyuan was now getting interested in Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling.

The city lords of XIanling City could both easily acquire their own divine souls.

Baili Haoling’s eyes were not closed. Instead, they were wide open.

But, both her eyes were now blood red in colour.

In this form, all of Baili Haoling’s abilities would be greatly enhanced.

This also included her ability to comprehend.

Soon, the blood red daggers turned into a form of energy and entered Baili Haoling’s body through her forehead.

There was a mark of a pair of daggers that appeared on her head.

Then, Baili Haoling’s eyes turned back to normal as well.
