1288 Baili Haoling Became Powerful (2)

“What a rubbish domain. Useless.”

Baili Haoling mocked Yuan Daling the moment she chopped the red energy figure into pieces.

“You…”

Upon hearing what she was saying, Yuan Daling’s expression turned hideous.

!!

At the same time, he could no longer do anything with his domain strength!

He had exhausted all of his domain strength in order to summon the blood red figure. Once they had been destroyed, there was nothing he could do now.

“Let me show you my domain.”

Baili Haoling let out a cold laugh and there was a laugh amount of energy that was released!

Lin Xiu looked at the scene before him and he couldn’t help but felt curious.

This was because he had the purification skills that caused the other domain strength to be useless to him.

This was why he never cared about what domain the other party had.

At the same time, the energy being released by Baili Haoling was not through the ground.

Instead, it came from above their heads.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Then, the energy turned into multiple daggers and rushed toward the ground!

Yuan Daliang looked at the daggers that were made of overpowering energy. As it was headed for him, his eyes widened in shock.

He quickly moved his body but some of them were headed toward the ground.

Boom boom boom – –

At that instant, the entire area was filled with soft groans.

The ground was made out of one of the strongest materials but most of them were destroyed by the blood red daggers.

It was sufficient to show how powerful these daggers were.

“That is useless. You will never be able to hide from me.”

Seeing how Yuan Daliang was trying to dodge the daggers that were targeted at him, Baili Haoling did not panic but spoke in a calm manner instead.

As expected, with that said, all of the daggers in the air seemed to have their own thoughts and went straight towards Yuan Daliang!

“Move!!!”

Yuan Daliang, who dodged it by luck, looked even more terrified and he roared in rage.

He quickly released his ‘sphere’, hoping to stop all of the daggers that were headed his way.

Clang clang clang – –

The red daggers landed on his ‘sphere’. Some even pierced through it and were stuck on his ‘sphere’!

His ‘sphere’ instantly turned into a porcupine!

With the enforcement from the divine souls of the daggers, the blood-red daggers that were formed by Baili Haoling’s domain strength looked even sharper and scarier.

Yuan Daling, who was inside his ‘sphere’ , started shivering when he saw what was happening to him.

These daggers were so sharp! They even pierced through his ‘sphere’ that he thought were indestructible!

It almost exploded!

“Looks like you have a pretty tough ‘sphere’.”

Baili Haoling was shocked as well.

However, Yuan Daliang on the other hand almost spat out a mouthful of blood after hearing what she said.

Did this young woman really think so lowly of him?!

Just when Yuan Daliang was prepared to attack again due to how angry he was feeling, Baili Haoling did not give him the chance to do so. His figure shifted and she instantly appeared before him. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

There was a pair of daggers that appeared before him!!!

Boom – –

His ‘sphere’ was already looking like a porcupine due to how there were numerous daggers stuck in it. With another attack from Baili Haoling, his ‘sphere’ instantly exploded!

Pfft – –

As soon as it exploded, Yuan Daling spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Ahhhhh!!!!”

Then, before he could react, he saw a cold light that flashed across his eyes and there was an intense pain that came from both his arms.

Blood splashed everywhere.

Baili Haoling had just chopped off his arms!

The rest of the warriors, who were spectating, couldn’t help but tremble in fear as well.

Especially when they saw how red Baili Haoling’s eyes were and how deadly they looked.

This caused most of the warriors around to feel frightened!

This young man was the opposite of how she looked! How could she be so powerful?!

As for Yuan Daliang, he may not be the city lord of a major city but he was still a city lord. He would be participating in the competition. How did he lose his arms so easily?!

“That’s a huge progress…..”

...

Lin Xiu was surprised as well.

Baili Haoling seemed to have improved drastically recently. Although it was true that Yuan Daling had been careless and took Baili Haoling to be a normal warrior. However, she was able to tear down his limbs so quickly and this was truly because her skills have upgraded tremendously.

Baili Haoling held onto her daggers that were covered in blood as she walked towards Yuan Daliang.

“You…..you can’t kill me.”

Yuan Daling looked at Baili Haoling who was getting closer. He held onto his arms in pain as he spoke to Baili Haoling.

“I won’t kill you since I am someone who sticks to the rule.”

Baili Haoling stared at Yuan Daliang with her red eyes and smiled.

“But….you do have to compensate me for my loss. In order to fight you, I have wasted a lot of my energy.”

When these words came out of her mouth, the corner of her lips twitched.

They couldn’t see how much energy Baili Haoling had lost. Plus, there was a thick amount of energy in the air. With the help of the cultivation technique, she should be able to replenish all the energy that she had lost.

“How…..much do you want…”

...

Yuan Daling clenched onto his jaw.

He was a warrior god. The pain from both his arms wouldn’t defeat him so easily.

“You should at least give me a hundred million energy stones.”

Baili Haoling spoke calmly.

“That’s impossible!”

Yuan Daliang’s face changed drastically after hearing what Baili Haoling said.

A hundred million energy stones were considered a vast amount.

It was similar to the entire fortune of a small city.

“If you kill me, the warriors here will never let you get away with it!”

Yuan Daliang continued shouting.

That’s right! There are rules in place and the City of God Hotel was owned by one of the God Kings. If Bailing Haoling dared kill him here, she will definitely be killed by the guardians here!

“No. I won’t kill you.”

Baili Haoling shook her head. Then, she looked at the pair of broken limbs on the ground.

“I will only destroy both your arms and then your legs as well.”

Upon hearing what she said, the spectators around shivered in fear.

She was violent!

Even if she chopped off his limbs, he would still be able to connect it back but if they got destroyed, it would be completely over for him!

He could use the artificial limb but it definitely wouldn’t be the same!
