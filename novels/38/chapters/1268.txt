1269 Betrayal

According to what the person said at the beginning, he had to work in Lingxian City for three years before he could have an identity certificate to go to other cities.

But if he integrated these cities and made his city a big city, will this time be shortened?

With this thought, Lin Xiu will soon arrive at Lingxian City!

“What happened?”

But at this moment, the sharp-eyed Lin Xiu clearly saw Lingxian City in the distance, which made his body tremble slightly.

The energy barrier of Lingxian City was gone! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

What made Lin Xiu’s face change, even more, was that the entire Lingxian City had been turned into ruins, as if it had been destroyed.

“How can that be!”

Baili Haoling also clearly saw this scene and the pupils in her eyes shrank slightly.

The energy barrier of Lingxian City is so strong, how could it be destroyed?!

Unless…

At this moment, Lin Xiu didn’t think too much, he jumped up from Xiaobai’s body and flew directly to the front!

Lin Xiu’s speed was very fast and he reached the airspace above Lingxian City in an instant.

That’s right, Lingxian City, the buildings in the entire city were destroyed.

Only the solid city wall was not directly destroyed.

On the surrounding ground, there were many corpses of warriors.

Those were all ordinary warriors living in Lingxian City.

Now, there were corpses everywhere.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu clenched his fists with both hands and his body trembled slightly.

Who did this!!!

At this time, Baili Haoling also flew into the sky with Xiaobai.

Seeing this situation, her face changed greatly.

At this moment, Lin Xiu flew towards the front with a gloomy expression.

He flew directly to the City Lord’s Mansion.

“Cough cough…”

He saw two familiar figures in the courtyard of the City Lord’s Mansion.

Lei Tong and Mr. Pang!

However, Lin Xiu, who saw this scene at this time, was not surprised.

Instead, his face became angrier.

His lips trembled slightly and he wanted to say something, but he couldn’t.

Because Mr. Pang and Lei Tong were here now lying on the ground.

All their hands and feet were cut off!

They were cut into a human sticks.

It’s just that they haven’t completely died yet.

They coughed and spat out blood.

“City… City Lord… I’m sorry…”

Lei Tong and Mr. Pang looked at Lin Xiu’s appearance, coughed a few times and spit out blood, then spoke out with difficulty.

“Who did it?”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s face turned cold.

The vitality of warriors was very tenacious. Although the hands and feet of Mr. Pang and Lei Tong were cut off, for them, as long as their heads were not directly blasted, or the blood was completely drained, they can still survive. for a while.

This person did this on purpose.

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu’s face became even uglier.

“You’re back? It seems that you have dealt with my father and the others.”

And at this moment, a voice came from the front.

This voice sounded a little familiar.

Looking up, Lin Xiu saw Liu Cheng’s figure.

“It’s you.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were cold.

Unexpectedly, it turned out to be him.

And beside him, there were several warriors.

These fighters look familiar.

Take a closer look, weren’t they the guards of his City Lord’s Mansion?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu had completely figured it out.

It was impossible for this man to break through the energy barrier.

...

The only possibility was that this energy barrier was opened from the inside.

Obviously, it was these assholes who did it.

The guards of the original city lord’s mansion looked at Lin Xiu’s cold eyes full of murderous intent at this time and they felt a chill in their hearts.

“Unexpected, right? You think your energy barrier is very strong, but you never imagined that this could happen.”

Liu Cheng said coldly.

There was inevitably a trace of complacency in the words.

After attacking for so long before, he failed to break through the energy barrier, which really made him very angry.

“You also know that all the warriors in the City Lord’s Mansion of Changqing City were killed by me?”

Lin Xiu looked at him with cold eyes and said.

Baili Haoling was in the sky, looking at Liu Cheng, her eyes turned red at this moment.

Now she clenched the two swords tightly, but she didn’t move yet.

...

Waiting for Lin Xiu’s action.

“So what, I can only say that they are too weak.”

Liu Cheng didn’t seem to care at all.

He didn’t even care about the death of his father Liu Mo.

What he cared about was that today he wanted to take revenge and kill Lin Xiu.

“It’s the same with them. People who are too weak can only have their hands and feet cut off by me.”

As he spoke, he squinted at Mr. Pang and Lei Tong and sneered.

“You made them betray me, right?”

Lin Xiu continued to stare at those warriors.

Those warriors looked at Lin Xiu’s eyes and subconsciously took a few steps back.

“Sufficient benefits, they have no reason to refuse.”

Liu Cheng said lightly.

Lin Xiu looked at what they were holding in their hands. They were the weapons he had brought back from Shachang City and asked them to choose.

it’s really ironic.

“kill him.”

Liu Cheng said lightly.

The warriors beside him trembled when they heard Liu Cheng’s words.

They thought that Lin Xiu would definitely die if he went to Changqing City, but who would have thought that Lin Xiu would come back alive?

And it seems that the city lord of Changqing City was killed.

Tell them to attack now, as if they’d dared to.

“If you don’t go, you will die.”

There was killing intent in Liu Cheng’s eyes.

When the frosty sword in his hand was about to move, he saw a large amount of black matter rushing toward him.

what!?

The pupils in Liu Cheng’s eyes shrank slightly.

At this moment, with a movement of his body, he dodged to the other side.

But those warriors who were beside him just now were not so lucky.

Those black substances directly corroded their bodies.

“what!!!”

howling and screaming continued.

The bodies of these warriors were directly corroded and became riddled with holes.

One by one, holes appeared on their bodies.

These people were in pain.

Frantically fell to the ground and struggled.

‘Silence’.

Lin Xiu could control the power of this skill, just to prevent them from dying so happily.

“Next, it’s your turn.”

Lin Xiu’s cold eyes turned to Liu Cheng who was in front of him.

“Is it.”

Liu Cheng snorted coldly and clenched the Frosty Giant Sword in his hand.

Those eyes full of killing intent stared at Lin Xiu.

From his point of view, Lin Xiu has just experienced a big battle and his current physical strength must be very weak.

He is dead meat!
