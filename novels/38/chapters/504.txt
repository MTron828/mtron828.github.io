Chapter 505: The Shadow Squad

The doctor spoke to them after taking a good look at Ye Qingshan.

“Lin Xiu, I think we should look for another place to rest.” Ye Qingshan also heard what the doctor said.

Lin Xiu turned towards Ye Shuanger and her mother and the both of them nodded their heads as well.

“Alright. Let’s rest at a nearby hotel then.” Lin Xiu said finally.

“There are lots of hotels around here.” The doctor quickly added. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He finally let out a breath of relief. If Lin Xiu stayed here and made a scene, it would have caused him a lot of trouble.

Lin Xiu looked at him and did not say anything else.

After settling down at the hotel nearby, Lin Xiu stood by the balcony with his eyes narrowed.

His current situation was….even if he didn’t cause any trouble, trouble would be looking for him anyway.

Plus, what Zhao Xai did a while ago had provoked Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu took out his phone and wanted to call Luo Yue but then he noticed that Luo Yue had turned off her phone.

“Eh?” Lin Xiu was surprised but he thought to himself that it may have been because her phone ran out of battery.

As he thought about it, Lin Xiu messaged Luo Yue and told her that he was with Ye Shuangye. He also told her to come over if it was possible just in case the Chen family started seeking her for revenge. As for him, he would be going to the Zhao family, looking for Zhao Xia.

“Brother Lin Xiu?” Then, Ye Shuanger called.

“What’s wrong?” Lin Xiu turned and smiled at Ye Shuanger who was right in front of him.

“Would you like to rest for a bit?” Ye Shuanger asked.

He had been fighting since early morning and he would be exhausted by now.

The place that they rented now had multiple rooms in it and there was lots of extra space.

“It’s alright. You should go to bed instead since you look tired.” Lin Xiu smiled and subconsciously patted her head.

As Ye Shuanger felt the warmth coming from his hand, she enjoyed it.

“I’m going to go to bed then.” Ye Shuanger told Lin Xiu.

Ye Shuanger looked exhausted after experiencing the incident and it looked like she hadn’t completely recovered from it yet.

“En. Have a good rest.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

After making sure that all of them were resting, Lin Xiu had a determined look in his eyes.

This was one of the hotels that belonged to the Warrior’s Federation and no one would have the guts to barge in here. Plus, their security was tight as well which was why Lin Xiu felt safe.

Then, he picked up the spear and walked towards the exit.

On the other hand, Luo Yue was standing by the balcony in her room, looking at the view outside while being deep in thoughts.

No matter if it was her front view or her side view, Luo Yue looked perfect.

She was still wearing the clothes that Lin Xiu had put on for her. It was a plain, white dress but she looked elegant in it.

As she looked down at the dress that she was wearing, she seemed to have thought of something that caused her to blush and both her ears turned bright red.

But soon, the thought disappeared.

After a while, Luo Yue returned to her room and noticed that her phone, which she had left on the table, was vibrating. She was stunned for a moment before picking it up and noticed that there were multiple unanswered phone calls and a message from Lin Xiu.

After reading the message, Luo Yue took her sword and left the room.

“Were you doing?!” At the same time, in one of the mansions that belonged to the Zhao family, there was a man who looked similar to Zhao Xia, who was screaming at him.

That would be Zhao Xia’s father, Zhao Xiong.

“It’s fine that you took some of the guards out but you’re telling me that a dozen of them died?!”

Zhao Xiong got even angrier after saying that.

The Zhao family might be one of the strongest families in the Bai Di City, but it was still a heartache losing so many powerful warriors in one blow.

“I didn’t know that that bastard would be so powerful…” Zhao Xia said with a murderous look in his eyes.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be able to destroy his well-thought plan so easily.

If he knew about this earlier, he wouldn’t have played the game. Instead, he should have immediately killed Ye Shuanger and her family so that Lin Xiu would turn fuming mad.

As he recalled what happened, he clenched his hand into a fist with his nails digging into his palms.

“This is what you are?! How would you be the next heir of the Zhao family?!” Zhao Xiong looked at his son and asked.

“Father!”

“Forget it.” Zhao Xiong rubbed his temples and continued, “He was able to kill so many of them alone. Who is he…?”

“Just a nobody from a small city.” Zhao Xia would never speak highly of Lin Xiu.

Zhao Xiong thought about it carefully. The men that his son brought were only rank 3 warriors and only rank 4 at best. Lin Xiu was able to kill all of them which showed that he was at least rank 5. It may be a little tricky but they should still be able to handle it.

This was because they had a lot more rank 5 warriors.

“Hmph! We wouldn’t let it go this easily after he had killed so many of my men. I will ask your grandfather for the Shadow Squad, in order to finish him.” Zhao Xiong said to his son.

“Great!” After hearing what his father said, Zhao Xia was delighted.

The Shadow Squad were the best of the Zhao family and most of them are rank 5 warriors. The leader of the team was a rank 6 warrior, the strongest in the Zhao family.

It was also because of this force that made everyone else afraid of the Zhao family.

“This is it?” Lin Xiu said as he looked at the tall, gold metal gates.

He didn’t think that the mansion of the Zhao family would be this big. Plus, it looked like they had really good security.

Lin Xiu walked towards the building but was soon stopped by a man.

“Who are you looking for?” One of the guards asked Lin Xiu in a rude manner.

This was because there was blood stained all over his long spear.

It was obvious that Lin Xiu wasn’t a friendly person.

“Nothing. I am just here to look for Zhao Xia.” Lin Xiu smiled and answered.

Looking for Zhao Xia?!

The guards couldn’t help but frown when they heard Lin Xiu’s answer.

“What’s your name?” The guards weren’t sure who Lin Xiu was and what he wanted, which is why they continued asking.

“My name is Lin Xiu.” He looked forward and soon found Zhao Xia.

“Please inform me. I am sure that he would never forget a friend like me.”
