Chapter 179: Attack!

“I will give you… two rank 5 odd crystals…” Right at this time, Jiang Ya crawled over slowly.

He was still in pain and continued to twitch as he stood back up. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

His gaze towards Lin Xiu was that of fear.

He felt as though all his organs had been injured from the punch, and the intense electric currents in his body made him feel completely numb.

“Captain!” The other members of his team exclaimed out loud at his words.

They were lucky and saw two rank 5 evolved beasts fighting. After the fight, they swept down and collected the spoils of war.

If they gave the two rank 5 odd crystals to Lin Xiu, they were bound to be at the bottom for the freshmen assembly!

“Do you want to die?” Jiang Ya looked at them and wiped away the blood at the corner of his mouth as he asked.

His teammates immediately fell silent when they heard his retort.

Just a few minutes before, they wanted to be the murderers. Who would have thought that Lin Xiu and his team would be stronger than them?

This was the model example of failing to kill and instead turning into the victim.

“Sure.” Lin Xiu was faintly surprised when he heard about the two rank 5 odd crystals. He nodded his head and agreed.

Jiang ya gritted his teeth and endured the pain in his body as he took out two dark blue odd crystals and handed them over to Lin Xiu.

Jiang Ya watched in pain as Lin Xiu took them.

‘We have three rank 5 odd crystals now. We should be faster than the other teams.’

“One minute, you have one minute to disappear from our eyes.” Lin Xiu looked at them and said indifferently.

Zhang Yin and the others let go of the warriors when they heard Lin Xiu’s words.

Sun Wuhai was still on the ground twitching endlessly with a missing arm. He was obviously severely injured

“Quickly, carry him, we’re heading back.” Although Jiang Ya was reluctant and unresigned to it, it was not suitable for them to continue staying.

His internal organs were feeling terrible and Sun Wuhai was reduced to such a state. If they did not receive treatment promptly, even a warrior with a powerful body would be at risk.

Zhang Yin heaved a sigh of relief at their departure. The fight was extremely dangerous.

Jiang Li and Li Ping sat on the ground and gasped for breath.

“Let’s take a break first and replenish our energy.” Lin Xiu stabbed his spear into the ground and sat on a rock. He then took out a vial of nourishment liquid and emptied it into his mouth.

Although it was not tasty, the nourishment liquid contained a lot of energy. One bottle was enough to sustain their bodies for two days.

“You’re not drinking?” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue and asked.

Luo Yue shook her head and jumped onto a big rock and looked into the distance.

She felt the place was strange, as though someone was watching them.

“We have three rank 5 odd crystals now, we should have the most out of the teams, right?” Li Ping slowly walked out from the shadow and asked.

“We can’t be certain, those stronger teams might have already charged into the core of the city.” Lin Xiu shook his head.

He knew that Class 1 Zhuo Qixing was at the peak of rank 5.

His team most probably consisted of peak rank 4 warriors, adding that north campus class 1 was also another strong team, it was difficult for them to compete for first place.

The team continued on after resting for half an hour.

They were at the edge of G17 ruin and the closer they got to the center, the more zombies there and evolved beasts.

This meant even more danger!

Many tall buildings started appearing but they were dilapidated, rundown, and covered with moss.

“The bounty is this guy ah…” Inside a tall building were a few black shadows. They looked down and watched Lin Xiu’s group.

“There are people eyeing us.” Luo Yue looked around and sensed that something was amiss. There were also corpses of zombies and evolved beasts around.

There were wounds on the corpses that were inflicted by warrior weapons.

Crack-

Inside the building, one of the guys took an extremely large laser rifle and aimed it at Lin Xiu’s head as he smiled.

As he pulled on the trigger gently, a large burst of energy converged at the muzzle of the rifle!

In the next moment, he pressed down hard and a laser beam shot right at Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu sensed something and turned to look, only to see a laser beam right at him!

But he had nowhere to dodge!

“Engulf activated, energy absorbed 25, 2000 experience points gained.”

The notification in the system sounded out but Lin Xiu did not have the time to check on it. He was struck by a large force and flew out. He crashed into a wall and caused it to crack.

“What’s going on!?” Zhang Yin and Jiang Li were stupefied, they did not even have the time to react and the situation suddenly turned for the worse.

Luo Yuo was already running over to Lin Xiu.

“Are you alright?”

“I’m fine.” Lin Xiu shook his head and crawled back up, the upper torso of his clothes were charred black.

The laser beam was too strong and actually destroyed his expensive battle robes.

If not for his powerful flesh body, he would have died.

‘It should be a sniper-type laser rifle, only such rifles have that much power in them.’

“I’m going to kill him.” Luo Yue raised her sword and rushed out. But when she appeared on the road, many laser beams shot down at her from all directions. Zhang Yin and the others quickly ran over to Lin Xiu!

Luo Yue avoided the laser beams.

She saw an open building and rushed into it.

“He should be dead, right?” The guy that shot Lin Xiu with the large laser rifle frowned and muttered to himself.
