Chapter 474: He is Lin Xiu!

“What…what a terrifying flame…” The students of Xing Yao Academy saw this scene, the look in their eyes could not help but change drastically.

They all clearly felt that the surrounding air seemed to become extremely hot.

Boom boom——

And in the next moment, these flames in the sky, like meteorites, smashed down from the sky!

The zombies that rushed in frantically were directly hit by the fireballs and they were instantly burnt.

Those zombies that rushed over were hit by those terrifying fireball balls and they died in an instant.

“Is he a warrior sent by the federal government?” At this time, the dean of Xing Yao Academy looked at the scene there and his eyes were full of shock.

This level of strength, he couldn’t do it at all, this was no longer an ordinary warrior, could he be a rank 7 warrior!?

Thinking of this, his body trembled slightly.

Because in Xing Yao City, rank 4 was already invincible.

“Xiaoai, are you okay?” At this moment, Zhang Xiaoai had already ran up and seemed to be a little out of breath.

“I’m fine.” Zhang Xiaoai shook her head when she heard Yang Tian’s words at this time.

“Could you see who is it?” A middle-aged man glanced at Zhang Xiaoai and said aloud.

There was a sea of fire everywhere down there and there were so many zombies, there was no way of seeing who was the warrior who killed the zombies.

At this time, Zhang Xiaoai obviously hadn’t completely walked out of the shadow of fear just now and she was still panting from the run.

“I’m talking to you! Did you hear me!” The middle-aged man suddenly became furious when he saw Zhang Xiaoai not answering him.

“She just came up, can you let her rest!” Yang Tian couldn’t help showing a look of disgust and said coldly.

This middle-aged man was the leader of the school and he has a good relationship with the Tang family. Previously, he was the one sheltering the Tang family brothers when they misbehaved in Xing Yao City.

Moreover, this guy had a role in expelling Lin Xiu from Xing Yao Academy.

“You dare to talk back to me?”

Hearing Yang Tian’s words, the middle-aged man suddenly had a look of disbelief on his face.

“You rubbish, dare to talk back to me, believe it or not, I will expel you!”

“Shut up!!!” The dean of Xing Yao Academy frowned at this time, then shouted.

The middle-aged man gave Yang Tian a hateful look, as if he was saying that he would give him a lesson later, then his eyes continued to look at the scene below.

Although there were a lot of zombies, the warriors below were very strong. A large number of zombies had all been slaughtered.

“Dean, we are now…” After seeing the zombies being slowly cleaned out, a man heaved a sigh of relief and spoke to the dean.

“Stop leaving, the Federation or the Warriors’ Union has sent high-level warriors over. We are safe enough now.” The dean of Xing Yao Academy touched his beard at this time like he had relaxed.

The leaders of the other academies also nodded and looked at the situation below. They were at ease now.

Those terrifying zombie tides seemed to slowly disappear. The entire Xing Yao Academy’s gate was full of stumps and zombies’ heads, which looked very disgusting.

“So little experience.” Lin Xiu split a few zombies in half with the Dark Edge spear in his hand. Seeing the system prompts in his mind, he only had hundreds of thousands of experience and Lin Xiu was a little dissatisfied. He pouted his lips.

For Lin Xiu now, hundreds of thousands of experience was too little.

“It’s not fun.” Luo Yue’s thin-winged long sword made a horizontal split and suddenly a crescent-shaped sword aura slashed out and all the zombies were sliced.

This kind of rank 5 or so zombies was too weak for them.

Soon, as the last zombie was beheaded, two white figures slowly appeared.

“This…” Seeing the silhouettes of these two people, the leaders of the academy above were shocked at this time.

Such a young high-ranking warrior!? 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Isn’t this… Lin Xiu?” Yang Tian rubbed his eyes, then opened them wide and said aloud.

After all, he had known Lin Xiu for a long time and he was the only friend of Lin Xiu in the academy. At this time, he could easily recognize Lin Xiu’s face.

“Lin Xiu!?” Luo Li couldn’t help but exclaim in surprise when he heard the name.

“Why, Teacher Luo, do you know them?” The dean of Xing Yao Academy said in surprise at this time.

He was still in shock. The terrifying strength that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue just demonstrated was obviously the strength that could only be possessed by high-ranking warriors.

But they were too young which the dean found a little unbelievable.

“Yes, it’s Lin Xiu!” Luo Li said a little excitedly at this time. He had no idea that Lin Xiu would come back!

And it was at this critical moment!

He hasn’t seen Lin Xiu for a few months. Lin Xiu seemed to have grown a lot more than when he left and he seemed to have become more determined.

“Lin Xiu!? That’s the useless Lin Xiu from before!?” At this time, when they heard Luo Li’s words, the students around started to exclaim.

Because Lin Xiu could be regarded as a legend in Xing Yao Academy, among the current freshmen in high school, many people have heard Lin Xiu’s story.

He was at the bottom of the academy, but somehow became the top!

He even received a one-star medal from the Union Army.

“You mean, Lin Xiu who was fired by Director Tang?” The Dean of Xing Yao Academy thought for a while, then asked.

“That’s right.” Luo Li nodded and said, looking at the middle-aged man over there, that is, Director Tang.

This Director Tang was glanced at like this by Luo Li and he looked guilty.

Seeing Lin Xiu and Luo Yue who were slowly walking over at this time, his heart jumped slightly.

Because of the Tang family, he advocated that Lin Xiu should be expelled and Lin Xiu was expelled in the end.

But then he seemed to have been recruited by an academy.

“That’s because he made a mistake.” Director Tang said stiffly at this time.

But he had a fear lingering in his heart because the strength that Lin Xiu has shown now was a hundred times stronger than when he left!

This terrifying strength, if Lin Xiu wanted to be calculative…
