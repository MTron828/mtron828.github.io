1158 Heading to the Mines

Mr Pang knew that Lin Xiu had gone to the Tianlan Pavillion.

However, by the looks of Lin Xiu now, it looks like nothing had happened and it surprised Mr Pang.

This was because most of the previous city lords had never returned alive from the Tianlan Pavillion or they would return with a severely wounded state.

“En.”

Lin Xiu sat by the stone table by the garden and poured himself a cup of water.

“From today onwards, there will be no Tianlan Pavilion.”

Lin Xiu took a sip of the water before answering him.

After hearing what was said, Mr Pang was stunned for quite some time as his eyes widened in shock.

“You’re saying…?”

“I have destroyed the Tianxian Pavilion.”

Lin Xiu told Mr Pang about it as if it was nothing.

The aftermath of the ‘Rage’ was hitting him now. As he sat by the stone table, Lin Xiu could feel his body getting extremely weak.

However, he was still trying his best to control the weak feeling coming from within him as he sat by the table.

Mr Pang, who was holding onto the broom and was sweeping the fallen leaves, trembled when heard the news.

The Tianlan Pavilion has been destroyed?!

How would this be possible?!

Deep inside him, he subconsciously felt that this was impossible.

But, from the look on Lin Xiu’s face, it didn’t look like it was a lie.

Perhaps, what Lin Xiu said was true?

As he thought about it, there was an emotional wave that appeared inside Mr Pang’s heart.

The pavilion master of the Tianlan’s pavilion was a powerful warrior god. He also has 2 incredibly powerful warrior gods working for him.

These were the reasons why Tianlan’s pavilion was able to stay afloat in this city for so long.

This was also why the City Lord was also being controlled by the Tianxian Pavilion.

“Oh, Mr Pang! Do you know what these people from the Tianlan Pavilion would do to those people that they caught?”

As Lin Xue thought about it, he asked calmly.

The look in Mr Pang’s eyes changed when he heard what Lin Xiu said.

This man seemed to have found out about something.

“They…..should be sent by those from the Tianlan Pavilion to dig for energy stones.”

Mr Pang thought about it before answering.

It was exactly what those people said.

After hearing what he said, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes after hearing the answer.

“What are these energy stones?”

Lin Xiu still wasn’t sure about the situation here and he continued asking.

Mr Pang was stunned for a moment and he started telling Lin Xiu everything about this planet.

It turns out that there is an energy stone mine near the city. These stones were incredibly powerful. Not only can it be used as a currency but some warriors can also absorb the energy from the stones in order to improve their abilities.

In conclusion, these stones were something incredibly useful.

However, it was difficult to mine these stones and there weren’t many people who were willing to do so. This was why the people from Tianlan Pavilion would capture normal warriors to do so.

“Logically speaking, these mines belong to me?”

Lin Xiu asked calmly.

“You’re right. The mines around this city are usually under the control of the city lord…”

Mr Pang nodded his head.

But, because of how those from the Tianlan Pavilion got involved, most of the mines were under the control of the Tianlan Pavilion.

“Bring me to the mines.”

Lin Xiu could feel the aftermath of ‘Rage’ dissipating from his body. The strength in his body was slowly recovering and he slowly stood up.

Mr Pang was shocked as he quickly nodded his head.

When they walked out of the City Lord Mansion, the entire place looked like it was in a mess.

“That’s him!!”

Suddenly, there were warriors from Tianlan Pavilion that appeared and shouted as they pointed at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frown.

Although he had already killed the master and both the warrior gods of Tianlan Pavilion, there were still lots of members left. Lin Xiu didn’t get to kill all of them.

Soon, Lin Xiu was surrounded by the members of the Tianlan Pavilion.

Mr Pang was shocked to see what was happening.

This was the fear that he had towards the people of Tianlan Pavilion.

“He is the new City Lord!”

The two members of the Tianlan Pavilion who stood by the gate started shouting at Lin Xiu.

As for the rest of them, they held onto their weapons and looked at Lin Xiu cautiously.

“Why? Are you trying to get yourself killed?”

Lin Xiu glanced at them and asked calmly.

“You’re the one who destroyed the Tianlan Mansion! How dare you cause such a scene at the Tianlan Pavilion! You’re dead!”

One of the members screamed in rage.

“Perhaps you still have no idea that the pavilion master has already been killed.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as the corner of his lips deviated upwards.

“Stop listening to his nonsense!”

The warriors started screaming. They would never believe that a newcomer like Lin Xiu would be able to kill the pavilion master of the Tianlan Pavilion.

“Kill him!”

At the same time, the warriors of the Tianlan Pavilion attacked him at the same time!

When Lin Xiu saw what happened, he waved his hands and there was horrifying lightning that appeared. It went straight for the warriors around Lin Xiu!

Sizzling – –

All of the warriors who had rushed towards Lin Xiu were all pushed far away by the horrifying lightning released by Lin Xiu.

Due to the horrible lightning, they screamed in pain.

The weapons on their hands fell onto the ground.

They couldn’t even hold their hands.

As Lin Xiu controlled it with his mind, there were dark blue flames that continuously attacked them. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ahhhh!!!”

These dark blue flames were even scarier than the lightning from before.

The warriors from the Tianlan Pavilion who rushed towards Lin Xiu in rage were suddenly burnt till they turned black before they fell to the ground.

The rest of warriors who watched it from after had a look of fear and disbelief in their eyes.

It has to be noted that everyone knew how evil the people from the Tianlan Pavilion were but they didn’t know that the new City Lord would be able to kill all of the members of it within a blink of an eye.

Plus, he could do it so quickly!

“Most of the members from the Tianlan Pavilion should be dead by now.”

Lin Xiu looked at the bodies of the members of the Tianlan Pavilion and there was no sign of pity in his eyes.

“Let’s go, Mr Pang.”

“Sure…Of course.”

Mr Pang quickly came back to his senses and quickly nodded his head.

Deep inside him, he finally believed that Lin Xiu had killed the pavilion master of the Tianlan Pavilion.

Plus, even the mansion of the Tianlan Pavilion has been destroyed by Lin Xiu?!

It has to be noted that the Tianlan Mansion was the most important building as it was where all the meetings were held.

With Mr Pang’s guidance, Lin Xiu headed to the other side of the city.

Most of the greeneries in the warrior god realm were huge and there was a rich amount of energy in the air which was very comforting.

After walking for some time, Lin Xiu finally heard a loud noise that came from a distant away.
