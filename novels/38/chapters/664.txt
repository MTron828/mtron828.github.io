Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

Boom —

Just when Lin Xiu’s spear was about to reach Nan Huang grandfather’s head, there was a soft groan. Lin Xiu looked at his chest and he could see that there was a sword that had pierced through his chest.

‘When Nan Huang’s grandfather saw what happened, he quickly reacted and jumped backwards.

Seeing how there was still lightning all over Lin Xiu’s spear, the old man suddenly felt chills running down his spine.

There were also droplets of cold sweat all over his forehead.

Almost. He was almost killed by the young brat.

“HMPH! You might have used the forbidden drugs but you are still a low rank warrior!”

The elder from the Jiang family had changed his weapon into a long sword and had thrusted it into Lin Xiu’s chest.

Lin Xiu was so focused on killing Nan Huang’s grandfather that he didn’t notice the elder from the Jiang family that had hidden his aura, allowing the old man to pierce the sword through his chest.

“You should be the one who’s dead!”

Right at that moment, the elder from the Jiang family did not give any chance for Lin Xiu to recover. He wanted to pull out the sword that was in Lin Xiu’s chest so that he could attack him again!

Boom —

However, Lin Xiu’s hand immediately grabbed onto the sword that was through his chest!

The sword had sliced through Lin Xiu’s palm and it was caught on his bone.

The old man opened his eyes wide as he did not expect for Lin Xiu to do so.

They always say that the fingers are connected to the heart. This would have been extremely painful!

Just as he was still having trouble pulling out the sword, Lin Xiu took his spear and aimed it towards the old man behind him!

The spear was coming at him at a quick speed. The elder from the Jaing family wanted to dodge it but he had no time!

The only thing that he could do was release his ‘Yuan’!

But, just as he was about to do so, Lin Xiu’s spear had already gone through it and the spear went through his head!

Lin Xiu did not give him the chance to escape.

“You came here on your own. Dumbass.”

Lin Xiu snorted and spat out a mouthful of blood.

He took a look at the sword in his chest and grabbed the handle with his left hand. With one strong pull, he managed to pull out the sword.

As soon as the sword was out, there was a large amount of blood everywhere!

“Nowit’s your turn.”

Even so, Lin Xiu’s face was still cold with no emotions. He glared at the old man before him and wanted to continue fighting.

Nan Huang’s grandfather was truly surprised when he saw what happened.

Even the elder from the Jiang family had died! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

All of them died because of Lin Xiu and he suddenly felt goosebumps all over his body.

Lin Xiu was indeed a dangerous man.

“A bunch of rubbish!”

He looked around and noticed that the warriors that belonged to their families were all staring at Lin Xiu but none of them dared to fight him.

Lin Xiu had just easily killed two rank 9 warriors. With what has happened, it caused a huge impact on the warriors who witnessed it.

Lin Xiu picked up his spear. With blood trickling down his body, he was still walking towards Nan Huang’s grandfather.

“What do you think you’re doing?!”

As Lin Xiu walked towards him, he was starting to feel frightened!

Lin Xiu was now like a monster, a devil. Not only did he kill two rank 9 warriors who were as powerful as Nan Huang’s grandfather, there were also many bodies around them who were all killed by Lin Xiu.

He even destroyed all of the drones and fighter aircraft.

“want you dead.”

Lin Xiu continued walking forward as he said coldly.

Damn it!

Nan Huang’s grandfather felt threatened by how scary Lin Xiu was. He thought that Lin Xiu had not released all of his energy and would be able to kill him with one shot.

This was why he quickly moved backwards.

He always thought that Lin Xiu was only this powerful because of the forbidden drugs.

He only had to make sure that he could last until the effects of the forbidden drugs are over. He would be able to kill Lin Xiu without any risk.

Hmm?

But, at the very next moment, Nan Huang’s grandfather who was still moving backwards noticed that Lin Xiu had stopped moving. He stood right on the ground.

“Attack him!”

Nan Huang’s grandfather had no idea what Lin Xiu was up to and he immediately screamed at the warriors around.

When the warriors heard what the old man said, they were worried as they knew that there was a possibility that Lin Xiu would kill them.

They would die just like how Lin Xiu had killed the other warriors. It was just like cutting grass.

However, they had no other choice. If they didn’t do as they were told, they would end up in a more dangerous situation. Their families would be involved as well!

Therefore, all of them rushed towards Lin Xiu with their weapons!

Boom —

‘As soon as their weapons touched Lin Xiu, his figure turned into ashes and there was nothing left.

“He’s gone?!

‘When the other warriors saw what happened, everyone was completely shocked.

“WHAT?!”

Nan Huang’s grandfather was completely shocked. He leaped forward to see what it was and he realised that Lin Xiu’s body had completely disappeared.

“Damn it!”

By the time he understood what had happened, he realised that this wasn’t Lin Xiu’s actual figure. The real Lin Xiu was already gone!

“Search for him! Do it now! He won’t be far!”

Nan Huang’s grandfather screamed.

He felt embarrassed. He was afraid of that young man!

If he guessed it correctly, Lin Xiu was already at his last stretch. He could have killed Lin XIu but because two rank 9 warriors had died, he felt frightened.

With the command given, the warriors headed into different directions looking for Lin Xiu.

They were all trying their best to look for Lin Xiu. They knew that it would be considered a job well done if they found him!

“Cough Cough…”

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared in another alley.

This was a secluded area. Plus, the three families had already chased off civilians who were nearby and so, there was no one around.

Lin Xiu’s body was completely covered with blood. As he coughed, there was even more blood coming out.

Pain. He could feel pain all over his body.

The elder from the Jiang family had completely hidden his aura which was why he got the chance to sneak an attack on Lin Xiu. Lin Xiu didn’t even get to activate the ‘Mirror Image’ when he got stabbed.

Although he managed to kill the old man, he was also covered in wounds as well.

He didn’t even know if his heart had been stabbed.

Then, Lin Xiu noticed a black figure standing right in front of him.. The look in his eyes changed as he grabbed onto his spear!
