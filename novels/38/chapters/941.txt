Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“City lord…”

Su Jian looked at one of the middle-aged and his body shivered uncontrollably.

The city lord of the Sand River City was the strongest warrior alice.

A few years ago, he had already become one of the strongest amongst all the other respected warriors.

As for the other two elders, one of them was Xu Ye from the Xu family and Jiang Chong from the City Lord Council.

All of them were respected warriors.

The strongest of them in the Sand River City were all gathered here today.

“Hmph!”

The Su family and the Wu family have accepted help from others and betrayed us! Do you admit to your crime?!”

Nalan Rong, the city lord of the Sand River City looked at the warriors from both the Su and Wu family.

“It was the Xu family who wanted to kill us first!”

Wu Jie screamed in rage to the men in the sky.

“Nalan Rong! You were so close to the Wu family but I didn’t think that you were a fake!”

......

“On your knees!”

After hearing what Wu Jie said, Nalan Rong looked pissed and roared in rage.

At the same time, Wu Jie felt a strong pressure coming from above him.

He was about to kneel on the ground because of the pressure.

Suddenly, Lin Xiu, who was standing next to Wu Jie, waved his hand.

The intense pressure that he felt earlier, forcing him onto the ground suddenly realised that the force had disappeared!

Nalan Rong couldn’t help but frown when he saw what happened.

“Where are you from?”

Nalan Rong stared at Lin Xiu and asked in a cold tone.

He could feel that Lin Xiu’s abilities were extraordinary.

He should be a respected warrior.

“You! You are the brat that killed my grandson!”

Xu Ye stared at Lin Xiu as he screamed. Then, he rushed to the ground!

Pfft – –

He was travelling at a very fast speed. The rest of the warriors didn’t even see him moving but the next second, he was already standing right in front of Lin Xiu!

His right hand was like the claw of an eagle and it was headed towards Lin Xiu’s neck.

He was about to break Lin Xiu’s neck!

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered. With a slight movement, he quickly dodged the claw.

Xu Ye’s attack missed its target.

Crack – –

At the same time, Lin Xiu clenched onto his fist and it was covered with lightning before throwing it towards Xu Ye.

Xu Ye’s pupil shivered and released his ‘sphere’.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu’s fist immediately landed on Xu Ye’s ‘sphere’.

With a huge explosion, Xu Ye’s body flew to the distance!

Even with his ‘sphere’s released, he still couldn’t block the impact of Lin Xiu’s fist!

“Damn it!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Xu Ye’s body moved a few steps backwards in order to steady herself.

He raised his head and looked at Lin Xiu with eyes filled with rage.

The man was able to give such a huge impact to him even with his ‘sphere’ released.

“Leave.”

Lin Xiu looked at Nalan Rong and Jiang Chong and said to Wu Jie and the rest of them.

“Leave!”

Wu Jie understood as well. The battle after this was amongst the respected warriors.

It wasn’t a suitable place for warrior kings to stay here.

Plus, they wouldn’t be able to help Lin Xiu at all. They might even be a burden to Lin Xiu.

“Brother…..young master, please be careful.”

Wu Jie said respectfully towards Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Where do you think you’re going?!”

Xu Ye screamed in rage as a sourcemark appeared on his forehead.

Boom –

He activated his source mark energy and the entire ground started shaking!

The entire ground sank as well in a blink of an eye!

The entire Su Mansion immediately collapsed!

“Let’s go!”

Wu Jie screamed at the crowd immediately.

They had cultivated levitation skills and most of them would be able to float in the air and leave very soon.

“You shall all die!”

Nalan Rong gave a cold laugh as he saw the warriors that were with Wu Jie.

He gathered his energy and concentrated them on his left hand.

At that moment, there were large numbers of horrifying flames that started falling off the sky.

Boom Boom – –

These flames were all headed towards the other warriors who were with Wu Jie.

Crap!

Wu Jie looked awful when he saw what was coming from the sky.

The skills released from these respected warriors were definitely much scarier than theirs.

These warriors have reached the peak of a respected warrior and they would never be able to protect themself from these flames.

Even with their ‘sphere’ realised, they would all be dead!

“You want to play with fire too?”

At the same time, Lin Xiu who was on the ground, sneered coldly.

Lin Xiu waved his left hand and the long spear appeared on his hand.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu swung his long spear and there were flashes of flames released from the spear.

These flames were dark blue flames.

Then, all of the flames turned into flaming birds.

The flaming birds headed towards the flames that were about to hit the rest of the warriors.

The flames released by the respected warriors earlier had all disappeared!

However, the dark blue flames were still there and they soon gathered together.

They formed a huge flaming phoenix and it turned around, flying towards Nalan Rong!

What’s happening?!

Nalan Rong was shocked as well when he saw what was coming at him.

His own flames did not get the opportunity to kill Wu Jie and they were all destroyed by the flames that were released by this man?

“Go!”

Lin Xiu warned Wu Jie again.

With Lin Xiu’s command, Wu Jie and the rest of them quickly flew into the other direction.

At the same time, for Nalan Rong and Jiang Chong, they quickly released their ‘sphere’ when they saw the flaming phoenix headed towards them!

Boom –

The fire phoenix landed on their ‘sphere’ and there were continuous explosive noises.

The ‘sphere’s that they released were all covered with the dark blue flame.

The dark blue flames were extremely horrifying.

They could clearly feel that their ‘sphere’s were melting!

“City lord, this brat is too vicious! We have to attack with full force!”

Jiang Chong screamed loudly.

“Sure!”

Nalan Rong nodded his head and activated his source energy in order to strengthen his ‘sphere’.

At that moment, he rushed to the ground!

He wanted to rush out of the flames that were surrounding him.

“You brat! You shall suffer!!”

Xu Ye, on the other side, exploded in rage.

He leaped upwards and as he rushed towards Lin Xiu, he released his domain forces!

His domain forces were extremely unique and once he had it activated, he would be able to kill Lin Xiu!
