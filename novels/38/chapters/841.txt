“Okay, you guys can go after taking the crystals.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Mr. An waved his hand at this time.

The three men in black at the back, walked over to Lin Xiu and the others with items in their hands at the same time.

Lin Xiu took the box that one of the men in black handed him.

Inside the box were life crystals.

“Okay, you’ve got your things, quickly leave.”

At this time, Mr. An waved his hand and said.

It was obvious that an evacuation order was issued.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu spoke to Luo Yue who was beside him.

Luo Yue nodded, and then left directly.

“En? You guys are out?”

When they just walked outside, they happened to meet Chen Dong.

“Mr. Chen, that old man An, why did he want the ghost ship?”

Jiang Ying still spoke out of curiosity at this time.

“Well...it’s not that I can’t say.”

Chen Dong was startled, hesitated for a moment, and said aloud.

“Previously, that the King warrior brought the treasures on the ghost ship and there was healing holy water, which is said to be the divine water that cures all diseases.”

Chen Dong said.

“He wants to save someone?”

“En, Mr. An’s wife is seriously ill and has been in a coma for many years. Even using the life crystal will not help.”

“This is his only hope, but it’s too late. Before we came back, his wife had passed away.”

“I see.”

Jiang Ying said in a low voice.

“But it’s useless even if we find the ghost ship. After all, the contents inside have already disappeared.”

Chen Dong spread his hands helplessly and said.

“Okay, everyone, goodbye!”

Chen Dong looked at the time on his watch, waved his hand, and left.

“Jiang Ying, wait a minute.”

Just when Jiang Ying was about to say goodbye, Lin Xiu said aloud.

“What’s the matter?”

Jiang Ying said curiously.

“That book, if you find anything, tell me, okay?”

Lin Xiu said.

Jiang Ying was startled, but quickly reacted.

“Sure.”

After leaving her contact information, Jiang Ying waved goodbye.

Namir Planet, these giants must have come from the Namir planet.

He just didn’t know how the people from Namir Planet came here.

“Let’s go too.”

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and said with a smile.

“En.”

The two came to a green grass outside the Dark City.

Sitting on the grass, Luo Yue handed the life crystal to Lin Xiu.

“you...”

Luo Yue shook her head and said that she didn’t need it.

Lin Xiu was not pretentious and took out the six life crystals at this time.

According to what I have seen, the method of absorbing the life crystal is to swallow it directly into the body.

Looking at the six life crystals in his hand, Lin Xiu hesitated for a while, and put them into his mouth one by one.

Gollum—

These life crystals, as soon as they entered the mouth, seemed to turn into smooth fruit jelly, and instantly entered his stomach.

A warm feeling instantly spread throughout his entire body.

It was very comfortable as if the whole body was warmed up.

At this time, Lin Xiu had already crossed his legs and closed his eyes.

The life crystal can restore some of the vitality that has been overdrawn before, and repair some wounds in the body.

This kind of thing is something that can’t be found.

The old man probably had a hard time collecting these life crystals.

Soon, a faint blue light burst out from Lin Xiu’s body.

Luo Yue sat quietly beside Lin Xiu, looking at Lin Xiu without saying anything.

Time passed quickly, and the vitality in those life crystals was being continuously absorbed by Lin Xiu’s body.

At this time, with the continuous absorption of life crystals, Lin Xiu’s complexion became better and better.

After some time, when Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, it was already nighttime.

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu who opened her eyes, and she was surprised.

Because of the current Lin Xiu felt different from before.

It’s not a change in appearance, but a change in temperament.

The whole person seems to have become stronger!

“Why do you look at me like that?”

“Am I too handsome?”

Lin Xiu, who had just opened his eyes, laughed at Luo Yue.

Luo Yue rolled her eyes at Lin Xiu, and then handed Lin Xiu a roasted animal leg.

Beside this, Luo Yue has already started a fire, making the surroundings bright.

“Delicious.”

Lin Xiu was also a little hungry. After biting hard on his stovepipe, he said with a smile.

“No one is snatching that from you.”

Luo Yue had a smile in her eyes, and said in a soft voice.

“By the way, you just broke through?”

Luo Yue seemed to have thought of something, and then said subconsciously.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded. At this moment, he felt that his entire body was extremely comfortable!

After entering the system interface, he could see his attributes:

Potential Points: 60

Respected warrior, he has been promoted to the level of Respected warrior!

After being promoted to the level of Respected warrior, Lin Xiu looked around and felt different.

It’s like when he was looking at things, he could magnify things by many times and see very clearly if he wanted to.

Moreover, the sense of power from the whole body made Lin Xiu even more surprised.

The life crystals made up for a lot of the vitality that he lost at that time, and cured some of the diseases in the body.

Which allowed Lin Xiu, who should have broken through a long time ago, succeed this time in one fell swoop!

Now, he has become a Respected warrior!

Taking a closer look at the new title of Respected warrior, in addition to the ability to inherit the previous title of King warrior, he also gained a new skill:

‘Dazzling Mark- Wind’: Your attack will come with the wind attribute, with a 10% chance to trigger a wind-based skill.

Looking at this introduction, Lin Xiu’s eyes were slightly surprised.

It seemed to be quite strong, but he wasn’t sure what the actual effect would be.

Right now, what Lin Xiu wanted to see the most was new skill, what is the use of ‘Skill Enhancement’!

After all, it is a skill only possessed at the Respected warrior level!
