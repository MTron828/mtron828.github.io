Wang Qiang and Wu Hao nodded their heads before getting the rest of the warriors.

Most of them were covered in dust because of the battle.

There were also some who were injured.

There were only less than 100 of them left.

When they looked at Lin Xiu, all of them were confused as to what he wanted to do.

“It must have been tough just now.”

“These are your rewards.”

Lin Xiu waved his right hand and there were a large number of odd crystals that appeared.

Then, the odd crystals flew into their palms.

The warriors subconsciously caught the odd crystals when they saw how the odd crystals were flying towards them.

As they took a closer look, all of them were shocked.

“This…”

Their bodies trembled as they held onto the odd crystal that contained a vast amount of energy.

A saint beast odd crystal!

Plus, it was one that was much stronger than the ordinary saint beast odd crystals!

“Master, this…”

Wu Hao and Wang Qiang each had two odd crystals.

Their eyes were widened in shock as well.

“These are for you.”

Lin Xiu explained about the crystals.

“Thank you, City Lord!”

One of the warriors finally came back from the shock and he thanked Lin Xiu gratefully.

“Thank you, City Lord!!”

The other warriors finally came back to their senses and screamed simultaneously.

Due to how excited they were, all of them were screaming on top of their lungs.

This caused the entire city to shake vigorously.

“Absorb these crystals here then.”

Lin Xiu told his men to take rest and absorb the crystals that he had just given them.

“Yes, Sir!”

The other warrior quickly answered him with excitement.

Then, they sat cross legged on the ground and started absorbing the energy from the odd crystals.

These warriors were different from Lin Xiu. They had to ingest the crystal first before completely absorbing them.

“Brother Lin, you are being too generous.”

Wu Hao said helplessly to Lin Xiu.

There were so many odd crystals given to them and Lin Xiu was giving them to these warriors without any hesitation. There weren’t many people who could do the same.

Even the Bai family would find this impossible.

“It’s nothing.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

These saint beast odd crystals were useless to Lin Xiu as they wouldn’t bring much effect.

Killing sage warriors would bring more EXP than these odd crystals.

His progress bar now has grown to 81%

He only needed 19% to get to the next level.

Then, he would be level 70 and he would be a warrior god!

As he thought about it, Lin Xiu started getting excited.

Then, Wu Hao received a call and he frowned.

“What’s wrong?”

Lin Xiu asked subconsciously when he saw how Wu Hao was frowning.

“The Dark Shadows have just received news that the Bai Family are building a teleportation device in Star City.”

“The warriors today came from that city.”

Wu Hao reported it to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded his head while listening to him.

The Star City wasn’t far from this city and it would be more difficult for the warriors of the Bai family to directly get here.

This was why it wasn’t surprising that they built a teleportation device at Star City/

“Wang Qiang, help me with something.”

Lin Xiu looked at Wang Qiang as he thought about something.

“Yes, master?”

Wang Qiang awaited Lin Xiu’s instructions.

“Give these odd crystals to the warriors in Bai Di City.”

“Distribute them according to their levels.”

Lin Xiu then passed dozens of odd crystals to Wang Qiang as he told Wang Qiang what to do.

“Sure.”

Wang Qiang nodded his head as he took the odd crystals.

“Also, tell Yong Yuan and Elder Qiang that as soon as they have completely absorbed the energy from these odd crystals, they can start attacking the allies of the Bai family who are closer to them. Get rid of all of them.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he thought about his plan.

There wasn’t much time left for him to be on this planet.

As soon as he becomes a warrior god, he would be taken away by Elder Ye.

So, before that happens, he has to get rid of the Bai Family first!

“Yes, Sir!”

“Oh, you can head back on the Angel.”

Lin XIu thought about it before suggesting it to Wang Qiang.

They were indeed in a dangerous situation now.

Although Wang Qiang was already a sage warrior, it still hasn’t been that long.

Lin Xiu and Wang Qiang then walked over to the Angel that had been shot to the ground with.

“Looks like it’s damaged…”

Wang Qiang looked at the Angel that was on the ground.

As they looked at it, there was a dent that was formed in the centre of the Angel.

The dent was exactly near the Angel’s core. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

It seems like the power core of the Angel has been disturbed by the dent in the centre.

Lin Xiu could feel it as well that his connection with the angel has been disconnected.

He could no longer control the Angel.

“Should I get Wu Hao men to fix it?”

Wang Qiang hesitated for a moment before asking.

The men that Wu Hao brought along with one of the best on the planet.

“No need. I’ll give it a try.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

With that said, Lin Xiu stood by the side of the Angel’s body.

Then, he reached out towards the dent.

Then, with the energy release from Lin Xiu, the dent on the Angel was slowly recovering to its original state.

Wang Qiang, who was looking from a distance, stared at it with his eyes widened. He was looking shocked.

‘Time Control’.

Lin Xiu was now using a sage warrior skill.

He was trying to turn back time on a small scale.

He was turning it back to when the Angel had not been destroyed.

Then, there were cold sweats formed on Lin Xiu’s forehead.

‘Time Control’ was something that was exhausting.

It probably would get better once he became a warrior god.

“Huuuuu~”

Soon, Lin Xiu let out a breath of relief and the area that has been destroyed earlier, reverted to its original state.

“Great.”

Lin Xiu controlled it with his mind and now, he was in control of the Angel once again.

Boom – –

Suddenly, there was a bright purple glow that appeared in its eyes.

Then, the Angel slowly got up.

“Previously, Elder Ye said that she can be evolved…”

Lin Xiu thought about something as he stared at the Angel.

He hesitated for a moment and took out the remaining odd crystals in his expansion space.

These were saint beasts odd crystals and the energy that they contained were huge.

Lin Xiu then placed the off crystals into the power core.

Boom boom – –

Soon, something happened to the crystals and there was a strange noise coming from it.
