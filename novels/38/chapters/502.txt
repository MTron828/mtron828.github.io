Chapter 503: Burn!

“Huhuhu…”

Ye Shuanger looked down at Lin Xiu from above. She wanted to tell him something but she was unable to do so.

But from her eyes, it was obvious that she wanted Lin Xiu to leave this place immediately.

Hua La – Hua La – –

After taking a good look at her, he noticed that there were lots of dry woods that were placed beneath her feet.

Bakk – –

With the loud crack, there was a figure that appeared on the balcony that was on the other two buildings near them.

“Lin Xiu, quickly leave!”

Then, a familiar voice came from that direction and when he looked closely, the person that were tied on the balcony were Ye Shuanger’s parents!

Their condition was the same as their daughter’s. Beneath their feet, there was a huge number of dried woods

Ye Shuanger’s mother was about to say something when the man next to her shut her up with tape.

“Tsktsk…..you have already killed several men of mine since you got here. Looks like you are quite powerful.” Right at that moment, an eye-piercing voice rang from above.

As he looked up there was a large group of men right next to Ye Shuanger and her parents.

Especially the one right next to Ye Shuanger; it was someone familiar.

“It’s you.”

When Lin Xiu saw who it was, his eyes narrowed in anger.

That bastard was none other than Zhao Xia!

He didn’t think that this bastard would be here and did such things.

“That’s right. It’s me. I bet you didn’t expect this, huh?!” Zhao Xia asked with a twisted expression on his face.

“Don’t you know where you are? This is my zone! This is Bai Di City!” Zhao Xia screamed in rage.

He really hated Lin Xiu.

“Right … .where’s that woman?! The one that cut off my finger!” As he thought of Luo Yue, Zhao Xia turned even mad.

“Forget about it. You will be first and she will follow soon after. I will make sure that both of you get reunited…..All of you shall die in Bai Di City!!!!”

After screaming like a mad dog, Zhao Xia let out a cold laugh and waved his hands.

At the same time, there were three men that brought in a fire torch on each balcony.

“Let’s play a game.” Zhao Xia looked down at Lin Xiu as he snorted.

“One minute later, we will light up these woods beneath them. You should start deciding who to save first.”

After hearing what he said, the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed.

From what he saw, the woods that had been placed beneath them were covered with diesel and as soon as it came into contact with the fire, it would definitely burn up really quickly.

But, with only one minute, it may be sufficient for him to save Ye Shuanger alone. As for Ye Shuanger’s parents, both of them were tied onto the balcony on two separate buildings.

If he wanted to save all three of them in one minute, it would be impossible.

In the end, he would only be able to save one and the other two would be burnt to death.

Lin Xiu frowned. As for Zhao Xia, he knew that Lin Xiu would be in a dilemma and when he saw the difficult look on Lin Xiu, he put on a hysterical laugh.

This was what he wanted to see. He wanted to see Lin Xiu’s expression when Lin Xiu was forced to choose.

In fact, he had purposely planned it in such a way that Lin Xiu would watch the other two burn to death.

Plus, the men that were up there were all warriors. No matter which building he chose, he would definitely be killed by the warriors!

“Game starts. 59… 58…” Zhao Xia started counting as he took out the fire torch.

Ye Shuanger, who was right next to him, widened her eyes in shock. She struggled, trying to escape but her entire body was tied by the ropes that she couldn’t move and there was a large amount of wood right beneath her.

“Hehe…..do you think that he’ll pick you? If he did, your parents would definitely be burnt to death!” Zhao Xia spoke towards Ye Shuanger with an evil look on his face.

Then, he suddenly noticed that Lin Xiu, who was on the ground just a second ago, had suddenly disappeared!

“When the brat gets here, kill him immediately!” When he noticed that Lin Xiu was gone, his pupil constricted uncontrollably and he screamed towards the men in the other buildings.

There were dozens of warriors on the other buildings and most of them were powerful, strong warriors; even if Lin Xiu was capable, it would still be impossible for him to deal with so many of them!

When Zhao Xia counted till 29, it suddenly skipped to 3!

“Did you really think that I would give you a minute? Hahaha… You shall die now! I want you to watch her getting burnt to death!” Zhao Xia laughed with a twisted expression and threw the torch towards Ye Shuanger.

Koong Loong — –

The dry woods beneath Ye Shuanger’s feet were instantly lit up!

As for her parents who were in the other buildings, looking at the scene in fear and shock. They were trying to escape like crazy but the ropes around them had been tied too tightly and it was impossible for them to loosen them.

When they saw how their daughter was about to be burnt to ash, there were tears in their eyes.

“HEHEHEHE…..I’m wondering what his face would look like by the time he gets here and sees that you are burnt as a piece of charcoal.” Zhao Xia looked at Ye Shuanger who was surrounded by the burning flame and laughed out loud.

Boom – – 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

However, at the instant, it felt as if there was a strong wind that attacked them. Before any of them realized what was happening, Ye Shuanger, who was in the middle of the burning flame, suddenly disappeared!

By the time Zhao Xia came back to his senses when he saw the missing person, his facial expression completely changed.

“Are you alright?” Lin Xiu’s figure has somehow appeared on the corner of the balcony.

A small part of Ye Shuager’s clothing caught on fire but Lin Xiu easily got rid of it.

Then, Lin Xiu removed the tape that was on her mouth.

“Brother Lin Xiu!” Ye Shuanger exclaimed and there were already tears rolling down on both sides of her cheeks.

Lin Xiu picked up his spear and cut off the ropes that had been tied around her body.

Perhaps it was because she had been tied up for a very long time, Ye Shuanger’s body felt weak and she couldn’t stand up on her own.

“Quick!!!! Burn them!!” When Zhao Xia saw Lin Xiu, he gritted his teeth! He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be so quick.

He roared uncontrollably.

“Mum! Dad!” After hearing Zhao Xia’s roar, Ye Shuanger, who was weak, struggled to stand.

“Don’t worry. I’m here.” Lin Xiu still looked extremely calm.

Then, he placed his left arms around Ye Shuanger’s waist, and then his body let out a bright glow.

Even Ye Shuanger’s entire body was covered by that bright light!
