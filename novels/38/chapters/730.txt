Chapter 731 Robbery

This man was so vicious.

The Purple Gold Skill Card was a rare Skill Card even on this Marqi planet.

One’s only crime was only to carry a jade. “I don’t have it.”

Lin Xiu spread his hands helplessly and said.

“Bring it to me!”

Naturally, the man wouldn’t believe Lin Xiu’s words, so he roared loudly at this time.

The short knife in his hand seemed to press harder on Lin Xiu’s neck.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s eyes changed, his hands moved violently and he exerted force on his arm.

Ka la–

With a crisp sound, his right hand was directly broken by Lin Xiu.

At this moment, the short knife in his hand also fell directly to the ground.

“What!!!”

The intense pain caused him to let out a scream.

Just now, Lin Xiu’s speed was so fast that he didn’t even react at all.

At this time, his other hand wanted to attack Lin Xiu, but Lin Xiu kicked him and kicked him out.

He hit the wall at the back heavily.

A mouthful of blood spat out from his lips.

Lin Xiu’s kick made him feel like his heart had burst.

It was too late to talk about it, what happened just now happened in an instant.

And the other two men also reacted at this time and attacked Lin Xiu with the short swords they were holding!

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly, looking at the short knives in their hands, because the source strength was covering them, they were flashing purple light. He dodged even before the short knives slashed his body.

Rank 9 warriors, these three were rank 9 warriors.

However, the rank 9 warriors were not enough for Lin Xiu now.

Crackling

When Lin Xiu dodged the daggers stabbed by the two men, he seized the opportunity and directly attacked one of the men’s body with his fist!

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s fist emitted silver lightning and the surrounding air seemed to be burnt and a burning smell appeared.

The man looked at the fist attacked by Lin Xiu, his eyes widened and he clearly felt the destructive power of the punch. Subconsciously, he tried to block it with his elbow.

Boom–

But just as Lin Xiu’s fist smashed over, a huge blast of air sounded.

His hands exploded!

“What!!!”

Looking at his broken hands, he let out a huge scream. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The last man originally wanted to attack with the short knife in his hand, but when he saw this scene, his body trembled.

In this short moment, his two companions were beaten by Lin Xiu like this.

What kind of warrior is he?!

“Do you want to try it too?”

Lin Xiu glanced at the man and said lightly.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s eyes looking at him, he couldn’t help but back up.

“Ah!!!”

However, he just retreated slightly and his eyes were full of killing intent as he roared and attacked Lin Xiu with the short knife in his hand.

And at this time, a ray of light burst out from his body, then covered the ground.

Domain!?

Lin Xiu raised his brows, standing still and didn’t move.

At this moment, a few figures exactly like this man appeared around him. Is it possible to create a domain of avatars?

Lin Xiu waved his right hand and at this moment, a white light appeared, directly covering the domain on the ground.

The avatar that the man summoned through the power of the domain disappeared in an instant!

How can it be!

His face changed greatly.

But he was greeted by Lin Xiu’s fist full of lightning!

“Tell me, where did you hear the news?”

Lin Xiu glanced at the three of them, then said lightly.

One’s bones were shattered by Lin Xiu, the other’s hands were blown up and the last man still had a lot of electric light on his body, twitching constantly on the ground, as if he was going crazy.

But they just kept screaming and screaming from their mouths and didn’t say a word.

Lin Xiu’s brows wrinkled at this time, these people didn’t seem to plan to say anything.

Boom–

And at this moment, there was a sound on the other side of the door and someone opened it.

“The sound comes from within!”

Taking a closer look, it seems that the manager of the hotel and the security staff.

The hotel has spare keys. As soon as they came in, they saw the scene on the ground and their expressions changed greatly.

Those security guards even pointed their laser guns at Lin Xiu who was standing over there.

“Let me explain, they wanted to assassinate

me.”

Lin Xiu spread his hands helplessly and said. “Are you… Mr. Lin?”

The hotel manager looked at the information on the microcomputer in his hand and said to Lin Xiu.

“That’s right.”

“I want to say, the security measures of the best hotel in your Ice and Snow City are so weak, you guys actually let these people in.”

Lin Xiu nodded and said aloud.

“Isn’t this Zhang Xieyong, a D-level wanted criminal…” A security guard said in surprise as if he knew one of the men.

“Really!?”

When the hotel manager heard the man’s words, the expression in his eyes couldn’t help but change.

“Mr. Lin, I’m really sorry that such a thing happened.”

After confirming the identities of those people, the hotel manager said apologetically to Lin Xiu.

“Never mind.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

“I’ll help you change to another room now and contact the government immediately to deal with it.” The hotel manager said quickly.

Lin Xiu nodded and didn’t make anything difficult.

After changing to another room, Lin Xiu turned on the computer of his hotel, then logged on to the local warrior website of Ice and Snow City.

After these few days, Lin Xiu already knew that every city has its own warrior forum.

Usually, anything that happened would be discussed in the warrior forum.

Sure enough, the Ice and Snow City’s warrior forum looked very lively.

Among them, the most attention was on the recent matter of the Legacy land.

It was said that the inheritance of King warrior was obtained by Zhang Zhiheng of the Divine Punishment Guild, but Zhang Zhiheng disappeared.

Seeing this information, the corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched.

Zhang Zhiheng should be dead under the snow by now.

Continuing to browse, Lin Xiu found that there was indeed news about the Purple gold Skill Card.

“A warrior from Earth has obtained three purple-gold skill cards.”

Lin Xiu clicked into this post, which contained Lin Xiu’s information and even Lin Xiu’s photo.

The photo was taken while on the snow.

“So it’s you.”
