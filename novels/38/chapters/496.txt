Chapter 497: Unbelievably Strong?

“However, the higher the level of odd crystals, the slower the extraction speed.” As if knowing what Lin Xiu was thinking, Luo Yue said aloud at this time.

“I see…” Lin Xiu said a little frustrated.

If the energy of an advanced odd crystal could be absorbed so easily, it would be really amazing.

“‘Absorb’ is very special, it isn’t an ordinary skill.”

“Maybe you could find its other functions.” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and continued to say aloud.

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu nodded, then after looking at the skill card in his hand, he said to Luo Yue, “I’ll go back and return you the Union coins.”

After all, it was 30 million Union coins, so Lin Xiu was a little embarrassed just to take it.

Swish——

But at this moment, Luo Yue directly took the sword and pointed at Lin Xiu.

“Damn!” Lin Xiu saw the cold light flashing and the long sword was about to pierce him. He was shocked and dodged instinctively.

Lin Xiu has practiced the Diamond Skill Card-‘Without a Trace’, so it was very easy to dodge this blow.

What’s more, Luo Yue had no intention of killing him at all.

“You…” Just as Lin Xiu wanted to say something, he saw Luo Yue walking towards the front without looking back.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu was puzzled.

Although Lin Xiu was still in his twenties, including the years from his previous life, he still didn’t understand girls.

Was it because he said he was going to return her the Union coins so she got angry?

“Hey, wait for me!” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

When he saw Luo Yue had already walked a distance, Lin Xiu called out.

The alley here had many steel buildings, but it seemed that they were all rusty because of their age.

Lin Xiu could still see some people living here from time to time, they were all dressed very simply.

In a big city like Bai Di City, there were still such urban villages hidden, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but feel a little bit emotional.

“Don’t go so fast.” As Lin Xiu chased up, Luo Yue seemed to stop.

“Come out.” Luo Yue stood in place at this time, then said faintly.

Come out!?

Lin Xiu reacted quickly as if he had thought of something, then looked behind him. But the alley was a bit dark, it seemed that no one was there.

Swish——

Luo Yue had a stone in her hand and in the next moment she swung it out with her force. The stone seemed to be like a bullet and instantly penetrated the wall at the corner. A hole appeared on the wall.

“Ah!!!”

A scream echoed at this time. Upon closer inspection, a man at the corner covered his bloody arm as the weapon he was holding fell on the ground because of the severe pain.

“Come out.” Luo Yue ignored the man’s wailing and continued to say aloud.

Pa pa pa——

As Luo Yue called out, at this moment, there was a round of applause.

Taking a closer look, a number of people appeared at the front and back of this alley.

Lin Xiu was surprised to see this.

Just now, he didn’t sense it at all!

“How did you know?” The bald man standing in front said while looking at Luo Yue.

“They are also people from the underground world.” Luo Yue said without answering his question as she looked at Lin Xiu.

Underground world!?

Hearing these words, the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed.

This was not the first time he has heard of this term and Luo Yue’s brother was also from the Underground World.

Thinking of Luo Huatian’s strength, Lin Xiu was still a little bit emotional – that guy’s strength was indeed a bit abnormal.

“I see, no wonder you knew we are here.” The bald man was Lin Zhen, the head of the Tiger Mercenary Group. At this time, he looked at Luo Yue and had a sudden realization.

“Boy, do you know who she is?” Lin Zhen looked at Lin Xiu who was standing next to Luo Yue, then said coldly.

“She must also be from the underground world. There should be a lot of people who died in her hands, right?”

“So what.” Lin Xiu ignored his words and said indifferently.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue looked towards Lin Xiu subconsciously and saw that the Lin Xiu she had just met at the beginning was a very immature student. Now, he seemed to have grown up.

His side profile appeared as if it had been carved out meticulously by God, it looked very structured.

At this time, a hint of gentleness appeared in Luo Yue’s eyes but it was quickly covered up.

“Ahaha, kid, so gutsy!” Lin Zhen laughed, then gave Lin Xiu a thumbs up and said.

“However, you’d better take the things out obediently.” In the next moment, Lin Zhen suppressed his smile and said to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

“What do you want.” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said aloud.

Now Lin Xiu could sense that the strength of these people was extraordinary and the strength of this bald head should be almost the same as his own.

But these were not what Lin Xiu cared about. What Lin Xiu was worried about was that these people seemed a bit different from ordinary warriors.

He felt that their bodies were filled with a very uncomfortable aura.

These are people in the underground world huh…

“The skill card just now, as well as all the Union coins from this beauty and you guys can go.” Lin Zhen looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue and said faintly.

For him, the current situation was no different than catching a turtle in an urn. Lin Xiu and Luo Yue definitely had no chance to resist.

Although he faintly felt that the strength of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were not bad, especially Luo Yue, who could feel his existence, would definitely be stronger.

No matter how strong they were, they couldn’t be any better than them, after all, there was a difference in age.

She’s just a young girl, how unbelievably strong could she be?

Lin Xiu was full of confidence.

“Let me give you a piece of advice too.” Lin Xiu smiled without anger.

He glanced at them, then continued to smile, “Take out all your valuable things and we’ll forget about this matter.”

These people never thought that Lin Xiu would dare to say that. In this situation, never mind that he wasn’t afraid but he actually dared to threaten them in return?

Isn’t this simply courting death?

“Hahaha, great chap, enough guts.”

Lin Zhen burst into laughter, then a murderous intent appeared in his eyes, “Teach him a lesson!”
