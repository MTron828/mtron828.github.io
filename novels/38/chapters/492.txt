Chapter 493: A Price For Everything

After what Spider said, there was a man who walked out from behind him and there was a sniper in his hands.

“I’m sorry.” He had a fierce face and it was obvious that he wasn’t someone nice but with Spider’s order, he had no other choice but to apologize to Lin Xiu involuntarily.

He was still thinking to himself that everything would have been better if he succeeded just now. He didn’t think that he would fail!

“Well, let’s call it even since you have also killed a few of my brothers.” Spider said towards Lin Xiu.

However, what he saw was Lin Xiu picked up the laser gun that was on the ground.

Ka Cak – –

Lin Xiu played with the laser gun for a while before pointing it towards the man called Seven.

“What do you want?!”

As a sniper, the one thing that he hated most was being held at gunpoint.

This was because it made him feel as if he was about to die.

“What are you trying to do?” Spider’s face turned awful as well.

“Nothing. When you have decided to do something, you would have to pay the price.”

Then, without any hesitation, Lin Xiu pulled the trigger.

Boom – –

A single beam was shot!

“Move!” The look in Spider’s eyes changed and then pushed Lin Xiu. His body moved because of Spider and the laser beam did not land on Seven.

At that moment, the sniper, known as Seven, was on the ground and he was already looking ghastly pale, covered in a cold sweat.

It was so close. He could have been shot by the laser beams and there would be a hole in his head by now.

But before he could take a breath, he could feel that there was something on his head. It felt as if a gun had been pointed at his head.

He looked towards the side and saw Lin Xiu who appeared next to him all of a sudden!

“Goodbye now.” Lin Xiu looked down at him and said calmly.

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, his facial expression showed that he was in fear.

“Don’t…”

Boom – –

Before he could finish his sentence, Lin Xiu had already pulled the trigger and a laser beam immediately went through his head.

At that instant, there were bloody, sluggish things that rushed out of his head.

“You…” Spider and his men were surprised when they saw Lin Xiu pull the trigger. Lin Xiu has just killed another one of his men and he was unhappy about it.

“So what if he’s killed?” Lin Xiu threw a glance at Spider before throwing the laser gun onto the ground.

So what if he’s killed?!

Just because of this one sentence, the rest of them turned speechless.

Spider’s facial expression was twisted as he clenched onto his fist. The veins on both his arms were popping and they were very obvious.

It was obvious to all of them that Spider was now furious!

“Kill…him!!!!!” Spider screamed.

He was afraid of Lin Xiu’s hidden power previously but now, he didn’t care about it anymore.

Lin Xiu had the balls to kill one of his men in this situation. If he didn’t kill Lin Xiu, he would never be able to lead them anymore in the future.

Boom – –

As soon as Spider was done and was about to head for Lin Xiu to get rid of Lin Xiu, Spider let out a soft groan.

Spider felt an intense pain all over her body and then saw a young girl standing right in front of him.

“Goodbye.” Luo Yue looked at him before speaking to Spider.

As soon as Luo Yue was done, Spider’s body instantly split into two and fell onto the ground. There was a huge amount of blood that spilled out of Spider’s body and the entire scene turned horrifyingly bloody. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Spider’s men were all dumbfounded. Their arms, which were holding onto the guns, started shivering.

Scary. This is extremely scary.

Their leader was a rank 4 warrior!

A rank 4 warrior was split into two so easily?!

“You’re here?” Lin Xiu was stunned and asked Luo Yue.

“En.” Luo Yue nodded her head.

“I… I’m….. begging you. Please let me go!” One of the men trembled and kneeled on the ground after seeing Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

When the rest of them saw the man kneel, the rest of them lost the energy in their arm to hold onto their guns and got to the ground as well, crying for mercy.

Although they were wanted criminals and had already prepared themselves to be killed, it doesn’t mean that they were prepared to die this way!

Their boss has been split in half by a young girl!

This horrifying scene scared them so badly that they almost peed in their pants.

“Tell me. Who is the one who told you to kill us?” Lin Xiu stared at them from above and said calmly.

“We don’t know as well…”

As soon as they were done, they saw Luo Yue’s bloody sword being placed right in front of their eyes.

“It’s the Zhao family! The third son of the Zhao family was the one who hired us!” When one of them saw the sword, he was reminded of what Luo Yue could do. He thought of how his leader, Spider, had been chopped into two pieces and decided to tell what he knew without any hesitation.

They didn’t want to say it before because they would be in a lot of trouble as well if the Zhao family came after them.

However, they had no other choice. None of them wanted to be split into two halves!

Even if it meant that I would be alive for another hour!

“The Zhao family?” Upon hearing their answer, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

Looks like Zhao Xia has indeed hired someone else to avenge him…

“Give me the contacts and tell me everything.” Lin Xiu continued speaking to them.

All of a sudden, the doors to the balcony kicked open.

“FREEZE!” Lui Wei’s thick voice rang all over the balcony and following right behind him were soldiers with laser beam guns.

As soon as he stepped onto the balcony, he saw Lin Xiu, Luo Yue as well as the group of wanted criminals who were now trembling on the ground.

“Oh? Director Lui, you’re here as well.” Lin Xiu smiled when he saw that it was Lui Wei.

Lui Wei then noticed the body that was next to Lin Xiu and felt a little light-headed. This man was chopped in half!

“This was self-defense. It isn’t illegal, right?” Lin Xiu asked Lui Wei.

“All of these men are grade C wanted criminals. It’s not illegal and I could apply for a reward for both of you!” Lui Wei shook his head and said.

“Police! Quick! Arrest us! You’re right! We are the Grade C wanted criminals!”
