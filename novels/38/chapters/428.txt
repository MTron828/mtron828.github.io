Chapter 429: Playing All Day

“En, not going. I’m taking a break today.” Lin Xiu nodded, then smiled and said.

Although Luo Yue was a little confused, she nodded.

She felt that something was wrong with Lin Xiu today but she couldn’t tell what was it.

And thinking of what happened last night, she felt even more puzzled.

But she was just curious and wasn’t someone who liked to probe.

If Lin Xiu did not tell her, she wouldn’t ask.

“I’m going to the training room.”

Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu, then said faintly.

“En, be careful.” Lin Xiu nodded when he heard her words. At this moment, he was still lying on the ground with his limbs spread out like he was resting comfortably.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue looked at him like she was looking at a fool.

What danger would she face in the training room?

“Don’t tell me he got caught?” At the same time, in the residence on the other side, Ouyang Hang said a little uneasily at this time.

He wasn’t so nice to care about Lin Xiu’s life and death but he was afraid that Lin Xiu would expose him.

After all, it was he who led Lin Xiu to set the fire, so he was responsible too.

“I don’t know what happened last night. There was no electricity. It’s really annoying!” At this time, a guy who lived with Ouyang Hang said uncomfortably.

“I don’t know what the Sacred Region academy is doing.” Ouyang Hang pretended to be helpless and said in exasperation.

“By the way, Young Master Hang, where did you go last night, I couldn’t find you.” The guy seemed to have thought of something at this time, then curiously asked Ouyang Hang.

“Oh, I went out for a walk.” Ouyang Hang said, pretending to be calm.

He couldn’t tell anyone about this and must keep it to himself!]

“Oh right. Young Master Yu wants someone to watch Lin Xiu and see if he is going to pull any tricks. After all, the match is this afternoon.” Ouyang Hang seemed to have thought of something, then said aloud to the man.

Speaking of this, Ouyang Hang had a little headache. Yu Muchen was a very cautious person. He already knew that Lin Xiu was always fighting across ranks and that he and Zhuo Qixing both lost.

Although he was strong, he still needed to make adequate preparations.

“Okay.” The guy nodded, then continued, “I will watch him now.”

“En, before the afternoon match, tell me what that guy did today, so I can tell Young Master Yu.” Ouyang Hang nodded and said.

Although that was what he promised, he wondered if Lin Xiu got caught.

“Wait. Go to his residence first and if you find him there, report to me as soon as possible!”

At the same time, Lin Xiu was in the villa lobby still lying on the ground, resting comfortably.

It took about ten minutes before Lin Xiu got up.

“Feels great.” After stretching for a while, Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

After the intense practice last night, Lin Xiu felt so relaxed today.

Especially the information about the weird postures recorded in the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’, they seemed useless, but after doing those poses, coupled with the practice of ‘Cultivation technique’, suddenly felt like he was practicing with half the effort.

Also, there were a lot of physical training methods recorded in ‘Bodybuilding Technique’, there was even some training in the magma.

Legend has it that the person who created this ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ was physically strong enough to soak in the magma like it was hot spring water.

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but gasp.

This ordinary person couldn’t be melted alive by the magma!

If one’s physical body was really strong to this point, one wouldn’t even need a battle suit. The laser guns and other ordinary weapons wouldn’t even be able to penetrate the skin.

He tried all the new skills last night and could roughly use them but it was impossible for him to master them.

Before the match, what Lin Xiu had to do was not to continue to practice these skills, but to maintain a good attitude, take a good rest, and get recharged.

So Lin Xiu took a hot bath early in the morning and washed away the sweat produced during the practice last night, then went out to the dining hall of the Sacred Region academy for breakfast, then continued to jog.

After that, he went to the electronic library and wandered around. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He even took a nap at noon.

“What? You said he was playing the whole day?” Ouyang Hang couldn’t help but stare at the guy who followed Lin Xiu.

It’s almost time for the match yet this Lin Xiu has no sense of urgency at all and is still playing!?

“Yes, he didn’t practice, but just wandered around in the Sacred Region academy. Oh right, he also just played soccer on the court.” The guy on the other end of the phone said helplessly.

He has monitored Lin Xiu up to now and indeed found that Lin Xiu has not practiced at all.

“Continue watching him!!!” Ouyang Hang said with gritted teeth at this time.

He thought that Lin Xiu was caught and kept worrying that Lin Xiu would expose him and implicate him.

Who knew that Lin Xiu was perfectly fine and was still playing around happily.

“I’ll let you play but I’ll make sure you get knocked out during the match today!” Ouyang Hang thought of this afternoon’s game with both hands clenched, then gritted his teeth and said out loud.

Time went by quickly and it was almost time for the match!

At this time, in the huge field, there were already a lot of students there.

Almost all the students from the North and South campuses were present. And not only freshmen but also sophomores.

After all, in this game, there was Lin Xiu, a very famous freshman and a guy who reached the 30th floor of the Tower of Tournament and defeated many sophomores.

All the seats were filled.

“Was he really playing all day?” At this time, Ouyang Hang and the others had already arrived at the venue and all the people from the North Campus were sitting there.

At this time, Yu Muchen looked at Ouyang Hang, who was sitting next to him, and frowned.

This didn’t make sense. Generally speaking, even if you didn’t practice in this situation, you should think about tactics.

Is he doing this on purpose?

“Then did he have anything unusual last night?” Yu Muchen seemed to think of something at this time, then asked.

“No.” As soon as he said that, Ouyang Hang replied immediately, without any change in his expression.

“Oh right, why did he want you to bring him to that place last night? Was it just to destroy the circuit?”
