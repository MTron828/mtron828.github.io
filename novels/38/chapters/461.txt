Chapter 462: Swallowed!

Gulp – –

The furious black whale suddenly appeared behind Lin Xiu and it instantly swallowed him in one bite!

On the shore, there was a figure who saw this and was shocked.

Luo Yue was just swimming towards him and saw how Lin Xiu was fighting with the furious black whale. Just as she was getting close to them, she noticed that the animal had already swallowed Lin Xiu.

At that moment, Luo Yue lost herself and she wasn’t even aware of how she was feeling.

Then, she grabbed her hands into a fist and gritted her teeth. She was extremely angry.

Xiu – –

Her body was like a bullet and it started traveling at a fast speed towards Lin Xiu!

There were two sharp daggers that appeared on Luo Yue’s hands. She was traveling at the speed of light as she dashed downwards.

Hong – –

The furious black whale seemed to have noticed Luo Yue who was dashing towards it. It opened up its mouth, gave a loud cry, and wanted to swallow Luo Yue as well.

But at that instant, Luo Yue gently moved her body and dodged the attack. She then appeared on its back.

There was a cut on its back and there was still pale blue blood that was seeping out of the wound.

When Luo Yue saw the cut, she didn’t hesitate and immediately stabbed the dagger into the wound with both her hands.

As soon as the daggers were driven into the wound, she pulled it hard and gave it a huge cut.

The black whale felt the immense pain on its back and started shaking its body like crazy.

Luo Yue’s body leaped upwards and she was looking at the huge whale in anger, her eyes filled with a murderous intention.

Before the whale had the chance to attack her, Luo Yue grabbed onto the dagger, and with her body that was as agile as the fishes around, she dashed towards the whale!

She was about to give the black whale another hit.

At the same time, Lin Xiu, who was now inside the stomach of the black whale, was still protecting himself with the ‘yuan’.

Since the ‘yuan’ was glowing, he was able to see the surroundings. He could clearly make out that there were a lot of other bodies of mutant creatures here. There was also a large amount of green fluid that was on the ground.

Because of this fluid, the bodies of the mutant creatures were slowly being digested.

So….he was now inside the stomach of a mutant creature?!

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but take a deep breath when he noticed where he was. Then, he realized that he had been swallowed by a furious black whale!

“So…I am inside of this creature’s stomach now?” Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

If it wasn’t because of the protection from the ‘yuan’, his body would have been corroded by this green fluid.

He took a good look around. It was a huge space and all the walls were made of bright red meat.

Lin Xiu stared at the wall for a moment before giving it a good punch!

Boom – –

The creature only gave out a soft groan when Lin Xiu punched it from its inside.

Lin Xiu’s punch was useless when it came to fighting this mutant creature.

“Damn it!”

Lin Xiu noticed how there wasn’t any damage done to the body of the creature after giving it a good punch. He couldn’t help but frown. He clenched into a fist and gritted his teeth. Then, his fist was slowly covered with lightning.

Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist!!!

Boom Boom Boom – –

Lin Xiu continued to attack the body of the black. Near the seabed, the black whale, who was still planning on swallowing Luo Yue, suddenly stopped and its body was moving uncontrollably. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

This was her chance!

Luo Yue took the opportunity and quickly swam towards the furious black whale!

With daggers in both her hands, she aimed for the huge eye and pierced it!

Boom – –

Following the sound of a ruptured bubble, the eyeball of the furious black whale immediately burst.

Hong – –

The intense pain from the rupture of its eyeball caused the black whale to shake even more.

It swung the pair of huge tails that it had and threw Luo Yue into the distance. Luo Yue was hit and her entire body crashed onto the small mountain that was behind her.

Boom – –

With a small groan, there was blood coming out from the corner of her lips but it was soon diluted by the water around her.

Luo Yue stared at the furious black whale who had turned crazy and her eyes were still glaring with the intention to kill.

She gave a good push and continued swimming towards the whale!

Luo Yue was using all of the energy in her body in order to move. She held onto both her daggers and was swimming towards the whale like a mermaid.

“Damn it!”

Lin Xiu was also attacking the flashy wall of the whale crazily. However, no matter how hard he tried, he wasn’t able to break through the thick wall!

Plus, he noticed that his strength was becoming weaker by the minute.

The ‘yuan’ around him was blinking as well and it looked like it was about to disappear.

This was the side effect of using ‘Rage’ and it was slowly getting to him.

Crap! If he didn’t get to escape now, he would be in a lot of trouble!

Before Lin Xiu could continue throwing punches onto the thick, fleshy wall, he could feel a sense of weakness that took over his body.

The ‘yuan’ that was around him has disappeared!

Lin Xiu, who was now tired and weak, fell onto the ground and has become one of the bodies that were inside the creature’s stomach.

As for the green fluid, there were slowly corroding Lin Xiu’s clothes and there were white fumes coming out of his body.

Lin Xiu would feel a stinging pain around his arm and neck.

It was extremely painful. Even if he had thick skin and flesh, his body still wouldn’t be able to withstand the corroding effect of this fluid that is inside the body of a rank 8 mutant creature!

Plus, he was suffering from the side effect of ‘Rage’ which was why he couldn’t even move a finger.

Damn it! Is death his only way out?

Soon, Lin Xiu thought about his ‘bodybuilding technique’. This technique uses external forces to strengthen his body, right?

With that in mind, Lin Xiu started using the ‘bodybuilding technique’.

However, Lin Xiu still couldn’t bear the pain. He looked at his fingers and noticed that they were already getting eroded by the fluid. He could already see his bones!

No way! If he stayed here any longer, his entire body would turn into ash!
