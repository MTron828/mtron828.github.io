Chapter 773: Distressed

Bang bang bang-

Many warriors were fanned out by the huge flame wings.

Although those warriors all unfolded their ‘Spheres’, they still flew out directly under the power of this terrifying impact.

Roar–

It looked at the warriors who continued to attack it relentlessly and at this moment, it suddenly let out a huge roar.

The mouth opened wide and a large amount of flames continuously burst out from its mouth.

Looking at the boundless flames, those warriors were unable to continue to attack and could only passively resist them.

“It wants to run away!”

At this moment, a warrior seemed to have discovered something and roared loudly.

“Everyone work harder, we can kill it soon!” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Looking at these people who thought that the Raging Flame Lion wanted to escape because it was afraid, sneered as his body was still suspended in the air, “Stupid.”

It was absolutely impossible for these Raging Flame Lion to escape because it was out of power.

Because he could clearly feel that the power of the Raging Flame Lion was still very strong.

It suddenly acted like this... Could it be!?

Qian Qiurong seemed to have thought of something and the expression in his eyes suddenly changed greatly.

Because he just saw a man use a body skill to cross the Raging Flame Lion and he wanted to find its cave.

It was not that no warrior tried this before, but it is said that there were many powerful evolved beasts in the cave of the Raging Flame Lion.

Moreover, the weaker warriors would die easily if they went over, but the stronger warriors would be discovered as soon as they cross the body of the Raging Flame Lion.

Originally thought that the man should be dead, but now it seems that he broke into the cave!?

“Chase!”

At the same time, watching the Raging Flame Lion turn around and fly away, Qian Qiurong couldn’t help but roar loudly.

He didn’t know that Lin Xiu just used the ‘Disguise’ skill to hide all his power, so the Raging Flame Lion didn’t pay attention to Lin Xiu, so Lin Xiu easily passed it and ran to the back.

But now Lin Xiu’s power has been fully displayed and it seems to be able to sense something. At this time, it madly rushed back to the cave.

But most of the warriors thought it was afraid. At this time, they frantically released their skills, trying to block it.

What they didn’t know was that this was equivalent to indirectly giving Lin Xiu some time.

At this time, Lin Xiu, who was in those strange liquid pools, had already subconsciously activated his ‘Cultivation Technique’.

With the operation of the ‘Cultivation Technique’, every pore on the body seems to be opened and it is madly absorbing the power brought by these liquids.

The meridians of the whole body seem to be filled with a lot of energy.

These energies are implemented into every cell.

The feeling of comfort is accompanied by a sense of severe pain, which made him have a desire to live and die.

With the continuous expansion of the body’s meridians, Lin Xiu felt that he seemed to be able to store more energy in his body.

And at this time, Lin Xiu could clearly feel his heart beating faster.

Gene lock!

For some reason, Lin Xiu suddenly thought of the gene lock, the next level of gene lock that he never dared to unlock.

The rank 4 genetic lock.

As long as the gene lock of this stage is unlocked, it will be different from the gene lock of the other three ranks.

The whole person will explode with more terrifying power and mastery.

Because of this stage, every structure of the body and even cells are renewed and optimized again.

Even his own gene chain can be reconstituted and the useless ones can be washed out again and combined into an optimal gene chain.

This is very scary.

But the failure rate was too high and the price was death, so even though Lin Xiu had the qualification to unlock it, he still didn’t dare to try.

But at this time, Lin Xiu could clearly feel it, as if unlocking it at this time, it is very likely to succeed!

But now he is absorbing these powers crazily and the intense pain caused by it makes Lin Xiu feel that his body doesn’t belong to him anymore.

And there are still many scars and wounds on the body.

These wounds appeared, repaired again, but opened again in the next second.

An iterative process.

Fight!

While he was still conscious, Lin Xiu gritted his teeth, entered the interface of the system directly and activated the gene lock!

“Gene lock unlocking starts...”

When the icy voice of the system sounded in his mind, Lin Xiu suddenly felt an incomparably terrifying force, like a tidal wave rushing towards him.

Originally, he was endured by the seemingly endless power brought by this light blue liquid. At this time, coupled with the attack of this terrifying power, the flesh and blood on his entire body actually exploded!

Even the bones on the arm can be seen clearly!

That kind of pain felt as if he had been slashed by a thousand knives.

It’s over!?

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and in the next moment, the whole person instantly fell into endless darkness.

At the same time, Luo Yue in the classroom on the other side seemed to feel something and her eyes changed suddenly.

“Luo Yue, what’s wrong with you?”

A girl on the side seemed to see that something was wrong with Luo Yue at this time and she couldn’t help but say out of curiosity.

“I’m fine.”

Luo Yue shook her head, then stood up and walked outside the door.

Going out, Luo Yue subconsciously covered her chest when she was outside.

For some reason, she felt her heart beating a little faster.

“What the hell happened...”

She suddenly felt a little pain in her heart just now.

Looking at the distance, she seemed to think of a certain smiling face.

“Lin Xiu...”

She stared into the distance dazedly, talking to herself in a low voice.

“Don’t let it go!” Qian Qiurong roared loudly at this time and he also released his skills to attack the Raging Flame Lion.

Under the attack of those warriors, the Raging flame lion, who was madly trying to rush back, was also stopped.

Qian Qiurong looked at those warriors and thought that the Raging Flame Lion was about to die and at this time, he desperately attacked this evolved beast.

At this time, the expression in Qian Qiurong’s eyes changed a bit and without anyone finding out, his figure flashed and he directly crossed the Raging Flame Lion and rushed behind.

The Raging flame lion clearly saw Qian Qiurong’s movements and its huge eyes seemed to have turned into flames at this moment.

Roar–

It let out a huge roar from its throat.

The roar was so loud, so loud that it seemed that the surrounding space was about to be shattered!
