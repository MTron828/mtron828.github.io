Chapter 892: Holy-level Skill Card (1)

“Yes.”

Zhao Yongyuan nodded slightly.

There was no murderous intent in his eyes.

“After so many years, someone finally came.”

Zhao Yongyuan said to himself.

He seemed to be a little dazed as he thought of something.

Lin Xiu glanced around and found that the ninth floor was exactly the same as the eighth floor, except that there was a huge glass sphere in the middle.

In the sphere, there is a dazzling cluster of light.

The cluster of light was very dazzling, and it seemed to contain some kind of extremely powerful power, so the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly.

It seems that there is something floating in the cluster of light.

Could it be that the holy-level skill card is here?

Looking at the glass ball inside, Lin Xiu’s eyes were a little dazed, as if he had thought of something.

When he was at Sacred Region Academy before, there was also such a ball on the Tower of Trials.

......

It was just that the cluster of light in the ‘sphere’ at that time contained all the remaining power of the old man’s body.

Although this cluster of light was somewhat similar, it was different from the one at that time.

“What’s your name.”

Zhao Yongyuan looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

He seemed to be expecting something in his eyes.

“Lin Xiu.”

Lin Xiu was startled, and without the slightest hesitation, he said directly.

“You’re not from the Ye family!?”

When Zhao Yongyuan heard Lin Xiu’s name, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly, and his expression changed immediately.

It seemed to be different from the name he had imagined.

“no.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

According to what the old man said at the time, the last remaining members of the Ye family had all died after they came to Earth.

Now in this universe, it should be completely impossible for people from the Ye family to exist.

Zhao Yongyuan probably thought that he was a descendant of the Zhao family because he obtained the token.

“How did you get this token!”

Zhao Yongyuan said sharply at this time.

The whole person was suddenly filled with extremely terrifying killing intent.

As if Lin Xiu was a thief.

“Senior Ye gave it to me.”

Lin Xiu looked at Zhao Yongyuan, and there was no trace of fear in his eyes.

He didn’t need to be afraid either.

After all, although Zhao Yongyuan is also a warrior at the level of Respected warrior, Lin Xiu will not be afraid when they actually fought.

And he still has system skills that he hasn’t released yet.

Of course, what he said was the truth.

At this moment, Zhao Yongyuan stared at Lin Xiu for a while, and then the source strength of the two people mobilized at the same time.

There seemed to be sparks colliding in the air.

boom boom boom —

Two powerful source strengths manifested separately and charged toward each other.

At this moment, the entire tower body of the nine-story pagoda was shaking violently.

“never mind.”

But soon, Zhao Yongyuan stopped.

Lin Xiu also withdrew his source strength.

He looked at Lin Xiu with complicated eyes, then looked at the ball again, and sighed.

“We’ll find out later.”

Find out later?

Lin Xiu raised his brows – he didn’t understand what he meant.

“What do you mean?”

Lin Xiu was a little confused, so he couldn’t help but say out loud.

But Zhao Yongyuan obviously didn’t want to pay attention to Lin Xiu. At this time, he looked at the glass ball and said aloud as if talking to himself: Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“The holy-level skill card you want is right there.”

It is inside the sphere!?
