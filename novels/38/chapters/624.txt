It’s him!?

Lin Xiu looked at the person on the competition stage, there was no doubt that it was Zhuo Qixing!

This guy, so he wasn’t dead...

Seeing this, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed involuntarily.

At this moment, Zhuo Qixing was standing on the competition stage, his eyes were cold, and his whole body seemed to be full of slaughter.

“Do you know this guy?” Baili Haoling followed Lin Xiu’s eyes to the top of the competition stage, and saw Zhuo Qixing.

“He is the one who graduated from Sky City High School and entered our Sanctuary Academy.” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes at this time, and then said lightly.

“Oh, it is said that I was beaten to death by you.” Baili Haoling nodded at this moment.

“However, I feel like his strength has grown stronger.” Speaking of this, Lin Xiu’s face also became a little serious.

That’s right, after using the Eye of Analysis, Lin Xiu can clearly know that Zhuo Qixing’s strength has reached the eighth rank now!

How did this guy do it?

“Cyborg.” Just when Lin Xiu was surprised, Baili Haolin suddenly said aloud.

“Huh?” Cyborg, has he transformed into a cyborg?

If it wasn’t for what Baili Haoling said, Lin Xiu really couldn’t feel it.

“According to the technological strength of Sky City, it is not too difficult to do this.” Baili Haoling said lightly.

“However, this transformation into a cyborg also has sequelae.” Although he can quickly improve his strength in a short period of time, if this continues, there is almost no way for his physical strength to increase. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

This is the limitation of transforming into a cyborg. Only by further transforming can you improve your power.

Ordinary warriors don’t think about transforming cyborgs at all. Zhuo Qixing, there should be no way to do so.

It seemed that in that battle, he had severely injured him.

When Lin Xiu looked at the competition stage, Zhuo Qixing seemed to sense something, he looked in Lin Xiu’s direction, and he could see Lin Xiu’s figure clearly in an instant!

Seeing Lin Xiu, Zhuo Qixing’s eyes widened, and the slaughter in his eyes became more intense.

“Game start!”

At this time, the game has been announced to start!

Zhuo Qixing looked at the people rushing over from the opposite side, and charged directly with the spear in his hand!

“Qixing!” A man in their team clearly felt that Zhuo Qixing’s state was not right, and shouted loudly.

But now it’s too late, Zhuo Qixing seems to be in a state of madness, and he has passed all the killing intent to the person he is dealing with now!

bang bang bang-

With a flash of sword light, all those people on the opposite side were beheaded by Zhuo Qixing!

Blood splashed all over the ground!

The surrounding audience immediately burst into an uproar when they saw this scene.

This is the first time someone has directly killed someone on a martial arts stage!

“This...”

Some leaders on the podium saw this scene and their expressions changed slightly.

“The rules of the game don’t limit death, right?”

The vice president of Sky Academy touched his beard at this time, then looked at the rest of the people at the table and said indifferently.

“But this is too much, isn’t it?”

The others didn’t dare to say anything, but Bai Litao glanced at him and said aloud.

“If you are a student of Sanctuary College, you can also kill our Sky City people on the rooftop.”

The deputy dean of Sky City touched his beard and said with a constant expression.

Those around them saw that there was an obvious spark collision between the two.

“Zhuo Qixing, what are you doing!”

At this time, one of the members of the Sky City branch roared at Zhuo Qixing.

Even if you go to the sky to fight, you will not be responsible for dealing with it whether you live or die, but if you kill it like this, you will still fall into unfavorable public opinion.

“It’s none of your business.”

Zhuo Qixing gave him a cold look and said, then the long sword in his right hand pointed directly in the direction of Lin Xiu’s side, and shouted loudly, “I will kill you on this platform!”

Zhuo Qixing’s words were full of murderous intent, and because of his operation of the source, at this moment, everyone around him could clearly hear Zhuo Qixing’s words.

Who is he talking about?

The surrounding audience all looked in the direction of Lin Xiu, but there were too many people sitting on Lin Xiu’s side, and they didn’t know who Zhuo Qixing was referring to.

“Looks like you’re in trouble.”

Baili Haoling said with a playful smile on the corner of his mouth.

“Last time, I didn’t kill him because of the academy, but now that I’m on the rooftop, it doesn’t matter to anyone after I go up, then I’ll help those who just died and kill him.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said aloud.

People like Zhuo Qixing are like a ticking time bomb to Lin Xiu, it’s time to get rid of them.

The next game continued, but because of such an incident today, the rest of the teams seemed to be afraid of the Sky Academy team and were killed, so the next game of the Sky Academy team was directly won.

In this afternoon’s game, Lin Xiu and the others also won easily.

The current knockout stage is relatively simple.

It’s the third day of the competition!

The Sanctuary Academy was tied for the first place with a winning streak. The rest were the Sky Academy team and the Star Academy, all of which had the most victories.

And after these three days of constant competition, the list of the top sixteen has come out.

“Come on, the list is out!”

This night, when Lin Xiu and the others were still training in the training room, Ouyang Hang seemed to see the interface displayed on the screen in the front, center, and exclaimed.

Now that a large number of teams have been eliminated, there is almost no one else in the training room except Lin Xiu and others.

Lin Xiu also stood up straight from the state of sitting cross-legged, and looked in front of his eyes, he could clearly see the list of top sixteen teams displayed above.

The list of Sanctuary Academy is at the forefront, the rest are Sky Academy Team, Interstellar Academy Team, Nighthawk Academy, Smack Academy, Tianyang Academy, Longxiao Academy, Galaxy Academy, Ice Star Academy, Moon Picking Academy, Sky Academy , Star Academy.

“Hey, why did the Sky Academy and the Interstellar Academy repeat?”

When Qian Yao saw the list, he said out of curiosity.

“The next one is their home team.”

When Ouyang Hang heard Qian Yao’s words, his face became more cautious.

“How can they have two teams competing?”
