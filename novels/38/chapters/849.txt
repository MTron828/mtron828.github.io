Chapter 850: The Fierce Battle!

“Okay... what a terrifying skill!”

When those people in the distance saw this scene, the expressions in their eyes changed greatly.

This long sword that emanated from his source strength burst out with white rays of light in the sky and actually formed this huge Dragon sword.

It seemed as if he wanted to completely annihilate Lin Xiu’s body!

Lin Xiu, who was suspended in the air, watched the terrifying Dragon sword charge, without any fear in his eyes.

“Die!”

Huang Ying roared and with a wave of his right hand, the Dragon sword burst out with even more terrifying speed and charged away directly!

Boom—

There was a loud noise in the air.

A skill that can even cut through space!

“This kid, it’s over for him.”

Luo Jing looked at the scene of the satellite surveillance at this time and couldn’t help shaking his head.

“Look carefully.”

Luo Tian originally thought that Lin Xiu was finished, but at this moment, he seemed to have discovered something. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

When the Dragon sword attacked Lin Xiu’s body, a golden light seemed to burst out from Lin Xiu’s body.

Boom—

Just when everyone thought that Lin Xiu would definitely die, a loud noise suddenly rang out.

It seemed that the giant Dragon sword that devoured and annihilated Lin Xiu exploded directly.

Looks like I’m not dead yet.

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s voice came out again.

how can that be!?

At this time, even the king’s eyes widened slightly.

His attack just now, even a warrior of the same level as him, would find it impossible to resist.

How could this boy resist?!

And as Lin Xiu’s figure slowly appeared, he could clearly see that Lin Xiu was completely fine.

Unscathed.

“Go to hell!”

Huang Ying also burst out at this time, with a wave of his right hand, the scattered sword rays transformed from his source strength all gathered again.

From all directions, they charged toward Lin Xiu!

Whoosh whoosh—

The speed of these long swords is really too fast and the entire city was filled with the whooshing sounds.

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

The power of this Huang Ying was really too terrifying. If he does not show 100% of his strength, he will most likely be killed by him.

Just like the attack just now, he couldn’t dodge at all, but fortunately, with the skill of ‘Golden Body Immortality’, he resisted his strongest attack.

‘Fury’!

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu activated the fury skill.

Looking at the thousands of sword rays rushing over, Lin Xiu waved frantically with the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

Dangdang-

All the sword rays that came were blocked.

Huang Ying’s face was gloomy, his right hand stretched out and a lot of source strength burst out.

The source strength shone a white light and looked very dazzling.

At the same time as it was released from his outstretched right hand, it slowly converged into a huge sword ray.

The figure disappeared and appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

Dang–

Seeing Huang Ying appearing in front of him, Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly and he subconsciously held the Dark Edge spear to resist.

The powerful impact made Lin Xiu’s body fly backward.

Some of the sword rays that hit him slashed into his skin, instantly cutting through the hole in the battle suit and there were bloodstains on his arms.

It made Lin Xiu feel a tingling sensation.

“You think you are really capable huh.”

Huang Ying said coldly.

“Even a Respected warrior is divided into strong and weak. You are the weakest.”

He said that with a proud look in his eyes.

He is the emperor of the Marqi planet, the peak existence.

A little earthling, just want to shake his existence?

However, in his heart, he still had to admit that Lin Xiu’s strength had already made him feel threatened.

Giving him more time to grow up is indeed a huge hidden danger for him.

“The battle has just begun.”

“Just warming up.”

Lin Xiu stabilized his body in the air, stared at Huang Ying in front of him and said lightly.

There were just a lot of wounds on the body, but at this moment, they healed quickly at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Perfectly intact!

Huang Ying was clearly aware of this scene and his brows furrowed slightly.

This recovery speed is too terrifying, right?

“In any case, today, you will be buried here.”

As soon as he finished speaking, his body instantly disappeared in place, appearing behind Lin Xiu, a huge sword ray, about to cut Lin Xiu’s body in half!

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s figure also flickered and he avoided it.

The body appeared on the other side of the air.

With a direct wave of the Dark Edge spear in his hand, huge flaming birds were instantly released.

They merged to form a huge flaming phoenix and charged in the direction of Huang Ying!

The surrounding space seems to be distorted by the terrifyingly high temperature that this flaming phoenix bursts out!

The scorching temperature made the temperature of the entire Fengyun City rise a lot again.

“Insignificant skill.”

Huang Ying looked at the flaming phoenix that was charging and sneered.

Holding the sword ray in his hand, he swung it into the air and immediately transformed into a huge sword ray and slashed down!

The gigantic flaming phoenix instantly split into two halves!

However, when they dispersed, they quickly regrouped.

This flaming phoenix continued to charge towards Huang Ying’s body!

The pupils in Huang Ying’s eyes shrank slightly and his body subconsciously wanted to dodge, but the flame phoenix, as if he knew where he was dodging, charged directly towards that direction!

Boom—

The huge flaming phoenix hit his body at the same time, then rotated, forming a huge flame tornado.

Spinning wildly in the air.

The whole world seemed to be swept away by this flame tornado at this moment.

The buildings below were all annihilated at this moment.

There was a huge sound of ‘boom’ and ‘boom’ all over the ground.

It kept shaking.

“What... what a terrifying power...”

Luo Tian and Luo Jing felt chills on their backs at this time.

Thinking back to the time when Lin Xiu came, he was able to kill the two of them in one second.

Thinking of this, they couldn’t help but feel a little nervous.

Lin Xiu, who was suspended in the sky, stared at the flame tornado.

“Brother Lin... so strong!”

At the same time, on the Marqi planet, there are broadcasts of this shocking battle all over the world.

After all, technology has developed to such a point that many big companies have their own satellite monitors.

They could clearly see the battle.

Liu Pan and others were also in front of a huge screen, watching the battle in the distant Fengyun City.
