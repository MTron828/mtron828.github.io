Chapter 811: Instant Kill

Lin Xiu held a long spear and looked at them, without the slightest change in expression.

Zhao Nian frowned at this moment and he could sense a strange aura in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

This aura made him feel very uncomfortable.

“Get rid of him.”

Zhao Nian showed a killing intent in his eyes, then said coldly.

As soon as his words fell, at this moment, three of the warriors, the source strength of their bodies burst out and rushed directly to Lin Xiu!

swoosh—

Their speed was very fast and at this moment, they appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

“Die!!!”

These warriors roared and the fists wrapped by the source strength were about to smash at Lin Xiu.

bang bang bang-

But at this moment, the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand stabbed out.

In an instant, hundreds of spears appeared.

The three warriors who came from the attack originally thought that they could easily block Lin Xiu’s attack with the source strength covering their body.

But what they didn’t expect was that at this moment, the spear in Lin Xiu’s hands seemed to penetrate their bodies in an instant!

Their eyes widened and there was no way to react at this time.

Because at this moment, their bodies were all holes pierced by spears.

Boom—

At this moment, the three of them all flew out, then fell heavily on the ground.

Blood flowed from their bodies.

“You…”

When Zhao Nian and the others saw this scene, their eyes widened.

Instant kill!

A master warrior-level warrior was instantly killed by Lin Xiu so easily!

And Lin Xiu’s expression didn’t change at all, blood dripped from the spear tip in his hand.

“Tell me why you beat him.”

Lin Xiu continued walking with the spear, staring at Zhao Nian and saying.

“Kill him for me!!!”

Zhao Nian directly crushed the glass in his hand and roared.

At this moment, the dozen or so warriors around them all carried the long spears in their hands and attacked Lin Xiu directly.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and the spear in both hands danced wildly.

Dangdang-

Even though he was attacked by many people at the same time, Lin Xiu still seemed to be at ease.

This guy…

Looking at a long spear, it was dancing in Lin Xiu’s hand like they were one entity.

More than a dozen master warrior-level warriors did not take advantage.

As for the warriors who were fighting against Lin Xiu, it was really challenging.

Because they clearly felt that their attacks always felt blocked by something, so the damage caused was only half.

Of course they didn’t know that the effect of Lin Xiu’s warrior title had a 30% chance of being able to resist 50% of the attacks he was about to receive.

When they surrounded him, the effect was still very obvious.

With the ‘Without a Trace’ body skill, Lin Xiu’s figure was like a phantom and they couldn’t attack him at all.

At this moment, the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand waved and a large number of flaming birds burst out in an instant.

The flame of the flaming birds was dark blue, which looks very strange.

And with the appearance of the flaming birds, the entire space, at this moment, seemed to become extremely hot.

It’s like being in a big furnace.

“Be careful!!!”

When a warrior saw this scene, the expression on his face changed greatly.

Although the surrounding warriors dodged quickly, in the next moment, a warrior still did not dodge and watched the terrifying flaming birds attack.

“‘Sphere’!”

He roared inwardly, wanting to directly use ‘Sphere’ to block Lin Xiu’s attack.

But what he didn’t expect was that at this moment, with the impact of the flaming bird, the seemingly indestructible ‘Sphere’ actually melted directly!

In the next moment, the dark blue flaming bird impacted his body.

“What!!!”

With a loud wailing sound, in the next moment, his body was completely scorched in an instant.

Turned into a coke.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for killing a master warrior and gaining 165464 experience...”

The increase in experience was too and Lin Xiu could hardly see any movement in the progress bar.

Although the rest of the warriors unfolded their ‘Spheres’ at this time, their bodies trembled slightly at this time.

Terrible, it’s really too terrifying.

That kind of flame even melted the ‘Sphere’ of a warrior.

The ‘Sphere’ of a warrior is the strongest ‘protection’ of a warrior.

And this strongest protection seemed useless in front of Lin Xiu.

How can this fight go on!?

At this time, these warriors all began to retreat a little.

“A bunch of trash!”

Zhao Nian roared angrily at this time, also holding a huge sword beside him and stood up.

“You guys kill him and I’ll let you go.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, stared at Zhao Nian and said aloud.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, these warriors were stunned.

“Kill him, you guys can choose another boss and I won’t pursue this matter.”

Lin Xiu stood on the spot and said lightly.

These people’s eyes widened at this time and they seemed to be hesitant.

“You guys dare to kill me?”

When Zhao Nian heard Lin Xiu’s provocative words, then looked at his subordinates, he suddenly shouted angrily.

“Die!”

Zhao Nian looked at Lin Xiu, who was facing him. He waved the sword in his hand. At this moment, a terrifying sword aura burst out and rushed straight to Lin Xiu! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

boom–

Lin Xiu swung the spear in his hand violently, directly resisting the terrifying sword aura.

“Give you all three seconds to think about it.”

“three...”

“Courting death!!!”

Zhao Nian was already crazy and the strength of his whole body burst out.

A fiery pattern appeared on his forehead.

Source mark power!

In the next moment, with the use of his source mark power, a large number of fiery red flames, like giant fire snakes, charged towards Lin Xiu!

Origin Pattern Power – ‘Flaming Serpent’!

“The power of fire attribute?”

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched and the ‘Sphere’ of his body unfolded instantly.

Those huge and terrifying flaming snakes all hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ and disappeared instantly.

It didn’t cause any damage to Lin Xiu at all.

And if you look closely, you can see that Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ has turned dark blue.

The whole ‘Sphere’ seems to be made of of hellfire.

How is this possible!

Seeing Lin Xiu standing still, easily resisting his most powerful Source mark power, Zhao Nian was shocked and angry.

“Two…”

“One.”

As Lin Xiu glanced at them, those warriors appeared as if they fell into an ice cave.

In the next moment, he looked towards Zhao Nian, his eyes showing killing intent.

“What are you guys doing!”
