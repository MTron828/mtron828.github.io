Chapter 552: The Horrifying Rank 8 Warrior!

It was a stone. A huge stone landed on Jiang Tao and broke his head!

As he turned around, he could clearly see a huge, young man who was standing on top of a hill.

His eyes were like a hawk, glaring at Lin Xiu.

“You’re the one who killed the men from my sect?!” The young man sneered as he asked Lin Xiu.

After hearing what he said, Lin Xiu’s pupil shrunk uncontrollably.

He was from the Royal Beast Sect!

While Lin Xiu got reminded of it, he clenched onto his fist.

There was a burning rage that built up inside of him.

“What’s wrong? You’re angry?” The young man continued asking Lin Xiu.

“You killed the men from the Royal Beast Sect. You’ll have to pay for it!!!”

With that said, he jumped off the hill and headed directly towards Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu reacted immediately seeing how the young man leaped from above. He picked up his spear and accepted the fight instead of running away.

He had just witnessed the death of Jiang Tao which was why his eyes were bloody red now.

Xiu – –

The young man came towards him and Lin Xiu pierced his long spear forward. A loud sound came from it as his spear broke the silent air around them.

When the Dark Edge was just about to pierce into the man’s body, the man disappeared and the spear was pierced into thin air. He missed!

As for the young man, he had a sword in his arm and attacked Lin Xiu from the back.

Lin Xiu suddenly felt that something wasn’t right. He took a step back and felt a sharp pain on his neck.

His sword aura was so strong that it managed to cut through the skin on his neck.

There were droplets of blood that came dripping down his neck.

“Don’t worry. I won’t kill you so easily.” The young man sneered as he let out a hideous smile.

The sword was just like a flexible snake in his arm. It was fast as it continued to attack Lin Xiu.

Clang Clang Clang – –

Lin Xiu was trying his best to block his attacks with the Dark Edge.

However, his attacks were too strong. Lin Xiu had no other choice but to back down and he didn’t have the chance to attack.

Plus, the sword aura from that young man was incredibly terrifying.

Lin Xiu continued blocking his attack with the Dark Edge and he could feel the skin on both his arms slowly breaking away.

“You have a pretty good speed.” The young man laughed as he aimed the sword towards Lin Xiu’s chest.

Lin Xiu was wearing the ‘Silver Leopard Armour’ that he won from the lucky draw. Although the sword didn’t pierce through him, Lin Xiu could still feel a sharp pain on his chest. It was obvious that there was a cut on his chest.

The young man also realised what was happening and placed even more force on both his arms, trying to drive the sword through Lin Xiu.

Boom – –

With a soft groan, the look in his eyes changed.

“It’s a fake one?!”

He immediately found out what was happening and chopped ‘Lin Xiu’ into two. Then, when he turned around, he could see Lin Xiu who was standing in the distance, holding onto his long spear and was panting on the spot.

Although his combat suit was still intact, there was already a small cut on his chest and Lin Xiu could clearly feel that there was warm blood sipping out of it.

This man was a rank 8 warrior!

Obviously, it wouldn’t be that easy for Lin Xiu to defeat him. With their short encounter, Lin Xiu already knew that this was a powerful man.

Damn it!

Now that ‘Rage’ was still in its cooling time, he wouldn’t be able to use it now.

“You may be quite strong but still, it isn’t enough.” The young man may not know what skills Lin Xiu had just used but for him, these were all just little tricks and no matter how many Lin Xiu had, he would still be a dead man by the end of the day! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lin Xiu completely ignored the young man. He still held onto the Dark Edge with both his arms while staring at the young man before him. Lin Xiu took a deep breath and with his body as the centre, there was a glow that surrounded him.

Soon, the glow spread, there was an array that was slowly formed across the ground as well.

System skills – the Heavenly Array!

Although this wasn’t as effective as ‘Rage’, Lin Xiu could still feel the energy in his body building up.

On the other hand, the young man’s strength was being suppressed.

“Hmm?” The young man who could feel the strength in his body being slowly suppressed, frowned in confusion.

“What is this?!” The young man frowned as he looked at the ground and saw the white markings.

But soon, he thought of what it was and there was a change in his facial expression.

“Source field?!”

That’s impossible! The young man was at most a rank 6 warrior. How could he activate a skill that belonged to a rank 9 warrior?!

He may not know what was happening but he could already clearly feel the pressure all over his body.

He had to kill Lin Xiu immediately!

The young man’s eyes were filled with hatred and so was the same in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

Especially when he thought of how painful Jiang Tao’s death was, the rage in Lin Xi was like a roaring flame.

Koong Loong – –

Before the young man could attack him, Lin Xiu waved his long spear and the flaming birds started heading towards the young man!

‘The Awe of the Phoenix!’

Dozens of flaming birds rushed out at once and the air around them was so scorched that even the surrounding air looked distorted.

The flaming birds attacked the young man’s body from all angles and there wasn’t a spot that wasn’t covered.

“Dainty tricks.” The young man sneered before unfolding a bright purple shield around him.

As soon as the flaming birds landed on the man’s ‘Yuan’, they completely dissipated.

How was that possible!?

Lin Xiu was surprised when he saw what happened.

He knew that the ‘Yuan’ of that young man was obviously different from the rest of the ‘Yuan’t that he had seen.

This one had a purple glow!

Rank 8 warriors were indeed of a different level from his. If he made it to rank 7 and with the abilities of ‘Rage’, he may be able to put up a fight but for now, it would be impossible!

“The Awe of the Phoenix!!!”

Lin Xiu screamed as he held onto his Dark Edge and there was a large number of flaming birds that rushed towards the young man.

“Hmph! I don’t know if you noticed but your skills don’t really have any effect on me.” The young man said as he stared at the flames around him.

With his ‘Yuan’ protecting him, these flames were basically useless.

“Disappointed? Now that you’ve learnt that your skills are useless…”

The young man continued laughing and he looked incredibly arrogant.

However, as the flames around him disappeared, he noticed that Lin Xiu’s body had disappeared as well!
