Chapter 1008: Huge Source Strength Ball

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Can’t hide, can’t hide!

Watching this huge ball of source strength rush towards him, Huangfu Bai actually felt an extremely powerful sense of oppression.

“I am… God!!!”

He roared, his eyes full of unwillingness.

At this moment, from his hands, two extremely terrifying energy light clusters were released again!

boom boom boom —

These energy light clusters continuously hit the huge source strength ball, but they were useless.

In the next moment, this terrifying source strength ball directly hit Huangfu Bai’s body!

The golden light on Huangfu Bai’s body burst out, desperately trying to resist the impact of the source strength ball.

But this Source Strength Ball was formed by gathering most of the source air in this Sage warrior space.

The energy is extremely powerful.

With the release of the source strength of Huangfu Bai’s body.

Immediately, his body was enveloped in golden light.

But even so, the terrifying power of this source strength ball still instantly annihilated the layer of golden light on his body.

damn…

The look on Huangfu Bai’s face became extremely hideous.

Although Huangfu Bai was a warrior at the level of Sage warrior and could withstand most of the power brought by this ‘God Descend’.

But he had used too much power during the battle just now.

Also, the power transferred from the ‘God Descend’ couldn’t last very long on the Planet Namir.

Now Huangfu Bai could no longer use his power.

Could it be that this kid has been dodging just now because he realized this fact!?

Thinking of this, Huangfu Bai’s eyes were full of disbelief.

Ah!!!

In the next moment, no matter how loudly Huangfu Bai roared in his heart, his body slowly dissipated at a speed visible to the naked eye, like sand particles blown away by the wind.

Boom—

The source strength ball has not disappeared and it directly hit the ground in the distance.

Blasting out a huge sinkhole.

The entire Sage warrior space shook violently.

Some warriors in other places were knocked to the ground.

Those with quick responses flew directly into the air and their eyes were full of shock.

At this time, they couldn’t imagine what happened just now.

At this time, Lin Xiu, who was suspended in the air, looked at the moment Huangfu Bai’s body dissipated and a golden light flew out. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He seemed to want to fly away.

“Trying to flee huh!”

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he immediately shouted.

As soon as his body moved, he flew over there at the next moment.

At this moment, a black source mark flashed on Lin Xiu’s forehead.

With the appearance of the source mark, in the next moment, one after another matrix appeared in the sky over there.

The golden light seemed to be able to predict the direction of the matrix in advance and kept dodging at this time.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly at this moment and in the next moment, a matrix directly encased the golden light group in it.

bang bang bang-

At this time, the framed light group was colliding frantically.

But even so, there is still no way to break free from the shackles of this matrix.

“I’m here, you’re still trying to flee?”

Lin Xiu’s figure flew in front of the matrix.

Looking at the golden light group in the matrix, he said faintly.

“Boy! Do you know who I am!”

This golden light group shouted loudly at this time.

His voice was exactly the same as Huangfu Bai’s voice just after ‘God Descend’.

There is no doubt that he was the one who controlled Huangfu Bai’s body just now.

“It was you too previously, right?”

Lin Xiu looked at the golden light group and narrowed his eyes slightly.

In the Tianjiao competition before, the two warriors used ‘God Descend’ and one of the warrior gods that descended had the same voice.

As Lin Xiu spoke, he stretched out his hand to approach the matrix.

“What do you want!”

That ball of golden light seemed to sense something and suddenly let out a loud roar.

“I’m a warrior god…”

As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Xiu’s hand reached directly into the matrix.

This ball of golden light couldn’t get out, but Lin Xiu’s hand could directly reach into the matrix.

The moment he reached in, Lin Xiu directly grabbed the golden ball of light.

At this moment, a tingling sensation struck and Lin Xiu felt that his hand was instantly scalded.

But even so, Lin Xiu didn’t stop what he was doing. While holding the ball of light, he used the ‘Engulf’ skill directly!

He wants to swallow the golden light group directly.

“what!!!”

With the activation of Lin Xiu’s ‘Engulf’ skill, this group of light suddenly let out a wailing sound.

But at this time, Lin Xiu ignored it and continued to use the ‘Engulf’ skill.

“Let me go! Let me go!”

He screamed loudly, but there was no way to break free.

With the use of the ‘Engulf’ skill, this golden light group slowly shrank at a speed visible to the naked eye.

At this time, with the continuous engulfing, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the strength of his body was constantly recovering.

Moreover, the body was also filled with powerful energy.

The energy of this golden light group was extremely strong and Lin Xiu, who devoured this energy, felt that it has benefited him a lot.

“Phew—”

As the golden light group disappeared, Lin Xiu exhaled a breath of turbid air and his body suddenly fell down uncontrollably.

The effect of ‘Fury’ disappeared and the sequelae also followed.

boom–

Lin Xiu’s body fell heavily in the ocean.

gurgle–

The body could not move at all and fell directly to the bottom of the sea.

If it were a normal person, they would definitely drown at this time.

But Lin Xiu, who has unlocked the gene lock, would not be affected.

At this time, Lin Xiu was lying directly on the seabed.

Although his body could not move, with Lin Xiu’s thoughts, his body was still absorbing the energy of this golden light group.

pfft—

At the same time, somewhere in the warrior god Realm, an old man who was sitting cross-legged spat out a mouthful of blood.

His eyes widened and his body fell to the ground uncontrollably.

“Huangfu Gu, what’s wrong!?”

At this moment, another old man came over with shock in his eyes.

Without thinking much, he directly helped the old man up.

“Damn boy…”

The man known as Huangfu Gu turned extremely grim at this time.

“Your strength…”

The old man who helped him up felt that his strength was significantly reduced at this time and his expression changed slightly.

“That kid devoured your divine power!?”

He seemed to have thought of something and said.

Last time, it was the power of the two of them that descended on Huangfu Tian and Huangfu Lin.

But in the end their power was swallowed up by Lin Xiu.

He will not forget this matter.
