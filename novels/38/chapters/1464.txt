1465 Fusion

They wanted to leave, but they were completely blocked by the wall formed by the matrix!

There was no way to leave!

And at this time, there were already a large number of flame meteor showers in the sky, and they began to impact down.

Boom, boom, boom——

There were loud noises all around.

!!

Damn it!

At this time, Xia Guang wanted to break through the space and dodge this terrifying skill.

But at this moment, he discovered that in the huge space surrounded by this matrix.

It seems to be restricted by some special force.

At this moment, there is no way to break open the space!

There is no way to leave!

At this moment, he had no choice but to quickly spread out his ‘Sphere’ to resist.

The terrifying flame of chaos kept coming down like a meteor shower. This extremely dense attack made it impossible for them to dodge.

Boom, boom, boom——

At this time, the entire ground was also continuously shaken by the impact of those Flame of chaos.

The surrounding temperature was so hot that even the air was twisted badly.

The ‘Sphere’ of Xia Guang and others was impacted by the Flame of chaos falling from the sky at this time, and the whole ‘Sphere’ trembled.

At this time, Luo Yue already had a lot of black water energy wrapped around her body.

This minimized the impact of the scorching temperature on her.

Lin Xiu looked at the God warriors around and wanted to dodge, but they were still hit by some flaming meteors that fell down like a meteor shower, and he immediately showed a sneer.

At this time, the spear in his hand continued to aim at the sky.

It forms a dense meteor shower and hits down.

This kind of indiscriminate attack left them nowhere to hide.

“ah!!!”

At the next moment, a God warrior let out a roar, and his entire body fell directly to the side below.

Huangfu Yuanshen, Hetian God King, Spatial God King Xia Guang and others, at the next moment, their bodies were all impacted and flew towards the lower side.

Hu——

At this moment, Lin Xiu took a deep breath, and in the next moment, he continued to release and control a large amount of Flame of chaos, and directly rushed towards the bottom!

The Flame of chaos in the sky, like a pillar of flames, crazily rushed down below.

Boom——

The whole ground was trembling crazily.

A large number of cracks appeared on the ground.

The surrounding stones were all annihilated directly.

Die!!!

Lin Xiu roared angrily at this time.

All the strength in his body was released.

It’s almost time for ‘Fury’ now.

It’s time to kill them!

A large number of Flame of chaos continued to rush towards the bottom.

Using this Flame of chaos still consumes a lot of physical strength. At this moment, Lin Xiu was a little out of breath.

Not dead yet!?

But at this time, Lin Xiu still couldn’t hear the prompt that he had gained experience.

How is this possible? After releasing so many Flame of chaos, there is still no way to kill them!?

Lin Xiu’s complexion also became ugly at this time.

“careful!”

At this moment, Luo Yue clearly felt something, and the pupils in her eyes shrank slightly.

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, when Lin Xiuxiu was about to make a move, he saw a figure appearing in front of him.

Boom——

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s entire body was sent flying.

The whole body flew out and hit the distant mountain range.

Taking a closer look, a man’s figure appeared in the position where Lin Xiu was just now.

“Damn it, let’s use the secret technique.”

At this moment, the man made a strange sound.

Luo Yue looked at the man, and could clearly feel the terrifying aura emanating from his body.

Who the hell is that!?

It seems that they haven’t seen such a powerful existence yet.

“You can call me Huangfu Yuanshen.”

“Combining the power of four god kings, it’s really powerful…”

At this moment he laughed out loud.

The five god kings who were blasted down just now had all practiced a special secret technique.

It is the art of fusion.

It can directly fuse with the bodies of other god kings. After fusion, the power it possesses will become very powerful.

But there is a disadvantage, that is, the new body can only have one soul.

The souls of the rest will be devoured!

And this fusion technique requires both the other party and oneself to operate at the same time.

Just when they felt that Lin Xiu’s Chaos Flame was terrifying and might not be able to sustain it, they made a decision.

Using this fusion technique, whoever has a strong soul will own the physical body produced after fusion!

Obviously, at the moment of Huangfu Yuanshen’s fusion, the divine soul power completely suppressed the divine soul power of other people.

At this time, his new body has similarities to the other four god kings.

Luo Yue held the long sword in her hand, and at this moment, directly attacked Huangfu Yuanshen!

The long sword is about to stab his body!

boom– Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

But at the next moment, the long sword she stabbed was directly grabbed by Huangfu Yuanshen’s right hand!

The pupils in Luo Yue’s eyes shrank slightly, and she was about to continue stabbing into his body with the long sword.

And the power of the black water on the long sword is about to pass into his hand that is holding the long sword.

But as soon as the black water burst out of the long sword, it was shaken by a powerful force and splashed directly towards Luo Yue.

Useless!

“snort!”

At this time, Huangfu Yuanshen let out a cold voice, and the strength of his whole body burst out instantly.

That terrifying force directly sent Luo Yue’s body flying.

It also directly hit the mountain range on the other side and made a loud noise.

The entire mountain range seemed to shake at this moment, and a large number of rocks rolled down from the sky.

“This kind of power is really very comfortable.”

At this time, Huangfu Yuanshen felt that he had a powerful body that fused the power of so many god kings, and his eyes were full of surprise.

“Luo Yue!”

At this time, Lin Xiu had already flown out of the mountain range.

His eyes turned to the other side, and he was about to fly over there.

Looking at this scene, Huangfu Yuanshen sneered.

As soon as his thoughts were triggered, he appeared in front of Lin Xiu in an instant.

Lin Xiu looked at Huangfu Yuanshen who suddenly appeared, and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

Holding the spear in his hand, he subconsciously stabbed towards his body!

Whoosh—

But at this time, Huangfu Yuanshen’s speed was extremely fast.

He dodged Lin Xiu’s spear in an instant.

boom–

And at the next moment, he directly attacked Lin Xiu’s abdomen with his knee.

Poof——

That powerful force made Lin Xiu spit out a mouthful of blood.
