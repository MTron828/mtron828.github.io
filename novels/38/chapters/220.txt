Chapter 221: Tied For First Place!?

The old man seemed a little surprised when he saw this bag of Odd Crystals.

The Sacred Region Academy has always divided its students into classes according to their strengths.

Class 10 of the South Campus could be said to be the weakest class, but what he didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu would come up with so many Odd Crystals.

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu’s strength, it seemed that he was not weak, which made the old man glance at Lin Xiu curiously.

The old man took the machine and directly put the bag of Odd crystals in Lin Xiu’s hand on top of the machine.

At this moment, everyone’s eyes looked at the monitor.

Di di di di——

As a series of sounds rang out, everyone turned to look.

“205 rank 5 Odd crystals, 15 rank 6 Odd crystals.”

“280 points in total.”

280分!?

280 points!?

Zhuo Qixing’s eyes widened at this time.

How could it be possible, how could it be 280 points!!!

Seeing that his ranking was tied with Lin Xiu’s Class 10 of the South Campus, his hands clenched tightly.

The rest of the people all exclaimed. It turned out to be 280 points. Isn’t this the same as Class 1 of the South Campus?!

Tian Zixia glanced at Lin Xiu, and her face became extremely ugly at this time.

She really hated Lin Xiu. If they hadn’t given the Odd Crystals to Lin Xiu, they would definitely have gotten first place!

“Could it be that this Class 10 of the South Campus actually picked up someone else’s Odd crystals? Otherwise, how could there be so many!?” Some students from the other classes, who didn’t know the truth and thought that Lin Xiu was very weak, were very surprised.

“Okay, time’s up, let’s get on the airship and get ready to return.” There was a hint of astonishment in the old man’s eyes.

After so many years, there had never been a tie in the first place.

The decision of who will receive the final reward had become quite troublesome right now.

“How are we going to decide who gets the first place?” Zhuo Qixing stood in front of the old man and asked.

The reward for the first place in this freshman assembly is very generous, he must get it!

“It is relatively rare to have a tie for the first place. I will ask for opinions later.” The old man said lightly.

Zhuo Qixing frowned and seeing that this old man couldn’t make the decision, he clenched his fist bitterly and walked into the airship.

“Damn it! If we collect one more Odd crystal, then the first place would have been ours!” Li Ping clenched his fists and said in a resentful tone.

Lin Xiu also felt a little regretful.

They were so close, so, so close.

He shook his head and walked into the airship with everyone.

Within a short period of one week, in the G17 Ruin, there were only about 60 students left from the original 100 students; nearly 40 people have died in the G17 Ruin.

The number of deaths was quite high.

After all, the people here were all elites.

Luo Yue was exhausted from before. After she drank the nourishment liquid provided on the airship, she sat cross-legged on the ground and cultivated with the ‘Cultivation Techniques’.

“Phew, we’re finally going back.” Zhang Yin and Jiang Li said while sitting on the ground.

The events of the past few days were too terrifying for them, they almost died in the G17 Ruin.

As the airship started to move, yellowish rain began to fall in G17 Ruin and everything around it seemed to corrode slowly.

The surviving students of the Sacred Domain Academy seemed quite battered and they were leaning against the wall behind them as they began to enjoy the rest time they rarely had.

Not long after, the airship arrived at the Sacred Domain Academy. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Boom boom——

The plane began to shake and soon landed.

“We’re here.” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue who had just opened her eyes.

“En.” Luo Yue nodded and stood up too.

At this moment, they were on the other side and the people from Class 1 of the North Campus were helping Ouyang Hang out.

After treatment in the medical cabin on the airship, Ouyang Hang’s mental state has obviously improved a lot.

At this time, he seemed a bit sluggish and was supported by two guys from the North Campus.

Seeing Lin Xiu over there, his face suddenly became ferocious, “I won’t forget this.”

He was gifted and also the class monitor of Class 1 of the North Campus, yet he got beaten up so badly by Lin Xiu. To him, this was a lifelong shame.

“You’re welcome to come over for a beating anytime.” Lin Xiu sneered.

“You…!” Being provoked by Lin Xiu, Ouyang Hang was so angry that his lungs almost exploded.

“I’ll remember this!” He glared at Lin Xiu bitterly, but he couldn’t do anything.

Lin Xiu followed those people out and suddenly saw the dazzling sunlight.

The surrounding air has also become a lot fresher.

The air at G17 Ruin was really unpleasant because of the pollution. Compared to that place, this was simply heaven.

Many students from the Sacred Region Academy who had just walked out of the airship were excited at this time.

They were finally back and finally bid farewell to that place.

“Are you all back?” Nan Zhengjun was already standing there waiting.

Watching Lin Xiu and the others walk out one by one, he couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief and there was a hint of surprise in his eyes.

There were many students who died when they went to the G17 Ruin in the past years.

The combat strength of Class 10 of the South Campus was relatively weak and he wasn’t sure if their lives would be in danger.

Seeing all five of them return safely surprised him.

“Teacher Nan.” Zhang Yin and the others greeted Nan Zhengjun.

“Glad you guys are back.” Nan Zhengjun nodded and looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue who were behind, then smiled at everyone, “The students in our class had done well in the Emerald Forest and got the sixteenth place so the whole class can get a reward of 10,000 points.”

There were a total of 20 classes in the South Campus and the North Campus, and 16th place was not bad for Class 10 in the South Campus.

This was also quite unexpected for Nan Zhengjun. After all, the overall combat strength of Class 10 was definitely at the bottom and if they came in last, it wouldn’t be surprising.

But what he didn’t expect was that the class actually came in sixteenth.

“Okay, let’s go back first. It doesn’t matter what the rankings are and it doesn’t matter if you came in last. After all, our G17 Ruin is still relatively dangerous. It is not that easy to hunt down rank 5 evolved beasts to obtain Odd crystals…”

“Who said we came in last?”
