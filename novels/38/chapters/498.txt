Chapter 499: Combination Skill!

Boom–

In the next moment, as the flaming phoenix slowly disappeared in the air, a skeleton that was a little charred fell directly from the air.

After all, he was a rank 5 warrior and his body has gone through training so the flaming phoenix did not annihilate him completely.

At this time, the people around saw such a horrible scene, their eyes widened in disbelief.

This was really terrifying, one of their powerful comrades just died like this!?

And he turned into a skeleton in an instant!

Those who wanted to attack Lin Xiu, although they were still surrounding Lin Xiu at this time, they didn’t dare to attack him again.

Dang dang dang——

At the same time, Luo Yue was still fighting with Lin Zhen.

Lin Zhen saw the shocking scene from the corner of his eyes but Luo Yue’s offensive was too fierce, if it weren’t for his rich experience in combat, he would have died under Luo Yue’s long sword.

But even if he resisted Luo Yue’s offensive, because of the sword aura bursting from Luo Yue’s long sword, many wounds had appeared on his arm and blood began to drip.

“What are you guys doing! Kill him for me!” Lin Zhen roared. In the next moment, when resisting Luo Yue’s attack, his body suddenly retreated back, his hands maintaining a weird posture.

Before Luo Yue attacked again, he let out a loud roar, “Diamond skill-‘The Tiger Comes Out’!”

As he roared, the source strength in his body seemed to be mobilized at this time, covering his body completely.

His source strength appeared in a faint blue light, like a ‘Sphere’, but it was a bit different.

Lin Zhen applied force on his right leg and the ground under his feet was stamped with cracks by the tremendous force.

His body exploded at an extremely terrifying speed like a gust of wind and he instantly appeared in front of Luo Yue.

And at this time, a terrifying murderous aura burst out of Lin Zhen’s body, causing the pupils in Luo Yue’s eyes to shrink.

Dang dang dang——

As soon as Luo Yue, who reacted very quickly, held the long sword to block, she felt a powerful force.

Lin Zhen was like a tiger coming out of its cage and launched a terrifying attack. He swung his claws and knocked out Luo Yue’s long sword from her hand!

Tear——

Lin Zhen’s sharp claws scratched on Luo Yue’s arm, creating a hole in her clothing and fresh blood sputtered out on the arm.

“How dare you!!!” Lin Xiu who was on the other side saw this scene, his eyes became red.

There was a strong murderous intent in his heart, he was about to rush to Lin Zhen and penetrate his head with the Dark Edge spear!

“Trying to flee!?”

Those men who surrounded Lin Xiu also had their source strength burst out at this time.

And their source strength seemed very weird – they were all fused together.

The light blue source strength materialized and it actually formed the shape of four huge tigers!

There was a tiger in each of Lin Xiu’s four directions, staring at him.

When Lin Xiu rushed forward, one of the ferocious tigers transformed by source strength directly rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Boom–

Lin Xiu wanted to help Luo Yue kill Lin Zhen, but at this time he was hit by the tiger and flew back.

Damn it!

Lin Xiu’s body spun in the air, then he landed firmly on the ground.

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu found that the source strength bursting from the bodies of these warriors had turned into four violent tigers, slowly approaching him in four directions.

Moreover, the tigers transformed from these source strengths even possessed powerful strength!

What is this!?

Could it be… Combination skill!? 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Hahaha, this is the Combination skill of our tyrannical mercenary group! Go to hell!!!”

One of the men shouted suddenly.

At this moment, these four giant tigers rushed onto Lin Xiu’s body!

“Go to hell!” At the same time, Lin Zhen, who was on the other side, saw that Luo Yue was injured and her right hand was covering the wound on her left hand. It seemed that she had lost her strength and his gaze turned ferocious as he rubbed the steel claws of both hands and rushed to Luo Yue!

He wanted to use his claws to tear Luo Yue’s body into pieces!

Although it was a pity to kill Luo Yue, a rare beauty, there was no other way, because he clearly felt that Luo Yue was different from ordinary people and certainly from the Underground World.

This kind of person must not stay alive!

Boom–

But when he was about to tear Luo Yue into pieces with his claw, Luo Yue suddenly raised her head.

Her right hand that was covering her wound grabbed his wrist directly.

Click——

As Luo Yue used force, Lin Zhen’s wrist was twisted directly, making a clear sound.

“Ah…” Even after he had experienced many injuries and pain, he still couldn’t help wailing at this moment.

Because of the intense pain, all the power he had gathered at this moment dissipated and his whole body seemed to soften.

“Did you use Lost Soul Dispersion?” Luo Yue said coldly while looking at him with both eyes.

The murderous intent bursting out of Luo Yue’s body was unusually strong and she looked at Lin Zhen as if she was looking at a dead person.

“Damn…” Lin Zhen’s expression changed a little when he heard Luo Yue’s words, but he still tried to break free.

But as soon as he applied force, Luo Yue grasp his wrist and twisted it violently, making it turn one whole round.

“Ah! Let go of me!!!”

The intense pain made him roar and his left claw was about to grab Luo Yue’s body!

Boom–

But at this moment, Luo Yue lifted her foot and kicked him in the abdomen, sending him flying.

And at this time, his right hand was directly broken off by Luo Yue.

Luo Yue didn’t have any expression on her face and threw her torn right hand on the ground, then walked towards him.

Now Luo Yue’s state has become abnormally weird, especially in this gloomy alley, she seemed to be like a god of death.

“Should… tell…” Lin Zhen looked at Luo Yue who was not far away and his eyes were full of horror. He forcibly suppressed the severe pain of his hand breaking off and slowly stood up.

That’s right, he just used something called Lost Soul Dispersion. Although it was called Lost Soul Dispersion, it was actually a kind of liquid. It was colorless and tasteless. It makes the body extremely weak, which was fatal to the warrior.

When he first fought Luo Yue, he obviously felt that Luo Yue’s strength seemed to be stronger than he imagined, so he used a little trick. He didn’t expect that Luo Yue would discover it so easily!
