Chapter 689 Registration

Lin Xiu and the rest of them once again entered the town of Tianlong City.

“These dogs really discriminate against others.”

Lei Chong looked at the group of men, who had blue eyes and were looking down at them with a despised look. It instantly made Lei Chong feel pissed.

“Just ignore them.”

Lin Xiu said calmly.

He really didn’t care about what they thought.

“Get in line! Quickly get in line!” The counter for the registration of the warrior competition was right in front of them and there was already a huge crowd there.

There were also a few security guards that were regulating the scene.

“You can sign up for it here.”

Chen Lan looked at the crowd in front of him and informed Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Lin Xiu walked forwards and joined the end of the line that was for registration.

Then, Lin Xiu instantly activated his Analytical Eyes.

With the help of the Analytical Eyes, Lin Xiu could clearly see the abilities of the warriors around him.

Lin Xiu frowned and he was shocked as well.

Most of the warriors here were strong. Most of them were rank 7 warriors.

Lei Chong and the rest went to a shop nearby to rest while waiting for Lin Xiu. “Who are you? Move!”

Just then, a loud voice appeared from behind Lin Xiu.

It was a tall, muscular man that was pushing everyone away, standing right behind Lin Xiu.

Just as he was about to push Lin Xiu….

Boom – –

But before he could put his hand on Lin Xiu, Lin XIu had already grabbed onto his. “Where are these peasants from?! Move!!!”

When the man saw that Lin Xiu grabbed his hand, he became furious.

Especially men like Lin Xiu who had dark eyes. For them, men like Lin Xiu were peasants.

He lifted up his hand and was about to hit Lin Xiu’s face!

Crack – –

At that moment, Lin Xiu tightened his grip and everyone around could hear a loud crack that came from the broken bone. It was followed by a loud cry by the muscular man.

He no longer had the energy to punch Lin Xiu.

Boomm – –

Without looking at him, Lin Xiu gave him one good kick and threw him aside.

Koong Loong – – His huge body hit onto one of the rubbish bins that were behind them and it gave out a loud sound.

Everyone else around them looked at Lin Xiu in shock.

The man just now was a famous bully in Tianlong City. He was quite powerful himself as he was a rank 8 warrior. They didn’t expect that Lin Xiu could finish him with just one kick!

Most importantly, Lin XIu wasn’t from the Marqi planet!

“What’s the matter?!”

One of the guards walked towards him with an unfriendly look in his eyes.

“Nothing. He was just trying to cut the queue.”

When Lin Xiu saw the guards walking towards him, he remained calm and was not nervous at all.

“You brat. Did you hit him?!”

When the guard saw how calm Lin Xiu was, he felt unhappy about it.

To him, Lin Xiu was just a lowly peasant.

“It was just self defence.”

Lin Xiu replied flatly.

“Looks like you’re quite arrogant.”

The guard gave a cold laugh. He was about to fight Lin Xiu as he walked towards him.

When Lin Xiu saw what was about to happen, he frowned. These bodyguards weren’t strong enough but if they were to start a fight now, it would still be trouble.

Afterall, this was Tianlong City.

“What are you doing?”

Then, a bright voice came from behind.

When they heard the familiar voice, all of the guards turned around and saw a young girl walking towards them.

“Miss Liu.”

The person walking towards them was Liu Yanran.

When the guards saw that it was her, all of them greeted her respectfully.

“What are you doing?” Liu Yanran looked at Lin Xiu. She thought that his eyes looked familiar but she couldn’t figure out who he was. Lin Xiu had recovered back to his original face. He looked young now and definitely had a different look from when he was a middle aged man.

“Nothing much. This brat here started a fight.” One of the guards smiled and tried to explain to Liu Yanran.

Since Liu Yanran was from the Liu family, the guards respected her as well.

“Hmph! Lin Daxiong, this bully. He deserved it.”

Liu Yanran sneered.

The guards couldn’t say anything else after hearing what she had just said.

“What time would the competition start?”

“In two hours. We will be ending the registration soon. Miss Liu, would you like to take a look inside?”

The guards asked Liu Yanran.

“Sure.”

Liu Yanran nodded her head. She couldn’t help but look at Lin Xiu once again as she felt that he looked familiar. She just couldn’t remember where she met him.

Even with that small incident, Lin Xiu managed to register for the competition.

But in the process, there were lots of people staring at Lin Xiu.

On Marqi Planet, there were many people from other planets that would join this competition.

They always thought that those with dark eyes were lowly peasants from the other planets. “Brother Lin, did it work?”

Soon, Lei Chong saw Lin Xiu walking towards them.

“Yes. I managed to register for it.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and sat on a stool nearby.

The shop was huge but it was still filled with people. There were lots of warriors walking in the shop.

“Brother Lin, this is the Dragon’s drink that is served in Tianlong City. It will help increase your source of energy. Most of the warriors would take one before going for the competition.”

Chen Lan ordered a blue drink and passed it to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu looked at the drink placed right in front of them. There were large amounts of bubbles on top of it, just like coke.

He took a small sip of it and the drink tasted sweet. He could also clearly feel that there was a force that entered into his body.

It felt great.

“This is not too bad.”

Lin Xiu smiled and said.

“Isn’t it? This is really something great. Something that you wouldn’t get back on earth.”

Chen Lan smiled as he said. “It is indeed.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Lei Chong was also trying the blue drink with a straw and he felt satisfied.

Soon there was a huge group of people who walked into the shop and all of the warriors inside turned to look at them.

“Did you see him? Second place on Tianlong List, Qian Jing.”
