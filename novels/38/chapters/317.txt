Chapter 318: Snatch Successful

Although he had grabbed onto Lin Xiu’s fist, the powerful force erupted into his arm!

Crack crack-

All the bones in his arm immediately started to crack.

As a man who knew his body inside out, he was aware that the bones in his body were broken!

His eyes grew large at the thought of this.

He tensed up and did not dare make any reckless moves.

He had just realised that Luo Yue and Lin Xiu wre both covered by a strange light and were both able to move freely inside the water as though they were on land!

And he was suppressed by the influence of the lakewater and his strength had decreased greatly.

Bang-

In that instant, Luo Yue struck with her dagger again. He had no other choice but to use the dagger in his right hand to block her.

Luo Yue swung her dagger elegantly with increasing sharpness and released multiple strikes!

After having his right fist grabbed, Lin Xiu used his left hand to launch another strike!

And this fist also utilised Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist, bringing forth the immense momentum!

The warrior was flustered having to deal with Lin Xiu and Luo Yue’s simultaneous attacks and immediately retreated, planning to escape to the other side.

Although the Ice Lotus Fire was a treasure, it was nothing compared to his life.

With a burst of power, he swam upwards.

“Where do you think you’re going!”

Lin Xiu immediately made a move to chase after the warrior when he realized that the white light around him would decrease as he swam higher.

The pressure in the lake water instantly turned heavier for him.

‘What is going on!?’

Lin Xiu’s expression changed when he noticed this. He immediately stopped himself from chasing the warrior.

The strange light on his body would only remain as long as he remained at the bottom of the lake.

He looked up, the warrior was already far away and it was pointless to continue chasing him.

‘Damn it!’

Lin Xiu clenched his jaws, he had no other choice but to return to the bottom of the lake.

As expected, Lin Xiu was able to sense the white light around him gradually coming back when he reached the bottom.

“You don’t have to chase him.” Luo Yue looked over and said.

Lin Xiu nodded his head and gradually touched the floor and stood beside her.

The ice lotus fire was already within reach. Their close proximity allowed them to have a better look of the ice lotus fire. It resembled a white blossomed lotus flower and was extremely beautiful.

As Lin Xiu and Luo Yue moved, the water around them seemed to change and affected the Ice Lotus Fire.

“What do we do now?” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue and asked.

The light from the ice lotus fire had illuminated their faces.

The light was extremely bright and clear.

And Lin Xiu was able to sense the frigid coldness. The closer they got to the ice lotus fire, the further the chill went into his body.

He activated source strength throughout his body to repel against the frigid coldness.

At this moment, Rollie poked its head out of Lin Xiu’s back and looked around.

Rollie did not seem to be affected or harmed by the white light.

Luo Yue looked at the ice lotus fire without replying. She took out a white and square card that seemed to be made out of a unique material.

She approached the ice lotus fire carefully.

Lin Xiu held his breath and did not speak further when he saw how focused she was.

Luo Yue focused her willpower and held onto the strange card in her hand as she closed in on the ice lotus fire.

Her movements made it seem as though she was in slow motion. Her entire body remained unmoved with only her arm extending out as the card inched closer to the ice lotus fire.

Lin Xiu quickly realized that as the thin card in Luo Yue’s hand got closer, the ice lotus fire was slowly being sucked into it and suddenly appeared on the card!

Whooo-

When she saw that the Ice Lotus fire was absorbed into the silver card, she heaved a sigh of relief.

“That works?” Lin Xiu opened his mouth wide and asked in surprise.

That was because the ice lotus fire had disappeared from its original position and appeared on the square and silver card.

And the flames maintained a perfect state that was exquisite and beautiful.

Who knew what material the card was made out of to be able to control the ice lotus fire flames without being burned?

But after scrutinizing it, Lin Xiu noticed many small engravings on the card that he did not understand.

“We’re heading up now.” Luo Yue nodded her head and said.

Before Lin Xiu could react, Luo Yue grabbed onto his hand and exerted force. The two quickly soared upwards!

Sou-

As they charged upwards, the light around them dissipated at a rate visible to the naked eye!

Bang-

Many of the warriors around the lake were kept in the dark, but did not dare enter the lake.

They observed the surface of the lake and quickly noticed two figures charging outwards. The impact of striking the surface caused a loud explosion.

Whoosh-

As Lin Xiu and Luo Yue landed on the shore, the momentum forced water to spray all around them.

The terrifying water started to burn the ground again.

“Finally out!” Lin Xiu stood on the ground and saw that Luo Yue was fine. He looked at himself and exclaimed in joy.

Luo Yue nodded her head and heaved a sigh of relief. They were in a difficult situation as the white light around them was disappearing. By using a large amount of source strength to envelop them, they prevented themselves from being corroded by the strange lake water.

“They’re out as well?” The warriors looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue with surprised expressions.

When they saw the card with the ice lotus fire in Luo Yue’s hands, their eyes immediately changed.
