Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Go to hell!!!

He roared in his heart and the moment he rushed over, his figure flashed again and he appeared behind Lin Xiu.

Holding the dagger emitting a blue light, he was about to stab Lin Xiu’s head.

Boom—

But at this moment, a terrifying dark blue flame appeared, forming a ‘Sphere’ to resist the man’s attack.

The moment the tip of his sharp blade hit the ‘Sphere’, it was immediately blocked by the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded.

“What!!!”

He roared and the strength of his whole body continued to explode.

He continued to stab with his dagger to try to pierce through Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’!

But at this moment, he felt a terrifying burning sensation on his dagger.

His hands were so hot that he couldn’t even hold the dagger anymore.

As a last resort, he let go of the dagger and stepped back.

At this moment, his dagger melted at a speed visible to the naked eye.

And then it fell to the ground.

The man who retreated to the back looked at his palm and found that it was completely red.

There was also blood spilling out.

He widened his eyes and they were full of disbelief.

Just now, the source strength of his whole body was mobilized, then it covered his body.

Although this defensive effect was not as good as using ‘Sphere’ directly, it was still very strong.

Not only was he injured, but his weapon was also melted away!

This kid, what the hell is going on!?

He looked towards the front and he could clearly see the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded seemed like it formed by a dark blue flame.

“If you get lost now, I don’t need to kill you guys.”

Lin Xiu glanced at them, then said lightly.

“Crazy!”

The man roared angrily just now and the source mark on his forehead lit up.

And the other few warriors also rushed towards Lin Xiu in an instant!

Duan Zeyan watched this scene and the expression in his eyes also changed.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly, looking at the source mark on the man’s forehead and at the same time, with a thought, the black source mark appeared on his forehead.

As Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered, in the next moment, a translucent matrix instantly covered the man’s body.

Not only this man but the men who leaped and attacked were also framed inside.

Just now, the man who wanted to use the source mark power was framed in the matrix and found that his source mark power could not be used at all!

And what’s even more terrifying is that his source strength seems to be bound by strange forces and can’t function.

“Goodbye.”

Lin Xiu said lightly, then snapped his fingers.

Snapped–

With a clear sound, all the warriors who were bound in the matrix suddenly exploded.

boom boom boom —

With a loud noise, those warriors were all wiped out.

All of their source rings flew towards Lin Xiu’s arm.

There were a total of six Source Rings, plus Lin Xiu’s original Source Ring, there are seven Origin Rings.

“All… all dead!?”

Duan Zeyan rubbed his eyes at this time, his eyes were full of shock.

He didn’t expect that these six top-level Respected warrior-level warriors would be killed by Lin Xiu just like that!

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s mind heard system prompts that he gained experience.

But for Lin Xiu, the experience gained was too little.

From the experience bar, it only increased by 0.01%.

“Want to take a look?”

Lin Xiu said lightly as he walked forward.

Duan Zeyan was stunned for a moment, then thought about it and followed Lin Xiu to the front.

He also wanted to see what this so-called treasure actually had.

As Lin Xiu walked, with the triggering of his thoughts, in the next moment, the parchment map appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand from the expansion space.

According to the location marked on the map, Lin Xiu walked out of the town and walked on the endless grassland outside.

Looking up at the sky, he could see a full moon in the sky.

The moonlight shone on Lin Xiu’s body, making the moon-shaped jade pendant around Lin Xiu’s neck look dazzling.

Lin Xiu looked down at the moon-shaped jade pendant, as if a falling moon appeared in front of him.

“wait for me.”

Lin Xiu quickened his pace while speaking as if he was talking to himself.

After walking for some time, according to the sign on the map and looking at the iconic boulder, Lin Xiu stopped.

“right here?”

Duan Zeyan said curiously at this time.

“should be.”

While Lin Xiu said lightly, he pressed the smart watch. As the smart watch projected the screen, Lin Xiu clicked the ‘Scan’ button.

Di di di-

“Ordinary rock.”

Duan Zeyan also started the smartwatch at this time and scanned the rocks over there.

Same display: “Ordinary rock.”

“Is it really here…”

Duan Zeyan said a little suspiciously.

According to his experience of completing tasks here, if there is really any mechanism here, they should be able to scan the information.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

Directly activated the ‘Analytic Eye’ in his system.

With the continuous increase of his level, the ability of ‘Analytic Eye’ has also become stronger and stronger.

Many things could be analyze.

“Mechanism Rock: Cover the rock with both hands and pour source strength in to activate the mechanism.”

As Lin Xiu used the ‘Analytic Eye’, in the next moment, some textual information appeared in his mind.

I see.

Lin Xiu put away the parchment map and put his hands on the rock.

With the triggering of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the source strength in his body was transferred into this rock!

Duan Zeyan looked at Lin Xiu’s movements and his eyes were full of doubts.

This rock was obviously just an ordinary rock, what was he trying to do?

Just when he was puzzled, he saw that a faint white light began to appear on the body of the rock.

And this light has changed from a weak light to a dazzling light!

At this time, as Lin Xiu continued to pour the source strength into it, the rock seemed to swell up.

Lin Xiu clearly felt something was wrong and the pupils in his eyes constricted. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Boom—

At the next moment, as the rock continued to expand, a huge explosion occurred in an instant.

The surrounding ground trembled wildly.

At the location of the rock just now, a huge ray of light bloomed.

The entire grassland seemed to turn into a vast expanse of white in an instant!
