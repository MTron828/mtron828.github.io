1048  Black Source Mark

And their arms seemed to have exploded!

"Come here quickly!"

And Ji Mei also seized this opportunity at this time to save Bingbing and Lanlan back to her side.

"Uncle Zhang, kill him."

Tang Qi ignored Ji Mei at this time, but instead looked at Lin Xiu and suddenly felt that all this was done by Lin Xiu.

As soon as Tang Qi's words fell, the middle-aged man of the Sage warrior level appeared in front of Lin Xiu in an instant, reaching out to grab Lin Xiu's shoulder.

swoosh— Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

But at this moment, Lin Xiu's figure flashed and he easily dodged.

When Sage warrior saw that he had grabbed the air, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

There was a look of disbelief in his eyes.

Because he clearly felt that Lin Xiu was just an ordinary warrior, why did he suddenly burst out with such a powerful force!?

Lin Xiu appeared in the back at this moment.

"Lin Xiu, I'll deal with..."

Ji Mei looked at this scene at this moment and said aloud.

Originally, this was the grievance between them and Ji Mei was very grateful for Lin Xiu's help just now.

Now if Lin Xiu got involved in this matter, she would indeed feel very sorry.

"It's okay, I just like to find trouble."

Lin Xiu said lightly.

To Lin Xiu, this was a chance for him to gain experience, an incomparable amount of experience!

"Hmph, Uncle Zhang, kill him."

Tang Qi stared at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

But this time, before the Sage warrior could make a move, Lin Xiu had already rushed towards him!

At the moment of rushing over, with a thought, the Dark Edge spear appeared in his hand.

As the source strength passed over, the body of the Dark Edge spear became like amethyst glass.

The warrior's eyes changed slightly and with a wave of his right hand, a sword also flew over to his hand.

Dang--

The moment the spear stabbed out, he held the sword to resist.

Lin Xiu wielded the Dark Edge spear in both hands, using the Destiny Spear art and attacked frantically.

This spear art was really too sharp, too vicious, every strike was aimed at the opponent's fatal point.

This Sage warrior's eyes also changed greatly at this time.

The sword in his hand also waved wildly.

Following the battle between the two, a large number of cracks appeared in the surrounding ground.

All those tables and chairs were knocked out.

Tang Qi also stepped back at this time, looking at this scene with an unbelievable look in his eyes.

What the hell is going on here, how can this kid be so powerful!?

He just felt that Lin Xiu was just an ordinary warrior!

"Tang Qi!"

At this moment, Ji Mei shouted loudly and attacked Tang Qi from the other side with a long sword.

"Block her for me!"

Tang Qi looked at Ji Mei who was attacking and his body retreated subconsciously and there was a look of horror in his eyes.

Although Ji Mei had just advanced to become a Sage warrior not long ago, her strength was not comparable to that of Tang Qi, a top-ranked warrior.

As soon as Tang Qi's words fell, the other two warriors stood in front of Ji Mei.

At this time, her companions Bingbing and Lanlan were also holding weapons to help Ji Mei attack.

"Your opponent is me."

Lin Xiu sneered when he saw that the Sage warrior wanted to help Tang Qi and his figure quickly appeared in front of the warrior.

With a wave of the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he attacked him with a dark blue flame!

This Sage warrior used the sword to resist.

But when the sword touched the Dark Edge spear with a dark blue flame, his sword seemed to be directly burned red.

The extremely scorching feeling was transmitted to his hand, almost causing him to throw away the weapon in his hand.

It's hot, it's really too hot!

When the Sage warrior stepped back directly to the back, a dazzling light burst out from his body.

Domain force.

This Sage warrior seems to want to use domain force.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu snorted coldly and in the next moment, his 'Purification Domain' was also activated directly.

The moment the Sage warrior's domain force was used, it completely disappeared.

What's the matter!?

The Sage warrior, who felt all this, widened his eyes.

How could his own domain force disappear!?

Before he could think about it, Lin Xiu already held the spear in his hand and attacked his body!

The speed of this shot was too fast and the Sage warrior had no choice but to unfold the 'Sphere' directly.

boom--

As the spear tip of the spear stabbed into his 'Sphere', a loud sound suddenly erupted.

Although it didn't directly break his 'Sphere', the powerful impact still made his body smashed through the wall at the back and flew out directly.

Lin Xiu carried the spear and continued to rush out.

It's not that easy to kill a Sage warrior-level warrior.

As soon as he rushed out, he found that the body of this Sage warrior was already suspended in the air.

There were many warriors around, watching the battle here.

Lin Xiu's thoughts were triggered at this time and his body flew directly into the air.

The moment Lin Xiu flew into the air, the warrior showed a sneer and the source mark on his forehead suddenly appeared.

Black source mark.

Hm!?

Lin Xiu, whose eyes were very sharp, saw this scene and the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

The source mark on the man's forehead turned out to be black.

Then it means that it was the spatial source mark.

Lin Xiu also became vigilant at this time and his 'Sphere' unfolded.

boom--

In the next moment, a huge hole opened up in the space behind Lin Xiu.

An incomparably huge black claw directly grabbed Lin Xiu's body and dragged Lin Xiu into this space.

This Sage warrior also rushed into this space at this time.

The beast was extremely huge and its huge black claws were pinching Lin Xiu's body.

But on the 'Sphere' that Lin Xiu unfolded, there was a dark blue hellfire.

The giant beast grabbed Lin Xiu's hand and was instantly burned by the dark blue flame.

Roar--

It seemed to feel severe pain and the beast's claws were released directly.

Lin Xiu's body was also suspended in the space at this time.

Under the protection of 'Sphere', he did not suffer any scars.

It's just that the surrounding scene surprised him.
