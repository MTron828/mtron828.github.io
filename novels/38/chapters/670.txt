Translatr: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Okay, we’ll wait for you to come back.”

Baili Haoling also said aloud at this time.

After saying a few more words, Lin Xiu hung up the phone the next moment.

“The spaceship is ready to take off… All passengers please pay attention to safety, and I wish you a pleasant journey…”

Soon, as the spaceship swayed, Lin Xiu could hear the voice of the staff.

“Tm going to rest first.”

Lin Xiu felt a little tired at this time. He didn’t think much about it, he just lay on the bed and fell asleep quickly.

After some time, Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, he could feel that his body seemed to have become a lot lighter.

“Tt looks like I’m already in space now…”

Lin Xiu slowly woke up, turned on the light, and said aloud to himself.

Although the spaceship could adjust the gravity, but at this time in space, it still felt a little bit affected.

Lin Xiu stretched, then put on the Star Moon God armor from that day’s lottery, put on a coat outside, and then walked out.

As soon as he walked out, the surrounding area was full of light and because of the lighting, it seemed to be like daytime.

Walking outside, Lin Xiu found that there were quite a few warriors walking around in the hall.

There were more than a dozen people standing there, looking at the front.

Lin Xiu was stunned when he saw this scene, and then followed their gaze to the front, and he could see that there was a huge projection screen ahead.

The scene of a certain area was playing on the screen.

This was a desert, and there were huge and terrifying evolved beasts in the desert.

According to the subtitles below, this area was one of the dangerous areas of Marqi planet.

Lin Xiu looked at it and thought it was a little interesting.

Because this film was about the condition of Margi planet.

The level of danger on the Margi planet was far more terrifying than on earth.

There were many rank 9 evolved beasts.

Moreover, there were quite a few countries on Marqi Planet, and the warriors of these countries seemed to be stronger than those on Earth.

“Lin Qi

Just as Lin Xiu was watching intently, he heard a voice coming from his side.

Looking to the side, he saw Lei Tong coming over.

“Are you watching this too? I finished it when I first got on the spaceship.”

Lei Tong drank a drink and said to Lin Xiu.

“En, just taking a look.” Lin Xiu nodded, and then said lightly.

“The people on this Marqi planet seem to be very strong, and those evolved beasts are too terrifying.”

Lei Tong was still looking at the projection and continued to speak.

“It’s alright.”

Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

“By the way, brother, what on earth are you going to do on Margi planet?”

Lei Tong said a little curiously at this time.

Because the Margi planet was too dangerous, and only now did Lin Xiu realize that he and the others were the fifth group of people who went to this planet.

“Find someone.”

Lin Xiu didn’t say much, and said lightly.

“are you looking for someone too?” Lei Tong was startled, and then said subconsciously.

“I want to train, do you know where there is a training place here?”

Lin Xiu did not continue to talk about this topic, but changed the subject.

“Yes, over there, I just trained there.”

Lei Tong pointed to the area over there.

“Tl go too, let’s train together.”

Lei Tong said.

He and Lei Tong walked to the other side, and soon, Lin Xiu saw a huge training ground in front of him.

‘There were already more than a dozen people here, waving their weapons and training.

“What weapon do you use?”

Lei Tong waved a sword on the side and said.

As he swung his sword, there seemed to be a sound of breaking the air around him.

Seeing Lei Tong’s complacent appearance, Lin Xiu smiled, then shook his head.

“Brother, do you think I can’t do it?”

Lei Tong was a little unhappy when he saw Lin Xiu’s reaction.

After all, he practiced using a long sword for a long time.

“Tma rank 7 warrior after all, this.

Just when Lei Tong wanted to brag with pride, Lin Xiu directly took a long sword next to him and attacked him!

“Damn!”

When Lei Tong saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly, and then in the next moment, he quickly resisted with his long sword.

However, the long sword seemed to be integrated with Lin Xiu, and the offensive was extremely fierce.

Dang dang-

Under the collision of the two long swords, there was a sound of metal collision after another, and sparks burst out.

Swoosh—

Soon, at the next moment, Lin Xiu’s long sword was placed on his neck.

Lei Tong’s eyes widened suddenly, and his body stopped moving.

“My swordsmanship isn’t bad, is it?”

Lin Xiu smiled lightly at this time and said aloud.

In the next moment, the long sword in his hand was removed from his neck.

“Brother, I didn’t expect that you are also a master with swords.”

At this moment, Lei Tong secretly swallowed his saliva and said aloud.

“How long have you been practicing?”

Lei Tong was a little curious. After all, he was very confident in his swordsmanship, but the skill that Lin Xiu showed was really shocking.

He didn’t even have the strength to fight back.

“Thaventt practiced for long.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

Because of the cultivation at the top of the Tower of Trials at that time, he was able to basically master many weapons.

“Brother Lin, you are just bragging now.”

Of course Lei Tong didn’t believe it – how is it possible!

Lin Xiu smiled and didn’t say much, then took other weapons and continued to train here.

It would take about a week to get there. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

At this time, Lin Xiu was just practicing.

Time passed quickly. In the past few days, Lin Xiu and Lei Tong were training in the training room here.

During the training process, although Lei Tong did not see what skills Lin Xiu cultivated, he was shocked by the solid foundation that Lin Xiu showed.

On this day, when the two were preparing to continue their training, the entire spacecraft had a violent shaking.

“What happened!?”

At this moment, Lei Tong’s eyes widened and supported himself, otherwise he would fall.

Lin Xiu frowned at this moment, and the surrounding area suddenly lit up with red warning lights!
