Chapter 399: Fire and Electricity

But at this moment, a sound came from outside the gate.

These people in black looked ahead and saw a woman walking in with two lunch boxes.

As the ordering system in the villa broke down that day, Luo Yue went out to buy dinner, but when she came back, she saw Lin Xiu being suppressed by Yu Yi on the ground.

At this time, the look on Luo Yue’s face could not help but change.

“Kill her too!” Out of the corner of Yu Yi’s eyes, he saw Luo Yue walking in. He thought she was Lin Xiu’s girlfriend or something and suddenly shouted.

He couldn’t let other people on campus know about this matter. Otherwise, if you openly kill your classmate at the Sacred Region Academy, the consequences of this matter were very serious and he would die too!

When those people in black heard Yu Yi’s words, they did not hesitate and directly drew out their long swords to attack Luo Yue.

Swish——

Luo Yue looked at that side and saw the thin-winged long sword on the other side of the room.

She triggered her mind and the long sword flew directly to her side!

The sword is coming!

Luo Yue held the long sword and made a 180-degree horizontal split, blocking all the attacks of those in black!

“Boy, you are dead this time…!” Yu Yi said coldly as he looked at Lin Xiu, whom he had suppressed to the ground and was holding the Dark Edge spear against his right claw.

While he was talking, his left claw was already raised high.

There was a cold glow on the claws and they looked terrifyingly sharp.

“Tell me, where is that skill card now?” Yu Yi said coldly while looking at Lin Xiu.

A lot of lightning continued to surround his body, but Yu Yi still didn’t seem to be affected much.

“I don’t know what you’re talking about.” Lin Xiu stared at him, then said faintly.

The strength of Yu Yi’s right hand was really too great. If Lin Xiu’s hands relax, this sharp claw would probably pierce his chest.

And now Yu Yi’s other claw has already been raised and he was about to attack Lin Xiu!

“That diamond skill card! Even if you don’t tell me now, I will find it eventually!” Yu Yi saw that Lin Xiu didn’t have the slightest fear at this moment and suddenly became angry.

Ouyang Hang’s diamond skill card was very important. If Lin Xiu learns this body skill, then Ouyang Hang would definitely be enraged and he will definitely blame Yu Yi for all this!

With this thought, Yu Yi’s expression became even more sinister.

Lin Xiu did not answer his words and now the lightning on his body became even more terrifying.

The wooden boards on the ground around him were blackened by the terrifying lightning.

“I’m surprised that you can turn source strength into lightning, but I’m a cyborg! It’s useless against me!” Yu Yi, who felt that the current had become stronger, burst out laughing.

At the next moment, he retracted his smile and said grimly, “Since you refuse to say, then…you shall die!”

As soon as he spoke, his claw swung towards Lin Xiu’s body!

Snapped–

But at this moment, he felt his left hand going a little out of control.

“You… overcharged, right?” Lin Xiu, who was suppressed on the ground, smiled and said aloud.

“You…!” Yu Yi was stunned, then he realized that although ordinary electric current had no effect on him, the terrifying high-voltage electricity released by Lin Xiu was a bit too much for some parts of his body.

At this time, there was a lot of lightning that had been absorbed into his body and it burst out from his skin, making ‘popping’ sounds.

The body’s reaction ability also seemed to have slowed down.

Good chance!

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate at all. He seized this opportunity and sent Yu Yi flying with his Dark Edge spear!

Dang dang dang——

On the other side, Luo Yue was still fighting the men in black.

The long sword was like a part of Luo Yue’s body, constantly attacking those people with an extremely fierce offensive.

Boom–

While attacking with the long sword, Luo Yue waved her palm and smacked the body of a man in black who wanted to attack from behind.

Boom——

As soon as the man’s body was hit by Luo Yue, a large amount of white flame spread all over his body!

He turned into a man in flames instantly.

And this weird flame didn’t burn his body but directly froze it instead!

In a short moment, he turned into an iceman!

Luo Yue’s long sword moved in a circular arc and after blocking the men who had attacked again, she kicked the frozen man with her right foot!

Boom–

With a dull sound, the frozen man broke into dozens of pieces!

Seeing this horrifying scene, there was a look of fear in the eyes of the men in black.

But they were well-trained after all and were not ordinary warriors. At this moment, they continued to attack Luo Yue with the long sword in their hands.

Luo Yue played with swords since she was born and she could block the attacks of these people very easily!

“You can’t move now, right?” On the other side, Lin Xiu stood up and the tip of the Dark Edge spear pointed directly at Yu Yi.

The simple patterns on the Dark Edge spear flashed with the fluctuation of Lin Xiu’s source strength and they looked very mysterious.

“Hng!” Yu Yi looked at Lin Xiu, his eyes showed incomparable killing intent.

But now he was a little bit powerless because he had just absorbed too much electricity and his body felt a bit overloaded.

Damn, this wouldn’t happen usually…

“Are you curious?” Just when Yu Yi was puzzled, the corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up as he looked at him and said faintly.

“In my lightning, there is a little red lotus fire power.”

That’s right! Lin Xiu just found out as well – the red lotus fire’s power which was able to burn everything could actually converge with lightning!
