Chapter 80: Battling Tang Mubai!

Lin Xiu rode on the android wolf and left Xing Yao City. As he moved along, he discovered that there were extremely large and tall trees everywhere with only a road in the center.

Lin Xiu’s ears were perked up as he heard rustling noises. Although it was very faint, Lin Xiu was able to hear it clearly.

There were experienced people approaching. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu smirked, and in the next second, he pushed himself forward and his right hand formed a fist as he struck down into some dense trees without hesitation.

Bang-

A groan was heard as a guy was sent flying by Lin Xiu’s punch.

“Kill him!”

All of the people no longer bothered about concealing themselves seeing how Lin Xiu had struck at their location and came out in a swarm.

Lin Xiu looked at the people that came from all over the place but did not panic. He snorted and quickly dodged an incoming blade and punched the man in the chest.

The man’s eyes constricted from the punch, he felt as though all of his organs had exploded as he spat out blood.

“Congratulations Master for killing a rank 1 warrior, experience points earned…”

The experience points notification rang out in his head but Lin Xiu did not bother about it. He continued to launch his fists at the people around.

The ambushers were shocked at the sight of him.

They clearly sensed that his aura was weak, how could his strength be so terrifying?

Just when they were in shock, Lin Xiu killed another few warriors with his bare hands.

The horrifying power of Rupturing Fist came from its ability to break through the defense. Although a warrior’s skin and muscle might be extremely thick, their organs were weak. He was able to destroy them from within with just one punch.

In the short span of a few minutes, the ambushers were all lying on the ground.

The disguise was truly a good skill, everyone thought that his aura was weak and had lowered their guard.

“Time for you to come out.” Lin Xiu looked on top of a tree in front of him and sneered.

Just as he said that, a figure jumped down and stared at Lin Xiu with killing intent.

“Who would have thought that you would come this far!”

Tang Mubai held a sword in hand as he looked at Lin Xiu. He wanted to hack Lin Xiu into pieces.

“You talk a lot of nonsense.” Lin Xiu snorted as he used his right foot to step onto a dead warrior’s silver spear end.

The spear shot up into the air. Lin Xiu extended his right hand and caught the spear.

Although the spear could not be compared to Silver Immortal Soul spear, it was sufficient.

“Courting death!” Tang Mubai moved, his legs barely touched the floor like how a dragonfly grazes the water surface and charged towards Lin Xiu.

He was fast, but Lin Xiu was not slow either.

Bang bang bang-

The two used their weapons at the same time. Everytime their weapons collided, a large number of sparks would be produced.

Tang Mubai finally realized how terrifying Lin Xiu truly was from this exchange.

Every attack of his wielded powerful strength that was comparable to that of a rank 3 warrior!

Lin Xiu felt some pressure. Tang Mubai’s strength was close to that of a rank 4 warrior and he had to struggle somewhat. Additionally, Fury’s cooldown would only be cleared the following day.

Faced against Tang Mubai’s vicious attacks, Lin Xiu could not dodge and had to unleash his spear to counterattack. In that split second, multiple cold auras flashed out!

Torrential storm of rose flowers!!

Tang Mubai’s pupils constricted as he dodged it subconsciously.

Tang Mubai’s strikes struck the tree ahead of him, and with a loud bang, the tree was instantly torn apart.

Tang Mubai raised his sword after dodging the attack and swung it at Lin Xiu.

A powerful sword Qi shot out in the shape of a crescent straight towards him.

This crescent was extremely strong and caused ripples in the air while producing a static sound that could make the scalp go numb.

Lin Xiu was shocked and immediately bent his back to dodge!

The ‘crescent’ sword qi instantly cut a few large trees that stood in a straight line!

“I’m not done yet!” Tang Mubai roared when he saw Lin Xiu’s successful dodge and continued to swing his sword like a maniac.

Silver Sword Skill – Crescent Slash!!!

Multiple crescent swords Qi shot out from Tang Mubai’s sword.

Upon colliding into a tree, they would all tear apart.

Lin Xiu struck the ground with the spear and relied on the momentum to fly into the air.

“Awe of the Phoenix!!!”

Lin Xiu roared out loud as the spear in hand unleashed clang sounds as though it was wailing.

A minute flame that started from the spear end blossomed and surged up to the spear tip.

Lin Xiu held onto the spear tightly and swept it upwards to produce a gigantic phoenix. It flew upwards and clashed right into Tang Mubai’s crescent sword qi!

Bang-!

The phoenix collided with the crescent sword Qi as though a meteor and struck the ground and exploded.

The humongous explosion immediately formed a powerful gale that swept all the leaves to the ground.

It was as though a small earthquake had occurred.

As the first collision between the phoenix and crescent sword qi disappeared, a second phoenix erupted from Lin Xiu’s spear!

One after another, multiple phoenixes appeared. It was an extremely majestic sight.

“I’m not afraid of you no matter how many phoenixes you have!” Tang Mubai’s face became sinister as the veins in his hands bulged. He unleashed a powerful swing as many crescent sword qi flew out and collided into Lin Xiu’s phoenixes.

In theory, he was a peak rank 3 warrior that should suppress Lin Xiu’s skills. Who would have thought that it would turn out as a draw!

Tang Mubai gradually calmed down and took a deep breath. He held the sword with both hands and raised his sword high.

“Gold skill – Ninth Heaven Phoenix Dance!!!”
