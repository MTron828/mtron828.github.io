Chapter 306: Killed With One Move

Dang dang dang——

Obviously, this man didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would directly counterattack and he was so ruthless!

Lin Xiu swung the spear multiple times in just a few seconds, which caused even a rank 6 warrior like himself almost unable to block.

The long spear in his hand was hit by Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear. At this moment, the huge force caused his hand to turn numb and he nearly dropped his weapon.

At this moment, Lin Xiu did not give him the slightest chance to breathe. Holding the Dark Edge spear, he continued to attack him wildly!

He wanted to kill him directly!

“Boy, don’t be too savage!” Seeing that his companions appeared to be at a disadvantage with Lin Xiu’s fierce offensive, some of the warriors’ expressions changed greatly.

A warrior rushed over at this instant like he wanted to help this man attack Lin Xiu.

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, his gaze suddenly changed. Then, in the next instant, his body moved. When the man rushed over and was about to slash his body, Lin Xiu directly retracted the Dark Edge spear that was thrust out and dodged.

“Hng! You can’t even deal with a kid!?” The man’s saber suddenly cut through the air as he stared at the man next to him.

“I was just a little careless.” The man who had been resisting Lin Xiu’s attacks just now returned to his senses and retorted.

At this moment, he was still a little scared, Lin Xiu’s attacks were really beyond his expectation.

The spear moved too quickly and it was so sharp that he was in a daze for a while.

If his companion hadn’t come over just now, at this moment, he might have been penetrated by Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear!

With that thought, he shuddered in fear.

This kid looks so young, how can his strength be so terrifying?

“Tsk tsk, kid, you seem pretty good.” The man who attacked just now and wanted to cut Lin Xiu in half stared at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“I’m all right, just a little better than you.” Lin Xiu said indifferently.

These people were quite strong indeed, but Lin Xiu was quite powerful too. As long as his opponent wasn’t a rank 7 warrior, he could still fight against him.

It would just be a bit more difficult to deal with.

After all, rank 6 warriors could use ‘Sphere’ to form a protective film on the body to protect themselves, which was still quite troublesome for Lin Xiu.

If he had become a rank 6 warrior, he wouldn’t have to be afraid of these people at all.

“You’re not bad, huh.” Hua Tian looked at Lin Xiu, then the corners of his mouth curled up and he nodded subtly at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu felt a little weird to be stared at by Hua Tian, it felt as if he was being stared at by a male homosexual.

‘Is this guy gay?’

With that thought, Lin Xiu suddenly felt a chill.

“If you simply left the Odd crystals in your backpack behind just now, you could have left. But now, that’s not going to happen.” At this moment, the man took the saber in his hand and walked towards Lin Xiu step by step.

There was a powerful force in his body and as soon as the Analytic Eye was activated, Lin Xiu could clearly see that this guy was a peak rank 6 warrior and would soon reach the level of a rank 7 warrior.

“He is my prey!” The man who was holding the long sword roared at this moment, then rushed over with the long sword in his hand. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Because of what happened just now, he wanted to kill Lin Xiu to prove his strength.

Otherwise, it would be too embarrassing to be pushed to such an extent by a young man who looked like a rank 5 warrior.

He wouldn’t be able to lift his head in the team as well.

“Your opponent is here.” Just as he was about to rush over, Hua Tian appeared in front of him.

At this moment, Hua Tian looked at the man with the long sword who flew into a rage out of humiliation and said with a faint smile.

“Courting death!!!”

The man was already enraged and when he saw Hua Tian running over, he got even angrier. Then, with the long sword in his hand, he was about to deal with the obstacle that stood in front of him!

At this moment, he didn’t dodge and used his strongest skill. The long sword in his hand was like a bright light that charged directly towards Hua Tian’s body!

There was no change in Hua Tian’s expression but when the man with the long sword had charged over, Hua Tian moved all of a sudden.

Swish swish swish——

Before the man could react, he heard a sound cutting through the air.

His eyes widened and the pupils in his eyes shrank at this moment.

Bang bang bang——

He hadn’t even gotten close to Hua Tian. At this moment, his body exploded into dozens of pieces and blood splashed all over the ground in an instant.

Dang–

And the long sword in his hand also flew out directly then struck to the ground.

This move again!!!

Lin Xiu, who was not far away, had a change of expression when he saw this scene. The moves used by this guy were obviously the same as when he killed Su Xie previously.

Lin Xiu wondered how many times he waved his sword within that short moment and immediately sliced the man’s body into dozens of pieces.

What kind of skill is this!? This is too scary.

Not only Lin Xiu, but the warriors around had a change in expression when they witnessed this scene.

The warrior who was holding the saber and wanted to attack Lin Xiu just happened to see this scene as soon as he turned around and he seemed to be stunned.

There was a shock in his eyes.

Killed with one move!

“You want some too?” Hua Tian waved his right hand and after shaking away the blood on the long sword in his hand, he looked at the man and asked with a smile.

His smile seemed very bright but it sent chills down his spine.

He could smile like that even after slicing a person to pieces.

This guy is very dangerous.

The middle-aged man who was the leader was a rank 7 warrior. At this moment, his eyes widened, as if he thought of something and there was a little fear in his eyes.

“Cheng Dong, let’s go.” He said while looking at the man with the saber.

“Go!?”

The man was surprised when he heard his leader’s words.

One must know that the man just killed his team member and at this moment, they were going to retreat without taking revenge!?
