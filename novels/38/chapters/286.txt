Chapter 287: Go, Rollie!

“Is that so?” Lin Xiu snorted coldly, clearly unaffected by his words. He held Dark Edge tightly and continued to attack!

Overlord Spear Art was extremely tyrannical. As Lin Xiu continued to strike, vacuum explosions were released in the air.

The man found that it became more taxing as the fight with Lin Xiu dragged on.

In the end, he was forced into a corner.

His expression had turned ugly at this point. Damn it! How is he so strong!

‘This doesn’t make sense, he is clearly a rank 5 warrior!’

To make it worse, Guo Ling, Chen Jin, Wan Qianshui had rushed forward and battled against his subordinates.

Qian Lin was still healing Qiu Li at the side.

After all, it was a detached arm and if they did not heal it right, future problems might arise.

And not being able to move an arm properly was extremely fatal to warriors.

He glanced at Qiu Li while fighting Lin Xiu and then at Qian Lin as he revealed a sinister smile.

“The few of you, go and kill those two!” He roared out loud.

The remaining two warriors heard the man and immediately reacted as they charged towards Qian Lin and Qiu Li.

They moved extremely quickly and bypassed Guo Ling and the others towards Qian Lin and Qiu Li!

“Be careful!” Qiu Li’s pupils constricted when he saw them and roared out loud subconsciously.

Qian Lin heard his warning and turned to see the two warriors with their swords at her!

The fiery tornado formed from Lin Xiu’s Awe of the phoenix had lit up the entire place.

“Go, Rollie!” Lin Xiu’s expression changed and threw Rollie out after taking it out from his bag!

‘What’s that!?’

The man fighting with Lin Xiu was stunned when he saw Lin Xiu throw a pale blue object.

‘A bomb!?’

‘Impossible, the distance is too close and all of them will be killed, even his teammates.’

‘And if it is a weak bomb, it’s useless.’

Just as he was pondering about the object, Lin Xiu’s spear continued to attack him!

Qian Lin watched the two enemies charge at her while still holding onto the medicinal liquid and aiding Qiu Li. She was not in time to take her weapon to block them!

“Ahhh!!!”

In the crucial moment of life and death, the man in the lead suddenly felt an immense pain on his back. He fell to the ground and howled in anguish.

He dropped the weapon in his hand and extended his hands to his back.

“What’s going on!?” The man that was charging alongside him with the intent of killing Qian Lin and Qiu Li was shocked for his life when he saw the bizarre scene.

He stopped in his tracks and asked in bewilderment.

“Pain!!! It hurts so badly!!!”

His companion roared in anguish as the meat on his cheeks seemed to clench tightly, making him look extremely sinister.

He clawed at the back of his neck for a long time and threw a circular blue object away.

His neck was already bloodied and his bones and windpipe could be seen.

His companion saw the gruesome scene and his entire body trembled as fear crept into his eyes.

‘What the hell is going on!?’

‘Terrifying, it’s terrifying. If it was me…’

“Save…”

The warrior struggled and tried to say something, but his eyes opened wide and he trembled one last time before breathing his last breath.

His eyes were still enlarged as though he was unresigned to his death.

“You….” The man beside him opened his mouth and wanted to say something, but could not finish his sentence.

He looked to the other side to see the round object that seemed to have arms and legs.

It was pale blue and looked like a meatball.

“What is that?!”

Qian Lin and Qiu Li were stunned as well, they witnessed the entire scene of how the thing latched itself on the guy’s neck and after being ripped off, the man died right away.

The object was actually the blue meatball.

“I saw Lin Xiu throw that thing over…” Qiu Li opened his mouth and blurted out.

He heard Lin Xiu as well and watched Lin Xiu threw the object over.

It seemed that the blue round object was what Lin Xiu had thrown.

“What the hell is that! Die!” The man finally reacted. He no longer attacked Qian Lin and Qiu Li but instead wielded his saber and attacked the round ‘meatball’ that posed a huge threat.

He charged over while Rollie rolled over!

It moved extremely quickly like a bowling ball rolling downslope.

“Die!” The man’s eyes changed as he slashed at the object.

Sou-

But his slash missed and cut thin air!

Rollie actually jumped as he hacked down and rolled on the saber!

It rolled onto his arm with extreme speed.

Rollie’s body seemed to possess a unique stickiness that prevented it from falling.

“Go away! Get off me!!!” The man was overwhelmed with shock when Rollie landed on his body. He threw his saber on the ground and started to pull the meatball thing off his arm.

But Rollie moved extremely quickly and arrived on his shoulder. As he reached out for it, Rollie jumped onto his face.
