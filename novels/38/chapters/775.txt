Chapter 776: Want My Life!

“Damn!”

Qian Qiurong also rushed over at this time.

He looked exhausted now.

Seeing that a large number of warriors were still attacking the Raging Flame Lion, Qian Qiurong’s eyes could not help but change.

A bunch of fools!

The best thing had already been taken away!

Qian Qiurong ignored this now and looked around, still chasing after Lin Xiu.

He thought that Lin Xiu should not have absorbed the power of the amethyst divine water so quickly. Now he can only find Lin Xiu, then maybe kill him and still be able to get the amethyst divine water that has not been absorbed!

“Damn it! Why is there still magma on the ground here...”

Liu Pan and the others also rushed forward at this time.

At this time, he could clearly see the extremely high-temperature magma in the cracks on the ground.

If you step on it accidentally, the consequences will be disastrous.

“I wonder what happened to him...”

An Qi and Qian Lin had not noticed Lin Xiu’s voice by this time.

Just when they wanted to continue their search, a figure appeared in front of them, startling them.

They all held the weapons in their hands subconsciously and wanted to attack.

“It’s me.” Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu said with a smile at this time.

“Brother Lin, you’re back!?”

Looking at Lin Xiu’s figure, Liu Pan said in surprise.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded.

At this time, his whole being felt very comfortable.

Moreover, Lin Xiu was very pleasantly surprised in his heart.

My body, I can clearly feel it, the power is much stronger than before!

More than that, an indescribable change has taken place everywhere.

“Master, where did you go just now?!”

An Qi and Qian Lin looked at Lin Xiu and heaved a sigh of relief. Although his clothes were a little tattered, it seemed like he was fine.

“Went into the cave of the Raging Flame Lion to take a look.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

He didn’t expect that there was such a thing inside.

Taking a closer look, although his experience has not increased a lot, all the structures of his body had undergone earth-shaking changes.

As Lin Xiu spoke, he subconsciously checked his attributes in his mind:

Level: 51

Experience points: 385.6476 billion/5000000000000

Strength: 2846

Physique: 3200

Speed: 1024

Skills: ‘Analytic Eye’ ‘Fury’ ‘Disguise’ ‘Devour’ ‘Mirror’s Image’ ‘Heavenly Array’ ‘Reset’ ‘Power of the Stars’ ‘Golden Body Immortality’ ‘Exotic Summoning’

Rage build-up: 0/100

Potential Points: 0

Title: Master Warrior (Unused titles: Rank 1 warrior, Rank 2 warrior, Rank 3 warrior, Rank 4 warrior, Rank 5 warrior, Rank 6 warrior, Rank 7 warrior, Rank 8 warrior, Rank 9 warrior)

Attributes!

Attribute growth is too terrifying! Simply outrageous.

The physique attribute actually reached 3200!

He increased in strength every time he level up, but he didn’t expect that after this time, his physique attribute increased so much all of a sudden.

Oh right…

At this time, Lin Xiu seemed to think of the previous scene. His body exploded and felt like it was reconstructed later.

A great realm of ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ – reconstructing the body!

Unexpectedly, he was invisible and just met this condition.

That kind of light blue liquid has such terrifying energy and it seemed that he had completely absorbed it.

And looking at the experience progress bar, he already has more than 50% progress.

Although the level hasn’t improved yet, Lin Xiu’s current attributes are really too powerful.

And with the support of the system skills, the current Lin Xiu is definitely the strongest existence in the same rank!

“Master?”

“Yeah?”

Lin Xiu came back to his senses when he heard An Qi’s words.

Exited from the system interface in his mind.

“Brother Lin, did you get any treasures?”

Without waiting for An Qi and Qian Lin to speak, Liu Pan said with great excitement.

The treasure house of the Raging Flame Lion was said to have a lot of treasures.

Unexpectedly, Lin Xiu actually broke in.

“Yes, there are many Odd crystals, piled up into mountains.”

“All of them are above the eighth rank and it seems that there are quite a few of the tenth rank.”

“Fuck!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Liu Pan finally couldn’t bear it any longer and was about to rush over there.

But at this time, Lin Xiu directly grabbed him.

“You go now and you will die.”

Lin Xiu said helplessly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, he turned his eyes to the front and he could clearly see the Raging Flame Lion at the entrance of the cave, frantically attacking the surrounding warriors.

Some warriors who wanted to break into the cave were slapped to death.

Those are master warrior-level warriors!

“Damn...”

Seeing this scene, Liu Pan’s eyes widened and there was a trace of fear.

In the current situation, even if there are king-level Odd crystals in it, he can’t get in.

“But I brought you guys a few.”

Lin Xiu smiled, then threw the three rank 10 Odd crystals he had just obtained by killing the Dark Stone Beasts to them.

“Rank 10 Odd crystal?!”

Both An Qi and Qian Lin exclaimed in surprise.

“I killed this beast just now. It is still very fresh.”

Lin Xiu said with a smile.

“So you are here!”

At this moment, a voice came.

Hearing this voice, Lin Xiu’s brows couldn’t help but wrinkle. He looked behind him and saw Qian Qiurong, walking toward Lin Xiu with the long sword in his hand.

Because he had just fought with the Raging Flame Lion, there were still a lot of stains on his clothes at this time and he looked like he was in a bad state.

“President Qian?”

Liu Pan looked a little curious as Qian Qiurong came over.

An Qi and Qian Lin were also taken aback, Qian Qiurong, why did they come here?

“Brother Lin, do you know President Qian?”

Liu Pan said curiously at this time.

“I don’t know, but he probably wants something from me.”

“What does he want?”

“He wants my life.”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the expressions of Liu Pan, An Qi and Qian Lin changed.

At this moment, they all clenched the weapons in their hands subconsciously.

“Amethyst Divine Water, you drank all of it?”

Qian Qiurong said aloud at this time.

Amethyst divine water?

Lin Xiu was startled and seemed to think of the light blue liquid just now.

Those should be the so-called Amethyst Divine Water.

And Lin Xiu didn’t know why so much blue liquid had disappeared when he woke up.

“You can look for it again and see if there is any more.”
