Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Damn it!

Lin Xiu used his source strength to control the essence of fire that he poured out and imprinted it on the Dark Edge spear, which was very mentally draining.

And this essence of fire was really too hot and now Lin Xiu’s fingers were burnt to the point that it was a little bloody.

At this time, Lin Xiu still had to grit his teeth and complete this final step.

Lin Xiu wasn’t sure how much time has passed, but in the next moment, he could clearly see the body of this Dark Edge spear had a lot of fiery red tattoos.

These patterns, like burning flames, were lifelike.

“Huhuhu…”

And Lin Xiu was lying on the ground at this time, panting.

The sharp pain in the hand began to slowly disappear at this time.

After all, Lin Xiu’s recovery ability was very powerful.

Looking at the Dark Edge spear standing on the ground, Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up slightly.

It seems…successful?

These fire essences allowed Lin Xiu to inscribe five source marks on the Dark Edge spear.

......

These source marks are all ancient source marks left over from the ruins over there.

These source marks of the five attributes were ‘Strength’, ‘Speed’, ‘Flame’, ‘Defense’ and ‘Frost’.

He had seen and remembered all these in the ancient ruins.

He just didn’t know if it will work if they were engraved on this Dark Edge spear.

“Master!”

At this moment, Wang Qiang’s voice came from the front.

“Wang Qiang, what’s wrong?”

Looking at Wang Qiang running over, Lin Xiu said.

“Master, aren’t we going to participate in the Tianjiao competition, it has already started today!”

Wang Qiang said.

“Oh? So it’s today.”

Lin Xiu only remembered now.

Standing up, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he hurried in another direction.

The city where Lin Xiu lives now was called Tianjiao City. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

It was a very big city.

Now they were in a small town on the outskirts of Tianjiao City.

But it didn’t take much time to go to Tianjiao City.

There was a teleportation array and one has to pay for it.

This was really much easier than on earth.

“so many people…”

When the two of them were teleported to Tianjiao City, there was already a sea of ??people around.

“Master, the registration office is right in front!”

Wang Qiang clenched the spear in his hand a little excitedly and said.

In the past month, in order to get the mastering points, Lin Xiu trained Wang Qiang to death.

But poor Wang Qiang thought that Lin Xiu practiced very hard for him to grow up.

His strength has now reached the peak of the King warrior.

And his spear art was also very superb.

It was close to Lin Xiu’s demeanor in the past.

“Get out of the way, you bastards, why are you signing up, be careful you might die up there.”

At this moment, a group of men walked over from the other side and directly pushed Wang Qiang away.

“What are you doing!”

Wang Qiang, who was pushed away, suddenly said angrily.

In the blink of an eye, he saw several tall and strong men standing in front of him.

“Yo? Isn’t this Wang Qiang?”

A young man headed by looked at Wang Qiang and said in surprise.

“Song Zhen?”

Looking at the man in front of him, Wang Qiang’s face became ugly.

This man, before his family was bankrupted by the An family, used to curry favor with him and was his friend.

It’s just that with the bankruptcy of the Wang family, the faces of these so-called ‘friends’ changed suddenly.

Not only did they not help them get through the difficult times, but instead kicked them when they were down.

“I didn’t expect that you, you bastard, would dare to sign up for the Tianjiao competition.”

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

Wang Qiang glared angrily, clenched his hands tightly and made a cracking sound.

“What, you want to hit me?”

Song Zhen approached Wang Qiang, stared at Wang Qiang and said.

“I tell you, your ex-girlfriend tastes pretty good…”

“what!!!”

Hearing Song Zhen’s words, Wang Qiang suddenly became furious.

With a fist, he was about to hit Song Zhen.

“Courting death!”

Looking at Wang Qiang’s actions, Song Zhen roared and the strength of his body completely exploded at this moment.

Several warriors around also attacked Wang Qiang at the same time.

“Do not move.”

Just when they were about to beat Wang Qiang violently, a voice suddenly reached their ears.

Hearing this voice, Song Zhen and the others immediately felt the power that erupted from their bodies and disappeared!

It seems that the power within the body has been suppressed by a more terrifying power!

Boom—

The next moment, Wang Qiang’s fist smashed directly into Song Zhen’s cheek!

Song Zhen immediately flew out.

He fell on the ground, his mouth was full of blood and all his teeth fell.

The few warriors who were with him just now trembled.

They had no idea that things would suddenly turn out like this.

“Jumping the queue is a bad habit.”

Lin Xiu’s figure appeared in front of Wang Qiang at this time.

Looking at these frightened people, he said lightly.

“Yes… yes… we were wrong.”

These people looked at Lin Xiu. Although they didn’t feel the terrifying power coming from Lin Xiu’s body, their bodies trembled.

Lin Xiu, gave them a very strange feeling.

“get lost.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Sure, sure!”

At this time, these people rushed to Song Zhen’s side and hurriedly took Song Zhen away.

“Master, it’s me who embarrassed you.”

Wang Qiang said apologetically at this time.

At that moment, it was obvious that Lin Xiu had used his power.

Otherwise, it might be him lying on the ground.

“It’s okay, let’s sign up.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

He glanced at the surroundings and those warriors who looked at Lin Xiu quickly retracted their gazes.

This time the competition was a doubles match, there was no single match.

The two quickly signed up.

“1,300, so many people signed up this year.”

Looking at his number, Wang Qiang couldn’t help but say.

“Only a hundred warriors can enter the Sage warrior Space, so our goal is to be in the top fifty.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“First place, what’s the reward?”

“First place…”

Wang Qiang was startled when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

“I’m not too sure, but it seems that the first place, in addition to the reward, you can spend time with one of the strongest Sage warriors in the world, Fengyue Sage warrior.

“One of the strongest Sage warriors in the world?”

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

He actually wanted to see what the strongest Sage warrior on the planet Namir was like.

“The registration is over! The competition will start in one hour!”
