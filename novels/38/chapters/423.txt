Chapter 424: Absorbing the Energy

“Electricity?” Ouyang Hang was stunned as if he didn’t understand what he had just heard.

“Just do according to what I instructed you to.” Lin Xiu immediately ordered him.

Ouyang Hang noticed that Lin Xiu was being serious and gritted his teeth as he said, “Damn it! I’ll definitely say that it was you if I get caught!”

After scolding Lin Xiu, Ouyang Hang ran in the other direction.

Lin Xiu looked at the pipes that were below him as he started a countdown, “One… Two… Three…”

Honglong – –

When Lin Xi counted to three, there was a loud explosion that happened on the other side!

The entire ground was shaking violently at that moment.

Honglong Honglong – –

But it wasn’t over, there was another fire that started on the opposite side of the explosion.

“Shit! I am doomed if I get caught!” After completing the task that he was given, Ouyang Hang quickly ran away from the scene.

With commotion happening in two different directions, Lin Xiu took a deep breath.

From his assumption, he only had about ten minutes.

As he thought of it, the look that Lin Xiu had in his eyes changed as he stared at the terrifying current that was running in the tubes below him.

Just do it!

He gritted his teeth as he raised his fist and gave a hard punch onto the transparent tubes below him.

Honglong – –

With a loud sound, the entire tube was destroyed within a blink of an eye.

At the same time, there was a huge amount of electricity that instantly covered Lin Xiu’s body.

“Sh*t…”

As Lin Xiu tried to swear, he realized that he could no longer talk.

This current here was much scarier than the ones caused by the Thunderbirds up in the mountain peaks!

Lin Xiu could feel that he could no longer open his mouth because of the current, and the skin all over his body was slowly turning black as if they were roasted.

“Engulf”

All of a sudden, there was a cold, hoarse robotic voice that rang inside Lin Xiu’s mind.

Lin Xiu’s mind now was completely black.

When he wasn’t aware, the EXP bar on the system was turning like crazy!

This was the reason why Lin Xiu wanted to come here.

With the help of the large current from the power station of the Sacred Region Academy, he would be able to absorb the current’s energy in exchange for an increase in his EXP!

This was because Lin Xiu noticed that ‘Engulf’ was the most suitable when it comes to absorbing the energy from the current. It was more troublesome for him to engulf energies like ice and fire. Plus, there wouldn’t be such a huge fire available for Lin Xiu to use.

“Congratulations Master. ‘Engulf’ has been upgraded!”

There were a lot of other notifications that were in his mind but at that moment, it was impossible for Lin Xiu to feel anything.

Lin Xiu’s mind was now frozen as it has been in that state since before.

“What’s happening? Who’s the one who dares mess with the Sacred Region Academy?!” One of the middle-aged men from the power state saw the huge fire from the security cameras in his control room as well as the huge crater that was created on the ground because of the explosion, he was raging mad.

“We have already arranged them to help with putting out the fire. As for what started the fire, it is still under investigation.” One of the staff next to him answered him respectfully.

“Damn it! Has someone sneaked into our academy?” The middle-aged man punched the table hard as he screamed.

Although there wasn’t much damage done, they still had no idea why this person wanted to destroy the surroundings of the power station.

“I’ll get someone to check on what is happening.” The same man that answered earlier, told his boss and quickly walked towards the exit.

“HMPH!”

The middle-aged man was then left alone in the control room of the power station.

Since everything was automated, there was nothing much that the other operators had to do.

“Uuuuu Huuu Huuuu.”

Suddenly, there was a loud piercing sound that surrounded the area and there were multiple bright, red lights that were blinking.

What is going on?!

The middle-aged man that was previously made turned completely shocked upon hearing the siren.

He quickly walked towards the controls and noticed something peculiar.

“The main power source has been destroyed?!

Plus, it looked as if all the current were connected to something else and was being absorbed by it!

“What… Why is there a power shortage?!”

“F*ck! What on earth is happening?!”

At the same time, the entire Sacred Region Academy turned pitch black. There were only a few emergency lights that lit up.

With the sudden power shortage, everyone in the Sacred Region Academy started buzzing.

Since in this world where everything was developed, it was impossible for such a power shortage to happen.

Luo Yue was standing by the courtyard with the moonlight shining on her face. Her brows were knotted together and she could feel that something wasn’t right.

“Damn it!” The middle-aged man who was in the control room wanted to see what was happening with the help of the security cameras but he wasn’t able to do so.

It wasn’t because they were destroyed. The cameras were covered by a black thing.

He wanted to send someone there but he realized that all the operators in the control room had gone to help with the fire.

Boom – –

He punched the table once again and was typing on the keyboard on his table. Then, without any further hesitation, he walked out of the control room.

He wanted to see for himself who was the one who had the balls to mess with the Sacred Region Academy.

As for Lin Xiu, his body was still completely covered by the horrifying current that was coming from the tubes.

All of the clothes that he had on were completely burnt and they had already turned into ashes, falling all over the ground.

There was only a thin combat suit left that hadn’t turned black.

“Ding!!!”

“Congratulations Master for making it to level 30!”

“Congratulations Master for being a rank 6 warrior!”

“Congratulations Master, you’ve leveled up. You get one chance from the lucky draw!”

“Congratulations Master…”

The mast amount of notifications were ringing nonstop in his head. Lin Xiu, whose mind was completely blank previously, finally came back to his senses.

“I’ve leveled up?!”

Lin Xiu finally heard the notifications that were ringing in his head and was surprised.

He could also clearly feel a strong, powerful energy all around his body.

“F*ck…. It hurts…”

Lin Xiu initially wanted to move his body but noticed that his body had been completely toasted.

Every inch of his skin looked burnt.Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com
