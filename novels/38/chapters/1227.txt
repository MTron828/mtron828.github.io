1228 Strange Dark Energy

“You are quite confident.”

When Lin Xiu heard his words, his eyes narrowed slightly.

Under the Analytic eyes, Lin Xiu was able to clearly find out information about Sha Qiang and Sha Li.

Their attributes were also very strong. Compared with Lin Xiu, they were not bad at all.

It seems that they were not ordinary warriors and had some strength.

However, it is interesting to fight in this way.

“Ha ha.”

Seeing Lin Xiu being so “arrogant”, Sha Li revealed a sneer.

In the next moment, with the movement of Sha Li’s right hand, a black energy body gathered.

It formed a huge black claw and charged towards Lin Xiu!

swoosh—

Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared instantly.

He hit the air.

“behind!”

Sha Li seemed to sense Lin Xiu’s position, turned around suddenly, then swung his claws in the air to grab it.

The huge black claw that appeared in front of Sha Li also grabbed it as he waved his claw.

boom–

With a dull sound, you could see Lin Xiu holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, blocking the attack of this huge black claw.

“Go to hell!!!”

Sha Li’s face was hideous and he waved his left hand. At this moment, another black claw appeared behind Lin Xiu and grabbed it directly towards Lin Xiu’s body!

Lin Xiu’s body was torn in half at this moment! ! !

“fake!”

Seeing this scene, Sha Qiang clearly felt something and immediately said.

“Shut up, this is my prey!”

Sha Li said coldly.

He also clearly felt that Lin Xiu just now was fake and he was still looking for Lin Xiu.

swoosh—

But at this moment, he saw two cold beams flash past in front of him!

The pupils in Sha Li’s eyes shrank slightly, clearly sensing the danger and his body subconsciously retreated to the back.

But even so, he could still feel a slight tingling sensation on his cheek.

Subconsciously, he touched it with his hand and he could clearly see that there were traces of blood on his hand.

He was actually… injured! ! !

And at this moment, out of the corner of his eyes, he saw a cold light continue to charge towards him.

“Go away!”

He shouted angrily and a large amount of black energy material appeared in his body in an instant.

These black energy warriors seemed to form a barrier, completely covering his body.

“Damn!”

At this moment, Baili Haoling’s figure appeared in front of him.

She was holding a pair of swords in both hands and there were obvious scars on her hands.

These scars were the anti-shock injuries that she received when she waved her two swords and attacked the dark matter he released.

Baili Haoling retreated to the back, staring at the strange black energy and did not attack again.

“Why are you here?”

And Lin Xiu’s figure also appeared beside her at this moment.

“Here to have some fun.”

Baili Haoling was holding a pair of swords and her red eyes were full of excitement.

Lin Xiu was a little ashamed when he saw this scene.

“This guy is not easy to deal with.”

Baili Haoling said.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly, especially the energies released by this Sha Li, obviously the energy of the dark attribute.

very strange.

“Are you here to help?”

Lin Xiu, who was surrounded by black energy substances, looked at Baili Haoling over there and said with a sneer.

As for Baili Haoling appearing, he did not feel any fear, but seemed to be even more excited.

He kept licking his lips.

At this moment, Sha Qiang frowned. Lin Xiu’s strength was a bit unfathomable just now and the strength of the girl who appeared now seems to be quite strong.

How could so many powerful warriors suddenly appear in this Lingxian city!?

And when he raised his eyes and looked forward, he saw a huge sphere-like creature with its mouth wide open and sucked all the corpses into his mouth!

Even the blood on the ground was sucked up!

When Sha Qiang was in shock, Xiao Bai flew above their heads as well. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

As it flapped its wings, a large number of ice picks appeared in an instant, stabbing directly from the sky!

The number of ice picks is dense and the coverage is very wide.

At this time, Sha Qiang couldn’t dodge either, so he used his ‘Sphere’ directly.

As his ‘Sphere’ unfolded, all those ice picks were blocked in an instant.

bang bang bang-

At this time, the surrounding ground was constantly shaking due to the impact of those ice picks.

And since Sha Li had those black energy substances surrounding his body, he was not affected at all.

“You deal with that girl.”

“That man is my prey.”

Sha Li still stared at Lin Xiu.

Although Baili Haoling scratched his face just now, he still wanted to kill Lin Xiuxian.

“En.”

Sha Qiang looked at Baili Haoling.

Baili Haoling’s current state of red eyes makes him feel very strange.

He has been in the God warrior Realm for so long and he has never seen such a person with red eyes.

“Can you handle it?”

At this time, Lin Xiu spoke indifferently to Baili Haoling beside him.

“certainly.”

Baili Haoling held the two swords and was already in a fighting stance.

“Very good, let’s go.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly and when he moved, he rushed out!

Sha Li watched Lin Xiu move and he instantly disappeared in place.

swoosh—

The figures of the two appeared directly in the air in the next instant.

bang bang bang-

Sha Li’s main weapon was the spiked gloves on both hands.

At this time, he frantically threw his fists and attacked Lin Xiu’s body.

But Lin Xiu kept pulling away from him and stabbed him with his spear.

As long as Sha Li was not allowed to get close, he could not do anything to Lin Xiu.

swoosh—

The spear stabbed out again. This time, Sha Li was not able to block Lin Xiu’s attack with his fists.

The sharp point of the spear pierced directly on the black substance surrounding his body.

Different from what Lin Xiu imagined, the Dark Edge spear did not penetrate the black energy substances but penetrated Sha Li’s body at this time!

how can that be!?

Lin Xiu felt this situation and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

And as Lin Xiu tried to pull it out, he found these black energy substances had sucked his Dark Edge spear tightly.

There was absolutely no way to get it out!

“hehe”

Sha Li showed a strange smile and the fist in his right hand slammed directly at Lin Xiu’s head!

boom–

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly and with a movement of his left hand, he slammed his fist toward Sha Li as well!
