1385 Eight Exits

The gates were finally opened!

Lin Xiu got on his feet.

He wasn’t the only one. The rest of the warriors noticed what had happened and stared at the gates that were slowly opening.

“It’s now open.”

Zhang Xiuxian muttered under his breath.

“Should we go in now?”

Lin Xiu turned toward Zhang Xiuxian and asked in a low voice.

Since this man has been here before, he must know a thing or two about the situation behind those doors.

Lin Xiu could clearly feel that this place is different from the rest.

There may be danger behind those gates.

If they rush in now, it may be a bad decision.

“No. Just let them head inside first. We can follow behind them.”

Zhang Xiuxian smiled a little as if he was reminded of something.

Lin Xiu remained at the same spot as told.

Even if there were priceless treasures inside Tianmen City, they wouldn’t appear so quickly.

Therefore, it does not matter who got in earlier.

Soon, the Tianmen City was completely opened and there were lots of warriors that rushed into the room.

The rest of the warriors slowly walked through the gates as well.

“Let’s go.”

Seeing how the majority had already entered the city, Zhang Xiuxian finally decided that it was their time to enter.

As they walked through the gates, everything around them changed instantly.

From the outside, there was a bright white glow that came from inside the city. It was as if it was daylight.

However, as soon as they entered, Lin Xiu noticed that they were walking inside a dark, long, endless tunnel.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Suddenly, there were two sharp, ear piercing sounds heard. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

It sounded like there were random things being released from the walls!

“AHHHHHH!”

There were painful cries that followed.

As they were inside a tunnel, the cry echoed inside and it caused their scalps to turn numb.

The warriors, who wanted to run through the tunnel quickly, started slowly down.

“There are lots of traps in here and it seems like they have been placed differently from the last time.”

Zhang Xiuxian informed Lin Xiu about what was happening.

“Interesting.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

Plus, he noticed that his body felt different because of the rules implied here.

They have been suppressed.

“Are you scared?”

Zhang Xiuxian looked at Lin Xiu and there was a weird looking smile on his face.

“Of course not.”

Dangerous places bring challenges.

They ignored those who stopped and continued walking forward.

Zhang Xiuxian walked next to Lin Xiu.

Soon, as they continued their journey inside the tunnel, they could clearly see that there were lots of other warriors who stopped in their tracks.

Most of them seemed to be thinking hard about something.

When Lin Xiu got to the front, he noticed that there were bodies of warrior gods lying all over the ground.

All of their bodies have been pierced by arrows made of a unique type of metal.

Their eyes were also opened wide as if they’ve seen something frightening.

“The arrows got through those who were warrior gods?”

Some of the warriors trembled when they saw the scene.

These were no ordinary warriors, they were all warrior gods!

Some of them were even at their peaks!

“Their source energy has been suppressed and the ‘sphere’ that they could release is too weak. They wouldn’t have been able to stop the arrows.”

One of the warrior gods shook his head.

“Damn it! Are we the only ones who are facing these things?!”

...

Another warrior spoke as he clenched his teeth.

With such things happening, who else who still dares to continue walking in the tunnel?!

Plus, they knew that they were not stronger than those who have died here.

If these warriors were killed, they would definitely be killed as well if they continued walking!

“Shall we?” Zhang Xiuxian looked at Lin Xiu.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

Both of them then turned around and left.

The rest of the warriors had their eyes fixed on Lin Xiu and Zhang Xiuxian.

They wanted to see if these two would also be dead like the other warriors gods.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

...

It was only a second where there were other ear piercing sounds that appeared in the air.

Lin Xiu quickly dodged them with his reflexes.

The arrows made of a special type of metal missed Lin Xiu entirely.

None of them had hit Lin Xiu.

“He has such quick reflexes…”

After seeing what had happened, the rest of the warriors were stunned.

Lin Xiu was moving around like mad in order to dodge the arrows but he was still looking at the man who came along with him. Zhang Xiuxian was also dodging the arrows effortlessly.

This man does have some tricks up his sleeves.

The arrows were only being shot from one part of the tunnel.

Once they got through the part, there were no arrows shot from the walls.

“You’re pretty good.”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was unharmed, Zhang Xiuxian looked excited.

“You’re not too bad yourself”

Lin Xiu answered with a smile.

“Well, I’m still not as good as you.”

Zhang Xiuxian shook his head.

That’s when they saw that there was a scratch on his shoulder and there was blood seeping through.

This was from the arrows earlier.

“This place….is different from the last time that you were here?”

Lin Xiu continued walking as he asked.

It felt like this was an endless tunnel.

“Well, it does look different from twenty years ago.”

“But, it should be the same once we get inside.”

Zhang Xiuxian continued.

“So….the thing that you want is inside?”

Lin Xiu asked calmly.

Zhang Xiuxian only decided to join him because he needed Lin Xiu’s help with getting what he wanted.

“En. Don’t worry. As long as you help me get what I want, I’ll give half of it to you.”

Zhang Xiuxian spoke in a firm tone.

At the same time, the warriors who had been hesitant earlier, started moving forward as well.

Most of them were still talented warriors and most were able to dodge the arrows with their own skills.

Most of them were able to get past it.

“Look! There’s something in front.”

Zhang Xiuxian suddenly spoke up.

Soon, they seemed to have arrived at the end of the tunnel.

There was a bright white glow that slowly appeared from around them.

Could that be the exit?

When they got close, they noticed that there were…eight exits!

“Huh?”

Zhang Xiuxian was confused when he saw the exits.

“Why are there eight of them?”

He mumbled under his breath.
