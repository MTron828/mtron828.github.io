Chapter 425: Finally Rank 6!

Without looking at the mirror, he already knew that his face was now completely black in color.

The current was extremely scary. It was much more horrifying than all of those that he had touched before this.

Plus, Lin Xiu also realized that there was a brief period of time where he had lost consciousness as if he was dead.

As he thought about it, Lin Xiu felt his heart racing.

“The current is getting smaller.” Lin Xiu looked around and saw that the currents that were traveling through the tubes were slowly becoming smaller.

It seemed to be getting weaker.

It had already been quite a while and it would be better for him to quickly leave. Otherwise, he would be in a lot of trouble if he got caught.

Lini Xiu quickly moved his body, leaped, and went back to the ground above.

“Ouch! It really hurts…”

When Lin Xiu moved, he could feel the pain from his skin that was tearing apart from all over his body.

It felt good at the same time which was why Lin Xiu didn’t know how to describe it as well.

“Who are you?”

As soon as Lin Xiu got onto the surface, there was a middle-aged man who was wearing the working uniform belonging to the Sacred Region Academy staring at him in rage.

“You’re the one who destroyed the main tube?!” Before Lin Xiu could say a word, the middle-aged man continued asking.

He took a good look at Lin Xiu. Lin Xiu was now completely burnt. He was black in color from head to toe and all the hair on his head and even his eyebrows were gone as they had been electrocuted. Lin Xiu looked extremely peculiar.

The middle-aged man was definitely surprised. It was obvious that Lin Xiu was the one who destroyed the main circuit and got electrocuted badly by the strong current.

However, he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu was still alive and could still jump out of that place.

Lin Xiu did not say a single thing and said running in the opposite direction!

“Hey! You stay right there!” Seeing how Lin Xiu was running away, the middle-aged man was caught off guard and quickly chased after him.

Lin Xiu continued running like a mad dog, refusing to turn his head even once.

The middle-aged man suddenly leaped and it was as if his entire body got thrown into the air. Then, within a second, his right hand grabbed onto Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

“I told you to stay put!” As soon as he got his hands on Lin Xiu, he sneered and warned Lin Xiu.

But, Lin Xiu didn’t say a single thing as well. His body suddenly froze like a puppet and wasn’t reacting to being touched or moved by the other party.

“Are you dead?” The middle-aged man was stunned as he asked.

However, he soon realized that the ‘Lin Xiu’ that he caught had suddenly disappeared!

His eyes widened in surprise as he was dumbfounded.

“He’s… gone?”

He looked into the distance and everywhere around him was pitch black. It was impossible for him to see where Lin Xiu went.

“Guess it isn’t a bad thing looking like this.” Lin Xiu looked at the scene opposite him. He saw the staff that was going around looking for him and Lin Xiu could still easily hide from them.

All this was only possible because Lin Xiu was ‘black’. His combat suit was black as well and it was impossible for them to find Lin Xiu here.

As he followed the same road from where he came from, Lin Xiu let out a breath of relief when he finally found the way home.

Within 5 minutes, Lin Xiu was finally back at the mansion.

However, as soon as he walked into the mansion, Lin Xiu could feel a sharp murderous look headed in his direction.

Before he could react, he saw a sharp, bright light that flashed before his eyes.

Xiu – –

It was a sword and was placed upon Lin Xiu’s neck.

“It’s me!” Lin Xiu quickly screamed out loud.

When Luo Yue heard Lin Xiu’s voice, she quickly put down the sword and looked at Lin Xiu. Her eyes uncontrollably widened in shock.

This was because Lin Xiu’s looked incredibly peculiar in this state.

He looked as if he had been roasted by lightning.

Bupu——-

Luo Yue wanted to laugh out loud when she took a good look at Lin Xiu’s condition.

But soon, she was able to control herself and stopped herself from laughing.

“What’s so funny?!” Lin Xiu glared at her while questioning her.

“How did you turn out this way?” Luo Yue continued staring at Lin Xiu as she asked in shock.

“I don’t want to talk about it.” Lin Xiu answered helplessly.

Lin Xiu was in a lot of pain whenever he moved as his skin started tearing apart.

“Do you want to go to the treatment room?” Luo Yue also noticed that Lin Xiu was in a lot of pain. After thinking about it, she carefully asked Lin Xiu.

“No!”

Lin Xiu quickly shook his head after hearing her question. Nonsense! If he went to the treatment room now, the staff of the Sacred Region Academy would learn about this and he would be in a lot of trouble!

He was 100% sure that he would get caught!

Luo Yue stayed silent for a brief period of time before telling him, “I have the recovery fluid. You can soak your body in it.”

“Thank you.” Lin Xiu nodded his head in appreciation.

Then, he quickly walked into the house and headed straight for the bathroom.

Luo Yue has already placed the special fluid inside the tub.

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate at all. He quickly removed his combat suit and went into the tub that was now filled with the blur, recovery fluid.

As soon as his body was inside the tub, he could feel a cold feeling all over his body.

It was extremely comfortable!

He no longer felt the stabbing pain from his body that had been there earlier.

Lin Xiu slowly closed his eyes.

With a small change of thought, he entered into the system.

Level 30! He finally got to level 30!

Lin Xiu got excited.

As soon as he got to level 30, he would be able to cultivate even more skills.

He could finally use the diamond-grade warrior skills and the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’.

‘Awe of the Phoenix’ was a variable warrior skill card and should now be of the diamond grade which meant that he would have to further cultivate it.

As time passed, Lin Xiu could slowly feel an itchy feeling on his skin all over his body.

It felt as if he was growing a new layer of flesh.

In about half an hour, Lin Xiu noticed that all the prickling pain on the skin of his body had slowly disappeared and it was replaced by a comfortable feeling.

Lin Xiu opened his eyes and took a good look at his surroundings. He felt as if he could now see the tiny particles in the air. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Refreshed! He felt refreshed!
