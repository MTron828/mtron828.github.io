Chapter 1125: The Huge ‘Sphere’

Dang–

The next moment, he was holding the sword that resisted Lin Xiu’s spear attack and was directly sent flying by Lin Xiu!

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t stop his movements at all.

!!

Used his skill directly.

bang bang bang-

Although this Sage warrior had already unfolded a ‘Sphere’, as Lin Xiu’s skill was used, thousands of cold lights flashed instantly, impacting his ‘Sphere’.

This indestructible ‘Sphere’ has a lot of cracks!

“Courting death!”

Just when Lin Xiu was about to go all out, destroy his ‘Sphere’ and kill him directly, the Sage warrior from behind also rushed over.

Using powerful skills, he attacked Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu snorted coldly when he saw this scene.

At this moment, with a thought, the ‘Sphere’ unfolded instantly.

All those skill powers hit Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” but were completely blocked by Lin Xiu’s “Sphere”.

There was no damage at all.

The Sage warrior, who was about to be smashed by Lin Xiu just now, fled to the back.

At this moment, he was out of breath and when he thought of the scene just now, his body trembled slightly.

Terrifying, it’s really too terrifying.

Just a little bit more and his ‘Sphere’ would be broken by Lin Xiu.

“‘Four lightning flashes’!!!”

“‘Sky Fire Meteor’!!!”

“…”

Source marks appeared on the foreheads of these Sage warriors.

Their colleagues used the source mark power to charge at Lin Xiu.

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he didn’t dodge at all.

These source mark powers they use were all source mark forces formed by attribute energy.

Lin Xiu’s resistance to this is very strong.

These seemingly terrifying source mark powers did not cause any damage to Lin Xiu at all! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

When they looked at the scene in front of them, their faces became extremely ugly.

They never thought that Lin Xiu’s defense would be so strong.

“Notify the master!”

One of the Sage warriors shouted loudly to the Sage warrior beside him at this time.

They already felt great pressure from Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was not an ordinary Sage warrior-level warrior.

The two Sage warriors heard his words and wanted to leave at this time.

Holding the weapons in their hands, they attacked the matrix.

bang bang bang-

With a loud noise, the matrix remained motionless.

There was absolutely no way to break it!

Damn it!

When the two warriors discovered this situation, their expressions changed drastically.

This matrix is ??really weird, no matter how they attack, they can’t break it.

Now they were stuck here.

Unless they killed Lin Xiu, they could only stay here.

At the same time, Lin Xiu, whose whole body was exuding white light, continued to wave the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

boom boom boom —

Dozens or hundreds of flaming birds swept through this space continuously.

Although these Sage warriors have developed a ‘Sphere’, they do not dare to directly resist the impact of those flaming birds.

And in this space, because of the appearance of a large number of flaming birds, it became extremely hot.

It’s like being in a big furnace.

Those Sage warriors were drenched in sweat at this time.

At this time, the Sage warrior, who had just been attacked by Lin Xiu and his ‘Sphere’ had a large number of cracks, was directly hit by one of the flaming birds!

boom–

With a dull sound, the cracked ‘Sphere’ was directly burned and melted by this terrifying flame!

As soon as the ‘Sphere’ melted away, those terrifying flames directly covered his body.

His body burned wildly.

“what!!!”

The sage warrior let out a heart-wrenching roar, rolling frantically on the ground.

The Sage warrior in front of him saw this scene and used his source mark power. A large amount of water appeared, charging toward the Sage warrior.

Whoosh-

Although the water put out the flames, a large amount of white smoke came out at this time and the skin of the Sage warrior was completely scorched.

In the next moment, with the wave of the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand, an arc-shaped white light burst out directly and charged toward the Sage warrior’s body.

boom–

He was unable to move and at this moment, his body was directly split into two halves by the impact!

Dead!

When the surrounding Sage warriors saw this scene, their eyes widened.

They did not expect that in this short period of time, a Sage warrior would be killed by Lin Xiu.

And at this time, Lin Xiu didn’t stop his movements.

With Lin Xiu’s thoughts, at this moment, a large amount of black energy bloomed from Lin Xiu’s body.

clap clap-

With the appearance of these dark energies, they instantly swept around like a tide!

what is this!?

When the remaining seven Sage warriors saw the scene in front of them, their pupils shrank.

They subconsciously wanted to dodge, but the black energies continued to sweep toward them.

They slowly began to cover the space surrounded by the entire matrix.

“‘Silence’!?”

One of the Sage warriors seemed to sense something and his face changed greatly.

“You mean the one from the Ye family…”

At this moment, the rest of the people’s eyes widened.

This was one of the three holy-level skill of the Ye family back then, why did the person in front of him know this skill!?

Could it be that…

“You are from the Ye family!?”

One of the Sage warriors, stared at Lin Xiu and shouted loudly.

But Lin Xiu ignored his words and continued to use this dark energy.

“Come here quickly!”

At this time, a Sage warrior clearly sensed the horror of these dark energies and shouted loudly at the other Sage warriors at this time.

In the next moment, these Sage warriors all gathered.

At this moment, their strengths are all coming together.

The gathered forces formed a huge and thick ‘Sphere’ in the next moment.

This ‘Sphere’ seems to be different from the general ‘Sphere’.

With the impact of those dark energies, this ‘Sphere’ blocked all those dark energies.

There is absolutely no way for these dark energies to come in.

“Hm?”

Lin Xiu saw this scene with surprise.

Unexpectedly, these people can gather all their own strength, then jointly launch this kind of “Sphere” with such a strong defense.

This ‘Sphere’ even blocked the power of ‘Silence’.

“interesting.”

At this time, while Lin Xiu said to himself, the Dark Edge spear in his hand continued to wave and those flaming birds flying in the air quickly gathered together.

A huge flaming phoenix formed and charged towards them!
