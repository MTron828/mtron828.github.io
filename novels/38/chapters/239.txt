Chapter 240: A Sky Full Of Flames

The spear moved so fast and when Yu Yi grabbed it, it caused smoke to emit out from his hands,

His hands started to bleed from the friction.

“Who would have thought that you have such capabilities!” Yu Yi held onto Lin Xiu’s spear tightly and stared at him.

He had underestimated Lin Xiu and initially thought he could kill Lin Xiu with ease.

Who would have thought that Lin Xiu had such a miraculous skill capable of duplicating his body and confusing him between the real and the fake!

His weapon had fallen to the ground and his strength had been cut by a large margin.

“You lost.” Lin Xiu looked at him and replied indifferently.

With that said, he exerted force with both legs. Right at this time, Dark Edge continued to inch forward.

But Yu Yi’s hands were strong enough as he tightened his grip and prevented his body from moving.

Because if he took another step back, he would fall off the arena.

He would lose once he falls!

He already lost the last time, he could not afford to lose again!

And he was a rank 6 warrior while Lin Xiu was only rank 5. If he lost again, it meant that he no longer had the face to stay in Sacred Region Academy.

His deeds would make him a laughingstock and a joke for people to discuss over meal times.

And he had to accomplish what Ouyang Hang had tasked him with.

Upon thinking about this, his eyes flashed with a hint of ferocity.

“Arghhh!!!” Yu Yi roared out loud and the muscles on his body started to expand.

The immense power from his body burst out and even surged against Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide as his pupils constricted.

‘How can he suddenly unleash so much power!?’

Yu Yi held onto the speartip and started to exert force and pushed Lin Xiu backwards!

“What power, as expected from a rank 6 warrior!?” Zhang Yin thought that Lin Xiu had won and did not expect Yu Yi to unleash such power under the circumstances and even pushed Lin Xiu backwards!

Very quickly, Lin Xiu was pushed to the center of the arena!

“This is the Mountain Seizing Power skill!!!” A learned student’s eyes lit up and announced when he saw that.

“What is the Mountain Seizing Power? I have never heard of it before?” Another student asked curiously.

The battle was too thought-provoking, every time one party was about to win, a reversal would occur.

Now no one knew who would win!

“That is a unique skill capable of unleashing all the power in the body. I have only come across it in research and never really seen it before.”

“But I’m sure that it must be that sort of skill!” The student answered with excitement.

After all, to be able to see a skill that he had read in papers was something that excited him.

“Lin Xiu! Do your best!” A few south campus students started shouting and cheering for him.

All the freshmen started to cheer together.

After all, it was a battle between a freshman and a senior. All of the year 2 students that heard their cheers had a change in expression.

“Yu Yi! Kill that freshman! He’s too arrogant!” A few seniors turned cold and roared.

The atmosphere on the ground immediately became extremely sharp.

Either side that lost would not be able to accept it.

“Hmph! I’ve just warmed up, the real battle is about to begin!” Yu Yi roared and continued to exert power. He wanted to use his terrifying power to pull Dark Edge from Lin Xiu’s hands.

‘Damn it!’

Lin Xiu was able to sense the distinct change in strength from Yu Yi and the expression in his eyes changed.

He immediately activated Fury without hesitation!

“Scram for me!!”

Once Fury was activated, a surge of power entered Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu exerted a force as a large amount of flames erupted from Lin Xiu’s spear.

Terrifying flames suddenly blossomed out!

Yu Yi had the intention to hold Dark Edge tightly and wanted to seize Lin Xiu’s weapon away from him when he suddenly felt the heat emitting from the spear and his expression changed.

He immediately let go of the spear without hesitation and retreated backwards.

Rumble–

Lin Xiu swung Dark Edge with both hands and unleashed blazing birds towards Yu Yi!

The blazing birds were completely different from before, they had become gigantic!

And instead of charging at Yu Yi, they flew and hovered in the sky.

The blazing birds seemed to be converging. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The entire space started to turn red.

“So hot…” All the spectators started to perspire and droplets of perspiration trickled down their faces.

The flame had produced a heat that was too hot and caused the surrounding temperature to rise to about 60-70 degrees celsius!!!

“Fire Refining Starlit Sky!!!”

Lin Xiu looked at Yu Yi and roared.

This was a skill he gained enlightenment by himself. Lin Xiu wanted to use this skill to defeat Yu Yi instantly!

If he delayed further and any unexpected things were to occur, it would be even more troublesome for him.

“What skill is that!?” Ouyang Hang was so shocked he stood up. The skill was too inconceivable.

It was too horrifying as the temperature was enough to cook the spectators.

And this skill came from Lin Xiu.

He had never seen such a horrifying fire skill before!!!

Yu Yi was stunned when he saw the large flame. He did not have the confidence in the sphere to block the skill!

‘What do I do!?’

He looked around and realized that everyone’s focus was on the raging flame above them. His eyes changed as he took something out of his pocket.
