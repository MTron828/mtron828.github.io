“Give it to him.” Lin Lang glanced at the woman behind him and said aloud. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although the woman was a little reluctant to give up, she nodded at this time, and then took out a rank 8 odd crystal from the backpack.

As soon as the odd crystal was taken out, the sharp-eyed Lin Xiu saw the faint white light emanating from the odd crystal.

A white odd crystal.

“Here.” The woman hesitated for a while, and when she saw Lin Lang nodded to her, she handed the crystal to Lin Xiu.

Without the slightest hesitation, Lin Xiu directly took the odd crystal.

Lin Lang and the others felt a pain in the flesh when they saw that the rank 8 odd crystal was transferred to Lin Xiu’s hands.

“By the way, where did you get this odd crystal?”

After Lin Xiu put the rank 8 odd crystal into the pocket of his battle suit, he said to them curiously.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, their expressions changed slightly.

“I don’t mean anything, it’s just that with your strength, it shouldn’t be so easy to kill a rank 8 evolved beast.” Lin Xiu said with a smile at this time.

“Student Lin is amazing indeed.” Lin Lang said with a wry smile.

After thinking about it, he sighed and said, “That’s right, we didn’t kill a rank 8 evolved beast to get this rank 8 odd crystal.”

“But…”

“We found it.”

Found it? Hearing Lin Lang’s words, Lin Xiu raised his brows.

This was not an ordinary odd crystal, but a rank 8 odd crystal. How could they find it so easily.

“There is a place from where we just came with many bones of warriors and evolved beasts. We found it there.” Lin Lang said to Lin Xiu seriously.

“Oh?”

Lin Xiu suddenly became interested at this time, and always felt that there would be interesting places ahead.

“But a lot of warriors went over later. If you go over now, it would be dangerous.”

“These people saw that we found the rank 8 odd crystal and kept chasing us.”

“Well, thank you for the information.” Lin Xiu nodded, then took his Dark Edge spear and was about to leave.

“Student Lin, are you going there? There should be more warriors there now, and it would be dangerous “After all, Lin Xiu just saved him and the others, so Lin Lang reminded him kindly at this time.

“It’s okay.” Lin Xiu shook his head, then hesitantly said to them, “You are going back now?”

“I can only go back. After all, I didn’t expect that there are so many strong people in the Thunder Valley.”

These people suddenly smiled bitterly when they heard Lin Xiu’s words.

Originally, they wanted to come to the Thunder Valley to experience and complete some small tasks, but for some reason, so many warriors suddenly came and if they continue to stay here, there was a high possibility of losing their lives.

“Go towards that direction, there shouldn’t be any danger.” Lin Xiu showed them the way.

The previous warriors were all dead and the remaining Wan Lu and Lao Bai have also died in the cave. Now, except for the possibility of monsters falling from the space crack, there was generally no danger.

“But there are space cracks over there, you better be careful.”

After Lin Xiu finished speaking, he directly held his Dark Edge spear and walked in the direction Lin Lang said just now without looking back.

After watching Lin Xiu leave, Lin Lang and the others came to their senses.

“Space cracks!? They really have it here!?” A man standing next to Lin Lang said excitedly at this time.

The rest of the people were also excited. It was very likely that the space cracks would be accompanied by energy bodies from different dimensions or some materials from different dimensions.

“Go and have a look, but be careful.” Lin Lang nodded.

At this time, he had already written down Lin Xiu’s name. After all, the power that Lin Xiu showed just now was really too powerful. When he returned to the academy, he must inquire about which class of students was so powerful.

Lin Xiu continued to walk to the front at this time. There were too many unstable factors here. He has to find a safe place and absorb the energy of the rank 8 odd crystal.

As long as the energy of the two rank 8 odd crystals was completely absorbed, he should be able to directly breakthrough to rank 7!

But even so, Lin Xiu was not happy.

Parents’ hatred, and Luo Yue, he had to go to Sky city but in a place like the sky city, the rank 7 was not enough!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu’s desire to improve his strength became even stronger.

When he continued to walk forward, he saw a group of people in black battle suits, walking forward while searching around.

“Stop!” A man shouted coldly when he saw Lin Xiu approaching from here.

The rest of the men in black battle suits also looked at Lin Xiu at this time.

The battle sutis of these people were exactly the same as those of the people just now, and at a glance, you could tell that they were from the same organization.

But instead of using crossbows, these people were holding sabers.

Lin Xiu ignored the person who was yelling at him and continued to walk forward.

When he walked in front of the man, he directly held the Dark Edge spear and penetrated the man’s head.

The people around were shocked. They didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would be so ruthless.

“Kill him!”

When the others saw this scene, they immediately shouted and attacked Lin Xiu!

Bang bang bang-

But with a dull sound, a dozen corpses lay down on the ground – all of these corpses had a hole pierced through their head.

For these people, Lin Xiu didn’t bother with them too much. Since he had just killed so many of their accomplices, he didn’t care about killing them.

They weren’t good people anyway.

Following the direction Lin Lang said, he continued to walk ahead and found that the area in front seemed to be replaced by a barren area.

In this land, there were many huge stones and the ground was full of corpses.

There were warriors and various evolved beasts.

And there were some weird black crows around, pecking at a corpse that seemed to have died not long ago.

Lin Xiu looked at everything around this place in surprise. It seemed that this was what Lin Lang said.

But why are there so many corpses?

“Damn, all the good things here had been taken away!”

Just as Lin Xiu walked around a few huge rocks and towards the front, he saw several groups of warriors looking for something among the bones..
