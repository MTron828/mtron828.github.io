Chapter 323: Awakened Luo Yue

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Huatian strangely, then turned his eyes over to Luo Yue.

It was as though Luo Yue’s state had turned weird after absorbing the ice lotus fire energy.

White smoke emitted out of her body and Lin Xiu was able to see a thin layer of ice on her skin.

‘What… is going on!?’

“Leave her.” Luo Huatian walked over and spoke up while Lin Xiu was still in shock.

As though having sensed his thoughts, Luo Huatian continued, “She is absorbing the ice lotus fire now, there shouldn’t be any issues.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head upon hearing the assurance and sat by the side.

He immediately felt all his strength being sapped from his body the moment he sat down and became weak.

Fury had just ended and Lin Xiu felt extremely tired. Without thinking further, he activated his cultivation technique and started absorbing energy from around him.

The abundance of energy in the air around him surprised Lin Xiu, causing him to feel much more comfortable.

Rollie tried to crawl out of Lin Xiu’s bag, but upon discovering Luo Huatian beside Lin Xiu, it quickly returned.

“What an interesting guy…” Luo Huatian sat on the other side and supported his chin as he observed Lin Xiu and licked his lips as he muttered to himself.

‘But he isn’t strong enough yet, when he matures, it’ll be much more fun…’

Lin Xiu felt as though he was being stared at and his scalp started to turn numb. He opened his eyes and looked at Luo Huatian looking back at him.

Luo Huatian saw Lin Xiu looking over and gave a smile.

Lin Xiu felt a shiver go down his back as he trembled slightly. Why does he look like a gay?

Lin Xiu immediately felt slightly disgusted by this and quickly closed his eyes to focus on his cultivation technique instead.

Minutes and seconds passed and afternoon came. The sky started to turn slightly darker.

“Whew”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and opened his eyes. He noticed Luo Yue was still seated in the same position.

The absorption of the ice lotus fire seemed to still be in progress.

Lin Xiu was able to see that the grass around Luo Yue was covered with a layer of frost.

Boundless cold qi was emitted from her body.

But at this moment, Luo Huatian suddenly disappeared.

‘Where did he go?’

Before Lin Xiu could think further, he sensed Luo Yue trembling.

“Luo Yue?” Lin Xiu quickly shouted to her in surprise.

But Luo Yue’s eyes remained closed and her brows started to frown.

“Luo Yue, what happened?”

The change in her situation surprised Lin Xiu. He continued to probe her and extended his hand to her shoulder with the intent of calling her up when he felt an intense cold aura enveloping his body.

Lin Xiu’s hand was immediately covered with a thin layer of frost!

Cold, so cold that even his bones seemed to have froze!

Lin Xiu retracted his hand and the layer of frost slowly disappeared.

Luo Yue’s lips spewed out white gas and her entire body trembled as though she was unable to bear the frigid cold aura.

‘What do I do?!’

Lin Xiu became slightly anxious at the sight of this.

He could not get closer to her because once he did, the cold aura would freeze his body.

‘Will the Ice lotus fire be afraid of the red lotus fire?’

Lin Xiu suddenly became curious at this thought.

‘The two are both lotus fire, so they should be on par.’ 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Lin Xiu extended his right hand and used his source strength to converge at his palm.

His pupils constricted as a burst of flame suddenly appeared!

The red lotus fire caused the air around the turn red.

The cold aura around Luo Yue’s body slowly disappeared.

Lin Xiu was shocked by the change. ‘The red lotus fire can be used in this way?’

Luo Yue’s trembling body seemed to slow down.

The appearance of the red lotus fire caused the surrounding area to turn warm and her complexion became much better.

Lin Xiu sat by her side and maintained the red lotus fire to warm her body.

But the consumption of source strength was extremely rapid.

For the sake of maintaining this state, Lin XIu took out all the odd crystals and absorbed their energies while maintaining the fire.

Minutes and seconds passed and night came. Lin Xiu was no longer able to hold on and fell to the ground as he gasped for breath.

It was too tiring for him, the state of using source strength to unleash the red lotus fire was too horrifying.

All around him were transparent odd crystal rocks.

The bag filled with odd crystals was completely absorbed.

While he was gasping, he sensed something and turned to see Luo Yue. She had awoken and was looking at him.

Lin Xiu revealed a joyous expression as he sat back up. He looked at her, “You’re awake?”

Luo Yue nodded her head. Her complexion was not good and her originally white face was even paler.

Her body emitted a faint cold aura that made Lin Xiu feel cold.

She looked at Lin Xiu with a trace of gentleness in her eyes that disappeared quickly.

After hesitating for a second, she whispered to him:

“Thank you.”
