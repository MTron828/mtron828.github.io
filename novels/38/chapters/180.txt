Chapter 181: Obtaining the Odd Crystal

The man with the laser gun, who wanted to shoot, saw this scene and his pupils suddenly constricted.

Just when he wanted to continue to raise his gun and shoot at Lin Xiu, a cold light flashed, and his head was directly penetrated.

Fresh blood spurted out in an instant like a blood-red plum blossom.

Lin Xiu stood here and drew the Dark Edge spear from his head, then looked around – there seemed to be no one else on this side.

These people were very well-armed. They all wore the latest combat suits and had new laser guns.

Why did they attack them suddenly? Did they want the Odd crystals?

Lin Xiu heard a slight noise at this moment and quickly ducked in the corner.

Bang bang bang——

Laser beams shot from all directions.

The walls were covered in holes.

“Found the target! Everyone gather and attack!” The men holding laser guns on this floor slowly approached in the direction that Lin Xiu had escaped.

The muzzle of the laser guns in their hands was also pointed in that direction at this time.

As soon as there is any movement there, they would pull the trigger and shoot.

Lin Xiu hid behind and knitted his brows.

Looking at the holes in the wall in front, if he walks out, he will be shot and turned into a sieve!

Right now, his combat suit couldn’t withstand so many laser beam shots and even if it can withstand it, the impact will still be there.

He has to think of a way…

Bang bang bang——

The men with laser guns slowly moved closer to that side. In the next second, as a bright light flashed, they directly pulled the trigger and shot wildly!

“Skill!?” Seeing the flaming birds appear, these people were shocked and retreated to avoid them.

The disadvantage of using weapons is that they cannot fight in close combat at all and they could only dodge when encountering this kind of skill.

“Quickly get out of the way!!!” The temperature of these flaming birds was extremely high and they would be burnt to death if they charged over in this situation!

These people had forgotten to aim their guns toward Lin Xiu already and were all confused by the flaming birds that kept flying out. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

At this moment, a black figure rushed out from inside!

Swish––

It sounded like a gust of wind and several men who were avoiding the flaming birds had traces of blood appearing on their necks in a split second.

Bang bang bang——

Some of the men behind came to their senses and began to pull the trigger of their laser guns. A large number of laser rays shot out.

The place was covered in holes in an instant.

But Lin Xiu’s reaction was simply too fast, even in such a narrow place, his ability to dodge was still very strong.

These people were holding laser guns and weren’t a match for Lin Xiu in close combat at all.

Following the continuous waving of the Dark Edge spear in his hand, those who were holding the laser guns were cut to the ground by Lin Xiu one by one.

“Are you the leader?” Lin Xiu saw a man in front of him whose outfit and weapons were obviously different from these people.

He pointed the spearhead at him and said indifferently.

“You…” The man’s eyes widened and he couldn’t believe that Lin Xiu managed to deal with all his companions in such a short time.

“Ah!!!” At this moment, there was a scream from the opposite building and a man was kicked out of the high building.

It must be Luo Yue who had done that.

Seeing this terrifying scene, the man became even more frightened.

“Why are you attacking me?” Lin Xiu said plainly.

The man’s gaze changed a bit and when he was about to pull the trigger, Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear hit it and split the laser gun in half.

“Don’t kill me!!!” He completely submitted to his fate when he saw this scene and begged with a look of horror in his eyes.

“I merely accepted a mission on the hunting net…”

‘Hunting net?’

Lin Xiu remembered Luo Li telling him that he had a bounty on him on the website – the reward was 10 million union coins.

“Okay, you can go to hell.” Lin Xiu nodded. Before the man could speak, Lin Xiu shook his right hand and the Dark Edge spear penetrated through the man’s chest.

Because of the blood flowing out of these people, the surroundings had a bloody stench.

Lin Xiu took a closer look and there was a bulging backpack behind the man.

After pondering for some time, Lin Xiu tore off his backpack from him. When he opened it up, besides many ordinary items, there were many Odd crystals inside!

“Two rank 5 Odd crystals, one rank 4, and the rest are rank 3.” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but shook his head looking at these things.

The rank 5 Odd crystals were considered a gain, but those rank 3 Odd crystals were of no use.

But he could absorb the energy inside.

Without hesitation, after putting the two rank 5 Odd Crystals into his backpack, he took the remaining Odd Crystals and began to use his ‘Cultivation Technique’.

The energy in the Odd crystal was quickly absorbed by Lin Xiu with the use of the ‘cultivation technique’.

In a short period of about five minutes, the energy in the Odd crystals was absorbed completely and the Odd crystals with different colors became transparent, which meant that the energy inside was gone and they were just useless stones now.

“Rollie, this is for you to eat.” Lin Xiu took one of the rank 4 Odd crystals and put it into the backpack behind him.

Rollie got out of the backpack quickly and took the Odd crystal and slowly began to eat.

Ss ss ss––

When Lin Xiu was about to walk away, he noticed a strange noise around him.

It gave him a creepy feeling.

He turned and looked up. Next to the corpses of the people who had just been killed by him, a lot of rats appeared, gnawing on their corpses.

Some people’s faces were eaten directly by those sharp teeth.

The noise made when the rats bit down gave Lin Xiu goosebumps.

‘There are so many weird things here…’

Lin Xiu walked down and when he first walked out on the road outside, he saw Luo Yue also walking down and was holding something in her hand.

“Done?” Lin Xiu asked aloud.

“En.” Luo Yue nodded and tossed something glistening to Lin Xiu.
