Chapter 53: The Terrifying Creepers

Just as the men were trying to charge forward, Lin Xiu immediately stopped them.

“What’s the matter?” Being together these two days, not only the other soldiers, even Xu Wen trusted Lin Xiu a lot.

“Those zombies are not simple, and although they seem to be moving slowly, there is probably a problem.” Lin Xiu frowned and said.

The Analytic Eye would not deceive him and it clearly stated that these zombies were quick.

As for why they were now creeping slowly, Lin Xiu felt that it was likely that they were feigning it.

Like some animals in nature, they often disguised themselves in order to hunt for food.

When the prey approached, it would be taken by surprise and eaten.

Lin Xiu held the Silver Immortal Soul spear in his left hand, then reached to the ground, and pulled out a laser pistol in his right hand.

He aimed at the white zombie crawling on the wall, then pulled the trigger, and shot it!

Sou——

A laser ray shot straight over there in this instant.

But it was at this moment that something strange happened. They saw that the creeping zombie suddenly became like a nimble lizard and dodged his attack swiftly.

“How is that possible!” The soldier who saw this scene widened his eyes in surprise.

Laser rays traveled so fast, how could they dodge it so easily?

But he didn’t have time to think further because, at this moment, the zombies in front seemed to be alerted.

A large number of creepers jumped off the wall at high speed.

Their bodies crouched on the ground and had converged into rows. Looking from a distance, there was a vast expanse of whiteness and it was very disgusting.

“So… so many.” Li Yi looked at this scene and swallowed his saliva.

“Be careful, just make sure you don’t get bitten.” Lin Xiu also became cautious at this moment. Looking at those creepers now, he felt a little helpless.

The wound on his shoulders was very deep, and although it had almost healed, it was not fully recovered.

Depending on his physique, it would take at least two or three days for him to be able to brandish the spear without letting the wound open.

Xu Wen had already entered battle mode and was gripping the long sword in his hand tightly.

“Roar!!!”

A creeping zombie opened its mouth to reveal its sharp teeth and roared like a beast as a large number of creeping zombies rushed over to Lin Xiu and the others!

Their limbs were on the ground and they crawled swiftly like cheetahs.

They were exceptionally fast!

It was unlike the slow creeping action on the wall just now.

“Kill!!!” Xu Wen gritted his teeth and charged over!

He sliced through the air and severed that creeper in front into two.

The strength of a rank 2 evolved beast was only equivalent to a rank 1 warrior. If they were careful, they didn’t have to be afraid.

After being put through the mill for two days, whether it was guts or skills, these soldiers were now completely different from before.

Swish swish swish——

Lin Xiu could not hold his spear and attack, and could only carry a pistol to support by shooting from the back.

“Bang.” A creeping zombie that tried to pounce on a soldier over there got shot by the laser rays.

It went straight through the head of the creeping zombie.

“Thank… Thank you.”

The soldier trembled as he looked at this scene, then heaved a sigh of relief.

These creeping zombies were too fast and were in large numbers. If one accidentally fell, the creeping zombies at the back would fall as well and press you on the ground. By then, you would be dead meat.

“Be careful, these darn things are moving too fast!” Xu Wen, brandished his saber, and missed several times, only in the next second did he sever a zombie into two.

Lin Xiu stared at the other side and covered them as they fought.

With the continuous shooting, Lin Xiu’s aim became more and more accurate. In the end, after understanding how those creeping zombies attack, he could already predict and shoot.

“Help!”

There were simply too many crawling zombies and very soon, due to physical exhaustion, one of the soldiers was pounced on by a creeping zombie and fell to the ground. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The moment the creeping zombie threw him to the ground, it opened his mouth and bit him on the neck.

His artery was bitten straight off and blood was shot straight out.

In the distance, although Lin Xiu reacted swiftly and shot a laser ray directly to the zombie’s head, it was too late. Because at this time, the creeping zombies at the back seemed to go crazy and began to bite his body up.

Looking at this terrible scene, the rest of the soldiers became afraid. Once people were afraid, they would slowly lose the desire to fight.

“What are you guys doing!? Do you want to die!?” Xu Wen saw this and roared.

“If you don’t want to die, kill!”

Xu Wen roared so loudly that it was like a hard knock on those soldiers’ heads. They gritted their teeth and continued to fight.

Due to the soldier’s death, they were also stirred up and blood-thirsty and began to attack tyrannically.

The bodies of the creeping zombies were severed into pieces, and there was a great deal of blood flowing across the ground.

Lin Xiu, who was shooting constantly in the back, suddenly heard a chime.

“Ding~~~”

“Congratulations Master on successfully leveling up to level 14!”

Level up!? Oh right, each creeping zombie had more than 3,000 experience points, and including the previous accumulation, it made sense for him to level up now.

The stats board emerged in his mind:

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: 14

Experience: 15 (1,607,528 experience points required for the next level)

Strength: 124

Physique: 70

Speed: 60

(Note: An average person scores at least 38 for each segment)

Skill: An analytic eye, Fury

Rage build-up: 0/100

Overall combat strength: 888

Remaining potential points: 14

Level 14!

But looking at the experience points required for the next level, it was as high as 1.6 million – this was simply insane. Killing that rank 3 warrior only gave him about 100,000 experience points. He would probably take a long time to reach level 15.

Level 15 was the dividing line and could unlock the Gene Lock!

Without much thought, Lin Xiu added ten potential points directly to Physique and the remaining four potential points to Strength.

As soon as the points were added, Lin Xiu felt very comfortable in his body, and the wound itched slightly as if it was starting to heal at an accelerated pace!
