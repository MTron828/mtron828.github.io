1215 Looking For Trouble

“Yes!”

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, the guards brought Zhou Hu inside so that he could be treated.

“City lord….”

Mr Pang was shocked as well. He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would come outside so quickly.

!!

“Tell me what just happened.”

Lin Xiu stared at Mr Pang.

From what he heard earlier, it looks like something has happened in the past few days that he was gone from the city.

“Yes.”

Mr Pang did not hesitate. He nodded his head and started telling Lin Xiu what had happened.

“These days, near the mines…..”

According to Mr Pang, when Lin Xiu wasn’t away from Lingxian City to be in Manhuang City, there are some random warriors who went to the mine, saying that they would like to buy the mines from Lin Xiu.

However, all of them were rejected by Mr Pang.

Energy stones mines were something incredibly rare. Plus, they have detected that there were a lot more energy stones at the mine to be explored.

These would be the main income for their city. Why would they sell it to others?

Although they have already been rejected by Mr Pang, they were still trying to cause trouble at the mine. They even injured Zhao Hu, who was one of the men responsible for working at the mines.

“Did you find out where these warriors are from?”

After hearing Mr Pang talk about what happened, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

“We’re not sure.”

Mr Pang shook his head.

The warrior god realm was a huge place but the Lingxian City was too small.

Plus, they were controlled by Tianlan Pavilion previously and they don’t even have an intelligence agency.

“Let’s go. We’ll pay them a visit.”

Lin Xiu didn’t waste too much time thinking about it and walked out of the door.

“I’m coming too!”

Baili Haoling quickly volunteered to follow.

Rollie and Xiao Bai ran out from the courtyard as well and followed behind Lin Xiu.

As Lin Xiu has been to the mines to collect these energy stones, he knew his way there.

The mines were now different from how it was before.

Due to how Lin Xiu had already destroyed the Tianlan Pavilion, Lin Xiu did not force the commoners to forcefully continue collecting energy stones here at the mine. He would offer a job that pays well and these workers would be in charge of mining these energy stones.

A slavery work suddenly turned into one of the best jobs in the city.

However, most of the workers who were hired were forced into the centre of the mines.

They seem to be arguing about something.

“Who are you?! These mines belong to the Lingxian City. You have injured Zhao Hu! Your city lord will definitely come after you!!!”

One of the management workers shouted out in rage.

The other warriors who stood beside him looked mad as well.

“City lord? Even if Lingxian City had a city lord, it would most likely be a useless man.”

Standing opposite them were another group of warriors that had a set of luxurious weapons.

These warriors had a murderous aura and it was easy to conclude that they weren’t nice people.

“Boss! I’ve paid a visit to Lingxian City, there aren’t any powerful warriors found in the city lord mansion.”

One of these warriors whispered to their leader.

The warrior that led them was a bald man. There was also a scar that stretched across his face. The man looked terrifying.

“En. I know.”

The bald man nodded his head and turned towards the workers who worked at the mines.

“I, Wu Shanyu, will be taking over these mines.”

The bald man informed the workers about it as he stared at them.

“Impossible!”

The workers started protesting after hearing what he said.

“Then, we’ll have to kill all of you.”

Wu Shanyu said with a cold tone.

His eyes were cold as well.

After spending a few times here, they have confirmed that there wasn’t anyone powerful here in Lingxian City.

Since there are no powerful warriors here, it meant that there was no owner that claimed the mines here in this city.

With Wu Shanyu’s commands, all of the warriors standing behind him, pulled out their weapons and started killing the workers who were at the mines!

The workers who worked at the mines were frightened. They were obviously scared to lose their life.

Although they were warriors as well, they were nothing compared to the men that came with Wu Shanyu.

“Our city lord will be back soon. By then, you would all…”

One of the workers pointed at Wu Shanyu with his trembling hands and warned them.

“It looks like you wouldn’t be able to wait for him to come home.”

Wu Shanyu laughed. He held his machete and was about to chop the warrior into two halves!

Damn!

The man’s eyes were wide open. He didn’t think that Wu Shanyu would really have the guts to kill them!

However, just when he thought that he would be chopped into several pieces by the machete, there was a man that suddenly appeared right in front of them.

Boom – –

Wu Shanyu suddenly felt that his machete was caught by someone’s hands!

“Who….who are you?” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Wu Shanyu saw that there was a young man standing opposite him. The young man caught his machete with his bare hands!

“Who are you?!”

Wu Shanyu was a little terrified as he asked.

He subconsciously pulled the machete that Lin Xiu was holding onto but no matter how hard he tried, it still didn’t work!

Boom boom boom – –

Then, there was a soft groan that came from beside him.

There was blood that splattered all over his face.

He turned around and noticed that all of his men had been chopped into pieces before they even had the chance to slice the workers at the mines.

It was a young girl who had two short daggers in her arms.

The young girl had very sharp movement as she swung her daggers. His men were no match for her and all of them died instantly.

This…..this was impossible!!!

Seeing what was left of his men, Wu Shanyu started shivering in fear.

“City…city lord!”

The worker, who thought that he would be chopped into pieces by Wu Shanyu, screamed with joy!

This was because he noticed that it was none other than Lin Xiu who was standing right in front of him.

The rest of them also noticed that Lin Xiu had returned. All of them were finally feeling excited.

Due to how Lin Xiu had just destroyed the Tianlan Pavilion and allowed most of the warriors captured to regain freedom, there wasn’t anyone in Lingxian City who didn’t know who the new city lord was.

“You…..are trying to take over my mines?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he stared at Wu Shanyu.

“I…I…”

Wu Shanyu’s body shivered uncontrollably. He could clearly feel the horrible strength that was coming from Lin Xiu’s body.

It was an imaginable amount of energy that was so incredibly strong that he didn’t even think of fighting Lin Xiu.

“Goodbye.”

Lin Xiu was ready to kill this man.

“You can’t kill me! Once you do, everyone in Lingxian City will die! I am…”

Wu Shanyu’s body suddenly turned cold. Before he could finish his sentence, he felt a warm surge of fluid coming from his neck. There was blood everywhere.
