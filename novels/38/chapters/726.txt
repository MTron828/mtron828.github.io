Chapter 727 Heart of Frost!

Lin Xiu, who saw this scene, didn’t think much about it, he turned around and fled the same way.

Because at this time, it was no longer possible to fight.

If he doesn’t leave, he will be buried here.

“Finally at the entrance.”

At this time, Qian Jin and the others were standing at the entrance and they also seemed to have lingering fears.

Taking a closer look at this time, following the earthquake, the entire ground collapsed.

The terrifying magma that they saw when they first came in seemed to be rising as well.

“Where’s our leader!?”

Only now did Zhang Zhiheng’s team realize that Zhang Zhiheng, their leader, had disappeared.

“He is probably still absorbing the inheritance inside.”

Some warriors from other groups said at this time.

Because they failed to snatch the inheritance with Zhang Zhiheng just now, they were still brooding

And the warriors of Zhang Zhiheng’s team had become extremely gloomy now.

But in front of it, because of the collapsed ground, it has become like a wide and long lava river and even a warrior cannot leap over

“I heard that some families in Tianlong City have secret techniques that allow them to walk on air. If so, we can cross this side.”

A warrior looked at this scene and said subconsciously.

“That is the stunt of the Tianlong city Wu family. At present, there is only one person who can do it and that is the old man of the Wu family, my old friend.” Huangji heard this man’s words and immediately touched his beard, then said proudly.

But he never thought that the old man of the Wu family had already been killed by Lin Xiu.

Of course, Lin Xiu did not find the so-called ‘Levitation’ skill.

“Damn!”

As soon as Lin Xiu ran out, he saw that the front had completely collapsed and there was no way to leave. When he took a closer look, the bottom was all lava!

“Lin Xiu!!!”

Qian Jin noticed Lin Xiu’s figure from a distance and immediately shouted loudly. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Why is this guy still there?

Looking at this scene, Qian Jin couldn’t help but have black lines all over his head.

But in the current situation, unless Lin Xiu grows his wings and can fly, there is no way he can get here!

“This kid…” Jiang Jun also frowned. He didn’t expect Lin Xiu to be so slow and still be there.

Jiang Jun didn’t have any hostility towards Lin Xiu. Lin Xiu was the top of the Tianlong City’s Tianjiao list after all. Although he was from Earth, this competition also gave honor to Sky City.

Huangji sneered.

Go to hell!

Boom boom boom —

At this time, the tremors began to come again and the magma quickly filled up! “Come on!”

When the surrounding warriors saw this scene, their eyes changed greatly.

Even a powerful warrior, facing this terrifying magma, can’t resist it for long even if he unfolds the ‘Sphere’!

Qian Jin looked at Lin Xiu’s side, there was nothing he could do at this time, he just turned around and left.

But in his heart, he still felt that it was a pity. After all, Lin Xiu was the first person who made him feel so powerful and was suited to be his opponent.

“Ah, it looks like I need to use hair tonic again when I go out.”

Lin Xiu laughed at himself, in the next moment, the look in his eyes became firm, then he jumped directly to the rising magma below!

As soon as his entire body sank into the magma, Lin Xiu felt a tingling pain in his entire body, but soon, Lin Xiu was fully used to it.

The clothes on the body are corroded, but the double-edged sword and boots and the like did not corrode so much.

After all, what he won by lottery in the system was quite solid.

Long ago, Lin Xiu had experienced this kind of ordeal on the Tower of Trials. Now this magma cannot damage Lin Xiu’s body at all. And under this, Lin Xiu’s eyes didn’t have any problems.

But all he saw was just red and yellow.

Just when Lin Xiu was about to swim to the exit with the rising lava, Lin Xiu seemed to have discovered something.

Huh?

Deep down, there was a faint light.

Moreover, Lin Xiu faintly felt a strange energy fluctuation. Below this, there seemed to be something extraordinary!

Lin Xiu, who felt all of this, swam directly downwards.

Because of the high density of the magma, Lin Xiu had a hard time swimming and he also had a Dark Edge spear in his hand, which made his speed a little slower.

Fortunately, Lin Xiu’s physical fitness was relatively good and at this time, he was about to reach the bottom.

What’s this?

Looking at the white light below, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

This was a ball of white light.

As soon as he approached, Lin Xiu felt a biting cold that spread throughout his body!

How could it be!?

He was obviously in the magma yet there was such a chilling feeling, which was really too strange.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu felt his heart beating hard.

According to the information about the power and skills absorbed on the stone tablet, Lin Xiu’s body seemed to automatically activate some skills.

Heart of Frost!

According to the information passed down on the stone tablet, Lin Xiu quickly knew that this white mass was the most precious treasure produced by heaven and earth, the Heart of Frost.

The reason why this Warrior King was called the Ice and Snow King was because he devoured the Heart of Frost.

It is because of the power of the Heart of Frost that he was able to reach the top rank of Warrior King, but because he was not able to completely devour the Heart of Frost; the Heart of Frost only existed in his body and did not absorb and fuse into his body, so his strength has never reached the level of Respected warrior.

After his death, he also hid it here so that it would be easily discovered.

After all, no one would know that there was such a thing in this molten underground.

Warriors also couldn’t jump into the molten lava without dying.

Of course, he didn’t know that there was also the existence of a warrior like Lin Xiu who cultivated the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ and specialized in exercising under extremely harsh conditions.

Lin Xiu reached out and touched the Heart of Frost at this time, because he had inherited that unique skill. When he touched the Heart of Frost, although Lin Xiu felt that his hands were frozen and numbed and he couldn’t move, but he could still see that the heart of frost was slowly being integrated into the palm of his hand.

Gulu

And in the next moment, the Heart of Frost seemed to go through his arm and stopped at his chest!

Boom boom boom —

At this time, the many warriors who had stocked up had already fled to the outside.

As soon as he went out, the gate collapsed in an instant!

Lin Xiu… is he dead?
