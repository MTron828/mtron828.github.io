Hm?

Hearing these strange sounds at this time, Lin Xiu subconsciously looked toward the source of the sound.

At this moment, if you look carefully, you can clearly see a middle-aged man walking over from the other side.

This middle-aged man was wearing a special metal boot, so when he walked, he made that strange sound.

!!

“God-level skill, not bad.”

The middle-aged man walked over at this time, looked at Lin Xiu and said lightly.

Lin Xiu looked at the man and narrowed his eyes slightly.

The analytic eye was used instantly at this time.

With the use of the analytic eye, Lin Xiu was able to see the man’s attributes clearly.

Name: Ning Tianhong

力量:154

Strength: 154

体质:124

Physique: 124

速度:58

Speed: 58

This man’s attributes seem to be stronger than the current Lin Xiu.

And this is only the attribute in the current state. After his strength erupts, the attributes may be further improved.

“Let me introduce myself, Ning…”

“Ning Tianhong.”

Lin Xiu looked at the man who was walking over, and before he finished speaking, Lin Xiu said lightly.

The middle-aged man with a calm expression on his face was stunned when he heard Lin Xiu’s voice.

“You know me?”

The middle-aged man’s eyes widened slightly, and his eyes were full of disbelief.

He didn’t remember that he had met Lin Xiu before, but how did Lin Xiu know his name?

“You don’t need to know about that.”

Lin Xiu revealed a mysterious smile.

“what’s up.”

Lin Xiu continued to speak.

When he first came here, Lin Xiu deliberately found a wilderness and he felt that there was no one nearby.

The sudden arrival of this person still made Lin Xiu vigilant.

“Lin Xiu, right?”

Although there were doubts in his heart, at this moment, his calm and calm expression returned to his face.

“I watched your game.”

“Your strength is very good.”

Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows, then said lightly, “If you have anything to say, just say it.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Since you’re so straightforward, I’ll just say it directly.”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Ning Tianhong also said directly.

“The next game, I want you to lose.”

As soon as he finished speaking, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes suddenly shrank.

“Why.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly, looked at him and said lightly.

It seems that the match list was released today, but Lin Xiu didn’t go to see it.

“One billion.”

Ning Tianhong set a price.

“This match is very important to him, and you may not be able to win him.”

Ning Tianhong continued to speak without waiting for Lin Xiu to say something.

Seeing that Lin Xiu still didn’t speak, Ning Tianhong frowned, then continued to say: “1.5 billion, the highest price; at this price, you can buy a precious god-level skill card in the warrior store.”

“What do you think, I’m short of money or god-level skill card?”

Lin Xiu revealed a smile when he spoke.

Ning Tianhong’s face changed slightly. Lin Xiu just released a god-level skill. Although it seems that he is still in the practice stage, according to Lin Xiu’s words, he is neither short of money nor skill cards.

Ning Tianhong took a deep breath at this time, as if he had made some kind of decision: “You can get a promise from the Ning family.”

“The Ning family can help you do one thing that is within their means.”

“really?”

...

Lin Xiu frowned, then said directly.

“yes.”

After hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Ning Tianhong felt relieved. If there is a need, then the conditions can be negotiated.

“‘Spirit Fire Energy Stone’, ‘The Root of Frost’, ‘Metal of Thousand Years Old’, help me find these three materials and I will admit defeat.”

Lin Xiu said directly.

Originally, he came to participate in the Multi-City Competition just for the materials.

If this guy could really find them, he could perhaps admit defeat. After all, winning doesn’t seem to be of much benefit.

“These materials are all priceless, impossible.”

As soon as Ning Tianhong heard Lin Xiu’s words, his face became extremely ugly.

The materials that Lin Xiu mentioned were all they wanted.

“‘Spirit Fire Energy Stone’ and ‘The Root of Frost’, I have only heard of them but have not obtained it, ‘Metal of Thousand Years Old’ is available at the God King, but it is impossible for me to get it, so you need to change the condition.”

...

“Then there’s nothing to talk about.”

Lin Xiu spread his hands and said.

“Okay, I’m going to practice. It’s none of my business if I hurt you.”

While Lin Xiu was talking, the White Moon spear in his hand began to surge with dark blue flames.

The temperature of these flames is very high. With the appearance of the flames, the temperature of the surrounding air seems to have increased a lot in an instant.

Ning Tianhong’s face changed slightly at this moment.

Then he turned around and was about to leave.

But the moment he raised his foot to leave, he suddenly turned around and rushed toward Lin Xiu!

From the sleeve of his right hand, a cold glow suddenly burst out.

A dagger instantly appeared in his right hand.

Holding this dagger, he was about to stab Lin Xiu in the forehead!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly and the White Moon spear in his hand directly blocked in front of him!

Dang–

With a clear sound, the dagger in Ning Tianhong’s hand stabbed at the body of his White Moon spear.

The terrifying temperature coming from the body of the White Moon spear caused Ning Tianhong’s expression to change slightly.

Before he could react, the White Moon spear in Lin Xiu’s hand shook and a powerful impact immediately sent Ning Tianhong’s body flying.

“Humph!”

Ning Tianhong, who was thrown out by the shock, quickly stabilized his figure.

Looking at Lin Xiu who was attacking with the White Moon spear, he waved back to the left and the surrounding ground shook instantly.

A large number of rock spikes hit directly from the ground!

Whoosh whoosh——

At this time, Lin Xiu’s body moved and the ‘Flashing Souls’ body skill was used and he quickly dodged.

“Humph!”

Ning Tianhong’s figure stepped back and a khaki source mark suddenly appeared on his forehead.

A large amount of soil around it surged up crazily at this moment, then slowly gathered into a gigantic behemoth.

Looking at Lin Xiu who dodged the rock spikes and was about to attack, Ning Tianhong shouted, “Go!”

The giant beast made of mud directly attacked Lin Xiu!

“break!!!”

Seeing the giant beast rushing toward him, Lin Xiu showed no sign of fear. He firmly held the White Moon spear in his hand, then slashed out with a slash!

Boom——

An incomparably huge force burst out directly!
