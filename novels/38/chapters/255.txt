Chapter 256: Powerful Zhou Wenhao

“100 million union coins.” Zhou Wenhao looked at Lin Xiu with interest as he replied.

All the people behind him revealed arrogant expressions when they heard his words.

After all, the amount of bounty was enough to prove his strength.

“Wenhao, we need to kill him!” The man from before glared at Lin Xiu, thinking that he was too arrogant and spoke up.

He wanted the android battle tiger before but their reluctance to hand one over made him unhappy.

This fueled their desire to get rid of Lin Xiu and the rest.

After all, they had done such a thing many times.

Who would have thought that Lin Xiu and this team would be so strong and kill many of them despite the ambush!

If not for Zhou Wenhao’s appearance, all of them would have died!

“Relax, they will all die.” Zhou Wenhao nodded his head as swept his gaze across Lin Xiu and the team and replied indifferently.

Right as he said that, he moved his right hand and pulled out the giant sword that was stuck in the ground beside him.

And he suddenly became a shadow as he charged towards Lin Xiu!

‘What a terrifying speed!’

Lin Xiu’s eyes grew large and his pupils constricted when he saw Zhou Wenhao charging at him.

“Go and die!” The man clenched his fists and muttered under his breath.

They were all aware of Zhou Wenhao’s strength, although Lin Xiu and the others were rather strong, they were definitely not his opponent!

Clank-

Lin Xiu saw a cold gleam and subconsciously used Dark Edge to strike at that point!

His spear instantly collided with Zhou Wenhao’s giant sword.

A loud clashing sound came out.

“Your reaction is not too bad.” Zhou Wenhao looked at Lin Xiu and gave a look of praise. He raised the giant sword with one hand.

The giant sword was extremely heavy but Zhou Wenhao was able to wield it single handedly and swing it extremely quickly. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

They were able to see how strong Zhou Wenhao was from this.

“Interesting.” Lin Xiu did not cower back and snorted.

The two moved at the same time and attacked with their weapons!

The spear and sword collided and produced metallic collision sounds.

Sparks flew all over.

“Kill them.” Guo Ling was surprised to see Lin Xiu standing on equal grounds against Zhou Wenhao. She looked at the other assailants and gave the command.

Qiu Li and the others nodded, it was the best opportunity to kill them.

They suddenly moved and rushed at the enemies!

These warriors did not move despite seeing Guo Ling and her team rushing towards them and instead revealed strange smiles on their faces.

Bang-

A blue protective shield appeared before them.

“Protective barriers!?” Guo Ling frowned.

They had produced a new technology capable of producing protective barriers.

It was similar to Sphere and could be used to block attacks.

But it was immovable and stayed in one place to block out attacks.

Bang-

Qiu Li used his own blade and slashed down on the barrier.

But aside from hearing the heavy sound, the barrier did not change in the slightest.

“We can’t, this barrier is the latest model and even missiles can’t destroy it.” Guo Ling looked at the machine producing the barrier and commented.

“Let’s help to kill Zhou Wenhao first then.”

Guo Ling looked at the other side and decided.

Bang-

Right as she finished her sentence, a loud and heavy sound came out from the other side.

Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge clashed with Zhou Wenhao’s gigantic sword again.

This time, the powerful impact flung Lin Xiu backwards.

He crashed into the branches of a gigantic tree.

“Seems like I don’t need to use any skills with your strength.” Zhou Wenhao looked at Lin Xiu who was flung onto the tree and said indifferently.

While saying that, he suddenly swung the gigantic sword in his right hand to the side!

Guo Ling was about to launch a sneak attack on Zhou Wenhao from the side and did not expect him to block her without even turning his head.

Guo Ling frowned as she leaped backwards. Zhou Wenhao turned to look at her when she landed and with a flicker, he appeared before Guo Ling!

He swung the gigantic sword at her body!

Clank-

Guo Ling reacted quickly and raised her right hand to block Zhou Wenhao’s attack.

But Zhou Wenhao’s sword was too powerful. Although Guo Ling had managed to block it, her right hand turned numb immediately and she almost let go of her sword.

“Damn it!” Qiu Li and the others charged at Zhou Wenhao at this moment!

“Interesting, I’ve not met so many rank 6 warriors in a long time.” Zhou Wenhao commented and swung his sword again!

Countless metallic collision sounds came out as Zhou Wenhao fought against Guo Ling and her team of five with ease.

“Hahaha, you guys are dead!” One of the men in the barrier saw what was happening and laughed out loud.

Be it rank 6 warriors or not, the man believed that they would die with Zhou Wenhao around!!!

“Stars of sun and moon!” Zhou Wenhao saw that Guo Ling’s team was coordinating very well, one would attack him and if he tried to retaliate, another would intercept him.

Guo Ling and the others launched continuous attacks without stopping, causing him to frown.

In the next moment, he suddenly swung his giant sword, and a bright light emitted out.

His originally bronze weapon suddenly became transparent and emitted a silver light!

This silver light was extremely resplendent.
