1172 Secret Scroll Inheritance

At this time, Lin Xiu’s eyes continued to glance around.

In this huge space, there were a lot of divine marks emitting a faint light.

All of these divine marks were circular and they were complex patterns formed by the source force.

The imprint of each divine mark seemed to be different.

!!

With so many divine marks here, does it have any special meaning…

“I found it, Bai Lingxian.”

When everyone walked to the front, they could clearly see that there was a huge statue there.

As everyone came here, this statue actually emitted a faint white light.

This statue is a statue of a man, looking gentle and elegant.

And the whole statue looks lifelike.

In the hands of this statue, it seems to be holding a scroll.

“Bai Lingxian’s Scroll of Divine Marks…”

Some warriors seem to have heard of something previously and looking at this scene at this time, they can’t help but say aloud.

Ye Yu and Zhao Laosan looked at the scroll and the pupils in their eyes shrank slightly.

At first, the ruins of such a small town were disdainful for them to come.

But Bai Lingxian was not an ordinary God warrior, but a God warrior who focuses on cultivating Divine Marks.

Being able to obtain his secret art inheritance and become a Divine Marker will greatly increase their strength!

Zhao Laosan was originally moved, but when he thought of the divine mark that appeared when he just touched those things, he stopped.

Here, there will definitely be a trap hidden and if he made a move right now, there will be danger. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“That’s Bai Lingxian’s secret scroll of divine marks. Whoever wants to get it can get it by himself.”

At this time, Zhao Laosan glanced at the surrounding warriors, then said lightly.

Hearing Zhao Laosan’s words, the surrounding warriors were stunned for a moment, their eyes filled with disbelief.

Bai Lingxian’s inheritance was very likely in this secret scroll, this Zhao Laosan simply handed over to others?

At this time, their eyes turned to Ye Yu’s side. Ye Yu and the others in Luanxuan Palace didn’t seem to say anything.

“Since nobody wants it, I’ll give it a try.”

At this time, a warrior of the God warrior level walked out of the group of warriors and walked directly towards the statue of Bai Lingxian.

The secret scroll inheritance of Bai Lingxian is so attractive that this person can’t help it.

At this time, as he walked over, a white Divine Mark barrier suddenly appeared in front of him.

Sure enough, there are traps!

Seeing such a scene, Ye Yu and Zhao Laosan couldn’t help but exclaimed in their hearts.

The surrounding warriors were also startled at this time.

They had seen the horror of these divine marks before, but when they suddenly saw the appearance of this huge barrier of divine marks, they instinctively took a few steps back.

But this God warrior who walked over stretched out his hand at this time and the source strength in his hand was released.

The source strength released from his hand seemed to be integrated into the divine mark barrier that was blocking the front.

Soon, Lin Xiu was able to see clearly that the man directly crossed the divine marks barrier and walked to the front!

This guy is a real Divine Marker.

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, his eyes narrowed slightly.

The expressions in Zhao Laosan and Ye Yu’s eyes also changed greatly at this time.

They didn’t act just now because they wanted these warriors to be the scapegoats and go up to trigger some traps.

But what they didn’t expect was that this man turned out to be a Divine Marker and had kept himself hidden.

“Hahaha, Bai Lingxian’s inheritance, I’ll take it then!”

At this moment, the man burst out laughing.

“Damn!”

Ye Yu couldn’t hold back his anger at this time, he shouted angrily, holding a golden long sword, he charged straight ahead!

boom–

But at the moment he rushed over, the divine mark barrier suddenly burst into light.

His body, at this time, was bounced back directly because of the divine mark Barrier.

He hit the ground hard.

pfft—

The powerful impact made Ye Yu spit out a mouthful of blood.

“Hehe.”

The man looked at this scene and suddenly showed a strange smile.

In the next moment, he stretched out his hand and was about to grab the secret scroll held by the statue of Bai Lingxian in both hands.

But just when his hand touched the scroll, the statue of Bai Lingxian suddenly emitted a faint light.

A huge divine mark appeared from the statue in an instant.

This divine mark was different from the divine marks he had seen before. It was a huge human-shaped divine mark!

“This… what is this…”

The expression in this Divine Marker’s eyes changed greatly when he saw this scene.

It was the first time he had seen such a divine mark after spending so much time studying and cultivating divine marks for so long.

In his memory, there was no information about this divine mark.

But now he didn’t hesitate at all, the hand full of source strength touched this giant with divine marks and wanted to decipher it.

But at this moment, the fist of the giant soul warrior attacked his body!

Boom—

With a loud noise, the man’s body was directly smashed into meat sauce by the giant with divine marks.

Blood spurted out in an instant.

“This… what is this…”

The surrounding warriors couldn’t help trembling when they looked at the giant with divine marks.

The Divine Marker just now thought that he had absolute certainty of obtaining that thing, but he did not expect that he would be killed so easily.

However, at this time, the giant with divine marks did not move.

“Break this divine mark barrier for me first!”

Ye Yu stood up at this time, wiped the blood from his lips and said angrily to Lin Xiu.

As he was bounced off by the divine mark barrier, now he is a little embarrassed and angry.

“Did you hear me, break this divine mark barrier for me!!!”

In anger, Ye Yu pointed at Lin Xiu’s forehead with the golden long sword in his hand.

“En.”

Lin Xiu said without the slightest expression on his face.

“Humph!”

Ye Yu heard his words, snorted coldly at this moment and withdrew the golden long sword.

Lin Xiu walked in front of the divine mark barrier at this time.

At this time, with the triggering of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, his right hand suddenly gathered source strength.

Under the inspection of the Analytic eye, it was not difficult to crack this divine mark barrier.

It’s just that this divine mark barrier was relatively large and it takes a little longer.

Zhao Laosan also stared at Lin Xiu at this time. If Lin Xiu, like the Divine Marker just now, wanted to take the scroll, he would directly kill Lin Xiu.

Time passed quickly and the divine mark barrier that was blocking the front had disappeared at this moment!
