Chapter 311: Strange Lake

Bang-

A giant boulder fell straight down onto Lin Xiu.

But he reacted quick enough and held the boulder with both hands.

Despite that, more boulders continued to roll.

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted as he opened his eyes wide at the scene.

He released the boulder and pounced to the side.

Rumble-

Following a loud sound, all the boulders fell.

“Someone must have discovered the Ice Lotus Fire.” Hua Tian stood in the distance and said while looking up.

While saying that, he looked at Lin Xiu with a hint of shock in his eyes.

Lin Xiu relied on his own intelligence to make the unicorn terror beast fall to its death. This had surprised him slightly.

“Brat, your mind is rather good.” Hua Tian nodded his head and secretly praised Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s expression barely changed when he heard about the appearance of the Ice Lotus Fire.

The only question on his mind was if Luo Yue was on top?

“Let’s go.” After thinking for a moment, he nodded his head.

The unicorn terror beast was dead below and no one would take the horn.

After all, their goal was to seize the Ice Lotus Fire that was worth cities!

Lin Xiu and Hua Tian charged upwards. The duo moved extremely quickly and ran without stopping and quickly saw many figures ahead of them.

‘Why are they not snatching the Ice Lotus Fire!?’

Lin Xiu thought that the appearance of the Ice Lotus Fire would trigger a massacre, but who would have thought that everyone would stand by the side and not do anything.

Hua Tian’s expression changed and they continued to walk ahead.

After taking a look, he realized that they had surrounded a lake!

Lin Xiu was equally surprised, he originally thought that the Ice Lotus Fire would appear at the peak, but who would have thought that it would be a lake instead!

The lake was cyan in color and resembled a mirror that reflected the sky.

Bang-

A man threw a rock into the lake and produced a sonorous sound.

At this time, the rock did not submerge but instead produced grumbling sounds as white smoke came out and combusted the rock.

Lin Xiu widened his eyes. That’s crazy, the lake water looks so beautiful but it is actually so terrifying.

“That’s right, the energy undulation in the lake has reached its pinnacle. If I’m not wrong, the Ice Lotus Fire is definitely below!” One of the men cast his eyes downwards and commented while utilizing an apparatus in his hand.

All the warriors knew that but the lake was too powerful and no one dared to go in.

Whoever did would die!

Hua Tian looked at the water and frowned.

Aside from the Ice Lotus Fire, nothing would be able to produce such powerful energy undulations.

After carefully taking a look, there were many warriors that sat by the lakeside. They had discovered that the Ice Lotus Fire was inside, but they had no way in and sat there for a long time.

“Oh? Another youth? You people don’t know how to cherish your lives.”

As Lin Xiu got closer, a warrior seated at the lakeside looked at him and commented.

Lin Xiu heard but ignored him and maintained his focus on the lake.

If the Ice Lotus Fire was in here, no one else had any idea to snatch it.

“Zeze, there was a girl about your age that came here and did not speak just like you. But she is already down there.” The middle-aged man saw that Lin Xiu was ignoring and his expression turned sinister as he added.

As his words came out, Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted. He tightened his grip on Dark Edge and aimed it straight at the man.

“Brat, you dare hold a weapon against me?” The man saw Lin Xiu’s reaction and was so mad that he laughed out loud.

Just as he was about to make a move, a loud sound came out.

Rumble-

The ground around them started to tremble at the same time.

Some warriors were caught off guard and almost fell.

“What the hell is going on!?”

A few warriors started to panic as the trembling was extremely strange.

“Look at the surface of the lake!”

A few warriors suddenly pointed at the lake and shouted as though they had discovered something.

The other warriors looked at the lake to see things squirming from within.

It was as though there was something inside that wanted to charge out of the lake!

A warrior at the lakeside watched as something white shot out from the lake like an arrow

It flew onto the warrior.

“Damn!”

He reacted extremely quickly and grabbed the object.

He took a look and realized that it was a half-frozen snake!

Bang-

The snake suddenly exploded in his hand.

Following the explosion, pale green liquid poured out and landed on his body.

“AHHH!!!!”

He wailed out loud as the look in his eyes changed.

Everyone turned to look at him and saw that he was combusting and emitting white smoke!

There was a faint green fire on him. Although it was not a gorgeous fire, the might of it was strangely terrifying.

The warrior started to roll on the ground as the flames burned his entire body and revealed his bones.

Sou sou sou-

Just when everyone was shocked, sounds came out from inside the lake again!

Everyone could no longer care about the person because there were obviously many strange ice snakes charging at them from beneath the water!
