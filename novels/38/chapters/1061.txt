Chapter 1062: Murdering for the Treasure

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The White Lotus Flame seemed devilish.

This flame was indeed strange.

“Hey man, what do you have there?”

Suddenly, there was a voice that appeared from behind Lin Xiu.

Bakk – –

Then, Lin Xiu quickly shifted his position and closed the box.

“Nothing.”

Lin Xiu answered calmly.

“Hey, brother. Why are you being so petty? Why don’t you take it out and let us see what it is?”

This was a young warrior with a ruffian look on his face.

He immediately sat next to Lin Xiu and asked him again.

Then, there were other muscular and tall warriors that walked toward Lin Xiu.

All of them stood around Lin Xiu.

“It looks like this brother has something nice with him. Let’s take a look.”

As the man told the rest of the warriors about it, all of them stared at Lin Xiu with smirks on their faces.

“Brother Bin, what’s wrong?”

The waiter from before noticed the scene and came over as well.

“Nothing. This is none of your business.”

The man addressed as Brother Bin glared at the waiter and spoke to him in a cold voice.

“This is a friend of mine, Brother Bin…”

The waiter hesitated for a short while but decided to stand up for Lin Xiu.

Brother Bin, known as Yuan Bin, was a top-grade respected warrior and he always lingered around in this bar.

The rest of the warriors were top-grade warriors as well. They were strong and powerful which was why no one dared to provoke them.

“I f**king told you to leave. Didn’t you hear me?!”

Yuan Bin was starting to get impatient.

“But…”

“I told you to leave!”

Yuan Bin roared to the waiter and he had already raised his hand toward the waiter.

Then…

Suddenly, he realized that his wrist was being caught by someone else.

When he looked at it, he noticed that it was Lin Xiu.

“Mate you’re going overboard.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he warned Brother Bin.

“Move aside!”

The man’s eyes were stretched wide. Seeing how Lin Xiu had the guts to touch him, he roared even louder.

He quickly stood up and was about to kick Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

Then, there was a large surge of energy that appeared from Lin Xiu’s body.

The man was then thrown far into the distance and landed heavily on one of the tables in the bar.

Boom – –

The table that he landed on instantly broke into pieces because of the impact.

As for the rest of them that surrounded Lin Xiu, the look on their faces changed.

“You asked for it!”

All of them were enraged as they started attacking Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu subconsciously narrowed his eyes when he saw them coming.

By moving both his hands, he managed to throw all of them away into the air.

Boom boom boom – –

As their bodies landed on the ground, it was followed by their painful groans.

The waiter, who was serving Lin Xiu earlier, widened his eyes in disbelief.

He initially thought that Lin Xiu was just an ordinary warrior who had never been to the city. He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be someone so powerful.

He was able to just casually throw them away as if they were garbage.

Yuan Bin, who was the first one that got thrown out, slowly got to his feet and gritted his teeth as he stared at Lin Xiu.

He looked extremely surprised as well.

Just a while ago, he was being thrown into the air by the energy that came from Lin Xiu’s body!

He was feeling ashamed now and he thought that this had only happened because he was being careless.

“All of you get up now! This fella has a strong energy source.”

He screamed to the rest of his men.

Energy source?

After hearing what he said, everyone around looked at Lin Xiu differently.

They were all respected warriors now. It wasn’t easy for them to become a sage warrior.

Unless they got to absorb a strong energy source or continue to accumulate the energy in their bodies and wait for the right timing to break through but this would take a longer time.

The quickest way to do so would be to absorb energy from another source and they would instantly break through and become sage warriors.

Those who were thrown far away earlier, started getting on their feet.

At the same time, they were already holding onto their weapons.

All of them looked at Lin Xiu with murderous intention in their eyes.

“Dude, just hand over the thing and we’re done.”

Yuan Bin stared at Lin Xiu and scoffed.

There were also other warriors that started surrounding Lin Xiu.

The bar that was crowded earlier had lost most of its customers now.

With such powerful warriors about to start a fight, the entire place might be destroyed.

“Such a hassle.”

“If I destroy this place, will I catch the attention of those from the City Lord…?”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

There were lots of sage warriors here in this city. Lin Xiu was not that obnoxious to think that he could single-handedly defeat all of the sage warriors in Bai Di City.

“Hey! Didn’t you hear me? Hand over the thing!”

Yuan Bin glared at Lin Xiu.

Although he only had a peek at it, he could still feel that the thing inside the box had a huge amount of energy.

If he could absorb the energy from the item inside the box, he would definitely be able to break through and become a sage warrior!

There are lots of top-grade respected warriors who have used a lot of time to cultivate energy but they still weren’t able to become sage warriors.

Since he had the chance to meet this item, he had to get his hands on the item that Lin Xiu had.

“Idiots.”

Lin Xiu sneered.

He didn’t think that he would be in such trouble when he just wanted to take a look at the reward he got from the competition.

“You’re dead!!!!!”

Yuan Bin looked incredibly mad when he heard what Lin Xiu said.

“Kill him!”

With that said, all of the warriors started heading toward Lin Xiu!

All of them wanted to kill Lin Xiu in order to get the treasure.

“Hmph!” Lin Xiu scoffed. Before they could touch him, he had released his ‘sphere’!

With the ‘sphere’ released, all of the attacks from Yuan Bin and his men landed on Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’.

Boom booom boom – –

As their weapons hit the ‘sphere’ and touched the dark blue flames, all of their weapons started melting away.

The high temperature coming from it caused all of them to look surprised.

Then, Lin Xiu clenched onto his fist.

There was an eye-blinding, white light that came from his fist.

‘Explosive Strike’!

As Lin Xiu swung his punches, one of the warriors, who was still trying to attack Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’, ended up with his head being exploded into pieces.

Blood splattered everywhere.

Some of the fresh blood and brains got onto the waiter’s face and he was shocked as hell.
