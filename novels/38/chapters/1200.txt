1201 ‘Destroy the Sky’

After Lin Xiu opened the wooden box, Lin Xiu could clearly see that inside the wooden box, there were two cards emitting dark red light.

These are god-level skill cards?

Looking at these two cards, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Taking out one of the skill cards, Lin Xiu could clearly see that it was a boxing skill card.

‘Destroy the sky’.

It sounds like a very domineering boxing skill card.

“Okay…”

Looking at this boxing skill card, Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

After all, it’s a god-level skill card and it’s better than other skill cards that he can’t use.

Looking at the other one, Lin Xiu suddenly had black lines all over his head.

This is a dual-sword type skill card.

It was of no use to Lin Xiu.

If it is pure swordsmanship skill, it would be fine. When the time comes, Luo Yue could use it.

Thinking of Luo Yue, Lin Xiu looked into the distance through the window.

The whole person was slightly dazed.

“Soon, I will find you.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, then said to himself.

Sitting down cross-legged, Lin Xiu put the double sword skill card back into his expansion space.

And Lin Xiu put the other one on his forehead.

He could learn this boxing technique.

After all, the ‘Rupturing Fist’ that he used before was too backward.

Without thinking too much, he closed his eyes and with a thought, this god-level skill card, which originally radiated red light, now radiated even more intense light.

And Lin Xiu also clearly felt that a large amount of skill information was frantically pouring into his mind.

The energy information was so huge that Lin Xiu felt like his head was about to explode.

Damn!

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and absorbed the energy information in the god-level skill card, which made Lin Xiu feel a little uncomfortable.

But Lin Xiu, who has experienced a lot of pain before, could still endure this level of pain.

As Lin Xiu frantically absorbed the information in the skill card, the god-level skill card attached to Lin Xiu’s forehead slowly began to dim.

The energy inside has been gradually absorbed by Lin Xiu a lot.

Slowly, this god-level skill card finally disappeared.

It’s like an ordinary skill card.

Pa–

Lin Xiu also opened his eyes when the skill card fell to the ground.

“Sure enough, it’s formidable.”

Lin Xiu exclaimed at this moment.

After absorbing the skill information, Lin Xiu could clearly feel his strength, as if he had improved a little.

And the information about the ‘Destroy the Sky’ boxing technique attached to this skill card made Lin Xiu feel that this god-level skill card was so powerful.

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu stood up.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Xiu slowly mobilized the source strength of his body according to the information about this ‘Destroy the Sky’ skill card that he had just absorbed.

His right hand was balled tightly at this time.

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu’s fist slowly began to gather light.

The whole fist seemed to have a golden red light.

The outer layer is golden and the inner layer is dark red, which looks extremely weird.

hu—

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and subconsciously blasted towards the outside of the open window!

boom!

With a loud noise, all the surrounding windows were shattered and the space outside became distorted.

The power of this punch was transmitted directly into the air in the distance!

The entire space seemed to collapse soon.

But soon, the distorted space began to slowly return to normal.

“This boxing technique… is amazing…”

Lin Xiu looked at his fist and couldn’t help but muttered to himself in surprise.

In the past, his ‘Rupturing Fist’ or the improved version of ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’ had to attack the warrior’s body before it could damage him.

But this ‘Destroy the Sky’ boxing technique can directly smash the people on the opposite side of the city!

This is too scary!

Lin Xiu gasped.

This thing consumes too much energy and Lin Xiu felt a little out of breath now. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“However, it consumes quite a lot of source strength.”

Lin Xiu said, not sure whether to laugh or cry.

bang bang bang-

At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

“Who?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows and said subconsciously.

“Sir, we heard an explosion just now, did it come from your room…”

“Oh, I’m sorry, I was just cultivating, I’m fine now.”

Hearing the voice of the waiter outside the door, Lin Xiu said.

“OK.”

As Lin Xiu’s words fell, the waiter left.

It seems that they are not surprised by this kind of thing.

After all, the people who come to stay in this hotel are all powerful warriors and some warriors will inevitably have things happen in the process of cultivation.

Lin Xiu took a shower at this time and after changing the clothes inside, looked at Rollie and Xiao Bai who were still asleep on the floor, Lin Xiu lay on the bed and rested.

I was really tired from practicing the ‘Destroying Heaven’ boxing technique just now.

Soon it was afternoon. After Lin Xiu opened his eyes and got up from the bed, he found that Xiao Bai and Rollie were still in a deep sleep.

But what surprised Lin Xiu was that their bodies seemed to have obviously changed.

Rollie’s hair became thicker and Xiaobai’s ice-crystal feathers seemed to emit a faint purple light.

The whole body has also become beautiful.

“Could it be that they are evolving?”

Lin Xiu looked at this scene and said to himself.

The beast god-level odd crystal they swallowed indeed contained very powerful energy. It is not too strange for them to be like this.

“Where’s Xiaobai and Rollie?”

As soon as Lin Xiu opened his door, he saw Baili Haoling’s figure.

“Still asleep.”

Lin Xiu shrugged helplessly.

“They should have evolved. Ordinary beasts will evolve after reaching a certain level.”

“I don’t know, will they evolve into beast god-level existences!”

Speaking of this, Baili Haoling seemed a little excited.

“The beast god level shouldn’t be that easy.”

Lin Xiu also agreed that it was not that easy.

Dang dang-

And at this moment, a crisp sound came from outside.

The doors of some of the surrounding warriors have also been opened and one after another warriors came out.

“Brother, let’s gather to observe the Divine Soul Engraving!”
