Chapter 866: When Are You And Luo Yue Getting Engaged? (1)

??

“I’m just someone from Huaxia.”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

“Now, can we talk about it?”

Lin Xiu glanced over, the eyes of these people flashed, but without exception, their eyes were full of fear.

From Lin Xiu’s body, there was an extremely terrifying sense of oppression.

Make them feel extremely fearful.

“What do you want... to talk about.”

The general leader of the Warrior Union looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

Lin Xiu’s strength is really too powerful, and now he doesn’t dare to make a move.

This kind of power is definitely not something that warriors on Earth possess.

“The forces of the Warrior Union are not allowed to enter the Huaxia region in the future.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

The current Warrior Union is not the same as it used to be.

A major purge was carried out internally, and many high-level executives were replaced by people from these US regions.

Moreover, this Warrior Union has also become a special force group, and there is a momentum to confront the federal government.

When the general leader of the Warrior Union heard Lin Xiu’s words, the expression in his eyes also flickered.

The Huaxia region is a piece of fat meat -he couldn’t simply give up like this.

“Why, you’re not agreeable to this?”

“Then your warrior Union will just have a change of leader.”

While Lin Xiu said lightly, a translucent matrix suddenly appeared on the body of the general leader of the Warrior Union, directly covering his body.

What is this!?

The surrounding warriors were stunned when they saw this scene.

“Goodbye.”

At the same time as Lin Xiu said lightly, at the next moment, the matrix burst out in an instant.

The general leader of the warrior Union in the matrix was instantly annihilated.

Completely disappeared. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

The warriors around here were dumbfounded.

They never thought that things would develop to this point.

This is really too scary.

Their top leader was killed by this Huaxia man.

They had absolutely no power to fight back.

“Now, I’m your leader, is there a problem?”

Lin Xiu glanced at the people around him and said lightly.

“No problem!”

A man’s body trembled for a while, and then hurriedly said.

“No problem at all for us!”

The rest of the people also quickly spoke up at this time.

This world was a world where the strong were respected, and the strength that Lin Xiu showed was simply too powerful.

Their lives can be said to be in Lin Xiu’s hands right now.

“Now, the first order I give to you guys is to clear my wanted notice.”

“Also, don’t send your people to Huaxia.”

While Lin Xiu said lightly, his figure disappeared into the air in the next moment.

Seeing Lin Xiu disappear, the people around him heaved a sigh of relief.

Lin Xiu’s strength is really too terrifying and too powerful.

With their current strength, there is absolutely no way to fight against Lin Xiu.

“In the future, don’t go to Huaxia.”

A blond man looked at Jin Gang’s corpse next to him, and the place where the man who was blown up to dust was just now and said while trembling.

The feeling of having one foot in hell was really unpleasant.

A week passed quickly.

During this week, Lin Xiu walked back and forth between Luo Family and Sacred Region Academy.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were the best students of the Sacred Region Academy and they took the time to teach there during this week.

“Lin Xiu, when are you going to set the wedding date for you and Luo Yue?”
