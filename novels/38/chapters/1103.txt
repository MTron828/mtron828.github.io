Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

At this time, Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand and continued to release a large number of flaming birds!

Although those Sage warriors reacted fast, there were too many flaming birds and they couldn’t dodge completely. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Soon, the flaming birds covered their bodies.

Even with the ‘Sphere’, the burning sensation of those flames spread to their bodies.

When they wanted to break free from the flames, the source strength of Lin Xiu’s body all converged on the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

With the gathering of source strength, the Dark Edge spear began to tremble.

“Get out of the way!!!”

Bai Tao, who was at the bottom, roared loudly when he saw this scene.

Because he could clearly see the powerful force gathered on the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand, the pupils in his eyes could not help shrinking.

‘Heaven Breaking Strike’!

At this time, Lin Xiu had already swept out the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

An arc-shaped terrifying force swept over directly!

In the surrounding sky, a large number of space cracks appeared in an instant because of the impact of this force.

The ‘Sphere’ of the four Sage warriors was already weaker because of the burning of the flames. At this time, as the terrifying force swept over, their ‘Sphere’ burst directly!

The terrifying power didn’t just destroy their ‘Sphere’.

Their bodies were also directly impacted and shattered into two pieces!

Blood spurted out from the sky at this time.

Experience, it has risen to 25%.

“Continue to send more people.”

Lin Xiu said indifferently to Bai Tao who was below.

“You…you’re dead meat!”

At this time, Bai Tao looked at Lin Xiu in the sky and said with a trembling voice.

The five Sage warriors died just like that!

What kind of power is this to be able to kill all Sage warriors in such a short period of time!

“Trash!”

And at this moment, a loud voice resounded from the sky.

“Master!”

Seeing this scene, Bai Taom was surprised.

Because now there were a large number of warriors in the sky.

And taking lead was Bai Rui, the head of the Bai family in Baidi city.

“You are really trash!”

Bai Rui looked at Bai Tao and said coldly.

“Notify the people from the city lord council to come!”

Bai Tao’s body trembled when Bai Rui saw him like this, then he nodded quickly and went to the other side.

“I have all your information.”

“Descendant of the Ye family?”

Bai Rui was also suspended in the air at this time, looking at Lin Xiu opposite him and said lightly.

At this time, the entire sky was filled with warriors of the Bai family and the scene looked very spectacular.

“Being able to kill so many warriors from my Bai family, it seems that your strength is not bad.”

“However, do you really think that with your strength, you can restore the Ye family?”

Seeing so many people around, Lin Xiu suddenly sneered.

“Who said it was by my strength alone?”

Lin Xiu showed a sneer at this time.

At this moment, there was an explosion in the distance of Baidi City.

Hearing the explosion, the expression in Bai Rui’s eyes changed slightly.

what happened!?

“Master! Master!”

At this time, Bai Tao’s figure flew back again.

“Shut up, what are you panicking about!”

Bai Rui, who was already full of anger, roared out at this time.

“Baidi City… Someone is attacking Baidi City!”

Bai Tao, who flew back, said out of breath at this moment.

“what!?”

A look of horror appeared in Bai Rui’s eyes.

There were people attacking Baidi City, are they courting death?

“The city lord council is now leading people to defend against the attack…”

At this moment, the corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched, because this week, he had already notified the forces he had formed before.

Sima Qiang of Wildfire City, Zhao Yongyuan of Zhao Family, Wu Jie of Sand Sea City and Wang Qiang of Tianjiao City, had led many warriors to prepare a few days ago.

Now that all of them were rushing over, they will take down Baidi City in one fell swoop!

And because of the support of the Wu Group, the weapons and aircraft they use are all the latest.

Boom—

At this moment, another huge sound broke out.

The gate of Baidi City was directly smashed by the flying artificial angel.

“Kill him first!”

At this moment, Bai Rui’s face became extremely red with anger as he looked at Lin Xiu and ordered.

boom boom boom —

As soon as his words fell, all the surrounding Bai family warriors released their skills and charged toward Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu looked at this scene, snorted coldly, and used ‘Heavenly Array’ and ‘Fury’ directly.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” also unfolded.

Those forces that filled the sky charged toward Lin Xiu, but Lin Xiu did not suffer any damage.

His “Sphere’ perfectly resisted all those forces.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu sneered and the dark energy ball on his neck trembled.

As Lin Xiu burst out with extreme power, in the next moment, a large amount of dark energy appeared.

A large amount of black energy material burst out from Lin Xiu’s body, then swept towards the surroundings!

When Bai Rui saw these dark energies coming in, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

“Flee!”

The Sage warriors beside him also clearly felt this.

At this time, they all used the movement technique to dodge directly.

But the rest of the warriors didn’t react so quickly.

Those terrifying dark energies swept over in the next moment.

Those warriors had unfolded the ‘Sphere’, but they found that these black energy substances directly penetrated their ‘Sphere’, then covered their bodies.

Those warriors who were penetrated into their bodies by the black energy substance suddenly opened their eyes wide and wanted to struggle madly.

But no matter how hard they struggled, there was no way to get rid of those dark energy substances.

Soon, the bodies of these warriors seemed to be drained and they suddenly became extremely shriveled.

All fell from the sky.

In an instant, a lot of people died.

‘Silence’!?

Bai Rui, who had dodged the impact of those dark substances, was shocked at this time.

So many warriors died in such a short period of time. How powerful is this skill?

What Bai Rui didn’t know was that this ‘Silence’ skill was very powerful and coupled with the energy from the dark attribute energy ball, this skill became even more terrifying!

“The Ye family… as expected, he belongs to the Ye family…!”
