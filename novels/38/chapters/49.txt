Chapter 50: Killing A Rank 3 Warrior

Lin Xiu looked at the man in black and said, “I didn’t think of fleeing.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Under the moonlight, the surrounding place didn’t look too dark.

“I just wanted to find a quiet place to kill you.”

“Arrogant!” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the man in black suddenly exclaimed coldly, then with the sharp daggers in his hands, he charged over to Lin Xiu’s side.

His body was like a dark shadow as he charged, it was really eerie.

Lin Xiu knitted his brows. ‘Could this be a motion-type skill?’

One must know that this kind of skill was very rare and couldn’t be sold in the market as it was one of the rarest skills.

Lin Xiu moved the spear in his hand and jabbed it toward that shadow!

But his speed was too fast and the spear couldn’t strike him. That man in black appeared in front of Lin Xiu, and at this moment, the dagger in his right hand was advancing toward Lin Xiu’s neck.

Lin Xiu’s pupils narrowed in shock, and he instinctively bent his neck back but still felt piercing pain.

A trace of blood oozed out.

Just as the man in black was trying to continue attacking Lin Xiu’s head with the dagger in his left hand, he found that Lin Xiu’s right foot had reached out and kicked his abdomen.

Bang——

The man in black couldn’t dodge in time and was directly sent flying.

But in the air, he did a somersault and landed stably on the ground.

“Tsk tsk, didn’t think that you still had quite a bit of strength, huh.” The man in black laughed strangely, then pulled out his dagger, and licked the blade that was stained with Lin Xiu’s fresh blood.

It was as if he tasted something delicious.

Feeling the blood seeping out of his neck, Lin Xiu’s eyes became colder and colder.

Anger, his heart was filled with anger.

The weak people were doomed to be bullied. If he was still the former Lin Xiu, he would have already died so many times.

His hands grabbed the Silver Immortal Soul spear tightly and he glared at the man in black.

Feeling Lin Xiu’s stare, the man in black knitted his brows. It was as if he was being stared at by a snake which made him very unhappy.

How could he be afraid of Lin Xiu’s murderous look? Impossible!

“Boy, who are you staring at!” At this moment, he couldn’t help but get agitated. That strange dark shadow charged forward again and got close to Lin Xiu at high speed.

Lin Xiu held the spear with both hands and was very calm as he stood at the same spot without moving.

“Go to hell!” The man in black leaped high as he approached Lin Xiu, the daggers in his hands flashing a cold light.

Silver skill- “Falling Petals”!

Immediately, it appeared as if there were many daggers and it was impossible to differentiate the real ones from the illusions.

Under this sort of situation, ordinary people wouldn’t be able to fight them off.

The only way was to avoid all of them.

But if Lin Xiu avoided them, the man could take advantage of this and slit his throat directly by going behind Lin Xiu.

This blow was a fatal trick.

“Torrential storm of rose flowers!” But to the man’s surprise, Lin Xiu did not dodge his daggers and brandished his spear instead.

At this time, Lin Xiu was boiling with rage. The Silver Immortal Soul spear seemed to be able to feel the master’s murderous intent and began shaking.

Bang bang bang——

As Lin Xiu brandished his spear, several sounds of explosion rang out in the air.

The silver spear turned into virtual images, and a cold light flashed from its tip like a dragon emerging out of the sea as it rose up into the sky and struck down at the man in black.

Four strikes in one second!

“You’re courting death!!!” The man’s pupils constricted when he saw this scene and gritted his teeth as he continued his attacks.

But when he saw Lin Xiu’s fearless gaze, he was finally afraid.

This guy must be crazy!

He didn’t want to die. If he died, he wouldn’t have a chance to enjoy life no matter how much money he had!

Bang!

Just the next second, his daggers from both hands pierced into Lin Xiu’s shoulders.

And Lin Xiu’s spear had pierced his cheekbones, going through completely.

“It looks like I’ve won!” The man in black felt the severe pain caused by the broken bone, but as long as he pulled the daggers out of Lin Xiu’s shoulders, his daggers could exhibit its strongest effect at this close range and instantly slit Lin Xiu’s throat!

“Says who?” Lin Xiu looked straight at him and said indifferently.

‘What the!?’

The man in black’s eyes opened wide when he looked down and realized that in addition to being pierced through the cheekbones, there were three other bloody holes in his chest.

“You…” The man in black was in dismay, and blood trickled down the corners of his mouth.

He had not expected that he would lose his life here.

No, it must be because he was afraid of death at the last moment which led to the success of Lin Xiu killing him.

But by this time, it was too late to think any further.

His consciousness dissipated in an instant.

“Ding~~~”

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 3 warrior. You’ve gained 120,000 experience points.”

120,000 experience points? So much…

But at this moment, Lin Xiu suddenly felt that everything in front of him became blurry, and his consciousness gradually became fuzzy.

With a bang, he fell to the ground.

Not sure how long had passed when Lin Xiu smelled the fragrance of meat and slowly began to open his eyes.

The sharp pain in his shoulders reminded him of what happened yesterday.

Oh right, I killed a rank 3 warrior.

“Lin Xiu? You’re awake?”Just then, someone said in surprise.

The sunlight was a little bright, and Lin Xiu squinted his eyes as he saw Li Yi in front of him.

Xu Wen and the other soldiers were brewing a pot of broth on the fire nearby.

His clothes were taken off and replaced with thick white gauze wrapped around his shoulders.

“Are you all right?” The voices of Xu Wen and the others resounded.

Lin Xiu shook his head and sat up slowly.

“Chap, you actually killed Shadow Wu Ji.” Li Yi gave Lin Xiu a thumbs up and spoke with admiration.

“Shadow Wu Ji?” Lin Xiu furrowed his brows, obviously a little confused.

“Shadow Wu Ji was one of the most wanted killers in Xing Yao City!” Li Yi exclaimed excitedly.

“He was a rank 3 warrior. Boy, how did you get rid of him!? Bring his body back and you’ll receive a big bounty!”

Lin Xiu thought of what happened last night. It was very dangerous and if not for that man’s fear of death at the last moment, Lin Xiu might have lost his life there.
