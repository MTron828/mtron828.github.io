Chapter 461: Battle with the Furious Black Whale

Take a closer look, above his head, that rank 8 furious black whale appeared!

And the surrounding evolved beasts wanted to attack it but were flung out by its tail.

Its mouth was wide open, revealing two rows of teeth that were very sharp.

A pair of scary red eyes was staring at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened as he watched this scene, this whale was actually… staring at him!?

Lin Xiu has only one thought now, that is…Run!

At this moment, the furious black whale seemed to know that Lin Xiu wanted to escape and rushed directly to him!

Its speed in the sea was so fast, it rushed to Lin Xiu in an instant!

Damn!

Lin Xiu cursed, then rushed to the side where there was a large number of seamounts!

But the furious black whale seemed to have no intention to stop at all and its huge head directly slammed into the seamounts on the bottom of the sea.

Bang bang bang——

A lot of rocks on the seabed fell because of its collision.

Lin Xiu, who swam to the other side, turned around abruptly and saw the furious black whale, biting his body with his mouth wide open!

Oops!

Bang–

At this very moment, Lin Xiu gathered all his strength and there was a light blue circular barrier protecting Lin Xiu’s body.

The furious black whale’s teeth were about to crush Lin Xiu but now because of the appearance of the Sphere, its two rows of sharp teeth were biting on the Sphere instead.

Damn…

Seeing this thrilling scene, Lin Xiu felt scared for a moment.

There were sharp jagged teeth on the upper and lower jaws. If it weren’t for the ‘Sphere’, he would really be killed by this furious black whale.

The furious black whale used an insane amount of force and tried to bite Lin Xiu into pieces.

But this ‘Sphere’ was really too strong, it was like biting a huge steel ball, it couldn’t bite through at all.

Bang–

At the next moment, Lin Xiu was thrown out with a sudden force and hit the rock behind.

Although there was the ‘Sphere’, Lin Xiu was not seriously injured, but because of the strong impact, Lin Xiu felt a sharp pain in his body.

He couldn’t maintain the ‘Sphere’.

The furious black whale seemed to know all of this and ignored the evolved beasts that were attacking it, then continued to rush towards Lin Xiu!

The Furious Black Whale opened its mouth wide with two rows of sharp jagged teeth and was about to bite Lin Xiu’s body again!

Damn it!

Lin Xiu saw this scene and knew that with the reaction speed he had now, it was too late to dodge.

Without any hesitation at this time, Lin Xiu directly used the ‘Fury’ skill!

‘Fury’ As soon as he used the skill, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the strength of his body increase exponentially.

Even in the sea, Lin Xiu dodged like a fish.

Bang–

The furious black whale hit the spot where Lin Xiu was just now.

Those huge and sharp teeth directly bit off the seamount.

Bang–

But it seemed to know that it didn’t bite Lin Xiu. At this time, it spat out the rock in its mouth and looked at the other side with those huge scary eyes.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” on his body unfolded again. If you look closely at this time, you can find that there were many electric arcs on the “Sphere”.

Lin Xiu took the sharp dagger and looked at the furious black whale that opened his mouth like it was preparing to charge up his energy and smash into him again.

The furious black whale roared, then shook its tail abruptly and continued to rush towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu did not dodge again this time and directly activated the system skill ‘Heavenly Array’!

The entire ocean floor, at this moment, seemed to be covered with silver light.

The furious black whale that had rushed over at an extremely fast speed seemed to have been suppressed in some way. At this moment, its speed also slowed down a bit.

Lin Xiu jumped back and the furious black whale bit into the rock on the ground.

At this time, Lin Xiu had already leaped to the back of its body.

The back of this furious black whale has many sharp spikes. If you are not careful, you will be stabbed by these spikes.

Lin Xiu, who was standing on its back, did not hesitate at this time, holding the dagger in his hand, he pierced it directly!

Lin Xiu’s source strength has already covered the dagger and coupled with the sharpness of the dagger itself, at this instant, it directly pierced its hard skin and plunged directly into its back.

Some light blue blood came out.

The blood of these alien creatures was different from the evolved beasts in this ocean, they had blue blood.

Lin Xiu had discovered this before.

Roar–

It seemed to feel the sharp pain coming from its back and the furious black whale roared frantically at this moment.

The whole body was shaking as if he wanted to toss Lin Xiu away from its back.

But Lin Xiu reacted very quickly and grabbed the spike on its back with one hand.

Although the spikes were sharp, fortunately, Lin Xiu wore the gloves, ‘Scarlet Moon’, that he won from the previous lottery, so his hand did not suffer any injuries.

While the furious black whale wanted to toss Lin Xiu’s body away, Lin Xiu firmly grasped the spikes behind it with one hand to prevent his body from flying out, while the other hand had already stabbed it. He then dragged the dagger and made a deep cut on its back.

Roar–

But he didn’t expect that the furious black whale’s reaction would be so violent. At this time, the whole body shook frantically, then its back hit the rock behind!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted, then he directly drew the dagger out and quickly fled.

Bang–

Its huge back hit the seamount behind, making a huge noise.

There was a large amount of silt flying around in an instant, all of it was scattered and the furious black whale could not be seen for a while.

Just when Lin Xiu was about to prepare for the next action, he felt a chill down his back as if something was staring at him.

He turned around quickly and before he could react, his eyes fell into darkness for an instant.
