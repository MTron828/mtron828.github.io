Chapter 961: Wang Qiang’s Battle

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

At this time, with the sound of the broadcast, Lin Xiu and Wang Qiang looked to the other side.

In the central area ahead, a huge competition platform has been built.

This competition platform was made of special metal, which was said to be unmatched in hardness.

Around this huge competition stage, there were many smaller competition stages.

100 teams had to be screened and the finals would be held on the competition platform in the center.

!!

Lin Xiu and Wang Qiang found their competition venue in front of the projected computer and rushed over there.

“Number 1300, Lin Xiu, Wang Qiang!”

It didn’t take long before they heard the names read out by the referee on the platform there.

“Let’s go.”

When Lin Xiu heard the referee’s words, he walked directly to the stage.

“En.”

Wang Qiang nodded.

His body was still trembling slightly, he was a little nervous.

“Don’t be nervous.”

Lin Xiu clearly sensed Wang Qiang’s nervousness and said aloud at this time.

“Yes, Master.”

Wang Qiang nodded, then took a deep breath.

“Number 1310, Zhang Zhijun, Lin Qiang.”

At this time, the opponent also began to play.

“It’s you guys!?”

Wang Qiang looked at the two warriors standing opposite him and the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

“What? You know them?”

Lin Xiu said curiously.

“En, there is a bit of a grudge.”

Wang Qiang nodded.

“Hahaha, Wang Qiang, it’s you trash!”

Zhang Zhijun looked at Wang Qiang and laughed loudly.

As if Wang Qiang was a very funny joke.

“You’re also participating in the Tianjiao competition? Don’t embarrass yourself.”

“Exactly, have you forgotten the scene of being beaten up by us before?”

Lin Qiang also said with a smile at this time.

Wang Qiang ignored the words of the two men and the spear in his hand clenched tightly at this moment.

“By the way, don’t you use swords? Why are you using this broken spear instead?”

Zhang Zhijun glanced at Wang Qiang, then continued to speak in mocking words.

At this moment, Wang Qiang clenched the barrel of the spear with both hands and there was anger in his eyes.

After the Wang family went bankrupt, he has indeed suffered a lot of bullying. These two people were also one of the people who bullied him.

“These two bullied you before?”

Lin Xiu could see what was going on at a glance and said lightly at this time.

“En.”

Wang Qiang nodded slightly.

“I have embarrassed you, Master.”

“This battle, you will deal with it.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

With his current strength, it would only take a matter of seconds to kill these two.

For this kind of rogue, Lin Xiu didn’t even want to do it.

Their levels were too different.

“Sure.”

Wang Qiang nodded.

“Wang Qiang, didn’t see you for a while and your self-confidence has really risen again.”

Zhang Zhijun sneered at this time.

“Don’t talk nonsense, we’ll just abolish him on this stage.”

At this moment, Lin Qiang looked at Wang Qiang, his eyes were sinister.

In this Tianjiao competition, unless the opponent admits defeat, it doesn’t matter whether you live or die.

In other words, even if they killed Wang Qiang, there would be no consequences.

“Begin!”

At the same time, the referee’s voice also came over!

As soon as he finished speaking, Zhang Zhijun and Lin Qiang, holding the long swords in their hands respectively, attacked Wang Qiang!

Lin Xiu over there has been ignored by them.

Because Lin Xiu looked so bland, like a very ordinary warrior.

Unremarkable.

From their point of view, he was just someone who came to make up the number of people.

Dang dang-

At this time, as they attacked Wang Qiang’s side, the sound of metal collisions continued to burst out.

Although their attack was ferocious, they were completely blocked by Wang Qiang.

Since this month’s devil training, Wang Qiang’s strength has also grown rapidly.

“Torrential storm of rose flowers!”

Moreover, when resisting their attacks, Wang Qiang also seized every opportunity he had. The spear in his hand stabbed out and a large number of spear shadows erupted immediately!

Although his use of this skill still couldn’t be as exaggerated as Lin Xiu, but it was still very powerful.

Looking at the countless spear shadows, the expressions in Zhang Zhijun’s and Lin Qiang’s eyes changed greatly.

Quickly unfolded their ‘Sphere’.

Although their reaction speed was already very fast, one or two shots still stabbed them in the body.

There was blood immediately.

“It’s impossible…it’s impossible…”

Zhang Zhijun looked at the wound on his shoulder and his body trembled involuntarily.

He knows Wang Qiang’s strength.

Wang Qiang was clearly beneath him and his swordsmanship was also very weak before.

How could he be able to switch to spears in just over a month and his strength has grown so much!?

Before he could react, Wang Qiang continued to attack with the spear in his hand!

Dangdang-

The speed of the spear was extremely swift.

Every blow was full of majestic power.

Zhang Zhijun and Lin Qiang wanted to attack and kill Wang Qiang directly.

They didn’t expect it at all and now the situation has completely turned around.

“Domain!”

At this time, they kept retreating to resist Wang Qiang’s attack.

Finally they couldn’t bear it anymore.

“En?”

Seeing that the two wanted to use their domain power, Lin Xiu, who was sitting on the ground drinking water and watching the battle, immediately raised his brows.

Snapped–

As Lin Xiu snapped his fingers, a white light burst out.

Instantly covered all their domain power.

“My domain…”

Originally, they wanted to rely on their domain power to counterattack Wang Qiang.

But they never thought that their domain power would disappear directly at this moment!?

He did it!?

Zhang Zhijun and Lin Qiang both looked at Lin Xiu, who was sitting on the ground over there, who seemed to be useless.

“Your opponent is here!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At this time, Wang Qiang’s figure also rushed towards the other side.

Wang Qiang held the spear in his hand and waved it frantically.

Dang dang-

It was too late for the two of them to think about whether the disappearance of their domain was caused by Lin Xiu.

“Wang Qiang! Wang Qiang, calm down!”

Zhang Zhijun was already panicking at this time.

Wang Qiang was like a bull, constantly attacking.

The offensive was so violent that they were already a little bit overwhelmed!

Although they had already unfolded the “Sphere”, under Wang Qiang’s terrifying attack, their “Sphere” was constantly shaking.

Wang Qiang’s eyes were bloodshot and he didn’t listen at all.

The spear in his hand continued to wave.

With every blow, there was a whooshing sound in the air!

This is the power of [Overlord Spear Art]!
