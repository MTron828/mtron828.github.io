Chapter 903: White and Black Troops

Phew–

After some time, Lin Xiu slowly opened his eyes.

“Sure enough, it’s a purple-gold-level skill, so it should be pretty good.”

Lin Xiu mumbled to himself.

After looking at the time, then looking at the distance on the map, Lin Xiu sat on the android battle horse and continued to advance towards Wildfire City.

“Zhao Lin, do you think it is a blessing or a curse for us this time…”

At the same time, at the Zhao family’s side, Zhao Qi and Zhao Lin were standing somewhere.

Hearing his father’s words, Zhao Qi was silent.

“I think this is an opportunity.”

Zhao Lin was silent for a while, then spoke up.

“An opportunity?”

Zhao Qi turned to look at his son.

“Well, the Zhao family has now reached a bottleneck in the development of Aoshuang City. If they want to continue to develop, they can only develop their power in other cities.”

“The forces in other cities will definitely not allow us to enter.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“And I have a feeling that Lin Xiu may really lead us to glory.”

Speaking of this, Zhao Lin seemed a little excited.

The overthrow of the Bai family will endure forever and the Zhao family will also develop rapidly.

But if it fails...

“Danger and opportunity coexist. Since we have chosen, we can only go all out this time.”

Zhao Qi also had a touch of blood in his eyes at this time.

What they didn’t know was that it was their decision that laid the foundation for the future growth of the Zhao family.

And for the past two days, Lin Xiu has been driving towards Lin Xiu on this android horse.

In the evening of the second day, Lin Xiu saw from a distance a city full of lights that seemed like daylight.

“Is this the Wildfire City...”

Lin Xiu looked at the scene over there from a distance, then said to himself.

“Kill them!”

And at this moment, there were a series of footsteps and shouts from the front.

Taking a closer look, some warriors in black clothes are madly chasing down some warriors in white clothes.

There were many warriors in black clothes and they quickly killed those warriors in white clothes.

“Go! Let’s go!”

The remaining few white-clothed warriors just ran in the direction of Lin Xiu.

“Where to go!”

But the number of those black-clothed warriors was too many and soon, an encirclement was formed and they were quickly surrounded.

“Yo? Is this kid your rescuer?”

Some black-clothed warriors looked at those white-clothed warriors who just ran to Lin Xiu’s side and suddenly showed a strange smile.

“I’m not.”

Lin Xiu said indifferently, then drove the android horse to the other side.

At this time, Lin Xiu also felt a little helpless, how did he suddenly get involved in this battle.

“Trying to flee huh!”

One of the men in black saw this scene, holding a sword in his hand, he jumped and was about to slash at Lin Xiu who was riding on the horse!

boom–

At this moment, Lin Xiu, who was on the battle horse, directly waved his right hand and slapped the sword and it flew out!

The other hand directly grabbed his neck and lifted his body up in the air.

“you...”

The man’s eyes widened and he wanted to say something, but as Lin Xiu exerted a little force, he couldn’t say anything.

Ka la——

A crisp sound sounded and the neck of the man in black was directly twisted by Lin Xiu!

“Congratulations Master, you successfully killed a king-level warrior and gained experience 4643467...”

There was also a system prompt in his mind.

The surrounding black-clothed warriors, as well as the white-clothed warriors, all opened their eyes wide at this time.

Their eyes were full of disbelief.

Because Lin Xiu had just killed a King warrior-level warrior, it was as simple as pinching an ant to death.

“Brother, please save us!”

One of the white-clothed warriors responded quickly and said.

“As long as you save us, our white-clothed troop will definitely be grateful!”

A warrior who seemed to be older, also hurriedly said at this time.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes when he heard their words.

He just came to this Wildfire City and didn’t know what happened.

However, the fact that these black-clothed warriors wanted to kill him made Lin Xiu a little uncomfortable.

“Kill him!!!”

The faces of those black-clothed warriors changed slightly at this time.

One of them, who seemed to be the leader, suddenly roared loudly.

They didn’t believe that with so many people, there was no way to deal Lin Xiu and the others.

boom boom boom —

But just as they rushed over, a lot of lightning burst out from Lin Xiu’s body.

These terrifying electric lights attacked the black-clothed warriors who were charging directly!

Some of the black-clothed warriors who responded quickly all unfolded their ‘Sphere’ at this time.

bang bang bang-

But this lightning was so terrifying, even if they unfolded the ‘Sphere’, the thick and terrifying lightning went straight through their ‘Sphere’ and hit their bodies instantly.

“what!!!”

Wailings and screamings kept coming.

All of these black-clothed warriors were struck by lightning, their bodies twitched and they fell to the ground.

The body of the relatively weak black-clothed warrior was instantly electrocuted and fell to the ground.

And the slightly stronger black-clothed warrior still fell on the ground and kept twitching.

There was even white foam spitting out from the lips.

His eyes were white and he seemed to be dying soon.

In Lin Xiu’s mind, there were a lot of system prompts of experience gained.

However, Lin Xiu didn’t pay much attention to them.

Now, the experience gained by killing warriors of the King warrior level is really too little.

His goal is to kill a warrior at the level of Respected warrior.

At this moment, the eyes of the white-clothed warriors around Lin Xiu widened.

Their bodies seemed to be frozen, standing there motionless.

The strength that Lin Xiu showed just now is really terrifying.

Because most of these black-clothed warriors are at the level of king warrior.

They were all dealt with so easily?

This is too incredible!

“Thank you brother for helping us!”

A warrior in white hurriedly said.

The rest of the white-clothed warriors also reacted and quickly expressed their gratitude to Lin Xiu.

“Reward.”

Lin Xiu waved his hand, then said lightly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, these people were startled.

They didn’t seem to expect that Lin Xiu would say so directly.

“Benefactor, you have saved us and we will naturally pay for it.”

A warrior who looked older said respectfully at this time.

“We would like to invite you to come back to the headquarters of the White Troop with us. We will definitely reward you.”

The other warriors looked at Lin Xiu and nodded.
