“Divine energy?”

Lin Xui frowned when he heard what Luo Huatian mentioned.

“You have become so much more powerful than before.”

Hua Luotian looked at Lin Xiu in disbelief.

Previously, Lin Xiu was so weak that he had looked down on Lin Xiu.

!!

He didn’t think that the next time they met, Lin Xiu would turn into a totally different person.

He was incredibly powerful.

“Let me try. Maybe I can get rid of the divine energy in your body.”

Lin Xiu looked at the mark that was on Luo Huatian’s arm.

“You won’t be able to get rid of it. It’s the divine energy of a God King.”

Luo Huatian let out a bitter laugh when he heard what Lin Xiu said.

The strength of the mark of a divine energy is powerful. No one would be able to get rid of it.

Only the God King itself would be able to remove them.

It was impossible.

“Not necessary.”

Lin Xiu spoke in a calm tone.

Then, as he gathered his thoughts, black particles started appearing all over Lin Xiu’s body.

All of the black particles then gathered together to form his divine spirit, the black dragon.

He could no longer call it the little black dragon because it was no longer little.

“This…”

Seeing the black dragon that appeared before him, Luo Huatian was beyond shocked.

“Xiao Hei, would you be able to absorb the divine energy away from their body?”

Lin Xiu asked the black dragon that was next to him.

This was why Lin Xiu decided to name it.

Black Dragon stared at Luo Huatian, who was standing in front of him, and opened its mouth. Then, the mark on his body turned into a surge of energy that was absorbed by Xiao Hei!

It happened!

Lin Xiu was surprised as well to see what was happening.

Due to how his divine spirit has the ability to absorb the other divine spirits, Lin Xiu was thinking if there was a possibility that it could absorb the divine energy.

Well, it turns out that his assumption worked.

As the black dragon opened its mouth, most of the divine mark on the other residents of the dark planet were all absorbed.

The body of the black dragon then grew bigger.

“Looks like you’ve absorbed quite a lot of energy.”

Lin Xi was a little caught off guard with how Xiao Hei suddenly became bigger.

“Did….did it really get absorbed?!”

Seeing how the marks had disappeared, Luo Huatian was surprised.

“It disappeared?!”

“It’s really missing!!!”

The rest of the warriors around them were shocked as well.

All of them stared at their hands in awe.

The mark has finally disappeared!

“Hahahahaha! They’re gone!”

The rest of the warriors threw away the tools in their hands and all of them looked excited.

There were even some that started dancing.

“Huatian! All of the divine energy implanted into our bodies has disappeared!”

Some of the warriors rushed over to Luo Huatian to tell him about the news.

Just when they were running over, they saw Lin Xiu with his long spear.

As well as the black dragon that was behind Lin Xiu.

They soon realised that it was Lin Xiu who released those horrifying flames earlier with his spear.

He was the one who killed all of the warriors from the Warrior God Realm.

“It was him who absorbed all of the divine energy from our bodies.”

Luo Huatian told the rest about the news as well.

这些武神眼神盯着林修,然后鞠躬了一下,认真的说道:”谢谢恩人!”They looked at Lin Xiu with gratitude and bowed, “Thank you, saviour!”

“You are the one who saved our lives!”

Soon, there were more and more warriors that gathered around them.

There were so many of them. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Thank you, saviour!”

They knew that it was Lin Xiu and Luo Yue who killed those from the Warrior God Realm and were beyond grateful.

The crowd chanted and cheered loudly.

Lin Xiu laughed awkwardly.

He was only doing so to get rid of those who may become a threat to him.

However, Lin Xiu wouldn’t be that stupid to explain it to them.

“Right…. Why did they come to the Dark Planet?”

Lin Xiu was curious and asked about it.

The rest of the crowd had dispersed and were heading back to Tianbei City.

Most of them lived there.

But, didn’t they say that those from the Warrior God Realm were forcing these people to dig for the ruins?

“It’s for the ruins.”

Luo Huatian told Lin Xiu about what had recently happened on the Dark Planet.

“They said that there used to be a powerful God King who sealed a god-level tool spirit here on this planet.

“This is why they have come here to find it.

“However, after so long , they have not found anything related to it.

“But… they’ve completely drained all of the energy from the core of this planet.”

Then, there was a hateful look that appeared in Luo Huatian’s eyes.

If it wasn’t because he was too weak…

“You are still a sage warrior?”

Lin Xiu easily knew his abilities with the help of the Analytic Eye.

“En. It’s difficult to progress any further.”

The overall conditions here in the Dark Planet weren’t as good as those in the Warrior God Realm.

There were major differences between the two.

This was why there weren’t many warrior gods in the Dark Planet.

“For you.”

Lin Xiu then took out a huge odd crystal from his expansion space.

“This…”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was passing an odd crystal to him, he caught it immediately.

After taking a good look at it, it was a huge blue odd crystal. Even with both hands, it still felt slightly heavy.

The energy coming from the crystals was peculiar and overpowering.

“You should be able to become a warrior god after absorbing it.”

Lin Xiu gave a friendly smile.

This was a beast god odd crystal that he found at the ruins at Tianmen City.

This odd crystal was a powerful one.

However, even if Lin Xiu absorbed it, it wouldn’t help much.

There wouldn’t be much effect.

But, it would work best for Luo Huatian’s current state.

“Don’t you need it?”

Luo Huatian asked subconsciously.

“I don’t need it anymore.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

Then, Luo Huatian gave out a bitter laugh.

Lin Xiu, who used to be weak, had now grown into such a horrifying man.

“I may know something about the legendary ruins found on the Dark Planet.”

Luo Huatian thought about it before telling the other two about it.

“What ruins?”

Lin Xiu was surprised to hear that.

A ruin that even the God Kings want must definitely be interesting.

“The one where it is said to have the ‘tool spirit’.”
