Chapter 1352 - 1352 Living "Vines"

1352 Living “Vines”

At the next moment, the corpse was instantly burned into a pile of black ashes.

The warriors around him all heaved a sigh of relief.

“Only a low-level creature, yet it cost us a God warrior,” said Lu Guangyue, his face becoming unpleasant.

They had only just entered and had already lost a God warrior.

!!

This was quite a blow to the entire team, especially since they were here to hunt the giant beast of the Netherworld Forest, the Netherworld Unicorn.

“Once again, stay alert and don’t kill any creatures that haven’t attacked us,” Lu Guangyue scanned the group and spoke up.

“Otherwise, it won’t be my problem if someone dies.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he continued walking toward the depths of the Netherworld Forest.

Lin Xiu looked ahead and could see that the trees that his flames had just burned didn’t continue burning.

It seemed that the flames had disappeared entirely after burning on the trees for a while.

“These trees have a strong resistance to fire,” Lu Guangyue said, seeing Lin Xiu’s confusion. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“It’s quite unfavorable for fire-attribute warriors like you here.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly, not saying much.

He had only used ordinary Red Lotus Fire just now. If he used Hellfire, he could probably burn these trees down.

As they continued walking, the group became more cautious after the previous incident. They didn’t want to die here.

“Why haven’t we arrived yet?” someone complained to Lu Guangyue after walking for an unknown amount of time in the Netherworld Forest.

“We’re almost there. Don’t speak,” Lu Guangyue said calmly, walking continuously as if he wasn’t tired.

The warriors behind him were a bit resentful, but they didn’t say anything. They had some endurance.

However, the deeper they went, the more something seemed off. The surrounding environment was dark and made the group nervous, afraid that something might happen again.

“Squeak, squeak – there’s something!” a female warrior with good hearing became nervous after hearing something.

“Ignore it,” another warrior beside her said.

The female warrior hesitated for a moment before nodding, and the group continued moving forward.

The trees here became denser and there were many vines. The group’s pace became slower.

“Are we there yet?” Lin Xiu glanced at Lu Guangyue and suddenly spoke up. He felt that something was off.

Lin Xiu also heard those weird sounds.

It was as if something was approaching him and others.

“We should reach soon.”

Lu Guangyue seemed a little uncomfortable.

“What do you mean by reaching soon?”

A warrior at the back frowned when he heard his words.

“Have you never been here before?”

As soon as the warrior’s voice fell, the eyes of the other warriors also looked at this side at the same time.

“There weren’t so many vines previously.”

Lu Guangyue hesitated for a moment, then said.

“Vines?”

The surrounding warriors all looked around.

There were many vines surrounding the black tree trunks around them.

Even on the ground.

“Isn’t it just some vines, why are you so scared?”

Some warriors were a little bit disapproving at this time.

After all, they were all warriors at the level of God warrior, and they have ventured to many places, so they won’t be nervous because of the sudden appearance of a few vines.

“They are alive.”

Lin Xiu frowned at this time.

“Alive?”

When Lu Guangyue heard Lin Xiu’s words, she also stopped and looked at Lin Xiu.

There was a look of incomprehension in his eyes.

“Dude, are you saying that these vines are living things?”

A warrior pointed to the thick and intertwined vines on the ground and said in a puzzled voice.

The rest of the people also looked at the vines on the ground with surprise in their eyes.

One of them, holding a weapon in his hand, was about to stab at the vine under his feet.

“Stop!”

But the man next to him blocked his movements.

At this time, if anything happens at will, it will be a huge blow to everyone.

“Don’t cut it, just walk away.”

Lin Xiu continued to speak.

Just now, after using the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu already clearly knew that these vines are the tentacles of an evolved beast.

It just looks the same as vines.

And under the inspection of the analytic eye, this thing was at the beast god level.

This Netherland is really weird. Although some evolved beasts are not strong, they can do great damage to people.

“Walk.”

Lu Guangyue also agreed with Lin Xiu’s statement. At this time, he went directly to the front and carefully bypassed these weird ‘vines’.

The rest of the warriors followed suit.

But when he just walked into the front, Lin Xiu’s pupils shrank slightly.

Because at the front, a vine penetrated a man’s body, as if sucking his body into a fuck.

The warriors who came from behind looked at the scene in front of them, and their faces became ugly.

“These vines are really alive…”

Lin Xiu was not too surprised.

The trees on the front side were not so dense anymore.

This made Lin Xiu heave a sigh of relief.

Because in those areas just now, the trees are too dense, and it would be in the way when they really fight.

“Reaching soon, everyone be careful.”

After Lu Guangyue arrived at this place, he also took a deep breath, and the look on his face became extremely serious.

His right hand just held the saber tightly.

“Remember, wait for the fight, no one can be timid, otherwise, everyone will die here.”

Lu Guangyue exhorted.

The surrounding warriors also showed a hint of cruelty in their eyes.

At this time, no one would have thought of running away.

“You don’t use a weapon?”

At this time, Sun Wei looked at Lin Xiu and suddenly said.

Lin Xiu smiled, and then waved his fists in front of him.

There were gloves on his hands.

“Close combat is more dangerous.”

Sun Wei smiled and didn’t say much.

Fighters like Lin Xiu who use their fists to fight will suffer a lot when dealing with such terrifying creatures.

At this time, everyone looked at the surrounding environment and moved slowly.

Many skeletons appeared on the surrounding ground and on the trees.

A pair of red eyes then appeared from behind…
