Chapter 1050: Detained in the Dungeon

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

This Sage warrior raised his eyes to see this scene and the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

Originally, just because of the attack of this icicle, his ‘Sphere’ became a little unstable.

At this time, if Lin Xiu continues to attack, it is still very possible that his ‘Sphere’ will be broken directly!

He wanted to dodge, but Lin Xiu was like a phantom and he was instantly impacted.

Lin Xiu’s spear was full of incomparable power.

boom–

At the next moment, as the tip of the spear hit his ‘Sphere’, a loud sound suddenly sounded.

He was slammed directly to the ground that was covered in ice.

Boom—

A hole was instantly created on the entire ground and his body fell to the magma below.

Those magmas did not get frozen.

At this moment, as his body was hit by Lin Xiu and flew into the magma below the ice block, a scream came instantly.

This Sage warrior’s ‘Sphere’ exploded at this time and the body came into contact with the extremely hot magma below and the whole body seemed to be melted.

He roared wildly, struggling to run up.

“Goodbye.”

Lin Xiu sneered when he saw this scene.

As soon as his thoughts were triggered, the ice hole was filled with ice cubes at a speed visible to the naked eye.

The Sage warrior, who wanted to escape at first, was directly blocked below.

No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t escape.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for killing the Sage warrior-level warrior and gaining experience…”

Soon, a system prompt for gaining experience came from his head again.

“what?”

Hearing the sound of the system improving, Lin Xiu subconsciously looked at his experience bar and found that killing this Sage warrior increased his experience by about seven percent.

Although it was less than when he killed the Five Elements Sage warriors, it was quite good for Lin Xiu.

Looking at the space crack that was blocked by his own matrix, Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered and after the matrix disappeared, he flew out directly from the space crack.

“Him, it’s him!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

As soon as Lin Xiu went out, he heard voices from outside.

There was a large number of warriors suspended in the air.

These warriors all held weapons and watched Lin Xiu who came out of the space crack with vigilant eyes.

The strength of these warriors, some were top-level Respected warriors and there were one or two warriors of the Sage warrior level.

On their bodies, they are all wearing uniform battle suits.

Tang Qi and the few warriors he brought were standing on the ground below, while Ji Mei and her two companions were standing on the other side.

On their sides, there are these strangely dressed warriors.

When Jimei and others fought with Tang Qi and it seemed that the hotel was destroyed. There were a lot of cracks on the surrounding ground due to the use of skills.

“Chief Yu, it’s this person who started it!”

Tang Qi looked at Lin Xiu appearing in the air and suddenly said aloud.

Chief?

Hearing Tang Qi’s words, Lin Xiu also raised his brows.

The one Tang Qi spoke to was a Sage warrior-level warrior.

At this time, as Tang Qi’s words just fell, he also looked at Lin Xiu.

He jumped up and flew in front of Lin Xiu.

“According to the regulations of Baidi City, those who cause trouble in the city will be imprisoned in the dungeon for fifteen days. Take them away!”

As soon as he finished speaking, the surrounding warriors surrounded Lin Xiu.

Seemingly afraid that Lin Xiu would resist, these warriors clenched their weapons tightly and looked very cautious.

“Boy, let me tell you, if you dare to resist, you will be the enemy of the entire Baidi City.”

Even a Sage warrior cannot escape death.

This warrior, who Tang Qi called Chief Yu, stared at Lin Xiu and continued to speak.

“I didn’t say I was going to resist.”

Lin Xiu spread his hands helplessly and said.

Everything right now was a little bit beyond Lin Xiu’s expectations.

Because in those cities Lin Xiu were previously, they didn’t care but it seems that fighting here was not allowed.

These warriors should be the subordinates of the City Lord of Bai Di City.

interesting.

“Take them all away!”

As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Xiu, Ji Mei, Tang Qi and others were all taken to the other side.

The so-called dungeon was under a huge building in a barren area in Baidi City.

“be obedient!”

At this time, those warriors held the weapons in their hands and held them around Lin Xiu’s neck.

Lin Xiu didn’t say anything and continued to walk forward.

If Lin Xiu wanted to leave, it would be easy.

But now, Lin Xiu needs to find out all the information about this Bai Di City. If he resists, he will probably become a wanted criminal in the entire city.

At that time, it would be very unfavorable for him to get information.

And it’s not clear how many Sage warriors there are, so it’s better not to startle the snakes.

At this time, the warriors of the City Lord Council continued to press Lin Xiu and the others with the weapons in their hands to the underground passage.

After a while, walking down this underground passage, Lin Xiu arrived at the so-called dungeon.

There are many independent cells around, these cells seem to be made of special metal, extremely hard and there is no way for ordinary warriors to get out.

And here, there is a strange power.

It seems to limit the use of spatial power, preventing someone from leaving with special spatial power.

“interesting.”

Lin Xiu felt all this and became more and more interested.

He wanted to see who created the rules of space in this so-called dungeon.

“Go in!”

Soon, Lin Xiu was placed in one of the cells.

However, this cell is similar to the traditional cell in ancient China, except that the materials used in the building have been replaced with special metals.

Ji Mei and others were assigned to the opposite side of Lin Xiu, while Tang Qi and others were on the other side.

“Be good and you’ll come out after fifteen days.”

One of the warriors who escorted Lin Xiu in said aloud to the crowd, then left directly.

boom–

The exit channel was also locked immediately.

“Lin Xiu, are you alright?”

Ji Mei, who was opposite Lin Xiu, said with concern.

“I’m fine.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

“That’s good.”

Ji Mei nodded.

“In order to maintain the stability of the city, the city lord of Baidi City forbids fighting and destroying buildings in the city. I implicated you just now.”

Ji Mei said it with a bit of remorse.

There were too many warriors in Baidi City and all of them were very powerful, far stronger than those in other small cities.

If these warriors fight, Bai Di City would be easily destroyed, so there was such a rule.

“It’s fine.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Boy, where did he go!”

At this moment, Tang Qi, who was in the cell on the other side, looked at Lin Xiu and shouted angrily.
