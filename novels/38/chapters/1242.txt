1243 Defeating Sha Qiong

Boom boom boom – –

As the tentacles touched Lin Xiu’s body, there was a loud explosion.

It was then followed by soft groans.

It seemed as if these tentacles were unable to penetrate through Lin Xiu’s body!

“This is impossible!!!”

Seeing what was happening before his eyes, Sha Qiong was in disbelief!

At that moment, Lin Xiu was glowing brightly in gold as if he was a Buddha statue made of gold.

This was why the thousands of tentacles that he released had failed in penetrating through Lin Xiu’s body.

Plus, at this moment, the little black dragon returned to Lin Xiu’s body and it started engulfing the dark energy from the tentacles around him!

“Huuuuuu–”

As Lin Xiu saw how the tentacles around him were being absorbed by the little black dragon, he let out a breath of relief.

It was impossible for him to be able to dodge the tentacles. He could only activate the ‘Golden Body of Immortality’ to withstand them.

Veins were popping all over Sha Qiong’s face.

He was furious and he was dying to chop Lin Xiu into pieces.

However, his dark energy was not enough to kill Lin Xiu!

At the same time, the little black dragon that Lin Xiu had was continuously absorbing the dark energy that he had released.

These dark energies weren’t limitless. The more energy the dragon absorbed, the less energy that Sha Qiong had.

The little black dragon had engulfed a large amount of energy and it was now looking much bigger than before.

It was only the size of Lin Xiu’s arm in the beginning but now, the body of it was as thick as a man’s waist and it was longer as well.

The dragon looks much more ferocious than before.

“I want you dead!!!!”

Sha Qiong roared in rage and continued moving both his arms in the air. Then, all of the dark energy transformed into weapons that were headed for Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu was now aware of the abilities of these dark energy and he was able to dodge the attacks coming at him.

Sha Qiong was protected by these energies which was why Lin Xiu couldn’t kill him but if he waited till his dragon had completely absorbed all of the energy that Sha Qiong had, wouldn’t it be a piece of cake to defeat Sha Qiong?

Baili Haoling thought of the same thing as well and she didn’t continue her attacks.

Not only the little dragon was engulfing the energies, even Rollie was doing the same thing.

The little dragon and Rollie were busy engulfing the dark energies.

The thick dark energies that were like a river released by Sha Qiong were starting to disappear.

Slowly but surely, there was a significant decrease in the amount of dark energy around them.

Sha Qiong’s eyes were opened wide. He was trying to control the dragon and Rollie with the dark energy but he soon realised that both these animals were not afraid of these dark energies.

They could even open their mouth wide and engulf all the energy around him!

Xiu– –

Suddenly, there was a bright light that appeared before his eyes and there was a figure standing right in front of him.

It was Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu held onto the long spear with both his arms and aimed at Sha Qiong’s chest!

Sha Qiong’s pupil shrunk uncontrollably. He had once again placed both his arms across his chest, hoping to stop the spear.

“Ahhhhh!!!!”

However, he didn’t have much energy left in his arms. The spear went straight through his arms and Sha Qiong let out a painful cry.

Lin Xiu continued pushing the spear forward, hoping to pierce through his arms and into his chest.

“Stay away from me!!!”

Sha Qiong had a vicious look on his face as he roared in rage.

With the loud roar, he released the remaining dark energy that he had in his body.

Boom —-

From the impact of the burst of energy released, Lin Xiu’s body was pushed far behind.

The long spear was thrown into the distance as well.

Lin Xiu soon managed to steady himself after a few seconds.

Seeing how his long spear was in the air, Lin Xiu quickly caught it with his hands.

“Huhu…”

Sha Qiong was panting as he tried to catch his breath.

The sharp pain coming from his arms caused both his eyes to turn red.

He was injured!!!

His bones have been completely broken!

This was no doubt a huge humiliation to him.

He has already absorbed so much energy from the other warriors but he still couldn’t kill this kid!

...

“Do it!!!”

Lin Xiu, who was blasted away by the impact, wiped off the blood from the corner of his mouth and he screamed at Baili Haoling who was next to him.

The little black dragon had already engulfed most of the dark energy.

So has Rollie.

At this point, there wasn’t much energy left for Sha Qiong to use.

Baili Haoling nodded her head. She quickly moved and like a shadow, she quickly rushed towards Sha Qiong.

Lin Xiu also activated ‘flashing souls’ as he headed for Sha Qiong.

Sha Qiong’s arms were already injured and it was impossible for him to move them. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Then, he felt Baili Haoling who was behind him and noticed that Lin Xiu was right in front of him. He was shocked.

The dark energy around him that was supposed to be protecting him, quickly turned into tentacles and attacked both Baili Haoling and Lin Xiu.

Baili Haoling didn’t notice it and she was injured at the shoulder.

...

But, she didn’t care about the pain. Instead, she drove one of her daggers into Sha Qiong’s stomach!

There was no energy left around Sha Qiong’s body. At this moment, Baili Haoling was able to drive the dagger through him without any resistance!

The intense pain caused an ugly expression on Sha Qiong’s face.

He quickly turned around and grabbed onto Baili Haoling’s neck with his arm.

He has incredible healing powers. His arms that have been injured by Lin Xiu’s spear have already recovered!

Baili Haoling wanted to stab Sha Qiong with her other dagger but she ended up being strangled and that’s when she felt an intense pain around her neck.

Sha Qiong wanted to break Baili Haoling’s neck!

Boom – –

At that instant, the little blalck dragon appeared out of nowhere and started to bite off Sha Qiong’s arms.

Sha Qiong’s eyes were opened wide as he couldn’t believe his eyes.

He wanted to release his ‘sphere’ to protect himself but it was useless.

This was because he saw a long spear that went through his chest.

It was a sharp tip that was shining brightly and there was dark energy around it.

“You…”

Sha Qiong looked at Lin Xiu with his wide eyes. He couldn’t understand how Lin Xiu’s long spear was able to penetrate through his chest!

‘Destroy The Sky!’

Before Sha Qiong had the chance to speak, Lin Xiu quickly let go of the spear in his hands and landed a heavy punch on Sha Qiong’s head!
