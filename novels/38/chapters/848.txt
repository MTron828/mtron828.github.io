Chapter 849: Huang Ying Appeared

Boom boom —

A large number of explosions shook the entire space at this moment.

The bottom instantly turned into a sea of ??fire.

The fire is a dark blue fire.

It’s like purgatory.

“Huang Ying that old dog? Still not coming out?”

Lin Xiu continued provocatively.

This voice was still transmitted by source strength, so almost everyone in Fengyun City heard it.

All the people in Fengyun City went crazy.

Lin Xiu must be the first person in history to scold Huang Ying like this in the imperial city.

“Courting death!”

Those King warriors saw that Lin Xiu was so ‘arrogant’ and couldn’t help but roar and continued to attack Lin Xiu frantically.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and in the next moment, he waved the Dark Edge spear in both hands.

A large number of flaming birds burst out.

At this moment, the surrounding air became distorted.

Coupled with the sea of ??fire in the sky, the temperature of the entire Fengyun City was affected and increased.

When the attacking king warriors saw the dark blue flaming birds that were attacking, their expressions suddenly changed and they hurriedly dodged.

Whoosh whoosh—

But just as they dodged, they found that a large number of matrices appeared in the air.

These matrices blocked their dodging route.

Some king warriors were caught off guard and were directly hit by the flaming birds, which then annihilated them into skeletons and they fell to the ground.

“The fifty-four guards were all killed!?”

When Luo Tian and Luo Jing saw this scene, the expressions on their faces changed greatly.

These fifty-four guards were the strongest actual combat troops under Huang Ying, all of them are top king warriors. Nobody expected that in this short period of time, all these king warriors were killed by Lin Xiu.

“Does he really want to kill the emperor...”

Luo Tian’s body trembled a little at this time.

Not only excited, but also afraid.

The strength that Lin Xiu showed was really terrifying.

The top King warrior was like a child to him.

“enough!”

At this moment, a voice spread throughout Fengyun City.

“Your Majesty is out!”

At this time, the remaining dozen or so King warriors were surprised.

Exit?

Has this guy been in seclusion all the time?

Hearing the words of those King warriors, Lin Xiu thought subconsciously.

“Today, this is your burial place!”

Those warriors of the King warrior level seemed to feel extremely strong confidence and immediately shouted loudly when they looked at Lin Xiu, who was invincible just now.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu let out a cold snort. Now, he doesn’t even care about a warrior of the King warrior level!

With a flash, the long spear directly attacked the remaining King warrior-level warriors!

‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!

A huge black dragon swept away directly.

The dozen or so King warriors were all swallowed and killed by the black dragon within a second.

Boom—

At this moment, a golden light flashed and a source strength transformed into an incomparably huge golden fist, which slammed directly towards Lin Xiu.

Boom—

Although Lin Xiu unfolded the ‘Sphere’, at this moment, he was directly knocked into the air.

The whole body slammed onto the building below and a huge sound erupted.

“Huang Ying... Huang Ying really appeared!?”

Luo Jing looked at the figure on the screen and couldn’t help but be amazed.

What was displayed on the screen was the figure of a middle-aged man.

Just looking at it through the screen like this, I can feel the terrifying sense of oppression.

“It seems that this kid is not a match for the emperor.”

Luo Jing said involuntarily.

“No, look carefully.”

Luo Tian looked relatively calm.

Lin Xiu, who was blasted to the ground at this time, flew up again at some point.

“We meet again.”

Lin Xiu looked at Huang Ying, who was also suspended in the air and said lightly.

“It seems that you are very confident in your current strength.”

Huang Ying stared at Lin Xiu, then said lightly.

“Of course, this time, I’m going to seek revenge on you.”

Lin Xiu thought of the scene when Luo Yue dyed her black hair white and he clenched his hands tightly.

“Although you are the only one on this planet to be promoted to Respected warrior after me, I can tell you that there is a difference between a strong Respected warrior and a weak one.”

Huang Ying clearly felt Lin Xiu’s current strength.

There was no expression on his face, as if he didn’t care what Lin Xiu did just now.

“Then you have to try it to find out.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s body suddenly burst into a white light, the light directly centered on Lin Xiu’s body, then radiated out.

‘Heavenly Array’!

Domain? No, not domains.

When Huang Ying saw this scene, his eyes seemed to be slightly surprised.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s body seemed to teleport and appeared in front of Huang Ying in an instant. The Dark Edge spear in his hand stabbed directly at his body!

‘Profound Intent·Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

The spear stabbed out and instantly turned into thousands of spear shadows.

Whoosh whoosh—

But Huang Ying’s reaction speed was also astonishingly fast, his body turned into a phantom and he dodged directly.

While dodging, a long sword transformed from his source strength appeared in his hand, emitting white light.

The long sword swung directly into the air and a huge shadow of the long sword appeared, slashing directly at Lin Xiu’s body from the air!

Boom—

There seemed to be a loud noise in the air and the surrounding space seemed to be distorted by this blow.

boom–

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in both hands and directly blocked the blow with the body of the spear.

Seeing this scene, Huang Ying frowned slightly.

Lin Xiu was a little stronger than he imagined.

“‘Dragon Sword Prison Break’!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Huang Ying’s whole body’s source strength was mobilized and the whole sky seemed to be surging.

The powerful skills used by Respected warrior-level warriors changed even the sky.

He spread out his hands and the original long sword flew directly into the air.

Whoosh whoosh—

In the next moment, the long sword was divided into thousands.

Moreover, these long swords actually combined into an incomparably huge dragon.

“Go!”

Huang Ying waved his hands and the dragon sword composed of thousands of long swords charged directly toward Lin Xiu!

As the Dragon swords charged away, the surrounding space seemed to have fissured openings.

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes could not help shrinking.

This kind of skill is no longer a purple-gold-level skill, it should be a more powerful skill.

Could this be a sacred skill?

No, it’s impossible, Huang Ying shouldn’t have such a powerful skill.

At this time, the dragon formed from this long sword was about to hit Lin Xiu’s body!
