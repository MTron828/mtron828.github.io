Chapter 153: Kiss Me and I’ll Tell You

“You…” Cheng Yu and another man stared at Lin Xiu angrily.

But thinking about how Lin Xiu just punched Chai Jiuming, the strongest of them, and blasted his entire arm to pieces.

They didn’t dare make a move. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

They regretted it now and didn’t expect this freshman to be so strong.

“What do you want?” Cheng Yu took a deep breath and said indifferently.

“10,000 points.” Lin Xiu said, looking at him now.

“Dream on!!!” Chai Jiuming roared loudly at this moment, tolerating the sharp pain from his arm.

10,000 points take a very long time to accumulate and it could be regarded as a small fortune in Sacred Region Academy.

“10,000 is impossible.” Cheng Yu and another man shook their heads as well.

“10,500.” Lin Xiu said faintly.

“You…!” Cheng Yu and the others gritted their teeth when they heard Lin Xiu’s words.

“No?” Lin Xiu raised his brow, then continued to say: “Then 2…”

“Okay, fine!” Cheng Yu hurriedly said at this moment, then took out his card, and pressed the switch on the side of the card. The middle of the card suddenly became a screen.

There was this function?

Lin Xiu was taken aback, he didn’t know it before.

“What is your ID?” Cheng Yu asked Lin Xiu with a gloomy expression.

“9814126.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

Cheng Yu gritted his teeth in pain as he entered Lin Xiu’s ID number on the screen of this card, and all the accumulated 15,000 points were transferred to Lin Xiu.

“Dididi…”

At this moment, Lin Xiu heard a sound from the information card.

When he took it out, the center of the card turned into a screen and showed that it received 15,000 points, and he had 36,025 points accumulated currently.

“Goodbye.” Lin Xiu nodded and walked to the other side without looking back.

Cheng Yu and others looked at Lin Xiu’s retreating back and showed a sinister look.

Pfff——

As soon as he walked to the corner, Lin Xiu couldn’t help it anymore and he vomited a bit of blood.

Damn, the man just now was a rank 4 warrior after all, and his ‘Divine Ray Fist’ was also very powerful. Fortunately, he added all his points to Strength, otherwise, it would be impossible to beat him just now.

When he returned to the hilltop villa, the lights in the entire villa were on.

Luo Yue seemed to be still practicing her sword techniques and she looked exceptionally focused, her swordsmanship looked very sharp.

Don’t tell me that this girl has been practicing since the time he went out eh?

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but sigh, it seemed that every strong warrior would go through day after day of practice.

When Luo Yue saw that Lin Xiu had returned, she glanced at him then continued practicing.

As she kept practicing, she was a little sweaty. At this moment, her white clothes were slightly stuck to her body and outlined her beautiful figure.

Lin Xiu who saw this scene couldn’t help but swallow his spit secretly.

This chick is quite young, but she has a very good body…

“Would you like to go to dinner?” Lin Xiu asked awkwardly when he saw Luo Yue frowning and seemed to have caught him looking at her.

“It can be delivered to your door.” Luo Yue said lightly.

Delivered to your door? Lin Xiu was taken aback for a moment, then looked on the huge screen on the wall and found that there was really some food delivery service.

But this door-to-door service required an extra 5 points.

For Lin Xiu, who has just earned a large number of points, this was nothing at all.

“What do you want to eat tonight, my treat!” Lin Xiu said proudly at this time.

What he got in return was Luo Yue looking at him like an idiot.

Not long after, a flying robot delivered the food that was ordered.

A total of 100 points were spent on this meal.

“Where did you get so many points?” Luo Yue was eating the food in small bites, she hesitated for a moment before she asked Lin Xiu curiously.

“I’ll tell you as soon as you kiss me.” Lin Xiu said proudly at this time.

As soon as he finished speaking, he found a thin long sword on his neck.

There was a cold aura on the long sword which gave Lin Xiu goosebumps.

“Big sister, I’m just kidding.” Lin Xiu smiled bitterly.

Of all the girls, why did he flirt with this iceberg chick eh?

“Who is your big sister?” Luo Yue said and looked coldly at Lin Xiu.

Any girl would not be pleased to be called “Big sister” and Luo Yue was no exception.

“Alright, alright, alright, my little Yueyue…”

“Get lost!”

After finishing the dinner and taking a rest, Lin Xiu began to practice on the training ground in this hall too.

“Would you like to spar?” Lin Xiu swung his Dark Edge spear at this moment and asked Luo Yue who was not far away.

It was rare that Luo Yue didn’t object. She nodded and immediately rushed towards Lin Xiu with her long sword!

Lin Xiu’s body tensed up at this time and his spear pierced toward Luo Yue’s side!

Dang dang dang——

Luo Yue was no longer injured. At this moment, her speed and strength seemed extremely terrifying.

Lin Xiu was shocked.

The power contained in her slender arm seemed to be much stronger than his!

Although she was also rank 4, she was unlike those second-year rank 4 students just now, she was at a totally different level.

Lin Xiu’s long spear thrust sharply, but it was directly blocked by the long sword in Luo Yue’s hand.

Her long sword looked like thin wings, but its weight was not light.

After Luo Yue blocked Lin Xiu’s blow, she was about to attack Lin Xiu!

Pfff——

Just as he resisted Luo Yue’s attack, Lin Xiu wanted to fight back, but there was a stuffiness in his chest and a mouthful of blood was spat out.

Luo Yue immediately stopped attacking when she saw this and there was a rare expression of concern in her eyes, “Are you injured?”

“En, I fought with a student.” Lin Xiu rubbed his chest and didn’t hide what had happened before.

The impact he received from that punch was not light, he suffered a little internal injury, and he has not fully recovered.

Luo Yue frowned, but didn’t say anything, then walked to the other side and threw a bottle of medicine to Lin Xiu.

“To remove blood stasis and heal wounds, three tablets twice a day.”

“Don’t practice today.”

“I’m not sick, why should I take the medicine.” Lin Xiu curled his lips and said while looking at the bottle of medicine.

“You are sick.” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and said seriously.
