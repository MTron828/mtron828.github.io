Chapter 337: Rank 7

“Your injuries should be fine now, right?” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue as they walked.

“It’s fine.” Luo Yue shook her head. Compared to Lin Xiu, her wound was not as horrible but her ability to recover was not as strong as Lin Xiu’s, so although her wound had closed up, it has not fully healed.

Walking like this, she could still feel a slight pain, but of course, Luo Yue didn’t show it on her face.

Lin Xiu knew Luo Yue’s character and even if she was still in pain, she would not say it.

“We are going back to the academy now, right?” Lin Xiu hesitated for a while as he continued to walk ahead and finally asked Luo Yue.

Previously, Luo Huatian mentioned that Luo Yue’s family wanted Luo Yue to go home. So Lin Xiu didn’t know whether Luo Yue would return to the Sacred region academy or go home.

“En.” However, Luo Yue didn’t say anything and nodded.

Hearing her answer, Lin Xiu didn’t know why but felt quite happy.

“By the way, what rank were you at previously?” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue and asked.

“Rank 7.” Luo Yue said directly without hesitation.

Lin Xiu was surprised when he heard her – rank 7! Luo Yue is so young yet she had the strength of a rank 7 warrior!

And Luo Huatian appeared to be even stronger. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

What kind of freaks are in Luo Yue’s family? Why are they so terrifyinly strong?

“I was attacked by Zhang Jie and some others a year ago and my injuries did not heal.” Luo Yue continued.

Luo Yue seemed to be in a good mood today and said so much – it was quite rare for Lin Xiu.

“When I first met you, you were already rank 7, but because of your injury, your strength has dropped so much.” Lin Xiu said.

“En.”.

The more Lin Xiu thought about it, the more shocked he was. He has been in this world for a while and knew what a rank 7 warrior meant.

A rank 7 warrior was considered a high-ranking warrior, even in a big city, they would be highly regarded.

He didn’t expect that Luo Yue had already reached the level of a rank 7 warrior at such a young age even without an upgrade system like himself.

How much cruel training did she go through…

“What about you?” Luo Yue, who was walking in front, stopped in her tracks, then looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

Luo Yue was very close to Lin Xiu and he could see her beautiful eyes and fair complexion very clearly.

Her skin was very delicate and he couldn’t see any pores on her face at all.

Luo Yue seemed to sense Lin Xiu staring at her and a rare hint of pink surfaced on her cheeks.

She immediately turned around and continued to walk forward.

Lin Xiu returned to his senses at this moment and realized that he had just been staring at her, he suddenly felt a little embarrassed.

*Cough cough* Lin Xiu deliberately coughed, then followed Luo Yue and said to her, “When I met you, I was really just a beginner warrior…”

Lin Xiu said embarrassedly.

At that time, he had just crossed over to the world here and everything was very dangerous for him.

Thinking of the things he had experienced before, the corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth turned up.

Unknowingly, he had already experienced so many things and gone through so much…

“Your strength has increased very quickly.” Luo Yue was a little shocked.

From then to now, in less than a year, Lin Xiu’s strength has improved from a rookie to a rank 5 warrior – this was really terrifying.

Although a rank 5 warrior was nothing to her, the problem was that it took less than a year for Lin Xiu to rise to that level!

You must know that there are many people who couldn’t even reach the level of a rank 5 warrior in their lifetime while Lin Xiu achieved that in just one year.

“It’s alright.” Lin Xiu smiled and didn’t intend to say anything more.

He didn’t plan on telling anyone about the upgrade system.

The two people continued walking side by side and soon they reached the huge gully with Black-tooth spiders in the middle.

“You came from here?” Luo Yue’s eyes saw the ground ahead and it was all charred. It was obvious that Lin Xiu had used his fire skills here.

“En, I came with some sophomores from our school.” Lin Xiu nodded then told Luo Yue what had happened before.

Luo Yue seemed to be listening to Lin Xiu intently.

Although this gully was huge, the two warriors Luo Yue and Lin Xiu could jump directly across to the opposite side with just a short sprint.

The journey back was much easier.

And there are no evolved beasts or warriors along the way.

“Damn! I don’t know who snatched the ice lotus fire but it’s a wasted trip this time.” Lin Xiu and Luo Yue had just arrived at where they first entered the Dark forest and warriors began to appear.

These warriors seemed to have come in looking for the Ice lotus fire, but they have received news that the Ice lotus fire has been snatched and swallowed.

This was really bad news for them. After all, they came for the Ice lotus fire and were going back with nothing.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue walked amongst the crowd and ignored these people.

“Wait, I heard that the Ice lotus fire was swallowed by a young lady.” Some warriors were talking when they saw Luo Yue and Lin Xiu walking by.

As these two people were very young like they were 17 or 18 years old, they stood out from the crowd.

And some warriors also heard some gossip, knowing that it was a young lady who swallowed the Ice lotus fire.

After all, not all the warriors died there – some warriors escaped.

“You mean… maybe it’s them?” Hearing the words of this warrior, the gaze of the other warriors turned to the front.

Looking at Luo Yue’s back, a greedy look appeared in their eyes.

“You two, stop there.” Just as Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were walking, someone yelled from behind.
