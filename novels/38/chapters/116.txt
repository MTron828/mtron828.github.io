Chapter 117: Huge Salt Crystal!

Lin Xiu stared at the giant white fish in front of him, and before it attacked, Lin Xiu directly threw a punch!

In the state of ‘Fury’, Lin Xiu had a dramatic increase in strength. He swung out his ‘Rupturing Fist’ at this moment and there was a surge in strength in his whole hand!

Bang––

Due to the impact of the ‘Rupturing Fist’, although he didn’t directly hit the Giant Turtle Whitefish, it still caused the lake to shake up, and the body of the Giant Turtle Whitefish was sent flying to the back.

Taking advantage of this opportunity, Lin Xiu quickly swam to the other side and found the bones of more and more creatures that he didn’t recognize.

It seemed that all the creatures that could survive in the lake were killed by this Giant Turtle Whitefish.

And every year, there were many unsuspecting warriors in the lake.

When Lin Xiu swam to the other side, he suddenly found a smear of white over there.

‘It’s that Giant Turtle Whitefish again!?’ Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Lin Xiu hesitated slightly and still swam over there to take a look when he saw a white thing in the middle that looked like a lotus.

‘Is this a Salt Crystal!?’

In the photos that Lin Xiu saw online, the Salt Crystal was as small as a flower. If this was the Salt Crystal, wasn’t it a little too big?

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and swam over to take a closer look. He realized that this white thing that was similar to a lotus was actually made up of many small white particles.

It was very clear that this thing must be the Salt Crystal!

Just when Lin Xiu wanted to take it away, a white figure appeared in front of him.

Giant Turtle Whitefish!

This damned thing was flying over again!

Where there was a priceless treasure present, it would certainly have a very strong monster keeping watch. This Giant Turtle Whitefish saw that Lin Xiu wanted to take away the Salt Crystal and was enraged, its huge pincers kept snapping as it rushed to Lin Xiu!

‘Rupturing Fist’! Lin Xiu threw a punch at this moment. He wanted to use the vibration caused by the ‘Rupturing Fist’ to scare the Giant Turtle Whitefish away, but this time, this thing had learned its lesson and dodged his attack. It swam to Lin Xiu’s back then charged toward him!

‘Damn it!’

Lin Xiu was stunned. He couldn’t maneuver freely in water and couldn’t bring his weapon down, if the ‘Rupturing Fist’ didn’t work, he would be in trouble this time.

Lin Xiu didn’t have the time to think so much and quickly swam away to dodge its pincers.

With seven minutes of ‘Fury’ left, time was slipping away. What was he going to do? How could he kill it!?

If he didn’t kill it, he would have no chance of taking that Salt Crystal away with this thing guarding the Salt Crystal.

Watching the Giant Turtle Whitefish continue to charge toward him, Lin Xiu’s body moved like a fish as he swiftly swam. Then, as he continued swimming, he threw a punch toward that Giant Turtle Whitefish’s body!

As Lin Xiu was in the water, the speed of his punch wasn’t fast, but the Giant Turtle Whitefish kept rushing over to chase Lin Xiu and couldn’t react fast enough.

This punch hit the body of this Giant Turtle Whitefish directly!

Bang––

A dull noise resounded in the water.

The Giant fish’s huge body seemed to shake because of Lin Xiu’s punch.

‘It’s dead!?’

Lin Xiu looked at this scene incredulously.

‘No, not yet, I didn’t hear the system’s notification, this thing should still be alive!’

Sure enough, when Lin Xiu wanted to punch again, he found that the body of the Giant Turtle Whitefish shook a bit and in the next moment, it was as if it had come to its senses!

And its eyes reddened and it kept snapping its mouth, he could even see the sharp teeth that lined its upper and lower lips.

Bang––

Its tail shook slightly then it charged toward Lin Xiu at an even faster speed!

‘Damn!’

This time, Lin Xiu was a little flustered. When that ‘Rupturing Fist’ hit its body, it didn’t seem to cause much damage. If he went over again, he would simply be courting death ah!

‘Flee! Flee quickly!’

This was the only idea Lin Xiu had and he swam frantically like a fish.

But the lake was indeed this Giant Turtle Whitefish’s paradise and it swam extremely fast at this moment like it was about to catch up to Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something, and as he swam, he tugged at his combat suit and took it off immediately.

The Giant Turtle Whitefish opened its pincers and wanted to snap Lin Xiu’s body into two. But just then, Lin Xiu’s combat suit blocked its field of vision.

And its giant pincers caught on Lin Xiu’s uniform!

A good chance! Lin Xiu suddenly pulled the combat suit with one hand and threw it above the surface of the water!

The Giant Turtle Whitefish flew straight out of the lake with Lin Xiu’s combat suit!

Tian Zhi, who had been waiting by the lake, was shocked to see Lin Xiu’s combat suit suddenly fly out!

Then, Tian Zhi also saw a huge figure clamping onto Lin Xiu’s combat suit, appearing in the air.

‘What is that!?’

Seeing that pair of huge pincers, Tian Zhi was startled – it was really scary.

‘And where’s Lin Xiu!? What the hell is going on!?’

Bang——

In the next moment, Lin Xiu jumped out.

The second Lin Xiu came up, he saw the Giant Turtle White Fish that he tossed out of the water. It had already let go of Lin Xiu’s combat suit at this moment and tried to return to the lake with its giant pincers.

Seeing this, Lin Xiu was convinced that although the thing looked very scary and was very strong in the water, it was still like the average fish that couldn’t last long without water!

There were still two minutes of ‘Fury’ left and Lin Xiu pounced directly on the Giant Turtle Whitefish that wanted to rush into the Black Salt Lake again!

The Giant Turtle Whitefish seemed to sense that Lin Xiu was pouncing over and it turned around, wanting to pound into Lin Xiu’s body!

“Do you think you’re still a match for me on shore, huh!!!” Lin Xiu roared, pounced over, and spun forcefully in the air. As he dodged the huge pincers, he threw a punch!
