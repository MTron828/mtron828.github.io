Chapter 374: Strike Up A Conversation

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“We can make it,” Luo Yue said indifferently at this time.

Lin Xiu nodded. There is still more than half a year of preparation time.

The star warrior assessment was not an ordinary warrior assessment and there was a large number of applicants but a limited number of places and only a small number of people could take part in it.

These two invitation letters were very important.

The two of them didn’t wait long when a small spacecraft landed on the top of this building.

Both of them walked over and after going through the security scan, they started boarding.

At this moment, not only Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were boarding, but there were also some young warriors, who entered the spacecraft as well.

Lin Xiu knew that these warriors must be just like him and were those warriors who went out to complete a task.

Although the spacecraft was not very big, it was very empty and there were a lot of tables and chairs and a bar.

“We’re finally going back.” Lin Xiu sat on a chair beside a round glass table, then stretched out and said.

Luo Yue gave Lin Xiu a blank look at this time, then took out her mobile phone, looking for some information.

“You look pretty when you’re not icy.” Lin Xiu was glad when he saw Luo Yue giving him a blank look and commented.

From the very first interaction with Luo Yue till now, Lin Xiu rarely saw Luo Yue with any other expressions.

Especially before, she had a poker face all day long and there was no joy, anger, sorrow, or happiness at all.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue glared at Lin Xiu, then continued to look at the information on the phone, ignoring Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu curled his lips and soon as the spacecraft took off, Lin Xiu looked around and found that there seemed to be self-service drinks and drinks on the counter over there.

“Would you like a cup of coffee?” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue.

Luo Yue nodded slightly, still looking at the information on the phone as if she was checking something.

Lin Xiu was also a little curious about what Luo Yue was looking for. Luo Yue looked a little mysterious, which made Lin Xiu even more curious.

He shook his head and went to the bar. After Lin Xiu made two cups of coffee, he held the coffee cups and walked over.

But at this moment, a man sat on the seat next to Luo Yue like he wanted to talk to Luo Yue.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help narrowing his eyes when he saw this.

“Are you also a student of the Sacred Region Academy?” The warrior was wearing a white combat suit and appeared clean and handsome. At this time, he looked at Luo Yue next to him and asked.

From the moment he boarded the plane, he noticed Luo Yue.

It was the first time he saw such a beautiful girl who was exquisite like a porcelain doll.

His heart was itching and finally couldn’t help but come over to strike up a conversation.

Because he knew that if he gave up this opportunity to strike up a conversation, it would not be so easy to meet Luo Yue in the future.

At this time, he looked at Luo Yue while waiting for her reply.

But Luo Yue’s eyes were still staring at the screen of the phone and didn’t look at him at all.

This suddenly made the man a little uncomfortable, but at this time he still smiled and said, “My name is Zhang Liangqian, a sophomore student at the Sacred Region Academy. I just came back from the Deserted City.”

Zhang Liangqian said a little proudly at this time.

Deep Blue City was equivalent to a transfer station. From here, you can reach not only the dark forest but also other more dangerous areas. Therefore, a branch of the Sacred Region Academy was set up here.

The Deserted City was a dangerous area comparable to the Dark Forest. It would be extremely dangerous for ordinary warriors to go there.

But Luo Yue still ignored him at this time which made him frown.

“Did you hear what I said?” Zhang Liangqian said while leaning towards Luo Yue at this time.

Swish——

But just as he was about to approach Luo Yue, he heard a swish. At this moment, a cold light flashed over.

Seeing the sudden cold light, the pupils in Zhang Liang’s shallow eyes constricted.

In the next moment, he found a sharp dagger appear in front of his eyes.

“Get closer and you die.” Luo Yue said indifferently while looking at the phone screen she was holding in her left hand.

Zhang Liangqian was startled at this time. He didn’t expect that Luo Yue, a woman who looked so beautiful, would be so ruthless.

“Hey, she doesn’t like being disturbed. You should go back to your place.” Lin Xiu walked over at this time, then put a cup of coffee in front of Luo Yue, then spoke to Zhang Liangqian.

Zhang Liangqian looked at Lin Xiu who came by and his face became a little nasty.

“You are a freshman, right? Threatening me with a weapon, isn’t it a little too much?” Zhang Liangqian continued sitting on the chair, reluctant to move.

He glanced at Lin Xiu and found that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were both very young, they looked like they were 17 or 18 years old. At first glance, he knew that they were probably the latest batch of freshmen.

“So what?” Lin Xiu said with a smile.

Although there was a smile on his face, Lin Xiu’s tone was obviously unpleasant.

This person suddenly came over uninvited which made Lin Xiu a little unhappy.

“Apologize. I want her to apologize to me.” Zhang Liangqian looked at Luo Yue and said with a cold snort.

He originally wanted to strike up a conversation with Luo Yue, it would be great if the conversation was successful. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But he found Luo Yue’s arrogant attitude intolerable now.

And Lin Xiu’s arrival was like a mockery of him.

“It’s you who should apologize.” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said to him.

“Please return to your original seat.”

Just as Lin Xiu spoke and wanted to pull his chair away, Zhang Liangqian’s expression changed, then he reached out and grabbed Lin Xiu’s wrist.

Swish——

But Lin Xiu’s reaction was very quick and he quickly retracted his right hand.

“Interesting.” Zhang Liangqian saw Lin Xiu’s fast reaction. At this moment, he stood up and threw at fist towards Lin Xiu.

Boom–

The look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed and he did not hesitate to stretch out his fist and threw a punch.

The two fists collided and there was a loud noise.

And at this time, it also caused a shockwave through the air.. The surrounding chairs fell to the ground, but Luo Yue was still looking at her phone screen like it didn’t bother her at all.
