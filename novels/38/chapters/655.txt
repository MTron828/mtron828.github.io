Chapter 656: Smile

Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu sneered and said nothing.

At this time, would he still be afraid of this person’s threat?

“Are you ok?”

At this time, Ouyang Hang and others also jumped onto the competition platform, and then looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“Tm fine.”

Lin Xiu smiled, then shook his head and said.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s face was a little pale, and because of the sequelae of the ‘Fury’ skill, Lin Xiu really looked very weak now.

“Let’s go.”

At this time, Ouyang Hang clearly felt that Lin Xiu’s state was not quite right, so he took the i

“I didn’t expect such a day to come.”

Lin Xiu looked at Ouyang Hang and said with a smile.

Ouyang Hang glared at Lin Xiu, and smiled at Lin Xiu.

Smiling away the debt of gratitude and of revenge.

In the past, Ouyang Hang hated Lin Xiu to death, but after so long, he no longer hated Lin Xiu. Instead, he admired Lin Xiu.

He was the person he admired the most, no one else.

After all, to reach his current level of strength in a short period of time from his past skill, was really incredible.

“Don’t help me, I’ll just sit here and rest for a while.”

When he walked down, Lin Xiu felt that his stamina had recovered a little, and he said aloud.

“Tl help you sit down first.”

Ouyang Hang nodded at this time.

“Lin Xiu, you kid, you are really amazing.” Huang Zhen and Qian Yao were also sitting in the seats next to each other, and they couldn’t help but admire Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu smiled and didn’t say much.

Because of the appearance of Nan Huang’s grandfather and the even more terrifying girl, Lin Xiu realized that this world was not that simple, and there were more powerful and terrifying existences.

Although he was now a rank 8 warrior, his strength seemed to be very weak!

He had to grow stronger!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help clenching his hands.

But at this time, he looked around and found Luo Yue’s figure, which made Lin Xiu a little sad.

And Baili Haoling had disappeared.

“Congratulations to you all.”

At this moment, Dean Baili had already walked over and smiled at the crowd.

“Dean!”

‘When Huang Zhen and the others saw Dean Baili approaching, they immediately stood up and said respectfully.

Dean Baili waved his hand and motioned them to sit down.

“Are you okay?”

Looking at Lin Xiu, whose face seemed pale, Director Baili said with concern.

“Tm fine.”

Lin Xiu smiled and said.

‘When he fought just now, he didn’t get any injuries, and his current weakness was more from the after-effects of ‘Fury’.

“Lam very satisfied with your game today.”

Bai Litao touched his beard and said aloud.

Because in the last Intercontinental Tournament, one of his Sacred Region Academy contestants died. Thinking of this, Bai Litao’s eyes showed a killing intent.

But this time, the Interstellar Academy’s losses were even greater.

Moreover, in tonight’s final, Lin Xiu even killed Nan Huang of Sky City, and Bai Litao felt relieved when he thought of the appearance of the vice president of Sky City, whose cheeks were green with anger.

“By the way, Dean, who is that girl? I think her strength is even more terrifying. Isn’t she also from our Sacred Region Academy?”

Huang Zhen seemed to have thought of something at this time, and suddenly said out of curiosity.

And when Qian Yao and Ouyang Hang heard Huang Zhen’s words, they looked at Dean Baili, and they were very curious about it.

Especially Ouyang Hang, he knew that Nan Huang’s grandfather’s perverted strength could be said to be at the level of an old monster, but just now on the competition stage, the girl kicked him and flew him away!

This kind of strength was almost like a rank 9 warrior facing a rank 1 warrior.

“Well… I can probably guess who she is.” Dean Baili said at this time, and immediately touched his beard, looking into the distance in his eyes, with a look of admiration and respect in his eyes.

“Who is it? That strength is really powerful. There are such strong people in our academy?”

Qian Yao was even more curious at this time.

“No, she’s not from our academy.”

At this time, Dean Baili shook his head and said.

“That is…”

“She’s my ancestor.”

Bai Litao said seriously at this time.

“Ancestor?”

‘When Ouyang Hang and the others heard Dean Baili’s answer, their eyes widened.

“In the last few centuries when she was young, the first virus broke out on Earth. It is said that she was infected with the virus at the time, but she had her own consciousness, and the virus strengthened her body.”

Bai Litao said aloud as if talking to himself.

“I thought she had passed away, but I didn’t expect that she was still alive.”

With this said, Bai Litao was shocked.

He was a rank 9 warrior, and his hearing was different from ordinary people. As long as he wanted to listen, he could clearly hear their conversations on the competition stage.

So what happened just now, he could easily understand what was going on.

“Have you lived for hundreds of years…”

Huang Zhen was stunned at this time. Due to the evolution of the body and the continuous division of cells, although the lifespan of a rank 9 warrior can be greatly improved, but the warrior still can’t survive for so long, and there is no sign of aging…

“I don’t know if the earliest ancestor (interpretation: the father of the distant ancestor) will also appear on Earth…”

Bai Litao seemed to have thought of something at this time, and then said expectantly.

“What’s his name?”

Ouyang Hang also said curiously at this time.

Because their family also has a genealogy, which records the affairs of the family elders.

“Ican’t tell you this, I can only say that his surname is Li.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“His strength is absolutely invincible on Earth.”

Saying this, Bai Litao rarely showed an extremely proud look.

Lin Xiu became a little curious after hearing Bai Litao’s words.

The background of this Baili Tao family is very big.

“Okay, you all have a good rest. Let’s have a celebration dinner together tonight.”

Bai Litao laughed.

“There are still quite a few students from our academy in Sky City, so we can get together.”

“Okay, I can finally relax!”

Qian Zhen said with a smile at this time.

“Lwon’t be going.”

Lin Xiu looked at a new text message on the phone and said with a smile.

“Why?”

Huang Zhen was startled, then said out of curiosity.

“Ive something on.”

Lin Xiu grinned.

“Hmph, leave him, a guy who values sex over friends.” Ouyang Hang seemed to understand something, and said with a cold snort at this time.
