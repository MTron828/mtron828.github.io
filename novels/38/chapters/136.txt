Chapter 137: Fierce Battle In The Desert

Lin Xiu snorted, the two seemed to have tacit cooperation and charged forward at the same time!

Lin Xiu attacked three of the guys at the side.

They were all rank 3 warriors but Lin Xiu was not afraid at all and instead felt as though the blood in his body was boiling.

Battle!!!

“Meteor Strike!” A man with a spear attacked Lin Xiu.

Seeing that Lin Xiu was a spear user like him, he had the pride to let Lin Xiu see what true spear arts were.

Lin Xiu felt a white light aura swept past him. Like a meteor, it appeared at his throat in an instant!

Clang-

Lin Xiu used his spear and blocked the incoming spear tip, producing sparks from the collision.

“Let me show you how to use a spear!” Lin Xiu snorted as he grabbed Dark Edge tightly with 10 fingers and stabbed forward.

Although Dark Edge was heavy, Lin Xiu had slowly gotten used to it.

“Seeking death!” But Lin Xiu was not up against one rank 3 warrior, but three of them!

The other two wielding sabers charged from both sides in an attempt to pincer him!

They worked their sabers extremely fast and slashed down and produced vacuum sounds from the strikes.

Adjudicate!

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted and immediately used his skill!

Bang-

The two men that came from opposite directions had a change in their eyes as they discovered a powerful force coming out while Lin Xiu waved his spear. This powerful force threw the two of them backwards simultaneously!

What kind of skill is that?!

The two rank 3 warriors were stunned.

Lin Xiu glanced at the two after unleashing Adjudicate, feeling that it was somewhat a pity. the two were stronger and adjudicate’s effect was no longer as impactful.

At this time, the spear-wielding warrior charged at Lin Xiu fanatically.

Lin Xiu’s taunt “Let me show you how to use a spear!” had infuriated him.

The silver spear in his hands moved extremely fast and produced sparks against Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge.

He started to feel the fatigue gradually because the power from Lin Xiu’s spear was extremely large and every collision made his fingers numb.

This was not just from Lin Xiu’s personal strength but the weight of his spear. It was extremely heavy and was 600 catty at the very least!

Wait a minute, this spear is completely black… could it be that spear?! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The man seemed to recall something and his eyes gradually opened wide as he fought against Lin Xui, “Is your spear, Dark Edge?!”

That’s right, only that spear was extremely black and the shaft extremely glossy not from oil but from the unique material!

“You know about it?” Lin Xiu raised an eyebrow and asked.

It had to be said, the man’s spear techniques were good and were only a tad inferior compared to his!

Lin Xiu used his strength and collided with his opponent’s spear again!

The immense power forced him back a few steps.

Pu-

The guy opened his eyes wide as he struggled to stabilize himself.

A sweet taste gushed up his throat as he vomited blood out.

“Zezeze, this is the start of the real battle. I’m going to kill you and take your weapon!”

The man spat the remaining blood from his mouth as his face became even more sinister and he proclaimed.

On the other side, Luo Yue was fighting against Wan Hu and another warrior.

Sssila-

Wan Hu was careless and got cut by Luo Yue’s sword.

The sharp sword qi lacerated his skin.

She was clearly injured and her wounds were not light, but how could she still be so strong!!!

Luo Yue’s expression remained unchanged as her eyes stayed cold. She used her sword to strike the warrior that used a sword as well!

“Blossom fall!”

“Go and die!”

The man with the sword roared out loud and erupted with phenomenal speed and aimed his sword at her!

The sword seemed to transform into a powerful cold aura with an unblockable offense!

Luo Yue frowned slightly but disregarded defense and launched an attack as well!

“You…” The warrior did not expect for Luo Yue to take him head-on?!

Although his attack looked imposing, it was a feint and he would only use the real killing technique when Luo Yue attempted to dodge!

As Luo Yue charged forward, her dress received a few more cuts.

Blood trickled out.

But her expression remained unchanged without a shred of pain.

The warrior started to panic and in the next moment, Luo Yue’s sword seemed to draw on light as she slashed forward!

“This….what skill is this…” The warrior opened his eyes wide.

Before he could finish his sentence, a cut appeared on his face. One second later, his head was split in half.

Wan Hu was speechless upon seeing that but quickly steadied himself.

Because she had many wounds all over her body as well.

To kill the warrior, she had sustained many injuries!

Opportunity!

Wan Hu leaped forward with his large machete and charged forward!

“Be careful!” Lin Xiu warned Luo Yue while engaged with the three warriors.

“Take care of yourself.” Luo Yue replied indifferently.

She did not reveal any pain and looked over to Wan Hu with the intent of fighting.

Clang clang clang-

Lin Xiu started to feel exhaustion while fighting the three.

There were times where he almost got cut as well.

Siiiila-

And they wielded unique weapons. While being attacked by the red saber, Lin Xiu’s body sustained another wound.

Even his robes got cut through!

“Go and die!!!” The man with the spear roared as he stabbed towards the opening!
