Ji Mei and the others also clearly knew this and their faces became extremely nervous at this time.

This signal from Tang Qing was obviously a gathering of all Tang Pavilion warriors.

There were many warriors in Tang Pavilion, many more than their Haoyue Sect.

If it weren’t for the tyrannical strength of their Haoyue Sect’s sect master, they would have been swallowed up long ago.

As Tang Qing’s signal was sent out, Lin Xiu raised his eyes and could clearly see a large number of warriors attacking from all directions.

!!

There were many of them.

“It may get a little dangerous, you guys stay here and don’t move.”

Lin Xiu looked at this scene, then said to Ji Mei and others.

Stay here and don’t move?

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Ji Mei and the others were stunned.

Just when she was puzzled, she suddenly found that a translucent energy matrix appeared around her.

Directly framed them in it.

“Master!”

At this time, a large number of warriors flew to Tang Qing’s side. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The signal released by Tang Qing just now is the most advanced signal in the Tang Pavilion.

The level of this kind of signal is only released when it reaches the level of life and death.

It called out all the warriors of their Tang Pavilion.

“That boy in front, deal with him.”

Tang Qing stared at Lin Xiu at this time and said lightly.

Hearing Tang Qing’s words, the eyes of many warriors turned to Lin Xiu.

Is it this warrior who poses a great threat to Tang Pavilion?

Lin Xiu looked at these warriors, there was no fear on his face, but a strange smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

Experience, these warriors were only experience in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

Experience delivered to his door, why not?

As soon as his right hand was raised, the Dark Edge spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand from the expansion space.

“kill!!!”

At this moment, the rest of the Tang Pavilion warriors had already attacked Lin Xiu at the same time.

There are indeed many warriors in Tang Pavilion and almost all of them were peak Respected warrior.

When these warriors came over, they directly released their powerful skills.

boom boom boom —

Those skill powers were released and rushed to Lin Xiu’s body.

But what is shocking is that Lin Xiu still was fine!

“too weak.”

While Lin Xiu said lightly, the Dark Edge spear in his hand slashed directly into the air.

The body of the warrior in front was instantly cut in half by the spear!

“Damn!”

Seeing this scene, Tang Qing’s expression changed slightly.

That’s the peak Respected warrior and even he, the Sage warrior, couldn’t kill him so easily like crushing an ant.

Lin Xiu, raised his hand and killed several top-level warriors in their Tang Pavilion, making Tang Qing feel that his heart was bleeding.

After all, it’s not that easy to cultivate a peak Respected warrior.

At this time, while he watched the warriors in his Tang Pavilion continue to attack Lin Xiu frantically, out of the corner of his eye, he saw Ji Mei and others on the other side.

“Humph!”

Tang Qing snorted coldly and with a flash, he appeared in front of the matrix.

Reaching out, he was about to grab Ji Mei who was in the matrix.

boom–

But the moment his hand touched the matrix, he found that he had no way to penetrate the matrix at all.

What is this?!

Tang Qing’s expression changed and the long sword behind him appeared in his hands.

With a long sword in both hands, he is about to break this matrix!

Ji Mei and others in the matrix opened their eyes wide and subconsciously unfolded their ‘Sphere’.

bang bang bang-

His long sword slashed crazily on this matrix.

He still had no way to cut down the matrix!

Ji Mei and the others in the matrix were also surprised at this time.

They looked at Lin Xiu subconsciously.

At this time, Lin Xiu was already holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand and dancing frantically.

With Lin Xiu now possessing such a powerful force, the Dark Edge spear swung as if it could break open the space.

The Destiny Spear Art was really too powerful.

The moment the weapons of those warriors collided with Lin Xiu’s spear, they were directly knocked out.

Some weapons were directly destroyed!

boom boom boom —

Dark blue flames burst out continuously and huge flaming birds appeared one after another, charging towards the warriors of Tang Pavilion!

There are too many, too many, those Tang Pavilion warriors, there is no way to dodge.

And as they unfolded the ‘Sphere’, those flaming birds his their ‘Sphere’ and even their ‘Sphere’ was burned and melted away!

“Stop!!!”

Tang Qing looked at this scene at this time and the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

He couldn’t break the matrix no matter how hard he tried so he turned to look at Lin Xiu.

At this time, every time Lin Xiu swung his spear, he would definitely kill several Tang Pavilion warriors, causing Tang Qing’s eyes to widen in anger.

A Lin Xiu, in a short period of time, actually caused his Tang Pavilion to suffer such heavy casualties!

“Master!!!”

At the same time, in the sky, several warriors rushed over.

These few warriors looked different from ordinary warriors.

Their strength was obviously much stronger.

“Left Guardian, Right Magic, Elder Lin and Elder Bai are all here!”

Looking at this scene, Tang Qi’s body also trembled slightly.

These four warriors were not in Baidi City. He didn’t expect that they would come here at this time.

“You guys came?”

Seeing this scene, Tang Qing immediately said aloud.

“We got the news. Is this the kid?”

One of the warriors with white hair was suspended in the air, looking down at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

Seeing the surrounding area, the flaming bird that Lin Xiu released just now filled the surrounding area with flames.

The whole area was a sea of ??fire.

On the ground are the bodies of the fallen warriors of Tang Pavilion.

Almost all of them were burnt to coke by the flames.

Experience has been slowly increasing and now it has risen to about 86%!

He could upgrade soon.

It was true, as long as he killed these Sage warriors in the sky, then he should be able to level up again!

“Elders, that’s him! The people from the Haoyue Sect teamed up with this kid to slaughter our Tang Pavilion!”

Tang Qi was at the back, pointing at Lin Xiu and roaring loudly.

It’s just that at this time he was very panicked and his body was shaking.
