Chapter 58: The Terrifying Instant Flicker Tri-strike!

“Hmph, let’s see how you survive that.” Zhou Diaoyu sneered.

This skill was not something any ordinary warrior could defend against, much less a rank 1 warrior.

The terrifying attack did not leave anything behind, right?

“Lin…Lin Xiu?” Li Yi started trembling when he witnessed the attack.

Xu Wen had his eyes locked in the same position.

When the dense cloud of dust started to scatter, Zhou Diaoyu’s original sneering face suddenly froze.

‘How is that possible!’

“Hahaha, I just knew that the Brat Lin Xiu can’t do so easily.” Li Yi laughed out loud in happiness when he saw Lin Xiu standing in his original position with his spear in hand.

Lin Xiu was gasping and in a slightly rugged state. If he had not reacted fast enough and utilized Fury to vastly improve his stats, he would have died to the skill.

His body was covered in pain and his battle robes were tattered and torn.

“Seems like this game has become even more interesting.” Zhou Diaoyu snorted and raised his broadsword as he charged at Lin Xiu again.

His speed remained as fast!

He brandished the gigantic broadsword with one hand and his movements brought about bursts of vacuum.

Zhou Diaoyu fumed with rage when he saw that Lin Xiu had no plans to dodge him and instead charged towards him.

He had made a name for himself and at least 80 warriors had died at his hands. This was the first time he was being suppressed by a rank 1 warrior to such an extent.

He could only wash off this humiliation by killing him!

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted. Under the effect of Fury, his strength had broken through rank 2. Although they were still differing in an entire realm, he could not lose in terms of a head-on battle!

It was a do or die.

Immediately after, the spear and broadsword collided once again and produced the metallic sounds.

Lin Xiu initially thought that the black broadsword was not as heavy as it looked, only to discover that the black broadsword was extremely heavy after fighting against it!

And as he scrutinized further, he noticed that Zhou Diaoyu’s five fingers were thicker than an ordinary person. He brandished the black broadsword extremely well and quickly.

“No way, although Lin Xiu’s speed is on par with Zhou Diaoyu, he can’t attack him.” Seeing how Lin Xiu’s Torrential storm of rose flowers strike was being blocked by the broadsword, Xu Wen commented with a bad expression.

“Lin Xiu, do your best to get rid of him…” Li Yi clenched his fists tightly and muttered to himself.

He could not help in the battle, if he charged in rashly, he would most probably die without knowing how.

“Brat, did you consume some forbidden medicine?” Zhou Diaoyu frowned as he was able to sense that Lin Xiu’s power and speed had increased dramatically, as though they were equals!

Fortunately, his source strength was more vast than Lin Xiu’s and he could block against Lin Xiu’s attacks before using the broadsword to hack at him.

Clang-

Lin Xiu used both hands to wield the spear to block the attack, but the powerful strike forced him to retreat a few steps.

The steps he took left deep imprints on the ground.

“Instant

Flicker

Tri-strike!!!” Zhou Diaoyu pressed on, and with a loud roar, he exerted a force with both legs and disappeared from his original position.

“Another silver skill?!” Li Yu and the other soldiers exclaimed in surprise.

“It’s going to be dangerous.” Xu Wen’s pupils constricted.

Instant Flicker Tri-strike was a silver skill and considered a high-tier skill amongst the silver skills.

This skill was extremely fast and unleashed three powerful strikes in a short span of time, each strike with more lethality and power than the previous!

As he had used up too much source strength in Slash of the Sacred Crescent Light to no avail, Zhou Diaoyu did not have enough source strength to unleash another large area attack.

This technique must be able to kill him!

Where is he?!

Over at the other side, Lin Xiu’s pupils wavered as a cold light flickered. Another figure appeared behind him.

Clang!

Lin Xiu instinctively blocked his back with the spear as a large force spread across his hands. It caused Lin Xiu’s hands to go numb and he almost lost grip on the spear.

And if one looked carefully enough, they would discover that the Silver Immortal Soul had a small mark on where it was struck.

The black broadsword was too sharp!

The second strike!

The second strike came without a pause!

The second strike was one that struck vertically downwards. If successful, Lin Xiu would instantly be cut into two!

You can go and die now!

Zhou Diaoyu’s eyes were filled with killing intent as though he had used up all the energy in his body. The black broadsword cut through the air and slashed down.

“Awe of the Phoenix!!!” Lin Xiu roared out loud.

He initially wanted to preserve this technique to kill Zhou Diaoyu when he was not paying attention, but the opportunity was gone.

Following Lin Xiu’s roar, the source strength in his body surged into the spear.

Zheng zheng zheng-

The spear seemed to have sensed Lin Xiu’s fury and started to tremble.

The flames surged from the spear to its tip and as Lin Xiu thrust it out, the flames transformed into a phoenix!

“That…” Xu Wen was stunned when he saw the phoenix. He definitely knew of Lin Xiu’s Awe of the Phoenix skill, but the energy undulation from the utilization of the skill here was clearly something only a silver skill could produce!

That’s right, the Awe of the Phoenix had upgraded to a silver skill as Lin Xiu had completely grasped the bronze level!

Over 10 phoenixes flew out from Lin Xiu’s attack and charged at Zhou Diaoyu!

The air around seemed to distort from the temperature of the flames!

Zhou Diaoyu’s eyes constricted when he saw this but had no way to dodge, so he continued to slash downwards!

The speartip collided with the broadsword and produced many sparks.

Bang!!!!

Following a loud explosion, Lin Xiu was flung away and smashed right into a wall.

Pain filled his entire body as he felt heaviness in his chest. Blood filled his throat as he coughed it out.

Due to the 10 phoenixes, Zhou Diaoyu’s hair had been charred, his cheeks were black, and blood came out of his mouth.

“Hahaha”

He suddenly laughed out loud.

Instant Flicker Tri-strike was increasingly powerful and capable of absorbing the power of its enemy’s attack to strengthen its own. Although Lin Xiu’s Awe of the Phoenix was powerful, it had immediately maxed out the last strike’s power!
