Chapter 836: Underground Base

The rest of the warriors were all staring at Lin Xiu at this time.

Will this young man bring any miracles?

Lin Xiu stood on the gate at this time, then pressed his hands on the gate.

Open!

As soon as Lin Xiu exerted his strength, he was about to push this giant gate open!

crackling-

At this moment, a large amount of current burst out immediately.

Then it covered Qin Yi’s body.

What a terrifying current!

The rest of the people were shocked when they saw this scene.

When Luo Yue saw this scene, she seemed a little worried, but she knew that Lin Xiu would never do anything he was unsure of and she didn’t stop him.

“Open… right now!”

Lin Xiu roared angrily at this moment, the gate was immediately pushed open!

Boom—

As the gate was pushed open, a dazzling light suddenly passed over.

Everyone subconsciously blocked the light with their hands.

Although Lin Xiu’s body has a lot of electric flashes, for the current Lin Xiu, this kind of electric current only gave him a tingling sensation.

It’s not a big deal.

At this time, after getting used to the white light, he looked inward and Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

Because there is actually a base, a huge underground base!

There is white light all around, making the entire underground base extremely bright.

“This...is it really an underground base?

When the other warriors saw this scene, they couldn’t help but widen their eyes, then slowly walked in.

“I’m fine, let me go.”

Chen Dong seemed to have recovered at this time and said aloud to the warriors who were supporting him.

The two warriors hesitated for a while, then let go of Chen Dong.

Although Chen Dong’s face was a little pale, he was able to stand.

“What are these things?”

Walking inside, looking at the strange instruments inside, she said in surprise.

These quirky instruments have a ton of buttons that glow with light. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

And upon closer inspection, there were many transparent tubes connected to the instruments and they didn’t know where they were connected to.

“Look, these are... Odd crystals?!”

At this time, everyone looked carefully and they saw that there were mountains of Odd crystals on the side!

clack clack——

And at this time, some robots carried these odd crystals and placed them in an instrument.

It seems that the program has been set in advance and these robots just move mechanically.

Lin Xiu and others were completely ignored.

The level of the Odd crystals was very high and they were all above rank 10!

Luo Yue looked at everything inside and she was surprised too.

“Captain Chen, have you seen this kind of thing?”

Some warriors looked at Chen Dong and said aloud.

All the machines here look too strange and I don’t know what they are for.

“I haven’t seen it either.”

Chen Dong shook his head, then said.

Lin Xiu’s eyes were also looking around at this time. The strange and huge instruments around had many transparent tubes and these tubes were connected to the other side of the wall.

Where does it lead to?

Lin Xiu walked over, then reached out and touched the wall.

bang bang bang-

“It’s empty inside?”

Luo Yue also came over and said curiously.

“Seems to be.”

Lin Xiu said, then took a closer look.

Then he discovered that there seemed to be a small switch on the wall.

Eh?

He touched the switch with his foot and at this moment, the wall made a ‘boom boom’ sound.

Soon, it opened automatically!

“Look over there!”

The rest of the warriors also looked over here, looking at the gate that opened automatically, with surprise in their eyes.

The more surprising thing was what was inside.

Inside, there were huge glass containers suspended individually.

Inside these containers, there were the bodies of warriors.

“This... who are these people?”

Chen Dong walked in at this time, looking at the scene inside, his body could not help trembling.

The area on the inside was very big and there were many of these weird glass containers.

Inside are all the bodies of some warriors suspended in the transparent liquid inside.

Just when everyone looked at these strange glass containers, an exclamation came from the front.

“What’s happening?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows, then looked over to the side where the voice came from.

Taking a closer look, you can clearly see a skeleton ahead.

“This... how come there are white bones here?”

He looked to the front and he could clearly see a huge skeleton on a chair in front of him.

The skeleton was very tall, about three meters high.

“Why is this person so tall...”

At this time, Chen Dong all walked over to the front. Seeing this scene, he couldn’t help but be extremely surprised.

This skeleton was still wearing clothes and it seemed to be holding a strange book in his hand.

“This person should have been dead for a long time.”

Chen Dong smelled a rotten smell and his brows could not help wrinkling.

Looking at the book in his hand, Chen Dong hesitated for a moment, then picked it up.

He found that the words written on it were all strange and incomprehensible words.

“Does any of you understand what these words are?”

Chen Dong held the book, looked at everyone and said.

“I have researched the languages ??in the world, let me take a look.”

A female warrior raised her hand and said.

Chen Dong nodded, then handed over the book.

The female warrior took the book and started to read it.

There are still many manuscripts in this book and the text is very strange.

“Did you see anything?”

Chen Dong said at this time.

The female warrior shook her head and closed the book.

“It’s a language that doesn’t belong to this world.”

“A language that doesn’t belong to this world?”

The rest of the warriors were startled when they heard her words.

“Really…”

A warrior said suspiciously.

“I have studied every language that has appeared in the world. Unless this language has not been recorded, it is impossible for me not to know it.”

The female warrior said confidently.

At the same time, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were already walking towards the corner.

Because they found that there was a gate in the corner.

There was a clattering sound from behind the gate.

It seems like... the sound of sea water.

Lin Xiu pulled the gate hard.

Squeak-

A voice that made one’s teeth sour rang out.

“This...is it a ship?”

As soon as the gate was opened, Luo Yue was surprised to find that behind the gate was a hole somewhere on the island and outside the hole was the Black river.

A huge cruise ship is parked here.
