1300 God’s Descend Again!

Just when he had killed Lin Xiu’s shadows, Huang Fugu felt a cold feeling coming from behind him.

Damn!

His pupil shrunk uncontrollably. He instantly gave up attacking Lin Xiu’s shadows and instead placed the sword before his body to protect himself.

Boom – –

!!

However, a cold light flashed across his eyes and the tip of the Hao Yue Spear had pierced through his shoulder.

Blood splattered everywhere and it stained his combat suit red.

Lin Xiu, on the other hand, felt that it had been a little wasted. He was getting so close to defeating this man.

Huang Fugu’s reaction was indeed much faster than he had expected!

“Move!”

Huang Fugu’s eyes were opened wide as he roared in rage.

All of the energy in his body exploded instantly.

As the overdomineering energy came blasting out of his body, the Hao Yue Spear that was pierced through his shoulder was instantly thrown onto the ground.

Lin Xiu, who was holding onto the spear, could feel the strong surge of energy. He grabbed tightly onto the spear and along with it, he was thrown into the distance.

Lin Xiu quickly grabbed hold of his footing after being ambushed.

He managed to quickly steady himself.

“Huuuuuu~”

Lin Xiu was panting as well.

Huang Fugu was indeed a powerful warrior. He was able to push out the spear that had pierced through his shoulder.

“I want you dead! Dead!!!!!”

At the same time, Huang Fugu was enraged after having his shoulder injured.

As he continued to release the energy from his body, the entire place started shaking violently.

“What is he doing?!”

Baili Haoling, who was in the audience seat, was looking around with her eyes widened.

Then, she quickly removed her eye mask and started looking for Lin Xiu.

She soon found the stage where Lin Xiu was fighting.

Although she was sitting far from them, she had excellent vision and could see what was happening in the battle.

Baili Haoling could also clearly feel that Huang Fugu’s strength was getting stronger. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The speed at which it was happening was so quick that even she was surprised.

“Huang Fugu has been hiding his strength?”

Zhang Qinghua was surprised as well.

“Well, we didn’t think that he would keep this side from us. From the look of it now, we already know who’s winning.”

Wan Gan looked at the scene before him as he gently stroked his moustache.

Riyan frowned instead.

That’s it? It’s over already?

Lin Xiu, who was in the battle, suddenly felt a strong suppressive force over him.

He then quickly realised that there was a golden glow above his head and it was penetrating into his body!

This was…God’s Descend?!

Seeing what was happening, Lin Xiu suddenly thought of the men that he had met at the Divine Domain. Huang Fugu and another warrior god had used the same method to transfer their energy onto those men on Namir Planet.

Now….there should be another warrior god who was transferring his energy over to Huang Fugu!

That warrior god must be someone in the warrior god realm and the energy that he was giving to Huang Fugu was limitless!

Seeing how Huang Fugu’s strength was increasing madly without control, the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed drastically as he activated the skills in his system!

‘Skill Enhancement’!

As his strength increases, the ‘Skill Enhancement’ was merely one that upgraded his skills to saint-level warrior skills but now, it has risen to the effect of a God-level warrior skills!

With that, Lin Xiu quickly released the ‘Awe of Phoenix’!

“Profound Intent – The Awe of Phoenix!!!”

Not only was he using the profound intent, the Awe of Phoenix was now already a God-level warrior skills!

The Hao Yue Spear started glowing brightly as well.

Lin Xiu’s source energy was getting transferred over to his spear!

“Go!”

As Lin Xiu swung his spear, there were countless dark blue flaming birds that swiftly came out of Lin Xiu’s spear.

“The flames…..they’re so powerful!”

Wan Gan, who just commented that Huang Fugu was extremely powerful, had his jaw dropped to the ground when he saw how Lin Xiu had released the flaming birds.

“A warrior god skill?!”

Zhang Qingyan’s pupil shrunk uncontrollably as well.

...

God-level warrior skills were something extremely rare here in Warrior God Realm.

Due to the flaming birds that were released, the entire place turned warm.

Even the air around them started to get scorching hot.

However, these flaming birds did not attack Lin Xiu immediately.

Instead, they started gathering together…

Soon, they formed a huge flaming phoenix!

It was flapping its wings and suddenly, it went straight for Huang Fugu!

Huang Fugu had just finished accepting the energy that was being sent into his body when he saw the flaming phoenix headed his way! His eyes were opened wide with surprise as well.

How did this young brat have such terrifying energy?!

Huang Fugu’s face looked horrible.

Just when the flaming phoenix was about to reach him, Huang Fugu opened his mouth and roared.

...

The overflowing energy in his body blasted and they turned into a horrifying flame that covered his entire body!

At the same time, the flaming phoenix was already coming at him from above his head!

There was no way that Huang Fugu would be able to dodge it!

Boom – –

With the loud explosion head, the flaming phoenix landed on the ground.

The entire place started shaking vigorously because of the impact.

As the flaming phoenix landed on the ground, it instantly turned into a huge flaming tornado.

It was fortunate that the stage had no roof. If it had one, the entire place would have been destroyed.

The stage at which Lin Xiu was at had turned boiling hot.

If it wasn’t because the palace was made of a special type of metal, the ground would have melted as well.

“Huuuuuu~”

Lin Xiu continued panting.

A god-level warrior skills as such was still exhausting to the body.

He had his eyes fixed on the tornado.

Lin Xiu knew that Huang Fugu was not dead.

This was because he didn’t hear a notification from the system.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and started replenishing his energy with the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

“That boy…”

Wan Gan’s eyes were staring at the tornado as well and he couldn’t help but gasp.

That was so powerful. If it was him, he wouldn’t have been able to take it.

Would Haung Fugu lose this match?

Lin Xiu was replenishing his energy while staring at the flaming tornado.

Then, as expected, there was a figure that slowly appeared!
