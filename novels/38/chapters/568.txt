Chapter 569: The 30th Floor that Exploded!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Boom – –

Before Tang Chi could reach the ground, he was hit by another punch from Lin Xiu.

One after the other, Lin Xiu threw him in the air and kept him there. There wasn’t a chance that Tang Chi could even touch the ground.

‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’!

In his last hit, the gloves that Lin Xiu had on completely turned bloody red, and with his warrior skill, he flung Tang Chi far into the distance.

With that, Tang Chi’s body immediately landed on the wall behind him and it almost broke the wall.

Bi Li Hua La – –

Tang Chi’s body was on the ground and it was completely covered with the electric arc.

This electric arc was one of Lin Xiu’s warrior skills.

His body was trembling as he was completely covered by the arcs.

Plus, with Lin Xiu’s mad attacks, his body was now completely swollen with blood everywhere.

Pfft – –

Tang Chi’s eyes were wide open and he spat a mouthful of blood.

“That’s all you’ve got?” Lin Xiu walked over and looked down at Tang Chi.

After hearing what Lin Xiu, Tang Chi who was already severely injured felt even madder and it was followed by another mouthful of blood.

“Hehehehe….you will never make it past this floor….even if I die, you won’t be able to...”

Even when Tang Chi was already severely injured, he was still grinning and laughing out loud.

Beep beep beep – –

It was then that Lin Xiu heard a familiar sound.

What was it that kept ringing?

Lin Xiu was stunned. He looked up and saw that there was a timer that was placed on a wall ahead of him. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The numbers were in red and it was counting down from 10, 9, 8... It was obvious that it was counting down to something.

When Lin Xiu came on this floor, he didn’t notice that there was a timer on this wall and had no idea when it appeared.

But, from his assumption, if the timer turns to 0, does this mean that he would fail the challenge on this floor?

Or….will something else happen?

Boom – –

Just when Lin Xiu was still trying to figure out what it was, Tang Chi, who was lying on the ground, suddenly stood up and grabbed Lin Xiu from the back. He grabbed onto Lin Xiu as tightly as he could!

His body was already completely covered in fresh blood but he was acting as if he couldn’t feel any pain as he pinned Lin Xiu onto the ground. He didn’t allow Lin Xiu to move at all.

“You’re dead! I want you dead!!!!”

Tang Chi laid in his pool of blood and was acting like a complete psycho. His eyes were filled with a ‘mad’ look as he screamed out loud.

Lin Xiu frowned as he tried to set free but Tang Chi was extremely strong now as he was using every bit of the energy left in his body. No matter how hard Lin Xiu tried, it was still impossible for him to set himself free.

Beep!!

As the countdown ended, there was a sharp sound that spread throughout.

Koong Loong – –

At the next moment, there was a huge explosion that happened and it looked as if the entire floor had been destroyed.

“Looks like the explosion on the 30th floor has been set off. Must have been a lot of sacrifices there...”

The warriors who had failed or were waiting for their chances could feel the vibration on the ground and all of them couldn’t help but smile.

As for those on the 30th floor, the entire place was filled with a thick layer of smoke.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Soon, it was as if a window had been opened and all of the smoke left the floor.

“Can you let go of me now?”

As the smoke slowly disappeared, Lin Xiu was still unharmed, standing in the middle of the room.

His body was now surrounded by a dark red ‘Yuan’.

Then, at the very next moment, the ‘Yuan’ disappeared.

Tang Chi was still hugging Lin Xiu from the back and was pinning him to the ground. It was impossible for Lin Xiu to move.

“This is impossible...”

Tang Chi looked extremely bloody and was now screaming on top of his lungs with his eyes opened wide. He couldn’t believe what just happened.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be able to activate his ‘Yuan’ and that it would be able to withstand such a scary explosion.

This was a ‘trick’ on the 30th floor. Once it gets triggered, it would lead to a huge explosion.

There were a lot of other warriors who died in this manner. Before they could find the way to escape to the next floor, they would have triggered the explosion and died in it.

Lin Xiu frowned and moved his body. Tang Chi, who was still hanging from his back, immediately lost it and even broke both his arms.

This time, it was really the end for Tang Chi.

There was a notification that came from Lin Xiu’s system. Lin Xiu didn’t even bother looking at it as he knew that it wouldn’t be a lot.

He picked up the spear that was on the ground and took a good look at his surroundings and noticed that there was nothing but debris on the 30th floor.

He could also see that there was a window by one of the walls that would allow him to see the view outside of the building.

Lin Xiu was stunned when he saw the window and immediately looked out of it.

As he stood by the window and looked downwards, he could clearly see the warriors that were on the ground.

Qu Tingting had failed on one of the floors and returned to the ground. She was meditating with her ‘Cultivation Technique’. She was still thinking of how to advance to the next floor and had just stood up. Then, as she looked up, she could see Lin Xiu from the window on the 30th floor.

Qu Tingting was shocked.

She could obviously feel the vibration from the explosion but she was still meditating which was why she didn’t pay too much attention to it. When she saw Lin Xiu’s by the window, she soon realized that it was Lin Xiu!

He was on the 30th floor which meant that he was there when the explosion happened but he was unharmed.

How did he do it?!

Lin Xiu saw Qu Tingting as well and waved at her.

Qu Tingting saw Lin Xiu and she couldn’t help but laugh as well.

“Tsk….wow, he’s still alive. Lucky him.” One of the warriors noticed him as well and spoke to Qu Tingitng in a salty tone.

“But, I’m sure that he would only make it to the 35th floor.”

“No…I think he can get to the 60th floor.” Qu Tingting shook her head in disagreement.

“Haha….. The 60th floor is double of the floor that he is at now. You’re joking, right? He’s just a first-year student; even if he’s good, do you think that he could be that good?”
