Chapter 231: Challenge!

Boom–

Just as Lin Xiu was about to practice, there was a sudden noise outside the door.

Lin Xiu frowned, then walked over to the door and saw a figure standing here.

Yu Yi! Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The Yu Yi who had fought with him in the Tower of Tournament, what was he doing here?

“I heard that you are the number one freshman now, right?” Yu Yi looked at Lin Xiu, then said coldly.

When he recalled being defeated by Lin Xiu and having so many people known about it, it felt very uncomfortable.

After all, Lin Xiu’s strength barely reached rank 4 yet as a rank 5 peak warrior at that time, he was actually defeated by Lin Xiu!

Although Lin Xiu used some clever tricks, it was still shameful for him!

The only way to wash away the shame was to defeat Lin Xiu!

“Go straight to the point.” Lin Xiu looked at him and said.

Yu Yi wouldn’t have visited without an ulterior motive, this chap probably wanted to have a rematch.

Lin Xiu defeated him previously and he probably held a grudge.

After all, Lin Xiu tricked him to win.

“Next Monday, do you dare to have another match against me at the Tower of Tournament?” Yu Yi said, looking at Lin Xiu straight in the eye.

“Why should I go?” Lin Xiu raised his brows and said indifferently.

Yu Yi came to look for him which meant that he clearly was confident in winning and wanted to wash away the shame from before.

If Lin Xiu simply agreed to it, wouldn’t it be digging a pit for himself?

“If you win, this is yours.” Yu Yi seemed to know that Lin Xiu would refuse. At this time, he took out a card from his pocket and placed it in front of Lin Xiu.

Looking at the bright light emitted by this card, Lin Xiu’s eyes changed.

Diamond body skill card!

Diamond cards were very precious, even ordinary diamond skills were very valuable, but what Yu Yi took out at this time was a body skill card, which was rarer than diamond skills!

Seeing Lin Xiu’s eyes, the corners of Yu Yi’s mouth curled up. He believed that as long as there was a temptation, Lin Xiu would definitely agree to fight him.

When the time comes, he could not only wash away the shame but also cripple Lin Xiu!

Thinking of this, there was a gleaming light in Yu Yi’s eyes.

“I accept your challenge.” Lin Xiu took a deep breath, weighed the pros and cons, looked away from the diamond card, then looked at Yu Yi and said.

He was now a rank 5 warrior. As long as he reached rank 6, he could learn new diamond skills, as well as diamond body skills.

His current gold body skill was starting to be unable to keep up with him.

And now that Lin Xiu had activated his Analytic Eye, he could clearly see that Yu Yi has advanced to the level of a rank 6 warrior.

A rank 6 warrior and a rank 5 warrior were of totally different levels.

This was also why Yu Yi was so bold to challenge Lin Xiu.

Now that Lin Xiu had ‘Fury’ and ‘Mirror Image’, even if Yu Yi was a rank 6 warrior, Lin Xiu was not to be trifled with!

And if Lin Xiu lost, it wasn’t a big deal. But if he won, he could get this extraordinary diamond body skill card!

“Next Monday, I will be waiting for you on the 22nd floor of the Tower of Tournament.” Yu Yi said with his mouth cocked at this time.

His guess was right, Lin Xiu really took the bait.

“By the way, you haven’t participated in the Tower of Tournament for so many days and your rankings have fallen. You have to fight from the first floor. If you can’t make it all the way up, you won’t even be able to see my shadow!” Yu Yi laughed and walked away.

Lin Xiu looked at his retreating back and his eyes narrowed at this time.

Someone sent a precious diamond body skill card right to his doorstep, why wouldn’t he take it?

“Young Master Hang, it’s done.” After Yu Yi left Lin Xiu, he walked over to a pavilion on the other side and looked at Ouyang Hang who was standing there as he spoke respectfully.

Yes, he challenged Lin Xiu this time mainly because Ouyang Hang looked for him and wanted to get rid of Lin Xiu.

“He accepted the challenge?” Ouyang Hang said subconsciously at this time.

Thinking of the scene in the G17 Ruin, he trembled with anger.

He was actually beaten up by this guy from Class 10 of the South Campus and he almost couldn’t make it back alive.

He must take this revenge!

But today, even Zhuo Qixing was defeated by Lin Xiu. He knew that he would not be Lin Xiu’s opponent.

Lin Xiu has now become the number one student among freshmen.

But he knew that Yu Yi had a grudge with Lin Xiu and that Yu Yi had advanced to rank 6 warrior a few days ago.

He could use Yu Yi to teach Lin Xiu a vicious lesson, of course, it would be even better if Lin Xiu was killed.

“En, this kid saw the diamond body skill and immediately agreed.” Yu Yi nodded at this time and said respectfully.

Yu Yi knew that Ouyang Hang came from a powerful family so his tone was so respectful.

“Hng, that diamond body skill is something that my ancestors prepared for me to use after reaching rank 6. Of course it is powerful.” Ouyang Hang said with a sneer at this time.

“By the way, take this.” Ouyang Hang seemed to have thought of something at this time and handed a black box to Yu Yi.

What is this!?

Seeing this strange thing, Yu Yi was stunned for a moment and subconsciously took the box. After opening the box, Yu Yi was stunned and his eyes were filled with shock.

Hu.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath at this time. When he was planning to continue practicing, he suddenly recalled that he had many lottery chances that were not used yet. He wanted to see if there was anything good, perhaps he could get something like a good skill.

Lin Xiu, who was sitting on the floor, instantly went into his mind. In the column showing the number of chances, Lin Xiu suddenly found that the number of draws had unknowingly accumulated to six times!

He entered the system draw page directly without hesitation.

The familiar turntable appeared and words appeared in Lin Xiu’s mind.

Twelve grids, each grid was either skills, Union coins, weapons, combat suits etc., and a [?] grid which was a mystery.

The rewards were very common and there wasn’t any large number of skill cards like before.

After some thought, Lin Xiu spun the turntable!

He used one chance and the draw started!!!
