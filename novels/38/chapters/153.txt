Chapter 154: Absorbing Rank 6 Odd Crystal Energy

Finally, Lin Xiu ate the medicine obediently. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

After taking three tablets of the medicine for removing blood stasis and healing wounds, Lin Xiu took a deep breath.

He felt the stuffy feeling in his chest slowly disappeared.

Lin Xiu did not continue training either, otherwise, if he exercised too vigorously, he would not recover from the injury.

He went back to his room, sat down cross-legged, and took out the rank 6 Odd Crystal.

With this Odd Crystal, he could draw a lot of energy from it.

Lin Xiu put the Odd Crystal on the palm of his hand at this time, and then started the ‘cultivation technique’.

There was a lot of energy contained in the rank 6 Odd crystal. At this time, the energy in it was constantly rushing into Lin Xiu’s body as Lin Xiu used the ‘cultivation technique’.

This was a very strange feeling, the energy seemed to penetrate into his pores.

Lin Xiu was cultivating while looking at his stats and found that as he continued to absorb the energy in the rank 6 Odd crystal, his experience points were spinning frantically.

Although he knew that as he practiced the ‘Cultivation Technique’, his experience points would increase slightly, he didn’t expect it to increase so quickly.

This was quite a surprise.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu felt a scorching sensation in his body.

A large amount of energy was constantly pouring into his body and blending into every cell in his body

Click, click, click——

Even the bones of his body were constantly changing at this time, becoming stronger and stronger.

Time passed quickly, and the rank 6 Odd crystal still contained a lot of energy. However, Lin Xiu felt that his body couldn’t really take in anymore.

The majestic power seemed to be tearing his body like crazy, and the tingling sensation became stronger.

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth at this moment and continued to absorb the energy.

The body is like a container. As long as it keeps expanding forcefully, it will become bigger and bigger, and the more source strength it can hold.

Although it could be life-threatening, as the saying goes: ‘Money comes from danger’.

As a warrior, he had to keep pushing his body!

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and continued to absorb the energy!

Pa pa pa——

Due to the surge of energy, the skin on his body seemed to be cracked and a little bit of blood began to flow down.

Rollie stood on the table, looked at Lin Xiu’s movements, and seemed a little curious.

Then, it slowly got into Lin Xiu’s backpack, and took out a rank 3 Odd crystal. It began to gnaw on the Odd Crystal like a melon seed while watching Lin Xiu cultivate.

At the same time, Luo Yue, who was on the other side, looked at Lin Xiu’s room, then took the thin long sword and left.

“Jiu Ming, you’re fine now, right?” At the same time, in the living room of the house on the other side, Cheng Yu asked Chai Jiuming who had been bandaged and was sitting on the floor.

Chai Jiuming shook his head, then his face turned a little gloomy.

His bones shattered too fast. Although this kind of operation was just a minor operation in the current world, it would also cause a lot of adverse effects.

Thinking of Lin Xiu’s face, there was resentment in his eyes.

“That kid was too arrogant, and he actually took away Cheng Yu’s 15,000 points. I must find a chance to teach him a lesson!” A man said angrily at this time.

Hearing his words, Cheng Yu’s face darkened too, and there was a kind of pain like his meat was being cut.

This was 15,000 points, which he has accumulated since enrolling in the academy.

“I’m going to use 5,000 points and find the chairman of the Fist Technique Association to destroy his hand!” Chai Jiuming said with gritted teeth.

“This is possible, not only to get rid of his hands, but also his legs!” Cheng Yu nodded and said coldly.

Bang——

The moment he said that, the door was kicked open all of a sudden and a white figure came over!

“Who is it!?” Looking at the accompanying cold light, Cheng Yu’s face changed drastically, and he immediately picked up the long sword that he placed aside and attacked.

Dang dang dang——

Sounds of weapons colliding resounded and in the next moment, Cheng Yu felt his hand going numb, and the weapon in his hand flew out directly because of the huge force.

Chai Jiuming was injured, so he quickly took a few steps back.

“Courting death!!!” Another man picked up a huge hammer and hammered towards the white figure!

Boom——

The hammer hit the ground and made a loud noise.

But he discovered that his attack from behind did not even hit anyone!

“Move again and you’ll die.” Just when he wanted to move, he found that his neck was pierced by sharp nails.

He looked up at this moment and saw a delicate face.

It’s a girl.

He had never seen such a beautiful girl, but the coldness in the girl’s eyes made him feel a tremor in his body.

She looked like she didn’t treat them as humans at all, it was as if she was looking at an ant and could trample them to death in an instant.

“You… who are you… we don’t seem to know each other…” Cheng Yu looked at the long sword in Luo Yue’s other hand that was at his neck and said as his body trembled.

This thin long sword was icy and sharp like she could chop off his head with just a slight effort.

“Who are you!?” Chai Jiuming looked at Luo Yue with a tinge of horror in his eyes.

“Freshman.” Luo Yue replied faintly.

Hearing this, the three of them were shocked, and they thought of what happened today.

She wouldn’t have known that freshman, would she?

“Put away your schemes, if I see any of you moving…”

“I’ll make sure all of you are dead.” After saying this, a murderous aura burst out of Luo Yue’s eyes, making them feel like they couldn’t even breathe properly.

This was a strong murderous aura that can only be exuded if you have killed a lot of people.

At this moment, their legs began to tremble a bit.

Luo Yue retracted the long sword, then walked out without looking back.

Boom—

As Luo Yue left, Cheng Yu and the others couldn’t help but feel their legs go soft at this moment, and they sat directly on the ground.

Their backs were drenched in cold sweats.

They didn’t doubt what Luo Yue said at all.

At this moment, the three of them glanced at each other, and they didn’t even dare to think of taking any revenge.
