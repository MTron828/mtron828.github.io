1256 A Sincere Apology

“What else?”

Lin Xiu was indeed getting curious.

“Those from Haiwang City came here to apologise to you.”

Mr Pang spoke with a peculiar look on his face.

Most of the people who came here for the past few days were seeking revenge. He didn’t think that the city lord of the Haiwang City would be here to apologise.

This was definitely something that Mr Pang did not expect.

“Oh?”

Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows and was feeling interested.

“Let’s take a look then.”

As he walked towards the gates with Mr Pang, Lin Xiu could see that there was a large group of warriors that were blocked outside the energy barrier.

All of them were dressed like those who came and caused havoc a few days earlier.

There was a middle-aged man that stood in the middle.

His eyes were fixed on Lin Xiu.

“You must be the city lord of Lingxian City.”

The middle-aged man smiled.

He looked like a kind mind with no evil intentions.

“You’re right.”

Lin Xiu gave a short reply.

“I am Hai Linsheng.”

“I apologise on behalf of my people from Haiwang City for the mess that they have caused here.”

The man known as Hai Linsheng apologised to Lin Xiu.

“Then?”

Lin Xiu frowned.

He came here to apologise?

Lin Xiu still felt that it was impossible.

From how everything has happened, most of the warriors that returned would definitely want to seek revenge. Why did this one suddenly apologise?

Lin Xiu couldn’t understand what was happening.

“This is a gift from us to you.”

Hai Linsheng snapped his fingers and then, there were two warriors from behind him that walked out with a chest.

When they opened the chest, Lin Xiu could clearly see that there were ten odd crystals inside the chest!

All of them were beast god odd crystals!

Lin Xiu’s eyes were opened wide as he saw what was inside.

Although Lin Xiu had already found 100 god level odd crystals in Shachang city, that was everything that that city had.

The Haiwang City wasn’t any bigger than Shachang City and it was still surprising that they were willing to take out so many god-level odd crystals.

“Are you serious about this?”

Lin Xiu finally spoke up.

This felt a little unrealistic.

“Of course.”

Hai Linsheng nodded his head.

“I shall leave these here. I am just hoping to seek forgiveness from you.”

With that said, he signalled his men.

The warriors then left the chest on the ground.

“The warriors from a few days ago, were they from your city?”

Lin Xiu stared at the rest of the warriors before asking.

“A few days ago?”

“We didn’t send anyone here.”

Hai Linsheng was a little surprised.

“It’s nothing.”

“My apologies. There has been an urgent situation back in Haiwang City which is why we came so late.”

Hai Lincheng apologise sincerely.

“We will be taking leave now.”

He slightly bowed at Lin Xiu, waved his arm to his men and left with the rest of the warriors.

Seeing how they were leaving, Lin Xiu was in shock.

These…these people really came all the way here to deliver these odd crystals?

...

“They came all the way here to deliver these?”

Lei Chong asked the same question as well.

He was surprised with what he had just witnessed.

These men came all the way here just to send these odd crystals and it was definitely something out of his imagination.

“I found it weird as well.”

Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders.

Those from Haiwang City….they actually surrendered so easily?

It has to be noted that the man that Lin Xiu killed in Haiwang City was the younger son of the city lord of Haiwang City.

“But….since they gave this to us, we shall take it then.”

Lin Xiu then signalled to Lei Chong as he stepped forward.

Lei Chong then pressed on one of the buttons on the remote.

...

The energy barrier that was around Lin Xiu then instantly disappeared.

This allowed Lin Xiu to leave and enter as he pleased.

When Lin Xiu walked out of the energy barrier, he carefully picked up the chest that was on the ground.

It was rectangular in shape, long and wide.

As he picked up the box, other than it being a little heavy, Lin Xiu did not notice anything peculiar with it.

It doesn’t look like those people were up to something odd.

When he opened the box, there were indeed ten god level odd crystals.

“Lei Chong, what level are you at right now?”

Lin Xiu stared at the box that held ten god level odd crystals before asking Lei Chong.

“A saint warrior!”

As Lei Chong answered the question, he was getting excited.

That’s right. For the past few days that he has been here, he has made tremendous improvement. He was already a saint warrior now!!!

This was all because Lin Xiu had given him lots of beast saint odd crystals!

He was indeed grateful toward Lin Xiu.

“Here.” Suddenly, Lin Xiu picked up 5 of the odd crystals from the chest and tossed them to Lei Chong.

Lei Chong quickly caught them when he saw what Lin Xiu was doing.

“This…”

As he stared at the odd crystals in his hands, Lei Chong’s eyes were open wide in shock.

His eyes were filled with disbelief.

Lin Xiu was giving these odd crystals to him?!

“Mr Pang, you are also a saint warrior right?”

Lin Xiu continued asking.

“Yes, sir.”

Mr Pang was caught off guard. Although he has no idea why Lin Xiu would ask such things, he still nodded his head.

“Hmm…you shall have these then.”

Lin Xiu threw the rest of the odd crystals over to Mr Pang.

“City lord, this…”

Mr Pang’s eyes were wide opened as well.

Lin Xiu was giving him 5 god-level odd crystals?!

“Keep them carefully and try to make good use of these odd crystals. Hopefully you’ll become warrior gods soon.”

Then, Lin Xiu burnt the chest that used to hold the odd crystals.

Although he had no idea what these people had in mind, given how they were being sincere and even apologised, Lin Xiu decided that there was no need for them to cause trouble with these people.

“Well, looks like those were from Changqing City.”

As Lin Xiu recalled the warriors who attacked them with frosty giant swords, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Changqing City was a city one level above Lingxian City.

It was obvious that these people wouldn’t give up so easily.

These few days have been peaceful but it was highly likely that they were planning something.

It looks like they should be more careful these days.

“Lei Chong, keep these energy barriers running for as long as possible.”

Lin Xiu gave his instructions to Lei Chong.

“Of course.”

Lei Chong nodded his head respectfully.

“Both of you should head back and cultivate so that you can reach the warrior god level as soon as possible.”

Lin Xiu waved his hand.

For the past few days, Lin Xiu was busy trying out how he could control the dark energy inside him and he didn’t have the time to be bothered with those from Changqing City.

“Alright.”

Lei Chong and Mr Pang looked at each other as they could no longer suppress the excitement inside them.

With five god-level odd crystals, it wasn’t impossible for them to become warrior gods!
