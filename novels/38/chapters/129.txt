Chapter 130: Strongest skill!?

Lin Xiu’s body was as fast as lightning, he wasn’t so silly just now to let that Liu Qiang use him as cannon fodder.

Lin Xiu smelled a strange smell just now like it was used to make himself seem unafraid.

Thinking about it carefully, it was likely to be the kind of gas that drives up one’s adrenal hormones in the body.

This gas will make people’s adrenaline hormones stirred up for a short period of time, although it can improve the strength of the human body for a short period of time, it is harmful to the human body and anger would easily get into their heads, which was why those warriors would risk their lives and attack that Green Vine beast.

There was no doubt that Liu Qiang was the one making mischief.

So Lin Xiu told Zhang Yin and the rest not to charge forward to attack.

As Lin Xiu burst forth an extremely strong force, he reached that Green Vine beast in a split second!

He was as fast as the wind.

“This is mine!” Liu Qiang was surprised to see this. He was shocked by Lin Xiu’s speed but Liu Qiang’s reaction was still very fast as he waved the giant sword toward Lin Xiu!

“‘Adjudicate'” Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear with both hands and roared as the spear moved in a strange arc!

He retaliated with a force as great as Liu Qiang’s attack!

Usually, if he wasn’t in the state of ‘Fury’, he wouldn’t be confident in fighting a rank 5 warrior. 但是刚刚柳强可是全力一击攻击了那绿藤葵兽,这时候消耗了非常多的源力和力气,力量也没有那么强了.

But Liu Qiang had gone all-out on that Green Vine beast just now and used up a lot of source strength and energy, he did not have as much strength as before.

With Lin Xiu’s spear and his giant sword colliding, a loud noise resounded.

And at this moment, Liu Qiang felt a very strong force and was sent flying!

Bang––

Liu Qiang fell heavily on the ground, his chest tightened and he had a sweet taste in his throat. In the next moment, he suddenly spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Go to hell!” Liu Qiang killed a lot of warriors just now and some warriors were rushing to him at this moment!

They wanted to kill Liu Qiang, but even though Liu Qiang was injured, he was still a powerful rank 5 warrior, after all. At this moment, he scoffed and directly blew off one of the warriors’ heads with a single punch.

“Get out of here!” Lin Xiu had rushed to the front of the Green Vine beast and saw several warriors around running in his direction with their weapons.

But Lin Xiu yelled at this moment and waved the spear in his hands. In the next moment, everybody was sent flying by the impact of Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear!

Looking at this rank 6 Green Vine beast that had fallen to the ground, Lin Xiu did not hesitate to pierce his spear directly into its body. In the next moment, he released the ‘Awe of the phoenix’!

Rumbling——

The rank 6 Green Vine beast let out a loud cry as a large number of flames broke out on its body.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 6 Green Vine beast. You’ve gained the 8,888,888 experience!”

This Green Vine beast wasn’t dead yet!?

Lin Xiu was pleasantly surprised at this moment – what a great bargain!

Previously, due to the BUG in the system, his damage to warriors who were higher-ranking than himself was less than 40 percent and only allowed him to gain one-tenth of the experience.

But it didn’t state that it applies to evolved beasts!

More than eight million experience points!

Lin Xiu was extremely surprised but soon calmed down. On closer look, the body of the rank 6 Green Vine beast seemed to be afraid of fire and he even released ‘Awe of the phoenix’. At this moment, its huge body had shrunk.

Lin Xiu used force and dug out a light blue palm-sized round Odd Crystal!

It’s so big!?

Lin Xiu was shocked to see this.

“That’s mine!!!” Liu Qiang, who was at the back, had already killed those warriors around. Some warriors who had turned into zombies were charging toward Zhang Yin’s side and they were struggling hard.

Liu Qiang looked at Lin Xiu and rushed over toward him with his giant sword.

Lin Xiu responded quickly and kept the huge Odd Crystal in his backpack.

Then, he used the body of the Dark Edge spear to block Liu Qiang’s rapid chopping.

Dang dang dang——

Liu Qiang’s offensive was very strong and was frantically attacking Lin Xiu with his sword. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth. Liu Qiang was indeed a rank 5 warrior, he was simply too strong and Lin Xiu was slightly taken aback.

Lin Xiu continued resisting and felt his hands getting numb.

“Hehe, a rank 3 warrior like you actually dare to snatch my stuff!” Liu Qiang was a rank 5 warrior and ‘Disguise’ didn’t work on him, he could easily sense Lin Xiu’s strength.

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers!’

Lin Xiu’s pupil constricted and after blocking Liu Qiang’s attack, he seized the opportunity to fight back!

As soon as he released the ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’, the Dark Edge spear seemed to respond sympathetically and made a sound.

Liu Qiang was startled at this moment, he did not think that a rank 3 warrior would have such strength!

But he reacted quickly and immediately used the wide body of his sword to block.

Dang dang dang——

With a chilling flash, Lin Xiu did not know how many times he had thrust out but only felt the spear knocking against the broad sword, making sounds of metal colliding, accompanied by a large number of sparks.

“Take that! Check out my strongest skill——…!” Lin Xiu roared after using the ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’.

Liu Qiang was shocked when he heard Lin Xiu saying ‘strongest skill’ – he had a stronger skill!?

He immediately wanted to block, but at the next moment, he felt Lin Xiu’s aura getting away from him.

I’ve been fooled!?

Liu Qiang who came to his senses turned around to see Lin Xiu running in the other direction!

How silly, he thought that I would really use a skill.

While running, Lin Xiu curled his lips but he glanced behind instinctively and found Liu Qiang running at a very fast speed!

Bang——

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and at the next moment, he put force against the iron door that he just went through and the thick, rectangular iron door was pushed open by Lin Xiu!

“Trying to flee!??? Not so easy!!!”
