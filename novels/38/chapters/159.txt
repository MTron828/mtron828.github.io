Chapter 160: 20th Floor

Although he had a heavy build, his speed was very fast.

Lin Xiu let out a cold snort at this time, then dodged him easily by turning his body slightly!

After training in the Gravity Room just now, Lin Xiu felt as if he had been enlightened. According to the direction of his attack and the flow of wind when he attacked, and other factors, Lin Xiu could judge the position of his next punch. It was very easy. He just had to dodge it.

Bang——

His huge fist hit the ground directly and the entire arena seemed to shake.

“Ou Zhen had cultivated ‘Rupturing Fist’ before. If this freshman is hit by that blow, he would probably be seriously injured.” Some students who knew Ou Zhen commented while watching the scene in the arena.

When Lin Xiu dodged his attack, he also discovered that the skill used by this man was the same as his own ‘Rupturing Fist’!

And when he used the ‘Rupturing Fist’, the surrounding air seemed to produce a sound of explosion.

This man’s skill should be just as powerful as Lin Xiu’s.

“Where are you going, huh!” Ou Zhen roared and his huge fists attacked Lin Xiu!

At this moment, he was already a little angry. Lin Xiu kept dodging and there was no way for him to hit him.

He also used the body skill at this moment, but he just couldn’t keep up with Lin Xiu’s pace.

More importantly, Lin Xiu was carrying a big spear box behind his back and this seemed like Lin Xiu was despising him!

Bang bang bang——

As he waved his fist wildly, the surrounding air produced explosion sounds.

“Goodbye.” Lin Xiu had already figured out his attack sequence and in the next moment, as Lin Xiu avoided his attacks, he instantly appeared behind the man!

‘Rupturing Fist’!

As Lin Xiu threw a punch, the gloves turned red.

And coupled with the power of ‘Tiger Strength Fist’, the power of this punch has reached the extreme!

But Ou Zhen was a rank 4 warrior, after all. At this moment, he reacted quickly and slammed Lin Xiu’s fist with his backhand!

Boom——

Both of them used ‘Rupturing Fist’, but because Ou Zhen only attacked with his backhand, he did not realize the power of Lin Xiu’s fist!

The two fists hit each other and suddenly there was an explosive sound.

Lin Xiu was still standing in the same spot, while Ou Zhen’s body flew out directly at this moment!

Boom——

As his whole body fell heavily below the arena, the students around were all in a daze.

One punch, just one punch and he won?

Especially the man who just said that Lin Xiu would lose – he was completely dumbfounded at this moment.

Lin Xiu ignored these people and directly took the pass card and proceed to the second floor to fight.

The decoration on the second floor was still the same as that of the first floor, but the number of people was obviously reduced.

Starting from this floor, Lin Xiu also began to take out his Dark Edge spear and fight seriously.

The second floor, the third floor, the fourth floor…

Lin Xiu became more and more courageous at this moment, and the number of floors rose crazily.

“Look! The freshman has already reached the tenth floor!” At this moment, on the big screen outside, some people saw Lin Xiu’s name and an avatar next to his name, and they were in shock.

“How is it possible! He’s too lucky eh!?” The man with the combat strength goggles walked out annoyed after losing on the second floor. When he saw this scene, his jaw dropped.

Is there a problem with this pair of goggles!?

Just now, he clearly saw that Lin Xiu was only about the strength of a rank 3 warrior, and his combat strength was only about 3,000!

And what was even more surprising was that Lin Xiu’s ranking on the freshman list suddenly jumped to 10th!

He was on the 13th floor now!

At this moment, he had attracted many people’s attention.

He didn’t stop on the 13th floor and quickly proceeded to the 14th floor, the 15th floor…

He seemed to be advancing all the way!

“Damn! Is he still a human! He had already gone through 20 floors! When that guy registered, I saw that he was only a rank 3 warrior!!!” Some seniors could not help but curse.

Hu——

Standing on the 20th floor of the arena, Lin Xiu clearly felt a trace of fatigue.

He was lucky when he was on the 19th floor. The warrior who was against him seemed to have been injured, but he was still very strong. Putting his all in the battle, Lin Xiu managed to win.

But this 20th floor was probably going to be challenging.

Lin Xiu looked at the man who was grinning in front of him and instinctively felt an aura of danger.

“ID1257855,余毅对阵ID9814126林修!”

“ID1257855, Yu Yi vs. ID9814126 Lin Xiu!”

Lin Xiu looked at the man in front of him and his whole body tensed up.

He was unliked those people from before; this person was probably terrifyingly strong. If he’s not wrong, this guy was probably at the pinnacle of the fifth rank.

Under normal circumstances, Lin Xiu wouldn’t be able to beat him, but this kind of battle in the arena does not necessarily rely on fighting, sometimes it depends on intelligence.

He must win!

“Haha, two freshmen have already challenged me today. You are the third one, but it seems that your strength is weaker than theirs.” Yu Yi said with a smile while looking at Lin Xiu.

He was able to deal with the two battles today with all his strength and he was surprised by the strength of the freshmen in this intake.

But what was even more surprising was that now, a rank 3 warrior reached the 20th floor!?

“Maybe the weaker ones won?” Lin Xiu smiled and said at this time.

Lin Xiu was now delaying time to recover the energy he just used up.

“Are you trying to drag time? Nevermind, I will wait for you to regain your energy before fighting with you.” Yu Yi said with a smile.

There weren’t many people watching the battles on the upper floors, but there were 3D cameras around, and the battle would be recorded live. You could find and watch the battle recordings on the official website according to the date and time.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, this man saw through his tactic as expected.

“Let me tell you, I have already lost two games on this floor, which means that two people have defeated me. If I lose another game, I will have to start from scratch.” Yu Yi said helplessly.

If he loses, he would lose the 20th floor reward points which was a pity for him.

“So in this round, I will not be nice.”

“Come on, then!” Lin Xiu shouted sharply, then held his Dark Edge spear and attacked!
