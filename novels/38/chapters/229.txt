Chapter 230: Overlord Spear Art

As soon as Luo Yue said that, she ignored Lin Xiu and walked away.

Looking at Luo Yue leaving, Lin Xiu was a little bit dumbfounded. She was really as arrogant as before. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Lin Xiu thought about it and shook his head, then sat cross-legged on the ground.

Holding the ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’ card, Lin Xiu sat on the ground.

Without hesitation, he put this skill card on his forehead.

But Lin Xiu found it strange that when the card was placed on his forehead, no skill information flooded into his mind.

“Damn!”

After trying several times in a row, there was still no effect and Lin Xiu cursed.

This is a scam eh? How can there be no effects at all? Could it be that he was just like those students in the Sacred Region Academy and couldn’t master this skill!?

Lin Xiu frowned and felt a little regretful. He didn’t believe it just now but now it seems that this skill card really cannot be used!

No, I don’t believe it!

Lin Xiu was also a little annoyed at this time and continued to put the skill card on his forehead.

He was completely focused on his forehead and activated the source strength in his body to flood into this skill card.

But it was as if a stone sinking into the sea and nothing happened at all.

Just when Lin Xiu was about to give up, he heard the system prompt, “Unknown energy found, does Master want to absorb it?”

At this time, the clear voice of the system rang out and the Engulf skill seemed to light up too.

Choose to Engulf!

Lin Xiu was overjoyed when he heard the prompt and chose to accept without hesitation.

“Ding!”

“The Engulf skill is activating…”

“0.1%… 0.2%”

At this moment, Lin Xiu found that there was a progress bar on the system interface, which appeared to be downloading slowly.

Lin Xiu held his breath. This ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’ skill card was still placed on his forehead and he did not put it down.

Because Lin Xiu knew that the ‘Engulf’ skill must be absorbing the contents of this skill card.

It seemed that there were more and more magical effects after the ‘Engulf’ skill leveled up.

Time passed bit by bit. When Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, he found that the progress bar on the system interface was showing 100%!

“Ding!”

“The absorption is completed!”

As soon as the prompt in the system resounded, Lin Xiu felt a lot of information had rushed into his mind from this skill card.

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide because the information rushed into his mind all at once and his head felt a little painful at this time.

Damn…

He gritted his teeth. After some time, Lin Xiu finally composed himself and panted heavily.

Click——

The skill card that was originally on Lin Xiu’s forehead had fallen to the ground at this time.

Lin Xiu took a closer look and realized this skill card has become dull, just like an ordinary skill card would.

Phew——

Before Lin Xiu could even heave a sigh of relief, he saw his surroundings change suddenly.

He was suddenly in a war-torn world from the first-person point of view.

A man was holding a long spear that gave off light in the dark night and he suddenly jumped from the fortress. Then, he suddenly thrust the spear and a white dragon-shaped energy body was instantly released from the spear. The crowd across was instantly annihilated in an instant!

“Hu”

This terrifying scene made Lin Xiu sweat all over and he quickly returned to his senses from the strange scene.

Looking around, Lin Xiu let out a sigh of relief.

What happened just now? Why did he see those things?

Could it be that… this is some information that was stored in this skill card?

Before Lin Xiu had the time to think about it, the skill information of ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’ rushed into his mind.

In a short moment, Lin Xiu was extremely familiar with the content of this skill.

This skill… was much stronger than those he learned before!

It could be regarded as the gold skill that was closest to a diamond skill!

And the power of this skill at its later stage seemed to be comparable to a diamond skill!

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment, then took out another skill card.

‘Overlord Spear Art’

Luo Yue and that old man said that if used together, it would allow this skill to become stronger which made sense.

Lin Xiu didn’t think much about it and put the ‘Overlord Spear Art’ card on his forehead.

It was different from the ‘Dragon Wrecks the City’ skill card from before. As soon as he used this ‘Overlord Spear Art’, a large amount of skill information poured into his head.

It didn’t take long for Lin Xiu to absorb all the skill information into his mind.

After absorbing the information from two cards in a row, Lin Xiu’s head was still hurting a little at this time.

Lin Xiu stood up and thought about the ‘Overlord Spear Art’ skill – he was still quite taken aback by it.

This spear art and the spear art he used before had their differences.

The general spear arts was a coordination of attacking and blocking.

But this spear art emphasizes on attacking, the entire spear art has no defense and only offense!

It was simply the spear art of ‘either you die, or I die’.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, then held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and waved the spear according to the spear art information in his mind!

Clang clang clang——

With the use of the Overlord Spear Art, this Dark Edge spear made a sound and it began to shake.

Boom boom——

The spear danced and there were explosions in the air.

The ground shook slightly.

What an overbearing spear art!

And when Lin Xiu was trying to use the ‘Dragon Wrecks the City’ skill, a louder sound echoed and Lin Xiu was stunned.

His chest felt tight as a mouth of blood spurted out!

Dang–

The spear touched the ground and Lin Xiu was panting as he looked at the blood he spat out.

This skill was truly powerful. When he swung the spear, the impact generated even affected him!

“Damn…” Lin Xiu wiped the blood from his lips. If he continued to practice like this, he would have died before he could even master the spear art and skill!
