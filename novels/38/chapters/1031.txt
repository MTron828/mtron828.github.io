Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

These odd crystals were easily found on Namir Planet.

With Lin Xiu’s current strength, it was a piece of cake to kill a beast emperor.

Before he came back to earth and was preparing odd crystals to be used on the teleportation device, Lin Xiu had already killed a large number of evolved beasts.

“This is…”

Baili Tao looked at the odd crystal that Lin Xiu gave to him and he was shocked.

“This is a high grade crystal, Sir. You are now at the peak of a rank 9 warrior. Absorb this and you will be able to break through it.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

“This….this is too much…”

Baili Tao shook his head as he looked at the crystal in Lin Xiu’s hand.

He could feel the immense amount of energy coming from the crystal.

For years, he had never seen such a powerful odd crystal.

“No. I can get crystals like these easily. I can get them whenever I want.”

Lin Xiu shook his head as well.

“Here.”

Lin Xiu then placed the beast emperor’s odd crystal into Baili Tao’s palm.

Baili Tao stopped refusing it as well and accepted the odd crystal. He looked at Lin Xiu and asked, “What are your plans now?”

“I’ll be heading back to Namir Planet.”

Lin Xiu thought about it before answering him.

Luo Yue was brought to another place known as the ‘Warrior God Realm’.

He had no idea where that place is.

Therefore, he has decided to head back to Namir Planet first and get his hands on the Orchid of Heaven before looking for Luo Yue.

“Alright. Be careful.”

Baili Tao nodded his head.

Lin Xiu smiled and waved his hand once again. Then, a small mountain of odd crystals appeared on Baili Tao’s table.

“This…”

Seeing how there was a bunch of beast king odd crystals before his eyes, Baili Tao’s eyes were wide open.

Baili Tao was already shocked by one beast emperor’s odd crystal and now that there was a mountain of beat king’s odd crystals, he was speechless.

Although the beast king was not as good as the beat emperor…

The quantity of it beats the quality!

There was a mountain of beast king odd crystals!

Lin Xiu smiled.

These off crystals should be enough for the Sacred Region Academy to produce a large group of powerful warriors.

“That’s all for now. Let’s meet soon, Sir.”

With that said, Lin Xiu disappeared into thin air.

“This boy…”

With Lin Xiu suddenly disappearing and the mountain of odd crystals on his table, Baili Tao couldn’t help but chuckle.

Lin Xiu’s abilities were so powerful now that it was shocking.

“But…..Haoling should be the same as well since she has the unique physique…”

Baili Tao mumbled to himself.

Lin Xiu took a stroll around the campus, reminiscing the days where he was also a student before leaving the academy.

The warriors on earth seem to be growing stronger as well.

Even the energy in the air on earth was getting thicker.

Although Lin Xiu was a little surprised, there wasn’t much time for him to stay.

“Tsk tsk….so this is Ouyang Hang from the Ouyang family? Is this what you’ve got?”

In one corner of Sky City, Ouyang Hang was being forced onto one of the corners.

He wiped off the blood from the corner of his mouth and stared at the men before him with eyes filled with dissatisfaction.

He was already a rank 8 warrior but these men before him, managed to become rank 9 warriors even when they were the same age!

“Who’s the one who sent you here?”

Ouyang Hang glared at the men and asked.

Although he knew he couldn’t fight these men, he wasn’t ready to give up just yet.

“Hmm? No one. I just didn’t feel happy once I saw your face.”

One of them sneered as he spoke to Ouyang Hang.

As for the rest of them, they grabbed their weapons and surrounded Ouyang Hang.

The weapons in their hands were glowing with a cold bright glow.

“You’re planning on killing me?”

Ouyang Hang’s pupil shrank when he saw what was about to happen.

Initially, he thought that they just wanted to teach him a lesson but from the looks of it now, they were planning to kill him.

“Hmm….well, you can’t blame us for this.”

“Kill him!”

One of the men raised his arm and all of them started attacking Ouyang Hang together!

Crap!

Ouyang Hang had a bad feeling about it.

All of them were rank 9 warriors. He may be a rank 8 warrior but he was much weaker than them.

“Tsktsk….Ouyang Hang, I didn’t think that you would still be the same after so long.”

Suddenly, a voice came from the sky.

This….?!

When he heard the familiar voice, Ouyang Hang was confused.

He quickly looked up into the sky and saw a familiar figure in the air.

“Who are you?!”

The warriors who were about to kill Ouyang Hang noticed Lin Xiu as well. When they saw that he was floating in the air, all of them were shocked.

This man…..he’s just floating in the air?!

“Bastard!”

Ouyang Hang swore at Lin Xiu but he bursted into laughter the next minute.

Lin Xiu laughed as well.

He didn’t think that he would meet Ouyang Hang here.

And….it looks like Ouyang Hang was in trouble.

“You better come and help or else I’m screwed!”

Ouyang Hang wasn’t bothered about his ego and immediately asked for help.

“Hmph! No one would be able to save you!”

Suddenly, one of the men from earlier started attacking Ouyang Hang once again.

They were determined to kill Ouyang Hang and all of them were using all of the energy that they had.

Just as they were about to touch Ouyang Hang, a semi transparent array appeared.

Ouyang Hang’s body was then trapped inside the array.

“This…”

Ouyang Hang was confused as well when he looked at his surroundings.

Then, there was a surge of warrior skill energy that rushed towards him!

Boom – –

The entire ground started shaking vigorously.

“Hmph! You’re dead now.”

The warriors from before looked at Ouyang Hang with a hideous smile on their faces.

All of them have released their warrior skills and it would be impossible for him to survive this.

Even if he had released his ‘sphere’, he would not be able to stop it.

But, as the thick smoke disappeared, the semi-transparent array appeared before their eyes.

Ouyang Hang was still standing inside the array, unharmed!

What on earth?!

When they saw what happened, all of them were shocked as they couldn’t believe their eyes.
