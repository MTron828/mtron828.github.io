Chapter 39: Rank 1 Warrior!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

After thinking for a bit, Lin Xiu added 6 potential points into speed and increased it to 60 points, and pumped the rest into strength, increasing it to 111 points.

Right at this moment, his overall combat strength increased to 800 points!

“Ding~~~ Congratulations Master for attaining 800 combat strength, rewarding the title ‘Rank 1 Warrior’!”

‘Title? What’s that?’

Lin Xiu was stunned and discovered another segment in his stats board:

Title: Rank 1 Warrior ( Passive skill: Under attack, rage value will increase faster.)

Lin Xiu did not know whether to laugh or cry when he saw the effect, it turned out that he had to be beaten.

But Lin Xiu felt that it was good, power-up strike relied on the increasing rage value from the damage received by his enemies and could only be used when the rage build-up was at its maximum. As he increased the strength of his body, he was unable to utilize the skill as he required even more serious injuries to build up the rage counter. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Rank 2 zombies?!” Xu Wen walked over and saw the zombie corpses lying on the floor and frowned.

These zombies were completely unlike rank 1 zombies. They were fast and posed a sufficient threat to warriors.

Who would have thought that Lin Xiu could get rid of all of them!?

“Damn, Lin Xiu, you’re good!” Li Yi exclaimed in surprise when he saw the scene.

“Roar!” Just as he finished talking, a black figure jumped down from above, followed by a bone-chilling roar!

Xu Wen reacted quickly and brandished his battle saber and slashed upwards!

Bang!

Just as the figure closed in on Li Yi, it was sliced into two, and blood was drawn as some even splattered on Li Yi’s body.

“Careful, don’t die.” Xu Wen glanced at Li Yi and advised.

“Thanks.” Li Yi patted his own chest, he was still able to feel the lingering fear.

The zombie that was sliced in two opened its large mouth and revealed its sharp teeth.

Upon thinking about how close he was to being bitten and becoming like that, he felt his scalp go numb.

“Careful, something else is coming.” Lin Xiu looked around and said cautiously.

The street was truly weird, it seemed to hide many terrifying creatures that were waiting for them in the darkness.

Xu Wen already walked forward while the group followed along and remained cautious.

“It’s just these zombies, isn’t the mission too easy?” A few soldiers did not care about Lin Xiu’s advice. Aside from the zombies that they had encountered, they did not meet others and started to relax.

“Indeed, I thought that Guang Ming Fort will have even more zombies and monsters.” Another soldier nodded his head in agreement.

They were scared to death when they were chosen.

A total of five cities had dispatched soldiers with 40 per city, all of which were warriors.

It was said less than 10 soldiers that participated in the Operation clean-up out of the 40 sent from every city annually would return.

There were even instances when the entire group was wiped out. This goes to show how high the mortality rate was.

“You guys better be careful. I don’t care if you die here.” Xu Wen snorted coldly.

“Yes, captain.” The soldiers complied verbally but did not take it to heart.

They were thinking of searching the town again. If there were no zombies or evolved beasts, they could return early, right?

Li Yi was tense due to what had happened. He would look around occasionally and hold onto his weapon tightly, unwilling to relax himself.

“Something’s approaching.” Xu Wen suddenly saw something at a corner and warned.

Approaching? What’s approaching?

A soldier that was closer was startled as a few figures charged at him!

Fast, extremely fast!

Before the soldier could even react, a pale and rotten face zombie was already on him!

It opened its large mouth and breathed out a repulsive breath before biting down on his neck!

“Go and die!” Under immense fear, he used his pair of short blades in his hand and stabbed it in the zombie’s chest.

Bang!

Blood spurted out from the zombie’s body, but it did not seem to care about being struck and instead continued biting on the soldier’s neck!

As he was a distance from the front, Lin Xiu and Xu Wen were unable to save him.

The zombie’s mouth was like a meat grinder. In a short span of time, it had finished eating the soldier’s neck and the head dropped onto the ground.

This terrifying scene caused all the relaxed soldiers to be horrified.

This was when they finally regained their senses, this was not a game, it was a life or death mission!

Lin Xiu thrust his spear towards that zombie that wanted to eat the soldier’s body.

Xu Wen charged forward and performed several quick slashes at the other zombies that were approaching.

Lin Xiu felt uncomfortable seeing how young the soldier was. He was alive a second ago but had died just like that.

“Their heads are the weak point, otherwise even if you burst their hearts, they won’t die.” Lin Xiu penetrated his spear into another zombie’s head and explained.

Maybe it was the blood from the soldier that died, but many of the zombies were attracted over.

Right at this time, heavy footsteps could be heard from all around them.

“What is that?” A soldier trembled and asked when he saw figures in the distance.

“Zombies?!”

“They are all rank 2 zombies!” Lin Xiu saw the dense cluster of figures and felt his scalp go numb. The horde was too terrifying.

It was no wonder he kept sensing something was wrong. It turned out that there were many rank 2 zombies hiding!

“Prepare the laser guns!” Xu Wen’s expression changed as he roared.

Upon hearing the order, Li Yi immediately drew out his laser gun and shot at the horde.

But the number of zombies was too terrifying. Only exploding their heads could work.

Lin Xiu held his spear and charged forward, imbuing source strength into Silver Immortal Soul. This caused the spear tip to emit a cold aura.

He exerted power in his arm and thrust forward, directly slicing off five zombie heads.

A row of zombie’s heads dropped to the ground.

“No, you can’t use the laser guns!”
