1388 Fighting the Frost Dragon (Part 1)

clack clack——

The bodies of the two had just been frozen into ice sculptures. The next moment, with crisp sounds, the ice sculptures burst open.

“It’s pretty cold.”

Lin Xiu said at this time. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

!!

“It’s really cold.”

Zhang Xiuxian smiled and the next moment, the two walked directly inside.

Behind this door is an ice and snow tunnel, which doesn’t look very long.

As the two of them walked inside, they soon entered the extremely spacious space inside.

It’s like coming to a world of ice and snow.

It turns out that this door is actually a passage leading to another dimension.

Not sure who could forcibly open up so much space.

Because according to the situation here, behind each of the other doors is a huge space.

“Do you see it?”

Zhang Xiuxian looked toward the front and there was a purple light cluster over there.

There were a large number of ice crystals in front of this light group.

On these ice crystals, there appeared a large number of fruits that seemed to be wrapped in ice and snow.

“That’s the origin of the ice. What I need is the frost fruit.”

Although the ice source is good, it is indeed very difficult to absorb it. If you are not careful, you will have to risk your life.

So he also thought very clearly, he needed the Frost Fruit.

Finally found.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly as he looked at the ice source.

Although the golden spear is not bad now, compared to his Dark Edge, the Dark Edge spear was still much better!

“What about the Frost Dragon?”

Lin Xiu looked at Zhang Xiuxian.

“I don’t know, where should I hide it.”

Zhang Xiuxian held the saber in his hand and looked around cautiously.

Back then, the giant frost dragon was so powerful that many warrior gods who came to this gate were all killed.

He also escaped by chance.

Thinking about it now, it seems that there was still a shadow in his heart.

Hu——

At this moment, Lin Xiu took a deep breath, moved his body, and rushed directly to the front!

Just when Lin Xiu rushed in front of the ice source and was about to reach out to touch the it, he suddenly felt an extremely strong icy air rushing toward him!

Click——

Lin Xiu’s body was also frozen into an ice sculpture at this moment.

And at this moment, a huge ice crystal-like tail swept across directly.

Lin Xiu, who had turned into an ice sculpture, was smashed into countless pieces.

Seeing this scene, Zhang Xiuxian froze in place.

Lin Xiu… just died like this!?

His eyes were full of disbelief.

Before, Lin Xiu was a powerful existence who was able to fight against the young master of the Royal Beast Sect, forcing his divine sense to come out.

So vulnerable?

“What are you looking at? It’s about to wake up.”

At this moment, a voice came from the other side.

Taking a closer look, he clearly saw Lin Xiu’s figure appearing on the other side.

“You’re not dead!?”

Zhang Xiuxian’s eyes widened and his eyes were full of disbelief.

Just now, Lin Xiu was obviously turned into an ice sculpture, then was broken into countless pieces…

Roar–

Before he could think too much, at this moment, an incomparably loud roar came over.

The whole space seemed to vibrate.

Taking a closer look, the iceberg behind the ice source was actually the giant frost dragon!

It’s just lying on the ground, so it looks like an iceberg!

At this time, it just woke up and its huge tail swept directly toward Lin Xiu and Zhang Xiuxian.

Both of them reacted very quickly at this time and they dodged in an instant.

...

Boom——

There was a loud noise all around.

The entire body of this giant frost dragon seems to be made of frost.

As its pair of frosty wings waved, its body was also suspended in the air.

Roar–

It let out a loud roar and extremely cold air rushed toward Lin Xiu and Zhang Xiuxian in an instant.

The figures of the two were instantly frozen again.

But after turning into ice sculptures, the two broke free in an instant.

“Hng!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and the next moment, the golden spear in his hand started to dance.

Boom, boom, boom——

...

With the dancing of the spear, there were streaks of dark blue hellfire charging toward the frost giant dragon.

After absorbing the real source flame of the hellfire, the hellfire that Lin Xiu released now became obviously stronger!

Roar–

As the huge flaming birds hit the body of the frost giant dragon, it immediately burst into loud roars.

The hellfire directly melted a lot of frost on its body.

Seeing this scene, Zhang Xiuxian also had a look of joy on his face.

He wanted to come with Lin Xiu because he knew that what Lin Xiu could major in was fire attribute power.

At this time, Zhang Xiuxian didn’t stop the movements in his hands. He held his own saber and leaped up as soon as he moved his body.

Jumped directly behind the body of the frost dragon.

Holding the battle in his hand, he stabbed directly at the back of the Frost Dragon!

boom–

Because the source strength of his body was poured into his sword, his sword became extremely sharp.

At this moment, it easily pierced through the back of the giant frost dragon.

“ah!!!”

He roared loudly, all the muscles in his body tensed and with a sudden forceful stroke, he was about to slash open the back of the Frost Dragon!

Bang bang bang——

But at this moment, a large number of sharp ice thorns stabbed out from the back of the Frost Dragon’s body.

Zhang Xiuxian obviously noticed this scene, drew out his saber, and jumped up directly.

He also took a deep breath at this moment. At that moment just now, if he hadn’t reacted quickly enough, he might have been directly pierced through the body by the ice thorns that burst out from behind the giant frost dragon.

At this time, his eyes turned to the other side and he saw that Lin Xiu followed the dark blue flaming birds and continued to charge toward the frost dragon.

At this time, the giant frost dragon spouted terrifying icy air from its mouth and the terrifying hellfire became weaker due to the influence of this icy air.

Although these dark blue flames hit the body of the frost dragon, they did not cause much damage to it.

But at this time, Lin Xiu, who was holding a long spear, had already rushed past at an extremely fast speed!

Boom——

Lin Xiu, who was holding a long spear, directly pierced through the wings of the frost dragon.

A huge hole suddenly appeared on the huge frosty wing on its right.

“very good!”

Zhang Xiuxian saw this scene at this time and as the source strength of his body was mobilized, there was a sudden gust of wind!
