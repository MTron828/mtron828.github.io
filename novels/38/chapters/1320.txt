1321 See You at the Finals

What Xiao Qingchen had shown earlier was incredibly terrifying.

He had a fearful look in his eyes as he stared at Xiao Qingchen.

Sizzling– –

There were countless currants that gathered around Xiao Qingchen’s machete.

Before Peng Wei was able to do anything, Xiao Qingchen rushed forward with his machete that was completely enveloped by thick lightning bolts.

Xiu – –

Xiao Qingchen moved quickly and within a split second, he appeared right in front of Peng Wei!

The machete that was filled with the horrifying currants was headed toward him!

Peng Wei had a change to expression. Then, his body turned into a black fog and disappeared into thin air once again.

Xiao Qingchen completely missed his shot!

“Hmm?”

Xiao Qingchen furrowed his brow when he noticed what had happened.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

At the same time, there was a sharp ice pick that was aimed at him.

Xiao Qingchen quickly moved his machete and blocked the attack from the ice pick without any delay.

“Damn it…”

Peng Wei quickly ran and headed onto the other side of the stage.

He stood right in front of Zhao Xintong, who had been burnt to his core and was now left with a body of bones.

Peng Wei instantly looked ghastly pale.

Then, with the control of his mind, there was a bright purple glow that appeared on his forehead.

An ice element sourcemark!

The temperature of the air around them drastically dropped.

Crack crack – –

The entire ground beneath them was slowly covered with ice. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Plus, they stretched far and wide and even extended onto Xiao Qingchen’s body.

Soon, Xiao Qingchen’s body was completely covered with ice!

“That wouldn’t do much.”

Lin Xiu, who was watching the match, muttered to himself.

The ice element skills that Peng Wei released with the help of his sourcemark wasn’t powerful enough to defeat Xiao Qingchen.

It wouldn’t bring much effect.

“Huuu…”

Peng Wei quickly let out a breath of relief when he saw how he managed to trap Xiao Qingchen in a thick layer of ice.

The look on his face turned hideous as he said, “That’s it from you….? I thought you were someone powerful?”

With that said, he turned into a black fog once again and went straight towards Xiao Qingchen.

When he got close, he returned to his physical self and this time, he had a spear in his hand. He aimed it at Xiao Qingchen’s head and drove it straight through!

Go to hell!

Peng Wei cursed loudly in his heart.

Crack crack– –

However, the ice statue cracked open at the same time!

Xiao Qingchen sneered as his machete flew out of his hand!

He managed to block away the spear that was aimed at his head!

The machete with the terrifying currants went straight into Peng Wei’s body!

Peng Wei’s eyes were opened wide. At this moment, he wanted to scream but he could no longer do so.

These lightning bolts were horrible!

Plus, Xiao Qingchen did not think of stopping. He held onto the machete with both hands and swung it at Peng Wei!

NOOOOO!!!!!

Peng Wei’s eyes were opened wide as he roared in his heart.

Boom – –

Before he knew it, his body had been chopped into two halves.

Blood splattered everywhere.

All of the audience were stunned at the scene before their eyes.

Frightened. All of them were terrified of what they saw.

This man had completely stomped on his opponent with his overpowering strength!

“Match over! Xiao Qingchen, Victory!”

...

Then, the announcer quickly reported on the results of the match.

“Xiao Qingchen!”

“Xiao Qingchen is the best!”

The rest of the audience finally came back to their senses and once again, the entire place was filled with cheers.

“He does have the abilities to be the champion.”

Riyan God King thought to himself.

Xiao Qingchen was indeed powerful. He initially had his eyes on Lin Xiu but with what Xiao Qingchen has shown earlier, there was a high chance that he might win this time.

“Xiao Qingchen is indeed a strong warrior.”

Wan Gan nodded his head as well.

“I think Yuan Zhen is just as good.”

Zhang Qinghua suddenly thought of one of the participants from earlier.

...

Most men then started discussing.

Compared to the other warriors, Lin Xiu was not the brightest star.

No one sided with Lin Xiu.

Xiao Qingchen, who was on stage, wiped off the blood that was all over his face and jumped off the stage.

As he returned to the seat that was allocated for the participants, he stopped when he walked past Lin Xiu.

Then, he turned and looked at Lin Xiu.

“I have a feeling that you’re strong and your abilities are not only what you showed us.”

His eyes were fixed on Lin Xiu when he said this.

Lin Xiu was a little shocked when he suddenly heard such words from Xiao Qingchen.

“I will see you at the finals.”

Before Lin Xiu could say anything, Xiao Qingchen smiled and left.

He believed in his own instincts.

They were telling him that Lin Xiu was not as simple as how he looked.

“Interesting.”

Lin Xiu stared at Xiao Qingchen who left.

“But….I’m afraid that you won’t make it to the finals.”

One of the warriors next to Lin Xiu stared at the screen above them and commented in a cold tone.

Lin Xiu ignored him and stayed on the screen as well.

Only 2 will enter into the finals from the remaining 6 participants.

There will be another three man battle!

The last one standing will then enter the final.

For those who are still alive after these matches, they will be allowed to continue fighting to get their placings.

Only the champion will be rewarded with the Metal of Thousands Years Old!

It is said that this piece of metal was formed thousands of years ago.

It definitely is something incredible.

Lin Xiu specifically came for this material.

“Only the champion would be able to get it?”

Initially, Lin Xiu thought that those who were in the top three would be able to get them.

However, from the looks of it now, only the champion would be rewarded with it!

Suddenly, Lin Xiu felt a little pressured.

“It’s another three man battle.”

Baili Haoling saw how the contest would continue and she couldn’t help but frowned.

In a three man battle, if two parties decided to become allies, the remaining one would be in big trouble.

Unless they were like Xiao Qingchen with absolute strength and power; or else, it would be quite difficult for one to win against the other two.

“I’m sure City Lord will win the battle!”

Lei Chong spoke in a serious tone.

He had confidence in Lin Xiu.

“It looked like he would have to stop here.”

The middle aged man that sat next to Baili Haoling spoke again.

“Uncle! What do you mean by that?!”

Lei Chong was unhappy with what the man said.

“You look the same age as me.”

The middle aged man peered at Lei Chong before commenting about his looks.

“You!!!!”

Lei Chong’s eyes were wide open. He had just turned thirty but this man looked like he’s in his forties!!!!

“Well….you do look old.”
