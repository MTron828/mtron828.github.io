Chapter 685 Fight!

Lin Xiu instinctively clenched the long spear in his hand, and looked behind him.

“All squat down for me, or I will kill you without mercy!”

A loud roar came from outside.

Some people who wanted to run out were directly penetrated by laser rays one after another.

Several corpses suddenly lay on the ground. The people around them all squatted down with their heads down, and they didn’t dare to make any more movements at all. “What a bunch of pariahs!”

These men in fine battle suits looked at these people and said coldly.

“Quick see if those people are inside!”

A burly man said to one of his companions.

“It’s over! It’s their people!”

When Chen Lan and others saw this scene, the expressions in their eyes suddenly changed greatly.

Because these people who appeared now are the accomplices of those people who wanted to capture them tonight, but were killed by Lin Xiu!

Lei Tong’s eyes widened at this time, and he had no idea that these people would appear here.

Obviously, they were here to seek revenge! “It’s them!”

After a man’s eyes glanced at the people around him who were holding their heads and squatting, as soon as he looked up, he found Lin Xiu and the others nearby!

“Kill them!”

Whoosh whoosh

At this moment, these people directly pulled the trigger in their hands, and in the next moment, a large number of laser rays shot at Lin Xiu and the others!

Dang dang

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly, and the Dark Edge spear in his hand swung frantically, actually blocking all those laser rays.

“You guys go to the back.”

Lin Xiu said to Lei Tong and the others, and in the next moment, he charged forward with the spear in his hand!

“Courting death!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu dared to rush over, these people became furious, and the laser beams shot towards Lin Xiu frantically.

But Lin Xiu was holding the Dark Edge spear, and while rushing over, he blocked all those laser rays.

Soon, he rushed in front of one of the men.

“You…” When the man saw this scene, his eyes widened, and when he was about to make a move, Lin Xiu’s spear pierced his head.

“Kill him!”

When the others saw this scene, they also dropped the laser guns in their hands, took out their weapons, and attacked Lin Xiu from all directions!

Boom boom boom —

om –

The strength of these people wsa quite good, and there were actually several rank 8 warriors.

“You guys go!”

When Lin Xiu was fighting against these people, he shouted loudly.

These people were obviously targeting him alone and the rest of them were implicated by him.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s roar, those who were squatting on the ground with their heads down, saw that these people were fighting against Lin Xiu. They quickly came to their senses and ran away.

“Pariahs! Kneel down!!!”

A burly man with a huge warhammer was about to smash Lin Xiu’s from behind

Boom–

But just as the warhammer in his hand was about to hit Lin Xiu’s head, a dark red ‘Sphere’ spread out on Lin Xiu’s body, blocking his attack.

The warhammer attacked Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, making a dull sound, but it did not shake Lin Xiu in the slightest.

How is this possible!

When the man saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

How can there be such a powerful existence among these pariahs! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At this time, Lin Xiu’s face also became serious, and a terrifying source strength burst out from his body. Boom boom boom —

There were a lot of dark red flames in the spear, and as Lin Xiu waved it, flaming birds burst out one after another. “What!!!”

Some weaker warriors were attacked by the flame bird at this time, and in the next moment, they let out a wailing and miserable cry.

What kind of skill is this!?

These men felt the terrifying temperature from the flame, and the expressions in their eyes changed greatly.

The three rank 8 warriors all dodged, but the remaining ones were all hit by the flaming birds.

A wailing and screaming sound came out continuously, and they fell to the ground, rolling frantically.

But no matter how they rolled, they couldn’t put out the flames on their bodies.

Soon, some people were directly burned into black charcoal by the flames.

“Who the hell are you!”

The remaining three rank 8 warriors stood in a row, holding the weapons in their hands and looking at Lin Xiu, who was not far away, and shouted loudly.

How could this lowly pariah have such a powerful power! “I’m not a so-called ‘Pariah’.”

Lin Xiu said with a sneer.

In the next moment, before they could react, he held the spear in his hand and rushed towards them!

When these three saw this scene, the expressions in their eyes changed greatly. They directly unfolded the ‘Sphere’, and then fought against Lin Xiu!

“Brother Lei, is Brother Lin really from your earth…”

Chen Lan and the others were at the back, and their eyes widened in shock when they saw this scene.

If they were surprised by the strength that Lin Xiu showed in the alley before, the strength that Lin Xiu showed now was simply a huge shock to them.

Because in their opinion, apart from the people from the Marqi planet, it was impossible for the people on Earth to have such a powerful strength.

Under the siege of three rank 8 warriors, he was still able to handle it with ease.

Could it be that Lin Xiu is a rank 9 warrior!?

“Damn!!!”

These three rank 8 warriors wanted to kill Lin Xiu, but their attacks were all blocked by Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

And as their weapons attacked Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, some lightning suddenly passed from their weapons to their bodies, causing their bodies to become paralyzed.

‘Tiger descends the mountain’!

Lin Xiu let out a low roar, and the source strength in his body transformed into a giant tiger!

With the sweep of the spear in his hand, it was as if a sharp claw swiped sharply. These people’s “Spheres” were all slashed by Lin Xiu’s spear! This is impossible!

The three rank 8 warriors opened their eyes wide as they looked at their ‘Sphere’ that had been broken open.

They roared in their hearts.

But Lin Xiu’s offensive has not stopped. At this time, after the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was stabbed out, it turned into countless spear shadows.

Boom boom boom —

A loud noise sounded, and the bodies of the three rank 8 warriors all flew out.

As their bodies fell to the ground, they could clearly find that there were a lot of blood holes on their bodies, as if they were stabbed dozens or hundreds of times with a long spear in just a short moment!

Extraordinarily terrifying!

“Lin… Brother Lin…”

Lei Tong’s eyes widened at this time – he wasn’t shocked by Lin Xiu’s strength but Lin Xiu’s appearance seemed to have changed!
