Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

The surrounding audience could no longer see the silhouettes of Lin Xiu and Nan Huang. They could only see the two colliding frantically like black and white shadows, then separated and collided again.

“Get lost!”

In the next moment, Lin Xiu roared angrily. At this moment, the Dark Edge spear he held in both hands slashed horizontally. The body of the spear was directly on the body of Nan Huang, and his body was directly knocked out!

Pff—

After Nan Huang stabilized himself, he spat out a mouthful of blood directly.

He opened his eyes wide and looked at the blood he spit out, his eyes filled with disbelief.

He was Nan Huang, a more talented warrior than Yu Muchen.

He was actually shot out and injured by a country bumpkin?

Nan Huang’s face became hideous, and his right hand tightly clenched his spear.

“I won’t lose!”

He roared, and at this time, a huge animal claw appeared from the field on the ground and grabbed Lin Xiu’s back!

Boom–

But Lin Xiu seemed to have eyes behind his back, he waved the spear in his hand to the back, and the huge claws formed by the energy body were directly scattered away.

Now Lin Xiu’s body still has white light emitting, and he looked like a god.

‘The power provided by the power of the stars to Lin Xiu was really too powerful, so powerful that even Lin Xiu himself was in a bit of a disbelief.

“You will die for me!!!”

At this time, Nan Huang roared angrily, and the spear in his hand continued to stab Lin Xiu.

And at this moment, the spear he was holding turned into a huge spear phantom, full of terrifying energy.

Lin Xiu saw this scene without the slightest fear, nor did he dodge.

He charged directly toward the huge spear!

“Break!”

‘The Dark Edge spear held by Lin Xiu in both hands burst into red light. With the force of Lin Xiu’s hands, he directly shattered the huge spear phantom!

Pff—

Nan Huang seemed to be backlashed. In the next moment, he took a few steps back and was about to spit out a mouthful of blood, but forcibly suppressed it.

When Lin Xiu was about to rush to Nan Huang’s side, his body leaped.

“Tiger on the ground’!

Lin Xiu roared in the air, and the source strength in his entire body surged, as if he transformed into a huge tiger, charging from the sky!

“Get out of here!!!”

Looking at this scene, Nan Huang shouted with a ghastly expression.

He didn’t dodge, and holding his own weapon, he was about to fight against Lin Xiu, who was rushing down like a giant tiger in the air.

He was the strongest, he can’t possibly lose!

Boom—

But just as Lin Xiu charged down, the tiger phantom roared loudly, and as Lin Xiu charged down, he threw Nan Huang to the ground!

Boom—

This time, the entire ground shook even more strongly.

Ahuge dent appeared on this extremely hard competition platform.

‘Taking a closer look at this time, Nan Huang’s body fell to the ground, and there was blood flowing from his lips.

There were a lot of holes in the suit on his body.

His eyes were wide open, and his face seemed to be in disbelief.

Swoosh—

At this time, Lin Xiu’s spear had already touched his neck.

The cold feeling of the spearhead made Nan Huang more awake.

“This is your strength huh?”

Lin Xiu, whose whole body was still glowing with a faint white light, looked at him and said aloud.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Nan Huang’s face became extremely grim.

Looking at Lin Xiu, his eyes were filled with incomparable resentment.

He originally despised the ant who could be easily crushed by him, but at this time it actually defeated him?

“It’s impossible…it’s impossible!”

Nan Huang roared loudly.

His body wanted to move, but it couldn’t move at all.

Because he could feel it, the powerful strength of Lin Xiu’s skills just now shattered the bones of his body!

Now he could only look at Lin Xiu with his eyes. If his eyes could kill, Lin Xiu would have been killed countless times.

“Goodbye.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes erupted with infinite killing intent.

At the beginning, he was the one who wanted to kill him at Thunder Valley.

But now, he was no longer the weak person he used to be. Even in Sky City, he could still fight against these so-called geniuses!

As soon as Lin Xiu used force on his Dark Edge spear, it would directly pierce his neck!

“Stop!

At this moment, a loud voice resounded. Lin Xiu, who originally wanted to wave the spear in his hand and stab Nan Huang’s neck to end his life, felt a terrifying shock. The power rushed towards him!

Lin Xiu didn’t have time to attack, so he dodged quickly.

And at this time, where Lin Xiu was just now, a huge white energy ball rushed over and directly smashed into the ground.

‘An old man appeared beside Nan Huang at this time.

“Grandpa…Grandpa…”

Nan Huang looked at the old man, his eyes were full of surprise.

At that moment, he almost thought he was going to be killed.

Although he was arrogant, he would not remain indifferent in the face of death.

“This is the platform.”

After Lin Xiu dodged at this time, he saw that a deep pit appeared on the ground and he couldn’t help but feel lingering fears. His powerful skills just now could only leave a shallow depression on the ground at most.

But the old man’s attack was able to smash the ground.

“You want to kill him?”

‘The old man ignored the uproar from the surrounding audience and the people on the rostrum, as he looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“Once we’re on the platform, life or death didn’t matter.”

Lin Xiu looked at him and said without any fear.

“What a great statement.”

The old man sneered at this time.

“You people in Sky City, are you all like this? If the younger one can’t do it, the older one would come and help. If you guys can’t afford to lose, better not to come up here.”

Lin Xiu laughed.

“Especially a self-righteous old man like you, I have a word for you.”

“T’ve never seen a brazen person like you!”

“Boy, go to hell!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s sarcastic voice, the old man’s expression changed greatly, he reached out and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

“Old man, get out of here!”

Just as he rushed over, a figure appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

Before Lin Xiu could react, he realized that the old man had been kicked out!

Who is this!? Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Lin Xiu couldn’t help being shocked when he saw this scene. The strength of the old man was very terrifying. It could be said that he was a peak rank 9 warrior, but he was kicked out like this!?
