Chapter 124: Relics

At the next moment, a ray of light shot out and Lin Xiu saw a chilling blade coming across.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate. He clenched the long spear tightly and hacked down in that direction

Dang——

The sound of metals colliding resounded and two sabers were broken by Lin Xiu.

“Senior, please show mercy!”

Just moments after Lin Xiu retaliated, a voice came from the back.

Lin Xiu knitted his brows, and upon taking on a closer look, weren’t these four people the ones he met just now?

Why were they here?

Gu lu.

The man standing at the front saw Lin Xiu’s spear tip against his neck and swallowed his saliva. If Lin Xiu moved slightly, there would be a hole in his neck.

“Why are you guys here?” Lin Xiu put down the Dark Edge spear in his hand down and asked doubtfully.

“We walked over there and somehow fell down here,” Zhang Yin said with a bitter smile.

He and the two men next to him were holding special miniature flashlights, but the light was so dazzling that everything around him was illuminated.

“We’re really fated, huh. Let me introduce them – this is my girlfriend Lei Lei and my friends Peng Yu and Jiang Li.” Zhang Yin said with a smile.

“Hello.” The dark-skinned girl named Lei Lei said nervously to Lin Xiu.

“Do you know where this is?” Lin Xiu nodded, then looked at Zhang Yin and asked.

“Relics that were left over from the year 2554.” Zhang Yin nodded and answered.

“I found some time stamps on the iron wall in front.”

“You’ve already walked there?” Lin Xiu continued to speak.

The relics of the year 2554 – a big war broke out in the previous era so it was likely that this Path of Death was formed after the war. Lin Xiu wondered how many secrets were buried underground?

“Yes, we’ve been walking from that direction.” Zhang Yin nodded.

“Is there anything strange about it?”

“No, there are still iron walls on all sides.” Zhang Yin shook his head, this place was like an endless tunnel.

Lin Xiu frowned. “That can’t be, I’ve been walking over from the other side and I haven’t found anything either.”

They were also surprised when Lin Xiu said that.

“So what do we do now?” A big and strong guy called Jiang Li picked up the sabers that Lin Xiu hit and asked doubtfully.

“No, if we go on like this, we would never get out.” Lin Xiu shook his head, this place was too strange.

Lin Xiu pointed to the bodies of some Gold Rats on the ground behind him and said, “See those things? I killed those Gold Rats about half an hour ago but I’m back here again.”

He intentionally used those Gold Rat’s bodies as a notation.

What he didn’t expect was that even though he kept walking, he still somehow returned to the same place again.

But he clearly walked a straight road! It was too strange how he returned to where he came from.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Zhang Yin and the others began thinking as well.

“What should we do, then? We’re not going to be stuck here all our lives, are we?” Peng Yu was a thin man and looked frightened at this moment.

“Have you ever seen anything like this?” Lin Xiu touched the iron wall and could see that there were many dents on it, forming a strange pattern.

“I haven’t seen it at all.” Zhang Yin shook his head and took out his cell phone, but there wasn’t any signal underground.

One must know that in Year 2666, the wireless network had already covered the world, you could get a signal in any corner and up to 50 meters deep underground, but there wasn’t any signal in this tunnel.

“I think it might have something to do with these things.” Lin Xiu said faintly.

He pondered for a moment then took out a gold Odd Crystal.

“I was also thinking if there’s somewhere to insert a crystal but couldn’t find any grooves at all.” Seeing Lin Xiu’s action, Zhang Yin and the others said out loud.

Not only could the power inside an Odd Crystal be extracted and converted into source strength, but it was also the new energy of the modern world; many cars, as well as laser guns, could be activated by inserting an Odd Crystal in it.

Lin Xiu looked carefully at the pattern and knitted his brows.

Around the Year 2554… it was when Odd Crystals began to be used in a large number of industrial technology, so the relics of this era should be able to be activated using Odd Crystals… Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu took the Odd Crystal and pressed against this bronze-like iron plate. In the next moment, that Odd Crystal went into the dent!

“Damn!!!”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but exclaim when he saw this strange sight.

At the same time, there was a sound like something was starting up.

The markings on the blue iron walls gave off a dazzling white light at this moment and the entire place lit up.

At this moment, Lin Xiu took off the night vision on his face.

“Oh my…” Zhang Yin and the others were taken aback.

They didn’t expect that there was really a place to insert the Odd Crystal and it seemed that it was a hidden spot. Someone who didn’t know the spot wouldn’t be able to activate it at all.

Lin Xiu placed his right hand on this iron wall, and then with a little force, he pressed on something on top.

Rumble rumble——

The surrounding iron wall turned like a square block and when the front part turned, everything before their eyes turned pitch-black.

But they quickly turned on the flashlights and saw that the front side was no longer a tunnel, but rather a strange core base.

There were a lot of electronic apparatuses around, but most surprisingly, there were many huge glass containers in the middle and they even had some human bodies soaked in them.

Zhang Yin and the others were astonished and stood rooted to the ground but Lin Xiu ignored them and walked over.

He saw many electronic components scattered on the ground and there was a smell of decay too. He saw some strange branches from time to time and some skulls too.

Lin Xiu looked around and there were many Odd Crystal grooves on top of a huge machine.

Without a second thought, Lin Xiu took out a few Odd Crystals and placed them inside. In the next moment, the apparatuses around the place it up.
