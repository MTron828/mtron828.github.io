Chapter 463: Lin Xiu Asleep

Lin Xiu entered his system interface, looked at all the systems that he had

and all of the other functions but noticed that none of them could help him with his current situation.

Damn it, was he going to end up dying in the stomach of this creature?

As this thought popped into this head, Lin Xiu was dissatisfied about it.

However, at that moment, Lin Xiu saw the last function in the system interface that was in this mind.

This was…

On the other hand, Luo Yue, who was outside of the creature, was still attacking the furious black whale like a crazy person.

Lin Xiu was still attacking the whale from inside and it had an effect on him. Due to Lin Xiu’s attack, the creature felt an intense pain coming from its abdomen and its body was shaking frantically which gave Luo Yue even more chance to attack it.

The furious black whale’s eyes had already burst by now.

Plus, it was busy shaking and twisting its body around as there were already a lot of wounds on its body.

Luo Yue looked at the large amount of pale blood color blood that was seeping out of the whale’s body. Seeing how the furious black whale was already looking exhausted, she took a deep breath and swam towards it. With both daggers in her arms, there was a bright white light that was coming from it and a cross formed by the dagger, she aimed it towards the whale!

Boom – –

With a large noise, the crossed slash instantly turned into two large forms of energy and was dashing towards the whale.

The furious whale had already lost both its eyes which is why it wasn’t able to dodge the attack. Its entire body was hit by the scary energy and its body was instantly chopped into several pieces.

Suddenly, there was a large amount of pale blue blood that surrounded the water.

Luo Yue quickly swam towards the pieces and started looking around. Soon, she found a familiar figure that was next to the body of the furious black whale that had been chopped into pieces.

When she saw who it was, her eyes lit up with hope. She swam towards it and quickly picked up the body that was sinking towards the seabed.

Lin Xiu was no longer conscious. Luo Yue wanted to call him but because of the helmet that she had on and she was now underwater, it was impossible for her to make any sounds.

When she noticed how there were lots of dark blue odd crystals that were falling as well, Luo Yue picked them up as well

Luo Yue didn’t have time to think. She picked up Lin Xiu with one hand and swam towards the surface with her other hand.

The number of mutant creatures on the shore was slowly getting lesser by now.

Although it was a terrifying scene seeing so many mutant creatures crawling onto the shore, a large number of them had been successfully eliminated with the help of the students and teachers from the Sacred Region Academy.

In the end, the attack of the mutant creatures slowly dissolved on its own. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“It’s finally over.” When Dean Baili saw the scene before him, he let out a breath of relief and wiped off the sweat that was all over his forehead.

Even if he was a rank 9 warrior, it still wasn’t easy for him to deal with thousands of mutant creatures at the same time.

This time, they would have gotten rid of most of the mutant creatures that were hidden under the sea.

“The energy was just sufficient.” Not only did Dean Baili feel relieved, but the staff in the control room were also relieved as well.

This time, the duration of the protective cover being activated was extremely long and it had been attacked by a huge number of mutant creatures. This would take up a lot of energy.

At the main gates of the Sacred Region Academy, there was a large number of staff who were getting rid of the bodies of the mutant creatures.

Thousands of bodies were seen everywhere and there was a huge amount of rank 6 odd crystals all over the shore.

Dean Baili looked over to the waters and suddenly thought of something which caused him to remain frozen at the same spot.

Soon, there was a figure that was slowly moving towards the shore.

The one that appeared was Luo Yue. There were still a few mutant creatures around them who wanted to attack her but with a slash from her dagger, all of the creatures were killed.

Then, she placed the dagger into her pocket, removed the helmet and threw it onto the ground.

She carried Lin Xiu with both her arms and walked towards the academy.

“Oh? You’re back?” Dean Baili smoothed out his voice before asking.

Luo Yue was still as cold as usual while Lin Xiu looked bad.

All of the clothes that he had on had been corroded and if he looked closely, his fingers and some parts of his body had been corroded as well. He could see Lin Xiu’s bloody bone and flesh and it looked horrifying.

He got injured?!

Dean Baili was stunned when he saw the boy’s condition.

“I told you that I will be coming for you if anything happens to him.” Luo Yue remained emotionless, but as she walked past Dean Baili, her entire body was filled with a murderous aura.

Dean Baili remained stunned. Seeing how Luo Yue was carrying Lin Xiu’s body, he couldn’t help but shake his head. Then, he touched his beard and smiled.

“The ones from the Luo family always have the same personality.”

“But this boy is extremely lucky.”

Dean Baili muttered to himself.

With the help of Luo Yue who carried him, Lin Xiu quickly got to the treatment room.

The medics who were there were shocked to find such terrifying burnt wounds that were all over Lin Xiu.

There have been several accidents where a person’s body was burnt by acid but for the years that they have been in the Sacred Region Academy, there have never seen one that was as bad as Lin Xiu, where they could see the bones.

But, for the world that they were in, it wasn’t too difficult for them to deal with such a situation.

Time passed by and after being treated for an entire day, Lin Xiu’s body was entirely covered by bandages. He was lying on the bed comfortably and he was given a drip that had a peculiar blue fluid.

It has already been three days but Lin Xiu still showed no signs of being awake.

Luo Yue sat by his side motionlessly and was looking at Lin Xiu.

“Has Lin Xiu woken up?” Most of them from the tenth class had already heard of Lin Xiu being severely injured and everyone from their class had already paid him a visit in the treatment room.

It was early in the morning when Nan Zhengjun came to the hospital. He noticed that Luo Yue was still in the same position and she was still staring at Lin Xiu.

Luo Yue shook her head. She didn’t say a single word.

Seeing how Luo Yue was, Nan Zhengjun sighed and said, “You should head back and rest as well.”

Luo Yue has been in this position since the first day. She hasn’t rested since then. Even if she had the stronger body amongst the warriors, she would no longer tolerate this any longer.

“It’s alright.” Luo Yue answered while she remained emotionless.

“Doctor, how is he?” Zheng Nanjun asked when a man in a white coat walked into the room.
