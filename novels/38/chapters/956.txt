Chapter 957: One Step Away

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Wow, I didn’t think that there would still be so much more sourcemark carved here.”

In a place far away from the Wildfire City, Lin Xiu was looking above at the source marks on the historical remains.

The remains had a variety of source marks carved onto it.

Plus, they looked extremely complicated and some of them seemed to have been left behind since ancient times.

This place was one of the ancient historical remains found on the Namir Planet.

After that day where he fought with Huang Fulin, Zhao Rui, Heilong and Bailong…

He couldn’t kill them even when he had already used his best skills.

And he ended up getting severely injured as well.

In the end, he had no other choice but to use the teleportation ring and transported himself into a river.

As he flowed down the river, he found himself waking up to this city.

That’s how he found this ancient place.

The injuries that he had sustained were slowly healing by now.

It was quite a waste of an opportunity that he didn’t get to kill any of them that day.

......

Otherwise, he would have gathered enough EXP to level up.

“Such a waste.”

Lin Xiu stared at the marks on the remains and shook his head.

“Hmm? Brother Lin, you’re still here?”

A familiar voice suddenly appeared.

“Wang Qiang.”

Lin Xiu turned around and saw the man that he had just befriended.

This man’s body was a little muscular with a honest looking face.

“HAHAHAHAHA….Brother Lin! You have been here for days. Did you figure out anything?”

Wang Qiang laughed as he walked towards Lin Xiu.

“I was just looking around.”

Lin Xiu chuckled.

Wang Qiang was the one who found him by the shore when he woke up and was also the one who took Lin Xiu in. He even allowed Lin Xiu to stay with him.

In conclusion, Lin Xiu was grateful towards Wang Qiang.

“These are markings from ancient times and most of them seem to be carved by the sage warriors from a long time ago.”

“There’s usually a crowd here every year but no one could understand what is written on it.”

Wang Qiang told Lin Xiu what he knew about the place.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes. They might not be able to understand but he could.

This was because of his analytical eyes. These historical remains have left behind many unique ancient energy

When the analytical eyes noticed their energy, Lin Xiu had quickly absorbed them into his body with the skill – ‘engulf’.

Therefore, he was coming back everyday in order to absorb more of these energy.

Not only did he manage to recover from his energy, he even upgraded his level!

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but smile when he read through his stats.

He was only one level away. He would be able to be a sage warrior as long as he completed the next level.

He was one step away.

Then, he will return to the Wildfire City and all of them shall die!

“Move aside! Move!”

Just when Lin Xiu was deep in thoughts, there was a busting noise coming from outside.

“Move aside.”

When he turned around, he saw Wang Qiang being pushed aside by another muscular man and Wang Qing ended up hitting hard on the wall behind him.

“You…”

Wang Qiang stared at the man but when he saw who was behind the muscular man, he became quiet.

“Young Master An is here to take a look at the historical remains. All you lowly peasants, leave!”

The man who had pushed Wang Qing spoke as he took a look around.

Those who came to view these historical remains weren’t all powerful people, there were lots of ordinary warriors who wanted to visit these remains as well.

They wanted to have a look at it and perhaps they may be able to gain something from it.

It would definitely change their future.

“The one over there. Can’t you hear me? I said move!”

The man that had just pushed Wang Qiang noticed that Lin Xiu was still standing at the same spot. He frowned and quickly walked towards Lin Xiu.

He raised his fist and planted it on Lin Xiu’s face.

Boom – –

Just when his fist was about to hit Lin Xiu’s face, it was stopped by Lin Xiu’s right hand that had grabbed onto his fist.

“You…..!”

He glared at Lin Xiu and he was shocked.

This was because he realised that his fist felt that they were being clamped by a metal prong and he couldn’t move!

“You’re dead!!!”

The man got furious.

From his point of view, Lin Xiu was just an ordinary man but he had the balls to fight him.

Just when he raised his other hand, wanting to hit Lin Xiu on the head, Lin Xiu suddenly moved

Lin Xiu’s left hand grabbed the man’s head and pushed him against the wall.

Boom – – Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The man’s head crashed directly against one of the rocks nearby.

The rest of the warriors who were being chased away were shocked.

They never thought that Lin Xiu would fight back.

“Wang Qiang, are you alright?”

Lin Xiu walked towards Wang Qiang and helped him get on his feet.

“I’m fine.”

Wang Qiang shook his head.

The other man had pushed him and he knocked against the wall but he was fine.

“Brother Lin, you should leave now. Those are the men from the An family. Once they get here, you will be in big trouble…”

Wang Qiang suddenly thought of something and reminded Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was already there for days but Wang Qiang still had no idea of how powerful Lin Xiu was.

Although he had just witnessed Lin Xiu pushing that bad into a rock, he still thought that the An family was scarier and quickly told Lin Xiu about it.

“Is this family that caused you to lose all your money?”

Lin Xiu asked flatly.

He did not feel frightened at all.

“En.”

After hearing Lin Xiu’s question, Wang Qiangw as reminded of it and he clenched his fist together.

He was furious but he didn’t have enough strength to fight the An family!

“Move aside! Move!”

“Young Master An is here!”

Then, there were loud screams coming from behind them.

Lin Xiu looked up and there was an arrogant man that came into the view who was surrounded by a large number of warriors around him.
