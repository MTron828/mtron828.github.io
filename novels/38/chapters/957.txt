Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Where’s Ah Fu?!’

“Why didn’t you clean this place up?!”

The man, known as An Da, walked into the place as he shouted.

He looked around and noticed the man earlier had his head pushed into one of the rocks.

“Who did this?!”

When he noticed it, An Da widened his eyes in shock.

There was someone in this city that had the guts to lay hands on his men!

“Wang Qiang? You dog!”

An Da noticed Wang Qiang, who was standing next to Lin Xiu, and screamed at the top of his voice.

Wang Qiang was looking mad but he didn’t dare open his mouth.

“Do you want to fight him?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he asked Wang Qiang. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Fight him…?”

......

Wang Qiang was stunned as he didn’t think that Lin Xiu would say such things.

“Do you dare to do so?”

Lin Xiu continued asking.

“Of course!”

Wang Qiang answered furiously.

But…..An Da was a king warrior!

He wasn’t a match!

“That’s all I need to know.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Useless dog, who is this?!”

An Da looked at Lin Xiu as he frowned.

As he looked at Lin Xiu, he had a weird feeling about it.

“On your knees.”

Lin Xiu said calmly as he looked at An Da.

“How dare you…!”

An Da got furious when he heard what Lin Xiu said.

However, before he could finish, there was an overpowering pressure from above him.

Then, his knees were on the ground.

He couldn’t move at all!

“Go ahead. Hit him.”

Lin Xiu said to Wang Qiang.

Wang Qiang’s eyes were opened wide as An Da was now kneeling before him!

“Ohhhh…”

Wang Qiang finally came back to his senses after being called by Lin Xiu.

As he looked at An Da, Wang Qiang remembered what he had been through and was starting to get angry.

“An Da, you were the one that caused my family…”

Wang Qiang clenched onto his fist and they could hear the sounds of his cracking knuckles.

“Get him!”

An Da was shivering and he was trying to get up but he noticed that he couldn’t move even an inch of his body!

What was happening?!

He was a warrior king! How could this happen to him?!

As he shouted, all of his men, who were standing behind him, quickly rushed towards Wang Qiang.

“Move.”

Lin Xiu said flatly.

With that, all of the men were thrown aside by some unknown and invincible power.

No! It’s impossible!

An Da couldn’t believe his eyes!

Perhaps….he was a respected warrior?!

He didn’t even have the time to think. Wang Qiang was already running towards him and his fist landed directly on An Da’s head.

“AHHHHHHH!!!”

An Da noticed that he couldn’t use any of his energy. He couldn’t even release his ‘sphere’ and took the blow physically which brought intense pain.

“Wang Qiang! Both of you are dead!”

An Da screamed in rage.

When was the last time someone ever laid hands on him?! When was the last time he had to suffer like this?!

His eyes were filled with murderous intentions.

However, he couldn’t move at all and had to bear with the pain coming from Wang Qiang’s fist.

“I’m sorry…..I’m terribly sorry…”

An Da, who was an arrogant man previously, was now carrying a swollen face full of bruises and even lost two of his teeth.

“Hmph!”

Wang Qiang gave one final kick and stopped.

After that, he finally cleared his mind and got worried.

He felt much better after teaching An Da a lesson but from here onwards, he would have to face the revenge from An Da and that would be a lot of trouble.

“Brother Lin, you should leave the city now.”

Wang Qiang thought about it before telling Lin Xiu.

The An family was powerful, especially in this city.

After what had happened, they would be going after him and would definitely hunt for Lin Xiu as well.

“What’s wrong? You’re afraid that you’ll trouble me?”

Lin Xiu smirked as he asked.

“The An family is strong. I’m worried…”

“Don’t worry. You have me now and the An family is nothing.”

Lin Xiu peered at An Da.

Now, An Da’s eyes were only filled with fear.

“But…”

“Join the Tianjiao Competition.”

Lin Xiu shook his hand as he told Wang Qiang.

The Tianjiao Competition was one of the largest events in the western part of the planet.

The top 100 warriors would be allowed to cultivate in one of the most ancient spaces left behind by the sage warriors from a long time ago.

This competition only happens once in a decade. Every single warrior that entered into space would come back much stronger with a leap in their ranks!

“I’ll team up with you.”

Lin Xiu suggested it when Wang Qiang was still in a daze.

For this competition, it would be in teams of two.

“But…I’m worried that I might be a hassle…”

“Are you going or not?”

Lin Xiu did not say much and continued asking.

“Yes!”

Wang Qiang clenched his jaw and gave a final answer.

“Also…..”

“What is it?”

Seeing how there was a change in the look in Wang Qiang’s eyes, Lin Xiu got curious.

“Brother Lin, please be my master!”

Wang Qiang got on his knees and asked Lin Xiu.

Ever since they met, Wang Qiang had a feeling that Lin Xiu was no ordinary man.

Especially after how Lin Xiu had shown his skills earlier, An Da didn’t even have the chance to defend himself.

Lin Xiu must definitely be a very powerful person.

Lin Xiu was now offering him a chance and if he didn’t hold onto it, he would be an idiot.

“Get up.”

Lin Xiu waved his hands and Wang Qiang was forced on his feet.

“Brother Lin…”

“I’ll accept.”

Lin Xiu said slowly.

Back in the Marqi Planet, Lin Xiu already had two apprentices. That’s when Lin Xiu realised that his mastering points were still growing.

These points could be exchanged for something else.

Wang Qiang was an honest man and his physique wasn’t too bad. There was no reason for him to say no.

“Master!”

After hearing that Lin Xiu had accepted him as his apprentice, Wang Qiang screamed out of excitement.

“Let’s go. We still have to prepare for the match.”

Lin Xiu said flatly to his new apprentice.

“Yes, master!”

When Lin Xiu and Wang Qiang had finally left, the pressure that has been holding down An Da finally disappeared.

“Young Master…!”

The rest of his men finally got to him.

“Move!”

When he was surrounded by his men, he screamed in rage.

However, as soon as he did that, he felt the pain coming from his cheeks.

He glared at the exit that Lin Xiu and Wang Qiang took and his eyes looked vicious.

“The Tianjiao Competition? I’ll make sure that you’ll end up dead
