However, at this time, some of the audience who had just been on the rooftop seemed to have started to leave and walked over.

“Let’s go for a walk, shall we?”

Lin Xiu saw the eyes of those people at this time and they were looking at him and Luo Yue.

Luo Yue nodded and walked to the other side together with Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu walked side by side on the road, his heartbeat seemed to be beating much faster.

And Luo Yue looked at it at this time, her little hand was still being held by Lin Xiu and she didn’t seem to let go.

This made Luo Yue’s cheeks a little hot.

This peculiar feeling was something Luo Yue had never experienced in her more than ten years of life.

“The moon is quite round tonight.”

Lin Xiu also felt that he was a little nervous and didn’t know what to say.

“En”

Luo Yue nodded at this time.

“By the way, I’m going back to the Sacred Region Academy tomorrow, will you go back with me?”

After continuing to walk for a while, Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue who was standing beside him and said aloud.

Luo Yue was stunned, as if she remembered the bits and pieces of the past and nodded her head at this time.

“Do you remember when we first met?”

“At that time, you were really fierce. You almost killed me.”

Lin Xiu also remembered the first time he saw Luo Yue, the past seemed like yesterday.

“It’s your fault – you didn’t look like a good person.”

Luo Yue also spoke a little playfully at this time.

It seemed that Luo Yue, who always had a cold expression on her face, has also undergone a change at this time.

‘This change made Lin Xiu very happy.

It was as if he had melted an iceberg.

“Tsk, I was the one who saved you that time.”

Lin Xiu continued to speak at this time.

While the two were talking, Luo Yue also showed a rare smile.

“Come on!”

However, when the two walked to the front, Luo Yue’s face changed suddenly and the look in his eyes changed.

Gol?

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment and when he reacted, he saw a bright light rushing towards him!

“Careful!”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu immediately pushed Luo Yue away and backed away himself.

Boom—

At this moment, there was a huge explosion sound where Lin Xiu was standing at just now.

Acrater exploded all over the ground.

What exactly is going on!?

Lin Xiu’s face also turned cold at this time. He turned to look behind him and saw that there were already quite a few of the buildings behind them with special laser guns that had terrifying power.

It seemed that someone wanted to snipe him.

“Hurry up!”

Luo Yue had felt that something was wrong from the beginning and at this time, she looked at the back with a cold face and then said to Lin Xiu.

After leaving the platform, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue had their weapons behind their backs. Seeing this, they immediately took their weapons.

“Go? Where are you going?”

At this moment, a voice suddenly came over.

It seemed to reverberate in the surrounding area.

‘When Lin Xiu heard the voice, the pupils in his eyes shrank a bit. He looked in front of him and he could clearly see that the figure of Nan Huang’s grandfather appearing in front of him.

At this moment, he stared at Lin Xiu, his eyes were full of killing intent.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu frowned slightly. He knew that these people would take revenge, but he didn’t expect that these people would come directly to kill him at this time.

Aren’t these guys afraid of the Warrior Union’s sanctions?

“It was this kid who killed my Jiang Feng, right?”

At this moment, from the other side, an old man with a white head and a sullen face walked out holding a warhammer with a long handle but a small hammerhead.

“It seems that your goals are the same as mine.”

And in the same way, from the front side, the Zhuo family also came.

After all, Lin Xiu killed Zhuo Qixing and the rank 9 warriors in their clan. They had already received the shocking news.

“Tl cover you, you go, in Sky City, they dare not do anything to me.”

Luo Yue stood in front of Lin Xiu with her long sword at this moment, looked at the people around her and whispered to Lin Xiu.

“Go back to the branch building of the Sacred Region Academy.”

“No, let’s go together.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

How could he ignore Luo Yue and it was too dangerous to stay here.

“Today, you guys don’t have to leave.”

Nan Huang’s grandfather looked at Luo Yue and Lin Xiu coldly and said.

At this time, his eyes looked at Luo Yue and then he said aloud, “Do you think that I won’t dare to touch the Luo family?”

“Your Luo family communicates with people in the underground world and provides them with evidence of the transaction. I know this and once the news is reported to the federal government, your Luo family, hng!”

Hearing the old man’s voice, the expression in Luo Yue’s eyes also changed.

The vast majority of people in the underground world were black households and many of them were people with many crimes. If his so-called ‘evidence’ is real, the Luo family will definitely be attacked.

“Old Monster Nan, don’t talk nonsense with them, we, the old bones, have all come out, I’ll see who I dare not kill in Sky City!”

While the old man of Zhuo’s family said coldly at this moment, in the next moment, he held the long sword in his hand and charged directly towards Lin Xiu!

Swoosh—

His speed was very fast, so fast that Lin Xiu couldn’t catch it.

‘Sphere’l!!

Under such circumstances, Lin Xiu didn’t have time to do any extra thinking, so he directly expanded his ‘Sphere’.

Boom–

‘As the ‘Sphere’ unfolded, Lin Xiu suddenly felt an extremely powerful impact, causing his body to fly straight out.

After taking a few steps back, Lin Xiu stabilized his body.

Pff—

Just as Lin Xiu stabilized his body, he felt a tightness in his chest and he vomited out a mouthful of blood.

But the old man didn’t stop at all and at this moment, he continued to pursue Lin Xiu!

Because he used ‘Fury’ on the rooftop just now, even though the sequelae had disappeared, Lin Xiu could still feel that the strength of his body had not fully recovered.

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t have time to think about it and directly activated the system’s ‘Reset’ skill again.

And while using the ‘Reset’ skill, Lin Xiu continuously used ‘Rage’ and ‘Power of the Stars’!

As soon as the skills were used, the power of the body has reached its peak in an instant!

The old man just rushed over to Lin Xiu and when he was about to attack Lin Xiu, he saw the strong light coming from Lin Xiu’s body!
