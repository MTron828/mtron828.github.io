“This warrior skill card, how much is it?”

Lin Xiu had his eyes on the card and immediately asked.

After looking at all the other cards, Lin Xiu still felt that this was one that suits him best.

He was used to using more of his strength and he was always playing with fire.

!!

“This is a god-level warrior skills card and it would cost 12 hundred million.”

The staff smiled as she reported the price to Lin Xiu.

God-level warrior skills cards were rare gems and they would be incredibly costly compared to the weapons.

“Can’t you give me a discount?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows as he asked.

“This is already the best price that we could offer. You won’t be allowed to be negotiate the price here.”

The staff spoke in an apologetic tone.

“Lin Xiu! Buy it! It looks incredible.”

Baili Haoling quickly commented on it.

“You want me to buy it so badly?”

Lin Xiu looked at her curiously and asked.

“No, I don’t.”

Baili Haoling shrugged her shoulders.

“You just think that I have more money than you now and you want me to finish up mine so that you would feel happy.”

Lin Xiu stared at Baili Haoling before speaking out what Baili Haoling had in mind.

“Cough cough…”

Baili Haoling cleared her throat after feeling awkward from being exposed.

“Alright. I’ll buy this then.”

Lin Xiu thought about it for a moment before agreeing to the purchase.

“Of course, Sir. I will wrap it up for you.”

The staff was delighted to hear what Lin Xiu said and the smile on her face grew wide.

Then, she quickly contacted the other staff so that they could take the warrior skill cards from inside the glass.

“Lin Xiu, there are so many cards here. Aren’t they afraid that they would get robbed?”

Baili Haoling whispered into Lin Xiu’s ears.

All of the warrior skill cards were being openly displayed and other than Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling, there were also other warriors who were looking at the,.

“Don’t you dare.”

Lin Xiu glared at her before giving her a warning.

Hearing what she said, Lin Xiu already knew that she had in mind as she looked at the warrior skill cards around her.

“This store is able to sell so many of the necessities for the warrior and there are so many god-level warrior skill cards here. If my assumptions are correct, they should be supported by the God King.”

“This place must be officially supported by the God King.”

Lin Xiu spoke softly.

There were so many god-level warrior skill cards here and it would definitely catch lots of attention.

If this was not the case, this store would have been robbed multiple times.

“Plus, did you notice that even the staff that served us earlier is a warrior god? Her abilities are not beneath yours.”

Lin Xiu had analysed all of the staff in the store and knew that most of them working here were skilled warriors.

Especially the one that was helping Lin Xiu retrieve the warrior skills cards from the glass shelves. Lin Xiu had scanned the man with his Analytic Eye and as he was doing so, the man raised his head and looked around. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

It was as if he could feel that someone was analysing him.

“Hmph! I never thought of doing such things.”

Baili Haoling quickly spoke out of guilt.

By now, she could also feel that most of the staff working here were warrior gods!

“Is there anything else that you need?”

The staff from before had finished wrapping up the warrior skill card that Lin Xiu had purchased.

“Do you have anything else that you want?”

Lin Xiu peered at Baili Haoling and asked.

“Would you like to sponsor one for me?”

Baili Haoling looked hopeful.

“I’m broke.”

“You’re just petty!”

After paying at the counter, Lin Xiu received a black colour box.

The box contained the god-level warrior skill card that Lin Xiu had purchased.

...

Lin Xiu had a total of 14 hundred million in his bank account and after paying for the card, he had 2 hundred million left.

However, all of the energy stones were useless for Lin Xiu and it was nothing for him to spend it so casually.

“Are you going to be training tonight?”

As they returned to the hotel, Baili Haoling asked Lin Xiu before heading to her room.

Rollie and Little Bai were both sitting on Lin Xiu’s shoulder and were both in deep sleep.

“En. The finals are tomorrow and I have to be ready for it.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Alright. I’m going back to sleep as well.”

Baili Haoling couldn’t help but yawn.

She had been injured from the previous fights and even if she could heal from her injuries, she was still feeling exhausted.

“Have a good rest.”

...

Lin Xiu smiled before heading to the training ground on the highest floor.

When Lin Xiu appeared in the training ground, all of the warriors who were cultivating looked fearful when they saw Lin Xiu. It was as if they had met a ghost and subconsciously moved away from him.

This was because Lin Xiu had shown that he was a powerful and merciless man. Most of the warriors have already heard of him by now.

“Hmm?”

“Lei Chong, you’re still training?”

Lin Xiu soon noticed Lei Chong who was also in the training ground and he was training with his machete.

With the high gravitational pull here, Lei Chong seems to be having a difficult time training here.

He could already see that Lei Chong was drenched in sweat.

“City Lord!”

Lei Chong heard someone coming from behind and quickly turned around.

“You should rest if you’re feeling tired.”

Lin Xiu smiled as he comforted Lei Chong.

Lei Chong seemed to have been triggered by what happened in the afternoon and was trying his best to improve his skills.

“I’m fine.”

Lei Chong shook his head. He thought of how useless he was in the afternoon and even ended up as the hostage! He felt incredibly guilty and shameful at the same time.

If it wasn’t because of him, Baili Haoling wouldn’t have been so severely injured.

Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling were both powerful warriors. Plus, those who were below the level of a warrior god were considered useless in this city. Lei Chong was dying to make himself better.

“That’s enough. Stop forcing yourself.”

Lin Xiu spoke to Lei Chong before walking over to another empty spot.

Then, as he pulled out the card from the black box, there was a bright glow that came from the god-level warrior skill card.

Most of the warriors noticed that bright light coming from the card and they were all incredibly surprised.

It was with no doubt that this was a god-level warrior skills card!

Most of them were filled with envy.

God-level warrior skill cards were rare and for him to be able to buy it from the store, it would have been incredibly expensive.

Lin Xiu sat cross-legged on the ground and placed the card on his forehead.

As Lin Xiu started to gather his energy, all of them rushed towards his forehead!

Soon, with his energy instilled into the warrior skill card, the card started glowing even brighter than before!
