Chapter 136: Fighting Side By Side!

“Leave by yourself.” Luo Yue looked surprised and glanced at Lin Xiu, then said indifferently.

“It’s so late at night and you’re all alone, do you know what will happen to you if you get caught by those people? It wouldn’t be as simple as death and you’re so beautiful, those people…” Lin Xiu said deliberately.

“Shut up!” Luo Yue stared coldly at Lin Xiu.

She could always contain her emotions no matter what but somehow, when she heard Lin Xiu talking this way, she really wanted to beat him up.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu hung the spear box and bag around him, then crouched in front of Luo Yue and said.

Luo Yue hesitated for a moment and thought about what Lin Xiu said, then placed her arms on his shoulder. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Lin Xiu carried her on his back very easily, his hands were placed below her knees which made Luo Yue frown as it gave her a strange feeling.

It was like a sudden ripple on the water of a calm lake.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and quickly ran in the other direction.

“Drink it, nutrient fluid.” Lin Xiu said as he walked.

Luo Yue was slightly suspicious of what Lin Xiu gave her when a round, translucent creature suddenly ran out of Lin Xiu’s backpack, it was holding a bottle of liquid in its hands and stood on Lin Xiu’s shoulder as it handed it to Luo Yue.

Looking at this little creature, Luo Yue was taken aback.

Rank 6 evolved beast!?

“This is my pet, Rollie. Don’t even think of taking the Odd Crystal in its body eh.” Lin Xiu spoke while he ran.

Luo Yue took the small glass bottle and stared at Rollie curiously.

But at this moment, Rollie seemed afraid of Luo Yue, and simply rolled back into Lin Xiu’s bag to hide.

Luo Yue paused, then opened the bottle of nutrient fluid and drank it from the bottle directly.

“Oh, I forget to tell you that I’ve drunk this thing before…” Lin Xiu said mischievously.

“Is it very fun?” Luo Yue said to the back of Lin Xiu’s head and appeared like she was looking at a retard.

The nutrient fluid must be finished within five minutes as soon as it’s opened. Otherwise, it would lose its effects – Lin Xiu was obviously bluffing.

“Not cute at all.” Lin Xiu curled his lips.

It was a little windy at night and the gravel blew against his face, making Lin Xiu itch.

“They’re coming.”

Not long after they were gone, Luo Yue suddenly spoke up.

They’re coming?

The moment Luo Yue said that, a few figures appeared at the front and back suddenly.

“Tsk tsk, I still caught up to you.” Just then, a vicious-looking man sneered.

He wore a black tiger-skin robe and appeared threatening.

The leader of the Black Tiger Bandits, Wan Hu!

“You killed more than a hundred of our Black Tiger Bandits and you want to leave just like that?” Several other men also walked over from the other side and said in a cold voice.

He trembled in fury at the thought of how many members were left in his team.

When they came close, Lin Xiu directly used the Analytic Eye and immediately knew their strength.

Five rank 3 top warriors!!!

Their combat strength was more than 3,000 each!

Lin Xiu was shocked. A rank 4 warrior was powerful, but going against a number of rank 3 warriors would still be quite tough.

He didn’t expect that Luo Yue could still escape even after killing more than a hundred of their bandits – she was terrifyingly strong.

“You guys are going to die.” Luo Yue glared at them and said icily.

Even in this current situation, they still felt a sense of threat when Luo Yue’s gaze swept across them.

“You’re still injured, you still think you can leave, huh? Or can this young man save you? Hahaha!” Wan Hu laughed loudly at this moment.

Previously, Luo Yue may have killed more than a hundred of his people, but Wan Hu also took advantage of the fact that Luo Yue had used up a lot of physical strength and successfully performed a sneak attack on her.

And in this current state, Luo Yue’s strength was only to the extent of a rank 2 warrior and wasn’t a threat to them at all!

“So much nonsense to say, huh.” Luo Yue said faintly.

“Kill that boy and let this woman live. I don’t want to kill her just like that, I want to play her to death!” Wan Hu ordered with a sinister look, the meat on his face seemed to be squeezed.

“Put me down.” Luo Yue said.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and after he put her down, he pressed the button on the spear box, and the Dark Edge spear instantly shot out!

Bang——

The man who rushed over from the side was stunned and just as he was about to block with the saber in his hand, he felt an immense force. His hand trembled and the weapon almost flew out of his hand.

Lin Xiu moved at this moment, he tossed the backpack and spear box directly on the ground and leaped to the right. Then, he grabbed the Dark Edge spear that was about to fall and thrust forward smoothly.

‘Awe of the phoenix’!!!

The man clearly wanted to block when he saw the flames coming out of Lin Xiu’s spear and spreading to the tip of the spear as several flaming birds burst forth!

“What are these!”

The man was in a state of shock, he had never seen a skill like that.

At this point, he quickly retreated, but the flaming birds seemed to be chasing him like crazy and they were very swift!

Dang dang dang——

On the other side, Luo Yue was fighting furiously with the other four warriors.

These Black Tiger Bandits did not seem to take Lin Xiu seriously, their main goal was to take down Luo Yue.

As Lin Xiu had helped her heal her wounds and replenished her nutrients, Luo Yue seemed to have recovered quite a bit.

Wan Hu gritted his teeth, he was shocked – the strength of this girl was too scary.

And her sword technique was very strong.

“Good chance!” But Luo Yue was injured after all, and even though her attack forced Wan Hu to take a few steps back, the warrior with the spear behind her stabbed Luo Yue in the back directly!

Dang——

Just when he thought he was going to get away with it, the tip of the silver spear in his hand was suddenly hit by another long black spear, and sparks flew everywhere as the tip of his spear broke!

“Are you all right?” The two people had their backs against one another and were focused on the movements of the people around them.

“Can you do it?” Luo Yue did not answer Lin Xiu’s question and said faintly.

“Of course!”
