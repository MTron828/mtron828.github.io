1360 Black Iron Tree King

“Have you come into contact with this kind of flame before?”

Seeing his expression, Lin Xiu was surprised.

“I saw it when I came to Netherworld with my master previously.”

Lu Guangyue nodded slightly at this time.

“A warrior in our group accidentally touched this kind of flame and his entire soul was annihilated!”

He seemed to recall certain scenes and his face was full of horror.

“How do you know that it can burn the soul?”

Lin Xiu said at this time.

“Believe it or not, it’s up to you. At that time, what he came into contact with was not even the source fire of the Netherworld Flame.”

Lu Guangyue said cautiously.

“How about…you give me the things first, then come to the Blackwater Mansion to get the rewards?”

At this time, Lu Guangyue hesitated a little, but still spoke up.

He didn’t expect that Lin Xiu actually wanted to find this Netherworld Flame.

This flame is really terrifying, it is simply his nightmare.

Even if Lin Xiu’s strength is good, he might die!

“Are you afraid that I won’t be able to go back?”

Lin Xiu smiled immediately, then said seriously: “Three days later, I will return to the Blackwater Mansion with the Netherworld Unicorn’s horn and its odd crystal.”

“All right.” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Lu Guangyue nodded helplessly at this time.

He was really afraid that Lin Xiu would die in the Netherworld.

But now there was nothing he could do, he himself was seriously injured and Lin Xiu’s strength is much stronger than his.

“By the way, where did you encounter Netherworld Flame?”

Lin Xiu continued to question at this time.

“Over there.”

Lu Guangyue didn’t hide anything and pointed in the left direction.

“The end over there is where the Netherworld Flame is.”

“When you get to the periphery, you will see the floating Netherworld Flame. The closer you get to the center, the stronger the Netherworld Flame will be!”

When Lu Guangyue said this, his expression became extremely serious.

He really didn’t want anything to happen to Lin Xiu.

“En, thanks.”

While making a sound, Lin Xiu walked directly in the direction he said.

“I hope he can come back alive.”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s disappearing back, Lu Guangyue smiled wryly.

The Netherworld Unicorn was killed, but whether the crystal of the Netherworld Unicorn and its horn can be obtained, they can only hope that Lin Xiu will come back alive.

At this time, Lin Xiu has already continued to go deep into the other side of the Netherworld Forest.

Whoosh whoosh——

Not long after Lin Xiu walked in that direction, he could hear the sound of breaking through the air.

“What’s that sound?”

Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows when he heard these sounds.

This sound seemed a little familiar, just like those vine tentacles just now.

Sure enough, at the next moment, the tentacle shaped like a vine charged over from the front!

“Are you here for revenge?”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu snorted coldly.

At this moment, holding the sword in his hand, he slashed over directly!

Lin Xiu picked up this sword on the ground just now and it has a pretty good blade.

As the source strength covered the sword, when the sword was swung, it immediately made a sound of piercing through the air.

The vine tentacles stabbing from the front were cut off in an instant.

Some purple blood-like liquid also splashed out.

Whoosh whoosh——

And at this moment, more and more vine tentacles continued to attack from all directions.

Seeing this scene, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed drastically.

He knows the horror of these vines. Once you’re entangled in them, the source strength of the body will seem blocked and there is no way to use it at all.

Continuously waving the weapon, a large number of vine tentacles were cut off by the sword in Lin Xiu’s hand.

But these vine tentacles, no matter how you tried to kill them, will continue to attack from all directions.

...

It was as if they couldn’t be killed no matter what.

And now Lin Xiu already felt a little tired from waving the sword.

After all, he just went through a big battle.

“I’d like to see what the hell you are…”

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something at this time and with a thought, when those vines charged over again, he directly used ‘Mirror Image’!

boom–

After a vine tentacle entangled one of Lin Xiu’s clones, it dragged it directly to the depths of the forest at an extremely fast speed.

Lin Xiu’s real body held his breath at this time, shielding all the source strength in his body, then directly chased after the clone that was pulled to the depths of the forest by the vine tentacles.

Soon, after Lin Xiu chased for a distance, he could clearly see that those vine tentacles seemed to be released by a tree!

The big tree was about the same size as the surrounding big trees, but it had dark branches, and its roots were not rooted in the ground but gushed out of the ground.

Obviously, those vine-like tentacles were its roots!

...

And after Lin Xiu’s avatar was captured, a mouth opened in the middle of the thick branch of the giant tree, biting ‘Lin Xiu’ in half!

boom–

And Lin Xiu’s avatar also burst like a balloon at this moment.

Lin Xiu directly used the Analytic Eye at this time!

Evolved Plant: Black Iron Tree King

Rank: Plant God

Features: The roots can be used as weapons and have powerful regenerative abilities.

The outer layer is extremely hard, able to withstand most attacks and resistant to fire.

Weakness: After the core in the roots is destroyed, it will die.

Looking at the information, Lin Xiu’s eyes showed a look of surprise.

Plant God, this is the first time Lin Xiu has seen such a thing.

Moreover, the Analytic Eye seems to have been upgraded to a certain extent and now it is able to analyze its weaknesses!

With this, the beast would be much easier to deal with.

Lin Xiu thought about it for a while and suddenly two lotus fires appeared on both hands and directly charged towards the roots of the black iron tree king.

Whizzing–

As the two lotus fires rushed over, the Black Iron Tree King seemed to have noticed something. A large number of vines directly turned into something like a defensive shield, directly resisting the two lotus fires.

Bang bang bang——

The lotus fires hit the shield made of vine roots and exploded immediately.

There is no way to cause any damage to it.

“Hng!”

At this time, Lin Xiu’s figure had already appeared behind the black iron tree king.

His fist slammed directly toward its torso!

Boom——

With a loud sound, the huge body of the Black Iron Tree King fell directly to the ground.

At this moment, Lin Xiu could clearly see its massive roots.

Among these roots, there is an oval thing!
