Chapter 606: They Were All Eliminated By Me

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“‘Matchless sword sweep”!!!”

“‘Trampling mountains’!!!”

The warriors who jumped out at this time directly volleyed into the sky and used their skills directly at Lin Xiu.

Not holding back at all!

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he watched this scene.

“You guys are really... a little naughty...”

Lin Xiu covered his face and in the next moment, the spear in his hand swung and a powerful force was instantly released.

Boom—

There was a huge explosion on the surrounding ground.

In the next moment, the bodies of those warriors who had just attacked Lin Xiu were shaken out.

The warriors were smashed heavily on the branches of the surrounding trees and even the thick branches broke directly.

Pff—

Those warriors fell to the ground and just about to get up, they felt a sharp pain from their bodies, their eyes widened and in the next moment, a mouthful of blood was spat out.

Their eyes were full of disbelief. They didn’t see Lin Xiu’s movements clearly at all and they flew out straight away.

This was really too scary.

“I won’t stand on ceremony and accept your entry cards then.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu walked over and took away all the entry cards that they had pinned to their chests.

These people wanted to snatch it back, but their bodies had no strength at all.

Only severe pain.

“Huh? So you’ve also advanced? But it’s a pity, goodbye.” After a closer look, there was actually one of the men from Changjia Academy who got knocked out by Lin Xiu.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words at this time, the man spat out a mouthful of blood under his anger.

Lin Xiu smiled, then ignored these people, turned around and left.

“It’s over...” Some warriors looked at Lin Xiu leaving and was dumbstruck.

Lin Xiu showed such powerful strength that they were his match at all. It was almost impossible to snatch the entry card from Lin Xiu.

They all belonged to a relatively strong team. They thought they would join forces to get rid of Lin Xiu first, but they didn’t expect that all their entry cards were taken away and they were seriously injured.

They were already destined to be eliminated.

“Okay, you guys don’t have to play anymore.”

Lin Xiu loosened his muscles and joints and in the next moment, his eyes became sharp and as soon as he moved, he began to search for the warriors hidden in the forest!

With his powerful perception, Lin Xiu easily found those warriors.

It was all one move and just one move defeated those people and robbed them of their entry cards.

“Lin Xiu, I wonder how is he now.”

At the same time, Ouyang Hang, who was waiting outside, frowned and said aloud.

He could clearly feel that a lot of people were targeting him and others. If Lin Xiu was jointly robbed by them, it would be troublesome.

“Do you think my apprentice is as rubbish as you?”

Baili Haoling glanced at Ouyang Hang while holding a popsicle.

Ouyang Hang almost vomited out a mouthful of blood. What do you mean by ‘rubbish like you’?

He was the direct descendant of the Ouyang family! Hello!

But he knew that Baili Haoling’s strength was unfathomable. After all, she was the granddaughter of the dean.

At this time, he still endured it. After all, Baili Haoling talked a lot of trash and he was already immune.

“It should be fine, I think Lin Xiu was quite confident.” Huang Zhen and Qian Yao thought about it at this time, then said aloud.

“Tsk tsk, you guys still want to win?” At this moment, a discordant voice came over.

Ouyang Hang’s eyes turned to the side and he saw Zhao Qian of Changjia College.

“Tsk tsk, you guys got defeated and still dared to come mock us?” Ouyang Hang said with a sneer.

Hearing Ouyang Hang’s words, Zhao Qian’s eyes changed, but they soon returned to their original state. He stared at Ouyang Hang sullenly and said, “The kid you sent is sure to lose. Your academy will be eliminated.”

“Just based on what you said?” Ouyang Hang replied with a smile.

“Experts from the six colleges ambushed him. Do you think his entry card will not be robbed?”

Zhao Qian said with a sneer at this time.

Although Changjia College lost to the Sacred Region Academy, they still advanced with a winning streak, but they still felt a little bit bitter about losing to the Sacred Region Academy in such a humiliating way.

So they teamed up with experts from other academies and attacked Lin Xiu with one wave. They eliminated Lin Xiu first, then eliminated other students, so that all six academies could advance.

Other academies also secretly had this kind of alliance. After all, this time, if one fought alone, it would be too difficult to win.

“Humph! It’s just a little trick.” Ouyang Hang said with a sneer.

Even though he said that, he was still a little worried.

“Hmph, what’s the use of winning if you can’t advance?” Zhao Qian said with a smile.

About thirty minutes passed and Ouyang Hang could no longer sit still.

Although Lin Xiu’s strength should have improved a lot now, but facing the siege of several rank 7 warriors, could he retreat without being robbed of his entry card?

Ouyang Hang was not confident.

Similarly, Huang Zhen and Qian Yao seemed to be a little worried.

They didn’t want to fail even before they started. They haven’t even gone to Huaxia to participate in the Huaxia competition, not to mention the world finals.

On the other hand, Baili Haoling seemed to be very relaxed, sitting at a coffee table drinking coffee.

“What’s the hurry, Auntie, bring him a cappuccino.”

Baili Haoling seemed to be enjoying the coffee very much, then said to the waiter next to the coffee table.

“How can I not be anxious, when Lin Xiu is shattered by those guys, it will be the end.”

At this time, Ouyang Hang remembered that he was like an ant on a hot pot. He looked at the cup of coffee handed over there and drank it subconsciously.

The scalding sensation suddenly made him widen his eyes, then he cried out.

“En, someone came out so soon? Did he give up?”

Outside the forest, the staff member sitting under the reclining chair faintly saw a figure walking back.

Seeing this scene, his eyes turned to the front and he could clearly see the appearance of Lin Xiu.

“Young man, did you forfeit?”

The staff member watched Lin Xiu come out and said with a smile.

“Do you think that’s possible?” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Lin Xiu pointed to the entry card on his chest, then smiled and said.

The staff member was stunned for a moment, then continued to say, “Then...”

“I eliminated all of them.”

Lin Xiu said, then took out a stack of entry cards from his pocket.
