1417 The Escaped God King

The divine soul was devoured, and the sore spot where the soul was also burned made An Tiancheng let out howls and screams.

At this time, Lin Xiu wanted to directly use the Dark edge spear to penetrate his chest!

“Get… Get out!!!”

At this moment, An Tiancheng roared, and the source strength in his body burst out instantly!

Forming golden energy!

Boom

With a loud sound, Lin Xiu’s body was directly blown away.

Including the little black dragon divine soul, it flew back into Lin Xiu’s body in an instant.

At this time, Lin Xiu who flew out rolled over in the air, and then stabilized his body.

Just as he was about to continue attacking, the huge Scarlet Flame Beast appeared directly in front of him.

With its bloody mouth wide open, it was about to bite Lin Xiu’s head!

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu didn’t panic at all. The Dark edge spear in his hand directly swept across its open mouth!

At this time, the Dark edge spear carried an incomparably powerful force.

boom–

It swept away the row of extremely sharp teeth of the Scarlet Flame Beast!

The Scarlet Flame Beast screamed, but at the next moment, it swallowed Lin Xiu’s body directly.

“Lin Xiu!?”

Xiao Qingchen, who was the closest to Lin Xiu, saw this scene at the same time as he killed a God warrior from the Royal Beast Sect with the saber in his hand.

But the moment the Scarlet Flame Beast devoured Lin Xiu, its entire body swelled up like a balloon!

This is…!?

Boom

At the next moment, as the body of the Scarlet Flame Beast swelled to the extreme, it exploded in an instant!

And Lin Xiu’s body rushed out at this time.

Holding the spear in his hand, he was about to fly over to An Tiancheng!

“Damn…”

At this time, An Tiancheng was still bleeding from his hands.

His soul was damaged just now, and his divine soul was also swallowed a little, which directly caused his current combat power to drop significantly.

At this time, Lin Xiu not only killed its mount, but now he rushed over as if nothing happened – An Tiancheng had a look of disbelief in his eyes.

Clenching his teeth, with a thought, he slashed at the space next to him with a saber in his hand!

boom–

This space was instantly carved out!

He wants to… escape?!

Lin Xiu clearly saw this scene, and the look in his eyes changed drastically.

The Dark edge spear in both hands danced directly at him at this moment!

Boom, boom, boom

A series of blue flaming birds charged directly towards him at this moment!

The speed at which the flaming birds charged was too fast, and they slammed into An Tiancheng’s body in an instant.

Because just now he used the source strength of his whole body to burst out and sent Lin Xiu flying, so at this time, he didn’t have any extra source strength at all, so he unfolded the ‘Sphere’ for protection.

“ah!!!”

The terrifying flaming birds impacted his body, causing him to let out a wailing cry.

However, his body also fled into the space crack in an instant.

As soon as Lin Xiu flew over, the opening of the space crack was instantly closed.

“Damn it!”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but curse secretly.

Just now, he had the opportunity to directly kill this guy.

But now, this opportunity is obviously missed.

“Master…”

The people of the Royal Beast Sect couldn’t help but have a change of expression when they saw this scene.

Their sect master, the God king, escaped just like that!

Whoosh whoosh

Before they could make a move, Luo Yue had already rushed over, holding the thin-winged long sword in her hand, and began to fight against the surrounding warriors.

Boom, boom, boom

A series of faint blue flaming birds immediately charged toward the surrounding warriors of the Royal Beast sect!

This Royal beast sect can have so many warriors just shows how powerful they are.

...

But for Lin Xiu now, these warriors were simply vulnerable.

As the flaming birds kept hitting the bodies of those God warriors, their bodies were suddenly covered in flames.

Howls and screams continued to come from their mouths.

They also kept falling down.

Those evolved beasts also fled uncontrollably at this time.

Some God warriors had clearly sensed that something was wrong, and they turned around and were about to leave at this moment.

But Lin Xiu didn’t give them a chance at all.

The Dark edge spear in his hand danced, and those blue flaming birds immediately chased after them as if they had a tracking system.

Followed them and hit their bodies!

Boom

One by one, the God warriors kept falling to the ground.

...

The experience level in Lin Xiu’s system was still slowly rising. Although it was rising very slowly, no matter how small a mosquito’s legs are, it was still meat!

After the last person from the Royal Beast Sect was killed, Lin Xiu also stopped his movements.

The sequelae of ‘Fury’ followed, which made Lin Xiu feel uncomfortable.

There was also a sense of powerlessness throughout his body.

But on the surface, Lin Xiu still had to maintain a calm expression.

“The people from the Royal Beast Sect were all killed…”

The surrounding God warriors who were still standing at the gate of the God warrior City watching the excitement now had shocking expressions in their eyes.

Four people, with just four people fighting together, wiped out all the backbone of the Beast sect!

“This is really…too strong!”

Especially Lin Xiu, who almost killed the god king just now!

Some God warriors who came out of the ruins of Tianmen City now have a look of fear in their hearts.

Fortunately, they didn’t challenge Lin Xiu at the beginning.

No wonder all those who challenged Lin Xiu died.

This guy actually has a power comparable to that of a god king!

“Luo Yue, are you okay?”

Lin Xiu watched those warrior gods being wiped out, and some evolved beasts also escaped. At this time, he flew to Luo Yue’s side, and said softly.

Luo Yue nodded.

Ordinary God warriors are no match for Luo Yue now.

“Thank you all.”

Lin Xiu looked at Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen.

“What are you talking about? We also had a part in killing those people from the Royal Beast Sect previously.”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen shook their heads.

“Okay, goodbye. I’m ready to go back.”

Lin Xiu held Luo Yue’s hand, and then said to the two of them.

Now, he was going to return to Lingxian City first. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Arriving at the nearest city, through the space teleportation array, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue soon appeared at the nearest teleportation point in Lingxian City.

“Back?”

At this time, Pang Tong felt Lin Xiu’s aura, and raised his eyes to look over there.

Taking a closer look, there is another extremely beautiful woman standing beside Lin Xiu.
