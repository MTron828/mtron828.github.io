Chapter 252: Sniper

The man watched Lin Xiu and his group leave with sinister looks in their eyes.

Lin Xiu sensed that things would not end so easily.

“Freshman, are you afraid? Relax, we are all rank 6 warriors and can kill these small-time bandits anytime.” Qiu Li looked at Lin Xiu and laughed out loud.

Lin Xiu sneered but did not say anything.

Although they were rank 6 warriors, they were weak in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

He could easily take any of them with Fury.

Guo Ling took the lead and everyone rode on their android tigers forward.

They were all large and comfortable enough that a person could lie on top of them.

Lin Xiu placed his bag and Dark Spear at the side and felt relaxed.

The android battle tigers were extremely fast and they quickly arrived at Deep Blue City’s gates.

There were many union soldiers with laser rifles standing guard.

The laser rifles were the latest models and the laser beams fired would instantly penetrate through any ordinary warriors.

There were many warriors that came and went with a massive crowd all around.

After passing through the gates, they were able to see the scenery outside, which was a landscape of mountains.

All the trees that had been mutated were extremely tall and majestic.

He was on a different earth with a different environment as compared to his past life. Be it grass or trees, all of them have had heaven-toppling changes.

“According to the android tigers’ speed and the direction, I reckon that we will take about one and a half days to reach Dark Forest.” Guo Ling turned to Lin Xiu and the others and said.

“Then what are we waiting for, let’s go!” Qian Lin replied in excitement.

Aside from Guo Ling, the only female, everyone seemed to be extremely excited.

“Lin Xiu, are you ok?” Guo Ling looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

“I’m fine.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

The others glanced at him but did not say anything.

They were a small group and were slightly disagreeable towards Lin Xiu who had suddenly barged in.

It was due to the fact that Guo Ling had seen Lin Xiu’s battle video and saw that his skills were good and even had fire attribute skills that she felt he was extremely suitable to go to Dark Forest.

Guo Ling rode on her android battle tiger and keyed in the destination on the small screen. The android battle tiger started to increase its speed and charge ahead.

Lin Xiu followed tightly behind.

The new android battle tiger models were capable of cyber-navigating, and its navigation system was comprehensive and they simply had to follow the path laid out.

And its claws were extremely strong, allowing their transport to be extremely stable.

Very quickly, they moved across the mountain and the sight of Deep Blue City behind them gradually got further.

When they looked back, Deep Blue City was extremely small.

The ground ahead became more smooth and trees grew extremely tall, but they were all aware of the terrain change prior.

There were light blue mosses on the ground as well that no one knew what they were.

Bang bang bang- DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Not long after riding in the new terrain, they heard noises.

“Be careful!”

Guo Ling saw laser beams from the front and the expression in her eyes changed immediately.

She moved extremely quickly and immediately unleashed Sphere.

All the laser beams were reflected away instantly.

Qiu Li and the others immediately erupted with source strength in the confusion and formed their own spheres to protect themselves.

All the laser beams were easily deflected.

Lin Xiu stood on his android battle tiger and avoided the laser beams.

“Who!?” Qiu Li’s face became sinister.

Anyone getting ambushed would never feel good.

But the attackers did not reply and instead shot out even more laser beams from the high peaks!

Sou sou sou-

A series of laser beam sounds came out from above them.

All the laser beams struck the spheres.

Bang bang bang-

Explosions occurred on top of the spheres.

Although they were able to use sphere, they were warriors that had just entered rank 6. The might of their spheres were not strong enough yet.

After enduring the powerful laser beams, the spheres started to tremble.

“Damn it, who the hell is sneaking the attack on us!” Chen Jin was a refined-looking young man, but his face had become sinister from the barrage of laser beams.

Lin Xiu could tell that his character was different from his appearance, he was a hot-tempered man.

“Over here.” Guo Ling’s eyes changed as she swung the sword on her back!

Sou sou sou-

Her slash produced a crescent sword qi that flew right out.

It flew far ahead!

Bang-

The sword qi struck and broke a large trunk.

The trunk broke apart and the people on the tree dropped down.

They were obviously warriors and quickly stabilized their drops.

“They’re the people from before??” Guo Ling looked at them and realized that they were dressed the same as the people they had just met.

As though it was mass manufactured.

Bang bang bang-

Just as Guo Ling finished her sentence, a large number of laser beams shot towards them!

“Hmph! Even with sphere, I don’t believe you guys can take this.”

One of the assailants snorted and fired the laser rifle.

No, if this goes on, our sphere can’t deal with it.

After all, Sphere consumed source strength!

But the intensity of the laser beams was too intense, it was troublesome for them to charge right at their assailants.

Guo Ling and the others frowned.

But right at this moment, a figure suddenly charged forward!

“Lin Xiu!?”
