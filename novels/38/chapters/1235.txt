1236 Quick Attack

Then, the man’s body started spinning and he turned into a thick cloud of black smoke.

All of them went straight toward Lin Xiu!

Seeing what was happening before them, Lin Xiu frowned.

This was the first time that he has ever seen such a peculiar skill.

!!

However, Lin Xiu did not feel nervous.

With the control of his mind, the long spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hands.

Xiu – –

At that moment, the could of black smoke that the man had transformed into, rushed toward Lin Xiu as well!

Lin Xiu sneered as he started spinning the long spear in the air.

With the movement of the long spear, there were dark blue flames that were headed towards the black smoke.

But, it looked like these flames were useless towards the smoke.

The dark blue flames went straight to the smoke, causing no damage at all.

What was that?!

Before Lin Xiu could think of anything else, the black smoke was inches away from Lin Xiu!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

With each loud sound, there was a bright ray that shone in different directions.

Lin Xiu’s pupils narrowed. He held onto the long spear with both hands and started spinning it.

Clang clang clang – –

The sound of metal colliding with each other rang through the area.

The smoke that reverted to its human form. With the gloves in his hands that were sharp and long, it started attacking Lin Xiu!

However, Lin Xiu quickly moved his long spear, stopping the man from touching him with those pointy gloves.

“Go away!”

There was a large burst of energy that came from the long spear. Then, it pushed away the man who was still trying to attack Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

The man’s gloves had just returned to its original state but it was instantly broken by Lin Xiu’s long spear!

His eyes were opened wide in shock as he couldn’t believe what he saw.

Lin Xiu did not stop and continued thrusting his spear forward!

“Ahhhhh!!!!”

The man screamed. The energy in his body was quickly released as well.

There was a ‘sphere’ that was quickly formed as he tried to block Lin Xiu’s attack.

Boom – –

However, Lin Xiu’s spear was too strong.

The sharp tip of the sphere was enough to break his ‘sphere’.

Pfft – –

The sphere soon exploded and the man spat out a mouthful of blood.

Xiu xiu – –

Before he could steady himself, there were two more sharp piercing noises in the air that came from behind him.

“AHHHHH!!!!”

There was a loud, painful cry that followed as both his upper limbs were chopped off! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

When he looked closely, it was Baili Haoling who attacked him!

All of the warriors that he brought along have been killed.

The man, who lost both his arms, shivered in fear as he fell to the ground.

His ‘sphere’ has been destroyed and he was still suffering from the backlash of it. As he lost both his arms, it caused another huge impact to his body.

Lin Xiu took this as an opportunity and drove the long spear through the man’s head!

The sphere was sharp and quick. It was impossible for the injured man to be able to withstand it.

The long spear went straight through the man’s head!

“Ding! Congratulations master in killing a warrior god. EXP gained 644624744…”

Soon, there was a notification that came from the system.

Although the man was a warrior god, he was still a weaker one amongst the others.

Huhuhu– –

At the same time, there was a loud siren that rang in Shachang City as soon as Lin Xiu killed the last warrior.
