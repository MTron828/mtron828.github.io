Chapter 786: The Power of a King Warrior

When An Qi and Qian Lin saw this scene, they couldn’t help worrying about Lin Xiu.

That old man was equivalent to Sun Zi’s personal bodyguard and his strength was at the level of a King Warrior.

Even a peak warrior at the master warrior level couldn’t deal with him.

“There is no way…”

At this moment, An Qi bit her lip lightly, then took out a strange object from her backpack.

And then throw it directly into the air at the next moment.

Boom—

At this moment, there was a huge sound in the air, like fireworks exploding.

“Are you calling someone?”

When Sun Zi saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed slightly, then he looked at An Qi and said.

“So what?”

An Qi sneered.

This was given to her by her father. When in danger, as long as she uses this thing, her father will send someone to rescue her.

After all, after coming here to practice this time, the people in her family are still very worried about her.

“What if they came? I killed him, not you.”

Sun Zi said with a sneer.

He did not believe that the An family would dare to turn against them for an outsider.

Hearing Sun Zi’s words, An Qi’s eyes became a little ugly.

Sun Zi was right. Father probably won’t care...

“And, before they arrive, this kid should be dead already.”

As soon as Sun Zi finished speaking, Lin Xiu, who had been dodging on the other side, was caught off guard and was attacked by the old man again.

Those arcs on the dark red ‘Sphere’ seemed to have no effect on the old man.

He allowed the lightning to flow on his body and his movements were still smooth.

“Do you think you will be fine just because you unfolded the ‘Sphere’?”

“I guess you haven’t experienced when your ‘Sphere’ is broken, right?”

The old man looked at Lin Xiu, who was hit hard by his punch and crashed to the back.

The old man’s body strength was mobilized and the muscles in his whole body seemed to have swelled a lot.

He didn’t look like an old man at all.

“Warrior king level... is indeed a bit strong.”

Lin Xiu looked at the opposite side, as if playing a game, the old man slowly approached his side, his eyes not only did not have any fear but were full of fighting intent.

“Hu…”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and at this moment, without the slightest hesitation, he directly used the system’s skills!

‘Reset’!

Reset the ‘Fury’ skill that was used before.

The next moment, use ‘Fury’ directly!

With the use of the skill, Lin Xiu’s entire strength seemed to have undergone earth-shaking changes in an instant.

The stronger the original strength, the more obvious the effect of ‘Fury’.

At this time, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that his power was growing crazily.

This time, before the old man could attack, Lin Xiu had already attacked with his long spear!

“Courting death!”

Sun Zi saw Lin Xiu not dodging and instead he attacked directly with the spear in his hand.

In his opinion, no matter how strong Lin Xiu is, he is only a warrior at the master warrior level.

As for the old man at the King Warrior level, it can be said that he can directly crush Lin Xiu!

The old man originally had the same thought as Sun Zi, but when Lin Xiu stabbed him with a spear, the pupils in his eyes could not help shrinking!

Because the shot that Lin Xiu stabbed was very fast, the speed was terrifyingly fast!

boom–

And as the spear stabbed, there was an obvious swishing sound in the air.

The old man did not directly meet the blow but dodged directly.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly, without the slightest stagnation in his movements.

He waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand and continued to attack the old man! FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Whoosh whoosh—

The long spear that was stabbed turned into hundreds of thousands in an instant.

This old man had no chance to dodge at all!

bang bang bang-

At the same time, a green ‘Sphere’ unfolded in an instant.

Blocking Lin Xiu’s attacks.

“He was forced to unfold the ‘Sphere’!?”

Seeing this scene, the people around couldn’t help but be surprised.

This old man is a warrior at the level of the King Warrior. Logically speaking, he should be able to easily kill Lin Xiu.

But at this time, Lin Xiu forced him to use ‘Sphere’!?

And after a closer look, Lin Xiu’s offensive didn’t stop in the slightest and he hit his “Sphere” non-stop.

Terrifying force kept impacting on the ‘Sphere’, causing the old man’s body to continuously retreat.

“Uncle Yan!”

Seeing this scene, Sun Zi couldn’t help roaring loudly.

“You wanna die!”

The old man was also angry at this time. He, a warrior at the King Warrior-level, was forced to such a level, by a young man like Lin Xiu. For him, it was a shame.

At this time, his face also became hideous.

Without dodging again, he raised his hand and punched the spear that Lin Xiu had stabbed over!

When his fist was swung out, a terrifying lightning bolt gathered in the entire fist.

The power of this lightning is very terrifying, at this time the surrounding air seems to be scorched!

“‘Divine Lightning Explosion’!!!”

The old man roared and as the fist and the spear collided, an extremely terrifying lightning flashed and it exploded.

Some huge trees seemed to have been struck by lightning and they were all scorched.

Sun Zi was also startled and hurriedly dodged at this moment.

And the body of Lin Xiu flew out like a kite with a broken string.

Those terrifying blue electric lights covered Lin Xiu’s body in the next moment.

At this time, Lin Xiu felt that his body was a little painful from the electric light.

He was someone who could withstand high-voltage electricity, but now he was shocked by this kind of lightning, causing his body to feel this sharp pain, which shows the horror of this electricity.

“Why, you don’t think you can really beat me, do you?”

At this time, the old man looked at Lin Xiu who was hit by his skills, and said coldly.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu, who had fallen to the ground, got up again at this moment!

Seeing this scene, the expression in the old man’s eyes couldn’t help changing.

This kid, actually...

Lin Xiu’s body was covered with terrifying electric lights, all of which were caused by the old man’s skill.

But even so, Lin Xiu seemed to be fine and stood up again.

“Next, it’s my turn.”
