Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

This guy was still alive?!

When they saw Lin Xiu’s body that was slowly rising from the ground, they could longer hide their emotions.

The skills that they have just used earlier were already considered one of the strongest that they’ve had.

However, it did not kill Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu turned toward them. With his long spear in his hands, he released a few more flaming birds towards the sage warriors!

The skills that were used by the sage warriors were actually very powerful.

But at that instant, Lin Xiu was not injured at all because he had used the ‘Golden Body Immortality’.

He was immune to the attacks for a second.

This would happen when their strongest skills were about to land on him, about to cause injuries to him.

The dark blue flames were headed towards them once again!

The look in their eyes changed.

These dark blue flames were things that their body could stop.

......

However, just when they wanted to move around to dodge it, they noticed that the black lizard was coming at them as well!

Damn it!

Seeing how the claw of the black lizard was getting closer to him, Zhao Rui was looking scared.

Boom – –

As soon as he realised his ‘sphere’, he was hit by the claw of the black lizard and he was thrown onto the ground.

It was similar to how Lin Xiu had fallen to the ground. There was also a huge explosive noise when he hit the ground.

The entire ground was shaking as well.

The thick layer of dust reappeared too.

Sima Qiang witnessed all of it with the corner of his eyes and felt relieved.

He was shocked as well as he saw the scary looking black lizard that was going after Huang Fulin.

How did Lin Xiu summon the creature?

However, he didn’t have time to think as he was still fighting Heilong and Bailong.

“God damn it!”

Huang Fulin was trying to dodge the attack of the black lizard and was also swinging around his sword trying to chop off the lizard’s claw.

The sword aura landed on the claw of the black lizard but it doesn’t seem to have any effect on it.

The scale of the black lizard was tough.

If they didn’t use a strong force on it, it would be impossible to injury the lizard.

Suddenly, Lin Xiu appeared from behind him.

‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks The City’!

As the long spear was thrusted towards him, there were a large amount of balck particles that appeared!

Following that, the black particles joined together to form a huge black dragon that was headed towards Huang Fulin’s neck!

“Hmph!”

Huang Fulin sneered when he saw what was happening and released his ‘sphere’.

That’s when a purple sourcemark appeared on his head!

As he purple sourcemark appeared, there were several huge semi-transparent shields that surrounded Huang Fulin.

Boom – –

The skill that Lin Xiu released and the black lizard’s attack landed on the shields.

It was then followed by several loud sounds

Huang Fulin had successfully blocked all of the attacks!

“Move!”

Huang Fulin screamed and all of the shield started giving out an eye-blinding bright light.

Oh no!

When it happened, Lin Xiu wanted to continue his attack but then soon noticed that it was a bad idea.

Boom – –

The huge shield continued to shine brightly and it suddenly exploded!

The entire place was affected by the loud explosion.

The huge explosion also caused an impact on the lizard’s body and it threw lizard onto the ground.

Boom – –

The huge body of the lizard landed on the ground beneath it and all of the buildings that it landed on turned into debris.

The rest of the buildings around it collapsed as well because of the huge impact and there were no longer buildings left standing around them.

“Damn it! I had to use my core energy!”

Huang Fulin, who was still floating in the air, commented with a horrible look on his face. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Most of the people of the Wildfire City have already heard of the battle between the sage warriors and were running out of town.

They knew that with battles of this scale, they could destroy the entire city!

They didn’t want to lose their lives innocently.

Then, Zhao Rui’s body rose from the ground.

“Damn it! How did this fella summon such a horrible creature!”

Zhao Rui wiped off the blood at the corner of his mouth.

“Ha! Zhao Rui, you’re too weak.”

Huang Fulin moched Zhao Rui.

“Nonsense! That brat is still alive!”

Zhao Rui was bothered by Huang Fulin who was mocking. Instead, he turned around and tried to look for Lin Xiu.

Huang Fulin stunned. He turned towards where Zhao Rui was looking at and he could see clearly that Lin Xiu’s body had once again reappeared in the air.

How was this even possible?!

When he saw what it was, Huang Fulin’s pupil shrank.

Lin Xiu was still alive?!

Roar – –

The Black Scaled Lizard leaped into the air as well.

Its mouth was wide open and there was a large amount of white colour energy source that gathered around its mouth.

It soon became a huge ball of energy!

Boom – –

After that, the huge ball of energy headed towards Huang Fulin and Zhao Rui!

These two were sage warriors and they had quick reflexes.

They were able to dodge the attack easily.

“How dare this evolved beast be so wild?!”

As Zhao Rui was still trying to dodge the attack, he sneered and threw out his spear once again and thousands of swords headed towards the lizard once again.

However, when he was still attacking the lizard, Lin Xiu’s body suddenly appeared from behind him!

Huang Fulin who kept his eyes on Lin Xiu couldn’t keep up with Lin Xiu and he didn’t know how Lin Xiu had suddenly appeared behind Zhao Rui!

‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers’!

Lin Xiu roared. As he thrusted his spear forward, his spear splitted into thousands of figures as well!

Boom boom boom – –

These thousands of spears directly landed on Zhao Rui’s ‘sphere’.

Although Zhao Rui had already released his ‘sphere’, the thousands of spears from Lin Xiu were still overpowering.

There were already huge cracks on his ‘sphere’!

“Move!”

As Lin Xiu was still moving the spear in his hand, about to activate his sage warrior skills in order to kill Zhao Rui, there was a loud voice that came from behind him.

Huang Fulin was already standing behind Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

He used the machete in his hand and swung it towards Lin Xiu’s body!

Although Lin Xiu was protected by the ‘sphere’, it was still an attack from a sage warrior and it was a powerful one.

Lin Xiu, who took the attack with his body, was immediately thrown to the side.
