Chapter 904: The Situation in Wildfire City

“Is your White Troop in Wildfire City?”

Lin Xiu continued to speak at this time.

“No.”

The older-looking white-clothed warrior shook his head at this time.

“Our headquarters is on the mountain on the side of Wildfire City.”

On the mountain on the side?

Lin Xiu raised his brows slightly.

“I’m going to Wildfire City.”

The main purpose of his trip was to go to Wildfire City.

“Benefactor, Wildfire City is more dangerous at night and the city gate is closed and entry is prohibited.”

The older man in white said at this time.

“Oh why?”

Lin Xiu’s eyes also showed curiosity.

Looking at the front, Lin Xiu could clearly see that there were still some figures walking around in Wildfire City.

It seemed like they were fighting or something.

“How about you follow us back to the headquarters first and we will enter the city together tomorrow morning.”

The older white-clothed warrior said respectfully at this time.

“Fine.”

After Lin Xiu thought about it, he nodded.

The strength of these white-clothed warriors is only around the level of a warrior king.

For the current Lin Xiu, they do not pose any threat at all.

So he is not afraid of any tricks these people play.

Following them all the way, Lin Xiu could clearly see many corpses around.

They are all the corpses of these black-clothed warriors and white-clothed warriors.

It seems that before this, there have been many battles here.

“Why are you guys fighting?”

Lin Xiu, who was riding on an android horse, asked at this time.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the expressions of these white-clothed warriors seemed to change slightly.

The older white-clothed warrior hesitated for a moment and told Lin Xiu the cause and effect.

It turned out that in Wildfire City, there was only one big power.

This great force is led by two powerful warriors.

But one day later, it seemed that the warriors of this great force broke up because of a fight for something.

So they split into the current White Troop and Black Troop.

The two groups have different ideas and often collide. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Later, the grievances continued to pile up, plus some things that happened before and finally evolved into the existence of two incompatible warrior groups.

“Recently, our leader have received some news. The people in their Black Troop have started to slaughter our White Troop. It seems that they want to uproot all our white-clothed warriors!”

The older warrior said this, with anger on his face.

The rest of the white-clothed warriors also spoke up at this time, “The people in their black troop were originally engaged in shady business. They often burned and killed in other places and they were simply a warrior group that shouldn’t exist!”

Speaking of which, their faces were full of indignation.

Lin Xiu nodded slightly, but didn’t say anything at this time.

The situation here seems to be a bit complicated and he doesn’t want to get involved.

And these have nothing to do with him.

“By the way, what do you mean by saying that this Wildfire City has been chaotic recently?”

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something at this time, then said to the older white-clothed warrior.

“Recently, it seems that a powerful force has come to Wildfire City.”

The older white-clothed warrior heard Lin Xiu’s words and while walking, he instinctively looked around, then said in a low voice.

“Do you know what the other name of Wildfire City is?”

“The city of intel.”

Lin Xiu knew this.

After all, before he came, he had already done his homework.

The most powerful intelligence agencies on the planet Namir are all here.

Here, it seems that you can inquire about all the information on the planet Namir.

If no one here knows what you want to know, then no one in the world would know.

“Yes, someone wants to integrate all the intelligence agencies of Wildfire City.”

The older white-clothed warrior nodded and said in a low voice.

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Want to integrate all the intelligence agencies in this wildfire city?

This force seems ambitious huh.

“And recently, the warrior teams in Wildfire City seem to have been provoked and are fighting each other, so the situation inside is very complicated now.”

“The Warrior Union Army has now imposed a curfew on Wildfire City.”

While walking, the older warrior told Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

“Are we reaching your headquarters soon?”

After walking for a long distance, Lin Xiu said suddenly.

“It’s here, right here!”

The older warrior nodded and pointed his finger at the front.

And the few young warriors behind him also heaved a sigh of relief at this time.

Another reason they wanted Lin Xiu to come together was that they wanted to rely on Lin Xiu to make it back safely.

After all, the strength that Lin Xiu showed just now is really too powerful.

With Lin Xiu’s presence, there would be no problem if something happened on the road.

Sure enough, Lin Xiu saw a large number of buildings standing on the mountain.

These architectural styles look very eccentric.

In front of those buildings, there is a gate.

In front of the door, there are many warriors guarding there.

These warriors are also wearing white uniforms.

“Mr. Zhang, you guys are back!?”

As the older white-clothed warriors and others walked over, the warriors who were guarding the door said in surprise.

“En, but they... all of them were killed by the people in the black troop.”

The elderly white-clothed warrior nodded, then his eyes were a little red.

Many of the white-clothed warriors who were killed just now were all his disciples, as well as some brothers who had gone through thick and thin with them.

They didn’t expect that they would be all slaughtered.

“They’re lying in ambush over there, it’s absolutely hateful!”

The rest of the young warriors also had reddened eyes at this time.

“We simply can’t live under the same sky as the Black Troop!”

When these guards heard their words, they clenched their fists fiercely.

Their eyes were full of anger.

“Right, he is...”

At this time, the guards came to their senses and looked at Lin Xiu riding on the Android horse and their eyes showed more vigilance.

During this period of time, their white troop was on high alert and would not receive other visitors.

The arrival of Lin Xiu at this time made them feel that something was wrong.

“This is our benefactor and he was the one who saved us and killed the people in the black troop just now.”

The older warrior known as Mr. Zhang spoke to these guards at this time.

After hearing his words, the guards began to slowly put down their weapons.

“Wait, he might be a spy of the Black Troop.”
