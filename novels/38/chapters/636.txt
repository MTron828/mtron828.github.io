Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

The girl stood on the edge of the cliff, and as the breeze blew, her hair fluttered.

“Luo Yue!”

Lin Xiu walked over and said in surprise.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue turned around and looked at Lin Xiu. There seemed to be a look of surprise in her eyes, but it was quickly covered up.

“You’re here…” Before Luo Yue could say anything, Lin Xiu was a little excited, so he rushed over without thinking, and hugged Luo Yue.

Luo Yue’s eyes widened, as if she couldn’t believe that Lin Xiu was so bold.

“Lmiss you.”

Lin Xiu closed his eyes and felt the familiar fragrance of Luo Yue, so he couldn’t help muttering to himself.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue, who originally wanted to push Lin Xiu away, froze for a while, and put her hands behind Lin Xiu’s back, not knowing how to move.

Her cheeks were a little red, and her hands were lightly placed on Lin Xiu’s back.

Me too…

Luo Yue didn’t speak, it seemed that both of them were immersed in this somewhat ambiguous atmosphere.

“Wow…”

But at this moment, a subtle voice came over, and after Luo Yue heard it, her eyes suddenly changed.

She reacted at this time, and suddenly felt Lin Xiu’s hand on her back.

Luo Yue, who was always not used to such close contact, just lifted her foot and kicked Lin Xiu out.

“Damn!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened, and his entire body hit the giant tree behind him.

“Very painful.

“Come out!”

Luo Yue looked to the other side, and said coldly.

Hearing that there was no sound coming from there, Luo Yue frowned slightly. She took out a dagger and threw it, and it flew out!

Swoosh—

The dagger flew out to the front, directly piercing the tree.

Awhite figure suddenly jumped out from there.

“How annoying, are you going to murder your own sister?”

Luo Yan, who jumped out, looked at Luo Yue resentfully, and said aloud.

“What are you doing hiding here?”

Luo Yue stared at her and said coldly.

“Aiya, I care about my younger sister. And also protect this… future brother-in-law?”

Luo Yan looked to the back and smiled at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu, who had just been kicked out by Luo Yue, immediately got up and showed a smile.

Luo Yue glared at Lin Xiu, then stared at Luo Yan.

“Okay, okay, I’ll go, I’ll go, I won’t disturb you little couple.” Luo Yan said as if she was afraid that Luo Yue would attack her with anger. At this time, she turned around and disappeared directly.

Luo Yue looked around, and after seeing Luo Yan disappear, she calmed down.

“Is she your sister?”

Lin Xiu walked over at this time and said aloud to Luo Yue.

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and saw that there were weeds on Lin Xiu’s head, which seemed to be caused by the fact that he had just fallen and fell on the ground, and suddenly burst out laughing.

However, she soon returned to her icy appearance.

“What are you looking at?”

Looking at Lin Xiu, she found that Lin Xiu was staring at her, Luo Yue felt a little warm on her cheeks, and then pretended to be cold.

“You look so good when you smile.”

Lin Xiu laughed.

Luo Yue opened her eyes wide, this guy dares to tease her now!

“By the way, thank you for today.”

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something at this time, and said seriously to Luo Yue.

If it wasn’t for Luo Yue’s sister today, although he could have used ‘Mirror Image’ to escape the fatal blow, the next battle would probably be too tough to fight.

After all, the one who assassinated him was a rank 9 warrior.

Luo Yue was startled, then shook her head, “No need to say thank you.”

“En.

The two looked at each other, and there seemed to be a touch of tenderness in their expressions. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“The people of the Zhuo family will not give up.”

Luo Yue “started the topic at this time, and looked at Lin Xiu then continued to speak.

“I know.”

Lin Xiu already had this realization when he killed Zhuo Qixing. Sky City was the territory of the Zhuo family, and they would definitely not give up so easily.

This assassination was just the beginning.

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu also showed a grim look in his eyes.

“Also, the finals, do you want to participate?”

Luo Yue hesitated for a while, then said to Lin Xiu.

“Yes.”

Lin Xiu said decisively.

“Lwant to defeat them.”

Luo Yue heard Lin Xiu’s words, and of course she knew that Lin Xiu was referring to the few people she met at Thunder Valley at that time, namely Nan Huang and the others.

“Lwon’t show mercy.”

Luo Yue said lightly.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu smiled, if Luo Yue deliberately avoided fighting because of him, it would not be Luo Yue.

“Well, be careful with Nan Huang, he’s not easy to deal with.”

Luo Yue nodded slightly, then warned.

“En”

“Tl get going first.”

After Luo Yue finished speaking, she turned around and left.

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue’s back, and his heart seemed a little throbbing and a little sad.

No matter how stupid he was, he knew that Luo Yue was actually interested in him. If Luo Yan’s sister hadn’t appeared, he would probably have sealed the deal.

In normal times, Lin Xiu wouldn’t be afraid of dangerous things, but when it comes to his feelings, to be honest, Lin Xiu really didn’t have enough courage.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and said to Luo Yue, “Luo Yue, wait.”

Luo Yue, who was walking down, suddenly stopped, turned slightly to look at Lin Xiu, and there seemed to be a curious look in her eyes.

Lin Xiu was a little nervous, but he still gritted his teeth and said, “Will you be my girlfriend?”

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, he felt as if he had used up all his courage, and waited nervously for Luo Yue’s reaction.

Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu, then continued to walk away without looking back.

But when Lin Xiu couldn’t see it, her originally fair cheeks were already dyed pink.

The slightly raised lips seemed to express the joy in her heart.

“Was it too soon?”

Seeing that Luo Yue continued to walk down without any reaction, Lin Xiu sat down on the grass on the ground a little sad.

But at this moment, Luo Yue’s gentle voice came over, “Wait until you win the game.”

Lin Xiu, who was still a little depressed at first, opened his eyes wide, jumped up and shouted loudly, “Are you serious?”

However, Luo Yue had disappeared by now.

“Hahaha!”

Lin Xiu laughed proudly at this time, and then jumped away like a child..
