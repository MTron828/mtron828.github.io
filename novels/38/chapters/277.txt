Chapter 278: Killing Blow!

Guo Ling frowned slightly as he looked at these warriors who suddenly appeared.

There were about seven or eight people in total and every one of them was a rank 6 warrior, there were even some who were a peak rank 6 warrior.

Even with their full force, it was challenging to fight against them. Furthermore, Lin Xiu and the others had just fought with the Giant Black Rock Beast so their current strength was obviously not as good as before.

Lin Xiu should have used up quite a bit of his strength.

After all, Lin Xiu was basically fighting the Giant Black Rock Beast by himself just now. Lin Xiu probably didn’t have any strength left right?

With that thought, Guo Ling’s heart sank even more.

What were they going to do!?

Lin Xiu stared at the man with a scar who was holding the saber and said faintly, “Okay, I’ll give it to you.”

“Haha, you’re sensible, otherwise, you are all going to die here.” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the man with a scar immediately thought that Lin Xiu had given in and chuckled.

Just now, they all saw Lin Xiu fighting against that Giant Black Rock beast and they were a little surprised at his strength.

Because even they didn’t dare to be certain that they could kill the beast alone.

But Lin Xiu could.

If they really fought, they would still suffer quite a bit.

Guo Ling heaved a sigh of relief. Although he was a little unwilling, it was indeed a wise move. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

If they fought, Lin Xiu, who had already used up most of his strength, would be in a dangerous situation.

“If you guys can walk away alive.”

But at this moment, Lin Xiu suddenly spoke up.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the expressions of these people suddenly changed, especially the man with the scar. He felt the sudden force from the weapon that collided with Lin Xiu and the pupils in his eyes constricted suddenly. Then, he shouted, “Courting death!”

Dang dang dang——

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear and began fighting wildly!

The two weapons collided and emitted a lot of sparks; the sounds echoed through the surrounding area.

“Kill!”

Guo Ling saw Lin Xiu had made a move and reacted quickly, as he rushed to the front with the long saber in his hand!

“I’ve been waiting!”

Qiu Li sneered and rushed out!

Those who could enter the Sacred Region Academy were god’s favored ones, they were gifted individuals, how could they tolerate such ridicule?

“Courting death!” The man with the Giant Black Rock Beast’s Odd crystal saw Guo Ling and the others rushing over and his expression changed. Then, he put the Odd crystal into his backpack. At this moment, the warriors around him also directly attacked Qiu Li and the others with their weapons!

“Go to hell!!!”

The man with a scar began fighting frantically at this moment and used his skill directly.

He seemed to want to kill Lin Xiu with one blow!

Boom–

But at this moment, a blue glow burst out of Lin Xiu’s body suddenly and it was like a barrier.

His saber that had immense power seemed to be instantly weakened because of the sudden appearance of this barrier!

Very good, it seems that the effect of a rank 5 warrior has been triggered.

Lin Xiu was taken aback when he felt this.

The effect of the rank 5 warrior title was that there was a 30% chance of blocking 50% of the damage.

At this moment, the man with a scar was shocked that his powerful skill was actually blocked by this strange barrier.

What exactly is going on! ?

Could it be ‘sphere’? Impossible! This guy should be a rank 5 warrior!

While he was still in shock, Lin Xiu had directly thrust his Dark Edge spear out.

Swish swish swish——

The sound of his spear cutting through the air resounded and white rays of light appeared in the area.

At this moment, seeing this scene, the man with a scar had a hint of shock in his eyes.

The spear swung very swiftly and cold light burst out from the spearhead, making the surrounding area appear like a galaxy of stars!

Unusually dazzling.

Dang dang dang——

The man with a scar responded quickly as well. At this moment, his saber blocked Lin Xiu’s attack.

But the impact generated by Lin Xiu’s spear head was very hard, the spear tip pierced the blade of his saber and the powerful force was transmitted to his hand.

His hand felt a little numb at this time.

Horrifying, it was really horrifying.

Is he really just a rank 5 warrior!? And he just fought against that Giant Black Rock Beast ah!

“Boy, don’t be so wild!”

Scar was a bit angry by Lin Xiu’s aggressive attacks at this time and suddenly shouted loudly.

After resisting Lin Xiu’s attack again, he was about to hold the saber and release a skill to counter-attack!

“‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!!!”

Lin Xiu shouted coldly without giving him the slightest chance to resist. His spear was like a dragon and the moment it stabbed out, a large amount of black smoke burst out of the spear’s body.

Soon, these black energy bodies formed a black dragon that hovered around the spear’s body and directly pierced out with Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear!

What is this!?

Scar’s mouth widened and he looked at this scene in disbelief.

He still had a bit of strength left and was ready to kill Lin Xiu.

But at this time, his skill had been released and the saber in his hand that was about to attack Lin Xiu couldn’t be retracted back!

Boom——

The second when the spear and his saber collided, the black dragon on the tip of Lin Xiu’s spear opened its mouth wide, swallowed his body, and pressed him firmly on the ground!

A huge explosion erupted on the ground.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 6 warrior. You’ve gained 80 million experience!”

As the thick dust caused by the explosion dissipated, the man’s body was covered in blood due to the powerful force of the ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’.

His eyes were wide open as if he was still in disbelief when he died.

“Scar!!!”

The rest of the men heard the loud noise and instinctively looked towards Lin Xiu. Then, they saw Scar’s body collapsing on the ground.

There was a huge pit on the ground around him.

And this man with a scar was clearly dead!

Within a short period of time, he was actually killed by Lin Xiu!
