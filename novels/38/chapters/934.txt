Chapter 935: Akash Sandworm!

??

Although there were a lot of black wind camels now.

Too many to count.

But as long as Lin Xiu swung the Dark Edge spear.

And released ‘Awe of the phoenix’, these seemingly countless black wind camels will all be killed.

However, Lin Xiu hesitated for a while, but he still did not take out the Dark Edge spear from the expansion space.

He took a deep breath and in the next moment, Lin Xiu’s hands exploded with a large amount of lightning.

crackling-

Looking at the black wind camels rushing around, Lin Xiu waved his hands and attacked directly.

bang bang bang-

These black wind camels that rushed over were directly sent flying by Lin Xiu.

And because of those lightning bolts on Lin Xiu’s fists, the black wind camels that were knocked out were also covered in lightning.

They were instantly blackened by electricity.

“Brother Lin, your strength is not bad!”

Some warriors watched Lin Xiu instantly knock out a black wind camel and said in surprise.

“If I didn’t have any strength, I wouldn’t dare enter this desert.”

Lin Xiu smiled and said.

“Very good, let’s kill all these damn black wind camels!”

The warrior grinned.

They are all peak king warriors and it was not too difficult to deal with these black wind camels.

Soon, as this beast tide slowly passed, Wu Jie and others could not help but heaved a sigh of relief.

“That was exhausting, they’re finally gone…”

Some warriors even sat directly on the ground, looking a little out of breath.

The number of those black wind camels just now was too many.

No matter how easy they were to deal with, it was still very tiring.

“Strange, where are they going?”

Wu Jie looked at the black wind camels rushing in the other direction and said curiously.

“Generally, black wind camels don’t make such a large-scale migration. Could it be that there is something wrong over there?”

Some warriors also said curiously at this time.

“Master, I feel there is danger ahead, why don’t we take a detour?”

The middle-aged man hesitated for a while, but still said aloud.

“No, we have to go back to the clan meeting before the day after tomorrow. If we take a detour now, it may be too late.”

Wu Jie shook his head and said.

“But...”

“Continue walking.”

Wu Jie said loudly.

The others also nodded at this time.

Because going straight back to Sand Sea City from here was the closest and in the other direction, they would have to go a big round.

“Brother Lin, there may be danger ahead, why don’t you follow us.”

At this time, Wu Jie smiled at Lin Xiu and said.

“OK.”

Lin Xiu said with a smile at this time.

Even though Lin Xiu just sent quite a few black wind camels flying with ease.

But to them, Lin Xiu’s strength seems to be only average.

After walking for a long distance, Lin Xiu clearly heard a strange rustling sound.

What’s going on?

Lin Xiu frowned.

“Everyone, be careful, I feel there is something nearby.”

Lin Xiu said aloud at this time.

“There is something?”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Wu Jie suddenly stopped.

He looked around, but couldn’t see anything strange at all.

It seems that everything is normal and there is nothing.

“Brother Lin, you shouldn’t think too much.”

The middle-aged man said with a smile at this time.

The other warriors also laughed.

They thought Lin Xiu was thinking too much.

boom boom boom —

But at this moment, the whole ground began to vibrate!

The position where one of the warriors was standing collapsed in the next moment!

“what!!!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

When the warrior was about to move, his legs seemed to be bitten off by something, blood splashed everywhere and he let out a cry.

“Akash sandworm!?”

Wu Jie looked at the collapsed area and there were huge insects running out one after another and the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

This kind of bug looks extremely terrifying. Not only does it have a long body, but it also has a large number of teeth in its mouth.

It looks very disgusting.

“help me!”

The warrior roared, but in the next moment, he was bitten in half by another Akash sandworm!

boom boom boom —

The surrounding sand began to collapse in the next moment.

“Run!”

Seeing this scene, Wu Jie roared loudly without thinking too much.

With his loud roar, in the next moment, the rest of the warriors also left here.

This kind of sandworm can drill into the sand and what is even more terrifying is that when it drills into the sand, the surrounding area will slowly sink.

In this desert area, if your feet sink into the sand, it would be terrifying.

Because once the whole body sinks in, the source strength of the body cannot be used!

“You guys go quickly!”

And at this moment, the legs of the middle-aged man from before had already sunk!

“run!”

He looked at some warriors who looked back at him and shouted loudly.

In such a desert area, the power of this Akash sandworm was really too powerful.

Moreover, the desert here has a special and strange power, which makes the levitation technique unable to be used.

They could only walk in this desert!

“Leave!!!”

Seeing this scene, Wu Jie’s eyes were slightly red, but at this moment there was nothing he could do. He could only shout loudly and make everyone run away.

“Brother Lin, what are you doing!?”

But at this moment, they saw Lin Xiu running towards the middle-aged man’s body.

The middle-aged man’s body had already sunk into the sand. If he went over now, not only would he not be able to save him, but his own body would sink in too!

Taking a closer look, in the area where Lin Xiu ran over, the sand was moving like waves of water.

As soon as he walked past, his whole being will sink and he won’t be able to get out at all!

“Brother Lin, don’t mind me! Run!”

The middle-aged man roared loudly when he saw this scene.

But in the next moment, he found that Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared and appeared in front of him.

“stand up!”

Lin Xiu shouted and pulled his arm directly, pulling him out of the sand.

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

Behind him, a huge Akash sandworm opened its mouth wide, revealing a mouthful of white teeth.

Its mouth kept clenching, making a strange sound.

A pair of tiny eyes looked at Lin Xiu, about to bite down!

“Get lost!”

Just when it was about to bite, Lin Xiu roared and with a wave of his right hand, a terrifying lotus flame was instantly released and charged directly towards it!
