1144 The Cemetery of the Bai Family

This was impossible!

Impossible!

Although Bai Lin’s ‘sphere’ did not explode immediately, he was still severely injured.

Fresh blood came out from the corner of his mouth.

Lin Xiu did not stop as well and continued attacking Bai Lin with his long spear!

“You’re dead!!!”

Bai Lin screamed. Just when Lin Xiu’s spear was about to pierce through his ‘sphere’, Bai Lin’s body started expanding like a balloon!

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but narrow his eyes when he saw what happened.

An explosion!

Bai Lin was about to turn himself into a bomb!

Boom – –

At that instant, Bai Lin’s body exploded and there was a loud sound that came from it.

The damage formed by the explosion of a sage warrior was incredibly powerful.

Lin Xiu, who was standing near Bai Lin, suffered the most impact from the horrifying explosion. He spat out a mouthful of blood as well.

“F**k...”

Lin Xiu’s body was shaking in the air but soon, he managed to steady himself.

The explosion was a scary one.

Lin Xiu could feel that he had suffered several damages.

Huuuuu – –

As he took a deep breath, Lin Xiu’s body was already healing on its own with the quickest speed possible.

It was incredibly shocking how his body was able to regenerate itself.

Boom boom – –

The battle continued on the ground.

With Lin Xiu’s split image in the battle, it caused the Bai family to be badly defeated.

Lin Xiu, who was still in the air, waved his long spear and released a large amount of flaming birds with the ‘Awe of Phoenix’. All of the flaming birds rushed toward the warriors of the Bai family!

The warriors who were on the ground instantly turned into charcoal after getting burnt by the flames.

Even their ‘sphere’s were unable to block the scorching heat from the flaming birds.

Lin Xiu immediately flew towards the Bai Mansion.

However, there was already no one left.

All of the elites have already been gathered by Bai Lin to kill Lin Xiu but they did not succeed in it. Instead, all of them were killed by Lin Xiu.

Where did he go?

Lin Xiu looked around at the empty mansion and frowned.

Bai Qi, who was the head of the Bai family, should be here.

Lin Xiu would definitely get to level 70 after killing Bai Qi! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

As he continued to move further into the Bai family, there were a few black figures that rushed toward Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu quickly swung his long spear when he saw what happened.

Clang clang clang – –

With each loud sound, the weapons of the warriors who came out of nowhere, were thrown aside by Lin Xiu.

All of them looked terrified.

With their abilities, they couldn’t even hold onto their weapons!

But, Lin Xiu did not stop. He held onto his long spear and started attacking them!

‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers’!!!

All of the warriors subconsciously released their ‘sphere’s.

However, Lin Xiu’s attacks were too strong.

All of their ‘sphere’s exploded instantly.

Then, there were large bloody holes that appeared all over their bodies.

Each and every one of them were killed.

“98%...”

When he looked at the progress bar, Lin Xiu mumbled to himself.

“Who is it?!”

Then, with his sharp hearing, he suddenly heard a soft noise that came from behind.

Lin Xiu rushed forward with his long spear and saw a warrior who looked like he was trying to escape.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

Lin Xiu shifted and appeared right in front of the man.

“Please...please don’t kill me...”

The warrior’s body trembled and his legs turned weak.

This man saw it clearly with his eyes how Lin Xiu had killed these warriors.

Lin Xiu was able to kill all of them instantly.

Lin Xiu was incredibly scary.

“Where did the head of your family go?”

Lin Xiu asked calmly.

When the man heard what Lin Xiu wanted to know, the look in his eyes changed.

“Speak.”

Lin Xiu placed the tip of his long spear against the man’s forehead and threatened him.

Seeing how there was a long spear that was covered in blood, inches away from his head, the man looked horrified.

He didn’t want to die here.

“The head…..the head of the family went to the cemetery.”

He didn’t think much and told the truth.

The cemetery?

After hearing what was said, Lin Xiu frowned.

“Can you…..can you let me go now...?”

The man carefully observed Lin Xiu before asking.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu answered casually.

Just when he was feeling relieved, his eyes widened in shock and he was no longer breathing.

“Go to the other world then.”

Lin XIu thrusted the long spear through the man’s head before walking towards the cemetery.

There was a mountain peak behind the Bai mansion.

This was a mountain that belonged to the Bai family.

The ancestors of the Bai family were buried on this mountain.

“You’re here.”

Just when Lin Xiu reached the bottom of the mountain, there was a voice that came from the mountains.

Those who were standing in the mountains could obviously see Lin Xiu.

“So….this is where you are.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

The man standing before him was none other than Bai Qi, the head of the Bai family.

As the head of the family, his abilities were definitely different from the rest of the sage warriors. It has to be noted that he was already at his peak.

Lin Xiu only had 2 minutes left on ‘Rage’ and he wanted to kill Bai Qi within 2 minutes.

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu grabbed onto his spear and rushed forward!

“Damn it!”

Bai Qi’s eyes were now filled with hatred.

He gave out a loud roar as he held onto his sword. He wasn’t going to dodge and was ready to fight Lin Xiu head on!

Clang clang clang – –

When the weapons collided with each other, it was followed by loud explosions.

Lin Xiu was looking shocked as well.

Bai Qi was definitely someone powerful!

This man was definitely Lin Xiu’s opponent even when Lin Xiu had already reached such a high level.

“Glorious Nine Heavens!!!”

Bai Qi roared and there was a bright light that came from the sword.

A terrifying sword figure went straight towards Lin Xiu’s body!

Seeing what was happening, Lin Xiu’s pupils narrowed subconsciously.

He immediately released his ‘sphere’.

Boom – –

His warrior skill immediately landed on Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’!

Lin Xiu’s body was then pushed far behind.

His body heavily landed on a piece of rock behind.

The rock instantly broke into tiny pieces.

Just when Bai Qi thought that Lin Xiu was already severely injured, he saw numerous flaming birds that were getting closer to him!
