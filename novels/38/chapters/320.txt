Chapter 321: Luo Huatian’s Terrifying Power

With that thought, Lin Xiu was in even more shock.

Click, click, click——

The weird sound from Luo Huatian’s body has now disappeared as his bones grew to their current state.

“Who… exactly are you…!?” A warrior stared at Luo Huatian, his eyes filled with horror.

Luo Huatian’s current state was really terrifying. Looking at him, you could feel his extremely strong power.

“You talk a lot of nonsense.” Luo Huatian glanced at the man then dashed over!

He’s gone!?

Lin Xiu was shocked when he saw this scene.

Because at this moment, Lin Xiu discovered that Luo Huatian had disappeared!?

“Here!!!” While these warriors were stunned, they suddenly turned and looked behind!

Swish swish swish——

There were sounds of the blade cutting through the air and a warrior felt a sharp pain on his neck before he noticed Luo Huatian’s figure.

In the next instant, not only his neck but many blood stains appeared on his body.

Thud–

With a dull sound, the body of this warrior burst into many pieces in an instant.

The whole scene looked very bloody.

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened. The warrior’s body was cut into many pieces and the scene made Lin Xiu nauseous.

“Tsk, that’s all he’s got.” Luo Huatian’s figure also appeared at this time and he was standing behind them.

“Darn it!!!”

The other warriors were shocked and terrified when they saw this scene, but they still gritted their teeth and attacked Luo Huatian.

They all knew that if this continues, they would end up dead in the end and had no choice but to fight it out with Luo Huatian!

Lin Xiu was still shocked by Luo Huatian’s terrifying skills when he felt something all of a sudden. The pupils in his eyes constricted as he held the Dark Edge Spear in his hand and stabbed it towards the back!

Dang–

As the spear stabbed over, at this moment, there was a crisp sound.

He turned around and saw a middle-aged man holding a saber, about to attack Luo Yue, who was sitting cross-legged on the ground!

Luo Yue was absorbing the energy of the Ice Lotus Fire and couldn’t block resist this person’s attack at all.

“It’s you!?” After Lin Xiu blocked the attack of the man, he looked at the man and said coldly.

This person was clearly the last warrior who had survived at the bottom of the lake. Originally, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were going to kill him, but didn’t expect him to be gone.

“Damn it!” Originally, he wanted to kill Luo Yue with this saber to see if he could get the Ice Lotus Fire that she had swallowed.

But what he didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu would stop him. This had really maddened by him.

He swung the saber in his hand with a violent force and while pushing Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge Spear away, he was going to slash down on Luo Yue’s body!

Dang dang dang——

But the Dark Edge Spear in Lin Xiu’s hand blocked his attack once again.

“I’m going to kill you!” Lin Xiu blocked the attack again and again and the man became furious.

At this moment, he waved the saber in his hand and attacked Lin Xiu widly!

This man was attacked by Lin Xiu and Luo Yue just now at the bottom of the lake so he was injured.

Even if he was a rank 7 warrior, under this kind of wounded state, his combat effectiveness wouldn’t be very powerful.

Swish swish swish——

Lin Xiu attacked while dodging his attacks. During the battle, the warrior’s saber failed to attack Lin Xiu.

“‘Earth Shattering Divine Slash’!!!

At this moment, this warrior obviously did not want to be entangled with Lin Xiu. His expression changed and his hands gripped the hilt of the saber tightly as a strong force burst out and a clanging sound came from his saber!

Then, a huge and terrifying power came from the saber and it slashed directly towards Lin Xiu.

Bang–

A loud sound echoed through the air as he slashed directly at Lin Xiu’s body!

Even if Lin Xiu blocked the attack with his Dark Edge Spear, the power of this guy’s skill seemed to be too strong. At this moment, he cut Lin Xiu’s body and the Dark Edge Spear in half!

“Go to hell, kid!”

The warrior saw Lin Xiu being chopped in half and his expression became hideous, an ecstatic look appeared on his face.

No, this isn’t right.

At this moment, he clearly felt that he cut Lin Xiu’s body in half, but there wasn’t any blood spattering out!

Then, he saw that Lin Xiu, who was chopped in half, turned into smoke in an instant.

Swish——

The man had sensitive ears and clearly heard something at this moment. He turned around swiftly.

Then, he saw a cold light coming.

But he was a rank 7 warrior who had fought many battles after all. At this critical moment, a spear went past his body and he dodged it!

He dodged!?

At this moment, the look on Lin Xiu’s face changed. He didn’t expect this guy to react so quickly.

Lin Xiu already used ‘Mirror Image’ twice so this was the last time.

Originally, Lin Xiu planned to use ‘Mirror Image’ and attack him from behind, killing him directly.

But he didn’t expect that this guy would be able to dodge it which really surprised Lin Xiu.

And at this moment, he not only dodged it, he even attacked Lin Xiu!

Dang–

The Dark Edge Spear in Lin Xiu’s hand thrust over swiftly as well and it directly collided with his saber, letting out a loud noise.

“Pretty good, huh.” The warrior said with a sinister look.

As soon as he spoke, he continued to attack Lin Xiu wildly! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Dang dang dang——

He was using all his strength to attack Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu could clearly feel the tremendous force coming from the slashing of the saber and his hands were getting numb while holding the Dark Edge Spear.

Sure enough, there was still a gap between his strength and a rank 7 warrior.

“Go to hell!”
