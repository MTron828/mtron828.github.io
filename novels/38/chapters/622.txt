Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

They spent all their time in the training room today.

The seemingly spacious training room had more and more people.

After all, there were still many teams coming over that day.

“Okay, that’s all for today’s training. Tomorrow morning, at seven o’clock, gather at the lobby on this floor.”

At this moment, Baili Haoling stretched and said aloud.

“Worn out.”

At this time, Ouyang Hang also said with a sense of relief.

Lin Xiu also felt a little tired. After returning to the room, he took a hot shower. He did not continue to practice at night but slept instead.

Time passed quickly, and Lin Xiu, who had a good biological clock, got up early in the morning.

Lin Xiu still hasn’t taken Rollie and Xiao Bai out. After all, today was the real official competition of the World Warrior Competition.

“You guys are so fast?”

When Lin Xiu arrived at the hall on this floor, he saw that Baili Haoling and the others were already eating breakfast at one of the dining tables.

“Come over for breakfast first.” Huang Zhen said with a smile.

Baili Haoling was already eating non-stop, a real foodie.

And Ouyang Hang was looking at something with his mobile phone, his face was a little grim.

“What’s the arrangement today?”

Lin Xiu said to them while drinking a bowl of millet porridge.

“Wait at eight o’clock for the opening ceremony, and then at half-past nine, it will be the official game.”

“The venue for the competition is the largest competition platform in Sky City, on the Ascending Stage.”

Baili Haoling patted her well-fed belly, and then said to Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded. At this time, his eyes glanced around. There was now a large number of warriors around. These people were all wearing custom battle suits from their academy. It was easy to see that they were teams from major colleges.

The people from the Interstellar Academy also appeared here, especially Zhou Chen. Seeing Lin Xiu over there, the pupils in both eyes suddenly shrank.

Lin Xiu also noticed them, and a faint smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

From the current point of view, the warriors here were not very strong, at least, they weren’t threatening to Lin Xiu.

However, it was hard to say for the coming battles.

After all, there were many teams coming here for the first time. The warriors on this floor were just those living on this floor, there were many other teams on other floors.

The opening ceremony of the Warrior Union competition was very long and Lin Xiu found that it was similar to the opening ceremony of the sports meeting before.

After listening to the ‘nonsense’ said by the so-called leaders, he quickly went to the ‘Ascending Stage’.

Climbed to the Ascending Stage, the largest competition platform in Sky City.

Sky City was a city suspended in the air, and this competition platform, the Ascending Stage, was also suspended in the sky of Sky City.

This competition platform was very wide, and the surface looked like it is made of marble, but it was actually made of a special material, and its hardness was terrifying.

The competition platform was surrounded by an oval-shaped audience platform, which could accommodate hundreds of thousands of people at the same time.

Lin Xiu and the others were sitting on their preparation seats at this time, looking at the scene on the other side of the competition platform.

The game is about to start!

Lin Xiu looked around, as if he was looking for something.

“It is going to be a while till it’s our turn.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

At this time, Ouyang Hang took a bottle of sports drink and threw it to Lin Xiu. He also sat in his seat and looked at the competition platform in the middle.

Lin Xiu nodded, looking at the competition stage, the first pair of teams were already competing.

Apart from the contestants, most of them were spectators. At this time, as the battle unfolded, the surrounding spectators were excited and cheered loudly.

“It seems quite enthusiastic.” Lin Xiu raised his chin and looked at the scene in the middle of the competition stage, and said with a smile.

He continued to look around, but still didn’t see the figure of the person he wanted to see.

Luo Yue didn’t participate in this competition? That’s impossible...

“Next, the sacred region academy team from the Huanan Division will play against the Feyi Academy team from the Huabei region!”

Following the host’s excited words, the surrounding audience cheered loudly.

It was said that the tickets for the finals in the Huaxia region of this warrior competition were obtained by lottery and cannot be purchased, and the audience who won the lottery could come to Sky City to watch the game without reaching rank 6.

“Come on, it’s our turn.

Lin Xiu stood up at this time, carrying his Dark Edge spear, and walked directly to the competition stage!

When he was about to reach the competition stage, Lin Xiu’s body suddenly jumped up and stepped directly onto the competition stage!

And the people from Feiyi Academy stood up at this time.

All of them were holding long swords, and their expressions were cold.

“First of all, let me introduce to you the Sacred Region Academy, the only team in Huanan that has successfully advanced!”

The host standing on the aircraft shouted loudly with a microphone at this time.

The only team from the Huanan Division that made the cut?

Hearing the host’s words, the surrounding audience was all surprised.

“Do you know why? Because the teams in Huanan were all eliminated by the Sacred Region Academy team!”

Just now, there were still many viewers who thought that Huanan region was weak. At this time, when they heard the host’s words, there was an uproar around them.

“Okay, the next introduction is Feiyi Academy. Feiyi Academy is a strong team in Huabei region. The Academy is good at using swords. It is one of the best swordsmanship schools in China.”

“The game is about to start! Please get ready!”

“Hmph, you are the only team left in Huanan. It seems that Huanan won’t be involved in this year’s final.”

A man from Feiyi Academy said coldly to Lin Xiu who was standing at the front.

Lin Xiu didn’t speak at this time, the hand that wasn’t holding the Dark Edge spear stretched out and he spread out his fingers.

“What do you mean?” The man frowned when he saw Lin Xiu’s actions.

“Five seconds.”

Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

“Game start!”

“Crazy!”

Following the referee’s loud roar, the expression of the man from the Feiyi Academy suddenly changed drastically. The five of them charged towards Lin Xiu with their long swords at the same time!

Their speed was very fast, the long sword pierced out, and a large amount of sword aura burst out from it.

There was a sound of ‘whoosh whoosh’ in the air.

They gathered to attack me first huh?

Lin Xiu watched as the long swords of these five people merged together, forming a huge sword aura!
