Chapter 704 Special Warrior Skills – Clean Sweep

The normal war boots were really just a pair of normal shoes.

Lin Xiu chuckled helplessly when he saw the shoes.

But, his shoes were worn out as well after the fight earlier and it was time for a new one.

Then, he noticed that he had gotten a warrior skills card but it was a gold skills card that was used for the sword.

“This is such a scam!”

As Lin XIu mumbled to himself, he could clearly see that there was a small, black wooden box next to his leg. What’s this?

Lin Xiu was surprised but he still picked up the box.

As he opened the box, he saw a warriors skills card inside the black wooden box.

The card was black in colour and he didn’t know what grade it belonged to but in the centre of it, it was clear that it said ‘down’.

“A special warrior skills card?!”

When Lin Xiu realised what it was, he quickly took out the other two special warrior skills cards that he had collected previously to compare them.

When he took out the other two cards, a surprising thing happened.

All three of them suddenly flew into the air as if they had an effect on each other and remained floating in the sky.

Then, all the cards got closer and were stacked on top of one another.

Soon, with the three cards stacked together, they were slowly combined with each other and they fused to become one card.

The warrior card was black as if it had been burned into this state.

Lin Xiu reached out and took the black warrior skills card into his hand.

The surface of the card was smooth and the feeling while holding this card was different from the ones before.

On the top of it, there were four printed golden wordings that said: ‘Clean Sweep’.

“Looks like it’s quite powerful...”

Lin Xiu thought about it for a moment before placing it on his forehead and sat with his legs crossed.

As he activated his ‘Cultivation Technique’, all of the information that was on the card soon appeared inside his mind. There was too much information at once on the card. As all of this information rushed into his head continuously, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frown.

It felt as if his head was about to burst because of the overload of information inside his brain.

Time passed but Lin Xiu was still sitting crossed legged on the ground.

The information in this special warrior skills card was a lot more than those found inside a diamond card. Lin Xiu wouldn’t be able to take them all in with one sitting.

“HMPH! Do you think that no one would be able to find you here?!”

At the same time, there was a huge group of men heading towards the peak of the mountain where Lin Xiu was at.

One of the men who was leading the crowd was obviously the old man that had disrupted the fight between Wu Changkong and Lin Xiu.

The elder had a gloomy look on his face. Wu Chengkong was the one of the youngest in the Wu family. He was also the one who had the most hope of becoming the next king warrior. They never would have thought that an earthling would be able to kill him!

As he thought of it, he was so angry that he started shivering.

Initially, he had ordered Huang Ji to kill Lin Xiu but that old man was smart and had immediately rejected his request. “With all of us here, it wouldn’t be something difficult for us to kill him.”

Lu Jian, from the Lu family, sneered.

Lu Jiang was one of the best warriors in the younger generations as well. Now that he was killed by Lin Xiu at the fight, the Lu family wouldn’t let Lin Xiu get away with it so easily.

Especially when they found out that the man who had killed Lu Jiang was just a nobody that came from earth. Those from the Lu and Wu family had brought a large number of warriors headed towards the mountain peak. There was a huge piece of land that was empty and they could clearly see that Lin Xiu was sitting in the centre.

It looked like Lin Xiu was cultivating with his eyes closed.

“Hmph.”

The old man immediately took out a black gun and aimed it towards Lin Xiu’s head.

Xiu – –

As he pulled the trigger, there was a terrifying looking energy compression ball that was released from the nozzle of the gun!

This was an energy ball that was formed by a large amount of energy being compressed into it. It had a large amount of energy in it and as it headed towards Lin Xiu, it looked as if it was breaking anything apart, including the air around them.

Boom – –

Just when the ball was about to hit Lin Xiu’s head, causing a bloody hole through his head there was a red ‘Yuan’ that appeared around Lin Xiu.

The ‘Yuan’ immediately reflected the energy compression ball.

Koong Loong – – Then, the ball landed on one of the rocks nearby and the huge rock immediately exploded into multiple pieces. At the same time, Lin Xiu who was sitting on the ground, suddenly opened his eyes. As Lin Xiu glared at them, they suddenly felt chills running down their spine as if they had been targeted by some terrifying creature.

“Oh....it is you.” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Lin Xiu looked at the old man standing in front of him and said in a flat tone.

He had already expected for these to come after him but he never thought that there would be so many of them. With the help of his ‘Analytical Eyes’, Lin Xiu could quickly realise that all of them here were high ranking warriors.

Not only were there rank 9 warriors, there were at least 6 of them including the old man who was a master warrior.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frown. With so many of them, it was definitely pressuring.

“What’s wrong? Do you think that you would be able to beat me with so many people?”

As he stood up, he picked up the Dark Edge and pointed at the group of men standing in front of him.

“If I were able to kill Wu Changkong so easily, do you think that would be for you...” As Lin Xiu was speaking about it, he pointed at all of them with his spear. After hearing what Lin Xiu said, the warriors who were prepared to fight Lin Xiu suddenly took one step backwards. When these men thought of how Lin Xiu had just killed Wu Changkong, all of them were reminded of how Lin Xiu was someone scary. “You shouldn’t be frightened by this brat!”

The elder screamed at the men behind him.

“This brat was also injured as well when he fought Wu Changkong. He is now a broken sword.”

The crowd was then reminded by the elder’s words and came back to their senses. They tighten the grip on their weapon and their eyes were now filled with murderous intention.

“You can all try to kill me then.”

Lin Xiu said it with an emotionless expression on his face.

“Kill him this instance!”

The old man waved his hand and with his commands, the warriors started heading towards Lin Xiu with their weapons! When Lin Xiu saw them coming towards him, his pupils shrunk and he swung his black spear at them!

As Lin Xiu waved his black spear, there were countless flaming birds that flew towards the group of warriors.
