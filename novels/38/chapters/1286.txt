1287 Baili Haoling Became Powerful

“Useless f*ck.” Baili Haoling stepped out and sneered at Sun Tian who was lying on the ground.

Sun Tian was the one who provoked them. She thought that he would at least be a powerful warrior but he turned out to be a piece of trash.

“You…..!!!”

Sun Tian stared at Baili Haoling who was standing in front of her and he was looking even angrier. Due to the rage that he was feeling, he spat out a mouthful of blood.

!!

It went everywhere.

He rolled his eyes and he almost turned unconscious.

“Rubbish.”

Baili Haoling added on.

Sun Tian was already extremely pissed and upon hearing that, he passed out.

“Sun Tian!”

Zhao Lin quickly ran over to check on him.

“Forget it.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

This warrior was too weak and Lin Xiu was no longer in the mood to fight.

“The warrior gods here are so weak.”

Baili Haoling returned her dagger into the scabbard and pursed her lips.

The warriors here are so bad.

She completely lost interest in them.

“Tsk tsk….young one, it’s just that this dude is too weak.”

Baili Haoling’s words instantly pissed off most of the warriors who were in the training room.

There were already some of them that stood out and mocked Baili Haoling.

“You’re the same as well.”

Baili Haoling stared at the man before her and spoke calmly.

“Would you like to try?”

The warrior held onto a blood red sword and there was a deadly look in his eyes.

The warrior gods here were prideful men and Baili Haoling’s words have made them uncomfortable.

There were a large number of warriors who gathered around her.

“Come.”

Baili Haoling smiled.

She slowly pulled out both the daggers from the scabbard.

“Just do it one by one. None of you should join in the fight.”

Lin Xiu looked at the warriors around them and gave them a clear warning.

When they heard what he said, the rest of the warriors thought of him as a joke.

Why should they care about what Lin Xiu said?

Would he be able to stop what these warriors want? What a joke?

“Daliang, be careful. Don’t kill her.”

There were some warriors who were waiting for a good show to start and even reminded the warrior who held onto a blood-red sword.

The training ground on the highest ground of this hotel allowed fights but it was forbidden to kill anyone.

“Don’t worry. I won’t do that.”

The man known as Daliang showed a cruel smile on his face.

“Let me first tell you that I am the city lord of Tianye City, Yuan Daliang.”

He looked at Baili Haoling and introduced himself.

“You talk too much.”

Baili Haoling frowned as she wasn’t interested in where he came from.

“Damn!”

With that, Yuan Daliang looked incredibly pissed.

He instantly attacked Baili Haoling with his blood-red sword.

“You came at the right time.”

Baili Haoling has been dying to fight. She immediately drew out her dagger and headed for Yuan Daliang.

Clang clang clang – –

As both the weapons collided with each other, there was a loud explosion that followed.

Yuan Daling thought that Baili Haoling wasn’t a powerful warrior but when their weapons collided with each other, the look on his face changed drastically.

How could this young girl be so powerful?!

Yuan Daling’s hand turned numb as he held onto the long sword.

...

At the same time, Baili Haoling had one dagger that was in contact with his sword and she had another dagger that was free. She raised it above her head and aimed it at Daliang’s head!

Seeing what was happening, Yuan Daling’s pupils shrunk uncontrollably.

Xiu – –

His body instantly disappeared into thin air.

“Huh?”

Baili Haoling raised her brows and looked around.

Where did he go?

At that moment, Yuan Daling instantly disappeared and she couldn’t even feel his breath.

Then, as she looked at the ground, there was a blood-red aura that swarmed around her.

Domain strength?!

“Well…looks like you do have something up your sleeves…”

...

Baili Haoling looked around and she could clearly see Yuan Daling who was now at the opposite end.

The rest of the warriors around stepped back.

The energy released from both warriors was strong. Most warriors around only wanted to watch the show and they didn’t want to be involved in it.

“City lord, what’s…”

Lei Chong was still cultivating when he felt someone grabbing him. When he opened his eyes and saw that it was Lin Xiu, he was terribly confused.

“Haoling and that warrior over there are having a battle.”

Lin Xiu spoke helplessly.

However, Baili Haoling has been holding her urge of fighting for quite some time. It shouldn’t be a problem now to allow her to fight.

Lei Chong noticed that blood-red energy on the ground and his eyes were filled with shock.

What a powerful domain.

“Domain strength? You’re so weak.”

Baili Haoling stared at Yuan Daling and commented briefly.

She didn’t look afraid at all. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

It was as if this domain strength was nothing to her.

“Hmph!”

Yuan Daling sneered. As he swiftly moved his right arm, there was a vast amount of blood-red energy that gathered around him.

These energies then quickly form a blood red human figure.

“Go on!”

With his command, the human figure made of red energy raced toward Baili Haoling!

Baili Haoling looked at those who were coming at her and she didn’t even think of dodging their attacks.

Instead, she transferred her energy onto her daggers and both instantly turned red.

There was also a crossed pair of daggers that appeared above her head!

What was that?!

When the rest of them saw it happening, they were shocked.

“Divine soul!!”

Some of the more powerful ones finally recognised it!

It was a divine soul and a red grade at that!!!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Then, Baili Haoling instantly chopped the red figure into tWo halves.

He instantly demolished them!

How was that possible?!

Seeing what had happened, Yuan Daling’s pupil shrunk uncontrollably!

That figure had been built by his most powerful energy. How was it that she destroyed them so easily?!

What weapon was that?!

It definitely wasn’t because of the dagger. Could it be the…..divine souls?!

As he stared at the crossed daggers that are blood red above Baili Haoling’s head, the look on his face changed drastically.
