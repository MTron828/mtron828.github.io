Chapter 507: 1 vs 100

“205…. Should be here.” Lin Xiu held Dark Edge in his hands and walked towards one of the mansions.

There was a mansion with the number 205 that was mentioned by the man earlier.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu walked towards it, kicked the door open, and entered the mansion.

The mansion was huge and it was filled with lots of peculiar things that looked high-tech.

Plus, when he took a closer look, there was a projector in the living room and it was showing the scene of the main gates to the Zhao Estate.

“Oh? Looks like I’ve been found.” Lin Xiu felt a little sorry as he mumbled to himself.

“He’s there!” At the same time, there were about a hundred men that surrounded the entire Mansion No.205.

“That bastard! How dare he come looking for us at our home?!” Zhao Xia said to himself as he stood at a distance from the building that was once his home.

Pakk – –

As soon as he opened his mouth, he was slapped by his father, Zhao Xiong.

“Father, you…” Zhao Xia widened his eyes in surprise and stared at his father in disbelief.

“If it wasn’t because you messed with this monster, we wouldn’t have lost so many people!” Zhao Xiong glared at his sound as he was mad at his useless son.

As he thought of how all of his men had died except for one, he couldn’t control his anger.

“Useless.” There were some of them from the rest of the Zhao family that sneered at Zhao Xiao as well.

“Keep quiet.” An old man with a head full of white head said in a cold tone.

As soon as he spoke up, everyone else around him kept their mouths shut.

This was the head of the Zhao family, Zhao Lin.

“We will talk about that later. For now, we have to get rid of this fella who dares mess with the Zhao family.” Zhao Lin said to the rest of them.

“If this gets out, the entire Zhao family would be embarrassed.”

Every member of the Zhao family nodded their head in agreement.

If this gets out, it would definitely be a shameful matter for the entire family.

Zhao Xia knew better than to say a word but his eyes were filled with hatred.

“Bomb it.” Zhao Lin waved his hands and commanded his men.

“Yes!” After getting the signal, all of them moved backward.

From the distance, there was a group of men who were carrying a heavy bazooka. After adjusting the bazooka to the correct angle, they immediately fire it!

Koong Loong – –

As the rocket landed on Mansion No.205, there was a huge explosion and the entire mansion blew up into pieces.

“Cough… Cough…”

There was thick, black smoke that came from the explosion and some of them who were further up front started coughing.

“Is he dead?!” Zhao Xia tried to open his eyes wide so that he could see the scene before him.

But, the only thing that he could see was ashes and smoke. He couldn’t really see what was happening.

“This is a G55 rocket. The explosive force may not be the strongest but it comes with a corrosive liquid. That fella is definitely dead.” One of the members of the Zhao family told Zhao Xia.

There were still a hundred men that remained on their spot. They didn’t move and had their eyes fixed on the scene before them.

As the smoke slowly disappeared, they could slowly see the view much clearer than before.

“This welcoming ceremony seems to be a little grand.”

Then, a loud voice rang throughout the area.

When they heard his voice, Zhao Xiao and Zhao Xiong were shocked and their pupils shrank uncontrollably.

Especially Zhao Xia, who has already started screaming, “He’s not dead! He’s not dead!”

“Shut it!” Zhao Xiong was shocked as well but when he heard his son panicking, he felt embarrassed and quickly told him to shut up.

Zhao Xia bit onto his lips. There was still hatred in his eyes but now, they were mixed with a hint of fear.

“Kill him.” Zhao Lin saw Lin Xiu who was standing in the middle of the chaos. He looked undisturbed. Although Zhao Lin was truly shocked by what happened, he still maintained a calm, peaceful look on the outside.

After he gave the commands, the men who were standing in a circle, surrounding the remains of Mansion No.205, held their guns and started shooting at Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu looked at the laser beams that were headed towards his direction and narrowed his eyes.

At that moment, a pale blue screen appeared on Lin Xiu’s body.

“Yuan!”

Plus, Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’ was a little different than the others. His one was filled with lightning surrounding it and it looked peculiar.

Lin Xiu managed to block all the laser beams with ‘Yuan’ and it wasn’t able to do any damage to Lin Xiu.

“That’s ‘Yuan’?!”

At the same time, the rest of the Zhao family realized what was happening and all of their facial expressions changed.

They finally understood why the rocket didn’t kill him. It was because Lin Xiu was able to release ‘Yuan’!

Plus, this one looked completely different from the other warriors. It looked as if Lin Xiu’s one was much better than the others.

“He can activate ‘Yuan’! This fella is a rank 6 warrior?!” Zhao Xiong widened his eyes in surprise as well.

He was aware that Zhao Xia had provoked an extremely powerful enemy but he didn’t know that Lin Xiu was a rank 6 warrior! FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

And he is such a young rank 6 warrior.

With one simple thought, he started wondering how powerful this young man’s family would be if they were able to produce such a young and powerful rank 6 warrior.

Zhao Xiong took a deep breath as well.

“Why didn’t you say so before?!”

After hearing his father’s raging question, Zhao Xia’s body started shaking uncontrollably as well. From his sixth sense, he could guess that Lin Xiu might be a rank 6 warrior but he thought that his family would be able to kill him. He had no idea that Lin Xiu would be such a powerful man.

Lin Xiu wasn’t bothered by how shocked these people were. He carried his spear and continued walking towards them.

The laser beams were like droplets of rain that were all blocked from touching Lin Xiu by his protective shield.

The one hundred men that stood with their heavy machinery weren’t even a threat to Lin Xiu!

As Lin Xiu took one step forward, the men took one step backward.

He was able to move a hundred men alone!

“Fighters, get over here. The Shadow Squad, come here as well!” Zhao Lin had a fierce look in his eyes as he shouted for his men.

The Zhao family has never encountered something like this which was why the entire family was involved. There were hundreds of people who gathered together, surrounding Lin Xiu so that he wouldn’t be able to escape.

“Master!” Then, a group of men who were dressed in black with either machetes or swords gathered right in front of Zhao Lin.

The man leading them had a scar on his face and he looked extremely fierce. He was on one knee as he greeted Zhao Lin.

“Shadow, get rid of him.” Zhao Lin’s eyes were on Lin Xiu, who was slowly walking towards them.

“Yes, Sir!” The man who was known as Shadow nodded his head. After that, he led his men, dressed in black, and dashed towards Lin Xiu!
