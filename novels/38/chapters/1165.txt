1166 The Ruins Appear

Before he could make any move, Lin Xiu’s figure had already leaped over!

what is this!?

Lin Xiu, who jumped up, suddenly saw a Dark Edge spear in his hand.

The long spear was swung and one after another terrifying dark blue flaming birds rushed towards his body!

Within the space enclosed by this matrix, even if he wanted to escape, he would have absolutely no way!

And Lin Xiu released too many flaming birds at this time.

They charged towards his body from all directions.

Now, he has no chance of dodging at all!

boom boom boom —

Soon, those dark blue flaming birds all impacted his body.

Just now because the long sword pierced through his ‘Sphere’, although it did not completely penetrate and break it, it made his ‘Sphere’ extremely unstable.

At this time, with the impact of these flaming birds, he suddenly felt an incomparably hot sensation.

It was as if the whole body would be melted by burning.

what!!!

He roared in his heart and the strength of his whole body burst out at this moment.

He frantically reinforces the ‘Sphere’ that he has unfolded.

“Break it!”

And at this time, Lin Xiu had already rushed down from the sky!

In the entire Dark Edge spear, there is a large amount of black energy substances.

These black energy substances instantly formed the shape of a huge black dragon, showing its teeth and claws and charged towards the man below!

Boom—

With a loud sound, the entire ground shook wildly.

Suddenly, a thick layer of dust flew around like a terrifying missile had exploded.

If it wasn’t for Lin Xiu’s use of a matrix to enclose a space, all the surrounding buildings would have been destroyed because of this skill.

At this time, as the thick dust slowly settled, Lin Xiu’s figure slowly appeared.

The pale golden matrices around them also slowly disappeared at this time.

Taking a closer look at this time, the God warrior-level warrior just now had turned into a corpse lying on the ground.

In the area around him, a huge pit appeared.

Those warriors not far away, watching this scene, their eyes were full of shock.

A God warrior-level warrior in the Divine Domain was killed just like that!

For them, this is really unbelievable.

“Get out of here in a minute.”

Lin Xiu glanced at the surrounding warriors, then said lightly.

This is the city lord’s mansion and he is the city lord of this city.

These warriors want to find the so-called relics in his mansion unscrupulously, isn’t it just a slap in the face.

“You kid, who do you think you are?”

At this time, a warrior heard Lin Xiu’s words and laughed out loud.

swoosh—

Just as he finished speaking, Lin Xiu waved his spear and a flaming bird charged towards him directly!

Looking at this scene, the pupils in the man’s eyes shrank slightly.

He wanted to dodge, but the flaming bird was too fast.

He has no way to dodge!

Boom—

In the next moment, the flaming bird directly hit his body and a loud sound erupted.

Taking a closer look, his body has been directly hit by the flames and burst to pieces.

“Thirty seconds.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

The surrounding warriors looked at this scene and their faces became extremely ugly.

Lin Xiu’s strength was really terrifying. With a swing of his spear, he released a terrifying flame, killing a powerful warrior.

And thinking of Lin Xiu’s killing of the warriors in Divine Domain just now, he didn’t even blink.

Although the ruins are good, their lives were more important ah! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The man in front of him was obviously not very kind.

“let’s go.”

Some warriors have no choice but to leave quickly.

They did not doubt whether Lin Xiu would kill them after thirty seconds.

Because looking at Lin Xiu’s eyes, he was very firm.

After watching the surrounding warriors leave, Lin Xiu suddenly showed a sneer.

This is his city.

boom boom boom —

At this moment, Lin Xiu felt that the entire ground was shaking slightly.

What is happening?

Lin Xiu, who felt the shock, also showed surprise in his eyes.

Turning around, he saw that there seemed to be cracks in the pit that he had just created.

What is this!?

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened slightly as he watched this scene.

It seems that his attack had triggered something!

boom boom boom —

At this time, the tremors became more intense. It had already stopped snowing today, but at this time, heavy snow fell from the sky again.

This strange scene shocked Lin Xiu.

The surrounding ground was all cracked at this time.

Then it exploded directly!

Lin Xiu reacted very quickly and her figure appeared directly in the air.

Looking up, this compound had collapsed.

Below, it seems to be an endless abyss.

“Relics! Relics appeared!!!”

Although those warriors were driven away just now, there were still some warriors, who felt the strong shock from here and all flew over.

They looked at the abyss-like scene below and they were extremely excited.

“Hahaha, it seems that I, Zhao Laosan, came here at the right time!”

At this time, a middle-aged man with a big belly came over with a huge sword.

“The Zhao Laosan of the Murder Shrine is here too!?”

The surrounding warriors who were suspended in the air also exclaimed at this time.

This Zhao Laosan was a very powerful well-known god warrior. They did not expect that such a person would also be interested in the ancient ruins in a small city.

At this time, more and more warriors gathered at this time and the whole sky was a group of black figures.

Lin Xiu frowned slightly when he saw this scene.

Using the Analytic eye to scan across, Lin Xiu can clearly know the strength and attributes of all warriors.

Among these warriors, there are quite a few warriors of the God warrior level.

And that Zhao Laosan was not an easy person. Lin Xiu found out that his analytic eye had no way to analyze him.

At this time, there was no way to stop these warriors from coming here.

“City Lord…”

Mr. Pang, standing on the other side, was just about to come over.

But looking at the place that suddenly collapsed into an abyss, his eyes were full of horror.

“You leave first.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Now he wanted to see what was going on underneath that made all these warriors come.
