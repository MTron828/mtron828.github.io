1268 The Heaven-swallowing Rollie

He could clearly see that his feet had been frozen.

And these ice cubes were still spreading and soon spread to his waist!

Liu Mo’s face changed drastically and his body burst out with strength, wanting to shatter these ice cubes.

But he found that no matter how hard he tried, these ice cubes couldn’t be shattered.

Impossible, impossible, how could he suddenly become so strong!?

Liu Mo roared in his heart.

What he didn’t know was that although Lin Xiu’s power has become stronger, his power was constantly disappearing and becoming weaker.

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t give Liu Mo any chance.

‘Flashing Souls’ body skill was activated and in the next moment, he appeared in front of Liu Mo.

There was an extremely terrifying energy gathering in the fist of the right hand.

‘Destroy the Sky’!

All the power in his body was gathered in his hands and the power emanating from this god-level skill became even stronger.

But when Lin Xiu’s fist was about to hit Liu Mo’s head, Liu Mo showed a strange smile.

“You… you will also be buried with me…”

Boom——

As soon as he said his last words, Lin Xiu’s punch hit him directly on the head.

An incomparably loud sound erupted.

His head was blown off by Lin Xiu!

“Ding! Congratulations, master, for killing a warrior at the level of a warrior, gaining experience 1654796154…”

At this time, Lin Xiu also heard the sound of gained experience in his mind.

There were simply too many numbers from this increase in experience and it was confusing to see.

“Phew.”

Seeing Liu Mo’s head explode and falling below, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but heaved a sigh of relief.

With Liu Mo’s death, those domains that could create black lightning also began to disappear.

And at this moment, Rollie’s huge body flew over and let Lin Xiu stand on his head.

A white light was also released from Rollie’s body, then transmitted to Lin Xiu’s body.

At this moment, Lin Xiu could clearly feel a sense of comfort coming from it.

Is this the kind of power that heals oneself from the sequelae of ‘Fury’?

However, the duration of Fury was not over yet so Lin Xiu was not too sure about it.

“Are you OK?”

Baili Haoling flew over at this time, then spoke to Lin Xiu.

“I’m fine.”

“What about you? Are you okay?”

Lin Xiu shook his head, then looked at Baili Haoling’s arms and shoulders with many injuries.

Just now she faced several God warriors by herself. Although those God warriors were not as powerful as Liu Mo, they were also difficult to deal with.

“By the way, did you see that person?”

Lin Xiu looked around and saw that there were no living warriors around.

“No.”

Of course, Baili Haoling knew that Lin Xiu was talking about the man who attacked the energy barrier of Lingxian City for seven days and seven nights with the Frosty giant sword.

But during the battle just now, the man was indeed not found.

“Strange, isn’t he from Changqing City?”

Lin Xiu frowned and said as if talking to himself.

Could it be someone from Haiwang City? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

But it doesn’t look like it…

And the people from Haiwang City even made a special trip to apologize and presented the odd crystals.

Lin Xiu shook his head and didn’t think much. He looked at the City Lord’s Mansion in Changqing City not far below.

The City Lord’s Mansion in Changqing City looks much more imposing than the City Lord’s Mansion in Shachang City.

“You can search for things again!”

Baili Haoling’s recovery energy was also quite strong. At this time, the wound has stopped bleeding and she became excited when she thought of going to the warehouse in Changqing City.

Seeing Baili Haoling’s reaction, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but smile.

Now the warriors in the entire Changqing City were almost completely gone.

The entire City Lord’s Mansion was also empty.

This time, Lin Xiu found the warehouse very quickly.

Those warriors guarding the warehouse had already fled.

...

And this warehouse was the same as the warehouse in Shachang City, although it can only be opened with specific iris and dna certification.

However, relying on Lin Xiu’s ‘Fury’, he directly threw a punch, destroying all these defensive devices.

“Damn!”

After entering the warehouse in Changqing City, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

Baili Haoling was also very surprised.

Because there were too many Odd crystals in this warehouse.

If the odd crystals they saw in Shachang City seemed to be piled up like a small hill, then the odd crystals in Changqing City were piled up like a peak.

Although there were many low-level Odd crystals, seeing this scene was shocking enough.

Lin Xiu was shocked for a while, then came back to his senses.

After all, Changqing City was the superior city of many small cities and those small cities pay a lot of tribute to Changqing City every year.

Coupled with the original strength of Changqing City, it was normal for so many Odd crystals to be stored in the warehouse after so many years.

...

Continuing to search inside, Lin Xiu found that there were not only odd crystals, but also many high-quality battle uniform weapons and other things inside.

But there were too many of these things and there was simply no room in his expansion space.

Lin Xiu, who was planning to make a return trip, remembered that Rollie seems to be able to swallow these things and bring them back.

“Rollie, can you take all these things back?”

After Lin Xiu put all the god-level Odd crystals into the expansion space, looking at the remaining Odd crystals, a large number of weapons and equipment and various precious materials, he couldn’t help saying.

“Gu gu!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Rollie suddenly made a crisp sound.

Soon, it opened its mouth wide and absorbed a large number of items.

Those piles of Odd crystals and materials were all absorbed crazily by Rollie.

Rollie was like a black hole, no matter how much it has absorbed, it can still continue absorbing.

“All sucked into the stomach?”

After Rollie absorbed it, Lin Xiu looked at the huge empty warehouse, his eyes widened.

His eyes were also full of shock.

This was simply like a divine beast that can swallow the sky and the earth.

It’s too scary.

After searching the things here, Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling were ready to go back.

“Lin Xiu, are you ready to bring together the Changqing City and Shachang City?”

Baili Haoling, who was sitting on Xiaobai’s back, said to Lin Xiu who was sitting on the other side.

“Now the power of the two cities has been wiped out. If we don’t occupy them, other warriors will occupy them too and it’s inevitable that new warriors will come to cause trouble.”

Before Lin Xiu could speak, Baili Haoling continued to explain.

“I do have this consideration.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly and said.

Moreover, he thought of another thing.
