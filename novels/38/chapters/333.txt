Chapter 334: The Death of Zhang Jie

Lin Xiu used all his strength to release this blow and now his body was a little limp. Also, because of the huge impact, Lin Xiu hit the ground directly.

Boom boom——

The loud explosions continued. Lin Xiu, who was half sitting on the ground feebly, could clearly see that the fire phoenix made up of the hundreds of phoenixes released by him, hit Zhang Jie’s body, then began spinning crazily, forming a huge fire tornado.

And because Luo Yue released the Ice lotus fire as well, at this time, these two flames, which seemed to have opposite attributes, produced a very terrifying reaction, forming a scary fire tornado of red and white.

At this moment, the surrounding wind seemed to be surging and Lin Xiu couldn’t help blocking his eyes with his arm.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s expression changed.

She should be dead this time, right?!

“Ah!!!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Zhang Jie, who was in the fire tornado formed by red lotus fire and ice lotus fire, roared loudly at this time.

She sounded like she was in intense pain.

Click, click, click——

At this moment, if you looked closely, you could see that there were a lot of cracks appearing on Zhang Jie’s skin. As the flame tornado continues to spin frantically, all those skins were finally tearing apart, revealing not flesh and blood, but something like a machine.

This woman was really a cyborg!

Lin Xiu saw this scene and the pupils in his eyes constricted.

As time went by, the fire tornado slowly dissipated.

And Zhang Jie, who had just been in the center of the fire tornado, seemed to have burnt all the skin on her whole body and she became like a robot now, only her cheeks looked normal.

Click, click, click——

There was a lot of white smoke coming out of her body.

Luo Yue suppressed the sharp pain in her shoulder and grasped her long sword with her right hand, staring at Zhang Jie over there.

Is she… dead?

“Hahaha… do you think… this will kill me!” Just when Lin Xiu and Luo Yue both held their breath and were about to see if Zhang Jie was dead, a chilling voice came over.

Hearing this voice, Lin Xiu’s expression changed and he found that Zhang Jie’s body could move slowly.

Then in the next moment, she rushed directly to Lin Xiu with a ‘swish’!!!

Click, click, click——

There was no skin on her five fingers and they looked like a robot’s fingers with very sharp fingertips.

Her body seemed to move faster now as she rushed in front of Lin Xiu in an instant, then with a violent wave of her right hand, she attacked Lin Xiu’s body!

She seemed to want to use her claws to tear Lin Xiu’s body apart.

Dang–

Just then, Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge Spear blocked directly.

The tip of the spear collided with Zhang Jie’s robotic fingers and a lot of sparks were emitted.

Moreover, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the tremendous force from the Dark Edge Spear.

What’s happening!?

Why is this woman still so strong?

Didn’t the flames just now have a huge impact on her!?

With this thought, Lin Xiu’s expression changed. He gritted his teeth and the Dark Edge Spear in his hand continued stabbing towards Zhang Jie’s body!

But Zhang Jie’s reaction speed was indeed very fast and at this time it was easy to dodge Lin Xiu’s attacks.

Then she used her own hand to grab Lin Xiu.

Dang dang dang——

Now Zhang Jie’s speed was very fast. Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge Spear was about to stab her but her attacks were too savage and Lin Xiu could only dodge or use his weapon to dodge, he didn’t have any other choice.

But when resisting Zhang Jie’s attacks, Lin Xiu could clearly see that there were many small sparks bursting out of Zhang Jie’s robot-like body.

It seemed that the flames released by him and Luo Yue just now had affected her somehow.

“Go to hell!!!” Zhang Jie looked terrifying as if she was about to kill Lin Xiu.

When Lin Xiu blocked her increasingly aggressive attacks, he looked to the front and could see Luo Yue rushing over from behind with her long sword!

The look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed, but he still blocked Zhang Jie’s attacks.

“Did you think that you can kill me this way? Ahahahaha!!!” Zhang Jie seemed to have lost her mind and kept swinging her robotic hands toward Lin Xiu.

Dang dang dang——

While Zhang Jie was attacking Lin Xiu wildly, Luo Yue was already charging over with her long sword!

“Die!” Zhang Jie pierced her sharp fingers towards Lin Xiu’s body.

Lin Xiu’s expression changed. This time, he did not continue to block with his Dark Edge Spear, but let her fingers penetrate his body directly.

When her arm was in Lin Xiu’s body, Lin Xiu’s other hand grabbed her other arm.

Zhang Jie’s expression changed drastically and she seemed to sense something wrong, then suddenly she wanted to pull out the arm that penetrated Lin Xiu’s body, only to find that her arm seemed to be stuck. There was no way of pulling it out!

And at this moment, she clearly felt a very powerful energy wave behind her.

“Damn!!!” Zhang Jie was struggling frantically at this time, but Lin Xiu didn’t give her any chance and grabbed her arm firmly. The arm that penetrated Lin Xiu’s body was completely stuck and there was no way of pulling her arm out of Lin Xiu’s body.

The long sword in Luo Yue’s hand was already covered in white flames at this moment. The second she was behind Zhang Jie, she slashed directly at Zhang Jie’s head!

“No!!!” Zhang Jie seemed to feel something and she had a look of panic on her face.

But it was too late now, the long sword covered in ice lotus fire had already slashed across her neck!
