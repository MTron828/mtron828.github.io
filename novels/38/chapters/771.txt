Chapter 772: Strange Liquid

With a loud sound, the spear stabbed the ice sculpture and a loud sound was heard in an instant.

This ice sculpture shattered directly.

And it was the head that shattered!

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for killing the dark stone beast and gaining experience 4674612154...”

A series of prompts for gaining experience came from the system.

Lin Xiu didn’t look at the specific experience points but looked at the experience progress bar and it only increased by 5%.

Then, if he killed two of these again, would he be able to gain 10% more experience?

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu’s eyes showed a fiery look.

Without further hesitation, he continued to wave the Dark Edge spear in his hand and attacked the two dark stone beasts!

clack clack——

And just when Lin Xiu wanted to continue killing the two dark stone beasts in the same way, he found that the ice on the dark stone beasts had already cracked!

When the spear pierced through, the ice on the body exploded directly!

Roar–

When the Dark Stone Beast, who had just broken free from the ice, let out a roar, Lin Xiu’s spear had already stabbed its head!

Although this time, Lin Xiu’s sharp spear did not directly penetrate its head, but it had already caused a wound.

Some light blue blood sputtered out at this time.

This suddenly made the dark stone beast even crazier.

With its mouth wide open, it wanted to use its sharp teeth to tear Lin Xiu apart. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

But Lin Xiu would definitely not let it succeed.

In this state, his body was like a phantom, dodging quickly.

And while dodging, the spear in his hand stabbed out again,

Because in the state of ‘Fury’, a more powerful and terrifying source strength covered the weapon, making the weapon even sharper.

Clank—

The entire weapon also trembled slightly, making a strange sound.

The other dark stone beast also broke free at this time, then attacked Lin Xiu.

While Lin Xiu dodged the attacks of the two dark stone beasts, the spear kept stabbing out.

The sharp spear tip is constantly stabbing its body at this time, no matter how hard their skin is, there are already scars at this time!

Roar–

Watching one of the nine dark stone beasts open their mouths and fly over, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly.

This time, there was no dodging, but instead, he used the spear in his hand to stab directly at it!

boom–

The spear pierced directly into its mouth from bottom to top!

It penetrated directly from the upper mucosa in the mouth!

And at this moment, the body of the Dark Edge spear burst out with a dark red flame, which was released directly at the penetrating wound!

Boom—

With a loud noise, the body of the dark stone beasts exploded directly!

And the last dark stone beast wanted to pounce on Lin Xiu.

Because Lin Xiu killed the other two dark stone beasts, it seemed to become even crazier.

Constantly spewing out terrifying flames from its mouth!

“Let’s compare, who’s flame is more powerful!”

Lin Xiu looked at the flames it spewed out and at this time, he also roared and the spear in his hand swung.

Using the spear as a transmission, at this moment, a large number of dark red flames were released from the spear.

Red Lotus Fire!

The flames impacted and a large number of flames impacted away in an instant.

The two flames appeared as if they were evenly matched.

“Go!!!”

But soon, the red lotus fire transformed by Lin Xiu’s majestic source strength became even more terrifying.

In the next instant, the fire slammed into the dark stone beast’s body!

boom boom boom —

A large number of red lotus fires covered its body!

Roar–

The dark stone beast seemed to feel severe pain and at this time it kept roaring.

Lin Xiu, who was holding the Dark Edge spear, rushed over directly and with a sweep of the spear in his hand, he directly chopped off its head!

boom–

As the light blue blood splashed out, its huge body also fell directly to the ground at this moment.

clap clap-

Because of Lin Xiu’s skills, the surrounding area was like ice and snow.

But at this time, the ice and snow began to slowly melt away.

Inside the cave, the scorching scene just now resumed.

“Finally...”

Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief at this time.

With his current strength, coupled with ‘Fury’, it is not too difficult to deal with these rank 10 dark stone beasts, but Lin Xiu was afraid that it took too much time and he might be in trouble later if there were too many variables.

And even though the dark stone beasts had been killed now, Lin Xiu still has a faint feeling of unease.

This feeling was very strange.

“There should be nothing else, right?”

Lin Xiu frowned slightly, then glanced around.

But he found that nothing else appeared around.

Strange.

Could it be that he was overthinking?

Lin Xiu didn’t think much about it at this time and directly approached the light blue liquid.

As soon as he approached it, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the energy contained in this liquid was simply too powerful.

“How can such a strange thing be produced.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but exclaim in amazement.

The energy of these things can’t even be compared to the odd crystals of king-level evolved beasts.

Thinking that the evolved beasts just now seemed to be licking this kind of light blue liquid, Lin Xiu was a little hesitant at this time.

Are these things edible?

Lin Xiu subconsciously reached out and touched it.

At this moment, Lin Xiu felt like he was being sucked in!

Damn it!

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide and before he could react, he fell into the blue liquid pool.

These liquids were very strange, making people feel as if they have entered the smooth and tender fruit jelly.

And this seems to be a naturally formed pool. Although it’s not big, it’s deep enough to drown Lin Xiu’s entire body.

Lin Xiu, who originally wanted to break free, suddenly felt a cold feeling all over his body.

And what made Lin Xiu even more incredible was that his entire body seemed to be surrounded by incomparably majestic energy.

It is so full of this energy that it looks like there are countless odd crystals around him, supplying energy for him to absorb.

Roar–

At the same time, the Raging Flame Lion outside seemed to have sensed something and suddenly let out a huge roar.

The pair of huge flame wings flapped wildly at this moment.
