Chapter 315: The Ice Lotus Fire Appears

The water in the lake was starting to slosh.

The surrounding ground was shaking violently, some small cracks even appeared on the rocks.

What’s happening?

“Ice Lotus Fire! The Ice Lotus Fire is about to appear!” Some warriors looked at the lake then muttered to themselves.

But they didn’t dare to go down at all, because the water of the lake was too weird, who knew if they would die if they jumped down.

Even if they are rank 7 warriors, they didn’t have such courage.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were at the bottom of the lake and they also felt this strong shock.

There were cracks in the rocks around 　　.

“Why did it shake all of a sudden…” Lin Xiu carefully stabilized himself and said.

Luo Yue nodded slightly, then looked around, but didn’t see anything.

The so-called Ice Lotus Fire was still not found.

“Here.” But just then, Luo Yue looked at the other side and said faintly.

“What?” Lin Xiu was taken aback and asked instinctively.

At this moment, he turned and looked to the side, following Luo Yue’s line of sight to the other side and he suddenly saw a ray of light.

“That thing again?” Lin Xiu said when he saw the light.

Because just now, Lin Xiu also saw this light and it was the light that surrounded his body.

But Luo Yue shook her head and said, “No.”

‘It isn’t?’

“This is Ice Lotus Fire.” Luo Yue said plainly.

“Ice Lotus Fire!?” Hearing this, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and the pupils in his eyes constricted sharply.

Then, he walked over with Luo Yue and they saw that there was a small flame in the middle of the crack caused by the continuous shaking of the ground.

This flame was white in color and it was like the wick of a burning candle in the lake. It was still burning without being affected by the water of the lake.

Lin Xiu continued to look at the flame and suddenly felt his body tremble, a kind of chill that penetrated into his bone marrow, instantly spreading to his whole body.

Could it be caused by this flame?

“That’s right, this is the Ice Lotus Fire.” Luo Yue stared at the Ice Lotus Fire and said aloud.

She slowly approached the flame then squatted down and wanted to touch the flame with his hands.

“Be careful!”

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue. At this moment, it was obvious that Luo Yue’s expression seemed a little odd and he immediately called out.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue jumped and the expression in her eyes seemed to change back to the original state.

“I’m fine.” Luo Yue shook her head slightly and said.

At that moment, she had this feeling of wanting to touch the Ice Lotus Fire directly with her hands. It wasn’t what she wanted to do and she seemed to have gone over involuntarily.

This Ice Lotus Fire is weird.

Crash——

At this time, those people at the lake above could see a large vortex appearing in the center of the lake. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ice Lotus Fire! It’s mine!” Seeing this scene, a warrior sensed that the Ice Lotus Fire had really appeared. These warriors couldn’t help but jump directly into the lake!

They were not fools. The moment they jumped in, their source strength burst out in an instant and directly surrounded their bodies.

Plop plop——

As one warrior jumped into the lake first, the faces of the other warriors changed and all of them jumped into the lake!

“How do we take this Ice Lotus Fire away now?” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue.

The Ice Lotus Fire was found but the cold sensation caused by the Ice Lotus Fire made Lin Xiu tremble slightly.

This is terrifying.

“No, the Ice Lotus Fire hasn’t fully opened yet.” Luo Yue shook her head, looked at the lotus flower, and said faintly.

Hasn’t fully opened yet?

Lin Xiu was surprised and looked at this thing, puzzled.

The Ice Lotus Fire that was originally like a small flame seemed to be slowly getting bigger.

And this flame looked like a lotus flower blooming.

It was a magical scene.

“Wait for it to become a lotus-like shape?” Lin Xiu stared at the Ice Lotus Fire then asked.

“Yeah.” Luo Yue nodded.

The two of them looked at this Ice Lotus Fire, wanting to wait for the Ice Lotus Fire to fully open, but what they didn’t expect was that at this moment, black shadows came from above.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, who clearly felt something, looked up and saw that there were many warriors. Their figures were surrounded by source strength and were constantly descending.

“Warriors are here!” Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and he called out.

Luo Yue also noticed the figures of these warriors at this time and frowned slightly.

“Let’s go over there first.” Luo Yue thought about it for a moment and quickly made a decision.

Then in the next moment, she took Lin Xiu’s hand and walked to the other side without any explanation.

They hid behind a raised rock on the other side.

At this moment, as the bodies of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were against the deep blue rocks, the light on their bodies instantly became much dimmer.

Hiding here at this time, those warriors would not find them at all under normal circumstances.

Ice Lotus Fire!!!

The location of the Ice Lotus Fire was too conspicuous, these warriors could easily find it.

And these were all powerful warriors above the rank 7, and their source strength was very terrifying.

With their powerful source strength covering their bodies and their already very formidable physical strength, they could still move under this lake and were not as constricted as Lin Xiu when he first fell into the lake.

Lin Xiu held his breath and watched this scene carefully. Will these warriors take away the Ice Lotus Fire?

When these warriors saw the Ice Lotus Fire, they all swam wildly towards the area of the Ice Lotus Fire.

Just when a man who rushed to the front wanted to touch the Ice Lotus Fire directly, a warrior behind took out a dagger from his pocket and pierced his body!

Bang–

There was a dull sound under the lake. As his dagger stabbed the man, a powerful force instantly killed the man who wanted to touch the Ice Lotus Fire first!
