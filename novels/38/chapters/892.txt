Chapter 893: Holy-level Skill Card (2)

Zhao Yongyuan pointed to the huge glass ball in front of him and said aloud.

Lin Xiu was slightly stunned and walked over there.

Standing in front of the huge glass sphere, Lin Xiu could clearly see that in the ray of light in the middle of the glass sphere, there was a skill card emitting white light.

It was without a doubt that it was a holy-level skill card!

Although he didn’t know what kind of skill this holy-level skill card was, Lin Xiu was still a little excited at this time.

After all, the power of the holy-level skill that he used through the system skills was so powerful that it was enough to prove how strong this holy-level skill would be.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Xiu approached the glass ball, then began to slowly reach out and touch it.

The moment his hand touched the glass sphere, Lin Xiu was surprised to find that his hand was able to directly pass through the glass and reach into it.

That mass of white light seemed to contain extremely powerful power.

That kind of terrifying power made Lin Xiu feel a little scared.

What kind of power is this!?

Although Lin Xiu was a little hesitant at this time, he still gritted his teeth and reached out to the group of white light.

The moment his hand touched the white light, Lin Xiu suddenly felt a strong tingling sensation.

......

This intense pain made Lin Xiu want to retract his hand.

But Lin Xiu found that his hand seemed to be sucked by the white light.

He couldn’t pull it out at all.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s entire palm turned red.

The veins on his palms seemed to protrude.

When Zhao Yongyuan saw this scene, the expression in his eyes did not change at all.

As if from the very beginning, he had expected this result.

Lin Xiu also felt that his palm was about to burst.

But his hand was sucked by this powerful force and there was no way to pull it out.

Just when Lin Xiu’s palm swelled as if it was about to explode, Lin Xiu felt that his chest seemed to start beating rapidly.

The cluster of white light on the chest that has become weak seems to be active again!

This cluster of white light was passed down by the old man in the Sacred Region Academy Tower of Trial.

At this time, with the activity of the white light in his heart, the white light that nearly caused his hand to burst seemed to become gentler slowly.

These white lights used his palm as a medium and were attracted to the white light in his chest.

Pouring crazily into his body!

A large amount of white light energy poured into his body crazily!

Zhao Yongyuan, who was originally standing on the ground expressionless, saw this strange scene and his eyes widened.

There was a shocking look in his eyes.

“Finally here, finally here…” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He was mumbling to himself and his body seemed to shake slightly because of excitement.

Lin Xiu, on the other hand, entered a state of ecstasy.

At this time, as a large amount of white light poured into his body, Lin Xiu could clearly feel a relatively comfortable feeling.

It was cooling.

The painful feeling just now has completely disappeared.

A large amount of white light converged towards Lin Xiu’s heart at this time.
