1189 We’re Not Leaving

“Ahhhhh!!!”

The man then let out a huge cry.

His fist instantly exploded!

There was blood and flesh that landed everywhere.

The rest of the warriors were stunned as well when they saw what happened.

They didn’t think that things would actually end up this way.

However, Lin Xiu did not stop. He continued attacking his opponent with both his fists.

Boom boom boom – –

Each punch landed heavily on the man’s body.

There was a loud sound that followed every punch.

In the end, the man’s body was destroyed by Lin Xiu’s punches.

The entire floor was filled with blood and flesh.

Those who sat closer to the ring had their faces covered in blood as well.

The entire crowd was shocked.

They couldn’t have imagined that such a strong man had died.

Plus, this man died because of Lin Xiu’s punches.

“The EXP from it is quite little…”

As Lin Xiu got rid of the blood on his fist, he muttered to himself about the EXP that he had just received.

Then, he glanced at the warriors and asked, “Anyone else?”

The rest of the warriors subconsciously took one step back after hearing the question from Lin Xiu.

Their eyes were filled with fear.

The muscular man looked so strong but in the end, he was killed by Lin Xiu’s punches!

It was terrifying to watch.

“Me!”

However, the temptation for the odd crystal was strong. Even when Lin Xiu had already shown how powerful he was, this warrior still decided to give it a try.

“Let’s do it then.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

Boom – –

Soon, there was a loud explosion in the arena. The warrior’s body was like a kite that had been cut from its string and he flew out of the ring.

Then, he laid in a pool of blood.

“Anyone else?”

Lin Xiu still remained his calm voice.

“Me!!!!”

There were a few more warriors who got on stage.

However, all of the warriors were easily killed by Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu did not give them any chance.

“Anyone else?”

After killing most of the warriors, Lin Xiu continued asking the crowd if there’s anyone who wants to challenge him.

The crowd was already looking at Lin Xiu with eyes filled with fear.

This time, there was truly no one else who dared to challenge him.

“Since there’s no one else, that belongs to me?” VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Lin Xiu asked the referee who was standing behind him.

“Yes….yes.”

The referee quickly answered. Then, he looked around and asked again, “Is there anyone else who wants to challenge him?”

There was silence in the whole arena.

“Congratulations, this odd crystal is yours now!”

The referee said with a fake smile on his face.

There should have been more warriors fighting for it. This way, they would be able to earn more energy stones.

This was because most warriors would have to pay a thousand energy stones in order to participate.

However, Lin Xiu had killed several powerful warriors continuously and no one else had dared to challenge him.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and took the box from the referee.

Then, he left the ring.

“Damn it! When did you get so powerful?!”

Baili Haoling was still worried about Lin Xiu earlier but seeing how he fought just now, she widened her eyes in shock.

“That’s a secret.”

Lin Xiu showed a mysterious smile on his face.

“Hmph!”

Baili Haoling sneered.

Rollie and Little Bai stood close to Lin Xiu.

They were trying to be as close as possible to Lin Xiu.

“Let’s go.”

Baili Haoling looked at the people around her. Due to how Lin Xiu had won the beast god odd crystal, most of the warriors were looking at them and she was feeling uncomfortable about it.

“No.”

Lin Xiu shook his head after hearing what she said.

“We’re not leaving?”

Baili Haoling was shocked. She didn’t understand what he was thinking.

“I didn’t get everything that I wanted. Why should I leave?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

Then, Lin Xiu started participating in all of the battles in the arena.

Lin Xiu would walk away with all the rewards no matter which battle he participated in.

In these battles, Lin Xiu won with no questions and he killed all of the warriors who dared challenge him.

Soon, Lin Xiu became the warriors’ nightmare at the underground battlefield.

Slowly, there were lesser warriors who would challenge Lin Xiu.

This was because no one would like to die in his arms.

“Don’t you think that this is too much?”

Seeing how Lin Xiu walked away with another reward without fighting anyone, there was a dissatisfied look on Mr Lui’s face.

He initially thought that Lin Xiu would leave after getting his pet but he didn’t think that Lin Xiu would continue joining the other fights.

What he was mad about most was that with Lin Xiu being here, none of the other warriors dared to join the matches.

So, he was walking away with a large amount of rewards.

This was a huge loss for the arena.

This was an underground battlefield and they earn money from the registration fee and also the bets that happen during the fight.

With Lin Xiu being indestructible, none of this was possible.

“Isn’t this your rule?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he questioned Mr Lui.
