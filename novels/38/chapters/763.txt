Chapter 764: The Strong Fist Master

The look in Wan Qianshan’s eyes changed and she took a few steps backwards as well.

“Hmm? You are quite strong.”

Wan Qianshan looked at Lin Xiu and he looked a little surprised.

This was because he could feel that Lin Xiu isn’t a normal warrior.

The strength that Lin Xiu showed just now with his spear belonged to a master warrior.

Therefore, Wan Qianshan had no other choice but to treat this seriously.

“Bro….let us take care of this fella!”

At the same time, Wan Qianshan’s men walked towards them.

“Stay back.”

Wan Qianshan stared at Lin Xiu as he said flatly.

All of them were stunned but they still obeyed Wan Qianshan’s command and did not move at all.

“Young boy….I’m interested in you now.”

As he spoke to Lin Xiu, he gently stretched his back and there was a loud cracking sound heard from his back.

In the next moment, his figure moved and he soon appeared right in front of Lin Xiu!

His fist was headed towards Lin Xiu!

Koong Loong – –

As he threw a fist towards Lin Xiu, there was a loud explosive noise that was heard in the air.

Lin Xiu blocked the attack with his Dark Edge.

With the huge impact, Lin Xiu had to take a few steps back.

As he moved backwards, Lin Xiu turned his spear forward and thrusted it towards the other party!

Xiu xiu – –

As the long spear was being thrusted, there was a sharp piercing noise that surrounded them.

Lin Xiu did not have much experience with fighting fist masters.

” ‘Shock wave’ !”

Wan Qianshan threw another fist and this time, there seemed to be a source field around his fist and it has transformed into a huge translucent fist.

As the huge fist headed towards Lin Xiu, there was a huge explosive sound that appeared at the same time.

It was as if an explosion had happened in that area.

When the rest of them heard the noise, they couldn’t help but cover their ears.

Because of how long it was, the ear drum was about to burst.

‘Yuan’!

At that moment, Lin Xiu had no idea but to release his ‘Yuan’!

As the dark red hue was released, the huge translucent fist that was formed by the source energy landed on top of his ‘Yuan’!

Koong Loong !!

There was a loud explosion that happened at the same time.

However, Lin Xiu had already released his ‘Yuan’ and it was sufficient to block the attack.

“Hmm?!”

When Wan Qianshan saw the ‘Yuan’ that was in a dark red hue, he couldn’t help but frown.

This was the first time that he had seen such a peculiar looking ‘Yuan’.

Plus, it was strong enough to block its attack. The ‘Yuan’ didn’t seem to be affected at all.

“I guess it is my turn now?”

Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’ disappeared as he asked. Then, he moved his long spear in the air and soon there were countless flaming birds that were heading towards Wan Qianshan.

It was scorching hot. The entire area around them has been heated up because of the flaming birds.

“HMPH!”

Wan Qianshan sneered as he threw his fist around.

With his quick movement, there were two huge translucent fist figures that appeared in the air.

These fists that seemed like holographic figures immediately landed on the flaming birds that were surrounding him.

Boom boom boom – –

Soon, all of the flaming birds were destroyed!

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frowned as well when he saw what happened.

This was the first time that he saw a warrior that successfully destroyed his flaming birds.

“Hmph!”

This time, Lin Xiu was the one who sneered as he swung his spear around!

Lin Xiu’s spear was now covered in flame and the entire weapon turned into a dark red colour.

Wan Qianshan was prepared to destroying all the flaming birds that were to come.

But, he soon realised that these flaming birds weren’t coming towards him. Instead, all of the gathered in the air above Lin Xiu.

Koong Loong – –

There was a loud sound that travelled far and wide.

Plus, when he took a closer look, he soon realised that these flaming birds remained in the air and were fusing together.

‘Profound Intent – Awe of the Pheonix’!!!

Hundreds of the flaming birds came together and formed a huge phoenix.

The phoenix was made of flames. It spreads its wings and seemed to have covered the entire sky.

“He could use such a huge skill...”

The other warriors were shocked as well when they saw the phoenix.

“Dude! Are you crazy?!”

Wan Qianshan screamed when he saw the phoenix.

This skill definitely looks cool and powerful but this was a skill on a huge scale and it might attract the raging flame lion! Even with their abilities combined, they still wouldn’t be able to defeat it.

It might even cost all of their lives!

“Go!”

Lin Xiu completely ignored him as he continued swaying his long spear, sending the huge, flaming phoenix towards Wan Qianshan. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Koong Loong – –

The phoenix flapped its wings and flew towards him.

“DAMN IT!!!!!!”

Wan Qianshan shouted in rage. He quickly moved and had no other choice but to release his ‘Yuan’.

Liu Pan and the rest had their jaws on the ground as they were surprised as well.

This flaming bird was huge! It was a warrior skill on such a huge scale which meant that he needed a lot of energy to support it!

“Master! You can do this!!!”

An Qi and Qian Ling cheered for Lin Xiu.

“How many hidden skills does Brother Lin have...”

Liu Pan was still holding onto his double bladder axe while being shocked by what he saw.

“AHHHHHHH!!!”

The huge phoenix was already heading towards Wan Qianshan!

As he screamed and released his ‘Yuan’, it was already completely covered by the raging phoenix.

When the phoenix hit his ‘Yuan’, there was another huge explosion.

Then, the flaming phoenix did not stop. It started spinning in circles and formed a huge tornado!

That’s when the entire ground started shaking.

There were also cracks that were being formed on the stone walls around them.

Tiny rocks were also flying in all directions.

The rest of the warriors who were spectating the fight had to cover their face from being hit by the tiny rocks.

“Tsktsktsk…looks like there’s a huge fight over there.”

There were other warriors who seemed to have noticed something odd happening in front and started gathering around them.

Soon, the huge flaming tornado disappeared.

The ground had stopped shaking as well.

That’s when the others finally got to see Wan Qianshan’s current condition.

His ‘Yuan’ was still intact and it seemed to have blocked the terrifying warrior skills that had been released.

“You brat! Did you think that you could kill me with that?!”
