1304 A Leap in Progress

“I understand.”

Baili Haoling’s eyes were shining brightly with excitement and pretended to stay quiet.

Lin Xiu knew what Baili Haoling was up to. She would have liked it better if the other party came after her so that she would be allowed to fight.

It was indeed a headache for Lin Xiu.

!!

Soon, they returned to the hotel.

When they took a close look, the entire lobby that was extremely wide was now filled with warriors.

All of them were carrying their own bags with a sorrowful look on their faces.

Some of them still had injuries on them and from the look of it, they must be those who were leaving after being defeated on stage.

There were some who died on stage.

Lei Chong looked around and he was shocked by how many of them were here.

There were so many of them here and most of them seem to be quite powerful.

Did all of these warriors lose their battles?

Lei Chong then turned to Lin Xiu and his eyes were filled with admiration.

“I need to rest first. The finals will be in three days.”

Lin Xiu informed both Baili Haoling and Lei Chong.

“Sure.”

Both of them nodded their heads but instead of going back to their rooms, they headed straight for the training ground.

Lei Chong finally got the chance to witness how powerful these warriors were and it was as if they had been pumped.

As for Baili Haoling, she was working hard to cultivate as well.

Lin Xiu was progressing quickly. If she didn’t work hard with her cultivations, she would be left behind.

As soon as Lin Xiu got back into his room, Rollie and Little Bai rushed over to him and jumped onto his shoulder, rubbing against his neck affectionately.

“Alright, alright. I need to take a break.”

Lin Xiu smiled and placed them on the table.

He took a shower and washed his combat suit before lying on the bed.

This was comforting.

He was exhausted from the fight with Huangfu Gu and Lin Xiu was overwhelmed with fatigue.

Soon, Lin Xiu fell into a deep sleep.

Time passed by quickly.

When Lin Xiu opened his eyes once again, he could feel the ray of sunshine that was shining into his room.

“Hmmmmmm…”

Lin Xiu slowly opened his eyes and stretched his back.

The curtains in the room were thin and the bright sunlight outside could easily penetrate into the room.

“Is this already the next day?”

Lin Xiu sat up on his bed and read the clock opposite him.

It was indeed the next day.

He didn’t think that he would be asleep for so long.

However, Lin Xiu could feel that his energy had already completely replenished.

“Let’s see how much EXP I’ve gained.”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself and entered into the system interface.

After looking at it closely, Lin Xiu could see from his stats that his EXP has improved more than 50%!

“Damn!”

Seeing what he got, Lin Xiu jumped on his bed and he was delighted!

He didn’t think that he would gain so much!

“Wow… I wouldn’t have thought that killing Huangfu Gu would bring so much EXP…”

Lin Xiu continued muttering to himself.

Lin Xiu was in disbelief.

This was because at his current level, it would be extremely difficult for him to progress to another level.

“That’s not right. Although Huangfu Gu was a powerful man, it wouldn’t bring me so much EXP.”

“Was it because I engulfed the energy that he got from ‘God’s descend’? I don’t think so…”

Wait!

As Lin Xiu was trying to figure out what had happened, Lin Xiu suddenly thought of something!

“Right! The little black dragon had absorbed his divine spirit.”

“Could it be because of that?”

Huangfu Gu’s divine spirit wasn’t ordinary.

...

They were red grade double cows.

The energy that they contained was tremendous.

Although he wasn’t sure about it, this was the only sensible explanation.

He shook his head and went straight to his door.

Little Bai and Rollie jumped onto Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

“Both of you want to head out as well?”

“Let’s go out then.”

Lin Xiu left the room and knocked on Baili Haoling’s room.

However, no one answered the door.

“Did she leave already?”

Lin Xiu thought about it before knocking on Lei Chong’s door.

...

It was the same.

Lin Xiu then used his watch and decided to call them.

However, none of them answered his calls.

“That’s weird. Where did they go?”

Lin Xiu was a little confused and sad. It was indeed boring to be the first one that was awake.

“Chirp chirp!!!”

Suddenly, Little Bai started jumping from his shoulder.

It was also chirping continuously.

“What’s wrong?”

Lin Xiu stared at Little Bai as he was feeling a little confused.

“Chirp Chirp!”

Little Bai seemed anxious as he flew into the air.

“Where are you taking me?”

Lin Xiu was a little curious.

Little Bai nodded his head as if he could understand Lin Xiu.

Then, he flew out of the window.

Lin Xiu quickly followed behind it and sat on its back.

Soon, they arrived at the highest ground.

There was a window that was left open and Lin Xiu climbed through it.

Little Bai quickly flew inside and it was headed towards the training ground.

What were they doing at the training ground?

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but felt curious.

Although he had no idea why Little Bai brought him here, Lin Xiu still walked into the training ground.

“Huuuu huuuu…”

At the same time, there was a large number of warriors that were surrounding another woman in the centre.

Lin Xiu took another step forward and saw that it was Baili Haoling!

Baili Haoling held onto both her daggers and there was blood everywhere.

Both her daggers were covered with blood as well.

No one knew if these blood belonged to Baili Haoling or the warriors around her.

“You guys….you’re asking for it…..”

There were countless warriors around Baili Haoling who were already covered in blood. It was obvious that they had been injured by Baili Haoling.

Standing opposite Baili Haoling was Lei Chong who was being held hostage with a sword against his neck.

“You just took a hundred million from me but I’m afraid that you would live another day to be able to use them.”

The man who was holding the word against Lei Chong’s neck was the man who sat behind them during the match.

“How dare you murder him?!”

Baili Haoling spoke calmly.

The men here may be powerful and authoritative but the rule here was that they can never commit murder. None of the warriors here would dare violate them.

“I don’t have to kill him. I’ll just chop off all four of his limbs.”

“Well, you would end up the same as well.”Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com
