Chapter 611: Entering the Sky City

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

At this moment, as soon as the staff member spoke, Lin Xiu and the others stood up from the state of cultivation.

The airship was still shaking slightly as if it was about to park.

Lin Xiu looked through the glass window in front of him, and he could see the scene in front of him.

This is Sky City!?

Lin Xiu looked at the towering building in front of him, the huge city gate, and couldn’t help being shocked.

This city gate seems to be like the gate of heaven in fairy tales, huge and majestic.

And behind the city gate, is the city with a very high technology style.

This city is endless and covers a very large area.

More importantly, this city was not on land, but suspended in the air!

Sky City! This is the economic center of Huaxia District!

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but take a deep breath when he saw Sky City.

I, finally set foot here.

Soon, as the airship docked in front of the city gate of the Sky City, some Sky City staff began to board the airship for inspection.

As the hatch at the front of the airship opened, Lin Xiu saw some men in special work uniforms approaching.

“These are the contestants from our Huaxia Division.”

President Wu Tian said to the staff who came to check.

“Only five?”

The staff members looked at Lin Xiu and the others, and were immediately surprised.

Originally, they thought there would be a lot of participating students, but now they were shocked when they saw that there were only five of them.

“Well, the other teams were eliminated by them.” President Wu Tian also spread his hands helplessly and said at this time.

He didn’t know if this was a good thing or a bad thing...

“Please show your entry cards.”

Those staff members came to Lin Xiu and the others at this time and spoke to them.

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu directly took out the entry card that was given to them by President Wu Tian at that time.

The staff checked it, and then took a machine to scan the information of Lin Xiu and others, and said, “En, that’s ok.”

Soon, after the staff checked, they got off the airship.

“Why is it so troublesome to enter the Sky City?”

Lin Xiu said helplessly, the series of inspections just now looked a bit complicated.

“Well, it’s Sky City after all, it’s like that”

President Wu Tian laughed.

“Ah, here again.” Baili Haoling stretched and said.

“Have you been here before?”

Lin Xiu said curiously.

“Of course, I’ve been here too many times.”

“It’s also possible that when I came here, you were still playing in the mud.”

“Tsk.” Hearing Baili Haoling’s words, Ouyang Hang pouted in disdain.

Baili Haoling looked much younger than him, how is this possible?

And President Wu Tian seemed to have thought of something at this time, and looked at Baili Haoling.

Seemingly sensing President Wu Tian’s gaze, Baili Haoling quickly said, “Let’s go, hurry up!”

“En, let’s go out.”

Lin Xiu also held his Dark Edge spear at this time, then looked at the crowd and said.

As soon as he got off the airship, Lin Xiu felt a strong wind blow.

When he looked around, he could clearly see that there were a lot of aircrafts parked around.

This was a huge parking lot in front of the city gate of Sky City.

Generally speaking, these airships cannot fly directly into Sky City unless a special pass is obtained.

The people who come here would park their aircrafts here.

And now Lin Xiu felt like he was standing in a cloud.

The surrounding air seemed to be much better than when he was in Nanyang City, so Lin Xiu couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

Very comfortable.

Looking not far away, he could clearly see the gate of Sky City.

Now, instead of looking through the glass, he could really see the gate of sky city, which was majestic and stunning.

Lin Xiu subconsciously took out his mobile phone at this time, and after thinking about it, he sent a message to Luo Yue.

“I’m coming.”

After sending it, Lin Xiu looked at the screen of the phone and put the phone back in his pocket.

“Hey, who did you secretly send messages to?”

At this time, Baili Haoling’s fire of gossip was raging, and she leaned over and said to Lin Xiu.

“I did not.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

He knew that his master was super gossipy, so of course he couldn’t say anything to her.

“Tsk, how petty.”

Baili Haolin suddenly felt uninterested, and then walked towards the front.

“Come on, let’s enter Sky City.”

“President Wu Tian, ??aren’t you coming?”

When Lin Xiu was about to leave, he found Wu Tian standing there, as if waiting for something. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Well, I want to wait for someone here, I won’t go first.”

President Wu Tian touched his beard, then smiled and said.

“By the way, you can go to the General Hotel of the Warrior Union in Sky City, show the card I gave you, and you can check in there. Today’s contestants are all staying there.”

“There is also the competition process for tomorrow, and someone will tell you when that time comes.”

President Wu Tian seemed to have thought of something at this time, and then said to Lin Xiu.

“Okay thank you.”

Lin Xiu nodded.

“Lin Xiu, what are you doing, hurry up and get going!”

At this time, Baili Haoling, who had already walked to the front, waved and said.

“Coming.”

Lin Xiu smiled helplessly, and then trotted up.

The city gate of this sky city looked like it was quite near, but when they actually walked, they realized that the distance was a little far. After walking for a while, they arrived at the city gate.

There were not too many restrictions to enter Sky City. The minimum requirement was to be a rank 6 warrior.

If you are not a rank 6 warrior, you must have a special pass.

The entry cards obtained by Lin Xiu and the others also served as passports, but because they were all warriors above rank 6, they entered the Sky City without any obstruction at this time.

As soon as he walked in, Lin Xiu found that the surrounding decoration was very delicate, even the ground was spotless, and the surrounding buildings were towering and full of super technology.

Compared with the city where he stayed before, this Sky City was like a city that has been developed for decades.

“The game doesn’t start until tomorrow, and we don’t have to go to the hotel now.”

Baili Haoling stood in front and said while looking at the surrounding scene.

“Do you need a skills card or not? In Sky City, there is the most powerful skill card shop in the whole Huaxia region.”
