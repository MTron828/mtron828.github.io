Chapter 475: North Gate Was Broken

“Teacher Luo, long time no see.” Lin Xiu walked to the field and saw Luo Li’s figure.

And at this moment, thousands of pairs of eyes of the teachers and students of Xing Yao Academy looked towards Lin Xiu.

But Lin Xiu didn’t look nervous at all.

“Why are you back?” Luo Li walked over at this time and said to Lin Xiu with a smile.

At this time, Luo Li clearly felt that Lin Xiu’s power was very strong. This change shocked him.

Because Lin Xiu was still an ordinary person who couldn’t even reach the ranks of entry-level warrior a few months ago.

“I heard that the iceberg in the E99 area has melted, so I came back to take a look.” Lin Xiu said with a smile.

“Damn, Lin Xiu, how did you become so awesome now!” Yang Tian walked over at this time, patted Lin Xiu on the shoulder, and said a little excitedly.

In the past, Lin Xiu was despised, but now Lin Xiu was like a god descended to the earth – he was too strong.

“Haha.” Lin Xiu smiled, patted Yang Tian on the shoulder, and did not say much.

“This is…” At this time, Luo Li looked over and saw Luo Yue.

At this time, many people’s eyes shifted from Lin Xiu to Luo Yue.

Although Luo Yue looked like she has facial paralysis, her appearance was indeed extremely beautiful and her face was as exquisite as a porcelain doll.

Some students were dumbfounded.

“My… my friend.” Lin Xiu thought for a while, then said aloud.

“You are Lin Xiu? Welcome back.” The Dean of the Xing Yao Academy walked over at this time and smiled at Lin Xiu.

“I was just passing by, anyway, I was expelled.” Lin Xiu looked at the dean of the Xing Yao Academy at this time and said with a smile.

The dean of Xing Yao Academy suddenly looked a little embarrassed with his hand hanging in the air.

“Hey you, what do you mean!” Director Tang stood up at this time, then pointed at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“You supported expelling me back then, right?” Lin Xiu said aloud, staring at him.

Looking at Lin Xiu’s eyes, Director Tang trembled.

Lin Xiu’s eyes were icy as if full of murderous aura.

If he hadn’t killed a lot of people before, he wouldn’t have this kind of look.

“Lin Xiu…” Luo Li suddenly said aloud when he saw that the atmosphere seemed a bit tense.

“Haha, it’s just a joke.” Lin Xiu’s murderous expression disappeared, then he smiled, shook hands with the dean of Xing Yao Academy and said, “Dean, hello.”

“Okay, okay.” The dean of Xing Yao Academy was taken aback for a moment, then returned to his senses and nodded and smiled.

Fortunately, Lin Xiu gave him a way out, otherwise, it would be too embarrassing.

“By the way, are you familiar with the Tang family? Tell them, I’m back.” Lin Xiu looked at Director Tang at this time and then said lightly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Director Tang broke out in cold sweat.

He just thought that Lin Xiu was the same Lin Xiu before, but now he realized that the strength of Lin Xiu now was unfathomable.

Even the dean could not be his opponent at all.

Boom——

At this moment, a loud noise rang again. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“What’s going on?!” Hearing the huge noise, the dean of the Xing Yao Academy frowned and then said to the man who was looking at the computer on the other side.

“Xing Yao’s north gate was breached. It is said that there are many evolved beasts and zombies that have rushed through with the flood.” The man said while sweating profusely.

Xing Yao Academy was at the south gate of Xing Yao City, while the north gate was on the other side.

“Dean, shall we continue to retreat now…” The pilot of an aircraft walked down at this time and then said to the Dean.

Although Lin Xiu and Luo Yue had dealt with all the zombies just now, it was obvious that the matter was not over yet and there were more zombies and evolved beasts coming with the flood.

“You guys better go to the Bai Di City in the south first. The terrain is high and the place is developed. Those floods can’t reach there and there won’t be zombies and evolved beasts.” Lin Xiu thought about it and said to everyone around him.

When those drivers heard Lin Xiu’s words, they nodded. Bai Di City was indeed a very large city nearby.

Moreover, the weapon configuration over there was also very sophisticated. If it is over there, it should be very safe.

“I will contact the military members of Bai Di City now.” The dean of Xing Yao Academy was silent for a moment and then said aloud.

Although his rank 4 strength was really nothing to Lin Xiu, after all, he was the head of a hospital and his connections were very broad.

Lin Xiu also took out his mobile phone and looked at it. There were many latest news on the Warrior Union.

Although intelligence has to be bought with money, to Lin Xiu, this small amount of money was nothing.

“The glaciers have almost completely melted and the frozen zombies and evolved beasts seem to have awakened…” Seeing this piece of news, Lin Xiu frowned.

What the hell is going on, this E99 area is an area that has been frozen for a hundred years. In the transparent ice, you can still see many zombies that were frozen back then and the figures of evolved beasts.

Before it melted, it was a tourist attraction.

And remembering what Dean Baili mentioned earlier, he found an intelligent robot there – Lin Xiu was even more puzzled.

What happened under the ocean floor of the Sacred Region Academy before had a connection with this incident?

“Lin Xiu?” Before Lin Xiu could think about it, Lin Xiu heard someone calling him.

He turned around and saw Yang Tian standing in front of him.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Xiu smiled when he saw Yang Tian.

This Yang Tian could be regarded as Lin Xiu’s only friend previously. Seeing him, Lin Xiu still felt very close and dear.

“She is your girlfriend, right?” Yang Tian smiled and whispered to Lin Xiu.

Girlfriend?

Lin Xiu subconsciously looked at Luo Yue at this time. Looking at Luo Yue’s cold eyes, Lin Xiu said seriously, “Ahem, I guess?”

“Lin Xiu, you have become a winner in life – not only have you become so much stronger, you also have such a beautiful girlfriend.” Yang Tian exclaimed.

Hearing Yang Tian’s words, Lin Xiu’s head was covered with black lines, “You speak quietly and be careful of being killed.”

“Killed?” Yang Tian was taken aback, then turned to look behind and saw that Luo Yue had appeared next to Lin Xiu.

Feeling the murderous aura on Luo Yue’s body, Yang Tian subconsciously swallowed his saliva and his body trembled.
