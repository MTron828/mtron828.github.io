Chapter 582: Kill the Mad Shark!

“This mortality rate is too high eh…” Everyone knew that if you couldn’t pass the level, or if your life was in danger, there was a chance to directly teleport away.

But it also meant that you failed the challenge.

But these people were all dead, so it meant that these people didn’t even have the chance to leave, they were killed directly.

And those who can break into the 90th floor were not ordinary people. This floor was really too terrifying.

“Damn it, I was swallowed by this darn thing.”

Lin Xiu already knew at this time that he was swallowed by this mutant mad shark.

He didn’t expect this damn thing would be so powerful.

But now Lin Xiu’s body was covered with a ‘Sphere’. Although he was in the stomach of this mutant mad shark, the solution in its stomach cannot melt Lin Xiu.

All those gastric juices were isolated by the ‘Sphere’.

“But if you swallowed me, isn’t that just giving me a chance…”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself at this time, then held his Dark Edge spear and waved it directly in its stomach.

Boom boom boom —

As Lin Xiu swung his Dark Edge spear, at this moment, a large number of flames burst out.

After the mutant mad shark devoured Lin Xiu, it was originally in the water quietly, but at this time it seemed to sense something and it swam frantically in the water. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Go to hell!”

At this moment, the Dark Edge spear held in Lin Xiu’s hand radiated a white light and the spear seemed to become even sharper and terrifying.

Lin Xiu continued to frantically attack the wall of flesh.

It seemed that he was going to pierce a hole in its body directly from the inside out!

Bang bang bang-

A dull sound continued to sound. The mutant mad shark was constantly swimming frantically and the intense pain in its body seemed to make the mutant mad shark become extremely crazy.

“‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!!!”

“‘Awe of the Phoenix’!!!”

Lin Xiu frantically used his skills and attacked in its stomach.

At this time, a large amount of blood had appeared in the stomach of this mutant mad shark.

Lin Xiu was about to use a huge force and poked a blood hole from the inside then rush out when he felt a powerful momentum coming down!

Boom–

The next moment, Lin Xiu’s body was directly vomited out of the stomach of this mutant mad shark!

Damn…

Lin Xiu’s body slammed into the wall heavily.

Although there was the protection from ‘Sphere’, Lin Xiu still felt severe pain all over his body because of the powerful impact.

Looking towards the front, the mutant mad shark with red eyes rushed towards him again at this time!

Seeing this scene, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly, then he attacked with the Dark Edge spear in his hand!

How dare you come here!

Lin Xiu roared inwardly and he used force on his legs and swam like a fish.

Very flexible.

There was blood oozing out of the mouth of this mutant mad shark and the surrounding water became dark red.

It opened its mouth wide and wanted to use its sharp teeth to bite Lin Xiu’s body in half!

But Lin Xiu’s body was also very flexible in the water. At this time, after dodging its attack, he turned and stabbed it!

The battle was still going on, but this mutant shark was obviously spitting out a lot of blood from its mouth because Lin Xiu had just pierced its stomach.

As the battle continued, the power of this mutant mad shark became weaker and weaker and finally, Lin Xiu stabbed it in the head with a spear, directly piercing its head!

It was still struggling frantically, but a bolt of terrifying lightning burst from Lin Xiu’s spear, passing through its head to its entire body!

Crackling-

The surrounding water was surging.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing the rank 8 mutant mad shark and gaining 13.5 billion experience!”

Hearing the voice in his head, Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief.

The body also relaxed and the whole person sank to the bottom of the water.

In the next moment, Lin Xiu’s body was covered with purple light and instantly disappeared into the water.

“Don’t have to watch anymore, he will surely die at the 90th floor.”

The man who explained about the ‘Ten Levels of Hell’ before, took out a fan and fanned himself, then shook his head and said.

“He… he broke through!”

At this moment, a trembling voice came over.

Hearing this voice, the expression on the man’s face immediately froze, then he walked straight ahead.

Looking at the words displayed on the screen, his eyes widened.

Lin Xiu was now on the 92nd floor!

“This guy, so strong?!” The man opened his mouth wide at this time and his face was full of disbelief.

“Damn it, he’s too good, I want to see if he can break through to the top floor!”

The surrounding warriors were all stirred up because they had been here in the Tower of Trials for so long and they had never seen anyone who could break through the 90th floor!

But Lin Xiu not only made it to the 90th floor, he also successfully passed the level directly, reaching the 91st floor!

Although they couldn’t see the scene of Lin Xiu’s battle now, just seeing the floor number of Lin Xiu’s current position were enough to get them all excited.

A group of warriors stared at the words ’91st floor’ next to Lin Xiu’s name.

They want to see if Lin Xiu could become a legend today!

“Damn!”

At the same time, Lin Xiu had just reached the 91st floor and couldn’t help but utter foul language.

Because he had just fought at the bottom of the water, his body was still cold and now he felt an unusually hot scorching sensation.

Taking a closer look of where he was, it seemed as if he was in the crater of a volcano.

The surroundings were all magma and he was on a rock. The surrounding magma was constantly flowing, which looked terrifying.

It was water just now, but now it’s fire?

But fortunately, Lin Xiu had forged his body with red lotus fire. The temperature here was scorching hot, but it was not too difficult to bear.

But now, how do we pass the level?

Lin Xiu looked around, but he couldn’t see anyone at all.

Not even the shadow of an evolved beast.

Boom—

At this moment, there was a sudden vibration around this place and a large amount of magma sputtered down from above!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and the ‘Sphere’ subconsciously unfolded.

Sizzle—

As the magma sputtered on Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, a strange sound sounded, as if something had melted.

“How could this be!?”
