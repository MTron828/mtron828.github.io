Chapter 959: The Essence of Fire!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The reason why Lin Xiu didn’t directly kill Anda was that now was not the time.

A family was quite powerful in this city.

After killing Anda, he would definitely have to face the people from the An family.

Although he was not afraid, he didn’t want Huangfu Lin and the other Sage warriors to track him so quickly.

Before he was promoted to the level of Sage warrior again, Lin Xiu still didn’t want to show his ability so quickly.

He wanted to deal with them in one kill.

“Okay, Wang Qiang, today, you should practice your spear art first.”

At this time, on the back of the mountain, Lin Xiu spoke to Wang Qiang, who was holding a spear.

“Yes, Master!” Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Before their family went bankrupt, Wang Qiang was reluctant to make progress.

But that bankruptcy seems to have hit him hard. The changes in the environment after the bankruptcy, as well as the betrayal of relatives, had changed him completely.

He was no longer a playboy, but became an honest young man with strong willpower.

At this time, he was wielding his spear frantically and was tirelessly practicing the spear art that Lin Xiu taught him.

......

Before he knew it, he quickly mastered the set of ‘Overlord Spear Art’ taught by Lin Xiu.

But he didn’t know it himself.

“This kid…”

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, there was surprise in his eyes.

Originally, accepting Wang Qiang as an apprentice was a random move, but he didn’t expect that Wang Qiang seemed so talented!

A natural warrior physique!

At this time, when he entered the mentoring system on the system interface, he could see that there were three people’s images below.

They were An Qi, Qian Lin and now Wang Qiang.

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for getting ten mastering points!”

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for getting 30 mastering points!”

“…”

At this time, he took a closer look. On the interface below the mentoring system, there were a lot of prompts for getting mastering points.

Every system prompt has a time.

It was from the time he left the Marqi planet to the present.

The strength of An Qi and Qian Lin has also broken through to the peak of King warrior.

Moreover, their growth seems to have brought Lin Xiu these so-called mastering points.

Just now, Wang Qiang gave him dozens of mastering points.

Looking closely, he now had a total of 10,000 mastering points!

Every time An Qi and Qian Lin practice the skills he taught, his mastering points would also increase!

Seems like they were indeed working very hard.

This made Lin Xiu a little relieved.

Entering the exchange center to take a look, he found that there were a lot of things inside.

The price of the previous Purple gold-level skill card has now been reduced to 1,000 mastering points.

Suddenly, Lin Xiu was a little speechless.

Because in the past, he remembered that it costs 10,000 points.

It was probably due to the improvement of his own strength, the corresponding requirements for this exchange were also reduced.

“‘Mysterious Gift Box’ 11,000 Mastering Points, ‘Holy skill Card’ 100,000 Mastering Points, ‘Essence of Fire’ 12,000 Mastering Points, ‘Epic Weapon’ 1 million Mastering Points… …”

Damn…

Looking at these crazy exchange points, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but cursed in his heart.

However, what is this ‘Essence of Fire’?

Lin Xiu felt a little puzzled, and then subconsciously clicked the ‘Essence of Fire’ icon.

‘Essence of Fire’: The material used to forge divine weapons, making the weapon extremely powerful with fire attributes.

A very brief introduction, nothing superfluous.

However, Lin Xiu felt that this material should be pretty amazing.

After all, it takes 12,000 mentor points to exchange for it.

And that ‘mysterious gift box’, Lin Xiu thought it was a pit, so there was no need to try it.

“Wang Qiang, let’s practice!!!”

In order to quickly earn the corresponding Mastering points, Lin Xiu could only train Wang Qiang continuously at this time.

A month passed quickly.

During this month, Lin Xiu guided Wang Qiang while cultivating.

And as Lin Xiu had expected, Anda did not come to take revenge this month.

He was probably afraid that the incident of the day will spread and lose face.

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for successfully redeeming the essence of fire!”

At this time, Lin Xiu took a deep breath and looked excitedly at the light that appeared in the air along with the sound of the system prompt.

The light dissipated, and a black square wooden box slowly flew into Lin Xiu’s palm.

In the past month, the crazy special training for Wang Qiang has given Lin Xiu enough Mastering points.

Today, he got the essence of fire!

“Hm?”

Holding this black wooden box, apart from the heavy weight, there was no other feeling.

‘Essence of Fire’ Logically speaking, shouldn’t it have a burning sensation?

Lin Xiu was a little puzzled.

In the next moment, he opened the wooden box directly.

As soon as the wooden box was opened, a bright red dazzling light flashed out from inside.

“Whoa!”

Along with this bright red light, a strong feeling of scalding also passed to Lin Xiu’s hand.

Lin Xiu close the box immediately.

“It’s so hot.”

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and said.

Even for Lin Xiu, who had resistance to hell fire, was actually scalded by this flame.

This is really amazing.

“However, that’s fine.”

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up.

After taking out the Dark Edge spear from the expansion space, Lin Xiu took a deep breath, and the source strength of his body burst out.

All wrapped in his hands.

Picking up the box, Lin Xiu continued to open it the next moment.

Inside this box is a hot red lava-like object.

Is this the essence of fire…

At this time, Lin Xiu concentrated all the source strength of his whole body in his hands to protect him, but he still felt a severe pain.

The air around the box distorted directly.

The grass on the ground withered away.

What a terrifying fire attribute energy!

It is more powerful than hellfire!

boom!

With a thought, the Dark Edge spear at this time, as if it had been summoned by some kind, was directly inserted into the ground.

It was upright.

Lin Xiu now has a bold idea.

He had seen many source marks on the ancient ruins here before, which gave Lin Xiu a deeper understanding of the source marks.

If he poured the essence of fire directly on the spear body in the shape of the source mark.

Will his Dark Edge spear possess the power of the source mark??

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but get excited.

Without further hesitation, Lin Xiu held the black box, and then swept out the essence of fire that was like molten lava!

Under the control of source strength, the essence of fire poured directly onto the body of the Dark Edge spear!

clap clap-

With a sound like pouring copper water, a large number of special patterns appeared on the body of the Dark Edge spear!
