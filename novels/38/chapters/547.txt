Chapter 548: Burial Grounds

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu ignored these people. At this time, he also looked at the surroundings, then he was also looking for something on the ground.

Judging from the bones on the ground, they should have been dead for a long time.

There was a huge battle here some time ago and many warriors and evolved beasts died.

“Eh?” Lin Xiu looked down at his feet and saw that under the bones at his feet, there was an odd crystal that was not brightly colored.

But the energy in this odd crystal was indeed very powerful.

If he guessed correctly, this odd crystal should be rank 6.

Although the level was not very high, it was still passable.

Lin Xiu directly picked up the odd crystal and put it in his pocket.

There were many warriors here and it seemed that they had found a lot of good things in this place at this time.

“There are really a lot of good things in Burial Grounds but we can’t stay for a long time, it is still dangerous here.” A middle-aged man not far from Lin Xiu’s position said to the man beside him.

The warriors around him also nodded after hearing his words.

Is that the name of this place?

However, he did collect a lot of good things. Lin Xiu has already found a rank 7 odd crystal and 5 rank 6 odd crystals on the ground.

There were some people’s exclamations from time to time around and it was obvious that some high-level odd crystals were found.

This place was very strange, so strange that it made Lin Xiu feel a little uneasy.

Logically speaking, this place was simply a treasure. If you simply searched around, you would be able to find some odd crystals.

But why were there still so many different crystals here, they should have been scavenged long ago...

“Ah!!!”

Just when Lin Xiu was puzzled, a loud wail came from the side.

Hearing this voice, Lin Xiu looked forward and saw a man’s hand being cut off and it was cut very neatly.

His severed hand was on the ground with an odd crystal in his hand.

At this time, there was a rustling sound and a mantis-like creature with a color similar to the surrounding environment appeared.

The size of this thing was about the size of a pair of human palms combined.

The forelimbs were not only like a sickle but also much sharper.

“The rank 6 color-changing mantis!?”

One of the warriors was well-informed, so he could easily know the name of this darn thing and he was shocked at this moment.

The characteristic of this evolved beast was that it could change its color with the surrounding environment and it was easy to conceal itself.

Moreover, its forelimbs were like a scythe and were very sharp. If warriors were not careful, it was very likely that their heads would be directly chopped off. It was a very terrifying evolved beast.

But the horror of this evolved beast was more than that...

Squeak-

Just as some people over there panicked, Lin Xiu heard a strange sound.

Looking ahead, a group of Scavenger Crows flew over and quickly pecked the man’s broken arm on the ground until it became bones.

“My hand!!!” Seeing that his hand was instantly pecked into bones, the man couldn’t help crying.

“Idiot!” Seeing that he was still there, some experienced warriors couldn’t help but curse.

Sure enough, in the next moment, those Scavenger Crows seemed to be going crazy and they rushed towards the man’s bleeding arm!

“AH!!!”

The man struggled frantically, but the Scavenger Crows seemed to become extraordinarily violent as they were stimulated by fresh blood and frantically pecked at his body.

In a short moment, the man’s body was pecked and his flesh was gone.

Soon, the man’s body had turned into bones.

Only then did these Scavenger Crows disperse.

This terrifying scene appeared in this short moment, causing many warriors who were not very strong to tremble.

“Humph! What a fool, he couldn’t even use ‘Sphere’.”

When a man saw this scene, he immediately gloated and sneered.

He looked at the odd crystal that the man had just found and his eyes lit up, he was about to walk forward.

This odd crystal was of the seventh rank and it was quite valuable.

But the rank 6 color-changing mantis was still there, he was still cautious now and directly unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

Lin Xiu squinted at this scene, showing a look of interest.

He wasn’t sure if the characteristics of this monster were really what his Analytic Eye had shown.

And this color-changing mantis was an extremely rare evolved beast. Because of its characteristics, it was also hunted by a large number of warriors.

“Go to hell!” At this moment, the man had reached the rank 6 mantis that seemed to be motionless on the ground.

Looking at the rank 6 mantis, he immediately roared, holding the sword in his hands and slashed towards the mantis!

Boom–

However, his attack looked very fast, but was dodged by the rank 6 color-changing mantis.

And this mantis fluttered its wings and flew over to his hand!

The man was startled, then retracted his hands within the protection range of his ‘Sphere’.

Originally thought that once he had a “Sphere”, this rank 6 mantis would not pose any threat to his life at all, but in the next moment, something that terrified him happened.

All he saw was the forelimb of the flying rank 6 mantis moving and it actually cut a hole in his ‘Sphere’!

Lin Xiu, who saw this scene, couldn’t help but be surprised, because just through the Analytic Eye, although this monster was a rank 6, its characteristics were very terrifying, because its forelimbs could cut through the warrior’s ‘Sphere’!

Lin Xiu had seen it in the history of evolved beasts before, but there was no picture of this monster in the books and Lin Xiu didn’t know what it looked like.

However, according to the data description, it was because of this characteristic that this thing was killed and was about to become extinct.

Some researchers have also studied its scythe-like forelimbs, hoping to use this to develop a weapon that can break the ‘Sphere’, but it seems that it has not been successfully developed.

At this time, the man looked horrified as the rank 6 mantis split his ‘Sphere’ and flew in. His face changed greatly and his eyes were full of disbelief.

However, he was still a good warrior after all and in the next moment, he still managed to dodge quickly with his body skill.

While dodging, holding the sword in both hands, he volleyed across the sky!
