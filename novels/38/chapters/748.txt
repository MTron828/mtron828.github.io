Chapter 749: Odd Crystals, I Want Them All

At this time, their eyes turned to Lin Xiu’s side and they had a look of surprise.

Because Lin Xiu stood still, simply waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand and he easily killed the one-horned black yaks that went to his side!

How could that be!?

The eyes of the two women showed incomparable shock.

Just now, they thought Lin Xiu was quite weak, but they didn’t expect that this time, it would be a total opposite.

“This kid...”

When the others heard their exclamations, they also looked over there.

It was found that Lin Xiu stood motionless, the Dark Edge spear in his hand seemed to be one with Lin Xiu.

With a wave of the spear, a one-horned black yak charging over had its entire body directly torn apart by the terrifying power emanating from the Dark Edge spear.

The one-horned black yak also seemed to sense the terrifying aura coming from Lin Xiu. At this time, the ones behind did not attack Lin Xiu again.

Almost all of them rushed towards Liu Pan and the others!

Although they were all rank 9, but under the simultaneous impact of so many evolved beasts, they gradually felt a little weak.

“Damn...how come there are so many…”

Xiao Qiang and Zhao Kai no longer had the fighting spirit they had at the beginning.

The evolved beasts from this beast tide were not weak and there were too many.

If it goes on like this, it is easy to get hurt.

“That kid over there, why isn’t he coming to help...”

Xiao Qiang clenched his teeth. He had just been bumped and felt a little pain in his body.

He seemed to have forgotten what he had just ridiculed Lin Xiu about.

Lin Xiu, on the other hand, watched those people fighting like a good show.

There were still many one-horned black yaks in the front and the blackness was overwhelming and now Lin Xiu couldn’t even directly break through there.

Liu Pan, this kind-hearted fat man, seemed to go crazy after he got into a fight.

His eyes were red and he was still fighting frantically with the double-sided axe in his hand.

He looked very scary.

He also had a lot of wounds on his body because he was hit by those one-horned black yaks.

But he didn’t seem to feel it at all.

“This fat man is in a strange state.”

Lin Xiu was also very curious when he saw this scene.

It was the first time he saw someone fighting with red eyes.

“Can... can you come and help?”

An Qi was getting more and more exhausted at this time. At this time, Qian Lin and Qian Lin looked at Lin Xiu, who was standing behind and watching the play.

There was no way now – if they continue fighting, their lives might be in danger.

“No.”

But Lin Xiu shook his head.

Both An Qi and Qian Lin were stunned.

The two beauties asked for help, but this guy refused directly?

“Ignore him...”

Zhao Kai was also a little angry when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

But as soon as he said his words, he was bumped by one of the one-horned black yaks.

A deep wound appeared on his arm instantly and blood spurted out in an instant.

“What...”

He couldn’t help but let out a painful howl.

“Odd crystals, I want them all.”

Lin Xiu stepped forward, looked at the one-horned black yaks that continued to charge towards them and said lightly.

“Sure!”

When An Qi and Qian Lin heard Lin Xiu’s words, they said aloud.

They were already feeling overwhelmed

After killing dozens of black yaks, they had consumed a lot of source strength.

While Xiao Qiang and Zhao Kai were a little resentful, they looked at Lin Xiu and nodded. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

They didn’t want to just die here.

“The two of you will help me dig out those odd crystals.”

Lin Xiu looked at Xiao Qiang and Zhao Kai and said with narrowed eyes.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s voice, the two were so angry that they almost vomited blood.

“No? Forget it then.”

As Lin Xiu spoke, he sat on the ground and watched the show.

“OK!”

The two gritted their teeth and shouted.

There was no other way and they didn’t expect that the number of these one-horned black yak would be so large.

What they didn’t even expect was that Lin Xiu had such strength and they regretted it just now.

“Let’s work well together.”

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched, then he carried his Dark Edge spear and charged straight ahead!

While rushing over, his body jumped up high!

The long spear in his hand suddenly glowed white due to the source strength being passed on.

boom boom boom —

Waving a long spear in the air, a large number of flaming birds immediately charged towards the front.

“This... what kind of skill is this!?”

Xiao Qiang and others were stunned when they saw this scene.

As Lin Xiu swung his Dark Edge spear, one after another huge flaming birds rushed out.

Roar–

A large number of one-horned black yak were shocked and howled in the next moment.

Taking a closer look, some of the one-horned black yaks were directly burned into coke.

In an instant, dozens of one-horned black yak were burned and annihilated by these flames.

“Go!”

The moment Lin Xiu’s body fell, he swung his spear forcefully again and all the flaming birds gathered together, then turned into a huge flaming phoenix.

The group of beasts that were still rushing in the distance ran away.

Boom—

At this moment, the entire ground shook, making a loud noise.

With the loud roar of the beast, all the evolved beasts over there were killed.

For the current Lin Xiu, evolved beasts around the eighth rank were simply a piece of cake.

Xiao Qiang and the others were dumbfounded when they saw this scene.

Unleashing such a powerful range of skill requires a lot of source strength!

And Lin Xiu didn’t seem to be affected, which was even more shocking.

However, they quickly reacted and after they killed the one-horned black yaks by their side, they heaved a sigh of relief.

Their bodies softened and they sat directly on the ground, panting.

At this time, Liu Pan’s eyes gradually recovered from their original blood-red state.

“Brother Lin, did you just unleash the skill just now? It is really too powerful!”

At this time, Liu Pan looked at the one-horned black yaks in the distance, all of which had been burned into a large piece of black charcoal and said excitedly.

“You are also quite strong.”

Lin Xiu smiled lightly and said, it was very easy to get along with this fat man.

“Right, your eyes...”

“Oh, I’m from the Berserk clan, that’s what happens when we’re fighting.”

Liu Pan touched his head, then said with a simple and honest smile.

Lin Xiu nodded slightly, then looked to the other side.

“Start digging.”
