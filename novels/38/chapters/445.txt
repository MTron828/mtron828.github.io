Chapter 446: Dean Baili’s Treasure

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

What’s that sound!?

Lin Xiu was taken aback for a moment, and then looked at the front and he could see the wall opening up!

Like an automatic door, it opened slowly.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened. There is actually a secret room here?

“Come here.” Dean Baili touched his beard, then smiled and said.

Lin Xiu nodded, and then walked over there, his eyes filled with curiosity.

Could it be this Dean Baili’s...little treasury?

Pa pa pa——

As Dean Baili walked in, there was a sound inside, and soon the space inside was lit up.

“Damn!”

After seeing the things around him clearly, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

There were many glass cabinets around, and those glass cabinets made of high-tech materials containing many skill cards – all of them were diamond skills!

And on the other glass cabinet, there are odd crystals, weapons, battle suits, etc., everything seemed to be the most advanced.

It was obvious that they weren’t ordinary.

“This is a treasure vault…” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but exclaim after seeing these things.

“According to the previous rules, each student in the class that gets 10 points would get 50,000 points and choose a gold skill card. The five people who participated in the battle would get an additional 50,000 points.” Dean Baili saw Lin Xiu’s shocked gaze and nodded.

After all, these things were his collection and he looked a little proud at this time.

“You have outstanding performance so I will reward you and let you choose one thing from my treasure vault.” Dean Baili continued smiling.

“No.” Lin Xiu said this and shook his head.

“Oh? Why not?” Dean Baili raised his brows and said with a smile.

“This reward should be more sincere. Five of us participated in the competition, shouldn’t all five of us be rewarded?” Lin Xiu looked at Dean Baili and said.

“You kid.” Dean Baili smiled helplessly, but still said firmly, “They don’t have, only you have.” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Why?” Lin Xiu frowned, and then subconsciously said aloud.

“You are an exception because you and I can be regarded as having a close connection.” Dean Baili said meaningfully at this time.

Just as Lin Xiu wanted to say something, Dean Baili waved his hand and said, “Hurry up, you can only choose one, time is running out.”

Lin Xiu wanted to ask him who asked him to take care of him, but Dean Baili appeared like he didn’t want to say anything so Lin Xiu was helpless.

“Okay.” Lin Xiu sighed helplessly, then glanced around.

Odd crystals were not the most needed right now, battle suits could protect against certain attacks, but he has ‘Mirror Image’ so he didn’t pay too much attention to these things.

Weapons were even more unnecessary.

Skill Card...

Lin Xiu looked at these skill cards slowly. Now that he was finally rank 6, the most urgent thing was that he needs good skills.

After all, he could only use the diamond body skill card right now and although the ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’ was comparable to a diamond skill, the real diamond skill was still more powerful.

Oh right, ‘Awe of the Phoenix’, this growth-type skill card has become a diamond skill card, but he had not fully learned it yet, so he still needed to practice more.

“I don’t have many spear skill cards.” Dean Baili seemed to know what Lin Xiu wanted to search for and said with a smile at this time.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded. Dean Baili was right. He mostly had sword and dagger skill cards.

There were only seven or eight spear-type skill cards and they didn’t seem very suitable for Lin Xiu.

“I want this, then.” After picking and choosing, Lin Xiu chose one of the spear-type diamond skill cards and said aloud.

“Oh?” Dean Baili saw the diamond skill card that Lin Xiu was holding, with a slightly surprised expression.

But at this time, he smiled and said, “But this is quite suitable for you.”

“Well, if there is nothing else, I will go back first.” Lin Xiu put the diamond skill card into his pocket and said.

“Wait, don’t you want to know about Yu Muchen?” Dean Baili smiled as he watched Lin Xiu about to leave.

Hearing Dean Baili’s words, Lin Xiu stopped immediately, then looked at Dean Baili and said, “What do you know?”

“I can tell you something about him.”

Dean Baili raised the corners of his mouth and said.

“What are the conditions?” Lin Xiu didn’t know why but seeing Dean Bail’s smile, he felt that the old fox wanted to scheme against himself and he couldn’t help asking with a hint of caution.

“I’ll give it to you for free.” Seeing Lin Xiu’s guarded look, Dean Baili laughed and said.

“You beat him this time, he probably won’t let it go.”

“He is from the Yu family in Sky City, and he has another identity – he is the apprentice of one of the five founders of our Sacred Region Academy.”

Saying this, Dean Baili gave Lin Xiu a meaningful look.

Hearing what Dean Baili said, Lin Xiu’s brows knitted.

Lin Xiu had already seen the strength of two of these old guys in the Sacred Region Academy so the remaining three were definitely extraordinary as well.

The background of this guy is quite strong ah...

“So what? Would I be afraid of him?” Lin Xiu snorted coldly.

“I just wanted to remind you – this time you defeated him in front of everyone, he would probably still come after you.” Dean Baili touched his beard and said.

“There is always a solution to a problem.” Lin Xiu said without the slightest look of fear on his face, but full of fighting spirit.

He turned around and opened the door, then left.

“Well, you have quite the fighting spirit.” Dean Baili looked at Lin Xiu who was leaving, stroked his beard, and said to himself.

At this time, he pressed a button next to him, and a screen with Lin Xiu’s information was projected instantly.

The information was very detailed, it even included the information of when Lin Xiu was born!

Dean Baili’s eyes narrowed.

“In just a few months, he went from an entry-level warrior to a rank 6 warrior. Interesting, how did he do it?”

“I want to see just how far he can grow.”
