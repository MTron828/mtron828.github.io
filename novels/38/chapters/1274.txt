1275 Have You Ever Seen A Talking Evolved Beast?

“The city lord is back?”

Mr. Pang was standing at the gate of the city at this time and he was relieved when he saw Lin Xiu back safe and sound. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

!!

Looking at Mr. Pang, he seemed to have thought of something, then subconsciously said, “Mr. Pang, do you know the guide?”

Mr. Pang was taken aback, then shook his head.

“I’ve only met the guide a few times, so we aren’t really considered acquaintances…”

“Well, it’s okay then.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly, then returned to the City Lord’s Mansion of Lingxian City.

October 1st will be the multi-city contest. At that time, city lords from various cities will go to the so-called City of God.

It is said that the strength of those people is even stronger.

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

Lin Xiu then began to cultivate.

Because there was no way to use the Dark Edge spear, Lin Xiu now focuses more on boxing.

When he was in Shachang City and Changqing City before, Lin Xiu obtained a lot of skill cards in the warehouses of these two cities.

There were also quite a few skill cards for boxing.

Eliminating the rubbish ones, Lin Xiu selected three new boxing skill cards, all of which were holy-level.

They are ‘Savage Tiger Fist’, ‘Sonic Star’ and ‘Fire Devours the Sky’.

These three skill cards were all fist techniques and they were quite powerful.

It was soon the end of September.

At this time, Lingxian City has been completely restored, as if it has become a brand new city.

These days, there have been quite a few visits from city lords from other cities.

It seems that they heard that Lin Xiu had wiped out the warriors in Changqing City and Shachang City before, so they all seemed very respectful.

Nothing else happened.

“Hu.”

This day, Lin Xiu recovered from his cultivation, opened his eyes, and let out a breath.

Kala Kala——

He moved his body a bit and his joints made some cracking sounds.

The body was covered in sweat and it felt extremely comfortable.

“It’s almost time.”

Lin Xiu opened his eyes and said to himself.

This time, the city he was going to was the largest city on the continent he was in, the city of God.

It is said that this is the city where the god king in this continent was located.

The city was so big that it seemed to be boundless.

And the city lords of tens of thousands of selected cities in this continent will go here to participate in the multi-city contest that only happens once in a few years.

“Level 72, it’s only level 72 now…”

Lin Xiu was a little depressed. After so long, he still couldn’t upgrade.

It seems that after reaching the God warrior Realm, it is indeed too difficult to upgrade.

Although the level has not improved, Lin Xiu felt that his strength has improved a lot.

With a thought, a large amount of dark energy surged in Lin Xiu’s right fist.

During the battle with Liu Cheng, the dark power brought by the black ball that he swallowed finally allowed him to extract the power inside and use it.

These dark forces were different from ordinary forces. They were not only weird but also extremely powerful.

Perhaps, it can become a force that surprises and wins.

“Lin Xiu!”

At this moment, a voice came from the side.

“What’s wrong?”

It was undoubtedly Baili Haoling. Lin Xiu looked over and asked.

Baili Haoling ran over in a hurry, then said excitedly, “Rollie… Rollie seems to be waking up!”

“For real?”

Hearing her words, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

Rollie has not moved for a long time in that weird ‘chrysalis’.

At this time, when Baili Haoling suddenly said that Rollie was about to wake up, Lin Xiu was also extremely surprised.

“En!”

Baili Haoling nodded seriously.

...

“Then let’s go and have a look.”

As Baili Haoling walked towards the large courtyard on the other side, Lin Xiu was able to clearly see the huge thing that looked like a silkworm ‘chrysalis’.

Rollie’s body was inside this ‘chrysalis’.

And at this moment, the whole ‘chrysalis’ seemed to be shaking slightly.

It was as if there was something about to pop out of it.

“Is it turning into a butterfly or is something about to pop out…”

Lin Xiu watched this scene, his eyes widened and spoke to himself.

“I am not sure as well.”

Baili Haoling was equally astonished.

Rollie has not moved for so long, but today it suddenly trembled, which was really beyond Lin Xiu’s expectations.

Kala Kala——

...

At the next moment, a crisp sound resounded.

This ‘chrysalis’ seems to have a lot of cracks.

It seems that it will be completely torn apart soon.

“this is…”

Lin Xiu stared at this scene with wide eyes.

boom–

Soon, with that dull sound, the ‘chrysalis’ exploded completely.

A dazzling white light flashed and a figure instantly appeared from the ‘chrysalis’.

Then it jumped onto Lin Xiu’s body.

Lin Xiu was startled when he saw this scene, but he subconsciously caught the flying thing.

Soon, Lin Xiu felt a touch of softness against his chest.

“Rollie?”

Taking a closer look, it’s indeed Rollie.

It’s almost the same as before, with a round body and dense white hair, like layers of goose feather snow.

The difference is that at this time, he could already see its pair of small hands and its small feet that were hidden under its body.

A pair of dark eyes and seemed to be full of joy.

“Lin…Lin Xiu…”

And at this moment, a childish sound came out from Rollie’s mouth.

“Damn!”

“Fuck, you can talk now!?”

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and his eyes were full of disbelief.

“Rollie talked!”

It’s not just Lin Xiu, Baili Haoling’s eyes widened at this time, equally astonished.

Because just now, she did indeed hear it talking.

“Lin… Lin Xiu!”

Rollie continued to speak.

But it doesn’t seem to be able to say anything else, just like a babbling baby, it can only repeat Lin Xiu’s name over and over again.

“Haoling, have you ever seen a talking evolved beast…”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were still wide open and his eyes were full of disbelief.

Since becoming a warrior, he has encountered countless evolved beasts, but this is the first time Lin Xiu discovered an evolved beast that can speak!!!

“I also…have never seen it before.”

The two stared wide-eyed, still in shock and unable to talk.
