Chapter 193: The Exile

Lin Xiu’s gaze changed at this moment and he thrust his Dark Edge spear to the back!

Dang——

The spear tip seemed to have collided with some metal object, making a clear sound.

“Tsk tsk, do you need to have such a bad temper?” At this moment, a person walked out of the thick fog and looked at Lin Xiu with a smile.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes at this time and took a closer look. This was a man wearing a white combat suit, he was about 25 to 26 years old.

He held a very large saber in one hand and blocked Lin Xiu’s attack.

There was a slight hint of surprise in his eyes – Lin Xiu seemed to be pretty good.

“Who are you?” Lin Xiu said lightly.

Looking at his appearance, it was clear that he wasn’t a good chap.

The Analytic Eye was activated and Lin Xiu found out that this guy turned out to be a rank 5 warrior.

“My name is Cheng Fan. By right, you should call me Senior.” The man looked at Lin Xiu and said with a smile.

“Sacred Region Academy?” Lin Xiu raised his brows.

“Senior year.” Cheng Fan nodded and said aloud.

At this time, he looked at Lin Xiu’s backpack and continued, “Lend me the Odd crystals in your backpack, I will return them to you when we return to the academy.”

“Are you mentally retarded or retarded?” Lin Xiu said with a sneer.

This person seemed to realize that there were a lot of rank 6 crystals in his backpack and he wanted them but he made it sound so dignified.

“Why are you talking so much nonsense with him? Just kill him.” At this moment, several people walked out from the thick fog and stared at Lin Xiu.

The weapons in these people’s hands were covered in blood and some of them were even dragging some corpses as they began to dig for something on top of those corpses.

“Oh? You guys are back so soon?” Cheng Fan seemed a little surprised.

“Damn it, just a few Odd crystals, this group of Sacred Region Academy students are really weak.” A bald and sturdy man directly crushed a man’s head.

Snapped——

A piece of emblem fell out of the clothes of the corpse and landed on the ground at the side.

Lin Xiu took a glance and found that the emblem belonged to someone from Class 9 of the South Campus.

And looking at the emblem’s design, there was no doubt that they were from the same batch.

At this time, the eyes of the people on the opposite side were all looking at Lin Xiu.

Their eyes were bloodthirsty and tyrannical, they were clearly those that kill without blinking.

“Take the Odd crystals out and I won’t kill you.” The man who just stomped the head of the corpse with his foot, looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

There were five people and all of them was a rank 5 warrior.

‘Damn, why are so many rank 5 warriors here?’

“Sure, I can give them to you but I would like to ask – did you guys create this thick fog?” There was no fear in Lin Xiu’s eyes at this time.

He looked at the people in front of him and asked directly.

The bald man revealed a sinister smile, “It seems like you haven’t been to the G17 Ruin yet? This is released by a certain evolved beast and it has nothing to do with us.”

Released by a certain evolved beast?

Lin Xiu was taken aback and was suddenly a little unsure.

“But in this dense fog, it is indeed an excellent environment for hunting down ‘preys’ and you are our prey.” The bald man said with a sneer.

“Looks like you are not being honest ah, give me my things…!: As the bald man spoke, he stretched out his sturdy arm and grabbed it from Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted suddenly, then he raised the spear in his hand and stabbed his hand!

Lin Xiu’s speed was very fast. Even though the bald man avoided his spear instinctively, Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear still pierced his palm!

“Ah!!!” The intense pain caused his expression to change.

“Idiot!” Lin Xiu snorted coldly, then pulled out the Dark Edge spear and continued to stab him in the body!

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!

The Dark Edge spear instantly turned into countless spear shadows and stabbed into his body!

Dang dang dang——

But at this moment, the other four warriors had already come to their senses and used their weapons to block!

Lin Xiu’s expression changed and strength burst forth from his legs as he flipped backward, quickly dodging their attacks.

“Damn!!! I’m going to blow your head!!!” The bald man looked vicious at this time.

The meat on his face was squished together and he seemed ferocious.

His other uninjured hand took out a bottle from the pocket of his combat suit at this time and poured some liquid on his wound. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Soon, the blood on his palm that was penetrated by Lin Xiu quickly healed.

“Kill him!!!” Cheng Fan’s expression also changed at this time and he took the lead to slash Lin Xiu with his saber!

Dang–

Lin Xiu held the spear body with both hands and resisted his blow.

The source strength erupting from Cheng Fan’s body was very strong and while the spear was blocking it, it let out a loud noise.

Lin Xiu felt a huge force from Cheng Fan and his hand was getting numb.

The thick layer of dust on the concrete floor under his feet seemed to be dancing in the wind.

“You’re from the Sacred Region Academy and you’re going to kill a freshman!?” Lin Xiu looked at him and shook him away with his hands.

“Hahaha, we are indeed from the Sacred Region Academy.” Cheng Fan laughed at this moment, then continued to attack Lin Xiu.

There were three rank 5 warriors attacking from both sides.

After all, they were all rank 5 warriors and their speed was astonishing, making Lin Xiu feel that the pressure was gradually increasing.

“But we are exiles.” Cheng Fan said in a cold voice and began slashing with the swords in both hands.

The terrifying sword aura directly split the surrounding ground into a deep gully.

“Exiles? A student who was expelled from the academy, huh?” Lin Xiu sneered while avoiding their attacks.

Lin Xiu had learned about the Sacred Region Academy on the official website some time ago and he had seen news about this.

In the Sacred Region Academy, if you do something that violates the principles of the Academy, you will be directly expelled from school!

And after dropping out, other academies would not accept you at all.

These people were probably a group of people who were expelled from the Sacred Region Academy.
