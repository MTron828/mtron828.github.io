Chapter 712 Kill!

“Patriarch, tonight I…”

Liu Yanran ignored Liu Cheng’s words, and then told Liu Shen what happened tonight.

“The Chen family dare to do this?”

Although Liu Yanran’s parents did not have a high status in the Liu family, even so, the expression in Liu Shen’s eyes changed slightly when he heard Liu Yanran’s words.

After all, if you wanted to kill Liu Yanran, it was a slap in the Liu family’s face.

“Humph! Who knows if what you said is true, maybe she was messing around with this kid and was discovered by Chen An.”

“After all, I know that Chen An has been pursuing you…”

Liu Cheng said with a sneer at this time, and looked at Lin Xiu with a provocative look in his eyes.

“You talk a lot.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, looked at Liu Cheng and said.

“Why, you’re a pariah, how dare you look at me like that?” Being stared at by Lin Xiu like this, Liu Cheng suddenly felt uncomfortable all over, but looking at Lin Xiu’s black pupils, a look of contempt appeared on his face. In his opinion, Lin Xiu must be just an ordinary warrior, a warrior with no background, to dare to speak to him this way is simply courting death.

“It seems that you forgot your lesson again.” Lin Xiu said lightly, he stood at the same spot and simply slapped him.

Pa–

On the opposite side, Liu Cheng felt that his cheek was slapped heavily, and his whole body flew out in an instant.

Pff

Liu Cheng, who fell on the ground, spat out a mouthful of blood, and some teeth fell out.

“Young master Liu!”

A few people from the Liu family who were at the side quickly ran over.

“Kill him! Kill him for me!”

Liu Cheng’s eyes widened, looking at the blood and teeth on the ground, and in the next moment, he shouted with a ghastly face. Just because the teeth fell out, his words at this time sounded a little weird.

“Young man, isn’t it too much?”

Liu Shen looked at this scene and said to Lin Xiu indifferently.

Just now, Lin Xiu seemed to be standing still, but Liu Shen could feel that Lin Xiu approached Liu Cheng at a very fast speed, slapped Liu Cheng, and then returned to his original spot.

It was just that the speed was too fast, and the others didn’t feel it, so they thought that Lin Xiu slapped Liu Cheng with a slap in the air. “Get close and I’ll kill you.”

Lin Xiu glanced at the rest of the people, and said lightly.

There was a faint killing intent in his eyes. “Uncle…”

Liu Yanran became anxious when she saw this scene. She didn’t want to see Lin Xiu and the Liu family fighting. “You guys step back.”

Liu Shen waved his hand at this time, and then said to those in the Liu family.

“Yes!”

The Liu family immediately stopped when they heard Liu Shen’s words.

“You are at the top of the Tianjiao list this time?” Liu Shen looked at Lin Xiu, seemed to have thought of something, and said aloud.

“Oh? Looks like you know me.”

Lin Xiu raised his brows, and then said.

Sure enough.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Liu Shen was also secretly shocked.

Although Liu Shen didn’t watch the game, he heard that the top spot this time was actually won by a man from Earth.

Moreover, that man killed Wu Changkong in public.

“Liu Cheng said something wrong, he should be punished.” Liu Shen said lightly at this time.

“Uncle, kill him!” At this time, Liu Cheng stood up with the help of the Liu family, and said with a grim face.

“Looks like you have a death wish.”

Lin Xiu was already very unhappy with Liu Cheng. At this time, he held the Dark Edge spear in both hands, and then charged directly.

Liu Shen’s complexion changed. Although he knew that Liu Cheng was usually a playboy, he was the patriarch and if Liu Cheng was killed before him, how shameful would it be. With a wave of his right hand, the sword of the Liu family behind him flew directly into his hand.

“Stop!”

The sword in his hand, at this moment, was about to resist the shot that Lin Xiu stabbed.

Dang– But at this moment, when his sword collided with the Dark Edge spear that Lin Xiu stabbed, he felt an extremely powerful force.

How can that be!

The look in Liu Shen’s eyes changed drastically, and the next moment, the sword in his hand flew straight out.

The tip of the spear appeared on his neck.

“Next time, it won’t be so simple.”

Lin Xiu looked at Liu Shen, and said lightly.

Liu Shen stood on the spot and felt a tingling sensation before the tip of the spear touched his neck.

The rest of the Liu family were also stunned. Lin Xiu actually defeated their powerful patriarch with one blow?

“Liu Cheng, right? He provokes me over and over again. This time, it’s time to settle the bill.”

Lin Xiu ignored Liu Shen at this time and walked directly to Liu Cheng.

“Uncle! Uncle!”

Liu Cheng looked at Lin Xiu who walked over with a Dark Edge spear, his body trembled.

Looking at the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand now, he already figured out that Lin Xiu was most likely the middle-aged man from before.

Because apart from him, he has ever seen anyone use this kind of weapon.

“Are you really going to fight against the Liu family?”

Liu Shen looked at Lin Xiu and said.

In this situation, even if he tried to stop it, he has no power whatsoever.

The strength that Lin Xiu showed just now was really terrifying, it was an instant kill. “I dare to kill everyone from the Wu family, not to mention the Liu family, haha.” Lin Xiu sneered, and in the next moment, looking at Liu Cheng in front of him, the spear stabbed straight out! “Do not!!!”

Liu Cheng roared, and at the next moment, the head of the Dark Edge spear directly penetrated his head. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Looking at this scene, the faces of the rest of the Liu family turned pale, and their bodies trembled. Liu Shen’s face also became extremely ugly.

“Boy, you killed the Wu and Lu family on the warrior stage today, are you not afraid of revenge?” Liu Shen said with an nasty face.

“You must know, the Wu family, not only Wu Changkong is a master warrior-level powerhouse.”

“Are you threatening me?” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes. “Then do you know that there are no master warrior in the Wu family anymore?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“What do you mean?”

After all, Liu Shen was not an ordinary person, so when he heard Lin Xiu’s words, he quickly reacted.

“It’s exactly what you’re thinking.”

Lin Xiu said with a sneer. “You…”

“It’s not just the Wu family, the strongest one in the Lu family should have gone to another world to report now.” Lin Xiu continued to speak.

Now Liu Shen was even more shocked. The strongest member of the Lu family was a peak rank 9 warrior and was known as the most promising person to become a master warrior.

He was also killed by Lin Xiu?

Liu Shen now looked at Lin Xiu with a complicated gaze.
