Chapter 843: Welcome Back

Lin Xiu did not hesitate at this time and continued to find out more:

‘Skill Enhancement’: Strengthen the skill you are about to use once to make it reach the holy level.

(Cooldown time: 24 hours)

Holy level!?

Seeing these words, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes could not help shrinking.

Is this a skill level that is even more powerful than a purple gold skill?

However, the cooling time was indeed a little longer.

“Lin Xiu?”

At this moment, a voice came.

Luo Yue’s hand waved in front of Lin Xiu.

“I was a little distracted just thinking about something.”

Lin Xiu came back to his senses and said with a smile.

“Look, the moon is so full tonight.”

Looking up at the sky, he saw that the stars were bright tonight and the moon was round.

It looks very nice.

“En.”

Luo Yue sat on Lin Xiu’s side, her eyes also looking at the night sky and the corners of her mouth curled up.

“Where are we going tomorrow?”

Luo Yue suddenly said.

“Wandering far and wide.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

For the next month, Lin Xiu traveled with Luo Yue while cultivating.

On this day, in Cang Qiong City.

Luo Yan was walking on the street. Although it was early in the morning, there was no one on the street, which made her very curious.

“Hehe, this chick, she looks pretty good.”

At this moment, several warriors walked in front and blocked Luo Yan.

Luo Yan frowned slightly when she saw these people, then walked directly to the other side.

She wanted to go passed them directly.

But at this time, one of the warriors walked over and continued to block Luo Yan.

“Tsk tsk, what’s the hurry, come play with Sun Shao.”

The warrior who claimed to be Sun Shao showed an obscene smile at this time, then reached out to touch Luo Yan.

It was the first time he had seen such a beautiful woman in Cang Qiong City.

Moreover, this woman’s body is charming, which attracts him even more.

Looking at the hand he stretched out, Luo Yan felt nauseated for a while. After dodging, she glared at him and said coldly, “Go away.”

“Yo, who do you think you are?”

Hearing Luo Yan’s words, Sun Shao’s eyes showed a grim look.

In Cang Qiong City, there were almost no people who dare to resist him now.

This woman dared to resist her, she didn’t know her life or death.

“You stay away from her!”

At the same time, Liu Pan had already walked over from the other side with an ax.

In the back were An Qi and Qian Lin.

“Yo? The two chicks from the Qian family and the An family are here too?

Sun Shao obviously knew An Qi and Qian Lin and said with a wicked smile.

“Don’t tell me you two also want to help me warm the bed?”

“Hahaha.”

Hearing Sun Shao’s words, the warriors behind Sun Shao couldn’t help laughing.

The faces of An Qi and Qian Lin became ugly at this time.

Because in the past six months, the Sun family has someone already in the peak of King warrior.

The seniors of the Qian family and the An family were suppressed by him.

Now the entire Cang Qiong City was no longer headed by three forces.

Now, the Sun family has become the most powerful force in Cang Qiong City.

“Sister Luo Yan, let’s go.”

Although An Qi was angry, she had nothing to do with Sun Shao now.

After all, the power of the Sun family is too great now.

“Go? Where are you going?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Sun Shao snorted coldly. At this moment, several warriors directly blocked them.

“Go away!”

Liu Pan is an impatient person. Looking at this scene at this time, he was instantly furious. Holding the battle ax in his hand, he was about to attack the warriors who were blocking the way!

“Courting death!”

The faces of these warriors changed slightly and they fought against Liu Pan.

Dangdang-

The sound of weapons colliding continued to sound and Fatty Liu pupils became red when he was fighting.

He has already reached the strength of a master warrior and in this combat state, his strength has also become stronger.

But the few warriors he faced were all warriors at the peak of Master warrior and Liu Pan’s strength was also limited.

Soon, he was hit by powerful skills and flew out.

He fell heavily to the ground.

“Liu Pan, are you alright?!”

Luo Yan and the others helped Liu Pan up at this time.

“I’m fine.”

Liu Pan wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth and said aloud.

“Take them all back.”

Sun Shao said coldly at this time.

“You dare!”

When An Qi and Qian Lin heard his words, the expressions in their eyes suddenly changed.

His words were too bold.

They are from the An family and the Qian family!

“Hehe, you guys should know, after today, there will be no An family or Qian family.”

“In Cang Qiong City, there is only our Sun family!”

Sun Shao said proudly at this time.

“what do you mean?”

An Qi’s face changed greatly and she said subconsciously.

At this moment, her phone rang.

“elder brother?”

It was An Ruo’s call.

“An Qi, where are you now? Hurry up! Hurry up and leave Cang Qiong City! The Sun family is crazy!”

“what happened!?”

“...”

In the next moment, the call seemed to hang up.

“What the hell did you do!?”

An Qi looked at Sun Shao and said loudly.

Taking a closer look, today’s Cang Qiong City was a little abnormal.

Now on the street, apart from them, there was nothing else.

When they came out just now, they didn’t notice this.

“Our Sun family just feels that in this Cangqiong city, there is no need for your family to exist.”

Sun Shao said lightly at this time.

“Aren’t you afraid that the government...”

“His Majesty the Emperor also thinks that one Sun family in Cangqiong City is sufficient.”

Sun Shao didn’t panic at all and said calmly.

“Take them away for me!”

An Qi and Qian Lin’s expressions changed and just as they were about to make a move, Sun Shao’s stern shout came over.

From the other side, there were quite a few warriors from the Sun family.

They were going to capture An Qi and others.

“En? Why is Cangqiong City different from usual today?”

At this moment, a voice came from the other side.

Luo Yan and the others, who were about to make a life and death struggle, heard this voice and the expressions on their faces suddenly changed.

They glanced sharply ahead and saw a familiar figure.

A young man and beside him, there was a woman who looked cold, but was extremely perfect.

Like a pair of immortals slowly walking over.

“Master!?”

“Lin Xiu, Luo Yue!?”

An Qi and Qian Lin spoke at the same time.

Their eyes were full of surprise.

And Liu Pan was stunned for a moment, then laughed loudly, “Brother Lin Xiu, welcome back!”
