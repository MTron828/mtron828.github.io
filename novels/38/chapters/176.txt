Chapter 177: North Campus Class 4

As Luo Yue’s sword came down, it sliced through its neck easily and chopped off its head due to Lin Xiu’s Awe of the Phoenix that had cooked its body well enough.

Bang-

Right At this time, another black figure rushed out from the other side and stood behind the Golden-back Wild Bull.

“Oh? You killed it so quickly?” A guy stood by the side with a strange look in his eyes as he looked at Luo Yue and the others.

“Sorry, we discovered this golden back wild bull, who would have thought that it would run over to you guys.” Another guy chuckled and said.

His words were obvious. He meant to say that the rank 5 golden back wild bull was theirs.

Lin Xiu walked over to Luo Yue’s side and squinted his eyes.

They were Sacred Region Academy students as well but he could see that they were from north campus class 4 from the engravings on their robes.

“You mean to say you want to snatch it?”

“Nonono, I’m saying that we are just retrieving our spoils of war, we fought against that golden back wild bull for a long while. Take a look at the wound at its leg, it was caused by my companion Sun Wuhai’s hammer.” The guy shook his head.

Behind him, Sun Wuhai moved the gigantic hammer in his hand and looked down at Lin Xiu and his group arrogantly.

But when he looked at Luo Yue, he could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva.

‘What a pretty girl.’

“I forgot to introduce myself, I am north campus class 4 Jiang Ya, we will be taking the odd crystal, as for the good materials on the golden back wild bull’s body that can be used to craft weapons. You guys can have it and exchange it for points.” Jiang Ya spoke as though he was generously giving them things.

“What’s the meaning of this! We were the ones to kill it!” Zhang Yin and the others walked over and retorted when they heard Jiang Ya’s words.

‘Shameless, truly shameless!’ Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

‘We just killed a rank 5 evolved beast through our own hard work and they want to reap the benefits!?’

“South campus class 10.” Jiang Ya looked at their uniforms and shook his head. He looked at Zhang Yin and replied, “We are rank 4 warriors.”

“Are you trying to threaten us?” Jiang Li and Li Ping held their weapons tightly when they heard his threat.

“If that’s how you interpret it, you can assume so.” Jiang Ya waved his hands as-a-matter-of-factly.

The other guys started preparing to retrieve the rank 5 odd crystal from the bull’s head.

“I think it won’t matter if a few Sacred Region Academy students die in G17, right?” Lin Xiu suddenly spoke up indifferently.

Upon hearing his words, Jiang Ya and his group had a change in expressions.

“What do you mean by that.” Jiang Ya’s face turned dark.

“How you interpret it is how it is interpreted.” Lin Xiu glanced at him.

Right at this time, the silent Luo Yue suddenly took action.

She moved extremely fast and used her sword to stab at the two guys that were using their weapons to dig out the odd crystal!

They turned right at the moment to see a cold light in front of them. Their expressions changed as they stopped digging the odd crystal and immediately jumped out of the way!

“You’re crazy!” The man wielding the saber retorted in a panic.

It was just a bit and his neck would have been sliced off.

He never thought that the extremely beautiful girl would actually be so ferocious.

“I will say this once, the odd crystal is ours.” Luo Yue stood her ground and looked down on them as though they were ants.

“Seems like you want to snatch it from us.” Jiang Ya sneered, he was not afraid of fighting.

Although Luo Yue and Lin Xiu were rank 4, the other three were rank 3 warriors, while his group of five were all rank 4 warriors. There was nothing to compare.

They were bound to win in the fight!

“You guys are weak, inverting right from wrong seems rather fun to you.” Lin Xiu shook his head and sighed.

“Seeking death!” Jiang Ya was infuriated when he saw Lin Xiu’s mocking expression and shot forward with his sword!

He moved quickly and appeared before Lin Xiu. His sharp sword was aimed at Lin Xiu’s head!

Clang-

The spear in Lin Xiu’s hand moved as the spear immediately blocked the sword strike!

And as for Luo Yue, she rushed straight for the other warriors!

She was fighting against 2!

Zhang Yin and the others faced off against the remaining 2 warriors.

After all, they were at the peak of rank 3 and were able to balance out against the two rank 4 warriors.

“Who would have thought that you’re rather capable.” Jiang Ya spoke up while fighting Lin Xiu.

He thought that Lin Xiu was an ordinary rank 4 warrior and only realized that Lin Xiu was extremely strong while fighting him.

His palms were faintly numb from the collisions.

“Shadow!” Jiang Ya felt pressure and immediately used his gold skill without hesitation!

He transformed into a black figure and his incoming sword seemed to have disappeared.

‘Where did he go!?’

‘Go and die!’

In the next second, the sword appeared at the back of Lin Xiu’s neck and was about to cut his head off!

Clank-

Jiang Ya had a sinister smile when he realized that his sword had been blocked and the collision produced a loud metallic sound!

‘How is that possible…?!’

Jiang Ya was stunned as he was unable to comprehend how Lin Xiu was able to have such terrifying reaction speed!

He turned his body and performed a roll backward.

Lin Xiu snorted and turned to give chase.

Although Lin Xiu was unable to see where Jiang Ya had disappeared to, his intense training with the gravity room’s laser beams had improved his reaction ability.

Although Jiang Ya had disappeared, Lin Xiu was able to rely on the change in air movements around him to find out he was coming from behind.

Lin Xiu rushed forward at a rapid speed!

The expression in Jiang Ya’s eyes changed. He prepared his sword to block when he realized that Lin Xiu’s spear had turned into more than 10 stabs!

Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers!!!
