“This kid... When did he have such a strong power?”

An Ruo opened her eyes wide and said in disbelief.

“What kid, he’s my master!”

An Qi glared at her brother An Ruo and said.

“Can the master defeat him...”

At this time, Qian Lin said a little worriedly.

Although Huang Ying is the supreme ruler of Marqi, Marqi planet is a world that respects powerful warriors.

If Lin Xiu defeated Huang Ying, it would mean that Lin Xiu would be superior to the warriors of the entire Marqi planet.

“Luo Yue?”

Luo Yan looked at Luo Yue at this time, only to see that Luo Yue did not watch the battle on the screen, but sat alone in another chair.

She clenched her hands tightly, trembling slightly, as if she was a little nervous.

Seeing this scene, Luo Yan was stunned for a moment, then patted Luo Yue on the shoulder and said with a smile, “Don’t worry, that kid is very powerful, he will definitely win.”

Isn’t that right? Lin Xiu survived so many times and each time he became stronger.

If Lin Xiu wasn’t really human, Luo Yan would have regarded him as a monster.

“what!!!”

At the same time, in Fengyun City, a huge roar came over.

The terrifying flame tornado was completely dissipated in the next moment.

buzzing-

When Lin Xiu heard this huge roar, his head was shaken and hurt.

The windows of the entire Fengyun City seemed to be cracked by the shock.

The glass of the building near this side was all shattered.

“Damn boy!!!”

The figure of Huang Ying is beginning to appear now.

Taking a closer look, the battle suit on his body was completely annihilated by the flames, leaving only a pair of tattered trousers.

The whole person looked very haggard.

At this moment, a golden light lit up on his forehead.

On the forehead, there are also very complicated tattoos.

It is far more powerful than the general source mark.

“Open!”

Huang Ying roared again, the sky seemed to be torn apart instantly.

A huge golden pupil appeared from the sky.

As if looking at the Marqi planet from within the universe.

Lin Xiu also raised his eyes at this time and was facing the golden pupils.

Looking at the golden pupils, at this moment, Lin Xiu actually felt that his body couldn’t move!

A strange force seemed to bind Lin Xiu’s body.

Damn it!

Lin Xiu tried hard to struggle, but to no avail.

And this golden pupil has a lot of energy, all of which are gathered in the center of its pupil.

swoosh—

In the next moment, that terrifying energy, formed an energy ray and would directly impact Lin Xiu below!

And at this moment, Lin Xiu’s body was watched by these eyes and there was no way to dodge.

‘Mirror Image’ can’t be used at this time and ‘Golden Body Immortality’ can only resist for a second.

‘Exotic Summoning’!

Lin Xiu didn’t have a thought at this time and the surrounding space seemed to be torn apart in an instant.

A huge alien beast suddenly ran out from the broken space.

The body of this alien beast is really too big. It spread out a pair of black wings and flew in the air, as if covering the entire sky.

Roar–

Looking at the energy rays bursting out of the golden pupils, the alien beast let out a huge roar.

There is a large amount of blue energy in its big mouth.

He also spit out a huge blue energy ray which hit that golden energy ray!

Boom—

The two energies collided together and suddenly a huge sound came out.

Now Lin Xiu is at the level of Respected warrior and the alien beast he summoned is an evolved beast at the holy level!

The terrifying blue energy was at first on par to the golden energy in the air, but in the next moment, the golden energy, with overwhelming force, directly impacted the blue energy spat out by the alien beast!

swoosh—

The terrifying golden energy instantly annihilated the body of the alien beast, turning it into a huge skeleton.

And Lin Xiu, who was at the back, was also directly hit by this energy!

‘Reset’ ‘Golden Body Immortality’!

Lin Xiu directly activated these two skills to resist this terrifying energy.

“Die!!!”

When Huang Ying saw this scene, he immediately shouted.

The energy ray had passed through Lin Xiu’s body and hit the ground directly.

In an instant, a huge, bottomless pit appeared.

It seems to run through the entire Marqi planet.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s figure finally disappearing into the air, Huang Ying heaved a sigh of relief, his eyes filled with pride.

He, no matter in the past, now, or in the future, will be the ruler of the Marqi planet, the only strongest person on the Marqi planet!

At this time, the huge golden pupils in the sky began to slowly disappear.

The whole sky was gloomy, as if it were night.

“Almost died.”

But at this moment, a voice came from below.

Although the sound was not loud, it was clearly heard by Huang Ying.

His face was full of disbelief and when he looked down, he could clearly see Lin Xiu below.

At this time, Lin Xiu looked extremely battered, with a lot of blood on his body.

There are still open wounds on the arm and his bones can be seen.

Even so, in his hand, he only held a Dark Edge spear.

Lin Xiu raised his eyes and looked at the pitch-black sky. With a direct thought, thousands of stars appeared in the sky. All those bright white rays of light converged on Lin Xiu’s body.

It made Lin Xiu’s entire body full of white light.

Those wounds on the body are also slowly recovering at a speed visible to the naked eye.

With the movement of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the whole person also slowly flew into the air at this time.

The Dark Edge spear in his hand was also covered by white light at this time.

Lin Xiu’s whole body was in the air, glowing white and dazzling, as if the god of war had come to the world.

“Your power should be almost exhausted, right?”

Lin Xiu held the spear in his hand and pointed at Huang Ying, who was also suspended in the air.

Huang Ying’s face was gloomy. He didn’t expect that there was still no way to kill Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and the strength of his whole body gathered.

Clankly—

At this moment, the Dark Edge spear seemed to feel the incomparable power coming from Lin Xiu’s body and it began to tremble.

At the same time, the spears of the people on the entire Marqi planet seemed to feel the call of something and they all made a ‘clattering’ sound!
