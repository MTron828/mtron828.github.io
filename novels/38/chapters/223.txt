Chapter 224: Fight For First Place!

Lin Xiu swung his spear as he roared and unleashed many gigantic blazing birds!

The blazing birds were fiery red and caused the air around them to distort.

All the Sacred Region Academy students exclaimed in shock.

They were able to feel the intensity of the flames and the surroundings had suddenly turned extremely hot.

The blazing birds flew straight for Zhuo Qixing!

Zhuo Qixing’s eyes were filled with a hint of surprise, although he had watched Lin Xiu battle in videos before and had seen the same move.

But the temperature when facing the move head-on was truly too hot.

If struck, even his body would be burned.

Zhuo Qixing moved and quickly avoided the blazing birds. His footwork was extremely fast and made him move like a ghost.

The blazing birds chased after Zhuo Qixing but were unable to land on him.

‘What a strange body skill!’

It was far stronger than all that Lin Xiu had seen before.

Lin Xiu immediately sensed a pressure on him.

It would not be so easy to defeat Zhuo Qixing!

“Hmph, seems like Zhuo Qixing is stronger.” Tian Zixia sneered.

To her, Lin Xiu’s defeat was only a matter of time.

Ouyang Hang continued to watch without saying a word.

He looked down on Lin Xiu back in G17 ruin and suffered severely after that.

If not for Tian Zixia holding Luo Yue down, he would have died.

Upon thinking about this, his fists started to clench tightly.

After dodging all the blazing birds perfectly, he rushed towards Lin Xiu with his sword.

The sword emitted a white light aura and a buzzing sound!

“Divine Light stab!”

Just as his sword was closing in on Lin Xiu, both Zhuo Qixing and the sword seemed to transform into a beam of light that went straight for Lin Xiu’s chest!

The speed was extremely fast!

Lin Xiu was almost unable to capture his strange movements. His eyes turned cold as he clenched his jaws.

Adjudicate!!!

Thinking that his skill would instantly break Lin Xiu, Zhuo Qixing suddenly felt a large burst of power repelling him the instant his sword touched Lin Xiu.

Rumble-

The collision of the two powers immediately brought forth a loud explosion!

Zhuo Qixing’s eyes were in disbelief as he stood in place while Lin Xiu retreated a large distance and almost collided into the crowd.

Lin Xiu felt a heavy depression on his chest as his throat turned sweet and blood flowed out from his mouth.

“What skill did you just use?” Zhuo Qixing asked.

Ordinary rank 5 warriors were unable to handle his skill but Lin Xiu was able to resist it and Zhuo Qixing even suffered slightly.

Zhuo Qixing was also able to sense that the power that Lin Xiu had unleashed was almost similar to the skill he had used.

‘What is going on?’

“You speak too much.” Lin Xiu wiped the blood from the corners of his mouth and suddenly charged forward!

‘He dares make a move!?’

The spectators were shocked, Lin Xiu was clearly at a disadvantage but did not hold his ground against Zhuo Qixing’s attacks and instead launched his own. There was a large possibility that he would be instantly defeated by Zhuo Qixing!

Dean Baili stroked his beard upon seeing this and immediately brought up information on both Lin Xiu and Zhuo Qixing. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Zhuo Qixing was born into a prestigious family with large resources that groomed him into the current genius he was.

But Lin Xiu’s information was too simple, and that he was even a trash back in Xing Yao Academy.

Then how did he become a rank 5 warrior in a short span of less than a year!?

Dean Baili became curious about this.

He looked at Lin Xiu and did not feel that Lin Xiu had consumed any forbidden medicine.

That only left one possibility, that was Lin Xiu was relying on his own abilities to increase his strength!

“You dare attack me? I’ll send you to hell!” Zhuo Qixing felt provoked when Lin Xiu attacked him and his face became sinister.

His sword turned to light as he charged straight at Lin Xiu!

Bang bang bang-

Right when he swung his sword, Dark Edge Spear stabbed forth!

The entire source strength on the spear was extremely terrifying and the spear released a buzzing sound as though it was trembling.

The instant Lin Xiu swung the spear, it produced more than 10 afterimages!

Right in that instant, all the spearheads flashed with cold light and it felt as though stars had appeared.

A series of loud explosions occurred in the air!

Profound Intent – Torrential storm of rose flowers!!!!

“That kid knows Bai Liruo’s skill?” Dean Baili was slightly surprised.

And Lin Xiu was able to unleash the skill’s profound intent!

‘Wait a minute, is that Dark Edge in his hand?’

Upon thinking about it, Dean Baili became even more surprised.

‘What is that?!’

Zhuo Qixing was shocked when he saw Lin Xiu retaliate.

Clank clank clank-

He used his sword frantically to block but Lin Xiu had unleashed too many stabs and every strike was filled with immense might!

Bang-

Following a loud sound, Zhuo Qixing was flung out.

The power in the strikes caused him to drop the sword after blocking Lin Xiu’s attacks.

Whew-

Everyone exclaimed out loud when they saw the change.

How was that possible!

South campus class 10, actually…forced the strongest freshman, Zhuo Qixing, to this state!?

“Very good, Lin Xiu must win!” At this, Zhang Yin and the others clenched their fists in excitement.

Luo Yue felt that something was amiss and frowned

“Hahaha, I’m bleeding, I’m actually bleeding.” Zhuo Qixing spat out blood and laughed fanatically.
