Chapter 827: Ghost Ship

“Yo, it seems that there is a newcomer here?”

As Lin Xiu walked in, a voice with an unfriendly tone suddenly came over.

In this compound, there were already dozens of men and women here.

Seeing the appearance of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, the eyes of these people all looked towards them.

“Little brother, little sister, this is not somewhere you belong.”

A woman dressed a bit coquettishly said with a smile.

“En? It seems that the employer hasn’t appeared yet.”

Lin Xiu ignored their words, glanced around and raised his brows.

It was as if Luo Yue didn’t see these people at all, she just stood there quietly.

Many people frowned when they saw this scene.

This little couple thinks that they could have fun at this place?

“Hehe, beauty, you’re so good-looking, it’s not good to be too cold, let’s have a laugh.”

At this time, a short, wretched-looking man approached Luo Yue.

He immediately reached out and touched Luo Yue.

boom–

But just as he was nearing, the whole person flew out instantly.

He slammed into the rock wall behind.

A large number of cracks appeared in the entire hard stone wall in an instant.

The man’s eyes widened and he vomited out a mouthful of blood.

The faces of those warriors who had been disdainful of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue just now changed slightly.

“Did you guys see what happened just now?”

A man lowered his voice and said to his companion.

“No.”

Hearing the man’s words, these people also shook their heads.

At this time, they looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue and they became more cautious.

They no longer treated them as ordinary warriors.

“Huh? It looks like everyone is here?”

At the same time, on the other side of this huge courtyard, dozens of figures appeared.

An old man, riding on an electric wheelchair, came over slowly.

Behind him, there are dozens of men in special uniforms.

The strength of these men does not seem weak at all.

It seems to be the old man’s bodyguard.

Looking at the old man, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed.

This person is the employer of this mission.

“Introduce yourself, I’m the person who posted this mission, just call me Old Man An.”

The old man grinned and the thick white beard around his lips trembled.

“You guys should know the mission by now, right?”

“It’s to look for the ghost ship in the hinterland of the Black River, right?”

A man said with a smile at this time.

Ghost Ship is a short form.

It was more than a hundred years ago that the largest cruise ship in the world was built on the Marqi planet.

It is said that once, a peak King warrior packed all his treasures on a cruise ship, then wanted to transport them across half the world. It was filled with all kinds of treasures, odd crystals, magic weapons and so on.

But at that time, this cruise ship mysteriously disappeared.

A year later, the body of that King Warrior was recovered.

The corpse was so decomposed that the bones could be seen.

You must know that the King warrior was at the peak level and wanted to attack a Respected warrior but he actually died.

And what’s even more unbelievable was that this cruise ship also disappeared.

With the current level of technology, it is possible to observe the condition of the entire Black River, so it was very strange that the cruise ship disappeared.

But in recent years, someone has photographed the cruise ship that mysteriously disappeared.

At first they thought it was fake, but later found out that it was indeed a real photo!

But this man died mysteriously three days after the ship was photographed.

In the same way, everyone who found this ship would die mysteriously after three days.

But the observers on the Black River had never been able to take pictures.

So this was called one of the top ten mysterious events on the Marqi planet.

“I have someone photographed it appearing in the hinterland of the Black River, so this time, I have gathered you all here and want all of you to help me find this ghost ship.”

Pa pa-

Just then, Old Man An clapped his hands and the men behind him took out boxes one by one.

Inside those transparent boxes, you could clearly see a bright crystal suspended in it.

Life Crystal.

What a powerful energy wave.

Although there was a special glass box, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the powerful life energy transmitted by the life crystal in the box.

This is one of the four most precious items in the world. Unexpectedly, this old man has as many as eighteen!

If you sold it, you’re said to be rich enough to rival the country.

“There are only... eighteen in total.”

Some men looked at the life crystals and said suddenly.

Because there were only about 18 life crystals, but there are a lot of people here.

This spar is probably not enough.

So, this time, I only need eighteen people.

The corners of the old man’s eyes narrowed and he said lightly.

Hearing these people’s words, the expressions of the surrounding warriors couldn’t help changing.

So, An Lao, how did you choose these eighteen warriors? I’m a treasure hunter and I think I’m quite suitable.

A man stood up at this time, then smiled confidently and said.

“Tsk tsk, just the strength of a peak master warrior, are you going to send yourself to hell?”

A middle-aged man came over, glanced at him and said coldly.

“you...”

Hearing the middle-aged man’s words, his expression couldn’t help changing.

But he could instinctively feel that the strength of this middle-aged man was at the level of a King warrior.

Not easy to deal with.

“Okay, let’s listen to the arrangement of the employer.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

A man who looked more mature, looked at Old Man An and said.

“Well, I’ll think about it...”

Old Man An touched his beard, then showed a strange smile and said, “You guys... fight.”

“The last eighteen people standing here are the ones I chose.”

As soon as Old Man An’s words fell, in the next moment, some people directly attacked the opponents they thought were weaker!

And Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were undoubtedly the first choices of most people.

“I’ll do it.”

Lin Xiu looked at those who attacked him and Luo Yue and the corners of his mouth curled up.

“I’m sorry, you guys are not qualified enough!”

Several warrior teams that seem to be a group have already surrounded them!

Lin Xiu stood motionless at this moment, not even taking down the spear he carried behind his back.
