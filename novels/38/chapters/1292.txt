1293 Noble God Riyan

At this moment, Lin Xiu raised his eyes to a special stand above.

This stand was obviously prepared for some big shots.

The man sitting in the middle, Lin Xiu could clearly feel his strength, it was extremely powerful.

Just sitting there made Lin Xiu feel a strong sense of oppression.

!!

He seems to be even more powerful than all the God warriors just now that the Analytic eyes just couldn’t analyze!

“I didn’t expect that this time it was Noble God Riyan who came to check the game…”

Lin Xiu sat on the seats prepared for the contestants here and heard the words of the warriors around him.

These warriors are obviously referring to the warrior on the special rostrum.

Noble god?

Liu Mo and Sha Yan seemed to be also noble gods, but their strength was not particularly strong.

It seems that these so-called noble gods also have strengths and weaknesses.

Soon, the seats for the contestants were almost full.

Almost 10,000 city lords from various cities and god warriors were all gathered here.

These God warriors seem to want to show off their strength and they didn’t hold back at this time and directly released their powerful aura.

The faces of some weaker God warriors turned pale at this moment.

Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly and the strength of his body was also slightly released.

The ‘Disguise’ skill was no longer used.

After all, at this time, if he still used the ‘Disguise’ skill, it will attract the attention of others instead.

The powerful aura emanating from the surrounding warriors made Lin Xiu hold the White Moon spear even more tightly.

The body trembled slightly.

It’s not fear, but excitement.

“Ladies and gentlemen, everyone, good morning!”

At the same time, a warrior flew into the air directly above the center of the venue and suddenly said loudly.

The voice was directly transmitted to the surroundings at this moment.

Everyone looked up.

It was a middle-aged man, wearing formal attire and he could tell at a glance that he was a referee.

“I am the chief referee of the Multi-City contest, Yu Wei!”

“We have the city lord of City of god, Wan Gan, here to watch the game!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a warrior on the other side of the rostrum stood up.

After he stood up and waved his hand, there was applause all around.

“The director of the City of god fighting hall, Zhang Qinghua!”

“There’s also… Noble god Riyan!”

As soon as Yu Wei finished speaking, there was an uproar all around.

“The Noble god, Riyan, is here?!”

Some God warrior-level fighters didn’t seem to notice it just now, but now they all looked towards the rostrum.

Looking at the warrior sitting in the middle, the surrounding God warriors were shocked.

“Is this the Noble God Riyan… He really is powerful…”

A God warrior sitting next to Lin Xiu looked at Noble God Riyan and muttered to himself.

“Is Noble God Riyan very strong?”

Lin Xiu said suddenly.

“Nonsense!”

The warrior was stunned when he heard Lin Xiu’s words, then glared at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

“Noble God Riyan is known as the number one person below the god king and his strength is beyond the imagination of warriors of our level.”

“It is said that the Noble god Riyan can kill a high-level beast from another dimension with a single sword. When the fierce beasts from a different dimension attacked, only Noble God Riyan won…”

This warrior seems to worship Noble God Riyan very much today, so he stopped talking at this time.

“What is a different dimension…”

Lin Xiu was taken aback for a moment and just as he spoke, Yu Wei shouted loudly, “The competition will start soon, please enter the battle stage according to the number plate!”

The warrior didn’t seem to have heard Lin Xiu’s words at this time. He stood up excitedly and walked to the other side.

At this time, on the huge screen above, various battle sequences have been displayed.

“No. 99 Lingxian City vs. No. 181 Liuwang City…”

Lin Xiu looked at the scene above and immediately said to himself.

The space here was really too spacious and there were a lot of fighting platforms around.

Lin Xiu quickly found his battle platform, then jumped directly onto it.

“Lin Xiu is on the stage 1001!”

...

At this time, Baili Haoling, who was in the auditorium, said aloud while pressing the glasses she was wearing and said aloud.

Because there were too many battle stages and it was still in the audition stage, the audience was watching with special glasses.

Enter the match you want to watch into the glasses and one could clearly see Lin Xiu’s figure.

“No. 99, Lin Xiu, the lord of Lingxian City.”

The referee on the stage looked at the other side at this time.

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

“No. 181, Liu Tian, the city lord of Liuwang City”

The middle-aged man standing opposite Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

“Both sides are ready!” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“During the match, once the opponent admits defeat or dies, the match is over!”

The referee walked out of the arena as he spoke.

...

The moment he withdrew from the battle stage, a transparent barrier immediately unfolded on the edge of the entire stage.

Is it an energy barrier?

Lin Xiu frowned when he saw this scene.

It seems that this is to prevent the intensity of the battle from affecting other areas.

And the strength of this energy barrier is very high, only slightly worse than that of Lingxian City.

Thousands of battle platforms all use this kind of barrier to fight. This is indeed the capital of Tianling Kingdom, City of god.

“I seem to have heard of Lingxian City. Is it a subordinate city of Changqing City?”

At this moment, Liu Tian stared at Lin Xiu and was not in a hurry to attack Lin Xiu, but said calmly.

“En.”

The corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up.

This Liu Tian seems to have relaxed because Lin Xiu is the city lord of Lingxian City.

Because to him, Lingxian City is just a small city.

There is a limit to how strong a city lord of a small city could be.

And it’s very likely that he was just promoted to become god warrior.

“Little brother, you are not my opponent. I advise you to admit defeat as soon as possible!”

Liu Tian spoke out confidently at this time.

As soon as he finished speaking, he held the saber in his hand and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Whoosh—

His speed was also very fast and he disappeared in an instant, appearing in front of Lin Xiu.

The saber in his hand slashed at Lin Xiu’s head!

Dang–

At this moment, the White MOon spear in Lin Xiu’s hand moved and directly blocked his attack!

When the weapons of the two collided, a spark sputtered out.

And Liu Tian’s complexion also changed suddenly at this time.
