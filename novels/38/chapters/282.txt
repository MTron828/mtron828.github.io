Chapter 283: Gaining Experience!

As soon as Guo Ling called out, Qiu Li and the others held the flamethrower at the same time and stood near the crack.

“Lin Xiu, please shine the torch below.” Guo Ling said to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded and as Lin Xiu pressed the button on this miniature torchlight, a dazzling bright light shone out.

As Lin Xiu took the high-beam flashlight in his hand and shone below. On the cliffs on both sides of the bottomless crack, Lin Xiu saw many dark objects on them.

At this time, as Lin Xiu’s dazzling high beam shone through, the things on the cliff began moving..

Click, click, click——

There was a hair-raising sound that kept ringing.

“It’s starting.” Guo Ling stared at this side and said.

The expressions of the rest of the people turned serious as they clenched the flamethrower in their hands tightly.

Those strange noises were getting stronger and stronger, the high beam in Lin Xiu’s hand shone through and the things over there trembled.

Soon, some black things began to climb up!

When Lin Xiu saw this, the pupils in his eyes constricted slightly. At this time, Lin Xiu could clearly see that these weird things crawling on the cliffs of this bottomless crack were really spiders!

The spider’s head was very big about the size of an adult’s face.

What was even more frightening was that it had a pair of eyes that looked like small red light bulbs and its mouth was like black iron pincers. At this moment, when Lin Xiu’s torch shone on it, it gave off a cold light.

“Burn!”

Watching those things climb up, Guo Ling quickly called out.

As soon as she spoke, everyone pressed the switch at the same time. At this moment, a series of terrifying flames sprayed out from the opening of the flamethrower.

Boom boom——

Those Black Tooth Spiders who had just woken up and began climbing due to Lin Xiu’s torchlight got burned by the flames ejected from the flamethrowers.

The temperature of the flames was so high that Lin Xiu who was standing on the side felt the scorching heat.

Those Black Tooth Spiders were burnt into a ball of black.

“Where is the mutated Black Tooth Spider that we want to catch?” Lin Xiu asked Guo Ling as he shone the flashlight in the crack to attract the Black Tooth Spiders to rush up.

“Among these Black Tooth Spider – for every 100 or so Black Tooth Spiders, a mutated Black Tooth Spider may appear but it also may not appear. It depends on luck.” Guo Ling held the flamethrower and sprayed at those ordinary Black Tooth Spiders while answering Lin Xiu’s doubts. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

As Guo Ling and the others all took flamethrowers and were spraying toward the ground in front, those Black Tooth Spiders that had just climbed up were directly burned by the flames.

“There are some over there as well!” Chen Jin looked at the other side and saw Black Tooth Spiders emerging from the left and right!

These Black Tooth Spiders rushed up at an alarming speed and were charging towards Lin Xiu and the others wildly!

Their limbs were like strips of black steel and were moving up and down swiftly.

Seeing this, Lin Xiu directly gripped the Dark Edge spear tightly and waved it in the air. Suddenly, two fiery red flaming birds burst out of Lin Xiu’s spear and rushed towards those Black Tooth Spiders directly!

Bang——

As the two flaming birds charged over, a large number of Black Tooth Spiders collided with those flames and a loud noise resounded.

Then, the Black Tooth Spiders, who were afraid of flames, got burnt and exploded instantly.

“Amazing…”

Qian Lin looked at this scene, her mouth opened slightly.

Lin Xiu’s flames were even more terrifying than the flames ejected by their flamethrowers.

Guo Ling also nodded subtly. The reason she wanted Lin Xiu to join them was because of this.

The Black Tooth Spider was very afraid of flames and Lin Xiu happened to be a warrior using fire skills. Also, his flames were powerful which was very suitable for this task.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing the rank 6 Black Tooth Spider and gaining 5 million experience!”

“Congratulations Master for killing the rank 6 Black Tooth Spider…”

At this time, Lin Xiu heard this voice constantly in his head and it took him by surprise.

Lin Xiu never thought that these things turned out to be rank 6 evolved beasts!

This was really beyond Lin Xiu’s expectations. As these things were naturally afraid of fire, they were so easy to deal with.

Otherwise, a regular rank 6 evolved beast would not be so easily dealt with.

He could only gain 5 million by killing one but as long as he killed a few more, he could accumulate experience quickly.

As long as he killed 20 of them, he could get 100 million experience!

With that thought, Lin Xiu’s eyes were filled with passion as he held the Dark Edge spear with both hands and brandished it!

Boom boom——

As Lin Xiu waved the spear wildly, one after another flaming birds broke through the sky and charged out!

As soon as the flaming birds hit the bodies of the Black Tooth Spiders, they got burned instantly and within a few seconds, they were annihilated.

The system prompts kept ringing in his mind as he killed the Black Tooth Spiders. The experience board in his mind was increasing non-stop at this moment.

The feeling of gaining experience… so awesome!

“Why does Lin Xiu look like he had such a strong fighting spirit…” Qiu Li muttered as he watched Lin Xiu waving his Dark Edge spear frantically, releasing flames and attacking the Black Tooth Spiders climbing up from all sides.

But there were simply too many of them. As time went by, the flames ejected by the flamethrowers seem to become smaller and smaller.

“Why haven’t the mutated Black Tooth Spider appeared yet?” Guo Ling frowned. They killed around 70 to 80 Black Tooth Spiders already with the flamethrowers alone and Lin Xiu probably killed more.

Mutated Black Tooth Spiders were capable of resisting fire, but it was obvious that no mutated Black Tooth Spiders have appeared.

Boom——

As another flaming bird shot out, several more Black Tooth Spiders that pounced over died.

But what made Lin Xiu puzzled at this time was that there seemed to be a Black Tooth Spider with a larger body and a pale blue skin rushing towards him at an extremely fast speed!

What the hell was this!?
