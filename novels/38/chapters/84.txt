Chapter 85: Baili Haoling

“How stupid, there are marks of birds pecking on the bone, right?” The double-saber teenager glanced askance at Yang Lin at this point and said.

“Who are you calling stupid!” Yang Lin heard his words and his face became extremely nasty.

He stared at the double-saber teenager and said.

“Zhi zhi zhi”

It was then that a sound erupted from the depths of the forest.

A very powerful aura came over and Lin Xiu knitted his brows.

“Here we go.” Lei Liang and the others held their weapons and were very alert at this moment.

Lin Xiu looked at the double-saber teenager; his arms were crossed and he didn’t appear nervous at all, he even had a smirk on his face like he found this interesting.

Soon, a man-eating bird charged over!

The man-eating bird’s body was as big as that of a baby’s. Its wings were black, but its head was bald and it looked exceptionally ugly.

As it flew over, a foul smell suddenly wafted over. It was so strong that Lin Xiu frowned.

“Go to hell!” Lei Liang and the others did not hesitate to wave their weapons to attack at this moment. That rank 2 man-eating bird was killed in the next second.

“Hng, so easy.” Zhang Zhimin held his saber at this moment and cut open the body of that rank 2 man-eating bird, he then immediately took out an Odd Crystal from it.

“No, it is only the beginning.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

Sure enough, when Lin Xiu said that, the sun above him appeared to be completely blocked.

A large number of man-eating birds rushed over at this moment!

The foul smell was even more severe this time and made one a little breathless.

This way!

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted and he threw a punch over!

‘Rupturing Fist!’

As Lin Xiu waved out his fist, the gloves turned red in the next second.

He directly hit the body of a man-eating bird and it exploded instantly.

“Hey, you’re pretty good,” the double-saber teenager said.

“You don’t look too bad either.” Lin Xiu looked over to him and said.

This man was so handsome that Lin Xiu, who thought he was not bad, felt very pressurized.

“What’s your name?” The double-saber teenager asked Lin Xiu with great interest.

“Lin Xiu.”

“My name is Baili Haoling.” The double-saber teenager smiled.

“Baili Haoyin?” [1] Lin Xiu was taken aback and asked.

Baili Haoling was stunned. He gritted his teeth and stared at Lin Xiu, making sure to enunciate each word clearly, “It’s Baili Haoling!”

“You two little imps, quickly come and help!”

It was at this moment that Lei Liang yelled as there were many man-eating birds rushing toward their side.

These man-eating birds might not be very strong separately, but if there were too many of them, it would be fatal if someone accidentally got bitten.

“Really weak.” Baili Haoling narrowed his eyes, his feet tapped the ground and he instantly leaped up high.

‘He’s so fast!’

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted, and at this moment, Lin Xiu could sense the murderous intent from him; it was so thick, unlike what the average person could have.

‘What kind of a person is this guy!?’

Lin Xiu stared at him, and in the next second, Baili Haoling who leaped in the sky moved his hands and the double-saber hanging on his waist were drawn as cold flashes of light appeared in the sky.

They were like meteors across the sky!

Hua la la——

In the next moment, a large number of dead man-eating birds fell from above.

Lei Liang and the others, who were still on their guards, were completely dumbfounded.

About 20 man-eating birds were all dismembered by the chap’s double-saber and their dead bodies all fell to the ground.

Baili Haoling then slowly descended from the sky, his double-saber were placed back into the scabbard and it was as if they were never pulled out in the first place.

Also, he was holding a large number of Odd Crystals in his hands.

“So… so strong.” Lei Liang’s jaw dropped and said subconsciously.

Zhang Zhimin and Wu Xiu’s gaze had changed, especially Zhang Zhimin, his eyes were glistening as he looked at Baili Haoling’s double saber.

“How much did you buy this saber for?” Yang Lin asked Baili Haoling.

To be able to cut those man-eating birds so easily and neatly, his saber must be extraordinary.

“This? My mother made it.” Baili Haoling looked at the double-saber hanging from his waist, smiled, and replied.

Yang Lin nodded.

‘Hng, what a silly boy, but this saber should be pretty good.’

Lin Xiu looked at them and chuckled. This Baili Haoling wasn’t strong because of his double-saber, but it came from the strength in his body. Even if he used another saber, he would probably be able to have the same results.

“They’re gone, they’re gone.” Lei Liang was relieved at this moment.

“Do you want it?” Baili Haoling handed a bunch of Odd Crystals to Lin Xiu.

“Ah?” Lin Xiu was surprised and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry as he replied, “You want to give these Odd Crystals to me?”

“These things are a hindrance, I find that you’re more pleasing to the eye,” Baili Haoling thought about it and said. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Lin Xiu was dumbfounded. Was this guy serious? There were almost 20 rank 2 Odd Crystals!

He would be rich if he sold them, yet he was simply giving them to Lin Xiu?

He was either a fool or there was something wrong with his head.

But Baili Haoling didn’t look like a fool.

“Forget it if you don’t want them.” Baili Haoling pursed his lips. In the next second, those Odd Crystals began to dim slightly and soon became a pile of abandoned stones.

‘How did he absorb it so fast!?’

Even if one used the ‘cultivation technique’ to absorb Odd Crystals, it would still take some time. This person had practiced the ‘cultivation technique’ to this stage already?

When Lei Liang and the others saw those Odd Crystals turn into stones, their hearts were aching and they thought, ‘You could have given it to us if you didn’t want them!’

Time flew by. They didn’t encounter any more danger in the afternoon. Besides, the sky was turning dark and everyone rested in front of a riverbank to prepare to continue on the road the next day.

After all, the night is the most dangerous time.
