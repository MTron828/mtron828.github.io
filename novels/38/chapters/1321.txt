1322 The Start of the Mixed Battle

Baili Haoling looked at Lei Chong before speaking in a solemn tone.

Now that Lei Chong has his beard growing, he does look much older than his age.

With how Baili Haoling commented about it, Lei Chong felt ‘stabbed’.

He had just entered his thirties and he was being told that he’s old?!

!!

“There will be another three man match after this. Although the city lord of Lingxian City was lucky enough not to be matched with Xiao Qingchen, Yuan Zheng is also someone who’s as powerful as Xiao Qingchen.”

The middle aged man stared at the screen as he commented about it.

The battle had been split into two; group A and B.

Lin Xiu would be in group A with Yuan Zheng and Yang Tiantong.

As for Group B, it would be Xiao Qingchen, Niu Jing and Sun Tao.

“As strong as Xiao Qingchen?”

Lei Chong couldn’t help but frown after hearing so.

Xiao Qingchen had proved to them earlier that he was indeed a powerful warrior.

Although Lei Chong had confidence in his city lord, he still felt that a difficult battle would happen soon.

“Yes. Xiao Qingchen from the North and Yuan Zheng from the South. Both of them are the most powerful warrior gods in recent years.

“They have been champions in most of the contests held.”

The middle aged man gently stroked his beard as he continued explaining it to the both of them.

“We’ll see then.”

Baili Haoling did not say much.

No matter how powerful they may be, all Lin Xiu had to do was chop them up!

The match would be happening in the afternoon.

There was at least 2 hours left before the next match.

There was a special training room found backstage prepared for the participants.

There was a rich amount of energy in the air and Lin Xiu was pleasantly surprised when he first noticed it.

“These are the energy produced from the energy stones. Do you even know that, country bumpkin?”

Seeing how Lin Xiu looked surprised when he walked into the room, the man sneered and mocked Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu took a look at his badge and noticed that he was one of the three men in the next battle, Yang Tiantong.

Lin Xiu ignored him and found a comfortable place to cultivate.

With the cultivation technique activated, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the rich amount of energy in the air that was entering into his body through the pores on his skin.

It felt incredibly comfortable.

“Hmph! Just a man from a small city! How dare you be so arrogant?!”

Yang Tiantong has never been discriminated against before and he looked incredibly pissed.

Yuan Zheng was a man with a buzzer cut and he was looking energetic.

As soon as he walked into the room, Yang Tiantong greeted him with a warm welcome.

“Yuan Zheng, I have heard of you since a long time ago. I am hoping to be able to learn from you in the match after this.”

Yang Tiantong spoke to Yuan Zheng respectfully.

“Is that so?”

Yuan Zheng looked at him and did not say much.

He found a spot in the room and sat cross legged on the ground.

This was one of the facilities provided to the participants. This was to allow those who have fought earlier to replenish their energy in order to fight in the next round.

“I think….that we don’t need rubbish in our match later.”

Yang Tiantong spoke to Yuan Zheng who was already seated on the ground.

“What do you mean?”

Yuan Zheng raised his brows as he asked.

“You should know.”

Yang Tiantong peered at Lin Xiu and hinted it at Yuan Zheng.

Seeing what Yang Tiantong was trying to signal at him, Yuan Zheng had an odd expression on his face.

“I do now.”

Yuan Zheng nodded his head.

“It’s nice working with you.”

Yang Tiantong lowered his voice.

Then, a vicious smile appeared on his face.

He had watched the videos of Lin Xiu’s previous matches. Most warrior gods who were able to still be alive at this stage were mostly powerful ones.

He might have mocked Lin Xiu but he didn’t dare to be careless and looked down on Lin Xiu.

Seeing how Yuan Zheng had agreed to his proposal, he was delighted.

...

They would first kill Lin Xiu and then fight each other.

Yuan Zheng may be powerful but…there may still be a chance that he could win.

Time passed by quickly.

Lin Xiu finally opened his eyes after two hours.

“The match will be starting soon!!!!”

There were bustling noises that came from outside the room.

Compared to the matches before, the arena was now filled with people.

It was already the semi-finals and it would be a rare three men match!

“The match is about to start.”

Lei Chong, who took the opportunity to rest earlier, suddenly looked pumped with energy.

“Would I be able to place my bet on this match?”

...

Baili Haoling suddenly thought of something and instantly asked the man sitting next to her.

“Of course. You can do it on the official app of this contest.”

The middle aged man nodded his head.

Baili Haoling turned to her watch and started looking for it on the projection.

“Lin Xiu’s rate is 1:6?”

Lei Chong commented as he looked at the betting ratios.

Yuan Zheng had the lowest as if everyone was sure that Yuan Zheng would win the match.

As for Yang Tiantong, he had a normal ratio.

Most people looked down on Lin Xiu.

“Lei Chong, do you have any money?”

Baili Haoling turned towards Lei Chong.

“I….I don’t”

Lei Chong answered awkwardly.

The currency used here was energy stones. He has not achieved anything yet which was why his account was still at zero.

“Forget it.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Baili Haoling felt helpless. She only had thirty million in his account. Even if she bet everything on Lin Xiu, she would only get 180 million only in the end.

That wasn’t enough.

“Forget it.”

Even if it’s little, it was still more than what she had now!

The match was about to start. If she doesn’t bet on it now, she would have no other choice.

Baili Haoling quickly placed her bet.

“You’re betting thirty million on your city lord?”

The middle aged man chuckled when he saw this.

It was obvious that this woman would be losing all of her money.

He chuckled as he bet on Yuan Zheng.

Although the ratios were low, he would at least be making a profit instead of a loss.

“Please welcome our participants; Lin Xiu, Yuan Zheng and Yang Tiantong!”

The announcer had a loud, penetrative voice that rang through the arena and all three of them jumped onto the stage!

Lin Xiu had a long spear while Yang Tiantong had a sword.

As for Yuan Zheng, he had a pair of warhammers.

These hammers did not look special and it merely looked like a pair of normal metal hammers.

Yang Tiantong peered at Yuan Zheng, hoping that he would remember what they said in the training room.

“Everyone ready? The match will begin in 10 seconds!”

“10, 9, 8….3,2…”

“1!!!!”

“Match starts!”

With the countdown, all three of them moved instantly!
