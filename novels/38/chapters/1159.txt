1160 Invitation Card

However, the Tianlan Pavilion had deeply infiltrated the Lingxian City. Although the members have been killed, would there still be others coming from Lingxian City…..

As they thought about it, all of them looked worried.

They were still holding onto the tools that were used for mining.

Due to the constant fear, they no longer knew how to fight against the members of the Tianlan Pavilion.

“Greetings, City Lord…”

The warriors quickly greeted Lin Xiu.

Due to how they have been mining for a long time, their bodies have been completely drained.

“All of you can leave now.”

Lin Xiu took a look at all of them before announcing it.

They can leave now?!

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, all of the warriors had drastic changes over their faces.

They couldn’t believe what they had just heard.

“Let me tell all of you the great news.”

Mr Pang stepped forward and told the warriors who were gathered around them.

“The City Lord has already destroyed the Tianlan Pavilion.”

“From this day, there will be no Tianlan Pavilion in Lingxian City.”

With that said, all of the warriors looked as if they had been struck by lightning.

“You…what you’re saying is true?”

One of the warriors was trying his best to control his excitement as he asked with his body trembling.

“En.”

Mr Pang nodded his head.

“You’re free now.”

Lin Xiu answered calmly.

Freedom was something that was precious to them.

“Free? We’re free!!!!”

The warriors started screaming in excitement.

They threw away the tools in their hands and removed the specially designed uniform before screaming on top of their lungs.

There were some of them that started crying as well.

Although there were a few of them who were sage warriors, they have been forced to do such dirty works because of the pressure from the Tianlan Pavilion.

They weren’t even being treated as humans.

Now, it felt as if they had been given a second life and they were overjoyed.

Lin Xiu had a faint smile on his face as well when he saw how they reacted.

Time quickly passed.

It has already been ten days since Lin Xiu got to Lingxian City and destroyed the Tianlan Pavilion.

For the past ten days, Lin Xiu has been reading information about the warrior god realm.

Other than the warrior gods that came from other planets, there were some who were born and raised here.

This was why there were still warriors who were here on the planet even if they were not warrior gods.

However, these warriors were obviously much stronger compared to those of the same level on another planet. Plus, their chances of becoming a warrior god would be higher than those from the other planet.

“Still haven’t found her yet.”

Lin Xiu sat by a table as he was using the computer to look for information about Luo Yue.

It was with no surprise that he had not found anything.

The warrior god realm was too wide and looking for Luo Yue was like looking for a needle in a stack of hay.

But, no matter how difficult it was, Lin Xiu would definitely find her.

“Mr Pang, how’s the reconstruction outside?”

Lin Xiu noticed Mr Pang walking through the door and asked for an update.

“Most of them are almost done. The workers have already started on the modification of the city.”

Mr Pang answered Lin Xiu respectfully.

Now, Mr Pang truly respects Lin Xiu from the bottom of his heart.

This was because when the Tianlan Pavilion got annihilated, all of the fortune that they accumulated went to Lin Xiu.

For him, these fortunes were useless.

So, he decided to use them to rebuild Lingxian City.

Lingxian City’s current state looked horrible and even Lin Xiu couldn’t take it.

Plus, there were now guards and workers inside the city lord mansion.

Compared to the cold and empty mansion earlier, it looked much livelier now.

“Alright.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Oh, City Lord! I was told to pass this to you from the City Lord of Manhuang City.”

Mr Pang then pulled out an invitation and passed it to Lin Xiu.

Hmm?

Lin Xiu frowned.

“Let me take a look at it.”

Lin Xiu took the invitation from Mr Pang and took a good look at it. The City Lord of Manhuang City has held a huge meeting and he has invited all the city lords from the surrounding city.

“Mr Pang, do you think that I should go for the meeting?”

Lin Xiu stared at the invitation and he looked curious.

He has only been here for 10 days and he had received such a peculiar invitation.

Lin Xiu, who has already done his research on the cities around him, knew that the Manhuang City was a huge city to the west of Lingxian City.

The City Lord of Manhuang City was not an ordinary man.

“You should.”

Mr Pang hesitated for a moment before nodding his head.

“The Manhuang City would host a Spirit Imprint event every year with the other city lords. Previously, the city lord of the Lingxian City did not get anything from it since they were too weak but Sir, you’re different.”

“You should be the spotlight of the night if you went.”

Mr Pang quickly answered.

“Elder Pang, you seemed to have learnt a few things about flattery.”

Lin Xiu teased Mr Pang.

“No! I am just telling the truth. All of these are from the bottom of my heart.”

Mr Pang shook his head as he answered with a serious look on his face.

Lin Xiu felt that it was a little funny.

But, he was interested in this thing known as the ‘spirits’.

It looks like all of them would get a spirit when they become warriors gods.

Just like the pavilion master that Lin Xiu fought the other day, The huge eyes that were semi-transparent that the pavilion master had used were definitely a spirit.

That spirit caused his body to get stoned and he couldn’t move it at all.

“Alright then. I shall attend this event.”

Lin Xiu answered calmly.

After keeping the invitation aside, Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something before asking Mr Pang, “Elder Pang, if I am looking for someone here, how would I be able to do so?”

“You’re trying to look for someone?”

Mr Pang thought hard about it before saying, “If you aren’t looking for city lords and there isn’t any information on the internet, you can try looking for them at the ‘Sky Eye’.”

“As long as they are in the states of the Warrior God Realm, the ‘skyeye’ will be able to find them.”

Mr Pang gave a firm answer.

It looked like he was quite confident towards ‘Sky Eye’.

“Is ‘Sky Eye’ an organisation?”

Lin Xiu assumed that the ‘Sky Eye’ was like the Shadows found in Nano Planet. He thought that they were an intelligence agency. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“No! The ‘Sky Eye’ is a divine weapon!”

Mr Pang shook his head.

“A Divine Weapon?”

Lin Xiu was stunned.

“Yes. It is a divine weapon of a Noble God. If you can get him to allow you to use the ‘Sky Eye’, you should be able to find the person that you’re looking for.”

Mr Pang nodded his head.
