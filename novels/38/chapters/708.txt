Chapter 709 Extermination!

“You guys are really unlucky.”

Lin Xiu’s figure came out, which instantly made the old man’s complexion extremely ugly. “This is impossible…!!!”

He growled loudly. The flame energy that his attack-type Source mark was so powerful, why, why did it cause Lin Xiu no damage!!!

“I think there should be no one more resistant to thunder and fire attribute energy than me.”

Lin Xiu, who walked out of the flame tornado, said indifferently.

“I didn’t expect that your source marks are of these two types. It’s a pity.”

As Lin Xiu spoke, he slowly stretched out his left hand.

At this moment, Red Lotus Fire and Thunder Lotus Fire appeared in Lin Xiu’s palm. “Source fire?!”

When the old man saw this scene, his eyes widened as if his eyeballs were about to fall out.

“Who the hell are you!!!”

“I’ve already said, an Earthling.”

Lin Xiu sneered, then his body changed, and he rushed towards him!

‘Breaking the World’! The old man looked at this scene, his face changed greatly, and he clenched the sword in both hands, as if he was about to release his skill to attack Lin Xiu.

The recovery speed of a warrior’s body was quite fast. In this short period of time, the source strength in his body has recovered a little, so it could support him to use a skill again.

“Adjudicate’!”

Lin Xiu, who appeared in front of the old man, drew a strange arc directly with the spear in his hand.

The skill that the old man attacked was directly bounced back in the next moment!

Boom–

Under the unbelievable gaze of the old man, his head was instantly split into two halves by his own skill!

If it was in a normal state, ‘Adjudicate’ would definitely not be so easy to take effect against a warrior of a higher rank than himself, but this old man was obviously a spent force and his state has long been incomparable to his state at the beginning. So Lin Xiu managed to use this skill successfully.

“I’m

so tired.”

After seeing that these threats were all killed, Lin Xiu sprawled on the ground, panting a little.

Without using ‘Fury’, Lin Xiu still struggled a little by relying on the power of his body to fight, and facing so many warriors.

Lin Xiu closed his eyes and fell asleep before he knew it. “Quick, quick!”

After some time went by, the sky has completely darkened.

Some people took the lights and walked up the mountain with a big sack.

“You…you see…”

As soon as a man came up, he saw the corpses on the top of the mountain, and he couldn’t help but turn pale with fright.

“Damn!”

The others were also taken aback.

Because the ground was full of corpses, and the surrounding seemed to have been damaged in some way.

“Don’t worry about it so much, get rid of her first!”

A man looked a little nervous at this time, but the lighting equipment illuminated the surroundings and he noticed that there was no one else around so he was relieved. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

These men nodded, and then left the sack still on the ground.

In the next moment, as a man tore the sack apart, a figure appeared in front of them.

“Uuuuuu…”

The woman’s hands and feet were tied together by hemp ropes, and her mouth was covered with tape, so she couldn’t say anything at all.

She opened her eyes wide, looking at the figure of the person in front of her, her expression changed greatly.

A man looked at this scene at this time, and then directly tore off the tape that was attached to her mouth.

Taking a closer look, isn’t this woman Liu Yanran?

“Chen An! It’s you!”

As the tape covering her mouth was torn out, Liu Yanran looked at the man with face paint, shocked and angry. “Humph!”

When the man called Chen An heard Liu Yanran’s words, he couldn’t help but sneer.

“What do you guys want!”

Liu Yanran glanced at these people and said aloud.

She looked calm on the surface, but she was already panicking inside.

Because she saw a lot of corpses around and thought that these people were all killed by Chen An and others.

And now she seemed to be at the top of the mountain. In this kind of place, there was nowhere to turn for help.

“Did you tell your family what happened in the forest previously?”

Chen An looked at Liu Yanran, and said out loud.

“I didn’t.” Liu Yanran stared at him and said coldly.

“You didn’t?”

“That’s for the best, then you don’t need to tell them.”

Chen An was startled, and said with a cruel look on his face. In the forest before, he and another man were under the threat of those people and wanted to attack Liu Yanran, but even so, if the Liu family knew about this matter, Chen An would definitely be doomed.

After all, Liu Yanran belongs to the Liu family while his family was only a small family. In addition, if this matter spread, his reputation will be completely ruined. “What do you mean!?”

Liu Yanran, who clearly felt something, suddenly turned nasty.

“Nothing.”

Chen An laughed wickedly at this time, and then pulled out a short knife from his waist.

Looking at the killing intent in Chen An’s eyes Liu Yanran knew that he really wanted to kill her!

“You’re crazy!”

Liu Yanran’s pretty face turned pale, and she said through gritted teeth.

“I will say that what happened that day has nothing to do with you guys, you guys were just being coerced.”

“Besides, you guys didn’t do anything in the end,” Liu Yanran said calmly even though she was angry at what Chen An wanted to do now. And while she was talking, her body began to struggle.

After all, she was a rank 7 warrior. Logically speaking, as long as the source strength was mobilized, the hemp rope should be able to easily break free.

But just when she wanted to mobilize the source strength of her body, she found that it seemed to be blocked by something, and she couldn’t mobilize it!

“Don’t struggle, I just used the bewitching powder. This bewitching powder can not only make people fall into a temporary coma, but also temporarily suppress the power of warriors below the seventh rank.”

Chen An seemed to have discovered something, and said with a sneer.

Hearing Chen An’s words, Liu Yanran came to her senses. Just now, in a place with few people outside, she suddenly felt dizzy and she closed her eyes, then suddenly she realized that she was here.

“Everyone, do you see? This is the woman of the Liu family. I pursued her for so long in the past and she pretended to be a goddess.”

“I wonder if she was f*cked by the old man who saved her.”
