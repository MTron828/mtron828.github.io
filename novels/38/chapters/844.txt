Chapter 845: One-sided Situation

Lin Xiu!?

The master who he thought was unreliable at the time.

Why is he here?

Just as Lin Xiu walked in, there were some warriors from the Sun family rushing over, trying to kill Lin Xiu.

But at this time, Lin Xiu calmly took out the Dark Edge spear he was carrying.

With a single stroke of the spear, it directly killed the warriors who rushed over.

Luo Yue’s current strength has risen to the level of a King warrior.

Moreover, her physique was special and her swordsmanship was also perfected.

She, Qian Lin and the others will go to the Qian family and they would be fine.

As for Sun Ba, the most powerful warrior of the Sun family, at the peak of king warrior level, in the An family, only Lin Xiu can deal with him, “Courting death!!!”

Sun Ba, who was in the air, saw that Lin Xiu killed a large number of Sun’s warriors in an instant and his face suddenly became hideous.

With a wave of both hands, a very terrifying giant lightning ball was formed and it charged directly towards Lin Xiu below!

“Be careful!”

When An Ruo saw this scene, she couldn’t help roaring loudly.

Boom—

But Lin Xiu didn’t seem to be able to react. At this moment, he was directly hit by the huge lightning ball.

The surrounding ground instantly made a loud noise.

The entire ground collapsed.

An Qi’s eyes were full of worry, just as she was about to say something, she saw Lin Xiu’s figure slowly appearing again.

“Huh? That’s it?”

Lin Xiu raised his head to look at Sun Ba who was above him and said lightly.

This is impossible!

Sun Ba looked down, as if Lin Xiu was not injured at all, his eyes were full of disbelief.

With the blow just now, even if the general King warrior would be seriously injured or even killed without the protection of the ‘Sphere’.

But this young man seemed perfectly fine!

This is really incredible.

“kill him!!!”

After that, the warriors rushed over again and again.

Before those warriors had time to attack, they saw Lin Xiu waving the spear in his hand.

boom boom boom —

At this moment, a large number of flaming birds burst out.

These flaming birds directly charged over!

Those warriors were hit by the flaming birds and in the next moment, they were directly burned into bones.

Some of them didn’t even have a corpse and were immediately annihilated.

Sun Ba, who was in the air, opened his eyes wide in fright..

Hundreds of thousands of warriors were wiped out just like that!?

Not only Sun Ba, but even the people of the An family were stunned.

Looking at Lin Xiu over there, he was like a god.

“I’ll give you a ride.”

Lin Xiu raised his eyes and looked at Sun Ba who was in the air. With a slight force on his legs, he jumped straight into the air!

“Go to hell!”

Seeing Lin Xiu rushing up, Sun Ba roared and two huge lightning spears appeared in his hands.

He directly volleyed towards Lin Xiu, who was rushing up.

Whizzing–

But Lin Xiu, who flew up, triggered a thought and a large number of matrices suddenly appeared under his feet.

Using the matrix as a pedal, he easily dodged the two huge lightning spears. At the same time, he held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and stabbed directly at Sun Ba!

The pupils in Sun Ba’s eyes shrank suddenly.

Subconsciously unfold the ‘Sphere’.

Boom—

But as soon as his ‘Sphere’ unfolded, there was a loud noise.

A huge hole appeared in the whole ‘Sphere’.

Sun Ba in the ’round’ opened his eyes wide, then looked down at his chest.

He found that a huge bloody hole had appeared in his chest.

“you...”

“goodbye.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Lin Xiu’s figure had already appeared behind him, then he said lightly.

Sun Ba still had a look of disbelief in his eyes.

How could he, a King warrior closest to becoming Respected warrior get killed by a nobody?

boom–

In the next moment, his body hit the ground heavily.

“Sun Ba... is he dead?”

An Ruo and An Jun seemed to be frozen at this time, looking at Lin Xiu’s body over there, their eyes filled with disbelief.

Sun Ba, who was so powerful, was killed so easily. What is the origin of this kid?

An Jun widened his eyes.

“An Qi, you...you said he was your master?”

“En, his name is Lin Xiu and he’s my master!”

At this moment, An Qi had a proud look in her eyes.

The Sun family’s attempt to ‘reorganize’ Cangqiong City this time has undoubtedly failed.

The high-level warriors from the Qian family were all beheaded by Luo Yue.

And Sun Ba, the strongest member of the Sun family, was also killed by Lin Xiu.

Next, it was the An Family and the Qian Family counterattack.

This time, the An family and the Qian family not only were not destroyed, but they survived, annexed the strength of the Sun family and became stronger.

And the Sun family has completely disappeared.

“This time, if it wasn’t for Brother Lin, our An family would be a great disaster, thank you!”

On the night of the second day, the An Family and the Qian Family were holding a banquet on the top floor of the most exclusive hotel in Cangqiong City.

At this time, An Jun raised his glass and said respectfully to Lin Xiu.

“My Qian family wants to thank you too.”

Qian Po, the patriarch of the Qian family, also said with gratitude at this time.

“you are welcome.”

Lin Xiu smiled lightly, raised his glass and drank it with them.

“Brother Lin, where have you been this year? Tell us.”

At this time, Liu Pan, who was sitting on the other side, said out of curiosity.

“Yes, master, tell us about it.”

An Qi and Qian Lin were very curious at this time.

Lin Xiu smiled helplessly, then he picked out some experiences and told them.

Both An Qi and Qian Lin were amazed by those magical and thrilling places.

Everyone was very happy at the banquet tonight and soon it was late at night.

“Luo Yue, she...”

At this moment, Luo Yue seemed to have fallen asleep suddenly, leaning on Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

Seeing this scene, Luo Yan said subconsciously.

“Sequelae.”

Lin Xiu sighed, a look of guilt in his eyes.

And told Luo Yan the matter.

Carrying Luo Yue back to the residence, Lin Xiu said to Luo Yan who walked with him, “I will need to trouble you to take care of Luo Yue.”

“Where are you going?”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yan was stunned for a moment, then said aloud.

“Fengyun City.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Some things should be dealt with.

Moreover, he didn’t know if the Luo family has a solution to the sequelae caused by the Luo family’s secret method that Luo Yue used.

“You’re crazy, how could you go there!”

When Luo Yan heard Lin Xiu’s words, her eyes widened and she cursed at Lin Xiu.
