Chapter 482: Who Dares to Bully You?

At that very moment, one of the students suddenly stood up and pointed at Zhao Xia.

After what he said, the crowd with their hundred eyes immediately turned towards him.

With so many staring at him, Zhao Xia felt his scalp turn numb.

But, he was Zhao Xia after all. He wasn’t afraid of these mere students.

“Li Ling, you’re asking for it?” Zhao Xia ignored everyone’s stare on him. Instead, he turned towards the student and threatened him.

Zhao Xia’s eyes were clearly threatening Li Ling and it made him look a little terrifying.

But, Li Ling still mustered up the courage to fight Zhao Xia and said, “You were the one who closed the door and didn’t allow everyone in!”

“It’s true! I saw it as well. It was Zhao Xia!”

“It’s him. It wasn’t Teacher Zhang’s fault!”

Although there were a lot of students from the Bei Dou Academy who were afraid of Zhao Xia, Li Ling stood up against him and this gave courage to the other students as well.

“Li Ling, you’re dead!!!!”

After being pointed out by so many people, Zhao Xia turned angry and dashed towards Li Ling!

Xiu – –

Zhao Xia may be a useless son of a wealthy family, his abilities were still above average amongst the students here.

Plus, he was moving at a very fast speed. He managed to stand in front of Li Ling instantly and his fists had already landed on Li Ling’s body!

Boom – –

Li Ling, who was skinny and weak, was immediately turned into air with that punch.

But, Zhao Xia had no intention of stopping there. He continued moving forward and his eyes were filled with anger. He lifted up his leg and was about to step onto Li Ling’s head that was on the ground.

This was murder!

Boom – –

At that instant, Li Ling could feel a sharp pain on his knee as if he had been hit by something. Along with that sharp pain, he screamed and immediately fell onto the ground.

“AHHHHH!!!!”

He has never felt this sort of pain and had already grabbed onto his right knee, crying in pain.

“This is just a lesson.” Lin Xiu, who was far from him, was busy playing with the stones in his hands as he warned Zhao Xia with a sneer.

“It was him!” The girl next to Ye Shuanger, Donger, suddenly screamed when he saw Zhao Xia’s face. She pointed to his face and said, “It was him!”

“What is it?” Ye Shuanger was shocked and asked as she was confused.

“When we were getting on the spaceship, he was the one who pulled me onto the ground, allowing the others to step on me!” Donger said out of rage.

After hearing what she said, some of the students noticed that there were footprints on Donger’s clothes and they felt guilty.

If it wasn’t because Donger was already a rank 1 warrior, she would have been killed.

“All of you are just rubbish! It doesn’t matter if you are dead!!!!” Due to the pain that was coming from his knees, Zhao Xia has turned mad and started screaming.

Lin Xiu frowned when he heard what was said but before Lin Xiu could react, Luo Yue had already walked towards Zhao Xia.

“You talk too much.” Luo Yue told him with a dull voice. She lifted her sword with the right hand and chopped off one of his fingers!

“AHHHHHH!!!!1”

Zhao Xia let out a cry that was similar to a pig being slaughtered.

“I’m going to kill you! I’m going to kill you!!!!” When Zhao Xia saw his finger that went missing, he started screaming loudly.

“If you say another word, I will chop off all 10 fingers of yours.” Luo Yue’s eyes turned ice-cold as she said towards him.

The rest of the students covered their mouths as well and didn’t dare say another word.

“Please don’t do this.” Teacher Zhang begged for mercy from Luo Yue and Lin Xiu and he was looking very anxious.

“This is how you act as a teacher?” Lin Xiu looked at Teacher Zhang with a spiteful look in his eyes.

“I…..” Teacher Zhang looked shameful and embarrassed after hearing what Lin Xiu said.

“Brother Lin Xiu, that’s not it.” Ye Shuanger had no other choice but to explain it to Lin Xiu.

“He is Zhao Xia, the son of the Zhao family in Bai Di City. If anything happens to him, the Zhao family would be coming after us.”

The rest of the students got reminded of Zhao Xia’s identity and all of them looked afraid.

“I don’t care if he is a dog or a cat from the Zhao family. If he dares to bully you, I will make sure to ruin his entire family.” Lin Xiu said in a cold tone as he glared at Zhao Xia.

All of the students let out an envious look after hearing what Lin Xiu said.

“All of you are dead! HAHAHAHAH! DEAD!!!”

With the intense pain, it caused Zhao Xia to turn crazy as he was on the ground.

Koong Loong – – Koong Loong – –

Then, a spaceship suddenly appeared but this was a much smaller spaceship than the one before.

“Move back! There’s someone here to get us!” Teacher Zhang screamed out loud when he saw the spaceship.

After hearing what he said, the crowd quickly moved towards the side and stood right next to the zombie’s corpse, giving space for the spaceship to land.

Lin Xiu looked downwards and noticed that the entire Bai Dou Academy was covered by muddy waters.

There were still one or two zombies who were wandering around in the waters.

But, he was sure that the waves of the zombies were over.

Soon, the smaller spaceship slowly landed on the ground.

Boom — –

With the spaceship safely landed, the doors to the spaceship opened.

There was a group of people that slowly walked out of the spaceship.

“Director Qian!” Teacher Zhang looked at the man with the golden frame specs and immediately waved at him.

“Teacher Zhang?!” Director Qian frowned when he saw Teacher Zhang. Then, he pointed at the other spaceship and asked, “Why haven’t you left with the spaceship just now? I thought that something major had happened…” Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What are all these?!” Because he could finish his sentence, he widened his eyes in surprise. He was resting on the spaceship and he didn’t see the situation from the spaceship earlier. He finally noticed what was around them. The ground around them was filled with the corpse of the zombies and he was shocked.

“These were zombies.”

“We were about to leave when the zombies started coming after us. The engine got destroyed by the evolved beast which is why we couldn’t leave.” Teacher Zhang briefly told him what had happened earlier.

“Both of you are the ones who killed these zombies?”
