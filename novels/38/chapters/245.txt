Chapter 246: New Mission

“Well, you are?” Zhang Yin looked at these people who came by suddenly and asked curiously.

Judging by their outfits, they were in the light blue uniform of the Sacred Region Academy and after taking a closer look at the print on it, he realized that these people were second-year seniors of the Sacred Region Academy.

What were they doing here?

At this time, Zhang Yin and the others became curious.

“En, is your class monitor, Lin Xiu around?” The girl glanced around at this time, but she didn’t see Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu?

Hearing that they were looking for Lin Xiu, Zhang Yin and Li Ping expressions changed.

The day before, Lin Xiu defeated Yu Yi who was a second-year student which probably upset many second-year students.

After all, Lin Xiu was just a freshman. Defeating the rank 6 Yu Yi was simply a slap in the face for a second-year student.

Could it be that Yu Yi’s people were now looking for Lin Xiu for revenge?

“Don’t get us wrong, we won’t find trouble with him.” A guy saw the look on their faces and smiled suddenly.

“Who is looking for me?” At this time, the door of the gravity room opened.

Lin Xiu walked over and said while wiping the sweat from his face.

After a morning of training, Lin Xiu was already sweating all over and there were many traces of laser burns on his arms.

As soon as he opened the door, Lin Xiu overheard their conversation.

Although Lin Xiu was a little far away, his hearing was very strong now and he could easily hear the conversation there. He slowly made his way over.

Looking at the group of people, Lin Xiu could easily tell from the clothes on their bodies that these were second-year students.

“Hello, classmate Lin.” Among them, a girl with a ponytail said to Lin Xiu politely.

Lin Xiu was slightly startled when he saw this person. These people didn’t look like they wanted to find trouble with him.

Lin Xiu asked, “Is anything the matter?”

The woman nodded, then looked at Lin Xiu and said, “We want to ask you to complete a mission with us.”

“A mission?” Lin Xiu knitted his brows slightly.

He knew that in the Sacred Region Academy, they were able to accept missions and get paid.

And when accepting the mission, if the location of the mission was outside, you could apply to leave the academy.

You just needed to come back within the specified time.

“You guys are second-year students, there’s no reason to ask me, right?” Lin Xiu waved and laughed.

Many of the second-year students were quite strong and there were many of them who were much stronger than him. Logically speaking, there was really no need for them to look for Lin Xiu.

They seemed to know that Lin Xiu would ask this question. They smiled and said, “No, your power can’t be replaced by others.”

“Huh?” Lin Xiu was slightly taken aback, he thought that these guys came here to curry favor with him?

“Do you know about the Dark Forest?” One of the guys looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

‘Dark Forest!?’

Hearing the words Dark Forest, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted suddenly.

Isn’t that the place where Luo Yue went?

And it is very dangerous there, it is S-grade!

With that thought, he couldn’t help but worry about Luo Yue.

Luo Yue’s current strength was only at rank 5 and the risk of going there should also be extremely high.

“For warriors who can use fire skills there, it wouldn’t be so difficult there.”

One of the guys said to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu had read the introduction of the Dark Forest before and many evolved beasts over there were afraid of flames.

His fire attribute skill should have a strong restraining effect on those evolved beasts.

“We watched the battle between you and Yu Yi yesterday and felt that you are very strong, so we sincerely hope that you can go there with us.” At this time, the girl with the ponytail said aloud.

Lin Xiu glanced at these people, the Analytic Eye was activated instantly, and he discovered that their strengths were all at rank 6!

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

Even rank 6 warriors were afraid of the Dark Forest…

“What’s in it for me?” Lin Xiu said plainly.

Hearing this, they knew that Lin Xiu was already a little interested.

“The reward for completing the task is 300,000 points and there is an item reward. If the six of us go together, we will give you 150,000 points, but the remaining 150,000 points and the reward item will belong to us.” One of the men said to Lin Xiu at this time.

Item reward?

150,000 points weren’t a lot to Lin Xiu. The points he had obtained in the Tower of Tournament and the points he had been awarded previously added up to a total of about 100,000 points already.

In terms of points, it was not too important for Lin Xiu.

“What is the item reward?” Lin Xiu asked.

At this moment, hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the guy frowned slightly, then he looked at the girl with the ponytail.

After the ponytail girl nodded, the man answered, “Snow silkworm.”

This was a special evolved beast. It was very small and like its name, its whole body was like a silkworm covered in snow and ice.

The precious thing about this was that it can be used as a medicine and could be mixed with other ingredients to make the human body absorb the energy of the odd crystal faster.

This thing was very rare.

“This thing is very important to us.” The guy looked at Lin Xiu, thinking that Lin Xiu coveted this thing. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“No, I don’t want it.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said. This thing was indeed good for ordinary warriors, especially those who wanted to attack advanced warriors.

But Lin Xiu had a system and if he wanted to advance, he only needed to gain enough experience.

“Then you…”

“When are we going?” Lin Xiu interrupted before the guy could finish his sentence.

“If you are sure you want to join us, we can set off at noon tomorrow.” The girl with the ponytail looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“Sure.” Lin Xiu nodded.

It was too boring to train here. Also, in terms of the speed of improving his strength, it couldn’t be compared to killing evolved beasts and gaining experience.

“Okay, let’s get to know each other, I am Guo Ling.” The girl with the ponytail nodded, then stretched out her hand and said to Lin Xiu.
