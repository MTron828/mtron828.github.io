Chapter 255: Class-A Wanted Criminal

What was that?

Lin Xiu furrowed his brows.

Could it be a signal? DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Can’t you use your phone instead, huh?” Lin Xiu looked at these people and said coldly.

Like he was looking at idiots.

Guo Ling and the others had also dealt with those people at this moment and walked towards Lin Xiu.

“So it’s you guys.” Guo Ling looked at the men and said.

Qiu Li and the others knitted their brows when they saw the men.

“Hng!” The man heard Guo Ling’s words and his eyes became icy.

There were over 20 dead bodies on the ground which sent a chill down his spine.

“Do you guys know that you guys must die for offending us?” The man was somewhat fearful but still put on a brave front.

“You talk a lot of nonsense.” Lin Xiu said faintly.

Then, he raised the Dark Edge spear in his hand and charged forward directly!

Seeing this scene, this man’s expression changed.

He has never met someone who was so unpredictable and didn’t play by the rules before.

“Kill him!” This man yelled.

Then, the warriors behind him immediately charged towards Lin Xiu with their weapons!

Rank 5 warrior!

They were all rank 5 warriors!

But these warriors were different from those before, their close combat strength was clearly much stronger.

Those warriors just now were probably used to using laser guns so they were weaker in close combat.

This was also a reason why Lin Xiu could instantly kill so many rank 5 warriors.

Dang dang dang——

As they charged over with their weapons, Lin Xiu directly stabbed his Dark Edge spear out.

The long spear and the weapons of those attacking, and suddenly made a niche of the metal collision.

“Kill!” Qiu Li and the others roared and ran over with their weapons.

After all, they were all students of the Sacred Region Academy and were relatively powerful

“Hng!”

Lin Xiu looked at these men attacking with all sorts of weapons from all directions and his gaze changed. In the next moment, he continued to use ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ and charged over.

Those people saw this and went pale in shock as they tried to block Lin Xiu’s attack with their weapons.

But a powerful force came over the moment the spearhead of the Dark Edge spear knocked their weapons.

Those people’s hands became numb and they dropped their weapons to the ground directly.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s eyes revealed a murderous intent and the Dark Edge spear in his hand gave off a bright white glow as he slashed across.

‘Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall’!!!

Bang bang bang——

The few people around the area had their necks slashed by the spear, their arteries ruptured and blood splattered everywhere!

After killing about five or six people with a single skill, Lin Xiu did not stop and continued attacking!

“Stop!!!”

Just as the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was about to stab, a loud howl came from the other side.

This voice was very loud and deafening.

Bang—— As this sound rang out, Lin Xiu felt as if the tip of his spear had stabbed into a transparent barrier.

The huge impact caused Lin Xiu to take a few steps back.

Sphere!?

Sure enough, at this moment, he suddenly saw a middle-aged man standing in front of him, staring straight into his eyes.

“You’re here?!” When the man just now saw this middle-aged man, he was surprised.

Lin Xiu had killed five to six of his rank 5 warriors and was about to charge towards him which really frightened him.

Fortunately, real help has now arrived.

“Rank 6 warrior?!” Qiu Li and others held their weapons and looked at the man warily.

The “sphere ‘of this person covered a large area and surrounded everyone nearby.

Now, Guo Ling and the rest couldn’t rush over.

It was obvious that this person was extremely strong.

“You are Zhou Wenhao?” Guo Ling knitted his brows and seemed to have recalled something.

“Oh? Do you know our vice president?” Those people who had a conflict with Lin Xiu and the rest had a look of surprise when they heard what Guo Ling said.

“Who is he?” Lin Xiu looked at Guo Ling and asked.

“It should be him.”

“Zhou Wenhao, Class-A wanted criminal.” Guo Ling nodded slightly and said.

Class-A wanted crime? !

After hearing what Guo Ling said, not only Lin Xiu but even Qiu Li and the others were taken aback.

Class-A wanted criminals were very powerful warriors.

Ordinary union police officers couldn’t deal with these warriors at all and those listed as Class-A criminals were ones who had committed serious crimes.

“This person slaughtered a small town in the city of our Huaxia area.” Guo Ling stared at the middle-aged man ahead.

Qiu Li and the rest gasped.

He actually killed a small town!

“Seems like you know quite a bit.” Zhou Wenhao stared at Guo Ling and smirked.

“You are very brave ah and actually ganged up with a Class-A wanted criminal.” Qiu Li looked at the man and said coldly.

A Class-A wanted criminal is a felon and those who cover up or are accomplices of the criminal would also face the death penalty.

When other warriors encounter a Class-A criminal, they were allowed to kill the criminal directly. After confirming the killing of the Class-A criminal through 3D images, DNA, and other data input, the warriors could receive rewards.

“So what?” The man looked at Qiu Li and said in an icy tone.

“You think that you can leave here today?”

“I would like to find out how much your bounty is.” Lin Xiu did not pay attention to the words of these people and looked at Zhou Wenhao.

Lin Xiu had no fear in his eyes, he actually looked quite excited for the fight.

He finally encountered an opponent that he could fight to his heart’s content.

Zhou Wenhao raised his brows after hearing Lin Xiu’s words.

This was the first time a “low-ranking” warrior dared to provoke him this way.

And this was even after Lin Xiu found out that he was a Class-A wanted criminal.
