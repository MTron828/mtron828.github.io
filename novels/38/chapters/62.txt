Chapter 63: Unlocking A New Skill

On the tournament stage stood a man with his spear, looking like he despised the world.

“I…” Chen Xiao looked at the sharp tip of the spear that was pressing against his neck and felt like he was stuck.

One move, just one move and he lost?

“I’ve lost.” Although very reluctant, Chen Wei still admitted his defeat with a bitter smile.

Chen Wei, tanked 150th, was defeated!

“Lin Xiu! Lin Xiu!”

Many of the students below shouted excitedly.

This was really too shocking. So the wooden box on Lin Xiu’s back turned out to be a weapon! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

And it was a spear.

“No. 1024, Lin Xiu, wins!” The referee announced.

He looked at Lin Xiu with a hint of surprise in his eyes. Lin Xiu definitely wouldn’t be able to execute that level of attack just now if he didn’t know his weapon extremely well.

Mr. Ye looked at Lin Xiu from his seat and was taken aback.

Looks like this kid has improved a lot…

“Mr. Ye, look, student Zhang Chao, who is ranked 23rd, is going up!” The headmaster sat next to Mr. Ye and pointed over there excitedly.

Mr. Ye’s status was so special that even he, the headmaster, had to suck up to him.

Hearing the headmaster’s words, Mr. Ye did not look there but continued to look in Lin Xiu’s direction.

He felt that Lin Xiu was becoming more and more interesting.

I wonder if Lin Xiu would bring any more surprises?

“Lin Xiu, welcome back!” Luo Li watched as Lin Xiu got off the stage and smiled.

The rest of the students from Class 29 came over with a look of surprise on their faces.

After all, Lin Xiu had made their class proud.

“You seem to be getting stronger again,” Zhang Yi looked at Lin Xiu and said.

At first, he used Lin Xiu as a benchmark, but Lin Xiu’s progress was so fast that he had no way to catch up.

Lin Xiu smiled at him but didn’t say anything.

“Where did you go to train this month?” Yang Tian came over at this moment and patted Lin Xiu on the shoulder.

“Haha, a very dangerous place.” Lin Xiu laughed.

He still felt quite emotional when he was back at the academy. That one-month-long “clean-up” trip at Guang Ming Fort was still vivid in his mind.

After experiencing a life and death situation over there, the friendship forged with the soldiers was also unforgettable.

Speaking of which, he had really gotten some good out of misfortune and had to ‘thank’ the Tang Family for giving him this opportunity.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but laugh coldly at that thought.

He would slowly take his revenge.

“Oh right, what is this thing?” Yang Tian looked curiously at the android wolf over there.

The rest of the people also looked in that direction. This android wolf that had a mechanical feel to it made the students attracted to it.

“Just an ordinary mechanical saddle horse, a means of transportation,” Lin Xiu didn’t explain much and said indifferently.

After all, this thing was made during the mecha age and was so complete – it could fetch a very high price.

It would be bad if someone lusted over it.

“I’ve never really seen anything like this before.” Yang Tian shook his head and didn’t think much about it.

Also, the history of the mecha age wasn’t in the regular textbooks so the vast majority of students did not know about these things.

There was still some time before he had to go up on the stage again, Lin Xiu sat under a big tree at the back of the field and entered the system to view the notifications.

As he was unconscious previously and rushed over this morning, there were many messages that he hadn’t seen.

“Congratulations Master on reaching level 15!”

“Congratulations Master on successfully reaching level 15. You’ve gained a chance to draw a prize!”

“Congratulations Master on acquiring a new skill, ‘Disguise’!

“Congratulations Master on successfully unlocking the Gene Lock, do you want to begin unlocking rank 1 Gene Lock?”

A lot of information surged in, making Lin Xiu a little confused.

What he was sure about was that he had acquired a new skill called ‘Disguise’.

He tapped on the ‘Disguise’ icon and could see the skill’s introduction: ‘Disguise’, after successful use, you can conceal the warrior’s aura, becoming just like an ordinary person. Unless there is someone more than 2 ranks above you, nobody would be able to detect you. (Note: Can be activated or deactivated at any time.)

Lin Xiu pursed his lips. This skill does not seem to be of much use, huh…

What’s the point of disguising?

He had one chance in the lottery, but Lin Xiu was not ready to use it now. After all, there were many people here.

He tapped on the Gene Lock option and a notification suddenly popped up: Do you want to unlock the rank 1 Gene Lock now? [Y/N]

(Note: There is a 10 percent chance of death in the process of unlocking the Gene Lock, 20 percent chance of becoming unconscious, and 30 percent chance of an unpredictable outcome…）

“Damn!” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but curse when he read that.

You’re kidding!

After thinking about it, Lin Xiu still did not press ‘Y’. This system was simply a scam, you could even die.

And it was a 10 percent chance!

Summing up the rest, the success rate of unlocking the rank 1 gene lock was only 40 percent.

Lin Xiu didn’t dare to gamble.

Looking at his stats board, Lin Xiu added all the previous 15 potential points to Strength.

As soon as the potential points were added, Lin Xiu felt strength spread all over his body.

The heavy Silver Immortal Soul spear now didn’t feel heavy at all and was also easier to handle.

“No. 1024, Lin Xiu!”

Just then, a voice resounded again.

Lin Xiu heard his name and went over straightaway.

Those who got picked were all beginner warriors and the stronger ones were only quasi-warriors, so there was no pressure at all for Lin Xiu.

He got rid of them in seconds!

Those students were already numbed and many people were thinking that it was possible for Lin Xiu to be directly squeezed into the top 50 of the combat strength list when he went to test his combat strength.

“He actually returned from Guang Ming Fort…” The dean, Zhang Lin, knitted his brows as he looked at Lin Xiu, who had easily defeated his opponent again on the stage.

That’s right, he was the school leader who had previously proposed that Lin Xiu should be assigned to the Guang Ming Fort for a ‘clean-up’ mission.

As the Zhang Family was the Tang Family’s vassal family, in order to curry favor with the head of the Tang Family, he used his connections to punish Lin Xiu.

But he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would survive there and come back even stronger?

No way, he must find a way to kill that guy, or Tang Mubai was going to treat him like garbage.

He thought about it and looked at the computer’s automated balloting system as a sly smile appeared on the corners of his mouth.
