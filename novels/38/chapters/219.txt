Chapter 220: Points Ranking

Tian Zixia nodded, then handed her bag over to the old man.

The old man nodded and placed her bag on the machine behind him.

Di di di-

The machine activated and information came up.

“208 Rank 5 odd crystals, 10 rank 6 odd crystals.”

“Total score, 258 points.”

1 Rank 5 odd crystal was worth 1 point and a rank 6 odd crystal was worth 5 points.

The old man keyed in the numbers and north campus class 1 immediately became first place.

Tian Zixia’s mouth curved upwards when she saw the board.

Many of Sacred Region Academy students exclaimed when they saw the number of odd crystals

“So many odd crystals…” Jiang Li clenched his fists tightly.

It would be much harder to grab first place if that was the case, and they did not know how Lin Xiu was.

The airship would not wait and any achievements after that would be nulled if they did not arrive by 12.

“Someone else is here!” Right at this time, a few students saw another group appear.

Aside from those dead, almost everyone had returned back well and alive.

“Zhuo Qixing?” Zhang Yin and the others frowned when they saw them.

Zhuo Qixing’s complexion was not well, Lin xiu and Luo Yue had disappeared and they were unable to find them.

He was fuming with rage upon recalling how Lin Xiu had taken advantage of everyone and obtained the rank 8 odd crystal.

He walked to the front gloomily, looked at Zhang Yin and the others and realized that they were south campus class 10 people. He snorted, “You’re still waiting for them? I think they are already dead.”

It was not easy to absorb a rank 8 odd crystal. The reason why Lin Xiu had yet to appear might be his body had exploded because of the powerful energy inside the rank 8 odd crystal.

Upon thinking about this, his complexion became slightly better.

“What do you mean by that!?” Zhang Yin and the others were infuriated at his words and glared at him.

“Scram!” Zhuo Qixing snorted and walked to the registry counter.

“South campus class 1, let’s see how many you’ve gathered.” the old man at the counter looked at them and said.

Zhuo Qixing looked back at Luo Xiaoqi.

He nodded and took his bag over. It was bulging and everyone knew that it was filled with odd crystals.

Countless of the other students turned to look.

The number of odd crystals far exceeded their expectations.

“Oh? North campus class one only has that number of odd crystals?” Zhuo Qixing looked at the table and saw the number of odd crystals as well as points earned by the competitor and smirked.

“Hehe, how many do you think you’ll get?” Tian Zixia retorted coldly.

She panicked slightly when she saw Luo Xiaoqi’s bag. It looked like they had no hope of being first.

‘Damn!’

If not for Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, they would have held first place for sure!

Di di di di-

As the machine tabulated the score, the screen quickly revealed the contents of the bag.

“200 rank 5 odd crystals, 12 rank 6 odd crystals, total tally of 280 points.”

South Campus class 1 rank immediately went to first place.

“Apologies, seems like our south campus class 1 will be taking first place in this freshmen assembly.” Zhuo Qixing glanced at Tian Zixia and spoke indifferently.

Tian Zixia fumed angrily, if not for the 60 odd crystals they had given to Lin Xiu, first place would be in their hands.

“Right, where’s your team leader Ouyang Hang? I can’t wait to fight with him.” Zhuo Qixing looked over and asked.

Tian Zixia glared at him ferociously and snorted, “Don’t celebrate too early, you might not be first.”

“Is that so?” Zhuo Qixing smirked, the majority of the students were back and he did not believe that there would be someone who had obtained more odd crystals than them.

“Lin Xiu!?”

Right at this time, Zhang Yin and the others saw Lin Xiu and Luo Yue and immediately called out in joy!

Tian Zixia and Zhuo Qixing’s expressions changed as they looked back.

They saw Lin Xiu and Luo Yue walking over.

He squinted his eyes, he did not expect Lin Xiu and Luo Yue to actually look fine.

Tian Zixia’s eyes were filled with rage, if not for Lin Xiu, they would have been first!

“Good that you’re fine, let’s go register our results!” Zhang Yin and the others heaved a sigh of relief when they saw that Lin Xiu was fine and immediately urged them.

It was already 11 plus and if they did not hit the time, their results would be void.

Lin Xiu nodded and walked over and saw the two ‘familiar’ people.

One was Zhuo Qixing, the other was Tian Zixia.

“Hehe, who would have thought that you would be alive.” Zhuo Qixing sneered.

“I didn’t expect you to be alive.” Lin Xiu replied indifferently.

“South campus class 10?” The old man saw Lin Xiu’s insignia and asked.

“En.”

Everyone turned to look over at Lin Xiu, he was only a student from south campus class 10, why were Zhuo Qixing and Tian Zhixia paying attention to him?

The other students did not understand. Only a few Sacred Region Academy students that had seen Lin Xiu’s moves truly understood how terrifying he was.

“This is what we gathered.” Zhang Yin took out more than 20 odd crystals.

“You killed so many?” Lin Xiu asked with surprise.

“En, we took the chance and collaborated to kill them.” Zhang Yin chuckled.

“Only these? If you have so few, that’s worth roughly 20 points.” The old man rubbed his mustache and chuckled.

“No, there’s more here.” Lin Xiu replied and placed his bag on the platform.

Bang-

The loud sound attracted everybody’s attention, to look at Lin Xiu’s bulging bag.

“Don’t tell me… everything inside is odd crystals?” A few students were stunned by the sight of the bag and asked.
