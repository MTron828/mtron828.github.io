Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

At this time, he looked to the front and saw that there were still many people coming and going at the gate of the city.

Hm?

Moreover, Lin Xiu, whose eyes are very sharp, could clearly see that on the display screen at the gate of the city – it had a photo of him!

It seems that the people of these four major forces were all looking for him.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly at this time, then he clicked on the mask he had won from the system lottery before.

Lin Xiu abandoned the android battle tiger outside the city.

He went directly to the city gate.

At this time, he looked closely and could clearly see that there were a large number of guards walking back and forth at the gate of the city. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

This time, the guards of Wildfire City had become even stricter.

But to Lin Xiu, it was nothing.

When he was about to arrive at the city gate, Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered and his body skill was displayed.

‘Flashing Souls’!

The whole person seemed to be teleported and disappeared in an instant.

......

“Di di di di!”

At the same time, there was a sound from the door.

“There’s someone?”

A guard immediately became alert when he heard this voice.

He turned around and looked around, but he didn’t see anyone.

This made him upset.

“Is this machine broken?”

The rest of the guards also looked around and said curiously.

But no matter how much they looked, they found that no one passed.

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s figure had reached the other side of the street.

‘Flashing souls’ – This holy-level body skill was so powerful that it was almost equivalent to teleportation.

At this moment, although Lin Xiu was wearing a mask.

But no one paid attention to him.

After all, in Wildfire City, there were many different weird people around.

“Tsk tsk, the global limited edition android battle horse is now up for auction.”

Just as Lin Xiu was walking on the other side of the street, he saw the scene on the other side of the street.

Android battle horse?

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, his eyes narrowed slightly.

Isn’t this his Android battle horse?

He wasn’t sure when someone brought it here.

“Global limited edition, full of power, starting at 50 million.”

The oily man stood beside the android battle horse and said with a smile.

“Sixty million!”

“Seventy million!”

“…”

At this time, some of the surrounding warriors made offers.

The craftsmanship of this android battle horse was very good and once an odd crystal was put in, it could use the power of the odd crystal to deploy a special shield to protect the owner.

The speed was also very fast.

“this is mine.”

When the surrounding warriors were making offers, Lin Xiu walked in and said indifferently.

“Little brother, if you want it, make an offer.”

The oily man said with a smile at this time.

“I said, this android battle horse is mine.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

After entering this Wildfire City, his android battle horse was clearly stored on the other side. He didn’t know how they stole it and brought it here.

“Brother, you can’t talk nonsense.”

The man’s face suddenly turned ugly.

“come over.”

Lin Xiu looked at the Android battle horse and said lightly.

As soon as Lin Xiu’s words fell, the eyes of this android battle horse lit up and it seemed to glance at Lin Xiu before walking towards Lin Xiu.

“This limited-edition android battle horse has voice recognition and iris scanning. Looking at the situation now, this android battle horse must be his…”

When some warriors saw this scene, they immediately began to whisper.

The expression of the man who just said he wanted to sell this android battle horse turned extremely ugly.

“this is mine!”

He roared loudly, then several warriors appeared behind, surrounding Lin Xiu.

“Boy, although I don’t know what method you used to control my android battle horse, let me tell you, this android battle horse belongs to me.”

The man said coldly at this time.

“I’m sorry everyone, we Dark Shadow people, need to deal with something.”

As he spoke to Lin Xiu, he glanced at the surrounding warriors and said indifferently.

When the surrounding warriors heard the word ‘Dark Shadow’, the expressions in their eyes changed slightly.

Soon, the warriors gathered here all dispersed.

“Boy, do you know the fate of going against our Dark Shadow people?”

After the man watched the surrounding warriors disperse, he looked at Lin Xiu who was wearing a mask and said lightly.

“Well, then what?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“It seems that you don’t know what organization our Dark Shadow is.”

The man saw that Lin Xiu didn’t have any reaction when he heard the mention of ‘Dark Shadow’, so he said coldly.

He waved his hand at this time and the men in black uniforms around him immediately gathered and rushed towards Lin Xiu.

It seemed that they were about to reach out and push Lin Xiu to the ground.

“Wearing a mask and trying to deceive people huh.”

Seeing that Lin Xiu was still standing there without any reaction, he couldn’t help saying coldly.

Just when he thought that his subordinates would deal with Lin Xiu, a shocking scene appeared.

Those warriors who besieged Lin Xiu were all blown away!

Boom—

All of these warriors fell to the ground, wailing endlessly.

This… what’s going on here!?

This oily man opened his eyes wide and his face was in disbelief.

He didn’t see clearly what was going on at all. All of his subordinates were sent flying out.

“Is this the so-called ‘Dark Shadow’ power?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Because he was wearing a mask, this man couldn’t tell Lin Xiu’s appearance or expression.

But because of this, he felt that Lin Xiu was mysterious.

“Boy, are you really going to fight against us Dark Shadow?”

Although the man was startled, at this time, he still stared at Lin Xiu and said stubbornly.

“Take me to your Dark Shadow headquarters.”

Lin Xiu walked in front of him, stopped, then said.

“you…”

The man opened his eyes wide, he thought Lin Xiu was afraid or something.

Unexpectedly, Lin Xiu actually asked to go to the Dark Shadow headquarters! Isn’t that courting death!”

“Walk.”

Lin Xiu directly grabbed his collar and lifted him like a chicken.

The headquarters of Dark Shadow is in the slums of Wildfire City.

The people who live the so-called slums were not so-called poor people.

It’s just that the area looks dirty, so it got the name.

Dark Shadow, like a mouse, inhabits that area
