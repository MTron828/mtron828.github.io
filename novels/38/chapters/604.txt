Chapter 605: Snatch Match

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“In order to save time, each college now sends a representative to conduct a snatch match.”

The staff member glanced at the crowd at this time, and then said aloud.

“Snatch match?”

“That’s right, put your entry card on your chest with a pin, and then proceed to snatch someone else’s.”

“The ranking is based on the number of competition cards snatched. The top 15 will advance directly, and the rest will be eliminated.”

“If your own entry card is robbed, you will be eliminated directly.”

Only fifteen teams can advance?

Hearing this, the faces of all the warriors changed drastically.

As there were already dozens of academy teams here, this was to filter out the vast majority of teams.

“Now I’ll give you half an hour to discuss on the representatives, and then come here to wear a special pin and entry card.” As soon as the staff finished speaking, all the surrounding warriors began to discuss.

“Damn, this warrior competition is really troublesome.”

Ouyang Hang said a little angrily at this time.

“Among the other academies, I found that at least five or six academies who are pretty strong, they have rank 7 warriors.”

Huang Zhen pondered for a while, then said aloud.

“And I can see that they seem to be targeting us. If it is a single snatch match, I feel that they will jointly snatch our cards first.”

“It’s a bit troublesome...”

At this time, Qian Yao also frowned slightly. If multiple people attacked together, it was very likely that they would be robbed of their entry cards. According to the rules, if their entry cards were robbed, they would be eliminated directly.

“These guys.”

Ouyang Hang snorted coldly. He had clearly seen it before that the other colleges seemed to be targeting the Sacred Region academy.

According to what Huang Zhen said, it was indeed a bit troublesome later.

If their entry card was robbed, they would fail immediately.

Those who are selected to participate in this snatch match were under a lot of pressure.

“Let me do it.”

Lin Xiu smiled at this time, and then said aloud.

“You?”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Ouyang Hang was startled.

“Don’t make us go back early.”

At this time, Ouyang Hang deliberately mocked Lin Xiu.

“If you go, we would really have to pack and quit.”

Lin Xiu spread his hands and said.

“You…”

Ouyang Hang’s eyes widened, looking a little frustrated.

“Well, Lin Xiu, get rid of them all.”

At this time, Baili Haoling looked at the warriors over there, and said aloud.

“You sure?”

Lin Xiu showed a thoughtful smile and said aloud.

“Well, it’s either you or me.” Baili Haoling nodded and said with a strange smile.

Half an hour passed quickly, and Lin Xiu was representing Sacred Region academy.

When they got to the front, they lined up to put their entry card with a special pin on their chest, and then started to move forward.

Behind the building on this side, there was a quite spacious forest in the back mountain.

“In one minute from now, you can walk into the forest to hide, and after one minute, you can officially snatch.”

“Before 12:00 noon, those who do not have their entry cards on themselves will be eliminated directly, and the rest will be ranked.”

“Those who haven’t come back here before twelve o’clock will be eliminated immediately.”

The staff member moved a chair from somewhere, then sat on it, glanced at everyone with a pair of sunglasses and said.

At this time, these dozens of warriors were all paying attention to each other.

Their eyes were full of vigilance.

This snatch match could be extremely crucial for them because a single person represented an entire academy team.

If you lose, the pressure was very high.

And looking carefully at this time, there were some warriors who looked at each other, and then they all looked over to Lin Xiu. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Because Lin Xiu was wearing the special battle suit of Sacred Region academy, it was very conspicuous at first glance, so those warriors could easily tell that Lin Xiu belonged to Sacred Region academy.

On the other hand, Lin Xiu still looked very relaxed, playing with the Dark Edge spear in his hand!

“Get ready... start!”

At this time, as the staff’s voice was heard, the faces of the surrounding warriors suddenly changed, and then they rushed into the forest at a very fast speed!

Within a minute, they all had to find a place that was beneficial to them and hide, and then snatch the opponent’s card!

But as those warriors rushed into the forest, only Lin Xiu was left standing lazily in place.

“Hey, running so fast?”

Lin Xiu stretched out at this time, and then said out loud as if talking to himself.

“Young man, when you go in, there probably wouldn’t be any good fruit to eat anymore.”

When the staff saw that Lin Xiu was still standing there, he couldn’t help laughing.

Because this minute of preparation time could already allow him to find a favorable opportunity in the forest, as soon as the latecomers come, they may be attacked.

So Lin Xiu was already in a very unfavorable state.

“In our region, we just need one team to advance.”

Lin Xiu looked at the staff member and said with a mysterious smile.

The staff member was stunned when he saw Lin Xiu being so indifferent.

“See you in half an hour.”

Lin Xiu waved at him, then walked directly into the forest.

“This kid... he’s really cocky...”

The staff member came back to his senses at this time, and then shook his head.

Although Lin Xiu was full of confidence, to the staff, this was simply a joke.

If he entered now, he would be immediately robbed of the entry card, right?

At the same time, Lin Xiu had already walked in with his Dark Edge spear.

Looking around, he found that there were no other warriors around, and there was not even a sound – it was very quiet.

It seemed that after these warriors entered the forest, they all found a place to hide to make a sneak attack.

After all, in this situation, no one dared to run out directly.

Lin Xiu walked into the forest while whistling.

He looked lazy and didn’t seem to care at all.

But just as Lin Xiu continued to walk forward, Lin Xiu, who had a good ear, clearly heard a small rustling sound.

Here comes the fish.

The corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched, and when he continued to walk forward with the Dark Edge spear as several black shadows suddenly jumped out from the surrounding jungle!

They seemed to have been waiting for a long time, just for Lin Xiu to appear!
