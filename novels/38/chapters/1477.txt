1478 Becoming a True God

Impossible!!!

At this time, a loud voice from the cloudy sky also began to spread.

His eyes were wide open, a large amount of red energy was continuously released and he rushed towards Lin Xiu!

But all these red energies were washed away by the white energy released by Lin Xiu at this moment.

Boom, boom, boom——

In the air, at this moment, loud sounds continuously erupted.

Tian Yin’s body was constantly getting bigger at this moment, turning into a giant in an instant.

At this time, the dark red energy he spewed out became even thicker.

But around Lin Xiu’s body, there was still a large amount of dense and incomparably white light covering it.

These gathered the pure energies of the four major planets did not allow the dark red energies get to Lin Xiu!

impossible!

Seeing that Lin Xiu stared at him as the dark red energy was about to hit him, his eyes widened and he stood up. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“die!!!”

Lin Xiu roared in his heart and the black spear in his hand pierced through his body in an instant!

Boom——

In an instant, a huge hole appeared in his chest!

Lin Xiu’s figure also appeared behind him.

At this time, Lin Xiu held the black spear tightly with both hands and a large amount of white energy gathered towards the spear.

go!!!

As Lin Xiu swiped the black spear in both hands again, the large amount of white light absorbed by Lin Xiu directly charged toward Tian Yin’s huge body!

“Go to hell!!!”

Tian Yin turned around to look at this scene and immediately let out a roar.

With a wave of both hands, a large amount of dark red energy blocked his front.

No!!!

Tian Yin’s eyes widened and he roared crazily in his heart.

Boom——

At the next moment, those white energies had already covered his whole body!

“No…”

Tian Yin roared loudly at this time.

But at this moment, his body had already begun to be annihilated by a large amount of white energy at a speed visible to the naked eye.

With the death of Tianyin, those dark red energies disappeared instantly at this moment.

The cracks in the surrounding space were still there and the entire space seems to have become very unstable.

The whole earth was shaking violently as if it is about to explode.

“good.”

At this moment, a voice rang in Lin Xiu’s mind.

Who is it?!

When Lin Xiu heard this voice, he became extremely vigilant.

Soon, Lin Xiu could clearly see the dazzling white light released from his body.

Soon, the released white light began to slowly gather into a figure.

“Who are you…”

Lin Xiu looked at this figure full of white light, his eyes were full of surprise.

“True God!”

At this time, the phantom of Zhu Long also appeared at this time.

It seems very excited.

“True God…!?”

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

Is this old man the so-called true god?

“Tianyin has been wiped out by you and this game is over.”

The old man smiled and said at this time.

“It’s all a game?”

Lin Xiu suddenly said in a panic.

The old man was startled, then laughed out loud.

“No, it’s not.”

“It’s just that for me, choosing you is a small game for me.”

“I didn’t expect you to grow up to this point. It’s a bit beyond my expectations.”

“Now, you can enjoy everything you should have.”

“From today onwards, you are the True God of this universe.”

The old man said.

At this time, he pointed with his right hand and tapped lightly in front of Lin Xiu’s forehead and there was a ripple of water immediately.

A large amount of white light around, at this moment, all converged into Lin Xiu’s body.

The source strength that could not be completely absorbed into the body just now has completely entered Lin Xiu’s body!

At this moment, a special golden pattern appeared on Lin Xiu’s forehead.

At this time, Lin Xiu carefully felt his current body. It seemed that everything… had become different!

The whole body was filled with a very comfortable feeling!

It seems that they have some kind of ability to control the entire area, no, even the large-scale cosmic space!

With a thought, all the space cracks in the surrounding would instantly return to their original state.

“Okay, it’s almost time, I should leave.”

The old man said with a smile at this time.

“My lord, where are you going?”

Zhu Long asked.

“I’m done being a god. I want to re-experience a new life.”

He said with a smile.

In the next moment, his body turned into white particles, then slowly disappeared.

“True God…”

Seeing this scene, Zhulong was stunned for a moment.

That’s it, disappeared…

Lin Xiu was also a little dazed.

Looking at the dilapidated earth, Lin Xiu had a thought at this moment and stretched out his right hand.

‘Time control’!

As Lin Xiu used this skill, at this moment, the earth, which was shaking violently and seemed about to explode, also began to stabilize.

Soon, all kinds of things on the earth began to recover slowly.

“Use this time-reversing power on the entire planet!?”

Everyone in the God warrior Realm was originally ecstatic about killing Tian Yin.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s actions at this time, they were all shocked.

“He seems to…be the new true god.”

The God King Tianling also muttered to himself at this time.

Indeed, the power that Lin Xiu displayed now was beyond what even the mighty God Kings could achieve!

Quickly, as the power released by Lin Xiu enveloped the entire Earth, everything on the planet began to recover at a visible speed to the naked eye.

Time flowed backward, restoring the Earth to its state before the destruction!

Those severed limbs, damaged buildings, and shattered lands, all returned to their previous state!

“I… seem to be dead?”

Those people on Earth at this time were all in astonishment.

Time recovered, but some memories seemed to still remain in these people’s minds.

“Look! Is that a rank 9 warrior in the sky?”

At this time, everyone above Sky City raised their eyes and looked into the sky.

They saw a man full of white light.

It’s as if the True God has descended.
