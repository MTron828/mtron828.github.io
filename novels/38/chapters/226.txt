Chapter 227: I Won!

At this time, a huge pit had appeared in the middle.

In the thick smoke, Lin Xiu laid motionless in the middle.

He seemed unconscious.

But even though Lin Xiu could not move his body or open his eyes at this time, he still had intuition.

Just now, Lin Xiu had immediately activated the unlocking of the rank 2 gene lock without hesitation!

As the gene lock was unlocking, Lin Xiu felt a sharp pain throughout his body. This pain was even more intense than being hit by Zhuo Qixing’s skill.

It felt as if every part of his body was pricked by needles!

When he unlocked the gene lock for the first time previously, Lin Xiu felt exceptional pain. This time, it was so painful that he wanted to kill himself.

And Lin Xiu knew that in the process of unlocking the gene lock, there was a chance of dying!

Although the pain drove people crazy, Lin Xiu still kept himself awake.

The cells in the flesh and blood in every part of the body seemed to be dividing and changing.

Under the influence of the system, this process became very fast and the pain Lin Xiu felt was also doubled.

Now Lin Xiu’s bones started to make crackling sounds like when one is frying beans.

His body was constantly changing and evolving!

“Hng! He should be dead, right?” Tian Zixia was also shocked by Zhuo Qixing’s move. This time, Lin Xiu was certainly dead.

With that thought, she sneered.

The students of the Sacred Region Academy held their breaths and watched the scene.

As the smoke cleared up, they could see that a huge pit had been blasted out of the ground!

And in the pit, they could see Lin Xiu’s body lying there.

The uniform on him was dirty and there was still a lot of blood on his face as blood came out from the corners of his mouth. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“Hahaha! I won!” Zhuo Qixing couldn’t help laughing when he saw this scene.

There was still blood flowing out of his shoulders from Lin Xiu’s attack.

But he seemed to have forgotten the pain as he looked at Lin Xiu and laughed wildly.

“Lin Xiu!!!” At this time, the people from Class 10 of the South Campus were shocked.

Lin Xiu really died just like that!?

“Don’t go there!” Seeing Zhang Yin and the others trying to rush over there, Luo Yue immediately blocked them.

“Lin Xiu is dying!” Zhang Yin said emotionally when he saw Luo Yue blocking their way.

Now that Lin Xiu is in this situation, he looked like he’s dead, right??

With that thought, they became even more anxious.

“He’s not dead.” Luo Yue said as she looked straight at them.

Lin Xiu’s current state was very strange, but Luo Yue could clearly sense that there was still aura in his body.

And this aura seemed to be getting stronger and stronger.

Even she found this unbelievable.

Thud thud——

Lin Xiu’s body seemed to be pulsating and the muscles on his body were throbbing constantly.

At this time, Zhang Yin and the others looked over there and saw this mysterious and weird scene, they were surprised.

“I won, right?” Zhuo Qixing didn’t seem to notice this. He turned around and looked at the high platform on the other side, then said aloud to Dean Baili.

At the same time, Lin Xiu felt that the intense pain from the beginning had slowly dissipated.

99.1%…99.2%…

Although Lin Xiu couldn’t move now, he could still enter the stats board in his mind. At this time, after a closer look, Lin Xiu could see that there was a progress bar in the corner of the system page.

This was the progress bar for unlocking the gene lock!

This time, the speed of unlocking the gene lock seemed to have become faster than before and he wasn’t sure if it had to do with his increase in level.

As the progress approached 100%, Lin Xiu felt that the pain had disappeared completely and he felt a sense of comfort instead.

The pores all over his body seem to be opened and his whole body was so relaxed that he trembled in pleasure.

Every cell in his body seemed to have undergone a certain qualitative change and the bones and even the organs in the body had become stronger.

“No, you haven’t defeated him yet.” Dean Baili heard Zhuo Qixing’s words, touched his beard at this time and said with a smile.

Haven’t defeated him!?

Zhuo Qixing frowned. At this moment, he had a strange feeling.

A strong aura appeared behind him.

impossible?!

He was shocked and his eyes widened. When he turned around, he saw a figure, who was staggering and trying to stand up.

“You’re not dead!?” The pupil in Zhuo Qixing’s eyes constricted suddenly.

Lin Xiu seemed to have died just now!?

He wiped the blood from his lips and slowly stood up.

The students of the Sacred Region Academy were in shock.

After suffering such a powerful blow, Lin Xiu seemed fine and stood up again.

Lin Xiu twisted his body and instantly let out a series of bone-cracking sounds.

Lin Xiu was very comfortable and felt like he was given a new life!

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master on successfully unlocking the rank 2 gene lock!”

There was a sound in his mind. Lin Xiu felt as if every place in his body was full of power!

Lin Xiu clenched his hands into fists and could feel the strength in his hands.

“What kind of monster is he…” Ouyang Hang was stunned when he saw this scene.

How… how could Lin Xiu still stand up?

Lin Xiu, who was obviously injured at this time, seemed to have become stronger!

“Phew”

Lin Xiu breathed out, then stared at Zhuo Qixing with piercing eyes and said, “Now, it’s my turn!”

As soon as Lin Xiu spoke, he rushed to the front!

Zhuo Qixing was shocked and his expression turned sinister.

“Putting up an act, huh. Watch out for my ‘Black Dragon Blast Fist’!” Zhuo Qixing screamed and charged directly at Lin Xiu who was rushing over!

He suppressed and hid a large amount of source strength in his body through the ‘Hidden Origin Art’. It could be said that Zhuo Qixing’s body now had the source power equivalent to two peak rank 5 warriors.

So now he could cast this terrifying ‘Black Dragon Blast Fist’ again!!!

Just like before, as his skill was released, a large amount of black energy appeared in his hand at this moment and a black dragon seemed to hover over his arm!

“‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’!!!” Lin Xiu snorted coldly, watching the punch that had just knocked him down, he didn’t have any fear and he directly attacked with a punch!

On Lin Xiu’s fist, a lot of lightning had already appeared at this time.

His whole fist seems to be covered in electricity.

There were bursts of thunder and the surrounding air had a scorching smell.

As Lin Xiu’s skill attacked, there seemed to be explosions!

Boom——

The fists of the two people collided in the next moment!

The black dragon on Zhuo Qixing’s fist directly ate Lin Xiu’s fist and wrapped around it.

But in the next moment, the lightning on Lin Xiu’s fist directly penetrated the body of the black dragon.

The source strength of the two had a violent collision at this time.

There was a violent wind around them!

“What a terrifying skill…” Seeing this scene, the students of the Sacred Region Academy were flabbergasted.

Tian Zixia and the others’ faces turned nasty.

As they clearly felt that Lin Xiu’s strength had improved again!

It has improved a lot!

The immense power of this punch made Lin Xiu and Zhuo Qixing take a few steps back.

“Hmph!” Lin Xiu snorted coldly and before Zhuo Qixing could react, he rushed towards him again!

‘Without a Trace’! ! !

Lin Xiu felt that his whole body was full of power after unlocking the rank 2 gene lock, although he couldn’t see any drastic improvement on the stats board.

But his whole body had undergone a qualitative change!

H still looked like a human but the cells in his body had already gone through some kind of evolution!

His speed was extremely fast!

Looking at Lin Xiu rushing over, Zhuo Qixing was startled.

At the next moment, Lin Xiu attacked with a kick which brought about a gust of wind.

Gold skill- ‘Divine Wind Kick’!

The moment Zhuo Qixing blocked his front with his hands, he felt tremendous power coming.

Lin Xiu’s leg seemed to be surrounded by terrifying winds. As soon as he blocked the attack, the skin of his arms was cut open by those winds.

Droplets of blood dripped from his hands.

“‘Divine Steel Palm’!!!” After Zhuo Qixing blocked Lin Xiu’s ‘Divine Wind Kick’, he didn’t care about anything else and his right palm slammed over!

When he slammed Lin Xiu’s body with the palm of his right hand, that terrifying source strength instantly transformed into a huge palm that was so big it looked like it could cover a whole person.

Lin Xiu didn’t dodge at all when he saw this, there was still a large amount of electricity surging through his fist and he waved it again to attack!

Boom——

Due to the impact of the skill, there was a deafening noise again.

But this time, Lin Xiu was not shaken off, instead, Zhuo Qixing’s body was sent flying!

Boom–

His body fell heavily on the ground and rolled on the ground as a mouthful of blood spurted out of his mouth!

“Impossible! Impossible! You’re rubbish, how could you hurt me!!!” Zhuo Qixing laughed wildly at this time, his hair was messy and he looked like a lunatic.

At this time, the source strength in his body had completely burst out and he moved his leg and attacked Lin Xiu with his fist!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted. Zhuo Qixing has exhausted all his strength. As long as he was careful and blocked off his last offensive, Zhuo Qixing would definitely lose.

But Lin Xiu didn’t want to defend, so he didn’t hesitate to throw his fist directly at Zhuo Qixing!

Bang bang bang——

At this time, the speed of the two people seemed to have reached their extremes, like two phantoms as they continued to fight in the field.

Lin Xiu’s fist hit Zhuo Qixing’s body directly, every punch hitting the flesh!

And there was still a lot of electricity on the fist. As the fist hits Zhuo Qixing’s body, his body was also covered in a lot of electricity.

Zhuo Qixing had undergone electric shock resistance training so his body wasn’t afraid of lightning to a certain extent, but at this time, Lin Xiu was pounding against Zhuo Qixing’s body frantically with his fist covered in electricity so Zhuo Qixing still felt intense pain.

At first, Zhuo Qixing was still able to fight Lin Xiu and they seemed to be on par. But after some time, he slowly felt that his body was paralyzed by the electricity.

“Goodbye!!!” Lin Xiu also noticed this change. In the next moment, a large amount of source strength rushed to his fist and the current on his fist had reached the extreme at this time!

Crackling——

The electricity emitted a dazzling light.

Zhuo Qixing’s reaction ability had become very slow now, Lin Xiu threw out this punch, right in the center of Zhuo Qixing’s body!

Boom–

With a dull sound, Zhuo Qixing was completely covered by electricity and he flew out like a kite with a broken string!

He hit a huge stone pillar in the distance.

Then fell to the ground and couldn’t move anymore.

“I won.” Lin Xiu stood there, his gaze swept across the students of the Sacred Region Academy around him and said faintly.

“Zhuo Qixing… lost…?” The people around were completely shocked at this time.

Zhuo Qixing saw that he was about to win but didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would stand up suddenly and seemed to have become even stronger!

He even defeated Zhuo Qixing, the top student in Class 1 of the South Campus!

“Hurry up! Hurry up and call the medic!” The teacher of Class 1 became extremely gloomy when he saw this scene. He never expected that Lin Xiu would win this battle!

Zhuo Qixing’s family background was not simple and now he could only get medics to treat Zhuo Qixing quickly.

“Haha, as expected, heroes are cultivated from childhood.” At this time, Dean Baili leaped gently from the high platform over there and jumped down directly.

Dean Baili was also very curious at this time – what happened with Lin Xiu just now that his strength became much stronger?

“But how did you do it just now? I’m curious.”

Hearing Dean Baili’s words, the teacher of Class 1 who had a gloomy face suddenly rushed up at this time, and said aloud, “I suspect that he has taken a forbidden drug!”
