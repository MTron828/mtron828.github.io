1314 Ning Yu!

“The strength is not bad…”

From the corner of Lin Xiu’s eyes, he looked at the man. His analytic eye was activated and after a casual glance, he was able to see the man’s attributes.

Whether it’s strength or speed, they were all above him, but in terms of physique, it was not as good as Lin Xiu.

“Longyi City, Xiao Qingchen!”

At this time, as the host’s voice came again, another man stood up.

Now it seems that the contestants are being introduced at the beginning.

“Lingxian City, Lin Xiu!”

Soon, Lin Xiu also heard him call out his name.

At this time, he didn’t hesitate at all, just like those warriors, he stood forward.

Compared to the loud cheers of other warriors, Lin Xiu’s was much quieter.

“City Lord! Come on!”

On the contrary, Lei Tong seemed very excited.

“Tsk tsk, I never thought that there would be a warrior of this strength in this small Lingxian city.”

“He’s very lucky to be able to reach the final.”

“Haha, the next battle may not be that easy. I think he should be the first to go out.”

“…”

At this time, the surrounding audience was also discussing enthusiastically.

Hearing their words, Baili Haoling frowned.

Then she said out loud as if talking to herself, “You idiots will realize how stupid you are…”

“This year’s Multi-city competition, because of the competition system, is far more difficult to advance than the previous one.”

“So according to the intention of the god king, the thirteen successful promotions will be awarded the title of Noble god.”

As soon as he finished speaking, there was another burst of warm applause from around.

There was incomparable envy in the eyes of the audience.

“It’s just a title. There’s nothing to envy.”

When Baili Haoling saw this scene, she couldn’t help curling her lips.

“Little sister, you are wrong about that.”

At this moment, a middle-aged man sitting on the left of Baili Haoling stroked his beard and said with a smile.

“As a noble god, not only will you be able to go to the City of God freely, but you will also be able to go to the Energy Hall to practice.”

Speaking of this, there was a look of envy in his eyes.

Originally, Baili Haoling was very displeased with his phrase “little sister”, but when she heard the so-called “energy hall”, she immediately became interested.

“What is the Energy hajj?”

Baili Haoling said curiously.

“You don’t even know this?”

The middle-aged man looked at Baili Haoling suspiciously at this time, then said proudly, “Oh right, you little kids, it’s normal if you don’t know.”

When Baili Haoling heard his words, she immediately sneered.

But because there was something she wanted to know, Baili Haoling’s expression did not change.

“Do you know about energy stones?”

“certainly.”

Baili Haoling nodded slightly.

The currency of this world was energy stones.

Energy stones were equivalent to money.

“Ordinary energy stones have too many impurities and can only be used for energy supply of buildings and various machines. However, it is very difficult for warriors to absorb the energy inside. After all, while absorbing the energy inside, they must also remove the impurities, far slower than absorbing the energy of the odd crystal.”

The middle-aged man spoke eloquently at this time.

“The energy hall is used to remove impurities from energy stones, then allow for warriors to use?”

Baili Haoling thought about it for a while, then said aloud.

When the middle-aged man heard Baili Haoling’s words, surprise appeared in his eyes: “You guessed it right.”

“All the energy stones in the Energy Hall have undergone special processing to remove impurities.”

“And the price-performance ratio is much higher than directly using odd crystals for cultivation. After all, odd crystals are not cheap.”

Baili Haoling nodded slightly.

Speaking of which, she wanted to go in and practice a bit.

“The match is about to start. This little city lord of Lingxian City is fighting against Ning Yu from the Ning family.”

“Although this Ning Yu is now the city lord of a small city, he is a member of the Ning family in City of God after all. He had very rich cultivation resources back then, so his strength is also very strong.”

“Lingxian City… I haven’t heard this name for many years, tsk tsk.”

When the middle-aged man said this, he couldn’t help shaking his head.

It seems that in his opinion, the city lord of Lingxian City will undoubtedly lose.

“You’ll find out after watching.”

Baili Haoling said calmly at this time.

At this time, apart from Ning Yu and Lin Xiu, the rest of the warriors on the platform had already left the platform and walked towards the resting seats.

“Okay, next, our first match is about to start!!!”

The host, suspended in the air, shouted loudly.

The thousands of spectators around them seemed to be excited at this moment, bursting into deafening cheers.

“In this battle, life and death on the stage don’t matter. Unless one side admits defeat or dies, the game will be considered over.”

“Lin Xiu of Lingxian City, against Ning Yu of Ningfu City!!!”

At this time, Lin Xiu and Ning Yu were standing on the edge of the battle platform.

“Tsk tsk, I didn’t expect that there would be a warrior with good strength in the small Lingxian City.”

...

Ning Yu looked at Lin Xiu at this moment and said with a mocking expression.

“It’s a pity that my uncle hasn’t dealt with you yet. I wanted to preserve my strength for the next battle.”

Ning Yu’s tone was full of confidence, as if he was sure of himself and could deal with Lin Xiu.

“I guess you have no chance.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly and said lightly.

As soon as the words fell, Lin Xiu held the White Moon spear in his hand and rushed over first!

“Courting death.” Seeing that Lin Xiu dared to take the initiative to attack him, Ning Yu’s expression changed slightly and he shouted coldly, holding the sword in his hand and rushed out too!

Whoosh—

Both of them were very fast. Like two shadows, they collided with each other in an instant.

The weapons held by the two collided at the same time, making a loud noise.

Dangdangdang——

The speed of the two of them was really too fast. Some of the weaker fighters in the auditorium could only see the two shadows colliding crazily and bursting out many sparks.

“This kid is not bad ah.”

“To be able to go back and forth with Ning Yu, maybe there is a chance to win.”

The middle-aged uncle who was next to Baili Haoling just now, watching the battle on the battle platform, couldn’t help but said with a smile.

Although he said so, his tone of voice was still not optimistic about Lin Xiu.

“He will definitely win.”
