Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Boom –

He raised his hand and punched Lin Xiu’s body again!

Huangfu Bai’s fist was covered with golden light and the speed of this punch was extremely fast.

Lin Xiu didn’t have any defenses at all and was directly hit in the chest by this punch!

pfft—

A mouthful of blood was spat out at this moment.

But Huangfu Bai, without stopping his movements at all, continued to attack Lin Xiu frantically.

His attack was too violent and the speed was extremely fast.

Lin Xiu didn’t seem to have any strength to fight back.

“Go to hell!!!”

Huangfu Bai continued to punch Lin Xiu’s body wildly at the same time while golden power gathered around his left fist.

It hit Lin Xiu’s body again!

boom–

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s body exploded into countless pieces!

“No!”

Just when Huangfu Bai thought that he had killed Lin Xiu, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

His eyes looked directly to the other side.

In the distant sky, Lin Xiu was panting.

That’s right, Lin Xiu just used the system skill – ‘Mirror Image’.

“Damn old man…”

Lin Xiu wiped the blood from his mouth, feeling that his body was in great pain now.

If it wasn’t for the remodeling of his body and various powerful exercises, plus the protection of the ‘Holy Light Battle Suit, he would have killed him just now.

Is his current power the warrior god power?

Lin Xiu felt that right now, he didn’t have any power to fight back!

“Boy! Give me your life!”

And at this moment, the figure of Huangfu Bai appeared in front of Lin Xiu again!

swoosh—

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate in the slightest and used his body technique directly.

‘Flashing Souls’ This holy-level movement technique was indeed very powerful.

Even in the face of the current Huangfu Bai, he could dodge his attacks!

Huangfu Bai’s attacks were dodged by Lin Xiu several times in a row and he suddenly became a little annoyed!

“I let you dodge!”

He roared and in the next moment, the golden source energy on his body erupted again.

These golden source powers spread out instantly.

Wrap up the surrounding area!

Lin Xiu was at the edge of the golden area and as soon as he touched it, a tingling sensation struck instantly.

“Where are you going to hide!”

At the same time, Huangfu Bai continued to attack.

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank, he used the ‘Reset’ skill, then immediately used the ‘Fury’ skill.

Dang–

The Dark Edge spear held in both hands directly resisted Huangfu Bai’s attack.

Moreover, while resisting Huangfu Bai’s attacks, Lin Xiu used his hands to directly send Huangfu Bai flying!

The look in Huangfu Bai’s eyes also changed suddenly.

Because he clearly felt that Lin Xiu’s strength suddenly increased exponentially!

And at this moment, a dark blue flaming bird rushed over, directly hitting Huangfu Bai’s body.

‘Heavenly Array’!

Lin Xiu looked at Huangfu Bai, who was surrounded by the flaming bird, and continued to use the system skills.

Now Huangfu Bai is extremely terrifying in terms of attack power, speed and defense power.

If Lin Xiu didn’t take him seriously, there was absolutely no chance of winning.

At this time, with the support of his system skills, Lin Xiu’s power has reached an extremely terrifying level.

But facing Huangfu Bai, who possesses the power of God, Lin Xiu wasn’t very confident.

At this moment, both hands tightly held the Dark Edge spear.

“Little tricks!”

In the next moment, the flaming bird dissipated directly, revealing the figure of Huangfu Bai.

That scorching flaming bird didn’t cause any harm to Huangfu Bai!

“I just devoured the power of my god, I want to absorb all the power of your whole body!”

Huangfu Bai shouted with a grim face.

In the next moment, he waved his right hand in the air and a huge golden hand instantly appeared, slapping Lin Xiu’s body!

At this moment, Lin Xiu, there is no way to dodge.

Because the surrounding area was enveloped by those golden powers.

Damn it!

Lin Xiu roared angrily and collided with the golden hand with the Dark Edge spear in his hand!

Boom—

The collision rang loudly.

The power of this golden giant hand is too powerful, Lin Xiu struggled to hold the spear against the giant hand to press it down.

But at the next moment, the golden giant hand smashed directly into Lin Xiu’s body!

“How dare you use this little trick!”

This time, Huangfu Bai reacted quickly and raised his hand to attack Lin Xiu!

This punch hit Lin Xiu’s body again.

pfft—

A mouthful of blood spat out again.

“It’s useless, this is the power of the God Realm!”

Huangfu Bai looked at Lin Xiu trying to resist and laughed loudly.

Because Huangfu Bai is at the level of a Sage warrior, at this time, the power he possesses through ‘God Descend’ was also extremely powerful.

“You shall…become minced meat!!!”

At the next moment, he wanted to continue throwing his fists at Lin Xiu’s body, but Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared again!

“Still want to escape huh!”

He thought that what Lin Xiu used was the same as the ‘Mirror Clone’ just now.

But just when he released his thoughts and wanted to sense where Lin Xiu was, he found that Lin Xiu’s aura could not be felt at all!

This is impossible!

At this time, the expression in his eyes changed slightly and his eyes continued to scan the space surrounded by golden energy, but he did not find Lin Xiu!

This kid, escape!?

“Damn…”

At this time, Lin Xiu, who appeared in another part of the Sage warrior space, was holding the ground with his hands, panting.

There was blood flowing from the corners of his mouth.

There was severe pain in the whole body.

He had to admit that the current strength of this Huangfu Bai has become too terrifying.

But at the last moment, Lin Xiu used the space teleportation ring he had obtained to teleport away directly.

But because Lin Xiu was now in the Sage warrior space, although he teleported, he had to still remain in the Sage warrior space. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Now Lin Xiu was in a wilderness area.

Taking advantage of this time, Lin Xiu frantically activated the ‘Cultivation Technique’, constantly absorbing the surrounding source air.

Originally, the energy in the air in the Sage warrior space was very strong, so now Lin Xiu absorbed it very fast.

Soon, the injuries on Lin Xiu’s body were also being repaired at a speed visible to the naked eye.

At this moment, some golden rays of light came over from the front, covering the entire surrounding area!

Lin Xiu, who clearly felt all this, suddenly opened his eyes wide.

“Found it!”
