Chapter 974: The Meeting in the Divine Domain.

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Who did this?!!”

In one of the conference rooms of the Divine Domain, an old man threw a punch onto the table and instantly broke the table.

“Get the five elders here!”

The old man screamed at the crowd.

Soon, the five elders who were stationed all over the world teleported back to the Divine Domain.

“Huang Fuling and Huang Futian are dead.”

“Who is the one who’s trying to fight the Divine Domain?”

The old man looked at the five elders of the Divine Domain who had just arrived.

From his point of view, Huang Fuling and Huang Futian’s abilities were well beyond the others. They should be undefeatable.

Since the Tianjiao Competition has a selected age group.

“Could it be that there was a more powerful person who had disguised as a young man in order to join the competition and ended up killing them?”

One of them aside.

“This may be possible.”

The other elders nodded their heads as they agreed as well.

Although they have people scattered all over the planet, they still had lots of enemies.

“They have just sent us the recordings of what happened. Let’s take a look.”

One of the elders who sat at the back suggested.

If Lin Xiu was here, he would have noticed that one of the men here was Huang Fulin!

“Elder Lin, please play the recording.”

The old man nodded his head and was trying his best to suppress the anger inside him.

Huang Fulin nodded his head and played the recording from the min computer.

A bright light came from one end of the computer and projected it onto one of the walls opposite to it.

They could all see what had happened during the fight.

“It’s him?!”

Huang Fulin’s pupil shrank when he saw the recording.

This was because he could clearly see that the man that Huang Fuling and Huang Futian were fighting was the one that had disappeared after the fight that had severely injured him. It was Lin Xiu!

“Elder Lin, do you know him?”

The other elder turned towards Huang Fulin.

“Yes. He’s the one that I have been trying to hunt down after he took away the odd crystal of the beast saint.”

Huang Fulin looked embarrassed as he said that out loud.

There was a spot on his chest that still hurt until today.

Back then, when he was fighting Lin Xiu, his injuries from that match were still aching. He has not fully recovered yet.

“Huang Fulin, you are really getting old. You can’t even defeat this young man?”

One of the four elders looked at him and asked in a sarcastic tone.

“He got away with his dirty tricks.”

After hearing what he said, Huang Fulin’s face turned dark.

“Let’s just take a look to see how he killed Huang Fuling and Huang Futian.”

The old man interrupted them.

With the old man’s words, all of them kept their mouths shut.

Then, they continued with watching the recordings.

Soon, they watched the part where Huang Fuling and Huang Futian had used the ‘God Descend’.

“They couldn’t kill him with our ancestors’ help?”

Some of the elders have lost it when they saw what happened.

They didn’t think that Huang Fuling and Huang Futian had chosen to use this skill!

But, they died! This meant that the ‘God Descend’ had failed as well.

All of them had their eyes locked onto the projection.

As they finished the recordings, all of them looked extremely pissed.

Especially for Huang Fulin.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would grow to be so powerful after disappearing that day!

By using ‘God Descend’, the ancestors of the Divine Domain would descend into their body.

This meant that Huang Fuling and Huang Futian were sage warriors when they fought Lin Xiu.

However, they still couldn’t kill him.

Instead, all of the power that their ancestors had given to them during the fight have all been absorbed by Lin Xiu!

“Huang Fulin, you know this young man?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The old man was looking frustrated.

This was definitely a blow to the Divine Domain.

“I know a thing or two.”

Huang Fulin hesitated before nodding his head.

“Great. Bring some of them to the sage warrior space and kill him.”

The old man gave his commands.

“The sage warrior space….those people wouldn’t allow us in there.”

Huang Fulin was stunned and answered subconsciously.

“I will talk to them about this.”

The old man answered coldly.

“This brat has to die.”

His eyes were still locked onto Lin Xiu’s figure that was on the recording as he said in a vicious tone.

“We will be able to enter the sage warrior space tomorrow morning.”

On the other side, Wang Qiang spoke to Lin Xiu.

“En. I will be taking a break now. You should take a good rest too.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Yes, Master.”

As Wang Qiang left the room, Lin Xiu laid down on his bed.

This was a hotel that was near to the place where the competition was held.

The hotel was gorgeous and it had everything in it.

“It’s hitting me now…”

The aftermath of using ‘rage’ was finally hitting him and Lin Xiu felt fatigue.

He didn’t even want to move his fingers.

If anyone were to attack Lin Xiu now, he would be in grave danger.

But, after what he had shown in the competition today, would there still be anyone who would try to fight Lin Xiu?

After sleeping for the entire night, the next morning came.

Wang Qiang and Lin Xiu started walking to the destination that they were told.

They could see that there were already lots of warriors gathered at the same place.

There were about a hundred warriors that had gathered at the spot.

Amongst the hundred warriors here, most of them were respected warriors.

In order to get into the sage warrior space, most of the stronger, younger warriors were here today.

“You’re Lin Xiu?”

That’s when a group of warriors walked up to Lin Xiu.

The man who led the gang, looked at Lin Xiu before asking.

“Let me introduce myself, I am Ma Jin.”

“The best in the western part.”

He was arrogant and confident as he spoke to Lin Xiu.

“I heard that you were the one who brought the stage last night.”

The man looked at Lin Xiu as he continued speaking.

“But, from what I can see now, you aren’t as powerful as the rumors had told…”

“Could it possibly be that you aren’t as scary as you think?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

This man was trying to provoke him.

He was now a sage warrior but since he was using ‘disguise’, his strength now was indeed ordinary.

The warriors around him could only detect the amount of strength that he was willing to show.

“What does that mean?!”

Wang Qiang was unhappy with what Ma Jin had just said to them.

“Nothing. I just wanted to see if he is actually that great.”
