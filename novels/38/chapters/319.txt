Chapter 320: Luo Huatian’s Shocking Change!

As the man unfolded the ‘Sphere’, the flaming bird was completely blocked by it!

“Insignificant skill!” The man sneered. After dodging the flaming bird, the ‘Sphere’ around his body disappeared again then he wanted to continue to attack Lin Xiu with his own saber.

But he didn’t expect that at this moment, Lin Xiu was already holding the Dark Edge spear and aiming towards him!

The sharp tip of the spear was about to stab him in the neck.

Seeing this scene, the man’s expression changed and the saber in his hand slashed violently, hitting the Dark Edge spearhead.

And when Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear was hit, the saber was about to slash down from the top of Lin Xiu’s head!

“Go to hell!!!”

He roared and as he slashed down, Lin Xiu’s body was cut in half just like that! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Boy, you’re just a rank 5 warrior, how could you be a match for a rank 7 warrior!” He laughed and said to himself.

But his smile didn’t last long. In the next moment, his expression changed.

Bang–

With a dull sound, a spear penetrated his body from the back.

“Who said that you killed me?” Lin Xiu said with the Dark Edge spear in his hand and watched as the Dark Edge spear penetrated the warrior’s body.

“You…”

The man’s expression changed and when he looked down, the spear head of the Dark Edge spear had already appeared on his chest.

His eyes were filled with disbelief. This Dark Edge spear actually pierced through his battle suit!?

“Are you surprised? Just now, I dipped my spear into the lake water and didn’t expect it to have such an effect.” Lin Xiu seemed to know what he was thinking and said with a sneer.

Just now, Lin Xiu saw that the bodies of those warriors who died in the lake were annihilated.

So he knew that this lake water would be able to annihilate even this firm battle suit.

However, the Dark Edge spear was made of meteorites so the weird lake water did not have much impact on the spear body and because the spearhead was dipped in this weird lake water, it pierced though his battle suit easily before going through his body.

“Damn…!!!” The man yelled at this moment and wanted to struggle.

“Compared to other warriors, your IQ is simply too low.”

Lin Xiu sneered, the source strength on his body burst forth directly and the source strength that enveloped the Dark Edge spear turned into the Red lotus fire instantly!

“Ah!!!”

The man who was penetrated by the Dark Edge spear, let out an ear-piercing shriek due to the sudden appearance of the Red lotus fire.

Pu——

He wanted to pull out the spear, but at this moment, he spat out a mouthful of blood, his eyes widened and his whole body instantly weakened and there was no sound anymore.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief. This guy thought Lin Xiu was only a rank 5 warrior and he could be more careless. He didn’t expect that Lin Xiu had the ‘Mirror Image’ skill.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 7 warrior and gaining 200 million experience!”

Only 200 million experience…

Lin Xiu curled his lips. He had 300 million experience when he killed Zhou Wenhao.

At this time, Lin Xiu turned and saw that a warrior who was behind the warrior he killed was also dealt with by Luo Huatian!

Boom——

But at this moment, the warrior over there got enraged and used a powerful skill to attack Luo Huatian!

There was a loud noise came from the ground and it shook wildly.

A cloud of thick dust appeared on the ground instantly.

“That damned boy stopped us from getting the Ice lotus fire!” Some warriors sneered at this moment.

But as the thick dust slowly dissipated, Luo Huatian was still standing in the middle.

But he looked a little battered, his uniform was dirty and there was a huge pit under his feet.

“You guys seem pretty strong ah.”

Luo Huatian glanced at these people, then licked his lips and said aloud.

There was no fear in his eyes, but rather excitement.

Yes, it was like the excitement of seeing a prey.

Lin Xiu felt a chill down his spine at this time. This guy always felt like a very dangerous person…

No wonder Luo Yue warned him previously.

“Chap, you are not dead yet!?”

At this moment, the warriors were all shocked. They were rank 7 warriors and had worked together to release their skills. It was shocking that they did not kill Luo Huatian directly.

But what was even more shocking was that Luo Huatian didn’t seem injured.

“Lin Xiu, give me Luo Yue’s dagger.” Luo Huatian looked behind him and said to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was slightly startled, then tossed the dagger to him.

Luo Huatian caught the dagger, then stretched his neck.

“I haven’t felt this way for a long time…”

His eyes were full of excitement now and a strange sound echoed.

Click, click, click——

The bones in his body appeared to be changing!

Lin Xiu looked at him and saw that his body seemed to be slowly… getting taller!?

Lin Xiu was shocked by this astonishing scene, even those rank 7 warriors were dumbfounded.

“This guy… even knows this kind of thing…” Some warriors clearly felt something and their bodies trembled subconsciously.

Following those weird cracking sounds, Luo Huatian’s body grew from about 1.7 meters to 1.8 meters and his body became more muscular. Even his hair was growing longer, becoming a head of straight long hair.

He looked like a pretty-looking man.

“It’s been a long time since I appeared like this.” Luo Huatian stretched and said aloud.

Lin Xiu subconsciously activated the Analytic Eye on Luo Huatian at this time, but the Analytic Eye actually revealed a prompt that he could not be analyzed!

This guy is actually a warrior above rank 8!?
