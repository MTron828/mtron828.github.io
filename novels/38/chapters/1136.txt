1137 Goodbye Elder Ye

Lin Xiu rested for a while and took a deep breath.

With the triggering of the mind, this plant, again at a speed visible to the naked eye, slowly returned to its original state.

At the moment, his ability can only control the passage of time in this small area.

Control time forward and backward.

“It’s really tiring.”

Right after doing all this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but gasp for breath.

Although this ‘Time Control’ is a very powerful skill.

But it is really difficult to really grasp the time of an entire area.

“Forget it, let’s continue and see how it goes.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu said aloud like he was talking to himself.

In the next moment, Lin Xiu continued to walk forward.

This so-called Twilight of the gods looks really weird.

The surrounding sky is always bizarre.

There is a lot of strange light and there will never be night.

In this place, Lin Xiu couldn’t remember how many evolved beasts he killed.

Now Lin Xiu also understood why no one dared to set foot here.

Because there are too many evolved beasts of the beast saint level here and all of them are very powerful evolved beasts.

Several times before, Lin Xiu almost had his life in danger.

“Um?”

As he continued to walk forward, Lin Xiu’s eyes showed surprise.

Because here, you can clearly see that there are a lot of bones on the surrounding ground.

Not the skeleton of an evolved beast, but the skeleton of a human.

Moreover, these skeletons are also different from ordinary human skeletons.

These bones look like jade, which is very strange.

They also have battle uniforms on their bodies.

At a glance, you can tell that these battle uniforms are not ordinary.

Even if those people died and turned into skeletons, when Lin Xiu set foot here, he could still feel the powerful sense of deterrence emanating from their bodies.

“What a powerful force...”

When Lin Xiu walked forward at this time, he said aloud to himself.

The power of these warriors is really too powerful.

Even after they died, they were able to release such an amazing sense of deterrence.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath at this time and the source strength of his body was mobilized.

The source strength released at this moment formed a thin film that covered his body.

Because Lin Xiu felt that something was wrong.

For safety, he needed to cover his body with source strength.

Continuing to walk towards the front, Lin Xiu became more and more surprised.

There should have been a battle here.

And this battle was very earth-shattering. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Even though the surrounding ground was buried with a lot of sand, Lin Xiu could still vaguely see the traces left by the previous war.

“what is this...”

In the center over there, there is a huge energy barrier that blocks the direction over there.

Seeing the scene over there, Lin Xiu’s eyes showed an extremely surprised look.

Without thinking much, Lin Xiu walked straight ahead.

Walking in front of the energy barrier, Lin Xiu felt the powerful power attached to the energy barrier.

This energy is so strong that even Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

There seemed to be something on the other side of the energy barrier, but Lin Xiu couldn’t see it clearly.

Because this energy barrier is not transparent.

It looks blurry.

“Eh?”

And at this time, after a closer look, Lin Xiu also found that there were already some cracks on the energy barrier.

“What the hell is this place...”

Lin Xiu was even more surprised at this time.

Although he didn’t know what was going on, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that there was extremely powerful energy behind it.

Lin Xiu was a little hesitant at this time. Should he destroy this energy barrier and go inside to take a look?

Moreover, maybe he can absorb the energy inside and let himself directly enter the level of the God warrior!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu looked slightly excited.

hu—

After taking a deep breath, the source strength of the body converged on Lin Xiu’s fist.

Lin Xiu looked at this energy barrier and in the next moment, he was about to throw a punch at it!

boom–

But at this moment, Lin Xiu felt that his fist was being grabbed by someone!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly and he could clearly see the figure in front of him.

“Elder Ye?”

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide as he looked at the person in front of him.

The old man who appeared in front of Lin Xiu was the Elder Ye who was in the Sage warrior Space!

“You kid, you actually came here.”

Elder Ye looked at Lin Xiu and said lightly.

At this moment, he let go of Lin Xiu’s fist.

“Elder Ye, you’re here too?”

Lin Xiu said in surprise at this time.

He thought who it was just now, but he didn’t expect it to be Elder Ye.

“Of course I’m here.”

Elder Ye said indifferently.

“You want to destroy this thing?”

“Well, I want to see what’s behind this barrier.”

Lin Xiu said directly.

The energy fluctuation behind this barrier is really too strong. If it can be absorbed, it will indeed greatly improve one’s own strength.

Now Lin Xiu is eager to upgrade to level 70.

After all, when he reaches level 70, he will become a warrior of the God warrior level!

“It can’t be destroyed.”

Elder Ye shook his head at this time.

“What’s behind this?”

Lin Xiu was slightly startled, then continued to speak.

“Seal.”

Elder Ye said indifferently.

“Seal?”

Lin Xiu became more and more puzzled.

“As long as this seal is not broken, the god warrior cannot come to this world.”

Elder Ye glanced at Lin Xiu, then continued to speak.

“This...”

Lin Xiu was also shocked at this time.

It turned out to be the case, no wonder the god warriors had no way to come directly to this Namir planet.

It turned out to be caused by the seal here.

“But there seems to be a crack on it.”

Lin Xiu continued speaking.

This energy barrier already has a crack just now.

“Well, it was destroyed by people from the god warrior realm.”

Old Ye stood in front of the energy barrier, touched the cracks and said lightly.

Was it destroyed by people from the God warrior Realm?

The expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly.

Could it be done by someone from the Divine Domain?

After all, he has already defeated them thrice and absorbed their divine power.

For them, it was definitely a major blow.

“Your current strength is about to reach the level of a God warrior.”

Elder Ye glanced at Lin Xiu and said with a faint smile.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded and looked at Elder Ye with a look of surprise in his eyes.

How did he know?
