Chapter 899: Sage Warrior

??

“That’s right. This is the Imperial Order.”

Lin Xiu said flatly.

“Father, shouldn’t we...”

Zhao Lin was reminded of something before reminding his father.

Zhao Qi did not say much but gathered the energy inside his body.

Koong Loong – –

The energy from his body suddenly rushed towards the Imperial Order and there was a low noise that rang in the room.

The Imperial Order lit up with a bright light and the word ‘Ye’ was projected in the air.

“It’s real!”

Zhao Qi trembled as he saw what had happened.

Lin Xiu was a little shocked as well. He didn’t think that the Imperial Order had such power.

However, he looked towards them with his eyes narrowed.

“Will the Zhao family be interested in rebuilding the glory of the Ye family?”

Lin Xiu asked the rest of them in the room.

“We are willing to do whatever that is told!”

Zhao Qi and Zhao Lin looked at each other before bowing towards Lin Xiu.

“Great.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head with satisfaction.

“What is the situation here now on Nanor Planet?”

As he sat on the chair, Lin Xiu continued asking.

“Young Master, most of the northern region are under the control of the Bai family.”

Zhao Lin clicked onto one of the buttons on the table and the surface of it immediately turned into a screen.

There was a map of the planet displayed on the screen.

“Northern….that’s the busiest part of the planet?”

As he looked at the map, he asked the father-son duo.

From what was shown on the screen, there were still lots of danger zones on this planet.

Plus, in the entire planet, 70% of them were covered by the ocean.

There was only 30% of the planet that was land.

On these remaining land where the humans lived, most of them were gathered in the north.

There were also lots of strong warriors gathered in the north.

“The Bai family is now the strongest family on the entire planet. They are more than 5 sage warriors there.”

Zhao Lin continued speaking to Lin Xiu.

“Sage Warrior?!”

When Lin Xiu heard Zhao Lin, he was shocked as well.

Sage warriors were warriors stronger than the respected warriors.

It has been said that the power of a sage warrior was so strong that they could destroy more than just a city with one blow. They could also easily ruin the entire planet.

There were at least 5 of them that belonged to the Bai family.

As he thought about it, Lin Xiu’s face looked awful.

From the current situation, it would be quite impossible for him to get revenge for the elder.

“But…..Young Master, if you manage to cultivate the three deadly skills of the Ye family, it shouldn’t be hard to restore the glory of the Ye family.”

Zhao Qi turned quiet for a short while before continuing.

“Do you know what they are?”

Lin Xiu asked him in return.

” ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’, ‘Silence’ and ‘Time Control’.

Zhao Qi seemed to be very familiar with it as he said it without any hesitation.

“These skills are for sag warriors. If anyone gets to master any one of these three, they would be able to have the strength to destroy the planet.”

“However, legends say that these skills have extinct.”

With that said, Zhao Qi sighed.

Lin Xiu kept quiet as he had already mastered the first skill.

As for the other two, he had no idea what they were.

“Do you have any clues about these skills?”

Lin Xiu quickly asked.

“I’m not too sure.”

Zhao Qi shook his head.

It was true that he didn’t know. Lin Xiu had gotten the skill – ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’ was from the top floor of the Tower of Trials.

But with Lin Xiu’s identity now, Zhao Lin didn’t have the courage to ask Lin Xiu how he had gotten the skill.

“However, you can try looking for it in the Wildfire City. It is an underworld over there. They have the largest and stronger intelligence agency there. As long as you are able to pay for it, you will be able to get the intelligence that you require.”

Zhao Qi continued.

“Hmmmmmm...” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Wildfire City?

Lin Xiu suddenly thought of how there was another hidden ally of the Ye Family in that particular city.

His utmost priority now was to gather all the forces of the Ye family on the Nanor planet.

With his strength alone, he would not be able to defeat the Ye family.

“How long does it take to go to Wildfire City?”

Lin Xiu asked.

“If we use the teleportation device, we will be able to send you there right now.

“However, there seems to be some trouble and all of the teleportation devices have been destroyed. They are still trying to fix them.

“With a flying android, you should be able to reach there in two days.”

Zhao Qi calculated it before addressing it to Lin Xiu.

Two days?

Two days was nothing for Lin Xiu.

“How is the Zhao family doing now?”

Lin Xiu asked as he narrowed his eyes.

Zhao Qi was a smart man as well and he quickly understood what Lin Xiu wanted to know.

“There are about a hundred warriors kings and one thousand two hundred warrior masters.”

“Amongst the warrior kings, I am the only one at the peak.”

“From now onwards, start training them.”

Lin Xiu took a sip of the tea before giving his commands.

“You’re saying...”

“One year. Within one year, I want the entire Bai family to disappear from this planet.”

Lin Xiu said it with a monotonous tone but he was looking confident.

Zhao Lin and Zhao Qi were both shocked.

He was trying to ruin the Bai family...

The Bai family was the strongest family now and they had a huge troop. If they were to fight the Bai family now, they would be annihilated within seconds.

“Don’t worry. In one year’s time, I will be looking for allies as well.”

Lin Xiu seemed to be able to read their minds and he quickly comforted them.

“Yes. We will do as we are told.”

After a while, the huge doors were pushed opened once again and Zhao Yongyuan appeared before them.

“Elderly!”

When they saw that it was Zhao Yongyuan, Zhao Qi and Zhao Lin quickly greeted them.

After taking a showed and changing his clothes, Zhao Yongyuan even shaved his beard and he looked like a young man now.

Who would have thought that he was more than a hundred years old.

Zhao Yongyua nodded his head before he greeted Lin Xiu, “Young Master.”

“Yongyuan, stay here and train these men. I am going to leave for another country.”

Lin Xiu immediately told Zhao Yongyuan his plan.

“Young Master, you’re ready?”

Zhao Yongyuan’s eyes were glimmering with hope.
