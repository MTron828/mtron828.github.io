Chapter 417: Deep Hatred

“Nothing, I just want that body skill card back.” Ouyang Hang shook his head when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

He was right, he was indeed just trying to get back his body skill card.

This ‘Transient steps’ can’t fall into the hands of other people no matter what.

The Ouyang family was a very traditional family. If people in the family know that ‘Transient steps’ has fallen into Lin Xiu’s hands, he would be in big trouble!

He was likely to be expelled from the family!

Now Lin Xiu was about to become a rank 6 warrior and he had no way to get rid of Lin Xiu, he had no choice but to lower his head.

“It’s just that simple?” Lin Xiu looked at him and then said thoughtfully.

Ouyang Hang was startled and Lin Xiu’s eyes seemed to see him through so he said helplessly, “Well, there is actually one more thing.”

“I hope you can beat Yu Muchen.”

Ouyang Hang said, the expression on his face became extremely serious.

“You have enmity with that guy?” Lin Xiu was taken aback, and then subconsciously said out loud.

This guy actually wanted him to win? Lin Xiu almost wanted to ask him if he had taken the wrong medicine.

“Deep hatred.” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Ouyang Hang responded with his eyes full of murderous aura.

“If I get rid of him, doesn’t this mean that I am indirectly avenging you?” Lin Xiu shrugged at this time and said aloud. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I don’t need to say anything in the future, you will have to deal with him anyway.” Ouyang Hang seemed to think of something at this time, and then gave Lin Xiu a meaningful look.

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu frowned slightly. What did Ouyang Hang mean?

Logically speaking, he and the man could be said to have no grievances and no grudges.

“Okay, do you want to trade or not.” Ouyang Hang held the box containing the ‘With a Trace’ skill card, then looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

Lin Xiu looked at him with a smile and said, “Sure, but you need to do something for me.”

“What is it?” Ouyang Hang was startled when he heard Lin Xiu’s words, and then subconsciously said.

Lin Xiu whispered a few words in his ear at this time.

“No way! Impossible.” After hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Ouyang Hang kept shaking his head.

“Forget it then, you may leave now.” Lin Xiu said indifferently at this time.

“Fine!” Ouyang Hang snorted coldly. He was a noble son, when should he beg someone!

But when he reached the door, Lin Xiu sighed and mumbled to himself, “Oh, I’m about to reach rank 6, then I can try this Ouyang family’s ‘Transient steps’.”

“I wonder what will happen to people from the Ouyang family when they see me using this skill?”

Ouyang Hang originally wanted to leave directly when he heard Lin Xiu’s “mumbling to himself”, but at this moment, he suddenly stopped.

Then turned to Lin Xiu with gritted teeth and said, “Fine! Deal!”

“Very good.” Lin Xiu nodded in satisfaction, and then took out the ‘Transient steps’ skill card and exchanged it with him.

Ouyang Hang still felt a little pain when watching ‘Without a Trace’ being taken away by Lin Xiu.

But seeing the ‘Transient steps’ skill card finally returned to his hand, he was also relieved.

At this time, Ouyang Hang glared at Lin Xiu and then left without looking back.

“Remember what you promised.” Looking at his retreating back, Lin Xiu said suddenly.

Ouyang Hang, who was about to leave, heard Lin Xiu’s words, then staggered and almost fell down.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help laughing.

“But this time… no matter what, I still benefitted.”

Looking at this diamond skill card, Lin Xiu showed a satisfied smile.

“Squeak!” The little ice crystal white bird flew over at this time and stood on Lin Xiu’s shoulder, seemingly very happy.

Time passed quickly. In the following days, Lin Xiu played against other classes every afternoon. With Lin Xiu’s lead, Zhang Yin and the others cooperated better and better.

If they couldn’t win, Lin Xiu would resolve it straight away. They managed to maintain victory for all the battles from Class 2 to Class 9!

“Tomorrow is the last match, we’re going to fight Class One!” On this day, when Lin Xiu was in the training room, Zhang Yin and others said seriously to Lin Xiu.

Although their coordination was perfect, they weren’t the strongest. When dealing with Class 2 and Class 3, problems had already surfaced. Their coordination was useless and the gap in strength was very obvious. In the end, they relied on Lin Xiu to turn the tide and won.

But it wouldn’t be so easy to deal with Class 1 because there were already a dozen of rank 5 warriors in their class!

“And it was said that a warrior in Class 1 has reached rank 6.” Jiang Li said a little worriedly at this time.

“Well, in the next round, Leilei, you will rest first, and Luo Yue will go.” Lin Xiu nodded, and then said aloud.

“Yeah.” Lei Lei nodded when she heard Lin Xiu’s words, and didn’t say much. She also knew her strength clearly.

But Class 1 already has a rank 6 warrior ah… this was a little troublesome.

Bang bang bang——

At this moment, there was a knock on the door.

Li Xiaoniu and others heard this voice, looked over there subconsciously, and saw a man standing there.

At this time, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes couldn’t help but shrink.

Yu Muchen!

It turned out to be this guy!

“Oh? Seems like all of you are here.” Yu Muchen glanced at the people around him at this time, then walked in unceremoniously and stood in front of Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he looked at him, and then faintly said, “What’s the matter?”

“Let’s get to know each other – Yu Muchen.” Yu Muchen said while looking at Lin Xiu with a smile.

“Lin Xiu.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

“I know, top freshman.” Yu Muchen nodded, then glanced at the students in the surrounding Class 10 and said, “You may not know me, but it doesn’t matter. Soon, the entire Sacred Region Academy will know me.”

Arrogant! He’s so arrogant!

Zhang Yin and the others frowned upon hearing his words.

“You came here just to say these?” Lin Xiu continued.

“Of course, I’m just telling you that after you win the last game tomorrow, come and fight against our North Campus Class 1 the day after.”
