Chapter 1051: The Power of Rules

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu glanced at the corner of his eyes and said lightly, “Went to another world.”

Tang Qi was startled, then said in disbelief, “You killed Uncle Zhang!?”

“Impossible! You bastard, you can’t beat Uncle Zhang!”

At this time, he was in self-denial as he spoke.

Lin Xiu ignored him at this time.

Because at this time, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that his spatial source mark seemed to be restrained and he was unable to use it.

This was a special kind of power of rules.

But how is the power of rules formed?

Lin Xiu frowned, lost in thought.

Just as Lin Xiu was thinking about it, Tang Qi turned his attention to Ji Mei and the others.

“You three bitches, when my Tang Pavilion people comes, you are all dead.”

“I will get people to abolish you and turn you into slaves!!!”

His face was hideous and he looked very terrifying.

“Our Haoyue Sect will be afraid of your people from Tang Pavilion?”

Ji Mei’s face also turned cold at this time.

Looking at Tang Qi, there was undisguised killing intent in his eyes.

The two of them were instantly at each other’s throats.

But in this cell, it is impossible to fight.

The special design in this cell made it almost impossible for ordinary warriors to break out of the cell.

What’s more, if you escaped from prison, unless you don’t enter Baidi City for the rest of your life, you will be a wanted fugitive and you won’t even have the chance to enter the city gate.

Time passed quickly. In this cell, there was no food to eat. There was only one nutrient solution every day, which was enough to supplement the energy necessary for the body.

In the past few days, Ji Mei looked at Lin Xiu in front of her with curiosity in her eyes.

Lin Xiu didn’t struggle in this cell and he closed his eyes all day, as if he was cultivating or something.

Seeing this made her very curious.

“Ji Mei, where did he come from?”

Bingbing sat beside Ji Mei and looked at Lin Xiu, who was sitting on the opposite side with his eyes closed and said curiously.

Lin Xiu’s face looked angular and handsome.

And Lin Xiu had a special temperament.

“I am not sure as well.”

Ji Mei shook her head at this time.

“No way, don’t you know him?”

Lanlan also said curiously at this time.

Ji Mei smiled bitterly, she knew Lin Xiu only because she was in the ancient war zone.

At that time, she hadn’t thought that Lin Xiu would have such a powerful strength.

But what exactly was Lin Xiu doing now?

Looking at Lin Xiu sitting down with his eyes closed, Ji Mei rested on her chin to look at Lin Xiu opposite.

And seemed to be in a daze.

“The power of the rules should also be a power that the warriors use in the space where they are located that can run continuously with a specific trajectory.”

“It’s like programming, a program that is compiled in a special language and can run automatically.”

“And ‘rules’ are languages ??compiled with the power of warriors.”

In the past few days, Lin Xiu has been constantly studying this rule.

Lin Xiu seems to have some kind of insight.

This power of rules should be like domain force, but it was more advanced than domain force.

Domain force can be used within a certain range to bring strength or increase in various attributes, or have other special abilities.

But the rule was used to formulate a special restriction for the whole space.

This space could be inside a building, it could be a city, or… it could be the entire planet!

Soon, fifteen days passed.

The people from the City Lord Council opened the prison door and led Lin Xiu and the others out.

“Next time you fight in the city again and destroy buildings, it won’t be as simple as 15 days of detention.”

A warrior from the City Lord’ Council said coldly while letting Lin Xiu and the others go out.

And at this time, not far away, there was a group of warriors coming over here.

The uniforms on them looked almost identical to those of the warriors beside Tang Qi.

People from Tang Pavilion?

Seeing this scene, the expressions of Ji Mei and others changed slightly.

“Looks like my father has come to pick me up.”

Tang Qi’s eyes looked at the front and the corners of his mouth curled up.

“Lin Xiu, let’s go.”

Ji Mei also said aloud at this time.

Inside the Tang Pavilion, there are several warriors of the Sage warrior level.

This Tang Qi’s father, Tang Qing, was a warrior at the level of Sage warrior.

Moreover, he has been promoted to the Sage warrior for a long time and his strength is far stronger than the average Sage warrior.

Ji Mei didn’t want Lin Xiu to be involved in danger.

Because she always felt that this matter was caused by them and Lin Xiu was implicated. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“What’s the hurry, let’s see first, what is the strength of this Tang Pavilion’s people?”

Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

There was no panic look on his face at all.

“But…”

Near this dungeon is a barren area.

If they fought after leaving this place, the people from the City Lord Council will not care!

Because here, there will be no damage to the building.

And the location of the dungeon is here, it seems that the city owner of Baidi City deliberately arranged it like this.

“Father!”

At this time, Tang Qi watched his father, Tang Qing, bring everyone from Tang Pavilion over and said in surprise.

“Hmph, disappointing.”

Tang Qing walked over and slapped Tang Qi directly.

Snapped–

With a clear sound, a red mark appeared on Tang Qi’s cheek.

At this moment, Tang Qi forcibly held back the severe pain in his cheek and did not dare to say anything.

At this time, Tang Qing looked at the arms of the two warriors behind Tang Qi, which seemed to be broken and his brows frowned slightly.

“What happened here?”

“It’s him! This slut from the Haoyue Sect, teamed up with that guy to deal with our Tang Pavilion!”

At this time, Tang Qing stretched out his finger and pointed to Lin Xiu and others not far away and said aloud.

When he just came out, he didn’t dare to say anything.

At this time, seeing his father bring the people from Tang Pavilion over, Tang Qi suddenly seemed to have support and became extremely arrogant and domineering.

When Ji Mei heard that Tang Qi didn’t say anything about what he did, but instead directly scolded her and others, her face became cold.

“Also, there is Uncle Zhang, who seems to have died in his hands.”

Tang Qi pointed at Lin Xiu and said.

Although he didn’t see it with his own eyes, Lin Xiu fought with Uncle Zhang and in the end only Lin Xiu came back.

At this time, it was already certain that he was indeed dead.

“Is what you said true?”

At this time, Tang Qing’s face also became ugly.

Uncle Zhang was a warrior of the Sage warrior level, one of the few Sage warriors in the Tang Pavilion! He got killed just like that?
