Chapter 419: Warm-up Is Over!

Li Ping said subconsciously when he saw this scene.

Zhang Yin was also prepared, but he did not expect that the moment the guy rushed over, he disappeared!

“Where is he!?” Zhang Yin was stunned and he didn’t use his defensive tactics.

Bang–

But at the next moment, he seemed to feel something. Before he could turn his head, he felt a huge force on his back and he flew out!

With a dull sound, Zhang Yin was the first to fall off the platform.

“Zhang Yin!” When the people in Class 10 saw this scene, they all immediately surrounded him.

“I’m okay.” Zhang Yin, who was knocked off from the platform, shook his head, then looked up only to find that the man who had just knocked him down had already dealt with Li Ping and Jiang Li!

That’s how it is!

Zhang Yin came to his senses at this time. The technique of Class 1 of the South Campus was to let the strongest one deal with Lin Xiu, then the other three deal with Luo Yue, and the remaining one would deal with the remaining three.

Because Zhang Yin and Jiang Li are both rank 3 warriors and Li Ping was a rank 4 warrior, it was almost impossible for the three of them to deal with a rank 5 warrior.

Soon, as Zhang Yin was knocked down, Jiang Li and Li Ping, who were next to him, were knocked off the stage as well!

“Class 10 of the South Campus is definitely going to lose. Then as long as the girl is defeated, the five people can join hands to take down Lin Xiu.” Some students couldn’t help but say aloud when they saw this scene.

“After all, it is Class 1 of the South Campus. But Class 10 could beat the other eight classes, which is pretty good.”

“Looking forward to the battle with the North Campus tomorrow!”

At this time, the surrounding students were in an uproar, as if they believed that Class 10 of the South Campus was about to lose.

“Do you only know how to hide!!!” Zhu Jun frantically waved the saver in his hand and attacked Lin Xiu.

But what made him feel uncomfortable was that Lin Xiu didn’t fight him head-on at all, instead, he kept dodging.

Every one of his blows was perfectly blocked by Lin Xiu.

“‘Splitting Mountains’!!!” At the next moment, Zhu Jun seemed to be a little impatient and he shouted abruptly as the saber in his hands became fiery red as if there was a dark red flame on it. In the next moment, he waved towards Lin Xiu’s body!

“Zhu Jun is getting serious! Lin Xiu is definitely going to lose!” Some students in Class 1 saw this scene and said loudly.

“Hng! We still don’t know who’s going to lose!” Jiang Li’s expression became ugly at this time, then he looked at that side and said aloud.

“Hehe, do you really think your Class 10 can win?” Some members from Class 1 of the South Campus immediately confronted Jiang Li.

“Class 10 is Class 10 after all – is the earthworm trying to become a dragon!?”

Hearing the words of those people, Jiang Li and the others clenched their fists and seemed like they wanted to fight them.

“Go back to your seats.” Nan Zhengjun stood up at this time and said while looking at the angry students of Class 10. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“But…” Although Jiang Li had just been knocked off, his skin was thick and he was not harmed.

At this time, he was still a little angry when he heard the words of those people.

“I believe Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.” Nan Zhengjun looked at the platform and said lightly.

At the same time, Zhu Jun’s ‘Splitting Mountains’ was indeed very powerful and it caused a tremor on the platform.

The entire platform was constantly shaking as if there was a magnitude 10 earthquake.

But this platform was made of special materials. Although his skill was very powerful, it has not caused much impact.

“Warm-up is over.” At this moment, Lin Xiu, who dodged Zhu Jun’s skill, said to Zhu Jun, who looked extremely nasty.

Warm-up!?

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Zhu Jun was startled, then his face became even more ugly.

“Warm-up? Are you kidding me!” Zhu Jun shouted and continued attacking Lin Xiu with his weapon!

He felt like he was insulted and his expression became sinister.

He was fighting so seriously just now and Lin Xiu simply said that it was just a warm-up. How could this not make him angry?

“Here we go! Zhu Jun is going to be serious!” The people in Class 1 saw Zhu Jun burst out even faster at this time and became even more excited at this time.

“He is the one who is serious.” Ouyang Hang sat on the upper side, then said with a sneer.

If Lin Xiu was dealt with so easily, he wouldn’t have to have such a headache.

And at this moment, thinking about what Lin Xiu had promised before, Ouyang Hang had a headache.

If others found out about this, even if he was from Ouyang’s family, he would be finished!

Swish swish swish——

At this time, looking at Zhu Jun who was attacking, Lin Xiu became serious. The Dark Edge Spear danced quickly in Lin Xiu’s hand and directly attacked Zhu Jun who was rushing over!

‘He isn’t dodging!?’

At this time, seeing Lin Xiu didn’t dodge again, but instead attacked, Zhu Jun was shocked.

“Courting death!”

Zhu Jun yelled and the saber slashed towards Lin Xiu frantically!

Dang dang dang——

But this time, Lin Xiu didn’t use the spear body to block Zhu Jun’s attack, instead, he directly used the spearhead!

Lin Xiu held the spear firmly with both hands and attacked Zhu Jun frantically!

Bang——

And at this moment, as Lin Xiu waved his right hand, a flaming bird appeared in an instant!

Seeing this scene, the look in Zhu Jun’s eyes suddenly changed. He knew that this was one of the skills that Lin Xiu often used.

“Insignificant skill!!!” Although he panicked a little in his heart, at this moment, Zhu Jun still yelled, then swiftly avoided the attack.

But when he just dodged this flaming bird, in the next moment, another flaming bird rushed over!

How come there are more!?

The look on Zhu Jun’s face changed drastically and he wanted to continue to dodge.

And now because of these flaming birds, he couldn’t even see where Lin Xiu was at and his line of sight was blocked by the flaming birds!

“Damn it!” Zhu Jun cursed inwardly. He leaned slightly and wanted to dodge another flaming bird charging over.

“Goodbye.”

A familiar voice rang and the pupils in Zhu Jun’s eyes constricted suddenly. Holding the weapon with both hands, he instinctively attacked the back!
