“Why is it extraordinary?”

Lin Xiu said curiously at this time.

“This is made of star meteorite jade. When cultivating, it can improve the speed of cultivation, and it can also clear your mind. It is not an exaggeration to say that it is a treasure.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Baili Haoling spoke eloquently at this time.

“So awesome...?”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but be surprised when he heard Baili Haoling’s words.

Wearing the jade pendant, Lin Xiu did feel very comfortable, which was true.

“Of course, this thing can be regarded as priceless now, and its market value can be comparable to the rank 9 odd crystal.”

Baili Haoling nodded and said.

Hearing her words, Lin Xiu was even more surprised. At this time, he thought of Luo Yue,l and didn’t expect that she actually gave this jade pendant to him.

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu’s gaze became

gentler.

“Then... do you want to sell it to Master?”

After Baili Haoling finished explaining at this time, she said to Lin Xiu.

“I knew you had this thought.”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help laughing and scolding.

“Hehehe.”

Time went bt quickly and at noon the next day, when he came to the competition hall again, Lin Xiu realized that the damage he caused yesterday had been repaired.

He didn’t see any other warriors around. They were probably either lying in the hospital or returning to their academy.

After all, Lin Xiu fought with all of them yesterday and defeated them all. This was an absolute shame.

Now, who would dare to come here and find trouble?

“You guys are here already?”

Not long after Lin Xiu and the others came in, they could clearly see President Wu Tian appearing in front of them.

And there were several staff around him.

“En, can we go now?”

Lin Xiu walked over and said with a faint smile.

“Of course.”

President Wu Tian nodded, then took out a special card from his pocket.

“This is the entry card for the competition, and it is the pass to enter Sky City too.”

President Wu Tian took out these passes and handed them to Lin Xiu and the others.

Lin Xiu held the thin, but very hard card in his hand, and his eyes could not help narrowing.

Sky City, I’m finally coming.

“The airship is coming soon. It’s still a little distance from here to Sky City. You can rest in the lounge on the airship first. The next morning, the knockout rounds in our Huaxia region will officially start.”

President Wu Tian looked at Lin Xiu and the others and said.

“You kid eliminated all the teams in our division. Don’t let me down, or it would be too embarrassing.”

President Wu Tian couldn’t help sighing at this time.

“En.”

Lin Xiu smiled. Lin Xiu was not afraid of the contestants from other divisions. What he was a little worried about now was the strength of those teams in Sky City.

However, Lin Xiu wasn’t afraid, he was just excited, the excitement of fighting warriors who were stronger than himself.

“No. 1 in Huaxia District, this is confirmed.”

At this time, Baili Haoling said.

“Okay, the airship is here, I wish you all a smooth journey.” Wu Tian laughed and said at this time.

He looked to the back and saw that in the spacious courtyard outside, a huge airship was slowly descending.

“Sky City...” Ouyang Hang seemed to have thought of something at this time, and then muttered to himself.

“What’s the matter, scared?”

Lin Xiu looked at Ouyang Hang at this time, then said with a smile.

“Hehe, would someone from the Ouyang family be afraid?”

Ouyang Hang sneered at this moment, as if he was emboldening himself.

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao seemed to be a little nervous at this time. Although their strength had reached the standard of being able to enter the Sacred Region Academy, they had not officially set foot in the Sky City.

Moreover, this warrior conference could be said to be a feast for warriors from all over the world. Talented warriors from all regions will participate, and it must not be taken lightly.

“I really don’t know why you guys are nervous. I’ve been to this shitty place many times, and there’s nothing much to it.” Baili Haoling pouted and seemed a little disdainful.

“We... do we know each other?”

President Wu Tian looked at Baili Haoling at this time and always felt that Baili Haoling seemed familiar.

Especially Baili Haoling’s tone, she sounded especially like someone from the top of the warrior union.

“Know? Who knows you, old man.” Baili Haoling said immediately after hearing President Wu Tian’s words.

Then she walked towards the airship without looking back.

“What’s with her tone...” When a staff member heard Baili Haoling’s arrogant words, he couldn’t help commenting.

“Forget it.” President Wu Tian shook his head, looking at Baili Haoling’s back, he still felt a little familiar.

But in his memory, he didn’t seem to have seen Baili Haoling. How could he feel this way?

“Phew, so close, I was almost recognized by this chap.”

Baili Haoling, who walked to the airship, could not help but secretly let out a sigh of relief.

“What’s wrong with you?”

Lin Xiu saw that Baili Haoling seemed a little strange, and Lin Xiu couldn’t help but say aloud.

“It’s okay, let’s go.”

Baili Haoling shook her head and said.

This airship was very large, and the space inside was very empty, and if you look closely, you would see that there are many weapons in the hall, just like a huge training room.

President Wu Tian also got on the airship at this time. This time, he was going to personally lead Lin Xiu and the others to Sky City.

“We should reach Sky City at night. You can go to your room to rest now, or practice in this hall.” President Wu Tian looked at Lin Xiu and the others and said.

“What rest, you all come here, I’ll give you some training first.”

Baili Haoling glanced at Lin Xiu and the others, then put his hands on her hips, and said with an imposing voice.

However, she was not very tall, so she looked a little funny at this time.

Boom boom boom —

At this time, the airship had already started to take off. Except for a little wobble when it took off, it became quite stable after that.

Baili Haoling had already started explaining the battle experience at this time. Originally, Lin Xiu just listened to it casually, but with Baili Haoling’s explanation, Lin Xiu found that she really had a very powerful insight into multiplayer battles. Lin Xiu couldn’t help but be surprised.

They spent the afternoon practicing in this hall.

After training all afternoon, Lin Xiu, who was resting with his eyes closed, felt the airship shake violently.

“What’s up?”

“Sky City, we are here.”
