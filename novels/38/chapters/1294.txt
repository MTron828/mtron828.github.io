“En, there is actually someone who finished the first match so quickly.”

At this time, a tall and strong warrior also stood opposite Lin Xiu.

This No. 3400 warrior seemed to be full of strength and the muscles of his entire arm stretched out his battle uniform.

The rule here was that after the victory, the fighters continue to fight.

!!

Warriors who won twice were up against those who have won twice, warriors who have won thrice were against those who have won thrice…

And so on, until there was a warrior who has won ten consecutive matches.

Under this competition system, the warriors who can stay in the end must be very powerful warriors with crushing strength.

“My lord, why is this year’s competition system this way…”

At this time, Wan Gan, the city lord of City of god on the other side of the rostrum, looked at Noble God Riyan beside him and asked.

Although he was the Lord of the City of god, the real master of the City of god is the God King.

Moreover, the place where the God King was located can only be approached by the Noble God Riyan.

So at this time, he seemed to be extremely respectful to the Noble God Riyan.

The owner of the fighting hall in God of city Zhang Qinghua heard Wan Gan’s words and also looked over at Noble God Riyan.

In the auditions in previous years, it has always been 1000 advancing out of 10000 warriors.

But this year, the competition system required ten consecutive victories to advance.

There were also a lot of warriors eliminated.

“The God King felt that there are too many warriors.”

Noble God Riyan looked at the warriors fighting on the battle platform and said lightly.

“And last year’s Noble god was too weak.”

Hearing the words of Noble god Riyan, Wan Gan and Zhang Qinghua were slightly startled, then nodded.

The God warriors who passed the audition last year were conferred the title of Noble God.

Noble God was the only title next to God King.

Strength also varies.

“That’s right. After those people become Noble gods, they didn’t want to make progress and their strength didn’t improve much.”

“I heard that there are already quite a few noble gods who were canonized back then and now they have already been killed by other warriors.”

Zhang Qinghua was a burly man with a beard and he said in a cold voice at this time.

“En, this is more interesting.”

Wan Gan also nodded, looked at the warriors fighting on the battle platform and nodded slightly.

At the same time, Lin Xiu, who was on the battle stage, had already clenched the White Moon spear in his hand.

Because the no. 3400 in front of him was from the city lord of a big city.

He was called Lu Kai.

And the weapon he held was also different from the weapons used by ordinary warriors.

It was a huge black sickle.

There were traces of blood on the weapon.

Obviously, it was left over from the battle just now.

“Hey, Lingxian City, are you a new warrior from the God warrior Realm?”

At this time, Lu Kai looked at Lin Xiu with a strange smile.

“I’ll give you a chance, admit defeat.”

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

These fighters seem to judge the strength of fighters from the size of the city where they come from. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Because a powerful warrior naturally ruled a bigger city.

“Stop talking nonsense, come on.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Although this person’s strength is stronger than that of the warrior who just fought against him, he still doesn’t pose much threat to Lin Xiu.

“Humph!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, he snorted coldly.

Instead of rushing directly to Lin Xiu, he directly waved the black sickle in his hand!

Whoosh—

As his black sickle danced in the air, he could clearly see several black phantoms like Lu Kai appearing beside Lin Xiu.

At the same time, he waved his sickle toward Lin Xiu and chopped it down!

But at this moment, Lin Xiu directly used the ‘Flashing Souls’ body skill and the figure disappeared in place at this moment.

Boom——

The position where Lin Xiu was just now suddenly made a loud noise because of those huge black phantoms swinging their sickles to attack.

Taking a closer look, this extremely hard battle platform has a slight dent at this moment.

...

“here!”

Although Lin Xiu dodged his attack, Lu Kai’s reaction speed was not slow at all.

He seemed to sense where Lin Xiu was dodging and attacked directly to the side!

Lu Kai still charged directly, but held his black sickle, slashed in the air and a crescent-shaped black shock wave directly went in that direction!

The surrounding air seemed to be distorted by the black shock wave he released.

It was enough to see the strength of this power,

As for Lin Xiu, as soon as he appeared, he saw the black crescent-shaped shock wave rushing towards him!

Lu Kai predicted Lin Xiu’s position, so Lin Xiu, who was dodging at this time, seemed to have been cornered and there was no way to dodge!

Damn it!

Looking at this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly and he cursed secretly in his heart. With the White Moon spear in both hands, he was going to use the spear body to resist this black shock wave!

boom–

...

At this time, the black shock wave hit the body of Lin Xiu’s White Moon spear and a loud sound erupted immediately.

Although Lin Xiu firmly stepped on the ground, he took several steps back because of the huge impact, but he didn’t fly out directly.

On the ground, because Lin Xiu stepped on the platform hard, the friction between the shoes and the platform left a trace on the ground.

“interesting.”

Lu Kai saw that Lin Xiu was not seriously injured by his move and immediately showed a look of great interest.

At this time, Lin Xiu also stabilized his aura and the source strength of his body began to be released.

The strength of this man is not at the same level as that of the warrior he dealt with last time.

This man’s strength is obviously much stronger.

Lin Xiu didn’t take it lightly.

At this time, as the strength of Lin Xiu’s body erupted, the White Moon spear in his hand trembled slightly due to the influence of the powerful source strength.

At this moment, the entire spear body burst into dazzling light.

“Hm?”

Just now, Lu Kai thought that Lin Xiu was just a little stronger than ordinary warriors and he wanted to get rid of Lin Xiu slowly.

But at this moment, he saw such a powerful force from Lin Xiu.

The expression in his eyes also changed slightly.

This kid’s strength… seems a bit strong!

His expression also became serious at this moment.

Boom, boom, boom——

Lin Xiu didn’t talk nonsense at this time and his whole body rushed out like an arrow in an instant.

And while rushing out, the White Moon spear in his hand kept dancing.

A series of dark blue flaming birds rushed out in an instant!
