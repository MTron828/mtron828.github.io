Chapter 926: The Maze

There was no other way. The skills that Lin Xiu had were too overpowering.

He already knew that he had no way of defeating Lin Xiu.

At this moment, he only had one thought in mind which is to run!

“Where do you think you’re going?”

Feng Zheng thought that he had managed to escape but suddenly, he heard a familiar voice that came from in front of him.

He looked up and somehow, Lin Xiu was standing right in front of him!

How did he get here so quickly?!

When he realised how close Lin Xiu was, his pupil shrank uncontrollably.

Lin Xiu’s speed was way too fast.

It was so fast that it surprised him.

“You...”

Feng Zheng widened his eyes and wanted to speak but nothing came out of his mouth.

“Goodbye.”

Lin Xiu said bluntly as he picked up his long spear and disappeared into thin air.

‘Sphere’!

Feng Zheng said to himself in fury.

That’s when he released his ‘sphere’.

Koong loong – –

However, when he tried to protect himself with the ‘sphere’, he heard a loud sound that rang through the place.

It turned out that there was a huge crack on Feng Zheng’s ‘sphere’.

At the same time, there was also a bloody hole that appeared on his chest!

Feng Zheng looked down at his chest to find it bleeding and his eyes were filled with disbelief.

Then, his body fell to the ground.

It laid on the ground motionlessly.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was walking towards them, Hu Ling and the rest waited for him.

“Thank you.”

Hu Ling took a deep breath before speaking to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“Saviour, I am terribly sorry for what happened previously...”

Zhang Lin from the White Troops walked out and apologised to Lin Xiu.

“Don’t worry about it.”

Lin Xiu answered flatly.

This was the first time that he was here at the Secret Realm. He managed to get a sage warrior skill and he was happy with it.

“I will not be following you from now on.”

Lin Xiu looked at Hu Ling and told him the truth.

“I know.”

Hu Ling gave a bitter smile.

The skills that Lin Xiu has were so much more than his expectations.

He was incredibly powerful.

Compared to when he killed An Nengxing and his shadows, he was much more powerful now.

Especially when he got to the top of the stairs, it was highly likely that Lin Xiu had already accepted the inheritance.

“By the way, why are you here?”

Hu Ling hesitated for a moment before asking Lin Xiu.

From the looks of it, it doesn’t look like Lin Xiu came to the Secret Realm to get the Inheritance.

“Do you know anything about the Orchid of Heaven?”

Lin Xiu asked Hu Ling.

“Orchid of Heaven?”

Hu Ling was stunned but after thinking hard, he still shook his head.

“Forget it.”

Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders.

“But, you can look for the largest intelligence group in the Wildfire City known as the Dark Shadow team.”

Hu Ling gave a suggestion to Lin Xiu.

“The Dark Shadow Team?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes while thinking about what Hu Ling told him.

One of the reasons why he was here in the Wildfire city was definitely because he needed help from an intelligence agency to look for clues on where the Orchid of Heaven would be. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Goodbye.”

Lin Xiu waved goodbye to both Hu Ling and Zhang Lin before leaving.

Most of the warriors were sad to see Lin Xiu leave.

This was because Lin Xiu had shown incredible skills and if Lin Xiu could stay with them, it would be great for them.

By having him around, he could keep them safe.

At the same time, Lin Xiu headed in the opposite direction.

As he continued walking forward, he seemed to be standing inside an ancient city.

There were different entrances around that made it look like a maze.

“Hmm?”

Lin Xiu frowned as he took a good look around.

He thought about it for some time before deciding which entrance to enter.

The entire place was lit up by candles.

These candles were different from the norm as they were not getting burnt out no matter how long it has been.

He continued walking forward and after some time, he finally saw the light to the exit but when he continued walking, he seemed to have returned to the place where he started.

Lin Xiu frowned.

He picked up his long spear and made a mark on the ground before picking another entrance.

Soon, something weird happened.

Lin Xiu walked through the path and when he got out, he realised that he was still in the same place.

He looked at the ground and noticed that the mark that he made was still there!

That’s right. He went back to the entrance!

“Interesting.”

Lin Xiu smiled in curiosity.

He did not panic. Instead, he looked around, trying to see where he was at.

“DAMN IT! Why are we back here again?!”

After some time, there were voices coming from behind him.

As they got closer, he saw that there were a group of warriors who were walking through the path where he came from.

It was obvious that these men were stuck here as well.

“It looks like there is someone who is stuck here as well.”

One of the warriors noticed Lin Xiu and laughed.

“It’s you?!”

Luo Kun and Zhang Mian were amongst the group of warriors and they were staring at Lin Xiu with disdain.

“You know him?”

The other warriors started asking them about Lin Xiu.

“En. He was with Hu Ling’s team.”

Luo Kun and Zhang Mian nodded their heads while answering.

“Hu Ling? Did you abandon them?”

All of them turned towards Lin Xiu and asked in a cold tone.

However, Lin Xiu was still busy analysing the path before him with his analytic eyes.

As his strength and statistics became better, his analytical skills improved as well.

His Analytic Eyes could see more than the ranks of the warriors.

“Shut up.”

Lin Xiu did not look at them and continued analysing his surroundings.

He looked at each of the tunnels carefully but there seemed to be nothing that he could find.

“Well, it looks like the warrior that you picked from the Divine Domain looks a little arrogant.”

Some of the warriors started mocking.

Zhang Mian and Luo Kun looked awful after hearing the warriors comment.

Ever since they got here, they have encountered multiple threats and most of their warriors had died.

Now, they were stuck in this place and did not know how to get out.

After hearing what the warriors said and with Lin Xiu standing in front of them, they felt furious!

“Hmph!”

Luo Kun, who always had an opinion about Lin Xiu, sneered and decided to give Lin Xiu a good slap!
