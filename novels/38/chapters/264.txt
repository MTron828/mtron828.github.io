Chapter 265: The Small Town In Front Of Dark Forest

Lin Xiu and the others continued to rush towards the Dark Forest at this time.

As the Android Battle Tiger has a navigation system on it and could be automated, Lin Xiu didn’t have to move at all and simply laid on the Android Battle Tiger to rest.

Lin Xiu was resting at this time. After the battle with Zhou Wenhao today, Lin Xiu was a bit tired.

“I still need about 10 to 20 million more experience to level up.” Lin Xiu said to himself at this time.

The experience of killing this rank 7 warrior was really high. After killing him, he has gained three-quarters of the experience required to level up.

Slowly, as time went by, the environment here started to feel different.

Lin Xiu had also changed from lying on the Android Battle Tiger to sitting up.

He looked around and suddenly could clearly see that the surrounding area had begun to slowly become rugged.

There were many dark rocks.

With the Android Battle Tiger’s high beam, he could see that there were some light reflecting off these rocks.

Very strange rocks.

His eyes continued to look ahead and he could see that among the surrounding trees, some dark trees had begun to appear.

“Didididi”

A red dot was flashing on top of the Android Battle Tiger’s display.

We’re at the Dark Forest already?” Lin Xiu saw this and his gaze changed.

“Not yet, we will have to go across another area. There is a small town over there.” Guo Ling’s Android Battle Tiger was walking beside Lin Xiu at this time and she replied.

There is a small town ahead?

Lin Xiu was taken aback for a moment. His gaze swept across the woods in front and seemed to be able to see a slight glow.

Rollie also ran out of Lin Xiu’s backpack and stood on Lin Xiu’s shoulder like it was also observing something.

There were a lot of skeletons in the forest and some weapons were scattered on the ground. At night, it looked a bit scary.

Lin Xiu was now very alert as he stared at the surroundings and held his Dark Edge spear tightly.

As soon as something happens, Lin Xiu would make a move immediately.

Fortunately, they managed to go across this area without encountering any attacks.

After walking out of this forest, they saw a small town over there.

The lights in this town were very bright and there were many warriors around.

It appeared very lively.

Lin Xiu did not expect that after crossing this forest, there would actually be such a lively small town.

“This is the last supply station before going to the Dark Forest. We will rest here tonight and enter the Dark Forest tomorrow.” Guo Ling jumped down from the Android Battle Tiger and said to Lin Xiu.

Qiu Li and the others seem to be quite familiar with this area. They had went ahead and were buying drinks from the vending machine next to them.

Lin Xiu nodded, then jumped off the Android Battle Tiger and walked into the small town in front.

As Lin Xiu and the others walked into the town, some warriors looked at them like they looked a bit odd.

Lin Xiu was also observing these people secretly and noticed that these people were looking at them, his brows knitted slightly.

Lin Xiu had a weird feeling.

With Guo Ling leading, Lin Xiu and the others quickly checked in in a hotel.

The Android Battle Tiger could change its form and made itself smaller so even if it was brought into the room, it wouldn’t take up a lot of space at all.

The cost of accommodation here was 100,000 Union coins per night, which was very expensive.

And there was only one hotel here with decent facilities, the others were a little bit old.

But 100,000 was no longer a hefty amount to him anymore.

Lin Xiu walked into his room and laid on the bed. He immediately felt a moment of comfort.

The bed was very soft. Just after lying on it for a short while, Lin Xiu felt an urge to fall asleep.

He shook his head, he couldn’t fall asleep now.

After taking a cold shower to wake himself up, Lin Xiu walked out of the hotel.

This was the last town before entering the Dark Forest. Lin Xiu felt that he had to check around to see if there was any news about the Dark Forest.

The tavern was indeed the place where the most warriors were at. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Guo Ling and the others were very tired now after travelling the whole day. At this time, they were already lying down in the room and did not come out again.

It was about nine o’clock in the evening as Lin Xiu went out and looked for the tavern in this small town.

As expected, at the turn in front, Lin Xiu saw a tavern there.

Some bounty warriors and warriors who like to take on risky missions would probably be here to carry out their missions.

Lin Xiu walked in and the place was bustling.

There were a lot of warriors in there and it was very lively.

“Sir, what kind of wine would you like?” The waiter on the other side of the counter said to Lin Xiu with a smile at this time.

“Anything will do.” Lin Xiu looked over and said faintly.

“Try our ‘Flaming Red Lips’.”

The waiter smiled, then quickly brought out a bottle of flaming red wine.

Lin Xiu sat on the chair, took a sip, and asked him, “Is there any big news lately?”

Don’t underestimate the waiters inside. These people were waiters on the surface, but they were actually intelligence personnel and were warriors themselves.

Lin Xiu turned on the Analytic Eye and saw that this waiter actually turned out to be a peak rank 6 warrior.

“The latest level one news is 100,000 Union coins, level two news is 500,000, and the third level news is 1 million.”

The man smiled and said while wiping the wine glass with a white rag.

“I want to listen to the Level 3 news.” Lin Xiu said lightly and took out the card he had obtained before.

He swiped it on the machine, tapped to pay 1 million and the 1 million Union coins were transferred to the account of the tavern.

The waiter was a little surprised when he saw Lin Xiu transfer 1 million in so simply.

At the next moment, he burst out laughing.

“It seems that you’re really bold, I shall give you an additional piece of information.”
