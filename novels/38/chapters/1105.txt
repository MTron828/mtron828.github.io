Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

At this time, while Lin Xiu was attacking the Bai family’s Sage warriors, the sound of the battle outside became even louder.

A large number of aircraft were continuously shot down from the sky and loud explosions continued to sound.

There were too many warriors outside Baidi City. Those warriors in the City Lord council were completely unprepared before. Soon, most of Baidi City was captured.

Those warriors who didn’t want to get dragged down in this all flew away from Baidi City.

At this time, Bai Rui’s source strength also burst out and blue energy burst out from his body.

!!

These were all formed by the materialization of source strength.

At this time, Bai Rui looked at Lin Xiu who was fighting over there and stretched out his right hand.

The blue energy group instantly charged toward Lin Xiu!

And at the moment of the impact, this blue energy group turned into a huge claw, then went toward Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu waved his spear and just knocked a warrior out of the air. Looking back, he saw a claw transformed from a huge blue energy, grabbing his body!

“Damn…”

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened at this time and he wanted to break free.

But at this time, he found that he had no way to break free.

“Boy, old ginger is still spicier than younger ones.”

At this time, Bai Rui looked at Lin Xiu being caught by the huge energy claws he released and said coldly.

“Kill him!”

At this time, Bai Rui looked at the remaining Sage warriors and shouted loudly.

Now there were only five Sage warriors left.

They also looked a little battered and exhausted at this time.

But when they heard Bai Rui’s roar, they quickly reacted, holding the weapons in their hands and attacking Lin Xiu who was caught by the huge blue energy claws!

Dang dang-

But when their weapons hit Lin Xiu’s body, there was a loud noise.

Their weapons were like they were attacking some hard metal and there was absolutely no way to cause damage to Lin Xiu!

how can that be!

The faces of these Sage warriors changed greatly at this time.

Taking a closer look, they found that although Lin Xiu’s body was caught by the huge claws, the outer layer of Lin Xiu’s body was covered by a faint blue source strength.

Protecting Lin Xiu’s body!

“You’re trying to kill me with this little strength?”

Lin Xiu sneered. At this time, the strength of his whole body was mobilized again.

Under the state of ‘Fury’, Lin Xiu’s power has reached its limit now!

boom–

The blue giant claw that grabbed Lin Xiu’s body immediately exploded!

pfft—

As the blue giant claws broke, Bai Rui’s body was attacked and he vomited out a mouthful of blood.

‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!

And at this time, the long spear in Lin Xiu’s hand directly drew an arc, forming a huge black dragon, attacking the remaining few Sage warriors!

These Sage warriors originally wanted to continue attacking Lin Xiu, but when they saw the scene in front of them, their expressions suddenly changed.

This black dragon was very terrifying, they felt that there was no way to resist it, so they wanted to dodge.

But the black dragon seemed to have self-consciousness. They dodged, but the black dragon followed them!

bang bang bang-

Soon, two Sage warriors were caught off guard and were directly bitten by the open-mouthed black dragon!

Boom—

The entire ground was shaking due to the impact of the black dragon.

It felt as if there was a magnitude 10 earthquake!

The bodies of the two Sage warriors were also covered in wounds.

Before the sage warriors could move, the two flaming birds slammed down from the air, hitting their bodies directly.

At this moment, their bodies were covered in flames.

In an instant, two pieces of black coal appeared.

The other three Sage warriors who were lucky enough to escape the attack of the black dragon had expressions of fear on their faces. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

So many warriors, so many Sage warriors, just killed by a kid?!

They almost thought that they were in a dream.

But Lin Xiu wouldn’t give them any chance to breathe. At this time, he used the Flashing souls body skill and appeared directly in front of them!

The Dark Edge spear in his hand continued to attack them!

Dang–

They wanted to block with their weapons.

But when their weapons collided with Lin Xiu’s spear and they immediately felt the terrifying force.

They couldn’t even hold on their weapons any longer!

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

At this moment, Lin Xiu continued to use his skills.

The moment the spear was pierced, thousands of cold lights appeared in the air.

At this time, the three Sage warriors simply didn’t have time to react.

At this moment, their bodies were riddled with holes.

A large amount of blood sputtered out at this time.

Looking at the progress of the total experience at this time, it has risen to 45%!

The remaining time of ‘Fury’ was about to end at this time.

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu continued to activate the ‘Reset’ skill before using ‘Fury’.

Using ‘Fury’ twice does not strengthen the effect of ‘Fury’, but only prolongs its duration.

“Bai Rui, your Bai family betrayed and destroyed the Ye family, today, it’s your turn to suffer.”

Lin Xiu looked at Bai Rui on the other side and said coldly.

The light in Lin Xiu’s chest that the old man gave him at the Tower of Trial dissipated slowly in an instant, becoming a special kind of power that converged on Lin Xiu’s whole body.

Lin Xiu, who felt this, was surprised.

This energy light group has been in Lin Xiu’s chest for a long time. He never thought that at this time, it would be absorbed by him in this way.

“Humph! The remnants of the Ye family, do you think that the Bai family has only this power!?”

Bai Rui’s face was extremely ugly at this time, he looked at Lin Xiu from a distance and said angrily.

That’s right, apart from Baidi City, the real Bai family is on the other side of this planet.

The Bai family in Baidi City is just one of the largest branches.

“You guys are just the beginning.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Courting death!”

At this time, Bai Rui roared and with a wave of his hands, all the rocks on the surrounding ground flew into the air.

clack clack——

Those rocks did not directly impact Lin Xiu, but all gathered together.

forming a huge rock giant.

At this moment, this incomparably huge rock giant waved his fist and attacked Lin Xiu!

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu didn’t have the slightest fear and charged directly with the Dark Edge spear in his hand!
