Chapter 633: The Fatal Blow, kill the Rank 9!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

With Lin Xiu’s spear slashing down, it directly hit his ‘Sphere’, which was already full of cracks. In the next moment, a crisp sound of ‘pop’ resounded in an instant!

This old monster Zhuo’s “Sphere” was actually destroyed by Lin Xiu!

The audience exclaimed!

Although the strength was suppressed to the eighth rank, it was a “Sphere” unfolded by a rank 9 warrior and Lin Xiu actually broke it!

“That weapon is qutie interesting.” At this moment, Nan Huang stared at the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand, revealing a strange look.

Not only him, but some people had discovered the peculiarity of the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hands too.

Swoosh,

At the same time, the moment Lin Xiu broke his ‘Sphere’, the spear was like a dragon and he stabbed it out again!

The ‘Sphere’ was broken and the old man suffered a lot of backlash because of this. At this time, a smear of blood flowed down from his lips.

“Damn it!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu’s spear stabbed over again, he suddenly reached out and grabbed it!

Lin Xiu’s pupils shrank slightly and was about to use force on the spear in his hand again.

But this old monster Zhuo was so powerful that he even grabbed Lin Xiu’s spear so that Lin Xiu couldn’t pierce any further!

“Go to hell!”

He grabbed the body of Lin Xiu’s soear with one hand and the long sword in the other hand instantly stabbed Lin Xiu’s body!

Sphere’!

Lin Xiu roared inwardly and a dark red ‘Sphere’ appeared instantly, which was blocked by the long sword.

With the movement of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the body of the Dark Edge spear appeared with red flames accompanied by lightning!

“What!!!”

The old monster Zhuo, who had just grabbed the spear body, felt the sharp pain in his hands. At this moment, he could not help but let out a wailing sound and instantly released the Dark Edge spear.

At this moment, Lin Xiu seized the opportunity and continued to attack!

The old monster Zhuo reacted very quickly. The long sword that was blocked by Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ just moved and blocked the shot.

The spearhead stabbed on the body of the long sword and a fire flashed in an instant.

Because Lin Xiu just broke the “Sphere”, it was impossible for him to continue to unfold the “Sphere”.

Moreover, Lin Xiu’s marksmanship was too sharp. Now that his power was suppressed, it was impossible to defeat Lin Xiu!

He was still injured and Lin Xiu’s skills were too complicated. If things go on like this, he is very likely to die under Lin Xiu’s hands!

Flee!

After he resisted Lin Xiu’s blow, the long sword in his hand turned into a cloud of black mist and disappeared in place in an instant!

“Where are you going huh!”

Lin Xiu turned around and looked at the back and saw the old monster Zhuo rushing towards Zhuo Qixing, as if he wanted to take Zhuo Qixing and leave the competition stage!

At this time, Lin Xiu also directly used the ‘Without a Trace’ body skill and rushed over at an

extremely fast speed!

When he was about to get there, Lin Xiu suddenly leaped!

“Second grandpa...” Zhuo Qixing watched Old Monster Zhuo rush towards him and knew that something was wrong.

“Go!”

Old Monster Zhuo said with a loud roar.

Now there was no other way, in order to protect Zhuo Qixing, he could only take him away!

Although Zhuo Qixing couldn’t break free from Baili Haoling’s source field, Old monster Zhuo could.

“Where are you going!”

And at this moment, a voice came from the sky.

Old Monster Zhuo was about to leave here carrying Zhuo Qixing’s body when he suddenly raised his head to look up, only to see Lin Xiu holding the Dark Edge spear in both hands, charging down!

Both the spear and Lin Xiu were covered with a lot of flames and Lin Xiu’s whole person was like a meteorite, rushing down!

“Courting death!!!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu was still chasing after him, Old Monster Zhuo was even more furious. With a roar, a powerful light burst out from the long sword in his hand. As he suddenly raised the long sword, a terrifying beam of energy just burst out!

This time, it was he who gathered all the energy from his entire body to kill Lin Xiu!

But Lin Xiu had already unfolded his ‘Sphere and all the terrifying energy beams were blocked by Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

Moreover, after Lin Xiu forcibly resisted this skill, he was still rushing down from the air and did not stop!

The long spear carried a dark red light, full of incomparably terrifying power!

Power-up strike

Lin Xiu saw that the system had already prompted for the power-up strike and immediately cast it!

‘Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall’ coupled with the power-up strike, the power of this spear became even more powerful!

Old Monster Zhuo still wanted to resist, but in the next moment, he saw Lin Xiu’s whole body filled with silver light, like a galaxy gushing down from the sky!

“Ah!!!”

He let out a roar and when he was faced with death, the strength of his whole body erupted!

Baili Haoling’s brows furrowed immediately outside the arena, because she could clearly feel that her source field was weakening. Now, Old Monster Zhuo, obviously, was about to regain his own strength!

Lin Xiu and the old monster Zhuo was exchanging blows to and fro just now, but once the old monster Zhuo regains his strength, it may instantly turn the situation around!

One can only hope that Lin Xiu will kill with one blow!

But this possibility was too low. The flesh body of a rank 9 warrior was not so easy to be destroyed.

“Ding!”

“A fatal blow, the trigger is successful!”

Boom

Lin Xiu stabbed down! The old monster Zhuo originally exploded a terrifying source strength out of his body to resist and counterattack but he exploded directly!

A huge sound, not only the competition stage, but also the surrounding area vibrated crazily!

“What kind of skill is this?

The pupils in Bai Litao’s eyes shrank slightly.

The power that Lin Xiu burst out for the final move was really too powerful and too terrifying.

The body of the rank 9 warrior was directly destroyed!

Not only Bai Litao, but other warriors on the podium were shocked.

This scene was really incredible.

“Seems like I won.”

Looking at the corpse of Old Monster Zhuo who was smashed into pieces by his spear, Lin Xiu said coldly. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Now he still has some lingering fears. He was so close – if this old monster Zhuo regained his strength just now, he would be the one who died.

“You...” Zhuo Qixing’s body was trembling at this time, he was looking at Lin Xiu, full of disbelief.

The powerful rank 9 warrior of his family was killed by Lin Xiu so easily!?

This is impossible!

His heart was roaring, but the scene in his eyes told him that it was true.

“Next, it’s your turn.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were full of killing intent, staring at Zhuo Qixing and said.

There was no chance last time, but this time, there was an upright opportunity to eradicate this threat directly.

“This is Sky City! If you dare to kill me, you can’t get out of here alive!”

He roared loudly and just as he was about to make a move, a flash of white light flashed and the spear pierced directly through his head!
