Chapter 748: Beast Tide

“Never mind.”

Lin Xiu was too lazy to chase now.

Taking a deep breath, he looked around.

The members of the God’s Punishment Guild have all died.

For Lin Xiu, this was just a small episode.

After all, a warrior of this level was no longer strong for the current Lin Xiu.

However, he wasn’t sure if the railroad ahead was repaired already or not.

“Damn!”

However, when Lin Xiu returned to the original road, he found that the train had disappeared!

It had already left.

This was really unfortunate.

Originally, it was estimated that he would arrive at Fengyun City soon, but now things have become troublesome again.

There was no other way, Lin Xiu could only follow this path and continue to move forward.

He hoped that there would be a city in the front.

As Lin Xiu continued to move forward, the surrounding weather changed in an instant.

From the original ice and snow, it suddenly became extremely hot.

“It’s so hot.”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but take off the battle suit he bought in the Ice and Snow City and threw it on the ground.

This kind of ordinary battle suit has no effect on Lin Xiu.

And at this moment, Lin Xiuyin vaguely heard a sound coming from behind.

Several young warriors.

There are three men and two women and they all carry the fur of some evolved beasts.

They were armed with sharp weapons and it seemed that they have just hunted down some evolved beasts.

“Look, there is someone there.”

One of the guys who looked a little fat looked at Lin Xiu over there and pointed at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

And the rest of the people clenched their weapons at this time, seeming to be a little hostile.

“Brother, are you also here to hunt evolved beasts?”

The fat man seemed to speak to Lin Xiu in a casual way.

“No.”

Lin Xiu watched them approach, then shook his head and said.

“No, who would believe you huh.”

A man looked at Lin Xiu and said with a sneer.

They seemed to think that Lin Xiu was also going to hunt evolved beasts.

And Lin Xiu has black pupils, which seemed to make these people look down on him.

“My name is Liu Pan.”

On the contrary, this fat man looked very familiar.

It made Lin Xiu happy too.

“My name is Lin Xiu.”

“Hehe, they are Xiao Qiang, Zhao Kai, An Qi and Qian Lin.”

“We all met on the road. Let’s take advantage of this beast tide to hunt some evolved beasts.”

“Why don’t we go together, one more person would be added strength.”

The fat man who called himself Liu Pan said with a smile, looking a bit wretched.

“Hmph, I’m afraid it will be a hindrance.”

One of the men snorted coldly.

Although they were all temporarily formed teams, it was actually a good thing to add people in. After all, there would be many other teams hunting down evolved beasts.

But when they saw Lin Xiu’s black pupils, they instinctively thought that Lin Xiu’s strength must be very low.

“No thanks.”

Lin Xiu smiled at Liu Pan, then shook his head.

“If you don’t form a team, I’m afraid...” Liu Pan was taken aback for a moment, then subconsciously said.

“I want to go to Fengyun City.”

Lin Xiu looked into the distance and said lightly.

“Fengyun City? It’s still 108,000 miles from here.”

“And the finals of the warrior competition is coming soon, so you can’t enter now.”

Liu Pan explained.

“It doesn’t matter, do you know how to get there quickly?”

Although it is far away, the start date of the competition was not so soon.

Because of the recent riots of evolved beasts that destroyed the transportation facilities, in order to allow the participating warriors to have a buffer time, the official competition has been postponed until one month later.

So there should be plenty of time.

“The express train should have stopped by now. I saw a train passing by and it seems to be the last train this month.” Liu Pan thought for a while and said.

“The traffic on your Marqi planet doesn’t seem to be very developed.” Lin Xiu said with a helpless sigh.

It would be very troublesome to rush there now, Lin Xiu thought.

Can’t he go on foot?

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu felt a headache.

“Brother Lin, are you not from our planet?”

Liu Pan heard Lin Xiu muttering to himself and said curiously at this time.

“Ok.”

Lin Xiu nodded.

Hearing these words, the others were even more disdainful.

Because for them, Lin Xiu, a warrior from another planet, is definitely weaker.

Moreover, it was obvious that Lin Xiu did not have a strong source fluctuation.

Boom boom boom —

At this moment, the surrounding ground seemed to vibrate slowly.

“Coming!”

Feeling the vibration, Liu Pan seemed to know something and his expression changed suddenly.

And the rest of the people also clenched the weapons in their hands and were ready to attack.

What!?

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment, but at this moment, he found that a group of black figures came from the front.

Evolved beasts! All of them are evolved beasts!

“It turned out to be the rank 8 one-horned black yak.”

A man said in a cold voice, the weapons in both hands were about to attack the front!

“Is this too many? Are we sure we want to kill?”

The look in Liu Pan’s eyes also changed slightly.

Although it is an evolved beast of about the eighth rank, but there are so many, he was afraid it would be too much trouble.

There were at least two or three hundred!

“What are you afraid of, just kill them!”

Xiao Qiang roared angrily and took the lead in attacking with his own weapon!

And the rest of the people also looked very serious at this time and they all took out their weapons to attack.

This fat man Liu Pan looked rather shy and calm just now, but at this time he held a double-sided axe in his hand and rushed towards the front.

He wielded a pair of axes and with the use of his skills, he instantly killed several of those rank 8 black yaks.

“Huh? It seems that their strength is not bad.”

Looking at the actions of these people, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said to himself.

Because of their attacks, those rank 8 one-horned black yak were attracted to them.

All of them attacked them.

A group of five rank 9 warriors.

At the same time, in addition to most of the one-horned black yak charging towards Liu Pan and the others, some one-horned black yak also rushed towards Lin Xiu who was not far behind.

Their limbs were strong and the speed of impact was also very fast.

That sharp single horn seemed to pierce Lin Xiu’s body.

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched and with a stroke of the spear in his hand, the body of the one-horned black yak that charged over first exploded!

“By the way, I wonder how is Brother Lin.”

Liu Pan was also in a hard fight at this time. Killing a few was not a problem, killing a dozen or so was not a problem. The problem was that there were hundreds of them now!

“Humph! I’m afraid he’s dead.”

Zhao Kai said coldly.

“Look over there!”

But the other two women looked back and their eyes widened as they exclaimed.
