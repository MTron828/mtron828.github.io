1270 The Mighty Liu Cheng

Thinking of this, Liu Cheng rushed toward Lin Xiu in the next moment!

When he used his body skills, it seemed that he couldn’t catch his figure at all.

He appeared in front of Lin Xiu in an instant.

The frosty giant sword he held in both hands slashed toward Lin Xiu!

!!

Dang–

But what he didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu’s reaction speed was also very fast.

The fists with gloves directly blocked his blow!

But the power of his sword was so great that Lin Xiu felt severe pain from both of his fists.

At this moment, the whole person flew out directly.

But Liu Cheng obviously wouldn’t stop his movements. With a movement of his body, he continued to attack Lin Xiu who flew out!

Baili Haoling, who was in the sky, also moved at this time, holding the two swords in her hands and flew down directly.

Baili Haoling moved very fast, but still couldn’t catch up with Liu Cheng’s speed.

Liu Cheng was still holding the frosty giant sword in his hand and appeared behind Lin Xiu who was sent flying.

The Frosty giant sword in both hands continued to chop down!

boom–

This time, Lin Xiu seemed unable to dodge.

This incomparably sharp Frosty giant sword cut Lin Xiu’s body in half!

But as Lin Xiu’s body was cut in half, Liu Cheng didn’t see any blood flow out at all.

Fake!

He quickly reacted.

When he glanced around, he found several ‘Lin Xiu’ around! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

These several identical ‘Lin Xiu’ directly raised their hands and attacked Liu Cheng.

“Get lost!!!”

Seeing this scene, Liu Cheng roared angrily.

An extremely terrifying aura erupted from his body.

The surrounding space seemed to be rippled and rippled.

This powerful force directly shattered the body of ‘Lin Xiu’.

These were all fake!

But the real Lin Xiu appeared behind him at the next moment.

Lin Xiu’s fist carried an incomparably terrifying source strength and directly blasted towards his body!

Snapped–

But just when Lin Xiu’s fist was about to hit Liu Cheng’s body, Liu Cheng suddenly turned around and grabbed Lin Xiu’s fist with his left hand.

“Sure enough, you seem to have consumed a lot of power.”

Seeing that he easily grabbed Lin Xiu’s fist, Liu Cheng said coldly.

He can clearly feel that Lin Xiu’s power is not strong now.

And the moment he finished speaking, the Frosty giant sword in his right hand slashed towards Lin Xiu!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s pupils shrank slightly.

But his fist was firmly grasped by Liu Cheng’s left hand, there was no way to break free, even if he wanted to dodge, he couldn’t dodge!

‘Sphere’!

There was no way, Lin Xiu can only expand his ‘Sphere’ directly at this time.

boom–

The next moment, his sword hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ and a loud noise erupted.

Watching Lin Xiu unfold the ‘Sphere’ to resist his own sword, Liu Cheng’s left hand grasping Lin Xiu’s fist suddenly exerted force and was about to crush Lin Xiu’s fist!

But at this moment, Liu Cheng’s fist had an intense burning sensation.

what!

Liu Cheng wailed in his heart and let go of Lin Xiu’s fist.

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu’s fist was filled with terrifying dark blue flames at some point!

This terrifying flame burned his left hand that had grasped Lin Xiu’s fist.

“Hoo hoo.”

Lin Xiu was also a little out of breath at this time.

He had already consumed a lot of power at Changqing City. Now when he fought Liu Cheng again, Lin Xiu’s power could not be exerted to 100%.

But when he saw the tragic situation of Mr. Pang and Lei Tong, Lin Xiu’s eyes were also filled with infinite killing intent.

kill him!

Dangdangdang——

...

At this moment, Baili Haoling rushed down from the sky.

At this time, Baili Haoling held two swords and directly attacked Liu Cheng.

But Liu Cheng’s reaction speed was very fast. He held the frosty giant sword and blocked Baili Haoling’s crazy attack in an instant.

“too weak!”

After resisting Baili Haoling’s attack for a while, Liu Cheng roared angrily.

His Frosty giant sword burst into dazzling light in an instant.

The moment Baili Haoling’s twin swords slashed against the Frosty giant sword she was using to resist, she immediately felt a strong sword aura bursting out from his Frosty giant sword.

Affected by the frightening sword aura of the Frosty giant sword, Baili Haoling had a lot of scars on her hands.

The battle uniform she was wearing had many holes directly cut into it.

There was blood flowing out of the neck.

“die!”

...

Taking advantage of this moment, Liu Cheng slashed out with a single sword!

But at this moment, Baili Haoling’s body was directly captured by a white shadow.

Liu Cheng’s attack hit nothing in an instant.

He looked up and found that Xiaobai had captured her and flown to a high place in the sky.

“Humph!”

Looking at this scene, Liu Cheng snorted coldly.

Just when he was about to make a move, another extremely huge figure appeared in the sky.

Rollie jumped down from the sky and still held that huge shining hammer in his hand!

“It’s this damn thing…”

Looking at the billowing figure falling from the sky, Liu Cheng’s expression became even uglier.

He clearly remembered that it was this monster that ate his mount! !!

Now he still dares to attack him with a big hammer!?

“Courting death!”

Liu Cheng roared angrily and without dodging at all, he directly slashed out with the giant Frosty sword he held in both hands!

Boom——

The Frosty giant sword collided with the shining warhammer Rollie was holding and there was an extremely loud explosion sound.

“what!!!”

Liu Cheng roared angrily and the power of his whole body was transmitted to the Frosty Giant Sword crazily.

Holding the shining warhammer, Rollie was directly thrown out by the impact.

But after its huge body swayed a few times in the air, it stabilized.

Liu Cheng was about to take advantage of this to pursue and kill this evolved beast that had devoured his mount.

But just as he was making a move, out of the corner of his eye, he saw Lin Xiu rushing over again!

“Trash!!!”

Looking at Lin Xiu who continued to rush over, Liu Cheng didn’t pay attention at all now.

He roared, turned around abruptly, and slashed toward Lin Xiu with the frosty giant sword!

Lin Xiu’s fist was blasting toward him. At this moment, he saw a flash of cold light and he felt his fist hit his frosty giant sword!

The Frosty giant sword is really too sharp. With a crisp sound, Lin Xiu felt that his fist was about to be cut in half by the Frosty giant sword!

boom–

Lin Xiu’s body took a few steps back at this moment.

He spat out a mouthful of blood.

Take a closer look at his right hand that just touched with the frosty giant sword, it was covered in blood!
