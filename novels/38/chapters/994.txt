Chapter 995: The Source Stone of Fire

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

In the next moment, Lin Xiu and others also retreated to the back.

In the middle area, a circular crack appeared.

Soon, an oval building slowly rose from the crack.

“It isn’t the Angel’s Tears?”

Watching this thing rise, Gao Lin frowned.

!!

Having experienced so many dangers just now, he didn’t expect that what appeared was not the Angel’s Tears.

But a mass of… fire?

Above this oval building, there was a group of flames.

In the middle of the flames, there seemed to be something like a fiery red stone.

“Energy Source Stone!?”

Ji Mei seemed to have thought of something and said it subconsciously.

“This is the energy source stone?”

When Deng Men heard Ji Mei’s words, a look of greed appeared in his eyes.

In this Sage warrior space, the energy source stone was the most precious thing.

“I just heard the broadcast that three energy source stones had been collected by other warriors. It is of no use for us to collect this one.”

Gao Cong thought for a while, then said aloud.

They also had smartwatches in their hands. Obviously, they also know about this ‘collection’ system.

No one would be able to collect all five energy source stones within five days.

“Humph! Stupid!”

Deng Men said coldly at this time.

“Each energy source stone contains extremely strong power. It does not have to be collected. Just this one, we can directly absorb its power…”

Speaking of this, Deng Men’s eyes showed undisguised greed.

“Do you dare to take it?”

Gao Lin said with a sneer.

This energy source stone is enveloped by this terrifying flame, who would dare to touch it?

Taking a closer look, you can clearly see the flame of the energy source stone has caused the surrounding air to become distorted.

The surrounding space became extremely hot.

Deng Men closed his mouth at this time.

But when he looked at the fire energy source stone, his eyes were still full of greed.

He wanted it, but he didn’t dare to ask for it.

Lin Xiu almost laughed out loud at this time.

He never thought that the source stone of fire would be here.

Without any hesitation at this moment, Lin Xiu walked directly to the middle.

When Gao Lin and the others saw this scene, their expressions changed slightly.

“Are you going to get that energy source stone?”

“certainly.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Ji Mei wanted to say something at first, but she thought of the scene where Lin Xiu suffered the same terrifying flame in that passage just now and nothing happened at all, so she kept quiet.

Just looking at Lin Xiu, she felt that Lin Xiu was full of mystery.

“I don’t believe that you can get it.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Deng Men watched Lin Xiu walk over and said in a low voice.

As he got closer to the energy source stone, Lin Xiu could clearly feel his body getting hotter and hotter.

But now, his body can still bear it.

Taking a deep breath, Lin Xiu continued to approach at the next moment.

After looking at the energy source stone, he reached out and touched it.

Ji Mei’s eyes widened when she saw this scene.

If she touches it, her hands would probably be directly burned to ashes.

Lin Xiu reached out and touched the flame and his hand instantly turned red.

There were also many blisters on it.

The hands were about to become bloody.

But soon, Lin Xiu’s hand began to repair quickly.

Reaching out his hand, he directly grasped the source stone of fire in his hand.

As the energy source stone was held by Lin Xiu, an extremely scorching feeling was immediately transmitted to Lin Xiu.

However, it didn’t cause much damage to Lin Xiu.

Di di di-

With the activation of Lin Xiu’s smartwatch, in the next moment, this energy source stone directly turned into a ball of energy and entered the ‘collection’ interface in the smartwatch.

Three, he had already collected three energy source stones.

Other than the source stone of earth that someone else gotten, he just had to obtain the ocean source stone and it would be sufficient.

When Deng Men saw this scene, his face suddenly turned hideous.

This energy source stone was actually obtained!

“Hey, we came together, this energy source stone, you just grabbed it like this, it isn’t right, is it?”

Deng Men looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

He wanted to incite Gao Lin and others, but when he looked at Gao Lin and others, he found that they seemed to have no opinion on this situation.

“you want it?”

Lin Xiu looked at Deng Men and said lightly.

At this moment, Lin Xiu clicked on the projection screen of the smart watch and the Source of Fire suddenly floated in the air.

A bright red flame appeared around the body of the energy source of Fire.

“You’d really give it to me?”

Deng Men looked at him and said aloud.

“Take it.”

Lin Xiu pointed at the Source Stone of Fire and said lightly.

“Deng Men, don’t court death.”

Gao Lin looked at Deng Men and said with a cold snort.

“shut up!”

Deng Men snorted coldly and walked directly towards Lin Xiu.

Looking at the source stone of fire so close at hand, he directly reached out and grabbed it!

The moment his hand grabbed the energy source stone, an intense burning sensation instantly struck.

“Ah!!!”

Deng Men let out a scream and in the next moment, the terrifying flame directly burned and melted his hand.

When those flames melted away his arms, they also melted his body.

In a short moment, Deng Men’s body melted and only his skeleton was left.

When Ji Mei saw this scene, she couldn’t help covering her mouth.

Her eyes were full of fear.

She never imagined that this source stone of fire would be so terrifying.

“Is this the energy source stone…”

“Sure enough, those who can get it, deserves it.”

Gao Lin said suddenly at this time.

Deng Men’s fate was expected.

It seems that if you have no ability, even if this energy source stone is placed in front of you, you will not be able to get it!

“Do you guys want it?”

Lin Xiu glanced at them and said lightly.

“No, we can’t use it even if you give it to us.”

The three Gao brothers shook their heads at the same time.

Ji Mei shook her head like a rattle.

Lin Xiu tapped the projection screen and the energy source stone entered the smart watch again.

“Let’s go, look for where the Angel’s tears are.”

This ancient ruin is very large. After returning to the original path, everyone went on another path.

“This way, it should be this way!”
