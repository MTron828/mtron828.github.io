Chapter 538: Strange Cave

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Although he felt severe pain all over his body.

Lin Xiu, who had experienced so much pain, could still endure this.

“Report!”

Just when Wan Lu was about to make a move, a voice came from the front.

“What’s wrong?” Wan Lu frowned when he heard the voice of his subordinates.

“We found a cave over there…” The man hurried in and said, panting.

This forest was a bit weird. During the time they came in, they kept wandering around as if they were lost.

Just now, they discovered a cave in the hidden place over there.

“Huh? What’s so special about the cave…” Wan Lu raised his brows and said subconsciously.

However, at the next moment, his expression changed suddenly, and then he came to his senses. He grabbed the man’s collar and said, “You said there is a cave nearby!?”

“Yes…Yes.” The man was shocked by Wan Lu’s pull and hurriedly said.

“No wonder I can’t find it.” Wan Lu’s face turned hideous at this time. He saw Lin Xiu swallow Thunder Lotus Fire with his own eyes.

This was the first time he has seen this method of swallowing the Thunder Lotus Fire, and he has never even heard of it before.

But even if he dared to devour Thunder Lotus like this, it would not be so easy to completely digest the energy of the Thunder Lotus Fire.

Moreover, the energy of the Thunder Lotus Fire was huge, if the person who swallows it does not run the ‘Cultivation Technique’ to speed up the absorption, he would definitely die.

That’s why he kept searching around nearby.

But he was very puzzled that Lin Xiu was not found. Now that he heard that there was a cave, it was very possible that the person who devoured the Thunder Lotus Fire was probably hiding nearby!

“Found it?” Lao Bai also seemed to have thought of something, his eyes suddenly changed and he said.

“If we’re not wrong.” Wan Lu said with a sneer.

“Take us there!”

“Yes!”

At this time, Lin Xiu, who was in the cave, could clearly feel the energy of the Thunder Lotus Fire. With his ‘Cultivation Technique’ running and the influence of his ‘Engulf’ skill, this energy was constantly being absorbed.

If nothing goes wrong, this energy will be almost completely absorbed in another hour or two! Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

However, at this critical moment, Lin Xiu heard a sound coming from the entrance of the cave.

Someone is coming?

“It’s here.” The man who found the cave walked over with Wan Lu and Lao Bai and said aloud.

Hearing the man’s words, Wan Lu and Lao Bai approached. There were some black trees and weeds here, so it was hard to notice the cave.

“Go in and find him!” Wan Lu looked at the warriors behind and shouted loudly.

“You guys go in too!” Lao Bai looked back and said aloud.

Because no one knows what will be inside, there might be evolved beasts too.

Wan Lu and Lao Bai were both old foxes. Although they were high-ranking warriors, they didn’t dare to take risks at this time.

“Yes!”

As soon as Wan Lu and the Lao Bai spoke, these people took the lighting equipment and started to move inside.

Because there were so many people, the sound of footsteps was very loud at this time, and in this cave, there were echoes.

Not good!

Lin Xiu, who was absorbing the Thunder Lotus fire energy in his body, opened his eyes at this time, and then he looked back suddenly, and saw a light shining on his face!

“Ah!”

The man in the front holding the lighting equipment suddenly saw Lin Xiu over there, and he got a fright as his body fell to the ground all of a sudden.

“What are you doing!” Wan Lu, who followed behind, frowned and said aloud.

“It seems… it seems that someone is there!” The man got frightened because of his fear of the darkness in the cave and Lin Xiu’s sudden appearance.

Someone!?

Wan Lu and Lao Bai’s eyes changed, and then they rushed in with the lighting equipment!

Now they had determined that the person who devoured the Thunder Lotus Fire is probably inside, and is still absorbing the energy of the Thunder Lotus Fire!

As long as they killed him and cut open his belly, it is very possible that the energy of the Thunder Lotus Fire that has not been absorbed will be released again!

Lin Xiu’s reaction was not slow at all. At this time, he had recovered from the state of cultivation and ran into the cave without looking back.

This cave was very long, and the deeper you go, the more empty it seems.

What the hell is this place?

Lin Xiu said to himself, but now it’s too late for Lin Xiu to think about it.. If he didn’t run quickly, it would be very difficult for him to deal with the two rank 7 warriors once they catch up!!!
