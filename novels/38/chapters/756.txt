Chapter 757: Meet Again

“What news?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said lightly.

“You promise to let me go and I’ll tell you!”

The burly man was shivering at this time, like a frightened kitten.

There is no arrogance at all.

“Then go to hell.”

Lin Xiu said lightly, the spear in his hand was about to stab directly at him!

“I’ll speak!” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Looking at this scene, he had no time to think so much, so he said loudly at this time.

The tip of the spear had already appeared in front of his forehead.

Nearly, the tip of the spear was about to pierce his head.

“Speak.”

“The Raging Flame Lion has already appeared and it is said that this time it still has treasures on it and the nearby warriors within a hundred miles have all gathered there!”

It was too late for the man to think about it, so he hurriedly said.

Lin Xiu’s strength was so terrifying that he didn’t have the intention to resist at all.

Now all he thinks about is saving his life.

“That’s it?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“That’s right...”

The man was startled, then said subconsciously.

But just as he finished speaking, his head was directly pierced by Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear!

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for killing a rank 9 warrior and gaining experience...”

The experience gained from killing these rank 9 warriors was very little.

So Lin Xiu didn’t even need to look at the system prompts.

“Brother Lin, you didn’t practice the ‘Facial Rejuvenation Technique’, did you?”

Liu Pan looked at the corpses of the warriors on the ground and said exaggeratedly.

Because Lin Xiu’s strength was really too strong, but he looks so young.

Therefore, Liu Pan ias a little suspicious that Lin Xiu was not of this age, but has cultivated this special skill to keep his skin youthful.

Qian Lin and An Qi both turned their eyes towards Lin Xiu at this time.

They also seemed curious.

Lin Xiu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry, then helplessly spread out his hands and said, “I really don’t practice that kind of thing.”

“Then how old are you...?”

Liu Pan was stunned for a moment, but then he couldn’t help but asked.

“Well...”

“Should be almost eighteen.”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Liu Pan and the others’ eyes widened.

“Sev... seventeen years old?”

They were almost shocked to death.

It is too terrifying to have such a powerful strength at such a young age.

“Are all people from Earth so terrifying...”

An Qi and Qian Lin were also dumbfounded and muttered to themselves at this time.

Lin Xiu looked at them and smiled, but didn’t say much.

“Let’s go, it should be dawn in about an hour.”

Lin Xiu was carrying his Dark Edge spear at this time and said aloud.

“Wait for us!”

Seeing Lin Xiu walking in the other direction, Liu Pan and the others quickly picked up their backpacks and ran to the side where Lin Xiu walked.

According to the direction that the man just said, Lin Xiu continued to move forward.

Lin Xiu was still very curious about what the so-called raging flame lion looked like and how terrifying it was.

And according to the words of the sturdy man, there are treasures on the raging flame lion.

What kind of treasure is it that will attract so many warriors to fight for it?

“There are so many warriors here this time...” Liu Pan also heard the words of the burly man before and said aloud as if he was talking to himself while walking.

“But in that case, it might be a little troublesome.”

Qian Lin thought for a while calmly, then said.

Angie also nodded in agreement.

The warrior groups within a radius of a hundred miles have all come here, so the number of warriors is very large.

And there must be some very powerful warrior groups.

At that time, if they wanted to get a share of the pie, it would not be so easy.

“We’ll see how it goes first, if we can’t get something, we can make some money by taking a video and posting it on the warrior website too.”

Lin Xiu, who was walking in front, said with a faint smile.

“Brother Lin is right. I will take a video of those warriors besieging the raging flame lion and we’ll collect 100,000 gold coins from those who click to watch it, hehe…” Liu Pan’s eyes lit up when he thought of a way to make money.

“You think others can’t take a video too?”

Looking at the fat man’s wretched smile, An Qi couldn’t help but snort coldly.

“Then I’ll just charge less...”

Liu Pan pouted and said.

The raging flame lion only appeared once a year.

This time, the surrounding warriors all wanted to besiege it and get the treasures it hid.

Everyone continued to walk to the front and slowly, the sky began to light up.

“Xiao Qiang? Zhao Kai?”

Not long after everyone walked forward, Fat Liu seemed to have seen something and suddenly opened his eyes wide and said aloud.

Lin Xiu looked forward and found Xiao Qiang and Zhao Kai not far in front.

Didn’t these two people run away in fright before?

Why are they back now?

“They were the ones who killed them.”

At this time, Xiao Qiang and Zhao Kai pointed at Lin Xiu and the others over there at the same time and said savagely.

“What are you doing!”

At this moment, Liu Pan frowned and said with a puzzled expression.

Boom–

But at this moment, he saw a cold light emanating from their necks.

Xiao Qiang and Zhao Kai wanted to struggle, but their throats were cut!

Blood spurted out like a water column.

They fell to the ground, covered their necks and struggled constantly.

This scene was very terrifying.

Taking a closer look, it turned out that behind them, there were two men in black cloaks.

‘Hunter’!?

Seeing this scene, the pupils in Liu Pan’s eyes shrank a little and he tightly squeezed the double-sided axe in his hands and his eyes became red.

“It’s you guys who killed out people, right?”

The two men in black cloaks stared at Lin Xiu and the others.

They also have strange tattoos on their faces and their eyes were full of strong killing intent.

Qian Lin and An Qi were also nervous at this time. They had expected that they might be revenge by these ‘hunters’, but what they didn’t expect was that they came so quickly.

“Only two of you?”

Lin Xiu stared at the people in front of him, then said lightly.

The two ‘hunters’ frowned slightly when they heard Lin Xiu’s words.

Because they clearly felt a murderous aura from Lin Xiu.

Under such circumstances, he still dared to release a murderous aura against them, is he courting death?

“Tsk tsk, soon, you will be like them.”

One of the men in the black cloak looked down at Xiao Qiang and Zhao Kai, who were struggling on the ground, but in the end they died because of the blood all over the floor.
