Chapter 1039: Have You Heard of the Ye Family?

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“No. The master told us that we have to be by your side to protect you.”

One of the middle aged men answered respectfully.

“Pfft!!!”

When Bai Zhanfei heard the man’s reply, he spat out a mouthful of water.

The water then landed on the rest of the warriors.

!!

But, they still remained in their position and did not move an inch.

“Rubbish.”

“Young master, Zhang Ning and Gao Qiang would be able to get rid of that kid.”

The other warrior standing on the other side decided to speak up as well.

Although Lin Xiu has just defeated one of the sage warriors, for them, Lin Xiu must have used up all of the energy in him to do so.

Then, the remaining two sage warriors should be able to kill Lin Xiu very quickly.

Boom – –

At the same time, the sage warriors have just released powerful warrior skills headed towards the Angel, causing it fly into the distance.

Although their warrior skills were strong enough to destroy it, the Angel’s armour was made of some special material that it was impossible for them to destroy.

These two men didn’t even get to do any damages on the Angel.

They were the ones being thrown into the distance instead.

“Young man, you’re dead!”

Both the warriors glared at Lin Xiu and spoke in a threatening tone.

“We won’t know who’s dying next.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

The Angel has been attacked multiple times but there wouldn’t be any damages done to it.

Since the armour that it has on was extremely sturdy.

It was so strong that Lin Xiu, himself, couldn’t have been able to destroy it.

Both the sage warriors were still floating in the air.

As they gathered their thoughts, there were two bright lights that came from their bodies!

The bright land then slowly covered the ground. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Both of them have decided to use their domain forces.

“Domain forces huh?”

Lin Xiu watched them with his narrower eyes. Then, as he swung his right hand, there was also a bright light that came from Lin Xiu’s body.

Soon, the bright land covered the grounds beneath Lin Xiu.

It started expanding and soon, it covered the domains of the two sage warriors.

These sage warriors have been trying to use their domain forces to attack Lin Xiu.

But, at the very next moment, they realised that they couldn’t use their domain forces!

It has….disappeared!

“This! This is impossible!”

The sage warrior with the sword looked shocked.

How did his domain forces disappear?!

“This should be his domain forces.”

The other sage warrior that had the machete answered instead as he kept his eyes locked onto Lin Xiu.

They felt ever more afraid of Lin Xiu with every passing minute.

For such a young man to be so powerful, he must come from a very strong family.

“Young man, tell me. Which family are you from?”

The warrior with the machete asked Lin Xiu instead.

“Which family?”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but narrowed his eyes.

“Have you heard of the Ye family?”

Lin Xiu paused before slowly telling them the answer.

The Ye family?!

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, both of them were shocked as they pupils shrank.

“That’s impossible! The Ye family has been…”

One of them was speaking halfway when he suddenly stopped and kept his mouth shut.

“Looks like I’m the lucky one.”

Lin Xiu gave a cold laugh.

From their reaction, it was obvious that these people from the Bai family were the ones that he heard of.

The ones who have killed the entire Ye family on the Namir Planet!

His heart started racing.

As if it felt something, the bright light inside Lin Xiu’s chest that has been dimmed for a long time finally started beating again.

This bright light was the energy that he had inherited from the elder in the Tower of Trials.

“You know it as well? It’s them.”

Lin Xiu held onto his chest as he muttered to himself.

“Don’t think too much about it! If we can’t capture him alive, we’ll have to kill him!”

The sage warriors that were in the air earlier looked at each other before dashing towards Lin Xiu!

Both of their weapons were shining brightly with a golden glow.

There was also an incredibly terrifying energy that came from it.

All of them were headed towards Lin Xiu!

“Well, let’s see who’s stronger.”

Seeing how both the warriors were coming towards him with that incredibly horrifying energy, Lin Xiu smiled.

This was what he was waiting for.

With both his hands on the spear, he could feel a surge of energy coming from within him and the spear started shaking.

“Destroy it!!!”

With all the energy in his body gathered together, Lin Xiu roared in rage.

The spear in his hands gave a huge cut onto the sage warriors that were approaching him.

Boom – –

Then, the entire area started shaking once again.

There were also deafening noises that spread into the distance.

The Dark Edge drew a long arch in the air and there was a deadly energy coming from it. It immediately cut both the warriors into halves!

It was useless even with their ‘spheres’ released!

‘Heaven Breaking Strike’.

Lin Xiu has used up most of his energy by activating this warrior skill.

At the same time, the damage from this skill was deadly.

There was also a small crack in the space due to the impact.

This was all because of the warrior skill.

“They’re…..dead?!”

The rest of the warriors that were standing next to Bai Zhanfei finally steadied themselves and they were all stunned by the skill that they had just witnessed.

“Wait a minute…..that skill, what was that?!”

Bai Zhanfei might be an arrogant man but now, he was getting serious.

“That skill….I think…”

One of them thought of something and the look on their faces changed.

They started stuttering and did not dare to speak the truth, as if they were worried about something.

“I want you to speak!”

Bai Zhanfei glared at him.

“Yes, Sir. I think that the warrior skill just now looked like one of the ultimate skills of the Ye family known as the ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’.

There were droplets of sweat formed on the warrior’s forehead but he still answered as he was told.

“The Ye family?”

“The family that was known to be the strongest in the Namir Planet but was then destroyed by us.”

Bai Zhanfei gave a cold laugh when he heard the answer.

“What nonsense?”

As soon as he spoke, there was a figure that appeared in front of him.

Lin Xiu was walking towards him with the spear in his hand.

“Kid, you’re from the Ye family?”

Bai Zhanfei spoke in harsh tone while questioning Lin Xiu.
