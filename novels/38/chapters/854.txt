Chapter 855: He’s Back

Soon, the spaceship slowly took off.

An Qi, Qian Ling and Liu Pan waved from the ground.

Looking from the window, their figures were getting smaller and smaller.

Then, they slowly disappeared.

They finally arrived on earth.

“The 39th Warrior World Competition Starts Now!”

Back on earth, they were having the new Warrior World Competition.

“That brat said that he will be back a year later. Why isn’t he back yet?!”

At the same time, on one of the stages in Sky City, Baili Haoling was looking at the sky and thought of the scene from years ago as she mumbled to herself.

“No matter what, the Sacred Region Academy will be getting first!”

Ouyang Hang was standing next to Baili Haoling. He was now much more mature than before.

His abilities had improved so much more than before.

On their right, it was standing Zhang Yu and Yang Liang from the Sacred Region Academy.

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao who participated in the competition previously had already graduated which was why they couldn’t compete in this competition.

Both of them were seated on the audience seat and looked at the fight that was happening on stage.

“Next up, the Sacred Region Academy vs the Sky Academy!”

The announcer’s voice rang through the room. Baili Haoling and the rest jumped onto the stage.

“Sacred Region Academy? Just one of the noods.”

When Baili Haoling and the rest of them got onto the stage, the boys from the Sky Academy looked disdainful.

“Hmph! You shall know who the noobs are very soon.”

Ouyang Hang sneered coldly and tightened his grip on the long sword.

Baili Haoling looked at the four warriors standing opposite her and frowned.

She had already exceeded rank 9 and is now considered a warrior master.

On earth, it was already considered one of the strongest.

But for some reason, she felt that these four boys from the other part are much more dangerous than the others that she met.

What on earth was happening?!

“Competition has started!”

With that, the boys from the opposite team headed towards them.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Their figures suddenly disappeared in an instant.

Zhang Yue and Yang Liu were still trying to look for them when they suddenly saw a bright light before their eyes. Then, they body was then chopped into two halves!

Blood splattered everywhere.

Both the students from the Sacred Region Academy were killed in that instant!

“Careful!”

Baili Haoling could feel something headed towards her and quickly pushed Ouyanng Hang to the other side of the stage.

Xiu xiu – –

Two bright lights flashed across their eyes but it didn’t hit Baili Haoling and Ouyang Hang.

“Oh? Earthlings that managed to dodge our attack. It’s getting interesting.”

Those boys mumbled to themselves.

They weren’t earthlings?!

Baili Haoling, who had a good sense of hearing, was shocked as her pupil shrank.

“Time out from the Sacred Region Academy!”

Right at that moment, Baili Tao asked for a time out.

This was different from before as each time had a chance for time out.

“Whatever. You can come back whenever you want. If you have the guts to step on stage once again, we will definitely kill you.”

One of them from the Sky academy said with an evil smile on his face.

“Let’s go.”

Baili Haoling turned towards Ouyang Hang.

Ouyang Hang nodded his head and jumped off the stage with her.

His legs were turning weak.

If it wasn’t because Baili Haoling pushed him, he would have ended up like the other two. That attack would have killed him instantly.

The rest of the audience were in a frenzy.

This was the first time they had seen such a thing.

They were killed instantly!

For this year’s competition, other than surrendering, the Sky Academy will not be responsible for what happened towards their opponent.

“Haoling, what did you notice?”

Baili Haoling’s face looked extremely awful.

Her hands were clenched into a fist.

Zhang Yu and Yang Liang were both rank 8 warriors. It was surprising that they were chopped to their death instantly.

“Their abilities were stronger than me.”

Baili Haoling turned quiet and immediately said to Baili Tao.

“Stronger than you?”

After hearing what Baili Haoling said, Baili Tao pupil’s shivered.

This was because he knew Baili Haoling’s abilities were above rank 9.

It should be noted that back on earth, rank 9 warriors were already the strongest.

Baili Haoling had the abilities to breakthrough rank 9 due to certain circumstances but how was it possible that the students from the Sky Academy would be so strong?

“They….aren’t from this planet.”

Baili Haoling looked at the four students on stage and said with a solemn look on her face.

The staff have already gotten rid of the bodies of the student.

“Hu... hu...”

Ouyang Hang was still trying to catch his breath. It was terrifying to be on the line of life and death.

As he calmed down, Ouyang Hang turned towards BaiLi Tao.

“Sir, what do we do now?”

“Surrender.”

Baili Tao said to both of them.

If they were to continue to participate, they would lose their lives.

It was a fight that they would lose. There was no need for it.

“Why should we surrender?”

At that moment, a familiar yet strange voice came from behind.

Baili Haoling was stunned. She suddenly felt chills running down her spine.

She turned around and saw the familiar face that now looked a little different from before.

“I’m sorry that I came back so late.”

It was Lin Xiu who suddenly appeared.

“You brat!”

Baili Haoling widened her eyes in shock. Her double ponytail moved and threw a punch onto Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

“Ayyyyy….. We just met and you’re welcoming me with a punch.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

“Lin Xiu?! Is this really you?!”

Ouyang Hang widened his eyes in shock as he couldn’t believe his eyes.

It has been more than a year. The memories of the past from how they first met until they became friends soon flashed before his eyes.

“Lin Xiu! It really is Lin Xiu!!”

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao saw Lin Xiu walking in and both of them stood up anxiously.

“Why are you overreacting? The Sacred Region Academy will definitely lose the match!”

The audience that were next to them noticed that they were wearing combat suits with the logo from the Sacred Region Academy and were mocking the both of them.

The other party had just killed off two of the warriors from the Sacred Region Academy. With such strong abilities, the Sacred Region Academy would not have a chance.

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao completely ignored the others around them and they still looked excited.

The young man who killed a rank 9 warrior from Sky City with a long spear.

Now…he’s back!
