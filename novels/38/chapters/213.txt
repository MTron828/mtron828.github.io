Chapter 214: Level 25!!!

Pain, the icy cold energy and the blazing hot energy clashed in his body and produced countless explosions.

The immense pain caused him to frown as beads of perspiration trickled down his face.

“Use your cultivation technique.” Luo Yue advised.

“En.” Lin Xiu barely grunted out and took a deep breath. He endured the pain and started cultivating with the cultivation technique.

With the flow of the cultivation technique, Lin Xiu felt that the pain gradually grew lesser.

But the hot and cold feeling still existed.

It was not enjoyable at all.

“Gu?” Rollie poked half of its head out of Lin Xiu’s bag and looked around curiously.

They were inside a dark space with no other creatures around them.

Luo Yue sat beside Lin Xiu and used her cultivation technique as well, after all she had exhausted her stamina and source strength.

She was in need to recover.

The energy inside his body was constantly absorbed into every cell of his body through the cultivation technique.

The cold and hot sensation became even more intense.

At the same time, Lin Xiu was able to sense the experience points in his stats board moving extremely rapidly as he absorbed the energy!!!

The number kept on jumping, Lin Xiu did not know how many experience points he had gained but it was astonishing fast.

“Congratulations Master, level up! You are level 22!”

‘I’ve leveled up!?’

Lin Xiu knew that he needed 300 million experience points to level up from 21 to 22!

He only saw the experience points number jumping crazily but he did not expect himself to level up!

He investigated his stats board while constantly using the cultivation technique:

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: Level 22

Experience points: 0/400 million

Strength: 453

Physique: 235

Speed: 101

Skills: Analytic Eye, Fury, Disguise, Engulf

Rage build-up: 0/100

Remaining Potential Points: 22

Title: Rank 2 Warrior (Not active Titles: Rank 1 Warrior, Rank 3 Warrior, Rank 4 Warrior)

Overall Combat Strength: 4759

His experience points that were supposed to be at 0 started to rise again.

The number jumped to 2 digits, then to 3 digits…

Lin Xiu was overwhelmed with shock, this was the most experience point he had ever gained from absorbing energy from odd crystals.

The energy of the rank 8 odd crystal was too powerful, especially after his body had the energy of the Red Lotus Fire and was filled with fire attribute energy.

When the ice and fire collided, it seemed to produce even more energy in his body!

Lin Xiu quickly added all of his potential points to Physique.

He immediately felt much better and the pain dropped.

He focused his attention on his body.

At the same time, the experience points continued to grow.

What Lin Xiu did not know was that Engulf was being used at the same time.

There was a small string of numbers that jumped from 0.1% to 0.5%.

As time passed, Lin Xiu felt that the pain in his body slowly became numb.

When Lin Xiu opened his eyes, he realized that light was shooting in.

He felt as though his body was extremely light.

‘I absorbed…all the energy!?’

“Ding!”

“Engulf skill level up!”

‘Leveled up?!’

Lin Xiu was startled and subconsciously entered the system. He could clearly see the number LV3 beside the Engulf icon.

‘What did that mean?’

‘So Engulf is level 3 now, so what?’

Lin Xiu did not understand.

But Lin Xiu became stunned when he looked through the notifications.

There were countless strings of information. Lin Xiu hit on the notifications and lines after lines popped up.

“Congratulations Master for leveling up, you are now level 23!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Congratulations Master for leveling up, you are now level 24!”

“Congratulations Master for leveling up, you are now level 25!”

“Congratulations Master for leveling up to level 25! Awarded one chance to draw a prize!”

“Congratulations Master for leveling up! You can proceed to unlock rank 2 gene lock!”

“Congratulations Master for becoming a rank 5 warrior! Obtaining the title of rank 5 warrior!”

“….”

The flood of information gave him a headache, but he knew for a fact that he was level 25!!!

And he was a rank 5 warrior at that!

This shook Lin Xiu to the core.

It required 400 million experience points to grow from level 22 to level 23! How many more millions were required to level up to level 25?!!!

‘To provide so many experience points, how terrifying is this rank 8 odd crystal!?’

Lin Xiu thought about it, he took 3 days previously to absorb the rank 6 odd crystal but only took about a day to absorb the rank 8 odd crystal!

Lin Xiu had a feeling that it was due to the Engulf skill.

And at level 25, he seemed to have gained a new skill.

Lin Xiu immediately entered his stats.

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: Level 25

Experience points: 0/ 2 billion

Strength: 500

Physique: 270

Speed: 113

Skills: Analytic Eye, Fury, Disguise, Mirror Image

Rage build-up: 0/100

Remaining Potential Points: 72

Title: Rank 2 Warrior (Not active Titles: Rank 1 Warrior, Rank 3 Warrior, Rank 4 Warrior, Rank 5 Warrior)

Overall Combat Strength: 5124

‘Rank 5! I am a rank 5 warrior!’

Lin Xiu was ecstatic at this point.

72 Potential points, Lin Xiu added 42 points into Strength and 30 into Physique.

He immediately felt extremely comfortable after adding all the stats.

Due to the increase in strength and physique, his speed changed to 125 points.

This was the reason why Lin Xiu did not add speed, as the two other stats could influence speed, and increasing speed would not affect the other two. Its value was too low.

‘Mirror Image? What’s this?’

Lin Xiu paid attention to the new skill and his eyes lit up.
