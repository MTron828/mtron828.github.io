Chapter 644: Strengthening Fluid

Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Huuuu~ Finally won.”

Lin Xiu felt a little tired as he jumped off the stage.

“The last hit, how did you do it?”

Lin Xiu had just reached his spot at the resting area after jumping off the stage when Baili Haoling asked out of curiosity.

She had been paying attention to each and every detail during the match. She could obviously feel the amount of energy that Lin Xiu had gathered during the last attack.

‘That attack was filled with energy and at that moment, the amount was similar to a rank 9 warrior. Even if it was her, she may not be able to block it as well.

“A secret.”

Lin Xiu grinned and decided not to break the mystery.

‘That was the last hit of the system and it was only able to be so terrifying because he had triggered one of the fatal effects of the system.

Otherwise, Lin Xiu would not have been able to defeat that guy so easily without using ‘Rage’.

“Have a good rest for now. We have a more important one tonight.” Baili Haoling glared at Lin Xiu before reminding him.

“En. I’ll take a look at how Huang Zhen and Qian Yao are for now.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and walked towards the treatment room.

Baili Haoling was still confused as she couldn’t understand how he did it. She did not know how it was possible for Lin Xiu to carry out that last attack and since there was no answer to it, she decided to stop thinking about it.

As she looked up, her eyes met with the warriors from the Sky Academy who were about to go on stage. Then, she saw someone familiar amongst them that caused her facial expression to change.

“Are you alright?”

As soon as Lin Xiu walked into the treatment room, he immediately saw Huang Zhen and Qian Yao. They were both sitting on the chair at the side of the room and their wounds have been tended. The wounds were now covered with a white gauze.

“Tm fine.”

Huang Zheng and Qian Yao smiled as they saw Lin Xiu.

“Did you win?”

Ouyang Hang, who had come in earlier to check on them, quickly asked Lin Xiu when he saw him walking in.

Although he could clearly see from Lin Xiu’s appearance that they have won, he still wanted to make sure that it was true.

“Of course.”

Lin Xiu chuckled.

“Hmph! I thought that you wouldn’t be able to win that block of muscles.”

Ouyang Hang noticed how happy Lin Xiu and he couldn’t help but ‘roast’ Lin Xiu.

He could feel that his abilities were much more behind than Lin Xiu. Lin Xiu’s progress was too fast.

He was a monster!

Ouyang Hang said to himself deep inside.

“I didn’t think that those from the Interstellar Academy would use such dirty tricks. This would explain why our seniors were…”

Huang Zhen thought of something as he was speaking and his eyes turned red.

Qian Yao clenched onto his fist as well.

“But…no matter what, he’s already dead now. Thank you for taking revenge for us, Lin Xiu.”

Qian Yao took a deep breath to calm himself down before thanking Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu quickly shook his head and said, “You don’t have to say that.”

“According to the schedule, we will be in the finals tonight at 1pm. I’m sure that the Sky Academy would be able to win this match which means that we will be fighting them tonight.”

Lin Xiu took a good look at them before asking.

“Can you guys do it?”

“Sure. We have already used the best recovery serum and in about 2 hours, the wounds should be completely healed. We’ll be able to fight again by tonight.”

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao nodded their heads after hearing Lin Xiu’s questions.

“Alright. That’s good then.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Itll be a tough one.” Ouyang Hang couldn’t help but gasp as he thought of how they would be fighting the Sky Academy next. He felt restless already.

He was familiar with those from the Sky Academy. In that team, he would not be able to fight them alone no matter who it was.

This is because the team from the Sky Academy was incredibly powerful.

“What’s wrong? You’re afraid now?”

This was the first time that Lin Xiu was acting so demotivated. He was already giving up before the fight which was why Lin Xiu had decided to trigger him.

“Who’s afraid of them?!”

Ouyang Hang suddenly jumped out of his chair like a cat whose tail had been stepped on.

They used to be enemies and even when their relationship was much better now, he still didn’t want to be looked down upon by Lin Xiu.

“It’s just that I’m not someone who likes to lie. I know how much I can take. It’s just too much.”

Ouyang Hang was initially triggered but as soon as he thought of those from the Sky Academy, he couldn’t help but feel defeated.

“We’ll try our best.”

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao said together.

“En, Let’s rest in the resting room for now. We’ll gather at the audience seat around 9:30.”

Lin Xiu took a look at the time and saw that they still had time for a good rest.

He could even have time to absorb a few more odd crystals so that his strength could recover.

As he got back to his own room, Lin Xiu felt that something wasn’t right, the look in his eyes changed immediately. He grabbed onto his spear and aimed it at one of the comers.

Clang–

The tip of his spear seemed to have collided with another weapon as it let out a loud sound.

“Oh my….little brother, why are you so heated?”

Just when Lin Xiu was about to continue his attack, he heard a familiar sound from behind.

As he took a closer look, there was a white figure that stood in front of him.

“Luo Yue’s sister?”

‘When Lin Xiu saw that it was Luo Yan, he was stunned.

After the encounter with the assassin from the Zhuo family, Lin Xiu had his guards up at all times. Although he had already made sure that there was no one inside his room, Lin Xiu still felt that something wasn’t right which was why he decided to attack.

He didn’t think that Luo Yuess sister would be inside the room.

“Tm sorry.”

Lin Xiu felt awkward. Previously she was here because Luo Yue told her to protect him which was why Lin Xiu thought that Luo Yan was here again to do the same. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Don’t assume anything. I am not your bodyguard.”

It was as if Luo Yan could read his mind as she said to him with a sweet smile on her face.

“Then…”

“For the match later, it may be a little difficult. You’ll need help.”

Luo Yan looked at Lin Xiu as she suggested.

Help?

After hearing what she said, Lin Xiu was confused.

Before Lin Xiu could say anything, Luo Yan took out a bottle of potion for her pocket and passed it to Lin Xiu.

“Strengthening fluid. Take it and within an hour, your body strength would be at its peak.”

“But, there are some drawbacks. It would be extremely difficult for you to have any breakthrough in your progress for the next few months.”

“Their strength is still a level above yours. With your current abilities, you may not be able to win..”
