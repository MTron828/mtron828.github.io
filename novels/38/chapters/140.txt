Chapter 141: Students Of The Sacred Region Academy

Soon, it was the next morning and when Lin Xiu opened his eyes, he found himself and Luo Yue with their backs together, sleeping this way all night.

Luo Yue probably felt that Lin Xiu had woken up and opened her eyes too.

“Er… have your wounds healed?” Lin Xiu asked a little awkwardly.

Luo Yue shook her head.

This injury was really nothing compared to what she had experienced before.

The weather was still scorching hot and the sun was out early in the morning.

“Are you going to the Sacred region academy?” Lin Xiu asked Luo Yue.

“Yes,” she said.

“By the way, do you know the way?” Lin Xiu was pleasantly surprised at this time.

He thought she should know the direction to the Sacred region academy and if he went with her, he could avoid getting lost and walking around the desert aimlessly.

Luo Yue pointed to the area in front then picked up her long sword, and walked in that direction.

“Wait for me!” Lin Xiu quickly carried his backpack and spear box and caught up to Luo Yue.

It wasn’t easy to find someone who knew the way and he didn’t want to stay in the desert any longer.

It has been more than a week.

At this moment, Rollie also climbed out of Lin Xiu’s backpack, then stood on Lin Xiu’s shoulder. It rolled on his shoulder and laid down.

“You’ve grown much stronger.” Luo Yue who hasn’t said much suddenly spoke up while they were walking in this desert.

“Of course, don’t you know who I am?” Lin Xiu said with a triumphant tone.

Looking like his tail was about to reach the sky.

“But still not good enough.” Just when Lin Xiu was delighted, Luo Yue’s words instantly gave Lin Xiu a blow.

After walking for some time, Lin Xiu could see a forest up ahead!

But unlike the Azure forest, the trees looked normal.

It was about the same as the forest that he walked out from in Xing Yao city.

“It’s just in front?” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue.

“Almost.” Luo Yue nodded.

They continued walking and finally got out of this seemingly endless desert and reached the forest.

The surrounding air was very fresh that Lin Xiu couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

Feels great!

But the moment they stepped into this jungle, they heard a strange buzzing sound and Lin Xiu knitted his brows.

Bang––

At this moment, Luo Yue seemed to have found something and her long sword slashed across, cutting down a large tree directly.

In that tree, there was also a worm that had a body that looked like a branch and was cut into two.

“Be careful, there’s a Color-changing Bamboo Worm.” Luo Yue glanced around and said.

Color-changing Bamboo Worm?

Lin Xiu activated the Analytic eye to look at the body of the Color-changing Bamboo Worm and was surprised to find that this thing was a rank 3 evolved beast. It could bring about severe pain, was often hidden in trees and the average person wouldn’t really notice it.

“Tsk tsk, seems like it wouldn’t be so easy for you guys to get to the Sacred region academy.” Lin Xiu heard a ruckus ahead.

When he looked over, he suddenly saw three familiar figures.

“Kong Haotian, what do you mean by that, huh!!” Zhang Yin looked at the five figures standing in front of him and gritted his teeth as he spoke.

Behind him, Lei Lei and Jiang Li looked at them with caution.

“Nothing much, just heard that the Sacred region academy is going to have a freshmen test and I’m trying to get rid of my competitors first.” The guy, known as Kong Haotian, stared at Zhang Yin and smiled.

“You want to kill me?” Zhang Yin knitted his brows at this time.

He traveled so many days and finally arrived here, he simply couldn’t let himself get killed just like that!

“Tsk tsk, don’t keep talking about killing, it sounds so horrible ah.” Kong Haotian shook his head, then continued, “Just clearing some garbage for the Sacred region academy.”

“You…!” Hearing Kong Haotian’s words, the hot-tempered Jiang Li tightened his grip around his weapon. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Do you know each other?” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

“Kind of.” Lin Xiu nodded.

Then, Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment before he continued moving forward.

“It looks quite lively here.” Lin Xiu walked over while stretching.

As Lin Xiu and Luo Yue walked toward them, the eyes of the warriors turned to them.

And they saw Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

A young guy and girl. The girl’s face was ice-cold but beautiful.

The guy was also good-looking and looked like a dashing prince.

Both of them looked like a match made in heaven as they slowly made their way over.

“Senior!!!” Zhang Yin and the others saw Lin Xiu’s figure and were very surprised.

Senior!?

Hearing Zhang Yin’s words, Kong Haotian’s gaze changed.

“They’re my friends, give me some face and let them go.” Lin Xiu glanced at Kong Haotian and the others at this moment and said with a smile.

At this moment, he activated the Analytic Eye and could tell that these five people were rank 3 warriors, their combat strength was also more than 3,000.

Luo Yue’s injury hasn’t healed yet and he had used up quite a bit of energy the night before and had not recovered.

If they had to fight now, they would probably be at a disadvantage.

“Let them go? Hahaha!” Kong Haotian looked at Lin Xiu and found that Lin Xiu’s aura was quite weak like a rank 1 warrior which made him laugh uncontrollably.

It was as if he had just heard the funniest joke in the world.

“Tsk tsk, Haotian, this girl is not bad, why don’t we let them go and make this girl stay?” These guys were now looking at Luo Yue.

It was the first time they had seen such a beautiful girl and it really made their hearts itch.

“Senior, they’re also students from the Sacred region academy.” Zhang Yin said respectfully to Lin Xiu.

“You too?” Lin Xiu was surprised and asked.

“Yes,” Zhang Yin nodded.

“Tsk tsk, let me think about it.” Just then, Kong Haotian walked toward Luo Yue without any fear and reached out to touch her face. Suddenly, a cold light flashed by.

Swish——

It sounded as if even the air had been cut and Kong Haotian immediately retracted his hand.

At this moment, he broke out in cold sweat – how could someone be so fast?

His fingers were almost sliced off!
