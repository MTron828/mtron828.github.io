Chapter 566: The Tower of Trials AKA Tower of Death

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The Tower of Trials was located on the highest ground of the academy.

Lin Xiu could see the black tower from far, hidden amongst the clouds.

Compared to the Tower of the Tournaments, there were much fewer people gathered here. It could also be said that he could barely see people walking around this tower.

“Lin Xiu!” As Lin Xiu was walking towards the tower, a familiar voice stopped him.

When he turned towards the direction from where the voice was coming from, it was Zhang Yin who called him.

“Zhang Yin?” Lin Xiu was stunned as he didn’t think that he would be here.

“You’re back? Damn… you didn’t even come to visit us.” Zhang Yin gave a soft punch on Lin Xiu’s shoulder and laughed.

“I just came back last night.” Lin Xiu laughed as well.

“I live right over there.” Zhang Yin pointed at the area behind him.

“Oh…. Did you move recently?”

“No. I just wanted to take a look there.” Lin Xiu shook his head and pointed at the Tower of Trial.

The tower was tall and with its sharp, black appearance, it was difficult for one to miss it.

“The Tower of Trials?” Zhang Yin looked in the direction at which Lin Xiu pointed to and was in shock.

He had a stern look on his face. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“What’s wrong?” Lin Xiu asked when he noticed the change of expression on Zhang Yin’s face.

“I heard from the others that there were quite a lot of people that died in that tower.” Zhang Yin lowered his voice.

“You better be careful.”

“Don’t worry about it. I’m just there to have a look.” Lin Xiu smiled.

“Alright. You should go ahead. I’ll pay a visit when I’m back.” Lin Xiu patted his shoulder.

After bidding goodbye to Zhang Yin, Lin Xiu continued walking towards the tower.

Lin Xiu started looking more serious as he got closer and tightly gripped onto his spear.

He has heard of it previously that the Tower of Trial was also known as the Death Tower. Most of the students from the academy who have heard of how the others have died usually wouldn’t go close to the tower.

Soon, Lin Xiu reached the Tower of Trial.

Although there was a smaller crowd here, there were still students gathered around the tower.

Since a bigger risk meant a bigger opportunity.

Compared to the Tower of Tournament, there was a huge gate at the bottom of the Tower of Trials and there were guards from the academy guarding the area.

“Please show your passcard.” Lin Xiu was about to enter when one of the guards stopped him.

After hearing what the guard said, Lin Xiu took out the card that the Dean had given him earlier.

The staff took the card from him and placed it on top of a machine until a loud ‘beep’ was heard. Then, the huge gates opened.

“Oh? Looks like we have a newcomer.” As Lin Xiu walked into the tower, most of them turned around and laughed at Lin Xiu.

There were only at most 6 of them and there weren’t many students there.

As Lin Xiu got closer, there was a huge screen that was being displayed. It showed the number of people who challenged the Tower of Trials and it also showed which level they were currently at.

On the side, it showed the records of the highest level challenges.

Those who successfully got to the 100th floor were already students from eight years ago. This meant that for the past few years, there wasn’t a single student who managed to get to the highest level. Suddenly, Lin Xiu noticed that there was a huge ‘X’ marked next to one of the students who was challenging the 23th floor.

He failed?!

“Young boy, let me tell you what it means. That means that he failed and has died.” One of the students around noticed what Lin Xiu was looking at. When he saw the red ‘X’, he explained to Lin Xiu what it was.

Dead?

“In the Tower of Trials, there is a chance that you might die. If you aren’t good enough, you should leave.” The man continued.

As soon as he was done, there was another door that blasted open and there was a man who walked out of the tower, covered with blood.

“Ah Jin!”

There was another man nearby who seemed to be waiting for this particular man. As soon as he saw his companion coming out covered in blood, he quickly rushed forward and carried him.

“Ahem… Ahem… 53th. I don’t think I can go any higher.” The man who had just come out of the tower looked pale due to the major blood loss.

“It’s fine.” His companion comforted him.

“But at least I got a rank 8 odd crystal. Better than nothing.” The man smiled as he tried to withstand the pain from the injuries that were all over his body.

Rank 8 crystals?

Lin Xiu was shocked as well as he overheard their conversation.

Looks like there were rewards as well if you passed the levels.

“From what you just saw, the higher the level, the better the rewards.” Then, the only girl who was at the tower walked towards Lin Xiu.

“Hi, my name is Qu Tingting.” The girl smiled as he introduced himself.

“Hi. Lin Xiu.” He replied as well.

Qu Tingting was not a girl that was extremely pretty but she seemed friendly and kind, those that made you comfortable and would take her as an elder sister.

“I know you.” Qu Tingting smiled and said.

“The best of the First Years.”

“That’s not true.” Lin Xiu said modestly.

“I’m in my third year now. You can call me Tingting or Senior Qu.” She smiled and it was obvious that she was much nicer than everyone else in the tower.

“Senior Qu, have you ever challenged the Tower of Trials?”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“I have only been here once and managed to reach the 20th level.” Qu Tingting said regretfully.

“Tsktsk….with your abilities, it’s already pretty good that you reached the 20th level.” The man, who was acting arrogant a while ago, overheard their conversation and chirped in.

“Ignore him. He’s always here to make fun of the newcomers.” Qu Tingting ignored the man and spoke to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was bothered at all. He was now in a better mood than before.

“With your abilities, it shouldn’t be a problem for you to reach the 20th floor.I was really lucky back then and even got a diamond-level warrior skill card.”

Qu Tingting continued speaking to Lin Xiu.

“Do I just go in directly?” Lin Xiu looked at the tower and asked.

“Just go in from the entrance over there. Since it’s your first time here, you would have to start from the first level. After that, you would be able to start from the ones that you have failed.”

“While challenging the tower, there is a chance where you would get something known as the Challenge Card. You would need one every time you enter the tower..”
