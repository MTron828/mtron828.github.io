Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

Luo Yue instinctively wanted to resist Baili Haoling’s attack.

But Baili Haoling’s attack was really too strong, this palm contained a powerful force, and Luo Yue was directly flew out!

Seeing this scene, the surrounding audience immediately burst into an uproar.

‘What a powerful force.

Luo Yue looked at the scene on the competition stage, she didn’t feel anything about her being out, but she was relieved.

If it was before, she would have no scruples in fighting against Lin Xiu, but now…

“Damn!”

At this moment, Yu Muchen saw that Luo Yue was knocked into the air, and his expression changed slightly.

Originally, a four-on-one match would definitely be able to crush Baili Haoling, but now without Luo Yue, it was three-on-one, he didn’t know whether Baili Haoling still had hidden strength.

“Tyrant Heaven first form!!!”

At this time, Yu Muchen held the huge halberd in both hands, and the moment he rushed over, his body leaped up, the weapon was full of terrifying source power, and he directly attacked the Baili Haoling below!

His move was extremely powerful and fast, and at this moment, it was about to hit Baili Haoling’s body!

The expression in Baili Haoling’s eyes changed slightly, and she directly held the double knives to block.

Boom—

With a loud noise, Baili Haoling’s body seemed to fly out because she couldn’t bear the huge pressure.

“Humph!” Looking at Baili Haoling who flew out, but did not fly out of the field, Yu Muchen snorted coldly, then looked at Chen Jin and another man, “Kill her.”

For Yu Muchen, men and women were the same, they wont give up killing because of their cute appearance.

Lin Xiu and her are going to die!

Chen Jin and a warrior nodded, then looked at Baili Haoling and was about to rush over.

At this time, Baili Haoling had many wounds on her body, and her battle suit was torn open. She lowered her head and held her arm.

“Hehehe.”

As soon as Chen Jin and one of the men rushed over, she heard a strange laugh.

Clack clack-—

If you take a closer look at this time, Baili Haoling’s body seems to have slowly undergone some kind of change, and a very powerful source strength erupted from her body.

“Go to hell!”

Chen Jin took the long sword in his hand and was about to stab Baili Haoling in the head!

But at this moment, Baili Haoling looked up at him.

Chen Jin saw Baili Haoling who had just raised her head, and the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

Because now Baili Haoling seems to be a different person. She seemed to have become a little more mature and taller than before.

Most importantly, her pupils tuned blood red, which made people have goosebumps.

But at this time, it was too late for him to do anything else. The long sword in his hand pierced through, and he was going to pierce her head!

“Ohno!”

‘When Bai Litao saw Baili Haoling’s expression in the field, his expression changed greatly.

“Dean Baili, the competition on the rooftop cannot be interfered with.”

‘The deputy dean of the Sky Academy seemed to have heard Bai Litao’s words at this time, thinking that Bai Litao was afraid of Baili Haoling’s death, and said with a sneer.

As long as Bai Litao dares to leave his seat to stop the battle below, he will immediately stand up to stop him.

“Dumbass!”

Bai Litao glanced at the vice president of Sky Academy, and said coldly.

“You…!”

Hearing Bai Litao’s words, the vice president of Sky Academy’s expression became extremely ugly.

But now Bai Litao was not doing anything, he snorted coldly, and continued to look at the platform.

Seeing that the long sword in Chen Jin’s hand was about to stab Baili Haoling, but at this moment, Baili Haoling swung the weapon in her hand, and the strong force made the long sword in Chen Jin’s hand fly out!

Chen Jin’s eyes widened, and his eyes were full of horror.

His own long sword was knocked into the air!?

Before he could react, Baili Haoling slashed at him with the long sword in both hands!

‘sphere!!!

Chen Jin was covered in cold sweat, and directly released the ‘Sphere.

Bang bang bang-

The long knife slashed on the ‘Sphere’, making a loud noise.

Pf

Although Baili Haoling’s double knives didn’t slash on his body, the powerful impact still made him feel his blood surging.

He tasted something sweet in his throat and a mouthful of blood was released!

“Die!”

At the same time, another warrior from sky city also rushed towards Baili Haoling! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Boom—

But when he attacked Baili Haoling with a weapon from behind, he found that Baili Haoling instantly opened a ‘Sphere!

This ‘Sphere’ was different from the general ‘Sphere’, it was actually a blue light.

Boom–

‘When his weapon attacked Baili Haoling’s ‘Sphere’, a powerful energy seemed to burst out from, causing his body to fly straight out.

At this time, Baili Haoling ignored the man, holding the two knives in her hands, she continued to attack Chen Jin frantically!

Even though Chen Jin had unfolded the ‘Sphere’, Baili Haoling’s attack was too ferocious. The impact of the long knife on the ‘Sphere’ caused his body to keep retreating.

‘What’s even more terrifying is that Baili Haoling’s pupils are now blood red, which makes him even more afraid.

“Stop… [admit..”

At this time, Chen Jin felt that his ‘Sphere’ seemed to be broken, and there were obvious cracks on it. If it went on like this, he would be dead!

“Those who want to kill me… have no chance.”

Baili Haoling let out a strange laugh. It seemed that because of the influence of a powerful source strength, a red glow appeared on her double knives.

Boom–

In the next moment, Chen Jin’s ‘Sphere’ was directly smashed as she swung her two knives.

“You…”

‘There was extreme fear in Chen Jin’s eyes.

Whoosh whoosh—

But before he could say anything, he seemed to see countless cold lights in his eyes.

‘What followed was an extremely bloody scene.

This Chen Jin, whose whole body was stripped of flesh and blood, was directly chopped up by Baili Haoling’s long knife.

His bones were still standing there, without a trace of blood on them.

‘The audience around them all widened their eyes and couldn’t even say a word, as if they were all dumbfounded by this scene.

“Next, it’s you guys’ turn.”

Baili Haoling held the blood-stained long knife, pointed at the warrior of the Sky Academy not far away, and Yu Muchen said aloud.

“You… who the hell are you!?”

The man in the Sky City trembled at this moment, and even Yu Muchen was shocked at this moment..
