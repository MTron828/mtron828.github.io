Chapter 975: Stele

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Ma Jin stared at Lin Xiu as he continued trying to provoke Lin Xiu.

“If you’re done, you can leave now.”

Lin Xiu completely ignored what Ma Jin had said before and told him to leave.

“What do you mean?!”

Ma Jin frowned and the look on his face had changed completely.

Suddenly, all of the warriors who were standing behind him started gathering around Lin Xiu.

“Are you looking down on me?”

Ma Jin gave a cold laugh.

“Don’t think that you’re great just because you defeat two people from the Divine Domain…”

Xiu – –

Before he could finish what he started, Lin Xiu was already standing right in front of him.

At the same time, Lin Xiu raised his right hand and had his index finger placed next to Ma Jin’s temples.

There was a bright light at the tip of the finger and it was because of the source energy that was gathered at the tip.

“Do you have a death wish?”

Lin Xiu asked bluntly.

With one snap, he would be able to pierce through his brain.

Ma Jin’s body started shaking tremendously.

He could now clearly feel that Lin Xiu was much stronger than he had expected.

Plus, the light that was gathered at the tip of the finger may look small but the energy coming from it was much scarier than it is to the eyes.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu looked at Wang Qiang before taking away his hands.

They were about to enter the sage warrior space and it didn’t seem nice to be killing anyone now.

“En.”

Wang Qiang looked at Ma Jin, whose body was now shaking tremendously, as he walked away with Lin Xiu.

“He’s…..so strong…”

Ma Jin was no longer arrogant like he was before. His body was shaking uncontrollably as he mumbled to himself.

The strength that was coming from Lin Xiu earlier was enough to break his soul.

“How are you so arrogant?!”

Lin Xiu and Wang Qiang were walking away when two of the warriors had rushed forward with weapons in their hands, ready to attack Lin Xiu!

They weren’t standing close to Lin Xiu earlier which was why they couldn’t feel how horrifying Lin Xiu actually was.

Plus, they were respected warriors.

They had transferred all of their source energy onto their weapons and they were now glowing brightly.

“Leave.”

However, Lin Xiu had only raised his hands in the air and both the men’s bodies were then stuck in midair.

Boom – –

With a loud explosion, the bodies of the men who tried to attack Lin Xiu immediately exploded in the air.

Ma Jin was shocked when he saw what happened and took a huge gulp.

He was first in the western part of the planet?! If he did attack Lin Xiu, he would be dead by now.

As he thought about it, there were chills running down his spine.

At the same time, all of the warriors around were looking at Lin Xiu with fear.

Now, no one else dared to stop Lin Xiu.

Anyone who saw them would subconsciously move out of the way.

“Who’s stirring up trouble here?!”

A loud voice came from another side.

As they turned around, there was an elder dressed in a customised combat suit walking towards them.

“It’s Elder Yi!”

When the warriors saw who it was, all of them started whispering to each other.

This elder was responsible for opening the portal to the sage warrior space and he was someone respectable.

“They murdered two warriors!”

Some of the warriors who were friends with the two victims earlier pointed at Lin Xiu and screamed out loud.

“They were the ones who attacked us first.”

Wang Qiang got anxious and quickly rebutted after hearing what the other warriors were saying.

They were the ones who were at fault!

“Do you know what the consequences are for killing warriors in the top 100?”

Elder Yi looked at Lin Xiu and asked in a cold tone.

“It was merely self defence.”

Lin Xiu answered calmly.

“Plus, there must be drones around that caught what happened earlier. Just take a look at it.”

Those men who wanted to accuse Lin Xiu of murdering another warrior started looking worried.

They have completely forgotten that there were drones flying above their heads.

The drones would have captured everything that had happened earlier.

“Are you sure that he was the one who started it?”

Elder Yi turned towards those who were making the complaints earlier.

Those who were extremely confident earlier when saying that Lin Xiu was the murderer suddenly kept quiet.

“Hmph! Rubbish!”

Elder Yi sighed and left.

“We will be meeting soon.”

Lin Xiu looked at the warriors from earlier and said to them softly.

In their current situation, it would be best to avoid any confrontation or conflict since he wanted to get into the sage warrior space.

Initially, he wanted to enter the space so that he could become a sage warriors but he no longer needed it now.

His goal now was to find the Angel’s Tears so that he can exchange it for the Orchid of Heaven.

Most of the top 100 warriors from the Tianjiao Competition had arrived and one of the staff led them to another place.

It was an empty ground that seemed to be abandoned.

There were a large amount of skulls seen all over the ground.

There were weapons that were rusty and damaged from the wear and tear after being here for a long time.

“Welcome, Sage Warrior Chang Yue!”

“Welcome, Sage Warrior Yi Changkong!”

“Welcome, Sage Warrior Xiong Wan!”

Then, there was a loud, clear voice that came from one corner. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu looked over to the place where the voice was coming from and he could see that there were sage warriors that had arrived like meteors.

There were a total of ten sage warriors that arrived.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but narrowed his eyes as he looked at what was happening before him.

There were ten sage warriors here!”

“You are the top 100 warriors from the Tianjiao Competition.”

“Before entering the space, please place your hand on this Tianjiao Stele.”

Yi Changkong, who was also known as Yi Chengkong, stood in the centre amongst the sage warriors and he looked at the warriors standing before him.

After hearing what he said, all of them had subconsciously turned towards the thing that was right beside his leg.

They could all see that it was a huge stone stele.

As Yi Chengkong waved his right hand, he wiped away all of the dust that had accumulated on the stele.

That’s when the stele gave out a bright white glow.

“Whenever I call your names, come over here and touch the stele.”

“Zhang Yue!”

“Sun Hou!”

As Yi Chankong read out the names of the warriors from a long list, those who were called had walked forward and placed their hands on the stele.

With their hands on the stele, their names immediately appeared on it!
