Chapter 32: Victory!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu neither dodged nor avoided the punch, but instead, he erupted with immense power from both legs. He shot forward like a bullet and launched a fist on his own against Tang Tian!

In that instant, Lin Xiu activated his skill Fury!

Power, speed, physique, all of them increased exponentially when Fury was activated.

“He doesn’t have a spear and still dares to collide head-on?” Li Yuan’s eyes were spewing with venom as he questioned in slight envy.

He did not expect Lin Xiu to be so strong and actually force Tang Tian, a top 100 ranker to the point of consuming forbidden medicine.

“Tang Tian consumed forbidden medicine, I think that this match needs to stop.” Luo Li spoke to Mr. Ye.

He was more and more shocked by Lin Xiu’s performance. Over the past few days, this last place student had brought about too much surprise.

According to the talent and aptitude he had displayed, he was bound to be a powerful being. It would be a great pity if he was to be beaten to death by Tang Tian there and then.

“Does the martial arts battle forbid the use of Alps?” Liu Bai glanced at Luo Li in diametrical opposition to each other.

Tang Tian’s usage of the forbidden medicine had surprised him as well. He initially believed that Tang Tian could get rid of Lin Xiu right away. Who would have thought that the situation would develop into such a situation?

But it did not matter, the improved Alps was unlike the old version, although the damage on the body would be severe, it was no longer as severe and serious to the point of being crippled and no longer being able to become a warrior.

“Let’s watch on.” Mr. Ye chuckled, then he moved his eyes back onto the battle.

He squinted his eyes. The Awe of the Phoenix unleashed by Lin Xiu had surprised him too, he had never seen such a skill before.

“Bang!”

Lin Xiu and Tang Tian’s fists collided and produced a powerful sound.

The two clenched their teeth and exerted all their strength.

“What is going on?” The spectators were dumbstruck by the scene, Tang Tian’s Rupturing Fist was actually matched with Lin Xiu’s punch!

Rupturing Fist was considered one of the strongest bronze fist skills, how was Lin Xiu able to withstand it?

Without waiting for their shock to subside, Lin Xiu and Tang Tian clashed once again!

Collision after collision, every punch landed on the opponent’s body and produced loud sounds from the impact of fist and flesh.

Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up like a torch, and he clenched his fists tightly as he unleashed a barrage of attacks on Tang Tian’s body.

Due to the effects of the forbidden medicine, Tang Tian’s body had swelled to an immense size and was extremely sturdy.

“Go and die! Go and die!” Tang Tian was already crazy, how could he be forced into such a state by trash?

And under the eyes of thousands of peers!

He was already in a crazy state, if he did not kill Lin Xiu, it would be a lifetime of humiliation!

He unleashed even faster attacks like a torrential storm on Lin Xiu.

Rupturing fist was indeed a powerful fist technique and even when guarded against, the victim would feel immense pain as though the muscles were about to rip apart.

But under the state of Fury, Lin Xiu’s physique had improved substantially, which meant that he could withstand the attacks!

After withstanding Tang Tian’s fist, Lin Xiu punched Tang Tian’s chest.

An intense sound came out again.

Fury’s duration was short and if it disappeared, it was over for him!

Lin Xiu increased his offense and unleashed even more punches!

“My fist skill is the strongest!” Seeing that Lin Xiu was attacking him, Tang Tian roared and poured all of his source energy into his fists!

Rupturing fists with source strength!

When he unleashed his fists, everyone could hear the friction between his fists and the air!

“Have a taste of my Rupturing Fist!” Lin Xiu did not dodge and roared out loud as he unleashed his right fist as well!

“Rupturing fist? No way?!” A few students were jolted by Lin Xiu’s roar.

Legend has it that there was a fist skill that was in the bronze category, but the power it contained was equivalent to a silver skill, that was Rupturing Fist!

“Impossible, if it truly is Rupturing fist, he would already be dead!” A student cried out.

The reason why no one practiced this skill was that it could self-harm even before inflicting damage on the opponent. Almost anyone who practiced this skill suffered shaking damage to their internal organs. There was even a student that died while practicing this, so no one was willing to do so!

On the stage, Lin Xiu turned his body the moment Tang Tian’s fist came towards him and avoided the strike. He unleashed his own punch that landed squarely on Tang Tian’s shoulder!

“You think your punch can break through my defense!” Tang Tian laughed sinisterly.

After consuming Alps, his muscles had grown to a terrifying extent!

Much less a fist, even a spear would not harm him that easily!

“Who says it won’t kill you if it doesn’t break through your defense?” Lin Xiu sneered.

“What...” Tang Tian’s eyes constricted as he suddenly felt pain all over his body.

When he crossed fists with Lin Xiu, there was initially no pain whatsoever. But after the impact, he felt pain all over his body.

“Bang, Bang, Bang.” Countless loud bumps could be heard.

All of his internal organs and flesh had ruptured!

This was the characteristic of Rupturing Fist! It overlooked the defense on the exterior and caused internal injuries directly!

“You…” Tang Tian opened his eyes wide and blood spilled out from his mouth. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Tang Tian’s body dropped to the ground with a loud thud. His eyes remained wide open, but he seemed to have already died.

“Sorry, I won.”

The entire hall had become silent and even a drop of a needle could be heard.

“He won!” Ye Shuang’er looked at the silent and shocked crowd and squealed out loud.

The surrounding was quiet and Ye Shuang’er scream woke a few of them up.

“This… isn’t a dream?”

“The trash Lin Xiu won???”

“Damn! Am I still sleeping!”

The majority of the crowd looked on in disbelief, but Class 29 was in immeasurable joy as they screamed for Lin Xiu’s name.

“Go and die.”

Because there was no notification from the system, it meant that Tang Tian was still alive.

Lin Xiu looked at Tang Tian on the ground and raised his right leg up with the intention of trampling on his head!
