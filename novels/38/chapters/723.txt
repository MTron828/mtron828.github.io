Chapter 724 Taking Over?!

The skeleton…..spoke?!

When Lin Xiu heard the voice, the expression on his face changed.

As he looked at it carefully, there were suddenly two blue flames that appeared inside the eyes of the skeleton.

It was as if the skeleton was staring at Lin Xiu.

“I am the king-level warrior….the king of the Ice and Snow City…” “I haven’t been able to breakthrough after cultivating for three hundred years and have died once again…..”

“I have the ice and snow skills and I would be able to pass it on to whoever gets here…”

The voice came from the skeleton and Lin Xiu was surprised. This skeleton could talk!

“Inherit it…”

The Skeleton slowly raised its arm and reached out towards Lin Xiu.

“What does that mean? Do you want me to put mine on top of yours?” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but ask when he saw what was happening.

He has never seen how an ‘inheritance’ took place. Lin Xiu has never had any knowledge about these things back on earth which was why he was still a little confused seeing what was happening.

The thing that he lacked most now was a strong warrior skill and something more powerful.

With his strength that increased, the skills that he had before were still strong as his power grew but it still wasn’t enough.

“Inherit it…”

However, the skeleton kept repeating the same word and it wasn’t saying anything else.

Lin Xiu thought about it carefully and thought that there wouldn’t be any danger. He reached out his right hand and touched the skeleton.

Koong Loong – –

As soon as they touched, the entire palace lit up with a bright light!

The light was so bright that Lin Xiu had to close his eyes.

Suddenly, there was a large ball of energy that was in blue that came towards Lin Xiu.

Soon, the energy gathered together and formed a human figure. It looked exactly like a human!

“Hahahahaha! There’s finally someone here!”

A loud voice rang throughout the hall.

Lin Xiu took a good look at it and there was a middle-aged man that was tall and muscular that stood right above the skeleton who was laughing

Lin Xiu had a bad feeling about it when he saw the man and wanted to remove his hand. However, he noticed that his hands were glued together with the skeleton and he couldn’t even pull them away!

“En? You’re just a rank 9 warrior?”

As the energy gathered together, the middle-aged man that was translucent looked at Lin Xiu and frowned.

“You are only a rank 9 warrior and you made it here.”

“But you’re young. That’s good enough!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The man sneered. Then, the man who was like a spirit immediately rushed towards Lin Xiu’s body.

His entire soul entered into Lin Xiu’s physical body.

This man was trying to take over his body!

Lin Xiu widened his eyes in shock as his black spear fell onto the ground. The look in his eyes slowly turned lost. His head hurts as well.

Damn it….this fella…..it seems like he’s trying to take over his body and engulf his soul…

This was something that he didn’t imagine.

All of these were supernatural things that Lin Xiu had never imagined.

“Hehehe…..soon, I will be the master of this body. I shall be revived…”

“Ding!”

“Foreign energy noted. ‘Engulf’ has been activated…”

“AHHHHH!!!!!”

Then, the warrior king noted that he wasn’t engulfing Lin Xiu’s soul. Instead, his soul was being absorbed by something peculiar inside this boy’s body!

Lin Xiu, who was frozen and stunned, came back to his senses.

He could still see the struggling man inside his mind.

“Who are you?! Let me go!” The middle-aged man started screaming. “If that’s the case, the inheritance is just a trap. You just wanted to take over another person’s body?!

Lin Xiu looked at the middle-aged man inside his mind and said.

The system continued activating ‘Engulf’ and it was running by 1%…..2%…..3%…

Since ‘Engulf’ could level up everything he used, the speed at which the skill was being activated was getting faster as well.

As for the soul inside his body, it was getting thinner and thinner.

“Let me go! Let me go! I’ll tell you….I’ll tell you where the real treasure is. You can look for it….”

The middle-aged man who was actually a spirit looked as if he was undergoing something horribly scary and started screaming madly. “Enguld…everything!”

Lin Xiu ignored what the man said and focused on the progress bar of his skill.

“Ding! Congrats on activating ‘Engulf’!”

Soon, there was a notification that rang inside his head and it was a success!

“Ding! Congratulations master! You have received an EXP of 164881167496…”

“Ding! Congratulations master on the level up! You are now at level 49!”

“Ding! Congratulations master…”

There were numerous notifications that rang inside Lin Xiu’s head.

But, Lin Xiu was no longer in the mood to listen to what his reward was. By now, he was sitting on the ground, panting and covered in cold sweat.

That incident had been terrifying. The feeling of his soul being taken over by another person had sent chills running down his spine.

He turned towards the Skeleton. He would have never thought that something like this could happen.

“Hmph!”

He rested for a minute before picking up his spear. Then, he aimed it at the skeleton that was on the crystal throne and threw it aside.

The skeleton fell onto the ground but none of it was damaged.

From this, Lin Xiu knew that the king warrior’s body had been extremely sturdy.

“Hmmmm…..?”

Then, Lin XIu noticed that behind the crystal throne, where the skeleton was, there was something that looked like a tombstone.

There were words where he couldn’t understand written all over it.

Lin Xiu immediately activated his ‘Analytical Eyes’ and realised that this is actually a warrior skill!

It was a purple gold warrior skill!

The only thing that was different with this skill was that it wasn’t placed inside a card. This time, it was printed on a material that looked like crystal.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and placed his hand on the tombstone.

As he transferred the energy inside his body onto the tombstone, there was a bright light that came from it.

Soon, a large amount of energy and information regarding the warrior skill rushed into Lin Xiu’s brain through his arm.

Since this was not a threat, the system did not automatically activate ‘Engulf’.

Soon, all of the information regarding the skills was entered into Lin Xiu’s brain. He took a deep breath as he sat cross-legged on the palace, trying to digest everything that he had just received.
