Chapter 290: Terrifying Upgrade Speed

Lin Xiu said with a cold snort at this time.

The man behind Lin Xiu who wanted to attack Lin Xiu suddenly had a change in expression changed his face when he heard Lin Xiu’s voice.

Just as he wanted to continue attacking Lin Xiu, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand suddenly burst into violent flames.

The flames covered the body of the spear. At this moment, the man felt the weapon in his hand become exceptionally hot.

At the next moment, he finally couldn’t bear the scorching sensation and dropped the weapon directly to the ground.

“Goodbye!” Lin Xiu suddenly turned around and stabbed the man behind!

Swish——

The spear with flames seemed to cut through the air.

The man was alarmed when he saw the Dark Edge spear covered in horrifying flames stabbed towards him but it was too late to block the attack.

The spear moved too quickly. At this moment, Lin Xiu’s spear pierced through his body directly!

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master on killing the rank 5 warrior and gaining 5 million experience!”

As Lin Xiu killed the man, another system prompt sounded in his mind.

Only 5 million experience… for Lin Xiu, this was just a drop in the bucket…

At the same time, those people who were fighting with Guo Ling and the others saw that Lin Xiu had killed their boss and several of his accomplices.

Their hearts were filled with fear and nobody wanted to continue fighting with Lin Xiu and the others anymore.

“Trying to flee!?” Seeing that these men were frightened and seemed to want to turn around and flee into the darkness, Chen Jin sneered and pursued them!

Guo Ling and Wan Qianshui did the same too. They were not saints; those people clearly wanted to kill them just now so there was no way they were going to let them run away!

Lin Xiu looked at the figure they were chasing after and did not continue to chase after them.

Instead, he turned and looked behind.

The flame tornado that Lin Xiu had just released had completely dissipated at this time.

The surroundings became dark again, only the lighting equipment that fell on the ground was giving off light.

And Lin Xiu realized that those Black Tooth Spiders continued to climb up at this moment and there were a large number of them.

“Leave now!” Qian Lin was shocked when she saw this scene, then helped Qiu Li who was injured, and ran to the back.

‘Why are there so many Black Tooth Spiders?’

Lin Xiu saw this scene and was taken aback.

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate and took the Dark Edge spear in his hand, then attacked!

“‘Awe of the Phoenix’!!!”

Lin Xiu roared loudly and the Dark Edge spear in his hand slashed violently. In a short time, flaming birds burst out from the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand!

Boom boom——

As the flaming birds rushed over, they cut through the air and made swishing sounds.

The flames pierced the sky and instantly hit the bodies of the Black Tooth Spiders that were crawling over.

Like before, as soon as the flames touched the bodies of the Black Tooth Spiders, the Black Tooth Spiders were directly burned and exploded.

The system prompts of gaining experience in Lin Xiu’s mind kept ringing and these experiences were much more than those rank 5 warriors who he had just killed!

This was simply the perfect place for gaining experience! Although his body was a little tired from the battle just now, he still continued using his fire skill to attack the Black Tooth Spiders.

Guo Ling, Wan Qianshui, and Chen Jin rushed to the back and they took advantage of the victory to kill those people.

“I think they’re all killed?” Chen Jin looked at the corpses on the ground and said to Guo Ling.

“Yeah.” Guo Ling nodded.

They were only able to kill the remaining people thanks to Lin Xiu killing that rank 6 warrior who was the leader.

Otherwise, even if they were rank 6 warriors, it was still very difficult to deal with so many people.

“How does Lin Xiu still have the strength to kill those darn things!?” Chen Jin walked to the front and suddenly saw Lin Xiu still frantically waving the Dark Edge spear in his hand, sending a large number of flames out.

Seeing how crazy Lin Xiu was, Chen Jin and the others were stunned.

‘He’s fighting way too hard, it’s like he has a deep hatred for those Black Tooth Spiders.’

Lin Xiu still had a look of surprise on his face at this time. There was simply too much experience here, he had to quickly get enough experience and he would be able to level up again!

Boom——

With Lin Xiu’s constant use of ‘Awe of the Phoenix’, there were flaming birds all around Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu had killed a large number of those Black Tooth Spiders.

At the next moment, Lin Xiu heard a clear ring in his mind.

“Congratulations Master on successfully leveling up. You are level 27!!!”

Leveled up?!

Lin Xiu’s jaw dropped in disbelief. He knew that he was gaining experience at an unbelievable speed but didn’t expect that he would have successfully leveled up!

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate and opened the stats board directly.

Although the next level requires 3 billion experience, Lin Xiu felt that it wouldn’t take very long.

Because the speed of gaining experience now has exceeded Lin Xiu’s imagination!

“What’s up with Lin Xiu…?” Qian Lin looked at Lin Xiu weirdly as he burst into laughter.

Lin Xiu didn’t know that his current actions looked very strange in the eyes of others.

At this time, Lin Xiu directly added all of these 27 potential points to Strength. Then, he suddenly felt a powerful force gushing in his body.

He could clearly feel the strength in his body improving. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com
