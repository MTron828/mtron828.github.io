Chapter 410: I Won’t Make A Move

A middle-aged man sitting next to Zhang Liangqian touched his beard, then nodded and said.

Zhang Lianqian’s eyes turned gloomy at this moment.

He had long known that Lin Xiu’s actual strength and skills were not proportioned to his rank. At this moment, seeing his own teacher thinking highly of Lin Xiu, his face turned nasty.

Darn it… he must find a way to defeat Lin Xiu!

As he was deep in thoughts, his gaze turned towards the platform.

At this moment, Wu Fei was looking at Lin Xiu in fear. He thought that using this method, Lin Xiu would be knocked out directly.

But he didn’t expect that not only did it not do anything to Lin Xiu, his partner got sent flying by Lin Xiu instead.

In this case, it’s now four against five!

“Clear the others first!” Wu Fei’s face was gloomy at this time but he quickly thought of a counterattack.

As long as the other four people were dealt with, they still had a high chance of winning with four people against Lin Xiu.

He didn’t believe that four people couldn’t deal with Lin Xiu.

“Eh? Seems to have some tricks up your sleeve, huh.” At this time, Lin Xiu walked towards Wu Fei with the Dark Edge spear and his eyes narrowed, revealing a faint smile.

Seeing Lin Xiu walking over, Wu Fei still felt a little pressure.

“‘Peerless Strike’!” However, seeing Lin Xiu approaching, he was terrified but still clenched his teeth and before Lin Xiu came any closer, he charged towards him!

And the second he rushed over, he used his skill directly!

“Wu Fei is going to use his favorite skill now!?” Some Class 5 students saw this scene and the low morale became high at this time.

This skill, which could be hailed as a strong skill was close to a diamond skill. When Wu Fei went to complete a mission previously, he used this skill and killed a rank 6 evolved beast directly!

Swish——

As Wu Fei roared, he held a long spear in his hand and charged towards Lin Xiu directly!

The body of the spear was covered in a terrifying faint blue aura and there were swishes in the air.

The speed of this skill was very fast and the destructive power was very strong. As long as one got hit, it would definitely leave a hole, even if it was the body of a rank 6 warrior!

Dang–

However, at this critical moment, Lin Xiu moved.

The Dark Edge spear spun in Lin Xiu’s hand then thrust forward and it actually collided with Wu Fei’s long spear!

Boom–

At this moment, a powerful airflow surged out and it felt like there was a wild wind.

Zhang Yin and the others could feel it and those people from Class 5 also took a few steps back instinctively.

And in this moment, Wu Fei flew out again!

Just as he was about to fly out of the platform, he stepped on the edge of the platform and used force to stop his body from flying out directly.

But Lin Xiu was still standing in the original spot with the spearhead pointing at Wu Fei.

How can this be!

Nothing happened to him at all!?

Wu Fei felt that the spear in his hand was extremely heavy, his arms were trembling like he couldn’t even hold the weapon stably.

But Lin Xiu was perfectly fine!

“This … this is not possible!?”

When the students of Class 5 saw this scene, they were shocked.

In their opinion, Wu Fei’s powerful skill was simply countered just like that!?

“What are you looking at?” Just when Wu Fei was in shock, Lin Xiu’s figure suddenly appeared in front of him.

“You… Wu Fei saw this scene and went pale. Just as he was about to move his right hand, Lin Xiu lifted his Dark Edge spear and actually tossed Wu Fei into the sky!

Seeing this scene, there was an uproar.

Lin Xiu did not pay attention to the people around him. He leaped up towards Wu Fei and directly used his spear to attack!

Boom–

As a dull sound rang out, Wu Fei was sent flying directly by Lin Xiu and smashed into the seat outside the platform, even the seat was broken.

“Medical staff!!! Call the medical staff!!!” Wu Lin was so mad that his face was turning green.

Failed, the two strong people in Class 5 were defeated by Lin Xiu!

“Sorry, Lin Xiu was a little harsh but Wu Fei shouldn’t be in danger.” Nan Zhengjun patted the agitated Wu Lin’s shoulder, then smiled and said.

“Hng!” Wu Lin was so mad at this moment. If not for his status as a teacher, he would have taught Lin Xiu a lesson.

At this time, Lin Xiu had landed on the ground stably and he glanced at the remaining 3 members from Class 5.

Sensing Lin Xiu’s gaze upon them, they shuddered.

Lin Xiu’s performance had such a strong deterrent force that they didn’t dare to continue to fight against him.

“Next, it’s you guys’ turn.”

However, at this time, Lin Xiu sat down directly at the edge of the platform and said to Zhang Yin and the rest.

“Rest of us?” Zhang Yin and others heard the words of Lin Xiu and were stunned.

“En, I won’t make a move, you guys will get rid of them.” Lin Xiu nodded and said. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

If had made a move, it would just take a few seconds to get rid of them.

But this was a good opportunity to train Zhang Yin and the others in actual combat.

At this time, hearing the words of Lin Xiu, the people in Class 5 were stunned and they looked at one another. Seeing Lin Xiu sitting there without moving, they clenched their weapons tightly.

If Lin Xiu does not participate in the battle, then they will win!

After all, there was a huge gap between Zhang Yin and the others’ strength and theirs!

“Cocky!” Zhang Liangqian looked at this scene and snorted.

“Interesting, is he trying to train the people in his class in actual combat?” The middle-aged teacher seated next to Zhang Liangqian saw everything clearly and found Lin Xiu very interesting.

How could a teenager be so powerful?

“Teacher, do you think I can knock him down?” Zhang Liangqian saw that his teacher seemed to be very interested in Lin Xiu and his expression turned nasty.
