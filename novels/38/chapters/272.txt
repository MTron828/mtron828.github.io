Chapter 273: Giant Black Rock Beast

Chen Jin said to Guo Ling.

There were black trees all around them and no matter where they looked, the scenery seemed exactly the same.

It was hard for them to find their direction.

And after enabling the compass software on the phone, the compass was spinning like crazy and there was no way of using it at all.

The network signal was also blocked by strange forces.

Guo Ling looked around and thought about something.

At the next moment, she held her sword and pointed in the direction next to her, then said, “Go this way.”

Lin Xiu glanced at her curiously. He didn’t even know which direction to head in at this place, how did she know? UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“That mutated Black Tooth Spider – is it a mutated species of the Black Iron Spider just now?” Lin Xiu said to Guo Ling as he walked.

Also, he wasn’t sure when Rollie had come out. When they left the corpses of the Black Iron Spiders, Rollie collected all the Odd crystals very quickly.

In the next moment, those Odd crystals were stuck on Rollie’s special body and were put into Lin Xiu’s backpack.

No one else noticed but Lin Xiu.

“You can put it this way actually. The mutated Black Tooth Spider we are looking for in this mission is the Black Tooth Spider evolved from the rank 5 Black Iron Spider. Only one mutated Black Tooth Spider would appear out of 100 Black Tooth Spiders.” Guo Ling nodded and explained as she walked. As they continued to walk forward, Lin Xiu discovered that the ground had begun to change.

There was still soft mud just now but right now, the mud turned into black rocks.

Stepping on them, they had a very hard texture.

They continued walking for some time but this place seemed endless.

And on this journey, they hadn’t seen any warriors at all.

So many warriors had entered this Dark Forest together just now, but they had not seen any of them yet.

This was really surprising.

“Why aren’t we there yet?”

After walking for a period of time, Qiu Li couldn’t help but ask.

Even though they were rank 6 warriors, they still felt tired after walking for so long; not physically but mentally.

After all, the surrounding environment looked the same and it was as if they had been walking in the same place constantly, never seeing the end.

This situation was very depressing.

Although the rest of the people’s condition was not as bad as Qiu Li’s, they weren’t feeling great either.

“Continue to move forward.” Guo Ling didn’t say anything but kept walking.

There was no hesitation in her eyes.

“This…” Qiu Li seemed a little worried.

Going on like this was like an infinite loop!

It had been so long and the surroundings still looked exactly the same.

“Listen to her.” Wan Qianshui, who had not spoken, glanced at Qiu Li at this moment and said.

Chen Jin and the others also nodded at this time and continued to follow Guo Ling.

Lin Xiu didn’t say anything, but he could feel that the current direction should be right.

Although the overall landscape looked the same, there was still a slight difference.

From morning to afternoon, no one had any idea how long they had been walking. At this moment, their surroundings were completely dark.

“Let’s take a break here tonight. We should be able to reach the Black Tooth Spider’s colony tomorrow. As long as we catch the mutated Black Tooth Spider alive, our mission is complete.”

They continued to walk and found that there was a tall black rock in the middle.

After arriving here, Qiu Li could not help but heave a sigh of relief when he finally saw a different environment.

They had been walking all day and the surrounding road conditions were almost exactly the same, making them feel like they had been circling around but this depressing feeling has finally been lifted.

At this moment, he was sitting directly on the ground against the rock, panting a little.

Guo Ling and the others had taken out the lamp and placed it around.

At this moment, this area has become brighter.

“Don’t move.” Just then, Lin Xiu looked in front and said aloud.

“What’s happening?”

Qiu Li was startled when he heard what Lin Xiu said and instinctively asked.

Guo Ling and the others also looked around at this time but did not see anything appearing.

“Leave this rock.” Lin Xiu said, looking at the thing warily.

The thing that looked like a rock was not a rock at all!

Lin Xiu could easily tell that this was a rank 6 evolved beast, Giant Black Rock beast, using his Analytic Eye!

“Is this something weird?” Qiu Li also came to his senses at this time and looked at the towering black rock and said aloud.

As soon as he spoke, this huge black rock shook!

It seemed to be woken up because Qiu Li had leaned on it!

Qiu Li was also shocked when he saw this scene and quickly retreated to the back with his weapon.

The ground around began shaking slightly.

Everyone looked at the ground and had a look of surprise on their faces.

This huge rock was now slowly moving up. With a dull ‘thump’, a huge black claw stretched out from the ground.

“Rank 6 evolved beast, giant Black Rock beast.” Lin Xiu’s looked at the Giant Black Rock Beast that was slowly waking up and said to the people behind.

“Hng, it’s just a rank 6 evolved beast.” Chen Jin said with a cold snort.

But there was still a hint of shock in his eyes as he looked at this gigantic beast.

It wasn’t that he has never seen a rank 6 evolved beast, but it was the first time that he has seen such a huge rank 6 evolved beast.

This was really huge.

Boom boom——

Now the trembling on the ground is getting stronger and stronger.

It was like a big earthquake and everyone who was caught off guard almost fell to the ground.

The head of this giant beast was finally exposed.

“This…Isn’t this a ****?” He stared at Qiu Li and his eyes widened at this time as he subconsciously said aloud.
