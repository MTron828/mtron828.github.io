1308 The Ma Family’s Fury

All of them here were god-level warrior skills cards!

“All of the god-level warrior skill cards would be found here.”

One of the staff spoke with arrogance as she introduced the cards.

In the entire God City, they were the only ones who sold such a huge range of warrior skill cards.

“Lin Xiu! Sponsor me one!”

Baili Haoling’s eyes brighten up with excitement.

“No way.”

Lin Xiu immediately rejected her.

This was because when he looked at the price, most of them cost hundreds of millions.

This was nothing but daytime robbery.

However, it was still a good thing that they could get god-level warrior skill cards with money.

Afterall, these cards were extremely rare.

“Are you still my disciple?!”

Baili Haoling’s eyes were opened wide as she placed both hands on her hips.

“Nope.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

Baili Haoling’s eyes were wide open and she wanted to beat Lin Xiu up badly.

However, as she thought of Lin Xiu’s abilities, she immediately gave up on that thought.

“Well, try and get more money from the next person and I’ll buy you one.”

Lin Xiu suggested an alternative.

“Alright!”

Baili Haoling’s mood instantly changed from gloomy to excitement after hearing what Lin Xiu said.

Now that she had no money left, all she had to do was beat up another group of warriors! Wasn’t that easy?

As she thought about it, Baili Haoling wanted to meet Ma Jiayun again so that she could get a huge sum of money from him.

That boy was loaded!

At the same time, Ma Jiayun, who had returned home, was sneezing continuously.

But soon, he lowered his head, afraid to meet the eyes of the man standing before him.

“Rubbish!”

It was a middle aged man who was sitting on a huge chair.

This man looked similar to Ma Jinyun.

Instead of fear, this man looked pissed.

“You brought a dozen of warrior gods with you but all of them ended up with their bones crushed.

“You even lost 4 hundred million!

“Ma Jiayun, are you trying to get yourself killed?!”

The man looked furious as he screamed on top of his lungs.

“Father…”

Ma Jiayun’s face turned ghastly pale and as the man in front of him was screaming, he could feel a heavy pressure on top of him.

His body trembled and instantly fell to the ground.

“For those who are your age, they have already become warrior gods by now but you! You are a piece of trash who is merely a saint warrior!”

“Shameful.”

Ma Jiayun’s father continued screaming at him.

“But, those who have offended us will have to pay for it.”

After hearing what his father said, there was a slight smile that appeared on Ma Jiayun’s ghastly pale face.

He obviously knew what his father meant.

As he thought of Lin Xiu and his gang, Ma Jiayun had a hideous expression on his face.

He would definitely take revenge for all the things that they have done to him.

“Do you have information about those people?”

Ma Jiayun’s father continued asking.

“No…”

Ma Jiayun, who was indulging in his happiness, was suddenly pulled back into reality.

He only found Baili Haoling and Lei Chong through the security footage and immediately brought his men to the training ground.

Ma Jiayun had no basic knowledge of who they actually were.

“Bunch of idiots!”

Ma Jiayun’s father roared after hearing the answer.

...

“If you want to teach them a lesson, you would have to know who they are so that you can catch their weakness!

“You went and attacked them so recklessly without even knowing how powerful they were! It’s suicidal!!”

Ma Jiayun’s face flushed with embarrassment as he was being lectured by his father but there was nothing that he could say.

“I only know about one of them.”

“One of them is called Lin Xiu, from Lingxian City.”

Ma Jiayun quickly recalled what happened from before and quickly spoke up.

He had watched the contest and merely remembered a few of their details.

“Lingxian City?”

Ma Jiayun’s father furrowed his brow.

He quickly moved his right hand and controlled the monitor that was next to him.

Soon, he found Lingxian City on the map.

...

“Isn’t that just a small city?!”

Ma Jiayun saw the location of Lingxian City on the map and he couldn’t help but frown.

Ma Jiayun’s father glared at his son and asked, “You….were defeated by the city lord of this little city?”

“It was him who defeated all of the warrior gods that I brought along!”

Ma Jiayun quickly spoke up.

Bakk – –

With that said, Ma Jiayun’s father swung his arm towards his son.

A huge slap landed on Ma Jiayun’s face.

There was a burning hand print that appeared on his face and blood trickled from the corner of his lips.

Ma Jiayun did not dare say another word.

“What else do you know about him?”

Ma Jiayu’s father glared at him as he spoke.

“Also…”

“Oh! He beat Huangfu Gu during the match!”

Ma Jiayun suddenly thought of something and spoke loudly!

“You mean the multi-city contest for this year?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Yes.”

Ma Jiayun’s father instantly looked troubled after hearing such news.

“Huangfu Gu…..Huangfu Gu….?”

“Huangfu Gu from the Holy City!”

His eyes were instantly opened wide as he looked at his idiotic son. His body started to tremble with fear.

Then, he landed a huge kick on his son.

Boom – –

Ma Jiayun was thrown far into the distance.

He was infuriated!

Huangfu Gu was someone that he knew. He had once met Huangfu Gu from Holy City.

He was clear about the abilities that this man had.

A warrior, who was able to defeat Huangfu Gu…..no one should doubt how powerful he would be.

“Damn it.”

Ma Jiayun’s father suddenly felt a headache coming.

Although that man was merely a city lord from a small city, he was still able to defeat Huangfu Gu which showed that he must be a powerful man.

“Forget it. Looks like we would have to ask for help from our elders.”

His face turned cold as he muttered to himself.

Although his son wasn’t the best, no one should be allowed to challenge the Ma family of the God City!

At the same time, Lin Xiu, who was still shopping in the store, was not aware of the trouble heading his way.

As he looked at the warrior skill cards around him, Lin Xiu was incredibly surprised.

There were so many of them! There were at least a hundred of them!

Due to how they were glowing brightly, Lin Xiu had to narrow his eyes.

Baili Haoling was wandering around, looking for a warrior skills card for herself.

However, as she looked around, she was devastated to find that there wasn’t much for daggers like hers.

There weren’t many warriors who would use double daggers as their weapons.

“Sky Fire Meteor…”

Lin Xiu’s eyes brightened with excitement as one of the warrior skill cards caught his attention.

“This is a card for those who use a spear and it’s compatible for those who use the fire element.”

The staff quickly introduced the card after seeing how Lin Xiu was staring at it.
