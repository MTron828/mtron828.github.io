1458 Duo team, killing the God kings (2)

His divine soul power is used to control others!

And when using this divine soul power, the whole person becomes like a pair of eyes.

There is no way for people not to be affected.

“die!”

At this moment, his saber was about to strike Lin Xiu’s body!

But at this critical moment, a black shadow flew out of Lin Xiu’s body.

In an instant, he flew towards the blood-eyed mad wolf soul!

“ah!”

When the saber in his hand was about to hit Lin Xiu’s body, he immediately felt tremendous pain.

One eye of his divine soul, the blood-eyed mad wolf, has been bitten off by a black dragon!

And at this time, the black dragon hadn’t stopped moving, and frantically started biting at the blood-eyed wolf.

When the divine soul is bitten while the divine soul power is being used, the pain was similar to a backlash.

At this moment, Lin Xiu also felt that his body could move.

Boom——

The long spear in his hand suddenly burst into flames.

Holding the spear, he stabbed directly at the god king in front of him!

The god King now felt that his soul is being swallowed, but there is no way to stop it.

And Lin Xiu stabbed over with the spear again!

‘Sphere’!

There is no other way, he can only mobilize the strength of his whole body to form a ‘sphere’ to resist Lin Xiu’s blow in the past!

His ‘sphere’ has already become extremely thick at this moment.

Just to resist this blow.

break!

This stab must kill the god king!

boom–

As the tip of the spear pierced his ‘Sphere’, there was a loud noise.

The spear with the flame of chaos directly penetrated his ‘Sphere’!

And it penetrated his head in an instant!

The God King’s eyes widened, and his eyes seemed to be filled with disbelief.

The ‘Sphere’ formed by the condensed energy of his whole body was pierced by Lin Xiu’s spear!

At this moment, Lin Xiu continued to guide his power to the tip of the spear.

Boom——

With a thought, the flame of chaos immediately passed through his head and passed into his body!

The whole body of the god king suddenly burned.

“ah!!!”

He struggled frantically, breaking free from the black spear that pierced through his head.

At this moment, blood and brains flowed out from the hole in his head.

However, he is not dead yet!

Some god kings have immortal souls and will not die.

But now that the flame of chaos is burning, even its soul cannot be separated from its body. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

This Flame of chaos is really terrifying.

His body is now slowly being burned at a speed visible to the naked eye until there is not even a slag left.

At this moment, the god king who turned into a giant attacked with a giant hammer in his hand!

At this time, Lin Xiu moved his body and disappeared in place instantly.

But the god king continued to frantically wave the warhammer in his hand, constantly attacking Lin Xiu.

Although his body has grown so much, his reaction speed is not slow at all.

The warhammer in his hand danced wildly at this moment.

Bang bang bang——

There were also loud explosions in the air.

But his warhammer still failed to hit Lin Xiu.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s black dragon soul also directly detoured behind the god king, wanting to bite at its eight-armed giant god king!

But the god king, having clearly seen the fall of the god king holding the saber just now, already knows that the black dragon’s soul can devour other people’s souls!

At this time, he watched the black dragon’s soul fly over, and the look in his eyes changed slightly.

Turning around, he directly dodges the oncoming black dragon soul.

Wanting to continue to attack Lin Xiu.

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t dodge any more. He held the spear in his hand and directly collided with the war hammer he swung over.

Boom——

When the spear collided with his huge war hammer, it actually directly impacted the war hammer in his hand and he retreated back.

clank clank——

At this moment, the spear trembled even more.

The tool spirit seems to have given this Dark edge spear even more terrifying power!

Before the god king could attack again, Lin Xiu continued to attack him!

And at this time, Luo Yue was still fighting the sword-wielding god king.

The long swords in the hands of the two seemed to be colliding with each other like phantoms.

There seemed to be a few bloodstains on Luo Yue’s body.

“Die!!!”

At this moment, the sword-wielding god king caught a flaw in Luo Yue’s head, and the long sword in his hand was about to stab Luo Yue’s forehead.

boom–

But at this moment, a flaming bird charged over from the other side.

It directly hit the ‘Sphere’ of the god king.

At this moment, the god king was directly blasted out.

The body directly hit the mountain in the distance.

A huge crater was punched out of the entire mountain peak, and it shook crazily.

good chance!

Luo Yue looked at this scene, and the look in her eyes changed slightly.

The long sword in her hand flew out instantly.

At this moment, as she swung her hands to both sides, the long sword that flew out suddenly transformed into thousands of swords!

Whoosh whoosh——

At this moment, they all stabbed towards the front!

The surrounding space was cut into space cracks because of the flying sword.

At this time, the god king just flew out of the mountain when he saw thousands of long swords rushing towards him!

His face suddenly changed drastically.

Just now his ‘Sphere’ was melted away by the flaming bird that rushed over.

Now, there is no way to condense into a ‘Sphere’ again!

Damn it!

His complexion became extremely ugly.

Holding the long sword in his hand, he swung it wildly at this moment.

Block those incoming long swords.

“Small tricks!”

He let out a low growl, and quickly knocked these long swords away!

After the last long sword was blown away by him, he immediately showed a smile.

But as soon as his smile appeared, it froze for an instant.

Because he clearly felt that there was a powerful aura appearing behind him!

That real long sword has already appeared in Luo Yue’s hands.

boom–

It pierced through his heart directly from behind!

As soon as the pitch-black long sword pierced his body, those terrifying dark forces surged madly towards the body of the god king!

“ah!!!”

He didn’t even feel such pain when he was pierced through the heart, but with the influx of those dark forces, he let out a wailing cry instantly.
