Chapter 672: Come, Spear!

Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

The spaceship seemed to have collided with something, and it shook violently at this time.

And the lights around were flashing red, so you could tell what happened at a glance.

“Everyone, keep calm and don’t panic.”

At this time, a staff member spoke to the passengers who had already run to the central hall.

Although he said that everyone should not be in a panic, it could be seen that he was so nervous himself that cold sweat was pouring out of his forehead.

Bang bang bang-

And if you listened carefully, you could clearly hear a huge collision sound outside.

What’s happening exactly?

Boom–

Just when everyone felt overwhelmed, in the next moment, the gate directly broke open!

“All of you hold your head and squat down for me!”

And at this moment, a rough voice resounded.

“Who are you!?”

The staff member just now said loudly when he saw this scene.

Whoosh whoosh—

But the moment he finished speaking, the laser beam shot out instantly!

‘The staff hadn’t reacted yet, and several holes suddenly appeared on his forehead.

His eyes were wide open like he didn’t die in peace at all.

“What happened?”

Lei Tong also had a surprised look on his face at this time.

But when he just spoke, several laser rays shot towards him instantly!

But at this moment, he felt a pull behind his back, and he dodged the laser ray in an instant.

“Hold all of your heads and squat down for me, or you’ll end up just like him!”

A burly man stepped out at this moment, and stepped directly on the corpse of the staff member whose head had been penetrated by the laser beam just now, roaring loudly.

‘There were many men in strange uniforms holding heavy laser guns in their hands.

And just then, two warriors charged towards him with sabers!

“Courting death!”

The man holding the laser gun directly threw the laser gun in his hand and avoided the attack of a man who was slashing with a saber. The next moment, he reached out and grabbed the man’s wrist.

Boom-

And in the next moment, as he used force, he crushed his wrist directly.

Before another warrior could get close, he was kicked out.

The whole person slammed into the wall behind and made a loud noise.

He opened his eyes wide, and in the next moment, he vomited out a mouthful of blood.

Swoosh—

‘The men behind the laser guns pulled the trigger directly, and a laser ray went straight through his head.

Two rank 7 warriors were killed just like that!

‘When the rest of the warriors saw this scene, the expressions on their faces changed greatly.

They originally thought that these people were just relying on the laser guns, but as long as they got close, they could kill them all.

But what they didn’t expect was that the combat power of these people was so strong!

“Kneel on the ground for me, otherwise, all of you will die!”

The tall and strong man shouted loudly at this time.

At this time, more and more warriors with laser guns came in, and the black muzzles were aimed at Lin Xiu and the others.

More than forty warriors stood in this wide hall, because of what happened to those warriors just now, no one dared to take action.

“The Skeleton Thieves…!?”

A warrior saw the tattoos on the men’s uniforms on the opposite side, his body trembled, and then he fell to his knees.

The rest of the people also seemed to hear the man’s mumbling, and their bodies trembled at this time.

One by one, they fell to their knees.

“The Skeleton Thieves? They’re actually the Skeleton Thieves…”

Lei Tong also swallowed secretly at this time, and his body began to tremble.

“What are you afraid of.”

Lin Xiu rolled his eyes at him and said aloud.

“The Skeleton Thieves! This is the most troublesome organization even for the federal government. They originated in the underground world, and then began to become space pirates, burning, killing and looting…”

“The two here, why aren’t you kneeling down yet?”

At this moment, a man with a heavy laser gun pointed at Lin Xiu and Lei Tong and said aloud.

At this time, Lei Tong also tugged at Lin Xiu’s sleeve, “I guess they just want to rob money, they wouldn’t do anything to us…”

He glanced at the pitch-black muzzle, and at the next moment, he also fell to his knees on the ground.

‘There was no choice, even if he is reluctant, in the face of death, dignity was really nothing.

Because he wanted to find his son, as long as he could see his son, it didn’t matter what he had to do!

“You, kneel down for me!”

Seeing Lei Tong kneeling down, the man showed a sneer, then continued to aim at Lin Xiu with the laser gun in his hand.

“Lkneel to my parents, to heaven and earth, the only thing that I don’t kneel to… dumbasses.”

Lin Xiu smiled lightly and said aloud.

“Courting death!”

‘When the man heard Lin Xiu’s words, at this moment, his face suddenly became extremely ugly.

Without any hesitation, he directly pulled the trigger.

Swoosh—

A terrifying laser beam shot towards Lin Xiu in an instant! Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Boom–

But at this moment, Lin Xiu directly waved his right hand and slapped the laser beam away!

How is this possible!

‘When the man saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

Whoosh whoosh—

At this time, he pulled the trigger frantically and the laser rays shot out one after another.

But Lin Xiu still stood still, swiping his right hand constantly, those laser beams were continuously slapped away by Lin Xiu’s hand.

He brushed off the laser rays with one hand!

This is really terrifying!

“Who are you!?”

The burly man who seemed to be the leader looked at Lin Xiu and said.

All the laser guns held by the others were aimed at Lin Xiu.

“Well, about a hundred people… five minutes.”

Lin Xiu glanced at those people, and then said lightly.

“Boy, you’ve got guts huh.”

The tall and burly man gave a wicked laugh, then waved his hand.

At the next moment, all the people around pulled the trigger at the same time.

Whoosh whoosh—

With the continuous sounds breaking the air, more than one hundred warriors around pulled the trigger in their hands at the same time.

A large number of laser rays shot at Lin Xiu immediately!

Bang bang bang-

But in the next instant, a dark red ‘circle’ spread out on Lin Xiu’s body, and all those terrifying laser rays were blocked!

How is this possible!?

‘The ‘Sphere’ unfolded by ordinary warriors would be useless against their heavy-duty laser guns!

The comers of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched, his right hand flicked, and he stretched out to the right, “Come, spear!”
