Chapter 125: ‘AMZ’ Virus

But the things inside seemed a little old, and when the lights lit up, they began flashing and seemed very suspicious.

“What the hell are these?” Zhang Yin looked inside those glass containers.

Around them, there were many such glass containers, which contained a light blue liquid, and inside that, there were many strong people with their eyes closed. Their bodies were covered in strange scales and looked a little disgusting.

On the ground, there were many weird vines and they had no idea how these things grew here.

“They should be mutants.” Lin Xiu also looked at the contents in the glass containers, then pondered a little, and said out loud.

“Mutants?” The rest of them were stunned.

“Mutants, new humans produced by the fusion of human bodies and the cells and DNA of evolved beasts.” Lin Xiu recalled the contents of the books he had read and said plainly.

“But these horrible things have already disappeared in this era.”

He didn’t expect to see something like this here.

Thinking about it, Lin Xiu took out his cell phone and took 3D photos here.

These things could be posted on the website of the Warrior Union as information and he could charge fees on them.

Hissing——

At this moment, there was a sound, and before that skinny man named Peng Yu could react, he got entangled by a nearby vine!

Zhang Yin and the others were taken aback, they then found thay the vines at their feet could move!

“Damn!” Seeing this scene, he couldn’t help but curse. He then quickly avoided the vines.

“Save me! Save me!” Peng Yu roared, and in a moment of panic, he forgot to use the weapon in his hands.

Zhang Yin quickly regained from the shock, and just as he wanted to use his weapon and chop those vines, he heard Lin Xiu’s voice from the back, “It’s too late.”

The second Lin Xiu spoke, the vines instantly ran through his body and a great amount of blood flowed out.

His eyes were wide open like how he looked before he died.

Lin Xiu moved his Dark Edge spear around him, instantly cutting off the vines that had just been wrapped around him.

When the vines were cut, they seemed to curl up in pain with a pale blue liquid flowing out.

These things… were probably not vines, but a creature’s tentacles!

With this thought, Lin Xiu became very alert.

“What do we do now?” Lei Lei and Jiang Li couldn’t help but cover their mouths and were frightened when they saw this scene.

Zhang Yin glanced at Lin Xiu like he was waiting for Lin Xiu’s opinion.

“There’s something weird about this place, we need to find out how to get out.” Lin Xiu thought for a moment and said.

Gu lu gu lu——

But at this moment, those vine-like things that went through Peng Yu’s body swelled up a bit and some green veins could be seen on the skin of his face and body.

“Oh no… there’s also the AMZ virus here!” Zhang Yin was astonished.

When infected, the person would become a monster and act irrationally and only know how to kill. Also, this virus was really eerie that even when the person’s head was cut off, the whole body could still continue to move!

At this moment, Peng Yu struggled out of those vines, his mouth opened wide, and saliva secreted from his mouth.

His whole body seemed to have swelled up and he pounced directly on Lin Xiu and the others!

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted, then he stabbed Peng Yu in the heart with his spear!

Bang—— ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

As a dull sound resounded, the zombie-like Peng Yu seemed fine and appeared to become even more savage.

“Groundbreaking Strike!!!” That big man, Jiang Li, held a machete, then suddenly attacked Peng Yu’s body!

“Don’t use a skill!!!” Lin Xiu roared, but it was too late. Following the use of Jiang Li’s skill, Peng Yu’s body was instantly cut into several pieces, and the whole ground was shaken because of his skill.

“It’s done.” Jiang Li heaved a sigh of relief when he saw pieces of Peng Yu’s dead body on the ground.

However, this body that had been split could still move slowly, as if its nerves still had a reaction, and it looked exceptionally disgusting.

“We’re in trouble,” Lin Xiu said with an awful expression.

“What do you mean? Isn’t Peng Yu dead?” Jiang Li retorted.

“Senior? What’s wrong?” Zhang Yin asked curiously.

Being infected with that kind of virus, if he wasn’t chopped into pieces immediately, he would not die, and if accidentally infected by him, it would be even more troublesome.

“They’re going to wake up.” The five fingers on Lin Xiu’s right hand wrapped tightly around his Dark Edge spear as he spoke.

Bang bang bang——

The moment Lin Xiu spoke, they heard noises and those mutants contained in the glass containers began to open their eyes slowly and began banging against the glass containers.

After he started the machines just now, he realized that the devices under these glass containers operated independently. There was a mercury system under the glass containers that once shaken, it could likely cause these damned things to wake up.

That was why Lin Xiu didn’t use skills just now.

The impact caused by Jiang Li’s skills just now activated some of the devices in these glass containers.

His guess was right.

“What are we going to do?” Jiang Li’s jaw dropped and he asked.

He just wanted to kill Peng Yu, who was infected with that horrific virus, he didn’t expect such a terrible thing to happen.

“Find a place to go.” Lin Xiu said indifferently, then he saw those ‘vines’ coming toward them again.

“Hng!” Lin Xiu snorted coldly, then lifted the spear up and cut off these things again.

Suddenly, there was some light blue liquid coming out again.

The liquid that came out of it was most likely the so-called ‘AMZ’ virus.
