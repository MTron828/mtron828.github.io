Chapter 781: I Am An Honest Person

Not long after Liu Pan and the others entered the cave, they found that there were already other warriors there.

As soon as they came in, the warriors held swords to their necks.

Liu Pan looked in front of him and sure enough, Lin Xiu was right – Odd crystals, there were mountains of Odd crystals.

That Raging Flame Lion actually collected so many Odd crystals.

And there are at least dozens of rank 10 Odd crystals.

How did the Raging Flame Lion get all these.

“Tsk tsk, these two chicks seem to be pretty good looking...”

The other warriors glanced at An Qi and Qian Lin at this time, revealing a greedy look.

“We are from the Qian family and the An family in Cangqiong City, don’t you dare lay a finger on us!”

An Qi looked at the eyes of these warriors and said coldly.

When these warriors heard her words, they were stunned.

Then they looked at each other.

They all seem to know what the Qian family and the An family are in Cangqiong City. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

These two families are not easy to mess with.

“And my master is outside, he will come over later.”

Qian Lin also said lightly.

“That’s right, you’d better take these weapons away, otherwise...”

At this time, Liu Pan looked at the weapon around his neck and said to the warriors.

Right now, most of the warriors here are at the master warrior level.

In this situation, even Liu Pan didn’t dare to act rashly.

“I found it! The treasure of the Raging Flame Lion!”

At this time, other warriors came in one after another.

“These things are ours!”

The group of warriors shouted angrily as they looked at those who rushed in.

Soon, some warriors were directly killed by their group.

“Do you see this – this will be your ending.”

A warrior stared at Liu Pan and said coldly.

“The Qian family and the An family? Tsk tsk, how do we know if what you are saying is true or false and, even if it is true, who would know what happens here?”

A warrior stared at An Qi and Qian Lin and said with a grim look on his cheeks.

“Ahahaha, that’s right!”

“What the hell is the Qian family and An family!”

The warriors beside him also chimed in at this time.

An Qi and Qian Lin’s faces suddenly turned pale.

Indeed, no matter how strong their An and Qian families are, they are useless here.

Because there is no surveillance or anything here, let alone what it is, even if they were killed, who would know?

“Hehehe...”

The man who spoke just now stretched out his hand to touch them.

“En? Did you guys go in?”

At this moment, a voice came from the entrance of the cave.

The man originally wanted to touch An Qi and the others, but when he heard the sound, he frowned and said, “What are you guys doing! Why are you letting people in!”

These warriors have already occupied all the caves and there are several warriors guarding the entrance.

As long as a warrior enters, they will kill them directly.

After all, in this cave, there are not only Odd crystals piled up in mountains but also many weapons and exotic treasures.

No one wanted others to gain.

“Oh? They wanted to kill me, but I killed them.”

The voice continued to come over, Liu Pan’s eyes glanced to the side where the voice came from and he saw Lin Xiu holding a black spear!

“Brother Lin!”

Liu Pan was also pleasantly surprised at this time.

When An Qi and Qian Lin heard Liu Pan’s words, their eyes also showed surprise.

Those warriors looked at the blood on the head of the black spear in Lin Xiu’s hand and they clearly knew that the warriors guarding the entrance of the cave were indeed killed by Lin Xiu.

“who are you?”

The warrior who was headed just now stopped moving towards An Qi and Qian Lin, looked at Lin Xiu who was approaching and said coldly.

“Honest man.”

Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

Those warriors were stunned for a moment and after they came to their senses, they said a little angrily, “Boy, I think you are courting death!”

The leader shouted angrily and at the same time, several warriors held the swords in their hands and attacked Lin Xiu!

The speed of these warriors was very fast and they rushed in front of Lin Xiu in an instant.

From the moment he first came in, Lin Xiu glanced at them with the Analytic Eye and was able to clearly know the strength of each of them.

There were three master warrior-level warriors and the other dozen or so, were all warriors of the ninth-rank peak.

It seems that these warriors did not suffer any injuries in the battle of the Raging Flame Lion and they retained most of their strength at this time.

That’s why they can seize the treasures here.

Moreover, most of the master warrior-level warriors ran after him and were still looking for Lin Xiu in the forest above.

“Ha ha.”

Looking at those who attacked him, Lin Xiu showed a sneer.

He stood still and did not move. Looking at the warriors who attacked him from all directions at the same time, the spear in his hand suddenly drew an arc.

Those warriors who attacked only saw a flash of cold light, felt a sharp pain in the neck and blood spurted out in an instant.

These warriors fell to the ground instantly, covering their necks with their hands, as if desperately trying to stop the blood from flowing.

But it was of no use. The wounds on their necks were really terrifying. Even though the warriors’ vitality was strong, it didn’t take long for their bodies to tremble and there was no sound.

Instant kill!

When the remaining warriors saw this scene, their eyes widened and their faces were full of disbelief.

“how can that be...”

There were five or six warriors at the peak of rank 9 and they were killed so easily!?

With such an instant kill, even master warriors can’t do it!

Gulp—

A warrior watched Lin Xiu continue to walk over, he couldn’t help swallowing saliva and his body subconsciously retreated to the back.

“What are you afraid of!”

The warrior who just headed looked at the man’s movements and immediately grabbed his collar and roared.

“You guys, attack with me!”

The three master warrior-level warriors shouted loudly as they looked at the surrounding warriors.

When they heard the words of the three master warrior-level warriors, they instinctively wanted to refuse, but they didn’t dare.

If they refused, they would probably be beheaded on the spot!

“Ah! Go to hell!”

Their eyes all turned to Lin Xiu’s side, then unfolded their ‘Sphere’ and attacked directly!

This time, they unfolded the ‘Sphere’ in advance, so it is impossible for them to be killed in an instant like the warriors just now.
