Chapter 358: Arriving at the Deep Blue City Again

“So fast?”

Lin Xiu looked at the Deep Blue City in the distance and had a look of surprise.

It was faster than when he first went to the dark forest.

“Let’s go.” After running for so long, Luo Yue still didn’t pant at all. She looked at Lin Xiu and said faintly.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded, and then went on to the front with Luo Yue.

In contrast with Luo Yue who seemed perfectly fine, Lin Xiu’s face was already covered in sweat.

After running at such a fast speed for so long, Lin Xiu felt a little tired. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

After a while, the two of them walked to the gate of the Deep Blue City.

“Routine inspection!” At this time, at the gate of this deep blue city, some men in camouflage uniforms stood there, and they were scanning the bodies of people with strange instruments.

“What’s going on?” Lin Xiu said when he saw their stern appearance.

“Why ask so much!” A man snorted coldly and reached out to grab Lin Xiu’s shoulder, then scanned Lin Xiu with the strange instrument.

Another man also stretched out to pull Luo Yue over and performed the same check.

Pa——

Just then, Lin Xiu’s stretched out and held the wrist of the man in the camouflage uniform, then faintly said, “There is no need to fight, is there?”

Lin Xiu’s eyes became cold at this time.

Although he wasn’t sure why the access here has suddenly become so strict, the attitude of these people made Lin Xiu feel very uncomfortable.

“I suspect it is these two people! Take him!” The man felt a sharp pain as Lin Xiu grabbed his wrist and shouted loudly.

As soon as he yelled, several other men who were also wearing camouflage uniforms rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Crackling——

And at this moment, they took out the electric baton from their waist and there was electric light flickering at the top of it.

These were not ordinary electric batons and there was high-voltage electricity in these electric batons. Just a light brush and the person would be paralyzed by the electricity, he or she would not be able to fight back at all.

Lin Xiu watched the flashing electric batons smashed towards him, but his eyes remained unchanged and there was no fear.

Boom–

Before the electric baton hit Lin Xiu’s body, Lin Xiu raised his hand and held his electric baton tightly.

At this moment, the electricity on the top of the electric baton had all been transmitted to Lin Xiu’s body.

But even if those electric lights covered Lin Xiu’s body, they didn’t seem to affect Lin Xiu at all!

“You…” The man looked at Lin Xiu and was shocked.

It was the first time that he saw someone who was not afraid of this electric baton and grabbed it directly.

But Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate at this time, and with a sudden force, he directly grabbed the electric baton from his hand!

In the next moment, he took the electric baton directly and hit his body!

“Ah!!!”

The man had just been hit by the electric light, and in the next moment, he let out a wailing cry.

He fell directly to the ground from the electric shock, wailing in pain.

At this time, the rest of the people also took the electric batons in their hands and continued to smash them towards Lin Xiu.

Bang bang bang——

But this time, Lin Xiu didn’t grab the electric batons from these men with his bare hands. Instead, he swung his leg and swept all these people out in an instant!

Everything happened in the blink of an eye.

Many warriors saw this scene and were surprised.

You must know that the men in camouflage uniforms guarding the security check were not extremely strong, but they were pretty good.

But they didn’t expect Lin Xiu to get rid of these people so easily.

He wasn’t even afraid of the high voltage delivered by the electric baton!

“Let’s go.” Luo Yue said directly to Lin Xiu without even looking at them.

Lin Xiu nodded, and just when he was about to enter, he heard a cry.

“You guys… are dead…”

A man who was just knocked into the air by Lin Xiu slowly got up, looked at Lin Xiu, and said aloud while pressing a button beside the city gate.

Then, Lin Xiu saw a group of shadows walking over.

“What’s going on! What’s going on!!!”

A large group of warriors in combat suits came over, and soon surrounded the gate of the city.

Seeing this, Lin Xiu frowned.

These warriors were also wearing camouflage uniforms and they looked exactly like these people.

He knew that these people must be from the Deep Blue City government.

“Captain! It’s them, it’s them!” The people who had just been knocked down by Lin Xiu slowly got up, then pointed to Lin Xiu and said aloud.

There was still a lingering fear in their eyes at the moment.

They were all top rank 5 warriors and they were not weak, but Lin Xiu, a young man, defeated them so easily.

“I suspect that they are the group of thieves!” A man suppressed the pain after being kicked by Lin Xiu just now and said to a muscular middle-aged man who came over.

This middle-aged man looked very muscular and even the camouflage uniform looked quite fitted on him which outlined the muscles.

Moreover, there was a powerful aura coming from him. Just one glance, Lin Xiu could feel that this man must be very strong.

“Them?” The middle-aged man glanced at Luo Yue and Lin Xiu at this time, then frowned.

At this moment, he still didn’t believe it, because Luo Yue and Lin Xiu looked too young, and they didn’t seem to be able to do that kind of thing at all.

“It’s them!” A man held his abdomen, then nodded affirmatively.

“You guys stole the things?” The middle-aged man walked over and said coldly to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

His eyes were cold, and as he glanced over, Lin Xiu had a very uncomfortable feeling.

“They should know very well who started this fight.” Lin Xiu ignored the middle-aged man’s words and said lightly.
