Chapter 449: Forever the Second

“Why? What’s the matter?” Lin Xiu ignored Ouyang Hang. He was looking at him as the corner of his lips deviated upwards.

Ouyang Hang looked around him and was acting a little hesitant.

Zhang Ying, who was a smart man, noticed the look in Ouyang Hang’s eyes. He smiled at Lin Xiu and said, “I have to go now. Leilei is waiting for me.”

“Alright.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

It was true that it was already getting late. It was six in the evening and most of the lights in the training grounds had been turned on which was why they didn’t notice that the sky had turned dark.

“Tell me.” When Zhang Ying left, Lin Xiu spoke to Ouyang Hang.

“I heard that Dean Baili spoke to you today?” Ouyang Hang looked around, asking Lin Xiu in a soft voice.

From the look on his face, it was obvious that he was feeling scared.

“Hmm? News gets around pretty quickly.” When Lin Xiu heard his question, he was quite surprised. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

But, this was Ouyang Hang and it wouldn’t be difficult for him to find out about this.

“Was it because of what happened before?” Ouyang was starting to panic as he continued asking Lin Xiu.

This was a rare opportunity for Lin Xiu to see Ouyang Hang in this state and he slowly narrowed his eyes.

“It is.”

“Sh*t! Did you mention my name as well?!” Ouyang Hang became even more dramatic when he heard Lin Xiu’s answer.

“That’s right. I mentioned that you were the one who told me to do it.” Lin Xiu paused for a moment before nodding his head.

“Damn it! Damn it! You son of a b*tch!” Ouyang Hang was so angry that he was like an explosion.

He had already grabbed onto his fist, wanting to punch the crap out of Lin Xiu.

But, when he thought of how powerful Lin Xiu was, his anger disappeared like the air inside a balloon.

“I’m doomed. I’m doomed!” Ouyang Hang was suddenly acting like it was the end of the world and his eyes were starting to lose focus as well.

“Why are you doomed?” Lin Xiu asked out of curiosity.

This bastard! He doesn’t look like someone who is afraid of trouble since he had the support of the Ouyang family.

“Dean Baili would definitely tell this to my family. I am doomed once they find out about this!” Ouyang Hang screamed out vigorously and he looked helpless.

As he thought about how strict his family rules were and what punishments he would be getting because of this, his body started trembling.

When Lin Xiu saw him in this state, Lin Xiu started laughing out loud.

“What are you laughing about?!” Seeing how Lin Xiu was laughing so loudly, Ouyang Hang got even angrier and threw a punch at Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

Before his fist could touch Lin Xiu’s body, he was thrown into a distance.

“Damn it!” This fellow’s power grew even stronger…” As Ouyang Hang hit the wall behind him, he was rubbing the muscles that were getting sore as he gritted.

“I don’t think that he knows you’re part of it.” Lin Xiu smiled while telling the news to Ouyang Hang.

“What did you say?!” Ouyang Hang, who was originally filled with sorrow and fear, suddenly felt surprised.

“It’s true.” Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders.

The middle-aged man at the power station only saw him. Plus, on the image from the security camera, the only person that they saw was him.

There was a huge possibility that no one noticed Ouyang Hang.

“Thank god. That’s great.” Ouyang Hang let out a breath of relief as he patted himself on the chest.

“Oh, by the way, that man Yu Muchen. Who is he?” Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment before asking Ouyang Hang when this question popped into his head.

“You want to know about him? Beg me for it then. I’ll tell you more about him.” After learning that Lin Xiu wanted something from him, Ouyang Han started acting playful again.

He has been defeated by Lin Xiu too many times and this was a rare opportunity. Ouyang Hang finally felt refreshed.

Xiu – –

Just when he was planning to make a joke out of Lin Xiu, he heard an ear-piercing sound and felt something cold near his neck.

He took a look at it and noticed that there was a spear that had been placed near his neck without him knowing.

“Should I be begging you or the other way around?” Lin Xiu chuckled as he asked the question.

Ouyang Hang was about to retort when he met Lin Xiu’s eyes, which were clearly showing that he had the intention to kill him.

It didn’t look staged. Does this bastard really want to kill him?!

“I’m begging you. I’ll tell you more about him. Move this thing away from me!” Ouyang Hang was definitely feeling scared.

After hearing what Ouyang Hang said, he chuckled. Ouyang Hang seemed to have developed a sense of fear towards Lin Xiu after multiple failed attempts of trying to kill him.

If it was him earlier, Ouyang Hang would definitely be stubborn and would keep his mouth shut.

But, they were still in the Sacred Region Academy and he obviously couldn’t kill him here. Otherwise, he would get into a lot of trouble.

“Huuuuu.” Ouyang finally felt relaxed after Lin Xiu removed the spear from his neck. At that moment, Ouyang Hang could clearly feel that his entire back was now filled with sweat.

It felt as if he had made a round way trip to hell.

“Yu Muchen is from the Yu family of Sky City.” Ouyang Hang was painting as he sat on the ground.

“Sky City?” When Lin Xiu heard about the name of the city, he couldn’t help but frown.

This was because Luo Yue’s family was also from Sky City.

“At present, it is the most prosperous city on earth. Those who manage to stay in the city are usually families that are very powerful.” Ouyang Hang continued.

“Although my family is also from Sky City, we are still miles away from where the Yu family is.”

“Is there some sort of grudge between the both of you?”Lin Xiu asked.

This was because from what he said earlier, Lin Xiu could obviously feel that there was something odd between Ouyang Hang and Yu Muchen.

“It shouldn’t be considered a grudge. It’s just that that bastard has been winning me in each and every competition and I have never won him; not even once!” Ouyang Hang said in anger.

With his talent, he was already considered a genius that was one in a million but in every match that they had where Ouyang Hang thought that he could win, Yu Muchen would always appear.

Therefore, he had a nickname back in Sky City – ‘Forever the Second’.

This was something extremely devastating to Ouyang Hang.

Well, obviously, he would never tell this to Lin Xiu.

“Does that make you forever second’?” After hearing Ouyang Hang’s description, Lin Xiu asked without any hesitation.

“How did you know what my nickname was?” Ouyang Hang paused for a moment before the question slipped out of his mouth.

But, when he realized what he said, he regretted it immediately and covered his mouth.

“So, your nickname really is ‘Forever the Second’…”

“No, it’s not!” Ouyang Hang quickly defended himself since this was the only tainted part in his entire life!

“Well, aren’t you forever second as well in the Sacred Region Academy?” Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders as he told Ouyang Hang.
