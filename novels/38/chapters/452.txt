Chapter 453: Undersea Fright (part 2)

Space crack?!

Lin Xiu suddenly thought of it and started swimming downwards, towards the vortex.

He managed to get a clearer view of it. It was definitely a space crack in the form of a vortex and there was lightning inside the vortex.

Lin Xiu wanted to touch it with his hand but quickly pulled himself back.

This was a space crack. He had no idea what was inside and there may be another energy form inside it. His arm may be completely destroyed as soon as he touches it.

Boom – –

At that moment, there was a Black Tooth Fish that came swimming out of the space crack.

Lin Xiu looked at the scene before him in shock. Then, he reached out and caught the Black Tooth Fish.

Bili Pala – –

A large amount of lightning came through Lin Xiu’s arms and the Black Tooth Fish immediately got toasted.

So this is what happened. The Black Tooth Fishes were coming from this space crack.

But…. was this a natural phenomenon or an artificial one?

Lin Xiu thought of what he saw when these creatures were biting onto the machineries and it got him thinking.

‘Oh well, forget it. I’ll take a picture of it first.’

After thinking about it, Lin Xiu decided to first take a picture of it. He clicked on the other button that was on his diving suit and the satellite’s camera system was activated.

Ka-cha – –

He quickly took a picture of the scene and saved the image onto the storage card that was inside the diving suit.

Suddenly, Lin Xiu felt a vibration in his pocket.

Lin Xiu was stunned and he quickly took out the radar. He could clearly see on the screen on the radar that there was a blinking light!

The target is here!

When he saw what was happening, Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank uncontrollably and he immediately moved in the direction that was being shown by the lights on the radar.

As he got closer to the target, Lin Xiu’s heart was racing as well.

Perhaps it was because the underwater world was already frightening on its own, Lin Xiu kept having the feeling that something would jump out and scare him.

Lin Xiu could feel that he was getting closer to the target and that’s when he saw a figure that resembled a human.

Found it!

Lin Xiu continued to swim closer to it and realised that it was really a human right in front of him!

The man was holding onto something peculiar looking that was also glowing with a bright, golden light.

The thing that shocked Lin Xiu the most was how this man wasn’t wearing a diving suit. The man was just freely standing on the bed of the ocean as if it didn’t affect him.

The hell…..who is this?!

Lin Xiu placed the radar back into his pocket and picked up the dagger with his right hand.

When he is under water, he would be affected by the pressure and the buoyancy which is why he wouldn’t be able to use his spear. Even if Lin Xiu’s abilities were really powerful, the effects of it would be greatly reduced if he used it here. Therefore, it would be a smarter choice to use a dagger instead.

Plus, Lin XIu was aware that this dagger wasn’t an ordinary weapon. The sharpness of it was also top-notch.

The man suddenly noticed Lin Xiu as well and there was a pale blue light that was coming from his eyes. He looked at Lin Xiu and it felt as if….the man was analyzing him!

Lin Xiu was surprised and he quickly activated his Analytic Eye as well.

“Artificial Intelligence Robot, L247”

Although the Analytic Eye only showed a few words, Lin Xiu’s mind was already completely blown.

The sole reason why this man was able to dive underwater without any diving equipment was because it is an artificial intelligence robot!

The thing that it was holding in his hand, the one that was glowing with a bright gold glow, could be the thing that holds the energy.

What was it doing here?!

Lin Xiu didn’t have the time to think and he could immediately feel the water current around him slowly becoming vigorous.

Lin Xiu’s body was uncontrollably shaking unsteadily as well.

Damn it!

Lin Xiu tried to grab onto one of the rocks closest to him, to prevent being pushed away by this strong current that had appeared out of nowhere.

He quickly turned towards the direction where he first saw the robot and realised that the robot had disappeared!

Instead of the robot, there was another space crack that appeared below him and this new one was much bigger than the previous one!

In the center of the crack, it was a scary-looking vortex and it was spinning continuously.

Before Lin Xiu could take another second looking at it, there was a huge, blakc figure that came out of the space crack.

What the hell was that?!

The creature was so dark that Lin Xiu couldn’t see it clearly for a while but with his personal experience, felt a sense of danger.

Boom – –

The black figure wasn’t heading for Lin Xiu. Instead, it went towards the machines that were below the island that was holding the Sacred Region Academy and gave it a hard knock.

Kong Loong – –

At the same time, Zhang Ying, who was busy practicing with his sword, suddenly felt the ground shaking vigorously and it felt like an earthquake.

“F*ck! What happened?!” Li Ping, who was about to fall, couldn’t help but swore.

It wasn’t just them. Almost everyone in Sacred Region Academy felt the ground shaking.

“What happened?!” Dean Baili asked as he frowned.

“We’re not sure as well. The cameras underneath have been destroyed since a long time ago.” Dean Baili was now in a huge control room and one of the middle-aged man answered his question with a better-smile on his face.

When the academy was first built, there were lots of cameras that have been installed underneath the island but after not fixing and caring for it for years, most of them were no longer working.

Following that, there were a lot of mutant sea creatures that appeared underwater who were extremely sensitive to energy. Anyone above rank 6 that got close would cause them to feel threatened and they would turn crazy.

There were too many mutant sea creatures around. If they did a major attack on it, the entire island would be affected and it wasn’t a consequence that they could bear.

“Di Di Di – – ”

At that very moment, a weird beeping sound appeared.

“There’s something coming in. Did he get something?!” After hearing the sound, Dean Baili quickly asked about it.

The man on the control panel nodded his head and quickly moved his fingers across his projected keyboards. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Soon, there was a clear image that appeared on a large screen.

“This is the view underwater?” After seeing the image, Dean Baili was stunned.

“I thought the kid actually sent us something useful.” One of the middle-aged men shook his head in disappointment.

“Wait…. There’s another one.”
