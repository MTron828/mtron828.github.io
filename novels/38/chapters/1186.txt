1187 Odd Crystals of a Beast God

Baili Haoling’s eyes were opened wide.

It was filled with disbelief.

Although Lin Xiu had already become extremely powerful previously, she didn’t think that Lin Xiu’s abilities could become so much stronger.

“Anyone else?”

!!

Lin Xiu asked calmly.

Then, he stared at the rest of the warriors.

When they saw how Lin Xiu was looking at them, they subconsciously took a few steps backwards.

The skills that Lin Xiu has shown earlier was domineering.

Long Leg Seven’s head was blasted into a million pieces with one simple punch.

He didn’t even get the chance to fight back.

“Looks like no one is here.”

Lin Xiu looked at Mr Lui before informing him about it.

That’s when Mr Lui had a dark expression on his face.

He had intentionally made things difficult for Lin Xiu. It would have been best if Lin Xiu died on the stage. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

However, Lin Xiu’s abilities were beyond his expectations.

“Anyone else?”

Mr Lui looked around with a cold gaze.

The rest of the crowd kept their mouths shut.

They weren’t idiots. If someone like Long Leg Seven would die so easily, weren’t they digging their own graves by stepping forward now?

“Hmph!”

Mr Lui was looking pissed as if he had landed a slap on his cheeks with his own feet.

“Consider yourself lucky!”

Mr Lui was still dissatisfied as he spoke to Lin Xiu.

“You guys were the one who stole our evolved beasts!”

Baili Haoling commented in a cold tone.

Mr Lui completely ignored Baili Haoling. He swung his sleeve and left the arena.

As for Lin Xiu, he jumped out of the ring as well.

“Why are you here the warrior god realm?”

Lin Xiu was extremely curious about why Baili Haoling was here.

It was indeed something unbelievable for him to meet Baili Haoling here in Warrior God Realm.

“Because I want to.”

Baili Haoling made a funny face at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu laughed helplessly when he saw her reaction.

Baili Haoling was older than him but she was still like a child.

“Fine. I’ll tell you the truth. My ancestors think that I am gifted and brought me here to train me.”

“Your abilities have improved so much and as your master, I should also be better.”

Baili Haoling stared at Lin Xiu before explaining herself.

“How powerful are your ancestors?”

After hearing what Baili Haoling said, Lin Xiu looked surprised.

He remembered that when they were on earth, Baili Haoling’s ancestors had lent a helping hand.

It has been a long time. Lin Xiu had almost forgotten it but now that he was reminded of it, Lin Xiu was curious.

“I don’t know but they should be better than you.”

Baili Haoling thought about it before answering.

“If we have the chance, I would like to have a match with your ancestors.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

“Well, then you will be defeated fairly quickly.”

Baili Haoling sneered.

“Let’s go.”

Baili Haoling looked around before suggesting to leave the arena.

They have already gotten Rollie and Xiao Bai, there’s no need for them to stay here.

“No. Since we’re here, it’s not nice if we don’t take anything with us.”

Lin Xiu had a slight deviation on the corner of his lips before saying it to Haoling.

“You’re thinking of…”

Baili Haoling tried to think of what Lin Xiu wanted to do and her eyes widened in shock.

At the same time, on another ring, there was a referee who was holding onto an exquisite box while standing in the middle of the ring.

“This is an odd crystal of a beast god!”

He looked around at the crowd before introducing the treasure in his hands.

The rest of the warriors were shocked as well when they heard about the reward.

Then, as he slowly opened the box, there was an eye-blinding light that appeared from inside it.

There was a bright red beast god odd crystal that was sitting inside the box.

“As the rules appear, whoever that stands last will be able to get these odd crystals. The qualifying conditions would be one thousand energy stones!”

Without waiting for long, one of the warriors jumped on stage.

“I’m here!”

The warrior then threw his card to the crew nearest to him.

In the warrior god realm, they do not use the traditional currency. Instead, they would use energy stones as currency.

These energy stones can be kept in the local banks and a card will be issued for transactions.

“For the competitions here, you would have to pay different amounts of energy stones each time you go on stage. These fellows here are really good at making money.”

Baili Haoling looked onto the stage and there were already warriors who were ready to fight. She started judging the owners of the underground battlefield.

“I want that odd crystal.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

“You? Do you even have a thousand warrior stones?”

Baili Haoling was stunned at first but she pursed her lips.

A thousand energy stones wasn’t a small amount for warriors who were in the warrior god realm.

“Of course.”

Lin Xiu chuckled.

Forget about only having one thousand. He had millions of them.

This was because he owned one of the energy stone mines!

“Anyone else?!”

As the warriors got onto the stage, the referee shouted once again.

“Just wait for me.”

Lin Xiu turned to Baili Haoling.

Then, he leaped and landed inside the ring.

With his control of his mind, there was a bag of energy stones that appeared in his hand that he got from the expansion space and he quickly passed it to the staff next to him.

Where did he get so many energy stones?!

Baili Haoling’s eyes were opened wide as she couldn’t believe what she had just witnessed.

“Huh? Young man, you want to go against me for this?”

There was a muscular man who stood opposite Lin Xiu.

He wore a pair of boxing gloves and he had no other weapons.

Earlier today, he had just torn another warrior’s body into two halves with his bare hands.

“I want the odd crystal.”

Lin Xiu glanced at him before speaking to him.

This was a beast god odd crystal that was of the fire element. It was definitely something useful for Lin Xiu.

“Young man, are you joking?”

The muscular man laughed.

He was laughing so hard as if this was a joke.

Then, his laughter stopped abruptly and he went straight for Lin Xiu.

“I will tear your limbs apart!”

He let out a cold laugh and there was a fierce look in his eyes.

The rest of the crowd went wild as well.

They could already see how Lin Xiu would be shred to pieces the very next minute.

Boom – –

However, when he pounded on Lin Xiu, his body suddenly disappeared!

Where did he go?!

Seeing how he had missed his target, his pupils shrank uncontrollably.
