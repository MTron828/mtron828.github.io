Chapter 491: Sniper

One of the men screamed and Lin Xiu.

He might be afraid but he didn’t think that under such circumstances, Lin Xiu would be able to do anything else.

“What right do I have? I am the head of the Federal Police Department, Lui Wei!” The policemen from the Federation Police Department laughed as he told Lin Xiu.

“According to the Federation’s Law, without enough evidence, I would like to know what the punishment is for trying to arrest a one-star merit soldier using so many men.” Lin Xiu asked in return.

“A one-star merit?” When Lui Wei heard what Lin Xiu said, the look in his eyes changed as he asked in shock.

The merits that the soldiers of the Federation would get are according to stars, from one star to five. The higher the stars, the bigger the mission completed.

Do not underestimate one-star merit, with these, they would have priority while using the public transport and the police are not allowed to arrest them.

“Hahaha…..stop lying. They are only given to soldiers who have made great sacrifices.” The brat, Chen Jinkun, started laughing out loud.

What Lin Xiu said earlier had turned into a joke.

“Do you think that I would believe you?” Lui Wei stared at Lin Xiu and snorted.

Lin Xiu ignored him and took out the special medal from his pocket.

“Each awarded medal has a special code to it. You got this from the market and you think you’ll be able to fool Director Lui?

When Lui Wei saw the medal that Lin Xiu had in his hand, the expression on his face changed.

He quickly took out his phone and scanned the medal that was in Lin Xiu’s hand.

With the help of the system from the police force, he soon found the information about the one-star medal.

Lin Xiu?!

The screen clearly noted his name as Lin Xiu and there was a photo attached as well.

“Mr…..Lin, we’re so sorry.” After looking through the information that he found, he looked at Lin Xiu once again but now, there was a respectable look on his face.

“Now…. could you stop pointing at me with those laser guns?” Lin Xiu pointed at the men behind Lui Wei who were pointed at him with their laser guns.

“What are you doing?! Put down your guns!” Lui Wei turned around and ordered the men who were behind him. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

After getting the instructions, all of the soldiers put down the laser guns that were in their hands.

“Director Lui! Don’t be fooled by him. He has just broken all four limbs of Young Master Chen…..” The man before quickly spoke up seeing what was happening around him.

“Shut up!” Lui Wei glared at him before turning to Lin Xiu and said, “Mr. Lin, I will definitely look into this matter carefully.”

“En….about this brat who’s causing so much trouble, what should you do?” Lin Xiu nodded his head and looked at the man who was next to Director Lui.

“Take him back.” Lui Wei looked at him and ordered his men.

“Director Lui, you can’t…” The man’s face changed immediately. Just when he was about to defend himself, he noticed that all of the soldiers around were pointing their laser guns at him.

With those big, black guns pointing at him, he quickly kept his mouth shut.

“Let’s go!” Lui Wei felt heartbroken when he saw the laser guns that had been destroyed by Luo Yue but there was nothing that he could do about it.

He wouldn’t have expected that the person he wanted to arrest was a man who had a one-star merit medal.

Boom – –

Right at that moment, there was a loud sound that rang through the room.

Lin XIu turned around and noticed that there was a beam that was on Luo Yue’s shoulder as she was standing near the entrance.

There was also a huge hole that appeared on the wall opposite the main entrance.

Lin Xiu’s pupil constricted and turned towards Luo Yue’s shoulder. Her clothes were already completely burnt and there was also blood seeping through it.

“Who was it?!!” Lin Xiu turned mad after seeing what happened.

It was clear that the injury was done by a laser beam and from the hole that was on the wall opposite them, one would know how scary it would be if she actually got hit by it.

“Get down!” Lin Xiu walked into the room and told Ye Shuanger and her mother.

They have also heard the loud noise that was coming from outside and quickly reacted according to what they were told.

Just as Lin Xiu walked into the room, he could see that there was another ray of laser beams that was headed towards it.

The laser beams were traveling at an extremely fast speed and since they were from a sniper, the beams were slightly thicker than the usual guns which also meant that their damage would be much worse.

However, Lin Xiu’s reflexes were much faster than the rest of them. These may be beams that the others couldn’t dodge but it was just an easy thing for Lin Xiu.

“Sniper? Why are there snipers here?” Director Lui’s face turned awful as well.

With something like this happening in Bai Di City, it was an embarrassment.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu walked towards the window, pulled it open and then jumped out of the window!

The sniper that was on the opposite building was shocked as well after seeing what Lin Xiu was doing.

They looked downwards and noticed that Lin Xiu had just jumped down from a building that was 15 meters tall. With the buildings in between as his jumping board, he soon got to the ground.

But, as soon as Lin Xiu got to the ground, he lifted his head and started running towards another building.

The sniper soon realized what Lin Xiu was doing as the look in his eyes changed. The sniper started packing his stuff and wanted to leave.

“Brother Lin Xiu, what’s wrong?” Ye Shuanger was holding onto her head as she was on the ground. She suddenly thought about him and stood up to ask him.

“Shuanger, be careful!” Ye Shuanger’s mother said to her.

This was the first time that they have ever encountered a sniper. If the sniper has not left, it would be dangerous.

“We’re safe now.” Ye Shuanger looked around before telling her mother.

Then, she looked forward and noticed that the window was opened.

As for Lin Xiu, he was already gone.

“He jumped out of the window.” Lui Wei was also standing by the window. He was more experienced which was why he didn’t seem flustered.

Having an assassination from a sniper while he was around was already embarrassing and the sniper even took his shot which was even more embarrassing.

“Get someone to check out that building!”

“Yes Sir!”
