‘Whoosh-

And at this moment, his spear slashed straight towards Lin Xiu’s head!

Lin Xiu bent down and dodged the blow.

But Nan Huang’s attack didn’t stop. The golden spear he was holding was still frantically attacking Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu stabbed the ground with his spear and let the powerful impact force his body to recoil away.

Just as he stabilized his body, Nan Huang appeared in front of Lin Xiu again.

“You are going to die here today.”

Nan Huang roared, and the spear held by that strong arm continued to stab Lin Xiu’s body!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened, and a large amount of source strength from his body was transmitted to the Dark Edge spear, causing it to tremble slightly, bursting with white light.

The terrifying power came from Lin Xiu’s body.

‘Fury!!!

‘As soon as this system skill was used, Lin Xiu’s whole body seemed to be extremely powerful.

The muscles in his body swelled up.

Boom—

The spear stabbed out and collided with Nan Huang’s spear, and a loud sound was heard in an instant.

The whole ground shook.

Even the surrounding audience could feel the tremor.

“You hide your power too!?”

At this time, Nan Huang was also blown away. After stabilizing his body, he looked at Lin Xiu over there, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Lin Xiu was also secretly startled at this time. He used the ‘Fury’ skill just now, and now his power has increased to infinitely close to the ninth rank, but even so, he still did not cause any major damage to the Nan Huang.

“It’s interesting, it’s interesting to kill you like this!”

Nan Huang roared, and the spear in his hand swung. At this moment, with him as the center, white energy burst out instantly, and then covered the entire platform.

Source field!

As it was released, Lin Xiu felt a chill down his spine.

But the power of the body was not suppressed.

What kind of power is this?

The ability of each source field was different, and Lin Xiu was still not clear about his source field ability.

But it was too late to think about it now. ‘Fury’ has a time limit. Now, it was best to deal with him as quickly as possible!

Lin Xiu clenched the spear in his hand, and at this moment, he charged directly towards Nan Huang!

Boom boom boom —

At the moment of rushing over, Lin Xiu kept waving the Dark Edge spear in his hand, releasing the skill ‘Awe of the phoenix’.

“Humph!”

Nan Huang snorted coldly. At this time, he looked at the flaming birds that were charging towards him first. He directly took the long spear in his hand and slashed diagonally, and even dissipated the flaming birds.

The weapons of the two collided in the next moment.

Dang dang-

Aloud sound came out as the two’s long spears collided.

‘When Nan Huang fought against Lin Xiu at this time, he clearly felt the pressure.

This was impossible, he has now been promoted to a rank 9 warrior, why is this ant in front of him able to resist his attack!

He roared angrily, and when his spear continued to swing towards Lin Xiu, a few black shadows suddenly appeared on the ground.

What happened!?

Lin Xiu originally wanted to dodge the attack from Nan Huang, but at this moment, he felt as if something was grabbing his feet.

Looking down, it turned out to be from Nan Huang’s source field – it had black arms!

Five or six black arms composed of energy bodies were grabbing Lin Xiu’s legs tightly, making Lin Xiu unable to move!

Damn it!

Lin Xiu cursed secretly, and before he could break free, Nan Huang’s spear charged towards Lin Xiu with terrifying energy!

Boom—

‘As soon as the spear hit Lin Xiu’s body, it instantly smashed Lin Xiu into scum.

Just as the surrounding audience was in an uproar, Nan Huang suddenly turned around and looked behind him, and saw Lin Xiu’s real body on the opposite side of him!

“What kind of skill is this!” Nan Huang said with a gloomy expression.

At this time, under Lin Xiu’s feet, some black arms appeared again, as if trying to restrain Lin Xiu’s body, but Lin Xiu was already prepared, and at this time, he easily dodged.

‘The platform was in the open air. At this time, Lin Xiu raised his head and looked up. On this big night, the sky was full of stars.

“Power of the Stars’.”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

As Lin Xiu’s words just fell, in the next moment, a dazzling light bloomed above Lin Xiu!

“What is this…”

The surrounding audience, as well as those high-level warriors on the rostrum, had shocked expressions in their eyes at this time.

Because in the sky above Lin Xiu’s position, a dazzling light actually bloomed, and with the appearance of this light, it seemed that the stars in the sky became even more dazzling.

These rays of light shone on Lin Xiu’s body, making Lin Xiu feel an extremely comfortable feeling all over his body.

It was as if a person with a cold body was suddenly bathed in warm sunlight.

Lin Xiu enjoyed this feeling very much.

The strength of the body was growing rapidly, and the wounds on his body were healing very quickly.

Swoosh—

After Lin Xiu’s spun the spear a few times, he pointed it directly at Nan Huang.

“Ten seconds!”

“What does he mean?”

“Want to kill Nanhuang in ten seconds? Don’t joke, he is a rank 9 warrior, the youngest and has the most potential!”

“This kid must have been hit in the head…”

Some audience members in Sky City could not help but sneer when they heard Lin Xiu shouting at Nan Huang. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Very good.”

“It’s the first time someone dared to provoke me like this.”

Nan Huang sneered at this moment, holding his weapon tightly with his right hand, looking at Lin Xiu who seemed to be bathed in white light, his eyes were full of killing intent.

He didn’t know what Lin Xiu had just done, but he was extremely confident in his own strength.

He must kill this man who dared to challenge his dignity!

He roared inwardly, and when his legs moved, he exploded with extremely terrifying speed, and charged directly towards Lin Xiu!

“Too slow.”

Lin Xiu looked at his movements at this time. In Lin Xiu’s eyes, it seemed that his movements had slowed down.

Swoosh—

The moment he rushed over, Lin Xiu also rushed out.

And Lin Xiu’s speed seems to be even faster!

Nan Huang was wearing a black battle suit, while Lin Xiu was wearing a white battle suit, and because of the influence of the power of the stars just now, his whole body shone with white light.

At this moment, the two were fighting frantically together, like a black shadow and a white shadow!
