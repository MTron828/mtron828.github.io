“No.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“I saw it, just now, you did it.”

Mr. Zhao said lightly.

“Wow, I didn’t expect that there would even be a Divine Marker here?”

At the same time, a man came over from the other side.

This man seemed to have a different temperament from that of ordinary warriors and he led many powerful warriors behind him.

“Ye Yu from Luanxuan Palace?”

Zhao Laosan frowned as he watched this man come over.

“Everyone from Luanxuan Palace is here…”

Some warriors around, looking at these people, suddenly began to whisper.

Although Lin Xiu didn’t know what Luanxuan Palace was, the man who Zhao Laosan called Ye Yu was a god warrior.

The warriors who followed him were all of the God warrior level!

“Zhao Laosan, the ruins can be obtained by those who are capable.”

Ye Yu smiled and said to Mr. Zhao.

“Humph.”

When Mr. Zhao heard his words, his face became ugly.

Originally, this time he thought that there would be no other big forces coming, but he didn’t expect that people from Luanxuan Palace would also come to participate.

“By the way, boy, you are the Divine Marker.”

At this time, Ye Yu walked in front of Lin Xiu and said with a faint smile.

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“Hmph, I, Zhao Laosan, saw it clearly just now. It was you who cracked one of the divine marks.”

At this moment, Zhao Laosan looked at Lin Xiu with a sneer and said.

“So what?”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

Although these people were powerful warriors, Lin Xiu didn’t have the slightest fear.

Instead, he was a little excited inside.

As long as he killed these warriors, he will gain a lot of experience, right?

These people don’t even know, in Lin Xiu’s eyes, they are just ‘experience’.

“Interesting, you’re not divine marker yet you could decipher the divine mark.”

Ye Yu laughed out loud at this time.

But in the next moment, his smile suddenly solidified and with a wave of his right hand, a golden long sword appeared in his hand.

The sharp point of the sword pointed directly at Lin Xiu’s forehead.

Just a little bit more and the tip of the sword was about to touch Lin Xiu’s forehead.

“The rest, help me crack them all.”

Ye Yu said lightly.

He wasn’t going to allow Lin Xiu to refute.

The rest of the warriors behind him all looked at Lin Xiu at this time.

The strengths of these people are all at the level of God warrior!

It was not impossible to fight with the use of system skills.

But the strength of the Zhao Laosan next to him was very strong.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

“Go on.”

Ye Yu nodded in satisfaction.

The golden long sword in his hand was only retracted at this time.

Lin Xiu turned around and looked at the huge stone gate behind him.

After a little hesitation, Lin Xiu began to use the Analytic Eye.

With the use of the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the surrounding divine marks and in his eyes, all of them became different.

Lin Xiu reached out and touched them and with a thought, he quickly began to decipher these divine marks according to the trajectory given by the Analytic Eye.

Immediately following Lin Xiu’s cracking, all the divine marks on the huge stone gate began to disappear.

The surrounding warriors were extremely surprised when they saw the scene in front of them.

“He’s really a Divine Marker…”

Some warriors whispered.

Lin Xiu knew that the fact that he was able to decipher these divine marks was obviously due to the power of his Analytic Eye.

“Very well, you go and open this stone door.”

Ye Yu also nodded in satisfaction at this time, then spoke to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu raised his brows, but didn’t say anything.

He put his hands in front of this huge stone gate and started to exert force.

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

At this time, with a strange sound, the stone gate was slowly pushed open by Lin Xiu.

As the stone door was pushed open, a bigger and bigger gap appeared and some white light suddenly appeared from the opened gap.

It seems that the divine marks on the stone gate were cracked by Lin Xiu, so now this stone gate can easily be pushed open.

Soon, the stone door was opened fully as Lin Xiu exerted his strength again!

At this moment, the warriors around all looked into the stone gate.

Taking a closer look, they saw a lot of lights appearing on the wall behind the stone gate.

There was a long road ahead and also a white light on the ground.

“Walk!” ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Seeing this scene, Ye Yu took the lead in leading the people from Luanxuan Palace and walked in directly.

At this moment, Mr. Zhao looked at Lin Xiu and walked in directly.

The warriors behind all reacted at this time and they all poured in.

Although this time, Zhao Laosan and the people from Luanxuan Palace also entered the place, even if they don’t get to eat the meat, at least they get to drink a little soup.

In this ruin, there will not only be Bai Lingxian’s inheritance, but also other things that are useful to them.

“Hello, brother, my name is Ou Rong.”

Just as Lin Xiu walked over to the front, a man walked up to Lin Xiu’s side, hehe smiled and said.

Before Lin Xiu could say anything, he continued to say, “It’s the first time I’ve seen a Divine Marker.”

“This Bai Lingxian is also a warrior god who was said to use divine marks. If you can get this inheritance, it will be great.”

At this time, Ou Rong continued to speak to Lin Xiu.

“It’s a pity, with Mr. Zhao and Ye Yu here, there is no hope for inheritance.”

As he spoke, Ou Rong shook his head.

“You talk a lot.”

Lin Xiu said lightly, then walked in directly.

“Hey, brother, wait, let’s go together.”

Ou Rong was stunned for a moment, then quickly walked up.

Walking on this path full of light, everyone around them began to clench their weapons.

After all, in ancient ruins, opportunities and crises coexist.

Especially just now, the divine mark on the stone gate caused damage to a large number of warriors, making many warriors have lingering fears.

At this time, you can’t be careless.

Very strong source fluctuations.

At this time, Lin Xiu felt that after entering the stone gate, he could clearly feel the energy contained in the surrounding air, which was very strong.

“Look, who is over there!”

Some warriors walking on this bright road seemed to see something in their eyes and suddenly said out of surprise.

Um?

Lin Xiu raised his brows and looked forward and he could clearly see that there was a huge skeleton in front of him.
