1398 Lin Xiu Is Going to be Taken Away?

But this time, the power he erupted did not shake Lin Xiu out.

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu’s body is surrounded by faint black energy.

Even the body of the golden spear has black energy.

“Dark energy, you dirty bastard!”

!!

The God King Tianyuan looked at these dark energies and his expression changed slightly.

Lin Xiu ignored his words and continued to attack the past with the golden spear in his hand.

Dangdangdang——

The God King Tianyuan also quickly fought back with the saber in his hand.

The weapons of the two collided together and there were extremely loud noises immediately.

What’s going on?

How could his strength suddenly increase so much?

The God King Tianyuan was filled with shock.

The current Lin Xiu is different from the Lin Xiu just now.

The spear in Lin Xiu’s hand stabbed out frantically without stopping at all.

Just now, he directly used the ‘Fury’ skill.

There’s no other way. Lin Xiu originally wanted to keep this skill, but the power of the God King Tianyuan was simply too powerful.

It was impossible to kill him.

At this time, Lin Xiu was already pressing down on the Tianyuan God King to fight, so he had no way to fight back. He could only use the saber to resist continuously.

The originally ferocious-looking God King Tianyuan has gradually calmed down at this time.

Holding the saber in his hand, he resisted all of Lin Xiu’s attacks.

And while resisting, he began to mutter to himself.

Spitting out some words.

Although he couldn’t understand, it made Lin Xiu faintly feel that something was wrong.

Although God King Tianyuan was being crushed and beaten by Lin Xiu now, Lin Xiu didn’t seem to have injured him.

And as he muttered to himself, soon, some faint golden light appeared on his body.

These golden rays of light became more and more intense. At the next moment, the golden spear in Lin Xiu’s hand had just pierced through and he felt a powerful force rushing toward him!

boom–

The whole body was instantly blown away!

What kind of power is this!?

Lin Xiu, who was blown away, also shrank his pupils slightly and his eyes were full of disbelief.

The entire body of the God King Tianyuan seemed to be plated with gold, emitting a golden light.

He looked at Lin Xiu who was thrown out and opened his mouth wide.

Roar–

As he let out a loud roar, a golden energy ray shot out from his mouth, directly charging toward Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu’s body had just been sent flying and before he had time to stabilize his body, he saw the golden ray and directly charged toward him.

As he shot out golden energy rays, the golden light on his body also disappeared at a speed visible to the naked eye.

It’s as if all the water in the reservoir has been tilted to empty.

Boom——

Those golden energies hit Lin Xiu’s body and there was an extremely loud sound.

A sinister smile appeared on the face of the God King Tianyuan.

This time, Lin Xiu will surely die.

“This is the magic skill!”

He said to himself in a cold voice.

But before he could keep his smile on for a second, the expression on his face changed.

Because he discovered that Lin Xiu is not dead yet!!!

This is impossible!

Looking at this scene, he roared in his heart.

The golden energy just now should have been enough to explode Lin Xiu within a second of hitting his body.

But the current Lin Xiu, except for the tattered battle uniform on his body, doesn’t appear to have suffered any injuries.

This simply made him subvert his three views.

“Almost died.”

Lin Xiu also heaved a sigh of relief at this time.

The power released by the God King Tianyuan just now is indeed too terrifying.

But fortunately, Lin Xiu has the system skill ‘Golden Body Immortality’, so it didn’t have much impact on Lin Xiu.

...

It’s just the aftermath of those forces that ruined Lin Xiu’s battle uniform.

“Pity.”

Lin Xiu looked at his battle uniform and felt a little distressed.

This was rewarded by the system back then and it didn’t break after using it for so long, but at this time it was broken by the impact of this force.

The God King Tianyuan looked at Lin Xiu’s figure with an extremely ferocious face.

He is completely crazy now.

After using such a powerful force just now, Lin Xiu was still not killed!

He is the majestic God King Tianyuan!!!

“I want you to die!!!”

He roared loudly and the strength of his whole body exploded again. Holding the saber in his hand, he continued to attack Lin Xiu crazily!

Lin Xiu’s face also turned icy cold. He tightly held the golden spear in his hands with both hands. Before he could rush to him, his body moved first.

...

Dangdangdang——

The weapons of the two collided again.

This time, it looked like they were evenly matched, but Lin Xiu clearly noticed that there were a lot of cracks in the body of the God King Tianyuan.

As the cracks appeared, traces of blood also flowed out from those cracks.

His body is about to break apart.

The power of the God King Tianyuan is indeed powerful, but Ma Yun’s body obviously can’t bear the power he uses.

“You are dead.”

Lin Xiu said coldly while attacking.

The God King Tianyuan also obviously noticed this, but the saber in his hand was still attacking Lin Xiu.

More and more cracks appeared on his body and blood began to flow out.

Immediately, the flesh and blood are about to burst.

“This body is still too weak…”

He stared fixedly at Lin Xiu and at the next moment, his body suddenly swelled up.

Self-destruct?!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he seemed to think of something and the look in his eyes changed drastically.

Boom——

But now Lin Xiu has no time to react.

Ma Yun’s body instantly swelled up and exploded!

This terrifying explosion caused the entire space to vibrate crazily.

Lin Xiu’s body was covered in blood.

“Damn…”

Although Lin Xiu was seriously injured at this time, he still did not die.

“What a powerful physical strength…”

“But it’s a pity, it will be mine soon.”

At this time, a familiar voice suddenly appeared in Lin Xiu’s mind.

God King Tianyuan!

The soul power of the God King Tianyuan seemed to have directly invaded his body following the explosion just now.

“Is it.”

Lin Xiu didn’t show the slightest panic at this time but instead sneered.

“Hahaha!!!”

In his mind, the face of the God King Tianyuan appeared. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He was laughing wildly.

“Your body, I accept it!!!”

As soon as he finished speaking, a scream came out of Lin Xiu’s head.

“What is this! What is this!”
