Chapter 745: Not Dead!

But Lin Xiu didn’t have time to think at this moment because he was directly pulled away by this energy thread.

boom–

It didn’t take long for Lin Xiu, who flew out, to hit the ground heavily.

But the body hasn’t stopped being pulled over by the transparent silk thread.

bang bang bang-

Lin Xiu was dragged to the depths of the forest outside and his body hit the trees, all of which broke.

damn...

Lin Xiu’s expression changed greatly at this time, the power of the silk thread wrapped around his body was so great that he couldn’t break free.

“What is happening!?”

At the same time, Qian Jin, who was on the train, also walked out of his box.

Not only Qian Jin, but all the warriors on the Tianjiao list came out at this time and they were also surprised by what just happened.

“Nothing much, it’s just that someone made a lot of boulders on the road, so the driver braked suddenly.”

Zhang Zhiheng seemed to have found out some information, so he came over and said.

Hearing Zhang Zhiheng’s words, everyone understood.

“Let’s go down and help get those boulders away.”

“By the way, where is Lin Xiu?”

Zhang Zhiheng said, then looked around and found that all nine people on the Tianjiao list was present, but Lin Xiu was missing.

The rest of the people looked around at this time, but they didn’t find any Lin Xiu’s figure.

“Could it be that he was knocked out?”

A man said with a sneer at this time.

Qian Jin frowned slightly, then walked over to the other box.

“Lin Xiu.”

He called out to the inside.

But there didn’t seem to have a sound inside.

Could it really be due to the sudden braking that caused him to faint?

Thinking of this, Qian Jin used force and pulled the door open.

But as soon as he opened the door, he found that Lin Xiu was gone!

And the large glass window was completely broken!

“Lin Xiu... he’s gone!”

/

Damn it!

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s body had been pulled into the middle of the forest by these thin threads.

But now Lin Xiu has used his Dark Edge spear and the silk threads were slowly being cut off!

boom–

In the next moment, with Lin Xiu’s violent force, he finally cut off the last energy thread that wrapped around his body!

“Huh? You can actually cut off my source thread?”

Just as Lin Xiu was cut off by those source threads, he heard a voice coming from the front.

“Huhu.”

Lin Xiu was still out of breath now. He was dragged so far by this darn thing just now and his body hit the trees. He still felt severe pain all over his body.

However, after Lin Xiu used the Dark Edge spear to cut off the threads, he found that the threads wrapped around his body had disappeared.

And Lin Xiu’s body was now free.

Looking up to the front, he saw a strange man in a cloak staring at him.

And those source threads seemed to be released from his hands.

Not only him.

Lin Xiu also heard the sound of footsteps coming from a lifetime. Looking closely, he found that a large number of warriors walked out directly from the surrounding area.

They surrounded Lin Xiu.

“It’s really not easy to get you out.”

“Mr. Zhang, the fee this time will be increased.”

“Hmph, let’s kill this kid first.”

At this time, a cold voice came from the inside.

Taking a closer look, he saw a man wearing a mask walking out from among those people.

Lin Xiu looked at the uniforms of these warriors and recognized them easily. Aren’t they the people from the God’s Punishment Guild?

He remembered he submerged their chairman Zhang Zhiheng in the ice and snow.

Is this for revenge?

When Lin Xiu thought about it, it seemed that at that time, he was not prompted by the system that he had gained experience.

“What, have you forgotten me?”

Just as Lin Xiu was thinking about it, the man with the mask slowly took off his mask.

“It’s you!?”

Looking at this disfigured face, combined with his voice, Lin Xiu vaguely knew that this person was Zhang Zhiheng! This guy was not dead!

“Hahaha, do you think I’ll die down there?”

Zhang Zhiheng said with a grim face, his face that was already terrifying in the first place became even more terrifying at this time.

“See this? These are all thanks to you, those lava almost killed me...” Zhang Zhiheng said frantically at this time.

Lin Xiu didn’t speak, the spear in his hand clenched tightly.

Zhang Zhiheng didn’t die, which was beyond Lin Xiu’s expectations.

“I want to kill you myself.”

Zhang Zhiheng stared at Lin Xiu, his eyes filled with incomparable killing intent and hatred.

That kind of hatred can only be eliminated by slashing Lin Xiu thousands of times.

“With your strength?”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time, even in this situation, he didn’t seem to be surprised at all.

A playful look appeared in the eyes of the man in the cloak. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Now there’s only you here. Do you think there will be someone to help you?”

At this time, Zhang Zhiheng had already pulled out a slender, blood-red long knife from the scabbard, then licked his dry lips and said coldly.

“Go!”

He didn’t give Lin Xiu any time to react. The next moment, he held the sword and slashed at Lin Xiu’s body!

Dang–

But Lin Xiu’s reaction was not slow at all and the spear in his hand also swept out at this moment!

Under the collision of the weapons, there was a loud noise.

The rest of the members of the God’s Punishment Guild just stood around, as if they were not going to do anything and would only prevent Lin Xiu from escaping.

“Wait, I’ll let you know who escaped.”

Lin Xiu looked at Zhang Zhiheng in front of him and said lightly.

If it was Lin Xiu at that time, it would be difficult to deal with him, but now that Lin Xiu has been promoted to the level of master warrior, with the system skills, it could be said that he was invincible.

What’s more, he has also learned the spatial source mark!

“Joke!”

Zhang Zhiheng laughed in anger. He was going to use a war sword to slash Lin Xiu with a thousand cuts, so he asked someone to capture Lin Xiu here.

Moreover, it was a little troublesome to kill Lin Xiu in an open and honest manner, after all, he was a contestant with a place in the warrior competition.

Now that he was here, he could even slash Lin Xiu into ten thousand pieces.

“‘Freezing the Distance’!”

Zhang Zhiheng roared angrily and a large amount of ice and snow swept up on the ground!

How could he have this skill!?

The expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes also changed greatly at this time.
