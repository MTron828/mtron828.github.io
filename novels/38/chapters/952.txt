Chapter 953: Fighting the Sage Warriors (2)

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

They were moving too quickly!

That’s when Huang Fulin and Zhao Rui travelled past the flaming birds and appeared right in front of Lin Xiu.

Clang clang clang – —

Seeing how they were coming at him with their weapons, Lin Xiu widened his eyes and tried to block their attacks with his long spear.

The attack of these sage warriors was too strong.

Although he wasn’t injured by it, the impact of the attack was able to throw Lin Xiu to a far distance.

They’re so strong!

Lin Xiu started getting serious as well.

He gathered his thoughts and released his ‘sphere’!

Both of them were sage warriors and if he got hit by any of their attacks by mistake, it could be fatal!

‘Thousand Thunders’!

As Lin Xiu’s body was still travelling in the air from the impact, Lin Xiu quickly brushed his log spear and there were roaring thunder and lightning that came tumbling down from the sky.

Koong Loong – –

“Useless tricks!”

As Huang Fuling looked at the lighting that was coming from the sky, he scoffed.

He gathered his thoughts and released his ‘sphere’ as well.

Zhao Rui did the same as well.

As both of them released their ‘sphere’, they just allowed the current from the lightning to hit on their spheres and did even bother dodging it.

These lightning did not cause any damage to them.

They were well protected inside their ‘sphere’.

‘Thousand swords released’!

Then, Zhao Rui sneered and threw his sword towards Lin Xiu.

The sword that left his arm suddenly splited into thousands of swords!

“Go1!”

As he waved his hands, thousands of those swords immediately headed towards Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank when he saw those swords.

This was because he could clearly feel the power of the thousands of swords combined together.

They were scary!

There seemed to be a split in the space around them as the sword rushed towards him.

Lin Xiu thought about it and a balck sourcemark appeared on his forehead!

As he used the energy from the sourcemark, there were a large number of arrays that appeared in the air.

The array trapped all thousands of the swords that were aimed at Lin Xiu.

Boom boom – –

As soon as the array got all the swords, it quickly induced an explosion!

There were a few that weren’t caught and landed on Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’ but that did not affect Lin Xiu.

“A spatial sourcemark?!”

Huang Fulin and Zhao Rui frowned.

The spatial sourcemark was a peculiar one and there weren’t many warriors who would be able to obtain it successfully.

Plus, as the warrior became stronger, the energy from the spatial sourcemark would grow as well.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

While they were still in shock, a large number of arrays that were similar from before appeared in front of them, trying to trap them inside.

But, their reflexes were too quick. None of the arrays were able to trap them.

‘Breaking the Ancient’!

Huang Fulin, who was in the air, started screaming as well as he pulled out his machete!

As he raised his machete above his head, there was a huge figure that appeared and was headed towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu wanted to run but from his side view, he could see that Zhao Rui was already eyeing his next position.

He already knew where Lin Xiu would be running to and Zhao Rui would be able to kill him instantly.

As soon as Lin Xiu moved, he would be able to finish Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu had no other choice but to take the attack face forward!

Seeing how it would be a strong one, Lin Xiu sneered and gathered all of his source energy!

His ‘sphere’ was now stronger than ever.

“Young master!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Sima Qiang got worried when he saw what was about to happen to Lin Xiu!

A long time ago, he was picked by the Ye family and had been brought up by them.

He was truly grateful towards the Ye family.

He always remembered the teaching of the Ye family.

Since Lin Xiu was the one who came with the Imperial Order, he was definitely the young master.

Seeing how Lin Xiu wanted to block the scary looking warrior skill, he wanted to rush over to help!

“Where are you going?!”

Heilong and Bailong started to attack Sima Qiang from two different directions.

Sima Qiang did not know what to do.

Both of them were getting closer to him and he didn’t have the opportunity to help Lin Xiu who was far away from him.

Heilong and Bailong were sage warriors and Sima Qiang wouldn’t be able to kill them alone.

It was already an extremely difficult thing for him to block their attacks.

“Go to hell!”

At that moment, the huge figure of a machete was about to land on Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

With a loud sound, the machete landed on Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’ and they fell onto the ground.

It was like a meteor that landed on the ground.

The entire Wildfire City started shaking.

The entire ground was covered with a thick layer of dust.

“Hmph!”

Huang Fulin looked at Lin Xiu who fell to the ground and sneered at the thick layer of dust that was formed.

He didn’t get to break Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’ even with his strongest skills.

The only thing that he did was throw Lin Xiu onto the ground and he wasn’t happy with it.

“Huang Fulin, you aren’t that strong after all.”

Zhao Rui glared at Huang Fulin and sneered.

“Aren’t you the same as well?”

Huang Fulin said bitterly.

Both of them had chosen the skills that only belonged to sage warriors but none of them would kill a respected warrior.

This was shameful for both of them.

Boom– –

Suddenly, there was a weird noise coming from above them.

Huang Fulin and Zhao Rui, who had good hearing, realised that something was coming as well and quickly looked above them.

That’s when they saw a huge opening that appeared out of nowhere!

“What’s that?”

Both of them were shocked when they noticed it.

The opening got bigger and bigger and suddenly, there was a huge, black claw that came out of the opening.

The huge claw was tearing the opening, making it bigger and the head of the monster slowly appeared.

It was a huge lizard covered in black scales!

Black Scale Crazy Lizard was one of the evolved beasts that Lin Xiu could summon!

The evolved beasts that could be summoned by Lin Xiu would be similar to Lin Xiu’s ranking which meant that this beast was similar to a saint beast!

“Looks like your skills aren’t that great after all.”

Just then, Lin Xiu’s figure suddenly reappeared from the thick layer of dust.
