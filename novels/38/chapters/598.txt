Chapter 599: Call Me Master!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu turned his eyes to the front. On the beach outside the academy, there was a girl with two ponytails facing away from everyone.

The sea breeze blew, blowing both her ponytails.

“Why do I find her somewhat familiar?”

Lin Xiu looked at her back at this moment. For some reason, there was always a very familiar feeling.

But searching for the memories in his mind, Lin Xiu still didn’t seem to remember who it was.

He walked forward and the girl suddenly turned around.

Seeing her face, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and his eyes were filled with disbelief.

“Why are you here?”

Lin Xiu was a little stunned.

Ouyang Hang was a little curious when he saw this scene.

Who is this girl?

“You haven’t seen Master for so long yet you don’t even look surprised.” The girl curled her lips and said.

Boom–

Hearing the girl’s words, Ouyang Hang staggered and almost fell to the ground.

“She is your master?”

Ouyang Hang’s eyes widened, with a look of disbelief.

Lin Xiu was very strong, and he didn’t come from a big family at all. Ouyang Hang always thought that Lin Xiu had an expert behind him to guide him.

It is actually a girl?

This is too nonsensical.

“Baili Haoling? You...you’re a woman?”

Lin Xiu widened his eyes and continued to speak.

Lin Xiu had guessed that she was a woman after seeing her fair skin and tender flesh before, but he never thought that this was actually true.

“Is this the way you speak to me – call me Master!”

Baili Haoling put her hands on her hips at this time, and then said to Lin Xiu arrogantly.

“Hehehe...”

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched, and he said with black lines all over his head.

“By the way, don’t tell me you’re... the old man’s daughter... No, granddaughter, huh?” Lin Xiu pointed at Dean Baili behind him, and said aloud.

“What do you think?”

Baili Haoling looked at Dean Baili, and then revealed a smile.

“Let me introduce you, Baili Haoling, my granddaughter.”

At this time, Dean Baili touched his beard, then glanced at the people around him, and said aloud to them.

Ouyang Hang and others nodded and then greeted Baili Haoling.

Boom boom boom —

At this moment, a huge airship flew over from the academy.

Soon, they stopped on the beach at the entrance of the academy.

“Okay, it’s almost time. After arriving there, it’s almost time for the competition.”

Dean Baili looked at the people around him and smiled.

“Ouyang Hang, can you do it?”

Dean Baili seemed to have thought of something at this time, and then said to Ouyang Hang.

Because Ouyang Hang just had a fight, it seemed that he had suffered a little injury.

“I’m fine.” Ouyang Hang straightened his back and said confidently to Dean Baili.

“Okay, students, I wish you a smooth journey all the way. This time, bring glory to our academy!”

At this time, as everyone stepped onto the airship, Zhang Yin and others waved to Lin Xiu and said goodbye.

“Phew.”

Lin Xiu entered the airship and couldn’t help but let out a sigh of relief, Warriors Conference!

It was the first time that Lin Xiu felt excited about an event.

He wanted to see how strong the warriors in the world are!

“Eh? You seem to be much stronger.”

Baili Haoling glanced at Lin Xiu at this time, and then said to Lin Xiu aloud.

“Of course.”

Lin Xiu said proudly at this time.

“However, still weaker than me.”

Just when Lin Xiu was complacent, Baili Haoling shook her head and said.

Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched, glared at her, and then instinctively used the Analytic eye.

But what surprised him was that this Analytic Eye didn’t work on Baili Haoling!

It showed that she couldn’t be analyzed!

No way?

Lin Xiu’s eyes were filled with disbelief. He was now a rank 8 warrior. Logically speaking, he should be able to analyze a rank 9 warrior.

“Hey, is she really your master?”

Just when Lin Xiu felt curious, Ouyang Hang patted Lin Xiu on the shoulder and said aloud.

Hearing Ouyang Hang’s words, Lin Xiu pouted and said, “Yes.”

This is really a cheap master...

“Why, young man, don’t you believe in my strength?”

When Baili Haoling heard Ouyang Hang’s words, she looked at him at this moment, and then said.

“You’re not even 16 years old this year? Call me a young man?”

At this moment, Ouyang Hang laughed.

Because Baili Haoling was not tall, and now she tied a double ponytail, and with her tender-looking face, she looked like a young girl. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Want to give it a try?”

Baili Haoling looked at Ouyang Hang and said with a strange smile on the corner of her mouth.

“Come on.” Ouyang Hang also stood up at this time and said to Baili Haoling.

Lin Xiu covered his mouth and forehead, not wanting to watch the ‘cruel’ scene.

It didn’t take long for Lin Xiu to hear a whimper from Ouyang Hang.

“Xiao Zhenzi, Xiao Yaozi, come, help big sister make a cup of coffee.”

At this moment, Baili Haoling seemed to have the appearance of an older sister, lying on the rocking chair over there, instructing those people.

And Ouyang Hang, now sitting next to Lin Xiu with a bruised nose and a swollen face, was grimacing in pain.

“Why didn’t you tell me she’s so powerful...”

Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu and said resentfully.

“You are the one who wants to compete with her.”

Lin Xiu looked like he had nothing to do with it.

Moreover, Lin Xiu didn’t expect that Huang Zhen and Qian Yao seemed to know Baili Haoling from the beginning, but at this time, they were like dogs, helping Baili Haoling to pour tea.

Looking at Baili Haoling’s appearance, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but have black lines all over his head.

Boom boom boom —

The airship flew very fast, and at the next moment, the body of the airship swayed.

Then, it seemed like they were landing.

“Eh? We’re landing?”

At this time, Lin Xiu held his dark edge spear and stood up.

“I’m ready to go to Nanyang City.”

Baili Haoling was still lying on the rocking chair and didn’t seem nervous at all.

On the other hand, Ouyang Hang took a deep breath and clenched the long sword in his hand.

This time, he wasn’t fighting for himself but on behalf of the Sacred Region Academy.

He couldn’t make mistakes.

“Everyone, we’re here.”

At this time, a staff member of the Sacred Region Academy came over and said to the crowd.

“En, let’s go.”

Lin Xiu nodded. After the airship stabilized, Lin Xiu started walking towards the exit.

As soon as he got off the airship, Lin Xiu realized that he was on top of a huge tall building!
