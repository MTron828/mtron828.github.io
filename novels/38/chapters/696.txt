Chapter 697 Let Me Use the Sword

The two fists collided together, and a huge sound was instantly emitted.

Lin Xiu’s fist had dark red flames and this terrifying lightning.

‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’!

However, this attack, which seemed to be a powerful skill, actually collided with Wu Changkong’s fist, and it seemed that it could not cause any damage to Wu Changkong at all!

And at this moment, Wu Changkong’s left hand smashed directly on Lin Xiu’s head!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly when he noticed this scene, but Wu Changkong’s punch was too fast.

For a while, Lin Xiu failed to dodge.

Boom

In the next moment, Lin Xiu’s head was blasted to pieces!

“Brother Lin!”

Seeing this scene, Lei Tong and the others couldn’t help but stood up and shouted loudly.

“Hahaha, this kid is finally dead!”

“I told you so, with this kid’s strength, how could he possibly defeat Wu Changkong.”

“Wu Changkong killing him is as easy as crushing an ant.”

Just when the people around were in an uproar, Wu Changkong frowned slightly.

“What kind of skill is that?”

The next moment, he turned around and looked behind him, as if speaking into the air.

The rest of the warriors also reacted at this time. Looking closely, Lin Xiu’s ‘corpse’, whose head had just been blasted, seemed to disappear into the air like a cloud of smoke.

And at the same time, where Wu Changkong looked, Lin Xiu’s figure suddenly appeared.

“This is the skill of the earthlings.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, and then said lightly. Although Lin Xiu had a glove on his hand, Lin Xiu still felt a faint pain in his fist after the punch he had just collided with Wu Changkong.

“Interesting.” Wu Changkong smiled faintly, then looked at Lin Xiu, and continued to say, “But no matter what it is, you will stay here forever today.”

“Who will stay here forever, we don’t know

yet.”

Lin Xiu also said with a faint smile.

In the next moment, the figures of these two people disappeared at the same time!

Bang bang bang

Soon, the two were fighting together, like two phantoms, so that people around them couldn’t see their movements clearly.

Lin Xiu was very focused at this time, but when he was fighting with Wu Changkong, he was still in a defensive state.

Sure enough, there was still such a big gap between a rank 9 warrior and the so-called master warrior.

Without thinking much, Lin Xiu directly activated the ‘Fury’ skill!

After his warrior level had risen to the ninth rank, with the bonus of the ‘Fury’ skill, Lin Xiu felt that the strength of his body increased crazily!

Looking at Wu Changkong’s punch again, Lin Xiu leaned to the side and dodged, then smashed out with a backhand punch!

The speed of Lin Xiu’s punch was extremely fast, which was fundamentally different from just now.

Wu Changkong didn’t seem to have imagined that Lin Xiu would be able to explode with such a powerful force, and he was caught off guard by Lin Xiu’s punch on the shoulder.

With a dull sound, Wu Changkong’s body also flew out because of this powerful impact.

But after flying out for a while, he stabilized his body.

“You hid your power!?” Wu Changkong’s eyes changed slightly, staring at Lin Xiu over there.

He could clearly feel that the power Lin Xiu used just now was very strong. After being attacked by Lin Xiu in the shoulder, he could clearly feel a little pain in his shoulder.

“Brother Lin was really scared to death just now.”

Lei Tong and the others heaved a sigh of relief now, they thought that Lin Xiu was killed by Wu Changkong just now.

And at this time, Lin Xiu even counterattacked and hit Wu Changkong, which shocked them even more.

Every time they thought this was Lin Xiu’s limit, the power that burst out made them even more shocked.

“The real battle should begin.”

Lin Xiu waved his right hand, and the Dark Edge spear that had just been pierced on the competition stage began to tremble slightly. There was a sound of ‘clattering’.

Soon, the Dark Edge spear flew directly towards his hand!

Swoosh

The Dark Edge spear flew into Lin Xiu’s hands.

“Let me use the sword.”

Wu Changkong said lightly, and then took out the giant sword from behind him. The giant sword looks very heavy, but he can hold it with one hand easily as if he is holding plastic.

And this giant sword looks very sharp, with a faint cold glow on the blade.

“Wu Changkong is using his sword! Looks like he is serious now!”

“Look! Wu Changkong is about to make a real move.”

When some warriors saw this scene, they immediately became excited like a fanatical fan.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath. Now in the state of ‘Fury’, Lin Xiu felt that his strength seemed to have broken through the ninth order.

Lin Xiu became more and more excited with the power that filled his body.

The ‘Fury’ skill has a time limit, so he needed to race against the clock!

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, and in the next moment, his body moved, and Lin Xiu, who was holding the Dark Edge spear, rushed over! At the moment of sprinting, the Dark Edge spear was constantly waving, and the flaming birds were released one after another.

Boom boom boom —

Those flying flame birds frantically charged toward Wu Changkong.

But Wu Changkong’s reaction speed was too fast. All these flames hit the competition stage, and the entire competition stage shook. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Wu Changkong’s face also became serious. He dodged Lin Xiu’s flaming birds. As he approached, Lin Xiu swung the giant sword in his hand directly!

On the blade of the giant sword, a dazzling cold light bloomed.

The power of this sword is too great, as if it will cut through the space!

Wu Changkong was going to kill Lin Xiu with a single blow!

But Lin Xiu was not dumb either. Lin Xiu has mobilized all the power in his body now, and because he just fought, the power-up strike can already be activated.

The power of this blow was also extremely powerful!

Boom

As the weapons of the two collided, a very loud sound suddenly erupted.

The people around covered their ears subconsciously and felt as if their eardrums were about to be shattered.

Lin Xiu and Wu Changkong both retreated at the same time, but immediately, holding their own weapons, they fought together.

‘Tiger descends the mountain’!

Lin Xiu roared in his heart, the source strength in his body seemed to have transformed into a huge tiger, waving its claws, and following Lin Xiu’s offensive, it rushed towards Wu Changkong!
