1338 Wall Covered by Warrior Skills Cards

When Xiao Qingchen heard what Riyan God Lord was saying, he was stunned.

He didn’t understand what those words meant!

The God’s Blood. Is it still possible for him to get it?

“Damn it…”

!!

Lin Xiu gritted these two words as he sat cross legged on the ground.

The God’s Blood was aggressive. It was rushing into every inch of his body as if it wanted to destroy his body.

However, Lin Xiu had a quick and powerful healing system in his body. With the destruction and healing happening side to side, his body has been built to be much stronger than before.

Huu…

Time passed and just when Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, the golden glow around his body disappeared.

It felt like he had been reborn and it felt comforting.

“Well, it does look like a huge enhancement.”

Riyan God Lord looked at Lin Xiu who stood up and he smiled.

“The God’s Blood is incredible.”

Lin Xiu smirked as well.

It may be horrifying but there has been a huge improvement in his strength along with his body build.

When he looked at his stats, it had increased over 100 points!

It was considered a huge leap.

Lin Xiu could also clearly feel the growth in his strength.

“I didn’t think that I would actually lose to you.”

Xiao Qingchen stared at Lin Xiu and there was a smile on his face.

He wasn’t a sore loser and he didn’t look unwilling that he lost to Lin Xiu. He had already accepted the truth.

“Let me introduce myself again. Xiao Qingchen.”

Xiao Qingchen smiled at Lin Xiu before stretching out his right hand.

“Lin Xiu.”

Lin Xiu was a little caught off guard but still shook hands with him.

They were only fighting to gain victory when they were on stage. There was no hatred or grudges between both parties.

Since the fight was already over, there was no bad blood between them.

“Huuuu…”

Suddenly, they heard someone panting behind them.

When they turned around, Yuan Zheng was standing on top of the stairs.

Well… Yuan Zheng was in a bad state.

It was obvious that he had suffered quite a bit while trying to get up the stairs.

“Three minutes. That’s not bad.”

Riyan God Lord stared at him before commenting about it.

“Greeting, God Lord.”

When Yuan Zheng saw how Lin Xiu and Xiao Qingchen were already there, he was shocked.

However, he soon came back to his senses and greeted Riyan God Lord respectfully.

“En.”

Riyan God Lord gently stroked his beard before waving his right arm.

There was one wooden box left on the table and it was given to Yuan Zheng.

“This is your reward.”

The reward for being second runner up

Yuan Zheng was stunned at first but he quickly reacted and caught the wooden box.

Although he was third in place, it was still an incredible gift.

“This time, only the top three of the Multi-city Contest will be allowed here. Do you know why?”

Riyan God Lord looked at all three of them as he spoke.

Lin Xiu, Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng shook their heads.

“Come over here first. The God King has been waiting for you on the other side.”

Riyan God Lord decided to remain mysterious about it and did not give them a clear answer.

Then, he walked to the back of the room.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and followed Riyan God Lord to the back of the pavilion.

This was because there were still three god-level warrior skill cards!

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng hesitated for a moment but they soon followed as well.

“Hu…..it would be great to cultivate here.”

...

Baili Haoling, who was waiting at the bottom of the stairs, sat cross-legged on the ground. Then, she started cultivating.

The energy in the air around them was incredibly rich.

Being able to cultivate here will be great!

“Me too.”

Since they had no idea how long Lin Xiu would be at the Central Pavilion, Lei Chong did not want to waste this chance as well.

He sat cross-legged on the ground as well.

He quickly started his cultivation and started absorbing the energy around him into his body.

It felt as if his body was about to blast.

As for Rollie and Little Bai, they were jumping around happily.

It seems like the rich energy in the air around them caused them to be more excited than before.

On the other side, Lin Xiu walked to the back of the pavilion under the guidance of Riyan God Lord. After some time, they finally reached an exit and there was an eye-piercing light that came from it.

...

Such powerful energy!

Plus, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the energy beyond the exit was much more powerful than the ones they had here.

Riyan God Lord fastened his footsteps and Lin Xiu did the same.

As soon as they walked inside it, Lin Xiu was forced to narrow his eyes.

The entire place was shining brightly.

When they took a closer look after going through the exit, there was a huge wall in front of them.

The wall was made of a special type of jade.

There were a large number of warrior skills cards and all of them were placed inside a glass case.

The entire wall was covered with these warrior skills cards!

As he looked at the scene before his eyes, Lin Xiu was incredibly shocked.

God-level warrior skills card!

Plastered on the entire wall!

There would be at least thousands of them!

The ones here were so much better than what they had at the store.

The largest store in God City only had about a hundred of them.

“All of these….are god-level warrior skills cards?”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng were both shocked as well when they saw the wall and their eyes were opened wide.

There were so many god-level warrior skills cards here that it felt like a dream.

The bright glow that came from it almost blinded them.

“These are the collections of the God King. There’s a total of 3081 pieces.”

Riyan God Lord saw how surprised they were and explained to them about the cars. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“That’s a lot…”

Yuan Zheng gulped.

His eyes were fixed on the cards and they were filled with excitement.

He has never seen so many god-level warrior skills cards!

Lin Xiu even had an impulsive thought of taking the entire wall with him.

It’s amazing that there are so many warrior skill cards here.

“According to the rule, Lin Xiu came first and you can pick three. Xiao Qingchen who came in second will get two. As for Yuanzheng, you’ll get one.”

“Now, you can start choosing the cards that you want.”

Riyan God Lord gave the instructions.

“Can we take any one of them from here?”

As soon as the Riyan God Lord was done, Xiao Qingchen quickly asked.

As he looked at the cards on the wall, he already had one that he liked.

“That’s right. You can take any of it from here.”
