1232 The Explosion Of Baili Haoling

Then, Sha Qiang was already standing right in front of Baili Haoling.

“By now, you should know how powerful we are.”

Sha Qiang stared at Baili Haoling who was standing in front of him as he smirked.

With that said, he raised his right arm into the air.

!!

Inside his palm, there was a group of source energy that looked like a bundle of sand.

As he moved his right arm, it was aimed directly at Baili Haoling’s head!

Go to hell!!

Sha Qiang had a vicious look on his face as he roared internally.

Boom – –

As he moved his right arm, Baili Haoling who was covering her wounds with her right hand suddenly moved.

Her hands that were covered in blood directly collided with Sha Qiang’s right arm.

Then, it was followed by a huge explosion.

The bundle of energy source that was in Sha Qiang’s arm instantly disappeared because of Baili Haoling.

Due to the strong impact, Sha Qiang’s body was then pushed far away into the distance.

He had to take a few steps in order to stop and then, he stared at Baili Haoling in disbelief.

When he took a closer look, he noticed that Baili Haoling was staring at him!

Baili Haoling’s eyes were now blood red and they were both filled with bloody murderous intentions!

What was happening?!

“Stop making me a fool!!!”

Sha Qiang was starting to feel frightened by the peculiar look on Baili Haoling’s face. He roared in rage before gathering a tornado like source energy in both hands. It was once again aimed at Baili Haoling.

She did not dodge the attack. She waited for the tornado to reach her body and then, there was a large amount of blood red energy that was released.

It immediately stopped the attack from Sha Yuan!

What on earth was that?!

Seeing how there was blood red energy that came from Baili Haoling’s body, Sha Qiang looked even more shocked.

He has never seen such a peculiar looking energy.

Plus, he could clearly feel that these were strong energies.

The energy in this was different from the source energy of the other warriors.

This definitely wasn’t source energy!

Then, Baili Haoling placed her right hand over her wounds. Then, there were a large amount of red threads that came out from the tip of her fingers.

All of these threads were formed by a special type of energy.

Soon, with the energy that were in the form of red threads released from her fingertips, they gathered around the wound on her body.

These threads then quickly closed the wounds on Baili Haoling’s body.

It happened very quickly. The horrible looking wound had already healed and it can no longer be seen.

Such terrifying healing powers!

Sha Qiang looked unhappy about it.

From his peripheral view, he noticed that there was a machete on the ground. With the control of his mind, he picked up the machete from the ground.

He leaped with both legs and went straight for Baili Haoling.

He transferred all of his energy onto the machete that was in his hands.

Due to the transfer of energy, the machete was enveloped in a thick layer of purple energy.

You’re dead!

With both hands on the machete, he rushed towards Baili Haoling and swung the machete at her body!

Boom – –

However, Baili Haoling raised her left hand and caught the machete instead.

Sha Qiang widened his eyes in shock as he couldn’t believe his eyes.

That strike contained the energy from his entire body and she managed to catch it so easily with her hands???

Now, he was trying his best to pull out the machete but he realised that no matter how hard he tried, it wouldn’t budge.

“Go to hell.”

Baili Haoling’s condition now was a little different. She spoke in a completely different tone as she stared at Sha Qiang.

With that said, all of the blood red energy that was around Baili Haoling’s body suddenly released a large amount of threads! All of them were headed towards Sha Qiang!

When Sha Qiang saw what was happening, his pupil shrank and he quickly released the energy in his body.

With the energy covering his body, it worked like a ‘sphere’.

Shhhh– –

However, with the peculiar noise, all of the threads that were formed by the red energy instantly broke through his ‘sphere’ and went around his body!

These red threads that were formed by the energy around Baili Haoling wrapped itself around his body.

As his body was getting completely covered by the red threads, he could feel that the forces in his body were getting surprised by something that he couldn’t see.

At this point, he could no longer use them!

“Who…..who are you?!”

Sha Qiang was starting to feel panic.

He has never met such a peculiar energy.

“You’re dead.”

However, it was as if Baili Haoling could not hear him as she continued to mutter to herself.

With that said, the red threads that were around Sha Qiang’s body instantly tightened itself!

Hmmm…..

There was a soft groan as Sha Qiang could no longer scream. HIs entire body was then crushed into multiple pieces by the red threads that were around his body.

He instantly turned into chopped meat.

Baili Haoling remained unmoved in the same position. It looked as if she had entered a peculiar zone.

As for Lin Xiu, who was still in the air, his eyes were wide open and his body was still struggling.

His entire body was covered with the black energy. No matter how hard he tried, he still couldn’t free himself from it.

Plus, all this black energy was trying to infiltrate Lin Xiu’s body.

These were source energy and there was no way for him to stop them!

Soon, all of them were infiltrating Lin Xiu’s body at a quick speed!

When Lin Xiu noticed how the energy around him disappeared, there was a surprised look in his eyes.

Everything around him turned pitch black and he entered into his own mind.

“HAHAHAHAHAHA!!!!”

Inside his mind, there was a loud laughter all around him.

Then, there was a huge figure of Sha Yuan that appeared in his mind. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Surprise?”

“Did you think that you could really kill me?!”

“Your body will now be under my control!!!”

Sha Yuan’s voice appeared in Lin Xiu’s head.

“You’re taking it away from me?”

Lin Xiu stared at the huge face that was in his mind.

These black energy that had infiltrated his body seem to control it now.

“Hehehehe….goodbye!”

There was a vicious look on that huge face.

“No….I should be the one telling you that it’s over!”
