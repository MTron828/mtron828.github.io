Chapter 392: I Want The Deadly Battle!

After Lin Xiu looked at them this way, they suddenly felt like they were in an ice cave.

How was this possible, they were rank 6 warriors, how could they be afraid of a rank 5 warrior!?

But the speed at which Lin Xiu attacked just now was so fast that they were stunned.

Pa pa pa——

At this moment, a round of applause came from the side.

The few men looked to the side and suddenly saw a figure that they found familiar.

“Student Zhang?”

Seeing Zhang Liangqian walking over there, they behaved very respectfully.

“Oh? It’s you.” Lin Xiu raised his brows when he saw Zhang Liangqian walking by and said indifferently.

“That’s right, it’s me.” Zhang Liangqian said while looking at Lin Xiu.

“Seems like you’re not dead yet, huh.”

“You are not dead, how could I die?” Lin Xiu laughed.

Hearing the exchange between the two men, these men were even more surprised.

Because they all know that Zhang Liangqian was a relatively famous sophomore student and he often went out to the dangerous area outside the academy to complete tasks.

But this freshman now actually dared to talk back to Zhang Liangqian.

They appeared to have enmity between them.

“Haha, interesting, really interesting.” Zhang Liangqian burst into laughter when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

But in the next moment, as he retracted his smile, his whole face became gloomy, “Do you think I really can’t deal with you?”

His eyes were sinister.

He wanted to kill Lin Xiu right here, but if he did, he would be dealt with by the Sacred Region Academy.

“If you had appeared over at the dark forest, you would have died there.” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes at him and said.

There was killing intent in his eyes.

The surrounding air seems to have fallen to the freezing point at this moment.

Both of their stares seemed to generate electricity.

“I want to fight with you in the Sacred Region battle.” Zhang Liangqian looked at Lin Xiu and said.

The Sacred Region battle was a decisive battle in the Sacred Region field at the highest point of the Sacred Region Academy. There were many students enrolled in the Academy and all of them were the pride of the heavens and gifted talents from various places.

Of course, these arrogant students were competitive. There were often conflicts and people who gad grievances would generally resolve them in a decisive battle.

“No.” Lin Xiu shook his head.

When they heard Zhang Liangqian inviting Lin Xiu to fight in the Sacred Region battle, the guys were shocked.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s rejection without hesitation, they wanted to laugh out loud.

It seems that Lin Xiu didn’t have the guts after all.

Just when they were about to laugh, Lin Xiu said, “I want to fight in the Deadly battle.”

Deadly battle!?

Hearing these two words, Zhang Liangqian’s face suddenly changed.

His face became more gloomy.

“Are you serious?” Zhang Liangqian said coldly, staring directly at Lin Xiu.

“Ordinary battles are so boring, we should make it a little more interesting, right?” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said.

The men around also heard Lin Xiu’s words. By ‘interesting’, Lin Xiu meant deadly ah!

With this thought, they couldn’t help but gasp in shock, this Lin Xiu was so ruthless!

“Okay! I’ll fight you!” Zhang Liangqian took a deep breath, then gritted his teeth and said.

There were still a few students of the same level next to him so he couldn’t reject Lin Xiu, otherwise, where would he hide his face?

And he didn’t believe that Lin Xiu, a rank 5 warrior, could really defeat him!

“Tomorrow then.” Lin Xiu said faintly as he looked at Zhang Liangqian with no fear in his eyes.

“Sure!” Zhang Liangqian responded.

“I hope you’ll come.” Lin Xiu glanced at him meaningfully, then walked directly to the other side without looking back.

The men who stopped Lin Xiu just now didn’t dare to make any moves.

They were not fools either, Lin Xiu dared to challenge Zhang Liangqian, he must have certain strength.

“Student Zhang, this freshman is really arrogant.” The man who had his wrist grabbed by Lin Xiu suppressed the sharp pain from his wrist, then he said to Zhang Liangqian.

“He has the right to be arrogant.” Zhang Liangqian looked at Lin Xiu’s retreating back, then said in a deep voice.

Of course, it was necessary to know everything about who he was dealing with.

From the time he came back, Zhang Liangqian looked up Lin Xiu’s information and found that Lin Xiu had secured first place in the freshmen orientation, which shocked him.

“Is he really that Lin Xiu?” A man seemed to recall something, then said a little surprised.

“That’s right.” Zhang Liangqian nodded.

But so what if he’s the top freshman? After all, he was still a rank 5 warrior and he couldn’t even unfold the ‘Sphere’.

And he could look up all the videos of his battle at the Sacred Region Academy. As long as he studied them carefully tonight, Lin Xiu would definitely lose!

With this thought, he clenched his fists tightly.

Lin Xiu had already returned to the villa at this time. After connecting the refrigeration box to the power source, there was a steady stream of air-conditioning coming out of the box.

“You go inside first.” Lin Xiu looked at the little ice crystal white bird in his palm, then said with a smile.

Squeak——

It seemed to be able to understand Lin Xiu’s words. The little ice crystal white bird’s wings that have not yet grown feathers moved, then when Lin Xiu put his hands in the box, it jumped into the box.

The refrigeration box is very cold, but for this ice crystal white bird, it seemed to be the best place to live.

At this time, as it went inside, it seemed to become happy and kept walking around in the box.

“It’s quite interesting.” Lin Xiu looked at this little ice crystal white bird like it was his pet, and felt very novel and fun.

Lin Xiu was sitting next to the refrigeration box at this time and when he activated his mind, he entered the system interface in his mind.

He had accumulated three lottery chances and hadn’t had time to use them yet.

At this moment, Lin Xiu did not hesitate and went directly to the lottery interface.

As expected, the number displayed below the number of draws was: 3.

Without hesitation, Lin Xiu clicked directly to start the draw and entered the familiar big lottery wheel interface. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Seeing the lottery interface, Lin Xiu couldn’t help feeling a little bit emotional. It seemed that a long time has passed since the last lottery draw.

This time the lottery interface was still the same as last time and the lottery wheel was still divided into ten grids.

Three of the grids were skill cards, three of the grids were Odd crystals and three of the grids were potential pills. The last grid occupied a very small space and it was still the grand prize.
