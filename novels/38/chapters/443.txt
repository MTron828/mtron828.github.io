Chapter 444: A Mission

Lin Xiu looked at the screen as well and he noticed that there was a familiar figure on the screen.

Wait… isn’t that him?

That place, if Lin Xiu was correct, was where he got isolated as a punishment.

The screen was clearly showing how his body was continuously absorbing the energy from the lightning that was striking from above.

“You train yourself with Lightning. I didn’t think that there would be someone with this talent in our academy.” Dean Baili was still stroking his beard as he spoke to Lin Xiu.

“Plus, you injured all of my Thunderbirds.”

“Dean, are you planning on punishing me for it?” Lin Xiu was acting boldly as if he wasn’t afraid of anything. He shrugged his shoulder as he asked the elderly man.

“Don’t panic. Just continue watching for now.” Dean Baili smiled.

Lin Xiu went back to watching what was being played on the screen. This time, the entire screen went black and the scene before them was pitch black.

There was a black figure in the scene, who was seated on top of a tube in the basement. There were currents running all over his body and it was a very horrifying scene.

But, the man had not turned into ash because of the current; instead, the only thing that happened was that his skin had turned black after being electrocuted by the strong current.

When Lin Xiu saw the figure before his eyes, Lin Xiu’s pupil constricted on its own, uncontrollably. The scene that was being shown now was of the time when he went to the power station with Ouyang Hang.

He thought that he had destroyed all the security cameras around him and he wasn’t aware that there was a hidden camera in that zone.

“Although we couldn’t clearly see who this person is, it does look like you from the figure itself.” The middle-aged man from a while ago spoke up once again.

When he saw Lin Xiu on the stage during the battle, he thought that this man looked familiar. Then, as Lin Xiu released the Mirror Image skill, the feeling grew.

Well, truth to be told, as soon as they compared the image digitally, they knew that the man who got electrocuted that night was Lin Xiu.

“You’re still trying to deny it?!” The middle-aged man glared at Lin Xiu.

He was still pissed at the fact that Lin Xiu had escaped that very night. From his perspective, it was an embarrassment that he had lost a student that he was trying to catch.

“Yes, that’s me.” Lin Xiu said it indifferently. Since they already had all the evidence, it wouldn’t make sense if he continued denying it.

“But, Sir, I don’t think you got me here so that you can talk to me about this.”

“How could you speak in this manner?!” The middle-aged man, who was already very unhappy with Lin Xiu, stood up and was about to punish Lin Xiu.

“Sit down.”

Then, Dean Baili’s voice rang in the room and the middle-aged man quickly got back to his seat without another word.

“You should know that with what you’ve done, it is enough for us to expel you.” Dean Baili told Lin Xiu.

“But you wouldn’t do that.” Lin Xiu smiled.

“If you were to expel me, you wouldn’t want to meet me here.”

“Haha… you’re very smart.” After hearing Lin Xiu’s answer, Dean Baili smiled as well. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“You’re right. I will not expel you but under one condition.” Dean Baili continued.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes in suspicion as he asked, “What is it?”

It would be impossible for him to leave the academy now since it was the only place that had the resources that could help him cultivate.

Plus, they weren’t trying to punish him.

No… perhaps the more accurate explanation was that they needed something from him; they needed his help.

“Complete a mission.” Dean Baili lifted up one of his fingers and told Lin Xiu.

“How can this be? What mission could it possibly be that the dean would have to get a first-year student like me to complete?” Lin Xiu smiled as he asked but in fact, he was quite shocked by the news.

Dean Baili, who was sitting opposite him, was a rank 9 top warrior. How difficult would the mission be that someone so powerful like him would need help from Lin Xiu?

Lin Xiu didn’t understand why.

“How could you speak in that manner?!” The middle-aged man from before was now very unhappy with Lin Xiu and started screaming at him again.

However, Dean Baili ignored him and continued talking to Lin Xiu, “There is a place where none of us can go.”

They can’t go?

“Where is it?” Lin Xiu asked subconsciously.

“Dean!”

Everyone around him seemed to have thought of the same time, and there was a change in their expressions as they looked at the dean.

From their reaction, Lin Xiu got even more curious. What was the Dean doing that got them so worried, causing all of them to look so flustered.

“Don’t worry about it.” Dean Baili waved his hands at the rest of them before turning towards Lin Xiu.

“Below.”

“Belos us?” When Lin Xiu saw the dean pointing towards the ground, Lin Xiu was confused.

“To be more accurate, it is actually below this island in which the Sacred Region Academy is built.” Dean Baili answered Lin Xiu’s beard while gently stroking his beard.

“There is something beneath this island?” Lin Xiu was surprised by what he heard and quickly asked.

“En. From our radar, there seem to be movements of a special type of energy. We need you to find it, catch it, and destroy it.” Dean Baili face turned serious as he explained it to Lin Xiu.

“There are so many powerful people here in this academy, why do you need me?” Lin Xiu raised his hands in confusion.

“It’s necessary.”

“Because you’re not powerful enough.”

When Lin Xiu heard the dean’s reply, his eyes widened in shock. What did the dean mean by saying that he isn’t powerful enough?!

What is this old man trying to do?

“Don’t panic.” As if the Dean could read what was on Lin Xiu’s mind, he continued, “There are lots of evolved beasts underneath the island and some of them are very sensitive. Whenever they sense a strong, powerful warrior, they would rage and this would cause a lot of unnecessary problems.”

“However, with your abilities that isn’t too powerful nor too weak. Plus, with your special skills, you are the most suitable candidate. ”

“What will I get?” Lin Xiu thought about it before asking another question.

“Little brat! Don’t you dare ask for anything else? What you have done before this was enough for us to throw you out of this academy!” When the middle-aged man heard Lin Xiu asking for something in return for the mission, he punched the table hard and screamed at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu ignored him and was looking at the dean.

“Alright. As long as you complete the mission, you can ask for whatever you want.” Dean Baili smiled as he promised Lin Xiu.

“Dean!”
