Chapter 238: Lin Xiu Was Killed!?

Bang bang bang——

At this time, as Lin Xiu dodged the crescent-shaped sword aura, cracks appeared on the wall behind Lin Xiu.

Obviously, it was all because of Yu Yi’s sword aura.

These sword auras were too terrifying. If an ordinary warrior got hit, his body would probably be cut in half by this sword aura!

“Hng!” Yu Yi saw Lin Xiu dodging and gave a cold snort, then continued to attack Lin Xiu!

The opened ‘circle’ on his body slowly contracted at this time and formed a small protective shield around his body.

In this situation, if you want to attack his body, you could only do it once the protective shield disappears.

And the protective shield was supported by his majestic source strength.

As long as his source strength was still there, this protective shield would not disappear so easily!

Lin Xiu obviously knew this as well. At this moment, his brows were slightly knitted as he raised his spear and continued to rush over!

The strongest defense was offense.

This was where the Profound intent of ‘Overlord Spear Art’ lies.

When he rushed over with the Dark Edge spear, Lin Xiu clearly saw that there were white rays around Yu Yi’s body.

Lin Xiu knew that, in this case, he could use the profound intent.

‘Profound Intent·Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!

As Lin Xiu became more and more familiar with the ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ skill, it was easy to use the profound intent of ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’.

It was different from the normal ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’, this time the skill was even more terrifying.

Yu Yi had just rushed over and all he saw was cold light everywhere.

Seeing this shocked him.

How many times did Lin Xiu thrust his spear within a second!?

But he didn’t have time to think about it, the tip of the spear was about to pierce his body!

It seemed like there was almost no way to block Lin Xiu’s attack.

Dang dang dang——

Yu Yi instinctively swung his long sword and blocked.

There were sounds of metals colliding as he used his sword to block the attacks.

He felt that the long sword in his hand was violently attacked by the spear and his hand was getting numb.

There were bursts of explosions in the air.

But Lin Xiu thrust his spear too many times in this short period of time, making it impossible for him to block them all.

There were at least a dozen attacks from Lin Xiu’s spear which he couldn’t resist.

But fortunately, the “circle” he unfolded protected his body. At this moment, he was unharmed.

Terrifying, it was simply terrifying.

Yu Yi was surprised at the start but now he was completely shocked.

Lin Xiu may not have caused any harm to him, but since the beginning of the battle, Lin Xiu has been suppressing him.

It could be said that Lin Xiu completely overwhelmed him in terms of aura.

“Is Yu Yi hiding some tricks?” At this time, people around couldn’t help whispering.

“It is possible, otherwise it is impossible to keep getting beaten by this freshman.”

Some people began to have a puzzled expression on their faces.

This battle was different from what they had imagined. They thought that Lin Xiu would be suppressed and beaten the entire time, but didn’t expect that it was the other round instead!

The current battle was really unusual. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

After all, Yu Yi was a rank 6 warrior and Lin Xiu was a rank 5 warrior.

But now the situation was completely reversed.

Although Lin Xiu’s attack did not cause any harm to Yu Yi, Yu Yi also failed to attack Lin Xiu!

And this was when Yu Yi was in the state of the ‘circle’.

“Don’t get too arrogant, I shall let you see my true power!” Yu Yi obviously sensed the weird looks from the crowd and suddenly felt a little bit ashamed and angry.

Looking at Lin Xiu, he became even angrier.

At this time, he yelled suddenly and the source strength on his body burst out again and again.

The long sword in his hand also rang loudly at this time!

He charged towards Lin Xiu again!

A faint light appeared on the long sword like it was filled with some terrifying energy.

Lin Xiu saw this and the pupils in his eyes constricted as his hands gripped the spear in his hand tightly.

“‘Against the current'”‘ Just as he was about to rush to Lin Xiu’s side, the long sword in Yu Yi’s right hand suddenly swept across the air. The light on the long sword burst out suddenly and the source strength seemed to be transformed into streams of water that splashed out.

The second it splashed out, these water droplets emitted a white mist and turned into little sharp ice drops.

They all rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Bang bang bang——

Lin Xiu reacted quickly and wanted to block.

But there were way too many small ice drops and they hit the back of Lin Xiu’s hand that was holding the Dark Edge spear.

There was a tingling sensation.

Blood began dripping out of Lin Xiu’s arm in an instant.

This skill was too weird, it could actually hurt him just like that?!

Just as Lin Xiu blocked the small ice drops, he looked up and Yu Yi disappeared!

Where did he go!?

Lin Xiu was startled. In the next instant, Lin Xiu seemed to have felt something and he turned around immediately. Then, he found Yu Yi holding the hilt of the long sword with both hands and roared with a sinister look on his face, “Go to hell!”

Bang–

With the long sword slashing down, a dull sound rang out and Lin Xiu’s body was divided into two!!!

“Ah!!!”

Some girls saw this scene and screamed.

This was really horrifying, Lin Xiu was actually cut in half!

“Lin Xiu!” Zhang Yin and the others couldn’t help but yelled when they saw this scene.

How could it be! Lin Xiu was cut in half!

They couldn’t accept this.

There was an uproar in the audience. They thought that this battle would last for a long time, but didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would be killed now!

And he was even cut in half!

“Dead!?” Ouyang Hang saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes constricted.

But before he could rejoice, he recalled something and his heart thumped.

Because he remembered that a strange scene like this happened in the battle between Lin Xiu and Zhuo Qixing the day before yesterday.

“Pay attention! Something is weird!” Ouyang Hang stood up at this moment and shouted.

Yu Yi, who was looking at the “dead” Lin Xiu with a smile, suddenly had a change in his facial expression.
