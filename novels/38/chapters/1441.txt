1442 Underneath the Stone Gates

Hmm?

Lin Xiu looked surprised.

He didn’t think that there would be bumps all over the stone gates!

This was because from the looks of it the gates were supposed to be smooth.

So…..

!!

Could it be that he has to fill up these dents with his source energy?

Lin Xiu thought about it for a moment before gathering the energy in his body and placed them on the dents on the gates.

Then, with that, the marks on the gates lit up brightly.

“This…..”

Luo Huatian was beyond shocked.

Lin Xiu continued releasing the energy onto the stone gates.

As more energy filled the stone gates, the entire gate was covered with bright light-threads.

They became more obvious and were looking at the ones that Lin Xiu saw with his Analytic Eye.

It was like a god’s sourcemark.

“Why did it suddenly light up?”

Luo Yue was stunned as well.

“I filled it with my energy.”

Lin Xiu answered her question as he gave one last push.

Lin Xiu then started panting.

He had used up almost half of the energy in his body.

Then, he quickly activated the ‘cultivation technique’.

Lin Xiu immediately started absorbing the energy from the air around him.

“I don’t think it’s opened yet.”

He looked confused.

“That’s impossible…”

Lin Xiu looked lost as well.

He looked at the gate that was shining brightly beneath his feet.

Logically speaking, he should have been able to open it now after doing what was hinted by his Analytic Eye.

Perhaps…. He has done something wrong?

Boom – –

Suddenly, there was a loud sound that followed!

The entire ground started shaking like mad.

Suddenly, the gates opened.

All three of them were caught off guard and started free falling!

F**k!

Lin Xiu couldn’t stop his body from falling and he couldn’t steady himself.

As they continued, Lin Xiu had a horrible look on his face.

This was like a black hole and they continued falling for a very long time.

If he didn’t control himself in time and if there were any sharp things at the bottom, they would end up dead!

However, no matter how bad he tried, he still couldn’t. He had no control over his own body!

Luo Yue and Luo Huatian were facing the same problem as well!

After some time, Lin Xiu then finally felt that he could finally gain control over his body.

The speed at which they were falling had slowed down as well.

“Could this be….the core of the planet?”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

They have been falling continuously for a long time and none of them remembered how long it has been.

They only got the chance to steady themselves now.

“There’s light down there.”

Luo Yue then found something interesting.

Light?

Lin Xiu felt surprised and as he looked down, there was indeed a dim light seen.

Plus, as they slowly descended, the light became brighter.

It seemed like the entire ground beneath them was brightly lit!

“Damn it!!!”

At the same time, there was a man in the air near the Black River.

He was furious as he looked at the river.

Before this, he clearly saw that the Black River had been split apart.

But, when he got close, the Black River returned to its original state.

“The tool spirit! The Tool spirit must be inside!!!”

The man was infuriated.

They have already searched the entire planet but none of them could find the legendary ruins and the tool spirit.

This was the only place where he couldn’t get close to.

This was because the river contained dark energy that was rich and horrifying.

No one dared to get close to it.

“You are all dead for going against the Tianshen Pavillion.”

The man roared in rage.

However, he still couldn’t do anything about the Black River.

He had no other choice now but to dive into it.

“What is this place?”

Lin Xiu’s body finally reached the ground.

As he could finally stand on both feet, Lin Xiu looked surprised.

The ground was covered with a white glow. They couldn’t see what it was but Lin Xiu could clearly feel that rich energy that came from it.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and tried to absorb the energy from the ground.

Then, all of the energy rushed into Lin Xiu’s body.

Within a short period of time, all of the energy that Lin Xiu lost earlier has been replenished.

“Such powerful energy.”

Luo Huatian also noticed the rich energy beneath his feet and he was incredibly shocked.

“Both of you can also try absorbing the energy from the ground.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Lin Xiu told them about it before moving around to take a look at where they were.

It was an oval-shaped area that was wide.

The walls around them were smooth and pitch black.

Lin Xiu reached out his arms to the walls but he couldn’t find any hidden buttons.

Then, he decided to use his Analytic Eyes.

However, there was nothing that it could find.

“This is the Ruins?”

Lin Xiu was confused.

This was the first time that he had seen such ‘ruins’.

There was nothing that they could see.

Other than the ground that was shining brightly.

Along with the rich energy coming from it.

“Forget it. Since we can’t find anything now, I might as well just continue absorbing the energy here.”

Lin Xiu then sat cross-legged on the ground and started cultivating.

Luo Yue then followed what Lin Xiu was doing.

Seeing how both of them sat on the ground, Luo Huatian decided to do the same.

The energy here was intense and it would be a waste not to absorb it.

Lin Xiu then decided to activate ‘Engulf’.

But, he soon noticed that it was impossible to use the skill to absorb the energy beneath them.

What was going on?!

Hmm?

Lin Xiu got curious again.

These skills couldn’t absorb the energy here? What energy do these lights contain?

Lin Xiu then touched the ground with his hands. Similar to before, the ground looked smooth but there were actually bumps and dents all over it.

As Lin Xiu continued touching it, it felt as if he had accidentally pressed on one of the dents.

The hidden button?!

Boom – –

Then, the entire place started shaking.

Luo Yue and Luo Huatian opened their eyes as well when they felt the ground shaking.

The ground then splitted into two!

Even the bright lights were split into two!

Following that, it seemed like there was something that was slowly coming from the ground!
