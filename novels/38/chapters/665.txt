Crap.

Lin Xiu could feel the sharp pain all over his body. He could no longer keep himself steady anymore.

The most fatal wound on his body was the one on his chest.

If it wasn’t because of the white glowing energy source that Lin Xiu had, keeping him alive; he would have died right away.

“Huh? She’s not here?”

As the man walked towards Lin Xiu, he asked out of curiosity

Lin Xiu had initially palnned on thrusting his spear into the man but after seeing that this man wasn’t one of the warriors sent by the three families, Lin Xiu just held onto the spear in his hand and did not move recklessly.

With his current condition, one small movement could cause intense pain.

It was too much.

“You don’t have to look at me that way. I don’t mean any harm.”

The man shook his head while speaking to Lin Xiu.

“Lam just a little interested in what you have in your pocket.”

With that said, the man reached out his left hand.

Suddenly, Lin Xiu noticed that the man’s hand was glowing with a faint red hue.

Soon, Lin Xiu felt a slight movement in his pocket and the thing that he kept inside appeared on the man’s palm.

As he took a closer look, this was the thing that the powerful young girl gave to Lin Xiu during the competition.

She said it was some candy and Lin Xiu believed him; completely forgetting that he had something like this in his pocket.

‘Tm sorry but I was the one who made this. May I know how you got it?”

The man looked at Lin Xiu.

“Uhm….she gave it to me on the stage…”

Lin Xiu coughed and a huge mouthful of blood came out of his mouth. Then, he continued telling the man what had happened.

Lin Xiu could feel that this man was extremely powerful and the weirdest thing was that the man really meant no harm.

‘There was too much pain and Lin Xiu could no longer stand. He quickly sat down on the ground.

This was a dark, secluded alley. Even if those men were still looking for him, it wouldn’t be that easy.

“Hmmmm ….so that’s what happened.”

‘The man nodded his head and opened the packet, “Looks like you’re badly injured. You have eaten them now.”

‘The man said to Lin Xiu before passing him the thing that was in the man’s palm.

Lin Xiu was confused. He had no idea what this man wanted.

“Just take it. It will help you recover from your injuries.”

The man said to him slowly.

Recover from these injuries?

How is this possible?

Lin Xiu thought that the man was joking and just as he was about to shake his head, he could hear footsteps heading towards him.

Sounds like those warriors were getting closer to him!

“Oh? Looks like you have quite a lot of enemies.”

“Since you’re the apprentice of my descendant, we’re related somehow. Let me help you.”

As he continued telling Lin Xiu, he stuffed the thing into Lin Xiu’s hands.

“Found him! He’s over here!”

At the same time, there were dozens of warriors running towards Lin Xiu!

These warriors seemed strong and powerful. Most of them were rank 7 warriors!

“Move aside!”

‘When the warriors saw the men standing next to Lin Xiu, they screamed at him.

They were about to use their weapons to attack Lin Xiu!

The man showed a peculiar smile on his face before moving his arms. Then, there were strands of energy that looked like thread being released from his arms.

‘When the warriors noticed what he was doing, they immediately activated their ‘Yuan’.

Even so, these scary looking threads instantly pierced through their ‘Yuan’ and landed on the warriors!

“Goodbye.”

The man said calmly before sweeping his arm once again. With that, all of the warriors were chopped into tiny pieces by the threads that were tied around their bodies.

It was a bloody, horrific scene.

‘When Lin Xiu saw what happened, his eyes widened in shock.

That was terrifying. This man was so powerful!

With their ‘Yuan’s released, the man could still easily kill all of them with only one attack?!

“Take them so that your wounds will heal or else, you might end up dead.”

The man turned around and said to Lin Xiu who was sitting on the ground.

Lin Xiu stared at the packet that was in his hand. He was a little hesitant but soon, there was a determined look in his eyes.

He had no other choice but to trust this man now.

‘Then, he poured the entire packet into his mouth.

It did taste like candies as it was chewy. After chewing it for a minute, he immediately swallowed them.

‘As soon as he did that, he could feel a warm feeling in his stomach that slowly spread to the rest of his body.

Lin Xiu was surprised when he felt what was happening.

“I’m leaving now. I’ll get rid of the rest of them who are out there.”

The man smiled as he said.

As he was leaving the alley, the man held onto his forehead and muttered to himself, “I shouldn’t have brought them back first. All of them are having fun without me.”

Lin Xiu was still shocked by how powerful the man was but now, with the warm feeling spreading from his stomach, he did not have the time to think about anything else.

Soon, he was overtaken by darkness and Lin Xiu passed out.

After a period of time, Lin Xiu suddenly felt a cold breeze that blew across his body.

As he slowly opened his eyes, he could see the sky slowly turning bright.

“Cough cough…”

Lin Xiu coughed a little before realising that he was lying on the ground and there was a huge pool of blood around him that was dried.

He’s … fine?!

Lin Xiu suddenly shivered and thought of something. He looked down at his chest. There was still blood around but he could no longer feel the pain.

After checking the wound on his chest, Lin Xiu realised that the wounds has been closed and it seemed to have completely recovered.

Soon, Lin Xiu remembered what happened before he was unconscious and was once again shocked by what had happened.

‘That candy….had such strong healing powers?!

Lin Xiu looked around and noticed that the bodies of the warriors had gone missing.

Looks like someone had already cleaned up this place.

He suddenly thought of the mysterious man and Lin Xiu felt even more curious. Who was he?

He definitely heard the man say that he was the apprentice of his descendant…

Just as Lin Xiu was deep in thoughts, he could hear a soft whisper. The look in his eyes changed, prepared to stab his spear towards his enemy!

“Uncle Ye?!” When Lin Xiu’s spear was about to leave his hand, he suddenly noticed who it was.

“Young master!” As soon as Ye Kai confirmed that it was Lin Xiu, his eyes were filled with joy.

“We have to leave now! You are now a captive of Sky City!”

Ye Kai suddenly thought of it and quickly reminded Lin Xiu..
