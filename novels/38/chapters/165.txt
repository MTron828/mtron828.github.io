Chapter 166: Only Five Times

“Class Monitor, what happened to you…” Early next morning when Lin Xiu opened the training grounds door, the people inside saw Lin Xiu with a pair of panda eyes and did not know whether to laugh or cry.

“Lin Xiu, did you get beaten up by miss Luo?” Lei Lei knew that the two black eyes were from punches and giggled as she asked.

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched, but he did not respond.

‘She’s too violent, I merely touched her breasts accidentally, right? Why did she blow up?’

“Lin Xiu ah, you can’t use strength to subdue a girl.” Zhang Yin walked over and shook his head with a sigh. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Do you want me to pass down a secret manual to you…”

“Oh? You seem rather professional at it.” Lei Lei’s eyes turned cold as she pinched him with her right hand.

“I am not!” The immense pain caused his facial muscles to distort as he forced out an extremely ugly smile.

Lin Xiu laughed at the comedic sight.

He walked into the training grounds and activated the gravity room.

“Congratulations, Class Monitor to be number 1 freshman of the Tower of Tournament.” Li Ping had been completely convinced of Lin Xiu’s strength and walked over to congratulate him.

Lin Xiu chuckled and did not respond.

“What is the Tower of Tournament?” A few students asked.

“It is Sacred Region Academy’s…” Li Ping looked at their curious looks and had no choice but to explain.

All their expressions turned to surprise when they finished listening to him.

21 floor, the strongest of class 1, Zhou Qixing was on the 21st floor?

All of their gazes towards Lin Xiu were filled with even more reverence

That’s too strong, right!

“Alright, let’s get ready to train, let’s persevere for five hours.” Lin Xiu announced when he saw that his classmates had arrived and swept his gaze across them.

“Alright!!!”

Everyone had recognized Lin Xiu at this time and agreed in unison when they heard him.

Lin Xiu nodded his head in satisfaction and slotted his card in, revealing the value of 36390 points. The 1000 point of reward for being first in the freshmen ranking had been credited into his account in the morning.

Lin Xiu hit the two times gravity without hesitation.

Everyone’s expression changed when the gravity was activated. Although they had persevered for three hours the previous day, they were still not used to the change in gravity.

On the other hand, Lin Xiu felt fine with the only difference being his body being slightly heavier.

‘Seems like the training yesterday was effective.’

Everyone sat cross-legged and engaged their cultivation techniques. They had yet to acclimatize themselves to gravity and could not walk around freely like Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu stood in the center and swung Dark Edge. It took more effort to swing Dark Edge around under the two times gravity.

Basic spear arts!

After sparring with Luo Yue Lin Xiu knew that aside from skills, fundamentals were extremely important as well.

Thrust, stab, rapid strike, attack, swing…

He engaged and practiced in various spear arts.

Time passed and some students could no longer endure close to the five-hour mark.

They did not activate gene lock like Lin Xiu to increase the base strength of their bodies, and as it was only their second training, their weaker tolerance was considered normal.

“20 minutes left, it’s not time yet. You guys better sit there.” Lin Xiu waved his spear and spoke up.

The students that had originally planned to rush out of the room persevered with clenched teeth when they heard Lin Xiu.

Ding!

The set time of 5 hours finally passed and the increased gravity was released.

600 points were deducted from his card.

“Whew.” The heavy gravity was dispelled and everyone laid on the ground weakly while gasping for breath.

After seeing everyone feeling slightly better 10 minutes later, Lin Xiu chuckled, “Alright, we will be going for three times gravity training, anyone wants to continue?”

Upon hearing Lin Xiu’s words, everyone who just wanted to lie down and rest immediately got up and ran out.

‘Bullshit, we are already like this under two times gravity, are you asking us to die under three times gravity?’

Lin Xiu laughed when he saw them run and was about to continue training when he heard a disturbance outside.

“Class monitor! There’s a beauty outside looking for you!” Li Ping shouted out loud.

Everyone started to add on excitedly.

Lin Xiu stopped in his tracks and turned to look and saw a white figure.

“Why’re you here?” Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide as he asked Luo Yue, who was dressed in white and carried her thin sword with her.

“I’m out of points.” Luo Yue spoke as-a-matter-of-factly.

The corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched as his face was covered with lines. This lass is actually treating me as her own ATM.

“Class Monitor, is she your wife!” Li Ping shouted at the top of his lungs.

All the people outside started to laugh.

All the girls that had a crush on Lin Xiu immediately had ashen expressions.

“Shut up, otherwise you will join me in three times gravity!” Lin Xiu glared at those who were laughing and shouted at them.

Upon hearing his words, everyone scattered like birds and beasts.

Luo Yue walked over to the side and pressed on the machine.

Very quickly, the machine started up and the doors closed.

Lin Xiu felt his body turning heavier when he saw her move. Suddenly, he was forced to the ground.

It was not only his body but even the blood circulation in his body became extremely difficult.

“Damn, how many times gravity did you input.” Lin Xiu glared at her and asked with much difficulty.

Lin Xiu felt as though he was under a thousand catties and his body was unable to move an inch.

“Only five times.” Luo Yue replied indifferently.

Five times?!

“Young Master Zhuo, Luo Yue did not come?” Right at this time in a similar gravity room, a guy looked at Zhuo Qixing and asked.

“She went over to Class 10.” Zhuo Qixing replied with a gloomy look on his face.

After he saw yesterday’s broadcast, Lin Xiu had become a real threat to him.
