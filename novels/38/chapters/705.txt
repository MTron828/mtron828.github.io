Chapter 706 The Power of Special Skill

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu felt the terrifying force coming in, snorted coldly at this moment and directly unfolded the dark red ‘Sphere’ to block all the attacks.

The rest of the rank 9 warriors also used their most powerful skills to attack Lin Xiu at the same time.

It seemed that they wanted to blow up Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” directly.

At this time, Lin Xiu was attacked by terrifying forces caused by a large number of skills and even Lin Xiu could not see clearly.

Is he dead?

At this time, the surrounding warriors stared at that side.

“Clean Sweep’!”

At the next moment, after the power of those skills disappeared, a loud shout came.

A terrifying force erupted in the next moment. Forming a black energy arc, it generally charged out.

These rank 9 warriors opened their eyes wide and instinctively wanted to use the ‘Sphere’ to resist the attack.

But in the next moment, the expressions on the faces of these rank 9 warriors froze.

Even the body seemed to be fixed in place.

“What’s wrong?”

The old man frowned.

He also heard the roar from Lin Xiu just now and at this moment he felt a terrifying aura.

But this terrifying aura just appeared for a moment, then completely disappeared.

No terrifying skill appeared at all.

But at this time, the rank 9 warriors seemed to be stuck in place.

“What happened to them?”

Lu Jian also clenched the long sword in his right hand and said aloud.

His voice trembled a little, because the power that Lin Xiu showed right now was a little too powerful.

Bang bang bang

Just as the man’s words fell, he remembered with a dull sound, a large amount of blood spattered from the waists of these people.

These rank 9 warriors were all broken in half by the waist!

Crackling

And the branches not far from them also seemed to be neatly cut off at the same time and all broke off.

“Phew.”

“Next up, is it you guys’ turn?”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, looked at the old man over there and said.

The ‘Clean Sweep’ that he just used was the skill acquired by this special skill card.

He had to admit that the power of this special skill card was really too powerful, beyond Lin Xiu’s imagination.

The ‘Clean Sweep’ that he was using was still incomplete because he had no way of completely learning ‘Clean Sweep ‘in such a short period of time.

But even so, the power that just erupted really startled Lin Xiu.

This is too scary, isn’t it?

“I don’t believe that you still have strength! Let’s go!”

The old man took a step back subconsciously, but in the next moment, he still gritted his teeth and roared, holding a long sword and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

He asked those people to attack Lin Xiu first so that they could use up Lin Xiu’s strength.

Originally, he thought that when these people were fighting, he could find a good opportunity to kill Lin Xiu, but he didn’t expect that so many warriors would be killed by Lin Xiu so easily.

Damn!

‘Breakthrough Slash’!

The old man mobilized with the strength of his body. At this moment, his body jumped straight up, holding the sword in his hand and slashing down at Lin Xiu from top to bottom!

With his slashing, the entire space seemed to be chopped in half!

Lin Xiu watched this scene and the pupils in his eyes shrank.

The power of this blow was really too great, a bit beyond his expectations.

The ‘Breakthrough Slash’ used by a master warrior-level warrior could actually burst out such a powerful force.

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in both hands and blocked the blow with the body of the Dark Edge spear.

The sword slashed on the body of Lin Xiu’s spear, making a loud noise.

Lin Xiu’s entire body was under too much force and his legs were directly embedded in the rocks on the ground at this time.

This old man was really strong ah… Lin Xiu gritted his teeth, then his hands slammed hard, which sent the old man flying.

Then Lin Xiu jumped straight up.

The spear turned into hundreds of slashes and charged straight ahead.

“Humph!”

When the old man saw this scene, he snorted coldly and as the source strength in his body was mobilized, he flew directly into the air.

Lin Xiu’s attack hit the air!

Lin Xiu raised his eyes and looked up and saw the old man’s body suspended in the air, he didn’t seem like he was about to fall at all.

Hm?

Lin Xiu frowned slightly. Logically speaking, he might be able to control the speed of his fall a little, but there was no way he could be suspended in the air like that.

“What kind of skill is that?”

Lin Xiu looked at the old man in the sky and said aloud.

“Hmph, haven’t the people of the indigenous planet seen it? This is ‘Levitation’.”

The old man looked at Lin Xiu’s surprised expression and said with a sneer.

“However, you don’t have the chance to learn such skills. Now… just die!!!”

With a roar, he let go of the sword in his hand and floated in the air.

It seems that because a large amount of source strength was transmitted to the suspended sword, the sword burst out with golden rays of light. “Go!”

And at this time, the old man waved his hands to both sides and this sword, through the source strength, turned into hundreds swords, directly charging down to Lin Xiu below!

Whoosh whoosh

Whooshing sounds could it heard as if the space had been torn apart!

This large-scale attack covered the entire mountaintop!

“Get out of the way!”

Lu Jian and the others also wanted to sneak attack on Lin Xiu, but when they saw this scene, their expressions changed drastically.

They jumped down the mountain road with the rest.

This skill was the old man’s most terrifying skill. Lin Xiu’s expression changed slightly when he saw this scene.

But now it was not Lin Xiu’s turn to react. It was as if hundreds of swords had already charged over.

Bang bang bang

Although Lin Xiu unfolded the “Sphere” to resist, but being hit one after another by these swords, Lin Xiu still felt that something was wrong.

Because the impact of these swords was really too great and after a closer look, Lin Xiu found that cracks had begun to appear on his dark red ‘Sphere’ because of the constant impact of these swords!

The expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed greatly.

For a long time, Lin Xiu thought that only he had the ability to break the ‘Sphere’, but he never thought that this old man’s skill seemed to be able to break the ‘Sphere’ too!
