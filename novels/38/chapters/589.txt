Chapter 590: The Last Day

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“This is the top floor?”

Lin Xiu widened his eyes in surprise as he asked in disbelief.

“But...”

“With your abilities, you shouldn’t have to challenge the remaining floors.”

The man shook his head.

Lin Xiu wanted to cry. He wanted to challenge them badly!

Although each floor was dangerous, Lin Xiu was still able to fully train his body in different aspects whenever he faced those horrifying floors.

“Plus, do you wish the news of your getting to the top floor spread around like wildfire?”

The man stared at Lin Xiu’s eyes before saying bluntly.

“You will end up dead.”

“But...”

Lin Xiu was caught off guard but before he could say anything, the man already went to the other side of the floor.

“You shall stay here then.”

“You would only be able to leave once you finish reading through all the books here.”

“No way!”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“Sir, the elementary rounds are next week and I would like to participate.”

Lin Xiu thought about using the challenge card that could be used to leave the tower but then he was reminded that all of them had been completely melted on the floor that was filled with lava.

“The time spent here is different from the one outside.”

The man replied and then his figure slowly disappeared from the floor.

“Sir!”

Lin Xiu screamed. He looked around the floor and noticed that it was completely empty, the man was nowhere to be seen.

It was as if the man had never appeared.

Hmph ....

Lin Xiu sat on the floor helplessly. It has already been an entire day since he started fighting the rock monsters and he didn’t have the time to recover from it. Therefore, he decided to lie down on the floor.

Lin Xiu was exhausted and decided to take a nap first.

Since he wasn’t allowed to leave now, Lin Xiu didn’t bother thinking about it and immediately fell asleep.

At the same time, on the other side.

Sky City.

“You will be going for the match tomorrow.”

A huge, muscular man sitting by a huge chair spoke to a young girl who was busy practising her sword in the courtyard.

She was dancing with her sword and her skills looked exquisite.

As her sword moved around the air, it was accompanied by sounds of explosion.

“Yes, father.”

The young girl answered while continuing to practise without any pause in between.

“I heard that you were close with a boy called Lin Xiu at the Sacred Region Academy?

The man rested his chin on his palm and suddenly asked.

When she heard the question, the young girl’s woman started trembling and her steps became messy.

This young girl was Luo Yue.

She was just like before, with her signature cold, hard face. Even when she was with her father, it was still the same.

“Who said so?” Luo Yue’s eyes were filled with a murderous look as she asked the question.

“It doesn’t matter.” Luo Yue’s father shook his head.

“You should just stay in Sky City and stop thinking about leaving!”

Then, there was another young girl that appeared from behind her. She looked similar to Luo Yue but instead of the cold look that Luo Yue had, this young girl seemed to be a little sexier.

“Shut up if you don’t want to die.”

Luo Yue looked at her and said in a stern tone.

“Little sis, you shouldn’t be so cold or else no men would like you.”

The young girl laughed.

Luo Yue immediately turned her sword and aimed it towards her sister.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

The sword travelled at incredible speed and the air was once again filled with sounds of continuous explosion.

However, the other girl was quick as well and dodged all of the attacks.

“Oh my….little Luo Yue, why do you want to kill your big sister?”

The young girl laughed and it sounded like bell’s ringing.

When Luo Yue attacked for the second time, she completely disappeared before Luo Yue and ended up behind Luo Yue instead and was hugging her.

“Let go of me!”

Luo Yue was shocked as no matter how hard she pulled away, she still couldn’t set herself free from her sister’s hug.

“Oh my….I haven’t hugged you for a very long time. This feels good.” The young girl continued hugging onto Luo Yue with a satisfied look on her face.

“Luo Yan, let go of your sister.” Luo Yue’s father shook his head before speaking to them. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Hmmmm….boringggg.”

The young girl known as Luo Yan finally let go of her sister, Luo Yue.

“Do you think he will come?”

Just when Luo Yue was about to leave, her father asked with a mindful look on his face.

Luo Yue paused for a moment before muttering to herself, “He will.”

“Luo Yue?”

At that moment, Lin Xiu who was on the top floor suddenly opened his eyes. Then, he noticed that he was still at the same place, in the Tower of Trials.

“It was a dream...”

Lin Xiu thought of how he dreamt of Luo Yue and shook his head.

It has been days and Lin Xiu truly missed that cold, unfriendly young girl.

“Sir?”

Lin Xiu stood up and called for the middle aged man but there was only echo of Lin Xiu’s own voice. The middle aged man did not appear.

He saw that there were table lamps around and the floor was extremely quiet.

“Finish reading all the books here? How is it possible?”

Lin Xiu thought of what he was told earlier that day and shook his head helplessly.

He said that it was impossible but Lin Xiu still walked towards one of the shelves and picked up a book.

These books weren’t about warrior skills, instead it was about evolved beasts.

He flipped through it and got interested in the book which was why he decided to read it.

In the middle of the floor, there were a variety of weapons that have been placed on the floor. Lin Xiu put aside his Dark Edge spear, picked up a sword and started practising with it.

Since he was stuck here, he might as well try some of the weapons here.

Although it would be impossible for him to train to the level of a master, it would still be possible for him to be familiar with each of them.

Time passed by quickly and Lin Xiu had no idea how long it had been since he entered the floor.

However, the warrior skills that have been recorded inside these books were too tempting and some of them were diaries of those legendary martial art masters. It was definitely something that Lin Xiu enjoyed reading.

Lin Xiu would be busy training during the day until he felt exhausted and would fall asleep on the floor.

With the analytical eye, Lin Xiu would be able to remember all of the details in the book just by looking through it once.

Lin Xiu also noticed that each time he woke up from his sleep, there would be a bottle of healing potion next to him.

This was definitely something that the middle aged man left behind.

It has been so many days but Lin Xiu still hasn’t met the middle aged man.

After some time, Lin Xiu finally finished the last book on the floor.
