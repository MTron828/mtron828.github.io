Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The staff member opened his eyes wide and looked at the stack of entry cards that Lin Xiu took out, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“You…”

“I eliminated them all.”

Lin Xiu stood in front of him and continued to speak.

This is not real, is it...

The staff member rubbed his eyes at this time and took over the stack of entry cards in Lin Xiu’s hand, his eyes still full of shock.

“How... how did you do it?”

The staff member looked at Lin Xiu, then secretly swallowed and said.

This is just ridiculous, he has never encountered such an exaggerated thing.

Did you get rid of the dozens of warriors by yourself?

“Using my fists.”

Lin Xiu smiled indifferently, then walked directly to the front.

“How do I report this to the top...”

The staff member looked at the back of Lin Xiu leaving, with a bitter look on his face.

“Somenoe’s out! Someone’s out!”

At the same time, the warriors who were waiting over there looked to the front, and saw Lin Xiu walking over.

“Why did you come out so quickly?”

Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu who was approaching, his eyes widened at this time, his eyes filled with disbelief.

“The job’s done so I came out.”

Lin Xiu spread his hands and said.

The students from the rest of the academy also looked at Lin Xiu with great curiosity at this time.

Because the time was not up yet yet, why did Lin Xiu come out?

Could he be eliminated?

“You... were eliminated?” Ouyang Hang thought of a possibility and suddenly said nervously.

“Do you think it’s possible?”

At this time, Lin Xiu said in disbelief.

For me now, those warriors were simply beings that can be easily defeated.

“Tsk tsk, boy, it looks like you’ve been eliminated! It’s a pity, even if you beat us, you can’t even advance in the end.”

Zhao Qian looked at Lin Xiu who was coming back and immediately sneered.

Some warriors around heard Zhao Qian’s words and thought that Lin Xiu was the first to be eliminated. At this time, they also looked at Lin Xiu like he was a joke.

“Quite fast.”

Baili Haoling was drinking coffee at this time, looking at Lin Xiu with a look of approval in her eyes.

“You really won?” Ouyang Hang said again in disbelief.

“Of course.” Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

“The only ones who can advance are us.”

“Great!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s affirmative words, Ouyang Hang also knew that Lin Xiu was not joking, and at this time he was also ecstatic.

While Huang Zhen and Qian Yao were pleasantly surprised, their eyes were also full of shock.

Those people, were all eliminated by Lin Xiu?

If this is the case, then Lin Xiu’s strength is too terrifying.

Just when those warriors were looking at Lin Xiu mockingly, the previous staff member had come out again.

He looked around for a while, and when he saw Lin Xiu’s figure, he couldn’t help but take a deep breath when he thought of what had just happened.

There was a surveillance drone above the forest. After checking the video just now, the staff was even more shocked.

Indeed, as Lin Xiu said, those warriors were all defeated by Lin Xiu.

And it was still with absolute strength that he defeated them without giving them the ability to fight back.

This strength is really terrifying.

“Now announcing, the academy that advanced.”

The staff looked at the students around, took a deep breath, and said aloud.

“Announcing it now?”

“It’s only been less than an hour, right? How can the result come out so quickly?”

“Yes, what the hell is going on...”

When the surrounding warriors heard the staff’s words, they were all extremely surprised at this time.

“The colleges that could advance this time are...”

Although they were very puzzled, when they heard the staff member’s announcement, they were all focused.

“The Sacred Region Academy.”

The staff glanced at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

The Sacred Region Academy?

Hearing these four words, these warriors couldn’t help being shocked. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Because they knew that Lin Xiu was representing the Sacred Region Academy in the snatch match, but Lin Xiu came out so quickly, wasn’t it because he was eliminated?

How could it be that the Sacred Region Academy could advance?

“And?”

After the staff member said the Sacred Region Academy, he didn’t announce other academies. Hearing these words, some warriors around couldn’t help but speak out.

“No other colleges left.”

The staff member glanced at them, then said after being silent for a while.

“How is this possible!”

As soon as he said the words, the surrounding warriors were stunned for a while, and after they reacted, they all said in disbelief.

“He beat all the contestants and took all the cards.”

The staff pointed to Lin Xiu and said.

If he hadn’t seen those videos with his own eyes, he wouldn’t even believe that Lin Xiu had snatched all the entry cards by himself.

This was unimaginable.

“What!?”

“Impossible! There is an insider! This is definitely a setup!”

Zhao Qian’s face changed greatly at this time, and then he shouted loudly.

He had just laughed at Lin Xiu for being eliminated, but things had totally reversed that he couldn’t believe it at all.

Not only him, but the rest of the warriors also shouted loudly after hearing Zhao Qian’s roar at this time.

The whole scene seemed to be out of control in an instant.

“If you don’t believe me, you can watch this video.”

At this moment, a voice came from the other side.

“Teacher Wu!”

The staff member heard the sound, turned around and looked over, and saw an old man with long white hair walking over.

“En.”

The old man nodded to the staff member, then pressed a switch in his hand, and a projection suddenly appeared on the wall in front of him.

“First of all, let me introduce myself. I am the president of the Nanyang City Branch of the Warrior Union, Wu Tian.”

The white-haired old man glanced at the people around him, and then said lightly.

Hearing his words, the surrounding warriors suddenly quietened down.

They could clearly feel the extremely strong sense of oppression coming from the old man.

The branch president of the Warrior Union!

His strength must be very terrifying!

“Don’t be so excited, after watching the surveillance video, you will understand what just happened.”

The old man touched his beard and said with a smile.

Because of his appearance, those warriors didn’t dare to say any nonsense at this time. They looked at the projection shield on the wall and saw Lin Xiu walking into the forest with a spear.

“Damn! These guys actually ambushed?”
