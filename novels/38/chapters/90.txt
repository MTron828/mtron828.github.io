Chapter 91: Combining skills!

Under Baili Haoling’s guidance, Lin Xiu was able to grasp the skill after running 50 kilometers.

All the man-eating birds that were attracted to the strange powder that was placed on his shirt were instantly killed by a single slash of his. They were all cut into halves, and he used Moving Clouds and Flowing Water to obtain all the Odd Crystals.

Baili Haoling was inwardly surprised at the sight of this. Lin Xiu’s rapid growth was out of his expectation.

At this moment, the progress in Lin Xiu’s mind shocked him. The progress had increased by over 6000 and had decreased the counter in a short span of time.

‘With this progress, I reckon that I’ll complete the mission even before reaching Black Sea City!’

He became excited thinking about it.

“Don’t stop! Keep going!” Lin Xiu began to feel the fatigue after running for 80 kilometers.

After all, the burden from the heavy weights was too huge.

“Ah!” Lin Xiu clenched his teeth and continued running.

Baili Haoling seemed completely fine without gasping for breath or having a flushed face. This made Lin Xiu extremely shocked.

After another half an hour, he finally ran 100 kilometers. Lin Xiu could no longer hold back and sat down on the floor while gasping for breath.

Tiring, it was too tiring.

“You can’t even cover this bit of distance. Back then, I could run a thousand-odd kilometers.” Baili Haoling smirked.

Right at this time, a cold aura shot towards them from another direction.

It was extremely fast and aimed straight for Lin Xiu’s head!

Lin Xiu suddenly looked up while catching his breath, and his pupils immediately constricted when he felt the cold aura. But due to his fatigue, he was unable to react fast enough.

But right at this time, a ‘dang’ sound came out.

Baili Haoling’s figure appeared before him with his blades unsheathed.

“The two of you have been following us since three in the morning. You finally can’t resist taking action?” Baili Haoling spoke up indifferently.

Just as he finished his sentence, two figures, one tall and one short, walked out from the forest.

They carried weird weapons, one had an awl, another had rings.

“Oh? You already knew?” The taller man frowned and asked.

They had indeed found Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling around three in the morning and started following them.

After seeing Lin Xiu’s android wolf and his heavy bag, they became greedy.

But as Baili Haoling’s aura was slightly strong and that Lin Xiu was not weak either, they did not dare move.

They took the opportunity when Lin Xiu was resting and attempted to kill him.

They did not expect Baili Haoling to stop the attack.

Lin Xiu was afraid, the duo had concealed their presence for so long and he did not discover them at all!

He immediately activated Analytic Eye and realized they could not be analysed!

“Yin Yang brothers, Luo Yin and Luo Yang, frequently killing and plundering warriors in the mountainous region of Xing Yao City, am I right?” Baili Haoling glared at the two and said indifferently.

“Oh? Seems like you recognize us?” Luo Yin was the taller man and revealed a look of surprise.

“A man with the bounty of 500 thousand union coins on the federation’s wanted list.” Baili Haoling extended a finger out and said.

Luo Yin looked at Baili Haoling and Lin Xiu sinisterly and roared, “Glad that you know it, hand over your things obediently!!!”

Upon saying that, he charged towards Baili Haoling!

Baili Haoling’s expression remained unchanged as he wielded his sabers. Right at this time, his source strength exploded out.

Lin Xiu subconsciously pushed source strength into his eyes and could clearly see Baili Haoling’s entire body being enveloped by a blue light. It was endless and felt extremely dangerous.

On the other hand, Luo Yin’s awl had white source strength but was much thinner and weaker than Baili Haoling’s.

Clang clang clang-

Sounds were produced by the collision of their weapons.

Baili Haoling’s source strength was too dense, although his sabers only collided with Luo Yin’s awls and did not harm his body, Luo Yin felt immense pain in his arms.

Blood spurted from his arm.

“Luo Yin!” Luo Yang roared out loud.

At the same time, the shorter and stout Luo Yang charged forward with his rings.

Baili Haoling raised an eyebrow as he deflected Luo Yin’s attack with his left hand while attacking Luo Yang with his right.

“Hehehe, when we brothers fight together, our strength reaches the level of a rank 5 warrior!” Luo Yin laughed sinisterly as the duo suddenly leaped into the air.

“Take this!”

“Combination skill – Yin Yang meteor shower!!!”

‘Combination skill?!’

Lin Xiu was surprised when he heard that. A skill that could only be used by two or more warriors were called combination skills. These skills required extremely deep tacit understanding between the users. The slightest err would cause the skill to fail.

But if the skill was unleashed successfully, the power of it would definitely be horrifying.

For example, a combination skill used by two rank 4 warriors could potentially become as powerful as a rank 5 warrior.

Luo Yang threw his rings in the air, which transformed into a yin yang mirage. At the same time, Luo Yin thrust forward with his awl that penetrated into them!

In a split second, the rings unleashed awl-like objects that emitted dense light!

They fell like meteors towards Baili Haoling and Lin Xiu!

This attack was definitely horrifying as it was an area-of-effect attack that blocked off all paths of retreat.

A large area-of-effect attack!

And the power from he skill was definitely one from a rank 5 warrior! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Puny skills.” Baili Haoling smirked as he crossed his sabers above his head and imbued source strength in.

In the next instant, a large force of source strength was unleashed with Baili Haoling as the center. It formed a large sphere that enveloped Lin Xiu and him!

Bang bang bang-

Countless explosions occurred but Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling remained safe inside the sphere.

‘A Rank 6 warrior?!’
