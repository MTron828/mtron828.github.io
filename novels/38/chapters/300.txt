Chapter 301: Su Xie

“Who are you!?” Lin Xiu looked at his ambusher and questioned.

But the black figure had no plans to reply to him. In the next instant, the sword that was stabbed into the rock was pulled out and attacked Lin Xiu again!

Sou-

The sword broke through the sound barrier and produced a loud explosion.

Lin Xiu tensed up and immediately avoided the incoming attack.

While dodging, Lin Xiu stabbed forward with his sword!

Clang-

The other party’s reaction was not slow and directly used his own weapon to clash with Lin Xiu’s spear.

The collision produced sparks.

Lin Xiu was unable to see the other person’s appearance due to the darkness but knew that he was a guy.

Awe of the Phoenix!!!!

Lin Xiu held onto Dark Edge Spear tightly and swung it out to produce a phoenix.

The appearance of the phoenix immediately lit up the entire place.

This allowed Lin Xiu to see the enemy’s appearance – revealing a middle-aged man.

His eyes were filled with killing intent as he stared at him with hatred.

Lin Xiu frowned, ‘I don’t recognize him, but…’

The phoenix flew straight and clashed with the man.

Bang-

He did not dodge and used his own sword to slash at the phoenix!

A solemn ring came out as he slashed down with his sword.

Lin Xiu’s phoenix was sliced in half by the sword move!

The terrifying blaze instantly dissipated in the air. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

‘How is that possible!?’

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted at the sudden change of event.

‘Awe of the Phoenix has become much stronger since I’ve been constantly using it, but he actually sliced it in half!?’

‘What skill did he use to even slice the flames in half!?’

Before Lin Xiu could ponder further, the middle-aged man’s sword unleashed a few cold gleams that flew towards Lin Xiu.

‘So fast!’

The man moved like a black figure and appeared before Lin Xiu. He slashed down at Lin Xiu with his sword.

Although Lin Xiu attempted to dodge the sword strike, he was still struck by it. At this time, the Fire scale combat suit glowed hot red. The sword did not cut through his combat suit but the immense power forced him back a few steps.

He immediately felt the painful and unbearable impact in his chest.

“Fire scale combat suit?”

The middle-aged man looked at the combat suit Lin Xiu had on because his sword had turned red as well. He immediately frowned at the sight of this.

“Who sent you?” Lin Xiu looked at him and questioned.

He had encountered many people and was thinking who would have dispatched this man to take his life.

“Hahaha.” Upon hearing his words, the man started to laugh.

He suddenly retracted the smile on his face the next second and his appearance became sinister, “You’re asking who I am?”

“You killed my people, and you’re asking who I am?”

Lin Xiu frowned, ‘I killed his people?’

“Su Cheng, Zhou Wenhao, do you remember them?” The middle-aged man immediately added after seeing Lin Xiu’s slightly confused face.

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted the instant the names came out, It is the group backing them that’s trying to kill me?

‘Weren’t they killed?’

“I am the group’s chairman, Su Xie. Su Cheng was my son!!!!” The man named Su Xie’s expression turned ugly as he roared. At the same time, he charged at Lin Xiu extremely quickly!

Clang clang clang clang-

Just like before, the man’s sword techniques were sharp, leaving Lin Xiu no choice but to use his spear to block the attacks.

The collision produced numerous clashing sounds.

Sparks continued to flicker in the darkness.

He held Dark Edge Spear tightly and parried the sword attacks, causing Lin Xiu’s hand to turn numb.

Lin Xiu activated Analytic Eye to observe the man before him while parrying the attacks.

When he saw the information, Lin Xiu’s expression became ugly.

The man was actually a rank 7 warrior!!!!

A rank 7 warrior’s strength was extremely powerful.

Lin Xiu already suffered while fighting against Zhou Wenhao and to fight against another rank 7 warrior now, Lin Xiu still felt the pressure.

“Go and die!!!!” Su Xie’s sword released a light aura and stabbed Lin Xiu.

Sou-

Lin Xiu saw a gleam of white as the sword stabbed straight for his head.

In the nick of peril, a pale blue light appeared before Lin Xiu.

Su Xie’s sword was extremely powerful to the point that nothing seemed to be able to withstand its might. At that moment, the sword that was brimming with power was blocked by the pale blue barrier and weakened substantially.

Clang-

Lin Xiu swung Dark Edge Spear out and blocked the attack.

“This is Sphere!?” Su Xie was shocked at the strange thing that appeared.

If not for the appearance of the faint blue barrier, the power produced from the attack could kill Lin Xiu.

Who would have thought that the barrier would block 50% of the attack?

How can a sphere wield such terrifying defensive capability?

“Hmph!” Lin Xiu did not reply.

His rank 5 warrior title’s passive skill had activated with a 30% chance of reducing an incoming attack’s damage by 50%.

Lin Xiu did not feel that it was that powerful, but this thought changed at this moment. The effect was simply blasphemous.

One had to know that this effect was effective to all warriors regardless of rank, as long as it was an attack, it could be blocked!
