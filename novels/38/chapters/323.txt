Chapter 324: Luo Huatian’s Information

“What did you say?” Lin Xiu was startled as though he did not catch her words properly and asked subconsciously.

“It’s nothing.” Luo Yue regained her cold expression and replied indifferently.

Lin Xiu did not find it weird and no longer dwelled on the topic. He changed the subject, “Right, did you manage to absorb all of the ice lotus fire energy?”

Lin Xiu almost died while absorbing the energy of the red lotus fire. If not for the system’s devour ability, he would not have absorbed all of the energy so easily.

But Luo Yue seemed to have done it much more effortlessly as compared to him.

“There’s a bit left.” Luo Yue replied without hesitation.

She extended her hand out while saying so and a white flame in the form of a lotus formed on her right palm.

The flame danced on her hand yet there was no heat, but instead a frigid ice aura could be felt.

This cold caused Lin Xiu to tremble.

“What the hell, this is so cold…” Lin Xiu rubbed his shoulder and replied.

After thinking about it, Lin Xiu extended his hand out and summoned his source strength to his palm, producing the red lotus fire flames on his palm.

The appearance of his flame immediately warmed their surroundings.

Bang-

As the two fires appeared on their palms, the two flames grew large and produced a loud sound to everybody’s surprise.

“Damn it!”

Lin Xiu’s expression changed when he saw the change and cursed as he retracted his source strength.

The red lotus fire disappeared.

Luo Yue also reacted quickly and removed her ice lotus fire.

“That’s really dangerous.” Lin Xiu perspired in cold sweat.

He did not expect that such an occurrence could appear when the two different flames appeared.

Luo Yue’s lips were pale after using the ice lotus fire but quickly regained color.

“What about him?” Luo Yue looked around and asked.

Lin Xiu knew who she was talking about.

“I don’t know, I rested here and after opening my eyes, he was gone.” Lin Xiu shook his head.

Although Luo Huatian was Luo Yue’s elder brother, they were completely unlike each other.

“He is very dangerous, don’t get close to him.” Luo Yue nodded her head and said.

“Zeze, my younger sister, how can you speak ill of your older brother when he isn’t around?”

Just as she said that, a familiar voice came out from the other side.

They turned to see Luo Huatian walking over.

Luo Huatian appeared with a powerful momentum, not like a buff and muscled male but with his long hair, he was charismatic and handsome with a hint of femininity.

He looked at Luo Yue and Lin Xiu and gave a faint smile.

“Shut up!” Luo Yue’s face became even colder when she heard his words. She extended her right hand to the thin sword on her side and summoned it to fly out.

She held onto the sword and aimed it at him, “Come any closer and I’ll kill you.”

“Hey hey, you haven’t changed.” Luo Huatian saw her actions and shook his head helplessly.

“I wanted to go, but I felt that your friend is rather strong.” Luo Huatian looked at Lin Xiu and continued to explain himself.

“Brat, do you have any interest in following me and experience another world?”

Luo Huatian licked his lips while saying that, and his cheeks seemed to flush red with passion.

“If you don’t scram right this instant, I’m going to kill you.” Upon hearing his words, Luo Yue acted like a mother hen protecting her babies and stood in front of Lin Xiu as she screamed at Luo Huatian.

“I say, you have completely forgotten about your brother once you found a boyfriend…”

Luo Huatian waved his hands helplessly.

Luo Yue’s expression became colder as she stabbed forward with her sword!

Sou0

The sound of vacuum exploding occurred as Luo Yue turned into a phantom and shot forward.

At an extremely frightening speed! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Even Lin Xiu could not help but be stunned by her speed.

Her current speed was so fast that Lin Xiu felt that it was inconceivable.

‘Is that the gain in strength after absorbing the ice lotus fire!?’

Clank—

But just as Luo Yue was about to stab Luo Huatian with her thin sword, he moved and wielded a short blade that was used to massacre countless warriors and blocked her sword, producing a loud and sonorous sound.

“Your temper hasn’t changed one bit.” Luo Huatian shook his head.

Luo Yue snorted and retracted her sword before stabbing out again.

Clank clank clank-

But Luo Huatian was too strong and was able to parry her attacks.

Luo Yue’s sharp sword skills were useless against him.

“Alright, I’m not playing with you.” Luo Huatian’s dagger produced a black light that was backed up by a powerful force. Luo Yue felt the impact and retreated a few steps.

“I’m here to tell you that Father is calling you back, it’s time to finish the thing.” Luo Huatian’s eyes finally became serious and he looked over to Lin Xiu while speaking to Luo Yue.

Luo Yue’s figure turned sluggish when she heard his words.

Her expression also changed.

“None of your business.” Luo Yue replied indifferently.

“I’m not trying to, I’m merely here to inform you.” Luo Hua Tian shook his head and continued, “I’ve killed the warriors here, it should be easy for you guys to leave.”

“Alright, goodbye.” WIth that said, he turned and suddenly disappeared from his original spot.
