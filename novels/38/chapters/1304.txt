1305 Who Do You Think You Are?!

The man glared at Baili Haoling with a twisted look on his face.

“You took a hundred million from me, you deserved this.”

Baili Haoling ignored what he said and tightened her grip around her daggers.

The fresh red blood caused both her eyes to turn red.

!!

There was no fear in her eyes but instead, she was ready to fight.

“Let him go!”

Bailing Haoling warned the man who was holding Lei Chong hostage.

“Huh? Did you think that it would be possible?”

The man chuckled instead.

“Oh…where’s the other guy? Isn’t he really god? Didn’t he beat Huangfu Gu? Where is he now?”

The man continued laughing.

Seeing how Baili Haoling didn’t answer him, the man continued laughing, “Even if he was here, I want all four of his limbs as well!”

“Really?”

Suddenly, there was another voice that appeared from behind them.

When the man heard the voice, his pupil shrank uncontrollably.

As he turned around, he could see Lin Xiu standing by the door.

“Well, I was wondering where you two went.”

As Lin Xiu walked towards them, the warriors standing around Baili Haoling stared at him as well.

Lin Xiu looked young and he didn’t seem like someone who was powerful.

However, they had to be cautious.

Those who could step in here were definitely warrior gods.

They felt as if Lin Xiu was just an ordinary man but that would be impossible.

The only explanation for this was that Lin Xiu was so strong that they couldn’t detect anything! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When the man saw Lin Xiu, his body started shaking.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be here!

This was the man who killed Huangfu Gu!

“How did you know that we’re here?”

Baili Haoling was curious.

They knew that Lin Xiu had been in a huge fight and he would have been exhausted. This was why Baili Haoling and Lei Chong did not disturb Lin Xiu.

They came to the training ground instead.

However, they didn’t think that the man from before would come for revenge by bringing so many warriors with him.

Lei Chong was not a warrior god and he wouldn’t be able to fight them.

Baili Haoling may be able to beat them but there were too many of them and she could no longer fight them alone.

“Little Bai brought me here.”

Lin Xiu pointed at Little Bai who was next to him.

Then, he turned towards the man who held a sword against Lei Chong’s neck. He narrowed his eyes and said, “Let him go.”

“Hmph?! Why should I do whatever you say?!”

“Who do you think you are?!”

The man sneered coldly.

He had brought along fifteen warrior gods with him.

No matter how powerful Lin Xiu could be, he wouldn’t have been able to kill so many men.

This was what gave him the courage.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and did not say anything more.

He then pointed at the man with his index finger.

Then, there was a bright light that came shooting out of his finger.

The bright light was headed for the man’s right hand that was holding onto the sword!

When the man saw what happened, his eyes narrowed subconsciously.

He quickly released their ‘sphere’.

However, he was merely a saint warrior. How would he be able to stop the attack of a warrior god?

There was a surge of energy and there was a hole the size of a finger that appeared on his ‘sphere’ that he had released.

Then, it pierced through his arm which was holding onto the sword.

“Ahhhhhh!!!”

The intense pain caused the man to shout at the top of his lungs.

The long sword fell onto the ground as well.

...

“Young master!”

The rest of the warriors turned nervous and quickly stood around the man to protect him.

“Kill him! Kill him now!”

The intense pain coming from his arm had caused the man to turn mad.

With his commands, all of the warriors around rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu glanced at the warriors who were ready to attack him and sneered instead.

When he first walked into the room, he had already activated the Analytic Eye.

Although most of them were already warrior gods, they were much weaker than him.

Most of them have just become warrior gods.

Warriors of these levels were a piece of cake for Lin Xiu.

As all of them rushed toward him, Lin Xiu didn’t even retrieve his Hao Yue Spear. Instead, he lifted his fist and swung it towards them!

...

‘Solar Star’!

As Lin Xiu threw his punch, all of them were hit by Lin Xiu’s fist before the other warriors even had the chance to realise what was happening.

Boom boom boom – –

All of them groaned and it felt as if all the bones in their bodies had been crushed.

They were all thrown to the side!

There were other warriors who were inside the training ground.

All of them were shocked to see what had happened.

Everything happened within the blink of an eye. Lin Xiu was able to defeat all of these warriors gods instantly.

These needed a large amount of energy. How was it possible for him to do this?

“Kill him!!!!”

The man roared in rage after witnessing what had happened.

He was dreading in pain from the injury that came from his arm.

He was already feeling a little blurry.

There was no one holding a sword against Lei Chong’s neck. Lei Chong quickly shifted his body and kicked the man behind him!

Boom – –

The man was then sent flying away and he landed on the wall behind him.

The huge impact caused the man to widen his eyes as blood came splitting out of his mouth.

He was only a saint warrior and his strength was only of the same level as Lei Chong.

With such a hard punch from Lei Chong, it had injured him severely.

“Dieeee!!!!!” One of the warrior gods who was protecting the man turned enraged. He grabbed his weapon and wanted to kill Lei Chong.

The warrior had a quick reaction speed and Lei Chong didn’t have the chance to hide from his attacks.

Clang – –

However, right at that moment, Baili Haoling appeared before him.

The machete from the warrior collided with Baili Haoling’s dagger and there was a loud explosion.

“Well, it’s my turn next.”

Baili Haoling showed a cold smile on her face.

She had been attacked by so many warriors together earlier and she didn’t like how it felt.

Now that Lin Xiu had already gotten rid of a number of them, she no longer felt pressured like before.

“Damn it…”

The look on the warrior’s face changed. Just as he was about to move, the daggers slowly glowed with a blood-red colour!
