1222 There Is Always a Solution to a Problem

“Goodbye.”

Lin Xiu ignored his words and continued to control the Divine mark giant punching his head directly.

Boom ——

With a loud bang, his head was broken!

!!

The whole body also fell directly to the ground at this moment.

“Only one percent of experience …”

At this time, Lin Xiu looked at his experience progress and found that he had just killed so many warriors, including Liu Qinglan and the experience bar only reached one percent.

Too little.

You need to know that Liu Qinglan and Shalin were god warrior-level warriors!

Helplessly shook his head and triggered his thoughtsnand the matrix around him disappeared instantly.

“Lin Xiu!”

At this time, Baili HaoLing flew into the air.

“I’m fine.”

Lin Xiu watched Baili Haoling flying over and smiled immediately.

“he…”

Baili Hao Ling looked around, but found that Liu Qinglan’s figure seemed to disappear.

“Below.”

Lin Xiu’s pointed below.

Baili HaoLing followed Lin Xiu’s gaze and saw that there was a headless body on the ground below.

“Gu!”

And at this time, Rollie ran over Liu Qinglan’s body, opened his mouth and directly devoured Liu Qinglan.

After devouring it, it also patted his body’s body, seemed to be full.

Lin Xiu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry when he saw this scene.

“Hm? Are you injured?”

At this time, Lin Xiu also found that Baili Haoling’s arm had blood flowing down.

“Nothing serious.”

Baili HaoLing shook her head.

At this time, Lin Xiu waved his right hand and one of the water-based glass balls on his neck suddenly emit a dazzling light.

Soon a water droplet-like energy body flew directly toward Baili HaoLing’s wound.

As the water bead touched her wound, her wound soon healed slowly at a speed visible to the naked eye.

“Eh?”

Looking at this scene, Baili HaoLing was surprised.

“Lin Xiu, you actually have this kind of magic?”

“Learned it by chance.”

Lin Xiu laughed.

“Let’s go back.”

The battle was merely a short period of time. When he returned to the city lord’s mansion, Mr. Pang was still in shock and medical staff were carrying those injured away.

“City lord…”

When Mr. Pang saw Lin Xiu came in, he wanted to say something but Lin Xiu waved.

“Don’t carry them away.”

Lin Xiu said to the medical staff over there.

These people were seriously injured and would be very difficult to recover even if they are treated.

At this time, as Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered, a large amount of water droplets instantly condensed in the air, then landed on their bodies.

Bang Bang ——

Their bodies seemed to cover a layer of water film.

Slowly, the injuries on their bodies fixed at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Seeing this scene, those medical staff widened their eyes.

Magic, this is really amazing!

“City lord, they …”

At this time, Mr. Pang came to his senses as he looked at Lin Xiu and seemed a little hesitant.

“They have all been dealt with.”

Lin Xiu seemed to understand what Mr. Pang wanted to ask, at this time, he said lightly.

All were dealt with!?

When Mr. Pang heard Lin Xiu’s words, he was shocked.

So many warriors came and he was no stranger to Liu Qinglan and Sha Lin.

Even they were killed.

“Oh no…”

Mr. Pang was not too happy at this time and frowned.

“What’s wrong?”

Lin Xiu looked at Mr. Pang’s expression, curiously.

“City lord, you must leave Lingxian City quickly.”

Mr. Pang thought for a while, then gritting his teeth and said.

“why.”

Lin Xiu became more curious.

“the City lord of Shachang City, Haiwang City and Changqing City is the noble god.”

“And they seek revenge for the smallest grievance. If they receive the news of Liu Qinglan and the others dead, they will definitely destroy Lingxian City!”

Mr. Pang said with a solemn face.

He is telling the truth. Being in this Lingxian City for so many years, he knew all the superior cities and surrounding cities well.

There were other cities next to Lingxian City, which offended the city lords of these cities and was destroyed by them.

They were completely destroyed and newcomers who came to this God warrior realm wouldn’t even hear that those cities had existed.

“What is the Noble god?”

Lin Xiu was interested.

“The noble god is the existence beyond ordinary god warrior.”

“Generally, the city lord of a large city can reach this state.”

Mr. Pang explained.

“Oh I got it.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly and at this time a little interested.

It turns out that above the god warrior level, there was a noble god level.

“Is the Noble God the strongest?”

“There’s always a solution to a problem, we’ll wait for them to come.”

Lin Xiu smiled at this time and walked directly to his backyard.

“City lord…”

Mr. Pang watched Lin Xiu without any fear, nor did he plan to leave and was immediately stunned.

“Rest assured, they can’t kill us.”

At this time, Baili Haoling glanced at Mr. Pang and said lightly.

Now she has inexplicable confidence in Lin Xiu.

Soon, three days passed.

In the main palace of Changqing City.

boom–

As a loud noise sounded, a huge stone table was directly broken by a white-haired middle-aged man.

Opposite him, there was a row of warriors standing with their heads down and they seemed to be afraid of the middle-aged man. At this time, they dared not move.

“Qing Lan went to the little Lingxian City and lost contact. Now you’re telling me that all of them died?”

At this moment, the white-haired man glanced at everyone and said coldly.

These warriors who did not dare to look at him, at this time, had cold sweat overflowing on their forehead.

“I heard … the people from Shachang City and Haiwang City who went at the same time, also died in Lingxian City.”

One of the men stood out at this time.

“Are you sure that they also went to Lingxian City?”

The middle-aged white-haired man frowned.

Lingxian City is a tiny city. If not for Bai Lingxian, he didn’t know that there was this city at all.

So many warriors went to a small Lingxian City and they actually died!
