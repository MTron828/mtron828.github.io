Chapter 383: Training The Body With Lightning

“About how long?” Lin Xiu looked at him at this time and asked.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Lan Tu was taken aback, then smiled and said, “Now these thunderbirds are full, the next round should be around 12 o’clock in the afternoon. ”

“There won’t be lightning now for sure, so don’t be afraid.” Lan Tu laughed.

He thought that Lin Xiu had just been struck by lightning several times and had developed a fear for these lightning strikes.

“That’s long.” Lin Xiu said a bit regretfully.

If these lightning bolts continue to fall, Lin Xiu can continue to absorb the power of these lightning bolts; it was a pity that he had to stop for such a long time.

“So…long?” Lan Tu originally thought that there would be fear in Lin Xiu’s eyes, but what he didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu revealed a look of pity.

“Ha, you will know the horror at night.” Lan Tu thought that Lin Xiu was just showing off and sneered.

Lin Xiu ignored his words and continued to practice the ‘Cultivation Technique’, continuing to absorb the lightning energy that was still in his body.

The warriors around were now starting to cultivate as well. After all, this lightning will continue to come in the afternoon. If you don’t have enough energy, you will die if you don’t dodge in time!

After more than an hour passed, Lin Xiu slowly stood up. He moved his body and there were crackling sounds like beans getting fried.

Lan Tu was sitting on the ground cross-legged, but when he saw Lin Xiu stand up, he was taken aback

Because Lin Xiu was severely injured just now and he should still be resting at this moment but to Lan Tu’s surprise, Lin Xiu was already standing up!

And judging by how Lin Xiu looked, he seemed fine.

“Are you all right?” Lan Tu couldn’t help but ask at this time.

“Kind of.” Lin Xiu nodded, then said faintly.

At the next moment, he shook his body, and instantly the burnt black skin on his body began to fall to the ground.

As the scorched skin fell off, Lin Xiu’s skin has become extremely white and tender now like a hardboiled egg without the shell.

Lan Tu was completely dumbfounded at this time, it was the first time he saw such a weird scene.

Bang bang bang——

Lin Xiu loosened his muscles, then punched in the air with his fists, giving off explosions sounds.

It seemed that he was indeed a lot stronger!

Seems like by using the ‘Engulf’ skill, part of the lightning energy was absorbed into experience, while the remaining lightning energy could be used to train his body.

This kid… who is he?

Lan Tu’s eyes widened as he saw Lin Xiu waving his fists wildly as if he was practicing some kind of boxing.

But soon, he came to his senses and hurriedly continued the practice of ‘Cultivation Technique’ with his legs crossed, because if he didn’t absorb the source strength well and store it in his body, he would be dead when the lightning comes again!

The power of his fist became stronger…

Would his ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’ become stronger then?

With this thought, Lin Xiu took a deep breath and clenched his fists. In a short time, a lot of lightning appeared on Lin Xiu’s fist.

Crackling——

With the crackling sound, Lin Xiu’s fists already had a large amount of lightning gathered around it and the lightning was light blue. Also, the surrounding air seemed to be scorched by lightning.

“Slightly stronger, but not enough.” Lin Xiu said a bit regretfully.

After some time, those Thunderbirds who had been quiet before started flying in the sky again.

Li li——

There were loud cries once again.

At the same time, everyone who was sitting on the ground and cultivating quickly opened their eyes. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They knew that a new round of lightning storms has begun again!

Boom boom——

Just like this morning, these thunderbirds started to attract thunder again!

“This kid has been practicing boxing just now?” When Lan Tu opened his eyes, he found that Lin Xiu had already stood up, his eyes were looking in the sky.

He felt that Lin Xiu was just feigning dumb but now he was starting to really pay attention to Lin Xiu.

This guy was not an easy man!

“Coming!”

As a warrior roared out, a flash of huge lightning fell from the sky!

These people were prepared for the first lightning and were not hit by it.

But what surprised them was that at this moment, Lin Xiu rushed towards it!

Boom——

That thick bolt of lightning struck Lin Xiu’s body directly!

“Damn!” A man’s eyes widened when he saw this scene. They almost couldn’t dodge the lightning yet Lin Xiu actually charged into it!

“Did his brain get an electric shock or something?” Another warrior was also looking at Lin Xiu.

But they didn’t expect that as the lightning dissipated, Lin Xiu, who was standing there, did not fall, but was still standing.

But because his hair was upright due to the current of the lightning, he looked a little funny.

“Here again!” But before they had time to look at Lin Xiu, there were rumbling noises in the sky again.

One after another terrifying lightning bolts began falling from the sky!

The lightning bolts became very dense and the warriors had to dodge constantly, but Lin Xiu still stood at the same spot, letting a large amount of lightning hit his body directly!

“Damn it!” Lan Tu watched a bolt of lightning fall from the sky again. He couldn’t dodge so he unfolded the protective cover and blocked the lightning strike.

But the power of the lightning seemed to be a bit too great and the “Sphere” he unfolded was a bit unstable.

“Phew.” With great difficulty, he blocked the lightning bolt. As soon as heaved a sigh of relief, he saw Lin Xiu still standing there, letting the lightning strike his body.

And at this time, Lan Tu saw that there was no sign of pain on Lin Xiu’s face and he even looked like he was… excited?

“Is this kid a pervert?”
