Chapter 752: Strange Person

“Ah!!!”

A wailing scream came.

Taking a closer look, there seems to be a warrior surrounded by those flames.

At this moment, he shook his body frantically, as if he wanted to put out the flames on his body.

But because Lin Xiu absorbed the fire of the red lotus, the flames released now are far more terrifying than ordinary flames.

Lin Xiu, whose eyes were very sharp, clearly saw the special bow and arrow in the hands of this warrior.

You didn’t have to think about it to be sure that it was this guy who shot the arrow just now.

“Humph!”

But except for this one warrior who was surrounded by flames, the other warriors didn’t seem to suffer any damage and jumped over directly to a place not far from Lin Xiu and the others.

Taking a closer look, there were several men in black cloaks.

/

They had some weird prints on their face which seemed very strange.

Who are they?

“Who are these people?”

Looking at these strange people, the expressions in their eyes seemed to be like beasts.

It seemed like they were going to be torn apart.

“Don’t know.”

Liu Pan shook his head and said.

But he also had a stern look on his face. The murderous aura of these people was too obvious and they wanted to kill them.

“Hunter...!?”

Xiao Qiang and Zhao Kai seemed to know something and their expressions changed drastically.

Hunter?

Lin Xiu frowned. After he came to Marqi Planet, he had never heard of this.

However, with the use of the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu clearly kenw that these people were all warriors of peak rank 9.

“Kneel down, I can leave you guys with a whole corpse.”

One of the men stared at Lin Xiu and the others and said coldly.

“Humph!”

An Qi has been accumulating energy for a long time since just now. At this time, she snorted coldly and the giant sword in both hands burst out with a lot of light.

It seemed to be full of energy.

As she snorted coldly, the giant sword she was holding swung directly into the air and a terrifying light of energy burst out, charging towards the strange men in black cloaks over there.

Boom—

As the energy blasted away, there was a huge sound in an instant.

However, these people reacted very quickly and even dodged at an important juncture.

The area hit by these terrifying energies instantly made a loud noise.

“Huhu.”

An Qi was panting, her eyes were full of dissatisfaction.

She never imagined that her skills would not be effective at all.

“Accumulated strength for too long and speed is too slow.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

As for Xiao Qiang and Zhao Kai, their bodies were already trembling, “You kill their people and you are all dead.”

While they were talking, they ran to the back without looking back, wanting to leave. “What are you two doing!”

Seeing this scene, Liu Pan couldn’t help shouting loudly.

Even the two girls were not afraid. He had no idea why they were so afraid.

They just ran away like that.

Not only Liu Pan, but also An Qi and Qian Lin felt puzzled.

The warriors who could come here were all warriors who dare to risk their own lives to fight. How could they be scared away without even fighting?

At the same time, those people just now rushed over.

Their speed was very fast and the weapons in their hands were also very strange.

It turned out to be a weird weapon with two hooks.

Two of the men in black cloaks instantly appeared in front of and behind Lin Xiu and attacked Lin Xiu’s neck directly.

They wanted to cut Lin Xiu’s throat directly.

Boom–

But the moment they waved their weapons, Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared immediately.

The expressions in the two people’s eyes changed greatly.

Boom–

When one of them was about to turn around and look behind him, a long spear pierced his neck.

His eyes widened as if he didn’t know how he died.

The other man’s eyes were full of shock.

He never imagined that Lin Xiu would have such power.

But he didn’t run away and his expression became even more sinister as he held the weapon in his hand and attacked Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu sneered, an attack of this level seemed like a joke to him.

And since he was promoted to the master warrior level, the power in his body has been greatly improved.

Looking at the man’s attacking movement, it just felt very slow, so slow that he could easily resist it.

But at this moment, when Lin Xiu wanted to do something, he saw a strange light flashing in the man’s pupils.

And Lin Xiu’s body, at this moment, couldn’t move!

Feeling all this, Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted.

“Hehe...”

The man laughed horribly and the weapon in his hand slashed directly at Lin Xiu’s neck.

Boom–

With a dull sound, his strange curved weapon merely... scratched Lin Xiu’s skin.

That’s right, it’s just a little bit of skin.

This man’s face, who was originally sinister, changed greatly at this time.

An unbelievable look filled his heart.

“Although I’m curious about what kind of ability you have, I guess you won’t say anything.”

Lin Xiu said indifferently, in the next moment, the spear in his hand stabbed and pierced the man’s head!

“Go to hell then.”

After killing him, Lin Xiu touched the wound on his neck and frowned slightly.

Lin Xiu’s physical strength was already very terrifying because of the relationship between cultivating the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ and having experienced body refining through molten lava.

Not to mention that the surface of the body was covered with source strength.

It could be said that this man’s attack can’t break his defense at all.

And after a while, the damaged skin on Lin Xiu’s neck began to slowly heal.

Dang dang-

At this time, Liu Pan and others also fell into a tough battle.

Especially Qian Lin and An Qi, who were obviously weaker than Liu Pan. At this time, the clothes on their bodies were all torn and there were many scars on their arms and blood was slowly flowing out.

“Turns out to be you guys...” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Liu Pan also seemed to know something at this time and the double-sided axe in both hands waved wildly.

His eyes turned red and the strength of the whole person seemed to become stronger.

And in this state, he didn’t care about his physical condition at all and frantically attacked the man in the black cloak.

“Go to hell! Die! Die!”

Liu Pan roared furiously and the double-sided axe in both hands slashed even more frantically.

There were also many wounds on his body and the flow of blood seemed to stimulate him even more, making him even crazier!
