Chapter 1479-END - 1479 Hope Everyone Finds Happiness! (The final )

At this time, Bai Litao was standing at the highest point of the Sacred Region Academy in Sky City. Looking at this scene, his eyes were full of shock.

It’s Lin Xiu. Are you back?

At this moment, Bai Litao looked at his hands. At that moment just now, he clearly felt that he had died once.

It’s a weird feeling…

“Phew, everything is over.”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself at this time.

At this time, the light on his body began to slowly disappear.

After coming to this world, he has been fighting for so long, and he seems to be really tired.

Luo Yue seemed to feel something at this time, and immediately said to Pang Tong who was beside her, “Send me back to Earth.”

Pang Tong was startled, then nodded.

In the next moment, Luo Yue’s figure quickly disappeared.

At this time, the light covering Lin Xiu’s body has completely disappeared.

Lin Xiu also felt that he suddenly felt very sleepy.

Slowly closed his eyes.

The body seemed to start to fall downwards.

But at this moment, Luo Yue quickly hugged Lin Xiu.

“A bit tired.”

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue’s cheek that appeared in front of him, and said with a smile.

“Take a nap.”

Luo Yue’s voice also became gentler.

“En.”

Looking at Luo Yue’s cheek, Lin Xiu seemed to feel that time had returned to the time when he first met.

“Luo Yue.”ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Hm?”

“Let’s get married.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

At this moment, Luo Yue’s cheeks were stained with a layer of crimson.

“Um…”

January 1st.

God Warrior Realm, Lingxian City!

At this time, the entire Lingxian City was decorated with lanterns, festoons, and beams of joy.

Everywhere was full of joy.

In front of the Lord’s Mansion, there were numerous long tables adorned with various rare and exotic ingredients.

Even the water to drink was the Water of Life.

“In the blink of an eye, who knows how many years have passed.”

“Lin Xiu and Luo Yue have finally achieved a happy ending.”

At this moment, Bai Litao said with a smile.

“Hahaha, let me tell you, back then, I fought with a true god!”

At this time, Ouyang Hang was drinking with the Sacred Regino Academy people and laughed.

These drinks were all quite potent.

Ouyang Hang became a little dizzy after drinking.

“The day has finally come.”

An Qi and Qian Lin were very excited at this moment.

“Hahaha, brother Lin got married, when are you guys going to get married?”

Liu Pan looked at them.

“Why don’t you guys consider me…”

“Get lost!”

The two immediately glared at him.

Wang Qiang and the others from Planet Namir also had great joy on their faces at this time.

God Warrior Realm!

“Master is really amazing…”

Wang Qiang couldn’t help sighing.

At this time, Mr. Ye was also drinking wine, his face turned red.

He no longer needs to be the guardian anymore.

With Lin Xiu around, no one would dare to casually go to the planet Namir to wreak havoc.

Lei Tong and Mr. Pang, on the other side, kept helping Lin Xiu to collect gifts from those who came to the wedding.

There were so many presents, they piled up into a mountain!

“Rollie, this is…!?”

On the other side, when Baili Haoling was busy preparing various things for Lin Xiu, she saw the figure of Rollie.

At this time, behind Rollie, there was a large group of creatures that looked exactly like Rollie, like a big snowball.

“I… members of the clan!”

Rollie said in a childish voice.

“Have you found your clansmen?”

At this time, Baili Haoling also showed surprise in his eyes.

At this time, Rollie led its clansmen and jumped to the other side.

“We witnessed the birth of a god king.”

The leaders of the Nine Continents, God King Tianling and other god kings were all drinking at the same table at this time.

This wine was made of rare life liquid, so they couldn’t help but drink a few more glasses.

At this moment, huge phoenix cries and dragon whistles suddenly came from the other side.

“coming!”

At this moment, everyone looked ahead and could clearly see Lin Xiu, who was riding on a massive divine dragon.

He was dressed in a red dragon wedding gown, looking resplendent.

Beside him was Luo Yue, adorned in a phoenix crown and a red veil covering her head, just like a phoenix in all her glory.

Thousands of pairs of eyes all looked into the sky.

“Cuckoo -”

At this time, Rollie and its clansmen suddenly burst out with a lot of strange energy, which made the surrounding space look like a dream!

Xiaobai flew over behind him with a large number of ice-crystal white birds.

The ice crystals on their bodies turned bright red at this instant.

A red bridge was built, extending directly to the ground below.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue descended from the dragon and phoenix, holding hands as they walked towards a translucent hall where energy was constantly shifting.

This was the grand hall.

Luo Zhen and his wife were already seated at the central position in the hall.

“On a good day and auspicious day, the flowers are perfect and the moon is full.”

“Welcome, all guests, to participate in the wedding of Mr. Lin and Ms. Luo!”

A man had already walked over at this time, looked around, looked at the endless tables of banquets, and said suddenly.

He didn’t use any loudspeaker, but the sound was clearly transmitted to the minds of everyone around him.

Clap clap——

Suddenly there was thunderous applause!

“Now let us welcome the bride and groom!”

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue had already walked down hand in hand at this time.

Following the traditional customs, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue performed the three bows and nine kowtows.

Looking at this scene, Luo Zhen and his wife grinned from ear to ear.

It’s not easy, it’s been so many years.

As the wedding ceremony proceeded with its intricate rituals, the day eventually turned into evening.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue sat on the wedding bed, feeling a mixture of excitement and nervousness.

Lin Xiu’s heart pounded rapidly in his chest, creating a sense of anticipation and thrill for what was to come.

Taking a deep breath, he stretched out his hand and began to slowly uncover the red veil.

That cheek with a slightly powdered, moon-like face suddenly appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

Luo Yue also seemed a little nervous and shy at this time, her face was flushed.

“Yue’er, from today onwards, we will be together forever.”

Lin Xiu gently wrapped his arms around Luo Yue’s waist and laid her on the bed, gazing at her exquisite beauty and red lips. He pulled the red phoenix and dragon curtains, and the room plunged into darkness as the lights went off.

…

This morning, Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue who was sleeping soundly in his arms, kissed her lightly on the forehead, then carefully pulled out his hand, began to get dressed and went out.

Standing in this hall standing tall in Lingxian City, one can clearly see the scene in the distance.

“Cloud-like hair, flower-like countenance, graceful steps as if treading on gold, warm spring night behind the lotus curtain.

Short is the spring night, but the sun rises high, from now on the king shall not rise early for court.”

“Tsk tsk, Lin Xiu, you are living a comfortable life now.”

At this moment, a voice came from the other side.

Looking up, it was Baili Haoling’s figure.

“you shut up.”

Lin Xiu said a little angrily.

“Even after becoming a true god, you still can’t keep yourself composed.”

Baili Haoling said proudly.

At this moment, several figures also walked over.

Taking a closer look, the man was the same emcee who had officiated the wedding ceremony. Behind him stood four beautiful women.

One looks a little cute, and the other is a woman who looks very similar to Baili Haoling, with two long knives hanging from her waist.

Behind was a woman riding a dolphin creature and a woman who looks very innocent.

Lin Xiu recognized the man and one of the women.

Ancestors of the Baili family!

“congratulations.”

The man smiled at this moment.

“I forgot to introduce myself. My name is Li Rui, and they are my wives.”

The man spoke to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu smiled.

He could clearly feel that this man who called himself Li Rui was also very powerful.

“You guys wait here for me first, I have something to say to Brother Lin.”

“You guys aren’t going to do bad things together, are you?”

The woman holding the double knives said suspiciously at this moment.

“Of course not.”

Li Rui said helplessly.

The two walked to the other side.

“Are you also a true god?” Lin Xiu subconsciously asked.

“Well… you can say that,” the man replied.

“The universe is vast, and our realm is just a small corner of it.”

“Beyond the Ninth Heaven, there are other worlds with powerful beings.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly as he heard his words.

At that time…

“You’re wondering why I didn’t intervene back then, right?” Li Rui looked at Lin Xiu and smiled lightly.

“If you couldn’t handle it, I would have stepped in. But I thought, with your strength, you should be able to handle it, after all, you’ve obtained the inheritance of the true gods in this universe.”

“I see,” Lin Xiu nodded in understanding.
“I’m about to leave this place. In the future, this universe will still depend on you to protect it.”

Li Rui smiled at this moment.

“Beyond the Nine Heavens?” Lin Xiu asked.

“Yes, I hope that one day we will meet beyond the Nine Heavens,” he smiled faintly.

Beyond the Nine Heavens…

Lin Xiu was a little curious, but now, he doesn’t want to go to other places.

“Anyway, it’s still a long time. In the future, there will be a chance.”

No one knows what it would be like there.

“correct.”

“It’s really good to marry a wife…”

Li Rui secretly gave Lin Xiu a thumbs up.

“Stupid Li Rui! Come back to me quickly!”

At this time, there was a voice from the other side.

“I’m coming!”

At this time, he hurried over.

Seems like… a strict wife?

Lin Xiu shook his head and smiled.

At this moment, a figure came over from behind.

“Got up so early?”

As soon as Lin Xiu turned around, he saw Luo Yue’s figure.

“En.”

Luo Yue showed a smile.

“Let’s travel all over the world.”

Lin Xiu held Luo Yue’s hand.

“As long as you are there, I will be there.”

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and smiled.

Lin Xiu put his left arm around Luo Yue, and with a wave of his right hand, the entire sky burst into bright brilliance.

At this moment, the entire God Warrior Realm seemed to be raining roses.

“I hope everyone finds happiness!”

Lin Xiu shouted out loud.
