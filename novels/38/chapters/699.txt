Chapter 700 Lin Xiu Has Gone Mad.

Wu Changkong widened his eyes in shock when he saw what was happening. Lin Xiu’s attack was incredible and horrifying.

With the spear being loaded with energy, it was so strong that it caused his heart to race. Damn it!

He wanted to block the attack subconsciously but he had a feeling that he wouldn’t be able to do it.

As for Lin Xiu, he was now filled with a murderous aura and he wanted to pierce the black sppear through Wu Changkong’s body!

Xiu- –

Right at that moment, there was a bright ray of light that appeared from the audience seat.

It was headed towards Lin Xiu who was releasing his ‘Knowing Attack’ with his spear.

However, it was as if Lin Xiu had seen something coming when he turned around.

The bright ray of light was travelling at a quick speed and instantly headed towards Lin Xiu’s body!

With a soft groan, Lin Xiu, who was aiming his spear at Wu Changkong, was hit by the ray of light.

Then, he ended up on the ground.

“Sh*t…”

Lin Xiu spat out a mouthful of blood as he looked at the audience.

After taking a good look, he soon found the elder along with the young man seated next to him.

Both of them were looking at Lin Xiu and they had a mocking look in their eyes.

Lin Xiu realised that they were the ones who did it!

Wu Changkong was stunned for a moment before realising that this was his chance. That’s when a twisted smile appeared on his face.

He picked up his huge sword and was about to attack Lin Xiu!

“What happened?”

Lei Chong and the rest of them were shocked. They saw Lin Xiu loading his spear with energy and headed towards Wu Changkong.

But, why did he suddenly fall onto the ground?!

“Kill him!”

“Kill him!”

Then, Wu Changkong was running towards Lin Xiu with his huge sword above his head and the rest of the crowd were cheering for him.

“You’re dead!”

Wu Changkong keld onto his sword as he arrived by Lin Xiu’s side and his sword was now shining with a bright light.

He had activated all of the remaining source energy that he had left in his body.

He wanted Lin Xiu dead with only one attack!

As for Lin Xiu, his time was almost up.

He clenched onto his jaw and he was furious.

This was the first time that he had been played dirty by others and Lin Xiu was mad.

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu immediately activated ‘Reset and allowed all of his skills to restart.

He could once again activate ‘Rage’!

The energy in his body had once again returned to its peak!

Koong Loong – –

When Wu Changkong’s sword landed on Lin Xiu’s body, there was a loud explosion.

The entire stage shook as well. However, Wu Changkong could clearly feel that he did not hit Lin Xiu.

He quickly turned around and saw Lin Xiu right behind him.

An eye-binding ray appeared and Wu Changkong quickly blocked it with his huge sword.

Boom – –

His sword shook from the impact and Wu Changkong had to take a few steps back because of it.

Lin Xiu had activated ‘Mirror Image’ which made it easy for him to dodge the attack.

Lin Xiu only wanted one thing now.

Since everyone else wanted him dead, he shall kill them first!

As the spear in his arms was filled with energy once again, it was shining brighter than the first time.

Clang clang clang – – As Lin Xiu was swinging his spear around, Wu Changkong could only block Lin Xiu’s attack with his huge sword as he had already exhausted most of the energy in his body. What the hell? How is this possible? Why is this fella still so strong?!

“En? What’s happening?”

The elder on the audience seat noticed that something was different with Lin Xiu and he was shocked as well.

He realised that Lin Xiu’s energy had returned to its original state.

As for Wu Changkong, it was obvious that he had consumed most of it and was becoming weaker.

If this goes on, Wu Changkong would definitely lose this match

The elder narrowed his eyes as he gently moved his right hand. All of his energy was gathered in his finger. He gently clasped them together and compressed all of his energy into a tiny speck of light.

As he gently flicked it, the light zoomed towards Lin Xiu immediately!

Xiu – –

As the light was about to hit Lin Xiu, he suddenly turned around and blocked the light with his black spear.

“Get lost!”

Lin Xiu shouted. With the movement of the black spear, the speck of light immediately headed back towards the elder who was on the audience seat.

Lin Xiu didn’t catch him earlier which was why it worked but this time, Lin Xiu wouldn’t repeat the same mistake twice.

The elder’s eyes widened when he saw the tiny speck of light that was formed by his own energy headed back towards himself. As it was getting closer, he immediately released his ‘Yuan’.

Boom–

Even when he had already activated ‘Yuan’, the impact was still too strong that he was badly injured.

There was a dull pain in his chest as he spat out blood from his mouth.

“Master!”

The young man seated next to him was shocked when he saw the old man’s mouth that was now filled with blood.

“Damn it…” The elder waved his eyes as his eyes were still on Lin Xiu who was on the stage. He was surprised.

This young boy’s strength is so powerful. Lin Xiu didn’t bother dealing with those on the audience seat. He tightened his grip around the Dark Edge and continued attacking Wu Changkong! Lin Xiu was now filled with rage and his attacks were getting stronger. His spear was like a snake in a cave, each attack was more vicious than the other.

Wu Changkong tried to fight it but all he could do was protect himself behind his huge sword.

He was the number 1 on the Honour Rank, representing the strongest amongst those in Tianlong City. How could he lose to an earthling?!

“AHHHHHHHHH!”

Wu Changkong suddenly roared and the mark on his forehead lit up once again.

Huh?

Lin Xiu frowned as he could feel that something wasn’t right.

Just when Lin Xiu continued his attack, there was a huge mark that appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

Koong Loong – – Lin Xiu tried to attack once again but the tip of his spear landed on the mark that suddenly appeared!

The mark instantly blocked Lin Xiu’s attack and it was giving up a bright light as well! Crack Crack – –

A peculiar sound was coming from the mark as it cracked open, flushing out a large amount of current!

The current was thick and strong as it completely enveloped around Lin Xiu’s body!

It was as if the current wanted to end Lin Xiu!

This was something that only belonged to a master warrior!
