“What’s wrong?”

Lin Xiu had started cultivating and was absorbing the energy around them when he noticed something was wrong with Luo Yue.

“Nothing…”

Luo Yue quickly shook her head.

However, it was obvious that her face had turned white.

It looked like it may be due to the environment here.

When he took a closer look, her arm was then turning black.

Dark energy! Could it be because of the dark energy?

“No! We have to leave here right now.”

Lin Xiu frowned.

His body has already engulfed the dark energy which was why he had no trouble being on the Dark Planet.

However, it was different for Luo Yue. It was obvious that her body was rejecting the energy here.

The reaction was a pretty strong one.

“No…..we can’t.”

Luo Yue shook her head.

There must be one God King amongst them that specialises in the space element.

If they head back now, they would be discovered.

“But…”

Lin Xiu wanted to say something when he saw the necklace on his neck.

Right!

Lin Xiu then removed it from his neck and hung it over Luo Yue’s neck.

“Try it. Try to activate the dark energy from inside the necklace.”

Luo Yue looked at the necklace on her neck and she was a little caught off guard.

“But you…”

“I don’t need it. Keep it.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

He didn’t need this now.

Luo Yue didn’t waste any time as well. She focused on the energy stone and managed to activate the dark energy stone.

Then, the energy from inside got released and surrounded Luo Yue’s body.

Soon, the black marks on her arms finally disappeared.

“Huuuu~”

Lin Xiu finally felt relieved.

This was as expected.

The dark energy on this planet was the reason why those who did not cultivate the dark energy could not survive.

“Let’s try to recover some energy first.”

Seeing how Luo Yue’s complexion had improved, Lin Xiu finally smiled.

“En.”

Luo Yue nodded her head as well.

Both of them sat cross legged on the ground and used their ‘cultivation technique’.

Then, they started absorbing the energy around them.

Due to how the energy in the air was filled with impurities, it was difficult for them to actually absorb them.

Lin Xiu only came back to his senses after a long time.

Luo Yue opened her eyes as well.

However, other than the flames that he had released, there was nothing else that had light.

The entire planet was still pitch black.

“Is this what the Dark Planet is?”

Lin Xiu looked around as he exclaimed in surprised.

“It shouldn’t be.”

Luo Yue frowned as well.

If this was the case, her brother wouldn’t have survived under such an environment.

“Let’s take a look over there.”

Lin Xiu pointed to an area in front of them.

With his flames lighting up the area around them, Lin Xiu soon noticed that there was a fight that happened here earlier.

It was as if there was a horrible war.

Their surroundings have been completely ruined.

“It looks like there is a city over there.”

Luo Yue looked over and noticed that there were lights in the distance.

They were dim and looked like they came from a place far away.

“Told you that it would be impossible for the entire plane to be pitch black.”

“Let’s go!”

Lin Xiu held Luo Yue’s hand as they walked towards the light.

Luo Yue walked next to him and as she saw his head full of white hair, she felt heartbroken.

It was a no-brainer that Lin Xiu must have used his vitality during the fight earlier.

Both of them continued walking for some time before they arrived at a city that was brightly lit.

However, this place looked like it had been destroyed as well.

There was debris everywhere.

The city gates were wide open.

There seemed to be no one guarding the city.

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment before entering the city with Luo Yue.

As they walked inside, they soon noticed that they were other warriors inside the city.

All of them looked the same as those from the Warrior God Realm.

They looked worried and dull.

“Look! Let’s go over there.”

It was a bar.

This place was like a hidden bar but there were lots of warriors walking toward it.

They would definitely be able to get some news here.

Something must have happened to this planet.

Lin Xiu wanted to know more about it as well.

The bar was dark and soft, mellow music was playing inside.

Groups of warriors gathered around a small table as if they were discussing something.

The vibe inside the bar did not seem as dull as it was outside.

Lin Xiu ordered two cups of beer and found a place to sit with Luo Yue.

Boom – –

Then, there was a muscular man that heavily placed his cup on the table.

“Those from the Warrior God Realm deserve to die!!!”

He looked pissed.

“They’ve just destroyed our planet!”

The rest of the warriors were angry as well. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“How on earth did those people get on our planet?”

“F*ck!”

“They even sealed our planet! We can’t even leave this place!”

They gulped down their beer while discussing it.

“Waiter.”

When one of the service crew walked past him, Lin Xiu stopped him.

“Hello, is there anything that I can help you with?”

The waiter was polite and kind.

“I just wanted to know what happened to our planet recently.”

Lin Xiu directly went straight to the point.

“We just came out of cultivation.”

The waiter was stunned at first but he still took out a computer and passed it over to Lin Xiu.

“Thank you.”

Lin Xiu took it from the waiter.

Then, he started going through the news.

It seems like something big has happened over the past few weeks.

Luo Yue and Lin Xiu looked at each other and started reading through the news.

Lin Xiu then discovered that even though the Dark Planet did not revolve around the sun…

There were still 12 hours every day where they had natural light.

These energies were enough to sustain everything that they needed.

However…
