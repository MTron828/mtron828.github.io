Chapter 856: Past, Present, He Is Still the Strongest!

“En. I’m back.”

Lin Xiu smiled at Ouyang Hang.

“You brat! You said you would be back within a year. Look how long it has been!”

Baili Haoling glared at Lin Xiu before breaking into a laugh.

“It’s good that you’re back.”

Baili Tao gently stroked his beard and smiled.

“Yo! You useless beings from the Sacred Region Academy. Get up here now!”

One of the students from the Sky Academy was standing on stage as he looked at Baili Haoling.

“Get anyone to come from your school. No matter the number.”

With that, the audience went wild once again.

Even the judges were not stopping him.

From the fight from earlier, the result of the match was obvious. If anyone from the Sacred Region Academy got on stage, they would definitely end up dead.

“You’re saying that anyone is allowed on stage?”

Lin Xiu turned around and looked at the man standing on stage with his eyes narrowed.

“Yes. Any of you. No matter who. Just get on stage.”

The man had a devilish smile on his face.

For them, even if they had to fight the entire academy, the ending would still be the same.

Their abilities were enough to suppress all the warriors on earth.

“I’ll do it alone then.”

Lin Xiu said calmly before getting onto the stage.

“Is that alright?”

Lin Xiu asked the judges.

“If the other party has got no opinion on it, sure.”

The judges said without any emotions.

However, there was a mocking look hidden in his eyes.

Those from the Sacred Region Academy will definitely die.

Getting on stage was a ticket to hell.

“Tsktsk….only one? That wouldn’t be enough.”

They were looking at Lin Xiu who was dressed in white with a long, black spear behind him.”

“Number 4. Get on stage and shave him up nicely until he becomes a stick. Don’t kill him directly.”

One of them gave orders to his teammate.

“Sure.”

The man known as ‘number 4’ nodded his head.

At that moment, he quickly moved his body and instantly, his body disappeared!

The audience had their eyes locked onto the fight that was happening on stage.

Baili Haoling and the rest of them held their breath as well.

They had no idea what Lin Xiu’s strength was when he returned this time.

Those from the other party had shown extraordinary abilities and it was terrifyingly strong.

It was just a question if Lin Xiu would be able to handle it.

A bright white light flashed across Lin Xiu’s eyes.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu moved his right hand. It was moving at a speed that could not be seen with the naked eyes.

Then, the other man’s body was suddenly pushed to a far distance.

Koong Loong – –

The man’s body landed on the ground further away from them and there was a huge crater formed on the ground.

He was already smashed into a meat paste and it looked incredibly horrifying.

Pin drop silence filled the whole place.

Not only the audience, even Baili Haoling and the rest of them looked at Lin Xiu with their eyes widened.

Lin Xiu was able to kill the warrior, who had strength that was horrifying, in a blink of an eye and with only one hand!

How strong does he have to be in order to do this?

“All of you come at once.”

Lin Xiu looked at the other three from the other party and said calmly.

The rest of them looked shocked.

“You’re not from earth?!”

One of them said subconsciously.

This was because Lin Xiu’s abilities as seen were so much more powerful than theirs.

They were surprised to see such skills.

“I’m from earth.”

Lin Xiu smiled flatly.

The three of them looked at each other and decided to use the power from their source mark.

Each of them had a bright light shining from their forehead.

Koong Loong – –

There were huge balls of fire and terrifying lightning headed towards Lin Xiu. Plus, there were also huge rocks blasting towards Lin Xiu.

“Strength from their warrior skills?!”

When he saw what happened, Ouyang Hang was shocked.

They were incredibly strong.

“No. It’s from their source mark.”

Baili Haoling looked at the fight that was happening on stage.

Although Lin Xiu’s abilities a while ago had surprised her, she was still feeling worried for Lin Xiu when she saw the skills from the other party.

“Hmmm? That’s all?”

As the skills from their source mark slowly disappeared, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared on stage.

He was unharmed.

Even his clothes seemed fine and there wasn’t even a single scratch on it.

“What…..who are you?!”

All three of them looked surprised.

The power from their source mark didn’t harm Lin Xiu at all. This showed that Lin Xiu was definitely someone much stronger than them.

“Let’s go!”

They had no other choice but to leave.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

Then, there was a black source mark that appeared on Lin Xiu’s forehead.

As when the three of them wanted to teleport, they were trapped inside an array.

They tried to move their body but no matter how they struggled, they still couldn’t leave the array.

“What…..what is this?!”

Everyone around was shocked as well.

This definitely wasn’t the strength that an ordinary warrior should have!

“This brat...”

At the same time, those watching from the committee seat were surprised as well.

“Lin Xiu! That is Lin Xiu from the Sacred Region Academy! The one who was wanted a year ago!”

Some of them could recognise Lin Xiu and shouted to the rest of the crowd.

It has already been a year since it happened. Although it was a huge matter previously, most of them have already forgotten about it.

But, some of them managed to look back at the recording from a year ago and realised that he was Lin Xiu!”

“Don’t you dare!!”

Then, a huge rumbling sound appeared from the sky.

The sky was also filled with dark clouds.

“Oh? It’s you.” CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Lin Xiu looked up and narrowed his eyes.

That man was the one who gathered all the warriors in order to kill him. He was Nan Huang’s grandfather, Nan Jing.

Lin Xiu didn’t expect Nan Haung to be a warrior master by now and he even had levitation skills.

The audience were shocked as well to see Nan Jing who was in the air.

“Nan Jing! According to his records, he has already broken through rank 9. I didn’t know that he had levitation skills now.”

The audience turned wild.

“You brat! I didn’t get to kill you back then but how dare you return here!”

Nan Jing screamed in rage as he glared at Lin Xiu.

With that loud scream, everyone around felt a headache coming.

There were also cracks all over the glass windows around them.

But, Lin Xiu was not at all affected by it.

“You? You’re too weak.”

Lin Xiu looked at Nan Jing and said bluntly.

Ouyang Hang stared at Lin Xiu from the back and he was stunned.

It seemed like he would never be able to catch up to Lin Xiu.

In the past and even now, Lin Xiu has always been so strong!
