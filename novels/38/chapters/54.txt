Chapter 55: Powerful Android

Xu Wen and the others returned to see Lin Xiu fixing the pile of parts up.

“Don’t disturb him.” Li Yi was about to ask Lin Xiu what he was doing, Xu Wen pulled him back.

Li Yi nodded his head but fixed his gaze on Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was immersed in putting things together and did not care about anything else.

Time passed very quickly. A type of android could be seen.

“This is… a mecha?” Li Yi’s eyes were wide opened.

His face was overwhelmed with shock.

“No, I don’t think so.” Xu Wen shook his head. Although he felt that it was similar to a mecha, he felt that it was an android instead.

There were gears on the android that made it feel extremely old.

An hour passed and Lin Xiu wiped away the perspiration on his forehead. He muttered to himself with slight exhaustion, “I’ve finally pieced it together…”

“So cool…” A soldier saw the android that was taller than a human and exclaimed in shock.

They found out Lin Xiu was constantly taking a few components and strange metal gears back, but they did not expect them to be parts of an android.

“This is a combat android from the mech era, it is said that one wields the strength of a rank 1 warrior,” Lin Xiu explained.

Lin Xiu felt an indescribable sense of satisfaction as he looked at the android that he had fixed up by himself.

There were many corroded and old gears on the android and he did not know whether they would operate.

But they could only know once they tested it.

There was a circular notch in the center of the android’s body. He opened it up and placed an Odd Crystal in.

Lin Xiu then pressed a few buttons on the android.

At this moment, ‘ka ka ka’ sounds came out from the android.

The android started to move as the gears rotated slowly and produced the clanking sounds.

“Is it working?” Li Yi could not help but ask as he looked at the tall android.

“It shouldn’t be a problem.” Lin Xiu nodded his head. Very soon, the android’s body started to release lights.

Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up when he saw the success of activating the android. The corroded parts of the gears inside the android were in fact just the exterior. As the android started to turn on, all of this corrosion fell to the ground.

“This has the strength of a rank 1 warrior? Impossible.” A soldier chuckled when he saw the slow android.

“Do you want to give it a go?” Lin Xiu glanced at him and revealed a strange smile.

“Fine, I’ll give it a go!” The soldier replied in disdain, he did not think that he would lose to an android that was just fixed up, much less one that was considered an antique.

“Attack.” Lin Xiu gave the android the order.

When he activated it, Lin Xiu recorded his own voice into the android. If there were no accidents, it should be able to discern his voice.

As expected, after hearing Lin Xiu’s command, the android body started to move.

It released sour metal sounds.

“Watch me bring this android to its knees!” The soldier laughed and clenched his fist as he unleashed a punch!

And at this moment, the originally slow looking android’s gears started to revolve at high speed and it moved extremely fast!

Xu Wen and the others were stunned.

At that moment, the soldier that was originally laughing changed his expression instantly.

With a loud bang, his fist collided with the android and released a low thump but did not affect the android whatsoever.

And at the same time, the android’s large fist smashed onto his body and forced him to drop to the ground.

“Stop.”

When Lin Xiu gave the order, the android immediately froze and stood in its original position.

“So strong!” Li Yi’s jaws were wide opened as he commented.

“Cough cough, is this bloody thing really from the previous century?” The soldier that was forced to the ground was convinced. He crawled up and asked in disbelief.

“En, this could be considered the strongest invention in the previous century, but it has its shortcoming as well, and that is its quick exhaustion of Odd Crystals,” Lin Xiu answered helplessly.

A rank 1 Odd Crystal would be finished in less than an hour.

“Let’s go, we need to return to Guang Ming Fort, the instructors and the others should be there.” Xu Wen looked at the others and said.

Everyone became slightly emotional when they heard him.

A month, they had battled for an entire month.

They saw the ferocity of zombies, the horrifying evolved beasts, and the painful deaths of their comrades.

Everything felt like a dream.

Some soldiers even started to tear up.

Leaving this place could be considered stepping away from Hell’s gates.

“I guess a new batch of federation soldiers will be sent here next year.” Lin Xiu could not help but feel emotional as he walked out.

Although they had cleared the monsters, new monsters and zombies would most probably run over in a year.

It was an endless cycle.

As they passed the machine town, they encountered a few ‘familiar’ figures again.

“Eh, it’s you guys.” A man laughed out malevolently.

Xu Wen looked ahead and frowned. The last time they encountered them, Lin Xiu’s mechanical sword was taken by them.

“Seems like you have completed your mission well, are those Odd Crystals inside your bags?” Another man saw bags strung across Lin Xiu’s waist. He knew that they would contain Odd Crystals obtained from evolved beasts.

They had asked around and found out that federal soldiers were dispatched to clear the place for a month and would return after the month. Who would have thought they would encounter them again?

Their eyes were filled with greed as they looked at the pouches and the large android beside Lin Xiu.

They would earn a lot of money by selling those items! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Do you know the consequence of extorting federal soldiers?” Xu Wen looked at them coldly.

But they were not afraid and laughed out loud instead.

“I just want to extort things from you guys!”
