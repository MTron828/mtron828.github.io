Chapter 673: Strong

Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

As Lin Xiu’s words just fell, one of the warriors who was kneeling on the ground, had his spear that he placed on the ground flew directly into Lin Xiu’s hand!

Boom–

With the spear in hand, Lin Xiu rushed out!

“Courting death!!!”

Seeing Lin Xiu unfolding the ‘Sphere’, was not afraid of the laser rays at all, and rushed towards him and others, the leader was infuriated. With a roar, he was about to attack Lin Xiu empty-handed!

His right hand clenched into a fist, and at this moment, a dark red flame burst out from it.

‘After dodging the shot that Lin Xiu stabbed over, his punch was about to hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere!

Boom—

As his fist attacked, there was a loud noise in the air.

Although his punch was powerful, it was cleverly dodged by Lin Xiu.

Moreover, the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand moved fluidly, and at this moment, he stabbed it again!

The moment the spear was stabbed, it suddenly turned into dozens or hundreds, and a terrifying cold light burst forth.

Sphere!!”

This marksmanship was really terrifying, and the leader has a look of fear in his eyes. At this time, he has no choice but to unfold the ‘Sphere!

But just when he thought his ‘Sphere’ could withstand Lin Xiu’s attack, something unexpected happened.

Bang bang bang-

As Lin Xiu’s spear stabbed on his ‘Sphere’, a loud sound suddenly sounded, he felt an extremely powerful impact, and while he kept retreating, a large number of cracks appeared on the ‘Sphere’!

Snapped–

At the next moment, with a crisp sound, his ‘Sphere’ immediately burst!

How is this possible!!! Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The leader’s face was full of shock.

This was the hardest ‘Sphere’ of a warrior!

It was broken like that!?

Before he had time to think again, the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was flaming with flames, and instantly stabbed him in the head!

Boom–

In the next instant, the spear went straight through his head!

With an explosion, his entire head was like a bursting watermelon.

The blood time splashed onto the cheeks of the skeleton thieves behind.

“Kill him!!!”

These Skeleton Thieves were ruthless characters. When they saw this scene, they pulled out the sword hanging from their waist and surrounded Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu’s expression remained unchanged, he held a spear in both hands, instead of retreating, he attacked!

Boom—

With a single stroke of the spear, a flaming bird burst out.

‘Those who rushed over first were directly burned by the flaming bird.

But there were too many of them, and some of their weapons were still slashing on Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

The electric arcs that flickered on Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ spread to the bodies of those around him at once!

Their faces changed greatly, and they felt that their bodies could not move at all.

‘Those lightnings had a paralyzing effect on their bodies!

Swoosh—

Before they could respond, the spear slashed, and blood was all over.

‘Those warriors who were kneeling on the ground, watching Lin Xiu being surrounded and attacked by more than 100 people, suddenly opened their eyes wide, and their eyes were full of disbelief.

This… is too terrifying!

“Brother Lin…”

Seeing this scene, Lei Tong swallowed secretly.

‘These days, he and Lin Xiu were practicing together in the training room. Apart from seeing that Lin Xiu used the sword very well, he didn’t realize how strong Lin Xiu actually was.

But the strength that Lin Xiu showed at this time was really too strong, a little too strong.

“F*ck his mother!” Lei Tong got excited at this time. He picked up the sword on the ground, and rushed over!

“Kill them!”

‘The rest of the warriors were also driven up. At this time, holding their own weapons, they also began to attack the members of the Skeleton Thieves!

The scene became extremely chaotic in an instant.

As the head of the last member of the Skeleton Thieves in this hall was pierced by the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand, the surrounding warriors heaved a sigh of relief.

“Brother Lin, you’ve been hiding your real strength…” Lei Tong said a little out of breath at this time.

Looking at Lin Xiu’s spear head with blood dripping down, Lei Tong couldn’t help but tremble.

“Where is the pilot cabin?”

Lin Xiu looked at the people around him and said aloud at this time.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, a warrior pointed to the other side and said, “Over there.”

Lin Xiu nodded, holding the spear in his hand, and continued to walk forward.

Now that the spacecraft was still in slow flight, there should be some people in the control room that hadn’t been killed yet.

Most likely, they were controlled by the Skeleton Thieves.

“Who is it!?”

Sure enough, as Lin Xiu walked over, at the corner, he could clearly see two men with laser guns.

‘When they saw Lin Xiu appear with a long spear, they instinctively aimed at Lin Xiu with the laser gun in their hands!

Boom–

However, Lin Xiu’s reaction speed was obviously very fast. With a single stroke of the spear, the spear covered by Lin Xiu’s powerful source strength was already sharp to such an extent that it directly cut the laser gun in their hands into two halves!

“No…” The two men opened their eyes wide, and when they wanted to make a move, a stinging pain came from their throats, and blood spattered.

“Drive in this direction or else I’ll kill them all.”

Several men from the Skeleton Thieves were holding laser guns at the heads of these pilots.

“Yes, yes…”

These pilots shivered and nodded quickly.

The Skeleton Thieves’ spaceship’s exit was in line with the exit of the spaceship they were currently riding on, and all the people over there had come to this spaceship.

In this situation, they were scared to death.

“But why hasn’t the boss come over yet – could it be that those warriors dare to resist?”

Aman said aloud while holding a laser gun in his hand at a pilot’s head.

“Humph! The boss is a rank 8 warrior, and so many brothers went over, if those people dare to resist, just kill them all.”

Aman said with a sneer at this time.

“That’s true…”

Hearing these people’s words, the pilot trembled even more at this time.

Bang bang bang-

At this moment, there was a knock on the door here.

Hearing the knock on the door, a man gestured to a man next to him.

The man nodded, and then said fiercely to the pilot, “Be obedient.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he walked directly to the door.

He pressed a switch next to it, and the door automatically opened to both sides.
