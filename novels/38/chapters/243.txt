Chapter 244: Diamond Body Skill – ‘Transient Steps’

Seeing that Lin Xiu seemed to be fine but lying on the ground without any strength, Zhang Yin and the others were relieved at this moment.

Lin Xiu was panting on the ground. After resting for 15 minutes, his physical strength had begun to recover at this time.

Lin Xiu slowly propped himself up from the ground and slowly stood up.

Many of the students from the Sacred Region Academy who were there had already left.

“Hmph, you won again.” Ouyang Hang walked over at this time, looking at Lin Xiu in the arena, and said with a gloomy expression.

He was so mad that he could blow up now.

He painstakingly planned everything and didn’t expect that Yu Yi would actually lose.

And he even lost so terribly. He was seriously injured and unconscious at this moment, and he wasn’t even sure if Yu Yi was alive or dead.

“What? You asked Yu Yi to do it because you didn’t have the guts?” Lin Xiu saw Ouyang Hang and could easily guess that Yu Yi might have been instigated by Ouyang Hang to challenge him. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Ouyang Hang’s face suddenly changed.

A psychological shadow suddenly surfaced when he looked at Lin Xiu.

Especially when he thought of the scene when Lin Xiu lifted his foot and nearly stomped his head. A chill went down his spine and he shuddered at the thought.

“Hng! You thought I had no guts?” Ouyang Hang spat, trying to keep up his appearances.

He didn’t want to admit that he was afraid of Lin Xiu.

“Then do you want to also make an appointment for a battle?” Lin Xiu smiled.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Ouyang Hang suddenly staggered and almost fell to the ground.

“I will come and find you personally, then!” Ouyang Hang turned to Lin Xiu and said angrily.

As soon as he finished speaking and before Lin Xiu could say something, he waved and walked out directly.

His face became extremely cold. Yu Yi had already placed the Diamond Body skill card on the workbench long ago.

It was too late for him to go back on the deal now even if he wanted to.

Thinking of the Diamond body skill card becoming Lin Xiu’s, he suddenly felt a hint of pain in his heart.

But he had no other choice and could only continue looking for opportunities to deal with Lin Xiu.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu glanced at Zhang Yin and the others, then said aloud.

Zhang Yin and the others nodded and jumped off the arena with Lin Xiu.

The arena was now full of potholes and pits, and it was quite badly damaged.

One must know that this kind of stone was mined from another planet and it was even tougher than steel.

It was rarely destroyed to this extent.

Lin Xiu walked over to the workbench and the students of the Sacred Region Academy immediately made way.

All of them were looking at Lin Xiu.

Looking at Lin Xiu in such close proximity, they realized that Lin Xiu looked very young.

His cheeks were still slightly tender.

Such a young man actually defeated Yu Yi!

“This is your spoils of war.” At this time, a man on the workbench saw Lin Xiu coming over and handed a box to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded and took the box.

He opened it and inside was a diamond card giving off a resplendent glow.

Diamond body skill card!

“‘Transient steps’!?”

Zhang Yin, Li Ping, and Jiang Li looked at the words on the diamond skill card and were very surprised.

Body skill cards were rarer than skill cards.

Especially the Diamond Body skill card, it fetched a sky-high price!

They didn’t expect that Yu Yi would bet Lin Xiu with a diamond body skill card and let Lin Xiu win!

He was probably going to cry to death, right?

The name of this skill card may sound ordinary but Lin Xiu was very shocked.

Although he knew that this was a Diamond body skill card, he didn’t expect it to be this body skill card at all.

Yes, Lin Xiu has heard of this body skill.

He saw it on the Warrior Union website.

Transient Steps was one of the top 30 body skills in the world!!!

And it was said that this body skill was the secret of the Ouyang family.

Only the direct line of their own family could have the opportunity to learn this body skill!

It was clear how precious this body skill was.

Wait a minute.

At this moment, Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something and suddenly looked startled.

“Hahaha!”

Lin Xiu seemed to have figured something out at this time and burst into laughter; Zhang Yin and the others were puzzled.

Lin Xiu thought of Ouyang Hang and suddenly understood that Ouyang Hang must have given Yu Yi the Diamond body skill card first and got Yu Yi to take the Diamond body skill card to entice Lin Xiu to a battle.

He probably thought that Lin Xiu would definitely lose, so he was not afraid that this skill card would fall into Lin Xiu’s hands.

And this was indeed true at that time.

As a rank 6 warrior, Yu Yi’s strength was too strong and his final skill was also very powerful.

If he hadn’t learned the ‘Overlord Spear Art’ in conjunction with ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’, even if he used the ‘Fury’ skill, there would be no other skill that could withstand Yu Yi’s last skill.

“Lin Xiu, it’s time for you to treat us to a meal, right?” Zhang Yin said with a smile.

“Yes, class monitor, you must treat us!” Li Ping and Jiang Li also chimed in.

Seeing that Lin Xiu had obtained the Diamond Skill Card, they were not jealous. Instead, they were sincerely happy for Lin Xiu.

“No problem.” Lin Xiu said with a smile, he was also very happy.

It was a Diamond body skill card and also one of the top 30 body skills in the world, ‘Transient Steps’ – money can’t buy it!

But as much as Lin Xiu was happy, he also felt uneasy.

This Ouyang Hang turned out to be a direct line of descent of that powerful Ouyang family and Lin Xiu had a feeling that there would be more trouble coming to the door.

After leaving the Tower of Tournament, it was already the afternoon.

After Zhang Yin, Li Ping, and Jiang Li went to the high-end restaurant in the academy to fill their stomachs, Lin Xiu carried his Dark Edge Spear and returned to the villa.

Just as Lin Xiu was leaving, a figure suddenly appeared in front of him, blocking his path which made him frown.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Xiu said faintly, staring at a woman in front of him.

‘Isn’t this girl Tian Zixia from Class 1 of the North Campus?’

This girl was considered his enemy and now she probably hated him terribly. She appeared here and she definitely didn’t have nice things to say to him.

Tian Zixia looked at Lin Xiu with cold eyes, then smiled and said, “Lin Xiu, do you want to know where Luo Yue went?”
