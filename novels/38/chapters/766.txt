Chapter 767: The Power of a Peak Master Warrior

?

Boom–

The double-sided axe chopped on the black shells of the beetles, making a dull sound.

But this double-sided axe has no way to cut out the wound directly.

What a hard shell!!!

Seeing this scene, the expression in Liu Pan’s eyes changed greatly.

And at this time, the bloodthirsty beetle made a ‘hissing’ sound and even sprayed out some blue mucus.

“Fuck!”

Seeing this scene, Liu Pan couldn’t help but retreat to the back subconsciously.

Those blue mucus were scattered on the ground at this moment.

Then it sounded like it was being corroded, accompanied by white smoke.

Liu Pan couldn’t help but gulped.

There was a look of shock in his eyes.

At this time, Lin Xiu had already held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and attacked the bloodthirsty beetle.

bang bang bang-

As the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand swung and attacked the bloodthirsty beetle, a loud noise sounded at this moment.

The spearhead of the spear pierced the hard shell of the beetle and suddenly made deep indentations one by one.

Some blue blood was spattered.

“Damn it, why can’t I break the defense!”

Seeing this scene, Liu Pan said with wide eyes.

“There are bloodthirsty beetles coming over!”

At this moment, An Qi and Qian Lin looked at the other side and found more and more bloodthirsty beetles attacking them.

The number of these bloodthirsty beetles was too large, it was terrifying.

The speed at which the warriors killed could not keep up with the speed of the bloodthirsty beetles.

Among the rank 9 warriors, those who were relatively weak had already suffered a lot of casualties at this time.

And Qian Qiurong frowned slightly at this time.

Originally, he wanted to retain his strength, but in this situation, there was no other way.

He took a deep breath and waved the sword in his hand.

“Go!”

As he shouted, the long sword instantly transformed into hundreds of thousands of strikes!

Whoosh whoosh—

All of them rushed towards the front!

At this moment, a large number of bloodthirsty beetles in front were all accidentally pierced by these long swords!

“This... this skill is too powerful!”

“Is this the power of a peak master warrior!?”

When some warriors saw this scene, they couldn’t help but exclaimed.

At this time, Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

The entire spear was already filled with red flames.

boom–

In the next moment, as the spear stabbed out, it hit the bloodthirsty beetle’s small head and instantly stabbed its head off!

A black odd crystal fell out of its burst head.

“Huh? Rank 8 odd crystal?”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help frowning slightly when he saw the rank 8 odd crystal at this moment.

These evolved beasts, obviously had rank 9 strength, but only had rank 8 odd crystals.

Then it proves that his conjecture is correct.

These darn things must have evolved into rank 9 evolved beasts in a short period of time due to the influence of something. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Then, what is the influence?

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu became more and more curious.

After killing this bloodthirsty beetle, An Qi, Qian Lin and Liu Pan also killed a bloodthirsty beetle together.

Looking to the other side, he found that almost all of the bloodthirsty beetles had been killed.

Many warriors used weapons to open the heads of those bloodthirsty beetles, then dug out the odd crystals.

After all, these were all rank 8 odd crystals and even if they are sold, they can be sold for a lot of money.

What’s more, when the warrior reaches a higher level, the more he cultivated, the slower the speed and he would need to absorb the energy of the odd crystals continuously, so that the speed of cultivation could be accelerated. Hence, the demand for the odd crystals in the warrior world was still very large.

“The strength of this Qianqiu Rong is too terrifying.”

Looking at the corpses of the bloodthirsty beetle over there, Liu Pan couldn’t help but say aloud.

“Are you guys all right?”

Lin Xiu spoke to An Qi and Qian Lin at this time.

“We’re fine.”

The two men shook their heads at the same time.

“It’s just that my weapon is a little damaged.”

An Qi said a little unhappily.

When she attacked the bloodthirsty beetle with the weapon in her hand just now, the bloodthirsty beetle bit the weapon.

For some reason, the bloodthirsty beetle’s teeth were so sharp.

It even made a few dents in her weapon.

“Use these.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu saw the weapons on the ground not far away. He waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand and at this moment, the two spears on the ground flew directly into their hands.

Qian Lin and An Qi subconsciously caught the two spears.

“You guys wanted to learn how to use spears right? Use this weapon now then.”

Lin Xiu said aloud at this time.

These were the weapons of the dead rank 9 warriors. The quality of these long spears was very good and they were not ordinary.

“Ok.”

Qian Lin and An Qi nodded at this moment, then changed into long spears as their weapons.

“Do you guys really know how to use long spears?”

Liu Pan said curiously at this time.

It was indeed difficult to master a weapon like a long spear.

“Would you like to try it?”

An Qi snorted and spun the Dark Edge spear in both hands, the tip of the spear pointed at Liu Pan instantly and said.

“Cough cough, forget it.”

Liu Pan smiled at this time, then waved his hand and said.

Judging from An Qi’s simple marksmanship, she is indeed very skilled.

At this time, the warriors in the front had also gathered at this time.

They continued to walk forward.

“Let’s go too.”

Lin Xiu looked at everyone, then continued on.

After these bloodthirsty beetles were killed, at this time, it seems that the existence of their evolved beasts has disappeared.

“Will there be any evolved beasts?”

Liu Pan said aloud while walking.

“Shut your mouth for me.”

An Qi glared at Fatty.

The valley in front is wider and it is also found that there are several forked roads in front.

Slowly, Lin Xiu and the others also discovered the appearance of other warriors.

“So... so many warriors.”

Seeing this scene, Liu Pan couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

There were constantly more and more warriors gathered on this side. The number of these warriors was simply too many.

“Eh? President Qian is here too?”

At this time, a warrior came over and said to Qian Qiurong.

“Look at you people, you must have been attacked just now?”

“That’s right, we met some evolved beasts.”

Qian Qiurong said in a faint voice at this time.

“What about you guys?”
