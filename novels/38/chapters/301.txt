Chapter 302: Single Slash Shocks The heavens

The probability of 30% was considered extremely high.

While thinking of this, Lin Xiu raised Dark Edge Spear and started his counterattack!

Profound Intent, Torrential storm of rose flowers!!!!!

Lin Xiu’s eyes flashed with a light as he unleashed Dark Edge Spear at an extremely fast speed!

Sou sou sou-

Vacuum explosions were produced by the stabs.

The spear moved like a dragon and produced more than 10 phantom figures towards Su Xie.

Su Xie’s expression changed when he saw the attack.

He was unable to block the attacks and decided to retreat backward.

In that short span of time, Lin Xiu had unleashed too many strikes that even a rank 7 warrior like him did not dare go head-on against.

“Want to leave?” Lin Xiu snorted. Although he was a rank 5 warrior, he was not afraid of the rank 7 warrior and even charged at him!

Clang clang clang-

Su Xie’s expression changed as he used his sword to parry.

The two weapons collided endlessly and produced metallic collision sounds.

“Brat, it seems like you can hold your own weight.” Su Xie snorted coldly while parrying Lin Xiu’s attacks.

His eyes were spewing anger and venom because of his son’s death. He hated Lin Xiu to the core.

Just as he said that, his body suddenly disappeared!

Where is he!?

Lin Xiu stabbed forward with Dark Edge Spear and hit nothing with Su Xie’s sudden disappearance.

Lin Xiu did not know that Su Xie had appeared behind him and had slashed towards him.

‘Go and die!’

His eyes were filled with killing intent as he slashed down on Lin Xiu’s body. This strike cut Lin Xiu’s body in half!

Bang-

It was a perfect slice as Lin Xiu’s body split perfectly in half!

‘Is he finally dead!?’

Although Su Xie hated Lin Xiu to the bones, he felt that something was wrong when he saw how easily Lin Xiu was killed.

No blood came out.

‘No, something’s off!’

But right at this time, Su Xie suddenly felt a powerful aura from behind.

‘Behind me!’

Clang-

The sword in his hand immediately blocked his back. He sensed an extremely powerful force erupt onto his sword.

He turned to look and saw that Lin Xiu had appeared behind him.

Lin Xiu focused on him and continued to attack with Dark Edge Spear.

But Su Xie reacted quick enough and parried Dark Edge Spear

“What skill is this!?” Su Xie looked at him and asked.

The person that he had slashed felt like a phantom.

“You don’t have to know.” Lin Xiu replied indifferently as he unleashed even more attacks.

Although Lin Xiu had taken the initiative for this attack, he felt that he was unable to occupy the advantage.

The man’s defense was impenetrable and made Lin Xiu feel helpless.

His Mirror Image could split two bodies, one was killed and Lin Xiu had another left/

Lin Xiu felt that he had to reserve this remaining mirror image to be used at a crucial moment. Otherwise, he would be in trouble.

“Is it my turn now?” After blocking Lin Xiu’s continuous strikes, Su Xie sneered and mocked.

In that instant, he suddenly smashed Lin Xiu’s spear away and used his sword to stab at him!

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted at the sight of this. He immediately held Dark Edge Spear’s shaft with both hands and blocked the attack.

Clang clang clang-

But Su Xie did not stop with a single strike in his retaliation and unleashed a barrage of attacks.

Lin Xiu held Dark Edge Spear and blocked relentlessly, the strikes from the sword caused Dark Edge Spear to tremble incessantly.

Lin Xiu’s hands had turned numb.

“Single slash Shocks the heavens!!!” Su Xie suddenly roared as the sword unleashed four gleams of light. Terrifying sword qi shot out from his sword!

The air around distorted as the horrifying sword qi erupted.

The powerful sword qi surged towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu’s expression changed.

Diamond skill!!!!

This was definitely a diamond skill!

The sword qi had yet to even reach Lin Xiu, but he was able to sense the piercing pain.

Sou- 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

In that instant, Su Xie’s body suddenly disappeared from his original spot. He charged towards Lin Xiu with the intent of destroying Lin Xiu!

Bang-

The sword allowed him to penetrate through Lin Xiu!

A large hole appeared in Lin Xiu’s chest. But like before, not an ounce of blood came out.

This was the effect of Mirror Image! Lin Xiu had activated the remaining body.

He initially thought to use it to kill Su Xie, but Su Xie’s sword strike was too terrifying. If he did not utilize Mirror Image, he might be the one to die!

“Hmph! Puny trick!” But Su Xie was not as shaken as before and snorted. In that instant, he charged towards the other direction!

Lin Xiu appeared but immediately saw a black figure ahead of him.

‘How did he know to come here!?’

It was undoubtedly Su Xie, but how did he know Lin Xiu’s appearance?!

Lin Xiu’s expression changed once again.

And the sword in his hand still had the layer of sword qi that distorted the air around it.

He had kept the majority of power from his previous strike and did not utilize it at all.

“Brat, you think I’ll fall for the same trick twice?!” Su Xie sneered.
