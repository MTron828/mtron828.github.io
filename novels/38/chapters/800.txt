Chapter 801: About to be King Warrior

At this time, Liu Pan’s face was a little pale and ugly.

“That’s too much eh.”

An Qi said with a nasty expression.

“Uncle Yan is just trying to ensure my safety. Tell your friend to watch what he say and does.”

Sun Zi spread out his hands, then said with a smile.

“Okay, let’s go.”

Sun Zi looked at Yan Yongxin who was beside him and said aloud.

Just when he turned around and walked a few steps, he stopped again, then looked behind him, the corners of his mouth curled up and said in a dark voice, “You guys don’t have to wait for him, he won’t be back.”

Yan Yongxin also showed a contemptuous smile at this time.

“What do you mean!”

Hearing his words, An Qi couldn’t sit still and wanted to question him.

“Literally what I said. The auction has started. I hope you can compete for that long spear.”

Sun Zi said lightly.

“You...”

Just when An Qi was about to rush over, the same giant lightning net appeared in front of her.

“Damn!”

Looking at the lightning net blocking her, An Qi couldn’t help stamping her feet angrily.

“Hu.”

“It is finally over...”

And Lin Xiu, who was in the cave, slowly opened his eyes at this time and found that although he was in the midst of this hellfire, he could no longer feel the pain.

The surrounding hellfire, at this time, seems to be slowly getting smaller.

The source flame has been completely absorbed by him!

Standing up, as Lin Xiu’s source strength gathered, a dark blue flame appeared in Lin Xiu’s palm.

“Hahaha!”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help laughing at this time. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This just made him too excited, this is not an ordinary flame, this is the so-called hellfire!

It was actually absorbed by him.

But this time, he took a huge risk.

And it was with his experience of absorbing the Red lotus fire and Thunder lotus fire, the decompression of the heart of frost and the engulf skill of the system that he could succeed.

If it was an ordinary warrior, it would be over by now.

Lin Xiu raised his head and looked up. The next moment, as soon as his legs exerted force, he immediately jumped out!

It was already daylight outside.

The surrounding hellfire has slowly started to disappear.

The terrifying and violent temperature of the entire mountain peak also slowly dropped.

“It seems that after the source flame of the hellfire has been absorbed, this Divine Fire Cave can no longer be called the Divine Fire Cave...”

Lin Xiu looked at the flames around the mountain, which were already getting smaller and smaller.

Because all the clothes on his body were burnt off, at this time, Lin Xiu was naked.

When he walked to the side of the mountain, Lin Xiu realized that the warriors he killed had turned into skeletons.

“How long has it been...”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself, then found a set of clothes that were not completely damaged and put them on.

Oh right, my weapon...

He seemed to be left on the top of the mountain.

But after coming out at this time, he didn’t find his weapon.

Moreover, the temperature of the flame above the mountain is too high and master warrior-level warriors probably wouldn’t be able to come up.

Yan Yongxin took it away?

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed.

As he descended the mountain, Lin Xiu checked his attribute panel and suddenly realized that he had been promoted to another level!

Level: 54

Experience points: 0/3000000000000

Strength: 3085

Physique: 3284

Speed: 1031

Rage build-up: 0/100

Potential Points: 54

After assigning the potential points to the strength attribute, Lin Xiu clearly felt a force coming.

Level 54.

Finally, level 54.

If he leveled up again, he will step into the level of King warrior!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but get excited.

But the most important thing right now is to hurry back to Sky City.

Because he didn’t know how much time had gone by and if he didn’t go back soon, he won’t be able to make it to Fengyun City!

“Also, it’s time to get his weapon back.”

And in Cangqiong City, the auction has officially started.

There are all kinds of powerful people sitting around, all kinds of treasures, even king-level odd crystals, are all starting to be auctioned.

“Brother Lin’s weapon, I must buy it.”

At this time, Liu Pan stared at the stage and said secretly.

There are too many auction items. After about two or three hours, finally, something wrapped in black cloth was transported to the middle table.

This thing, it took several staff members to lift it up.

“Alright, the next auction item is a weapon!”

At this time, the host smiled mysteriously, then said loudly.

Weapon?!

The people around were surprised.

Because they just watched several staff members carry it up.

What kind of weapon is it? It’s so heavy.

The host walked over and untied the black cloth.

A dark spear with a special shelf lying horizontally appeared in front of everyone.

“This is a long spear made of materials that have never been seen on our planet.”

“Everyone saw it just now. The weight of this weapon is...”

“30,000 catties!”

As the host’s words fell, there was an uproar around him.

A weapon weighing 30,000 catties, what material is it made of?

“This must be fake…”

“How could it be so heavy...”

The people around was in disbelief.

“If anyone doesn’t believe it, they can try it out.” The host said with a smile.

Some people who didn’t believe it came up at this time, then lifted it hard, but there was no way to lift it at all.

“Also, the sharpness of this spear is unimaginable.”

At this moment, the supporter held a special metal plate and gently knocked on the tip of the spear. The tip of the spear went straight through the metal plate!

“This is gold plated, which is very hard, but this weapon can clearly penetrate it.”

There was an uproar around and many people were discussing.

“Low price, 5 billion, each increase is no less than 100 million gold coins, bid begins!!!”

“5 billion?!”

Hearing the host’s words, An Qi and the others opened their eyes wide.

This number is too much and each time the price increase is not less than 100 million, they estimate...

“10 billion.”

At this moment, someone has already offered their price.

“50 billion!”

At this time, a middle-aged man said indifferently.

The people around fell silent. It was just a weapon and some people found that it wasn’t worth so much money.

What’s more, this is just a long spear and it is so heavy and difficult to use.

“5 billion for the first time…”

“5 billion for the second time...”

“5 billion for the third time!”

boom–

“Deal, congratulations, this gentleman, this magic weapon is yours!”

The host said with a smile.

“Who said it’s his?”

But at this moment, a voice came over.

The Dark Edge spear seemed to tremble, making a loud ‘clattering’ sound!
