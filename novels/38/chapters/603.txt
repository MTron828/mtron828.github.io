Chapter 604: The Photo Sent By Luo Yue?

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

There was more than one academy team that had provoked them like this.

“These people are really annoying.”

Ouyang Hang said with a cold snort.

“They’re just trying to show their strength.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said lightly.

The scene when he and others were fighting was probably spread by some people, and the more they spread, the more they became more and more amazed so that those academy teams with the same strength seemed very resentful.

“Let’s go back and have a rest, we will go to Sky City tomorrow.”

Lin Xiu carried his Dark Edge spear on his shoulder, and then left the battle field.

As they have gained enough points from the consecutive victories, the battles in the afternoon and evening were not related to the Sacred Region Academy, and they had successfully advanced.

They just needed to wait for the announcement tonight to see what time they had go over the next day.

After returning to the hotel room, Lin Xiu directly entered the system in his mind.

The title of rank 8 warrior, like the previous title, could inherit the effect of the previous title, and comes with a special skill: ‘Summon’

What is this?

Lin Xiu became curious at this time, this time he actually acquired a skill.

Takign a closer look at the skill introduction: can summon creatures from another dimension (cooling time: one week.)

“What kind of damn skill is this…” Lin Xiu couldn’t help complaining at this time, but the one-week cooldown was too long. Lin Xiu, who wanted to try it out, gave up the idea.

The introduction of the new system skill ‘Power of the Stars’ was very simple: absorb the power of stars and improve your own abilities. (Limited to use in the dark night, cooling time: three days.) Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

The cooldown of this skill was also quite long and could only be used at night, which seemed quite restrictive.

Looking at the number of lottery draws, there were actually three more. He was probably given after the upgrade.

Looking at the gene lock interface, the rank 4 gene lock was still in a blocked state and couldn’t be clicked to unlock, which made Lin Xiu a little sad.

Although unlocking the genetic lock was very dangerous, if it was successful, it would bring a qualitative change to the body!

Di di di-

Just as Lin Xiu was thinking about it, a sound came from the phone on the table.

Hearing this, Lin Xiu glanced over there subconsciously, and in the next moment, his eyes widened.

Because Lin Xiu could clearly see that a message from Luo Yue was displayed on the screen of his mobile phone.

Luo Yue actually sent a message to him?

Lin Xiu felt a little unbelievable, then took his phone directly, and just clicked in, and what he saw made Lin Xiu’s eyes widen.

“This...”

This was a photo of Luo Yue. Someone took it secretly but it was Luo Yue holding the phone and she seemed to see something, then a smile appeared on the corner of her mouth.

“Hahaha, wonder what the kid’s reaction?” At the same time, in the Luo family’s mansion, Luo Yan secretly held Luo Yue’s mobile phone and sent the photos she secretly took to Lin Xiu.

Because Luo Yue didn’t have any contacts on her phone and Lin Xiu was the only one, which immediately made Luo Yan even more curious.

“Luo Yan!”

Just when Luo Yan was about to do some prank, Luo Yue appeared.

“I didn’t take your mobile phone and send your photo!”

When Luo Yan saw Luo Yue coming back, she said aloud, in the next moment, as soon as her body skill was unlocked, her whole body instantly disappeared in place.

Luo Yue looked a little powerless at this time, Luo Yan’s body skill was so fast, she couldn’t catch Luo Yan at all.

At this time, she walked over and picked up the phone she had placed on the table. Luo Yue saw that Luo Yan had sent the photo she secretly took to Lin Xiu.

Seeing this, Luo Yue’s eyes were fixed on the screen, and her neck seemed to be a little red.

Then she tapped on the phone and recalled them.

“The photo is beautiful.”

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s message came again.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s message, Luo Yue’s eyes widened, a rare expression that seemed a little shy.

He saw it!

In the next moment, after thinking for a while, Luo Yue added: I didn’t send it.

“Ok, I know.”

Lin Xiu also felt a little funny at this time, but he still saved the photo before Luo Yue retracted it.

Seeing the message sent by Luo Yue, Lin Xiu also sent another message.

“Humph!” Luo Yue subconsciously replied after seeing Lin Xiu’s message.

But as soon as she sent it, she seemed to think of something, and then she withdrew it.

“Go to sleep.”

“Luo Yue, I realized that you’re very cute.”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help laughing out loud at this time, especially the word ‘humph’ sent by Luo Yue, which made Lin Xiu imagine Luo Yue’s coquettish act.

“I’ll kill you.”

After Luo Yue sent a sentence, she never sent another message.

“Good night.”

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then sent a message and saw that Luo Yue’s avatar had dimmed – she must be gone.

However, at this time, Lin Xiu was in a good mood. He held the spear in his hand and waved it in this small room.

Now, as Lin Xiu brandished his spear, there was an explosion-like sound in the air.

Now Lin Xiu’s basic marksmanship has been practiced to an extremely proficient state as if the man and spear are one.

In the Tower of Trials, Lin Xiu has learned too many things, but the skills there were some of the old skills, and there were no high-level skills. If he wanted to be strong and have destructive power, he still needed to find it himself.

After practicing for a while, Lin Xiu was completely tired, so he took a shower and then went to sleep.

Lin Xiu seemed very happy tonight.

The second day soon arrived. Originally, he was going to go directly to Sky City to participate in the official competition, but it seemed that because there were too many colleges participating this time and there were also many teams that had advanced, exceeding the original target. Therefore, it seemed that this morning, some of the academy teams would be eliminated, and the rest would go to Sky City in the afternoon instead.

“There are only fifteen academy teams in our division that can participate, but now our number has exceeded the quota, so now we will hold a knockout match.”

At this time, all the teams that could advance were here and a staff member announced.

When the people around heard this, they were in an uproar, but they could only accept this fact.

“So, how is it going to work now?”

A man stood up and said to the staff member.

As he spoke, the rest of the people’s eyes also turned to the staff member.
