Chapter 1102: Turn the Others Blind

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Usually, when there are question marks like these, it would mean that something good would appear.

This interface was similar to the previous one and there are ten slots in it.

Three of them were warrior skills cards, three with odd crystals, three of them with a question mark and the very last one was for the big prize.

Lin Xiu didn’t need the skills card of the odd crystals. He only wanted those with the question marks.

This was because there would definitely be rare items inside it.

Let’s do three continuous ones then!

He had three chances anyway.

As Lin Xiu selected the option, the roulette started spinning.

“Stop!”

As Lin Xiu screamed internally, the roulette that was spinning before slowly stopped.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations master on getting one odd crystal!”

“Congratulations master for getting one warrior skills card!”

“Congratulations master for getting one mystery prize!”

As the notifications came from his mind, Lin Xiu let out a breath of relief.

“I was thinking that I must have had bad luck since it was odd crystals and warrior skills cards. I didn’t think that there would be a mystery prize…”

Lin Xiu mumbled to himself.

When he left the system interface, there was a bright light in front of him and an odd crystal appeared.

Lin Xiu then grabbed the odd crystal.

It was a saint beast odd crystal.

Then, there was a card floating in the air as well.

A purple gold warrior skills card.

It was a hammer skills card.

Lin Xiu was speechless. Even if this was a purple gold card, the system should have at least given him a fist warrior skills card instead since it would be more useful for him.

But, none of these mattered because the most important one was the very last one. It had to be something good.

A black bag appeared right in front of him.

This was the mystery prize.

Lin Xiu had no idea what was in it.

He reached out and grabbed onto the bag.

The bag seemed a little heavy.

As he opened the bag, Lin Xiu could see that there were a few black objects inside the bag.

What on earth are these?

As he looked at the items inside the bag, Lin Xiu was stunned.

“A….grenade?”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were wide open when he saw what it was.

There were at least 5 grenades inside the bag.

Lin Xiu was completely speechless.

Then, he used his analytical eyes to get information on these items;

[Super Flash Grenade]: After using it, you can blind the other person! ( Cause the other party to be blind for at least 3 second no matter what level they are at, will not affect the owner. )

After reading the description given by the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu’s eyes were wide open.

Blind for 3 seconds!

And it didn’t matter what the other party’s level was!

This was definitely something incredible!

“I thought this was rubbish but it turned out to be something great.”

Lin Xiu laughed as he placed it in his expansion space.

At the same time, on the other side.

“Nonsense!!!”

Inside the estate of the Bai family in Bai Di City, there was an old man with a head full of white hair that slammed the rock throne that he was sitting on.

The rock throne that was extremely hard had cracks on it almost immediately.

“You’re saying that Bai Zhanfei died on his way to Wildfire City?!”

The head of the Bai family, Bai Rui had an awful look on his face.

Standing right in front of him were several warriors of the Bai family and Bai Rui who was in rage, was trembling as well. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Yes…..not only the young master, even the five element warriors…..all of them died as well!”

One of the warriors spoke up anxiously.

“Who was the one who dared go against the Bai family?! Find him!”

Bai Rui spoke in a low tone.

“Yes!”

A group of warriors immediately answered to it.

Bai Zhanfei was the heir of the main family. His death made Bai Rui furious.

None of these warriors dared to speak to him.

“Also…”

Then, another warrior was stuttering as he was trying to say something.

“What else?!”

Bai Rui screamed.

“Elder Bai went with some of them to the Chen family and all of them are dead now…”

The man quickly reported what he knew.

“Who did it?!”

Bai Rui, who was already furious, blasted the energy in his body as he stood up.

Boom – –

The rock throne that he was sitting on earlier, blasted into tiny pieces.

“All of the warriors in the Chen family were killed as well. We are still looking into it.”

The warrior quickly answered.

“I want the answer in three days!”

Bai Rui said coldly to his men.

“Yes!”

For the next few days, Lin Xiu stayed inside the hotel and continued cultivating.

He still had to continue cultivating ‘Silence’.

Although he was able to kill lots of warriors in the Chen family in an instant, he still felt that it wasn’t the true power of this warrior skill.

He has not learnt everything yet.

Time passed quickly and it has already been a week.

Knock knock – –

While Lin Xiu was still cultivating, sitting cross legged on the floor, someone was knocking on his door.

“Who is it?”

Lin Xiu opened his eyes and asked.

“Hello, I am the staff of the hotel and I am here for maintenance.”

As soon as Lin Xiu asked, there was a make voice that came from outside the door.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he could feel something odd.

Looks like they are here already.

“Coming.”

Lin Xiu got up and went to the door.

Squekkkk—

As soon as he opened the door, there was a bright light that flashed across his eyes.

Then, a dagger filled with energy was aimed at his body!

Lin Xiu was not worried at all as he lifted up his hand and caught the dagger.

The man who held onto the dagger was shocked.

He didn’t think that there would be no harm done to Lin Xiu.

This man even caught his dagger with his bare hands!

Bakk – –

Before he could react, Lin Xiu tightened his grip on the dagger and broke it.

When Lin Xiu broke the dagger, he held on to one of the broken pieces and sliced it at the man’s neck.

Within seconds, there was blood everywhere.

The man didn’t even get the chance to release his ‘sphere’ and he was already killed by Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

Suddenly, there was a powerful bomb that directly came from outside of his window.

There was a huge explosion that happened in Lin Xiu’s room.

As he took a closer look at the sky outside, there was a large number of warriors from the Bai family who were riding on flying androids.

The other warriors who were around the hotel started running away.

“Hmph! That brat should be dead by now.”

There was a middle-aged man that spoke in a cold tone as he looked at the room that exploded.

The bomb that exploded carried highly toxic substances. Even if it was a sage warrior, he would be dead by now from the toxin by being so close to the bomb.

“There are so many of them here. Looks like they look very highly of me.”
