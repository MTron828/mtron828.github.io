Chapter 807: Arrive at Fengyun City!

There’s someone!?

Hearing Liu Pan’s words, Lin Xiu’s eyes suddenly narrowed.

After the sensing ability was released, it could be clearly felt in an instant that a group of warriors were coming from behind.

“We’re not far from Fengyun City, right?”

Lin Xiu ignored those at this time and said to Liu Pan.

“En, we should arrive tomorrow.”

“There’s still time, the game will be the day after tomorrow.”

Liu Pan said with a smile.

Soon, a group of warriors walked over from the other side.

There are about fifteen members of this group of warriors. At this time, they looked at the bonfire over there and the large piece of meat of the evolved beast being grilled by the bonfire and they all swallowed secretly.

“Brothers, can I have something to eat?”

At this moment they came over and said aloud.

Liu Pan looked at Lin Xiu at this time.

“Sure.”

“These, take them all.”

Lin Xiu nodded. These were the leftovers.

“Thanks!”

These warriors didn’t stand on ceremony. At this time, they sat on the side and shared the food.

“Where are you guys from?”

Liu Pan noticed that these people looked a little battered and at this time, he could not help but ask out of curiosity.

“Us?” After one of the warriors devoured the roasted evolved beast meat, he heard Liu Pan’s words and stopped his movements.

“We are going to go to Fengyun City to watch the game.”

They said with a smile.

“But on the way, we met robbers.” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Saying this, their faces changed.

“Robbers?”

Liu Pan was startled.

“En, because of the riots of evolved beasts in various places this month, many vehicles cannot be used, so many contestants or spectators use their own vehicles to come here.”

“A group of robbers made up of high-ranking warriors specially intercepted and robbed property nearby.”

“Brothers, are you guys also going to Fengyun City?”

A warrior pointed to the giant mechanical tiger next to Lin Xiu and Liu Pan and said aloud.

These two mechanical mounts are very conspicuous.

“Yes.”

Liu Pan laughed.

“Hahaha, then we are on the same journey.”

The warriors said with a smile.

“Come on, this is the fire spirit fruit we just picked, we’ll give you two.”

A warrior took out two red fruits from his backpack and handed them to Lin Xiu and Liu Pan.

“This is really a fire spirit fruit!?”

When Liu Pan saw these, a look of surprise appeared in his eyes.

This kind of fire spirit fruit contains very powerful energy.

If it is absorbed into one’s body, it should be of great help to oneself.

“En, these are the last two we have left. In order to thank you for inviting us to eat, we would like to give them to you.”

The warrior said with a smile.

However, at this moment, Lin Xiu and Liu Pan held the so-called ‘Fire Spirit Fruit’, then squeezed the so-called ‘Fire Spirit Fruit’ into pieces.

“You guys…!”

Seeing this scene, the faces of these warriors changed drastically.

“If you’re full, it’s time to go on your way.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“What do you mean!”

These warriors all stood up and looked at Lin Xiu and Liu Pan with a nasty look.

“Mr. Robber.”

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up slightly, then said lightly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the faces of these people suddenly turned gloomy.

“How did you know?”

The warrior who just spoke said with a gloomy expression.

“These so-called ‘fire spirit fruits’ should contain hidden poisons, right?”

Lin Xiu did not answer his words, but said lightly.

“Humph!”

The man snorted coldly and at the next moment, they took out the weapons hanging on their bodies and instantly surrounded Lin Xiu and Liu Pan.

“I originally planned to have some fun with you guys. But seems like we don’t need to pretend anymore.”

These warriors sneered.

“It seems that you guys are also two fat sheep, but you can’t go to Fengyun City, hehehe...”

“go to hell!”

The next moment, these warriors attacked Lin Xiu and Liu Pan with their weapons in their hands.

They didn’t relax at all and the strength of their whole body was directly activated.

The terrifying power burst out in an instant and it was about to kill Lin Xiu and Liu Pan directly.

“Get lost.”

Lin Xiu faintly spit out a word and with a sweep of the spear in his hand, all the warriors who surrounded him flew out.

bang bang bang-

At the moment of flying out, the bodies of these warriors burst into two halves.

Blood spattered in the air.

Liu Pan, who originally wanted to make a move, was stunned at this moment.

“Brother Lin, you are too powerful...”

Liu Pan couldn’t help being stunned at this moment.

With his sensing ability, he could clearly feel that there were many master warrior-level warriors among those warriors just now.

But Lin Xiu was only one blow and more than a dozen warriors were instantly swept out and their bodies were split in half!

The difference in strength was really too big.

“It seems that this area is not very peaceful.”

Lin Xiu looked into the distance and said aloud like he was talking to himself.

They had encountered many warriors with bad intentions here.

Moreover, there are more such warriors in this place.

Because if you wanted to go to Fengyun City, you must pass this way.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu didn’t say much and rode directly on top of the mechanical tiger.

“Wait for me!”

Liu Pan also hurriedly rode on top of the mechanical tiger.

The two of them drove the mechanical tiger and ran forward quickly.

During the next journey, there wasn’t a single soul around.

During these days, Lin Xiu’s strength did not improve much.

Because the higher the level, the more experience you need in order to level up.

The experience brought by killing master warrior-level warriors was no longer enough for Lin Xiu.

And killing the King warrior Yan Yongxin in Cang Qiong City only increased the experience progress bar to about 85%.

Just a little bit more and he could become a King warrior.

When he becomes to King warrior, there would probably be a qualitative leap in his strength.

After hurrying all night, Lin Xiu and Liu Pan had already arrived at Fengyun City the next evening!

“This is Fengyun City?”

Lin Xiu turned his eyes to the front and was surprised.

By looking at it so far from a high place, you can see that it was a city with all kinds of weird buildings.

The area of ??this city is really too big.

There seem to be many patrol aircraft flying back and forth in the sky.

The city gate is very huge and there seems to be a large number of warriors guarding it.

At this time, at the city gate, there were many people entering.
