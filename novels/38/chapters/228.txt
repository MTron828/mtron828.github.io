Chapter 229: Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City

“What is this…”

Lin Xiu looked at the skill cards in the corner.

The skill cards inside had a lot of dust over them.

They looked a bit dirty.

Like no one had organized or cleaned the place for a long time.

Lin Xiu pushed the glass of the cabinet and reached inside.

Soon, he took out a skill card.

“Hu.”

Lin Xiu blew gently at the skill card he took out, removing the dust on it.

Soon, the words on the skill card appeared.

‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’

This was a skill card that looked very practical.

The was a spear-type skill that was just right for him.

Just looking at this card, Lin Xiu felt the power in it.

“This skill card seems very powerful…”

These skill cards had no introduction on them, but Lin Xiu could feel that this skill card was very powerful.

Lin Xiu looked at this skill card and pondered for a moment before he decided to get it.

“‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’ – there are more than 20 people who practiced this card in the history of the Sacred Region Academy, but every one of them did not succeed in the end.”

At this moment, a soft voice came from behind Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was taken aback and when he turned around, he saw Luo Yue standing behind him.

“Is it so difficult to learn?” Lin Xiu asked when he heard Luo Yue’s words.

“Yeah.” Luo Yue nodded, then walked to the corner and took out another skill card covered in dust.

With a light blow, all the dust on the skill card was blown away.

“To learn this kind of skill card, you must pair it with this skill card in order to exert the greatest strength.”

Luo Yue handed another skill card to Lin Xiu while talking.

“‘Overlord’s Spear Art’?” Lin Xiu took the card that Luo Yue handed over and saw the words on it.

Gold spear art?!

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but wonder at this time, ever since he practiced the fundamental spear arts, he had never practiced any other spear arts.

Also, he didn’t see any other spear arts that could be practiced.

After all, as long as you have mastered the fundamentals, other spear arts could be easily picked up.

Also, spear arts were quite rare.

“Tsk tsk, the girl is quite knowledgeable.” At this time, the old man walked over and said while blowing out smoke.

He glanced at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, then continued to say, “You are right. In the past few years, many students wanted to learn this skill card, but they couldn’t even absorb the information of this skill, not to mention practice.”

Couldn’t absorb the skill’s information?

Lin Xiu was surprised when he heard this.

Logically speaking, as long as you placed the card on your forehead, you could absorb all the information in the skill card which allows you to have the relevant information and experience of the skill card.

But the old man said that others couldn’t even absorb the information on the skill card. What is going on?

“If you can learn this skill, these two skill cards could indeed exert the greatest power when combined, but you can only choose one of them.” The old man said faintly at this time.

“I want this one, then.” Lin Xiu said while holding the ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’ card.

After hearing what Luo Yue and the old man said, Lin Xiu felt that this skill card was even more mysterious. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

But the more this was true, the more curious Lin Xiu become. What is so mysterious about this skill card that someone who chose this skill card can’t absorb the information inside?

“Are you sure?” The old man looked at Lin Xiu with interest and asked.

Ever since the news that this skill card could not be learned spread around a few years ago, warriors who use spears would never choose this card.

After all, it was very rare to be able to choose a skill card in the Skills Pavilion.

“Yes.” Lin Xiu nodded.

At this moment, Zhang Yin and the others also walked out from the other side with a gold skill card in their hands and they seemed very happy.

They probably picked the skill card they liked.

“Register and you can leave.” The old man nodded towards the wall in front and the wall suddenly became a huge screen.

Lin Xiu and the others took a pen and signed on it one by one, then left.

After today’s battle between Lin Xiu and Zhuo Qixing, Lin Xiu’s had been known by all freshmen.

The news about Lin Xiu defeating Ouyang Hang in the G17 Ruin had also spread.

It was without a doubt that Lin Xiu was the strongest among the freshmen!

Number 1 freshman!

Lin Xiu had already returned to the villa at this time. After placing his weapon down, he took the card that he had just taken out of the Skills Pavilion out of his pocket.

“I should… be able to learn it, right?

Pa–

Just then, a black shadow flew over and Lin Xiu instinctively caught it with his hand.

Upon closer look, it turned out to be a card.

The card was gold with three bold and cursive words on it- ‘Overlord Spear Art’.

Lin Xiu was taken aback when he saw it.

“You…” Then he turned around and saw Luo Yue walking down the stairs.

“Here you go.” Luo Yue said indifferently.

“You didn’t pick a skill card?” Lin Xiu asked.

The skill cards in the Skills Pavilion were very rare. Even if there were duplicate cards, they were only available in the Skills Pavilion and they were not available outside.

This ‘Overlord Spear Art’ was no exception.

Needless to say, Luo Yue exchanged for it.

“The skills in there aren’t that good.” Luo Yue said lightly.

Lin Xiu was a little dumbfounded when he heard Luo Yue’s words.

If those students from the Sacred Region Academy heard what she said, they would probably beat her up.

These rare and unique skill cards were very precious in the eyes of the students of the Sacred Region Academy and Luo Yue seemed to look down on them.

“Thank you.” Lin Xiu looked at her and said.

“I just think you are too weak, it will make me feel embarrassed.” Luo Yue snorted coldly and replied.

At this moment, she didn’t look at Lin Xiu and went back up the stairs.
