1148 God Warrior, Full Blown Profound intent!

What happened!?

When the old man saw this scene, the expression in his eyes suddenly changed slightly.

This power was obviously unleashed by Lin Xiu.

Although he didn’t know how this monster appeared, it must be related to Lin Xiu.

This kid, why did he attack this beast?

The ancestor of the Bai family was a little confused.

But at this time, when he looked at Lin Xiu, who was dodging to the other side, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

It was obvious that something was wrong.

This kid’s power... has increased!?

And what shocked him even more was that Lin Xiu’s body now had a faint golden light glowing.

This guy... has made a breakthrough!

“Hahaha!”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help laughing out loud at this time.

Sure enough, just like what he thought, after killing the beast that he summoned with ‘Exotic Summoning’, he could also gain experience!

Although it was only a little experience, it was enough for Lin Xiu!

In his mind, there was a pleasant upgrade notification sound.

As soon as he upgraded, Lin Xiu could clearly feel it and an extremely comfortable feeling came from his whole body.

It’s like a ray of light bathing on his body.

This upgrade, like the previous upgrades, is immersed in ‘divine blessing’.

The system skills, at this time, have all been refreshed again!

Without the slightest hesitation, ‘Heavenly Array’ and ‘Fury’ were activated again.

“die!”

The old man clearly felt that something was wrong. At this time, he roared and rushed towards Lin Xiu.

Holding the golden long sword in his hand, he was about to split Lin Xiu in half!

Dang–

But at this very moment, Lin Xiu also held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and collided with the long sword he was holding.

A powerful force made the old man’s body step back a few steps!

This is impossible!

When the two were fighting just now, Lin Xiu was the one who stepped back.

But he didn’t expect that it would be his turn now.

He... really became a god warrior!?

Looking at Lin Xiu’s source strength, it also turned pale golden.

Pale golden source strength, divine power!

He is already at the God warrior level!

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly at this time, feeling the powerful force coming from his body, the Dark Edge spear he held in both hands, really shook the old man away with a sudden force.

And the moment he shook him away, he continued to hold the spear in his hand and attacked the old man! Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

The current Lin Xiu, both in speed and strength, has been greatly increased!

Dangdang-

This time, it was the old man’s turn to keep holding the golden long sword in his hand to resist Lin Xiu’s attacks.

With the blessing of the ‘Fury’ skill, Lin Xiu, who has reached the level of the god warrior, is now showing even more terrifying power.

The spear swung and a large amount of black energy material burst out from the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand.

He instantly transformed into a giant dragon and charged toward the old man!

Boom—

The power of this black giant dragon is countless times stronger than the previous one.

At this time, as the black giant rushed over, the old man’s eyes changed slightly.

After reaching the God warrior level, the skills released by Lin Xiu are extremely powerful!

At this time, as the force of the skill rushed past, the golden long sword in the old man’s hand burst out with dazzling golden light.

This sword will directly cut off this giant dragon!

boom–

As he swung the long sword in his hand, the black dragon was indeed cut in half by him!

But when he just split the black dragon in half, Lin Xiu had already rushed up!

Lin Xiu’s speed was very fast. At this time, he held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and attacked him frantically.

Dangdang-

The old man’s pupils shrank slightly and the long sword in his hand resisted Lin Xiu’s attack.

However, after Lin Xiu used ‘Profound Intent. Torrential storm of rose flowers’ at this time, the spear he pierced seemed to instantly turn into hundreds of thousands.

Crazily stabbing toward him.

And this time, the speed of the spear was obviously countless times stronger than before.

After the old man frantically waved the golden long sword in his hand to block it, his expression changed drastically.

Directly activated his own ‘Sphere’ to resist Lin Xiu’s attack.

Because he found that Lin Xiu’s spear was so fast that he couldn’t resist with a weapon at all.

bang bang bang-

At this time, countless spears stabbed at his ‘Sphere’ and a loud sound erupted.

While attacking the old man, Lin Xiu found out that after he reached level 70, he acquired new skills.

‘Full Blown Profound Intent’!

After using this skill, you can use all the skills you have learned to unlock the ultimate profound intent.

In other words, every skill can reach the state of maximum success!

‘Profound Intent: Clean sweep’!!!

With Lin Xiu’s roar, the Dark Edge spear he held in both hands suddenly had an incomparably powerful force poured into the spear.

Following Lin Xiu’s wave, an incomparably loud sound suddenly erupted and a powerful force charged directly toward the old man!

“‘Infinite Divine Screen’!!!”

Looking at this scene, the pupils in the old man’s eyes shrank slightly and with a roar, the source strength of his whole body burst out!

With the bursting out of the pale golden source strength, a huge energy barrier was immediately formed in front of them.

Boom—

But Lin Xiu’s skill power is really too terrifying. This skill power rushed over and directly destroyed his energy barrier!

pfft—

The old man’s body was directly shaken to the back and a mouthful of blood was spat out.

It’s really too terrifying.

“you...”

He opened his eyes wide, watching all this in disbelief.

How did Lin Xiu, whom he could easily kill just now, become a warrior of the same rank as himself at this moment!

Could it be that he was hiding his strength just now? No, not possible!

“Heaven Breaking… Strike!!!”

But at this time, Lin Xiu didn’t give him time to think. Following Lin Xiu’s loud roar, in the next moment, he continued with an incomparably powerful skill force, sweeping towards him!

Moreover, with the activation of the ‘Full Blown Profound Intent’ skill, this sky-shattering strike has also become ‘Profound Intent.Heaven Breaking Strike’!

The power displayed is much stronger than the ordinary ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’!

In addition, Lin Xiu had just now reached the level of a God warrior. This terrifying energy directly blew open a lot of holes in the surrounding space.

“No!!!”

The old man roared loudly, the source strength of his whole body erupted and he wanted to unfold a ‘Sphere’ again to resist!
