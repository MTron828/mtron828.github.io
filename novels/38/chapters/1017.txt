Chapter 1018: Black Energy

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu gathered his thoughts and the black spear instantly appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

Seeing how the man was about to attack him again with his claws, Lin Xiu gave a cold smile.

He started twisting and turning his black spear.

Clang clang clang – –

As the balck spear collided with the man’s black claw, the sound of it sounded like two metal sticks hitting each other.

Not only were those claws sharp, they were sturdy.

Lin Xiu wasn’t able to destroy his claws.

Plus, there was still black energy around his fingers. Within a blink of an eye, the black energy travelled along the black spear and headed towards Lin Xiu.

When he saw how the black energy was coming at him, Lin Xiu’s skin was rotting so quickly that it could be seen with the naked eyes.

But, Lin Xiu’s healing abilities were strong as well and the energy was only able to rot the outer layer of Lin Xiu’s skin. All of the wounds that were formed on Lin Xiu instantly healed on its own.

It was as if nothing had happened to Lin Xiu.

He suddenly realised that the man was quite shocked by what he saw.

How was this possible?!

“Now, it’s my turn.”

Lin Xiu gave a cold smile and there was a terrifying current that came from his black spear.

When the man’s claw touched Lin Xiu’s spear, all of the current immediately travelled onto his body.

“AHHHHHH!!!”

The intense pain caused the man to scream in vain.

“Go to hell!”

The man shrieked in rage.

All of the energy in his body turned into millions of black energy and were rushing to Lin Xiu!

There was a large amount of smoke that came from the ground beneath them as the black material touched the ground.

When he saw what happened, Lin Xiu raised his brows. He remembered that one of the crystal balls on his necklace was similar to it and started activating it.

When the black energy was about to reach Lin Xiu, all of them were completely absorbed into the crystal ball.

Everything completely disappeared.

The man was looking hideous at first. He was thinking that all of the energy that he had released would be enough to devour Lin Xiu.

But, when that particular scene happen, it shocked him.

All of the black energy that he had released had disappeared completely!

“This is impossible?!!!”

He roared as he moved both his hands as he continued moving the energy in his body. He released even more black energy and targeted it at Lin Xiu.

This energy of darkness was something that he had been proud of.

He had killed many warriors with this energy of his; even those who were much stronger than him.

But now, all of the energy of darkness had disappeared within a blink of an eye!

It was as if Lin Xiu had absorbed them!

On the other hand, Lin Xiu was shocked as well.

He never thought that the crystal balls of darkness would have such skills.

If that’s the case, does it mean that all the other crystal balls would be able to do the same? Would they be able to absorb all of the warrior skills of the other elements like fire, water, electricity and earth?

“Go to hell! You’re gonna die!!!”

The man was about to turn crazy.

He rushed towards Lin Xiu, ready to attack him.

Clang clang clang – –

As Lin Xiu continued moving his black spear, Lin Xiu could easily block all of his attacks.

No way! This can’t be happening!!

He couldn’t believe his eyes and was moving his claws frantically.

Boom – –

But, at the very next moment, Lin Xiu stopped blocking his attack. Instead, he pointed the black spear at him and threw his body into the distance.

When the back of his body hit the ground, he spat out a mouthful of blood.

He quickly got onto his feet and there was a bright sourcemark that appeared on his forehead. The man was about to release the energy from his source mark.

But, before he could do anything, there were dark blue flaming birds that were rushing towards him!

When the man saw the flaming birds, the man’s pupil shrank uncontrollably.

He didn’t even have the time to clean up the blood coming out of his mouth as he had to release his ‘sphere’.

Boom – –

The flaming birds came rushing from the sky one by one.

The flaming birds were like meteors falling from the sky and directly landed on the man’s ‘sphere’.

AHHHHH!!!

The man was still screaming in rage deep inside.

With the heat coming from the flames, it felt as if his entire body was about to melt.

His ‘sphere’ was useless. It wasn’t able to stop the heat from the flames.

Soon, he could see that his ‘sphere’ was slowly melting away.

As the flames started burning his body, he still couldn’t believe what was happening.

He was a sage warrior who could handle the energy of darkness. How did it….how was it that he was dying so easily?

His body was soon rotting away because of the flame.

The skeleton that he left behind was all toasted black.

It was obvious to them how scary the flames were.

Lin Xiu looked down at the fire crystal ball that was hanging on his neck. When he released the ‘awe of phoenix’ earlier, it felt as if the fire crystal ball had helped him as well.

It made his flames even more powerful than before.

Anda saw with his eyes how the man was easily defeated by Lin Xiu and he started feeling frightened.

He was aware of how powerful the warriors were but how did Lin Xiu defeat him so easily?

Boom – –

Just when he got distracted, Wang Qiang’s punch landed on his body.

His body was then thrown into the air before landing heavily on the ground because of the impact.

Pfft – –

Blood started coming out of his mouth. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“You’re a dead piece of meat!”

Anda crawled onto his feet and released the purple sourcemark on his forehead.

Crackling – –

At that very moment, there was a large amount of energy coming from the sourcemark. There were large lightning bolts that were headed towards Lin Xiu!

The source mark of electricity!

“Hmph!”

When Wang Qiang saw what Anda was trying to do, he sneered.

Then, a similar purple source mark appeared on Wang Qiang’s forehead.

But his mark seemed to be much darker than Anda’s mark.

Soon, there were terrifying lightning bolts that came out of Wang Qiang’s forehead!

Boom boom – –

Lightning bolts came out of both their sourcemark and collided with each other.

However, it was obvious that Wang Qiang’s lightning bolts were much stronger.

Soon, the currents released by Anda returned into his sourcemark.

Then, Wang Qiang’s lightning bolt completely covered Anda’s body.

“AHHHHHHH!!!”
