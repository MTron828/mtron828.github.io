Chapter 525: Along With The Wind

“On the left is the unicorn thunder cow herd – they live in groups and the unicorn thunder cow king is the top rank 8 evolved beast.”

“There is a psychedelic forest on the right, and even rank 8 warriors may not be able to resist the hallucinogenic pollen that spreads in that forest.”

A warrior said coldly at this time.

Hearing his words, these warriors all felt like they had a basin of cold water thrown at them.

The cracks on the ground were really terrifying. At this time, standing on the edge was like standing on the edge of a cliff.

According to what those people just said, could it be caused by the earthquake that happened that day?

Lin Xiu stretched out his hand and placed it in front, and he could feel that there seemed to be wind coming from under this terrifying crack.

Wind!?

Moreover, the wind was not directly rushing upwards, it seems to be blowing towards him.

Very weird.

The wind was quite strong. In this case, it was even more impossible to jump to the opposite side.

With this thought, Lin Xiu shook his head.

What should he do?

Just when Lin Xiu was at a loss, he clearly felt that the direction of the strong wind coming from below had changed again.

“Huh?” Lin Xiu was surprised at this time.

Why did it suddenly become a downwind?

The wind surging from below was blowing directly toward the front side, which was very weird.

Although he didn’t know how this happened, he could rely on the wind and sprint to leap over!

It’s just that he didn’t know how long this wind direction could last.

“Luo Yue.” Lin Xiu whispered to Luo Yue at this time.

Luo Yue also seemed to feel what happened to Lin Xiu, and stood on the edge with Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu told Luo Yue everything he had just discovered, and Luo Yue’s pretty brows also knitted.

After about half an hour, the two of them worked out a pattern. Every 30 seconds, there would be 5 seconds when the wind is blowing towards the front!

“Shall we go?” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue.

Luo Yue nodded.

There should be nothing wrong with this. Even if they were wrong, both himself and Luo Yue could use skills in the air and use the recoil force of their skills to return.

It should not be life-threatening.

“Brother, do you know how to go over?” At this moment a man stood beside Lin Xiu and said with a smile to Lin Xiu.

“I don’t know.” Lin Xiu shook his head.

Lin Xiu ignored him, and after taking many steps back with Luo Yue, he was about to sprint forward.

Seeing the movements of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, the man was stunned. He saw Lin Xiu and Luo Yue pointing at the edge, as if they had found something, but he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue would simply charge to the other side like that.

Isn’t this just courting death?

“They think life is too long.” The man sneered at this moment.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were now counting the time in their hearts.

“Three, two, one…!”

With the inner countdown over, at this moment, the two rushed to the front at the same time!

“This is crazy.” Seeing this scene, some warriors couldn’t help exclaiming.

From here to the other side, it was more than 60 meters away. Even a rank 6 warrior couldn’t jump over. What’s more, the wind coming from the rift valley below was a headwind coming in their direction – it would cause quite a big impact.

Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear had long been thrown directly to the opposite side.

And Luo Yue carried the long sword on her back and was not affected.

At this time, the two sprinted to the edge, then leaped!

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue had already calculated the time. The moment they took off, it was the five seconds when the wind changed direction.

The two of them were strong physically and they could jump a very long distance with a normal sprint. Coupled with the strong wind coming from below, the two seemed to fly out.

In a short moment, they managed to jump to the opposite side!

Bang–

Lin Xiu rolled forward and stood up quickly.

And Luo Yue, at this time, has also stood up.

“Phew, we really jumped over.” Lin Xiu picked up his Dark Edge Spear, and then said with a smile.

He looked at the opposite side, and the man who was talking to him was completely dumbfounded at this time, his eyes were wide open, with a look of disbelief.

“Byebye.” Lin Xiu waved to the other side and said.

“How did they get there!”

Some warriors also came to their senses and exclaimed.

But Lin Xiu didn’t care about those people. At this time, he and Luo Yue went straight ahead.

According to the map, if they keep going forward, they will reach the hinterland of Thunder Valley.

“Damn!!!”

Some warriors looked at the disappearing figures of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, and they hated them.

They had no way of jumping over but Luo Yue and Lin Xiu actually did it.

“Hng, what a pity.” At this moment, some people actually rode on top of some giant birds and then flew directly from here.

“The Royal Beast Sect.”

Some people whispered when they saw this scene.

In the current world, although most warriors aim to hunt and kill evolved beasts, there are also people who could peacefully coexist with evolved beasts and control these ferocious evolved beasts.

One of them was the people of the Royal Beast Sect.

In short, the rift valley had cut off a number of warriors and this was good news for Lin Xiu.

This area was different from the forest just now – it seemed as if you had reached a barren area suddenly.

Lin Xiu looked into the distance – there was still a long way to go until the trees appeared again.

Boom boom——

And it was already noon, and in the scorching sun, there was lightning from time to time in the sky.

This Thunder Valley was really weird.

Lin Xiu stretched out his hand enough to touch some of the lightning that had just been struck, but for Lin Xiu, these lightnings had no effect at all.

Click, click, click——

Just after the two walked a certain distance, Lin Xiu heard a strange noise.

“What is this?” Lin Xiu frowned when he heard the sound.

Luo Yue looked around, then pointed to the front.

Following Luo Yue’s fingers, Lin Xiu found that on the ground in front, it was starting to bulge, as if there was something surging out of the ground. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Boom–

Soon, as a dull sound rang, the protrusion seemed to explode!
