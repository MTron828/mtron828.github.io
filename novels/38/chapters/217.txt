Chapter 218: Defeat

Ouyang Hang rushed out of it at this time, looking very battered.

His hair smelled burnt and there were a lot of black marks on his cheeks.

He had a sinister expression as he held the silver spear and rushed directly to Lin Xiu!

There was a hint of surprise in Lin Xiu’s eyes. This person still had such a strong fighting power.

He was truly a peak rank 5 warrior.

“You have seriously provoked me!” Ouyang Hang’s eyes were so huge that they looked like they were about to fall out.

“This move was originally used to deal with Zhuo Qixing, the top student in the South Campus, but let’s try it on you now!”

He yelled and a dazzling gold light seemed to burst out from the silver spear in his hand!

“Profound intent· [King Kong Destruction]!

Profound intent!?

Lin Xiu was startled at this time, the pupils in his eyes constricted slightly.

Without hesitation, Lin Xiu clenched the Dark Edge spear tightly.

Under the explosion of a large amount of source strength, the Dark Edge spear seemed to be affected and made a clattering sound.

His move looked like a very destructive move formed by a large amount of source strength. If he wanted to fight against him, he had to use the same destructive move.

‘Adjudicate’ definitely cannot be used successfully, the only thing left was ‘Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall’!

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and leaped up with a sudden force!!!

The source strength in his body burst forth at this time!

At the same time, the ‘Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall’ skill seemed to have undergone slight changes as Lin Xiu absorbed the fire of the Red Lotus Fire and the rank 8 ice attribute Odd crystals.

It became even more terrifying.

“Go to hell!!!” Looking at Lin Xiu who leaped high in the air and was about to attack him, Ouyang Hang let out a roar and slashed over!

As soon as his spear thrust out, everything around him seemed to be covered by gold light. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The powerful skills used by the two people immediately collided together!

Boom——

At this time, the surrounding ground shook violently and a lot of dust flew due to the collision of these two huge forces.

Bang dang——

Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear and the silver spear in Ouyang Hang’s hand flew out.

They fell directly to the ground.

At the next moment, the two people’s figures also appeared from the smoke.

Pfff——

Lin Xiu retreated a few steps back and a stream of blood came out from his lips.

Lin Xiu wiped the blood from his lips, looked forward, and Ouyang Hang’s had taken a few steps back as well, his whole body hit against the city gate.

“Class monitor!” The people from Class 2 of the North Campus all looked at Ouyang Hang, wanting to step forward to help him.

Ouyang Hang waved his hand, looking at Lin Xiu over there with a look of disbelief in his eyes.

This was the gold profound intent skill, how could it be comparable to an ordinary gold skill!?

And his chest was very tight at this time. In the next moment, there was a sweetness in his throat as he spurted out a mouthful of blood directly.

He vomited more blood than Lin Xiu and seemed to be a lot more seriously injured than Lin Xiu.

“It seems that you really have some strength, huh.” Ouyang Hang stared at Lin Xiu and said.

On the other side, the battle between Luo Yue and Tian Zixia was still ongoing, and Luo Yue had gradually gained the upper hand!

Tian Zixia obviously felt a little tired. Luo Yue’s swordsmanship was really too strong, even when she was not in her best condition.

“Go and help her!” Ouyang Hang’s gaze changed when he saw this scene. At the same time, he rushed to Lin Xiu’s side with his bare hands!

The three looked at each other and rushed towards Luo Yue!

Lin Xiu saw Ouyang Hang charging over and scoffed. His body moved and he didn’t dodge as he charged over as well.

Bang bang bang——

When the two collided together, they fought like crazy!

This time, neither of them picked up the spears on the ground and fought with bare hands instead.

Ouyang Hang’s close combat ability was also very strong, he was especially good with his legwork.

He kicked Lin Xiu’s waist and it brought about a loud sound.

“‘Divine Wind Kick’!!!” Lin Xiu didn’t avoid it and kicked too!

A strong wind seemed to spread across his entire leg. As the legs of the two collided, Ouyang Hang retreated several steps back in an instant.

How could it be! He managed to develop his strong skills only after rigorous training since he was a child.

In his eyes, he only regarded Zhuo Qixing, the number one in the South Campus, as his opponent, but how could Lin Xiu’s strength be so terrifying?

And Lin Xiu was merely a student from Class 10 of the South Campus. If others found out that he was defeated by a student from Class 10 of the South Campus, he would be a laughing stock!

“Gold skill- ‘Sand Wall Fist’!!!” Ouyang Hang gritted his teeth with blood seeping from them.

As soon as he yelled, his fist was covered with a layer of sand. The entire fist became extremely stiff and he attacked Lin Xiu directly!

“Watch how I’m going to beat you into fool!” Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide, gritted his teeth, and threw a punch!

‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’!!!

Boom——

When the two fists collided, Lin Xiu felt that his hand was harder than a steel plate. The huge impact made Lin Xiu feel that his bones were about to shatter.

Ouyang Hang felt even more unbearable. His whole body was filled with electricity and there were bursts of cracking sounds like fried beans from the bones in his hand.

Being electrocuted by the strong electric current, his body was trembling constantly.

Soon, a little bit of white foam came out.

His eyes widened as he fell to the ground.

“Dam…damn…” His body seemed to be paralyzed, shaking constantly, but he couldn’t move.

White foam flowed down his lips and it was disgusting.

“Go to hell!” Lin Xiu’s eyes were full of murderous intent. He looked at Ouyang Hang on the ground, raised his right foot, and stepped on his head!

“Stop it!!!”

Just at this very moment, there was a voice from behind.

Lin Xiu turned around and saw that the few people in Class 2 of the North Campus had put their long swords on Luo Yue’s neck!

Obviously, with Luo Yue’s current state, one person against four people was simply impossible.

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened when he saw this scene.

He had been fighting with Ouyang Hang just now and didn’t notice what was happening behind.

Seeing this, Lin Xiu’s eyes turned cold.

“Let her go!”
