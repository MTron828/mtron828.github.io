1454 One-sided massacre

The phantom of Zhu Long appeared beside Lin Xiu at this time.

At this time, Zhu Long’s eyes were full of disbelief.

He really didn’t expect that Lin Xiu absorbed the power of Flame of Chaos!

“I need your strength now.”

Lin Xiu spoke lightly with an unquestionable expression.

“Hng!”

At this moment, Zhu Long snorted coldly and the phantom disappeared again.

At this moment, raising his eyes to the sky, he could clearly see the figures of many god warriors.

These God warriors all surrounded Lin Xiu.

“It’s this kid who killed our Tianshen Pavilion!”

One of the men stared at Lin Xiu below, his eyes full of viciousness.

Lin Xiu ignored the words of these people.

At this moment, a black pattern appeared on his forehead.

Black source mark!

Following Lin Xiu’s thoughts, at this moment, matrixes appeared instantly.

Luo Huatian’s body was directly covered in it.

In an instant, more than a dozen layers of matrix covered them!

“It’s safe here.”

Seeing Luo Huatian’s shocked expression, Lin Xiu said immediately.

“kill him!”

At this moment, the god warriors in the sky also said angrily.

All of a sudden, terrifying skills rushed downward!

clank clank——

The golden light emitted by the Dark Edge spear in his hand became more and more dazzling at this moment.

And at this moment, it trembled slightly.

Obviously, this kind of trembling happened because of the extremely strong force transmitted over it!

The power of the Tool Spirit has been revealed!

At this moment, the corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up.

This Zhu Long is really willing to lend his own strength to Lin Xiu now.

At this time, after absorbing the Flame of Chaos, he was already extremely powerful.

Now that the Dark Edge spear has the power of a Tool spirit, the entire spear was filled with incomparably terrifying power!

Boom, boom, boom——

At this time, the attacks of the surrounding God warriors were all blocked by Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

Those seemingly terrifying skill powers didn’t have any influence on Lin Xiu at all!

And at this moment, both hands held the Dark Edge spear in their hands.

With a thought, golden flames burst out from his Dark Edge spear.

Because of the power of the weapon spirit, the Flame of Chaos that burst out from the Dark Edge spear became even more powerful.

go! ! !

‘Profound Intent·Fire Refining Starlit Sky’!!!

As Lin Xiu pointed the Dark Edge spear in his hand toward the sky, these Flame of Chaos burst out along the Dark Edge spear directly toward the sky!

At this moment, the entire sky is filled with the flames of chaos!

These God warriors felt extremely hot at this moment.

It was as if he wanted to burn their entire body.

“This… what kind of flame is this?!”

At this moment, some warriors who also used the power of the fire attribute were shocked.

Because they all clearly felt it. With their very strong flame resistance, their bodies felt extremely hot.

And at the next moment, there were also a large number of flame balls in the sky, which directly charged toward them!

“run!!!”

Some god warriors clearly sensed the horror of these flames and they also let out a low growl at this time.

But these flame balls are really too many, too dense.

Most of the God warriors have no way to dodge them!

Boom, boom, boom——

Some God warriors spread out their ‘Spheres’ in an instant, trying to forcibly resist them.

But as the flames hit their bodies, their ‘Spheres’ melted away.

His body was instantly surrounded by Flame of Chaos.

In the next moment, their flesh and blood melted away.

Even the bones were burned to slag.

Some luckily dodged, but at this time they were terrified.

What kind of flame is this!

The “Sphere” of the God warrior can be burned!

And the body of the God warrior melted directly.

Any warrior who becomes a god warrior has been thoroughly tempered!

But such a strong body can’t resist those terrifying flames at all.

“Flame of Chaos… I know, this is Flame of Chaos!”

Some warriors came to their senses at this time and their eyes were full of panic.

“impossible…”

Although most of the God warriors couldn’t believe it, their hearts sank when they felt those terrifying flames.

It’s really very possible, it’s Flame of Chaos!

“We are from Tianshen Pavilion, you…”

One of the warriors flew in front of Lin Xiu and when he was about to use the name of Tianshen Pavilion to say something to Lin Xiu, the spear pierced his head directly.

“Since you’re here, don’t leave all of them.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly at this moment.

With a thought, a large number of matrices are continuously released around,

These matrices directly surrounded the surrounding space!

Some God warriors sensed that the situation was wrong and wanted to escape, but they were completely blocked by these matrices.

“Damn it!” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

They waved the weapons in their hands, trying to blow up these matrices.

But they discovered that these matrices are extremely hard and there is no way to blow them up for a while!

At this time, Lin Xiu had already started waving the Dark Edge spear in his hand!

Following the dancing of the golden Dark Edge spear, huge flaming birds were released in an instant!

These flaming birds were constantly flitting across this space at this time.

The surrounding warriors were struck by those flaming birds and their entire bodies were instantly burned.

They couldn’t even make a sound of wailing and screaming and their entire bodies were burned off immediately.

This is the power of the Flame of Chaos!

When absorbing the Flame of Chaos, the system’s experience progress bar did not change in any way.

But at this time, Lin Xiu could clearly see that his experience progress bar was constantly rising.

Now, it has risen to 81%!

As long as he upgrades to level 75, his strength should be able to reach the strongest level.

“Who dares to kill my people from Tianshen Pavilion!!!”

Just as Lin Xiu continued to kill a large number of God warriors, there was an extremely loud sound in the sky.

It’s like thunder rolling in the sky.

Looking up to the sky, Lin Xiu could see the figures of the four men.

Four warriors at the level of god kings!!!

“All the god kings of the Tianshen Pavilion are here!?”

Luo Huatian, who was under the protection of those matrices, saw this scene with shock in his eyes.

Back then, it was the five great god kings who joined forces to seal the dark planet.

Because of the news of the death of Zhang Tiansheng who was guarding the dark planet here, now they broke the seal again and came here.

“Master! Help me!!!”
