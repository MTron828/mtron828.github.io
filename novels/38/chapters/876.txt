Chapter 877: Hijack

Hearing Qian Feng’s words, the rest of the people looked at Lin Xiu.

There was a look of vigilance in their eyes.

Under Qian Feng’s deliberate guidance, Zhao Xiaoqing was also a little hesitant.

“Speak, what are you trying to do by approaching us on purpose!?”

Qian Feng stared at Lin Xiu and continued to speak coldly.

“Dumba**.”

Lin Xiu was a little speechless and said in a cold voice.

“You dare to scold me!?”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Qian Feng’s eyes widened and a look of incomparable anger appeared on his face.

The next moment, he would wave his fist and attack Lin Xiu.

“Qian Feng, stop!”

When Zhao Xiaoqing saw this scene, the expression in his eyes suddenly changed and he said aloud.

But Qian Feng has ignored Zhao Xiaoqing’s words.

Now he has only one thought, which is to beat the man in front of him to the ground.

He really didn’t like Lin Xiu.

boom–

But just when his fist was about to hit Lin Xiu’s head, Lin Xiu moved.

He reached out and clenched his fist.

The expression in Qian Feng’s eyes changed slightly. He found that the punch he threw was actually stopped.

He couldn’t move at all!

“Courting death!!!”

Qian Feng couldn’t withdraw his fist at all, so he suddenly became furious.

The left hand clenched into a fist and there was incomparably terrifying source energy gathered in the fist.

The next moment, a fiery red flame erupted from the entire fist.

Martial arts power!

This seemingly powerful fist, in the next moment, directly charged toward Lin Xiu.

boom–

But the same thing happened again.

His fist was pinched by Lin Xiu’s left hand again.

The terrifying flame on the fist also disappeared at this moment.

This... how is this possible!

Qian Feng’s eyes were full of disbelief.

Why, why was his punch so easily caught by this kid!? Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Damn boy, let me go!!!”

After failing to attack twice in a row, he yelled in a bit of anger this time.

But as soon as he roared, Lin Xiu raised his foot and kicked his body out.

boom–

With a loud noise, the man’s body directly hit the trees behind him.

The thick branches were directly broken.

pfft—

Qian Feng fell to the ground, and vomited out a mouthful of blood, his eyes widened and in the next moment, he fainted.

“What is the meaning of this!”

The other warriors also came up at this time, looking at him with rage on their faces.

“Why, he is only allowed to attack me, can’t I fight back?”

Lin Xiu looked at these people and said with a sneer.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the expressions of these people changed slightly.

It was true that Qian Feng attacked him first, but after all, Qian Feng was part of them, so of course they had to fight against the outsider.

“Mr. Lin, I’m sorry, Qian Feng was reckless.”

Zhao Xiaoqing said apologetically to Lin Xiu at this time.

“Why don’t you follow us back to Aoshuang City...”

“no need.”

Lin Xiu said lightly, then turned around and left.

Zhao Xiaoqing looked at Lin Xiu’s leaving back and wanted to say something, but she didn’t.

And she has a faint feeling of loss.

“Miss Zhao, this guy is definitely not a good person. It is very likely that he was here on purpose and wanted to take the opportunity to get near us.” One of the warriors said suddenly after watching Lin Xiu leave.

“Yeah, I don’t know where this guy came from, Miss Zhao, should we kill him...”

“...”

“Enough!” Zhao Xiaoqing’s face turned cold when she heard the words of these people.

When these people saw Zhao Xiaoqing lose her temper, they immediately shut their mouths.

At this time, Lin Xiu had already walked towards the front.

Since they came from Aoshuang City, he just had to follow the path they came from.

zizizi——

He pressed the watch on his arm and a subtle electric sound suddenly came out.

The projection device on the watch quickly projected a system screen.

But the projection flickered and seemed a little unstable.

“It seems that it was damaged from that time...”

Lin Xiu said to himself a little helplessly.

This watch should have been damaged when the head of the God Hunters was fighting with him.

The map function also seems to be unable to locate due to a problem with the navigation network.

A little helpless, Lin Xiu could only turn off the smartwatch projection and continue walking to the other side.

Taking out the map he obtained on Marqi Planet and comparing it, Lin Xiu was sure that the path he took was correct.

After some time, it was nightfall.

Standing on a barren high place and looking at the distance, Lin Xiu could clearly see that there was a ray of light there.

There is no doubt that the place in the distance is the city.

“Here, it should be Aoshuang City, right?”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up involuntarily.

According to the signs on the map, Aoshuang City has a cultivation place that many warriors go to – the Tower of Cultivation.

It is said that there is a special device there that gathers all the energy of the universe.

It makes the cosmic energy in the air very rich.

Therefore, the warriors who practice here will get twice the result with half the effort.

Time to set off.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath. There are many trees on this Namir planet and breathing is also very comfortable.

Although he walked for a day, at the level of Lin Xiu, he didn’t feel any fatigue.

But just as Lin Xiu walked down there, he heard a rustling sound.

The voice should be very subtle, but Lin Xiu’s hearing was very good, so he could hear it clearly.

After a little hesitation, Lin Xiu, who had just come down from the mountain peak, hid behind a huge boulder at the back.

“This thing is really heavy…”

At the same time, a panting voice could be heard.

Looking in the direction of the source of the sound, he saw some men in black uniforms carrying the corpse of a huge evolved beast.

Its body was dark blue, with two big curved fangs, isn’t it the mutant flame pig that was kicked to death by him?

“Be honest with me, otherwise, you will be killed!”

On the other side, Zhao Xiaoqing and others were all held by those warriors with knives around their necks.

Um? Been kidnapped?

Lin Xiu couldn’t help frowning when he saw this scene.

“Let go of us! We are members of the Zhao family in Aoshuang City, do you want to die!!!”

Qian Feng was originally angry because he was injured by Lin Xiu today, but when he looked at these people, he immediately shouted angrily.
