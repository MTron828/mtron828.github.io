“Courting death.”

The man just now laughed when he saw Lin Xiu walking directly into the Flame of Chaos.

Some god warriors around saw Lin Xiu walk in and sneered.

Boom——

At this time, as Lin Xiu’s body just entered the sea of fire, those terrifying Flame of Chaos instantly covered Lin Xiu’s entire body.

The temperature of that Flame of Chaos was too high.

Even though Lin Xiu has extremely high resistance to flames.

At this time, he felt an intense burning sensation.

Boom——

The clothes were burnt clean at this moment.

“He’s about to die…”

The dark-skinned man just now sneered when he saw this scene.

But at the next moment, something that shocked him happened.

Lin Xiu, who was bathed in the sea of flames, seemed to be fine!

Except that the clothes on his body were burned, there was no obvious injury on Lin Xiu’s body.

At this time, Lin Xiu continued to walk forward.

“This… this is impossible!”

The dark-skinned man, watching this scene, suddenly opened his eyes wide.

How could the Flame of Chaos burn his clothes off, but did not cause any harm to his body!

“Could it be that the fire has weakened?”

The dark-skinned man thought for a while, and the look in his eyes changed slightly.

In the next moment, he also rushed in directly!

Boom—— Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“ah!!!”

He let out a howl.

At this moment, the whole person wanted to rush out, but at this moment, it was already too late.

The terrifying Flame of Chaos had already burned his body until only a skeleton remained.

At this moment, that bone was also burned at a speed visible to the naked eye until there was not even a slag left.

The surrounding warriors who were still eager to try all trembled at this moment, terrified, really terrified.

Sure enough, the fire of chaos is still the fire of chaos.

At this time, everyone looked toward Lin Xiu, and saw that Lin Xiu had already started to walk toward the front slowly.

“This kid, is he going to find the source fire of the Flame of Chaos…”

Seeing this scene, some God warriors muttered to themselves.

At this time, Lin Xiu continued to walk to the front.

The peripheral flames of this Flame of Chaos are so terrifying.

Lin Xiu, who has such a strong flame resistance, felt severe pain all over his body at this time.

Taking a closer look, you can clearly see that the skin on the surface of Lin Xiu’s body is slowly becoming blackened.

But this still doesn’t threaten Lin Xiu’s life.

He continued to walk forward.

Only by getting in touch with the source fire of the Flame of Chaos can one absorb the Flame of Chaos and turn it into one’s own use.

Otherwise, the power of the Flame of Chaos here is not pure enough.

It’s useless to absorb it.

When Lin Xiu continued to walk towards the center of the Flame of Chaos, Luo Yue on the dark planet also looked at the black river in front of her.

“found it.”

She searched for a long time, and finally identified the source of the Black River.

“Are you sure you want to absorb the power of the Black River?”

Luo Huatian’s figure also appeared beside Luo Yue.

“En.”

“Those people should be here soon.”

Luo Yue nodded slightly, and said aloud at this time.

All the people stationed here in the Tianshen Pavilion were killed, and the Tianshen Pavilion, which should be in the God warrior Realm, is about to learn that the people here have disappeared.

In the near future, they would probably unseal the dark planet and send people over.

At that time, the situation will become even more dangerous.

The people in Tianbei City also clearly sensed it, and they are also preparing to move to other areas at this time.

Once the people from Tianshen Pavilion come again, all the people in Tianbei City will die.

“Then…be careful.”

After a little hesitation, Luo Huatian also spoke.

He knew Luo Yue’s character and she wouldn’t change her mind easily.

As an older brother, there was nothing he could do.

And if Luo Yue really absorbed the power of the Black River, her overall strength should also be greatly improved!

After all, the water of the Black River is something that even god kings are afraid of.

“En.”

Luo Yue didn’t say anything either. Standing in a high place here, looking at the water of the Black River below, at the next moment, she jumped straight down.

Under Luo Huatian’s gaze, Luo Yue jumped directly into the water of the Black River below!

The whole person disappeared instantly at this moment.

This black river water is very strange.

Luo Yue jumped inside without even a trace of spash.

“Hope she’s okay.”

Luo Huatian looked at this scene with complex expressions in his eyes.

The risk was still great.

But if she really succeeds, then her strength will be improved to a higher level!

Is she not there yet…

At the same time, Lin Xiu was already walking in the Flame of Chaos.

Following Lin Xiu’s body, he continued to walk forward.

At this moment, Lin Xiu could feel that the Flame of Chaos became purer and purer.

This incomparably pure Flame of Chaos had a great impact on his body.

The skin on Lin Xiu’s body was completely burned off.

The whole person turned into a man covered in blood.

The blood seemed to boil under the scorching of the Flame of Chaos.

It looked extremely terrifying.

The hair on the head has long since disappeared.

Although he was in severe pain, Lin Xiu, relying on his amazing willpower, forcibly held back at this time.

Continuing to walk to the front, this terrifying burning sensation seemed to melt the whole person.

horrible.

Is this the power of Flame of Chaos?

And at this time, Lin Xiu had already gone to the front.

But it seems that the original fire of the Flame of Chaos has not been reached yet.

No, I have to speed up my pace, I haven’t even touched the source fire and my body is almost burned!

As he walked towards the front, the flesh and blood on Lin Xiu’s body began to be burned and slowly disappeared.

My flesh and blood can no longer resist the scorching flames of chaos!

Golden bones also began to slowly appear at this time.

Although his body of flesh and blood was burned horribly.

But Lin Xiu’s golden bones were indestructible.

It could also withstand the scorching of this Flame of Chaos.

Finally, Lin Xiu saw a more intense and dazzling golden light.

The Flame of Chaos has appeared!

It is said that the first source fire was produced when the universe first began.

The true source fire of the Flame of Chaos was just ahead!
