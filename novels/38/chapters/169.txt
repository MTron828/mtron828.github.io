Chapter 170: Rubbish Skill?!

“It’s just that?” But right at this time, Lin Xiu turned and spoke up indifferently.

He felt nothing from the palm strike.

‘How is that possible!!!’

Zhao Huang’s eyes were filled with disbelief.

He had gone through electrocution training just to train in the gold skill – Silver thunderbolt palm. Even when he used the skill, he would feel the faint numb feeling in his body.

But why was Lin Xiu unaffected!!!

After training with Luo Yue and being struck by her electric shock resistance training, his body had been tempered to a terrifying degree.

Much less Zhao Huang’s electric shock, even a stronger shock would not affect Lin Xiu at all!

Lin Xiu suddenly heard a system notification.

“Does Master want to use Engulf?”

“Use!” Lin Xiu confirmed without hesitation.

But Lin Xiu did not feel the obvious absorption of lightning this time, and he watched as his experience bar moved extremely slowly.

It only grew so much!

‘Damn it!’

‘What a rubbish skill!’

Lin Xiu was blushing with shame. He regained himself and suddenly moved when he saw Zhao Huang attacking him.

“I detest people sneaking attacks the most.” Just as Lin Xiu finished his sentence, he retaliated with a fist! 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Zhao Huang’s reaction speed was also very fast and immediately blocked with both hands.

Bang-

But even with the successful defense, he felt immense pain from Lin Xiu’s punch.

As though the bones and flesh inside his body had exploded.

Rupturing Fist was a fatal fist skill that produced internal injuries!

Lin Xiu’s fist did not stop there as he unleashed a barrage of attacks!

The unbridled Zhao Huang was not able to resist and could only remain in a defensive position.

But even if he was able to resist against Rupturing fist, a technique that was capable of breaking through the defense, his body was susceptible to internal injuries.

“Is this enough?” Right at this moment as Lin Xiu was about to launch a fist to finish him, he realized that his fist had been held.

The person was extremely strong and prevented Lin Xiu from resisting even an inch.

“Tea…teacher!!!” Zhao Huang saw the person standing in front of him and cried out in joy.

He was truly afraid of Lin Xiu and did not expect that someone from Class 10 was actually so powerful!

Lin Xiu then saw the figure in front of him.

He was a middle-aged man.

Lin Xiu frowned, all the teachers in Sacred Region Academy were powerful and he had no way of finishing up.

“Apologies.” The middle-aged man chuckled at Lin Xiu and released his hold before turning to Zhao Huang.

“Bring them to the infirmary.”

“Yes yes yes!” Zhao Huang quickly nodded and brought the people that were beaten by Lin Xiu to a pulp away.

All the spectators started to disperse.

“Thank you, class monitor.” Li Ping and the others came up and thanked Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu had helped them dispel the anger in them. This made them feel extremely happy.

They became even more respectful to their class monitor.

“What happened here?” Lin Xiu asked curiously.

It was a hatred uncalled for, they should not have done so just because they were from Class 10, right?

“We are unsure of this as well, we merely wanted to go to the exchange center but encountered the. They blocked our path right away.” Li Ping and the others were depressed, they were beaten up for no reason at all.

At the same time, Zhao Huang and the injured boys were walking alongside their teacher towards the infirmary.

“Who made you guys do this.” The middle-aged man looked at Zhao Huang and asked indifferently.

“I…” Zhao Huang looked at his teacher in the eyes that seemed to be able to see through all his secrets, causing him to tremble.

“I did not like their looks.” Zhao Huang gritted his teeth and said.

The middle-aged man shook his head and replied, “Don’t be a tool for others.”

“The young man you just fought against is called Lin Xiu, he is the first on the freshmen ranking in the Tower of Tournament.”

“He is Lin Xiu!?” Zhao Huang’s eyes changed.

He knew about the freshman called Lin Xiu that charged to the 21st floor and even pressured Zhuo Qixing.

Who knew it would turn out to be the young man he just fought.

“It’s the freshmen assembly tomorrow. Remember, you are all from Class 3. If you guys can’t even beat Class 10 in terms of your score, be prepared to accept the devilish training.” The middle-aged man’s eyes turned cold.

Zhao Huang and the others heaved a sigh of relief when their teacher left. But upon recalling the ‘devilish training’ raised by their teacher, they trembled.

Zhao Huang had heard of Sacred Region Academy’s strictness and was not held responsible for deaths during training. If they had to undergo the devilish training, who knew if they would die or not.

“Damn that Luo Xiaoqi! He dared to trick me!” Zhao Huang gritted his teeth.

Luo Xiaoqi was the young man by Zhuo Qixing’s side. If not for his instigation, nothing would have happened.

Lin Xiu headed towards the exchange center.

“Oh? Little Brother, you’re here again?” The old man that he met last time had a deep impression of Lin Xiu.

After all, Lin Xiu was a freshman that brought precious goods over to exchange for over thousands of points for his first time.

“What do you wish to sell today?” The old man smiled and asked.

“I want skill cards.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

“Oh? What type?”

“Spear, fist, leg skills, all gold skill cards.” Lin Xiu said.

The old man nodded his head and tapped on the keyboard. A large screen immediately appeared on the table before him with many skill cards projected in it.

“Take a look and see what suits you.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head, there were many skill cards with the number of points indicated beneath them.

There were cheap skill cards, but all of them cost 5000 points at the very least.

Lin Xiu was left with around 20 thousand skill points after training in the gravity room for the past few days.

He did not like the spear skills provided and felt that they were unsuitable for him.

As for the fist skills…

As Lin Xiu flipped the screen, a skill card captured his attention.

“Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist!?”
