Chapter 274: Absorbing The Flame

“Haha.” When Lin Xiu heard Qiu Li’s words at this time, he was taken aback and couldn’t help laughing.

Qian Lin’s face suddenly reddened.

At this moment, Guo Ling heard Lin Xiu’s laughter and turned around and glared at Lin Xiu sternly.

“Ahem, I just think this ****, no, this Giant Black Rock Beast’s head looks a bit like the head of a tortoise.” Lin Xiu said a little embarrassingly.

Taking a closer look, except for the Giant Black Rock Beast’s back, its head and limbs were indeed similar to those of a tortoise.

Roar–

Just then, this Giant Black Rock Beast’s head suddenly stretched out and it opened its mouth, revealing a set of white fangs.

As it roared, the surrounding ground seemed to shake more severely and the wind was raging.

The lighting equipment placed on the ground had also fallen at this time.

“Guo Ling!” Chen Jin looked towards Guo Ling and suddenly shouted.

“Kill!” Guo Ling nodded and held the long sword towards the Giant Black Rock Beast like he was going to kill it.

Seeing Guo Ling’s movements, the others didn’t retreat but rushed over there with their weapons at the same time.

They wanted to kill this rank 6 Black Rock Beast!

Lin Xiu looked at the seemingly sluggish Black Rock Beast and frowned slightly because he had just read the prompt of the Analytic Eye and knew that the reaction speed of this thing was very fast!

“Be careful.” Lin Xiu reminded from behind and then attacked with his Dark Edge spear!

Guo Ling and the others saw that its back were all black rocks and knew immediately that it was definitely hard to penetrate its back.

What they should target was its head and attack its eyes first!

But as soon as they rushed over, the Giant Black Rock Beast opened its mouth and a large amount of blue substance gathered.

What the hell is this!?

Qiu Li, who rushed over first, wanted to use his sword to chop off the Giant Black Rock Beast’s head, but when he saw this scene, he froze.

At the next moment, a large amount of substance that emitted blue light gathered in its mouth and a huge energy cluster was formed in an instant.

It roared all of a sudden and the energy cluster was aiming for Qiu Li!

Swish——

The speed of this energy cluster was very fast and was about to hit Qiu Li!

He’s doomed!

Qiu Li’s eyes constricted suddenly. At this moment, his body seemed to be restrained by some peculiar force. He couldn’t move for a while!

“Run!”

Just at this very moment, a voice suddenly came from behind.

Qiu Li felt that his body was being pulled to the other side.

The huge blue energy cluster brushed past Qiu Li’s body.

Boom——

The huge blue energy cluster smashed on the ground and there was another strong tremor.

The huge blue energy cluster created a deep pit on the ground.

Qiu Li stood on the edge and saw this scene with fear in his eyes.

Terrifying, this was really horrible, if he simply stood there, he would probably be annihilated by the blue energy cluster!

“Thanks…thank you.” Qiu Li looked to his side and saw Lin Xiu standing next to him.

He knew that Lin Xiu had just saved him.

At this time, he took a deep breath and said to Lin Xiu.

“Don’t worry about it.” Lin Xiu said plainly, looking at the back. As the beast’s attack didn’t kill Qiu Li just now, this Giant Black Rock Beast seemed furious and its forelimbs stretched out at this time. Raising its paw, he slapped wildly towards Guo Ling and the others! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Bang bang bang——

As its huge claws slapped on the ground, the whole ground shook.

Lin Xiu’s gaze changed slightly when he watched this scene. It was just like what the Analytic Eye stated – this thing looked like a huge rock but its limbs were indeed very fast.

Guo Ling and the others who were about to attack had quickly dodged at this moment.

Its head should be the vital part but they couldn’t get close at all.

With its huge claws constantly slapping the entire ground, the ground shook more and more severely.

Many cracks also appeared on the ground at this time.

“‘Awe of the phoenix’!!!” Lin Xiu saw this scene and held the Dark Edge spear with both hands as he brandished it violently.

A large number of flaming birds flew out one after another as Lin Xiu waved his Dark Edge spear.

They rushed towards the body of the Giant Black Rock Beast!

With the appearance of the flaming birds, the dark and strange trees around seemed to have felt the scorching temperature as they rooted out at this time and fled.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but widen his eyes when he saw this scene and his mouth opened slightly.

This Dark Forest was really weird; the dark trees seemed to have a consciousness.

Roar–

Looking at the flaming birds that rushed over, the Giant Black Rock Beast roared. At this moment, its black claws directly slapped the incoming flaming birds!

Not afraid of flames!?

Lin Xiu frowned slightly. It was really weird. In theory, things in this Dark Forest were afraid of flames, but this Giant Black Rock Beast didn’t seem to be afraid at all.

Following that, Lin Xiu felt that something even weirder had happened. As the Giant Black Rock Beast’s claws slapped the flaming birds that were about to hit its head, they were all scattered.

And when they scattered into a ball of flames, the Giant Black Rock beast’s mouth opened wide and sucked, gathering all the flames in its mouth.

“This… what’s going on?” Chen Jin and the others also opened their eyes wide.

The temperature of the flames released by Lin Xiu was so high that even they didn’t dare to deal with it directly.

But this Giant Black Rock Beast not only slapped the flaming birds away with its claws, but more terrifyingly, it absorbed the flames into its mouth and gathered them!

It seemed to be preparing for a more terrifying counter-attack!

“It doesn’t look like an ordinary rank 6 evolved beast.” Guo Ling also felt a surge of pressure as she frowned slightly and said.

As soon as she spoke, the flames that had been absorbed by the Giant Black Rock Beast gathered into a ball, and in the next moment, it spat the flames back to Lin Xiu and the others!
