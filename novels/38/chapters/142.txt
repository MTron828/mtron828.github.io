Chapter 143: Absorbing Odd Crystals Frantically

“You’re still thinking that I’m lying to you?” Lin Xiu waved his hands helplessly and said.

“Then you’re not…” Jiang Li, the huge guy, was at a loss for words.

The three had foolishly assumed Lin Xiu to be a high-rank warrior and had used some special means to appear young.

They had called Lin Xiu senior all the while and became embarrassed upon thinking about it.

After all, they were all around 20 years old and Lin Xiu looked younger than 18.

He was too young and they still found it hard to believe that he was younger than them.

“Let’s go.” Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu and spoke up indifferently.

“Lin Xiu, can we go with you?” Zhang Yin hesitated for a moment before speaking up.

They had encountered many Sacred Region Academy students here but a part of them harbored malicious intent.

“Sure.” Lin Xiu nodded, encountering them so many times was considered fate, adding to the fact that he had yet to fully recover his strength and Luo Yue was still injured. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

If they encountered danger, they would be able to help.

Zhang Yin and the others rejoiced when Lin Xiu agreed and started to follow Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

“Are we going to walk to the end of Path of Death?” Lin Xiu asked Luo Yue curiously.

“Yes.” Luo Yue replied indifferently.

She was a lady of few words as though her words were gold.

But Lin Xiu was surprised to find that she was no longer as cold as when they first met.

As they continued onwards, Lin Xiu discovered that the place was getting busy with more and more groups of young boys appearing.

“They all seem to be going to Sacred Region Academy.” Zhang Yin looked at the warriors and whispered.

They were all extremely wary, after all this place was not an easily accessible place that could be trifled with.

The forest was vast and even when they walked till night time, they were unable to see the end.

“Let’s rest here for tonight.” They walked to a small stream in the middle of the forest and Lin Xiu suggested to the group.

Luo Yue hesitated for a moment before agreeing.

Even if they continued on, they would not arrive at the destination. Instead, they could take a rest and take the opportunity to recover.

Zhang Yin and the others heaved a sigh of relief when they heard the suggestion.

Even as warriors, they felt slightly tired after walking for the entire day.

But Lin Xiu and Luo Yue did not even seem to pant or show any signs of fatigue. The two were truly monsters.

The sky gradually turned completely dark.

Everyone sat by the bonfire and caught a few fishes from the stream to barbeque.

“Do you know how many people Sacred Region Academy has enrolled?” Lin Xiu asked Zhang Yin while eating his fish.

“I’m not too sure about that.” Zhang Yin chuckled bitterly and shook his head.

“But only four of us in our academy were chosen, while another academy has five.”

So many?

Lin Xiu frowned, he was the only one from Xing Yao City. It meant to say that Xing Yao City was classified as a small city…

“It is said that there is a young man of the age of 18 from Sky Academy who is already a rank 5 warrior!” Zhang Yin clenched his fist and exclaimed excitedly.

The majority of people would never reach the realm of rank 5 in their entire lives, but an 18-year-old was already at that stage. He was truly a genius amongst geniuses!

“Zhuo Qixing.” Luo Yue barbequed her fish and added indifferently.

“You know him?” Lin Xiu blurted out subconsciously.

An 18-years-old to be a rank 5 warrior was truly too terrifying.

The strongest teacher in Xing Yao Academy was only rank 6 and he was an old man already.

“He is from the same academy as me.” Luo Yue nodded her head.

“You’re also from Sky Academy?” Zhang Yin looked at her in surprise.

Sky Academy was the most prestigious high school situated in Sky City. Not everyone could be enrolled in that academy.

Luo Yue did not answer Zhang Yin’s question and made him slightly awkward.

Over in the distance, a few pairs of eyes were looking at Lin Xiu’s group.

After all, a bonfire in the night was extremely eye-catching.

“That lass looks good…” Many looked at Luo Yue from a distance and felt itchy.

“Wait, she seems to be from the Luo family.” Another person rubbed his eyes and exclaimed in surprise.

“Luo family?”

“That’s right! Sky Academy rank 2 is a girl that is said to already be a rank 4 warrior!” The person inhaled in cold air and felt fortunate that he did not attack.

The title of Rank 4 Warrior made all of them exclaim in shock.

They no longer harbored any thoughts and quietly slipped away.

“Seems like they are gone.” Lin Xiu commented indifferently.

“En.” Luo Yue nodded and finally put down her sword that she had kept in her hand.

Zhang Yin and the others heard their conversation and were confused.

They turned to look around but did not discover any beasts or warriors.

After finishing their meal, Luo Yue sat beside Lin Xiu and started cultivating.

Lin Xiu was able to sense the flow of air around them as she cultivated, as though something was pouring into Luo Yue’s body.

What a powerful cultivation technique, Lin Xiu marveled inwardly.

Although he was improving at a very fast rate, his cultivation technique was mediocre.

As he watched her cultivate, Lin Xiu did not hesitate to take out all the odd crystals and placed them on his body.

Rollie saw Lin Xiu take all the odd crystals away and rolled on the floor unhappily.

“These are for you, I’m taking the rest to train.” Lin Xiu threw three rank 3 crystals to Rollie then kept the remaining and started absorbing the energy within them. He used his cultivation technique to draw all the energy within them into his body.

Opposite them, Zhang Yin and the others stared at him with their eyes wide open. There were at least 100-odd rank 3 Odd Crystals, but he was absorbing all of their energy to cultivate?

“So rich…” Jiang Li could not help but swallow a mouthful of saliva in envy.

All the disciples from rich families relied on absorbing energy from crystals to be able to distance themselves from ordinary cultivators.

But everything had a limit and absorbing too much energy from odd crystals would instead lead to negative effects on the body.

As Lin Xiu activated his cultivation technique, all the odd crystals emitted light that surged into his body!
