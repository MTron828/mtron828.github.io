Chapter 106: Black Tiger Bandits

“Hng, brother Lin Xiu, I heard you dropped out? Why didn’t you tell me!” Ye Shuang’er said, as if very dissatisfied with Lin Xiu’s departure without saying goodbye.

Lin Xiu looked at the projection in front of him and laughed bitterly as he looked at the lifelike figure of Ye Shuang’er, “I was afraid that you’d be worried.”

Indeed, Lin Xiu didn’t tell her at the time as he didn’t want her to worry, but he didn’t expect that she would somehow find out about him dropping out.

“Are you on the train now? Where are you going?” Ye Shuang’er noticed Lin Xiu’s surroundings at the moment and asked curiously.

“There’s a college asking me to go over and I’m going there now to report,” Lin Xiu smiled and said.

“Really?” When Ye Shuang’er heard that, she looked really happy.

At first, she was very anxious after she found out about Lin Xiu dropping out, after all, in this world, college was much more important than in the previous world.

So if Lin Xiu could attend college, it was of course a good thing. Hearing this news, Ye Shuang’er was elated.

“En, yes.” Lin Xiu smiled and said.

“What’s the name of your college? I’ll go over and play with you then!” Ye Shuang’er said cheerfully at this moment.

“Er…” Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment before he uttered, “Sacred Domain College.”

“Sacred Domain College? I don’t think I’ve heard of it before…” Ye Shuang’er thought for a second and indeed she hadn’t heard of this college.

“Hehe, don’t worry about it, I’ll definitely come and play with you then!”

“Oh my, my teacher is calling me, brother Lin Xiu, we’ll talk again next time! Mwah!” Ye Shuang’er gave a very lovely expression at this moment and the line was cut.

Watching Ye Shuang’er’s petite figure disappear in an instant, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but smile, then took a book from the bookshelf in his carriage to try to pass time. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Bang bang bang——

It was then that there were noises coming from the carriage door like someone was knocking outside.

Lin Xiu frowned – staff member?

After hesitating for a moment, Lin Xiu stood up and opened the door.

The second Lin Xiu opened the door, a cold light entered Lin Xiu’s eyes.

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted, then on one side of his body, a sharp dagger went across.

This was a man in a black and red tight suit with short hair and a murderous look.

“Who are you!?” Lin Xiu sneered, then waved his fist and hit his body!

Lin Xiu’s fist moved very swiftly; when he threw a punch, the glove in his hand gave off a scarlet glow.

As soon as the man’s gaze changed, he tried to hide, only to find that Lin Xiu’s right leg was over at his side!

The attack just now was just a distraction and the real attack was this kick.

‘Serial kick’!

The man flew a few feet away and hit the window at the back of the passage.

Lin Xiu then went out and found that there were already many people fighting, and many of the men in the same clothes as his attacker were attacking the warriors in the other carriages.

Lin Xiu frowned, what the hell is going on?

Before he could figure it out, the man who had just been knocked down had now stood up again.

In this narrow place, large weapons were useless, he simply could not wave them around, only those sharp daggers they used were the real lethal weapons in this case.

At this moment, the man suddenly continued to charge toward Lin Xiu. He sensed that Lin Xiu wasn’t very strong and was at best a rank 1 warrior.

So he was not too cautious at this point.

Watching him rush out again, Lin Xiu raised his brows then threw a punch again!

The man chuckled and the cold dagger in his hand stabbed Lin Xiu’s fist!

But as the sharp blade of the dagger reached Lin Xiu’s fist, his hand went numb and he simply couldn’t hold the dagger stably. Lin Xiu’s fist smashed into his arm like he was breaking a bamboo and the impact made the man feel like his entire arm exploded from the inside out!

In the next second, his arm was blown up into a mush!

“Ah!!!”

He looked incredulously at his right hand, which had turned into mush, and cried bitterly in sorrow.

Before he could react, Lin Xiu threw his fist out again without hesitation and it hit his chest!

The ‘Rupturing Fist’ coupled with ‘Tiger Strength Fist’ directly struck his chest, blowing up his internal organs.

After killing this man, Lin Xiu turned around and looked around. He saw that there was a warrior and a man in black and red clothing fighting, and Lin Xiu rushed over immediately, then his fist hit the middle-aged man’s head, blowing his head off directly.

“Are you all right?” Lin Xiu turned and asked the middle-aged man who was in plain clothes.

“I’m fine, thank you.” The middle-aged man heaved a sigh of relief and said gratefully.

At this moment, the train’s passageway was in chaos and those people who were weaker were already dead.

There were a lot of dead bodies in the whole passageway.

“Who the hell are these people?” Lin Xiu frowned and never expected that he would encounter this danger just from taking the train.

“Black Tiger Bandits – they specialize in robbery!” The middle-aged man said, gritting his teeth at this moment.

The weapon he used was a wide-back machete, which was difficult to wave around here, and he almost died if it had not been for Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu just killed two rank 2 warriors as he received 100,000 experience each, so it seemed that the Black Tiger Bandits were not very strong. They were rank 2 warriors but they were just ordinary rank 2 warriors, nothing to be fearful about!

Lin Xiu then walked to the other carriage and saw several members of the black tiger bandits at the corner, they were all dressed the same as the two men just now.

“Little bro, you better be careful, let me first…” The middle-aged man just now was standing behind Lin Xiu and just as he was about to step forward, Lin Xiu moved.

He was as fast as the wind!

He was so fast! The middle-aged man saw this scene and gasped in shock – is this a speed that a teenager could possess?

Those black tiger bandits were dumbfounded when they saw this scene as they grabbed their weapons and were about to attack Lin Xiu!

‘Fire Claws’!

Lin Xiu’s right hand suddenly stretched out, his fingers in the air seemed to emit sparks, and he turned sideways to avoid the black tiger bandit’s dagger attack in front, then grabbed the man’s chest with his right hand!
