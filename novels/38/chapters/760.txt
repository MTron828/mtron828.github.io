Chapter 761: Master and Apprentice System!? Boat Translation

This restoration fluid stimulates the cells to divide rapidly and repair the wound.

But at the same time, there would be severe pain.

This kind of pain was more painful than the wound opened by a weapon.

Liu Pan’s eyes widened and in the next moment, he fainted again.

“He should be fine.”

Lin Xiu took some white bandages, wrapped them around his wound and said aloud.

An Qi and Qian Lin both nodded.

What just happened is really terrifying.

“Are you sure you want to continue?”

Lin Xiu looked at Qian Lin and An Qi, then hesitated for a while and said aloud.

“Yes!”

The two looked at each other for a while, then nodded.

“I’ll say it first, it’s impossible for me to take care of you all the time.”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

After all, this time he went inside in order to see the Raging flame lion and if there was a chance to gain something at the same time.

“It’s fine.”

The two nodded at this time, as if they were not afraid at all.

This suddenly made Lin Xiu feel a little helpless.

“Okay, let’s go then. Do you know how to get there?”

Although he got the news from the burly man before, Lin Xiu still doesn’t know exactly how to go.

“Of course I know, but I have the title of a living map!”

An Qi said proudly at this time.

“An Qi is very familiar with most areas of Marqi planet, so it’s no problem.”

Qian Lin also nodded at this time and said aloud.

Lin Xiu carried Liu Pan on his back, then followed the direction An Qi said and continued to walk forward.

Because of the battle just now, Lin Xiu actually felt a little tired and his walking speed was a little slow at this time.

And while walking at this time, Lin Xiu’s perceptual ability was released to sense everything around him.

If there were still those ‘hunters’ appearing at this time, things would be a bit troublesome. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

However, he continued to walk forward for a long time, but he did not find any other warriors.

And Liu Pan also woke up at this time.

“Are you all right?”

Lin Xiu looked at Liu Pan who was standing beside him with a lot of white bandages on his body and said aloud.

“I’m okay, I’m okay, how could this little injury hurt me?”

Liu Pan said with a smile at this time.

Like a completely normal person.

“Hmph, I don’t know who was looking like a dead dog just now.”

At this time, An Qi couldn’t help saying aloud.

“Yo, Miss An Qi, do you care about me?”

At this time, the fat man said with a wretched smile.

“Bah!”

Seeing this wretched fat man looking at her, An Qi couldn’t help but glared at him fiercely.

“But I don’t like flat girls.”

Liu Pan shook his head at this time.

“Go to hell!!!”

Hearing Liu Pan’s words, An Qi was immediately triggered and she was about to slash at him with the giant sword in her hand!

“Help!”

Seeing their sparring, Lin Xiu was a little dumbfounded.

“Let’s rest here today.”

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then said aloud.

It’s getting dark now and they were going to reach soon.

In the current situation, Lin Xiu clearly felt a strange sense of oppression.

If they continue to move forward, there would probably be real danger.

Liu Pan and the others also nodded at this time.

Just like last night, everyone found a suitable area to rest and set up a fire.

But tonight, he didn’t need to drink those unpleasant nourishment liquid anymore.

And tonight, Qian Lin caught a few small evolved beasts nearby.

This evolved beast seemed edible.

“It’s quite fragrant.”

Lin Xiu felt extremely satisfied while eating these roasted meats.

Although those nourishment liquid can supplement a lot of human energy, they are really too unpleasant to drink.

And it smelled like the smell of a stinky drain.

“Indeed.”

Liu Pan also had enough to eat and drink at this time, then patted his belly and said.

“What’s wrong?”

But at this time, Lin Xiu found that An Qi and Qian Lin were staring at him, he was stunned for a moment, then said subconsciously.

“We…”

The two seemed a little hesitant.

“Aren’t you guys going to fall in love with Brother Lin and are asking for love?”

At this time, Liu Pan deliberately exclaimed in shock.

“Go away!”

When the two of them heard Liu Pan’s words, their faces flushed with anger and they almost pointed their weapons at Liu Pan.

But they have to admit that they do have a good impression of Lin Xiu.

After all, Lin Xiu was very handsome and strong.

He seemed to have a good character, otherwise, he wouldn’t have brought these burdens here.

“If you have something, just say it.”

Lin Xiu said aloud at this time.

“I want you to be our master.”

An Qi took a deep breath at this moment, then said aloud.

“Why?”

Hearing their words, Lin Xiu was stunned.

Originally, he thought they wanted to say something important, but he didn’t expect it to say that they wanted to be his apprentice.

This simply made Lin Xiu wonder whether to laugh or cry.

“We want to learn the spear.”

The two said in unison.

After the past two days, they found that Lin Xiu’s marksmanship was too powerful and the advantage of the spear was obvious.

It was even better than the giant sword used by An Qi and the long stick used by Qian Lin.

“Learning a spear is not that easy.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

As the saying goes, if you want to learn how to use a spear, you can’t do it overnight.

The main reason why he could learn so fast was because of the system.

Once the system is upgraded, his markmanship would also become stronger accordingly.

“We’ve learned it before.”

An Qi and Qian Lin spoke at the same time.

Their words made Lin Xiu a little stunned.

“You guys learned it before?”

Since they obviously used swords and long sticks, how could they use long spears?

“In our family, we have been taught various weapons since we were young, not to mention spears, even swords, rings and other weapons, we all know it, but we are not as proficient as the weapons we use now.”

An Qi said.

“Ding!”

At this moment, Lin Xiu clearly heard the system prompt.

It seemed as if there was a warning sound.

What happened?

Hearing this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but froze for a moment, then subconsciously entered the system interface in his mind.

“Ding! The apprenticeship system is activated!”

A apprenticeship system? There’s this kind of shit?

Lin Xiu subconsciously clicked on this item at this time, then an interface appeared.

On the apprenticeship system interface, ‘Apply’ is displayed and the two names ‘An Qi’ and ‘Qian Lin’ were displayed below and there were options to ‘Agree’ and ‘Reject’ next to it.
