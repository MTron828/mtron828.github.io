1436 Arriving at the Dark Planet

When they took a closer look around, there was a huge hole in the air.

There were several warriors that started running out of it!

All of them seemed to be carrying around terrifying auras.

God Kings!

All of those who had just appeared were undoubtedly God Kings!

Damn it!

Why were there so many God Kings here?!

Lin Xiu did not have the time to think. He grabbed Luo Yue’s hand and controlled the Spatial Cube.

Xiu – –

Then, there was a bright light that came from the cube.

“Let’s go!”

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue then walked into the light.

Hetian God King and the rest had already destroyed the arrays that were stopping them.

They were just about to reach Lin Xiu.

However, both their figures instantly disappeared.

“A Spatial Cube?”

One of the God Kings frowned as he asked.

“Xia Guang, are you able to track him?”

Huangfu Yuanshen asked one of the God Kings.

“Of course.”

The man known as Xia Guang could detect the energy that Lin Xiu had released into the Spatial Cube. Then, he swung his air in the air and opened a gap.

At the same time, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue then appeared on top of Lingxian City.

Before Lin Xiu could take a breath, he noticed a surge of energy in the air.

What was this?!

Lin Xiu, who clearly felt everything, suddenly had a bad feeling about it.

When he turned around, he saw that the space in the air being sliced opened.

Such terrifying aura!

Damn!

Lin Xiu had a horrible look on his face.

He never thought that these people would actually chase after them!

The Spatial Cube in his hands continued shining brightly.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue then continued running around with the help of the Spatial Cube.

However, wherever Lin Xiu went, these people were still able to track him.

What the hell!

Lin Xiu had a bad feeling about this.

‘Rage’ was already reaching its limit.

Plus, they didn’t have unlimited chances with the cube.

He also needed to infuse his own energy into the Spatial cube to be able to use it!

But, Lin Xiu didn’t have enough source energy left!

As Lin Xiu controlled it with his mind, the Spatial Cube then brought them to….. The Dark Planet!

“Hmm?”

Xia Guang frowned when he noticed that he couldn’t detect them anymore.

“What’s wrong?”

Hetian God King was caught surprised.

They were almost there! They could have caught Lin Xiu!

“I can’t break open the next one.”

Xia Guang shook his head.

Although he was powerful as well, he wasn’t able to go into the space where Lin Xiu was.

“Why not?!”

Huangfu Yuanshen did not understand why.

Huang Xia was the God King of the spatial element.

He had the utmost control over it.

But now, even he couldn’t chase after Lin Xiu?

Then, Lin Xiu must have entered a place that has been sealed.

“Dark Planet! It looks like they went to the Dark Planet!”

Xia Guang was still trying to detect the space where Lin Xiu had traveled to.

“The Dark Planet?”

The rest of the warriors frowned when they heard what was said.

“That place is completely sealed. It wouldn’t be that easy for us to open it.”

“Only the Spatial Cube would be able to open it! Damn!”

Hetian God King frowned.

“Damn! He must have that with him! We don’t have to hunt for him then. His body will be totally consumed by the cube!” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Huangfu Yuanshen suddenly looked excited as he thought about something interesting.

The rest of the God Kings nodded their heads as well.

“Earth! Let’s go to earth!”

Ling Tianxi suddenly spoke.

“Earth? Where’s there?”

Hetian God King frowned when he heard what Ling Tianxi said.

“Luo Yue is from that planet and so, that brat must be there as well.”

“They will definitely return to earth.”

Ling Tianxi continued explaining it to them.

“As long as we have control over it, they will then fall into our trap once they return.”

Huangfu Yuanshen laughed after hearing so.

“Good idea! We shall go to earth!”

“Xia Guang, please.”

Xia Guang then nodded his head.

“Earth, huh? Well, I would need to find the coordinates first.”

At the same time, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue suddenly appeared in a dark place.

“Ahem ahem…”

Both of them started coughing as soon as they arrived.

This was because there was smoke everywhere.

It smelled bad.

There were no moon or stars seen in the sky. Everything was pitch black.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu then lit up a few red flames.

This allowed them to finally see their surroundings.

When they looked around, they were surrounded by debris.

Luo Yue and himself were on a piece of huge rock.

“This is…”

“Dark Planet.”

Lin Xiu finally spoke.

“We’re on the Dark Planet?”

Luo Yue was surprised.

“En.”

Lin Xiu only thought of this place at the last second.

This was because he had once heard that the Dark Planet was a place that was sealed.

The only way that he got here was with the help of the Spatial Cube.

There must be a God King who had control over such strength.

Lin Xiu frowned as well when he thought of what Huangfu Yuanshen said earlier.

It felt like that man knew his secret.

Which means they knew about his system…

Was that even possible?!

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“Your brother, Luo Huatian is here as well?”

Lin Xiu asked out of curiosity.

“En. That’s what my father said.”

Luo Yue nodded his head and looked around. This place was so dark and there was an odd feeling here.

There were no plants on the ground as the soil itself was also black in color.

“Cough…”

Lin Xiu could immediately feel the aftermath of ‘Rage’.

He then fell onto the ground.

“What’s wrong?!”

Luo Yue bent down and looked at Lin Xiu.

“It’s nothing.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“I only need to take a rest.”

The energy here on the planet was rich but it feels messy.

They would only be able to absorb it after filtering it.

It didn’t affect Lin Xiu but Luo Yue’s face turned pale.

It was as if she had trouble getting used to this place.
