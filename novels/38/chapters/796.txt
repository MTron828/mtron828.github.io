Chapter 797: The True Power of a King Warrior!

Just as the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was about to stab him in the head, two huge lightning hands blocked him. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Boom—

The spear’s head stabbed the giant lightning hands and suddenly made a loud noise.

The lightning on the hands was instantly transmitted to Lin Xiu’s body.

The terrifying electric current made Lin Xiu feel a sharp pain all over his body.

“Humph!”

A grim smile appeared on Yan Yongxin’s face, and the giant lightning hand that resisted Lin Xiu’s attack was about to grab Lin Xiu’s body.

swoosh—

But in this state, Lin Xiu’s speed was still breakneck.

He backed away and dodged.

Just when Yan Yongxin wanted to continue attacking Lin Xiu, he found that Lin Xiu’s figure seemed to have suddenly disappeared again!

Where did he go!?

The expression in Yan Yongxin’s eyes changed, he looked to the other side, and found that Lin Xiu’s figure appeared on the other side at some point.

“You can’t escape!”

He thought that Lin Xiu wanted to run away, and at this time, with a roar, the pair of terrifying giant lightning hands directly bombarded Lin Xiu!

Something’s not right!

But at this moment, he seemed to feel something, and when he turned around suddenly, he found another Lin Xiu attacking with a Dark Edge spear from behind!

The pupils in Yan Yongxin’s eyes shrank slightly. At this moment, his hands moved quickly, his left hand grabbed the long spear that Lin Xiu had stabbed, and his right hand hit directly at Lin Xiu’s head!

“Just die!”

Yan Yongxin roared loudly, his right hand had a terrifying source strength and he was about to smash Lin Xiu’s head to pieces!

But at the moment when his fist hit Lin Xiu’s head, he seemed to feel something, and his face suddenly turned ugly.

The body moved directly.

Although he reacted very quickly, a long spear stabbed behind him.

Straight through his shoulders!

Almost!

Lin Xiu used ‘Mirror Image’ to confuse Yan Yongxin but Yan Yongxin’s perception ability was still too strong, and he came to his senses.

Otherwise, this stab would be enough to kill him!

The long spear pierced through his shoulder was pulled out directly, spattering with traces of blood.

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate, the spear he was holding continued to stab him frantically.

Whoosh whoosh—

Whooshing sounds broke through the air, resounding through the top of the mountain at this time.

Dang dang-

At this time, Yan Yongxin used the special material on his arm to continuously resist Lin Xiu’s attacks.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s offensive was getting more and more fierce.

And Yan Yongxin’s face became more and more ugly.

Because he had to deal with the scorching heat on the top of the mountain, what Yan Yongxin was wearing at this time was not his battle suit, but his cooling suit, so Lin Xiu’s shot just now was able to penetrate his body so easily.

And as he resisted Lin Xiu’s offensive, he also felt a little pain in his wound.

At this time, Lin Xiu continued to frantically swing his spear to attack.

The system skills have all been used up so he had to kill him in a short period of time.

But Lin Xiu found difficult was that no matter how he attacked, Yan Yongxin’s defense seemed to be impeccable, and there was no way to attack him again.

And at this time, Yan Yongxin’s face seemed to become more and more strange.

Without further hesitation, Lin Xiu’s forehead instantly had a source mark appearing.

At the moment when Yan Yongxin stepped back, the source mark power was instantly used!

swoosh—

When a square matrix was about to appear on his body, Yan Yongxin’s body disappeared!

Where is he?!

This time, it was Lin Xiu’s turn to have a shocked look in his eyes.

Because Yan Yongxin just disappeared from Lin Xiu’s field of vision!

No...here!

Looking up, Yan Yongxin had already appeared in the air.

Lin Xiu frowned, and the source mark power continued to be exhibited.

A large number of square matrices appeared in the sky.

But even in the air, Yan Yongxin’s reaction speed was very fast. Those square matrices could not cover any part of his body at all.

And he was suspended in the air, just like he was on land.

Is this the ‘Floating Technique’?

“Boy, enough is enough.”

Yan Yongxin roared with a ferocious expression in the air.

Lin Xiu thought that he wanted to release the domain forces, and was also going to use his own purification domain to cover his domain.

But at this moment, Yan Yongxin did not use the domain.

On his forehead, a purple pattern suddenly appeared.

The shape of the pattern is very complicated, and it looks different from the general pattern at all.

“This is... the power of a King warrior!”

Yan Yongxin roared in the air, and his hands formed a special and weird gesture.

boom boom boom —

At this moment, the whole sky seemed to have a huge thunderous sound.

Huge lightning flashes constantly in the sky.

A bolt of thick lightning struck the black gold rock on the top of the mountain.

These indestructible black gold rocks even had cracks on them.

This... this is the Source Mark power!?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu was also shocked.

Although Source mark power was very strong, Lin Xiu always thought it was just an ordinary skill.

But the blow that Yan Yongxin used at this time was really terrifying.

“Go to… helll!!!”

Yan Yongxin roared angrily at this time, and the purple source mark on his forehead also burst into light.

A lot of lightning burst out from the sky!

At this moment, it seemed that the entire sky was filled with purple lightning.

“Damn...”

The warriors who were mining stones below looked up at the sky, and the terrifying and huge purple lightning seemed to cover the entire mountaintop.

The purple light illuminated the lower part.

These people couldn’t help trembling when they saw such a terrifying scene.

And with their good eyesight, they also clearly saw a figure in the sky.

“King warrior... This is definitely the power that a King warrior has...”

At the same time, Lin Xiu, who was on the top of the mountain, had already felt the gust of wind around him, and the terrifying lightning came directly from the sky, all downward, and his body was impacted!

It’s too late to dodge now!

Damn it!

Lin Xiu’s face changed greatly, and he directly unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

“Go!!!”

Yan Yongxin waved his hands, and the terrifying lightning rushed straight down!
