Chapter 279: Which College Did You Graduate From?

“You…”

The other men’s expressions changed drastically when they saw this scene.

“Leave the Odd crystals behind and get lost.” Lin Xiu turned and held the Dark Edge spear with the spearhead dripping with blood, then pointed straight at them.

Those men who were fighting with Guo Ling and the others heard Lin Xiu’s cold words and their bodies couldn’t help but tremble.

The strength that Lin Xiu displayed just now was really too powerful.

Scar was considered above average among them but they didn’t expect that he would be killed by Lin Xiu so easily!

Such a scene really caused a great psychological impact on them.

The man who snatched the Odd crystal suddenly burst forth in strength as he sent Qiu Li flying and his eyes were fixed on Lin Xiu.

He did not dare to do anything for a while.

He weighed the pros and cons, then gritted his teeth, and threw the Odd crystal of the Giant Black Rock Beast toward Lin Xiu!

Bang–

Lin Xiu stretched out his left hand and caught the Odd crystal firmly in his hand.

“Let’s go!”

After he was done, he gritted his teeth and said aloud.

The strength that Lin Xiu displayed just now was really terrifying. That powerful skill killed Scar so easily and this wasn’t what they expected at all.

As soon as he spoke, the men who were fighting with Guo Ling and the others blocked their attacks and quickly gathered at the man’s side.

They watched Lin Xiu and the others warily with weapons in their hands while retreating.

They didn’t have any intention of fighting anymore, what Lin Xiu did just now was too horrifying.

Qiu Li wanted to chase after those people who wanted to retreat but Chen Jin stopped him. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Soon, these people disappeared into the dark.

Boom–

Seeing those people leave, Lin Xiu felt that his body suddenly lost all its strength at this time as he pushed the Dark Edge spear in his hand into the ground.

Just using the skill ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’ consumed a lot of Lin Xiu’s strength. At this moment, Lin Xiu felt that there was no strength left in his body.

Lin Xiu was a little out of breath. He was merely scaring them just now. If the fight continued, it would be really troublesome.

“Are you okay?”

Guo Ling came over and asked Lin Xiu.

“I’m fine.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

The ‘Cultivation Technique’ was activated automatically at this time and the source strength that had just been consumed was being replenished as Lin Xiu was continuously absorbing the energy in the air.

Lin Xiu could clearly sense that as his level continued to improve, the activation of ‘Cultivation Technique’ has become more and more natural. Even in this situation, the ‘Cultivation Technique’ could be easily used.

This Dark Forest was indeed weird. Lin Xiu could feel that the speed of absorbing the energy in the air has increased.

Qiu Li saw this scene and suddenly realized that Lin Xiu was just pretending just now.

At this moment, he couldn’t help but heave a sigh of relief. If the fight went on just now with Lin Xiu in this state, they would probably suffer a lot.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu took a deep breath. After he felt that his strength was somewhat restored, he said to Guo Ling and the rest.

“Leave now?”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Guo Ling was startled and subconsciously asked.

“En, if those people come back later, it might be a little troublesome.” Lin Xiu nodded.

He used a powerful force to kill that person instantly just now so they were shocked and scared.

When they come to their senses and realized that it was already an arrow at the if its flight, they would probably run back to cause trouble.

Qian Lin and the others thought about it and agreed as they nodded their heads.

“Alright, let’s go.”

Guo Ling nodded and said aloud, then picked up the lighting equipment that had not been damaged.

After all, it was already midnight and this was the Dark Forest – it was completely dark ahead and they couldn’t see anything at all.

It could be said that Lin Xiu practically killed the rank 6 evolved beast himself just now so this Odd crystal naturally belonged to Lin Xiu.

Guo Ling and the others were very sensible and did not bring up this matter.

“Lin Xiu, which school did you graduate from before?” Qiu Li walked beside Lin Xiu and suddenly asked.

He didn’t think much of Lin Xiu, a rank 5 warrior at first, but after these two days, Lin Xiu’s strength had really shocked him.

He was merely a rank 5 warrior but the strength he displayed was already stronger than a rank 6 warrior like them.

If it weren’t for the fact that Lin Xiu didn’t know how to use ‘sphere’, they would have thought that Lin Xiu was intentionally hiding the fact that he was a rank 6 warrior.

“Graduate? I didn’t graduate.” Lin Xiu was startled and said a casual smile.

Indeed, he was expelled from the academy.

With this thought, an iciness appeared in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

“You didn’t graduate?” Qiu Li was taken aback when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

Lin Xiu didn’t say much, but smiled and said, “I was from Xing Yao Academy previously.”

“I haven’t heard of Xing Yao Academy before…” Qiu Li thought carefully about the famous schools but this academy didn’t ring a bell.

“It’s just a small academy.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

He was telling the truth, but Qiu Li really didn’t believe it. He felt that Lin Xiu had shown such strength at such a young age, he must have been trained by some prestigious academy. How could an average academy have such a strong person?

Guo Ling and the others held the lighting equipment in their hands to illuminate the surrounding environment, making everything around them brighter.

Lin Xiu looked ahead and was surprised to find that the environment had started to change again.

The dark trees here, unlike the previous ones, seem to have dried up.

Lin Xiu struck a black tree hard and it sounded like a metal collision.

These dark trees seemed to have dried up, but they turned into a strange metal. This surprised Lin Xiu.

This dark forest was really full of mystery and there were many things that couldn’t be seen on the outside.

It seems that these things may have really fallen from a different dimension and didn’t belong to this world.
