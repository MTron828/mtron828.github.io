As he read through it, the look in Nan Zhengjun’s eyes changed. He kept quiet for a moment before asking Lin Xiu in a heavy tone, “you fought with someone on the spaceship?”

“En.” Lin Xiu admitted to it and then easily guessed a few things.

“Is that about the punishment?”

“That’s right.” Nan Zhengjun nodded his head. When he saw how relaxed Lin Xiu was, he gave a bitter smile before saying to Lin Xiu.

“You’re still in the mood to laugh now. Do you know what the punishment is here at Sacred Region Academy?”

“I’m not sure but it shouldn’t be much right?” Lin Xiu questioned.

Previously, when Luo Yue mentioned to him about the punishment, he thought that it was good news to them.

Luo Yue wouldn’t lie, which was why when Lin Xiu found out that he was being punished, he wasn’t worried about it.

“The punishment here at Sacred Region Academy isn’t just a scolding.” Nan Zhengjun felt a headache coming.

Lin Xiu was an extremely talented warrior and wanted to continue training him but if he was sent to be punished and if it was that location, things would turn out bad.

“What is it then?”

“The first punishment is to be locked up for three days.” Nan Zhengjun raised up three of his fingers and told him.

“Just lock me up then.” Lin Xiu said in a casual tone.

“It’s not as easy as you think. Do you know where you’re being held in?” Nan Zhengjun put on a serious face and asked.

“Where?” Lin Xiu was stunned by his change of expression and subconsciously gave another question.

“The Northern Lightning Region!”

As Nan Zhengjun explained it to him, the screen on the monitor moved. Soon, all the information of the Northern Lightning Region appeared on the screen.

This was an area on the peak of a huge mountain that was on the northern side of the academy. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

There were eight Lightning Birds that were rare there. These birds have the special abilities of capturing the energy around forming huge and scary thunders from the sky.

Most of them who have been punished would be sent onto this mountain to reflect on their mistake.

“These lightning are much scarier than the usual ones that you see. If you get hit by it, you would be injured really badly.” Nan Zhengjun said in a serious tone.

“Plus, you’re not an actual rank 6 warrior and would be able to protect yourself with the ‘circle’ which makes it more troublesome.”

With that said, Nan Zhengjun felt his head throbbed.

“It’s not that bad.” Lin Xiu said in an unconvincing manner.

Previously when they were in strength training, Lin Xiu had been trained to withstand electrocution, which is why he wasn’t scared now.

“You’ll find out about it when you’re there.” Seeing how Lin Xiu was still being carefree about this, Nan Zhengjun said helplessly.

From what he knew, Lin Xiu still wasn’t aware of the dangers that he might be facing at the mountain peak.

“Isn’t there someone else who’s supposed to be there as well?” Lin Xiu thought of the guy that he fought with on the spaceship and narrowed his eyes.

“You mean the one that you fought with? He is punished for it but he doesn’t have to go for it.” After hearing Lin Xiu’s question, Nan Zhengjun took a look at the computer and frowned when he found out about it.

“Why not?” Lin Xiu paused for a moment before asking subconsciously.

“Looks like he has an important mission to attend to which was why he got exempted.” Nan Zhengjun sighed.

Lin Xiu wouldn’t help but frown as well when he heard what Nan Zhengjun said. Well, looks like he was the unfortunate one.

“When do I have to go there?” Lin Xiu continued asking.

“Tomorrow at seven. I’ll be the one who’ll bring you there. Three days later, your punishment would be over. Remember to take some nutrient liquid before heading there. You won’t be able to eat for the next three days.” Nan Zhengjun carefully told Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded his head and said, “I’m leaving now.”

“Alright, have a good rest. Don’t be too pressured about it.” Nan Zhengjun patted on Lin Xiu’s shoulder before he left.

“En.”

When he left the office, Lin Xiu decided to return home.

“Yo, you’re here as well.”

Just when Lin Xiu was on his way home, a piercing voice appeared next to him.

His eyes turned towards the direction from where the voice was coming from and saw a familiar figure, sitting on a big tree.

“It’s you.”

Lin Xiu frowned as soon as he saw who it was.

Zhang Liangqian, the person who Lin Xiu fought with in the spaceship. The other person who was supposed to be punished.

“Tsk tsk, looks like you have already found out that you’ll be heading over there?” Zhang Liangqian jumped down from the tree and said to Lin Xiu.

His eyes were mocking Lin Xiu about his punishment.

“Yes, so what?” Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows while questioning the other person.

“Tsktsk, such a poor worm. I hope you come back alive.” Zhang Liangqian continued to mock Lin Xiu.

“SB.” Lin Xiu looked at him as if he was an idiot and headed in the other direction.

Hearing what Lin Xiu said and with the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes, Zhang Liangqian felt insulted and his face got twisted together.

“Who do you think you are!” Zhang Ling screamed out loud and his fist was already heading for Lin Xiu’s back who was in front of him!

His fist was filled with energy; even the air around him was changing because of the energy coming from his fist.

BOOM – –

At the moment where his fist was about to land on Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu had already turned around as if there was a pair of eyes on the back of his head and there was another fist headed towards Zhang Liangqian!

BOOM –

When both their fists met, there was a loud sound that came from the collision.

Zhang Liangjian felt as if his fist had landed on an oncoming train. The force was so great that his body immediately flew away.

Crack Crack – –

His body landed on the ground and there was the sound of his bone breaking.

“You’re only of this level?” Lin Xiu glanced at him contemptuously. Then, he walked in the other direction without looking back.

“You...”

Zhang Liangqian felt an immense pain around his arm and there was an awful look on his face.

“As long as you’re still here in Sacred Region Academy, I will kill you!” Zhang Liangqian continued screaming.

The bone in his arms felt as if they were torn apart. It wasn’t a smart move to challenge Lin Xiu now.

Lin Xiu threw him a glance, snorted and continued walking away.

When Zhang Liangqian saw the cold smile on Lin Xiu’s face, he got so mad that his lungs were about to explode.

If it weren’t for the current situation that stopped him since he had always been a careful person, he would have continued fighting Lin Xiu.

“And you want to attack me?” Lin Xiu mumbled to himself while walking.

But as he glanced at his fist, he noticed that there was also blood on his fist.
