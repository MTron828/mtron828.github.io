He can settle them on his own?

The students from the Sacred Region Academy were all stunned.

At the same time, Mu Zi led the warriors from the Interstellar Academy and were all headed towards Lin Xiu!

They have released all of the energy in their body and were attacking Lin Xiu together!

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he looked at the warriors who were running towards him. He did not move at all.

!!

Those from the Sacred Region Academy had cold sweats on their foreheads as they felt worried for Lin Xiu.

There were so many of them headed towards Lin Xiu and he wasn’t moving at all. He was definitely going to die.

Boom – –

But, just when they were about to hit Lin Xiu’s body, there was a loud explosion. All of the students from the Interstellar Academy felt a strong burst of energy coming from Lin Xiu and they were all hit by it.

None of them had the chance to release their ‘sphere’ as they were all thrown into the air.

Boom boom boom – –

Their bodies fell onto the ground and they were moaning in pain.

Pfft – –

As for Mu Zi, he couldn’t help but spat out a mouthful of blood.

He laid on the ground with blood dripping out of the corner of his mouth and held onto his chest. He looked at Lin Xiu in disbelief.

How was that possible?!

There were so many of them from the Interstellar Academy. They didn’t even have the chance to get close to Lin Xiu before getting thrown away!

It was terrifying! So terrifying!

“All of you … are really weak.”

Lin Xiu looked at the warriors who were lying on the ground in pain.

“You…..!”

When Mu Zi heard what Lin Xiu said, he felt furious and more blood came out of his mouth.

“Mu Zi, are you sure you want to continue the battle?”

Baili Tao asked as he gently stroked his beard and looked at Mu Zi who was having trouble standing up on his feet.

Mu Zi was unhappy with how the situation turned out but because he was afraid of Lin Xiu, he didn’t dare to challenge the Sacred Region Academy.

“Let’s go!”

Mu Zi finally felt the pain in his body disappearing. He quickly got on his feet and instructed the rest of the students from the Interstellar Academy.

As all of them slowly crawled to their feet, they quickly left with Mu Zi.

They were all shocked by the strength that Lin Xiu had just shown.

They would have all died if that was what Lin Xiu wanted.

“All the warriors on earth are getting stronger?”

When the warriors from the other school left, Lin Xiu turned towards Baili Tao and asked about the current situation on earth.

“Yes.”

Baili Tao sighed.

For the past one year, there has been an influx of powerful warriors and they were blooming like bamboo shoots after a rainy day.

There were definitely so many more powerful warriors now compared to before.

“I have a feeling that something has been awakened on earth.”

Baili Tao thought about it before telling Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was surprised.

Awakened?

Lin Xiu closed his eyes and felt the surroundings. That’s when he noticed that the energy in the air around him was thicker now.

“How did this happen suddenly?”

Lin Xiu thought that it was weird.

“I’m not sure as well but the Federation has started investigating it.”

Baili Tao shook his head and answered.

“I made tea. Do you want to head over there with me?”

Baili Tao looked around before offering Lin Xiu to join him.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“All of you should go back now.”

Baili Tao waved his hands at the students.

“Also, remember to train hard.”

“Yes, Sir!”

All of the students were turning around to look at Lin Xiu as they were all extremely curious about him.

Lin Xiu’s name was a legend in the Sacred Region Academy.

Especially after how he had easily defeated the students from the Interstellar Academy.

His abilities were much above those from the other school.

Soon, Lin Xiu and Baili Tao entered the dean’s office.

“Take a seat.”

Baili Tao was pouring tea for the both of them with a wide smile on his face.

It was obvious that he was quite happy to see Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and sat opposite him.

“Oh, where’s Haoling?”

Lin Xiu suddenly thought of his own master and was wondering where she went.

“She? She went off to another planet to cultivate.”

Baili Tao told Lin Xiu about Baili Haoling as he poured tea for Lin Xiu.

“She probably felt pressured with how your abilities are progressing so quickly.”

“Which planet did she go to?”

Lin Xiu felt curious.

“I’m not sure about that since the ancestors were the ones who brought her there.”

Baili Tao shook his head.

Lin Xiu suddenly thought of the ancestors of the Baili Family that he met during the competition in Sky City.

They have been alive for such a long time which meant that they were incredibly strong as well.

“My pets went along with her?”

Lin Xiu continued asking.

“You mean the ice crystal white bird and the things that look like a meatball?” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Baili Tao described them subconsciously after hearing Lin Xiu’s question.

“En.”

He left Xiao Bai and Rollie back on earth and did not bring them along to Namir Planet.

Now that he’s back on earth, Lin Xiu thought that he would be able to meet them.

But, he didn’t think that Baili Haoling would have taken them with her.

“Let’s hope that the next time I meet her, she wouldn’t have bribed my pets so badly that they forgot who their owner was.”

Lin Xiu laughed.

As they enjoyed their tea, they chatted about different things that have happened to them recently.

Baili Tao was extremely curious about what Lin Xiu had experienced in Namir Planet.

His eyes glowed brightly in excitement when he heard Lin Xiu talk about what he saw in Namir Planet.

“I didn’t think that there were such strong warriors on that planet.”

Baili Tao couldn’t help but sighed.

Rank 9 warriors were like kid’s play on another planet.

Baili Tao had a bitter smile on his face as he thought about it.

“I already killed the rest of them. There shouldn’t be anyone who would be able to find this place.”

Lin Xiu reassured Baili Tao after taking another sip of the tea.

He was talking about the God Hunters.

These men were the ones who wanted to conquer earth to get more resources but in the end, Lin Xiu was the one who annihilated them.

“From the looks of it, Earth is still considered a weak planet.

After hearing what Lin Xiu had been through, Baili Tao couldn’t help but give such comments.

This was why he felt even more unsafe.

If anyone of those warriors got onto earth, the entire planet would be in chaos.

“So, the warriors back on earth should be prepared. Rank 9 is merely just the beginning.”

Lin Xiu chuckled. Then, he waved his left hand and took out a piece of beast emperor odd crystal.
