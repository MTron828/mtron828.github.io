Chapter 187: Devouring The Red Lotus Fire

‘It hurts, it hurts too much.’

It felt like the blood in his body was up in flames.

Lin Xiu clenched his teeth tightly at this time, trying hard to endure it.

But this pain was really beyond the endurance of ordinary people, it was as if his body was about to melt completely!

After a short while, Lin Xiu was dizzy and his body fell to the ground.

“‘Engulf’ skill is activated… absorb 0.1%…”

While Lin Xiu was dizzy, the system prompt sounded.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu could not hear it anymore.

Luo Yue frowned when she saw this scene.

Lin Xiu was in a very dangerous state right now. The Red Lotus Fire seemed to have rushed in Lin Xiu’s body, making his whole body flushed.

Even his combat suit became extremely hot at this time and some white smoke was coming out around him.

The only possibility now was for Lin Xiu to completely absorb the fire of this lotus fire, otherwise, there was no other way to save Lin Xiu.

Luo Yue was silent for a while, then sighed.

There was nothing she could do now and could only hope that Lin Xiu can make it through.

Although she has never heard of many warriors who could do this.

The source strength in Luo Yue’s body was released at this time.

Because of the skill she cultivated, her source strength seemed to have a kind of ice attribute.

Looking at Lin Xiu whose body became extremely hot, she lifted his body and hugged Lin Xiu from behind.

A very hot sensation spread over her body instantly, causing Luo Yue to frown.

She held her breath and continued to release her source strength, wrapping Lin Xiu’s entire body.

She didn’t have a better way and could only use the source strength she released, coupled with the cold effect produced by her special skill to cool Lin Xiu’s body.

Otherwise, if this continues, the flesh and blood in his body would be completely burned by the fire!

Lin Xiu, who was unconscious, seemed to feel a slight icy sensation, and his body that felt like it was burning before felt much better

What Lin Xiu didn’t know at this time was that the energy of the Red Lotus Fire was continuously being absorbed by his body.

His body was initially seriously injured but because Luo Yue wrapped Lin Xiu’s body with her source strength, it allowed Lin Xiu’s body to recover faster.

Destroying and repairing at the same time – this kind of severe pain was not something ordinary people could bear.

Even when Lin Xiu was unconscious, his teeth were still clenched.

What happened!?

After a short while, Luo Yue clearly felt that Lin Xiu’s body was instinctively absorbing the source strength released by her.

Although she didn’t know what was going on, Luo Yue still continued releasing the source strength from her body.

“Darn thing!” Zhang Yin and the others were running wildly at this time.

The rank 6 Blue-winged beetle was really terrifying. Not only was it huge in size, but it was also very fast.

They could only keep running away and hiding from this monster’s pursuit; fighting back was simply impossible.

About half an hour passed quickly, Luo Yue’s face had turned pale, even though her body’s source strength was very strong, but it has been half an hour and she was almost completely hollowed out at this time.

Lin Xiu’s body seemed to still have a burning sensation now.

“Absorption——99.1%…”

What Lin Xiu didn’t know was that at this time, the ‘Engulf’ skill was working together with his body, constantly devouring the energy of the Red Lotus Fire.

His flesh and blood, organs, meridians, and even bones in the body were repairing crazily while being destroyed by the fire of the Lotus Fire. After the repair, it seemed to be stronger than before!

Slowly, as the last Lotus Fire energy cluster disappeared in Lin Xiu’s body, a prompt sounded in his mind:

“‘Engulf’ complete… experience gained… 310 million…”

Lin Xiu’s originally red skin was now slowly returning to its original appearance.

“Damn…” Lin Xiu seemed to hear some loud noises nearby.

He slowly opened his eyes and his blurred vision became normal.

The extremely burning pain in his body from before seemed to have disappeared and he felt very comfortable now.

Yes, incredibly comfortable, like he had a new life.

“Luo Yue?” Lin Xiu took a glance and saw Luo Yue hugging him from the back.

She didn’t look good and her face was very pale.

When he was in a coma just now, he felt the coldness and there was a lot of source strength. Could it be Luo Yue…

With that thought, Lin Xiu felt as if his heart had been hammered and there was an indescribable feeling.

“Are you okay?” Lin Xiu said nervously at this time.

Luo Yue’s face was still expressionless and she shook her head at this time.

But she looked at Lin Xiu with a look of shock.

“Hurry up, absorb the energy of the Odd crystals first.” Lin Xiu said sternly as he took out the rank 5 Odd crystals directly from his backpack and placed them in Luo Yue’s hands.

Her current situation was obviously due to the exhaustion of source strength.

Boom——

But at this moment, a loud noise suddenly came and the whole ground seemed to shake. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I… I can’t do it anymore!!!” Li Ping and the others’ voices came from a distance.

They were in a difficult situation at the moment. This rank 6 Blue-winged beetle was really terrifying, not only did it make people not have the slightest courage to fight back, but it was unbearable to even flee from it.

They were buying time for Lin Xiu and Luo Yue so Zhang Yin and the others were running wildly to attract the monster’s attention.

But they were in a state of exhaustion right now!

“You go and help them first, I’m fine.” Luo Yue seemed to know what Lin Xiu was thinking. She sat up on the ground at this time then looked up at Lin Xiu and said.

“En, take a break first and I’ll be right back.” Lin Xiu nodded, then picked up the Dark Edge spear on the side and ran over.

Luo Yue took a deep breath. Seeing Lin Xiu wake up, her tensed heart could finally relax.

There was still a hint of shock in her eyes.

Lin Xiu seemed to have absorbed all the energy of the Red Lotus Fire in just half an hour!

She didn’t think much about it. At this time, she quickly used the ‘Cultivation Technique’, placed her palms together, and quickly absorbed the energy of the Odd crystal into her body.

Click, click, click——

Just as Lin Xiu ran over, he heard a faint sound and it sounded like an eggshell cracking.
