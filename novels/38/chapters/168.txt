Chapter 169: Crawl Over For Me

“I wanted to announce something. From now on, if you guys want to go over to the exchange center, you have to crawl over for me.”

Right at this time, a voice sounded out from behind.

10 pairs of eyes immediately turned behind to look at the source of the voice.

They saw a young man walking out from amongst the crowd.

“Class monitor!” Li Ping and the others cried out emotionally.

Class 10 monitor?

A few spectators were surprised to see Lin Xiu as well.

But many more were looking at him with disdain. Class 10 was the weakest class in their eyes, so what if he was the class monitor?

Zhao Huang saw Lin Xiu and his eyes immediately turned cold. He revealed a smile of disdain and said:

“Brat, aren’t you afraid of having your tongue cut off for saying such big words.”

He thought that Lin Xiu was intentionally acting brave to not lose face.

“I will give you one chance, scram now or…get beaten up by me before you scram!” Lin Xiu ignored Zhao Huang’s words and glared at them coldly.

“Seeking death!!!” A guy from the back rushed forward when he heard Lin Xiu’s unbridled words!

“You guys should stay by the side first.” Lin Xiu remained unafraid and looked at Li Ping and the others as he spoke up indifferently.

They hesitated for a moment before rushing behind Lin Xiu.

They knew his strength and not only were they unable to help him but might even be a burden to him.

“Wolf fist!!!” The young man leaped upwards and sent his right fist towards Lin Xiu!

This was a gold skill and the air seemed to howl like a wolf as his fists flew forward!

What a powerful fist skill!

All the freshmen gasped in admiration when they saw the fist.

Lin Xiu frowned and the source strength in his body surged forward and enveloped his fist.

His source strength turned into a pale green color that marked the level of a rank 4 warrior.

Lin Xiu launched his own fist towards the youth!

‘Seeking death!!!’ The youth roared out when he saw Lin Xiu brazenly taking his attack head-on as their fists collided!

The two fists collided and produced a loud explosion sound. The youth opened his eyes wide.

A gigantic force caused his bones to seem to break and produce cracking sounds.

He retreated more than 10 steps and spat out blood.

“You… what fist skill was that?” The young man looked at Lin Xiu with disbelief.

His wolf fist was a powerful gold skill but was actually inferior to Lin Xiu?

Lin Xiu looked to be completely unharmed while his entire arm was in pain. If he did not guess wrongly, his bones had some fractures!

“Bronze skill – Rupturing Fist.” Lin Xiu glanced at the group and replied indifferently.

‘Bronze Skill?!’

‘He actually used a bronze skill?!’

Everyone was stunned, it was their first time witnessing someone using a bronze skill with its power that was stronger than a gold skill!

Zhao Huang frowned, he sensed that Lin Xiu strength was not as simple as he looked and had faint regret on starting this.

“I am class 3 Zhao Huang, I reckon that we have had a slight misunderstanding, so why don’t we stop here?” Zhao Huang pondered for a moment before speaking to Lin Xiu.

He sensed that Lin Xiu’s aura was very weak but the strength he had just revealed was extremely powerful.

“Sure.” Lin Xiu nodded then smiled, “Li Ping, come here.”

“Alright!” Upon hearing his words, Li Ping walked forward.

The collision that forced the youth to retreat caused their morale to swell and they were no longer fearful of the group in front of them.

“All of you can crawl over from him and we can call this matter quits.” Lin Xiu pointed to the spot at Li Ping’s feet and chuckled.

Their expressions changed as soon as Lin Xiu spoke up.

“What intolerable bullying!!!” Two of the guys immediately pounced at Lin Xiu, they wanted to teach him a lesson!!!

Bang bang bang-

They moved extremely quickly and their fists produced vacuum explosions as they flew forward.

“Be careful!” Li Ping and the others exclaimed.

They were all rank 4 warriors while Lin Xiu’s classmates were rank 3. In other words, the two young men were stronger and faster.

“Hmph.” Lin Xiu snorted and moved immediately to dodge them.

‘Damn it!’

The expressions in their eyes changed when they saw Lin Xiu avoid their attacks with ease and immediately gathered up all their strength!

“Slow, too slow!” After training in the gravity room for long, Lin Xiu’s instinctive reaction had improved and he was able to avoid their fists with ease!

Serial Kick!!!

Lin Xiu grabbed hold of the chance and sent out three kicks towards the first guy’s abdomen and sent him flying out. He crashed onto a rubbish bin and fell in.

In the next second, he glanced to his left and grabbed the second youth’s arm with his right hand.

He exerted a force with the pull!

Sssilaaa-

In an instant, sparks were produced and the youth’ clothes were ripped and deep gashes on his arm!

“Ahhh!!!!” The immense pain caused him to scream and the power in his arm subsided.

Lin Xiu snorted and kicked him out without hesitation!

“Silver thunderbolt palm!!!” Zhao Huang who remained unmoved the entire time suddenly launched an attack when Lin Xiu kicked the second youth!

Sneak attack!

Pa-

But Lin Xiu was unable to react and the palm landed right on his back and produced a loud and crisp sound!

Crackle-

In an instant, large silver lightning bolts trapped Lin Xiu!

The ground turned black because of the lightning flashes.

‘What powerful lightning! Is he… electrocuted?’

Even with a warrior’s strong body, one could fall due to an electric shock!

All the spectators around exclaimed in unison.
