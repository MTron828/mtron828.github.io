1462 Destroying Earth!

Lin Xiu then clicked on his apprentice system.

Marqi Planet: An Qi and Qian Ling.

Namir Planet: Wang Qiang.

Mastering Point: 368100

“Damn…”

Lin Xiu was surprised to see what he had accumulated so far.

It has been a long time since he has checked it and he didn’t think that there would be a total of 368100 points.

He clicked on each of them in detail and saw that An Qi and Qian Ling were already sage warriors!

As for Wang Qiang, he was already a warrior god!

“They have indeed improve quickly.”

Lin Xiu felt comforted after seeing these updates of his apprentice.

It felt like it was a long time ago and Lin Xiu has not seen them for a long time.

Then, he noticed that there were a lot of things he could exchange for.

Most of the items here were quite useless for Lin Xiu.

Afterall, he had already acquired the strongest flames.

He also didn’t need any weapons or combat suits.

“Perhaps I can get one for Luo Yue…”

Lin Xiu looked at the other items in the store and noticed that with his mastering points, he would be able to get a God King combat armour for Luo Yue.

He wasn’t able to find any True God combat armour.

The God King combat armour was black in colour with gold brims.

This was similar to the ones that Lin Xiu had on and they made a perfect match.

But, Luo Yue was still busy cultivating and Lin Xiu did not want to disturb her.

Therefore, Lin Xiu decided to cultivate as well.

Then, all of the energy in the air around him slowly rushed into Lin Xiu’s body.

Lin Xiu continued absorbing all of the available energy in the air.

Time passed quickly and it was already the second day.

“You’re awake?”

When Lin Xiu opened his eyes, he saw Luo Yue next to him and he smiled.

“En.”

Luo Yue smiled as well.

Luo Yue wasn’t used to smiling and now that she was forcing herself too, it looked funny.

She looked adorable.

As he looked at Luo Yue’s beautiful face, Lin Xiu walked over to her and hugged her.

Luo Yue blushed shyly.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but kiss her on the lips.

“Let’s get prepared to head back.”

Lin Xiu looked into her eyes.

“En.”

“Oh! This is for you.”

Lin Xiu then passed the armour over to Luo Yue.

“This is…”

“This is an armour and it should be able to block the attacks from the God Kings.”

The ones that Luo Yue had on now were damaged.

“Alright.”

Luo Yue then accepted the combat suit.

As she controlled it with her mind, she then put on the armour without any trouble.

Lin Xiu felt that he wasted an opportunity.

He thought that Luo Yue would change in front of him but…

Suddenly, he met with Luo Yue’s confused eyes and he almost choked on himself.

“It’s nothing.”

“This is a god-level warrior skills card for swords. It should be useful for you.”

Lin Xiu handed over the ‘Sword Flory Nine Zhou’ to Luo Yue.

“We’ll leave after you learn this.”

Lin Xiu then suggested it to Luo Yue.

With their new armour, both of them saw cross legged on the ground and continued cultivating.

Both of them then placed their warrior skill cards on their forehead.

As they activated the energy in their bodies, they started absorbing the information from the warrior skill cards.

It was no surprise that the warrior skill cards from the system were incredibly powerful.

They were more powerful than the ones that they purchased!

About half an hour later, the warrior skill cards that were once shining brightly seemed to have lost their glow.

Then, it fell onto the ground.

“Finally.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath.

There were too much information in the card but he was still able to absorb them quickly.

Then, he turned over to Luo Yue and noticed that she was still cultivating.

It should be over soon.

About ten minutes later, as expected, Luo Yue had already completely absorbed the information from the card.

“Let’s go.”

After taking a break, Lin Xiu then got his Spatial Cube from his expansion space and it appeared in his palm.

Then, Lin Xiu flushed his energy into the Spatial Cube.

The Spatial Cube then started spinning quickly.

Soon, there was a bright light that appeared.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue then walked into the bright light.

Xiu – –

Both their figures suddenly appeared on earth!

“You’re finally back?”

Just as they appeared on earth, there was a familiar voice that came from above.

Ling Tianxi!

Other than her, there were also 7 other God Kings in the air!

Lin Xiu’s eyes were wide open when he saw them.

How are these people here on earth?

“Tsktsk! So you two are the ones from earth?”

One of them glared at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue and he sneered.

He raised his right hand and a surge of energy appeared in his palm.

It wasn’t aimed at Lin Xiu but for the city behind them!

Boom – –

The cities there were all instantly destroyed!

The entire ground started shaking.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue could feel the impact of the horrible explosion.

“Stop it!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes had turned bloody red.

That was Sky City!

That strike itself had completely ruined Sky City!

Lin Xiu rushed forward but he soon realised that there was a transparent barrier that stopped him.

This was the power of Xia Guang, the spatial God King! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He had already set up barriers all around Lin Xiu.

“He was the one who killed the God King from Tianshen Pavillion.”

Huangfu Yuansheng had already got ears and eyes on it as he informed Xia Guang about it.

“Don’t worry. They will not be able to leave that region.”

Xia Guang spoke in an indifferent tone.

He looked confident as well.

“Hehe! Both of you shall die!”

The God King from before then released another energy strike.

Then, there was another region on earth that got destroyed.

“Luo Yue, I have warned you about this. This is your punishment for going against me!”

Ling Tianxi spoke in a cold tone.

“Kill those from earth now!”

She commanded the other God Kings.

Xiu – –

All of the God Kings then instantly disappeared.

They appeared on the other side of earth and released horrible energy strikes one after another, destroying the cities on earth from all directions!

Luo Yue’s hand started shivering as she gripped onto her sword.

Her family was still here!

Then, she rushed forward to Ling Tianxi with her sword in her hand!

Her sword was now black in colour.

‘All of you shall die!!!!!’

Lin Xiu clenched his jaw and there was a large amount of golden energy released from the spear!
