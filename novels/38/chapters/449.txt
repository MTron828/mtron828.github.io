Chapter 450: I Never Agreed

After hearing what he said, Ouyang Hang was stunned for a moment but he realized what Lin Xiu said was true as well.

Ever since he entered the Sacred Region Academy, Lin Xiu has always defeated him in every competition they had.

As he thought about it, he felt like crying.

He has finally got rid of that pervert Yu Muchen and managed to enroll in the Sacred Region Academy but ended up facing a much more powerful opponent. It was someone who even defeated Yu Muchen!

“Forget about it. Tell me more about him.”

Lin Xiu laughed for a bit before asking Ouyang Hang to continue.

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, Ouyang Hang quickly changed the topic. Since being the ‘forever second’ was definitely something depressing and he no longer wanted to dwell on this topic.

With what Ouyang Hang told him, Lin Xiu knew more about Yu Muchen. He was not only someone with strong family background, his abilities are extremely powerful as well. As a young man in his twenties, he was already a rank 7 warrior and would soon be able to reach rank 8!

One should remember that there are others who would never be able to reach such levels. In other words, he was considered a genius amongst the gifted and talented ones.

Plus, his status in the Warrior Union was pretty high as well. It seemed like he has always been traveling to different places in order to complete some of the most dangerous missions.

“That fella is only 20 years old but has already become a rank 7 warrior. I’m really curious about how he does it.” Ouyang Hang spoke in a depressed tone. They were both of the same age but there was already a huge difference in their abilities.

“Oh, by the way, how old are you?” Ouyang Hang seemed to be reminded of something as he asked Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was also someone extremely powerful and his skills were so unique that he even defeated Yu Muchen.

But, this time, Yu Mucheng has only lost because he had been too careless since he was a much higher rank than Lin Xiu.

“About 18 years old?” Lin Xiu thought about it for a moment before answering him.

Pfftttt – –

When he heard the answer, Ouyang Hang almost fell to the ground. His eyes widened in disbelief as he questioned Lin Xiu, “You’re saying that you’re only turning 18 this year?”

“Yeap.” Lin Xiu helplessly shrugged his shoulders.

In fact, his body’s age was only 17 but his mental age was that of a young man who is already in his twenties.

“Monster. You are a monster.” Ouyang Hang felt defeated.

Compared to himself, Lin Xiu was obviously a monster. Even if he started training when he was in his mother’s womb, he still wouldn’t be as powerful as Lin Xiu.

As he thought of the things that he had found out about Lin Xiu from his investigations, he remembered that Lin Xiu was a weak student back in high school and only gotten stronger in these 6 months.

“You wouldn’t be hiding your powers earlier, would you? You are unbelievable.” Ouyang Hang was in shock as he continued asking Lin Xiu.

If Lin Xiu was someone who didn’t even qualify as a warrior in the beginning of the year and managed to become a rank 6 warrior within 6 months, he would never believe him!

“That’s enough. You should tell me more about his family as well as Luo Yue’s family. Are they related?” Lin Xiu subconsciously ignored Ouyang Hang’s irrelevant question. He would never tell anyone about his system.

“Oh? That’s what you wanted to know?” When Ouyang Hang realized what Lin Xiu actually wanted to know, he immediately forgot about the shocking news that he had just heard. Instead, he was looking at Lin Xiu with an interesting look in his eyes.

“Tell me.”

Lin Xiu really wanted to know more about this. When he was fighting Yu Muchen on stage a while ago and mentioned that he was engaged to Luo Yue, Lin Xiu took it to heart and he felt uneasy about it.

“The Yu family and the Luo family are one of the biggest families in Sky city but compared to the Yu family, the Luo family is much scarier…”

Ouyang Hang couldn’t help but shiver as he thought of something.

Lin Xiu got extremely curious when he saw the look on Ouyang Hang’s face.

“Hold on a minute. Tell me. You’re bothered by the fact that they’re engaged?” Ouyang Hang said in a chirpy tone when he realized what Lin Xiu was thinking of.

Lin Xiu kept quiet and did not deny what Ouyang Hang said. After spending so much time with Luo Yue, Lin Xiu was sure that he has feelings for Luo Yue.

“Their parents are friends. I think it was because both their mothers were pregnant at the same time. When they found out they each had a boy and a girl, they decided to get them engaged.

“But from what I’ve seen, Luo Yue doesn’t seem to be interested in Yu Mucheng and Yu Muchen only takes Luo Yue as a younger sister.” Ouyang Hang continued muttering on his own.

“Plus, haven’t you noticed that Luo Yue actually likes you?” As Ouyang Hang continued to chat about the gossip, he was a completely different person.

If it wasn’t because Ouyang Hang was standing right in front of him, Lin Xiu would have thought that he was talking to someone else.

This fella has always looked cruel and evil before this but after knowing him, Ouyang Hang is someone who can never stop talking!

“Hehe … .since you guys are living together now, don’t tell me that nothing has happened between the two of you. Stop pretending to be innocent and pure.” Ouyang Hang said to Lin Xiu and patted his shoulder.

“Right, I always wanted to ask… How did you break through to rank 6?”

“I’ve got to go.” Lin Xiu was terribly confused. This fella would never stop talking once you allow him to start.

But since he already got the answer that he wanted, Lin Xiu no longer wanted to talk to Ouyang Hang. He immediately turned around and walked towards the exit.

“Also, don’t forget to lock the doors.”

“Hey! Why are you walking so fast?!” Seeing how Lin Xiu was already gone, Ouyang Hang screamed at him.

Lin Xiu was already at the exit and walked towards his house.

Since the settings for the delivery had been destroyed, Lin Xiu packed dinner for the both of them before returning home.

“Luo Yue?” As soon as he walked into the house, Lin Xiu saw a figure in white.

Luo Yue seemed to be deep in her thoughts as she looked at the ground.

When she heard that it was Lin Xiu’s voice, she quickly turned around and said, “You’re back.”

“En.”

“Why are they out here?” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue’s feet and noticed that Rollie and the Little White Crystal Bird were in the courtyard as well.

Luo Yue was holding onto an Odd Crystal and was feeding them like a pet.

“They got caught for stealing Odd crystals.” Luo Yue told him while pointing towards the student hostel nearby.

“The both of you! If you try to steal any more Odd Crystals, I’ll roast both of you!” Luo Yue said towards both of them after hearing what Luo Yue said.

Both the creatures were having fun as they were chewing on the crystals and none of them bothered listening to what Lin Xiu was saying. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yu Mucheng left.” Luo Yue told him while feeding them the odd crystals.

“He left?” Lin Xiu was surprised.

“En.” Luo Yue hesitated for a moment before nodding his head. She didn’t know why she hesitated but still managed to say the words, “I have never agreed to the engagement.”
