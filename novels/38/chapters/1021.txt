Chapter 1022: The An Family Annihilated

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Boom– –

There was another explosion that happened. Lin Xiu was holding onto his huge fist and it immediately caused his ‘sphere’ to explode!

It has to be noted that this was the ‘sphere’ of a sage warrior!

With that one punch, the entire ‘sphere’ exploded!

Pfft – –

As Lin Xiu landed the punch, Sun Tian spat out a mouthful of blood.

He took a few steps back as well due to the impact.

‘Sphere’s were formed by the source energy inside the warrior’s body.

Once the ‘sphere’ has exploded, the energy that he used to form the ‘sphere’ would disappear as well.

This would cause a great impact on the warrior’s body!

Seeing how Lin Xiu was still coming at him, Sun Tiao became terrified and immediately released his domain forces.

With the domain forces released, his speed became much faster than before.

Xiu – –

Lin Xiu, who was about to punch Sun Tiao, suddenly missed his target.

Then, Sun Tiao suddenly reappeared behind Lin Xiu.

Although there was blood coming out of her mouth, Sun Tiao still had a cold smile on his face.

This was his domain force. His speed was already the fastest known to all warriors.

There was no one existing that could be faster than him!

At the same time, he gathered all of his energy onto both hands and turned them into wind blades, aimed at Lin Xiu’s back!

Xiu – –

With a blink of an eye, Lin Xiu disappeared right in front of him!

What just happened?!

Seeing how he missed his shot, Sun Tiao was stunned.

From his experience, as long as he had his domain forces, he was already the quickest. How did Lin Xiu dodge his attack?!

Boom – –

At that very moment, he felt something coming from behind him. When he turned around, he was immediately welcomed by a huge punch on the face.

His entire body flew into the air and landed on a brick wall behind him causing a huge crater on the wall.

Pfft – –

There was blood coming out of his mouth.

He slowly crawled to stand with his hair in a mess, looking confused.

He was a sage warrior! A sage warrior! How could he be so easily defeated when he has his domain forces released?!

“That’s all you have?”

Lin Xiu looked at him and asked in a sarcastic tone.

Sun Tao might be a sage warrior but for Lin Xiu, he was one of the weakest sage warriors that Lin Xiu has met so far.

One may be a sage warrior but it wouldn’t necessarily mean all of them were powerful.

“Quick! Use your sourcemark!!!”

An Ruqing, who was still stuck inside Lin Xiu’s array, quickly screamed to Sun Tao.

The strongest warrior that he had was Sun Tao. If Sun Tao were to die because of Lin Xiu, they would be ruined!

Sun Tao heard An Ruqing’s cry and he came back to his senses.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was slowly coming closer to him, he cried in rage. Then, a green sourcemark appeared on his forehead.

As soon as the sourcemark appeared, there was a strong wind that blew towards them.

Wu Hao and his men had to block their faces as well with their hands.

As the wind continued blowing, there was a huge tornado formed amongst them.

The tornado was already uprooting all of the houses nearby.

“Go to hell!!!”

Sun Tao screamed in rage. He shook his hand and soon, the horrifying tornado headed towards Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

At the same time, the Angel suddenly appeared and stood right in front of Lin Xiu.

She instantly activated her energy barrier as well.

Boom – –

The terrifying tornado kept hitting the energy barrier formed by the Angel and it gave out loud explosions.

However, the energy barrier was too strong. No matter how the tornado tried to attack it, it was impossible for it to break through the energy barrier.

“Get…..lost!!!”

Lin Xiu’s body was slowly being pushed back by the tornado as well and he quickly leaped into the air.

As he leaped, the dark spear appeared in his hands.

He turned the spear in his arms and went towards the tornado that was continuously hitting the energy barrier!

‘Adjudicate’!

As the bright white light shone, the tornado started heading back towards Sun Tao.

Sun Tao widened his eyes in shock as he couldn’t believe his eyes.

The skills that he had just released from his sourcemark was coming back at him!

“AHHHHH!!!!”

He roared in rage as he released his ‘sphere’ trying to protect himself.

However, he had exhausted most of the source energy in his body and the ‘sphere’ that he had released was much thinner than usual.

As the tornado kept coming at him, his ‘sphere’ was slowly destroyed by the tornado.

Without the protection of the ‘sphere’, his entire body entered into the tornado as if it was a huge blender. Sun Tao’s body then turned into minced meat.

“It’s over…..everything’s over…”

When An Ruqing saw what happened to Sun Tao, he looked lost.

The Angel had already destroyed all of the warriors from the An family.

As for the sage warrior, Sun Tao, Lin Xiu had just killed him.

The An family had nothing left now.

“Please….please don’t kill me…”

When he noticed that Lin Xiu was coming towards him, his body shivered in fear.

His entire body felt cold.

“Goodbye now.”

Lin Xiu stared at An Ru qing and said calmly.

“NOOOOOOO!!!!”

He cried out loud and soon, the entire array exploded.

An Ruqing, who was stuck inside the array, was blasted into ashes as well.

Wu Hao and the rest of them gasped when they saw the scene.

The An family, who was also known as the strongest family in Tiaojiao City was now completely destroyed by Lin Xiu.

The sage warrior from before was like a pet for Lin Xiu. It didn’t take much effort for Lin Xiu to destroy him. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“It’s over now.”

Lin Xiu looked around him before saying to the rest.

“Wang Qiang.”

Lin Xiu turned towards Wang Qiang.

“Thank you, Master, for saving my life.”

Wang Qiang heard his master calling for him and thanked Lin Xiu gratefully.

If it wasn’t because of Lin Xiu, his parents and him would have been killed by the An family.

“From now on, you will take over the forces belonging to the An family.”

Lin Xiu announced to the rest of them.

“Wu Hao, you would help him right?”

Lin Xiu turned towards Wu Hao, standing at the back, before asking.
