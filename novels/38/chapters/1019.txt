Boom – –

Suddenly, a loud sound came out outside.

“What’s the matter?”

Wu Hao quickly put aside the box that held the Angel’s Tear. He couldn’t help but frown when he heard the loud noise.

Boom – –

!!

Just when he was about to walk out to see what was happening, there was another loud explosion at the door.

The entire door was blasted.

Lin Xiu quickly released his ‘sphere’ and protected the entire region behind him.

Wu Hao was shocked to see what was happening before him. The entire place was covered in flames.

There was also a large part of the bar that had been destroyed.

Then, as the flames got smaller, there were a large number of warriors that rushed into the bar, surrounding Wu Hao and his men.

There was a young man amongst the warriors that led the crowd. His eyes were sharp as it was filled with a murderous intention.

“An Ruqing!! What are you doing?!”

Wu Hao stared at the young man and he was looking extremely unhappy.

The young man that blasted into the bar was An Ruqing from the An family.

“Wu Hao, this has nothing to do with you.”

An Ruqing did not look at Wu Hao. Instead, he kept his eyes on Lin Xiu and he was ready to kill him.

If his eyes could murder another man, Lin Xiu would have died multiple times.

“So, you’re called Lin Xiu?”

An Ruqing glared at Lin Xiu.

As he asked, there were two other warriors that were dragged along two commoners with them.

“On your knees!”

Both them looked familiar. When Lin Xiu took a closer look, he realised that they were Wang Qiang’s parents!

The warriors that were holding them kicked their knees and the both of them kneeled on the ground.

Their heads fell forward and landed on the ground causing blood to spill all over the place.

“Their son killed my dear Anda and he’s now missing.”

An Ruqing looked at Wang Qiang’s parents as he laughed coldly.

“I heard that you are Wang Qiang’s parents? You shall die with them too!”

With that, he took out a laser gun and aimed it towards Wang Qiang’s parents.

“Stop!!!”

Lin Xiu didn’t get the chance to do anything when a loud cry came from behind.

As they turned around, they noticed that it was Wang Qiang.

Wang Qiang’s eyes were bloody red. He gathered all of his energy in his body and rushed towards his parents!

He hadn’t reached home when the news of him killing Anda had already spread.

On his way home, there were already a large number of warriors from the An family looking for him.

Wang Qiang had no other choice but to hide. However, he didn’t think that the An family would go after his parents.

They even tortured his parents.

“Catch him!”

When An Ruqing saw who it was, he screamed.

This was what he wanted. He was trying to get Wang Qiang to show himself.

Everything was going according to his plan.

Wang Qiang was mad as he tried to fight the warriors from the An family.

However, there were sage warriors amongst the warriors from the An family.

This was why Wang Qiang was soon caught by the men from the An family.

“Hmph! See with your own eyes how I am about to shoot them!”

An Ruqing picked up his laser gun once again, pulled the trigger and aimed it towards his parents!

“NOOOO!!!!”

Wang Qiang screamed from the top of his lungs.

But, he could not move at all with the sage warrior holding onto him.

Bakk – –

Suddenly, there were scratches all over the laser gun that An Ruqing was holding onto.

Then, there were cracks and the gun suddenly exploded!

“AHHHHH!”

With the impact from the explosion, both his hands turned black.

An Ruqing was screaming in pain as well.

“Have you forgotten about me?”

Lin Xiu finally walked towards them with a smile on his face.

Lin Xiu waved his left hand and with the surge of energy, Wang Qiang’s parents got onto their feet.

“Are you alright?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Lin Xiu checked on Wang Qiang’s parents.

“We’re fine but Wang Qiang…”

They shook their heads before looking at their son. They were worried as their son was being held by another sage warrior.

“Don’t worry.”

Lin Xiu tried to comfort them.

“Both of you move to the back.”

As soon as Lin Xi said that, Wu Hao swung his hand as well. He got his warriors to step forward and protected Wang Qiang’s parents.

When Wang Qiang saw that his parents were saved, he let out a breath of relief.

However, the sage warrior was holding onto his scapula.

His nails were dug deep into his back and were holding onto his scapula.

It was so painful that he could not move at all.

“Kill him!”

An Ruqing took a few steps back before ordering his men.

The men behind him quickly raised their laser guns and aimed it at Lin Xiu!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Just as these horrifying laser beams were about to hit Lin Xiu, his ‘sphere’ appeared once again.

All of the laser beams were blocked by the barrier.

Boom – –

Then, there were large, thick lightning bolts that covered Lin Xiu’s body.

The electricity crystal ball that was part of his necklace started shining as well.

At that moment, all of the lightning bolts released by Lin Xiu were so much scarier and stronger.

“Go.”

Lin Xiu said calmly.

Suddenly, all of the lightning bolts headed towards those who held onto the guns and were shooting Lin Xiu!

Boom boom boom – –

When the lightning bolts hit their body, all of them exploded on the spot.

Even the laser guns in their hands exploded as well.

The rest of the warriors were terrified after seeing what had happened to their comrades.

All of them started walking backwards subconsciously.

As for An Ruqing, he was shocked as well.

All of the warriors have exploded because of the lightning bolt!

Then, there was a smoky smell in the air.

The warrior’s ashes were also found all over the ground.

“Hmmmm….I don’t think you brought enough warriors with you today.”

Lin Xiu spoke to An Ruqing.

As he continued walking towards the hundreds of warriors before him, all of them started walking backwards.

The pressure that Lin Xiu had given them has caused them to feel frightened.
