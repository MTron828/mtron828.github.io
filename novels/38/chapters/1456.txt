1457 Duo Team, Killing the God King (1)

“I knew you’d be fine.”

Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“I also know that you will come back.”

Luo Yue showed a smile.

“When you smile, you are really beautiful.”

Lin Xiu said sincerely.

Luo Yue seldom smiled. This smile gave Lin Xiu a sweet feeling.

“die!!!”

But at this moment, a warrior with a sword behind him slashed through the air!

A huge wind blade rushed towards Lin Xiu and Luo Yue in an instant!

This wind blade is very terrifying. The surrounding space, with the impact of the wind blade, has cracks in space.

“hng!”

From the corner of Lin Xiu’s eyes, he clearly saw this scene.

With a cold snort, a large number of matrices formed a huge shield and directly blocked the front.

boom–

At this moment, the terrifying wind blade burst out with a loud noise.

Most of the matrix was damaged, but it wasn’t completely destroyed.

“Kill them first.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly at this moment.

There is also infinite killing intent in his eyes.

“En.”

Luo Yue’s eyes also became cold.

At this moment, the two of them flew out in a tacit understanding.

The spear in his hand pierced in an instant!

‘Profound Intent·Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

In this short moment, Lin Xiu directly stabbed out numerous times.

With his strength raised to this level, the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand can stab at an extremely fast speed.

Especially with the power increase of the tool spirit.

At this moment, the god king who was holding a saber was unable to fight back at all.

He could only expand his ‘sphere’ to forcibly resist Lin Xiu’s attack.

Bang bang bang——

Lin Xiu’s long spear stabbed at his ‘sphere’ at this time, and there were huge loud noises.

But there was no way to penetrate his ‘sphere’.

The ‘sphere’ of the god king was very strong.

There was no way to break it easily.

But it doesn’t matter, it’s just that it would take a while to break it.

The tip of Lin Xiu’s Dark edge spear was filled with flame of chaos!

After this series of attacks, although the god king’s ‘sphere’ has not been pierced, it has already begun to deform!

The face of the god king holding the saber also became ugly.

He also began to panic in his heart.

If he continues to fight like this, he will die!

“Come and help!!!”

At this time, while continuing to block Lin Xiu’s attack, he immediately growled.

But at this moment, the god king holding the long sword had already fought with Luo Yue.

Luo Yue’s swordsmanship was very superb, and she didn’t fall into a disadvantage at all.

Moreover, the long sword in Luo Yue’s hand carried an extremely strong dark power.

He must be very careful when fighting against Luo Yue.

Once you are contaminated by such a terrifying dark force, you will be in serious trouble.

“Go and kill that kid first!”

The God King who was fighting Luo Yue spoke to the God King holding a hammer not far away at this moment.

“Okay!”

Hearing his words, the god king holding the hammer directly pointed in Lin Xiu’s direction, and blasted the hammer head in the air!

The moment the hammer was swung down, a huge phantom of the hammer suddenly blasted towards Lin Xiu’s body!

Boom——

Lin Xiu didn’t seem to dodge. At this moment, his whole body was directly blasted down.

It directly hit the ground below, making a loud noise.

At this time, a large amount of thick dust erupted from the entire ground.

“Hmph! Trash!”

The God King holding the warhammer sneered when he saw this scene.

The power of his volley hammer is very powerful.

Lin Xiu has probably already been blasted hundreds of meters underground!

“This kid’s strength is really strong.”

The god king holding the saber was a little out of breath at this moment.

Just a little while ago, his ‘sphere’ was really about to be broken by Lin Xiu’s attack!

“Now, go and help kill that woman first.”

The God king who held the warhammer said.

Next, it should be easier.

“One has a tool spirit, and the other has absorbed the power of the Black River water. These two actually took away what we wanted the most. Damn it!”

The god king holding the saber took a deep breath. While his body began to absorb the surrounding energy, he couldn’t help but gritted his teeth secretly.

Boom——

But just as he finished speaking, a golden flame rushed up instantly!

At this moment, the pupils in the eyes of the god king holding the saber shrank slightly.

The body subconsciously moved back.

But even so, the golden flame passing over his body made him feel as if his skin was being burned.

It’s too hot!

“He’s fine?!”

The expression in the expression of the god king holding the warhammer changed drastically at this moment.

At this moment, he could clearly see Lin Xiu’s figure, flying up!

While Lin Xiu was dancing with the spear in his hand, golden flaming birds were released immediately.

“Damn guy!”

The warrior with the hammer was also furious at this time.

Following his thoughts, a huge black phantom suddenly appeared behind his body.

Black-level spirit, eight-armed giant!

With the appearance of this divine soul power, the size of this god king also instantly became much larger.

Like a mountain!

Bang bang bang——

Those flaming birds impacted his body at this time. Although there were scars, it seemed that there was no way to burn his body for a while.

Um?

His enlarged body doesn’t seem to be his real body.

It’s more like a special energy illusion.

So he didn’t seem to feel any pain from the burning of the chaotic fire.

The warhammer in his hand became extremely huge at this moment.

Immediately, he hammered towards Lin Xiu’s body!

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s figure flashed, and he dodged directly.

And the god king holding the saber also released his soul power at this time.

Black-level soul, Nightmare Wild Leopard!

A wild leopard phantom with terrifying pupils appeared behind him.

Under the increase of the power of the soul, his speed seems to have also become faster.

At this time, Lin Xiu had just dodged the bombardment of the war hammer. The next moment, the god king holding the sword appeared in front of Lin Xiu in an instant.

“look into my eyes!”

The moment the saber in his hand struck out, he immediately growled.

At this moment, his eyes became red.

The pupils also turned into vertical pupils.

The whole body seems to have turned into a pair of huge eyes.

As soon as Lin Xiu glanced over, his whole body seemed to be controlled by a strange force.
