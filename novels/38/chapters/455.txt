Chapter 456: Wave of Beasts!

“Damn, what is this!” Zhang Yin was originally training in the training room. At this time, he was shaken by a stronger tremor than just before and fell to the ground completely.

He cursed at this moment.

Although the building of the Sacred Region Academy has done a very good job of earthquake resistance and no building collapsed but even so, a large number of students still cursed.

At this time, the tremor continued, and after everyone got used to it, they felt something was wrong.

The shaking went on, did something happen?

Boom–

At the same time, Luo Yue, who was training in the gravity room, seemed to feel something. At this moment, the door to the gravity room opened.

Luo Yue had no expression on her face, she was as cold as usual. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

But to everyone’s surprise, Luo Yue was now rushing to leave the training room like she had to go somewhere.

“Oh right, did you see Big Brother Lin today?” Jiang Li, the big guy, seemed to have thought of something, and said curiously at this time.

“Hm, doesn’t he usually train with Luo Yue? I don’t think I saw him today.” Li Ping also said curiously at this time.

It was not just them, the people in class 10 of the South Campus were all a little curious at this time because usually, Lin Xiu would have been training here all day.

Damn it! How could there be such a terrifying creature? !

Lin Xiu in the middle of the sea felt that the surrounding sea current seemed to flow violently, and his body was about to fly to the other side.

At this time, he couldn’t help but pull on those seamounts to stabilize his body.

Roar–

There were dull sounds and the furious black whale had already emerged from the huge space crack!

And as it came out, Lin Xiu could clearly see that it opened its huge mouth, and then bite and swallowed the surrounding evolved beasts.

The was a huge number of evolved beasts in the seabed and there were also many huge ones.

But at this time, they were all bitten in half by the furious black whale.

The sharp teeth seemed to be able to bite off anything, and a large pool of red blood kept flowing in the sea water.

A large number of evolved beasts went crazy. Seeing that all the evolved beasts were swimming wildly, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank sharply.

While pulling the seamount next to him, he slowly hid at the bottom of the sea.

In this situation, these evolved beasts would definitely attack him.

No wonder Dean Baili said that high-level warriors could not come down here. These evolved beasts were very sensitive to strength. At this moment, they were in complete chaos and were charging around crazily.

A large number of seamounts underneath were hit and a lot of rocks fell. What’s more terrifying was that many evolved beasts were hitting the bottom of the Sacred Region Academy, where the surface was an island but it was actually a huge ship!

Boom boom——

“Damn it!” Some of the staff in the control room also had a change in expression.

“What’s going on!!!” Dean Baili’s expression also became exceptionally ugly at this time.

The tremor was still ongoing. Although these tremors were minimal to Dean Baili, this was definitely bad news.

And the staff who were just sent off had special cameras on their diving suits so the control room here could see the situation there.

But soon, the picture that came back was flickering – the signal was very bad.

“No… this is bad!” At this time, a staff member hurried in and said.

“What’s the matter?” Dean Baili asked while looking at the panicked man.

“The evolved beasts below are rioting. Now some evolved beasts are about to rush into the school gate!”

“What!?”

Hearing this man’s words, everyone was shocked.

The surveillance video was quickly mobilized to the outside. At this time, a closer look at the eyes can clearly see that a large number of the weird evolutionary beasts that originally lived on the seabed have all hit the shore, and At the gate of the Sanctuary Academy, there are already a large number of evolved beasts, colliding against the gate of Sanctuary Academy!

“What the hell is going on!? Who incited the riot!” A middle-aged man in the control room said angrily.

In addition to going out to take a spaceship at the Sacred Region Academy, it was strictly forbidden to go out to the sea, let alone go into the sea.

The current wave of evolved beasts was really terrifying. If they were not careful, the Sacred Region Academy may fall to the bottom of the sea!

“Coordinate 21.22 was impacted by a lot of collisions, and it is slightly damaged.” At this time, a man looked at the words on the screen and frantically tapped the virtual keyboard while saying aloud.

“Hurry up and turn on the protection mode!” Dean Baili’s face also became ugly, but he made a decision quickly.

“Yes!”

The man nodded, and a large number of people in the control room took action quickly.

“What is this!?”

Lin Xiu, who was at the bottom of the sea, saw the bottom of the Sacred Region Academy in detail, and bright lights appeared. Soon, he could see something like a ‘Sphere’ unfolding, and then protecting the bottom.

Energy shield!?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief. With this shield, those evolved beasts would not be able to crash and destroy the bottom of the Sacred Region Academy.

However, this huge energy shield consumes a lot of energy so using the energy shield was not the solution. It was originally used to protect against terrorist attacks.

“This is not the way to go, it’s time to deal with it.” Dean Baili stared at the words in the monitor, and then said coldly.

“Dean Baili, are you saying…” The middle-aged man heard the words of Dean Baili, and his eyes changed.

“Get rid of all those things in the sea.” Dean Baili said coldly.

The middle-aged man wanted to say that it was impossible, but at this time he saw that dean Baili had already made up his mind.

The evolved beasts in this sea had always been a problem.

There were too many evolved beasts. Although most of them were around rank 6 and it wasn’t difficult to kill them, but the problem lies in the numbers!

And they were all hidden at the bottom of the sea!
