Chapter 99: Examiner!?

“Wow, amazing! His combat strength actually reached 1,200!”

At this moment, someone exclaimed from the other side. A rank 2 warrior had a combat strength of 1,500 and above, so it was clear that this person was already at the peak of a rank 1 warrior!

Lin Xiu found that almost all of these participants in the warrior assessment had just reached the level of rank 1 warrior and their combat strength was mostly around 800.

“No. 66, Lin Xiu!” At this moment, someone called out next to the combat strength test apparatus.

Lin Xiu went straight over there.

Several people looked over to Lin Xiu’s side, after all, Lin Xiu had just knocked Bi Biqiu down. At this moment, many people were also curious – Lin Xiu seemed like the youngest there, how terrifying was his strength? Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

After examining Lin Xiu’s reference card, the inspector nodded and said, “Go on up.”

As Lin Xiu stepped up, the machine was activated quickly and in the next second, with the sound of a ‘ding’, a phrase appeared on the screen.

“Combat strength, 1,499!?”

The inspector couldn’t help but stare at the screen.

The others gasped in shock – this was simply too much?

Just that bit of combat strength and he would be a rank 2 warrior already!

“Where do I go next?” Lin Xiu came down from the machine and asked the inspector who hasn’t returned to his senses.

“Wait for the broadcast notice.” The inspector then returned to his senses.

“Okay.”

The apparatus displayed a combat strength of below 2,000 just now. Seemed like with the ‘Disguise’ skill, there was really no way of knowing his current combat strength.

At this moment, several warriors were looking at Lin Xiu. His combat strength was simply too high, and it was the highest among the warriors at the moment which shocked many people.

Combat strength testing was merely the first test to judge whether a warrior really reached the level of an official warrior. They still had to go through strength, speed, and physique tests.

“Next, please proceed to the hall for strength testing!” After the last person was done testing for his combat strength, an announcement was made.

A large group of people walked into the middle of the hall, and there were many machines in there which looked like boxing machines.

“This is a test of strength and the remaining two tests are speed and fitness tests. However, the method of the testing is different every time, and I don’t know how the examiner will test it this time.” A man standing next to Lin Xiu seemed to be sharing his experience with his friend.

“Very well, is everyone here?” It was then that a familiar voice resounded from the other side.

Lin Xiu was stunned at this moment, then he looked over there and suddenly saw Baili Haoling.

‘What’s he doing there?’

The rest of the warriors also looked curiously at Baili Haoling and were a little taken aback.

As Baili Haoling wasn’t very tall and had a doll face, it was obvious that he was just a charming young man.

“This round is a test of strength; as long as the force of your punch reaches 1,000 KG, you’ll pass.” Baili Haoling stood on top of the android wolf and said to the warriors.

“Are you an examiner?” A warrior looked at Baili Haoling and asked.

“That’s right.” Baili Haoling nodded.

“Stop joking, you’re an examiner? You can’t even hit 1,000 KG yourself and you want us to do it!?” The warrior laughed and said.

The moment he said that, many of the warriors laughed.

“Exactly! What’s going on with the Warrior Union, how could they let a kid be the examiner?” The rest of the crowd clamored too.

In their opinion, with Baili Haoling’s age, he probably wasn’t even a rank 1 warrior.

“Is that so?” Baili Haoling jumped down from the android wolf and slowly walked over. In the next second, he threw a punch with his right hand on the apparatus, and the numbers on the screen began to spin.

“Di di di”

There was a series of sounds and the numbers turned into a five-digit 99999.

“My god…” The warrior widened his eyes in utter disbelief.

The others were shocked too.

This… is it for real?

“I don’t believe it! It must be fake, let me try!” The guy walked over at this point and punched the apparatus!

Bang——

As the apparatus rang out, the number became 895KG.

“No. 45, 895KG, not qualified, you can go back.” Baili Haoling glanced at the screen and said indifferently.

“It’s impossible! You must be messing with it!” The warrior’s face darkened, then he turned and said to Baili Haoling.

“I’ve already said it, you’ve failed the test of strength, you can go back now.” Baili Haoling repeated.

“Motherf*cker!” The guy’s eyes widened as he threw a punch at Baili Haoling!

Looking at this scene, everyone could not help but exclaim in shock. Seeing the guy’s huge fist about to hit Baili Haoling, Baili Haoling directly reached out and grabbed the guy’s wrist and he couldn’t move at all.

In the next moment, Baili Haoling used force again and it was as if a bamboo was twisted, and the guy’s entire arm instantly cracked.

“Ah!!!” The severe pain made him cry out loud.

The rest of the warriors were startled to see this bloody scene and subconsciously took a few steps back.

“Thirty seconds, if you don’t leave this place, you’ll stay here forever.” Baili Haoling showed no mercy and continued to say in a cold voice.

The guy looked at his elbow that was completely twisted and gritted his teeth at this moment to endure the pain as he hurriedly ran away.

Because he knew that if he didn’t leave, that young-looking examiner would really kill him!

‘No. 2, Zhang Qi!”

At this moment, no one dared to say a word and quickly queued up for the test.

“Are you an examiner?” When it was Lin Xiu’s turn, he asked Baili Haoling.

He never thought that Baili Haoling would actually be an examiner of this exam!

“That’s right, I’m a three-star member of the Warrior Union,” Baili Haoling smiled and said.
