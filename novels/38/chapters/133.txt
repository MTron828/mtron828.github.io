Chapter 134: Oasis

Was it because of the environment here?

Although he didn’t know why the ‘Cultivation technique’ was so much more effective than before, Lin Xiu didn’t think much about it and continued to practice.

However, in the middle of the night, as Lin Xiu was practicing, he suddenly felt a lot of gravel blowing to his side and sand was hitting against his face which hurt him slightly.

What’s going on?

Lin Xiu, who was originally in the state of cultivation, immediately came to his senses. He squinted and realized that a wild wind was starting to blow as a large amount of sand was hitting his face like a sandstorm was coming.

The strange creature standing on his shoulder also used its small hands to hug its body.

“Get into the backpack first, don’t eat my Odd Crystals ah.” Lin Xiu took the little thing off his shoulder at this moment.

It seemed to understand Lin Xiu’s words and jumped into the backpack.

Lin Xiu stood up and carried the spear box again then turned around and ran in the other direction.

Because he realized that there was a huge tornado-like thing ahead.

Sandstorm!

Looks like anything could happen when one is down on his luck. He fell into the relics that day and not long after he came out, there was this darn sandstorm.

Lin Xiu had run in the other direction and stayed away from the center of the tornado.

He ran as quickly as he could and gradually began to feel that the wind wasn’t blowing so hard.

He just had to stay away from the eye of the storm, the other things didn’t really affect him much.

After the scare, Lin Xiu no longer felt sleepy.

He kept moving forward and there were some strange scorpions and other monsters on the ground from time to time, but they were all around rank 3 and Lin Xiu killed them all easily.

Over the past few days, Lin Xiu had been killing evolved beasts, collecting Odd Crystals while continuing to move forward.

Walking to the front, Lin Xiu found that with the wild wind blowing, some of the skeletons hidden under the gravel could now be seen clearly.

Skeletons of the warriors, the desert was full of warriors’ skeletons.

It was indeed the Path of death, it looked like the entire place was a desert but who would have thought that there were so many skeletons buried?

Some of the bones had a lot of gold little bugs on them like they were slowly gnawing on the bones.

A bone-eating bug?

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and simply released a flaming bird but these darn things seemed to have some kind of resistance to the flames – there was no effect on them at all.

Instead, the flame seemed to enrage them and at this moment, although there was a wild wind, they still charged toward Lin Xiu.

Damn!

Lin Xiu cursed, then hurried away.

There were too many strange things in this desert.

A week went by very quickly and Lin Xiu had been moving forward in this desert during this week.

The desert was simply too vast, he hardly saw anyone.

“Rollie, how many of my Odd crystals have you eaten!” Lin Xiu was holding the Dark Edge spear at this moment and after killing a huge sandworm, he dug out an Odd Crystal from its body and said to the light blue ball who had its mouth full.

Lin Xiu realized that this thing had a mouth recently which looked like a crack. However, if it didn’t open its mouth, you wouldn’t notice it at all.

Its body was very round so Lin Xiu decided to call it Rollie.

Rollie was gnawing happily on an Odd Crystal at this moment.

Lin Xiu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry at this scene but his backpack was full of rank 3 Odd Crystals so he didn’t mind letting Rollie eat some.

Lin Xiu was so bored these days.

There was no end in sight in this desert and he only had this little thing to keep him company.

But to Lin Xiu’s delight, this little thing looked round, but it runs very fast like a little pet. While Lin Xiu killed those evolved beasts, Rollie dug out those Odd Crystals from their bodies.

It saved him a lot of time.

“Where is the end to this desert ah…” Lin Xiu continued moving forward and sighed.

A week, he had been in this desert for a week and there was still no end in sight, he didn’t even see any human being around.

He ate nutrients all day to replenish his energy until he wanted to puke.

Not long after he continued his journey, Lin Xiu seemed to vaguely spot an oasis ahead.

Seeing this, Lin Xiu rubbed his eyes. He had been seeing mirages these days – this shouldn’t be an illusion, right?

After hesitating for a moment, Lin Xiu continued to walk forward.

But when he reached there, he was pleasantly surprised by the sight.

Oasis! It’s really an oasis!

And in the middle, there’s a lake!

It was simply a surprise!

Lin Xiu was happily walking to the lake at this moment and wanted to jump directly into it when he noticed a cold flash.

Dang——

Lin Xiu waved his long spear and in the next moment, the long sword directly hit that cold light, giving off a crisp and clear sound.

There’s someone!?

And he did not sense it at all, so it seemed that this person was clearly stronger than him.

Sword, this was a very sharp long sword.

As the sword came mangling, the sound of metal clanging resounded.

Lin Xiu’s arms felt sputtered by the sword’s aura and his skin seemed to crack a little.

Lin Xiu felt a tingling feeling.

What an amazing sword technique!

“Hng!” Lin Xiu snorted coldly at this moment and also became serious. His long spear thrust over crazily and spots of cold light appeared! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

It was like his surroundings had turned into a sea of stars!

But the sword-wielding person’s sword technique was also very strong, he even managed to dodge all of Lin Xiu’s attacks.

She was very fast and was hidden among the surrounding trees. Lin Xiu couldn’t really see this person and could only rely on his senses to attack desperately.

To Lin Xiu’s surprise, however, this person seemed to grow weaker as he continued to attack.

He didn’t know what was going on, but it was a really good opportunity!

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!

This time, his attack finally messed up the other person’s sword technique.

Just as Lin Xiu was about to stab the figure in the next blow, he froze.

Although he couldn’t see her face, Lin Xiu found her outfit quite familiar. Could it be… her?

“It’s you!?”
