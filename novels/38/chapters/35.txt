Chapter 36: Get Ready To Set Off!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

When Lin Xiu returned to the city center once again, those dead bodies were gone. Someone had already cleared them up.

After buying whatever he needed, Lin Xiu returned to the dorm.

Not long after he returned, the computer made a sound.

Lin Xiu was stunned, then instinctively pressed on it.

‘Connecting…’

“Brother Lin Xiu!”

Very soon, when the top of the screen indicated that the connection was successful, a young girl’s voice was projected instantly before him.

“So it’s Shuang’er.” Lin Xiu was startled and came to his senses at this moment. The future world had long replaced video chats with holographic projection.

It seemed like Ye Shuang’er was standing right in front of him and Lin Xiu couldn’t help but exclaim at the power of technology.

“What’s up?” Lin Xiu smiled and asked.

“You…” Ye Shuang’er appeared a little shy and was hesitant to speak.

“I’ll do it, I’ll do it. Shuang’er wants to ask if you’re free this weekend, she wants to ask you out!” At this moment, another cute young girl’s projection appeared and she smiled.

“Nonsense!” Ye Shuang’er’s face turned red, then she pinched the other girl’s slightly chubby cheeks.

The two girls began fighting.

“Hey, hey, hey, be careful of exposing yourself.” The two girls appeared to be in their dorms and were dressed in very thin pajamas.

“Ah!” That girl with chubby cheeks exclaimed when she heard Lin Xiu. She couldn’t help but blush. Very soon, her holographic projection was gone.

“Don’t listen to her nonsense. I merely wanted to ask if you’ll be free this weekend to tutor me.” Ye Shuang’er asked.

Warriors were respected ones in the future world, but other knowledge was still required to get into the academy.

Also, the content of learning was more complex.

“However, I might need to leave Xing Yao city for a period of time and won’t be free.” Lin Xiu said.

He didn’t say that he was going to Guang Ming fort. Otherwise, this girl was going to be worried again.

“Ah? Where are you going!?” Ye Shuang’er was stunned and asked.

“Hm… I’ll be going to an academy in other provinces for an exchange program.” Lin Xiu lied.

“Oh, alright then!” Ye Shuang’er was slightly disappointed but still smiled sweetly.

Time flew by. Early in the next morning, Lin Xiu took the maglev train to the airport with Luo Li.

After they arrived at the airport and passed through the security, they could see many soldiers in battle robes over at that side.

“Lin Xiu, be careful. You must return safely.” Luo Li looked at Lin Xiu who had already changed into his battle robe and said seriously.

Actually, when the academy announced this punishment, Luo Li was enraged. Letting a student take part in the clean-up operation at the Guang Ming fort was basically pushing him to his death, right?

However, he calmed down after that. He couldn’t do anything about it unless Lin Xiu dared to drop out of school. But if he did, his future would really be ruined.

“Don’t worry, I’ll come back for sure.” Lin Xiu took a deep breath and said in a serious manner.

“I will come back within a month.”

In this world, power was everything. If you became a rank 5 warrior, you would get a special status recognized even by the federal government.

“You’re Lin Xiu?” Just then, a tall and muscular man dressed in camouflage battle robe walked over and spoke to Lin Xiu with knitted brows.

“Yes.” Lin Xiu nodded and instinctively activated the Analytic Eye. However, he realized that he couldn’t analyze this man.

He should be a warrior rank 3 and above.

“Oh right, this is Captain Qin Qiang. He is one of the people in charge of this mission.” Luo Li introduced.

Qin Qiang appeared to recognize Luo Li and nodded at him. Then, he glanced at Lin Xiu and said coldly, “We’re not going there for fun, you might lose your life.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He walked towards the other side after speaking.

“He’s like that, don’t mind him.” Luo Li smiled at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded and after saying goodbye to Luo Li, he carried the box containing the Silver Immortal Soul and walked over.

“Gather! We’ll begin the roll call now!” Over at the field outside, Qin Qiang and a few other high-ranking warriors were already standing there.

After several names were called out, Lin Xiu finally heard his own name.

After that, he also jogged over like those people.

Those soldiers wearing camouflage battle robes were stunned when they saw a young man standing next to them and broke out in laughter.

“Little friend, are you in the wrong team?” A bulky man curled his lips and mocked.

The lowest ranking for this mission was a rank 1 warrior and this boy who looked like a high school student was joining them – is he courting death?

Lin Xiu glanced askance at him and didn’t say a word.

“Be serious!” Qin Qiang furrowed his brows and yelled sternly.

These soldiers appeared to still be afraid of Qin Qiang and when they heard what he said, they straightened up and didn’t dare to speak anymore.

After Qin Qiang saw that everyone was in place, he said, “Our Xing Yao city sent a total of four teams this time, a total of 40 warriors…”

“Sir, there seems to be someone in our team who isn’t a warrior!” A man spoke up.

Those soldiers guffawed when they heard his words.

“You and those who laughed. Do 100 push-ups on the spot and complete them within five minutes.” Qin Qiang ordered coldly.

Those soldiers were stunned and somewhat annoyed. But they still quickly did the push-ups according to Qin Qiang’s order.

“You may be a student from Xing Yao academy, but as long as you’re a part of this mission, you’re no different from them and you must always be conscious of death. Do you understand!?” Qin Qiang looked at Lin Xiu at this moment and said coldly.

“Yes!”

Lin Xiu knew that the federal army’s rules were very strict and could be said to be even stricter than the rules of the world he was in before he transmigrated. At this moment, he stood at the same spot obediently.

Five minutes went by very quickly and that scarily huge plane had already extended its stairs out automatically.

“The plane will be taking off soon. Are you guys ready?” Qin Qiang’s gaze swept across these young faces as he shouted.

“Ready!”
