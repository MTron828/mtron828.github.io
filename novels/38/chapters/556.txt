Chapter 557: Kill the Rank 8!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Bang bang bang-

These long swords quickly stabbed Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, causing Lin Xiu, who rushed over, to retreat back due to the huge impact.

Another diamond skill!

Through his ‘Sphere’, Lin Xiu saw all those long swords flying over and he couldn’t see the middle-aged man at all.

However, the long swords flying over were too terrifying. Lin Xiu could only maintain the ‘Sphere’ and let the ‘Sphere’ resist these stabbed long swords.

In the next second, as these long swords disappeared, the figure of the middle-aged man instantly appeared in front of him!

He held a long sword in both hands and it actually had a purple light.

Before Lin Xiu could react, he directly slashed down with his long sword from top to bottom!

Boom–

Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ was cut open at this moment!

How can this be!?

It was the first time that Lin Xiu saw someone other than himself using a skill that could break the ‘Sphere’.

The long sword stabbed in through the broken hole and it seemed that it was about to pierce Lin Xiu’s neck.

“Die!!!”

The middle-aged man exerted all his strength and he was about to pierce Lin Xiu’s neck from his long sword!

But at this time, Lin Xiu directly grabbed the body of the long sword with both hands, preventing it from stabbing.

Si si—

Under the friction between the long sword and the glove, sparks appeared.

The middle-aged man was too strong. Lin Xiu clenched the sword tightly with his hands but it was still inching forward, about to stab Lin Xiu’s neck!

The strong sword aura made Lin Xiu feel a tingling sensation in his neck and a slight cut appeared on the skin of his neck.

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed, he grabbed his long sword and stabbed directly at his body!

The middle-aged man didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would actually do that!

However, it wasn’t Lin Xiu’s neck that was stabbed, but his shoulder!

“You…”

The middle-aged man was obviously shocked by Lin Xiu’s action.

“Go to hell!”

Lin Xiu slammed his fist directly on his body again, hitting the same spot.

This time, the man flew straight out like a broken kite and fell into the water.

Lin Xiu’s expression remained unchanged, he directly pulled out the long sword stuck on his shoulder with force and threw it on the ground. Then, his figure moved in a flash and he jumped into the water.

The middle-aged man who was hit by Lin Xiu and fell into the water, slowly came to his senses after sinking to the bottom and quickly tried to swim to the surface.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu appeared underwater, grabbed his clothes and pulled his body back!

The middle-aged man had already suffered a lot of injuries because he was punched by Lin Xiu. At this time, he was punched again by Lin Xiu and he was a little weak.

The middle-aged man looked at Lin Xiu in the water and reached out to attack Lin Xiu’s body.

However, it was easily dodged by Lin Xiu.

The two fought frantically in the water, but the rank 8 warrior was obviously powerless.

Not only because of physical injuries, but also because fighting in the water consumes a lot of oxygen. Now he felt a little out of breath!

When he was dodging Lin Xiu’s attack, he was going to swim up the water, but Lin Xiu wouldn’t let him go so easily!

Lin Xiu, who was as nimble as a fish, swam directly beside him, then dragged him to the bottom again.

The middle-aged man opened his eyes wide. He didn’t expect that Lin Xiu wouldn’t be deprived of oxygen at all. Except for the fact that the resistance of the water had used up a lot of energy, Lin Xiu seemed perfectly fine!

Click——

Lin Xiu put his hands on his arm, then with a sudden force, he broke his arm!

“Uuuuuu-“

The middle-aged man frantically struggled to swim up. Now, he already felt that his vision was blurred due to the lack of oxygen in his head.

Now his body was even weaker.

Lin Xiu took advantage of this to kill him!

Lin Xiu didn’t stop attacking, instead, the attack became even more severe!

Bang bang bang-

Lin Xiu attacked him frantically, one punch after another, hitting his body firmly.

The middle-aged man completely lost the strength to resist and was killed by Lin Xiu underwater.

At this time, there were wounds all over his body and Lin Xiu even broke his hands.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for killing the rank 8 warrior and gaining experience…”

When the system’s prompt sounded, Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief and was left with no energy at all.

He slowly sank under the water, lying on the soft soil.

For Lin Xiu, there wasn’t a huge difference between being underwater and on land. So Lin Xiu closed his eyes and an overwhelming sense of exhaustion made Lin Xiu fall into a deep sleep.

Those evolved beasts seemed to be a little afraid of Lin Xiu and did not surround Lin Xiu.

At the same time, the blood flowing from the middle-aged man’s body attracted a lot of fish. It didn’t take long for the middle-aged man’s body to become bones.

No one would have thought that a rank 8 warrior would die tragically underwater.

After some time, when Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, he found that the sun was shining through the lake.

It made the bottom of the water a little brighter.

Ok…

Lin Xiu rubbed his eyes and in the next moment, he woke up.

It turns out that it’s already morning…

The after-effects of that ‘Fury’ had completely disappeared at this time.

Lin Xiu felt that his body was full of vitality.

When he looked ahead, he could clearly see a white skeleton.

It must be the rank 8 warrior.

He definitely didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would be the same in water as he is on land. But he couldn’t and still needed to breathe just like ordinary people.

Oh right, how much experience did he gain?

Lin Xiu hasn’t killed a rank 8 warrior before and he didn’t know how much experience he has gained.

He entered into his system directly and after checking the information, his eyes widened. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

One hundred billion…!?

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened in disbelief.

However, this hundred billion was not the experience of killing the rank 8 warrior, but the experience obtained from killing a rank 8 warrior for the first time!

This 100 billion experience has directly helped him to level up!
