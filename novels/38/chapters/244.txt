Chapter 245: Dark Forest

Hearing Tian Zixia’s words, Lin Xiu’s gaze suddenly changed as he stared at her and asked, “What do you mean?”

Lin Xiu also had a weird feeling today. Luo Yue seemed to have disappeared early in the morning and he hasn’t seen her at all, which gave Lin Xiu a strange feeling.

“Dark Forest, someone from the Luo family was killed there. She probably went there to save that person.” Tian Zixia looked at Lin Xiu and said.

Hearing Tian Zixia’s words, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said, “What do you get from telling me this?”

Lin Xiu knew that this girl hated him deeply, so she must have something to gain from telling him this information.

“Nothing, just wanted to remind you.” Tian Zixia snorted and said.

“Also, at the end of year’s competition, our Class 1 of the North Campus Class will definitely wash away all the shame we had before.”

As soon as Tian Zixia said that, she left.

Lin Xiu frowned slightly – Luo Yue went to the Dark Forest?

‘Where is that?’

He shook his head, then returned to his villa.

If it was in the past, Luo Yue would be practicing in the training room on this side of the hall at this timing.

But she was not seen and the place looked a little empty.

Lin Xiu looked around then took out the diamond skill card he had just obtained and looked at it.

A man’s wealth is his own ruin by causing other’s greed.

Lin Xiu understood this truth. This was a very precious body skill card for any warrior, especially Ouyang Hang, so he was probably very mad.

This was probably passed down to him from his family for him to use when he reaches rank 6.

Lin Xiu shook his head and walked back to his room.

“Gu?”

Rollie was lying on the table in Lin Xiu’s room, nibbling on an Odd crystal. At this moment, seeing Lin Xiu coming over, he stood up.

“You little guy.” Lin Xiu didn’t know where Rollie got this Odd crystal from and wanted to laugh and cry at the same time as he pinched its chubby body. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Until now, Lin Xiu was still very curious about Rollie but he couldn’t find anything about it.

Lin Xiu was still very curious about how it formed and appeared.

At this time, he didn’t think much about this because he still remembered what Tian Zixia said just now.

Luo Yue went to the Dark Forest.

‘Dark Forest, where is this place?’

Lin Xiu thought about it, then sat in the chair and started the computer.

“Dark Forest…”

After logging into the Warrior Union website, Lin Xiu managed to find out information about the Dark Forest easily.

“There is even a special area?”

Lin Xiu was stunned when he clicked in and read.

On the Warrior Union website, there was also a section about the Dark Forest.

[Dark Forest: S Grade]

Recommended warrior’s rank: Rank 6 and above

Seeing the S-grade sign, Lin Xiu’s gaze changed.

The dangerous areas on earth were graded according to the degree of danger and SSS-grade was the most dangerous. However, there were only one or two dangerous areas on earth that could be called SSS-grade and the lowest was D-grade.

The G17 Ruin he went to before was only B-grade.

But this Dark Forest turned out to be an S-grade area!

One could imagine the degree of danger over there.

“A huge space crack appeared in the last century, there were a large number of plants and creatures that fell from another dimension. The area continued to expand, forming a terrifying forest.”

Lin Xiu looked at the information in this area and read out to himself.

Rollie jumped on Lin Xiu’s shoulder at this time and looked at the information on the screen curiously.

But Lin Xiu felt a little annoyed when he thought about how Luo Yue left without saying goodbye.

“This chick, he must beat her ass when she comes back.”

Lin Xiu said aloud at this time.

But that was just what he said, if Lin Xiu had to really do it, he probably would be beaten to death by her.

Lin Xiu shook his head, then laid on the bed after taking a shower.

Today’s battle had completely exhausted him.

It didn’t take long for Lin Xiu to fall asleep.

Time passed quickly and it was the next day. Lin Xiu got up early and after washing up, he returned to the academy again.

The Sacred Region Academy basically allows its students to be in a “free-range” environment.

As long as the final exam was over, they wouldn’t interfere with the students during the remaining time.

After opening the door of the training room, Lin Xiu walked into the gravity room.

Lin Xiu came very early today so there was no one around yet.

Lin Xiu wouldn’t give up on training in the gravity room.

It was very helpful for improving his strength.

Lin Xiu Inserted the card directly and started.

Soon, after a series of tapping on the keyboard, Lin Xiu quickly adjusted all the settings.

“Under the state of seven times the gravity, there should be no problem with training…”

Lin Xiu thought so and the machine started up instantly.

The gravity around him suddenly became seven times the gravity!

This gravitational superposition was not a simple superposition. The difference between six times and seven times was very big.

Lin Xiu felt a little uncomfortable being oppressed all of a sudden.

“Hu.” Lin Xiu took a deep breath at this time. After unlocking the rank 2 gene lock, the organs and cells in his body had actually undergone qualitative changes.

Boom boom——

The machine on the ceiling started to spin again at this time.

Soon, a lot of laser beams shot towards Lin Xiu!

It attacked in all directions.

And the ground was made of special materials, so those laser rays would be reflected when they hit the ground.

Therefore, to dodge the completely was a test of a person’s ability to react.

Lin Xiu was very focused at this time and kept dodging.

“Big brother Xiu seems a little weird.” This morning, Lin Xiu seemed to be frantically training. So Jiang Li and the others commented when they saw this scene.

“Indeed,” Zhang Yin also nodded. He always felt that Lin Xiu didn’t seem right after the battle yesterday.

At this moment, outside the door, there were a few guys and girls in light blue uniforms walking towards them.

“Excuse me, are you students from Class 10 of the South Campus?” A girl said while looking at Zhang Yin and the others.

At this moment, the students from Class 10 of the South Campus in the training room all looked towards them.
