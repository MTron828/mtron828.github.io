1297 Luo Yue, God Warrior

While speaking aloud, Luo Yue pointed the thin-winged sword in her hand at the tiger-headed beast’s corpse and an odd crystal emitting purple light was taken into Luo Yue’s hands.

This tiger-headed beast was a god-level evolved beast and this odd crystal was of course also a god-level odd crystal.

“It was a competition held by the god king of Lingzhou to confer the new god king. You were brought from the earth by your senior sister. Unlike ordinary warriors, you can’t participate without city management.”

When the woman heard Luo Yue’s words, she said helplessly.

Hearing her words, Luo Yue fell silent for a moment.

“There is something I want there.”

In this competition, there were some material rewards, which was what she wanted.

It has been quite a long time since she came to the God warrior Realm. With daily training, coupled with the resources provided here, Luo Yue’s strength at this time has also reached the God warrior level.

“Master wouldn’t let you go…”

The woman smiled wryly at this time and said helplessly.

Hearing the word “Master”, Luo Yue frowned. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“The Battle of Gods is about to start again, so if you can reach the top 100 this time, the master will let you have more freedom.”

The woman seemed to think of something at this time, then said with a smile.

“I hope so.”

Luo Yue nodded slightly and the thin-winged long sword in her hand was indeed clenched tightly.

Her strength is not enough. As long as her strength continues to increase, no one can stop her.

and…

At this time, Luo Yue was looking into the distance and there seemed to be a blank look in her eyes.

You, will you come to me?

The woman behind Luo Yue looked at Luo Yue’s expression and couldn’t help showing curiosity in her eyes.

Luo Yue was always cold when she came here and it was the first time she saw Luo Yue showing such an expression.

Is she missing her family?

Maybe, it is said that she was brought back from a certain planet by her senior sister…

At the same time, Lin Xiu, who was on the other side of City of God, had already stabbed Lu Kai’s ‘Sphere’ with the White Moon spear in his hand!

That black dragon also crazily charged onto his ‘Sphere’.

Boom——

At this time, an extremely loud sound erupted.

Although the tip of the spear and the black dragon didn’t directly explode his ‘Sphere’, but at this time his body was directly blown to the back because of the huge impact force generated by the spear .

Poof——

Lu Kai managed to stabilize his body, but felt a sweetness in his throat and spit out a mouthful of blood.

Taking a closer look, the ‘Sphere’ he unfolded has a lot of cracks!

“Impossible… This is impossible…”

Lu Kai was still bleeding from his mouth, staring at Lin Xiu and said to himself.

His ‘Sphere’ was so damaged that it was about to burst!

And at this moment, he watched Lin Xiu continue to rush towards him and the pupils in his eyes suddenly shrank.

He gritted his teeth violently and with a thought triggered, the source strength in his whole body exploded again.

And the power that erupted this time is domain power!

“Humph!”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu snorted coldly. While attacking with the White Moon spear, with a thought, the ‘Purification Domain’ was released!

With the release of ‘Purification Domain’, the domain power that Lu Kai had just released was immediately covered by white energy.

“My domain…”

Lu Kai, who originally wanted to rely on his domain power to make a desperate move, now looked even nastier.

‘Profound Intent·Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!

And Lin Xiu, holding the White Moon spear, rushed over at this time!

Torrential storm of rose flowers’ This skill, although it only was a silver-level warrior card when it was first obtained.

But as Lin Xiu’s strength continued to improve, he became proficient in using this skill.

In addition, now that he has comprehended the profound intent of this skill, the power that Lin Xiu unleashes when he uses it is not weak at all!

“what!!!”

Seeing the shadows of thousands of spears stabbing him, Lu Kai roared angrily.

The strength of the whole body was crazily overdrawn, strengthening his ‘Sphere’.

Because he knew that the current him has no way to dodge. He can only use his own strength to continue to strengthen the ‘Sphere’ that has already had a lot of cracks.

Use it to resist Lin Xiu’s attack.

Bang bang bang——

The next moment, Lin Xiu’s attack had already hit his ‘Sphere’.

...

At this time, with the explosion of loud noises, the ‘Sphere’ that he had strengthened with all his strength exploded directly.

“I surrender!!!”

Seeing his ‘Sphere’ burst and the tip of the spear was about to pierce his body, the man roared loudly.

Whoosh—

The tip of the spear stopped directly in front of his forehead.

At this time, Lu Kai’s whole body seemed to be frozen and the huge black sickle in his hand also fell directly to the ground at this time.

“never mind.”

Lin Xiu looked at Lu Kai, then put down the White Moon spear in his hand.

Now that he has spoken, Lin Xiu couldn’t kill him.

“No. 99 wins!”

At this time, the referee announced the result.

...

After the verdict was pronounced, Lu Kai’s body also fell directly to the ground.

The battle just now really consumed all the strength in his whole body.

“Won again!”

Seeing Lin Xiu win, Lei Tong said excitedly.

Moreover, Lin Xiu won easily and didn’t appear to have erupted with any powerful force yet.

In this case, it will be quite beneficial to the next battle.

“What we are dealing with now is still relatively weak.”

At this time, Baili Haoling said lightly.

Now Lin Xiu is dealing with warriors who also won a battle.

Next, Lin Xiu will deal with warriors who have won two games and then, he will deal with warriors who have won three games…

So, the warriors he will need to deal with next will definitely be stronger and stronger.

It is not easy to win ten consecutive victories.

And once he loses a game in the middle, it’s over!

“Xiao Qingchen of Tianhu City has already won six games in a row, and the chance of qualifying is also very high.”

At the same time, Wan Gan on the rostrum, seeing the current battle situation, couldn’t help but stroke his beard and said.

Zhang Qinghua also nodded slightly, and his eyes glanced at Noble god Riyan beside him.

Seeing Noble god Riyan’s satisfied expression, Zhang Qinghua also said, “Xiao Qingchen of Tianhu City not only has a red-level divine soul but also has been trained by the fire of chaos. His strength is indeed very strong.”

“Oh, trained by the fire of chaos?”

The expression on Noble god Riyan’s face finally changed a little at this time.

At this time, his eyes looked at Xiao Qingchen, who was on the platform, and there was curiosity in his eyes.
