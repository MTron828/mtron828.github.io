Chapter 162: Three Feet In Ice

“Your body skill has a pattern,” Lin Xiu was leaning on the Dark Edge spear at this moment and stood upright slowly, looking at Yu Yi.

A pattern!? Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Yu Yi’s gaze changed.

This guy managed to figure out the way he used his body skill and where he would stop in the next moment.

This observation skill… was simply terrifying.

“Very well, I decided to fight you seriously now.” Yu Yi sneered.

At this moment, his whole body tensed up. He held the long sword in his hand tightly and as soon as he exerted force through his legs, he rushed towards Lin Xiu!

The source strength was released, covering his body and weapons, and his speed seemed to have reached the extreme!

What an incredible speed!!

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted and he instinctively leaned his body to one side.

Swish——

A tingling sensation came and a bloodstain appeared on Lin Xiu’s arm in an instant.

“Oh? You dodged it?” Yu Yi was a little surprised and he continued to attack Lin Xiu with his sword!

Lin Xiu rolled backward and ducked at the other side of the arena.

There was blood flowing out of the area where Lin Xiu got cut.

The tingling sensation did not scare Lin Xiu but made his blood boil instead.

It has been a long time since he met such a strong opponent…!!!

Yu Yi frowned as he looked at Lin Xiu.

The strength of this kid was obviously much lower than him. Why, why does he still show such a strong fighting spirit?

At this moment, he was also irritated. He held the hilt in his right hand tightly and attacked Lin Xiu again!

Lin Xiu was startled and became even more alert.

Dang dang dang——

When the two weapons collided, a sound rang out one after another.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu could clearly feel his hands getting numb.

He only held the sword in one hand, but it was amazing that he possessed such a powerful force.

Can’t go on like this…

Swish——

With Yu Yi’s swift sword movements, Lin Xiu had many scars on his body, and his clothes became a bit tattered.

“Ah!!!” Lin Xiu let out a loud roar at this time, the system’s rage build-up was already full.

This blow could bring out 200 percent of its power!

“Hng!” Yu Yi snorted coldly, swinging the long sword in his hand. He thought that he could withstand Lin Xiu’s attack as easily as before.

But what he didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu’s strength in this blow would be so strong that the long sword in his hand was almost about to fly out.

Bang——

This huge impact caused him to take several steps back.

How could it be! How could he suddenly emit such a powerful force!?

Yu Yi looked at Lin Xiu in disbelief.

Lin Xiu also gritted his teeth and looked at Yu Yi at this time. Lin Xiu did not cause him any harm at all. The strength of this rank 5 warrior was indeed a bit too strong…

“I’ve decided to end this game.” Yu Yi didn’t know why but he felt flustered.

He had a hunch that if he continued fighting, it may have an adverse effect on him.

Without any hesitation, he attacked Lin Xiu with his sword!

The second he rushed over, layers of thin ice slowly appeared on the long sword in his hand.

With him as the center, the surrounding air seemed to have become colder all of a sudden.

Gold skill- ‘Three Feet in Ice’!

Lin Xiu watched this scene with the Dark edge spear in his hands, his body leaped suddenly, and the spear attacked him from top to bottom.

The scene looked as if a galaxy of stars appeared, it was exceptionally gorgeous.

The students who watched the live broadcast held their breath at this time.

“Ninth Heaven… Galaxy Fall!” Lin Xiu roared, then stabbed down!

Boom——

The long sword and the long spear collided, giving off a loud noise and the entire ground was shaken.

Even the live broadcast shook violently at this moment.

The screen flickered for a while and nobody could see what had just happened.

“Can this freshman’s skill… defeat Yu Yi?” Although the students were merely watching the live broadcast, they were shocked when they saw this terrifying scene and were shocked even when they were not there.

“Although your skill is quite strong, it’s still not enough.” At this moment, with the live broadcast slowly returning to normal, they could see that Yu Yi was still standing, wiping the blood from his lips.

As for Lin Xiu on the opposite side, he seemed to be frozen by a huge block of ice!

Lin Xiu was in the ice block and was still in the same attacking pose.

But his body couldn’t move at all.

The gold ice-type skill, combined with the powerful source strength of a rank 5 warrior gave quite an amazing effect.

At this moment, not only was Lin Xiu frozen but a thin layer of ice appeared on the surrounding ground.

“Amazing… this is the power of a rank 5 warrior?”

Seeing Yu Yi’s figure on the big screen, these people were completely shocked.

“Haha, I guess this freshman is nothing more than this. He’s probably just lucky and managed to go up, huh? Sure enough, a class 10 student will be a class 10 student, he is still incomparable to Boss.” The man standing next to Zhuo Qixing looked at the screen and laughed.

“No, I don’t think it’s over yet.” Zhuo Qixing shook his head, still staring at Lin Xiu in the live broadcast.

He had a feeling that this person had not been completely defeated.

“Is this considered a victory for me?” Yu Yi, who was standing in the arena, looked at a referee on the opposite side and asked.

“No, if he can’t fight back within ten seconds, then you won.

“Or if he leaves the arena.”

“Oh?” Yu Yi looked at Lin Xiu and walked over.

As long as he kicked the ice block and Lin Xiu off the arena, then he could win immediately.

With that thought, the corners of his mouth couldn’t help but curl up.

“Although you’re a good opponent, it is a pity that you can only reach this level.” Yu Yi smiled and when he approached the frozen Lin Xiu, his legs stretched out as he kicked Lin Xiu down!!!

Click, click——

At this critical moment, a strange sound resounded.
