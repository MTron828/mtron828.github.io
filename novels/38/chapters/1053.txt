Chapter 1054: Another Five Sage Warriors

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“You talk a lot.”

Lin Xiu looked at Tang Qi.

He didn’t expect that Tang Qi hadn’t died yet.

With a wave of the Dark Edge spear in his hand, a dark blue flaming bird burst out directly.

Then it charged toward Tang Qi!

boom boom boom —

As the flaming bird burst out, the surrounding air seemed to be distorted.

Tang Qi’s eyes widened when he saw this scene and his eyes were full of horror.

“How dare you, kid!”

The four Sage warriors in the air saw this scene and flew down at this time.

At the same time, they released their own source strength and formed a huge barrier.

Boom—

This barrier directly blocked the flames released by Lin Xiu.

Tang Qi was out of breath at this moment and there was a look of panic in his eyes.

He was really afraid that Lin Xiu would kill him directly.

Those flames are really terrifying.

“You will pay the price.”

Tang Qing also walked over to Tang Qi’s side at this time.

Looking at Lin Xiu, his eyes were filled with infinite killing intent.

If eyes could kill, Lin Xiu might have been killed many times.

Ji Mei also opened her mouth slightly at this time. In the matrix, she looked at everything around her with an unbelievable look.

Lin Xiu actually killed so many warriors.

Almost all of the warriors in the Tang Pavilion were slaughtered by Lin Xiu in this short period of time.

Although Ji Mei herself was also promoted to a Sage warrior-level warrior, it was impossible for her to do this.

Even if the Respected warrior level was one step lower than the Sage warrior, it is not so easy to deal with so many peak Respected warriors.

Moreover, the domain force released by Lin Xiu was very strange, as if it covered all the domains of other warriors.

Those more than 100 Respected warriors had no way to use their domain force at all, they could only use the source mark power to attack Lin Xiu.

And Lin Xiu seems to be proficient in the power of various attributes, so those source mark powers had little effect on Lin Xiu.

Coupled with Lin Xiu’s powerful defense.

There was simply… no weakness at all!

After Ji Mei analyzed it in her heart at this time, the expression in her eyes became even more shocked.

“Well… it’s another five Sage warriors.”

Lin Xiu looked at Tang Qing and the others and said aloud as if talking to himself.

“Father, you must kill him!”

Tang Qi was behind these warriors, his eyes fixed on Lin Xiu and he said.

“shut up!”

Hearing Tang Qi’s words, Tang Qing turned his head and shouted at him.

If Tang Qi hadn’t provoked this person, Tang Pavilion wouldn’t have been hurt so badly now.

But at this time there is no other way, Lin Xiu must die!

“Left and right guardians, the two elders are here and the strength of the boy is not ordinary, let’s be careful.”

Holding the long sword in his hand, Tang Qing looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“Why not kill them first?”

One of the guardians looked at Ji Mei’s side and immediately frowned.

“They can’t be killed.”

Tang Qing also said with an ugly face at this time.

There was no way to break through the matrix that surrounded Ji Mei and the others, so Tang Qi had no way to kill them.

“Kill this kid first.”

Elder Lin of Tang Pavilion said coldly at this time.

At this time, the five elders, including Tang Qing, quickly stood in five directions.

Looking at Lin Xiu, they seemed to be preparing to attack Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu stood in the middle without any movement.

He glanced at the people around him, his eyes narrowed slightly.

The ‘Fury’ skill was already used when killing the Five Elements Sage warriors.

Now is the cooldown time.

If he wanted to use it again, you had to use the ‘Reset’ skill first.

However, he didn’t have to be in a hurry.

“kill.”

While Tang Qing said coldly, he took the lead in attacking Lin Xiu!

His speed was very fast and he appeared in front of Lin Xiu in an instant.

The long sword in his hand, full of powerful source strength, slashed directly at Lin Xiu’s body.

Dang–

Lin Xiu sneered and the spear in his hand charged directly at it.

Under the collision of the long sword and the long spear, the powerful impact made Tang Qing take several steps back!

His hand seemed to go numb.

how can that be!

He was terrified and never thought that Lin Xiu’s power would be so powerful.

Whoosh whoosh—

While he was in shock, Lin Xiu had already stabbed with the spear in his hand!

The spear pierced out, as if thousands of cold lights flickered.

‘Sphere’!

When Tang Qing saw this scene, there was no way he could resist with a sword. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He could only roar in his heart and directly unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

As his ‘Sphere’ unfolded, the thousands of spear shadows that Lin Xiu stabbed directly hit his ‘Sphere’.

bang bang bang-

A dull sound kept ringing and a large number of cracks instantly appeared on Tang Qing’s ‘Sphere’.

“Courting death!”

What happened just now went by in a flash.

At this moment, the elders had already run over from the other side!

Their speed is very fast.

They attacked Lin Xiu from four directions!

These people were all holding swords and as their source strength was transferred to their swords, a dazzling light suddenly bloomed.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly when he saw this scene out of the corner of his eyes.

The spear in his hand did not stop moving and continued to wave the Dark Edge spear to attack Tang Qing!

“Stop!”

When Tang Qing saw the scene in front of him, his face was full of fear and he couldn’t help but let out a roar.

Because Lin Xiu’s spear is too sharp, at this time his ‘Sphere’ is already full of cracks!

As long as Lin Xiu continues to attack again, his ‘Sphere’ will also be broken!

Without the protection of the ‘Sphere’, he would be finished.

At this time, the four Sage warriors attacked and their weapons all attacked the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded.

It didn’t affect Lin Xiu at all.

The ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded perfectly blocked all their attacks.

Moreover, Lin Xiu ignored them and continued to hold the spear in his hand to kill Tang Qing first.

“I told you to stop!”

Just as Lin Xiu stabbed with his spear again, the four warriors roared and blocked directly in front of him.

At this moment, Tang Qing took advantage of this and stepped back directly to the other side.

Looking at Lin Xiu and the four Sage warriors fighting together in an instant, there was a look of fear in his eyes.

Tang Qing was panting, his ‘Sphere’ was almost broken by Lin Xiu just now.

This Lin Xiu was really too strong.

His eyes continued to look forward and Lin Xiu waved his spear frantically.

Fighting with four Sage warriors at the same time, he wasn’t losing at all!
