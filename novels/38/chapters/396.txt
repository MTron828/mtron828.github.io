Chapter 397: ‘Fury’ Becoming Stronger?

Following Yu Yi’s roar, at this moment, the long sword in his hand burst out with blue light and the whole body of the sword was frosty.

Boom–

The long sword slashed at the rushing flaming bird and a crescent-shaped sword aura flew out! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The flaming bird was directly chopped in half by the overbearing sword aura that had a frosty air!

This terrifying flame dissipated in the air in an instant.

“Do you think I haven’t prepared for your flame…” Yu Yi sneered, but at this moment, Yu Yi discovered that Lin Xiu had already disappeared!

Where is he!?

His eyes widened and the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

Just when he came to his senses and was about to turn around to look behind, he found that a cold light had flashed past.

Boom–

A huge force came directly!

Yu Yi felt as if he was hit by a truck. He flew out and hit the wall behind him with a loud crash.

“I’m sorry, you thought wrong.” Lin Xiu stood there and said lightly.

The other men in black were watching Lin Xiu cautiously. Just as they were about to attack Lin Xiu, Yu Yi had already struggled out of the broken wall.

“Damn…!” Yu Yi was a little embarrassed now, staring at Lin Xiu with his hands clenched tightly.

What happened! What happened! This guy is obviously still a rank 5 warrior, how could he become so strong!?

Yu Yi thought that he had been transformed into a cyborg and that the power of his body had reached the extreme, but it was still so difficult to deal with Lin Xiu.

Dang–

Yu Yi’s face became extremely nasty and at the next moment, he directly threw the long sword in his hand on the ground.

“Oh? Not using weapons anymore?” Lin Xiu looked at this scene, raised his brows, then said faintly.

“I’m going to be serious now.” Yu Yi said grimly.

Click, click, click——

In Yu Yi’s fist, several rays of cold light burst out in a flash.

Steel claws appeared in his fists at this time!

The claws were very sharp and they were stuck close to each of his fingers.

Lin Xiu frowned slightly because he could sense that Yu Yi was in a different state than before.

Swish——

Yu Yi moved in a flash like a shadow and appeared directly in front of Lin Xiu.

What kind of body skill is this!?

Before Lin Xiu had time to react, Yu Yi waved his hand abruptly and attacked Lin Xiu’s body!

Dang–

At this critical moment, Lin Xiu blocked his front with the body of the Dark Edge spear.

The body of the Dark Edge spear collided with Yu Yi’s body, accompanied by a large number of sparks.

Swish——

But at this time Yu Yi’s offensive was not over yet, with a sudden wave of the other hand, he continued to attack Lin Xiu!

Tear——

The claw directly hit Lin Xiu’s body and the clothes on Lin Xiu’s body were torn off in an instant.

On Lin Xiu’s chest, there were a few deep gashes.

The stinging sensation made Lin Xiu’s eyes widen. Just when Yu Yi wanted to continue to attack Lin Xiu, he found that there was a crackling sound in Lin Xiu’s body.

What is this!?

Yu Yi was startled. Before he had time to react, he discovered that a lot of lightning burst from Lin Xiu’s body!

Seeing this scene, Yu Yi stepped back.

Damn…

Lin Xiu clenched his teeth and resisted the sharp pain in his chest.

The long spear has an advantage over the long sword if there was a distance between them but this guy suddenly used his claws and was fighting in close combat, making it hard to use the long spear.

“So it’s lightning, huh. Hng…” Yu Yi, who had just been taken aback, found the ball of lightning covering Lin Xiu’s body and couldn’t help but sneer.

He was now a cyborg and his power source was related to electricity.

These bolts of lightning could be absorbed to replenish his body!

But Yu Yi looked at the wound on Lin Xiu’s body and was still a little surprised. According to the blow he had just made, even the body of a rank 6 warrior should be torn in half by his own claws!

But Lin Xiu’s body only had a claw mark!

The physical power of this guy is so terrifying!?

Swish——

After Lin Xiu spun the spear in his hand and grabbed it tightly, the lightning on his body became more intense!

With Lin Xiu as the center, the floor on the ground began to become scorched black.

At this moment, no one noticed that the white marks on the Dark Edge spear were all lit up, emitting a light blue light.

‘Fury’!

Lin Xiu did not hesitate now and used the Fury skill!

As soon as he used the violent Fury skill, Lin Xiu felt his physical strength increase exponentially.

What happened?!

Lin Xiu was also a little surprised at this time, his ‘Fury’ skill seemed to have become stronger…?

He didn’t have time to think about it. Right now, Yu Yi had already rushed over!

“Go to hell!!!” His sharp claws flashed with cold light and he attacked Lin Xiu’s body!

He wanted to tear Lin Xiu’s body into several pieces!

Crackling——

As soon as he got closer, the lightning surrounding Lin Xiu’s body flew over Yu Yi’s body.

But Yu Yi did not appear to be affected by these bolts of lightning at all and did not stop attacking at all.

How could it be!?

Lin Xiu was also shocked when he noticed this situation. The lightning on his body was comparable to high-voltage electricity, but it seemed that for Yu Yi, there was nothing at all!

“Go to hell!” Yu Yi’s claws had already hit Lin Xiu’s body!

Boom–

In the next instant, Lin Xiu’s body was directly torn into several pieces.

“Over there!” But Yu Yi was no longer the same Yu Yi. When he saw this scene, he reacted quickly.

Lin Xiu’s strange skill was like cloning, it was impossible for him to tear Lin Xiu apart so easily.

He turned around and saw that, sure enough, Lin Xiu’s figure had appeared behind him, attacking him with the Dark Edge spear.
