1162 City Lord

He quickly moved backwards. As he stared at his fist that had been blasted, he cried in agony.

He never thought that Lin Xiu could be someone so powerful.

Lin Xiu had merely touched his fist and it was enough to blast it off!

“How could you be so cruel?!”

The man’s face looked incredibly awful.

His eyes were locked onto Lin Xiu and he tightened his grip around the machete.

“I have already given you enough mercy by not killing him.”

Lin Xiu answered calmly.

This man had tried to kill him. If it wasn’t because Lin Xiu was in a good mood, the man would have died by now.

“Who are you?”

“Aren’t you afraid that I will report you to the pavilion master and he will arrest you?!”

The rest of the warriors have begun cleaning the wound for the other man who was injured. The muscular man continued speaking with Lin Xiu.

“No. He wouldn’t.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

The muscular man was confused and Lin Xiu immediately gave him the answer, “It’s because I am the City Lord of Lingxian City.”

The warrior’s heart trembled when he heard the answer.

This man….was the city lord of Lingxian City?!

The warriors were shocked.

Their eyes that were opened wide were filled with disbelief.

“One minute. You have one minute to get out of here.”

Lin Xiu warned them.

Lin Xiu wasn’t bothered with warriors that were of such low levels.

Even if he killed them, he wouldn’t get much EXP.

“Don’t you think that this is too much?”

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, the muscular man who was the leader of his group, looked pissed.

The reason why they visited Lingxian City was for the ruins.

They had just arrived at this city and were now getting chased out of it. They would obviously be mad about it.

“Are you going to leave or not?” F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Lin Xiu didn’t want to waste any time on them and he repeated his question.

At that moment, Lin Xiu had a clear murderous look in his eyes.

It caused chills to run down the spines of these men after seeing the look in his eyes.

They knew that this look was of a warrior who had done a lot of killings in the past.

It was terrifying!

“Hey! Zhang Zhen, why are you here?”

As they were trying to leave, a familiar voice came from behind them.

There was another group of warriors that came out of nowhere.

“Lin Qing?”

When the muscular man saw who it was, he was surprised.

He didn’t think that this man would be here as well.

“I just got the latest news that could help us find the ruins!”

The man, known as Lin Qing, had a smirk on his face.

“Where?”

Zhan Zheng asked subconsciously.

“I won’t be able to tell you that.”

Lin Qing shook his head.

They were two different parties who were trying to look for the ruins.

He had only gotten here to flaunt about what he knew.

“Hmph!”

Zhang Zhen was already mad and now he felt furious.

“Oh! Who’s this?”

Then, he saw Lin Xiu who was standing nearby.

“He’s saying that he is the City Lord of Lingxian City.”

Zhang Zhen answered instead.

Although this was what Lin Xiu said, Zhang Zhen still had trouble believing him.

“City Lord?”

Lin Qing frowned. He laughed as he looked at Lin Xiu.

“You’re really the City Lord?!”

Before Lin Xiu could answer him, the man continued, “Alright then. You shall bring me to the City Lord mansion.”

“Lin Qing, what are you trying to do?”

Zhang Zhen asked immediately once he heard what Lin Qing wanted.

“This is none of your business.”

Ling Qing glared at him without saying much.

“Perhaps….the ruins are in the City Lord Mansion?!”

Zhang Zhen seemed to have thought of something and quickly asked Lin Qing.

There was a sudden change in Lin Qing’s eyes and it quickly recovered.

But, Zhang Zhen obviously saw the changes in his eyes.

It was at the City Lord Mansion!

His heart was filled with excitement but the man standing before them obviously isn’t someone friendly.

“You should leave with that idiot of yours. This place doesn’t suit you.”

Lin Qing looked at the man whose fist had been blasted and started mocking Zhang Zhen.

“You…”

Zhang Zhen’s face turned dull.

“You should leave as well.”

“Lingxian City does not welcome you!”

Lin Xiu glanced at the new group before warning them.

“Hmm? We should leave just because you asked us to?”

Lin Qian then pointed his spear at Lin Xiu.

His eyes were still filled with disdain as he looked at Lin Xiu.

“Come on. Bring us to City Lord Mansion or else…”

Lin Xiu said coldly and looked at the warriors who were standing behind him.

At that moment, all of the warriors behind Lin Qing moved closer toward Lin Xiu.

They instantly surrounded Lin Xiu.

“City Lord!”

Suddenly, there were a group of guards that walked by.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was standing in the middle of the crowd, they quickly greeted him.

The warriors who were staring at Lin Xiu quickly tighten the grip around their weapons.

These past few days, Lin Xiu has been improving the city and even built a patrol team for the city.

These warriors were extremely respectful towards Lin Xiu ever since he destroyed the Tianlan Pavilion and released all the warriors who were enslaved at the mines.

“Oh? So you really are the City Lord of Lingxian City?”

Lin Qian glanced at Lin Xiu as he scoffed.

Even if Lin Xiu was the City Lord, it wasn’t a huge deal for Lin Qian.

“Move aside!”

The patrol team screamed in rage and was about to attack the warriors who were surrounding Lin Xiu!

“Move!”

Lin Qing screamed as he was about to attack the patrol team with his warrior skills.

Boom – –

However, as he swung his arms and released a ball of energy, Lin Xiu moved his right hand as well and a larger ball of energy went straight for Lin Qing.

There was a loud explosion that followed.

At the same time, Lin Qing’s body was thrown far into the distance. He landed on a metal pole behind him and instantly broke the metal pole.

“You’re a dead piece of meat!!”

The men that Lin Qing brought along were enraged and they started attacking Lin Xiu.

They held onto their weapons, ready to take Lin Xiu’s life!

Lin Xiu let out a cold laugh. Then, the long spear appeared in his hand.

‘Clean Sweep’!

With the movement of the long spear, the warrior’s that were closed to him had their bodies severed in halves!
