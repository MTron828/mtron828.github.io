Chapter 584: Break Through Two Floors in a Row!

These warriors were dumbfounded – how come there is still no change?

Logically speaking, after such a long time has passed, you would have been dead a long time ago.

If he failed, he should have come down, but now it shows that Lin Xiu is still challenging on the 91st floor. What does this mean?

These warriors were all puzzled.

Did something happen…

Qu Tingting also walked to the screen at this time, looking at Lin Xiu’s data with a worried look on her face.

She had already reached the 70th floor and when she got down, she found that Lin Xiu had reached the 91st floor!

When she found out about this, she was very shocked.

Because she has never seen anyone challenge the 90th floor since she came to the Tower of Trials.

Unexpectedly, Lin Xiu has already reached the 91st floor!

However, Lin Xiu stayed on the 91st floor for too long, so long that people found a little unbelievable.

While everyone outside was guessing about Lin Xiu’s condition, at this time Lin Xiu was still soaked in this magma.

The flesh and blood on the body had already been melted and even the bones could be seen.

But in the next moment, at a speed visible to the naked eye, he slowly began to heal.

The power of ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ lies in the ability to temper one’s body under any extreme conditions.

With Lin Xiu’s body that has already unlocked the gene lock twice, the current Lin Xiu’s flesh and blood seemed to have become more powerful!

Time continued to pass and Lin Xiu’s battle suit had been corroded to such an extent, but Lin Xiu’s body, on the contrary, slowly began to heal.

In the next moment, as Lin Xiu’s body completely healed as before, he opened his eyes immediately.

Lin Xiu’s eyes seemed to be more full of life than before.

It worked!?

Lin Xiu looked at his body and found that most of the battle suit had been corroded and only part of it was still attached to his body.

Now in this magma, Lin Xiu felt that his whole body was extremely hot, but he didn’t have the feeling of being corroded.

His body already has a strong resistance to such magma.

Although it was difficult to see clearly below, Lin Xiu still used his memory to pick up the Dark Edge spear nearby.

As soon as the body exerts force, the whole person swam upwards!

Boom–

As Lin Xiu floated above the magma, Lin Xiu saw that the surrounding area was submerged by the magma and the rocks that he could touch with his feet were not visible anymore.

But now this magma has no effect on Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu could only feel the heat now.

“Hm?”

But at this moment, Lin Xiu saw something that seemed to be swimming on the surface of the magma not far away.

What is that? Another flaming snake?

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then swam to the front.

Taking a closer look, it was found that it was indeed a flaming snake, but unlike the previous flaming snakes, the body of this flaming snake was a bit dazzling golden yellow.

Once the Analytic Eye was used, he found out that this was a mutant flaming snake.

And this mutant flaming snake was different from the flaming snakes just now. It did not attack Lin Xiu. Instead, it seemed that because Lin Xiu spotted it, it went directly under the magma, as if it wanted to escape!

“Want to flee!?”

Lin Xiu had already figured out what to do at this time and he swam directly below.

Now these magmas had no effect on Lin Xiu and because ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ and ‘Cultivation Technique’ had been running at the same time for one night, it has helped Lin Xiu forge a stronger body. Now Lin Xiu’s physical strength has also returned to its peak.

Soon, under the magma, Lin Xiu caught the mutant flaming snake.

Without any hesitation, as soon as the right hand exerted force, it directly crushed the head of this Flaming Snake!

As soon as he crushed the Flaming Snake’s head, Lin Xiu’s body was instantly covered with a layer of purple light.

And Lin Xiu’s body also disappeared in this layer.

“It’s moving! It’s moving!”

Some students who were paying attention to the information on the screen below the Tower of Trials got excited at this time.

Because the information displayed on the screen below was shown in real time according to the number of challenge floors, Lin Xiu was now ranked first, which made it very obvious.

The back shows: 92nd floor.

When Qu Tingting heard the voices of those students, she also subconsciously walked over to look.

After seeing that Lin Xiu had successfully completed the challenge and reached the 92nd floor, her eyes were full of disbelief.

“This guy… is really a monster.”

“Ten levels of hell, he has already passed two levels!”

The students around were all excited and were constantly discussing.

After all these years, very few people have been able to break through to this level.

“Huh? This kid has reached the 92nd floor?”

Dean Baili in his office, seeing this scene at this time, his eyes were full of surprise that could not be concealed.

Although he had always been optimistic about Lin Xiu before, he really did not expect Lin Xiu to reach this point.

“Sure enough, the youngsters are taking over, I’m getting old.” Dean Baili was lying on the chair and said to himself.

“Of course, I wonder whose apprentice is this.” At this moment, a voice came from the side.

Looking at her figure, Dean Baili smiled helplessly and said with a pampering look in his eyes, “Okay, you are amazing.”

“But I remember that when I reached the 99th floor, I couldn’t pass it. This level is too perverted and I don’t know if this kid can pass.”

“It’s not that easy.” Dean Baili seemed to think of something, then shook his head and said.

“It turns out that killing the mutant flaming snake will clear the level…”

Seeing that his body appeared in another place, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but say out loud to himself.

But who could find the mutant flaming snake and kill it under that circumstance, it was really too difficult. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

This final level was indeed too perverted.

At this time, when he looked around, he found that he was in a forest.

There were many trees around. They were all black and had no leaves, but the branches were like vines.

What is this?

At first, it was underwater, then it was flames and magma and now it’s in the forest?

These levels wouldn’t have all the Five Elements eh?

Lin Xiu thought to himself, then slowly walked forward with his Dark Edge spear.

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

As Lin Xiu walked forward, a very subtle sound rang out..
