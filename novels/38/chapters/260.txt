Chapter 261: Who On Earth Are You!?

“What are we going to do now?” Qiu Li and the others helped Guo Ling, who had been injured, to the side of the giant tree and asked.

Just now, although Guo Ling blocked Zhou Wenhao’s sword, she still got hurt by Zhou Wenhao’s sword aura.

She suffered quite a lot of damage.

Qian Lin took out the healing potion from the backpack and poured it on Guo Ling’s wound.

He washed the blood off her wound and applied medicinal powder.

“Go help Lin Xiu. If we don’t kill Zhou Wenhao, we will all die here.” Guo Ling was injured on his shoulder from Zhou Wenhao’s sword aura just now, but he tolerated the sharp pain of the wound at this time and said.

At this moment, Zhou Wenhao’s body was bursting with a steady stream of source strength.

A large amount of source strength has already begun to flow over the giant sword in Lin Xiu’s hand.

Those source strength covered the giant sword, making the giant sword glow faintly.

Those sword auras were constantly spinning around the giant sword and the grass and trees around were all cut because of the sword aura.

This time, Zhou Wenhao’s real power was fully displayed!

His face was cold and his body was like a shadow as he rushed towards Lin Xiu!

That huge sword that was full of sword aura was like a crescent moon as it slashed towards Lin Xiu’s body!

The overbearing and terrifying sword aura suddenly gave off a loud sound with the swing of the giant sword.

Dang–

Lin Xiu’s gaze changed. When he was about to attack, his spear got hacked by Zhou Wenhao’s sword.

Following the sound of a metal collision, sparks shot out in all directions.

Lin Xiu almost dropped the Dark Edge spear in his hand. Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu directly used the ‘Fury’ skill!

Dang dang dang——

Zhou Wenhao’s attacks became more aggressive.

But Lin Xiu continued to fight with him!

When the two weapons collided at this time, a large number of sparks continued to emit.

They fought from the ground into the air and when both of them fought, it looked like multiple illusions moving and nobody could see them clearly at all.

Qiu Li and the others, who stood up and were about to walk towards Lin Xiu, were shocked to see Lin Xiu and Zhou Wenhao still fighting.

Most importantly, Lin Xiu, a rank 5 warrior, was just as powerful as Zhou Wenhao!

There was already a huge gap between a rank 5 warrior and a rank 6 warrior that was difficult to cross, let alone Lin Xiu, a rank 5 warrior against a rank 7 warrior.

But now Lin Xiu was indeed fighting against Zhou Wenhao and judging by the situation, they still seemed to be on the same level.

This was really shocking.

“Kid! Who on earth are you!?” The more Zhou Wenhao fought with Lin Xiu, the more frightened he became. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

This kid’s spear art was not only very strange and terrifying but his speed of reaction and strength were very powerful.

It was really shocking that a rank 5 warrior was so powerful.

“Don’t you already know? I’m just a student of the Sacred Region Academy.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

Now in the state of ‘Fury’, his attributes had been drastically enhanced.

Especially after he unlocked the rank 2 gene lock, his attributes improved even more in the state of ‘Fury’.

“Arrogant!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Zhou Wenhao’s eyes became colder and more terrifying.

Lin Xiu made him feel danger.

He was so young yet he already possessed such strength. When he grows up, it was clear how formidable he would become!

He couldn’t let Lin Xiu live!!!

“‘Total Annihilation’!!!” The pupils in Zhou Wenhao’s eyes constricted suddenly. In the next moment, the giant sword stabbed towards Lin Xiu frantically!

There was a terrifying sword aura on the giant sword. At this time, the sword aura surrounded the giant sword and spun crazily.

With this blow, he could cut Lin Xiu’s body into pieces!

Lin Xiu’s gaze changed. The power of this skill was very terrifying and it was obvious that it must be a diamond skill!

Lin Xiu immediately felt a strong sense of crisis.

“‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!!!”

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and now he didn’t have any desire to escape. He directly mobilized the strength from his whole body and prepared to fight Zhou Wenhao head-on!

Following Lin Xiu’s roar, a large amount of source strength burst out directly from Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear!

His source strength instantly turned into black smoke and in the next moment, it directly converged into a huge black dragon. As Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear with both hands and waved it violently, the huge black dragon immediately charged forward!

Boom——

The impact caused by this skill was very strong; Guo Ling and the rest were shocked when they saw this scene.

Previously, they saw Lin Xiu using this terrifying skill in the live video. At that time, they felt that this skill was really powerful even through the screen.

It was almost comparable to a diamond skill.

Now that they were watching from such a close distance, they clearly witnessed the horror of this skill.

The huge black dragon that was formed by source strength looked horrifying like it covered the sky and the earth.

“Get lost!!!” Zhou Wenhao suddenly shouted when he saw this scene.

With the use of his skill, there was an unusually violent and terrifying sword aura on the giant sword.

He wanted to use this sword to pierce Lin Xiu’s black dragon and cutting Lin Xiu’s body into pieces by relying on the sword aura!

Boom——

The black dragon opened its mouth directly and attacked Zhou Wenhao, who was holding the giant sword!

Boom——

At the next moment, as the black dragon rushed over and collided with Zhou Wenhao’s giant sword, a louder sound instantly rang through the entire area at this time.

Pu——

The huge impact caused Lin Xiu’s body to fly out and hit the thick tree trunk.

Lin Xiu felt a tightness in his chest and vomited out a mouthful of blood.

Boom boom——

The impact caused by the collision of skils just now made all the surrounding trees to break apart at this time.

“Zhou Wenhao… is dead?” Qiu Li stood there, then stared at the middle area in front of him and said.

There was thick dust everywhere in the middle area and it was impossible to see the situation there.

They wanted to help at first, but the skills used by the two of them just now were very powerful and they were unable to participate.

Lin Xiu was also staring at the middle area.

He couldn’t seem to be sense Zhou Wenhao’s aura.

Could it be… that he really killed the rank 7 warrior!?
