Ouyang Hang, who originally thought Lin Xiu was going to ask him some key questions, was stunned when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

“You…get lost!” Ouyang Hang clenched his fists, resisting the urge to rush up and beat Lin Xiu to death.

Of course, with his strength, it was impossible to beat Lin Xiu.

“Oh, it seems that you are not stupid yet.” Seeing Ouyang Hang’s appearance at this time, Lin Xiu nodded and said aloud.

At this time, Ouyang Hang was already so angry – despicable, too despicable!

But too bad, he wasn’t a match for Lin Xiu at the moment.

At this time, Ouyang Hang took a deep breath, then said to Lin Xiu seriously, “I’m not kidding you, do you know who he is?”

Ouyang Hang said, pointing his finger at the projection behind Lin Xiu.

“His name is Yu Muchen,” Lin Xiu said lightly.

Ouyang Hang was startled, then he seemed to think of something, “She told you right?”

“The background of this person is not simple and he already has his eyes on you.”

“Eyes on me?” Lin Xiu raised his brows.

“Top freshman, defeated me and Zhuo Qixing – of course, he has his eyes on you because as long as he defeats you, he can prove that he is the top freshman.”

“That guy is a very arrogant guy.”

Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu and said with a sneer.

“And after you finished the match today, he already asked me to get rid of you.”

“But you are not that capable.” Lin Xiu said and shrugged.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Ouyang Hang suddenly felt like he was choked, but at this moment, he couldn’t say anything.

Despicable, what Lin Xiu said was too despicable!

Ouyang Hang felt that he would be pissed off if he continued talking to Lin Xiu, but at this time, he had to keep talking.

“If nothing goes wrong, he is already prepared to challenge you.” Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu, then continued to say aloud.

“Is that so? So you came here today just to say this?” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, then said faintly.

Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu and seemed a little hesitant, then he sighed and said, “Can you return my body skill card.”

This time Ouyang Hang, completely lost his arrogance, but lowered his noble head and said.

He felt that Lin Xiu’s strength was about to break through to rank 6. Once Lin Xiu reaches rank 6, he would definitely use that card and things would become troublesome!

If the Ouyang family found out that their body skill card was given to someone else, he would become a criminal!

By then, he is finished!

“Of course…” Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up, then said faintly.

“Really!?” When Ouyang Hang heard Lin Xiu’s words, he was in disbelief. This guy is willing to give it back?

Could it be that he knows the power of his family!?

With this thought, Ouyang Hang’s back straightened up.

“Of course… not.” Lin Xiu shrugged and looked at him like he was a fool.

“You…” Ouyang Hang felt like he was really about to vomit blood from anger.

Don’t fight with him over this, don’t fight with him over this.

Ouyang Hang took a deep breath, then continued to say to Lin Xiu, “I will trade it with another body skill.”

“Your Ouyang’s ‘Transient steps’ is known as the world’s top 30 body skill eh…” Lin Xiu said with a smile.

What he meant was very clear – he wouldn’t simply allow Ouyang Hang to take this skill card away.

Ouyang Hang seemed to know what Lin Xiu was thinking. At this time, he slowly took out a box from his pocket.

The sharp-eyed Lin Xiu also saw the box he took out at this time.

There were many complicated carvings on the box which looked very mysterious.

“What is this?” Lin Xiu looked at the box, his eyes narrowed.

He had a feeling that there was something extraordinary in this box.

“Diamond Body Skill Card.” Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu, then said seriously.

Diamond body skill card!?

Hearing Ouyang Hang’s words, Lin Xiu was a little surprised. The diamond body skill card was very rare and Ouyang Hang actually took out another one!?

And it was definitely different from the ‘Transient steps’ he got.

“However, even if it’s a diamond body skill card, there are different levels.” Although Lin Xiu was shocked on the inside, he was still very calm on the surface.

Lin Xiu was right, the world’s top 30 skill cards were very strong and the rest of the skill cards, even if they were at the diamond level, were not all very powerful.

“Ranked 19th in the world- ‘Without A Trace’.” Ouyang Hang seemed to know what Lin Xiu was thinking in his heart. At this time, he looked at Lin Xiu and said seriously.

Ranked 19th in the world!?

Hearing Ouyang Hang’s words, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted and his face was in shock.

If it was really the skill card that was ranked 19th in the world, it was indeed extremely rare.

Ouyang Hang obviously noticed the look of shock on Lin Xiu’s face and he slowly opened the box with satisfaction at this time.

As soon as the box was opened, a bright light was reflected in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

In this exquisitely carved wooden box, there was a beautiful skill card that shone brightly and it looked like an Odd crystal. There were three words carved beautifully on it: ‘Without A Trace’!!!

Lin Xiu gasped then looked at Ouyang Hang and said, “How did you get it!?”

This kind of skill card was not any ordinary skill card – it was ranked 19th in the world!

Even Ouyang family’s ‘Transient steps’ couldn’t compare!

“Don’t worry about how I got it, do you want to trade or not?” Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu, then said seriously.

However, at this time, Ouyang Hang still showed a heartbroken expression on his face. The practice of this skill was not easy, no, it was very difficult, but it was one of the world’s top 20 skill cards after all and it was very precious.

“Tell me, what do you want?” Although this skill card really made Lin Xiu a little jealous, Lin Xiu was not a fool and Ouyang Hang’s behavior today was a bit strange.

He clearly has a mortal feud with him yet this guy actually gave him a skill card today – it was definitely not with the best of intentions!
