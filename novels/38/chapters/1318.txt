1319 Three Men Fight

Baili Haoling and Lei Chong had their eyes opened wide as they watched the last episode.

This was because they noticed that most of the audience were looking forward to the last round.

There was another man sitting next to Baili Haoling that said, “Xiao Qingchen, Peng Wei, Zhao Xintong are all extraordinary god-level warriors.”

“Who do you think is the best?”

Baili Haoling peered at him before asking.

This man seems to know a lot about the identity of the warriors who were present today.

Plus, he kept commenting on the battles as if he was the official commentator.

“Of course it would be Xiao Qingchen.”

“Xiao Qingchen from Longyi City, one of the famous warriors these few years. It is said that he has a black grade divine spirit.”

The middle aged man spoke in a solemn tone.

“The both of you don’t know much about this right?

“A warrior’s divine spirit is split into three categories; Gold, red and black.”

“Gold are the most common ones while red are rare. As for the black grades, those are close to extinction.”

The man spoke with an envious look in his eyes.

A black grade divine spirit was something that even the God King would dream to have.

As for Baili Haoling, she pursed her lips as she thought to herself – ‘well, Lin Xiu has a black grade divine spirit.”

“Then, Xiao Qingchen would definitely win.”

Lei Chong suddenly spoke up.

He could already see Xiao Qingchen on stage.

He looked like a young warrior.

Plus, he wasn’t one that looked muscular.

However, Lei Chong could feel a strong pressure coming from him.

Even those from the audience seat could feel it!

This was not something that could be seen from the other warriors.

“That may not be necessary. There’s still Peng Wei and Zhao Xintong. Both of them are from the North and it seems like they know each other.”

“If my assumption is correct, both of them would work together to get rid of Xiao Qingchen first.”

His eyes were fixed on the stage as he spoke.

“This would definitely happen if three of them had to fight each other.”

Baili Haoling nodded her head as well.

It was obvious that such things would happen.

The warrior known as Xiao Qingchen may seem strong but it would not be that easy for him to deal with two warrior gods.

However, it would be great if he did lose. This way, Lin Xiu wouldn’t have to fight someone so powerful.

Baili Haoling couldn’t help but smile as she thought about it.

“Next up! We have Xiao Qingchen from Longyi City, Peng Wei from Xuba City and Zhao Xintong from Shalong City!! They will all be participating in the final battle!”

With the announcement from the referee, the audience turned wild.

“Xiao Qingchen!!!”

“Xiao Qingchen!!!”

The audience were cheering and chanting out loud.

The man known as Xiao Qingchen seems to be popular and the entire crowd was shouting his name.

“Xiao Qingchen?”

Lin Xiu looked at Xiao Qingchen who was on stage.

This man gave off a strong vibe and Lin Xiu had analysed him with his Analytic Eye.

From the stats itself, he was at least 30% better than Lin Xiu.

This man was indeed horrifying….

“Match starts!”

The voice of the announcer rang through the room. Peng Wei and Zhao Xintong seemed to have established an agreement as the both of them headed straight toward Xiao Qingchen!

Xiao Qingchen seemed to have expected this. He picked up the machete that he placed on the ground and attacked the other two instead!

Clang clang clang – –

All of them were moving quickly as if they were just shadows that collided with each other. No one could really see anyone of them clearly.

They could only hear the sound of weapons colliding with each other and the sparks that came along with the collision.

“Looks like Xiao Qingchen is in trouble.”

On the other side of the stage, Wan Gan and Zhang Qinghua couldn’t help but sighed when they said what happened.

Both of them favoured Xiao Qingchen as he was one of the more popular young warriors these days.

All of them thought of Xiao Qingchen as the champion.

...

“We’ll see.”

Riyan God King did not say much but his eyes were fixed on the battle.

Although they were all moving very quickly, their movements were still in slow motion for the God King. He could see their fight clearly.

With both of them attacking him, Xiao Qingchen did not seem to be struggling and he was still making effective attacks.

Clang clang clang – –

As he drew an arc in the air with his machete, it collided with both the weapons of the other party. The huge impact of it caused both of them to be thrown far into the air.

“F*ck!”

Peng Wei and Zhao Xintong were pushed far behind.

If one took a closer look, they could be able to see that there was a large amount of current that surrounded their bodies.

This was because Xiao Qingchen had released a terrifying amount of current with his attack earlier.

Due to how their weapons had collided, the currents were transferred over to their bodies.

...

Most warriors would have resistance towards a large range of attacks.

Although Peng Wei and Zhao Xintong had resistance towards electricity, the powerful currents still caused them to be in pain and both were looking as if they were struggling.

“The Wild Cow!”

Zhao Xinton roared in rage as he swiftly moved the spear in his hands.

As the energy in him got released, most of the energy turned into tiny particles that were like sand.

Soon, these particles gathered together to form a huge monster that looked like a cow.

Then, it went straight for Xiao Qingchen!

At the same time, the look in Peng Wei’s eyes changed and his body slowly turned into a black fog. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Interesting.”

When Xiao Qingchen saw what happened, he didn’t look frightened but instead, a slight smile appeared on his face.

Sizzling…

There were even more currants that appeared all over his machete.

There were thick lightning bolts that appeared and the entire machete started glowing brightly in purple.

Due to the lightning bolts, there was a heavy, toasted smell that appeared in the air.

“Hmm?”

Lin Xiu was a little surprised when he saw this.

The current that Xiao Qingchen had released seemed powerful.

For years, this was the first time that Lin Xiu had ever seen anyone who could release currents that were stronger than his.

At that moment, Xiao Qingchen noticed the wild cow that was heading his way and raised his machete above his head with both hands!

Boom – –

With the loud sound, all of the currents that were around his machete were aimed at the wild cow!
