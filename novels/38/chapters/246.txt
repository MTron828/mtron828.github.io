Chapter 247: I Will Come Back Alive

“Lin Xiu.” Lin Xiu also extended his hand and said aloud.

“This is Qiu Li and Chen Jin…” The ponytail girl introduced them to Lin Xiu at this time.

“Tomorrow at 12 noon, wait at the field.”

After they agreed on the time to meet, everyone left.

“Lin Xiu, they were talking about the Dark Forest?” After the second-year students left, Zhang Yin asked Lin Xiu curiously.

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu nodded, he didn’t have anything to hide from them.

“Really? I heard that the level of danger in that place is quite high.” Li Ping seemed to have recalled something at this time and trembled.

“You guys continue to train and strive to be able to withstand six times the gravity before the final exam.” Lin Xiu looked at the students in Class 10 of the South Campus and said aloud at this time.

“Six times the gravity…” Zhang Yin and the others were stunned.

They had just started training for four times the gravity and every time the gravity increases, the load they had to bear was more than doubled.

“You guys continue to train, I’ll get going first. This is the key, I’ll have to trouble you during this period of time, Zhang Yin.” Lin Xiu handed the key to the training room to Zhang Yin.

“Are you really going?” Zhang Yin asked.

The danger of this place was not comparable to the G17 Ruin.

Lin Xiu was only a rank 5 warrior and the minimum rank requirement to go there was rank 6 in order to have a chance to survive.

“Well, I’ll go and take a look.” Lin Xiu smiled and said.

“By the way, remember to train well, don’t be lazy. When I come back, your results will be assessed, everyone should reach rank 4 at least!” Lin Xiu glanced at the students behind and said aloud.

Being the class monitor was not so easy. It was necessary to assume a certain level of responsibility. If they fail to pass the final assessment, the class monitor would be the first one to be held responsible before the teacher.

“No problem!” After the previous events, the students in Class 10 of the South College admired Lin Xiu very much. At this time, they responded in unison after hearing Lin Xiu’s words.

Lin Xiu left the place and walked over to Nan Zhengjun’s office.

Knock knock knock——

Nan Zhengjun, who was tapping on the keyboard and seemed to be doing some work, frowned when he heard the knock on the door.

“Come in.”

“Teacher Nan.” Lin Xiu walked in and greeted.

When the Nan Zhengjun saw that it was Lin Xiu who walked in, he was startled for a moment, then smiled and said, “Lin Xiu, what’s the matter?”

Lin Xiu defeated Zhuo Qixing and he also heard that he defeated second-year Yu Yi the day before which made him quite proud.

Lin Xiu was the class monitor of Class 10 of the South Campus, he represented Class 10 of the South Campus.

“I want to apply for a mission.” Lin Xiu walked to Nan Zhengjun’s desk and said.

“Complete a mission? What mission? Let me take a look.” Nan Zhengjun was startled.

There was a mission system in the Sacred Region Academy which allowed you to earn points.

There were various missions that came with mission numbers.

“S39.” Lin Xiu said aloud.

S-grade mission?

Nan Zhengjun’s eyes constricted and quickly typed the mission number. The content of the mission was revealed:

[S-grade mission]: Find the mutated Black tooth spider living in the Dark Forest.

Mission reward: 300,000 points,

“No, I don’t agree with you doing this mission, it’s too dangerous.” Nan Zhengjun shook his head and said.

This was not only an S-grade mission but he also had to go to the Dark Forest.

The danger over there was not comparable to this place.

Although he had acknowledged Lin Xiu’s strength, it was almost the same as courting death if Lin Xiu went to that place.

“Lin Xiu, do you know where the Dark Forest is? Even if I go to this place, I may not be able to come back alive.”

Nan Zhengjun’s expression has become serious now.

Lin Xiu was talented. As long as he trains carefully, he will definitely become a very powerful warrior in the future. It would be a pity if he died there now.

“I know, I can come back alive.” Lin Xiu said plainly.

“You…: Seeing the stubborn look on Lin Xiu’s face, Nan Zhengjun got frustrated and said with a bitter smile, “No, for your safety, I won’t approve it.”

Without the approval of the teacher, no one could get out of the door of the Sacred Region Academy. Even if you went out, it was an endless sea out there and no one knew how to leave.

“Did Luo Yue go there too?” Lin Xiu said to Nan Zhengjun at this time.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Nan Zhengjun froze.

“Her situation is special.” After a moment of silence, Nan Zhengjun said with a sigh.

Luo Yue had a strong family background and she seemed to be in a hurry to go to the Dark Forest.

Moreover, she got approval directly from the dean so he had no right to stop her.

“I will come back alive.” Lin Xiu looked at Nan Zhengjun and repeated.

Nan Zhengjun looked at Lin Xiu’s firm eyes and sighed.

“Well, be careful, then.” Nan Zhengjun knew that he couldn’t stop Lin Xiu.

While speaking, Nan Zhengjun began to input some information on the computer and handed a card to Lin Xiu.

“Thank you.” Lin Xiu thanked Nan Zhengjun then left his office.

Dark Forest, here he comes!

“Lin Xiu.” Looking at Lin Xiu’s retreating figure, Nan Zhengjun called out.

Lin Xiu stopped in his tracks.

“Be careful, you have to come back alive.” Nan Zhengjun said with a sigh.

Lin Xiu’s aptitude was the best among the warriors he ever had so he didn’t want Lin Xiu to die.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded, then walked out the door. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

This would be much more dangerous than before, but he still had to go even if it is dangerous.

In order to improve his strength, killing evolved beasts was the fastest way.

And Luo Yue was there as well, he didn’t know how she was doing.

This girl hid everything in her heart, which gave Lin Xiu a headache.

“Now, let’s redeem a combat suit first…” Lin Xiu thought for a while and said to himself as he walked.
