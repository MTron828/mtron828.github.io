1381 The Netherworld’s Flame that Caused Them to Tremble.

The ones that were released weren’t Hellfire!

Instead, they were one that was extremely terrifying.

It looked like….Netherworld’s Flame!

As the flame spread over to his body through his weapon, Zhang Laosan let out a painful cry.

!!

“AHHHHHHH!!!”

The sword that he formed with his source energy disappeared immediately.

He took a few steps backwards and was shaking his hands, trying to get rid of the flames!

He was turning mad as he screamed on top of his lungs.

Not only were the flames burning his flesh and bones, it was also torturing him spiritually!

This was terrifying! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

For warriors like them, have any of them not experienced physical pain?!

However, the spiritual torture were much more painful than those felt physically!

The flames around him finally disappeared and the pain left as well.

However, he then noticed that there were countless flaming birds coming from the other side!

“Damn!”

Seeing what was about to happen, Zhang Laosan looked horrified.

With the previous experience, he was much more cautious now.

The Netherworld’s Flame!

This was definitely the Netherworld’s Flame!

He didn’t think that this young man would have been able to absorb such terrifying flames!

Compared to the legendary Netherworld’s Flame, his Hellfire was nothing!

Zhang Laosan’s face turned green. He ignored his hands that had turned black and once again released his ‘sphere’.

Boom boom boom – –

All of the flaming birds made of the Netherworld’s Flames landed directly on his ‘sphere’!

Boom boom boom —

One explosion followed by another and the flaming birds still couldn’t destroy the ‘sphere’.

“Hahahahahahahaha!!!”

He was a warrior who specialises in using flames. The Netherworld’s Flame might have been hot but it didn’t cause much damage to Zhang Laosan.

As long as he didn’t touch them, he would be fine!

“So what if you have the Netherworld’s Flames?!”

“You can’t do anything to me as long as I’m inside my ‘sphere’!”

Zhang Laosan looked at Lin Xiu as he roared in rage.

His eyes were filled with satisfaction as well.

Why?! Why was it that this fellow got to absorb the Netherworld’s Flames?!

Such powerful flames were something that all fire element warriors would have died for!

“Did you really think that you would be fine by staying inside your ‘sphere’?”

Lin Xiu gave a cold laugh when he saw what was happening.

Zhang Laosan was indeed more powerful than the other warriors. This was why his ‘sphere’ was much thicker than the rest.

If he didn’t use enough energy, Lin Xiu would not be able to kill him.

Then, Lin Xiu gathered all of the energy in his body and started swinging the long spear in his hands.

Wung wung wung – –

As he pushed his energy into the spear, there was soft noise coming from the spear.

It looked like it was shaking.

‘Profound Intent – Awe of Phoenix!!!’

Although this was not a god-level warrior skill, this was one that Lin Xiu could control and change the flames that he was releasing.

Plus, the damage that it would bring was powerful!

As Lin Xiu continued moving the spear in his hands, there were countless flaming birds that were released.

All of them flew into the air.

Then, they slowly gathered together and formed a huge flaming phoenix!

With a blink of an eye, the phoenix then headed straight towards Zhang Laosan!

The man was still laughing thinking that the flaming birds released by Lin Xiu were useless against him.

However, as he looked into the sky, he then noticed that there was a huge phoenix that was in the air!

“This…”

Seeing what was in the air, there was a drastic change in the look in his eyes.

...

The flaming phoenix formed by the Netherworld’s Flame was huge and it covered the entire sky.

The Netherworld’s flame not only caused the air around them to turn scorching hot, there was also a chilly feeling that hit them from head to toe.

Zhang Laosan couldn’t help but shiver when he saw what was happening.

The warriors, who were still trying to attack Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng, stopped as well.

“That…”

Xiao Qingchen felt something. He was initially trying his best to heal himself inside the array but suddenly opened his eyes.

Seeing how there was a huge phoenix in the air, he was shocked.

This phoenix was formed by the Netherworld’s Flame!

“That fella had really absorbed the Netherworld’s Flame!!”

Xiao Qingchen’s body started shaking vigorously.

His eyes were opened wide as he looked shocked.

...

“Ahhhhh!!!!”

At the same time, Zhang Laosan also noticed the huge phoenix that was headed at him. He roared in rage and released all of the energy inside him!

The ‘sphere’ that he released was then much tougher than before.

There was already no chance for him to hide and he could only take the attack head on!

“Go!”

As Lin Xiu swung the spear in his hands, the flaming phoenix then rushed to the ground.

Boom – –

The next moment, the flaming phoenix then landed on the ‘sphere’ released by Zhang Laosan.

The entire place started shaking.

The phoenix was like a horrifying meteorite that caused a huge hole on the ground.

There was a huge dent.

Zhang Laosan on the other hand was still releasing all the energy inside his body.

He was trying to maintain his ‘sphere’.

However, at the same time, the phoenix then turned into a huge tornado and started spinning like mad!

As the flames turned into a tornado, the ‘sphere’ that Zhang Laosan had released was starting to break apart because of the flames.

“NOOOOO!!!!”

Zhang Laosan let out a painful cry.

Then, his sphere instantly exploded!

The terrifying Netherworld’s Flame started burning his entire body.

The bone piercing pain in his soul tortured him the most.

“That’s…terrifying…”

The rest of the warriors trembled as well.

Zhang Laosan, who was almighty, ended up in such a sorry state.

“That fella….is indeed a monster…”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng were both surprised.

Especially for Xiao Qingchen who even started questioning life itself.

He only mentioned it randomly the last time but he didn’t think that Lin Xiu would actually go after the Netherworld’s Flames and even absorbed it!
