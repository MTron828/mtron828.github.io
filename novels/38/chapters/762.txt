Chapter 763: Wan Shanqian

The roar was extremely loud as if it could break another person’s eardrum.

“F**k! What was that?”

Liu Pan quickly covered his ears and that’s when he realised that the sun above his hide was blocked by something. The ground where he was standing turned shady.

He looked up and noticed that there was a huge figure above him.

That was a creature that was blue in colour and it looked like a lion.

It had wings that were covered in flames..

“Raging…..raging flame lion...”

Liu Pan’s eyes were wide open as he was shocked and his body started shivering as well.

He remained frozen as he looked at the evolved beast that flew across his head. He felt pressured by just looking at the creature.

Lin Xiu looked at the raging flame lion that was now above his head. His pupil shrank out of shock as well.

This was a king grade evolved beast!

The strength of this creature seemed to be much scarier than the Snow Lizard that they met at the legacy land!

This is a high level king grade evolved beast!

“That...was terrifying...”

As the creature flew past them, An Qi and Qian Ling gave out a breath of relief.

The pressure that they felt earlier was so strong even when they were standing so far away from it.

If they got closer, the high pressure felt would make it difficult for them to fight.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath as he chuckled and asked, “What’s wrong? Are you afraid now?”

“I’m not afraid!” Liu Pan came back to his senses after hearing what Lin Xiu said.

An Qi and Qian Ling nodded their heads as well.

“Let’s continue on then.”

As they continued travelling, there were no other evolved beasts that appeared because of the raging flame lion.

“HAHAHAHA….We’re finally here!”

There were no evolved beasts but soon, they noticed that there were a large number of warriors that slowly gathered together.

Most of them have already left the forest and were gathered at the foot of the mountain. They could even hear laughter coming from the warriors.

“Wan Qianshan?”

When Liu Pan noticed that warrior that was laughing loudly, the look on his face changed.

“I didn’t think that this guy would be here...”

“Who are they?”

Lin Xiu got curious as well.

“The b*tches from the An and Qian families?!”

Just when Lin Xiu was asking Liu Pan, the man known as Wan Qianshan, was already walking towards them.

An Qi and Qian Ling picked up their weapons as well.

“Both of you know him?”

Liu Pan looked confused.

“Tsktsktsk….looks like your family isn’t here.”

Wan Shanqian then peered at Lin Xiu who was standing next to girls as he spoke in a rude manner.

There were about a dozen people standing behind him.

Some of them behind him were master warriors.

“What do you want?”

An Qi and Qian Ling looked at them and tightly grabbed onto their weapons. They had a cautious look on their faces as well.

“What do you want?!”

“Look at my face. What do you think?”

Wan Shanqian pointed at the scars on his face.

“You are the one who disturbed us first.”

An Qi and Qian Ling answered coldly as well.

After hearing their conversation, Lin Xiu had a vague idea of what had happened.

He must have teased these girls earlier and were injured by them. However, because of their family, he didn’t have the guts to fight them. Now that An Qi and Qian Ling were alone, he had the idea of taking revenge.

“You could have fixed the wounds on your face.” Qian Lin said flatly.

“SHUT UP!”

“I allowed them to stay so that I will remember about it.”

Wan Qianshan shouted in rage.

“This is one of the strongest master warriors. He’s well known in this region for robbing the warriors who were here to hunt for odd crystals.”

Liu Pan whispered into Lin Xiu’s ears.

A strong master warrior?

After hearing what was told, Lin Xiu frowned.

This meant that this guy’s strength would be similar to Huang Ji.

It would be impossible for him to defeat warriors like him without activated ‘Rage’.

From what was happening, this man was worried about An Qi and Qian Ling’s family which meant that they must come from very powerful families.

“Hehe….looks like there are no cameras here.”

Wan Shanqian sneered as he walked towards Qian Ling and An Qi.

Then, his arm reached towards them.

Xiu – –

That’s when a sharp spear appeared right before his eyes.

“I don’t think that this is nice of you.”

Lin Xiu looked at him as he said flatly.

“Young man, what do you think you’re doing?”

Wan Qianshan looked at the sharp spear that was right in front of as he glared at Lin Xiu as a warning.

“Move back.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and warned the other party instead.

“Yo….looks like this is an arrogant boy.”

The men who were standing behind Wan Qianshan walked out as well.

When they saw Lin Xiu, all of them were staring at him with a cold look in their eyes.

Liu Pan grabbed onto his double bladed axe and glared at them.

He was ready to fight!

Wan Shanqian chuckled and following after that, the look in his eyes changed. It was a murderous look as he threw a punch at Lin Xiu!

He was wearing a pair of gloves and it was obvious that he is a fist master.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu had a change of expression but still quickly moved aside, blocking the fist with his spear.

With the strong impact, Lin Xiu’s body was thrown into a distance and it only stopped as Lin Xiu grinded his feet onto the ground.

“Master!”

An Qi and Qian Ling shouted in fear.

“Master? Someone like that is your warrior?”

“He looks more like your boy toy!”

When Wan Shanqian heard them screaming, he couldn’t help but laugh.

“Hahahaha….such a joke!”

The warriors behind him laughed as well.

“You...”

An Qi and Qian Ling were furious when they heard the men laughing.

However, their laughter merely lasted for a few seconds when Lin Xiu’s figure suddenly appeared right in front of Wan Qianshan.

He was so quick!

Wan Qianshan’s pupil shrank as well when Lin Xiu suddenly appeared right in front of him. Then, he quickly put up his hand to block the attack. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Clang – –

There was a loud sound when the tip of the spear collide with his elbow guard!
