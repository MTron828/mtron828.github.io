Chapter 737 Upgrade! Master Warrior!

Xue Liantian opened his eyes wide, watching this incredible scene, his whole body wanted to mobilize the energy to break free.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu had already rushed in front of him!

‘Clean sweep’!!!

Lin Xiu roared inwardly and the spear swept over again!

This ‘Clean Sweep’ was a special skill card and the way of using it was very different.

The source strength it consumes is not particularly large and when used in a short period of time and the power will be more powerful each time.

“What!!!”

Xue Liantian roared angrily. At this time, his feet were frozen and he couldn’t break free. He could only resist with the sword in his hand.

As Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear swept over, Xue Liantian, who was holding the sword to resist, felt the sword in his hand vibrate violently.

Dang–

In the next moment, it actually broke apart!

“How can it be…”

Xue Liantian’s eyes widened, watching this scene in disbelief.

The sword in his hand was forged from very rare metals and some materials from king-level evolved beasts.

Its hardness was evident, but now, it has been broken into two pieces!

And with Lin Xiu’s horizontal slash, he also clearly felt a sharp pain in his body.

“You…”

Xue Liantian slowly lowered his head and looked at chest.

At the chest area, there was an obvious bloodstain.

Torn–

In the next moment, his body immediately broke into two pieces!

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for killing a master warrior and gaining experience 154854674978…”

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for successfully upgrading! The current level is 50!”

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for successfully advancing to a master warrior-level warrior!”

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for acquiring the skill ‘Exotic Summoning’!”

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for getting the advanced reward, all system skills have been reset!”

“Ding!…”

As Lin Xiu killed Xue Liantian, system prompts sounded continuously in his mind.

Upgraded!

It was exactly what he planned! After killing this relatively weak master warrior, he was directly promoted to the master warrior level! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

At this time, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that his strength was increasing crazily.

A master warrior-level warrior, he has really become a master warrior-level warrior.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and looked around, as if his eyesight had gotten better.

“The… the president is dead!?”

When the rest of Xue Liantian’s subordinates saw this scene, their bodies trembled.

“Combat strength… why is the combat strength still rising…”

The man with the eye shield looked at Lin Xiu on the opposite side and found that Lin Xiu’s combat strength was still rising wildly, he couldn’t help but tremble and said.

Originally, there was more than 10,000 combat power, but now this combat power was still rising and the numbers were changing too fast.

It made his eye shield feel hot.

It was so hot that the corners of his eyes hurt.

“Go to hell!!!”

At this time, Huangji had already rushed over with a long sword!

He never thought that Lin Xiu would kill Xue Liantian!

And in such a short period of time.

“Ha ha.”

Lin Xiu looked at Huangji who appeared behind him and sneered suddenly, holding a spear in both hands to block his sword.

En!?

As Lin Xiu resisted his attack, Huangji clearly felt something was wrong.

How could Lin Xiu’s strength become stronger!

boom–

While he was surprised, Lin Xiu pushed the Dark Edge spear in both hands hard and after sending Huangji’s body to the back, he charged directly with the spear!

Whoosh whoosh

Lin Xiu’s speed was very fast, so fast that everyone was in disbelief.

Damn it!

Huangji watched this scene, the pupils in his eyes also shrank and he resisted with the long sword in his hand.

Dangdang

“Get away from me!!!”

After continuously resisting Lin Xiu’s attacks, Huangji roared and the long sword in his hand burst out with dazzling light.

He frantically waved the long sword in his hand and white sword lights burst out in an instant.

Lin Xiu, who was fighting with him, felt a tingling sensation in his arms holding the weapon.

His hand was scratched by these terrifying sword beams and his skin burst open.

Blood also sputtered out.

“Boy, you think you can kill me huh!”

“What a joke!”

Huang Ji, who was in a rage, roared loudly at this time.

The movements in his hands are even faster.

His swordsmanship is fierce and with the dancing of his long sword, there are many sword lights piercing out.

These sword beams are very terrifying. During the battle, Lin Xiu’s exposed skin and suit were all torn open.

Lin Xiu’s expression did not change at this time and at the next moment, he directly activated the ‘Fury’ skill!

This was something that Lin Xiu didn’t expect. After advancing to the master warrior level, he even refreshed all his skills.

Because he has now risen to the level of a master warrior, after using the ‘Fury’ skill, his strength increased very quickly accordingly.

Boom

With the spear in his hand, another round of terrifying flaming birds burst out from Lin Xiu’s Dark edge spear.

But these flaming birds, unlike the previous ones, seemed to be even more terrifying!

Huang Ji, who wanted to rely on his sharp swordsmanship to attack Lin Xiu continuously, looked at the flaming birds that were charging and the expression in his eyes could not help but change slightly.

Without the slightest hesitation, he turned from attack to defense and his body retreated directly to the back.

Those flaming birds continued to charge towards Huangji and wherever they passed, the surrounding snow melted instantly.

“Insignificant skill!”

Huangji looked at this scene, snorted coldly, waved the long sword in his hand and the sword aura burst out directly, dissipating all the flaming birds that came.

But at this time, Lin Xiu had already rushed towards him!

The source strength from Lin Xiu’s whole body was mobilized.

After all, Huangji was a top warrior at the master warrior level and his physical fitness and strength were very strong.

While Lin Xiu had only just been promoted to a master warrior-level warrior and it was really not easy to kill him.

So Lin Xiu didn’t think of restraining his strength, he must kill him directly!

[Exotic Summon)!

At this time, Lin Xiu directly activated this newly acquired skill!

Whoosh whoosh

And while using this skill, Lin Xiu didn’t stop his movements at all, the spear stabbed out and instantly turned into hundreds of spear shadows!

bang bang bang

The pupils in Huangji’s eyes shrank slightly and the source strength in his body burst out, instantly converging into a ‘Sphere’.

nve

The spear hit his ‘Sphere’ and suddenly made a dull sound.

Huangji felt that his ‘Sphere’ was constantly shaking, as if it was about to be punctured!
