Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

As Lin Xiu roared, the Dark Edge spear in his hand burst out with a dazzling light.

The power-up strike increased the power of Lin Xiu’s next shot to the extreme.

As the long spear drew an arc, a powerful and terrifying force burst out!

The air seemed to be rippling like water waves.

Boom—

With a loud explosion, two figures fell directly from the sky.

Huangfu Lin and Huangfu Yu, like falling comets, fell directly on the battle platform below.

The entire battlefield shook at this time.

pfft—

The two people who fell to the ground from the air vomited blood and opened their eyes wide.

Trying hard to get up.

“The people from the Divine Domain only have this little strength huh?”

Lin Xiu, who was suspended in the air, looked down at this moment and said lightly.

When the surrounding warriors saw this scene, their eyes widened.

Originally, most warriors thought that when Lin Xiu was arrogant, he delusionally wanted to challenge two such powerful warriors at the level of Respected warrior.

But they didn’t expect that Lin Xiu not only defeated them, but also defeated them in an overwhelming way.

Too strong!

“This kid, he can’t be a Sage warrior, can he?”

Wu Hao couldn’t help but wipe the sweat from his forehead and said.

If Lin Xiu was a Sage warrior, it would be even more beneficial for Wu Hao.

This time, when he goes to the Sage warrior Space, it is very likely that he will get that Angel’s Tears back.

Thinking of this, Wu Hao clenched his hands a little excitedly.

His time is running out, he must get the Angel’s Tears as soon as possible!

This time, is the last chance.

“We…will not lose…”

Huangfu Lin and Huangfu Tian slowly got up at this time, as if muttering to themselves.

And at this moment, some murmuring sounds came from their mouths.

Nobody knew what they were talking about.

What is going on?

Lin Xiu, who was in the air, could not help frowning when he heard them muttering to themselves like they were chanting scriptures.

boom boom boom —

Soon, the entire sky seemed to begin to darken at a speed visible to the naked eye.

And at this time, there was a strong wind.

In the sky, there is also thunder and lightning.

“what is going on!?”

When the people around saw this scene, the expressions in their eyes also changed greatly.

Because what’s happening now is really weird.

Taking a closer look, Huangfu Lin and Huangfu Tian stood up straight.

As they muttered to themselves and chanted some weird words, white rays of light burst out from their bodies.

Whizzing–

Lin Xiu looked up at the high altitude and saw two white light clusters that flew down from the sky and directly hit their bodies!

Boom— FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

The whole ground shook once again.

And at this moment, Huangfu Lin and Huangfu Tian, ??who were hit by the two light clusters respectively, roared loudly.

As if suffering some kind of pain.

‘God descend’!?

A Respected warrior standing beside Wu Hao seemed to know something, his eyes widened and he said subconsciously.

“What is ‘God descend’?”

When the Respected warrior heard his words, he was stunned and said subconsciously.

“Master, you know that the power of Divine Domain has always been one of the most powerful forces on the planet Namir.”

That Respected warrior said.

“Of course I know that.”

Wu Hao nodded, the power of Divine Domain spread all over the planet, this is something that all warriors know.

“Why hasn’t the power of Divine Domain weakened in the slightest for so many years, instead it has grown stronger.”

“That’s because, in their divine domain, there really is a god.”

This Respected warrior said in a deep voice at this time.

“Really!?”

When Wu Hao heard his words, he was shocked.

“Well, this is the information I got somewhere previously.”

“The creator of Divine Domain is a warrior god.”

“And in the world of the warrior god, they can use part of their power to descend on the bodies of people in the Divine Domain through a special secret method.”

“This method is called ‘God’s descend’.”

“It’s just that I didn’t expect to see it here.”

Speaking of which, this Respected warrior looked a little excited.

“The power of the warrior god…”

Wu Hao stared blankly at Huangfu Lin and Huangfu Tian in that scene.

Now the two people’s bodies are covered with a faint golden light and it looks like the gods have descended.

“Hahaha, I haven’t been to this planet for a long time!”

At this time, Huangfu Lin laughed loudly.

But his voice has obviously changed from before!

“You had to call us here – Did you meet an enemy?”

Huangfu Tian looked up into the sky and said lightly.

Lin Xiu looked down and used the Analytic eye directly.

Under the inspection of the Analytic eye, Lin Xiu could clearly find out.

The current strength of these two people has suddenly skyrocketed to the level of Sage warrior!

how can that be!?

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes were also full of shock.

“There is a boy at the level of Respected warrior who we can’t deal with it.”

“How could the power of our Divine Domain become so weak.”

Huangfu Lin said coldly at this time.

The voices of these two were not what they used to be.

Even the temperament seems to have undergone significant changes.

Combining these aspects, Lin Xiu thought of a possibility.

These two people, through some secret techniques, made even more powerful warriors enter their bodies.

Even a Sage warrior cannot transmit his physical strength to these warriors from such a long distance, right?

Could it be that… the warrior god!?

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help taking a deep breath.

Because he felt his guess… was right!

“Hehe, stop talking nonsense, we don’t have much time.”

“Well, kill him.”

At this moment, Huangfu Tian and Huangfu Lin looked at Lin Xiu in the sky.

In the next moment, they burst out with extremely strong power, like two groups of white lights, they charged directly towards Lin Xiu in the sky!

Very fast!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly and just as his figure was about to move, he noticed the figure of Huangfu Lin appeared in front of him!

“Boy, where are you going?”

He laughed wickedly and in the next moment, a fist hit Lin Xiu’s body!

boom–

With a dull sound, Lin Xu’s body was directly knocked into the air!

“Goodbye!”

And Huangfu Tian looked at Lin Xiu who was knocked down from the air, folded his hands together and suddenly golden energy gathered in the palms of his hands.

A powerful and terrifying energy ray directly charged toward Lin Xiu who was knocked down!

Boom—
