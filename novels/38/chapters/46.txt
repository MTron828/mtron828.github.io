Chapter 47: A Great Deal of Experience

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Kill kill kill!

Lin Xiu had forgotten everything else and only knew that he had to constantly brandish his silver spear.

Every time he waved it, cold gleams of light dispersed.

Xu Wen looked over at Lin Xiu’s actions and opened his mouth in surprise.

He kept paying attention to Lin Xiu as the former Lin Xiu did not have such strength at all and at most had the strength of a quasi-warrior.

But judging from the strength that Lin Xiu had shown so far, he looked stronger than the fellow soldiers who were currently killing the zombies!

And even the weakest soldier was an official warrior!

In a short period of time, he went from being a quasi-warrior to being an official warrior?

With this thought, Xu Wen gasped in surprise.

“Keep cleaning up!” While he was in a daze, a few zombies pounced from the side. He roared and brandished his spear as he continued killing those zombies.

After the experience in the morning, the soldiers became more comfortable dealing with the zombies.

The whole street, in this instant, was full of zombies and fresh blood stained the ground red.

Not just Lin Xiu, everyone was lying on the ground, panting hard at this point.

The afternoon went by quickly and they managed to clear hundreds of zombies.

The number of zombies killed by Lin Xiu alone was estimated to be about the same as the rest of the soldiers combined.

They had been killing since the start of the day, so they were completely exhausted.

The experience points of a rank 2 zombie were about 2,000, and Lin Xiu killed more than a hundred or almost two hundred in the afternoon so his experience points were already around 400,000 to 500,000. He just needed about 300,000 more points to reach level 14 and would be close to level 15 too!

“Lin Xiu... How do you fight like this…” Li Yi was panting as he looked at Lin Xiu, who was lying on the other side.

He really couldn’t understand why Lin Xiu was trying so hard to kill the zombies like he was farming in a game. This was too crazy.

“Farming.” Upon hearing that, Lin Xiu laughed.

Li Yi shook his head and thought that Lin Xiu was just joking with him.

The sky slowly began to darken, and the dark night meant that they might encounter more dangers.

After about an hour’s rest, everyone began to slowly get up.

“Let’s cook the Sabertooth Hound tonight,” Xu Wen looked at the people who had restored their energy and said.

Evolved beasts were extremely high in protein and energy, and they were more nutritious than normal meat.

Previously, the Sabertooth Hound’s body was cut into several pieces and Xu Wen had already collected the meat, then placed it on a rock.

Xu Wen took a sniff. It seemed like because the weather was relatively cool, the meat stayed quite fresh.

At this moment, the remaining soldiers also began to look around for stones and formed a large circle. In the middle, they piled a large number of wooden blocks and stones.

“Lin Xiu, we’ll have to trouble you.” Xu Wen smiled at him.

As they didn’t have anything to light a fire, only Lin Xiu’s “Awe of the Phoenix” could do so.

Lin Xiu nodded and waved the long spear in his hand. In an instant, a flame was released and directly went toward the pile of wood in the middle.

Soon, a blazing fire was ignited.

“Won’t we attract zombies by doing this?” Li Yi asked rather fearfully.

Although he had killed a lot of zombies today, three soldiers died in the hands of the zombies. There were only seven people left in the team of ten people.

“It shouldn’t. We have already wiped out the zombies in this area.” Lin Xiu stood on the other side of the roof and looked down. From the perimeter that he could see, there should be only this group of a hundred zombies.

If there were still any zombies, they should be somewhere farther away.

“That’s good.” Li Yi and the other soldiers heaved a sigh of relief.

This task was too cruel, the moment they were a little careless, it would be fatal!

“Have something to eat first!” Xu Wen said.

He took out a wooden stick and stuck a piece of Sabertooth Hound’s meat on it, then placed it on top of the flame and started cooking.

Lin Xiu was also grilling a piece of evolved beast’s meat. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Such types of meat already contained a lot of oil, so with the burning fire, some oil began to seep out slowly.

Although there was no seasoning, a very fragrant smell emanated from the meat.

This was the first time Lin Xiu had eaten an evolved beast’s meat.

The book stated that this evolved beast’s meat was very nutritious and could be eaten normally.

Soon, the meat was cooked and Lin Xiu took a bite. The beast’s meat was very chewy and tasty even without any seasoning.

The rank 3 Sabertooth Hound’s meat was eaten up very quickly by everyone.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but rub his stomach as he sat on the ground.

After killing zombies for an entire day, he was indeed a little tired.

But he must kill the zombies, this was the only way to increase his strength, and killing those zombies today not only increased his experience points but also improved his spear art and skill.

The more dangerous the place was, the more helpful it would be to improve your own strength.

Hissing——

Just then, there was a slight noise.

Lin Xiu’s ears were sensitive and he didn’t let his guard down even when he was resting.

At this moment, he looked in the direction of the noise only to find a red figure behind Xu Wen.

“Xu Wen, strike backwards!” Lin Xiu’s pupils narrowed as he yelled loudly.

The rest of the soldiers got a shock, and Xu Wen was stunned too. Then, he seemed to have felt something, and without hesitation, he struck behind him and the head of a red snake was split in half!

“Rank 2 red-winged snake!?” Xu Wen was taken aback.

It was really this horrible thing. Lin Xiu saw that he had killed the red-winged snake and couldn’t help thinking about the scene at District A20.

That girl asking him to ‘turn and pierce downwards’ echoed in his ears.

“Thank you.” Xu Wen heaved a sigh of relief and said to Lin Xiu.

Had it not been for Lin Xiu’s warning, Xu Wen would have been attacked by this red-winged snake.

“It’s alright.” Lin Xiu shook his head.

Xu Wen took out a red Odd Crystal from the middle of the red-winged snake’s head, then tossed it over to Lin Xiu and said firmly, “This is yours.”

Lin Xiu didn’t reject it and directly kept it in his pocket.

“By the way, do you know where the sacred region is?” Looking at the body of the red-winged snake, what had happened previously surfaced in his mind.
