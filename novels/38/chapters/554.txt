Chapter 555: Rank 7 Warrior!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Ding!”

“Congratulation Master on the level up! You are now at level 35!”

“Congratulations Master on the level up! You are not a rank 7 warrior! You have gained the title ‘Rank 7 warrior’!”

“Congratulations Master...”

There were multiple notifications that continued ringing inside Lin Xiu’s mind.

However, Lin Xiu ignored the noises in his head and focused on his meditation as he continued to absorb the energy from the rank 8 odd crystals that he obtained from killing the rank 8 green snake.

This odd crystal had much more energy than the other rank 8 odd crystals. As he was absorbing both simultaneously, there was still a lot of energy left in this crystal.

Lin Xiu focused on his cultivation and completely ignore everything around him.

Although his body was in pain, he had gone through much painful experience in the earlier stages which was why Lin Xiu could no longer feel it now.

His skin that had been completely torn all over his body was recovering so quickly that it can be seen by the naked eyes.

It looked as if his body had shedded the old skin and the newer ones were much fairer and smoother.

Although that’s how it looked, his skin was much tougher and stronger than before.

The skin all over Lin Xiu’s body slowly turned red once again.

He was quickly absorbing the remaining energy from the second crystal.

The speed at which he was absorbing the energy was much faster before he became a rank 7 warrior!

Koo Luuuu – – Kooo Luuu – –

The water around Lin Xiu started bubbling!

“Hmm?”

The rank 8 warrior who was meditating on the ground seemed to have noticed it and immediately opened his eyes.

He had been waiting by the shore. He can’t be sure that Lin Xiu was dead if he didn’t see Lin Xiu’s body.

Plus, there were a lot of flying evolved beasts that he controlled that were flying in the air. As soon as Lin Xiu’s head appeared above the water, they would be able to find him within seconds.

But, Lin Xiu still hasn’t appeared when the sky has already turned dark!

He thought that Lin Xiu might have died underwater but he didn’t expect that there would be movement coming from the river bed.

The young man stood up. The moon was already high up in the sky and it shone brightly onto the river.

When he took a closer look, the waters in the centre of the river seemed to be bubbling.

Plus, there was also a dim red glow that was coming from underneath the water.

What’s happening?!

The young man frowned when he saw the scene before his eyes. He couldn’t understand what was happening under water.

But, he had a bad feeling about this.

His eyes were locked onto the river and all of a sudden, he could see that there was a large amount of river-evolved beast that started swimming away from this part of the river.

Some of them even jumped out of the river and were swimming in the opposite direction. The entire scene was a peculiar thing to look at.

There were evolved beasts in the river?

The Young man frowned as he felt that things were getting weirder as time passed by.

“Ding! Congratulations Master on the Level up! You are now level 36!”

Lin Xiu, who was still under the waters, suddenly opened his eyes after hearing the last notification.

Although he was still subconsciously cultivating, he could now clearly hear the notifications chiming in his mind.

When he opened his eyes, he looked at the odd crystal that was in his palm and saw that the energy in it had been completely absorbed by him. It now looked like a normal glass bead.

Lin Xiu looked at his body once again and noticed that he had a new layer of skin. His skin that was originally a few shades darker was now smooth and fair once again.

The wound that was previously on his chest had now disappeared. If he wasn’t wrong, all the injuries that he had on his body had now completely recovered.

Rank 7 ! He was now a rank 7 warrior!

Lin Xiu quickly logged into the system inside his mind and he could clearly see his stats board;

Level: 36

EXP: 0/100 billion

Strength: 810

Physique: 450

Speed: 250

He really became a rank 7 warrior!

Lin Xiu could clearly feel that his entire body had been filled with a vast amount of energy and was sure that he had gained a new skill.

He didn’t think too much and immediately clicked onto the description of his new skill.

‘Reset’: Once a skill has been used, you can immediately use the skill again without the cooling time. ( Cooling time: 5 days. )

Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows. He felt that this skill was a little useless but after thinking about it, he changed his mind. This skill meant that he would be able to use ‘Rage’ and ‘Engulf’ twice in one day!

Oh…he also had a new warrior title.

Since he was already a rank 7 warrior, is there any other effect from his new title?

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and quickly clicked onto his new title and it showed;

‘Rank 7 Warrior’ : Fatality rate +1%. Continued having the effects as a rank 6 warrior.

Fatality rate?!

What was that?

When Lin Xiu saw the description from the rank 7 warrior title, he was confused but since he was able to continue using the skill from the title of a rank 6 warrior, he didn’t mind.

Since the effect of that title was just like a bug!

After replacing his own title with the new one, Lin Xiu closed his eyes, allowing his body to rest. Then, as he opened his eyes, he stomped onto the ground with his full force and he shot out of the surface of the water like an arrow being shot from the bow.

Hualaaaaa – –

There was water being splashed everywhere and Lin Xiu’s body was high up in the air!

As soon as he got out of the water, Lin Xiu could feel the sharp, screeching whistling that was coming from those birds. He even landed on top of one of those flying evolved beats.

Evolved beasts?!

Lin Xiu, who just got out of the water, was completely confused. It was already night time but the moon was shining brightly today. There was also lightning that struck suddenly which made it easier for him to see what was around him.

The evolved beast felt Lin Xiu standing on top of him. It was trying to frantically move his body so that he could throw Lin Xiu off his body.

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu snorted and noticed that there was a small piece of ground where he could land. He leaped from the body of the evolved beast and headed onto the ground!

As soon as he jumped, he could see a sharp, bright glow that came from the side!

Since he was now a rank 7 warrior and another level higher, Lin Xiu’s reflex was much faster than before.

Xiu – –

Lin Xiu’s body was still heading down towards the ground where he suddenly shifted and dodged the attack!
