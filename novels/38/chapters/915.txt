Chapter 916: Fire Element Stars

“Very well, if you guys violate it, you will find out the consequences.”

The person in charge glanced at everyone again, then walked to the machine.

“Hu Ling, bring them here.”

“En.”

Hu Ling nodded slightly, standing in front of her, she suddenly said, “You guys, come in with me.”

“Okay.”

These warriors, including Lin Xiu, followed her into an area in front.

“Later, we will use the space teleportation machine to teleport you in.”

“Everyone get ready.”

Hu Ling said after watching everyone step in.

“Yes!”

...

At the same time, the staff member has already started the machine!

With the start of the machine, there was also a strange sound around.

Soon, as a dazzling light shone down, Lin Xiu could only see this white mass in his eyes.

“The machine is activated...”

A mechanical voice came over.

Lin Xiu’s eyes saw the surrounding scene, which had changed.

arrived?

Lin Xiu raised his brows, looked around and found that there were huge walls built of ancient bricks all around.

Except for the machines here that are bright, the surroundings was pitch-dark.

“This is the secret realm?”

Lin Xiu said curiously.

It was the first time he came to such a place, so he was a little curious.

“That’s right, this is the secret realm.”

Hu Ling nodded.

Looking at Lin Xiu, there seemed to be curiosity in his eyes.

With a warrior like Lin Xiu, hasn’t he been to any secret realm before?

“Boy, it isn’t your first time, is it? Be careful, you might stay here forever.”

A large warrior, looking at Lin Xiu with a malicious smile.

“Okay, the fourth passage is here, you can go in.”

The guard of the space teleporter here pointed to the area in front of him.

“Sure.”

Hu Ling nodded, then led the crowd to the front.

When they walked to the front, the originally dark environment seemed to suddenly become brighter.

Some warriors showed surprise in their eyes.

The sudden brightness here was not because of the light, but because of the surrounding air, there were many spots of light.

These little light spots are walking around, making the surrounding space brighter.

“Our Divine Domain has four entrances.”

“This is the fourth one.”

Hu Ling, who was walking in front, said aloud.

“The pronunciation of four and death is quite similar, this seems like a bad omen.”

When a warrior heard Hu Ling’s words, he was immediately amused.

Just as soon as he finished speaking, Hu Ling stopped.

“You’re right, before this, several groups of warriors have disappeared inside.”

Hearing Hu Ling’s words, the surrounding warriors began to panic a little.

Disappearing was another way of calling it, the truth was that they died, right?

Thinking of this, some warriors felt chills down their spines.

“It’s not because this is the fourth channel, because this secret realm is originally a giant secret place.”

“This place is very dangerous.”

“If someone wants to back out, it’s not too late to leave now.”

Hu Ling glanced at everyone, then said lightly.

These warriors who looked a little scared just now stood up straight with their heads held high.

They came to the secret realm because they wanted to gain power.

Especially in such a large-scale secret realm, it is very likely that there are many inheritances of Sage warrior-level warriors in it.

As the saying goes, danger and opportunity coexist.

Of course, these warriors must seize this opportunity.

“If there is no problem, we will go in now.”

Hu Ling glanced at the many warriors and after finding that none of them expressed any opinion, she walked directly towards the front.

After walking a short distance, they could clearly see a huge stone gate.

“Hu.”

Hu Ling looked at the stone gate and took a deep breath.

In the next moment, the source strength of her whole body gathered crazily.

All gathered in her hands.

“open!”

As Hu Ling called out, her hands directly pressed against the door.

boom–

With a dull sound, this huge stone gate was slowly pushed open!

Behind the stone gate, there seems to be a faint purple light coming from it.

The light seemed a bit dazzling and Lin Xiu’s eyes could not help but squint slightly.

“Go in!”

With Hu Ling’s shout, the surrounding warriors ran straight in.

Lin Xiu was no exception.

“This... is this the secret realm?

As soon as they walked in, some warriors were shocked by the beautiful scene inside.

In the surrounding space, there were a lot of starlights.

As if they were on the Milky Way.

“what!”

One of the warriors stretched out his hand to touch a cluster of light that was suspended in the air like a star.

But the moment his hand touched it, his entire body was instantly covered by white fire.

The white fire blazed in an instant.

The warrior rolled frantically on the ground, but it was still very fast and his body was slowly burned into coke.

“He… he died?”

When some warriors saw this scene, they couldn’t help but exclaim.

Some warriors even felt their hairs stand up.

They had just entered this secret realm and someone died – it was a huge blow to their morale.

“This is fire element star, which contains extremely strong energy. Ordinary people will end up like this when they touch it...”

Hu Ling looked at this scene and said coldly.

But before she finished speaking, her eyes widened when she saw what happened.

Because she can clearly see Lin Xiu stretching out his hand and grabbing a fire element star into his hand. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

In the next moment, he directly put this fire element star into his mouth.

“You’re crazy!”

Hu Ling couldn’t help exclaiming at this moment.

But what she imagined did not happen.

Gu lu—

After Lin Xiu swallowed the fire element star like he was drinking water as if nothing happened at all.

“What’s the matter?”

Seeing everyone’s eyes looking towards him, Lin Xiu said curiously.

“You just swallowed fire element star?”

Hu Ling ran over excitedly at this time, carefully glanced at Lin Xiu’s body and found that Lin Xiu was totally fine!

“How is this possible... How is this possible...”

Hu Ling muttered to herself.

What happened seemed to have subverted her worldview.
