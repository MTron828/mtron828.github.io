1420 The Top 100th Rank

After picking his opponent, Lin Xiu could clearly see that there was a bright light that appeared opposite him.

Thank you readers!

Hmm?

Lin Xiu furrowed his brows.

Then, he could slowly see a man standing before him.

“Hmph! I was just thinking who it was who dared to challenge me. Turns out it’s just a kid!”

!!

The man placed the card back into his pocket and sneered as he looked at Lin Xiu.

This was because Lin Xiu didn’t seem like someone strong.

“Has the competition started?”

Lin Xiu asked as he wasn’t sure.

“From the moment I appeared, it has already started. You should appreciate your last moments here.”

The tall, muscular man stared at Lin Xiu and showed a mocking laugh.

Then, he raised the huge machete above his head and swung it at Lin Xiu!

Xiu – –

However, Lin Xiu’s body suddenly disappeared into thin air.

Where did the kid go?!

The warrior’s pupil shrank.

Suddenly, before he could react, Lin Xiu’s body appeared behind him.

Lin Xiu’s fist were covered in flames as he aimed it at the man’s head!

Boom– –

The man didn’t even have time to defend himself and his head was already blasted into a million pieces.

“It’s over already?!”

There weren’t many spectators watching Lin Xiu’s match but those who did were all shocked.

No matter what, that man was still a warrior god!

This was already the last day which was why there were many warriors who decided to join the ranks.

With the victory from earlier, Lin Xiu took over the rank of the man that he had just defeated.

This time, he could only challenge those from 9800th and above.

Similar to before, as soon as he picked his opponent, the other person would be transported into the ring.

“How dare you challenge me…..!”

The man spoke in a cold tone as soon as he appeared.

Boom – –

However, before he could say anything, he saw a fist coming at him!

Then, his head exploded as well.

“Such terrifying strength…”

The rest of the warriors who saw what had happened were all stunned. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

One punch! It was only with one punch!

Then, Lin Xiu continued looking for another opponent.

There weren’t many spectators in the beginning but toward the end, there were more and more people gathering around Lin Xiu’s ring.

Things finally got interesting when he got to challenge the 1000th warrior.

“Hmmm? You do have some tricks up your sleeves.”

The man that attacked Lin Xiu with his machete!

However, Lin Xiu had quick reflexes and he was fast.

Just as Lin Xiu attacked the man with his fist but the man was quick as well. He released his ‘sphere’ and managed to block Lin Xiu’s attack.

“Rubbish!”

Seeing how his ‘sphere’ had defended against Lin Xiu, the man laughed.

“Well, looks like the ones that he fought earlier were all too weak.”

“I thought he was a powerful one. Well, it turns out…”

Some of the warriors started shaking their heads.

However, at the very next moment, there was a loud explosion. All of them who thought that this was all that Lin Xiu had noticed that he now had a spear in his hand and it was driven through the other man’s head!

He even pierced through his opponent’s ‘sphere’!

“Excuse me but I am in a hurry.”

Lin Xiu spoke in a cold tone.

The man’s eyes were opened wide and he couldn’t believe what had happened.

Lin Xiu continued his next challenge.

He clicked on the screen and found his next opponent.

This time, Lin Xiu was already using his spear and most warriors wouldn’t be able to fight him!

...

Most warriors died under Lin Xiu’s spear.

Soon, they were already in the top 100!

“He’s already in the top 100!”

The rest of the spectators were getting hyped as well.

It was the top 100 ranks!!!

This man was crazy!

It only took a day’s time and he managed to come all the way here!

“He wants to challenge Zhou Jichao!”

When the rest saw what Lin Xiu was doing, they looked excited!

Zhou Jichao was the warrior placed at 100th.

This was a competition that gathered all of the strongest warrior gods across the realm.

It wasn’t easy for them to get into the top 100!

“This boy actually got into the top 100.”

“Perhaps he wants to get to the top since it’s already the last day?”

Some of them were incredibly surprised.

“That’s impossible. Those who are in the top 100 aren’t ordinary warriors. You will know once he fights Zhou Jichao.”

There were some who shook their heads in disagreement.

Although it looked like Lin Xiu had no trouble defeating those before, the warriors in the top 100 were not a joke!

“I didn’t think that there would be an idiot who would challenge me on the last day.”

Zhou Jichao was a warrior with a huge warhammer.

As he looked at Lin Xiu, he let out a cold laugh.

“Zhou Jichao accepted the challenge!”

Most of the crowd gathered around their ring.

Lin Xiu ignored him and rushed forward with the spear in his hand.

Xiu – –

Lin Xiu was quick and he already stood right in front of Zhou Jichao.

Then, Lin Xiu thrust the spear forward.

The look in Zhou Jichao’s eyes changed.

He lifted his warhammer and tried to defend himself with it!

Boom– –

The tip of the spear landed on the warhammer and it was followed by a huge sound.

The strong impact of it caused Zhou Jichao to take several steps back.

But, Lin Xiu did not stop. His spear was attacking like mad!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

The long spear got thrusted forward and there was like a storm of spears!

Zhou Jichao could only defend himself and he had no way of attacking the other party!

How did this man become so powerful?!

Zhou Jichao thought that he could easily defeat Lin Xiu but he didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be so powerful!

The scariest thing was that the tip of the spear had already caused dents on his warhammer after several collisions!

“Leave!!!”

Zhou Jichao suddenly roared and released all of the energy in his body.

As the huge surge of energy was released, Lin Xiu frowned but quickly took a few steps backwards.

“The Raging God’s Attack!!!”

The energy that he had released caused Lin Xiu to take a few steps back. Then, he raised his warhammer above his head!

Boom – –

Then, there was a loud explosion that filled the air.
