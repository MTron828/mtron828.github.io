1472 Sky Eye

Sky Eye’s huge head then turned over toward Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu looked at Sky Eye’s huge figure as well and the look in his eyes changed.

As he controlled it with his mind, he drew an arc in the sky with his long spear.

Boom boom – –

Then, there were countless flaming birds that headed towards the Sky Eye!

All of these were made of the Flame of Chaos. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

They were extremely powerful.

Lin Xiu took the time to look into his system.

Suddenly, he noticed that he couldn’t check anything in his system!

What was going on?!

Lin Xiu felt confused.

His brain was blank and there was only a bright ray of light seen.

” [Analytic Eye], [Rage], [Disguise], [Engulf], [Mirror Image], [Heavenly Array], [Reset], [Power of the Stars], [Golden Body Immortality], [Exotic Summoning], [Sacrifice], [Skill Enhancement], [Source Strength Control], [Profound Intent].”

There was only a brightly lit energy in his mind.

Amongst the light, the names of all the warriors’ skills appeared.

Lin Xiu then heard a peculiar voice coming from inside his mind.

“Right now, you will be able to use all of them as you please.”

“Which one would you like to be enhanced?”

When Lin Xiu heard the voice, he was stunned.

“Who are you?!”

Lin Xiu asked subconsciously.

This voice was different from the automated voice heard from before. It was obvious that this was a person with emotions.

“Who am I?”

The person sounded mysterious.

Wait!

Lin Xiu then suddenly thought of what Zhu Long had told him earlier and asked, “Are you…. The True God?”

The True God!

Zhu Long has once said that it may have been the True God who gave him the system.

“Alright. You only have three seconds to decide which of these becomes your ultimate skill.”

The voice did not give an answer to Lin Xiu’s question.

“One.”

“Two.”

“Source Strength Control!”

Just before the voice counted to three, Lin Xiu made his choice.

With the answer, Lin Xiu was then kicked out of his system that was inside his mind.

“Useless tricks!!!”

At the same time, the flaming birds made of the flames of chaos were headed for Sky Eye.

Then, there was a huge shield made of his source energy and it managed to stop all of the flaming birds.

Boom boom boom – –

As the flames collided with the energy shield, there were countless loud sounds heard.

There were cracks that appeared on the shield but at the same time, the Flame of Chaos has gotten weaker as well.

Sky Eye was able to push them away casually as the Flame of Chaos were now much weaker.

“Well, the hellfire formed from your source energy is skill weak.”

Sky Eye sneered as he mocked Lin Xiu.

Then, he raised his huge fist and threw a punch at Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank uncontrollably when he saw what happened.

He quickly shifted his body and disappeared.

Boom – –

The punch landed on where Lin Xiu was standing previously.

His punch was not only enormous, it was also quick.

As the punch landed on the ground, the entire planet almost blasted into a million pieces.

There was also a loud sound that followed as the punch landed on where Lin Xiu was standing.

As he pulled back his fist, one could clearly see the huge, gigantic dent left behind on the ground.

It looked as if a meteorite had hit the ground.

“This man’s abilities have become even stronger.”

Zhu Long’s figure suddenly appeared next to Lin Xiu and he looked surprised as well.

“Is there any way that I could kill him now?”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were still fixed on Sky Eye.

Although Lin Xiu had already dodged over to the other side, Sky Eye was too big! Even if they looked up to the sky, they could only see half of Sky Eye’s body.

“With your abilities now, it’s not possible.”

As Zhu Long spoke, another punch came at Lin Xiu.

It managed to hit Lin Xiu and his body instantly exploded.

“You’re moving fast.”

Sky Eye’s voice echoed through the space.

This was because he knew that he had only destroyed one of Lin Xiu’s split images.

There were countless ‘Lin Xiu’s that appeared all over the place.

The entire planet was now covered with a faint white glow.

Heavenly Array!

With all of the skills unlocked, Lin Xiu was able to use all of them with no restrictions!

Then, he released ‘Rage’ as well.

Lin Xiu’s body was instantly filled with energy.

At the same time, he could only have multiple split images while using ‘Mirror Image’.

Every split image of his would have at least 65% of his strength!

Then, all of the ‘Lin Xiu’s started moving the spears that they had.

Boom boom boom – –

Countless loud collisions were heard and a large number of flaming birds were released.

All of them were targeted it Sky Eye!

Lin Xiu was able to release a large number of them at the same time.

As they were released, they did not attack Sky Eye immediately. Instead, they gathered together in the air!

With all of them gathered together, there was a huge flaming phoenix that appeared.

The phoenix was huge and it covered the entire sky!

“GO!!!!!!”

All of the ‘Lin Xiu’s roared together.

The huge phoenix then rushed over to Sky Eye!

When Sky Eye saw the phoenix, he had a different look in his eyes.

This was the flame of chaos!

Plus, there was such a large amount of it that formed the flaming phoenix and the effect of it must be horrifying!

Instantly, the air around them was scorching hot.

Sky Eye then opened his mouth and there was blue energy that rushed into it.

What was that?!

Seeing how the blue energy was getting collected in that huge mouth, Lin Xiu had no idea what was going on.

Just as the phoenix was about to hit Sky Eye, he had spitted out the blue energy from his mouth at the same time!

Both the energy that collided in the air.

Boom boom – –

There was a ear-piercing explosion heard.

As both energies collided, there were also bright fireworks that appeared in the air.

There were also large cracks that appeared all over the ground around them due to the huge impact.
