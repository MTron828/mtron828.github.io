Chapter 817: Reunited At Last

Luo Yue?!

When he heard those words, Lin Xiu was beyond surprised.

On the other hand, she was about to walk out of the tunnel but her body was trembling.

Perhaps they share the same name or could it be him…..?

Lin Xiu turned towards the tunnel and saw that the familiar figure walking out of it.

“Wow! Such a beau!”

“She is pretty but she looks cold.”

As Luo Yue walked out of the tunnel, the audience got into an uproar.

“He…..he’s here?!”

Luo Yan, who was on the side, widened her eyes in shock as well as she couldn’t believe what she was seeing.

Although there wasn’t much expression on her face....

Her entire body was trembling.

Lin Xiu stared at Luo Yue who was walking towards the stage and his lips were shaking as well.

“Match Start!”

The announcer screamed into the mic but none of them started the fight. Instead, they were walking slowly step by step towards each other.

Each step that they took felt so far.

Lin Xiu was still walking while his eyes were locked onto Luo Yue. He smiled and even when he thought that he was good with controlling his expression, he was still shaking from head to toe.

“This…..”

When the judges saw what was happening, they were all shocked. None of them knew what was happening.

The audience stared at them with wide eyes as well as they had no idea what was about to happen next.

Lin Xiu stood in front of Luo Yue and slowly reached out his right arm that was trembling. He placed it on Luo Yue’s face and gently wiped off the tears that were on her face.

“I’m sorry I came late.”

Both of them dropped their weapons to the ground and there was a loud sound that rang across the room.

Then, both of them finally hugged each other.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath. He could finally take in a breath of Luo Yue’s scent and he was touching her.

This caused Lin Xiu’s eyes to turn red.

Luo Yue….I really….really missed you.

“Me too...”

As if she could read his mind, Luo Yue whispered to Lin Xiu.

From the moment she saw Lin Xiu and when Lin Xiu met with her eyes, Luo Yue noticed that she didn’t even have the courage to speak to him.

She really, really missed him.

“What…..what on earth is happening?!”

Qian Jing widened his eyes in shock as well. He was completely clueless with what happened on stage.

How did Lin Xiu meet a student of the Xuanfeng Academy?

The rest of the audience started discussing what was happening as it completely caught them off guard.

“Are you still going to fight?!”

The judges finally came back to their senses and asked.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu reluctantly let go of Luo Yue who was in his arms and chuckled as he asked Luo Yue.

“Sure.”

“We will be forfeiting this match.”

Forfeit?!

Due to the powerful skills that Lin Xiu had shown earlier, most of them were still waiting for him to show more.

They wanted to see how much more powerful he could be.

However, they didn’t expect Lin Xiu to forfeit the match!

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue picked up their weapons and jumped off the stage.

“Congratulations,Young Master Huang. I heard about your engagement which will be happening 2 weeks from now?”

At the same time, there was another flirtatious man that walked out of the tunnel as he spoke to Huang Zhen.

“Of course. It is a marriage proposed by my uncle. The Luo family will be delighted.”

As they were walking out of the tunnel, they soon noticed Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

Both of them held hands as they walked out of the building.

When Lin Xiu saw them, the look on his face changed.

“What happened?!”

The man standing next to him asked out of curiosity.

“Who is that brat?!” Huang Zhen growled in rage.

At the same time, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue had already left the building.

“Lin Xiu, long time no see.”

Both of them had left the stadium and were headed towards a suburban area when they saw Luo Yan, who suddenly appeared.

“It’s been a long time.” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lin Xiu gave a bright smile in return.

Seeing how Luo Yan was looking at them with a suspicious look, Luo Yue blushed.

“How did you get here?”

Luo Yan had to ask as she was curious.

Luo Yue turned towards Lin Xiu as well.

She knew this planet too well and no matter if it was the strength of a warrior or an evolved beast, they were much stronger than what they’ve met on earth.

He must have suffered a lot in order to get here.

“I just took it one step at a time.”

Lin Xiu said it casually.

“Let’s….head back to earth.”

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue and his eyes were filled with warmth and joy.

Although the air here had much more energy than earth and it was a much more suitable place for them to cultivate...

Earth was still their home.

Plus, he still had other things to complete back on earth.

Luo Yue nodded her head.

“We….won’t be able to leave now.”

Luo Yan thought of what would happen to the Luo family and frowned.

“Leave…? Where do you think you’re going?”

Right at that moment, there was a stranger’s voice that appeared from behind them.

As they took a closer look, they realised it was Huang Zhen who brought along ten more warriors with him.

“Brat! She is the woman that I had eyes on and my uncle has already announced the engagement. You are asking for a death wish by being so bold!”

Huang Zhen glared at Lin Xiu and said with a horrible looking expression on his face.

“You’re Huang Zhen? My sister will never be married to someone as disgusting as you!”

Luo Yan pointed at Huang Zhen as she screamed at him.

“You...”

As he was being scolded by Luo Yan, Huang Zhen was stunned but as he looked at Lin Xiu, his eyes were filled with rage.

He had already taken Luo Yue as one of his own properties. His eyes had a murderous look in them as he glared at Lin Xiu.

“Kill him!”

Huang Zhen gave orders to his men and the rest of the warriors rushed towards Lin Xiu!

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered. He picked up his long spear and started spinning it.

The look on Luo Yue’s face changed as she pulled out her sword and tried to help with defending those who were coming after Lin Xiu.

Damn it!

Luo Yan cursed to herself. The men that Huang Zhen brought were mostly warrior masters.

Luo Yan might be at the peak of a rank 9 warrior, the difference between her and these master warriors was still huge.

These warriors were throwing deadly skills towards them one after another. Lin Xiu did not hide his true abilities as well as he released all of them at once.

‘Awe of the Phoenix’!!!

As he swung his spear, he managed to block all the attack from the other warriors and soon there were flaming birds that were flying towards the warriors.

Koong loong – –

Although they were only diamond rank skills, the temperature of the flames were still extremely high as they were hellfire!

“AHHHHHH!!!”

Some of the warriors caught on fire after being touched by the flaming birds and they started screaming on top of their lungs while rolling helplessly on the ground.

The rest of the warriors released their ‘Yuan’ as well and noticed that they ‘Yuan’ was still being distorted from the heat that was coming from the horrible flame!
