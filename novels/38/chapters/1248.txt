1249 Devouring Black Ball

The weapons that were absorbed in the Shachang warehouse before have all appeared here.

This Rollie was simply like a mobile warehouse.

“A sword made of black marble…a long sword made of gold, rock and iron…”

The well-informed Mr. Pang, looking at the mountains of weapons on the ground, couldn’t help but gasped.

!!

These weapons were all made of very precious materials.

They were very good weapons.

These kinds of weapons were like free of charge, piled up like a mountain.

“Mr. Pang, let’s distribute these weapons to the guards in the mansion first.”

Lin Xiu said to Mr. Pang who was still in shock.

“Okay…”

“Wait, City lord, really?”

Mr. Pang was about to nod, but when he came to his senses, he stared at Lin Xiu in disbelief.

“Of course.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

These weapons were no use to him at all.

But for other guards, they were indeed very rare.

“You can choose one too.”

Lin Xiu looked at Mr. Pang, then said.

This Mr. Pang didn’t seem to have a decent weapon either. His City Lord’s Mansion was really poor.

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu was a little dumbfounded.

“yes!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Mr. Pang froze for a moment, then suppressed his inner excitement and said.

“I’ve brought back the materials, Lei Tong, can I make an energy barrier now?”

While watching Mr. Pang lead the guards of the City Lord’s Mansion to choose weapons, Lin Xiu said to Lei Tong at the back.

“You can do it now!”

Lei Tong said a little excitedly.

Before that, Lin Xiu searched a lot of odd crystals in the warehouse of the City Lord’s Mansion in Shachang City.

There were also many god-level odd crystals.

Using those odd crystals, it is possible to build a powerful energy barrier.

“How much do you need?”

“The more the better.”

Lei Tong said seriously.

“The more god-level odd crystals for the energy cores, the stronger the energy barrier would be.”

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then waved his right hand and a large number of odd crystals appeared in front of Lei Tong.

Looking at the odd crystals in front of him, Lei Tong opened his mouth wide and seemed to be stunned.

“Then use these one hundred god-level odd crystals as energy cores.”

Lin Xiu said seriously to Lei Tong.

Not sure how many years it took Shachang City to collect these god-level odd crystals.

Any warrior would probably go crazy seeing so many god-level odd crystals.

But now Lin Xiu actually wants to take out these 100 god-level odd crystals, all of which are used as the core driving force for building the energy barrier.

“For real?”

Lei Tong’s eyes were still wide open and his eyes were full of disbelief.

After all, these are one hundred god-level odd crystals!

“Why, didn’t you say that the more god-level odd crystals you have, the stronger the energy barrier you can build?”

Lin Xiu frowned.

“Could it be that you can’t build it?”

“Can! Of course I can!”

Speaking of this, Lei Tong said excitedly.

He was very confident in building an energy barrier.

Now that the most critical power core is in place, there wouldn’t be any issue.

“Then take them.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Okay!”

At this time, Lei Tong was not pretentious either and held the hundred god-level odd crystals in his hands.

...

“I’m going to build it now!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu trusted him so much that he directly handed over the hundred odd crystals to him and was not afraid of him running away with them, Lei Tong also suddenly had the feeling that he would die for his confidant.

Holding these odd crystals, he walked directly to the workshop that was built a few days ago.

“You gave him so many odd crystals directly, aren’t you afraid of him running away?”

Baili Haoling asked.

“He can’t even run if he wanted to.”

Lin Xiu shrugged. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

And he could tell that Lei Tong was not this kind of person.

“I’m so tired. I’m going to take a rest.”

Lin Xiu stretched and walked directly to his room.

Baili Haoling also returned to her room.

...

After returning to his room, Lin Xiu sat down cross-legged and took out the black energy ball found in the warehouse in Shachang City.

“This is clearly an energy group…”

Lin Xiu held the black ball with one hand and said to himself.

Although the black ball was extremely heavy, Lin Xiu didn’t feel anything.

With Lin Xiu’s current strength, the weight he can carry with one arm was ridiculously high.

Rollie was still on Lin Xiu’s shoulder, its small eyes were staring at the black ball in Lin Xiu’s hand.

It seemed as if it wanted to devour the black ball.

“Do you want to eat this?”

Lin Xiu held the black ball, shook it in front of Rollie and said.

“Gu gu!”

Rollie could understand Lin Xiu’s words and seemed very excited at this moment.

“But I won’t give it to you.”

Seeing that Rollie seemed a little excited, Lin Xiu directly moved the black ball to the other side so that Rollie could not touch it.

After rolling on Lin Xiu’s shoulder for a while, it felt helpless and stopped moving.

Lin Xiu thought about it for a while, then tried to use the analytic eye.

But as soon as he used the Analytic Eye, the words ‘unable to analyze’ appeared in his mind.

“There is still no way to analyze it…”

Lin Xiu was a little sad.

According to Rollie’s reaction, this thing is obviously an excellent thing.

Otherwise, Rollie wouldn’t want to devour it.

but…

Can I devour it myself?

Lin Xiu thought about it.

Rollie can eat anything, so it would be fine but Lin Xiu wasn’t Rollie ah.

In case something happens after eating…

Originally, he wanted to put the black ball directly into the expansion space, but he thought that my ‘Fury’ and ‘Reset’ skills were currently in a cooling state.

During this period of time, if a warrior with the same strength as Sha Qiong came to make trouble, it would be a great threat to Lin Xiu.

Why don’t I… give it a try?

Looking at the black ball held by his right hand, Lin Xiu was a little moved.

Although this thing looked like a black iron ball, Lin Xiu used a little force and found that the black ball was a bit elastic.

It can be pinched down.

But soon the sunken position returned to its original state.

“Eh?”

Lin Xiu was surprised.

Before Lin Xiu didn’t realize that this thing was not completely hard.

“Could it be… really edible?”

Lin Xiu mumbled to himself.

Looking at the black sphere in front of him, Lin Xiu gritted his teeth, then opened his mouth and bit down!!
