Chapter 466: Heartbeat

“Lin Xiu?! You’re awake?!” When he saw what happened, Nan Zhengjun jumped in shock as well and screamed in excitement.

Lin Xiu looked around him with his wide eyes. When he saw Luo Yue, the look in his eyes changed.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu immediately jumped out of bed and hugged Luo Yue.

“I’m awake! I’m finally awake!” Lin Xiu was screaming in excitement and he started to sound a little psycho.

Luo Yue was stunned and she didn’t know where to put her hands.

But, it was obvious from her face that she was still extremely happy that Lin Xiu was awake.

Lin Xiu was still hugging Luo Yue. He couldn’t help but take a deep breath when he could clearly feel her presence.

There is a gentle scent on Luo Yue and it was extremely comforting which made Lin Xiu feel safe.

Now, Lin Xiu finally remembered what happened before he passed out.

It was the side effect from ‘Rage’. His entire body turned weak and he could no longer protect himself with ‘Yuan’.

Naturally, with the lack of energy, Lin Xiu’s body would have been corroded by the acid that was inside the stomach.

His body has been badly damaged.

When he was in that situation, Lin Xiu had already given up, thinking that no one would be able to save him, which is why he has chosen to activate the rank 3 Gene Lock!

Right after that, Lin Xiu turned unconscious.

When he finally regained consciousness, he was delighted to see Luo Yue who was right in front of him.

This was because he was still alive!!!

The rank 3 Gene Lock has been unlocked! It was a success!!

“I think it’s time for you to let go?” Luo Yu’s face was flushing red but no one seemed to have noticed the change on her face.

“Mmhm.” Lin Xiu finally came back to his senses and quickly let go of her as soon as he heard what Luo Yue said.

Seeing how there was still a cannula in his hand, Lin Xiu removed it.

This was to deliver nutrients into his body but he no longer needed it now.

“Lin Xiu, how are you feeling?” Nan Zhengjun looked at Lin Xiu and smiled.

He finally let out a breath of relief when Lin Xiu woke up from his coma.

As for the doctor next to Nan Zhengjun, he was staring at Lin Xiu with his eyes widened.

He would have never believed that Lin Xiu actually woke up!

And he was looking extremely energetic.

How is this possible…

“I feel great.” Lin Xiu smiled, showing his bright teeth.

What he said was true. Lin Xiu felt as if he had been reborn.

It felt comfortable.

“Oh, by the way, how many days have I been asleep?” Lin Xiu suddenly thought about it and asked the others.

He has already unlocked a rank 3 Gene Lock. If he wasn’t dead, it would have meant that he had succeeded and fallen into a deep sleep.

But, he has no idea how long he has been asleep.

“Five days. You have been asleep for five days.” Nan Zhengjun showed a five with his hands and showed it to Lin Xiu.

After hearing the answer from Nan Zhengjun, Lin Xiu was a little surprised but he was extremely shocked about it.

He thought that it was normal for him to be unconscious for at least 10 days.

“During the times where you were in a coma, Luo Yue was the one who has been taking care of you. You should really thank her.” Nan Zhengjun smiled before saying it.

When Lin Xiu heard what Nan Zhengjun said, he was shocked. He turned towards Luo Yue and noticed that Luo Yue had been looking at him as well.

As their eyes met, Lin Xiu was stunned.

Lin Xiu gave a gentle look and said, “Luo…”

“There are some things that I have to attend to.” Luo Yue said, turned around, and left the room.

Lin Xiu, who has finally gathered his courage to say something to her, suddenly felt like there was something in his throat.

Nan Zhengjun felt that this was getting interesting and gave an intrigued look in his eyes.

Due to what was happening between them, it does look as if the both of them have feelings for each other but they just needed someone to unleash the thin film between them.

This was interesting; very interesting indeed.

“Teacher Nan, I’ll be leaving now.” Lin Xiu felt depressed while speaking to Nan Zhengjun.

“You’re a man. Be brave.” When he heard the tone in Lin Xiu’s voice, he patted Lin Xiu’s shoulders.

Lin Xiu had questions in his mind after hearing what Nan Zhengjun said. This man has been single his entire life but he is teaching Lin Xiu how to get a girl?

However, as he thought about Luo Yue, Lin Xu felt devastated as well. Why did that girl run away all of a sudden?

Luo Yue has always been someone who never showed what she truly felt which is why It was difficult for anyone to know what was on her mind.

Well, for Lin Xiu who has recently spent a lot of time with her, he was able to guess a few but as for this time, Lin Xiu had no idea what she was thinking.

When Luo Yue got outside, she looked as if she was in a daze.

As she thought of the look that Lin Xiu had in his eyes and what he wanted to say a while ago, Luo Yue felt something peculiar.

Her heart was racing and it was beating so hard that it was about to come out of her chest.

Then, she touched her cheeks and realized that they were warm as well.

“What’s wrong with me?” Luo Yue placed her hand over her chest and mumbled to herself.

Until today, Luo Yue has always been clear-minded and this was the very first time that she has felt this way. It felt as if she was sick.

“Huu…. this feels good.” Lin Xiu walked out of the hospital and was looking around but he failed to find Luo Yue.

He stretched his back and he felt extremely comfortable all over.

After waking up from his coma, Lin Xiu could feel that each and every cell in his body was filled with energy.

He took a good look around and everything around him had become incredibly clear.

“Looks like it isn’t just my strength, even my internal organs have evolved.” Lin Xiu could feel that difference that has happened in his body after unlocking the Gene Lock. He clenched his hands into a fist and mumbled to himself.

Just as he was about to head back to his home, he saw Nan Zhengjun running towards him.

“Lin Xiu! Wait!”

“What’s wrong?” Nan Zhengjun got to him and Lin Xiu asked out of curiosity.

“Dean Baili wants you to meet him at his office.” Nan Zhengjun thought about it before saying it to Lin Xiu.

Dean Baili has reminded him over and over to inform him once Lin Xiu is awake which is why the dean already knew that Lin Xiu was awake. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
