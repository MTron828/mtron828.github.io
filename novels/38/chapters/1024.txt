Chapter 1025: Tearing The Arm

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

When the guards heard Lin Xiu’s words, their expressions changed greatly.

This person dared to scold the head of their Zhao family!

“Ah! Let me go!”

The guard who was pinched by Lin Xiu’s wrist felt the sharp pain coming from his wrist and couldn’t help crying out.

He was about to wave his other hand and attack Lin Xiu!

boom–

But at this moment, Lin Xiu lifted his foot and kicked him out.

Boom—

He didn’t even have time to mobilize his own power and was kicked out by Lin Xiu. He hit the wall behind him and knocked a big hole in the wall.

A warrior at the Respected warrior level was kicked away by Lin Xiu like a piece of trash!?

Those Respected warrior-level warriors who were guarding the door were full of horror in their eyes at this time.

“Call Zhao Ran to get out here.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“kill him!!!”

When the gatekeepers saw that Lin Xiu was still so arrogant, they immediately shouted loudly.

At this moment, all the source energy of their bodies burst out.

Holding the weapons in their hands, they all attacked Lin Xiu!

Just as their weapons were about to hit Lin Xiu’s body, Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” unfolded directly.

As Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” unfolded, all their weapons attacked Lin Xiu’s “Sphere”.

bang bang bang-

With a loud noise, Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” unfolded, resisting all their attacks!

And what’s even more terrifying is that Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ has a dark blue flame.

These flames are too terrifying, let the weapons of these warriors attack this ‘Sphere’ and instantly feel a severe pain in their arms holding the weapons.

Makes them almost unable to hold the weapons in their hands.

Lin Xiu’s thoughts moved at this time, he waved his right hand and dark blue flames burst out directly towards them.

boom boom boom —

In the next moment, the bodies of these people were covered by a large number of flames.

“what!!!”

The flames were so terrifying; as soon as they touched their bodies, they burned like crazy.

Even if they tried their best to use source strength to resist, it would not help at all.

Soon, these warriors turned into coke and fell to the ground.

These were warriors at the Respected warrior level! They died so easily!?

The warriors who were inside the Zhao’s house were full of shock when they saw the situation outside.

“Again, once again, tell Zhao Ran to get out.”

Lin Xiu’s body was suspended at this time and he said indifferently.

Whoosh whoosh—

At this moment, those heavy weapons below Zhao’s house immediately shot at Lin Xiu!

A large number of energy beams, as well as various laser rays, all impacted Lin Xiu’s body.

Lin Xiu’s figure was suspended in the air without moving.

As soon as the ‘Sphere’ was unfolded, it immediately blocked a large number of beams.

Unscathed.

“Damn!!!”

The Zhao family members below were stunned when they saw this scene.

Boom—

And at the next moment, with a loud noise, they saw a huge figure descending from the sky.

Artificial Angel.

“kill.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

The next moment, the artificial angel waved the spear in her hand frantically and attacked the surrounding buildings!

boom boom boom —

The surrounding ground shook in an instant, making a loud noise after another.

Those warriors, as well as those who control heavy weapons, all attacked the artificial angel at the same time.

But artificial angels have energy barriers.

After the artificial angel deployed the energy barrier, all those attacks were blocked by the energy barrier.

The artificial angel did not suffer any damage at all.

And at this time, a lot of energy gathered on the spear of the artificial angel.

Boom—

As she waved the spear in her hand again, a loud noise erupted from the front.

At this moment, the entire ground vibrated crazily again.

The entire Zhao family building, under the attack of artificial angels, kept collapsing and being destroyed.

“Not coming out, huh?”

“Then I will tear down your Zhao family.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“enough!”

Just when Lin Xiu sent an order to let the artificial angel continue to attack, a loud shout came from the other side.

At this moment, as soon as his words fell, two figures flew over from the other side and flew into the sky.

Looking at this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly.

At this moment, Lin Xiu clearly saw that Zhao Ran appeared in the air opposite him carrying an old man.

The old man was undoubtedly Sima Qiang.

It’s just that the current Sima Qiang looks extremely battered.

The clothes on his body were tattered, his hair was disheveled and there was an iron cable passing through his shoulder blade.

“I didn’t expect that you kid would come back alive.”

Zhao Ran stared at Lin Xiu with murderous intent in his eyes.

But at the same time, he also had a cautious look in his eyes.

Because Lin Xiu dared to come back again, then his strength must have improved and he had the confidence to deal with him.

“Let go of him.”

Lin Xiu looked at Zhao Ran and said lightly.

“Let him go? Do you think it’s possible?”

With his left hand holding Sima Qiang’s body, he said with a strange smile.

“Is that so.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

In the next moment, the body instantly disappeared!

Seeing this scene, Zhao Ran’s pupils shrank suddenly.

When he reacted, Lin Xiu had already appeared behind him!

boom–

Lin Xiu, who appeared behind him, directly grabbed his arm and tore it off violently!

“what!!!”

Zhao Ran let out a whimper at this moment and as his arm was torn off by Lin Xiu, blood spurted out in the air.

Although he suffered such severe pain, he still reacted quickly and his body disappeared.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly, then helped Sima Qiang to fly to the ground.

Zhao Ran’s left hand, which was torn off by Lin Xiu, was still holding onto Sima Qiang’s body.

Lin Xiu pulled the broken arm away with a little tug.

Boom—

And in the next moment, the arm instantly burst into a dark blue flame.

burnt directly.

“Are you alright?” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Lin Xiu put Sima Qiang on the ground, then asked.

“Cough, cough… I’m fine…”

Sima Qiang shook his head at this time.

Although he said so, it was still obvious that his current state was very bad.

Moreover, on the shoulder blade, there was an iron cable running through the bone and blood was constantly seeping out.
