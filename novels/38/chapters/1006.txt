Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

As Huangfu Bai’s voice came over, Lin Xiu saw his figure and appeared in front of him!

“Do you think you can escape?”

Huangfu Bai looked at Lin Xiu in front of him with a sinister smile.

“The entire space is now covered by my energy. I can find you wherever you are.”

He looked at Lin Xiu in front of him, but didn’t make another move.

He found that it was too easy for him to kill Lin Xiu.

“Boy, although you devoured my divine power last time, I can still give you a chance to live.”

Huangfu Bai looked at Lin Xiu and said with a grin.

“Surrender to my Divine Domain and with your strength, I think, there is still a chance to meet in the Divine Domain next time.”

Huangfu Bai said, then reached out and grabbed Lin Xiu’s head.

“Don’t resist, surrender to the Divine Domain…”

He was talking, but there was an invisible force that was radiating from his body.

Just when his hand was about to touch Lin Xiu’s head, Lin Xiu directly held the spear and stabbed him in the body!

boom–

The Dark Edge spear, at this moment, directly penetrated his body!

“Damn boy…”

When Huangfu Bai saw this scene, his face suddenly turned hideous.

But at this time, Huangfu Bai was controlled by someone from the divine domain in the Sage warrior space, so he didn’t feel the slightest pain.

Huangfu Bai ignored the long spear that pierced through his body and directly raised his hand to face Lin Xiu.

In his raised palm, extremely terrifying energy gathered together.

He blasted directly at Lin Xiu!

“Disappeared again!?”

But at the moment when these terrifying energies blasted toward Lin Xiu, Huangfu Bai could clearly feel that Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared again.

“But what can you do without a weapon?”

Looking at the Dark Edge spear that was pierced through his body, Huangfu Bai directly pulled out the spear and muttered to himself coldly.

Ocean, at this time Lin Xiu’s figure has already flashed over to the ocean.

Lin Xiu did not float above the ocean, but dived directly into the bottom of the sea.

Lin Xiu in the ocean was like being on land, there was no difference.

Lin Xiu, who has unlocked the gene lock, has long been able to breathe through his skin.

Lin Xiu’s body was suspended in the ocean and with the movement of his thoughts, the source air in the ocean frantically gathered towards Lin Xiu.

No, not only the ocean, but the energy of the entire Sage warrior space seems to be madly gathering towards Lin Xiu!

“what is this…”

The warriors in the Sage warrior Space were already very surprised when they saw the golden energy that spread over and now they feel that the source air around them is rushing in another direction and they are even more surprised.

“My source strength…”

What surprised them, even more, was that the source strength of their bodies seemed to begin to decrease.

“Huh? Did you hide in the sea?”

At this moment, the figure of Huangfu Bai also appeared on the ocean.

“Do you think you can escape?”

Just when Huangfu Bai was about to rush into the ocean below, the pupils in his eyes shrank.

Because he clearly felt that there was a lot of source energy around him, rushing towards this side!

Passed by his body and rushed into the ocean.

“Come back!”

Lin Xiu, who was in the ocean, said lightly.

As soon as he finished speaking, in the next moment, the Dark Edge spear on the other side flew directly towards Lin Xiu.

swoosh—

The Dark Edge spear that flew at a high speed went passed Huangfu Bai’s body and charged directly into the ocean.

boom–

As Lin Xiu took hold of the Dark Edge spear that flew back, a large amount of source air and source strength had already gathered on Lin Xiu’s body!

clap clap-

The entire ocean, at this moment, seems to be boiling!

“Pulling all sorts of tricks, come out here!!!”

The more Huangfu Bai looked at this situation, the more he felt that something was wrong, because the energies around him were rushing into the ocean like crazy!

With a wave of his right hand, streaks of golden rays of light were suddenly released from the five fingers, grabbing directly towards the bottom of the ocean!

Those golden rays of light continued to extend, going towards Lin Xiu’s body in the ocean!

But at this moment, the source air and source strength that kept pouring into Lin Xiu’s body directly condensed into a huge ‘Sphere’, wrapping Lin Xiu’s body!

slap-

As soon as the five rays of light touched the huge ‘Sphere’ formed by the condensed source air, they bounced back.

And at this time, Lin Xiu’s body slowly emerged from the ocean.

what is this!?

As Lin Xiu’s figure slowly emerged, Huangfu Bai’s eyes widened.

Lin Xiu’s body was surrounded by a huge circular source strength.

The energy contained in the ‘Sphere’ produced by the mixing of these source strength and air is extremely terrifying.

Even Huangfu Bai, who has now acquired a powerful ability, is full of shock and there is a touch of… fear!

Whoosh whoosh—

And at this time, it wasn’t over yet, the terrifying energy contained in the ocean was still frantically gathering towards Lin Xiu.

The huge ‘Sphere’ formed by that mass of source air was still expanding.

“Courting death!!!”

When Huangfu Bai saw this scene, he couldn’t bear it any longer.

He waved his hands frantically and the golden energy beams, as he waved his hands, immediately charged toward Lin Xiu!

When the golden energy beam, which seemed to be able to break through space, hit the huge sphere formed by source air, it disappeared directly.

“This… this is impossible!!!”

When Huangfu Bai saw this scene, he immediately roared.

A smirk appeared on the corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth.

At this time, he felt that his body was enveloped by this huge source air and every part of Lin Xiu’s body seemed to be filled with majestic power.

System Skill – ‘Source strength control’!

This was the first time Lin Xiu had used this system skill.

Unexpectedly, this ‘Source strength control’ skill is so powerful.

Now Lin Xiu can feel that the source of the entire Sage warrior space seems to be gathering towards him!

Those creatures in the ocean, the source strength of microorganisms, all rushed towards Lin Xiu!

In an instant, such a huge source strength ball was formed.

“Go!!!”

At this time, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, Lin Xiu waved directly at Huangfu Bai who was not far away!

Boom—

At this moment, with the waving of the long spear, the incomparably huge ball of source strength charged toward Huangfu Bai!

Huangfu Bai’s eyes widened and he felt a strong sense of oppression. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He actually had no way to dodge at this time!
