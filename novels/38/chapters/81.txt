Chapter 82: Crazy Lottery

The backpack contained some medicinal powder to stop bleeding. Lin Xiu poured the medicinal powder over his wound. In just a short moment, the place where the sword went through stopped bleeding.

“Hu.” Lin Xiu took a deep breath. In the next second, he took Tang Mubai’s sword, carried his backpack, and continued to sit on top of the android wolf and advanced forward.

The android wolf’s body was very wide and as Lin Xiu was too tired, he simply laid on it and let the android wolf bring him forward.

Oh right, he hadn’t looked at his current stats yet.

At this moment, he went into the system in his head.

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: Level 15

Experience: 695,441 (2,990,537 experience points required for the next level)

Strength: 251

Physique: 100

Speed: 75

Skill: ‘Analytic Eye’, ‘Rage’, ‘Disguise’

Rage build-up: 0/100

Overall combat strength: 1,875

Potential point: 0

Title: Rank 1 warrior

Seeing this image, Lin Xiu gasped. He didn’t expect that his stats actually went up so much within a short period of time!

His Strength was already 251!!!

If his ‘cultivation technique’ kept up, then his combat strength would have reached above 2,000 and he would break through to rank 3. By then, he would be able to cultivate body skills and his combat ability would reach another level!

Oh wait, why did his title still show ‘rank 1 warrior’?

Lin Xiu went blank for a second, then opened the upside-down triangle next to his title. There was a ‘rank 2 warrior’ title that could be selected.

Lin Xiu clicked into it and a system prompt appeared instantly: “Do you want to change the title?”

“Yes!”

As Lin Xiu clicked to confirm, the title column suddenly changed to show ‘rank 2 warrior’, and at this moment, Lin Xiu could clearly feel his strength increasing slightly.

Taking a closer look, there was a note behind the title of rank 2 warrior: Increase in Strength by 5%.

In other words, his strength had increased to 263, the decimal point behind should have been written off.

Lin Xiu looked at the system mail and just recalled that before the upgrade, he won many lottery chances. When he checked the lottery column, he realized that he had accumulated four chances!

Lin Xiu was delighted and quickly opened the lottery wheel.

There were still ten sections on the lottery wheel this time. But to Lin Xiu’s surprise, these sections didn’t have the same rewards as before, they had all become ‘?’ and he couldn’t see what they were at all.

‘Question mark? What are they?’

“Congratulations Master on receiving a chance on the lottery, there’s a chance that your award would be multiplied for today’s lottery!”

It was at this time that a system notification resounded in Lin Xiu’s mind.

‘Multiplied!?’

But these were all question marks and he couldn’t tell what they were.

‘Whatever, there are four chances anyway, I’ll just give it a go.’

As Lin Xiu clicked the button in the middle of the lottery wheel, it began to spin quickly.

As they were all ‘?’ this time, Lin Xiu wasn’t very excited.

‘What… is going to happen?’

“Congratulations Master on getting a large number of Odd Crystals!”

As the needle pointed to one of the sections, a system notification sounded in his mind.

‘A large number of Odd Crystals’

When Lin Xiu was still in a daze, he saw a light in the air and suddenly the Odd Crystals fell down.

Lin Xiu was stunned by this scene.

But as soon as he came back to his senses, he turned over and jumped off the android wolf, then looked at the colorful Odd Crystals on the ground.

From the size and color, it was very easy to tell that there were three rank 3, five rank 2, and ten rank 1 Odd Crystals.

“This was indeed a large number of Odd Crystals,” Lin Xiu mumbled to himself and didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

These Odd Crystals could sell for a lot of money, but other than that, there was not much use.

The high-ranking ones were not too bad.

Lin Xiu didn’t think about it anymore and simply put them all in his backpack.

Lin Xiu thought about it and decided to continue the lottery.

In the next second, the lottery wheel continued to spin and the sections were still ‘?’, he had no clue what they were at all.

“Congratulations Master on getting the legendary weapon – ‘Red Moon’!”

‘Gloves?’

Looking at the pair of black gloves in front of him, he was slightly taken aback but quickly took it.

This pair of gloves was an open-fingered glove, it didn’t seem to have any special characteristics, but after picking it up, Lin Xiu felt a cold sensation.

It seemed to be made of a special material, it wasn’t hard yet it felt like it was made with black metal.

‘Soft metal?’

Lin Xiu was shocked.

The concept of ‘soft metal’ differed from the former world. It was a special metal collected from a foreign planet. Although it was malleable and not as hard as steel, it was actually very destructive.

Lin Xiu wore the gloves and realized that the fitting was just right.

He put down the sword and waved his fists in the air a few times. He found that the black gloves seemed to change in color when he was moving.

This surprised Lin Xiu.

Looking at a huge black iron tree in front of him, Lin Xiu suddenly had an idea.

‘Rupturing Fist!’ He walked to the black iron tree and threw a punch. At this moment, Lin Xiu clearly saw that the top of the gloves had turned red.

It was as if his punches had become much stronger.

The black iron tree was a tree whose branches and trunks were black and were as hard as steel. When Lin Xiu threw a punch, his entire fist actually smashed into it.

He actually made a hole!

Also, there was a wisp of white smoke in the vandalized area which seemed to be due to the friction between the fist and the trunk.

“It’s the ‘Red Moon’ indeed.” Lin Xiu was pleasantly surprised.

With the source strength imbued in the movement of this punch, it actually turned scarlet red and its power seemed to have magnified! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

After all, his major was in spear arts and his secondary major was in fist techniques, so it was very beneficial for him.

This was quite a surprise.

Lin Xiu still had two lottery chances and he didn’t want to waste them. It was a rare opportunity to obtain good things now!

As the lottery wheel turned again, the pointer pointed to a ‘?’ section.

“Congratulations Master on getting a large number of skill cards.”
