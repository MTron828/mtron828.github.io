1248 In Changqing City

“Very good, now, you go to Lingxian City and slaughter all the people in that city.”

Liu Mo nodded in satisfaction.

“That city is not weak, so treat it as gaining experience…”

“Report!”

!!

Before Liu Mo finished speaking, there was a hurried voice outside the door.

A warrior rushed in at this moment.

“what happened?”

Looking at the warrior who rushed in, he couldn’t help frowning.

This man was so anxious which made him a little angry.

“Shachang City… Shaqiong, Shachang City, was killed!”

After the warrior walked in, he said, panting.

“what!?”

After hearing the warrior’s words, Liu Mo’s eyes widened, his face full of disbelief.

Sha Qiong was not an ordinary God warrior-level warrior, but a figure with the title of a noble god.

Although his overall strength should be at the bottom among the noble gods, the dark attribute energy he uses is also extremely difficult to deal with.

Besides, there were many powerful fighters in Shachang City, yet Sha Qiong was killed just like that?

“Do you know who did it?”

At this time, Liu Mo said with a gloomy face.

Shachang City and Changqing City had a certain cooperative relationship, so after hearing that Shachang City was destroyed, Liu Mo also wanted to know what happened.

“It’s said…it’s said to be from Lingxian City.”

After hesitating for a while, the warrior gritted his teeth and said.

Hearing the warrior’s words, the pupils in Liu Mo’s eyes shrank slightly.

“This is impossible!”

Liu Mo shook his head and said.

The city lord of Lingxian City can deal with a warrior like his son Liu Qinglan, but it is impossible for Sha Qiong to be killed.

Even if he himself wanted to kill Sha Qiong, it was not an easy task.

“The subordinates have already obtained the information. Through the comparison of the information from the satellite monitoring station, it is indeed the new city owner of Lingxian City…”

The technology in the God warrior Realm is also very advanced. Through satellite monitoring, apart from hiding inside the house, every move outside was monitored and there is almost no way to hide.

Liu Mo’s face turned livid.

If this is the case, the strength of the new city lord will have to be reassessed.

“Liu Cheng, don’t go for now.”

Liu Mo said to Liu Cheng.

Originally, he wanted his other son, Liu Cheng, to slaughter Lingxian City as an experience.

But looking at it this way, the new city lord of Lingxian City must have some kind of hidden power.

If he don’t analyze it carefully first and attacked rashly, it may have bad consequences.

“I’ve already seen the battle video, so there’s nothing to be afraid of.”

It’s just that Liu Cheng still looked calm and composed and didn’t feel any fear at all.

“I have encountered more dangers in the Fury Frost. I will personally take the head of Lingxian city lord back.”

As soon as he finished speaking, he turned around and left.

“City Lord, young master, he…”

Seeing this scene, some of Liu Mo’s subordinates seemed to want to persuade Liu Mo to stop Liu Cheng.

But Liu Mo waved his hand at this time.

“Forget it, since Cheng’er has watched the battle video of the city lord of Lingxian City, it means that he already has a good idea of this person’s strength.”

Liu Mo looked at Liu Cheng’s retreating back and said faintly.

Besides, Liu Cheng was a warrior who came back from Fury Frost. How big of a wave do you think a mere city lord of Lingxian City can really turn up? Only a fool like Sha Qiong capsized in the gutter.

Liu Mo is quite confident in Liu Cheng. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Liu Cheng has already become a God warrior-level warrior and now he has practiced in the Fury Frost for several years and his strength is comparable to his.

Although he doesn’t have the title of a noble god yet, his strength should have reached the level of a noble god.

“That’s right, I think the young master should be able to easily remove the head of the new city lord of Lingxian City.”

At this time, the rest of the warriors also agreed.

“By the way, City Lord, I heard that the City Lord of Lingxian City left Shachang City directly after killing Sha Qiong and did not send anyone to enter Shachang City.”

The warrior who came in to report just now continued to speak.

“Oh? Is that so…”

Liu Mo was taken aback and he never thought that after the lord of Lingxian City killed Sha Qiong, he didn’t take the opportunity to occupy Shachang City?

...

One must know that Shachang City is also considered a big city, it was many times better than Lingxian City.

He didn’t occupy it, but returned to his own Lingxian City?

Liu Mo felt a little confused.

“Send people to garrison Shachang City.”

Liu Mo thought for a while and the corners of his mouth curled up.

“yes!”

As soon as the warrior heard Liu Mo’s words, he knew what Liu Mo wanted to do.

Take over and occupy Shachang City!

Liu Mo was very happy at this time, this Shachang City will be the territory of Changqing City!

The merger of the two cities would double his circle of influence!

At this time, Lin Xiu had no idea what happened here.

...

Relying on Xiaobai, he quickly flew back to Lingxian City.

“Finally back again…”

Lei Tong felt Xiaobai’s claws loosening his body and jumped down immediately.

After stabilizing himself, he patted his chest and said to himself.

What happened in Shachang City was really too dangerous, but being in Lingxian City gave him a sense of security.

“City lord, you’re back?”

Mr. Pang saw Xiaobai fly into the sky above Lingxian City just now and he stood in the courtyard of the City Lord’s Mansion to welcome Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling also jumped off Xiaobai’s back.

“By the way, can those weapons really be taken out?”

Lin Xiu seemed to think of something, then said.

“Nonsense.”

Baili Haoling gave Lin Xiu a blank look, then said to Rollie standing on Lin Xiu’s shoulder: “Rollie, quickly take out your weapon!”

Hearing Baili Haoling’s words, the billowing body jumped to the ground in front and the body became bigger at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Mr. Pang is no stranger to Rollie that can freely change in size.

But the next scene made his eyes widen.

Because from Rollie’s black hole-like mouth, a large number of weapons flew out!

Dangdangdang——

The weapons that flew out and fell on the ground collided with each other, making crisp and clear sounds.

Soon, piles of weapons appeared in the vast courtyard.

Mr. Pang and Lei Tong were dumbfounded at this moment.

“Rollie…you even have this ability…”

Lin Xiu also opened his mouth slightly, full of disbelief.
