Chapter 439: Seen Through

Swish swish swish——

One after another flaming birds were released from the spear tip, all of which were rushing to Yu Muchen.

“Hng!” Yu Muchen snorted, then he waved his halberd.

It seemed that because of the faint blue light above halberd, it could even cut the flames into two halves!

“‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ !!!”

Lin Xiu saw him chopping dozens of flaming birds and directly rushed over. He thrust the long spear and it turned into dozens of spear illusions.

“Get lost!!!”

Lin Xiu’s flaming birds were quite annoying and seeing a large number of spear illusions, Yu Muchen was enraged and roared loudly, unfolding his ‘Sphere’.

And his ‘Sphere’ was different from the general ‘Sphere’ – it had a blue light on it and when the spear stabbed on this ‘Sphere’, a dull sound actually resounded.

There was no way of stabbing the body of Yu Muchen.

Lin Xiu snorted, the ‘Sphere’ around his body still remained the same state and the spear in his hand was giving off an eye-piercing white light.

Hold the Dark Edge spear, he continued to attack wildly!

Bang bang bang——

The long spear attack on Yu Muchen’s ‘Sphere’ and gave off a loud sound.

“‘End'” Yu Muchen looked at Lin Xiu’s crazy attacks and the pupil in the eyes constricted. Then, at the next moment, the halberd in his hands gave off a lot of golden light!

The surrounding air seemed to have emitted bursting sounds.

The platform began to shake.

“Is this a diamond skill!?” Zhang Yin and others were shocked.

Even if they weren’t the ones on the platform, they could still feel the horror of this skill.

“Lin Xiu! Dodge!” Nan Zhengjun stood up and shouted.

Bang——

But just as he called out, Yu Muchen was about to swing the halberd in his hand!

This speed was too fast and Lin Xiu seemed to still be in a daze. The halberd chopped him into half instantly!

“Lin Xiu!!!”

The students from Class 10 of the South campus shouted at the same time and this scene was really horrifying.

Lin Xiu, who had been fighting with strong combat strength, was actually being chopped directly by Yu Muchen in half!

The pupils in Ouyang Hang’s eyes constricted but he recalled something and heaved a sigh of relief, “This chap…”

Swish——

Just when the audience was in shock, a figure appeared behind Yu Muchen.

Although he just chopped Lin Xiu, Yu Muchen felt that something was amiss and he quickly turned around then saw a familiar figure.

Boom——

Before he could react, Lin Xiu attacked with his Dark Edge spear, and that tremendous force still caused Yu Muchen to fly off directly even with ‘Sphere’ unfolded!

Si si——

Yu Muchen’s body was about to fly off the platform but he quickly stepped on the ground firmly and there was the sound of friction.

His feet stepped on the ground firmly, he was so close to leaving the platform.

He actually didn’t fly out!?

Lin Xiu saw this scene and his gaze changed.

He just used the unexpected ‘Mirror Image’ skill, then under the state of ‘Fury’, he burst out in power and wanted to send Yu Muchen flying off the platform.

But he didn’t think that this guy would still be here.

“Wait, what is this?” At this time, a middle-aged man sitting on the leaders’ stand frowned.

This match was quite important and many school leaders had been invited to watch.

One of the middle-aged men looked at Lin Xiu’s back and felt that it was a little familiar.

He was also shocked by Lin Xiu’s ‘Mirror Image’ but very soon, he seemed to have a sudden realization.

“What’s wrong?” The man next to him looked at the middle-aged man and asked curiously.

“Nothing.” The middle-aged man shook his head and looked at Lin Xiu, finding him more and more familiar.

That night, at the electricity supply station, that guy dressed in black was very similar to Lin Xiu!好啊,原来是你小子!”

“So it’s you, kid!”

“Amazing ah.” Yu Muchen looked at Lin Xiu and said.

He did not expect that the speed of Lin Xiu was so fast.

Coupled with the skills used by Lin Xiu, it was too strange.

“Same to you, same to you.” Lin Xiu looked at him and said faintly.

His attack just now didn’t send Yu Muchen flying out and the coming battle wouldn’t be so easy.

“What is your skill?” Yu Muchen looked at Lin Xiu, then asked.

The skill Lin Xiu used was really amazing. He has never seen this skill – it was like a golden shell.

“You don’t have to care.” Lin Xiu said faintly.

“Hahaha, you have character.” Yu Muchen laughed, then the smile on his face quickly faded. In the next moment, the look in his eyes changed and was filled with murderous intent.

“I’m going to be serious now.”

At the next moment, his body moved, it flew out.

Disappeared!?

Lin Xiu’s expression changed.

This time, Lin Xiu came to his senses and felt a huge impact on the ‘Sphere’ and he flew a distance, hitting the ground directly.

Pfff——

The huge impact caused Lin Xiu to spit out a mouthful of blood.

“Goodbye.” And Yu Muchen’s figure appeared at where he got hit, the halberd in his hand swung and slashed onto Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, leaving a hole!

Then, he swung his halberd towards Lin Xiu’s head and cut through it!

However, there was no blood sputtering out.

Another skill!?

The look on Yu Muchen’s face changed. He turned around and saw the entire ground covered by silver rays.

The whole platform was covered by a special pattern that was giving off silver rays!
