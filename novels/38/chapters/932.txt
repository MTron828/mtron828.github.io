Chapter 933: Snatch the Odd Crystals!

Odd crystal!

At this time, his eyes turned to the front and the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes could not help shrinking.

The Beast Saint-level Odd crystal emits light that is so dazzling.

As if a treasure was born!

“The Odd crystal is mine!”

But at this time, the other three Sage warriors behind the Hei Long also rushed over frantically!

At this time, the four Sage warriors all fought.

Under the frenzied battle, a loud noise suddenly erupted.

The Odd crystal can be clearly seen in the cracked head of the evolved beast at this time.

At this moment, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed.

Staring at the four fighting Sage warriors.

What is he going to do?

Hu Ling looked at Lin Xiu over there from a distance, as if feeling that Lin Xiu’s state was a little weird.

“The Odd crystal belongs to me!”

At this time, the Hei Long, which became madder and madder after fighting, roared and waved his hands and immediately released a terrifying skill power.

The three Sage warriors were all taken aback by Hei Long’s sudden outbreak and immediately retreated to dodge.

It’s now!

Seeing this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly, then he rushed straight ahead!

‘Flashing Souls’!

Lin Xiu’s body seemed to disappear in place in an instant as soon as the holy-level body skill was used.

In the next moment, he appeared on the head of that flooded fire dragon!

At this time, he stretched out his hand and grabbed the cracked head of the alien beast and directly grabbed the Odd crystal of the beast saint!

“Who is it!!!”

Seeing this scene, Hei Long roared loudly.

Huan Fulin, Zhao Ran and Bai Long’s eyes widened at this time.

It’s him!

It was the young man just now, he dared to compete with them for the Beast Saint Crystal!

“Courting death!”

This beast saint Odd crystal is so precious that even Huang Fulin did not hesitate to directly release the terrifying skill power and attack Lin Xiu at this time!

boom boom boom —

At the same time, Lin Xiu was attacked by these four Sage warrior-level warriors and the whole ground shook at this time.

“Goodbye.”

But Lin Xiu, who accepted their attacks, didn’t seem to have any injuries!

For Lin Xiu, these skills seemed to be of no use at all.

how can that be!

The eyes of Huangfu Lin and the others were full of disbelief.

What they didn’t know was that Lin Xiu was using the system skill ‘Golden Body Immortality’, which was immune to damage for one second!

Just now, all their seemingly powerful and terrifying skills were blocked by Lin Xiu!

And at this moment, Lin Xiu directly used the ability to teleport with the ring he just acquired!

“Don’t even think about running away!!!”

Hei Long roared angrily and slapped with his palm!

boom–

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared.

“Damn!!!”

When the four of them arrived at the position where Lin Xiu had just been, their faces were extremely ugly.

Warriors at the Sage warrior level have all been tricked by this kid!

“You are dead meat!!!”

Lin Xiu could no longer hear their furious roars.

Because the current Lin Xiu has appeared on the other side.

At this time, he looked at the surroundings, it was a desert.

“It seems that the power of this space teleportation ring is really good.”

Lin Xiu looked around at this time, then said out loud to himself.

The current location is a desert and Lin Xiu doesn’t know where he is.

He looked at the beast saint odd crystal he was holding at that moment.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but hold his breath.

The Odd crystal in his hand seemed to be like a blood-red heart.

Holding this Odd crystal, it seems that he could feel the Odd crystal beating.

It seems that the Odd crystal still has vitality.

“Phew.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, then sat down cross-legged.

Looking at the Odd crystal in his hand, Lin Xiu hesitated for a while and directly stuffed it into his mouth.

Swallow it whole!

Gulp—

After swallowing this Odd crystal, Lin Xiu suddenly felt that his whole body became hot.

It was as if his heart was about to be burned!

Sure enough, it is indeed a Beast Saint-level odd crystal and the energy it contains is really terrifying.

And with the continuous flow of power, Lin Xiu felt that all the meridians in his body seemed to be bursting!

Gritting his teeth, Lin Xiu continued to cultivate.

The process was long and painful.

The flesh, bones and cells on the body are madly absorbing this power.

Every part of the body is slowly changing because it absorbs this huge power.

pfft—

In the next moment, Lin Xiu spat out a mouthful of blood, then fell to the ground directly from sitting cross-legged.

The sequelae of ‘Fury’ hit and now Lin Xiu can’t move his body at all and he can’t maintain the state of cultivation.

The terrifying power contained in that beast saint Odd crystal is still pounding Lin Xiu’s body continuously.

That kind of terrifying pain made Lin Xiu black out and he fainted.

“Is he going to die? Why don’t we just throw him over here...”

“Let’s take a look first.”

“Master...”

Hearing these voices, Lin Xiu slowly opened his eyelids.

What caught his eye was fire.

Bonfire?

Oh right, because of the after-effects of ‘Fury’ and eating the Odd crystal of the Beast Saint level, he completely fainted.

“Huh? He’s not dead?”

At this moment, a man’s voice came over.

Lin Xiu, who slowly opened his eyes, could clearly see a group of warriors sitting beside the fire.

“Boy, I thought you were dead.”

“Give.”

A warrior smiled, then handed a water bag to Lin Xiu.

“thanks.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Lin Xiu woke up at this time. Looking at the water bag that the man handed over, he twisted it open and drank the water inside.

“Little brother, when I saw you lying there, I thought you were dead.”

“Fortunately, our young master showed mercy and said he would rescue you.”

The warrior said with a smile.

Lin Xiu looked to the front and saw a young man.

“thanks.”

Lin Xiu spoke to him.

Although with his own physique, he would be fine if he just laid there.

But these people saved him after all.

“you are welcome.”

The young man smiled and said.

“By the way, my name is Wu Jie, what’s your name?”

Wu Jie said with a smile.

“Lin Xiu.”

“Little Brother Lin, what are you doing here alone in the Black Wind Desert?”

One of the warriors looked at Lin Xiu and said curiously.

The Black Wind Desert is a very dangerous area on the planet Namir.

Most of the people who come here will stay here forever.
