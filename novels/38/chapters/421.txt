Chapter 422: That Place

“Yes, he is indeed rank 7.” Nan Zhengjun nodded and said aloud.

“Should be peak rank 7.”

Speaking of this, he couldn’t help but feel a little emotional.

At such a young age, he reached rank 7. Within one or two years, Yu Muchen’s strength would surpass that of his own.

“How are we going to fight…” At this time, the morale of the people in Class 10 was a little low.

Although Lin Xiu was very strong, he was only a rank 5 warrior and the opponent was a peak rank 7!

This kind of strength was simply beyond their reach.

“Don’t worry, everything will be alright.” Lin Xiu looked very relaxed.

Although that Yu Muchen was a rank 7 warrior, Luo Yue was also a rank 7 warrior!

Plus, it was possible to defeat the people in the North Campus.

“Exactly, Lin Xiu had won the battle with Yu Yi before!” Li Ping clenched his fists at this time and then shouted loudly.

The people in Class 10 began to feel a little more confident when they thought of the previous scene of Lin Xiu and Yu Yi fighting.

“That’s right, Lin Xiu won against Yu Yi, who was peak rank 6!”

“Exactly, Lin Xiu has never lost before, our Class 10 will definitely win!”

At this time, they clenched their fists and started to cheer for Lin Xiu.

Although Nan Zhengjun was happy to see this but still sighed in his heart. The gap between a peak rank 6 and a peak rank 7 was… simply too wide.

“By the way, Teacher Nan, why haven’t we heard of Yu Muchen before?” Zhang Yin seemed to think of something at this time, and then looked at Nan Zhengjun and said aloud.

Hearing Zhang Yin’s words at this time, the eyes of the other students also looked towards the Nan Zhengjun.

They were also very curious. They hadn’t heard of this person before and only heard of him in the past few days.

“He was specially recruited, although he is not quite the same as you guys.” Nan Zhengjun smiled, and then said aloud.

Although Nan Zhengjun didn’t say much, they probably understood. He was about the same age as them but his strength has reached this level. Of course, it was not surprising that he was specially recruited.

“You guys have a good rest tonight, don’t put too much pressure on yourselves.” Just as everyone left the arena, Lin Xiu patted Zhang Yin on the shoulder and said to them.

“We’ll strive to remain on the arena for one more second.” Zhang Yin also said jokingly at this time.

“Haha.” Li Ping and Jiang Li also laughed out loud. At this time, they didn’t have much pressure.

When Luo Yue and Luo Yue returned to the villa, Luo Yue, who had been silent for a long time, suddenly said, “We may lose tomorrow.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu couldn’t help being a little surprised.

Luo Yue, who had always been very confident in herself, actually said this which made Lin Xiu quite curious.

Is Yu Muchen really so powerful?

“We won’t lose.” But Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue, paused for a while, and then said seriously.

Luo Yue was slightly surprised at the firmness in Lin Xiu’s gaze.

Lin Xiu’s eyes were full of confidence.

“By the way, it’s almost time, I’ll go out first.” At this time, the sky was already dark, but because the lights were on in the villa, it looked very bright.

“Where are you going?” Luo Yue was not a nosy person, but at this time she didn’t know why she blurted out.

“Secret.” Lin Xiu, who had originally walked out, stopped, then turned and put his index finger between his lips, revealing a mysterious smile.

After leaving, Lin Xiu continued to walk to the other side.

Soon, in a pavilion on the other side, Lin Xiu saw a familiar figure standing there.

“Hey, you’re here so early?” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but smile when he saw the familiar figure.

“You are really slow.” At this moment, the figure turned to look at Lin Xiu, then snorted coldly, and said a little uncomfortably.

Ouyang Hang.

“I’ve been waiting for you for an hour, you Class 10 people talk so much nonsense.” Ouyang Hang seemed a little unhappy when he remembered the scene of the people in Class 10 speaking badly of him.

“You too.” Lin Xiu smiled.

“Humph!”

“Let’s go, did you find that place?” Lin Xiu didn’t say much at this time and went straight to the point.

“I found it…but what are you going to do there…” Ouyang Hang nodded at this time, then looked at Lin Xiu suspiciously and said aloud.

Ordinary people didn’t go there, but Lin Xiu wanted him to find the place and take him there. What is he going to do?

He didn’t believe that Lin Xiu would look for this place for no reason under such circumstances.

“You don’t need to know, you just need to take me there.” Lin Xiu shrugged and said.

“Don’t drag me down, if something happens, we will all die miserably!” Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu and said seriously.

“What can happen at this place? Don’t overthink.” Lin Xiu curled his lips, then said lightly.

“That would be best!” Ouyang Hang snorted coldly, and then walked to the front, leading Lin Xiu towards the Sacred Region Academy.

The more they walked, the surrounding environment began to darken, and there seemed to be no students in this area.

“This place is really hidden.” Lin Xiu looked at the surrounding. There was really no way to imagine that this place turned out to be an island.

“It took me a lot of time to find it, and I’ll be dead if someone finds out!” Ouyang Hang heard Lin Xiu’s words and said out uncomfortably.

He looked around while walking.

He seemed to be on guard for something.

He has never dared to relax.

“You are from the Ouyang family, what are you afraid of.” Lin Xiu curled his lips and said aloud when he saw him so nervous.

“This is the Sacred Region Academy. For the dean of this academy, our Ouyang family is just a small family.” Ouyang Hang said while leading the way.

They continued to walk a distance ahead, Ouyang Hang seemed to see something and was shocked, then he swiftly pulled Lin Xiu into the bushes next to him.

“Careful!”
