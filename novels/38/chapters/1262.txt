1263 Fierce battle with Liu Mo

Just now, in order to maximize the use of his source strength, after destroying those forts, Lin Xiu no longer unfolded the ‘Sphere’.

At this time, he clearly felt the danger. Lin Xiu had no choice but to continue to unfold the ‘Sphere’.

Bang bang bang——

The blood-red long sword crazily attacked Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ in the next moment, bursting out with loud noises.

!!

“who are you?”

Lin Xiu looked at the middle-aged man holding a blood-red long sword and said coldly.

The strength of this middle-aged man was obviously not comparable to that of ordinary warriors. Under the inspection of the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu found that the strength of this warrior was not only at the level of a god warrior, but also extremely powerful in every aspect.

Almost twice as strong as him!

“You came to my city yet you don’t know who I am?”

Liu Mo laughed when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

Liu Mo!?

Lin Xiu heard Mr. Pang mention Liu Mo’s name, so he quickly realized it.

“Liu Mo, right?”

Lin Xiu looked at the blood-red long sword he continued to slash and directly blocked it with his fist.

The firmness of the glove wrapped by Lin Xiu’s powerful source strength was also very high.

Although this person’s blood-red long sword is extremely sharp, it is impossible to smash his gloves directly.

And if he keeps attacking his ‘Sphere’, then his ‘Sphere’ is very likely to be in danger of bursting.

“I came to your Changqing City to ‘borrow’ hundreds of god-level odd crystals.”

Lin Xiu said while resisting Liu Mo’s attack.

“Rampant!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Liu Mo became even more furious.

Lin Xiu’s words were obviously full of provocation.

Liu Mo was angry and the long sword in his hand seemed to have turned into magma, exuding an extremely scorching temperature.

When the long sword collided with Lin Xiu’s glove, Lin Xiu immediately felt an incomparably burning sensation.

But Lin Xiu was always playing with fire, so the burning sensation was nothing to Lin Xiu.

‘Destroy the Sky’!

While resisting Liu Mo’s attack, Lin Xiu was secretly accumulating source strength.

At the next moment, a punch filled with a lot of source strength was thrown out again!

This punch directly slammed on the long sword he stabbed again and an incomparably loud sound erupted immediately.

Boom——

After all, it was a god-level skill. This terrifying impact, at this moment, directly caused the body of Liu Mo who was holding the sword to be blown away!

“Go away!”

And at this moment, Lin Xiu looked at the warriors who were about to besiege him and let out a roar.

His body moved and the dark attribute energy ball on his neck trembled crazily.

Soon, a large amount of dark matter gushed out from Lin Xiu’s body.

‘Silence’!

With the use of this skill, a large amount of dark matter swept towards the warriors attacking around!

Those warriors were attacking Lin Xiu and there was no way to dodge them.

The ‘Sphere’ they unfolded seemed to have been corroded under the impact of the dark matter.

All the ‘Spheres’ burst.

And in the next moment, those dark substances entangled their bodies and continued to corrode them.

A large number of warriors couldn’t even howl or scream before their bodies turned into bones.

Liu Mo, who was sent flying by Lin Xiu’s punch, felt the pain in his right hand holding the sword.

It’s as if the bones were broken.

The power of Lin Xiu’s punch was too great, it was impossible to take it head-on.

But when he raised his eyes and looked ahead, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

what is this!?

Seeing a large amount of dark matter surge out, a look of shock appeared on his face.

When his subordinates were impacted by those black substances, even the ‘Sphere’ was directly corroded and their bodies couldn’t resist it and turn into white bones!

Liu Mo’s body was shaking.

Not fear, but anger, incomparable anger!

So many of his subordinates were killed in such a short period of time!

Die, he must be killed!

A purple pattern appeared on Liu Mo’s forehead.

...

Boom, boom, boom——

With the appearance of the pattern, the entire sky began to become cloudy at this time.

A large number of thunderbolts and lightning surged continuously in the sky.

“Die!”

Because of the black matter released by Lin Xiu, those warriors no longer dare to approach and they all stayed away.

Following Liu Mo’s roar, the lightning in the sky struck Lin Xiu at this very moment!

It was as if hundreds of lightning bolts of different thicknesses were all coming toward Lin Xiu!

This was the power of his source mark – ‘Crushing Thunderbolt’!!!

After Lin Xiu used ‘Silence’ to kill a large number of warriors around him, he saw the terrifying lightning above the sky

Looking at the lightning, Lin Xiu was not only not afraid, but the corners of his mouth curled up.

“Lightning…”

...

Boom, boom, boom——

In the next moment, a large amount of lightning struck Lin Xiu’s body.

Lin Xiu’s entire body was surrounded by terrifying lightning.

These lightning bolts were really terrifying, it was as if they could destroy the world.

There was no doubt that he will die!

The other warriors in Changqing City looked at this scene and there was a sneer in their hearts.

They were still very confident in Liu Mo’s strength.

“how can that be!?”

But at the next moment, a warrior seemed to see something, his eyes widened and his mouth also opened wide, as if he was incomparably shocked.

Not only him, even Liu Mo’s face changed drastically at this moment.

Because he clearly saw Lin Xiu who was enduring the extremely terrifying lightning and he was unharmed!

That’s right, there was no injury at all!

And Lin Xiu seems to be enjoying the baptism of lightning.

“Refreshing!”

Lin Xiu clenched his hands into fists, letting the lightning strike him, and laughed loudly.

Lin Xiu had already finished those restoration fluids. Originally, his body’s original strength was consumed a lot, but these lightning bolts were absorbed by Lin Xiu and instead replenished his body’s strength!

“Damn…”

At this time, Liu Mo also clearly felt that his lightning power not only did not cause damage to Lin Xiu, but seemed to replenish Lin Xiu’s energy.

This guy must also be a person who cultivates the power of lightning!

Thinking of this, Liu Mo’s face became even uglier.

“Gu gu!”

And at this moment, as some warriors wanted to slaughter Xiaobai, the billowing figure leaped out from the other side.

While flying out, Rollie’s body became enormous.

It’s like a huge balloon suspended in the air.

“Goo!”

After Rollie made another crisp sound, it opened its mouth wide.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m
