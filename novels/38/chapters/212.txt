Chapter 213: Luo Yue’s Background!?

Clank-

Zhuo Qixing drew his sword quickly and clashed with Luo Yue.

“I knew you would do this.” Zhuo Qixing was not surprised by her attack.

“But the rank 8 crystal core is mine!”

He exerted force and unleashed powerful source strength while saying that and forced Luo Yue a few steps back.

Luo yue frowned, she had killed too many evolved beasts and zombies and did not have all her strength to fight.

And Zhuo Qixing was peak rank 5, she had no chance to win if they fought.

“Hand the odd crystal over to me and I will let you go.” Zhuo Qixing also knew it and pointed his sword at Luo Yue as he spoke indifferently.

Due to Luo Yue’s background, he did not want to be hostile towards her.

He glanced over to Lin Xiu at the side, whose skin was flickering between red and white, his eyes filled with jealousy.

‘Why, why would Luo Yue fall for this brat!?’

“Luo Xiaoqi! Take action, the odd crystal must be with that brat!” Zhuo Qixing’s expression became solemn as he swung his sword at Luo Yue while shouting to his teammates.

Zhuo Qixing had presevered his strength and could be said to be in his optimal state!

As he charged forward, he moved like a shadow, making it difficult to capture his movements!

Clank clank clank-

Luo Yue focused on him and swung her sword quickly.

“Quick! Get the crystal!” Luo Xiaoqi and the others charged towards Lin Xiu.

Luo Yue’s expression changed. Her sword skills became even more serious and every strike was aimed at the vital organs.

“Hmph, you can’t go over. We will leave once we get the rank 8 odd crystal!” Although Zhuo Qixing sensed that her attacks had turned serious, she was still weaker and he was a peak rank 5 warrior. Under the circumstances, he was able to hold his own.

Luo Yue did not reply but continued dancing with her sword.

“Young master Zhuo, the odd crystal is gone!” Luo Xiaoqi looked around and aside from the many rank 5 odd crystals in Lin Xiu’s bag and a few other strange objects, he could not find the rank 8 odd crystal.

‘How can it be missing!?’

Zhuo Qixing frowned, according to the signal, the rank 8 odd crystal is here, how can it be missing?

‘Unless…’

Zhuo Qixing’s expression changed when he thought of the possibility. He blocked Luo Yue’s attack and roared, “Did he swallow the rank 8 odd crystal!?”

‘That’s right! That must be it!’

‘It is no wonder his skin is changing between red and white color, if I didn’t guess wrong, he should have some fire attributed energy inside him that is not inferior to the rank 8 odd crystal. He devoured the rank 8 Ice crystal white bird’s odd crystal ice attributed energy for the two to react and produce such an effect!’

‘Damn it!’

“Kill him! The odd crystal is in his body!” Zhuo Qixing’s expression became sinister as he roared.

“You dare!” Luo Yue, who had maintained her silence throughout growled as her pupils constricted. She turned into a white shadow and charged towards them!

Zhuo Qixing did not expect Luo Yue to unleash such a terrifying speed and was unable to react in time.

Luo Xiaoqi and the others had sinister faces in front of Lin Xiu as they raised their weapons towards him.

Cut Lin Xiu’s stomach!

‘I’m too late!’

But right at this moment, Lin Xiu suddenly opened his eyes!

Clank clank clank-

Lin Xiu opened his eyes and picked up his spear to block their attacks.

Awe of the Phoenix!!!

Lin Xiu felt that his body was still alternating between cold and hot. He clenched his teeth and endured it although it was extremely unbearable.

A large number of blazing birds erupted from Lin Xiu’s spear.

They immediately engulfed the area!

“Go!!!” Lin Xiu grabbed onto Luo Yue who had arrived in the nick of time and charged forward as he blasted a hole above him.

Sunlight pierced down into the hole.

The two quickly rushed out!

‘Damn it!!!’

Zhuo Qixing’s eyes had a change in expression when he saw the blazing birds dancing inside the channel. He clenched his jaws and released powerful source strength and deflected the blazing birds.

The temperature of the blazing birds were very high and caused the channel to become extremely hot.

Rumble-

Zhuo Qixing broke through the mud at the surface and rushed out.

He looked around but could no longer find Lin Xiu and Luo Yue’s trace.

“Young Master Zhuo!” Luo Xiaoqi and the others ran over, looking extremely terrible because of Lin Xiu’s blazing birds.

Zhuo Qixing’s mood was bad, he took out the apparatus but found out that it had gone haywired due to the high temperatures and the screen was spoiled.

“Damn it!” Zhuo Qixing was infuriated and threw the apparatus on the ground.

“Young master Zhuo, what do we do now…” Luo Xiaoqi looked at Zhuo Qixing and asked meekly after a while.

Zhuo Qixing’s expression changed but quickly returned to normal.

“Return to the path towards the airship and block them.” Zhuo Qixing replied coldly.

It was the second last day and they had to return.

And they had to pass through the same path to return.

‘Even if Lin Xiu swallowed that rank 8 odd crystal, he can’t absorb it that easily.’

‘I will kill him and retrieve the odd crystal!’

Upon thinking of that, Zhuo Qixing revealed a sneer.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue moved quickly and hid inside a building.

“Whew.”

Lin Xiu was gasping hard.

Although he had closed his eyes inside the water channel, he knew of the situation around him.

“They should not be able to find us here…”

Lin Xiu gasped and said.

But at the next moment, he opened his eyes wide as all the veins in his body seemed to explode.
