Chapter 481: I’m Here To Save My Sister

“That’s not possible…” When the other soldier heard what he said, he was shocked as well.

He lowered his head and took a good look at the patterns on the ground. It does look similar to the legendary source field.

Xiu – –

Then, at that moment, Luo Yue held onto her thin sword and slashed it across the zombies. The last wave of zombies had all been chopped into pieces.

Now, it could be clearly seen that the entire ground was filled with the bodies of the zombies. There were mountains of bodies everywhere and it was giving out a stench.

Liu Xiu’s eyes were locked on the evolved beast that was hammering the spaceship. He lifted Dark Edge and spun it in the air. There were a few figures of flaming birds that were fired from the spear, flying towards the evolved beast!

These were rank 5 evolved beasts and when it noticed the movement around it, it let out a loud roar. Then, it started swinging its arms around, trying to get rid of the flaming birds that were heading in its direction.

But, when the flaming birds touched the bodies of the evolved beasts, it was as if there was oil on their body and a fire had been lit. It immediately caused an explosion.

Koong Loong – –

With a loud explosive noise, all of the evolved beasts were entirely covered by the huge fire.

Within minutes, all of the giant evolved beast had been badly burnt into dark ashes and no one was able to see what it was previously.

“This is crazy…”

All of the students nearby were shocked as their jaws had fallen to the ground.

As Lin Xiu released the flaming birds, the entire area felt much hotter than before.

“Hmm? You got rid of all of them?” Lin Xiu looked around and asked Luo Yue.

Luo Yue nodded her head and joined Lin Xiu with her sword in her arms.

The soldiers got nervous when they saw Luo Yue and Lin Xiu walking towards them.

“El…elders. Greetings.” The soldiers trembled as they greeted both of them respectfully.

Elders?

When hearing what the soldiers said, Lin Xiu was confused. This was because all of the soldiers here looked years older than he is. It felt weird being addressed in this manner.

However, Lin Xiu could understand why they were addressing him this way. Instead of explaining himself, he pointed towards the spaceship and asked, “The spaceship would have been able to fit all of you. Why are these students left outside?”

If it wasn’t because he and Luo Yue arrived on time, Ye Shuanger, as well as the rest of the students would have been dead.

“The…” After hearing Lin Xiu’s question, the soldiers were stunned.

One of them said with a bitter look on his face, “We’re not sure as well. Everything was going well when the door to the spaceship suddenly closed.”

As they thought about it, the soldiers felt angry as well. Due to what happened, they almost lost their life!

“Shuanger, you’re safe now.” Lin Xiu didn’t bother talking with the soldiers and spoke to Ye Shuanger.

“En!” Ye Shuanger let out a breath of relief and stood up.

“Eh…..this pretty sister is….?” Ye Shuanger’s eyes were fixed on the figure behind Lin Xiu instead as she asked out of curiosity.

“A friend of mine, Luo Yue.” Lin Xiu thought about how to introduce Luo Yue before answering her.

“Girlfriend?” Ye Shuanger teased.

“Stop it with the nonsense.” Lin Xiu looked uncomfortable and jokingly glared at Ye Shuanger.

Ye Shuanger gave him a funny face in return.

When Luo Yue saw the interaction between Lin Xiu and Ye Shuanger, it was weird but she had an uncomfortable feeling in her chest.

It made her uncomfortable seeing how close Lin Xiu was with another girl.

But, Luo Yue shook her head. She still couldn’t understand why her heart was feeling a little weird lately.

Was she sick?

Koong Loong –

The door to the spaceship suddenly opened very slowly.

All of the students around stood up and moved aside as they looked at the spaceship’s door that was being pushed open.

“The zombies…..and monsters have all been killed?!” As the door to the spaceship was opened, the students who were in the spaceship looked at the bodies of the zombies with their eyes wide open.

The engine to the spaceship has been completely ruined by the evolved beast and there was a huge crater in it.

The zombies and the evolved beats would have been able to enter the spaceship through the crater. With such a small space in the spaceship, they would have all died.

When the crews on the ship told them that the zombies outside had been killed, they decided to open the door.

“They really got rid of them…” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The crews on the ship came out of the ship and saw it for themselves. They were all completely shocked.

They looked around and found Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

Although they didn’t see it clearly on the ship, it was still obvious that it was the two of them that slaughtered all the zombies and the evolved beasts.

Who are these people?

“Are you…..the people that the federation sent to save us?” Teacher Zhang walked out of the spaceship as well and asked Lin Xiu and Luo Yue who were in front of them.

With his questions, everyone around turned towards them and all of them were staring at both of them.

“No.” Lin Xiu shook his head and gave a brief answer.

“No?” The crowd was stunned. From their perspective, who could they be if they weren’t men that were sent by the federation to save them from the academy?

“I am just here to save my little sister.” Lin Xiu looked at Ye Shuanger and smiled.

After hearing Lin Xiu’s answer, Ye Shuanger blushed and even looked a little proud.

She didn’t think that Lin Xiu would become so powerful. She was really surprised.

But, she was feeling excited as well. Lin Xiu had come all the way here to save her and she felt extremely touched as well.

“Right…. Teacher Zhang, why did you close the doors?!” One of the students gritted his teeth and asked out of anger.

With his courage to take the lead, the rest of the students who were left outside started asking as well.

If it wasn’t because of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue that suddenly appeared, they would have been the zombie’s food!

As they got reminded of it, all of them felt scared.

Even the soldiers looked at the crews and Teacher Zhang with a sense of judgment.

They came here to save them but they decided to run away in fear and even shut the doors to the spaceship!

They may be soldiers who aren’t afraid of dying, they still didn’t want to die in such a manner!

“I…” Teacher Zhang bit onto his lips and took a deep breath before saying, “I’m terribly sorry. It was my fault.”

“It wasn’t Teacher Zhang’s fault. It was Zhao Xia who closed the doors!”
