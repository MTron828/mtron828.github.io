Chapter 408: Fighting Class 5

“But…” Zhang Yin and the others were stunned.

If Luo Yue didn’t join them, how could the four of them win?

“It’s okay, it’s only Class 5.” Lin Xiu said lightly, his tone full of confidence.

With Luo Yue’s current level, she would simply crush all of them.

And Lin Xiu knew Luo Yue’s temperament, she wouldn’t be interested in this kind of battle that didn’t have the slightest challenge.

“I’ll arrange the people for the next match.” Lin Xiu glanced at the people in Class 10 and said aloud.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the people in Class 10 were taken aback and immediately began to become nervous.

After all, they were going against the people from Class 5 who were much stronger than the people from Class 7.

They used Class 7’s carelessness to win just now and it wouldn’t be so easy to win against the people in Class 5.

After all, they were all rank 3 warrior or peak rank 3 warriors. Only Li Ping was slightly faster and had just become a rank 4 warrior.

“It’s okay, just listen to my directions.” Lin Xiu glanced at them, then smiled and said.

Even with Lin Xiu’s reassurance, they were still a bit afraid.

“Zhang Yin.” Lin Xiu glanced at them and said helplessly.

He could see that these people were under a lot of pressure at the thought of fighting against Class 5.

“Yeah.” Zhang Yin wasn’t surprised to hear his name and stood up immediately.

“Can you do it?” He fractured his hand slightly just now and although he has been treated, it would take another day for it to heal completely.

“Yes!” Zhang Yin nodded.

“I’ll go too!” Jiang Li and Li Ping stood up at the same time.

“Me too.” Lei Lei, standing next to Zhang Yin, seemed to have a certain determination at this time.

“Lei Lei…” Zhang Yin heard Leilei’s words and when he was about to say something, Lei Lei shook her head and said, “I can do it.”

Seeing his girlfriend’s determined look, Zhang Yin couldn’t do anything.

“Go and prepare weapons, and battle suits… let’s go!” Lin Xiu nodded, and then said sternly.

“Yes!”

“You guys should continue training first and don’t neglect the training in the gravity room.” While watching Zhang Yin and the others return to their residences to put on their battle suits and equip themselves, Lin Xiu said to the rest of Class 10.

“Yes!”

The people in Class 10 obeyed Lin Xiu. Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, they continued to train on the training ground.

“Call me when you guys are going against Class 1.” Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu, then said faintly.

“Are other classes not challenging?” Lin Xiu said helplessly.

With Luo Yue’s current strength, she would probably only want to go against sophomores and juniors.

“No.” Luo Yue shook her head, and then said, “Class 1 is not challenging enough either.”

“Then you…” Lin Xiu was stunned. Just when he was about to say something, Luo Yue gave Lin Xiu a blank look, and then continued to say: “They’re just an eyesore.”

Pfff——

They’re just an eyesore? Lin Xiu was a little bit dumbfounded when he heard Luo Yue’s words.

But they were definitely going to be up against Class 1 and Lin Xiu was already mourning for them inside.

At this time, Lin Xiu was ready and took his weapon as he walked over to the martial arts field.

There were already many students on the side of the field in the center of the Sacred Region Academy.

There were a lot of students from Class 5, too.

“Zhengjun, your class has to fight our class, you have to be merciful eh.” At this time, on the seat next to him, a middle-aged man touched his beard and said to Nan Zhengjun. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Wu Rin, I think it’s your Class 5 who need to be merciful.” Although Nan Zhengjun was a little upset after hearing his voice, he still said humbly.

“Haha, the match is secondary, our friendship is first!” Wu Rin patted Nan Zhengjun on the shoulder and then said with a smile.

For Wu Rin, this game was definitely a win.

And everyone knew that this was just an opportunity for these classes to learn from each other, so as to let each class understand how big the gap was.

The reward for the first place was definitely given to Class 1.

“Oh? The people from their class are here?” At the same time, Wu Fei also saw Lin Xiu and others walking in from the gate.

At this time, the seats around this huge martial arts field were already full of people. After all, Lin Xiu, who has annoyed a lot of people on the forum, was going to compete with Class 5 today.

As soon as the news came out, many people rushed over.

“Didn’t I ask you guys to go and train.” As soon as Lin Xiu walked over, he saw his classmates, who were also there.

“We’re going to cheer for you! Damn the Class 5!” A student smiled at this time, then clenched his fist and said aloud.

Lin Xiu smiled, and he couldn’t help being surprised when he saw that there were so many students around the huge martial arts field.

How come there are so many people?

“Lin Xiu!” Seeing Lin Xiu’s figure, Nan Zhengjun also got up and walked over there.

“That post – it wasn’t you, was it?”

Nan Zhengjun walked over and then spoke to Lin Xiu.

“Do you think I would be so stupid?” Lin Xiu said helplessly.

And there was no need to do such a lame thing.

“Haha, you kid.” Nan Zhengjun patted Lin Xiu on the shoulder and smiled.

“Teacher Nan.” When Zhang Yin and the others saw the Nan Zhengjun approaching, they greeted him politely.

Nan Zhengjun nodded, and then said to them, “We are playing against Class 5 today. Everyone should be careful. The game is not as important as your safety.”

“Yes!”

“Knock them down directly.” Luo Yue had also walked over, looked at the arena in the middle, and then said faintly.

The middle of this venue was flat just now. At this moment, a huge field has been raised, like an arena.

According to the rules, as long as they were knocked down, they were eliminated.

“Hng, they think they can win Class 5?” In a corner of the martial arts arena, Wan Lin and others looked at Lin Xiu in the distance sullenly.

When they recall how they couldn’t provoke him previously and were blasted out of the door instead, he got so angry that he balled his hands into fists, wishing to beat Lin Xiu to death!

“Members of both parties, please come on stage!”
