Chapter 755: Provocation

None of them bothered talking to the fat man. Lin Xiu closed his eyes and started activating his ‘Cultivation Technique’.

The energy contained in the air on this planet was quite thick.

With the help of the ‘Cultivation Technique’, Lin Xiu quickly absorbed the energy around him as well.

Although it was a slow process, the energy absorbed from the area was slowly healing the different parts of his body.

With the ‘Cultivation Technique’ running, Lin Xiu slowly entered into his system.

He was now at level 51. It wouldn’t be as easy for him to level up.

With the enhancement of the skills in his system, he may only be a master warrior now but if he met with a king warrior, he should be able to fight them right?

Well, this was only Lin Xiu’s guess and up till today, Lin Xiu has not met any king warriors.

He still has no idea what the true power of a king warrior was.

There was only the soul of the king warrior left inside the legacy land.

At the same time, his gene lock can now be unlocked.

But….. Lin Xiu was still hesitant.

This was because the chance of success was only 35%.

The probability of it was too low.

Especially the aftermath of it….it included death, comatose as well as losing his rankings.

It wouldn’t be worth it for him to just die in this manner.

There were two chances left in his lucky draw and for Lin Xiu, this wasn’t enough. He only wanted to do it when he had accumulated enough.

A continuous lucky draw would give him better odds.

After taking a deep breath, Lin Xiu removed all of the unnecessary thoughts in his mind and focused on his cultivation.

After some time, Lin Xiu who was busy cultivating started hearing some disturbing noises.

Lin Xiu frowned and slowly opened his eyes.

Even when he was focused on his cultivation, Lin Xiu would still easily sense everything else that was happening around him.

“There’s light over there.”

“Let’s take a look.”

There were whispering noises coming from a distance.

“There’s someone coming.” When Lin Xiu opened his eyes, he noticed that An Qi and Qian Ling were awake as well.

As for Liu Pan, who was still snoring, he was still fast asleep.

When they took a closer look at the party headed towards them, it was a huge crowd of warriors.

“Hey… there are warriors here as well.”

The group of warriors laughed when they saw Lin Xiu.

There were about 10 warriors amongst them and each of them looked huge and muscular.

Plus, their weapons were covered in blood and the smell of blood still lingered around them.

“Yo….there are beauties here as well.”

When one of the warriors noticed An Qi and Qian Ling, their eyes brightened.

“En…..what’s happening?”

Liu Pan finally woke up from his sleep and the scene that welcomed him was a huge crowd of warriors standing right before him.

“Tsktsk… looks like Fattie was having a good sleep.”

“Hahahahahah!!”

The other warriors started laughing as well.

“We got here first.”

Liu Pan finally came back to his senses as he was awakened from his sleep and said towards the warriors in a cold tone.

Anything could happen while they are here in the open and these warriors did not seem friendly.

“I know but it’s so cold now. We just wanted to rest here for a bit.”

One of the muscular muscles smiled and replied Liu Pan.

As he spoke, he pushed Liu Pan aside and sat down.

“Huuu….it’s so warm here.”

The man laughed as he took his seat.

The rest of the warriors sat next to Qian Ling and An Qi.

Then, one of the warriors reached out trying to touch Qian Ling.

“AHHHHHH!!!!”

As he reached out, Qian Ling immediately pulled out the dagger from her waist and aimed for his palm!

The sharp dagger was then pierced through his palm.

This was why he shouted so loudly.

The sudden scream that happened stunned all of the other warriors.

“B*tch!! You’re dead!”

One of the warriors reached out and wanted to slap Qian Ling.

Right at that moment, there was a sharp spear that appeared in front of his head.

The tip of it was pointed towards his forehead.

It was sharp and the spear felt cold. This caused the man’s body to shiver uncontrollably.

His arm that was raised immediately stopped midair.

This was because he knew that once he moved recklessly, the spear would be pierced through his forehead.

“What are you trying to do?!”

The rest of the warriors turned angry as well.

The warrior who was stabbed had already pulled out the dagger that was in his palm. His companion took out the potion and started healing the man’s wound.

“What are we doing? What do you think you’re doing?!”

Liu Pan stood up in rage and took out his double-bladed axe.

“Looks like you’re asking for a fight?”

The muscular man who was seated near the fire said flatly.

He didn’t even seem nervous.

“Leave or stay here forever.”

Lin Xiu spoke up instead.

After hearing what he said, all of the other warriors had a change of expression as well.

Madness! This man is mad!

Lin Xiu’s words were madness to their ears.

The muscular man who was already seated looked angry as well. He suddenly moved and all of the torches that were at the campfire rose into the air, headed towards Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

Lin Xiu remained motionless on the same spot with his eyes on the torches. That’s when the torches turned around and headed towards the man.

The muscular man was shocked by what happened but he still managed to dodge the torches.

“One last time….leave or stay here forever.”

Lin Xiu said flatly.

“Don’t kill him. We’ll leave.”

Another man spoke up instead.

“Leave now!”

Liu Pan said in a cold tone.

All of them looked pissed but when they saw the look on the muscular man’s face, they had no other choice but to unwillingly leave the place.

“Leave.”

Lin Xiu kept the spear behind his back.

The man that had the spear pointed against his forehead was still shaking uncontrollably.

He felt as if he had already put one foot into hell.

As he tried to walk away, his legs felt weak.

He glared at Lin Xiu and his gang, looking extremely unhappy.

“Looks like quite a large bunch.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Liu Pan said as he watched those people walking away.

“Be careful. They might return.”

Liu Xiu said to them as he stared at the group of people.

Qian Ling and An Qi nodded their heads in agreement.

There were too many evil hearted people out there.

Even if they tried to sleep, they still wouldn’t be able to sleep soundly as they might face trouble at any time.

Xiu – –

Right at that moment where the people were still in view, there was a crackling sound that headed towards them.
