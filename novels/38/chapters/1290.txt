“Damn it…”

Baili Haoling, on the other side, was in a tough fight.

Her body was covered with blood and her clothes were stained red.

His injuries look horrifying.

At the same time, there were another group of warriors that were coming at her!

Boom boom boom – –

Just as they were about to hit Baili Haoling with their weapons, there was a cold light that flashed before their eyes.

All of their weapons then fell onto the ground!

All of the warriors who were attacked, were struggling to move back subconsciously.

They stared at their hands and held onto it because there was blood spilling out of it.

“Hmph! Who told you to save me?!”

Baili Haoling still arrogantly glared at Lin Xiu.

She was still being stubborn with her words but she had already thrown her daggers on the ground in order to prevent her body from falling to the ground.

It was obvious that Baili Haoling had suffered several injuries.

If she continued fighting, she may end up with worse injuries.

“Since you can’t defeat them, I’ll do it for you.”

Lin Xiu chuckled softly.

Baili Haoling was now covered in blood but Lin Xiu knew that they weren’t serious. With her strong healing powers, she would be fine soon.

“Half of them are mine!”

Baili Haoling quickly spoke up.

These warrior gods may not be the strongest but they weren’t weak as well. With so many of them attacking Baili Haoling at the same time, she would not be able to fight them.

Seeing how Lin Xiu had already defeated all of them, Baili Haoling was still thankful for it.

The first time that she met Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu was still a rookie. She even had to show him how to fight but within years, Lin Xiu had already grown to such a level.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

This money was useless for Lin Xiu but now, he needed it more than anything.

He needed money to buy those ingredients to reform Dark Edge and it would be impossible for him to find it alone.

It may even be possible that he couldn’t even buy some of them with money.

Energy stones were like currencies used in this country.

“You brat! Don’t you dare be too arrogant!!”

The warriors who got attacked by Lin Xiu while trying to fight Baili Haoling gritted their teeth as they rolled on the ground.

They were aware of how they had injured Baili Haoling but Lin Xiu got in the way! They were not furious.

As they stared at each other, they could see the other warriors who fought with Lin Xiu earlier and their bodies started trembling.

These warriors that they knew had lost their arms and they were wailing in pain.

“One hundred millions.”

Lin Xiu spoke calmly.

The blood that was found on the tip of his sphere slowly flowed down the handle.

“In your dreams…..”

One of the warriors spoke without using much of his brain.

Boom – –

That’s when Lin Xiu raised his sphere and swung it in the air.

A cold light flashed across his eyes.

“Ahhhhhhh!!!!!!”

His arm had been completely chopped off as he spat out a mouthful of blood.

The warrior, who was next to him, would even feel the warm blood that landed on his face.

All of them widened their eyes in shock as they couldn’t believe what was happening.

It only took one swing! One swing was enough to chop off the arms of these warriors and they didn’t even have enough time to react.

How powerful would he have to be to be able to do this?

“You…”

One of the warriors paused mid-sentence.

“On your knees!”

Lin Xiu glanced at the warriors around him and was enraged.

Boom boom boom – –

As Lin Xiu roared in rage, the warrior gods could feel a large surge of energy headed their way.

...

They were all forced on their knees!

This was fear that they felt towards Lin Xiu as well as the pressuring feeling that came from the surge of energy. None of them could fight against it.

“A hundred million each. One penny less would cost you an arm.”

Lin Xiu swept a glance around them before saying it in a calm tone.

These warriors knew that Lin Xiu wasn’t joking and they didn’t want to lose an arm. Most of them were forced to comply.

Initially, Lin Xiu thought that these warriors were from different cities but he soon found out that most of them were locals.

Only Sun Tian and Yuan Daliang from before were from other cities.

“Tsktsk….a total of thirteen hundred million.”

When Lin Xiu checked his account, he was dlighted.

Most of the warriors have already left. Some of them who weren’t badly injured were helping the others get to the hospital to get their arms fixed. They were broken when they had to further transfer a hundred million each to Lin Xiu.

“Three hundred million.”

...

Baili Haoling reached out her arms to Lin Xiu.

“Alright, alright. Here you go.”

Lin Xiu then magnanimously transferred three hundred million to her.

Baili Haoling looked at the notification that popped out from her watch and a smile appeared on her face.

She managed to earn three hundred million in such a small period of time! What joy!

Lei Chong on the other hand was completely speechless.

1.3 trillion?!

These two managed to earn 1.3 trillion in such a short period of time?

These two were crazy!

Lin Xiu and the rest of them were still in the training room.

However, after what happened, none of the warriors around dared to provoke Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling.

These people were ruthless!

“Boring. It’s so boring!!!”

Baili Haoling looked around to see if there was anyone else who wanted to challenge her.

However, when they saw Baili Haoling looking at them, all of them reacted as if they had seen a ghost and quickly turned around.

Baili Haoling felt speechless.

She wanted to continue fighting to get more money…

“Let’s start with the cultivation.”

Lin Xiu found it funny instead.

He shook his head and then sat cross-legged on the ground.

Time passed by quickly.

Lin Xiu continued training through the night.

With Lin Xiu’s abilities, even if he didn’t sleep for days, there would be no major issues.

There were also other warriors who were cultivating as well.

“Hu….”

At the break of dawn, Lin Xiu finally opened his eyes and let out a huge breath.

It was comforting.

This was indeed the God City where the energy around the air was rich.

It was indeed comforting for Lin Xiu. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com
