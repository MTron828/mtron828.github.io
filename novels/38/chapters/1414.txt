1415 God King, An Tiancheng

The whole sky seemed to vibrate at this moment.

What’s happening!?

Looking forward, he could clearly see a large number of warriors rushing from all directions.

These warriors were all riding huge mounts.

“People from the Royal Beast sect…”

Seeing this scene, the expression in his eyes couldn’t help but change slightly.

“I can deal with you sirs.”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

These people, obviously, came to seek revenge.

But Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen were still standing there, not moving at all.

“Count us in.”

Xiao Qingchen also clenched the saber in her hand, showing a smile.

Yuan Zhen has also entered a fighting state.

“It’s you guys who want to kill me, right?”

At the same time, a man’s figure suddenly appeared in the middle.

He was riding a huge Scarlet flame beast, and he looked extraordinary.

“The master of the Royal Beast sect, the God King, An Tiancheng!”

Some warrior gods were shocked when they saw this scene.

The head of the Royal Beast Sect actually came in person.

Mr. Sima, who was above the sky of God warrior City, frowned slightly when he saw this scene.

But he didn’t try to stop it. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Now it is outside the God warrior City, not inside the God warrior City.

“Tsk tsk, the son of a bitch, and his father came?”

Lin Xiu looked at this scene with his eyes at this moment and suddenly sneered.

Holding the Dark edge spear in his hand, he felt his whole body was full of strength.

“Courting death!!!”

An Tiancheng has been a god king for so long, nobody had ever said that to him.

At this moment, his complexion became extremely nasty.

With a wave of his right hand in the air, a terrifying giant palm phantom rushed towards Lin Xiu!

At the moment when the giant palm was about to hit his body, Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ unfolded instantly!

Boom

The terrifying impact only made Lin Xiu’s body move back a little.

“This is the power of the God King? It’s too weak.”

Lin Xiu wiped a trace of blood from his lips and said lightly.

Whoosh

In the next moment, with Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the surrounding sky was instantly covered by the energy of ‘Heavenly Array’ and ‘Purification Domain’!

“Luo Yue, I’ll leave the rest to you.”

While Lin Xiu said aloud, he held the Dark edge spear in his hand and rushed towards An Tiancheng first!

“Courting death!”

He is a majestic figure at the level of a god king. Not only is Lin Xiu not afraid, but he is the first to attack him.

It was an insult to him!

The Scarlet Flame Beast he was sitting on stepped up in the air at this moment, and rushed towards Lin Xiu who was charging over!

Whoosh

A huge flaming saber appeared directly in his hand.

when–

In the next moment, the weapons of the two collided with each other, and an incomparably loud sound erupted.

Roar–

At this moment, the Scarlet Flame Beast that An Tian rode on spit out terrifying flames, and directly hit Lin Xiu’s body in front of him.

Boom

As soon as the flame hit An Tiancheng’s body, it seemed to explode.

Lin Xiu instantly turned into a man covered in flames.

But Lin Xiu didn’t show any signs of pain at all.

It seemed that the flames didn’t affect him at all.

The Dark edge spear in his hand continued to attack him!

...

Whoosh whoosh

‘Profound IntentTorrential storm of rose flowers’!

Following the crazy attacks of the spear, An Tiancheng’s face changed slightly, and he quickly blocked it with his saber.

Originally, he was not afraid of Lin Xiu’s attack.

Because he felt that with Lin Xiu’s strength, even if he hit his body, it wouldn’t have much impact on him.

But now when facing him, he realizes that the weapon Lin Xiu is holding seems to be very sharp!

It made him instinctively feel the danger.

What… what kind of weapon is this!?

“An artifact! What you are holding is an artifact!”

The next moment, An Tiancheng was shocked after being scratched by the spear on his arm without paying attention.

He has now determined that what Lin Xiu is holding must be a divine weapon.

...

Otherwise, it would be impossible to scratch his body.

At this moment, Lin Xiu directly used the ‘Fury’ skill!

With the use of ‘Fury’, Lin Xiu’s power has rapidly increased again!

Boom

The spear swung over, and the god king An Tiancheng was caught off guard, and directly blasted him away!

“Master!”

Seeing this scene, a large number of people from the Royal Beast sect roared loudly.

They really couldn’t believe that their sect master, a figure at the level of a god king, was actually repelled by Lin Xiu!

At this time, a large number of people from the Beast Sect rode those evolved beasts and attacked Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu saw this scene, and with a thought, a lot of faint blue flames suddenly appeared on the barrel of the Dark edge spear!

Hm!?

As Lin Xiu released the flames, he also clearly felt that the power to be consumed was relatively less.

Before using the power of netherworld flame, it was obvious that it consumed a lot of energy.

But now, the source strength consumed was very little.

Lin Xiu held the Dark edge spear in his hand, waved it in the air, and immediately transformed into giant blue flaming bird, charging towards those warriors!

“ah!!!”

As the faint blue flame hit their bodies, they were directly burned by their bodies and souls.

A sound of wailing and screaming came over the next moment.

A large number of God warrior-level warriors were all burnt to the point of falling straight down.

“Netherworld flame!”

“This is the Netherworld flame!!!”

At this moment, some warriors who had more knowledge realized that those were Netherworld flames, their complexions changed drastically, and they roared loudly.

The God warriors who wanted to besiege Lin Xiu at the Beast Sect retreated a bit.

And Luo Yue, holding the thin-winged long sword in her hand, attacked the surrounding warriors!

One by one, the warriors quickly died under Luo Yue’s sword.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen were also frantically killing these members of the Royal Beast Sect.

All of them used the Divine Soul power and they were black-level!

“Black-level divine soul, when did it become so worthless…”

Looking at Luo Yue, Xiao Qingchen, and the black-level divine soul released by Yuan Zhen, the eyes of some warriors who were watching not far away was full of shock.

“He… his divine soul is also at the black level!”

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s soul, the little black dragon, was also released!

Many of the god warriors from the Royal Beast Sect possess soul power, and this little black dragon, while Lin Xiu was attacking these warriors, flew over directly, biting their soul power directly!
