Chapter 109: Black Locust

This was a vast and boundless location and the only thing one could see was the blackish-blue hues.

Even the sky seemed to look blackish-blue.

The originally dead and quiet place became more lively as the train stopped and more figures stepped out.

“Another group of people delivering themselves to death.” At the front of Path of Death was an isolated black iron hut with an old man standing next to it. He had an ancient appearance with dark brown skin and smoked a pipe while mumbling to himself.

“Old man, let me ask you, what evolved beasts are there around the Path of Death?” A group of ferocious-looking men walked on the blackish-blue soil and headed towards him and asked. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Evolved beasts? There are too many types, we can never go through all of them.” The old man shook his head and replied.

The group of men frowned and took his pipe to throw it on the ground.

“I’m asking you a question, don’t keep me in suspense!”

“They are done for.” Tian Zhi looked at the men and said sympathetically.

Lin Xiu became curious when he heard Tian Zhi’s words. He looked at the old man and activated Analytic Eye to see his stats.

Rank 4 warrior?!

The old and frail-looking man was actually a rank 4 warrior!

Lin Xiu was surprised. The old man was a rank 4 warrior, so the villagers from the small town must definitely be strong as well.

It was no wonder that they could stay in such a place.

“Brat, don’t bully an old man.” The old man said while squatting down with the intent of picking up his pipe.

One of the ferocious-looking men revealed a sinister smile and used his leg in an attempt to trample on the old man’s hand. Right at this time, the old man’s eyes revealed a light that witnessed the man’s actions. Lin Xiu appeared right before them and used his leg to kick onto the man’s calves and pushed him away.

“Respecting the old and cherishing the young is a good tradition and virtue to uphold.” Lin Xiu smiled and said.

The old man looked at Lin Xiu with bright eyes but quickly reverted to his original self as he picked up his pipe and stood up.

“Brat, what are you trying to meddle with?” The man looked at Lin Xiu unkindly while his companions moved closer.

But they did not dare do anything as they saw how Lin Xiu killed a gigantic mutated hound. His strength could not be overlooked.

“You guys can either walk away yourselves, or I can send you guys away.” Lin Xiu said with a smile that was as bright as the sun.

But it was extremely unbridled in the eyes of the men.

“Aren’t you guys the ones meddling and causing trouble here?” Tian Zhi walked over with his big blade.

The group of men felt that something was amiss. They glared at Lin Xiu before leaving in another direction.

“Grandpa, are you alright?” Lin Xiu asked.

“I’m fine, thank you, child.” The old man continued to smoke his pipe and replied happily.

TIan Zhi shook his head inwardly. Lin Xiu had offended the group for an old man, it was not a sensible act and he felt that Lin Xiu was still too naive.

“Hmm, then we will be heading off first. Bye bye, grandpa.” Lin Xiu smiled, turned, and moved ahead.

One, two, three…

Lin Xiu counted in his heart.

Right then, a voice came out from behind.

“Child, hold up.”

The old man suddenly spoke up.

“What is it?” Lin Xiu acted as though he was curious and turned around.

“After walking down 500 meters that way, take a detour to the other side. There are locusts there.” The old man spoke to Lin Xiu.

“Alright, thank you.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

Tian Zhi had a look of shock, he did not expect that Lin Xiu’s ‘unexpected action’ would earn him such trust.

The locusts inside the Path of Death were not ordinary locusts but mutated locusts with strength of rank 2 and above.

“Lin Xiu, wait for me!” Tian Zhi immediately ran to catch up when he saw Lin Xiu leaving.

They continued ahead and noticed many other warriors that were grouped up.

They walked and looked around cautiously.

After all, robbing and plundering were possible in this place. Killing was also possible.

After walking about 500 meters, Lin Xiu told Tian Zhi, “We are taking the detour.”

Tian Zhi nodded his head, they did not know whether the old man’s advice was true or not, but wasn’t there an old saying that went ‘rather believe it to be true than not’, right?

They arrived at many protruding blackish-blue stone pillars that had blue moss on them, which were extremely strange.

A few warriors saw Lin Xiu taking the detour and sneered, ‘What a fool for not taking the straight path.’

“Quick, I heard that there are many evolved beasts ahead and they are rather high ranks. If we kill more, we can make a killing.”

The few men decided to walk straight ahead.

But not long later, the blackish-blue soil on the ground started to tremble.

“What’s that?” The man who was extremely fierce to the old man was shocked.

In the next second, many black worms sprouted out from the ground!

Buzz buzz buzz-

An extremely numbing sound came out, and all the worms that dug their way out of the ground moved their wings. At their front were two sets of extremely straight and sharp teeth.

The teeth emitted extremely cold light under the sun.

Rank 2 evolved beasts – Black locust!

These were mutated locusts capable of thriving inside the soil, they lived in numbers and had extremely sharp teeth. Any prey that was targeted by them was bound to die!

Buzz buzz buzz-

The locusts flew out and charged straight for the man and covered his entire body.

In a few minutes, he was only left with bones!

“Ah! Help! Help!” The few unbridled men became crazy from the shock and ran back fervently.

“Young people need to learn how to be polite.” The old man that stood by his house took a deep puff and muttered while exhaling.
