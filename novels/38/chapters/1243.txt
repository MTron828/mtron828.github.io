1244 The City Lord Mansion of Shachang City

This punch was a god-level warrior skill. The energy that came with it was incredibly powerful.

Sha Qiong, who had been pierced in the heart by Lin Xiu’s heart, made it impossible for him to gather any energy.

Lin Xiu’s punch instantly landed on his head.

Boom – –

With one loud explosion, there was blood and white matter that splattered everywhere.

Lin Xiu was the one who caused the brain to explode.

Lin Xiu pulled back the spear that was pierced into Sha Qiong’s chest and his body immediately fell onto the ground.

In the end, they finally killed Sha Qiong.

Lin Xiu let out a breath of relief but he immediately felt his head spinning.

The aftermath was here.

This time, it was much worse than the ones that he had experienced before.

He felt dizzy and his entire body was about to fall backwards.

Boom – –

However, Lin Xiu suddenly felt that there was something behind him.

Lin Xiu had someone holding him from behind before he fell.

Rollie?

Lin Xiu assumed that it was Rollie when he felt a warm feeling all over his body.

The fatigue that was present because of using ‘Rage’ was slowly disappearing from his body.

His head was still feeling light a minute ago but now it was completely gone.

It was only that his body felt a little tired.

“Rollie?”

Lin Xiu turned around and it was indeed Rollie who was behind him.

At that moment, Rollie’s body was covered in a faint white glow.

This was another encounter where Rollie was able to heal the effect that the aftermath brought to his body.

“Rollie, what are you really?”

Lin Xiu took a good look at Rollie who was behind him as he muttered to himself.

“Coookooooo!”

Rollie then reverted to its original size quickly.

It was now the size of a fist and it jumped onto Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

Then, it started rubbing itself onto Lin Xiu’s neck.

“It’s so itchy!!!”

Lin Xiu laughed out loud.

The little black dragon also reverted into a dark shadow. It reentered into Lin Xiu’s body and completely disappeared.

Lin Xiu could immediately feel that there was a large amount of energy that was flowing in his body.

“Haoling, are you alright?”

When he came back to his senses, he turned towards Baili Haoling. He realised that Baili Haoling was retrieving her dagger that was stuck inside Sha Qiong’s body.

“It’s fine.”

Baili Haoling shook her head.

Her blood red eyes have returned to normal as well.

Although there was a sharp pain coming from her shoulder, it had already stopped bleeding due to her strong healing abilities.

“The energy that Sha Qiong had was quite peculiar.”

Lin Xiu was not feeling the effect of the aftermath but his body still ached all over.

The energy used by this man was completely different from the others that they’ve met.

His source energy was dark energy as well.

“If I’m not wrong, this man must have visited the Dark Planet.”

Baili Haoling stared at Sha Qiong’s body before answering Lin Xiu.

“The Dark Planet?”

After hearing the name of it, Lin Xiu was a little surprised.

Oh! It was because Luo Yue’ brother had gone to that planet.

Plus, Luo Yue’ father, Luo Zhen, had specifically told him to visit the Dark Planet if Lin Xiu had the chance to.

“En. I heard from my ancestors that the Dark Planet is an odd place. It is filled with powerful warriors and most of them use dark energy which is why that place is known as the Dark Planet.”

Baili Haoling continued explaining it to Lin Xiu.

“I thought it was because the entire planet was pitch black.”

Lin Xi chuckled.

...

Then, he realised he hadn’t checked how much EXP he received.

Lin Xiu subconsciously looked at the progress bar and realised that it was already at 20%!

It had already increased by so much?!

Lin Xiu didn’t think that killing Sha Qiong would bring him so much EXP!

Was it because this man was using dark energy? Or perhaps it’s because he had absorbed a large amount of energy in order to get stronger which was why his death brought so much EXP to Lin Xiu?

If he went to the Dark Planet for a dain EXP…

“Haoling, do you know how to get to the Dark Planet?”

Lin Xiu immediately asked the question that he had in mind.

Baili Haoling was stunned as she didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be interested in that planet.

“I don’t know as well but since this man was able to use that sort of energy, he would have information about it.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“It should be in his mansion in the city.”

...

Baili Haoling thought about it carefully before answering Lin Xiu.

“You’re right. Let’s take a look there!”

Lin Xiu clasped his hands together and was prepared to head for the city lord mansion.

Commonly, the city lord mansion would be in the heart of the city.

Although Shachang City was a huge city, the design of it was almost the same as Lingxian City.

Soon, Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling arrived at the city lord mansion.

The main warriors of this place have already left to join the battle and now all of them were dead.

The ones that remained had already left before Lin Xiu arrived.

This was common sense. Sha Qiong was already dead and they definitely wouldn’t stay here.

Plus, Sha Qiong had absorbed the spirit energy of his own men which could have caused them to lose faith in Sha Qiong.

“These people ran pretty quickly.”

As they walked into the city lord mansion, Baili Haoling couldn’t help but mumble to himself.

There were no signs that there had been others who came to rob this place.

It was obvious that the guards who stayed behind had already learned of Sha Qiong’s death and knew that Lin Xiu would be here soon. This was why all of them left.

Lin Xiu looked around and noticed that there were a lot of things left in the city lord mansion of Shachang City.

There were a lot of advanced technologies and perfectly curated weapons.

These weapons were made of some special material and it was impossible for the Dark Edge to break them.

“Lei Chong, come and pick something that you like.”

Lin Xiu spoke to Lei Chong who was wandering behind him.

Now that his foot had finally touched the ground, he was beaming with happiness.

The battle that happened earlier was terrifying. It was fortunate that Sha Qiong was defeated in the end.

“Alright!”

Lei Chong didn’t bother with rejecting the offer as he already had his eyes on a golden machete.

The machete looked like it was made of some exquisite material.

“There should be a vault here.”

Baili Haoling commented about the place as she looked around.

“En but we just don’t know where.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

This place was huge and as the city lord of Shachang City, Sha Qiong definitely had lots of treasure up his sleeves.

This man wouldn’t have an expansion space like Lin Xiu and all his things would definitely be placed in this mansion.

“Damn….this is heavy…”

Lei Chong picked up the machete and his body started swaying.

Then, it accidentally slipped off his hand and hit the wall in front of him.
