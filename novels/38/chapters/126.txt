Chapter 127: Level 18!

Lin Xiu waved his spear and attacked all the mutants.

Behind him under the illumination, Zhang Yin could sense Lin Xiu’s spear releasing cold light again and again.

Bang bang bang-

In the next moment, all the surrounding mutants’ bodies exploded into pieces.

“Ding!” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Congratulations Master for leveling up, current level at Level 18!”

Level 18 already?!

Lin Xiu rejoiced when he heard the notification and quickly entered his stats:

Host: Lin Xiu

Experience: 0/20000000

Strength: 328

Physique: 107

Speed: 82

Title: Rank 2 Warrior (Not used: Rank 1 Warrior, Rank 3 Warrior)

Overall Combat Strength: 2759

Another 18 points! Should I put them in Strength, or physique…

Lin Xiu did not plan to put it into Speed at the moment as its worth ratio was too low.

Not long before, Lin Xiu discovered that when he added stats into strength, his speed would increase corresponding to the heightened strength.

The reason stemmed from the fact that his legs became stronger and his speed would increase from that. If he added speed, his speed would naturally not increase as much.

After the long dilemma, Lin Xiu added 12 points into strength and increased it to 340. He added the remaining 6 points into Physique.

Lin Xiu immediately felt lighter after the addition of stats and the spear in his hand seemed to become slightly lighter.

I’ve grown stronger again.

“Zhang Yin? Did you guys find the exit?” Lin Xiu looked at the stunned Zhang Yin while carrying up the wooden box and asked.

“Not yet, but we have a new discovery ahead…” Zhang Yin finally replied. He was inwardly shocked at Lin Xiu’s strength as he replied.

New discovery?

Lin Xiu was slightly surprised and followed them ahead.

From his position, he could see countless beams of light in the distance ahead. Jiang Li and Lei Lei immediately waved their hands when they saw them.

Lin Xiu looked ahead and saw all sorts of firearms on the ground ahead!

“Are they old model laser guns?” Lin Xiu saw the neatly arranged laser guns and asked.

Aside from the laser guns, there were many grenades and other bizarre weapons. They had undoubtedly entered an armory.

“If we sell these things outside, they will be worth a lot of money…” Zhang Yin was moved, although they were old model laser guns and the grenades etc were from the past, these unique models represented products of a past era. People that loved to keep such firearms would definitely pay a large sum of money to procure them.

“That is if you are able to get them out.” Lin Xiu added.

“That’s true.” This depressed the group, they had discovered an armory but were unable to take anything out. It was truly saddening to hear that.

“Did you find any other exits?”

“Yes, there seems to be a metal door at that side.” Jiang Li and Lei Lei nodded and pointed towards the right side.

Lin Xiu walked over and saw the gigantic rectangular metal door outline. He knew that they could only escape through this door.

“There aren’t any grooves to put crystals in…” Lin Xiu started to study the door carefully and muttered depressingly.

“I already tried searching but there aren’t any recesses to put anything in, and this door doesn’t seem to have a lock.” Jiang Li was at a loss as well.

“Let me see…” Lin Xiu scanned the door and saw a crack. That’s right, this is definitely a door.

But how do we go in?

Lin Xiu tried to exert strength and the door seemed to move slightly.

Can it be pushed?

Lin Xiu was startled by the discovery. He placed both hands on the gigantic door and exerted strength. The door was pushed slightly again.

“Come and help!” Lin Xiu called out to the others.

The door was not only heavy, but it would also return to its original position if he didn’t continue exerting force.

“Alright!” Zhang Yin and the rest responded and pushed the door together with Lin Xiu.

“ARGH!” Jiang Li’s large muscles tensed and bulged up as all the veins looked as though they were about to burst.

As they pushed together, the door slowly started to open!

A blinding light forced them to squint.

“Quick, get in!” Under Lin Xiu’s command, everyone charged through the door.

Rumble-

When everyone went in, they discovered that the door was sealed shut again.

“Oh? There are newcomers?”

As they charged out, they realized that they had entered a vast space that was surrounded by metal walls. The metal ceiling above had a light that shined down on everything.

Lin Xiu’s group was not alone in this space, as there were more than a dozen warriors at the side.

The entire region had about 100 people altogether!

And all of their auras were very strong. They looked over at Lin Xiu’s group unkindly, obviously with unkind thoughts.

“Zhang Yin?” Right then, a man from one of the groups saw Zhang Yin and was startled. He immediately called out in joy and walked over.

“Qin Li?” Zhang Yin was ecstatic to see this man. The two walked to each other and bumped fists.

“Why’re you here?” Qin Li asked.

“It’s a long story, why are so many warriors here?” Zhang Yin chuckled bitterly and replied.

“Do you see that path? We can’t go through now.” Qin Li pointed ahead. In that direction was a deep abyss and no one could see the end of it. In the center was a path but no one dared to cross.

Lin Xiu turned to look as he heard Qin Li’s explanation, he could see the path that was endless and had many traces of blood. The entire path looked as though it was a bloody path.
