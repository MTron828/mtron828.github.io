Chapter 612: The Main Store of the Warrior Union

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“That’s right. I heard that the Warrior Union Stores in Sky City have the most complete collection of warrior skills cards.” Huang Zhen and Qian Yao had looked it up before and the both of them spoke in excitement as well.

It was obvious that they were still extremely excited to be in Sky City.

“Let’s go. We should take a look there.”

Lin Xiu thought about it before suggesting.

Ouyang Hang did not have any opinion about it. Although with his family’s support, he was able to get his hands on lots of warrior skill cards, it wasn’t at the point where he could get his hands on all those that he wanted. At the Warrior Union Store, he might be able to find a few rare warrior skills cards instead.

“Let’s turn on the GPS so that we can find our way there...” Qian Yao said as he took out his phone.

“Why would you need the phone? I am a walking GPS.”

When Baili Haoli heard Qian Yao using a GPS, she looked at him in disdain.

The Sky City may seem civilised but the roads here were extremely complicated.

But, Baili Haoli seemed to know this city inside and out. With her leading the group, they soon arrived at the main branch of the Warrior Union Store.

“It looks huge.”

Lin Xiu looked at the shop in front of him and his eyes widened in shock as well.

This was because he had always bought the things online from the official website. This was the first time that Lin Xiu had been to a physical store.

The shop looked huge and the interior design of it was exquisite.

At the entrance, there were also a large number of warriors walking in and out of the store.

With his Analytical Eye, Lin Xiu took a good look at the warriors. Most of them were of rank 6, some were rank 7 and there were also a few of them that were rank 8 warriors.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but gasp as he finally saw for himself that only rank 6 warriors were allowed to enter Sky City!

Other than those who were born and raised in Sky City.

Well… obviously there was no one who was born as a rank 6 warrior.

However, as they grow up, those who didn’t reach rank 6 would be kicked out of Sky City. This was the reason why most of the warriors in Sky City were extremely skilled and powerful.

“Come on. Let’s take a look inside.”

Ouyang Hang, who wasn’t interested previously, suddenly developed interest in the shop when he saw the vast amount of warriors passing by the store. His eyes were glowing with excitement.

“Let’s go. There are lots of warrior skill cards inside. You might even find something that you need.” Baili Haoli said as she entered the store.

Lin Xiu took out his phone and noticed that Luo Yue had not replied to his message. After placing his phone back into his pockets, he followed his group into the store.

“You will be representing Sky Academy.”

At the same time, at the Luo household, Luo Yue’s father informed Luo Yue about his decision.

“Reason.”

Luo Yue looked at her father. She had a cold look on her face as usual and there wasn’t much expression seen on her face.

“No reasons. It’s just what I wanted.” Luo Yue’s father shook his head as he spoke to his daughter.

“Also, in order to keep you focused on the fight, your sister will be holding onto your phone for now.” Luo Yue’s father said as he suddenly got reminded of it.

“I will take good care of your phone!”

Luo Yan sat on the other side of the room and was waving Luo Yue’s phone in the air as she told her younger sister.

Luo Yue’s phone was a customised model. There were a lot of details that had to be verified which made it difficult for them to change it. It required a lot of effort to do so.

Luo Yue looked at Luo Yan and there was a sharp look in her eyes.

“Oh my…..don’t look at me like that little sister. I won’t peek at your messages.”

Luo Yue put on an innocent look as she told her sister.

“Oh, by the way, remember the boy that you seem to be close to back in Sacred Region Academy? He’s here already.”

Luo Yan suddenly thought of it and showed a cunning smile on her face as she informed Luo Yue.

“You were doing a background check on me?”

Luo Yue’s pupil shrank as she asked her elder sister.

“I was just trying to look out for my little sister.”

Luo Yan stuck out her tongue mischievously.

“That’s enough, Luo Yan. Don’t interfere with Luo Yue’s matters.” Luo Yue’s father felt helpless as well with both his daughters.

Luo Yu stuck out her tongue again but didn’t say anything else to trigger her little sister..

“Well, you can invite him over but he has to be qualified for it.”

Luo Yue’s father thought about it for a minute before informing Luo Yue about it as he stood up from his seat.

Then, he walked out of the room.

Luo Yue suddenly thought about Lin Xiu and her focus shifted a little.

But soon, there was a determined look in her eyes.

He said that he would be here and he did it.

“Woah….there are so many warrior skills cards here!”

Huang Zhen had always been a calm person but as soon as he walked into the store and saw the huge variety of cards that were displayed, his eyes widened in shock as well.

He was acting like a man from a village who had just seen the city for the very first time, exclaiming and gasping from time to time.

Lin Xiu looked around and noticed that the walls have been filled with a large number of card and most of them were stored inside a glass casing.

There were so many cards in the store and most of them were gold skills onwards.

They were also carefully categorised.

There were also lots of warriors around who were taking a good look at the cards that were on the walls. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Let’s look at those with diamond skills.”

Lin Xiu told them before leaving.

“The diamond skills are here.” Baili Haoli seemed really familiar with the store as she had already led the way before Lin Xiu had the chance to ask the service assistant who was close by.

When they walked into another room, they were welcomed by a bright, glaring light.

“These are all diamond skill cards?”

After taking a good look at the room, they noticed that the bright light was because of the reflection of the sunlight on the cards that were hung on the walls.

They could clearly see that all of the cards here were of diamond skills.

“I’ll take a look at those for sword skills.”

Ouyang Hang got excited as well as he quickly headed to the skills that he wanted.

Since the warrior skills cards have been categorised according to their weapons, Ouyang Hang was able to find those that he wanted.

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao used swords as well which was why they headed in the same direction as Ouyang Hang.

The swords skill cards had the most variety which was why it filled up an entire wall as all of them were openly displayed on the wall.

Huang Zhen and his friends started drooling as soon as he saw the cards.

“It would be difficult to find yours, right?”

Lin Xiu remained on the same spot and asked Baili Haoli who was next to her.

“En. There isn’t much.” Baili Haoli uses the double broadsword.. Amongst the warriors, there weren’t many people who would choose this weapon which was also why there weren’t many warrior skills cards available.
