Chapter 5: First Zombie Kill!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

District A20 was an area situated on the north side of the city.

This location had been contaminated and had a virus strain going on. All the surrounding city districts were filled with zombies and a few mutated beasts.

Although it was dangerous, opportunities co-existed with crises.

Many parts of the mutated beasts were powerful ingredients and a few high-grade weapons were made from these parts.

Additionally, an object was found in every mutated beast’s brains and had been hailed as ‘Odd Crystal’. These objects had crystallized bodies with peculiar energy within that could greatly improve cultivation when a martial artist absorbed it while training.

Since it was their first visit to District A20 for actual combat, Luo Li had to be cautious and brought a team out.

They sat on the latest maglev train early in the morning and arrived at District A20 in less than a few hours.

The train was so fast that Lin Xiu thought he was on a rocket.

They were in a small scale town with gigantic walls around that prevented ordinary mutated beasts and zombies from breaking through immediately, so it was considered safe.

“I’m somewhat anxious.” Yang Tian was equipped in protective clothes and held a blade as he commented.

“What’re you scared of?” Lin Xiu laughed, he was instead very relaxed.

But he was slightly apprehensive inside. After all, it would be his first time killing the so-called zombies and mutated beasts.

“You’re not afraid, but I am.” Yang Tian mumbled to himself. After what happened previously, he no longer understood Lin Xiu anymore. Lin Xiu’s victory over Xu Jun meant that his strength was already at the beginner warrior level.

Could It be that Lin Xiu was faking all along?

But that was impossible, who could possibly endure being called a loser for so long?

“Gather!” Right at this time, Luo Li shouted sternly at the front.

Everyone gathered in perfect rows the instant his voice rang out, making him nod in satisfaction.

“All of you have been training in the academy for a long time. Your strength has reached the level of beginner warriors and you are even equipped with battle blades, handling ordinary zombies and mutated beasts should not be a problem. But only by going through actual combat can you test your own capabilities. And only through actual combat can you strengthen your mentality and temperament.”

“Last year, a few beginner warriors were bitten and killed by rank 1 zombies because they had fear in their hearts.”

Upon hearing this, everyone’s face became solemn. A few of them even had perspiration dripping down their foreheads.

“We will be moving out soon. The 20 of us will be split into 4 teams, feel free to group up.”

“Lin Xiu, come with us!” Yang Tian spoke to Lin Xiu as he looked at the crowd.

Lin Xiu nodded his head, while another two called Zhang Yi and Ye Qiu joined his team.

But they seemed to be unwilling, as though being with Lin Xiu was embarrassing.

Lin Xiu did not bother about them at all.

“I will ask this one last time, have all of you decided to participate? Once you leave these doors, the roads outside will be filled with zombies and mutated beasts. Whether you live or die will depend on yourselves.” Luo Li leaned against the wall right next to the big gates and asked as his eyes swept across the crowd.

“Yes!” Everyone agreed in unison.

Luo Li nodded his head in satisfaction, although he did not know of the result, at least there were no cowards within the group.

“Remember not to venture too far outside, the zombies and mutated beasts outside are very strong.” Luo Li’s expression became serious at this point.

Even as a 3rd rank martial artist, he had difficulties dealing with the higher rank mutated beasts.

The 20 of them were equipped with battle robes and blades supplied by Xin Yao Academy.

Although the battle robes were soft, they were capable of withstanding ordinary attacks. The battle blades were manufactured using special alloys and were extremely sharp as well.

“Go on, and remember to bring the odd crystals back from the mutated beasts. You can exchange them for points back at District A20’s supply shop.”

After Luo Li’s introduction, everyone headed out.

The instant they went out, everyone saw an endless forest ahead.

It seemed as though there were many structures hidden inside as well.

Lin Xiu was slightly shocked at the scene. The old city had been covered by a large forest, and the original form of the city was no longer recognizable.

When they left, the four teams walked in different directions.

“Be careful, don’t be a burden to us.” Zhang Yi walked to Lin Xiu and snorted.

Although Lin Xiu defeated Xu Jun that day, Zhang Yi thought it was nothing. He was far more powerful than Xu Jun and his strength was almost at the level of real warriors!

“What’re you acting for?” Yang Tian spat in disdain.

Lin Xiu looked around. He did not care about Zhang Yi’s ridicule and concentrated his attention on his surroundings.

Although he had relied on power-up strikes to defeat both Ma Qiang and Xu Jun, his actual strength was still very weak.

And all the zombies and mutated beasts were fanatical that would engage in life and death battles upon encountering humans. They would never be merciful.

It could be said that a minor slip in judgment would lead to death!

“Over there!” Just then, a few scarlet dots appeared inside a structure that was covered with vines. Yang Tian’s eyes immediately constricted when he saw that.

Lin Xiu immediately activated his Analytic Eyes.

“Rank 1, Zombie traits: Extremely slow, sharp teeth, carries virus strain. Overall combat strength: 380”

Damn, even a lower rank zombie had higher combat strength than him!

At this moment, Lin Xiu could not help but feel aggrieved. His current overall combat strength was 291. Although it had improved from 250, it was still extremely low compared to others’. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The zombies seemed to have sensed their presence and started to rush towards them.

As expected, the Analytic Eye was not wrong. The zombies moved extremely slowly and as long as one did not get caught, they were easy to deal with.

Zhang Yi, Ye Qiu, and Yang Tian immediately broke out in a cold sweat.

It was their first time seeing real zombies and the zombies had pale and rotten faces. Their opened mouths revealed the sharp teeth and flowing blood.

The three were actually at a loss.

But Lin Xiu was rather excited! Experience!

If he was not wrong, killing a zombie would definitely give him experience.

He held the extremely thin yet sharp battle blade and charged forward. He hacked at the closest zombie and immediately sliced its body into two!

“Ding! Congratulations, Master has successfully killed a rank 1 zombie and obtained 200 experience points!”

“Congratulations Master for increasing your level. Currently at level 2, you have obtained 2 potential points!”
