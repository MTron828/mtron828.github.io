1186 One Strike!

“Give it back!”

Baili Haoling stared at Mr Lui and spoke in a cold tone.

“Hmph!”

Mr Lui sneered. This ring has already been destroyed and no one around had dared to accept the challenge from this young girl.

!!

“Give it to her.”

Although he was unhappy about it, he still returned it to Baili Haoling.

“Yes, Sir.”

The warriors who were standing behind Mr Lui nodded their heads.

Soon, they returned with a cage in their hands.

There was a fluffy thing that was inside the cage and it looked like a huge snowball.

“Rollie?”

Lin Xiu called out to his pet when he saw the beast inside the cage.

As if the beast could recognise Lin Xiu’s voice, there was a pair of black eyes that suddenly appeared on the evolved beast that looked like a snowball.

Boom boom boom – –

Then, it started banging against the cage.

It looked like it was about to break open the cage.

The warriors almost dropped the cage.

“Open it!”

Baili Haoling ran to where Rollie was and told them to open the cage.

The warrior who was holding onto the cage quickly opened it after being warned by Baili Haoling.

As soon as it was opened, Rollie pounded onto Lin Xiu.

“HAHAHAHA….Stop doing that!”

Lin Xiu held onto Rollie who had jumped onto him. He could feel that Rollie was rubbing itself against Lin Xiu’s cheeks and it got Lin Xiu laughing.

“I took care of the both of you for so long but you were never this close with me.”

Baili Haoling glared at both the evolved beasts.

The Ice Crystal White Bird was revolving around Lin Xiu as well as it let out a loud cry.

It looked excited.

“We will allow you to take this away but as for the bird, it escaped from us. If you want to take it with you, you would have to win at least 3 rounds.”

Mr Lui stared at Lin Xiu.

“These are our pets! Your men were the ones who stole it from me with their nasty tricks!!”

After hearing what Mr Lui said, Baili Haoling screamed in rage.

“Well, these are the rules unless you want to violate them.”

“Then, you’ll leave me with no choice.”

Mr Lui ignored what Baili Haoling said and warned them in a cold voice.

“Let’s do it then.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and accepted the challenge.

“Lin Xiu!”

Baili Haoling was stunned and she was trying to stop him.

“It’s alright. The warriors here are too weak.”

Lin Xiu said confidently.

“Too weak?”

Mr Lui let out a cold laugh.

He thought that Lin Xiu was just exaggerating. This was because he could feel that Lin Xiu wasn’t a powerful warrior.

Boom boom – –

Suddenly, there were multiple machines that appeared and started fixing the ring that had been destroyed.

Within minutes, the entire place was repaired.

“Now, we have a new reward. It would be this Ice Crystal White Bird.”

Mr Lui stared at Lin Xiu coldly before jumping into the ring and introduced the next reward to the crowd. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“The odd crystal of this bird is the main ingredient to make the priceless ‘Ice Fluid’. Whoever manages to kill that man, this bird would belong to you!”

After hearing the announcement, all of them turned towards Lin Xiu.

They also noticed the Ice Crystal White Bird that was flying around Lin Xiu and there was a burning desire in their eyes.

The ‘Ice Fluid’ was a special drink. Once they drank it, they would be able to acquire ice elemental energy that was incredibly powerful and they would also have resistance against ice elemental warrior skills.

For the warriors who would be heading to the snowing regions, it would be extremely useful.

Plus, the Ice Crystal White Bird was a rare beast.

“Come on here.”

Mr Lui then left the ring and invited Lin Xiu.

“Be careful.” Baili Haoling knew that it would be impossible to change Lin Xiu’s decision once he had made up his mind. The only thing that she could do was to warn him of the dangers.

“Don’t you believe me?”

Lin Xiu smiled.

Seeing how confident Lin Xiu was, Baili Haoling was stunned but it was followed by a bright smile.

“Hmph! You are my apprentice. How could you be any worse?”

Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders. Then, he got into the ring.

“Those who’re tired of life can step into the ring.”

Lin Xiu looked around at the warriors who were looking at him.

“Nonsense!”

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, one of the warriors who looked stern, jumped onto the stage.

He had two daggers in his hands and his entire body was filled with a murderous aura.

This aura was overpowering. He wouldn’t have it unless he had killed countless people.

“Long Legs Seven. That man is dead.”

When the rest of the warriors saw who it was, all of them stared at Lin Xiu with a pitiful look in their eyes.

It was as if they could see that Lin Xiu would be dying in the arms of this man.

“Come on. Time is essense.”

Lin Xiu was standing upright on the ring. He didn’t even look frightened.

“You’re dead!”

Seeing how calm Lin Xiu was, Long Legs Seven was filled with rage.

Usually, the others would be filled with fear whenever they heard his name but this young brat was still acting so tough.

Xiu – –

With the control of his mind, his body suddenly disappeared.

Then, he appeared right next to Lin Xiu!

Both his daggers were aimed at Lin Xiu’s body and he was about to slice it into pieces!

Then, Lin Xiu’s body disappeared into thin air!

Long Legs Seven missed his target!

Where did he go?!”

Long Legs Seven was shocked as this was something that he had never expected.

“You’re too slow.”

Just when he was still in shock, Lin Xiu’s voice appeared from behind him.

CRACKLING – –

When he turned around, he saw a huge, powerful current that was coming at him.

This was the last scene that he saw as a living man.

Boom – –

It was followed by a loud explosion. Lin Xiu’s fists that were covered with lightning bolts instantly blasted the other man’s head into pieces.

Blood and a sticky white matter splattered everywhere.

Long Legs Seven’s body then fell straight to the ground.

The entire place was filled with pin drop silence.

The rest of the warriors were in shock.

Long Legs Seven…..was a warrior god! How was it that he got killed with merely one punch?!

“This…..that wasn’t real right?”

One of the warriors, whose jaw had hit the ground, rubbed his eyes multiple times before he asked if this was true.

“He….killed Long Legs Seven?!”

One strike! It was only one strike that completely destroyed the well-known Long Legs Seven!

“Damn it!”

Mr Lui was looking incredibly shocked as well. This was not what he had expected!
