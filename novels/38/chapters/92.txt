Chapter 93: “Warning! System Bug Found, Repair In Progress…”

‘What does that mean?’

Lin Xiu was stunned, then thought about what happened just now. It could not be that he killed two rank 4 warriors and it was treated as a bug, right?

“Bug fix successful!”

“The host caused less than 40 percent of the damage to the warriors of higher rank than himself, so only one-tenth of the experience points gained would be awarded for killing the warriors.”

“Damn!!!” Seeing the prompt, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and he cursed.

The system was totally messing with him.

That thought just now was instantly shattered.

“What’s wrong with you?” Baili Haoling looked curiously at Lin Xiu.

*Cough, cough*

“Nothing, let’s keep moving,” Lin Xiu shook his head and scolded the damned system.

Just the next second, another system prompt rang out.

“Given that a bug was found, the host is now rewarded with three lottery chances!”

“You still have a little conscience, huh,” Lin Xiu muttered and couldn’t help but rejoice at this moment.

“Come on, let’s move on and try to get to Black Sea City tomorrow afternoon!” Baili Haoling stretched and said.

“Still running?” Lin Xiu was taken aback and asked.

“Yes!” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Soon, it was the evening. Lin Xiu felt extremely tired and laid on the ground, panting.

“How weak.” Baili Haoling curled his lips up, then cut the rank 2 evolved beast he just killed into smaller pieces and roasted them over the fire at the side.

“You think everyone’s as perverted as you are, huh?” Lin Xiu stared at him and said.

This guy is simply too strong, he didn’t even pant after running for so long.

“Get up, eat your fill and we’ll proceed to the next stage of training!” Baili Haoling ate a mouthful of the barbecued meat and appeared very satisfied.

Lin Xiu was also drooling from the aroma of the barbecued meat. He stood up, picked up a stick with meat on it, and found that it had already been cooked. He couldn’t resist and immediately took a bite.

The meat of an evolved beast was twice as delicious compared to any other pork or beef; it was not only chewy but also very fragrant as if they brought their own seasoning.

“I’ll leave first to settle something, will be back later.” Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu and said plainly.

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu was munching on the barbecued meat and didn’t think much about it.

Baili Haoling glanced at Lin Xiu, then quickly walked over to the front.

Lin Xiu was also a little hungry from all the physical exertion; he barbecued all the remaining meat before rubbing his tummy in satisfaction.

‘Where did that guy go?’

After some time, Lin Xiu noticed that Baili Haoling was still not back and got curious.

As Lin Xiu sweated a lot that day, he felt very sticky and uncomfortable.

‘Forget it, I’ll take a bath first.’

Lin Xiu knew that there was a river nearby.

At this moment, because of the moonlight, he could still see his surroundings clearly even without fire torches.

“So comfortable.” And in the clear river in front, Baili Haoling was soaking comfortably inside, revealing his delicate collarbone.

“Hey, you’re here too.” Lin Xiu walked over there and immediately saw Baili Haoling soaking in the water. At first, he was wondering where Baili Haoling went and didn’t expect that he actually went for a bath.

“You…” Seeing Lin Xiu suddenly appear, Baili Haoling’s eyes widened and he yelled at Lin Xiu, “Go away first!!!”

“What are you so agitated about?” Lin Xiu curled his lips.

He wasn’t a girl, then why was he acting like he would be embarrassed if Lin Xiu saw him?

Wait a minute…

At this moment, Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something and felt a little disgusted. ‘Oh right, this guy is gay, wouldn’t I be walking right into a tiger’s mouth?’

With that thought, Lin Xiu quickly turned around and took a few steps away.

Baili Haoling heaved a sigh of relief, then swung his right arm and the clothes on the shore flew over.

He got up immediately and the water droplets on his body all slipped in an instant as he wore his clothes.

With a little more effort, he tapped the river lightly with the heel of his foot and he flew to the shore.

“You’re going to take a bath?” Baili Haoling asked Lin Xiu in an annoyed tone at this moment.

“Yes…” Lin Xiu was slightly startled and answered.

He came to his senses and saw that Baili Haoling had already worn his clothes. His hair was still a little wet and it was as if a beautiful woman had just come out of the shower.

Pei pei pei!

‘He is a gay guy, a transvestite!’

‘He’s as good looking as a woman!’

“You have to do it quickly, start training after bathing,” Baili Haoling said with a blank face.

“Don’t peep,” Lin Xiu said consciously.

“What did you say?” Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu with a murderous aura and Lin Xiu felt a chill down his spine. Lin Xiu then smiled sweetly. “Nothing.”

After the bath, Lin Xiu felt refreshed. He went back to the place just now and Baili Haoling had added firewood to the fire, so it was burning more vigorously.

“Let’s continue our source strength practice tonight.” Baili Haoling glanced at Lin Xiu, then threw the sword to him.

“Try it and see if you can wrap the weapon completely with source strength now.”

Lin Xiu nodded, then poured out the source strength in his body, spreading it over the sword directly.

He then covered his eyes with some source strength and could clearly see the faint gas-like source strength covering the entire long sword.

It was completely wrapped up, but it didn’t look very uniform.

“How is it?” Lin Xiu asked Baili Haoling at this moment.

“It’s okay,” Baili Haoling said indifferently.

But he was very surprised. This guy actually learned this technique in a day?

“Try covering your entire body with your source strength now.”

‘Cover my body?’

He had always thought that the source strength was used only with skills or to be imbued into weapons, he hadn’t tried covering his body with it.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and because he had the experience of covering the weapon with source strength, it was not difficult to cover his body with source strength.

When the source strength completely covered his body, Lin Xiu’s felt as if he was covered by a thin layer of gas.

“Is this okay?”

Baili Haoling nodded, and in the next second, without warning, he punched Lin Xiu!
