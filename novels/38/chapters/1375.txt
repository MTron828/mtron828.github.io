1376 Misty Forest

What was that?!

Lin Xiu had to close his eyes because of the bright light.

As his eyes finally got adapted to the light, there was a huge, white staircase that appeared before them.

This was the stairs to Tianmen City!

“Are those stairs?!”

Seeing how the stairs had appeared, all of the warriors present were shocked.

“Those in front will be allowed first. The ones that get to the top will enter Tianmen City!”

Mr Shima took a look at the young warriors on the ground.

With that said, those who were closer to the stairs leaped off the ground immediately.

They jumped directly onto the stairs.

As some of them were trying to skip a few steps and hurriedly go up the stairs, they soon noticed that there was a force gripping them onto the ground, it was impossible for them to fly to the top.

They could only take one step at a time!

There were also some who tried to run up the stairs. However, while they were halfway up the stairs, there was an invincible force of energy that threw them off the stairs.

“Those who have fallen will not be allowed up here again.”

Mr Shima made another announcement.

The warriors, who had been thrown off the stairs, wanted to secretly go up the stairs again but Mr Shima managed to catch them and threw them out of Warrior God City immediately.

“This is like the one in the God King’s pavilion.”

Xiao Qingchen was focused on what happened ahead and shared it with Lin Xiu and Yuan Zheng.

Lin Xiu nodded his head. He has been through a lot of stairs like these.

It wasn’t always the best to be in front since you will have no idea what dangers lie ahead of you.

Soon, there were already a large number of them from the first batch that were thrown off the staircase.

There were also a few who got to the top.

That’s when the gates to Tianmen City finally opened.

There was a bright light that came from inside and no one could see what was behind those gates.

However, Lin Xiu guessed that it was a unique space.

“Next!”

Another batch got up the stairs and soon, it was Lin Xiu’s turn.

“Well, it would be embarrassing if any of you fell off the steps.”

Xiao Qingchen chuckled before stepping onto the stairs.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate as well.

As soon as he placed his first step, Lin Xiu walked up at a quick pace.

Lin Xiu was quick and within a short period of time, he was already at the top.

The closer he got to the top, the harder the force. Lin Xiu even felt uncomfortable as he got closer.

It was a strange type of energy as if it was trying to kick him off the stairs.

“Interesting.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes before releasing all of the energy in his body.

Then, he continued walking without any hesitation!

Boom – –

As Lin Xiu got up, there was a continuous loud sound next to his ears.

Lin Xiu ignored them all and continued walking.

“That guy! How could he be so fast?”

Xiao Qingchen had got to the stairs first before Lin Xiu but he was now behind Lin Xiu. He wasn’t happy with that and wanted to move faster.

However, the closer he got to the top, the stronger the energy. Even if his abilities have improved tremendously, it wasn’t possible for him to climb up the stairs so quickly.

Yuan Zheng was right behind Xiao Qingchen.

“Did he….just get stronger?”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was already at the top, he couldn’t help but mumble under his breath.

“We’re here.”

Soon, Lin Xiu arrived at the top and the gates to Tianmen City were right in front of him.

He would be able to enter it with another step forward.

However, he stopped and waited for Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng.

“You’re slow.”

Seeing how they finally got up, Lin Xiu gave a cold comment.

There were already a few warriors who entered Tianmen City.

“Damn it! Where have you been cultivating for the last month?”

...

Xiao Qingchen noticed how Lin Xiu didn’t look exhausted.

“The Netherworld.”

Lin Xiu gave a simple answer and leaped into Tianmen City!

He disappeared instantly.

“Netherworld…”

“Did he really find the Netherworld Flame?!”

When Xiao Qingchen thought of it, the look on his face changed drastically.

No! That would be impossible. The Nertherworld’s flame was terrifying and no ordinary man would be able to absorb them.

Plus, during the fight a few days ago, Lin Xiu did not use the Netherworld Flame.

It may be that Lin Xiu had only cultivated in the Netherworld.

After convincing himself, Xiao Qingchen stepped into Tianmen City.

...

When Lin Xiu got inside, he noticed that he was standing in the middle of a forest.

There were lots of trees around them and most of their branches were blue. They looked weird.

Soon, Xiao Qingchen and Yuanzheng appeared next to him.

“Where are we?”

When Xiao Qingchen first arrived, he looked around carefully and was utterly surprised.

“Aren’t you the encyclopedia?”

Lin Xiu glanced at Xiao Qingchen before speaking.

“I do know a lot of things but I have never entered Tianmen City. Plus, every time they step into this place, it looks different.”

There were many more warriors that appeared in the forest.

Most of them were young but terrifying.

They were all powerful warriors as those who were weak would have been kicked off the stairs.

The place where Lin Xiu stood was now filled with warriors.

He thought that there would be more of them but the stairs soon disappeared. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Hmm?

Lin Xiu looked confused.

There should be more warriors behind him that would be entering Tianmen City but why did they shut the portal?

“There would only be 5 thousand people allowed here in the Misty Forest.”

Just when Lin Xiu was confused, there was a voice that appeared.

“Who was that?”

Some of the warriors who heard the voice started looking around.

However, they could not find the person who was speaking.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Then, the strange voice appeared once again and soon all of them noticed that there was a peculiar light that was headed for their foreheads.

These things were so quick that even Lin Xiu didn’t react in time.

Soon, there was a white rune that appeared on everyone’s foreheads.

“Those who get 5 energy runes will be allowed to leave the Misty Forest.”

With that said, Lin Xiu suddenly felt a hard tug!
