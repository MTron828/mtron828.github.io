Chapter 744: Mutation!

“Are you Luo Yue?”

At the same time, the man in the luxurious clothes walked over to Luo Yue and said to Luo Yue.

But Luo Yue was still drawing source marks on the book and seemed to ignore him.

“I heard that you came from Earth. Why don’t I take you to see this Fengyun City.”

The man continued to speak to Luo Yue at this time, maintaining a faint smile.

But even so, Luo Yue didn’t say a word, as if this person didn’t exist and was still doing her own thing.

“Young Master Huang is talking to you, did you hear him!”

The two men who were also wearing the uniforms of the Xuanfeng Academy, at this time, reached out and patted Luo Yue’s desktop suddenly, then said loudly.

“Get away from me!”

But at this moment, the man they called Young Master Huang immediately kicked the two of them.

The two men smiled awkwardly at this time, then stepped back.

“This is not Earth, there are many powerful people.”

“But I can protect you.”

The man continued to speak to Luo Yue.

While he was talking, he looked at Luo Yue’s perfect profile face and was already feeling very itchy.

It was not that he has never seen a beautiful woman, but it was still very rare to meet a beautiful woman with a special temperament.

Especially a woman from Earth who dared to ignore him, which made him even more eager to conquer.

In the next moment, he didn’t care whether Luo Yue answered him or not, he reached out and touched Luo Yue’s shoulder.

But at this moment, Luo Yue’s figure moved and she immediately avoided.

In the next moment, the sharp pen touched his neck.

“Move again, you’ll die.”

Luo Yue stood up, stared at him with cold eyes and said.

At this time, the rest of the class also looked over here and were full of surprise when they saw this scene.

The hand he wanted to touch Luo Yue’s shoulder was still stagnant in the air at this time and he didn’t seem to react right now.

“You...”

The man’s eyes changed. He didn’t expect Luo Yue’s reaction to be so intense.

“I didn’t want to do anything.”

He said aloud.

Because now he could clearly feel that the pen in Luo Yue’s hand has been covered by source strength.

Moreover, the nib of this pen was sharp. If Luo Yue poked into his neck with force, it would probably be able to pierce his neck directly!

“Get lost.”

Luo Yue said lightly, then put down the pen in her hand and sat quietly on her seat.

Although the man was unwilling at this time, the students in the class were now looking at him.

And it was not a good thing for him to make trouble.

At this time, although his face was very nasty, he still left and walked out the door.

“Damn!”

As soon as he walked out, his face turned hideous, he roared in a low voice and punched the wall.

Now thinking about what happened just now, he felt very ashamed that he was actually frightened by a woman.

But looking at Luo Yue’s expression at the time, he had a feeling that she really dared to kill her.

“Young Master Huang...”

At this time, the two lackeys also came over.

“Humph!”

The man glanced at them, then snorted coldly.

“Young Master Huang, this earth woman, why are you being so polite, find a chance when she leaves the academy...”

One of the men walked up to him and made a gesture to him.

“You mean...” Hearing his words, the face of the man called Young Master became gloomy.

Thinking that Luo Yue dared to ask him to get lost in front of everyone just now, his face became nastier.

At this moment, both hands were clenched into fists.

At the same time, Lin Xiu was still cultivating with his eyes closed in the small box of the train.

“Hu, we should be almost there.”

It didn’t take long for Lin Xiu to open his eyes.

At this time, the train seemed to be moving very fast. Although there were windows in the carriage, he couldn’t see anything at all because the speed of the train was so fast.

Looking at the time, only about three hours have passed.

When he was in the Ice and Snow City before, Lin Xiu also inquired about it. This Marqi planet was very strange. In this month of every year, those evolved beasts on the planet will riot for some reason.

This was also an annual practice, so generally by this time, the people of Marqi Planet would use less means of transportation.

Because when you take a vehicle, it was very likely that you will be attacked by evolved beasts.

But for many high-level warriors, this was indeed the moment of harvest.

They formed a hunting team in groups, hunted those high-level evolved beasts and obtained evolved beast materials and odd crystals.

“This planet is still different from Earth.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu said aloud like he was talking to himself.

But now there shouldn’t be any more accidents, right?

Lin Xiu was already looking forward to arriving at Fengyun City.

Boom— Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Just when Lin Xiu was thinking about it, there was a loud noise from the train, but it didn’t hit something and braked suddenly.

What is happening!?

Because of the strong inertia brought about by the emergency braking, Lin Xiu slammed into the table in the middle.

However, Lin Xiu’s physical fitness was very good, so he didn’t suffer any harm.

But just as Lin Xiu wanted to react to what was going on, the window of his own box shattered!

Dang——

With a crisp sound, the moment the window broke, many white rays of light poured in from the window.

What is going on?!

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide and before he could react, he found that the strips of white light was like something formed from an energy body and instantly bound his body.

And at the moment when Lin Xiu’s body was bound, a strong pulling force was about to pull Lin Xiu out of this window!

Lin Xiu was shocked by this sudden situation, but at this time he reacted quickly and took the Dark Edge spear that was on the side, then raised it and stuck it at the window.

But these lines, which seemed to be formed by the energy body, bound his body tightly and the terrifying pulling force kept coming. Although the Dark Edge spear was used to block the window, the powerful pulling force was stronger.

It was as if Lin Xiu’s waist would be pulled off.

Damn...

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth, there was nothing he could do. The next moment, the Dark Edge spear that was stuck to the window suddenly retracted and the whole person flew out of the window!

Swoosh—

The moment Lin Xiu was pulled and flew out, he looked into the distance and found that those large number of thin lines of energy seemed to be emanating from a long distance!
