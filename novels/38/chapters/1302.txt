1303 Another 100 Million

“Ahhhhhh!!!!!”

Huangfu Tai, who was back in the Holy City, screamed in pain.

A mouthful of fresh blood came spurting out of his mouth.

“I will…..never let you get away with this!!!”

!!

Huangfu Tai rorared.

With the ‘God’s descend’, he was transferring his strength over to Huangfu Gu. He could clearly feel everything that was happening during the fight.

He didn’t think that Huangfu Gu would end up getting killed by Lin Xiu!

The energy that he had transferred over had been engulfed by Lin Xiu.

Huangfu Tai was also severely injured as well.

“Huuuuuuuu– – .” Lin Xiu, who was still on stage, was trying to catch his breath.

He lift his left arm and the Hao Yue Spear, who was on the ground, immediately flew into Lin Xiu’s palms.

As he grabbed onto it, he pierced it onto the ground.

He leaned against the spear in order to prevent himself from falling.

In such a situation, it would be embarrassing if he fell to the ground. He still had to look cool.

“That old man is finally dead.”

Lei Chong couldn’t help but feel overjoyed.

Then, Baili Haoling turned around and looked at the man from before, “Eat it.”

The man was still in shock but when he heard Baili Haoling talking to him, he quickly came back to his senses.

“I…..I was just joking.”

The man smiled brightly and he no longer looked as arrogant as before.

“But….we weren’t joking.”

Lei Chong turned around and spoke in a cold tone.

This man had been rude a while ago and he was sure that Lin Xiu would die from the battle. This made Lei Chong extremely angry.

Seeing how Baili Haoling and Lei Chong were both looking at him with an unfriendly look, the man gulped in fear.

His body moved backwards subconsciously but his back was already against the chair, there was nowhere he could hide.

This man was from God City and he was now merely a saint warrior.

As he was threatened by Lei Chong and Baili Haoling, his face looked incredibly hideous.

“You should have mercy so that we can still be friends in the future…”

The man finally spoke.

Xiu – –

However, just as he opened his mouth, Baili Haoling had already pulled out one of her daggers.

Then, it was placed against the man’s neck.

The sharp tip of the dagger was cold and the man started trembling.

This dagger has killed countless people!

“I really can’t eat these chairs!!”

The man was about to cry.

The chairs here were made of a special type of weapon. Even if he broke all of the teeth here, it would be impossible for him to eat them all.

“No? Then, you shall pay.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Baili Haoling offered a deal.

“I will! I can pay however much you want!”

When he heard that there was another option, the man let out a breath of relief.

Problems that could be fixed by money would no longer be a problem.

“A hundred million.”

The man who finally felt relieved was now in shock once again after hearing what Baili Haoling said.

“A…..a hundred million?!”

Those who were here to watch the match would definitely be loaded.

However, Baili Haoling wanted a hundred million! This was something impossible for him!

“That’s right. A hundred million. One dollar less and I’ll chop off your finger.”

Baili Haoling smiled.

Seeing how terrifying the smile was, he couldn’t help but started trembling.

With the dagger on his neck, it felt as if his head was going to be chopped off once he answered ‘no’.

He looked at the other warriors around him and noticed that all of them were wearing their masks, watching the matches that they wanted.

There will be no one to help him now.

“I’ll do it!!!”

...

The man finally screamed when he felt a piercing pain coming from his neck.

“Number 99, Lingxian City, Lin Xiu! Victory!”

At the same time, Lin Xiu finally heard the announcement of his victory.

The battle earlier had completely used up all the energy that he had and Lin Xiu was feeling incredibly exhausted.

“Sir, the match has already ended and you can head back to your hotel to rest. The finals will be happening in three days.”

With Lin Xiu’s victory, the staff spoke to him in a much better manner than before.

This was because Lin Xiu had 10 victories in a row.

It was incredibly difficult for anyone to do so. If he won the match, this man would immediately become the next god king!

“Alright.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and left the stage.

Lin Xiu felt completely drained.

...

As he controlled it with his mind, the spear disappeared from Lin Xiu’s arms.

Then, he kept it inside his expansion space.

Lin Xiu has been comfortable with the weight of the Hao Yue Spear.

However, with how tired he was now, Lin Xiu felt that it became extremely heavy.

Lin Xiu still felt relieved.

He did not activate ‘Rage’ during the battle and this was something that Lin Xiu was quite happy about.

He was able to still keep some energy to himself and use them during the finals.

This time, he had to win the contest in exchange for some rare materials.

He still wanted his spear back…

Lin Xiu sighed for a bit and slowly walked out of the arena.

“City lord!”

As he left the arena, Lei Chong and Baili Haoling were already waiting for him.

“Let’s go. It’s time to head back.”

Lin Xiu smiled as he spoke to the both of them.

As they went back to the hotel, Lin Xiu noticed that Baili Haoling was looking incredibly happy. “Well, you look quite happy today.”

This is because Baili Haoling still looked a little unhappy with how she wasn’t allowed to compete in the contest.

However, she was now looking happier than before.

“Of course! I just got a hundred million…..”

Just when Baili Haoling was about to say something, she kept her mouth shut and stared at Lin Xiu cautiously.

“A hundred million?”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were widened as he couldn’t believe what he had just heard.

“How did you get a hundred million?”

“Someone gave it to me.”

Baili Haoling didn’t want to tell the truth.

“Lei Chong, what happened?”

Lin Xiu was confused as he looked at Lei Chong.

Lei Chong hesitated for some time before telling the story to Lin Xiu.

“You scammed that man!”

After hearing what had happened, Lin Xiu shook his head helplessly.

However, that man deserved it. How could he say that Lin Xiu would lose?

“He gave it to me willingly.”

Baili Haoling sneered.

“You should still be more careful. If that man could give you a hundred million so easily, he wouldn’t be someone ordinary.”

This place had a lot of hidden secrets along with powerful warriors. If they ended up offending some strong warriors because of this incident, they would definitely be in trouble.
