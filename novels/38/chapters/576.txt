Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu looked at these people with no fear at all.

At this time, the warriors around looked at Lin Xiu. Although their faces did not show any expressions, they seemed to be rejoicing in Lin Xiu’s misfortune.

“Do you know the consequences of killing your classmates in the academy?” The middle-aged man looked at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

“Of course I know, I memorized all the rules of the academy.” Lin Xiu said with a smile.

When Qu Tingting saw that Lin Xiu was still so relaxed, she couldn’t help being stunned.

Why is he so calm?

“But if they want to kill me, I’m just defending myself, it shouldn’t be a problem, right?” Lin Xiu said with a wave.

“Then we’ll have to look at the surveillance video to find out.” The middle-aged man from the elders’ institution said coldly.

As soon as he finished speaking, at this moment, the guards near the Tower of Trials took the surveillance video.

Soon, as they checked the surveillance video, they could clearly see what happened before.

After watching these videos, the middle-aged man frowned.

“Although they attacked you first, it’s too vicious for you to kill like this.” The middle-aged man said coldly to Lin Xiu after watching the surveillance video.

“Then it doesn’t count as a violation, right?” Lin Xiu didn’t back down at all, looked at the middle-aged man and said.

“What if I said you violated the rules.” The middle-aged man looked at Lin Xiu and said with a cold snort.

As soon as he finished speaking, several other members of the Elders Execution Institution stepped forward.

The people looked at Lin Xiu with a gloomy look in their eyes.

Lin Xiu could clearly feel the terrifying aura coming from these people.

These warriors were very likely rank 8!

“Why, the leader of the Elders Execution Institution wants to kill me, a freshman?” Lin Xiu said, spreading his hands.

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t seem to have the slightest fear.

The middle-aged man stared at Lin Xiu, then suddenly burst out laughing.

“Ahahahah!!!”

After he laughed for a while, his face suddenly became extremely serious. He stared at Lin Xiu and said, “You are really not afraid.”

“I believe in the rules of the academy.” Lin Xiu said.

“Take my three blows, if you can block them, I’ll handle this matter for you.” The middle-aged man glanced at Lin Xiu, then raised three fingers and said.

Judging from the video just now, Lin Xiu’s strength was indeed not comparable to Murong and the others.

Moreover, he had never seen the skills used by Lin Xiu, which made him very surprised.

At this time, he also became a little interested in Lin Xiu.

“Really?” Lin Xiu raised his brows and said subconsciously.

Although Lin Xiu seemed to be fearless just now, Lin Xiu still sort of violated the rules, because the surveillance video showed that Murong attacked first, but then Lin Xiu directly slaughtered him.

Even if it was self-defense, it was too much.

“Don’t believe me?” The middle-aged man snorted coldly.

“Fine!”

Lin Xiu nodded.

The middle-aged man looked at the people around him. At this time, everyone around him stepped back at the same time.

Qu Tingting bit her lip at this time, hesitated for a while and retreated to the other side with the rest.

“This guy actually dares to fight against the leader of the elders institution...” Some warriors looked at Lin Xiu with pity in their eyes.

The Sacred Region Academy Elders Execution Institution was a very strong force; one move was enough, let alone three.

“Do you want a weapon?” Lin Xiu looked at those people, then said lightly.

“No.” The middle-aged man said lightly.

“Then I don’t need one too.”

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and with a ‘bang’, he stuck the spear on the ground.

At this time, Lin Xiu had already made a defensive posture.

“Very good, I’m coming.” The middle-aged man walked back and forth and in the next moment, with a ‘whoosh’, he instantly disappeared!

Disappeared!?

The expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed drastically and at this time, Lin Xiu still couldn’t feel his existence!

Boom–

Those warriors didn’t even see the middle-aged man, they heard a loud noise and Lin Xiu flew out!

And the middle-aged man was now standing where Lin Xiu was just now.

Lin Xiu, who flew out, rolled a few times on the ground, then slowly stood up.

Pfft—

A mouthful of blood spat out directly from Lin Xiu’s mouth.

Lin Xiu clutched his chest, looked at the middle-aged man, then wiped the blood on his lips and said lightly, “Is this the first move?”

This person’s speed was really too fast and the power of this punch was also very powerful and Lin Xiu felt an extreme sense of danger.

“En?” When the middle-aged man saw this scene, he couldn’t help showing a slightly surprised look.

“Looks like I have to be more serious.”

The middle-aged man looked at Lin Xiu and said lightly.

As he spoke, at this moment, his body seemed to make a ‘clicking’ sound.

What’s this?

Lin Xiu, who was not far away, frowned when he saw this scene.

The state of this middle-aged man now seemed very strange.

Moreover, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the aura on his body seemed to become more powerful.

Taking a closer look, his body that looked a little thin just now seemed to have swelled up and his clothes are stretched out.

The whole body became unusually strong. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Well, I haven’t used this kind of strength for a long time.” The middle-aged man said with a smile, then stretched his neck and suddenly made a cracking sound.

The wrinkles on his skin seemed to have tightened and he seemed to be ten years younger all of a sudden.

“Such... such a strong power...” When the students around saw this scene, their bodies could not help but tremble.

“This is the power that only warriors above rank 8 have...”

Those students, just watching from such a distance, were already trembling.

Too strong!

I’m going to get serious.” His sharp eyes looked at Lin Xiu not far away and said lightly.

“Come on.” Lin Xiu took a deep breath, the source strength in his body was also released!
