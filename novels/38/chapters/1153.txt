1154 The Xiantian Mansion Battle

All the power released by this man was completely blocked by Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was still unscathed.

“You...”

The man’s expression suddenly turned ugly when he saw Lin Xiu resisting his attack so easily.

Just when he continued to attack, the old man sitting in front immediately waved his hand.

At this time, the man reluctantly retreated to the back.

“You are new here.”

The old man looked down at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

His eyes were full of pride.

“You are the pavilion master of Tianlan Pavilion?”

Lin Xiu stared at him, without the slightest fear in his eyes.

“How dare you talk to the pavilion master like that!”

The man just now said coldly.

“shut up.”

The pavilion master of Tianlan Pavilion said lightly at this time.

The man looked at Lin Xiu with a cold expression, his eyes were full of killing intent.

At this time, he didn’t say anything.

“The new city lord, you’re called Lin Xiu, right?”

The old man looked at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

“Do you know where the previous city lords who came to Tianlan Pavilion have gone?”

He stared at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“Some of them disappeared into this world, some of them lived a life worse than death and some of them, just like him, became my lackeys.”

The old man pointed to the man who wanted to attack Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu glanced at him, his eyes filled with disdain.

Unexpectedly, this warrior turned out to be the former city lord.

“Lackey.”

Lin Xiu looked at his eyes full of murderous intent and said lightly.

“you...”

The man’s face became extremely nasty, but at this time, because of the old man’s words, he forcibly held back the thought of wanting to kill Lin Xiu.

“You think about it, choose death, a life worse than death, or be my lackey.”

The old man stared at Lin Xiu and continued to speak.

“Are you... a fool?”

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked at him as if he was looking at an idiot.

“Kneel down!”

The old man’s expression changed at this time, no one dared to speak to him like that!

With his loud shout, a strong sense of oppression rushed towards Lin Xiu!

However, Lin Xiu still stood there unmoved.

It seems that it has no influence on Lin Xiu.

“Just this?”

Lin Xiu was still calm.

“kill him.”

The old man slammed the table at this time.

At this moment, the man just now pulled out the long sword in his hand and attacked Lin Xiu.

He was waiting for this moment!

From the very beginning, he wanted to kill Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu looked at the man who was rushing over and sneered suddenly. With a move of his right hand, the Dark Edge spear instantly appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

Dang–

The Dark Edge spear collided directly with the long sword he stabbed and a crisp sound suddenly erupted.

There was also a spark in the air.

And at this time, Lin Xiu quickly waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand and attacked him in turn.

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

As the long spear in his hand stabbed out again, the long spear suddenly turned into thousands of spear shadows.

At this time, the man’s eyes were full of horror and the long sword in his hand was constantly waving, trying to resist Lin Xiu’s attack.

But the speed at which the spear stabbed was so fast that he couldn’t dodge at all.

boom–

In the next moment, the sword in his hand flew out directly and he also subconsciously unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

The spear quickly attacked the ‘Sphere’ he unfolded, making a dull sound.

The powerful impact made his body fly directly to the back.

He hit the back wall heavily.

If it weren’t for the fact that the building was very sturdy, his body would have been directly broken through the wall and flown out.

But this powerful impact still made him spit out a mouthful of blood.

“what!!!”

At this time, it roared angrily and the veins all over its body protruded.

At this moment, the long sword that fell on the ground flew into his hands again.

Holding the long sword in his hand, he slashed directly at Lin Xiu.

A terrifying crescent-shaped flame slash charged toward Lin Xiu!

boom–

But at this time, Lin Xiu, who was unfolding the “Sphere”, easily resisted.

Moreover, Lin Xiu was still standing in the same place and his body did not move at all.

“Attack together!”

At this time, the rest of the warriors also attacked Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu glanced at these warriors and sneered.

At the same time, the power of the dark energy ball in Lin Xiu’s collar burst out.

Working together with Lin Xiu’s ‘Silence’ skill.

With the use of skills, at this moment, a large amount of black energy material bloomed from Lin Xiu’s body.

Instantly swept towards the surroundings!

At this moment, the Sage warrior-level warriors who rushed over were directly swept away by those black substances.

Their bodies instantly became shriveled at a speed visible to the naked eye.

In a short moment, all of them seemed to be sucked out of flesh and blood, turning into mummified corpses and falling to the ground.

At the same time, the eyes of the God warrior-level warrior just now were full of horror.

Originally holding the long sword in his hand, he wanted to continue to attack Lin Xiu, but at this moment he stopped.

He wanted to dodge the black matter.

Those things were really terrifying. Those Sage warrior-level warriors just now turned into mummified corpses so quickly.

Although he is a warrior of the God warrior level, he could feel that these black energy substances will definitely cause great harm to him.

He wanted to dodge intentionally, but all those black substances came in all directions.

There is no way to dodge!

Damn it!

He roared in his heart and at this moment, the source energy of his whole body bloomed and he had to strengthen his ‘Sphere’ to resist those black substances.

“Humph!” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

The old man on the seat in front of him looked at the black energy substances that were impacting him. At this time, he snorted coldly, and waved his right hand, and the black energy substances that rushed towards him dissipated in an instant.

His strength is obviously much stronger than that of ordinary God warrior-level warriors.

And the God warrior just now, although the “Sphere” unfolded, the black energy substance that wrapped his body slowly penetrated into his “Sphere” at this time!

how can that be!!!

When he noticed this situation, he was immediately horrified.

How could his ‘Sphere’ be so easily penetrated by those black energy substances?

But now, those black substances have penetrated the ‘Sphere’ and surrounded his body!
