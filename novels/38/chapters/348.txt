Chapter 349: Touch Of Tenderness

The after-effects of the forbidden medicine?

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue looked towards the man.

She saw the man’s flesh falling to the ground at a speed that was visible to the naked eye.

“I want you guys… to die!”

“I want you… you guys… dead…”

The man looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue and screamed wildly at this time, but his voice became weaker and weaker.

And at this time, it could be clearly seen that most of the flesh on his face was gone, leaving out the white teeth and the things on his face, which looked very scary.

His body swayed and he wanted to approach Lin Xiu like he wanted to attack him.

But he walked halfway and fell to the ground.

At this time, the flesh on his body had almost disappeared.

Bang——

Lin Xiu saw this scene and swung the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

At this moment, a flaming bird burst out directly from Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear.

It seemed to cut through the air and rushed directly to the front!

Bump–

With a dull sound, this flame hit the man’s body!

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 7 warrior. You’ve gained 30 million experience.”

Hearing the system prompt, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but heaved a sigh of relief. Sure enough, Lin Xiu gave the man the final blow before he died.

But this experience was too little… The man was also a rank 7 warrior but the experience gained from killing this man was far from that of killing the middle-aged man just now.

Was it because most of this guy’s injuries were not caused by him? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Because he found a bug in the system previously and after it was repaired, when the damage he caused to a higher-level warrior was less than 40%, the experience gained when killing the warrior was only one-tenth.

With this thought, Lin Xiu gave a bitter smile.

But there was no other way.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but shook his head.

“Phew.”

At this moment, Luo Yue and Lin Xiu exhaled at the same time then sat down on the ground weakly.

When Luo Yue and Lin Xiu slumped to the ground, both their backs were against one another.

Lin Xiu was taken aback and felt that the atmosphere seemed to somewhat different.

The two people who sat back to back on the ground were in silence.

“Ahem ahem.” Lin Xiu cleared his throat deliberately at this time, then brought up the topic and asked, “By the way, your strength is restored?”

Just now, Luo Yue’s strength seemed to have become much stronger.

Thinking back, Lin Xiu was quite shocked.

If Luo Yue’s strength had recovered, she would be a really strong rank 7 warrior!

With this thought, Lin Xiu had an urge to train immediately.

He wanted to quickly improve his strength and not let himself fall behind.

“Well, I recovered a little bit.” Luo Yue nodded then said aloud.

“Is your wound okay?” Lin Xiu seemed to think of something then continued to speak.

Yesterday, both of them suffered a lot of injuries. Because they unlocked the gene lock, their wounds healed at an incredible speed but Luo Yue’s recovery speed was obviously not so fast. Also, she had just had an intense fight, would the wound open up again now?

Luo Yue shook her head. At this moment, her brows knitted slightly, as if she felt some kind of pain.

Lin Xiu just turned around and noticed her frowning.

He took a closer look and could see that there was a blood-red stain on the slit on her battle suit, near her shoulder.

“Bleeding?” Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu stood up immediately and quickly took his backpack over.

“Gu?” Rollie, who was hiding in his backpack, seemed to be asleep. At this moment, he rolled out of Lin Xiu’s backpack and fell to the ground, then looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue curiously.

“I’ll take care of it for you first.” Lin Xiu took a tube of liquid and said to Luo Yue.

Without waiting for Luo Yue’s reply, Lin Xiu tear the slit in her battle uniform slightly wider.

Luo Yue originally wanted to say something, but after seeing Lin Xiu’s serious appearance, she stopped at this moment.

“I knew your wound would definitely open after you made such a big move.”

Lin Xiu saw that Luo Yue’s wound that had healed before had opened again and there was even blood flowing out. He couldn’t help but felt a little heartache.

Holding the blue liquid in his hand, Lin Xiu slowly poured on the wound on her shoulder.

“It might be a little bit painful, bear with me.” Lin Xiu poured the tube of blue liquid onto her shoulder as he spoke.

These Recovery Liquids were prepared before they went to this place. They have a strong recovery effect, but correspondingly, the pain was also very strong.

The average person may scream in pain or even faint due to the pain caused by washing the wound,

But at this time, Luo Yue remained silent.

Soon, as the blue liquid continued to wash her wound, her bloodstains followed the blue liquid and flowed to the ground.

Slowly, Luo Yue’s white and tender skin was exposed, but there was a scar in the middle.

The recovery effect of this liquid was very strong. As the blood flowing out was washed away, Luo Yue’s wound has now healed and no blood was flowing out.

“Phew.” Lin Xiu wiped the sweat from his forehead at this time, then sat on the ground and said, “Okay, it should be fine.”

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu who seemed to be panting and a hint of gentleness appear in her eyes, then she whispered, “Thank you.”

“What?”

Lin Xiu seemed to hear something then looked at Luo Yue, who was across him, and saw that Luo Yue still had an icy appearance. Lin Xiu shook his head immediatley. Did he just hear it wrong?

After a short rest, the two of them stood up.

“Let’s go back to the academy!” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue who was standing next to him and said aloud.

“En.” Luo Yue nodded.

They carried their backpacks and continued to walk ahead.

As long as they continued walking this path, they would reach the town nearest to the dark forest.

The Unicorn Terror Beast’s horn was still in his backpack. This thing should be able to be exchanged for a lot of good things when he brings it to the town.

Bump–

At this moment, Lin Xiu suddenly heard a loud noise coming from the other side.
