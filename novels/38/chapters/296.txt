Chapter 297: Black-haired Violent Bull

Lin Xiu immediately rushed over when he heard the roars.

He immediately saw a large figure when he arrived.

It was a monster of extreme size with a body full of black hair. It had a pair of majestic horns and resembled a bull.

It was chasing a few warriors fervently and produced loud sounds from its hooves as it trampled the ground.

Lin Xiu frowned at the sight of this.

He immediately activated Analytic Eye without hesitation a series of information came out:

Rank 6 Black-haired Violent Bull, extremely ferocious and strong with a powerful defense.

Analytic Eye only gave a vague description. Lin Xiu continued to observe and eyed the rank 6 Black-haired Violent Bull. Seeing its explosive power, he knew that it was peak rank 6 and almost on par with rank 7 evolved beasts.

The warriors that attacked the Black-haired Violent Bull were flung away upon colliding with it.

Lin Xiu looked around carefully and discovered at least seven surviving warriors that were still attacking the Black-haired Violent Bull with their weapons.

They had considerable strengths and were all rank 6 warriors.

After thinking about it, Lin Xiu prepared himself to take a detour.

But right at this time, a man that collided with the Black-haired Violent Bull was flung towards him!

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted at the sight of this, but he was fast enough to react by catching the guy and placing him on the ground.

Pu-

Upon sitting on the ground, the internal injuries caused by the clash caused him to spit out blood.

“Thank…thank you…” But he quickly reacted and turned to see Lin Xiu. Although he was somewhat surprised, he still thanked him.

Lin Xiu nodded and looked ahead. The Black-haired Violent Bull was infuriated by the fact that Lin Xiu had caught the guy it had flung.

It started to charge at Lin Xiu!

Rumble rumble-

The Black-haired Violent Bull moved extremely quickly and because of its immense size, the ground seemed to tremble as though an earthquake had descended.

It lowered its head and aimed its majestic horns at Lin Xiu with the intent of sending him flying!

Just as it was about to crash into Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu moved and avoided it with ease.

Bang-

It collided with a large tree and sent it flying.

“Who are you!? The warriors that were battling against the bull saw Lin Xiu and immediately questioned him.

Their eyes were filled with caution.

After all, they were in Dark Forest, not any ordinary region!

Any warriors were potential enemies and they became guarded when they saw Lin Xiu.

“Just a passerby.” Lin Xiu replied indifferently.

When Lin Xiu replied to them, the Black-haired Violent Bull charged towards him again!

“Prepare to attack!” The warriors saw the Black-haired Violent Bull going crazy and immediately roared.

Just as they finished their sentence, the Black-haired Violent Bull was right on them!

Their weapons were ineffective against the Black-haired Violent Bull as its skin was extremely tough and strong. They were unable to pierce through the skin of the Black-haired Violent Bull at all.

Bang bang bang-

The Black-haired Violent Bull sent a few warriors flying and charged towards Lin Xiu!

It was extremely angry that Lin Xiu had avoided its attack and wanted to send him flying as well.

Sou-

But Lin Xiu was extremely fast and avoided its attack with ease.

Clang clang clang-

Once he avoided the Black-haired Violent Bull, Lin Xiu used Dark Edge to attack.

The spear tip of Dark Edge struck its body and produced metallic sounds, causing Lin Xiu to frown.

‘The skin is extremely tough and even Dark Edge can’t penetrate through its body.’

The Black-haired Violent Bull was infuriated by Lin Xiu’s attack and moo-ed out loud and turned to attack him again!

It raised its body up high and slammed its head downwards at Lin Xiu!

“He’s going to get killed by the Black-haired Violent Bull!” A warrior subconsciously spoke up when he witnessed the scene.

Lin Xiu looked up at the head that was coming down at him!

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu did not panic and snorted coldly as he drew an arc with Dark Edge!

Rumble- UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

As Lin Xiu drew the arc, flames appeared in the sky and transformed into a gigantic blazing bird. It soared into the air and attacked the Black-haired Violent Bull that was coming down at him!

‘What is that!?’

All the warriors had a change in expression when they saw the gigantic blazing bird appear suddenly.

They could feel the blazing temperature emitting from the bird as the ground turned red.

Bang-

In the next moment, the fiery bird collided into the Black-haired Violent Bull!

The flames immediately enveloped the Black-haired Violent Bull and turned it into a ball of flames.

Rumble-

The originally high and mighty Black-haired Violent Bull that wanted to attack Lin Xiu fell heavily to the ground!

The ground trembled under its immense weight.
