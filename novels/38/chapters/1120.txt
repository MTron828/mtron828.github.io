Chapter 1121: Divine Domain Lord

At this moment, Huangfu Tai suddenly let out a scream.

Although his power was transmitted from the God realm to the Sage warrior’s body, it was not his body.

But while controlling this body now, Huangfu Tai also has to endure the pain this body suffers.

This intense pain made him roar frantically.

!!

Soon, his chest was burned by the dark blue flames until a huge hole appeared.

“Die!!!”

Huangfu Gu appeared from behind and the long sword that was condensed from the source in his hand frantically attacked Lin Xiu’s body.

He and Lin Xiu had a deep hatred.

Lin Xiu absorbed his divine power twice, causing his strength to drop a lot.

bang bang bang-

Following his attack, Lin Xiu’s armor also suffered a lot of damage.

Soon, Huangfu Gu could clearly see that Lin Xiu turned out to be a… skeleton!

A golden skeleton!

Even for Shi Huangfu who has seen the world, he was still shocked when he saw this scene.

At this time, Lin Xiu took out the Dark Edge spear from Huangfu Tai’s body and attacked Huangfu Gu who appeared behind him.

Huangfu Gu looked at Lin Xiu who was attacking and at this moment he also recovered from his shock.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear had a large amount of black energy surging out.

It formed a black giant dragon and it directly gnawed at Huangfu Gu with its teeth and claws!

Huangfu Gu unfolded the ‘Sphere’ at this time, but the black giant bit it and rammed towards him directly.

At this moment, his body slammed into the matrix behind him heavily, making a loud noise.

“go!”

And at this moment, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand waved directly into the air.

A terrifying arc-shaped white energy rushed over.

‘Heaven Breaking Strike’!!!

“Go away!!!”

Huangfu Gu’s face became extremely ugly at this time and there was a look of fear in his eyes.

He wanted to dodge, but the black dragon bit his ‘Sphere’, making him unable to dodge at all.

If he kept his ‘Sphere’, then he would die a worse death!

Boom—

At the next moment, the power of this ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’ had already impacted his body.

The powerful and terrifying power directly crushed Huangfu Gu’s body.

Although the power they passed from the Sage warrior Realm can greatly enhance their strength.

However, the physical strength will not increase. In the face of such a powerful force, he has no way to resist it.

Following the death of these two Sage warriors, Huangfu Gu and Huangfu Tai turned into two golden beams of light at the same time and wanted to fly away.

“Where are you going?”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu said lightly.

The two golden light groups, Huangfu Gu and Huangfu Tai, were madly attacking the surrounding matrices, but they found that they could not rush out at all!

With their strength, there is no way to return to the Warrior God Realm!

It seems that things have evolved to be the same as before.

“I want your power.”

Lin Xiu sneered. At this moment, his figure flashed and he grabbed the two golden light balls in both hands.

With a thought, the system’s ‘Engulf’ skill was activated at the same time.

Soon, these two golden light clusters were madly absorbed by Lin Xiu at a speed visible to the naked eye.

“Ah! Let go of us!”

As Lin Xiu absorbed their power of gods, there was a heart-piercing sound from the two groups of light.

But Lin Xiu didn’t care about them.

This is simply experience points delivered to his door, why not absorb them?

At this time, Lin Xiu was running the power of his body frantically and the speed of absorbing the power was getting faster and faster.

Soon, the two groups of light became dim until they disappeared.

At this moment, the Warrior God Realm.

pfft—

Huangfu Tai and Huangfu Gu sat cross-legged on the ground. After Lin Xiu had completely absorbed their divine power, they opened their eyes and spat out a mouthful of blood.

Their bodies were trembling as if they would fall to the ground with a light touch.

“Damn…Damn…”

Huangfu Gu said, trembling.

This time, the power of the gods they transmitted to the planet Namir is very large.

At this time, as they were absorbed by Lin Xiu, they lost more than half of their strength.

Three times, this is already the third time!

“Ah! I want him to die! I want him to die!!!”

They’ve gone completely crazy.

But Lin Xiu could not see this scene.

After absorbing these energies, he immediately felt refreshed.

Taking a closer look, the experience has actually risen to about 30%!

When Lin Xiu saw the system panel, his eyes were filled with surprise.

It’s already 30% and it’s only a matter of time before the level up.

As long as he successfully level up, then he will be able to reach the level of the god warrior.

When he arrives at the Sage warrior Realm, he will be able to take Luo Yue back. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu was slightly excited.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered and the surrounding matrix disappeared instantly.

Looking around, the warriors of the Divine Realm are now completely dumbfounded.

They never thought that the two elders from the ‘God descend’ were killed by Lin Xiu.

Especially now that Lin Xiu’s armor was partially damaged and the exposed bones made them even more frightened.

“It’s not human… He’s not human!”

The surrounding warriors of the Divine Domain all said in horror at this time.

“Huh? I seem to be despised…”

Lin Xiu looked at his hands that had no flesh at all and said helplessly.

Holy water, next, go to the holy city to find the so-called holy water and restore his body.

“Continue attacking!”

Just when the warriors of the Divine Domain wanted to retreat, a sound like the rolling thunder came from above the sky.

“Domain Lord!”

When the surrounding warriors saw this scene, they all shouted out in surprise.

At this time, the body of an old man was suspended in the air.

Lin Xiu looked at the old man and he could clearly feel that his strength was much stronger than that of ordinary Sage warriors.

At this time, Lin Xiu used the Analytic Eye and found that the strength of this old man was lower than his own physical attributes and the rest were similar to his own level.

interesting.

“You’ve killed so many people in my Divine Domain, have you had enough.”

The old man looked at Lin Xiu floating in the sky and said lightly.

“It’s your people who sent their heads to me.”

Lin Xiu spread out his hands and said helplessly.
