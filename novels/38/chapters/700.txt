Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Such a terrifying lightning…”

When the rest of the crowd saw what was happening, all of them were shocked. Even when it was far away, they could still see how thick the current was and it was sending chills down their spine.

“That’s the source mark of a master warrior. Wu Changkong’s one resembles the lightning. It looks so scary.”

When Chen Yan noticed the source mark on Wu Changkong’s head, he muttered to himself.

He read about this previously. Once they become master warriors, they would be able to get their unique source mark.

These source marks are unique to each warrior and they would appear on the top of their forehead.

It would only appear once all the energy inside the warrior’s body was activated.

These marks are different for each warrior. These source marks were made up of different elements and all of them had different skills attached.

Wu Changkong’s source mark was of the defensive type and it was the lightning one, which was the strongest amongst it.

The terrifying power of the lightning caused the whole stadium to turn dark.

As for Lin Xiu who was completely covered in it, he would most probably be…

“How is that possible?!”

All of the audience turned towards Lin Xiu and noticed that he was not even in pain after being wrapped inside these thick currents.

He remained motionless and his face was calm, allowing the current to travel all over his body.

“You…you…”

Wu Changkong was shocked as he widened his eyes in surprise.

How is this possible?!

His lightning skills from his source mark were not effective on this brat?!

In fact, Lin Xiu looked calm and relaxed. It didn’t even look as if he was pretending.

“This is the strength that a warrior master would get?” Lin Xiu raised his arm and played with the current travelling around his body.

“That’s all you have?”

Damn it!

After hearing how arrogant Lin Xiu was, Wu Changkong was in rage. He stood one step back, raised his sword into the air and released a strong sword aura.

Then, he rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

Lin Xiu had a cold laugh. With his black spear, he completely blocked the scary sword aura that was coming from Wu Changkong’s spear.

“My turn.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and swung the spear in his arm. The lightning that was wrapped around Lin Xiu suddenly started dancing as Lin Xiu moved his black spear.

” ‘Thousand Thunder’!!!!!”

As Lin Xiu roared, these lightning shot up into the air.

Within seconds, there were loud thunders that rang throughout the hall.

As they broke into hundreds of lightning, it struck the ground from the sky!

“Oh my god!”

“Run!”

Some of the warriors who were near the edge of the stage quickly ran away.

“AHHHH!!!”

Wu Changkong was on the stage and as the lightning headed towards him, he had nowhere to hide.

These terrifying lightning landed onto his body and he felt an intense pain all over. He could also feel numbness all over his body.

Although he could disregard some of it, Lin Xiu’s strength was too powerful and he could still feel the effects of it.

“Goodbye!”

Lin XIu had a sharp look in his eyes as he held onto his spear. He screamed as he aimed the tip of the spear towards Wu Changkong.

He did not use any warrior skills this time. It was just a normal spear but the strength at which it was pierced towards Wu Changkong was horrifying Wu Changkong’s pupils dilated as he saw the spear headed towards him. He tried to run but the lightning that came from the sky had numbed him and he couldn’t move!

” ‘Yuan’!! “

He screamed out loud and managed to release his ‘Yuan’ just in time!

However, the tip of the black spear had already pierced into his ‘Yuan’. The things that happened next were completely different from what Wu Changkong had imagined. There was a loud crack and soon, multiple cracks appeared all over his ‘Yuan’.

At that moment, his ‘Yuan’ was destroyed by the spear!

His ‘Yuan’ broke!

Wu Changkong was still in shock but before he could react, the spear had already pierced through his forehead! There was blood splattered everywhere.

Clang – –

The huge sword that Wu Changkong used fell onto the ground instantly and the loud sound rang through the hall.

All of the audience were silent as they were shocked. A pin-drop silence filled the entire stage.

“He…..he killed Wu Changkong?!”

There was a voice that spoke up and that’s when everyone else realised what had happened.

The man on the top of the Tianlong List, the warrior master, Wu Changkong, was defeated!

“Anyone else?!”

Lin Xiu placed his spear onto the ground and looked at all of the warriors around.

When the warriors heard Lin Xiu’s challenge, all of them shivered in fear.

The strongest man, Wu Changkong, had just been killed by Lin Xiu. Who would be brave enough to go up there?! “Changkong…” The elder on the audience seat stared at Changkong’s body. He clenched onto his fist as his fingernails dug into his palm.

He looked at Lin Xiu with eyes that were filled with hatred.

Qian Jin, who was on the other side of the stage, was shocked as well.

He knew that Lin Xiu was powerful but he didn’t know that he was this great! Lin Xiu had killed Wu Changkong! “Brother Lin, good job!!!!”

Lei Chong, who was on the audience seat, was cheering with happiness.

“From today onwards, Brother Lin will be the top 1 or the Tianlong List!”

Chen Lan’s body was shaking. He would have never thought that an earthling would be able to take the top seat on the rank!

This was maddening!

Lin Xiu also received a notification from his system. When he took a look at it, it was the EXP that he had gained from killing Wu Changkong that allowed him to upgrade onto another level!

He is already level 46 now!

As his level increased, Lin Xiu felt a smooth, comforting feeling that travelled across his body. He could feel as if the energy that he had exhausted slowly being healed.

As the side effect of ‘Rage’ was about to hit him, Lin Xiu sat on the ground with his legs crossed and started activating his ‘Cultivation Technique’ by absorbing energy from the air around him.

“If there’s anyone who wants a challenge, come up here.”

Lin Xiu looked around at the warriors around him before closing his eyes.

None of the warriors dared to move after hearing what Lin XIu said.

Now that the withdrawal symptoms from ‘Rage’ were happening, Lin Xiu was still trying his best to pretend that nothing was wrong.

If there was anyone who dared to challenge him now, he would be dead.

Time passed quickly as Lin Xiu continued his cultivation on stage. He had completely forgotten about the time that had passed.

“End of match!”
