Chapter 710 You Don’t Recognize Me?

Chen An said with a grim expression at this time.

The so-called old man in his mouth was Lin Xiu who was in the forest at that time.

Actually, he wasn’t old. At that time, Lin Xiu looked like a middle-aged man because of his disguise.

Chen An’s words were unbearable, making Liu Yanran’s face flush with anger.

“By the way, before killing you, how about we inspect the goods first?”

Chen An looked at Liu Yanran’s beautiful figure, at this moment, he couldn’t help swallowing secretly and then he reached out to touch Liu Yanran’s body.

“Go away!”

When Liu Yanran saw this scene, she suddenly became extremely anxious and there were tears in her eyes.

Death is not terrible, what is terrible is that you will be insulted before dying.

“Hehe, this is interesting.” Chen An smiled morbidly at this moment and reached out to touch Liu Yanran’s cheek.

“It’s so noisy, how is anyone going to sleep?”

At this moment, a voice came from the other side, which immediately startled them.

“Who is it!?”

At this time, Chen An held the lighting equipment in his hand and shone around.

Soon, they saw a young man with a lot of battle marks in front, stretching and standing up slowly.

Although Chen An and the others found a lot of corpses when they first came up, they didn’t find any living people, so they didn’t pay much attention.

Seeing this figure now, their eyes could not help but change slightly.

Instinctively alert.

“Hey, it’s you guys ah.” Lin Xiu glanced around and found Liu Yanran’s figure, but Liu Yanran was now bound.

And that Chen An, Lin Xiu also remembered, was one of the men he met in the forest when he first came to Marqi Planet.

Did this guy and others kidnap Liu Yanran?

“You know me?”

Chen An frowned when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

There was a faint sense of uneasiness in his heart.

But at this time, relying on his own perception ability, he found that Lin Xiu’s body’s source strength fluctuations were very weak, just like an ordinary low-level warrior.

He was a little nervous at first, but now he was full of confidence again.

An ordinary warrior was simply courting death to go against him. “Why, kidnapping a young lady in the middle of the night?”

Lin Xiu yawned and said aloud.

The previous battle consumed too much of Lin Xiu’s stamina, so Lin Xiu fell asleep.

Now when he woke up, he found these people up here.

And after today’s battle, Lin Xiu found that he had been promoted again!

After almost all the potential points were added to his physique, Lin Xiu felt that his entire body seemed to become stronger again At this time, Liu Yanran looked at Lin Xiu, who looked a little in a bad state because of the previous battle and found him to be very familiar.

Black pupils…

“Hmph, a mere pariah, you’re courting death.”

Chen An snorted coldly at this moment, then looked at the men standing beside him and after gesturing to them, two of the men took the long knives in their hands and walked towards Lin Xiu.

“Oh? Want to silent someone?” Lin Xiu raised his brows and then said lightly.

“Ha ha.”

The two men had hideous smiles on their faces and they didn’t say any more nonsense. The swords they were holding attacked Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu stood motionless and did not dodge at all. In the eyes of Chen An and others, Lin Xiu seemed to be too scared to dodge.

Go to hell!

Dang dang– But when their war knives slashed on Lin Xiu’s body, they made a crisp sound. The war knives couldn’t penetrate Lin Xiu’s body at all!

The two men who attacked Lin Xiu with war knives had their eyes wide open at this time in disbelief.

Their sharp war knives had no effect on Lin Xiu!?

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu’s battle suit was actually covered with a faint layer of source strength. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

It was this source strength that protected Lin Xiu’s body. “Children, don’t play with such dangerous toys.”

Lin Xiu smiled. Before they could regain their senses, they found that the sword in their hands appeared in Lin Xiu’s hands.

Pa pa

And with two crisp sounds, these two war knives were directly broken by Lin Xiu!

Looking at this terrifying scene, Chen An and the others were so shocked that their jaws dropped.

Although their weapons were not magic weapons, they were still war knives made of extremely hard materials. How much strength does it take to do this?

“You…”

The two men who attacked Lin Xiu also clearly felt that Lin Xiu was not as simple as he seemed on the surface and they subconsciously took a step back.

Bang bang

But the moment they stepped back, Lin Xiu ejected a small energy ball that was condensed and compressed by the source strength and immediately penetrated the heads of the two of them.

Lin Xiu actually learned this method from the old man.

When fighting Wu Changkong, the old man used this method to plot against himself.

“You… who the hell are you!”

Chen An saw that his companions were killed instantly and now his body was shaking.

How is this possible? He clearly felt just now that Lin Xiu has no strength, but why, why did he, a person with no source fluctuations, suddenly burst out with such a powerful force?

“I’ve already said that we’ve met, you don’t recognize me?”

Lin Xiu smiled, then stretched out his right hand and the Dark Edge spear on the ground flew into Lin Xiu’s hand.

Holding the Dark Edge spear and waving it with one hand, the head of the spear pointed at him and the corner of his mouth curled up.

Spear?

Chen An was stunned when he saw this scene. He didn’t watch today’s warrior competition, so naturally he didn’t know about Lin Xiu.

But seeing this black spear in Lin Xiu’s hands, even the spearhead was black, he seemed to think of something and his expression suddenly changed.

Forest… The middle-aged man in the forest also used such a spear. No, it should be said that this long spear is exactly the same.

“Are you….”

He seemed to have thought of something and his face suddenly changed greatly.

“I know who he is and he is the number one on the list today!”

A man beside Chen An foudn that the more he looked at Lin Xiu, the more familiar he appeared, especially with Lin Xiu’s unique spear.

“Well, it seems that you have remembered…” Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up slightly and then he waved the Dark Edge spear he was holding and flaming birds shot out one after another.
