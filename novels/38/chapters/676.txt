Their eyes were not black or tawny, but pale blue.

They looked a bit like a Westerner’s pupils, but they had a Chinese-like appearance, which made Lin Xiu feel very curious.

What made Lin Xiu even more curious was that the words spoken by these people were the same as the common language of the Federation.

So Lin Xiu could understand.

Could it be that this planet is also related to the earth in some way?

Lin Xiu found it more and more interesting.

“What do you think?”

The man at the head showed a wicked smile at this time, and glanced at the woman, looking at the beautiful face of the woman, he was very turned on.

“Let her come and serve our brothers first!”

“Ahahaha!!!”

Hearing his words, the others laughed out loud.

When the woman heard his words, her face flushed with anger, but seeing so many of them, her eyes turned a little red.

“Even if I die, I won’t let you get what you want!”

Holding a short knife, she looked at the men in black and said aloud.

“Hmph, then I’ll dismember those two people first.”

“Let you watch them die in front of you first, and then deal with you.”

Hearing his words, the faces of the two men suddenly paled.

“Yan…Yanran…Or you should follow them.” The tall and sturdy man said with a trembling body at this time.

He could see that these people were not good people.

It’s very possible that they really want to kill him.

He doesn’t want to die!

“Chen An, what do you mean!” Hearing the man’s words, the woman called Yanran turned pale with anger.

She looked at the other man next to her and saw that this man was also silent, and her chest hurt even more with anger.

Both of them were men who pursued her. Originally, she still enjoyed the feeling of being supported, but she never thought that they would be like this.

“Hehe, help me catch her and | might let you guys live.”

The man at the head saw this scene and said aloud.

“If you don’t do what I say, I’ll cut you into sticks later!”

When the woman heard this scene, her face changed greatly. She gritted her teeth and stabbed the short knife directly into her chest.

She would rather die than be insulted!

Boom–

But at this moment, Chen An directly grabbed her wrist, and the other hand used force to snatch the short knife in her hand.

And at this moment, the other man who was silent also grabbed her shoulders and didn’t let her move.

“You guys dare!”

The woman felt this scene, and her lungs exploded with anger.

She never imagined that these people would dare to do this.

“Liu Yanran, I have long disliked you, aren’t you a goddess? We have been chasing you for so long, and we are still hanging on without you giving us any answer!”

Chen An said coldly at this time.

The other man’s face also became cold at this time.

Once people become crazy, they will have no scruples.

“Very well, brothers, let’s take turns.”

The leader licked his lips and said aloud.

Liu Yanran’s face was pale at this time. At this time, she couldn’t move at all, and she couldn’t even struggle.

“That one over there, get lost!”

But at this moment, the leader saw Lin Xiu, who was sitting on the stone, eating a fish, leaving only bones.

Lin Xiu was still in a state of disguise, and now he looked like a middle-aged uncle with a beard.

Lin Xiu glanced at him, ignored his words, jumped off the stone, and cleaned the long spear in his hand by the river bank.

“Eh? This man’s weapons seem to be pretty good.”

The leader immediately showed a greedy look when he saw the Dark Edge spear that Lin Xiu was cleaning. At this time, he took out a laser pistol from his waist, and aimed

it at the head of Lin Xiu, who was squatting by the river and cleaning the spear in his hand.

Die for me!

Asly smile appeared on his face, and in the next moment, he pulled the trigger.

Swoosh—

A powerful laser beam shot towards Lin Xiu in an instant!

This laser ray was very powerful, obviously more advanced than those laser guns on earth.

He originally thought that he could directly penetrate Lin Xiu’s head. After all, he felt that Lin Xiu seemed to be just an ordinary warrior, and he didn’t seem to be afraid at

all.

Boom–

But at this moment, Lin Xiu, who had his back to him, raised his hand and smacked directly, and the laser beam was shot away.

It directly hit the huge tree next to it, leaving a large hole on the trunk of the tree.

“Want to kill me?”

At this time, Lin Xiu stood up with the Dark Edge spear in his left hand, then held a stone in his right hand, looked at the man with the laser gun over there and said

indifferently.

“You…”

This man’s eyes widened – Lin Xiu was able to shoot this laser beam into the air at will. This strength seemed a bit terrifying!

But just when he wanted to say something, Lin Xiu threw the small stone that he was holding in his right hand directly at him!
