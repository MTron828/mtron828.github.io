Chapter 717 Kill the Snow Lizard!

‘Sphere’!

Without the slightest hesitation, Lin Xiu unfolded his ‘Sphere’ directly.

As the ‘Sphere’ unfolded, at this moment, the energy group that the snow lizard spit out directly hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

The incomparably terrifying power, although it did not directly break Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, it made Lin Xiu’s body slam into the ground directly.

The entire body was instantly buried under the heavy snow.

Those people ignored Lin Xiu. At this time, a large number of warriors continued to attack the snow lizard.

“This skill… seems a little familiar.”

Qian Jin sat in the carriage of this train, looking at the scene outside through the window.

He found the huge flaming phoenix just now familiar.

Now, although the carriage was very squeezy, it was still possible to rest in it.

Some of the equipment has not been completely damaged and could provide some heating, so that the air inside the car was warmer than the outside.

“How long are we going to wait here?”

A man said aloud at this time.

This snow lizard was really too rough and fleshy. There were so many warriors and there was no lack of warrior-level powerhouses, yet it had not been killed yet.

Boom

The moment the man spoke, the whole carriage shook heavily again.

“Don’t be nervous, now this monster should be attacking those warriors, not us.”

When Jiang Jun looked at some warriors who seemed to want to escape from the carriage, he suddenly said aloud.

“Those warriors haven’t used their full strength yet, so if you want to kill this snow lizard, it probably won’t be that fast. You can rest for a while.”

Jiang Jun said lightly. While talking, he looked at Huangji next to him.

At this time, Huangji had closed his eyes and he was still running the ‘Cultivation Technique’, absorbing the energy in the air.

He seemed to be preparing for the next action, maintaining his stamina.

Qian Jin looked around and found that Lin Xiu still did not appear.

“This guy… don’t tell me he really went to kill the snow lizard…”

“Pei.”

At the same time, Lin Xiu had already struggled out of the snow and spat out a chunk of snow from his mouth.

The power of this damn snow lizard was really terrifying, just like this, even after he unfolded his ‘Sphere’, the terrifying impact almost broke it.

He pulled his Dark Edge spear out of the snow and looked in front. There were still a large number of warriors attacking this snow lizard.

It seems that it was because of his ‘Awe of the phoenix’ skill just now. Now these warriors all knew that the fire attribute skill has a greater effect on this snow lizard.

Therefore, these people were now using these fire-attribute skills to continuously attack the snow lizard.

Some master warrior-level powerhouses used huge flame balls to attack this snow lizard.

“Is this the power of a naster warrior-level powerhouse…”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes. The strength of these master warrior-level warriors seemed to be even more powerful than Wu Changkong.

The source strength in their bodies was strong and the fire attribute skills power that erupted was even more terrifying than Lin Xiu’s flaming phoenix. Although that snow lizard has rough skin and thick flesh, under the attack of so many warriors and those powerful skills, this snow lizard seemed to have suffered a lot of damage.

And at this time, a lot of fresh blood was already flowing down the body of the snow lizard.

No, I must kill this snow lizard myself.

Lin Xiu climbed up from the snow, holding the Dark Edge spear in both hands, pointing straight at the sky!

Boom

There was a loud noise and at this moment, a lot of flames burst out from the spear head.

The flames were continuously released into the sky, instantly forming a sea of fire.

In the next moment, the flames in the sky turned into balls of flames, ramming down continuously.

All fell on the body of the snow lizard.

Lin Xiu didn’t think about anything now and kept waving the Dark Edge spear in his hand, releasing the flame skills.

At this time, there were too many people using skills together and no one paid attention to Lin Xiu.

After some time, Lin Xiu felt that his body was a little tired.

And he looked a little out of breath.

There were already quite a few warrior corpses around, they were piled up and all over the floor.

And this snow lizard has become weak now and the attack frequency has also become lower.

There was a lot of blood flowing from the wound on his body, staining the surrounding snow red.

Now Lin Xiu held his breath, stopped thinking about his body, then focused on the snow lizard.

Now he has to wait for the fatal blow. As long as the fatal blow kills the snow lizard, he will gain a lot of experience.

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu’s body trembled with excitement.

Upgrade upgrade!

Boom

Lin Xiu was like a hunter in the jungle, standing still on the snow ground, waiting for the moment when the snow lizard was about to die.

Finally, not long after, the body of this blood-covered lizard was about to crumble.

Good chance!!!

The look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed. Lin Xiu, who had been prepared for a long time, began to gather all the strength in his body at this time.

As soon as his legs moved, a terrifying power erupted immediately and the whole person leaped upwards!

The Dark Edge spear held in his hand was already full of dark red flames at this time.

Go to… hell!!!

Lin Xiu roared in his heart, holding the Dark Edge spear in his right hand and stabbed the snow lizard directly in the forehead!

Boom– Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

The Dark Edge spear stabbed in its forehead, but the spear head only pierced a little, not completely.

“Ah!!!”

Lin Xiu roared loudly, using all the strength of his body.

Boom–

With a dull sound, in the next moment, the entire spear finally pierced directly into the forehead of this snow lizard.

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for killing the snow lizard and gaining experience 15448484634…” This amount of experience dazzled him.

But Lin Xiu didn’t have time to think about it anymore, so he pulled out his Dark Edge spear,, then stepped back to the other side.

“Look! That snow lizard has been killed!”

Inside the carriage, a warrior sitting next to Qian Jin heard a loud noise, then quickly ran out to take a look, just to see the snow lizard lying on the ground.

“Really!?”

Qian Jin was also startled and at this moment, he and the others ran out at the same time.

Not only them, but some warriors hiding in the carriage also ran out and looked at the scene in the distance.

The huge and terrifying snow lizard finally fell to the ground after many warriors attacked for almost three hours!
