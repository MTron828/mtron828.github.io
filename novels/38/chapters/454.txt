Chapter 455: Rank 8 Evolved Beast!

As the surrounding space was distorted, a space crack appeared again.

So that’s it!

Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank when he saw this scene. It was obvious that these space cracks were caused by this robot.

As for why it would appear in this place and what the energy body it was holding in its hand, Lin Xiu still didn’t know.

But the laser beam from its body just attacked Lin Xiu and he was irritated.

At this time, his right hand gripped the extremely sharp dagger, then he swam directly to the front.

Boom–

There was a large number of particle rays converging on the robot’s chest and soon, another energy ray was formed to attack Lin Xiu.

But this time Lin Xiu was prepared and easily dodged.

Now Lin Xiu stared at the robot stubbornly.

He wants to… kill it!

“Attention everyone, remember to record what happened below and check if the monitoring device below can be repaired.” At this time, at the gate of the Sacred Region Academy, which was on the coast, a middle-aged man looked at several technical staff who had already put on diving suits and said aloud.

“Yes!” These men nodded.

They were not very strong and the reason why they were in the Sacred Region Academy was just that they were engaged in scientific research and development in the research center.

“Be careful.” The middle-aged man glanced at them, then said solemnly.

These people nodded at this time, then swam directly to the bottom of the sea without hesitation.

Dean Baili saw this scene in the control room and his expression became serious.

Because he felt a little uneasy now, this kind of uneasy feeling has not surfaced for many years.

Did something happen below?

Moreover, the space crack that Lin Xiu had recorded made him very worried.

Meanwhile, Lin Xiu was approaching the intelligent robot, but at this moment, it did not continue to attack Lin Xiu, but ran away!

Where are you going!

Lin Xiu saw this scene, which stimulated his fighting spirit and he wanted to take it down!

But what he didn’t expect was that in the next moment, the surrounding seawater was swaying constantly and soon the space crack seemed to start to grow bigger!

He looked over there and found that the robot had flown there. The energy body with golden light in both hands was held up high.

It seems that under the influence of this thing, the space crack has become larger and larger.

Damn!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened because the space crack in front of him had become too big, almost like a black hole.

And it didn’t seem to stop expanding.

The staff who just went into the sea also felt their whole bodies being dragged along with the sea wildly.

As if there was stormy weather above.

But they still persevered and continued swimming deeper.

The fish-type evolved beasts around swam frantically at this time as if they had received some kind of stimulation.

Oh my…

Lin Xiu, who was at the bottom of the sea, was stunned as he watched the space crack grow bigger and bigger.

And at this time, the golden-yellow energy body in the robot’s hand seemed to have dimmed a lot as the space cracks grew larger.

At this time, its body began to swim towards the space crack like it wanted to swim into it.

Trying to flee!?

Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank suddenly when he saw this scene, then gritted his teeth and swam directly to the front with all his strength!

For some reason, that robot’s speed had clearly slowed down.

Lin Xiu mobilized the source strength of his whole body, wrapped it around his body, and swam forward with all his strength very quickly almost like a fish in the water.

Soon, he pulled the foot of the artificial intelligence robot who wanted to escape into the space crack.

Come out!

Then, with Lin Xiu’s violent force, the artificial intelligence robot was directly thrown off by Lin Xiu.

Boom–

It slammed into the seamount behind.

Some lights on its body seemed to have been smashed and the energy body in his hand fell directly into the dark place below.

Very good!

Lin Xiu was overjoyed when he saw this scene. This robot was too weird and he must take the energy body ashore to study what is going on.

But when Lin Xiu approached the robot, there seemed to be a loud noise from the space crack behind.

This kind of sound seemed to penetrate the eardrum and Lin Xiu’s head was a little dizzy.

What’s that!?

Lin Xiu’s face changed and after shook his head fiercely, he turned around and saw that a huge mouth appeared in that huge space crack!

There were huge sharp teeth on the upper and lower ends of the mouth like two rows of jagged teeth that gave one goosebump.

Evolved… evolved beast!?

Lin Xiu widened his eyes and watched this unbelievable scene. His mouth was so big. What kind of evolved beast is this!?

Too late to think, at this moment, Lin Xiu directly used his system skill-‘Analytic Eye’

“The rank 8 evolved beast-the furious black whale (alien creature), the overlord of the sea, has a huge and powerful body and feeds on other evolved beasts in the sea.”Rank… rank 8 evolved beast!?

Seeing the information provided by the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu’s body couldn’t help but tremble.

This was not a cat or a dog, but a rank 8 evolved beast!

And at this time, its huge head slowly emerged from the space crack.

Its skin was black, but it seemed to have many spikes on it, which looked terrifying and it also has a pair of scarlet eyes. The eyeballs were like human eyeballs, but they were countless times larger.

Roar–

As soon as this thing got its head out of the space crack, it made a loud noise.

The evolved beasts that were originally in the water seemed to feel something and they were all stirred up.

It was as if they had lost their sanity – they were swimming frantically and crashing.

Boom boom—— 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

The shaking stopped initially but at this time, the entire Sacred Region Academy shook crazily again!

And this time the tremor was several times stronger than before!
