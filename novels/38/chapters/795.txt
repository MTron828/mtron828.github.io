Chapter 796: Forging the Body with Fire

The more he continued to go up, the hotter Lin Xiu felt.

Even if he was running the Heart of Frost to keep his body cool, it still wasn’t enough.

“It’s so hot…”

Lin Xiu’s forehead was already dripping with a lot of sweat.

Sweat also began to drip from the fingers of both hands.

If he had known earlier, he would have gotten a cooling suit.

However, the effect of his Heart of Frost should be greater than the effect of their cooling suits.

Gritting his teeth, Lin Xiu continued to walk to the top of the mountain.

After all, someone who has absorbed the fire of the red lotus can still walk to the top of the mountain.

“Am I finally here…”

As soon as he reached the top of the mountain, Lin Xiu was out of breath for a moment, looked forward and froze in place.

Because now it can be clearly seen that on the top of the mountain is a fairly spacious area.

And in the middle, there was a pretty big circular cave opening.

Looking down from here, you can see that there are dark blue flames inside.

It turned out that the more terrifying flame turned out to be in the middle of this mountain.

The middle of the mountain seemed to be hollowed out and there was such a terrifying flame burning.

Among these flames, there is a flame with a darker color.

Damn...

Looking inside, Lin Xiu felt a little dizzy and he almost fell without noticing.

Lin Xiu, who quickly took a few steps back, was still a little scared.

There are still a lot of dark blue flames around the top of the mountain, but the flames are not as high as the flames inside the mountain.

Should he give it a go?

Lin Xiu looked at the flames and his body moved a little.

Practicing the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’, as long as he can withstand these flames, he can use it to strengthen his body!

Lin Xiu thought about it for a while. After the Heart of Frost in his body started to run wildly, he looked at a dark blue flame and reached out to touch it!

At this time, as his hand slowly moved toward the fire, sweat dripped from Lin Xiu’s forehead.

If he can’t stand these flames, his hands may be burned into bones and he can forget about forging his body.

“what...”

Gritting his teeth, Lin Xiu directly reached out and touched the flame.

As soon as his palm entered the flames, Lin Xiu could clearly feel an extremely scorching temperature.

With the frantic operation of the Heart of Frost, the body that had become cold was useless at this moment.

The temperature was really too high, it was like putting your hands in a frying pan. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

And this temperature was much higher.

“Ding!”

“‘Engulf’ skill activated…”

At this time, the ‘Engulf’ skill was automatically activated.

Coupled with Lin Xiu’s ‘Bodybuilding Technique’, at this moment, the burning sensation seemed to be reduced a little, but it was still very uncomfortable.

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu’s entire palm immediately turned red and a large number of blisters burst out instantly.

This is because after Lin Xiu’s body was reshaped with amethyst divine water, his body became stronger. If he was a normal warrior, even if he had the strength of Lin Xiu, the flesh on his hands would probably be directly burned.

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth while the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ was running wildly.

Coupled with Lin Xiu’s powerful repairing ability, his hand was just burned and ruptured and it healed at a speed visible to the naked eye.

swoosh—

But at this moment, the corner of Lin Xiu’s eyes seemed to see a bright light strike!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted, then his hand was directly withdrawn from the dark blue flame.

With a movement of his body, he quickly dodged.

Boom—

And where he was just now, a dazzling beam of light rushed away, making a huge sound.

“It’s you?!”

Lin Xiu suddenly looked at the place where the beam hit and he could clearly see Yan Yongxin.

“I didn’t expect that you would actually be here.”

Yan Yongxin looked at Lin Xiu and sneered.

He stared at Lin Xiu, with sweat dripping down his forehead.

He also did not expect that Lin Xiu would be able to reach the top.

The temperature here is too high and some master warrior-level warriors can’t come up at all.

At this moment, Lin Xiu also had a killing intent in his eyes.

Then he looked at the Dark Edge spear on the ground and when he stretched out his right hand, the spear suddenly made a clanging sound and in the next moment, it flew towards Lin Xiu’s hand.

After holding the Dark Edge spear, Lin Xiu’s hands that had just been scorched by the flames began to recover.

“Even if you don’t come, I’m going to find a chance to kill you.”

Lin Xiu looked at Yan Yongxin and said coldly.

“What a joke.”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Yan Yongxin burst out laughing.

He is a king warrior, a mere master warrior actually said that he was looking for an opportunity to kill him?!

‘Heavenly Array’!

‘Power of the Stars’!

‘Fury’!

Lin Xiu knew that Yan Yongxin was a tough guy to deal with, so he didn’t hesitate at all and immediately used all his skills.

And it was nighttime so ‘Power of the Stars’ can also be used!

With the use of the skill, a ray of light burst out from Lin Xiu’s body, instantly covering the ground.

Source field?!

Looking at this scene, Yan Yongxin didn’t take it seriously.

But at the next moment, the sky that filled with stars seemed to become brighter in an instant.

Those rays of light seemed to be shining down from the sky, making Lin Xi’s whole body a bright white light.

And at this time, Lin Xiu unleashed all his strength without hesitation and the surrounding ground seemed to shake slightly.

“Playing tricks huh!”

Seeing Lin Xiu glowing with white light all over his body, Yan Yongxin roared angrily and threw his fists in the air with both hands!

crackling-

With the release of the powerful source strength from his body, at this moment, two huge hands of lightning bolts appeared in the air.

He bombarded Lin Xiu directly!

Looking at this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly and he dodged!

boom boom boom —

Those two terrifying hands of lightning were frantically chasing Lin Xiu.

There was a loud noise all over the ground and it shook.

But Lin Xiu’s speed was too fast. At this moment, he appeared in front of Yan Yongxin!

swoosh—

The spear was like a dragon, with a white light, stabbing over.
