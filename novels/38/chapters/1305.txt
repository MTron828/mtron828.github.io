1306 The Ma Family from God City.

The man’s machete collided with Baili Haoling’s daggers and he was instantly pushed far back.

Plus, at that instant, Baili Haoling quickly continued her attack on the man with both her daggers.

The man panicked and he could also use his machete to protect himself.

He didn’t have the ability to fight back.

At the same time, Lin Xiu looked around at the warrior gods who were attacking him and sneered.

All of them released their skills and with their weapons above their heads, all of them were trying to attack Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu dodged the attack and took the opportunity to return his attack.

Boom boom boom — –

All of them landed directly on the body of the warrior gods.

All of them were thrown into the air from Lin Xiu’s punch.

None of them have the ability to retaliate.

There were two of them who wanted to release their domain energy but as soon as he released them, they soon realised that it was useless.

As they took a closer look at the ground beneath them, there was a white glow that covered the entire ground.

It was this white glow that had been released that prevented them from releasing their domain energy.

They had lost the ability to release their domain energy!

Purification Domain!

When they first started the fight, Lin Xiu had already released his purification Domain and this was why none of the warriors had the abilities to release their domain energy.

Lin Xiu continued attacking them with his fists.

Soon, all of the warriors were defeated on the ground because of Lin Xiu.

All of these ended quickly within a blink of an eye.

At the same time, Baili Haoling had already chopped off both the arms of the man that she had been fighting with. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

The warriors around were shocked by the scene before their eyes.

The tables have turned with Lin Xiu’s presence.

Plus, Lin Xiu had just defeated all ten warrior gods that were around him with his bare hands.

How powerful were these people?!

Most of them on the ground were wailing in pain.

However, they couldn’t even move a finger.

The strength in Lin Xiu’s fist was extremely terrifying.

All of the bones in these warriors’ bodies have been completely crushed because of Lin Xiu’s punches.

Lin Xiu looked around before walking towards the man.

The warrior who was known as the ‘young master’ by the men around him, was holding onto his chest while groaning in pain.

“Don’t! Don’t come here!!!!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was getting closer, the man subconsciously moved backwards.

But, his back was already against the wall and there was nowhere he could hide.

“Earlier….did you say that you would chop off all our limbs?”

Lin Xiu soon appeared inches away from him.

“I…..I didn’t…”

The look on his face changed and he denied everything.

From the look on Lin Xiu’s face, it was obvious that he would be the one losing all four limbs!

As he thought of it, his face turned ghastly pale and his body started trembling uncontrollably.

“Hmm….it looks like you aren’t an ordinary man which is why I will not be doing so…”

As he was shaking vigorously in fear, Lin Xiu said something unexpected.

The man quite sighed with relief after hearing that.

He suddenly looked confident and said, “I am the descendant of the Ma family, Ma Jiayun.”

“Since you are someone smart, I won’t be needing an apology for what happened today.”

The man, known as Ma Jiayun, assumed that Lin Xiu was afraid of his family and now he was no longer frightened.

“What I meant to say was….in order to keep all four of your limbs, you’ll have to buy them with money.”

But, Lin Xiu crushed his dreams.

It felt as if a pail of ice cold water had been poured over his head.

“You…you…..!”

Ma Jiayun’s eyes were wide open and he couldn’t believe what he had just heard!

He was Ma Jiayun from the Ma family!

Lin Xiu had been informed but why wasn’t he afraid?

“I am from the Ma family!!!!”

...

“Yes? So?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and a wide smile appeared across his face.

The man didn’t know how to answer this.

This was because Lin Xiu did not care about how he was from the Ma family!

Plus, it was now clear that if he didn’t lose anything, he would not be able to leave this place tonight.

“How…..how much do you want?!”

The look on Ma Jiayun’s face was the ugliest thing ever seen.

“Well, you must want to keep all four of your limb.”

“A hundred million for each.”

Lin Xiu lifted up his index finger as he informed the man of his condition.

Baili Haoling, who was standing behind Lin Xiu, was surprised as well.

...

Lin Xiu was even better than her at making money!

The man had a horrible look on his face as if he was about to lose his life.

A hundred million!!!

Although the Ma family were loaded, it still wouldn’t be easy for them to do so.

“So….how much are you willing to pay?”

Lin Xiu smiled instead.

In the eyes of Ma Jiayun, Lin Xiu’s smile was like the smile of a devil.

“I really don’t have so much…”

Ma Jiayun started crying.

“Alright. It’s fine if you don’t have them.”

Lin Xiu spoke in a serious tone.

Ma Jiayun looked surprised. Was he allowed to leave?

Soon, Lin Xiu’s words were like the sharp knife that pierced through his heart.

“Well, guess we’ll have to chop it off.”

With that said, he moved his right arm and the machete that was on the ground, flew straight into Lin Xiu’s hands.

As he held onto the machete, he was ready to swing it toward Ma Jiayun!

There was no sign of hesitation!

“I’ll pay!!!”

Ma Jiayun quickly screamed.

He had almost lost his arm earlier.

Even if he didn’t get hit, he could already feel the pain that came from the aura of the machete.

“How much?”

Lin Xiu asked again.

“Four hundred million! I’ll give you four hundred million!!!!”

Ma Jiayun clenched onto his jaw and spoke with his teeth clenched together.

“Alright. Deal.”

After transferring four hundred million over to Lin Xiu, he quickly gathered his men and left the training ground.

“This man indeed has a lot of money…”

Seeing how Lin Xiu easily got four hundred million, Baili Haoling’s eyes were wide open.

She suddenly felt that she had made a lost since she only got one hundred million.

“Don’t even think about it. It isn’t easy to get these.”

Lin Xiu peered at Baili Haoling.

“It looks like we will have trouble coming our way soon.”

With the time that he had earlier, Lin Xiu had already read up about the Ma family of the God City.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but furrowed his brows when he learnt who they were.
