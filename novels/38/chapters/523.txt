Chapter 524: A Dangerous Person

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide and felt that his mouth was covered by Luo Yue’s white tender little hand.

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and shook her head, and motioned Lin Xiu not to speak.

At this time, Luo Yue’s eyes were full of caution, this was the first time Lin Xiu saw it.

Lin Xiu looked ahead and seemed to see a number of silhouettes coming from the front side. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“En? Seems like someone was here just now.” A voice came from the back.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were hiding behind them at this time, both of them held their breath and kept very still, and all their source strength was locked and not released.

Lin Xiu looked towards the front and saw several young men and women.

These people were in their twenties, but Lin Xiu could clearly feel the dangerous aura from these people.

Who are these people that make Luo Yue so fearful?

“Only the adventurers who often travel to and from Thunder Valley would know about this road,” A woman who was dressed a little revealingly said with a smile at this time.

“Continue walking, the space cracks… I want to see if there is anything I want this time.” A man said aloud.

Xi xi——

At this moment, there was a sound.

When Lin Xiu heard this sound, the pupils in his eyes suddenly shrank.

“Oh? It looks like someone is here.” A man narrowed his eyes at this time, and then slowly walked in Lin Xiu and Luo Yue’s direction.

Luo Yue became extremely cautious at this time, and her right hand also tightly clenched the hilt of the sword.

As soon as the person comes over, she will rush out to fight.

Roar–

But just as the man got closer and closer to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, a beast roared.

A dog-like evolved beast that wasn’t huge rushed out of the grass.

It pounced on the man’s body!

Boom–

The man waved his right hand, and the body of the evolved beast shattered before it even touched the man.

Blood splashed out in the air.

What a terrifying power!

Lin Xiu was shocked when he saw this scene. According to the Analytical Eye, this evolved beast could be regarded as a rank 6 evolved beast, and it can hide its aura for so long that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue did not sense it.

An evolved beast of this level was killed so easily.

“So it’s just a small animal.” The man frowned.

“No wonder I felt like someone was watching us.”

“Nan Huang, let’s go.” A man said to him.

“Ok.”

After these people left for about ten minutes, Luo Yue’s body relaxed.

When she felt that her hand was still on Lin Xiu’s mouth and she could even feel his hot breath.

Luo Yue quickly put her hand down.

“Hu…” Lin Xiu couldn’t help taking a deep breath at this time, and his body relaxed.

“Who are they?” Lin Xiu looked ahead and then said aloud.

Although there were trees everywhere, Lin Xiu could still sense the power of those people.

Lin Xiu knew that his instincts were always accurate, so he should not be wrong.

“Sky City.” Luo Yue looked at the sky, and then said lightly to Lin Xiu.

Sky City?

“They are from the underworld and are dangerous people.” Luo Yue reminded Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded, then after thinking about it, he curiously asked, “Then what rank are they?”

“Rank 8.” Luo Yue said directly without any hesitation.

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but gasp.

Rank 8

After rank 6, every warrior rank was a watershed. Although Luo Yue’s strength has returned to her peak level of a rank 7 warrior, it was only the beginning of rank 7.

“Every one of them is rank 8?” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but continue to say aloud.

“Yeah.” Luo Yue nodded.

That way, it is indeed too dangerous. If there is a conflict, there is really no way to run.

Even using system skills, it would still be difficult to fight them.

“My strength is still not enough.” Lin Xiu said with a sigh.

Although he knew that his cultivation speed was not slow, Lin Xiu still felt that his strength was too weak compared to these people.

To take revenge in Sky City, one’s strength must be at least rank 8!

“You are fast.”

Just when Lin Xiu was thinking to himself, he felt Luo Yue’s hand.

“Are you comforting me?” Lin Xiu smiled.

Luo Yue shook her head, she was not a liar in the first place.

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue’s expression and smiled, then stretched.

“Shall we continue walking now?”

“This way, they wouldn’t go there.” Luo Yue took out the beast skin map, and pointed out.

The strength of those people just now was tyrannical, and they were not afraid of being followed by them, so if you look carefully, there are some footprints left by them on the ground in front.

Luo Yue and Lin Xiu looked at their footprints and went the other way. Even if it was a longer route, they’d rather not meet those people.

Because the strength of those people was too terrifying, the battle was basically a one-sided situation.

The two moved forward very quickly, and it didn’t take long before they realized that there were lesser tree around.

Slowly, they could see a cliff-like scene in front.

Beside the cliff, there were many warriors standing.

“How on earth do we go over!” Seeing the terrifying cracks that appeared on the ground, some warriors exclaimed.

If it was a normal gap, with the warrior’s ability to jump, he could jump over with a sprint, but the gap was really too big – it was about 10 meters.

Moreover, affected by the special magnetic field here, flying devices would directly lose their effect.

“We’ve never seen this when we came to Thunder Valley before. I wonder if it’s because a space crack appeared on the front side that caused this…”

A warrior couldn’t help but say aloud at this time.

Hearing his words, some warriors also nodded, and there was a twinkle in their eyes.

This meant that the space cracks could possibly be up ahead.

“We can just take a detour.” Some warriors frowned, and then said aloud.
