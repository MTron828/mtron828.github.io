Chapter 312: Ice Crystal Snake

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Ice Crystal Snake!

Lin Xiu used Analytic Eye and saw that the evolved beast was called the Ice Crystal Snake and was a rank 6 evolved beast!

Upon recalling how pitiful the person was, Lin Xiu did not dare get close.

All the Ice Crystal Snakes shot forward like arrows, but all the warriors that acknowledged the terror of the green liquid within them no longer dared to approach.

The warriors could only unleash sword qi and attack the ice crystal snakes from a distance.

Bang-

All the ice crystal snakes started to explode.

The pale green liquid from their bodies landed on the floor and started to set the rocks ablaze.

There were too many ice crystal snakes that soared out from the lake endlessly.

They were like dense clusters of white arrows that shot out from the lake.

‘That’s...just too many!’

Lin Xiu was standing at the rear and noticed a few ice crystal snakes flying at him!

They were shooting straight to him.

His expression changed upon noticing them and summoned a blazing bird with a wave of his hand!

Rumble-

The blazing bird collided with the ice crystal snakes and immediately exploded as though coming into contact with gasoline.

All the ice crystal snakes that charged towards Lin XIu were stopped by the blazing bird.

They exploded even before they could reach him.

Although a few warriors felt that Lin Xiu’s warrior rank was not high, they were surprised to see his unfamiliar skill.

And this fire type skill was like the bane of the ice crystal snakes. The ice crystal snakes would explode upon coming into contact with the flames.

“Brat, your skill looks good.” The middle aged man looked at him and commented.

He was infuriated before when Lin Xiu ignored him.

Lin Xiu glanced at him and continued to ignore him.

With a wave of his hand, he summoned another blazing bird that flew straight forward and burned the ice crystal snakes that shot out of the lake.

The middle aged man’s eyes revealed a hint of killing intent. When he saw Lin Xiu swing Dark Edge again, he struck at Lin Xiu with his saber!

Sou-

Lin Xiu was clearly prepared for it. Upon hearing the vacuum explosion behind him, he blocked his back with Dark Edge!

Clang-

Dark Edge’s tip collided with his saber and produced a sonorous sound along with sparks.

Lin Xiu immediately felt a powerful burst of force that caused him to feel pain.

‘What the hell, why is his strength so powerful?’

“Hmph!” The middle aged man snorted and continued to strike Lin Xiu with his saber!

Sou sou sou-

His slashes produced vacuum explosions.

His saber techniques were extremely sharp and forced Lin Xiu to be on the passive.

As expected of a rank 7 warrior, he is extremely strong.

The majority of the warriors were constantly repelling the ice crystal snakes that shot out of the lake and no one noticed their battle.

“Die for me!” The middle aged man saw how Lin Xiu was avoiding his attacks and became infuriated.

He held his saber with both hands and raised it up as he performed a downward slash!

Sou-

But Lin Xiu suddenly moved to the side as a white object shot past him, barely touching his ear!

It was obviously an ice crystal snake!

It shot straight to the middle aged man!

He had the intention of striking Lin Xiu with his saber but who would have thought that the ice crystal snake would attack him!

He had no choice but to unleash his strike prematurely, after witnessing the terror of the snake. He no longer cared about dealing with Lin Xiu at that moment.

Powerful qi came out from his body and struck the ice crystal snake, causing it to explode immediately.

The pale green liquid came out from its body and landed on the floor, melting the strange rocks and forming small holes.

Sou-

In that instant, he saw a cold aura before him.

Lin Xiu had taken the opportunity to attack him!

‘Oh crap!’

The middle aged man had forgotten about Lin Xiu’s existence while dealing with the ice crystal snake.

His pupils constricted and just as he was about to make a move, another figure appeared beside Lin Xiu.

‘Who is that!?’

Lin Xiu’s body suddenly tensed up as his focus reached a pinnacle.

He sensed the appearance of a third body and glanced over, only to see a cold glint at him!

He retracted his spear that was aimed at the middle aged man and struck towards this third party.

Clang-

A metallic collision sound was heard and Lin Xiu saw another middle aged warrior.

He held a sword and wanted to sneak an attack on Lin Xiu but did not expect Lin Xiu’s reaction to be so fast.

“Gao Yao, are you lazing too much? Why are you forced to a corner by this brat?!”

The man looked at the middle aged man and snorted coldly.

“Less bullshit, I was careless!” The middle aged man’s expression became ugly. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Without further ado, he wielded his saber and charged at Lin Xiu again!

Lin Xiu knew he had no chance of winning against two rank 7 warriors and would even have difficulty escaping!

Clang clang clang-

Lin Xiu’s speed reached its maximum as he repelled their attacks. But right at this moment, he was no longer able to resist their powerful force and he dropped straight into the lake!
