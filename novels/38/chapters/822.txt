Chapter 823: Luo Yue’s Sacrifice

Lin Xiu’s eyes and teeth were gritted at this time, resisting the severe pain in his body as he said to Luo Yue and Luo Yan.

Looking at the sky, at this moment, he could clearly see that Huang Ying was dealing with the creature he summoned.

Roar–

At this moment, the ‘devil’ had an arm that was cut off and suddenly became furious. It opened its mouth wide and a large amount of blue energy body spewed out directly toward Huang Ying.

But Huang Ying slapped those terrifying energy bodies away with his right hand.

The source strength long sword in the other hand is about to hit the body of the ‘devil’ again.

“Boy, go to hell!!!”

At the same time, those King warriors also seized the opportunity of Lin Xiu’s injury and immediately used their powerful skills to continue to attack Lin Xiu! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Get lost!”

Lin Xiu roared and the power of the source pattern on his forehead immediately appeared.

At this moment, a huge matrix covered Lin Xiu and the others.

All of their skills hit the Lin Xiu matrix.

But even so, this matrix is ??still unshakable.

“I’ll block them later, you all run away, otherwise, no one will be able to escape in the end.”

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue and Luo Yan and said.

“Luo Yue, remember...”

When Lin Xiu was about to say something to Luo Yue, he felt that his lips were kissed by Luo Yue’s lips.

Lin Xiu opened his eyes.

Before he could react, he found that a lot of white light appeared on Luo Yue’s body.

Her whole body seemed to have turned into a ball of light.

A large amount of energy is continuously transmitted into his body.

At this moment, Lin Xiu also felt a warmth coming from his body.

Looking at this scene, Luo Yan gritted her teeth, it seemed a little painful.

What exactly is going on!?

Luo Yue’s power seems to be all transmitted to his body.

No! If this goes on, Luo Yue will...

Lin Xiu, who had came to his senses, wanted to push Luo Yue away, but found that his body could not move at all.

A steady stream of power keeps entering into his body.

Letting his body continuously absorb it with the ‘Engulf’ skill.

Ding–

In the next moment, there was a crisp sound in my mind.

“Congratulations, master, you have successfully upgraded, the current level is 55!”

“Congratulations to the master for successfully advancing to the King warrior level!”

“Congratulations, Master, for obtaining a new skill ‘Sacrifice’!”

“Congratulations...”

The system prompts kept coming out in his head, but Lin Xiu had no time to take care of them.

Their lips parted.

Luo Yue’s body suddenly became weak.

Lin Xiu quickly hugged Luo Yue.

“Luo Yue!”

Lin Xiu said anxiously.

In the situation just now, it was obvious that Luo Yue used a special method to transmit the power of her body to Lin Xiu.

“I’m fine...”

Luo Yue’s face was weak and her lips were pale.

Looking at Luo Yue’s appearance at this time, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but feel a pain in his heart.

“Damn!!! You actually used the family secret method, my own power and passed it all on to this kid!?”

Luo Jiucheng saw this scene from a distance and his face changed greatly.

This is their Luo family’s unspoken method, which allows them to pass on their power to others.

And the stronger the power of the bloodline, the greater the effect.

“Die!!!”

Luo Jiucheng was extremely angry and jumped up. At this time, the long sword in his hand transformed into a huge long sword and charged directly at Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’!

Boom—

The transformed huge sword slashed on Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ and suddenly made a loud noise.

At this time, the matrix also had cracks appearing.

“I’m so tired, I want to rest.”

Luo Yue said in a weak voice, as if her eyelids were about to close.

“Lin Xiu.”

Luo Yue, who was in Lin Xiu’s arms, stretched out that cold hand on his cheek and said in a weak voice, “I... like you.”

Her memory seemed to have gone back to a long time ago, when she met Lin Xiu for the first time.

At that time, she thought this young man was hateful.

Unexpectedly, time has passed so quickly...

In the past, it seemed that every day was spent in cultivation and those memories seemed to be forgotten.

Only the days she spent with him seem to have a deep memory.

Thinking about it, a smile appeared on Luo Yue’s mouth.

It was the first time that Lin Xiu saw Luo Yue face him with a smile.

This smile was beautiful, but Lin Xiu couldn’t smile.

Instead, her eyes turned red.

Snapped–

The next moment, Luo Yue’s hand on Lin Xiu’s face drooped down weakly.

“Luo Yue!!!”

Lin Xiu let out a huge roar and the entire ground trembled instantly.

It was as if the world could feel his anger and his grief.

boom–

At the same time, the head of that gigantic ‘devil’ was directly chopped off by the long sword held tightly in Huang Ying’s hand!

Boom—

The ‘devil’ who killed an unknown number of warriors fell directly to the ground.

“Luo Yan, take care of Luo Yue.”

Lin Xiu hugged Luo Yue and said to Luo Yan.

Luo Yan’s eyes were also filled with tears and she nodded at this time.

“You all have to die!!!”

Lin Xiu released several matrices to surround Luo Yue and Luo Yan’s bodies. At this moment, the Dark Edge spear in his hand made a huge roar!

The large number of soldiers rushed over and wanted to surround Lin Xiu, but they were all blown away by this huge roar!

With a wave of his right hand, the Dark Edge spear on the ground flew directly into Lin Xiu’s hand.

Looking at Luo Jiucheng over there.

When Luo Jiucheng saw Lin Xiu’s eyes and saw himself, his body trembled.

How can there be such a terrifying look, this boy, could he have really broken through!?

Thinking of this, Luo Jiucheng became even more frightened.

Lin Xiu’s muscles swelled up and when his body moved, it seemed to move in an instant and he appeared in front of Luo Jiucheng!

Boom—

The spear pierced out with a loud noise!

Luo Jiucheng wanted to use the spear in his hand to resist, but when the spear head of the spear pierced the body of his sword, a loud noise suddenly erupted.

The terrifying power was transmitted directly to his arm through the transmission of the blade.

Boom—

In the next moment, his arm actually exploded!

“What!!!”

Luo Jiucheng let out a scream.

He never imagined that Lin Xiu’s strength would be so powerful.

‘Sphere’!

At this time, he didn’t have time to think so much, so he directly activated his ‘Sphere’!

bang bang bang-

But in the next moment, as the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was pierced, his ‘Sphere’ was instantly pierced with holes!
