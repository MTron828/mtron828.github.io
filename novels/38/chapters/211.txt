Chapter 212: Ice And Fire!

It was like entering an extremely cold place for a moment then falling into a sea of fire in the next moment.

This kind of sensation that was worlds apart made Lin Xiu feel very uncomfortable.

He felt like he was about to die!

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and continued to absorb the energy of the rank 8 Odd crystal into his body.

The cells in his body seemed to be bursting with this powerful energy.

The intense pain caused Lin Xiu to faint for a while.

At the same time, there was a strange sound not far away.

Luo Yue looked over there and there were many blood-red eyes appearing in the sewer in the area where they were at!

There was no doubt that the evolved beasts and zombies poured in from the entrance of the sewer!

Seeing this, Luo Yue frowned slightly.

Although they expected that this might happen, the number of evolved beasts and zombies was really overwhelming.

However, there wasn’t the slightest fear in Luo Yue’s eyes. At this time, she was holding the long sword in her right hand. When a few zombies rushed over like hungry tigers, the long sword slashed directly at them!

In just a short time, she managed to slash the zombies that rushed over into halves.

Lin Xiu was now in the critical moment of absorbing the energy from the rank 8 ice attribute Odd crystal. Once the energy of this ice attribute is absorbed, it could neutralize with the energy of the Red Lotus Fire in his body.

When the time comes, the Red Lotus Fire wouldn’t have side effects or influence on Lin Xiu’s body.

And the energy of the rank 8 Odd crystal was very powerful. If one absorbs everything, it was enough for a warrior to advance!

Luo Yue was still madly waving the long sword in her hand. It was as if she was moving the grass as she beheaded the evolved beasts and zombies that rushed over.

And at this moment, Rollie who was hiding in Lin Xiu’s backpack also crawled out.

Its chubby body was extremely fast and was frantically collecting the Odd crystals of the evolved beasts that were killed by Luo Yue.

More than half an hour went by, but the evolved beasts and zombies rushing over were still endless.

This made Luo Yue feel a little bit tired.

Lin Xiu closed his eyes tightly at this time, still immersed in his cultivation.

The energy of ice and fire was constantly colliding on Lin Xiu’s body. It was as if every part of Lin Xiu’s body was damaged by the collision of these two energies.

But Lin Xiu’s body recovery ability was very strong; he was recovering quickly while getting damaged.

The strength of his body was at least twice as strong as before after the restoration.

Now Lin Xiu knew why Luo Yue stuffed the Odd crystal directly into his mouth and made him swallow it.

This rank 8 Odd crystal was different from ordinary Odd crystals. The energy could only be absorbed when swallowed into the body.

A large amount of energy was released from the Odd crystal, which seemed to make Lin Xiu very uncomfortable.

The cold energy in the body and the energy left over from the Red Lotus Fire continued to collide.

A lot of sweat ran down from Lin Xiu’s forehead.

Bang bang bang——

The sound of Luo Yue’s fighting against those evolved beasts kept ringing in his ears.

About an hour went by and Luo Yue cut another zombie’s body into two. These evolved beasts and zombies that rushed into the sewer were finally all wiped out. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Luo Yue was panting slightly and she was dripping with sweat.

Taking a closer look, the number of evolved beasts and zombies killed was terrifying, they covered the entire ground.

Their blood stained the ground red.

“Tsk tsk, I finally found it.”

Luo Yue didn’t get to relax for long when she heard a sound coming from the sewer behind.

She turned and looked over there, then found a dazzling light coming from there.

“Luo Yue!?” Zhuo Qixing held a searchlight and shone it towards Luo Yue, then exclaimed in surprise.

He found this place through that special instrument but what he didn’t expect at all was that it was Luo Yue!

Why is she here, is she…

“Young Master Zhuo, over there!” Luo Xiaoqi noticed someone sitting over there with his skin turning red and white, looking very strange.

Zhuo Qixing looked at Lin Xiu’s body and found this quite shocking.

He looked at the instrument in his hand; there was no doubt that the rank 8 Odd crystal was right there with Lin Xiu.

“DIdn’t expect that you guys were the one who seized the rank 8 Odd crystal away.” Zhuo Qixing laughed at this moment.

He could see that Luo Yue was now obviously weakened because of the fight just now.

And Lin Xiu appeared to be in a weird condition. But he was certain that Lin Xiu definitely didn’t have any fighting power.

Then this rank 8 Odd crystal would definitely go in his pocket!

“If there is nothing else, you can leave.” Luo Yue said faintly as she watched them.

There was still a lot of blood on the long sword in her hand, sliding down the tip of the sword to the ground.

“No, no, I can’t go now.” Zhuo Qixing shook his head and said.

“The rank 8 Odd crystal, I want it.” Zhuo Qixing said while looking at Luo Yue.

He sounded like he wasn’t going to take no for an answer.

Luo Yue did not speak, the long sword that was trickling with blood in her hand was already pointing at Zhuo Qixing.

Her action reflected her attitude.

“Young Master Zhuo, this girl deserves a beating!” A guy spat out at this moment.

The matter of Luo Yue changing classes previously made them a little bit annoyed. At this moment, her attitude made them even more unhappy.

“Shut up!!!” Hearing their words, Zhuo Qixing glanced at them and said coldly.

“She is from the Luo family.”

‘Luo family?’

Luo Xiaoqi and the others were taken aback when they heard Zhuo Qixing’s words and their expressions changed like they recalled something.

There were relatively few large families with the surname Luo, which meant that it was that…

With that thought, they felt a chill down their spine.

That family was not a family that ordinary people dare to provoke!

“Luo Yue, our ancestors can be regarded as family friends, get him to hand over the rank 8 Odd crystal, and the matter will be over.” Zhuo Qixing said in a deep voice at this time.

He must have this rank 8 Odd crystal today no matter what!

Luo Yue did not answer his words, and at this moment walked towards Zhuo Qixing step by step.

When Luo Xiaoqi and the others didn’t understand Luo Yue’s movements, when Luo Yue approached Zhuo Qixing, he had already swung his sword directly at Zhuo Qixing’s body!
