1220 Gravel-like Source Strength

The warriors from Changqing City and Shachang City, except for Liu Qinglan and Sha Lin, were all warriors at the Sage warrior level.

There were seventy or eighty people in total.

At this time, all of them were attacking Lin Xiu.

As Lin Xiu swept out, the bodies of the warriors who rushed forward were all cut in half!

bang bang bang-

Blood splashed all over the ground in an instant!

“Humph!”

At this time, Baili Haoling also waved the two swords in her hands and attacked these warriors frantically!

Baili Haoling’s speed was too fast and her swords danced as a large number of stumps and broken arms were scattered all over the ground.

Incredibly bloody.

“These two guys…”

Seeing this scene, Liu Qinglan’s body trembled slightly.

The warriors he brought, no matter how bad they were, they were all warriors at the level of Sage warrior.

But they never imagined that they would be so easily dealt with by Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling.

Seeing that these warriors were about to slaughter them all, Sha Lin took the lead.

“‘Rock Blast’!!!”

Sha Ling waved his hands and suddenly roared.

At this moment, the surrounding rock buildings burst apart in an instant, then charged towards Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling!

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly when he looked at the huge rocks that were charging from the surroundings.

The long spear in his hand is about to bombard these rocks that are coming over!

The long spear slashed across and slammed into the impacted rocks, but found that there was no way to blast those rocks!

Instead, he was hit by those rocks.

“Hahaha, with this little power, you still want to resist my power!”

Sha Lin laughed out loud when he saw Lin Xiu who was instantly hit by a large number of rocks.

“Lin Xiu!”

Seeing this scene, the pupils in Baili Haoling’s eyes also shrank slightly.

Instinctively, she wanted to help Lin Xiu, but out of the corner of her eye, she saw that there were rocks rushing towards her from the side!

There was no way, at this time, Baili Haoling could only dodge.

Boom—

The rock smashed into the position where Baili Haoling was just now and made a loud noise.

“Humph!”

Seeing that Baili Haoling actually dodged, Sha Lin suddenly let out a cold snort.

“Sha Lin, I didn’t expect you to have this trick huh.”

Liu Qinglan, who was standing on the fence over there, looked at the pile of rocks with a smile.

Lin Xiu was hit by these rocks just now and even if he wasn’t dead, he would be seriously injured.

“This kid actually thought he could shatter those rocks.”

Sha Lin also showed a contemptuous smile at this time.

His skills can control those rocks and there were also powerful source strength on the rocks. It is a joke to want to use weapons to smash these rocks that are rushing over at high speed.

At this time, Baili Haoling’s eyes widened, looking at the pile of rocks, her eyes were full of disbelief.

Lin Xiu… Lin Xiu wouldn’t…

boom boom boom —

Just when Baili Haoling was thinking about it, a loud noise sounded and at this moment, all these rocks flew out.

“Tsk tsk, your skills are quite interesting.”

Lin Xiu’s figure appeared in an instant.

“Lin Xiu, are you all right?”

When Baili Haoling saw this scene, she immediately turned from worry to joy.

“Do you think that just these broken stones can kill me?”

Lin Xiu spread his hands helplessly and said.

As for Liu Qinglan and Sha Lin, who were still proud, their faces suddenly sank at this time.

Lin Xiu was actually unscathed!

“Sha Lin! Kill him!”

Although Liu Qinglan was not too young, her previous life was spent in dandy, she didn’t encounter such a situation before.

In desperation, he yelled at Shalin.

“shut up!”

Shalin’s face was also extremely ugly.

“New city lord, what happened before is my fault, how about this matter stop now?”

Shalin said in a deep voice at this time.

There is no other way, now he has a faint sense of Lin Xiu’s strength and he is not able to deal with it.

And Lin Xiu is so strong, it is impossible for him to intimidate him.

“you…”

Liu Qinglan never thought that Sha Lin would not fight back!

“Do you think it’s possible?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

There was a little murderous intent in his eyes.

Sha Lin and Liu Qinglan were both God warriors and he could gain a lot of experience by killing them.

They were delivered to his door, why wouldn’t he want it?

“Are you going to fight against our Shachang City?”

Sha Lin continued to speak.

“You’re talking too much nonsense.”

Listening to his nonsense, Lin Xiu became a little impatient.

Who cares about who he is from Shachang City or Changqing City, if he dares to make trouble, then he will kill them all first!

‘Flashing Souls’!

As soon as his thoughts were triggered, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared in front of Shalin in an instant as Lin Xiu’s body technique was displayed!

What a fast speed!

When Sha Lin saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

And at this moment, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was about to stab him in the head!

If nothing goes wrong, his head would be directly stabbed and exploded by Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear!

boom–

But when the tip of Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear pierced his forehead, he found that there was no way to penetrate his head at all!

Taking a closer look, Sha Lin’s entire body seemed to be covered with some sand on the surface.

It was these sand-like substances that blocked Lin Xiu’s attack.

This is not ordinary sand, but his source strength, forming this sand-like substance.

At this moment, Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand, without the slightest hesitation, he continued to stab at his body!

bang bang bang-

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!

In this short moment, Lin Xiu didn’t know how many spears he had stabbed on his body, but it still had no effect!

And at this time, the source strength of Shalin’s whole body poured out. The source strength was like quicksand and they looked very strange.

Lin Xiu frowned and jumped to the back subconsciously.

And Shalin was still standing in the same place, the source strength on his body was continuously released like a flood, forming a large amount of grit-like substance.

It was the first time that Lin Xiu had seen such a strange situation.

“Why is this guy’s source strength like this?”

Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu who had retreated and there was a look of surprise in her eyes.

“I don’t know either, but be careful.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

The source strength of this Sha Lin was really weird and it seems to have a very strong defensive ability.

“die!!!”

And at this moment, Sha Lin let out a roar.
