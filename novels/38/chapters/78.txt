Chapter 79: Departure!

“But, where is Sacred Region Academy located at?” Lin Xiu asked curiously.

Lin Xiu had tried to look it up previously but did not obtain any information regarding the general location of Sacred Region Academy.

And now, the admission notice only wrote a few words but did not mention the location at all.

“Just walk to the end of the Path of Death and there will be someone there to receive you.” Mr. Ye stroked his beard and replied indifferently.

“Path of Death?!” Luo Li’s face changed when he heard that name.

Path of Death did not indicate a real path, but a region.

It was located in the south that led to the sea. It used to have many zombies and the strongest beast, a rank 10 evolved beast.

It used to be hailed as the most dangerous location on the planet.

It posed a huge threat to the survival of the human race, but ultimately became safer after the rank 10 evolved beast as well as many high-rank evolved beasts were killed by the top 10 warriors of the world rankings.

Although the danger level had dropped, it still remained one of the most dangerous locations due to a large number of zombies.

“Why, you don’t dare to?” Mr. Ye looked at Lin Xiu’s quiet response and chuckled.

“No.” Lin Xiu shook his head and smiled, revealing a set of white teeth.

“I am just slightly excited.”

Path of Death, what was there to be afraid of? The more the zombies and evolved beasts, the more the experience points for him.

It was simply a source of profit that had been sent to his doorstep.

“Very good.” Mr. Ye nodded his head and continued, “As you have now become a special student of Sacred Region Academy, you no longer need to attend classes in Xing Yao Academy.”

“What do you plan to do next?”

“Qualify and get the warrior qualifications before reporting to school.” Lin Xiu looked straight at Mr. Ye and replied.

Mr. Ye was very powerful and Lin Xiu was clearly able to sense that his aura seemed to be completely reserved and made him feel like an ordinary person.

But ever since he revealed his ability to use Sphere, a source strength skill, he was definitely a powerful high-rank warrior.

“Indeed, gaining the warrior certificate will do you well in the future.” Mr. Ye nodded his head. He looked at the time and bade farewell to them.

“Lin Xiu, congratulations.” Luo Li looked at Lin Xiu and said.

He could not help but feel emotionally moved, Lin Xiu have had a heaven toppling transformation within two short months.

Ever since he became a teacher, he had never heard of someone from Xing Yao Academy being enrolled into Sacred Region Academy.

“Thank you teacher for taking care of me all this time.” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Li and thanked him earnestly.

In fact, Teacher Luo Li had treated Lin Xiu well even before he had transmigrated.

He was considered a truly good teacher.

Luo Li laughed, patted Lin Xiu on the shoulders, and did not say a word.

It was still early and the warrior certificate tests were about to begin, so Lin Xiu decided to head over.

He returned to his room, packed a few things into a black bag, and prepared to leave.

He stood outside the gates of Xing Yao Academy and felt slightly reluctant.

After all, he had made a life and lived here for a while. He was somewhat melancholic.

“Lin Xiu!” Just then, voices could be heard from behind. Lin Xiu turned and saw Yang Tian, as well as Zhang Yi, running over.

“Gosh, that was tiring.” Yang Tian seemed to have run all the way here and was gasping for breath.

He wiped away the perspiration and punched Lin Xiu on the shoulders.

“You lack the spirit of loyalty man, how can you leave without saying a word?”

Lin Xiu laughed but did not reply.

“Heard that you’re going to some Sacred Region Academy?” T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Zhang Yi was still wrapped in bandages around some parts of his body. He was severely injured and had yet to fully recover even after staying inside the pod.

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“This stupid school, such a fraud. It was Tang Tian that exploded himself that day and it even affected you.” Yang Tian ground his teeth.

The news of Lin Xiu being expelled had spread across the school and shocked many people.

But the students did not dare say anything since the biggest sponsor of the school was the Tang Family.

“It’s alright. It’s good this way as well, I’m heading to get my warrior qualifications.”

Lin Xiu laughed. So what if he was expelled? Since there would be nothing to do if he stayed another year, it was good for him as well.

“You’re already a rank 2 warrior?” Although Zhang Yi had guessed it, getting the confirmation from Lin Xiu still surprised him.

Lin Xiu had grown so fast that it surprised him.

Lin Xiu did not refute, his strength was not only at rank 2 now. After unlocking the Gene Lock, just his pure body strength had reached the rank 3 standard, but as he had yet to gain cultivation techniques, his overall combat strength was not at the rank 3 standard yet.

“I’m heading off, take care.” Lin Xiu took a deep breath and bade farewell to Yang Tian and Zhang Yi.

“Take care.” Zhang YI and Yang Tian looked at each other before replying to Lin Xiu solemnly.

Lin Xiu nodded his head and activated the android wolf. He carried his bag and jumped up onto its back.

Crack crack-

After a series of sour metal clanks, the android wolf’s gears started to move.

They both looked ahead and charged away.

To the south!

The android wolf was extremely fast and its maximum speed was not inferior to an average car.

People who saw the android wolf on the road were shocked.

After an hour, Lin Xiu arrived at the edge of Xing Yao City. Upon leaving the edge, the scenery would be completely different from Xing Yao’s flourishing life.

It quickly became the countryside and the trees and vegetation changed. The entire scenery changed and turned to a forest.

Everyone that left Xing Yao City to other cities would never choose to move in this direction.

No one knew what powerful evolved beast might attack inside the forest.

“One-star medal? Hmph, even Xing Yao City’s master cannot save you!”

At this moment, Tang Mubai looked at the report from his subordinate pertaining to Lin Xiu’s departure and revealed a sinister smile.

He had pinned all of Tang Tian’s death onto Lin Xiu.

When he saw that Lin Xiu did not take a plane out but chose to leave Xing Yao City by himself, he became ecstatic.

‘Even heaven is helping me, no one will ever know if he dies in the wild!’
