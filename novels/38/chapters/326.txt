Chapter 327: Luo Yue’s Enemy Appears

Lin Xiu’s expression changed when he heard this voice, then stood up and looked at the other side.

As he looked at this scene, the look in his eyes changed.

Because Lin Xiu saw that up ahead, there appeared to be some warriors coming over.

There were so many of them which made Lin Xiu frown.

Luo Yue also noticed this and at this moment, she froze and followed Lin Xiu’s gaze.

In a short while, a few warriors appeared.

These warriors wore battle suits and looked very well-equipped. As soon as the Analytic Eye was activated, Lin Xiu found out that these warriors were all rank 6 and rank 7 warriors.

“Your enemy?” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue and asked.

“No, they are too weak.” Luo Yue said, shaking her head.

“Boy, are you also looking for Ice Lotus Fire?” A warrior looked at Lin Xiu and snorted coldly.

Hearing their words, Lin Xiu’s expression remained unchanged and he replied indifferently, “What do you think?”

“Watch the way you talk!” When a warrior heard Lin Xiu’s ‘arrogant’ tone, his expression suddenly changed and he exclaimed loudly.

The eyes of the other warriors turned towards Lin Xiu as their hands clenched their weapons, their eyes were full of killing intent.

“If there’s nothing else, you guys may take your leave.” Lin Xiu waved and said.

When they heard Lin Xiu’s words, their expressions suddenly changed.

A warrior was a little angry at this time and rushed to Lin Xiu!

With a huge axe in his hand, he slashed directly at Lin Xiu like he wanted to chop Lin Xiu’s body in half!

Bang-——

But what he didn’t expect was that at this moment, Lin Xiu easily dodged the attack!

The look in his eyes suddenly changed, then in the next moment, he waved the giant axe in his hand again towards Lin Xiu!

Dang–

But at this moment, a long sword stabbed out from Lin Xiu’s side and hit the big axe directly!

A loud noise rang out.

The warrior lost his grip of the giant axe due to the powerful force and it fell to the ground.

“You…” The man’s eyes widened in disbelief.

Looking up, he saw Luo Yue standing next to Lin Xiu.

Luo Yue held a long sword in her hand, looked at this man with cold eyes, then glanced at the warriors behind him and said coldly, “Stay if you want to die.”

The man who was holding the battle axe heard Luo Yue’s words and although they were extremely arrogant, he had to admit that the cold air around this girl made him tremble.

“Courting death!”

Those warriors who were at the back were pissed off by these two people and they roared loudly. Then, they wanted to charged towards Lin Xiu!

They wanted to get rid of both Lin Xiu and Luo Yue directly!

Luo Yue looked at the people who were about to charge over and did not move at all.

But at the next moment, Luo Yue seemed to sense something. Her eyes widened and her pupils constricted suddenly.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Xiu, who was standing next to Luo Yue, clearly felt something odd about Luo Yue and asked.

“She’s here.” Luo Yue clenched the long sword in her hand tightly and even looked a little frightened.

‘She’s here!?’

‘Who!?’

Lin Xiu was a little confused when he suddenly felt a gust of wind.

Those warriorws who wanted to charge towards Lin Xiu and Luo Yue to kill them were also taken aback by the sudden wind.

They stopped in their tracks, then turned around and saw a figure approaching.

“Who is it!?”

A man att he back saw this scene and his expression changed as he called out.

As soon as he said that, a cut suddenly appeared on his neck.

“You…”

His eyes widened and in the next moment, his head fell off directly and blood sprayed all over the ground.

When the other warriors saw this scene, they eyes widened and their bodies trembled.

They looked at this scene in disbelief – it was really terrifying. The man who was alive and kicking a moment ago simply died so tragically!?

Lin Xiu witnessed this and the pupils in his eyes constricted.

‘What exactly is going on!?’

“Didn’t expect that you actually dared to come here.”

A voice that sounded a little sinister came from the other side.

Lin Xiu stared ahead and soon saw a tall figure.

This was a woman, a woman who seemed very charming.

The weapons in her hands were also very weird – they were rarely seen and were a pair of double rings.

“Who are you!!!” These warriors looked at the woman who was slowly approaching. Although they were still trembling, they still roared loudly while staring at the woman.

“One second, otherwise, you’re all dead.” The woman looked at the man and said with a weird smile.

“Courting death!” This man was a rank 7 warrior. Hearing this woman’s words, his body trembled even harder.

He clenched the saber in his hand and rushed directly to the woman!

Swish——

He was very fast and he appeared directly in front of the woman, holding a saber in both hands and slashing down on the woman’s body!

“Asking for it.” The woman lifted her right hand that was holding the ring and that weapon knocked against the man’s saber, lettin gout a dull sound.

Bang– Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

At this moment, this man’s weapon was directly hit by her spiked ring and it was broken!

How is this possible!

The man’s eyes were full of shock and he was in complete disbelief at this time.

Swish——

Just then, the man saw a cold light flashing in front of him. Before he could even use the ‘sphere’, he felt a sharp pain in his neck.

His eyes widened then in the next instant, his body fell directly to the ground.

“The rest of you still want to give it a go?”
