Chapter 241: Hiding Your Strength?

He looked at the small bottle in his hand and opened it without hesitation.

When he opened the bottle, he immediately saw the clear liquid within.

An extremely small and translucent worm crawled out from the bottle.

It then crawled on Yu Yi’s arm.

This thing then dug into his arm.

The sudden pain caused him to frown.

As the worm went deeper, Yu Yi’s expression became weird.

Although no one saw his actions, Ouyang Hang had been paying attention to him. He saw what had transpired and smirked.

Amian worm, a worm that they had discovered on an alien planet.

Aside from being able to live inside a body, it could survive inside the unique liquid.

Upon contact with a human body, it would dig into the body and move about while emitting a strange energy capable of increasing the adrenal gland hormones crazily.

If used on a warrior’s body, it would incite the warrior with an extremely large burst of power.

It was even better than the forbidden medicine.

And the liquid that the amian worm could thrive in also had compositions of forbidden medicine.

It further increased the intensity of the burst of power.

Lin Xiu did not realize his movements. At this moment, he swung his spear and the flames in the sky turned into large fireballs and flew towards Yu Yi!

Rumble rumble-

The large fireballs that resembled meteors were about to fall on Yu Yi!

“Be careful!!!”

All the students exclaimed in horror.

The terrifying meteors had scared the spectators.

They even evacuated to a further location to avoid the attack.

“That flame is too terrifying.” Likewise, Zhang Yin was retreating as the fireball landed on the ground nearby.

A large black pit immediately formed with white smoke coming out.

Zhang Yin’s clothes were completely drenched due to the high heat from the flames.

Bang bang bang-

After avoiding the aftermath of the flames, the students looked over at the arena and saw many fireballs smashing towards Yu Yi.

Rumble rumble-

As the fireballs smashed onto the stage, it unleashed loud explosions that shook the entire place.

“Whew.”

Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief after unleashing the skill, he could feel the great depletion of energy.

The flames that he had unleashed were no ordinary flames but the Red Lotus Fire.

Although he had yet to completely grasp the use of it, the might of the skill was extremely powerful.

“Although you’re strong, it is impossible for Yu Yi to lose.” Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu and snorted.

Flames pervaded the entire arena after smashing down onto Yu Yi.

Yu Yi stood in his original position and looked as though he was engulfed in a sea of fire.

All the spectators heaved a sigh of relief once all the fireballs had dropped.

They were close to being affected. Very few people would be able to block the flames.

After all, not everyone was rank 5 or rank 6 warriors.

“Yu Yi seems…fine?” Li Ping looked at the stage as the flames gradually died down. He saw a figure within and rubbed his own eyes and asked.

Once his words were out, everyone turned to look at Yu Yi.

As expected, Yu Yi stood in his original place.

His hair was charred and his face was black with soot. He looked to be in a difficult situation but not severely injured.

“That’s all?” As the flames dissipated, Yu YI walked out and looked at Lin Xiu indifferently. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He seemed to have grown even sturdier.

He wiped away the black soot on his face and glanced over at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted when he saw Yu Yi.

‘How is that possible, how did he only suffer from light injuries?!’

Lin Xiu was confused.

He had initially guessed that Yu Yi would use Sphere to block the attack.

But the sphere would most probably block half of the flames and Yu Yi would be struck once the sphere was dissolved.

And he was sure that Yu YI would be smashed by the fireballs. But who would have thought that Yu Yi was completely fine!

‘How is that possible!’

“It’s my turn now.” Yu Yi moved his body and crack sounds were heard immediately.

It was as though all the bones in his body had exploding beans in them.

The instant he moved, his entire being had flown right to the other side and immediately picked up the sword that he had dropped.

Without any hesitation, he continued to charge at Lin Xiu!

Sou-

His sword produced a sonorous sound.

He could feel that the power in his body had swelled to an astronomical level.

And with the rapid increase of adrenal gland hormones, he was filled with fighting intent.

Clank-

Lin Xiu looked at the incoming sword and tightened his grip on Dark Edge. He swung the spear and blocked the attack.

“Only that?” Yu Yi snorted and continued to brandish his sword at Lin Xiu.

“You’re only so so too.” Lin Xiu sneered and retaliated with attacks of his own.

Yu Yi had grown much stronger, but Lin Xiu was also extremely strong under Fury’s effects. Matched with Overlord Spear Art, he was not on the losing end against Yu Yi!

“Damn it!!!!” Yu Yi’s eyes widened as he roared out loud and performed a thrust at Lin Xiu!
