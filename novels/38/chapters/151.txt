Chapter 152: Protection Fees

“This year’s freshman is very arrogant eh.” Another man walked over slowly at this moment, stood across Lin Xiu, and looked at him. Then, he continued, “Let me tell you, I am Cheng Yu in the second grade. As a gift for our first meeting, transfer 10,000 points to me first.”

“We saw that you still have more than 20,000 points left.” Chai Jiuming and another man also walked over at this time and stood beside Lin Xiu, surrounding him.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes at this time.

It seems that no matter where he went, there would always be such people appearing.

All three of them were rank 4 warriors.

This kind of strength was indeed extremely powerful outside, but at the Sacred Region Academy, these second-year students should be almost at the bottom of the level.

“Are you guys threatening me?” Lin Xiu wasn’t mad and smiled instead.

“No, no, no, how could we do that? We’re just charging a ‘protection’ fee, after all, as a freshman, you would definitely be bullied by others, so let us, the seniors, protect you.” Cheng Yu said with a smile.

“What if I say no, then.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

At this moment, the muscles in his whole body have already tensed up.

“Then we can only… teach you a lesson first!” Chai Jiuming snorted and his fingers went towards Lin Xiu’s body at an extremely fast speed!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted slightly and moved slightly, avoided Chai Jiuming’s scratch.

In the next moment, Lin Xiu grabbed his arm with the ‘Fire Claws’ skill directly!

Tear——

Three burn marks appeared on the clothes on his arm.

There was also a sharp pain on his arm.

“Courting death!!!” Chai Jiuming was furious – a freshman dared to resist him!?

Cheng Yu and another guy reacted and directly attacked Lin Xiu.

Their hands and feet movements were so unusual and Lin Xiu didn’t dare to face them head-on at this moment yet and kept dodging.

With the speed brought by the body skill, ‘Without a Trace’, coupled with Lin Xiu’s already extremely strong reaction ability, they simply couldn’t attack Lin Xiu!

How could it be!?

There was a look of horror in the eyes of these three people. He was only a rank 3 warrior yet they couldn’t even touch the edge of his clothing!?

‘Serial Kick’!

When Cheng Yu swept his leg over, Lin Xiu jumped, and while avoiding the attack, Lin Xiu hit him in the chest and sent him flying!

Bang——

With a dull sound, his body hit the ground not far away, and he rolled several times, then plunged directly into the bushes behind.

“[Divine Ray Fist]!!!” Chai Jiuming was enraged at this moment, his eyes were full of killing intent.

If others found out that a second-year student was suppressed by a freshman, he would lose so much ‘face’.

Only by beating Lin Xiu up till he was half dead could he wash away his shame!!!

‘Divine Ray Fist’ was a Gold skill. At this moment, following his punch, a light flashed from his fist and directly penetrated into Lin Xiu’s eyes.

Bang——

Due to

the light from this skill and the fact that Lin Xiu had just blocked another man’s attack, he didn’t have time to react and was hit by this blow!

This punch hit Lin Xiu’s chest, and a huge force came, causing Lin Xiu’s body to fly directly to the back.

Lin Xiu desperately stabilized his body, so he didn’t fall to the ground.

But he still felt a lot of pain in the chest and there was a taste of sweetness in his throat before he threw up a mouthful of fresh blood.

“Hng, kid, you refused a toast only to drink a forfeit, huh.” Chai Jiuming was very satisfied with his punch. At this moment, he stared at Lin Xiu and said with a huff.

“I merely asked for 10,000 points. Now, hand over all your points. Otherwise, you can only crawl back tonight.” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Another man pulled Cheng Yu out, who was kicked into the bush by Lin Xiu.

He was, after all, a rank 4 warrior, so he recovered quickly. He was glaring at Lin Xiu, full of anger.

Lin Xiu’s eyes became cold at this time.

He wiped the blood from his mouth, twisted his body, and there were sounds of his joints cracking.

“What’s the hurry, it’s just beginning.” Lin Xiu just said that when force burst forth from his legs and he flew out like a bullet!

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu’s speed was so fast that he didn’t even touch the ground!

What a speed! Chai Jiuming was startled, then he saw Lin Xiu leaping up abruptly, about to hit him with a fist!

“Courting death!”

Chai Jiuming snorted coldly. Fighting with his fist against him? His Divine Ray Fist was a top-ranking skill, how could he lose to a freshman!

At this moment, he dodged abruptly and slammed Lin Xiu’s fist with his fist!

Just like before, his fist has a dazzling white glow, but Lin Xiu already knew his trick this time and his vision would no longer be affected by his white light.

Following Lin Xiu’s fist hitting Chai Jiuming from the air, his glove glowed red instantly, as if it had turned into a red moon.

Bang——

Two fists collided and Chai Jiuming’s eyes instantly widened.

A huge force made his entire fist hurt so much!

What happened!?

Click, click, click——

In the next second, there seemed to be bursts of bone-cracking sound in his right arm.

Snapped——

“Ah!!!” A huge force made him take several steps back and at this moment, the bones in his entire arm were broken!

Comminuted fracture!!!

“Jiu Ming!!!” The other two men who saw this scene were shocked.

Ordinary rank 4 warriors wouldn’t dare to fight head-on against Chai Jiuming’s ‘Divine Ray Fist’, how could he be beaten like this by a freshman?

Cheng Yu walked over and saw that the bones of Chai Jiuming’s right arm seemed like they had exploded. There were some broken bones that pierced through his skin and were exposed, it was shocking.

“Hurry up and take him to the treatment room!” Another man hurriedly said.

The bones appeared to be shattered and if an operation was not done in time, he would probably have to use artificial bones in the future.

Although artificial bones could replace normal bones, they lose their growth. This was the most terrible thing for warriors.

Just when they wanted to send Chai Jiuming to the treatment room, Lin Xiu blocked them.

“What do you mean by this!?” Cheng Yu said angrily when he saw Lin Xiu standing in front of him and the others.

“Do you think this is the end of the matter?”
