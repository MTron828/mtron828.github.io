Chapter 687 Luo Yue Finally Awake

“Why? Is there a problem?”

Lin Xiu looked at him and smiled as he asked.

“No….. no problem at all.”

When Mr Jiang heard what Lin Xiu asked, his body trembled.

Lin Xiu had just killed so many of these warriors. He was a terrifying person. If Lin Xiu became unhappy and decided to kill him… As he thought about it, he couldn’t help but shiver.

“That’s right. I thought of it now!”

Lei Chong seemed to have thought of something before saying out loud. “Lin Xiu! You’re Lin Xiu! Am I right?” He thought of how just a few weeks ago, the entire Sky City were rummaging to look for a man known as Lin Xiu.

Isn’t Lin Xiu the man standing right in front of him?

“That’s me.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“No wonder. The champion of the Warrior Competition. You are amazing!”

Lei Chong exclaimed as if he had figured out something special.

Since that battle was one that caught everyone’s attention, he was watching it live as well.

As he thought about it, the skills that Lin Xiu had used were exactly the same as those that he saw!

“Will we be in trouble?”

Lin Xiu looked at the bodies on the ground and asked Chen Lan and his men.

A group of them had died because of him and Lin Xiu did feel bad about it.

If there were still anyone left, Lin Xiu didn’t mind clearing out their entire gang.

“I don’t think so. All of their leaders and men are here.”

Chen Lan took a good look at the bodies on the ground before answering.

“En.”

“Mr Jiang, could you get someone to get rid of the bodies?”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and asked Mr Jiang.

“Of course.”

Mr Jiang nodded his head and got some of his staff to get rid of the body.

“As for these…”

He looked at the laser guns and weapons that were all on the ground and hesitated as he asked Lin Xiu.

“You can keep them.”

Lin Xiu then continued.

“Give them to your guards at the bar.”

“Thank you, thank you.”

Mr Jiang quickly thanked him and there was a joyous look in his eyes.

All of these weapons including the laser guns and combat suits were good stuff! They would cost a bomb!

“Do you have a place for us to rest?”

Lin Xiu asked Chen Lan.

“Of course. Mr Jiang has a small motel nearby.”

Chen Lan smiled.

“That’s right. I can arrange them for you. If you’re tired, you should take a rest first.”

Mr Jiang smiled as he offered to help.

Soon, Lin Xiu and Lei Chong stayed at a nearby motel.

The rooms were small but it had everything that they needed.

Lin Xiu stood by the window and looked at both the bright moons. His thoughts were already somewhere else.

“Lin….Xiu.”

On the other side of the planet, there was a beautiful exquisite looking young girl who gently moved her lips before opening her eyes.

“You’re awake!”

As soon as she opened her eyes, another young woman next to her screamed with joy. “Luo Yan?”

The young girl on the bed called out as she saw the young woman before her eyes. “You should be calling me big sister!”

Luo Yan glared at the young woman who was still lying in bed.

“You! You’re already in this state and you’re still calling for him.”

Luo Yan sounded a little jealous but her eyes were gentle when she knew that her younger sister was finally awake. “She’s awake?”

At the same time, there was a middle aged woman dressed in white that walked into the room.

“En. She just woke up.”

Luo Yan looked at the woman and nodded her head.

This was the best doctor that they had in Fengyun City and she was the one who cured Luo Yue’s heart injuries.

“Her heart is still weak now. She shouldn’t be troubled. In order for her to completely get better, it should take about a month.”

The middle aged woman said to Luo Yue who was lying on the bed.

“Alright. Thank you.”

Luo Yan answered respectfully.

This was because not only was this woman’s medical skills one of the best, Luo Yan could feel that she was an incredibly powerful warrior as well.

Luo Yan could feel that even if it was their father, a rank 9 warrior, wouldn’t be able to defeat her.

The warriors on this planet were much stronger than those back on earth!

“I shall let them know.”

The middle aged woman took another look at Luo Yan before walking out. “Where…. Am I?”

Luo Yue sat up with difficulty as she took a good look around her. She seemed to be inside a hospital ward but she was also surrounded by a lot of machines that she had never seen before. She also noticed that there was something peculiar about the energy here.

“You just finished a major surgery. Stop moving.”

When Luo Yan saw her trying to get up, she quickly took a pillow and placed it behind Luo Yue’s back for her to rest on.

“This….is Marqi planet.”

Luo Yan hesitated for a moment before saying.

“Marqi Planet?!”

Luo Yue was shocked by the answer and she was confused as well.

“En. It’s because when you were hit by the laser beam, it went through your heart. With the skills back on earth, they wouldn’t be able to fit you and would have to change it for an artificial one.”

“If we changed it into an artificial one, your warrior skills would be limited which was why we had no other choice. Father was the one who told me to bring you here.”

“This …..is also part of the Luo family.” As Luo Yan explained, she paused. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“He…”

Although Luo Yue was still confused with how this was the Luo family, she was suddenly reminded by the incident that happened earlier and she asked subconsciously.

“You’re talking about that brat, Lin Xiu?”

“After you were hit, that boy went crazy. He killed most of the warriors from both families and even killed the rank 9 warriors of the Zhuo and Jiang family.”

“The entire Sky City is hunting for him.”

Luo Yan said helplessly.

She didn’t think that Lin Xiu’s powers could get to such a high level.

They were rank 9 warriors!

“I have to go back.”

Luo Yue frowed as she spoke.

“No way. You have to stay here until you’ve fully recovered. That boy is like an undefeatable cockroach. He wouldn’t die so easily. Don’t worry about him.” “But…” Luo Yue wanted to say more but Luo Yan had already got her to lie down on the bed so she could rest.

“Stop talking. I already texted him and told him that we’re here. If he had the abilities, we would be able to see him here.”

Luo Yan smiled but she didn’t really think that he would appear in this part ofthe world. This was the main city in Marqi Planet, Fengyun City!
