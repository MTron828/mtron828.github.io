Chapter 729 Ice and Snow City

“Rank 9.”

Luo Yue said to Luo Yan as if it was something normal.

“Rank 9?! That’s fast!”

After hearing Luo Yue’s answer, Luo Yan was shocked.

“The energy here is thick.”

Luo Yue said calmly.

When she woke up, Luo Yue could clearly feel that the energy inside her body was much thicker than before.

If her assumption was right, these energies were only here after she was recused.

Plus, the air on this planet was filled with energy. They were much more dense than the ones back on earth.

“But rank 9….it’s something normal on this planet…”

As Luo yue mumbled to herself, she felt helpless.

This planet had the strongest warriors. With her current strength, it was only the beginning on the Marquis planet.

The difference between the two planets was too much. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“I never expected my father to be someone from this family.”

“When would we be able to leave?”

Just when Luo Yan was feeling emotional, Luo Yue asked the question that she always wanted to know.

Luo Yan paused for a moment when she heard Luo Yue’s question before giving her a bitter smile, “I want to return home as well but the spaceship heading back to earth has been attacked by a galactic criminal. It’s completely destroyed now.”

“That’s what the guy is saying. We don’t know if it’s true.”

Luo Yue frowned her beautiful brows as she looked into the sky, deep in thought.

“What’s wrong? Are you missing that lover of yours?”

Luo Yan rolled her eyes before teasing her sister.

“Shut up.”

Luo Yue was embarrassed as well and glared at Luo Yan.

“We don’t even know if the fella would be

here.”

Luo Yan thought of something and mumbled to herself.

“What did you say?”

“Nothing. Those from the Luo family want us to attend the Xuan Feng Academy.”

Luo Yan smiled.

On the other side of the planet, Lin Xiu was still walking across the snow filled land.

There were snowflakes falling on them continuously.

“It’s been so long and we’re not there yet…”

The snow around them was soft and it was extremely easy for their legs to sink into it, making it extremely difficult for them to walk.

Plus, it seemed like they were still very far from the Ice and Snow City.

After walking for an entire day and night, they still haven’t arrived.

“Damn it. How did those people reach the city?”

Qian Jing couldn’t help but complain.

Most of them weren’t dressed appropriately for the weather. It was still warm in the other city and even if they were rank 9 warriors, they would still feel cold.

Especially when they have been under such extreme situations for such a long time.

However, the thing that surprised Qian Jing was that Lin Xiu seemed fine. He was still walking slowly as if the chills around them didn’t exist. “Aren’t you cold?”

Qian Jing asked.

“It’s alright?”

As he was walking, Lin Xiu was thinking about something when he suddenly heard Qian Jing talking to him.

When the other warriors heard Lin Xiu, they were about to curse at him.

They were already frozen to the core but Lin Xiu was saying that he’s alright.

“The earth wouldn’t have such weather, right?” Qian Jing had to ask Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu smiled and said nothing.

Lin Xiu had just gotten the warrior skills that the King Warrior left behind. Along with the Frozen Heart, the chill around him was nothing and Lin Xiu couldn’t really feel it as well.

Even if he wasn’t dressed, he wouldn’t feel cold.

After walking for sometime, they finally saw the huge doors of the Ice and Snow City slowly appearing right in front of them.

“We’re here!”

Some of the warriors who had good visibility screamed in happiness.

“We’re finally here in Ice and Snow City.”

Huang Ji let out a breath of relief; he was feeling the cold as well.

If it wasn’t because he kept running the energy in his body, he wouldn’t have been able to stand the cold.

He looked at Lin Xiu, who was behind him, and he had a suspicious look in his eyes.

No one would ever know what he was plotting

So this was the Ice and Snow City…..?

Lin Xiu thought to himself as he looked at the city ahead of him. It seems like the Ice and Snow City was pretty big.

It was a city that was much larger than the Tianlong City.

Does this mean that the people in this city was much stronger than those in Tianlong City?

Lin Xiu didn’t have much time to think about it as they headed into the city.

The city gates were huge and it was wide open. From the gates, Lin Xiu would see that there were huge transporters at the gate.

It was a special type of machinery that was specifically designed to be used in cold places like this city. This was also the same machine that moved the body of the Snow Lizard.

There were also lots of guards standing by the city gates.

Lin Xiu and the rest of them arrived at the gates and after a simple inspection, all of them managed to enter the city.

“Now that the train has been destroyed, we will have to wait for them to notify us if we want to continue heading to Fengyun City. We shall stay here for the time being.”

Jiang Jun announced it to the rest of them after answering a phone call.

As soon as he was done, he turned towards Huang Ji.

“Let’s head over to the Ice and Snow Hotel. I have received news that there are a few other finalists from the other city that will be heading to Fengyun City as well.”

Huang Ji said to Jiang Jun.

Jiang Jun answered.

The rest of them had no other opinion as well.

The entire group continued walking and there was still a thick amount of snow on the ground but the temperature inside the city was much higher than when they were outside.

“Let’s get a jacket each. It’s so cold.”

Qian Jing looked at vendors across the street that were selling special combat suits made out of fur when he suggested it to Lin Xiu.

“I don’t have money.”

Lin Xiu looked at him before saying.

“I’ll pay for you.”

Qian Jing pursed his lips before saying.

“Well, that could work.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

Although he wasn’t feeling cold, he still decided to buy it or else he would look particularly odd amongst the crowd.

“If it’s cold, all of you can buy a jacket first and we shall meet at the hotel.”

Jiang Jun noticed that everyone in the crowd were bustling, hoping to buy some of these coats to stand the cold.

“Yes, Sir!”

After getting the instructions from Jiang Jun, the warriors were all delighted.

Lin Xiu and Qian Jing walked into a store and it sold different kinds of combat suits made of different animal furs.

Most of them were made from the skin, fur and bone of the evolved beast and they looked exquisite.

“Haha….you have a great taste, young man. This is a rank 8 snow tiger’s fur. It’s good for defence as well as keeping you cold.”

A young, wicked looking man appeared and spoke to both of them as Lin Xiu and Qian Jing walked into the store.

“En. I want it then. You’re paying for it.”
