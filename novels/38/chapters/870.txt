Chapter 871: Arriving at Namir Planet

The next day.

Lin Xiu stood on the teleportation device and took a deep breath.

Under his persuasion, Luo Yue finally agreed to stay on Earth and wait for him.

He wasn’t sure what the situation at Namir planet was like and the sequelae of Luo Yue was not gone. It was still very dangerous for her to go there.

“Uncle Ye, can we really get in touch with people from the previous Ye family?”

Taking a closer look at this time, there was another man beside Lin Xiu.

This person is Ye Kai, the guardian at the top of the Sacred Region Academy tower.

He accepted the power inherited from the old man back then.

Until now, there was still the cluster of light in his body, and he has not fully absorbed the power of it.

“It should be possible. Although almost all of the Ye family died back then, there are other families who are subordinates of the Ye family. As long as we go back, we can meet them.”

Ye Kai nodded slightly, then said aloud.

This time, when Lin Xiu came back from the Marqi planet, Ye Kai was very surprised. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Because now Lin Xiu’s strength has been stronger.

And Ye Kai is only rank 9.

“Master, this is the token of the Ye family. With him, the forces of the Ye family back then will help us.”

Ye Kai took out a token and said aloud.

This token looks very primitive.

On it is engraved the word ‘Ye’ in bold cursive calligraphy.

Lin Xiu took the token and touched it, it had a special texture on it.

He didn’t know what material it is made of.

“Okay, let’s go now.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly, then walked to the teleportation device.

Looking at the twelve grooves in front, his eyes narrowed slightly.

Jinli said before that there is no such odd crystal on earth that can drive this machine.

He probably meant odd crystals that were rank 9 and above.

After all, the most powerful evolved beast on earth is only rank 9.

On the Marqi planet, Lin Xiu had brought back many high-level odd crystals.

Looking at the twelve grooves at this time, Lin Xiu directly took out twelve odd crystals from his pocket and placed them in the grooves.

These odd crystals are all above the tenth order.

“Come in.”

Lin Xiu spoke to Ye Kai.

“Um.”

Ye Kai nodded slightly, then walked into the device with Lin Xiu.

Looking at a red button inside the device, Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate and pressed the enable button directly.

boom boom boom —

As soon as the button was pressed, the entire teleportation device seemed to shake instantly.

Together with the ground, it was as if an earthquake had occurred.

And in the groove, those odd crystals seem to be emitting light.

The entire teleportation device seems to have suddenly become bright because of the conduction of energy.

The dazzling light made Lin Xiu squint.

boom boom boom —

In the next moment, there was a louder sound, and the two of them were instantly drowned by the white light.

After a period of time, when Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, he found that he was in a different place.

The place where he was, seemed to be in a huge basement.

There are a lot of weird machines around.

Although there are lights all around, the environment still looks a little dark.

boom–

Ye Kai’s body also fell down at this moment, hitting the ground heavily.

“Are you alright?”

Lin Xiu raised him up and said.

“I’m fine.”

Ye Kai patted the dust on his body and said.

“Now, have we really reached Namir planet?”

Ye Kai looked at the different environment around him, and then subconsciously said.

“Should be.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly and felt it carefully. The gravity of Namir Planet was obviously different from that of Earth.

Now he could clearly feel that my body has become a little heavier.

“Ten times gravity.”

Ye Kai also clearly felt it at this time, and frowned slightly.

For Lin Xiu, the gravity ten times greater than the earth didn’t feel much, but Ye Kai was obviously a little uncomfortable.

“Who is it?”

And at this time, a voice came from the front.

A tall warrior walked over, looked at Lin Xiu and Ye Kai, and frowned slightly.

“Are you the guys that Jinli brought back from Earth?”

He walked forward and looked at Lin Xiu and Ye Kai suspiciously.

Because the average height of people on the planet Namir was more than two meters, so Lin Xiu and Ye Kai are obviously much shorter than them.

“Yes.”

Lin Xiu said with a smile.

Before coming, Lin Xiu had already learned the language of Namir Planet through the people of the Nan family.

So at this time, the conversation can be very smooth.

“Has the earth been wiped out? Why did he let you two lowly earthlings come here?”

The man looked at Lin Xiu and Ye Kai and said coldly.

“Also, in three days, the head will come over here and it would be over for you earthlings.”

“It seems that you are very interested in Earth.”

Lin Xiu continued with a faint smile.

“It’s just that the head wants it. Your Earth is the head’s toy.”

The man continued to speak, with an extremely arrogant look in his eyes.

“Well, what does he want you to do here, if there is nothing, I will kill you both.”

He said a little impatiently.

He didn’t want to waste his time on lowly earthlings.

“He wants... me to come to…”

“Kill you all.”

While Lin Xiu said lightly, the Dark Edge spear in his hand stabbed straight out!

The pupils in the man’s eyes shrank slightly. He didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would attack him suddenly.

Moreover, the shot that Lin Xiu stabbed was really fast, and it was so powerful that it seemed like it could pierce all the space!

boom–

This man didn’t even have time to unfold “Sphere”, and was directly killed by Lin Xiu with a stab in the head.

“This is a man from the God Hunters. I think this should be their base.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Ye Kai, who was a little surprised at first, nodded slightly at this time.

“Let’s go.

Lin Xiu looked at the teleportation device behind him, and said aloud.

Ye Kai hesitated for a moment, then walked forward.

Lin Xiu looked at the teleportation device and narrowed his eyes slightly.

Originally, he wanted to destroy the teleportation device and prevent the people from the planet Namir from being teleported to Earth.

But if it is destroyed, it will not be easy for Lin Xiu to return to Earth later.

“Who’s there!”

Just when Lin Xiu hesitated, a stern shout came over.
