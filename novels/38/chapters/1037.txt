Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

At the same time, the wings behind the Angel lit up brightly.

Then, with the wings behind it, there were thousands of dense energy rays that were aimed at the sage warriors!

Crap!

The sage warriors had a terrible look on their faces as they tried to dodge the attack.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

As one of the warriors with the long spear tried to dodge the attack by moving backwards, Lin Xiu appeared in front of him all of a sudden.

“You’re dead!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was exposing himself, the look on the warrior’s face changed and he was ready to kill.

Then, with the gold spear in his arm, he thrusted it towards Lin Xiu who was right in front of him!

The long spear was shining brightly in gold and it was filled with a large amount of terrifying energy.

Lin Xiu sneered and moved Dark Edge as well and both the long spears collided with each other!

Clang clang – –

Both the warriors had long spears as their weapons. As their weapons collided, there was a long sound that appeared in the air as if there was thunder coming from the sky.

Damn it. This kid’s skills…

After fighting a few rounds with Lin Xiu, the sage warrior had a bad feeling about it.

He always thought of himself as an expert with the long spears but after a few rounds with Lin Xiu, he realised that his skills were beneath Lin Xiu.

“Don’t come here. He is mine!!!”

Seeing how the two other warriors were rushing towards them, the warrior screamed to stop them.

This was because Lin Xiu had picked the spear as his weapon as well. He didn’t believe that he couldn’t kill this kid with his skills.

The sage warriors looked at each other and gave up attacking Lin Xiu. Instead, they turned their attention towards the Angel who had just attacked them.

“Young boy! I will show you how the spear is used!”

The sage warrior screamed in rage and there were terrifying currents that appeared all over the golden spear.

As his spear collided with Lin Xiu’s, the current started moving towards Lin Xiu’s body.

Crackling– –

With the current that appeared, there was a burnt smell that appeared in the air.

“It’s current? I thought you had something else in mind.”

Just as Lin Xiu was speaking, there was a bright light that appeared from the electric crystal ball that was hanging around his neck.

There was another scarier current that appeared and with their weapons still in contact with each other, the current headed towards the sage warrior.

“AHHHHHH!!!!”

When the current reached his body, the sage warrior gritted his teeth while trying to stop himself from screaming.

Impossible! This is impossible!

He was an expert with the long spear. Even if his skill with the spear was beneath Lin Xiu, he didn’t think that the current formed by his source energy would be below Lin Xiu as well!

Plus, even with the resistance that he had against the currents, he could still feel a sharp pain all over his body.

These currents were about to destroy his body!

“You’re good enough to play with the spear?”

Lin Xiu continued attacking the sage warrior with his spear with a provocative smile on his face.

“Go to hell!!”

The words coming out of Lin Xiu’s mouth have obviously landed on the most painful spot for the sage warrior.

He roared in rage and immediately released his ‘sphere’. He did not run and instead, grabbed tightly onto his spear and took the damage head on!

“Die!!!”

Lin Xiu’s pupil narrowed and with the long spear thrusted ahead, it looked as if there was a huge tiger that leaped ahead.

‘Tiger descends the mountain’!!!

Clang – –

When the golden spear of the long warrior touched the Dark Edge, there was a ear-piercing sound that rang in the air.

Then, the long spear in his arm broke instantly!!!

The sage warrior widened his eyes in shock as he couldn’t believe his eyes. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

His weapon was made out of one of the strongest metals but it just broke so easily?!

“Destroy it!!!!”

Then, Lin Xiu held onto his long spear and transferred a large amount of energy into it, causing the entire spear to turn transparent like it was made out of purple crystal.

There was also a bright, red glow that came from the markings on the spear.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu then used his long spear and attacked the sage warrior’s ‘sphere’ from above it!

There was a loud explosion and the sage warrior fell from the sky.

His entire body landed heavily onto the ground.

His ‘sphere’ was still present but because of the impact, there were cracks all over it.

It looked like it was about to explode!

“Goodbye!”

Lin Xiu scoffed and headed towards the warrior with his spear!

The long spear was aimed towards the sage warrior who had fallen onto the ground!

“STOP RIGHT THERE!!!”

The other sage warriors, who were busy fighting the Angel, suddenly screamed.

But now, they could no longer stop Lin Xiu.

As for the sage warrior, who was laying on the ground, widened his eyes in shock as he looked at Lin Xiu who was coming at him with the spear. There was nothing else but fear in his eyes.

He really wanted to run from it but he realised that his body was being controlled!

‘Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall’!

As Lin Xiu headed towards the sage warrior, his entire body was glowing with a silver glow.

Boom – –

Then, as the spear pierced through the ‘sphere’, the entire thing exploded.

The tip of the spear went straight for the warrior’s head and it exploded as well.

At the same time, there was a notification that came from his system.

5% increase in his EXP!!!!!

“That’s quite a lot…”

As he stood by the body of the sage warrior, Lin Xiu was surprised.

The EXP that he has gotten from killing this sage warrior was much higher than the ones that he has gotten previously.

He only needed 93% more of EXP in order for him to move up another rank.

If he killed the remaining two, he should have about a 10% rise in his EXP, right?

Lin Xiu then looked above him and saw the two sage warriors who were running away from the attacks of the Angel.

Since Luo Yue has been taken to a place known as the warrior god’s realm, Lin Xiu was being more impatient about improving his abilities.

“That kid killed Luo De?!”

Bai Zhanfei looked at the scene before him with his eyes widened.

“Young master, this man seems to be quite powerful.”

There was a middle aged man that stood by Bai Zhanfei and he couldn’t help but comment as he stared at Lin Xiu.

“What’s wrong? Are you all afraid of him?!”

When Bai Zhanfei heard what he said, he asked the rest of the warriors around him with a dull look on his face.

These warriors were only responsible for protecting him and they would not join the fight.

Unless…..they was anyone who attacked Bai Zhanfei.
