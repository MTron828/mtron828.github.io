Chapter 258: Fierce Battle in the Forest (II)

Guo Ling shook his head, she couldn’t see which was Lin Xiu.

She was still in shock at this time. Even rank 6 warriors like them found it challenging to deal with Zhou Wenhao but Lin Xiu seemed to be able to fight him, which really surprised her.

Rank 5 warrior vs. rank 7 warrior…

If she hadn’t seen it with her own eyes, she definitely would not believe it because the difference in strength between each rank was quite big.

“Playing tricks!” Zhou Wenhao sneered when he saw the people rushing over from the left and right, then holding the giant sword, he directly attacked both sides!

He was very fast. Although both Lin Xiu’s attacked him at the same time, Zhou Wenhao still managed to block them off!

“Goodbye!” The moment Zhou Wenhao blocked Lin Xiu’s attack, he cut one of the ‘Lin Xiu’ diagonally in half!

Boom–

Just like before, as a dull sound rang out, Lin Xiu’s body suddenly turned into a cloud of smoke and disappeared instantly.

This is the real one!

Although these clones looked exactly the same both in appearance and the weapons they were holding, there was one thing that couldn’t be faked.

And that was Lin Xiu’s strength!

Those clones just now seemed very weak.

They were just paper tigers.

Dang–

He slashed at Lin Xiu’s real body but was directly blocked by the body of Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear.

A dull sound rang out.

“Your skill seemed pretty good.” Zhou Wenhao looked at the real Lin Xiu and said aloud.

Even he just couldn’t tell which one was the real Lin Xiu just now.

If Lin Xiu was also a rank 7 warrior, using this trick would indeed confuse him and it is possible that Lin Xiu could kill him with one blow.

But there was no ‘if’.

“If you tell me how to learn this skill, I can consider not killing you so quickly.” Zhou Wenhao said as he attacked Lin Xiu with ease.

“‘Awe of the Phoenix’!!!”

Lin Xiu ignored him and roared loudly at this time. Then, a large number of flames appeared on the spear body and the flaming birds instantly swept out of Lin Xiu’s spear and flew!

The temperature of the flaming birds was extremely high and even Zhou Wenhao’s expression changed slightly.

Although Lin Xiu was not the strongest warrior he has ever encountered, he was indeed the strangest warrior he has ever encountered.

Especially these skills that Lin Xiu was using – they were really weird!

Looking at the flaming birds that were charging over frantically, Zhou Wenhao held the giant sword like it was very light and stepped on the ground lightly. Then, he flew up into the air.

And while he was in the air, his body could still continue to move as he dodged those flaming birds’ attacks!

What kind of body skill is this!?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s gaze changed and he continued to swing the Dark Edge spear frantically.

Flaming birds came out one after another and rushed towards Zhou Wenhao!

Boom boom——

The flames filled the sky and there were multiple loud explosions!

But Zhou Wenhao’s body skill was very strange. He leaped into the air for a while and with a wave, he jumped to the branches of the giant tree on the side.

Those flaming birds did not hit Zhou Wenhao’s body at all.

Lin Xiu frowned, his body skill must be a diamond body skill, otherwise it would be impossible to dodge his flaming bird so easily!

“‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’!”

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu gripped the Dark Edge spear with both hands and waved it again. The flaming birds that had not hit Zhou Wenhao flew directly into the air.

In the next moment, all of them gathered and formed a huge and terrifying flame.

The entire sky seemed to be covered in this ferocious flame in an instant.

It looked like a sky of fire now.

“Go!”

As Lin Xiu roared again, huge fireballs slammed down!

Zhou Wen frowned. This was another skill he hadn’t seen before.

Where did this guy learn so many skills!?

And most importantly, the temperature of these flames has reached the extreme.

Those fireballs smashed down from the sky. If his body got hit, he would probably suffer a lot of damage.

He could only… dodge now!

“Damn it, what’s this!?” The men who initially thought they had the chance to win and walked out of the protective shield were shocked when they saw this scene.

This is too scary, what the hell is this!? Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

When they saw this, their gaze changed drastically.

Boom——

A man was caught off guard and got hit by the huge fireball that fell from the sky.

“Ah!!!”

The man let out a huge wail as he burned in the flames. In the next moment, his entire body was covered in extremely hot flames.

After a while, he was completely charred like black charcoal!

Terrifying, too terrifying!

“Hurry up and get inside the protective shield!!!” The young man from before was also taken aback and yelled.

Just then, a few more men were directly hit by the fireball and were killed in an instant.

“Do you think that you can get me by attacking like this?” Zhou Wenhao suddenly said coldly when he saw several people in his guild got hit by those fireballs and died.

“Can’t I?” Lin Xiu stared at him and said faintly.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s eyes were filled with confidence.

Zhou Wen was startled. When he heard Lin Xiu’s “arrogant” words and was about to laugh out loud, he saw a huge shadow covering him.

Then, he felt an intense burning sensation just like he was in close contact with the sun.

Zhou Wenhao’s eyes widened, the pupils in his eyes constricted as he looked up and saw a huge ball of flame smashing down!

There was no way to dodge now!

Boom——

This huge flame directly hit Zhou Wenhao’s body!

And at this moment, the fireball exploded, forming a huge flame tornado that spun frantically.

The wind in the surroundings was also surging in an instant!

“Impossible! It is impossible for the vice president to die like this!!!”

The guy, who was already hiding in the protective shield, looked at this scene and his gaze suddenly changed.

Zhou Wenhao was one of their hidden trumps. If Zhou Wenhao died now, they will be the next ones dead!
