Dead?

Luo Hu clenched the long spear in his hand and looked at the other side.

The dust there was now slowly being blown away.

Under the impact of the source mark power of so many warriors, Luo Hu believed that even if Lin Xiu had unfolded the ‘Sphere’, there was no way to resist them.

This person should be dead.

Wait!

But at this moment, Luo Hu seemed to sense something and the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

Because he seemed to see a figure in the dust that was slowly dispersing.

“No… not dead!?”

Those warriors were a little out of breath after using the source mark power and they also saw this scene at this time.

Their eyes widened.

No, not only did he not die, but he was not injured at all!

Luo Hu saw the truth at this time, the muscles in his body tightened and he tightly held the spear in his hand.

“You… who the hell are you!”

As the dust completely dissipated, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared again.

At this time, everyone took a closer look. Lin Xiu’s body did not have any injuries at all.

For Lin Xiu, the source mark power, which was so powerful that even the surrounding ground was dented, had no effect at all!

Strong, too powerful.

Luo Hu now has cold sweat on his forehead.

Lin Xiu patted the dust on his battle suit.

This Holy Light battle suit was indeed an S-rank battle suit.

Although he has strong resistance to electricity, fire and ice attribute skill attacks, the battle suit also helped Lin Xiu resist a lot of attacks.

And this battle suit, there is no sign of damage at all.

This battle suit could block off all attacks below the Sage warrior-level.

Those warriors who just used the source mark power were trembling when they watched this scene.

“How is it possible… how is this possible!”

Their three views were completely subverted at this time.

Even the most powerful warriors can’t ignore their source mark power like that, right?

Just when they wanted to retreat, Lin Xiu directly pulled out the Dark Edge spear he had inserted on the ground.

“run!”

One of the warriors shouted that he was about to run away. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

swoosh—

Lin Xiu, who was holding the Dark Edge spear, directly volleyed an arc into the sky.

A terrifying white light burst out instantly.

It formed a huge crescent shape and charged towards them horizontally!

bang bang bang-

At the next moment, as the bodies of these warriors who wanted to escape were hit, their bodies were all cut in half in an instant!

Blood splattered.

In Lin Xiu’s mind, there were constant system prompts of gaining experience.

And Luo Hu reacted quickly to unfold his ‘Sphere’ in the moment just now.

But even so, he still endured a huge impact and the whole person flew to the back side, hitting the rocks behind him heavily.

A mouthful of blood spit out.

Taking a closer look, there are already a lot of cracks on his ‘Sphere’.

Whoosh whoosh—

The source rings of the six warriors who were just killed flew towards Lin Xiu in the next moment.

In addition to the 21 source rings he obtained before, Lin Xiu now has a total of 27 source rings!

Holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, Lin Xiu walked towards Luo Hu.

Looking at the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand, Luo Hu’s body trembled even more.

The attack just now seemed very simple, but it directly killed all the warriors who came with him!

Although he responded quickly and unfolded the ‘Sphere’, he was still seriously injured.

“Don’t kill me, don’t kill me…”

Looking at Lin Xiu coming over, he said in a trembling voice.

His eyes were full of fear.

“Why not?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

For those who want to kill him, Lin Xiu will not let them go.

The grass grows again if you do not remove its roots.

“I know, I know where the energy source stone is!”

Luo Hu’s eyes changed and in the next moment, he said quickly.

“Oh?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows and the killing intent that burst out from his body also dissipated at this moment.

Luo Hu, who clearly felt this situation, also heaved a sigh of relief at this time.

He was really afraid that Lin Xiu would kill him.

Now it seems that Lin Xiu is still interested in this energy source stone.

“where?”

Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered and the Dark Edge spear in his hand was instantly put into the expansion space.

Looking at this scene, Luo Hu’s eyes were full of shock.

The weapon is gone!?

But at this time, he didn’t have time to think too much, so he quickly replied to Lin Xiu’s words: “Burial Place.”

In the heart of the wilderness here.

In this central area, there were many tombs around and there were bones everywhere.

These corpses might be the skeletons of the warriors who came here before.

squeak-

There were some black and withered trees around.

There were so many black birds on the branches of these trees, making an ear-piercing sound.

“right here?”

Lin Xiu walked into this burial place, looking around.

The surrounding environment is very strange, it seems like a gloomy wind is blowing.

“Should be.”

Luo Hu nodded. When he entered the Sage warrior space, he was in this wilderness.

By chance, he came across an intelligent robot whose appearance was very similar to a real person and it happened that some hidden conditions were triggered so he learned about this information.

“The place where the ancient beasts are buried is where the Source Stone is.”

“This is what the intelligent robot like an NPC said, it should be this burial place…”

Luo Hu hurriedly told Lin Xiu everything he knew.

The current Luo Hu was really frightened by Lin Xiu’s strength and he didn’t dare to hide anything.

“Source Ring.”

Lin Xiu glanced at him at this time and said lightly.

Luo Hu was startled, then he gritted his teeth and with a thought, the six source rings on his arm flew towards Lin Xiu in an instant.

In this situation, life is more important.

As the source rings danced on Lin Xiu’s arms, Lin Xiu already had a total of thirty-three source rings.

The entire arm exudes a dazzling light.

“Huh? Thirty-three source rings!?”

At the same time, in the world outside the Sage warrior Space, Yi Changkong looked at the thirty-three displayed next to Lin Xiu’s name on the stone tablet, with surprise in his eyes.

Although Lin Xiu has thirty-three source rings, Lin Xiu’s name on the stele is still ranked 30th.

It doesn’t make sense…

A warrior with so many source rings should be very powerful, so why is he still ranked 30th.

“It’s weird, it’s really weird.”

Yi Zhangkong muttered to himself.
