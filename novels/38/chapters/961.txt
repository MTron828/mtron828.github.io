Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Zhang Zhijun felt numb in both hands holding the weapon.

Finally, at the next moment, he couldn’t bear the terrifying power brought by Wang Qiang’s spear and the long sword in his hand flew straight out!

Boom—

The long spear in Wang Qiang’s hand stabbed his ‘Sphere’ again.

A loud sound erupted.

!!

On Zhang Zhijun’s ‘Sphere’, a crack appeared instantly, as if it was about to explode!

“Courting death!”

Lin Qiang, who was at the back, watched this scene and hurriedly attacked Wang Qiang with the sword in his hand.

If Zhang Zhijun was killed, his situation would also be very dangerous!

“I want you to… die!”

At this time, Wang Qiang directly released his ‘Sphere’.

He didn’t dodge the attack of Lin Qiang, who was attacking from behind. He continued to hold the spear in his hand and attacked Zhang Zhijun!

“You’re crazy!”

Looking at Wang Qiang’s actions, Zhang Zhijun’s eyes were full of horror.

But he had no way of dodging Wang Qiang’s attack!

‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!!!

Wang Qiang roared angrily and the source energy of his whole body instantly gathered towards the long spear in his hand.

In the next moment, a large amount of black substance suddenly poured out of the spear’s body.

These black tender substances burst out directly, then formed a huge black dragon.

He charged towards Zhang Zhijun’s ‘Sphere’, which was already full of cracks!

This move was a relatively powerful skill that Lin Xiu taught him.

“No!!!”

Zhang Zhijun let out a roar, this huge black dragon, directly following Wang Qiang’s spear, charged towards Zhang Zhijun’s body!

Boom—

With a loud sound, Zhang Zhijun’s ‘Sphere’ exploded!

That black dragon directly hit him, piercing through his body!

“This is… impossible…”

Zhang Zhijun’s eyes widened and after uttering the last four words, his body instantly burst into countless pieces!

boom–

At the same time, Lin Qiang’s attack also directly hit Wang Qiang’s body, who had no defense.

The power of his blow was also very great.

Although Wang Qiang unfolded the ‘Sphere’, the powerful impact actually made Wang Qiang’s body fly straight out.

He hit the ground below the stage.

At this moment, a deep pit appeared on the stage.

“You are lucky!”

Lin Qiang also looked extremely ugly at this time.

He never imagined that Wang Qiang’s strength had increased so much.

Killed Zhang Zhijun!

Although he wanted to avenge Zhang Zhijun, according to the regulations, if he was sent flying out, it would be equivalent to being disqualified from this round and he could not continue to pursue and kill.

Looking back, Lin Qiang saw Lin Xiu sitting on the ground over there, drinking tea gracefully.

As long as he killed Lin Xiu, then he would win this round of battle.

“Be careful, if you want to blame, blame it on teaming up with Wang Qiang.”

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would have much ability.

At this moment, Lin Qiang showed a sneer. In the next moment, he moved and his figure appeared above Lin Xiu’s back.

Holding the sword in his hand, he slashed straight down from top to bottom!

go to hell! ! !

The surrounding onlookers could not help exclaiming when they saw this scene.

They all seemed to be able to see Lin Xiu’s body being chopped in half!

Dang–

But just when his sword was about to slash on Lin Xiu’s body, Lin Xiu lifted his left hand and his fingers caught his sword tightly!

It was as if he had eyes on his back!

“This…”

The onlookers around opened their eyes wide, watching this scene in disbelief. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

But Lin Xiu caught the knife with his fingers so easily.

“what!!!”

Lin Qiang roared and was about to cut Lin Xiu’s palm in half with all his might.

But Lin Xiu’s two fingers still tightly clamped his blade.

Can’t move at all!

Pa dang——

As he continued to exert his strength, the sword was directly snapped into two halves!

This is impossible! ! !

Lin Qiang’s eyes widened as he roared in his heart.

“Goodbye.”

Without waiting for him to make another move, Lin Xiu said in a light voice.

With a wave of his right hand, in the next moment, a fiery red lotus flame burst out directly.

It charged towards the center of his head.

boom–

With a dull sound, he remembered that this flaming lotus hit his head.

His whole body was like a paper figurine and was instantly burned.

In just a few seconds, Lin Qiang didn’t even have time to cry and was burned directly.

Not even the scum is left.

“Ah, I’m a little tired.”

Lin Xiu stretched out at this moment, then stood up and said.

The people around were already dumbfounded at this time.

Just now, they all thought that Lin Xiu was just an ordinary warrior.

Sitting there, he didn’t dare to fight and relied on Wang Qiang to fight.

But now it seemed that this was not the case at all.

Lin Xiu’s strength was beyond their imagination!

“Referee, did we win?”

Lin Xiu looked at the referee and said.

“Yes, yes!”

“Group 1300 won!”

When the referee heard Lin Xiu’s words, he came to his senses and said aloud.

The strange power that Lin Xiu showed just now made the referee feel horrified.

“Master, I’m sorry.”

At this moment, as Lin Xiu jumped off the stage, Wang Qiang lowered his head and said aloud.

“It’s okay, you’ve done a good job.”

Lin Xiu patted Wang Qiang on the shoulder and said.

“Go and treat the wound first.”

“Sure.”

Wang Qiang nodded and said.

As Wang Qiang and Lin Xiu walked to the other side, some people hiding in the dark secretly followed Lin Xiu and Wang Qiang.

They seemed to be eyeing Lin Xiu.

Warrior God Realm.

A huge planet in another galaxy, 1031 times the size of the earth.

Here, it is called the Warrior god Realm.

Because in this world, the strongest warrior is the warrior god.

It is rumored that after reaching the warrior god realm, you can break through space and travel in any world at will.

And the power they possess can easily destroy a planet.

“Hey, Junior, you practice like this every day, don’t you get tired of it?”

At this time, a beautiful woman in a white battle uniform, looked at the woman with an unparalleled beauty but an ice-cold face.

The woman had long white hair and she waved the long sword in her hand, which was beautiful.

swoosh—

At this time, she swung the long sword in her hand and a sword aura burst out directly.

Directly cut off all the mountains in the distance!
