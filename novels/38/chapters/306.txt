Chapter 307: Instinctive Reaction

They were still in confusion when the middle-aged man looked at Hua Tian in fear.

“This is our fault, sorry.”

They apologized!?

Lin Xiu also found it unbelievable. Under normal circumstances, these people would have started a fight.

After all, they killed one of their people. It would be weird if they didn’t fight back.

Lin Xiu stared at the middle-aged man, and with the Analytic Eye, this man’s information appeared before Lin Xiu.

Character: Xu Ke

Strength: 798

Physique: 389

Speed: 220

Combat strength: 7805

Seeing the data provided by the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu was shocked.

The strength of this guy was too terrifying, over 7,000 combat strength, and his attributes far surpass himself.

If this guy makes a move, with his current strength, even if he uses the ‘Fury’ skill, he probably wouldn’t have a chance of winning, eh?

“Let’s go.” Hua Tian glanced at them, then said faintly.

“Yes.” The middle-aged man nodded, then glanced at his team who were still in shock, and said, “Let’s go!”

As soon as he said that. he took the lead and headed to the area where they were before.

Seeing this scene, those people hesitated for a moment then followed behind him.

“Let’s go, too.” Hua Tian glanced at Lin Xiu, then said with a strange smile. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Lin Xiu was still a little stunned at this time. Why would that middle-aged man leave and he was so respectful to Hua Tian.

This was really puzzling to Lin Xiu.

But at this moment, Hua Tian had already walked ahead and it seemed that he had no intention of answering Lin Xiu’s questions.

Lin Xiu saw him walking in front and hesitated a little before he continued walking.

“Captain, why didn’t we kill those two chaps just now!”

On the other side, when Lin Xiu and Hua Tian walked to the other side, a man couldn’t help but speak up.

Hearing this question, the middle-aged man stopped in his tracks, then turned around and glanced at the people behind. Then, he said in a deep voice, “Because…I don’t want to die yet.”

When he said that, he made a gesture.

Seeing his gesture, these people looked as if they saw something terrifying and their expressions suddenly changed.

They continued walking and their surroundings were still the same as before.

The only difference was that the number of weird towering trees around had decreased and they were surrounded by black rocks instead.

The ground around them was also bumpy like it was hit by a meteorite.

“The Dark Forest was formed because there were huge space cracks here before. Many rocks and trees from different dimensions fell and gradually created the Dark Forest.” Hua Tian walked ahead and explained.

“The pits and holes on the ground you see are caused by meteorites that fell from different dimensions. Those stones are the best materials for forging weapons and they were taken away by people who knew about them decades ago.”

Hearing Hua Tian’s introduction, Lin Xiu had a sudden realization.

In that case, he should be near the center of the Dark Forest, right?

With that thought, Lin Xiu’s gaze changed and he clenched the spear in his hand tightly.

Buzzing–

Jus then, Lin Xiu heard a strange noise.

Boom–

Hua Tian’s expression changed as well as he waved the thin-winged long sword in his hand and with a ‘swish’, he slashed towards the sky ahead!

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu saw a huge mosquito-like thing, getting chopped in half by the long sword.

“Rank 7 Murderous Mosquito!?” Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted upon seeing this scene.

With the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu could easily find out the specific information of various strange evolved beasts.

This thing was like a mosquito that has been magnified hundreds of times, with many white spots on its body and a long needle-like thing on its mouth.

Just looking at it like this gave Lin Xiu goosebumps.

“Oh? It seems that you still know quite a bit.” Hua Tian glanced at Lin Xiu appreciatively, then nodded.

“Creatures that only exist in the Dark Forest are the most poisonous creatures. This thing is indeed very scary. How did you find out?” Lin Xiu said while looking at Hua Tian.

The characteristic of this thing is that it can change color with the surrounding environment and its needle mouth has a terrifying poison. Even if a warrior was simply pricked by the needle on its mouth, the warrior would probably die in just a few tens of seconds.

Although this thing was a rank 7 beast, it’s physically weak and ordinary warriors could easily kill it.

But even Lin Xiu didn’t notice this thing just now, how did Hua Tian discover it?

“Instinctive reaction.” Just when Lin Xiu was puzzled, Hua Tian looked far away and said faintly.

Instinctive reaction?

“Like how I killed the person just now. Other than relying on my own strength, I also relied on my instinctive reaction.” Hua Tian said indifferently as he walked forward.

“The moment he attacked me, I had already anticipated his next attack, so I could kill him with one move.”

“It takes a lot of actual combat experience to be able to do this.”

As soon as Hua Tian explained this, a strong murderous aura exuded from him.

Lin Xiu understood it very quickly. What this guy was saying was that he had killed many people!

Moreover, the murderous aura that he exuded was so strong that it made Lin Xiu feel a little overwhelmed.

But very quickly, the murderous aura quickly dissipated and Lin Xiu no longer felt suppressed.

“Luo Yue and I are similar in this regard.”

When he said this, he continued walking to the front.

“Let’s go, if nothing happens, we should be able to find her on the other side.”

Hua Tian looked into the distance, narrowed his eyes and said.

‘He seems to know Luo Yue well?’

Lin Xiu seemed to feel a little uncomfortable when he heard Hua Tian’s words, but he shook his head and continued to walk forward.

Since he was already here, he definitely couldn’t give up halfway.
