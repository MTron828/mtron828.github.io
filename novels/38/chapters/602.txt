Chapter 603: Arrogance

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

As soon as the referee spoke, everyone in Changjia Academy stood up with their own weapons.

They seemed to be specially trained.

On the other hand, Lin Xiu and the others seemed to be very casual.

“It’s a third-rate academy for sure, they’re going to lose.”

“Oh, there is nothing to watch…”

The people below couldn’t help shaking their heads at this time, as if they were not optimistic about this game at all.

“Are you guys afraid huh?”

At this time, Zhao Qian looked at Lin Xiu and the others, pointed the long sword in his hand at them, and said with a sneer at the corner of his mouth.

Lin Xiu and the others didn’t seem to have the will to fight at all, and they looked very sloppy, which made the others in Changjia Academy feel that Lin Xiu and others knew that they were going to lose, and they didn’t even want to fight.

“They’re yours.”

Lin Xiu glanced at Ouyang Hang, and then said lightly.

“I can beat ten of them by myself.”

Ouyang Hang nodded, then said with a proud smile.

“Hahaha, you can beat ten of us? What kind of joke are you making!”

Zhao Qian burst into laughter at this moment, and in the next moment, holding the long sword in his hand, he took the lead in stabbing Ouyang Hang!

Swoosh—

He was running at a very fast speed.

“As expected of a student of Changjia College, this movement speed is really fast.”

When some warriors saw this scene, they couldn’t help but sigh.

But Ouyang Hang, who had just stood up, seemed to be in a daze and stood there and didn’t move.

“Go to hell!”

There was a hideous smile on the corner of Zhao Qian’s mouth, and the long sword was about to stab Ouyang Hang!

But at this moment, Ouyang Hang moved.

Dang–

The people below were not able to see Ouyang Hang’s movements clearly, but only heard a clear sound, Zhao Qian’s long sword came out of his hand, and in the next moment, his body flew out directly!

He flew directly out of the competition platform and fell heavily under the competition platform.

“Come on, let’s play some cards first and let that kid do the job.” Baili Haoling took out a deck of cards from nowhere, then shook it to Lin Xiu and the others.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but have black lines all over his head. Now, the people at Changjia Academy were probably going to die of anger.

“Damn it! What’s going on here?”

The people from Changjia College opened their eyes wide at this time, and their eyes were filled with disbelief.

He looked at the bottom of the competition platform, and found that Zhao Qian seemed to be dizzy because of the powerful impact!

But at this time, when he looked at Lin Xiu and the others, he realized that Lin Xiu and the others had ignored them and sat in front of them playing cards!

Changjia Academy was so popular and they were being totally disregarded!

Arrogant, the people of this Sacred Region academy are really arrogant!

“Kill them!!!”

The man who spoke harshly at Changjia College gritted his teeth and said.

Following his order, the remaining four directly attacked Lin Xiu and the others!

“Don’t disregard me.”

At this time, Ouyang Hang blocked the front, and then said to the people from Changjia College who rushed over.

“Get lost!”

When the people from Changjia College saw Ouyang Hang blocking, they immediately roared angrily, and wanted to join forces to knock Ouyang Hang out first.

Bang bang bang-

But with a dull sound, the students of Changjia Academy who rushed over in a hurry were knocked out in the next moment!

“Damn it, I’m fighting hard yet you guys playing cards here?”

Ouyang Hang patted his palms, then looked back, and said to Lin Xiu and the others in a very unhappy manner.

“Because you are the weakest.”

Baili Haoling said viciously.

Hearing Baili Haoling’s words, Ouyang Hang was so angry that he almost vomited out a mouthful of blood.

“The battle is over, Sacred Region academy wins.”

At this time, the referee walked to the competition stage, and then looked at Lin Xiu and the others with shock in his eyes.

Not only was the referee shocked, but even the warriors who had watched the scene on the competition stage were also stunned.

The people from Changjia Academy, who were originally very optimistic, were all easily defeated, and the opponent merely used a warrior.

Next, the competition continued, Lin Xiu and others still successfully passed the audition with a winning streak.

“It’s too easy, it’s boring.”

At this moment, Baili Haoling stretched and said aloud.

Lin Xiu looked around and found that the battle was still going on. Today, the academies that could enter the Sky City competition must be decided.

“When is the single match?”

Lin Xiu said curiously at this time.

“The single-player competition is at Sky City. The premise is that only the warriors who have advanced to the academy battle can participate. Some of them are seed academies of the academy and are not subjected to this condition.”

Huang Zhen seemed to have a better understanding of this aspect, and when he heard Lin Xiu’s words, he immediately said aloud.

“En.”

“Are you going to participate in the single match?”

Baili Haoling said to Lin Xiu.

“Yes.” UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Lin Xiu responded.

This was an opportunity to fight against the warriors in the world, of course Lin Xiu would not give up.

“Are you participating?” Lin Xiu thought for a while, then said to Baili Haoling.

“No, this is a battle for you youngsters, I’m old.”

Baili Haoling shook her head, then took a bottle of beer out of nowhere and took a sip.

If it was a senior who said that, there would be no problem, but she looked like a young doll, and when she said such words, Lin Xiu’s head was covered with black lines.

“I am also participating.” Ouyang Hang also said aloud at this time.

“Forget it, save your strength and go home.” Lin Xiu glanced at Ouyang Hang, then patted him on the shoulder and said.

“The guy with surname Lin, have a duel with me if you’ve got guts!”

After Lin Xiu said this, Ouyang Hang’s eyes widened and he said out loud.

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao couldn’t help laughing, but they could also feel that Lin Xiu’s strength seemed unfathomable.

They knew from the fact that Lin Xiu easily defeated Wild Bull when he was in the academy that day.

“Are you guys from Sacred Region academy?”

At this moment, a group of warriors walked over from another direction and said to Lin Xiu and the others.

Seeing these people approaching, Lin Xiu raised his brows, then smiled lightly and said, “Why?”

“I heard that you guys are also promoted, right? We won’t be polite when we meet at Sky City.”

These people said to Lin Xiu and others arrogantly.

As soon as they finished speaking, they left without looking back.
