1214 Returning to Lingxian City

He could clearly feel that Fu Tianling’s energy disappeared here.

Other than Fu Tianling’s energy, there were also a lot of energies left behind by the other warriors.

Along with how the surrounding has been destroyed, there must have been a huge fight here.

However, all of the bodies and blood around have disappeared.

“Would it be you?”

As he looked at the burnt marks that were left behind, Fu Tianling looked into the sky and no one knew what was going on in his mind.

Lin Xiu, who was riding on Little Bai, laid comfortably on its shoulder.

WIth Little Bai flying them, it would only take a day for them to return to Lingxian City.

“Lin Xiu, did you find Luo Yue?”

Baili Haoling looked around before asking.

“I haven’t.”

Lin Xiu sighed helplessly.

The warrior god realm was much bigger than the Nano Planet.

Plus, there were nine different states in this place. The one that Lin Xiu was in now was already incredibly huge. It would be difficult for him to find Luo Yue.

However, this isn’t going to stop Lin Xiu.

“If it wasn’t because my ancestor threw me here and left, I would have asked for their help.”

Baili Haoling felt a little helpless as well.

“Oh! I heard that for new warrior gods, they would have to be city lords for at least 3 years?”

“That’s what they say.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

However, Lin Xiu was not going to stay at one place for 3 years.

He would have to think of a way to leave so that he could find Luo Yue.

“Only an idiot would stay at a place for 3 years.”

Baili Haoling sneered.

Time quickly passed. After travelling for one entire day, they could finally see Lingxian City.

As they looked at the city from above, the shape of the city looked like an eight trigram.

Compared to the shabby city that Lin Xiu had seen when he first arrived, Lingxian City had become so much more modern.

“Who is it?”

When Little Bai flew into the air above Lingxian City, there were lots of guards that flew into the air with their drones as well.

“It’s me.”

Lin Xiu then got up from the back to Little Bai.

“City lord!”

These guards knew who Lin Xiu was. When they saw him, they were all shocked.

“Please forgive us. We…”

One of the guards quickly spoke up nervously.

They wouldn’t have thought that the person that they stopped was the city lord.

“It’s fine.”

“Go on.”

Lin Xiu waved his arms.

“Yes, Sir!”

The guards respectfully nodded their heads and left.

“Well, I didn’t think that your guards would be so respectful towards you.”

Baili Haoling commented.

Ever since Lin Xiu killed all of the people from Tianlan Pavilion, most of the people in Lingxian City looked up to their new city lord.

Soo, Little Bai flew over to the empty ground in the City Lord Mansion and slowly landed on the ground.

As Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling got off its back, Little Bai’s body glowed brightly. From a huge bird, it changed back into a tiny bird.

If it retained its physique as the huge bird, it would be difficult for it to move.

“City lord, you’re back?”

When Lin Xiu stepped foot onto the courtyard, there was a familiar voice that rang from behind.

It was Mr Pang.

“This is my butler, Mr Pang.”

“A friend of mine, Baili Haoling.”

LinXiu introduced them to each other.

“Hello.”

Mr Pang greeted Baili Haoling respectfully.

“Hi.”

Baili Haoling nodded her head in return.

As she looked around, the interior design of this house was different from the rest. Lin Xiu had designed it according to the ancient building from Hua Xia.

From someone like Lin Xiu who was from Hua Xia, these buildings gave him a warm and familiar feeling.

“Congratulations on the achievements in Manhuang City.”

Mr Pang smiled as he congratulated Lin Xiu.

“Oh? You knew about it?”

Lin Xiu asked subconsciously.

“There is a livestream of the tournaments in Manhuang City.”

Mr Pang looked surprised.

“Oh….really?”

Lin Xiu felt a little awkward and he didn’t know what to say.

“You must be tired from all the travelling, I’ll get them to prepare the dishes.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Alright.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head before laying down on one of the chairs.

This was comfortable.

“You have quite a nice place here.”

Baili Haoling looked around before complimenting the building.

Little Bai and Rollie were playing by the lake in the middle of the courtyard.

“It is indeed.”

Lin Xiu was slowly rocking his rocking chair, feeling incredibly pleasant.

“Oh, do you know how to use double swords?”

Lin Xiu suddenly thought of something and asked Baili Haoling about it.

Double daggers should be the same as using double swords, right?

“Double sword? I don’t.”

Baili Haoling shook her head.

“That’s a shame.”

Lin Xiu took out one of the god-level warrior skills cards from his expansion space and he felt a little helpless.

It means that this god level warrior skills card would be useless.

“Double daggers and double swords may be similar but they are actually different things.”

Baili Haolign added.

“Is that so…?”

Luo Yue may be using a sword but it was still different from using double swords.

“You can bring it to the other cities and see if you can exchange it for anything else?”

Baili Haoling suggested.

“That’s a good idea.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

Boom – –

Suddenly, there was a loud commotion that came from the gates.

It sounded as if someone had forcefully pushed it open.

“Mr Pang! My Pang!”

Lin Xiu had a sharp hearing and he could hear the voice that came from the gates.

Hmmm?

The man sounded nervous.

“Looks like something happened.”

Baili Haoling sounded a little excited.

“Let’s take a look.”

Lin Xiu stood up from his rocking chair and walked out of the courtyard.

“Zhao Hu, what happened?!”

Mr Pang was giving instructions to the others while preparing a meal for Lin Xiu. When he saw the man rushing into the mansion, Mr Pang frowned.

“What happened?”

When he took a good look, the man that was known as Zhao Hu, was covered with injuries.

Blood has stained through his clothes as well.

“They! They’re here again!!”

Zhao Hu sounded frightened.

“I thought they left…..”

Mr Pang had a solemn expression on his face after hearing what Zhao Hu said.

“What’s the matter?”

Lin Xiu walked over.

“City Lord!”

When Zhao Hu saw that it was Lin Xiu, he quickly greeted lin Xiu excitedly and wanted to bow.

“You’re excused.”

Lin Xiu waved his arm.

“Bring Zhao Hu inside so that he can be treated.”
