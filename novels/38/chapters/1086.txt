Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Bang bang bang-

Holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he frantically attacked the body of the Frost Dragon.

Before the Frost Dragon could react at all, Lin Xiu appeared behind it.

At this time, under the frantic attack of Lin Xiu’s spear, it also let out a roar.

Because Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear carries hellfire, it could easily break its epidermis and cause damage to it.

At this moment, it turned around suddenly and the huge tail was about to slam toward Lin Xiu’s body.

swoosh—

But when Lin Xiu used his body skill, he quickly dodged it again.

Roar–

Frost Dragon missed and suddenly roared wildly. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Because one of its eyes was blown out by Lin Xiu, it has become extremely crazy now.

A large amount of white energy spit out from his mouth and sprayed around.

Lin Xiu, who was in the air, saw this scene in his eyes, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly and he continued to dodge and stay away from the frost.

In this situation, there is no way to get close.

Moreover, the Frost Dragon seemed to be even crazier because he had just stabbed its eyes.

Now, there is a lot of frost and cold air coming out of its body.

The temperature of the surrounding air also became lower and lower.

Frozen to the bone.

Lin Xiu frowned at this moment, then with a thought, his source strength was mobilized.

In an instant, three gigantic lotus fires were released, then charged toward Frost Dragon!

Roar–

The Frost Dragon let out a roar and exhaled a large amount of icy cold air from its mouth.

However, those three lotus fires were not affected by the cold energy at all and they directly impacted the head of the Frost Dragon!

And at this moment, the three lotus fires converged together, producing very strong energy.

Boom—

In the next moment, there was a huge explosion.

Frost Dragon’s head was instantly burned by these three kinds of flames.

The skin on its head turned black at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Roar–

Frost Dragon also felt extreme pain and let out a loud roar.

Die!

Lin Xiu watched this scene, gritted his teeth and the whole body’s source strength burst out at this moment.

A large amount of source strength was gathered on the Dark Edge spear.

The entire spear burst out with a lot of flames.

He was going to stab this Frost Dragon in the head!

To directly penetrate its head and give it a fatal blow.

At this time, the Frost Dragon was still shaking its body frantically, as if it wanted to shake away the burning flames.

But no matter how hard it shook, these flames were still burning on its head.

And Lin Xiu’s spear had already stabbed out!

Roar–

Frost Dragon clearly felt that Lin Xiu was rushing toward him. At this time, regardless of the flames burning on his head, it let out a roar, opened its mouth wide and bit directly at Lin Xiu who was charging over!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

But now there was no way to dodge it, so he was bitten by the frost dragon directly.

“Hmph, although this kid’s flames are powerful, he still died here…”

Not far away, Bai Zhan and the others were hiding by the ice peak, watching the scene from afar.

Although they seemed to have left just now, they were actually hiding from the other side to observe the scene here.

Unexpectedly, Lin Xiu hadn’t left yet and he was still attacking this Frost Dragon here.

And what surprised Bai Zhan, even more, was that Lin Xiu seemed to have preserved his strength before.

Including the killing of the two Sage warriors, it seems that he had not used his full strength.

But it didn’t matter now, he has already been swallowed by the Frost Dragon and he will definitely die.

“Wait a minute, it’s our turn to kill this Frost Dragon.”

At this moment, Bai Zhan also stood up with a smile on the corner of his mouth.

As the saying goes, ‘When the snipe and the clam grapple, it is the fisherman who profits.’

At the same time, although Lin Xiu was swallowed by the Frost Dragon, he entered its stomach, but he was not corroded by its gastric juice.

The Frost Dragon’s stomach was very strange.

Along with the highly corrosive gastric juice, there was also cold air.

Even if the ‘Sphere’ is unfolded, you could feel the freezing cold.

If it was an ordinary Sage warrior-level warrior, after being swallowed, it would be directly frozen by this icy aura, unable to move at all and it will be melted by its extremely corrosive gastric juice.

But Lin Xiu was no ordinary Sage warrior.

With the Heart of Frost, these icy auras would not have much impact on Lin Xiu at all.

Lin Xiu’s whole body’s source strength was mobilized and the flames in his body erupted directly.

A lot of flames burned wildly in his stomach.

Roar–

Frost Dragon finally managed to make the flames burning on his head disappear, but the severe pain in his stomach made Frost Dragon frantically roll and struggle.

“This is you courting your own death.”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself in its stomach.

As the Dark Edge spear frantically attacked its stomach, a lot of flames continued to burst out.

Seeing that its stomach was already full of hellfire and when it was about to be directly burned by the flames, Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in both hands and the source strength of his whole body was mobilized again.

‘Heaven Breaking Strike’!

When he was outside just now, Lin Xiu didn’t dare to use this skill.

Because the power of this skill was powerful, but if it didn’t kill with one hit, it will consume a lot of energy and the loss will outweigh the gain.

But now is the best time to use this skill!

“Break!!!”

With the use of Lin Xiu’s skill, at this moment, the body of the Frost Dragon has suddenly torn apart!

And because the body of Frost Dragon was torn apart, Lin Xiu rushed out immediately.

Roar–

At this moment, the Frost Dragon let out a roar and terrifying white energy spewed out from its mouth.

Just as Bai Zhan and the others were about to go over, they saw the terrifying flame spewed out by the Frost Dragon and the expressions in their eyes changed greatly.

“Don’t go there!”

Bai Zhan stopped and there was still lingering fear in his heart.

It was putting up its last fight.

But…why isn’t this kid dead?

Lin Xiu had already rushed out of its body.

Just now, the ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’ had broken a hole in its body from the inside out.

A large amount of purple blood flowed out from its wound.

While the Frost Dragon was rolling frantically, it spat out terrifying white energy.

But Lin Xiu’s reaction speed was extremely fast and there was no way he could be attacked by those white energies at this time.

“It’s over.”
