Chapter 927: The Last Ground

As Luo Kun pushed his palm forward, there was a huge figure of a palm covered in flames that appeared in the air, headed toward Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu reamined on the same spot, motionless.

It looks as if he didn’t care about Luo Kun.

“Go to hell!”

When he saw Lin Xiu’s reaction, Luo Kun roared out loud.

Koong loong – –

The scary looking flames directly landed on Lin Xiu’s body.

However, something shocking happened!

The palm did land on Lin Xiu but he still remained motionless, unharmed.

These flames wouldn’t have been able to do any damage to Lin Xiu.

“You want to die?”

That’s when Lin Xiu slowly turned around and asked.

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, his eyes met with Lin Xiu’s eyes and his body started shaking.

It was such a terrifying look.

“I...I...”

Luo Kun’s body started shaking uncontrollably.

“The spear that he is holding belongs to a sage warrior!”

He suddenly noticed the Dark Edge that Lin Xiu had and screamed loudly.

The rest of the warriors around them started looking at the spear that Lin Wiu had as well.

The entire spear was black in colour and there were a few smaller marks on it. It looked extremely cool.

Especially after what Luo Kun said, all of the warriors around seemed to be convinced.

Most of them believed that the long spear that Lin Xiu had was the treasure that he got from the Secret Realm.

“You talk too much.”

Lin Xiu raised his brows as he knew that Luo Kun was only saying this to trap him.

Then, Lin Xiu swayed his long spear and there was a terrifying flame that went towards Luo Kun.

‘Sphere!’

The flames were rushing towards him quickly and Luo Kun knew that he would not be able to stop it.

The only thing that he could do was use his ‘sphere’!

As he released his ‘Sphere’, the flames that Lin Xiu had released reached him at the same time and landed on his ‘sphere’.

Boom –

With the loud sound, the entire ground started shaking as well.

“Ahhhhh!!!!!”

Luo Kun screamed and was using all his energy to strengthen his ‘sphere’ in order to stop the flames.

However, his ‘sphere’ was slowly melting away.

In the end, the entire ‘sphere’ disappeared and the terrifying flame landed on his body.

Within seconds, his entire body had turned into ash.

Even his bones were burnt.

The rest of the warriors had their eyes opened wide.

They were shocked.

This man was so powerful.

He was able to defeat Luo Kun, who was a respected warrior, with merely one skill.

“Is there anyone else who would like to try?”

Lin Xiu looked at the rest of them and asked.

After hearing what he said, all the warriors took one step back subconsciously.

Even Zhang Mian was shaking.

How could he be so powerful?!

He was looking at Lin Xiu in disbelief, thinking that Lin Xiu would definitely come from him next.

Lin Xiu didn’t care about the warriors and instead, turned around to check out the paths that were in front of him.

“This brat, where is he from?”

One of the warriors was silently watching Lin Xiu and he asked Zhang Mian.

“I don’t know!”

“He will be dead soon for killing warriors from the Secret Realm!”

Zhang Mian might be afraid of Lin Xiu now but after hearing what the warrior asked, he still mumbled to himself.

Although Lin Xiu was strong and powerful now, there were still a lot of sage warriors in the Secret Realm. It would be a piece of cake to kill Lin Xiu.

For now, he could only bury the hatred that he had for Lin Xiu and find an opportunity to report to his authorities about this.

As for the rest of the warriors, they nodded their heads after hearing what Zhan Mian said but there was nothing that they could say now.

This was the Secret Realm and it wasn’t something that they should be bothered with.

With how strong Lin Xiu was, if he didn’t like them, he could just kill them with one hit and they would all be dead.

“Ding! Analysis succeeded!”

Huh?

After analysing each tunnel with the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu suddenly heard the notification from his system and was quite surprised.

He immediately looked through the statistics.

Analytic Information;

Ecstasy Tunnel

Speciality: Able to create hallucinations. Do not be confused by the scene before your eyes and you will be able to leave this place.

After reading through the information, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but smile.

So this was the truth. The other paths were fake while the real one would also contain something ‘fake’.

He only has to walk through this path in order to walk out of this place.

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu headed directly into the path before him.

The other warriors around him were shocked.

“Kid, did you find the right path?”

The warriors asked subconsciously.

Perhaps it was because Lin Xiu was too powerful earlier and they were confident that Lin Xiu would choose the right path.

Lin Xiu immediately closed his eyes as he entered the path.

This was done so that he wouldn’t be distracted or confused by what he would see with his eyes.

He could only follow his other senses and continue moving forward. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Lin Xiu continued walking one step at a time with his eyes closed.

After some time, Lin Xiu felt a bright light shining on his face and that’s when he opened his eyes.

“Hmm?”

When he opened his eyes, everything in front of him was different!

It was a huge space, different from the scene before.

The ground of the space was made of some special material as it was glowing brightly.

Plus, as he took a look around, he could see that there were lots of statues in the room.

Although all of them were statues of warriors, the weapons in their hands were not part of the statue.

All of these weapons were real weapons! Just like the sage warrior that he saw earlier!

There were so many sage warriors!

From one glance, there seemed to be at least a dozen of them.

Most of them were holding onto one godly weapon.

Roar!!!!

Just as Lin Xiu was looking around at the statues, he suddenly heard a loud roar.

This roar was extremely loud.

The entire space started shaking.

It was so loud that Lin Xiu’s eardrums were about to burst.

He looked up to see what it was and soon, he noticed that at a dark corner far away, there was a huge scaly dragon!

Its mouth was wide open and the entire scale dragon was filled with flames!

It looked as if it had caught on fire.

The scaly dragon was huge.

Without wasting any time, Lin Xiu directly activated the Analytic Eye!
