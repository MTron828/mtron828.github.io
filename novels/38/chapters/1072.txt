Chapter 1073: Sneak Attack?

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

With Yu Tao leading, everyone went to the other side.

Soon he walked to a private airport.

“Okay, if there is no problem, let’s go up.”

Yu Tao glanced at everyone and found that none of the Sage warrior-level warriors left and nodded with satisfaction.

Hearing his words at this time, Lin Xiu also walked directly to the plane.

!!

It seems that they are going to fly directly to the so-called road of ice and fire.

Soon, after all the warriors entered the plane, Yu Tao also entered the pilot seat.

Boom—

At the next moment, as the plane started, a tremendous momentum came.

This plane is very fast.

Flew straight out of Baidi City.

It seems that because of some special relationship, this plane can leave directly without going through the inspection of the forces of the city lord council in Baidi City.

“Will it be successful this time…”

Elder Yu looked at this scene with his eyes at this time and said aloud as if talking to himself.

“But it doesn’t matter if it doesn’t work, as long as it’s there, there will always be people going.”

While speaking to himself, he took a look at the box in his hand.

Inside this box, there is a skill card ‘Silence’.

It didn’t take too long, about half an hour.

The speed of the plane obviously started to slow down.

It seems to have started to land.

Arrived? Lin Xiu, who was sitting on the plane, raised his brows.

“Okay, we’re here.”

At this time, Yu Tao’s voice also came from the loudspeaker inside the plane.

boom boom boom —

As the plane descended and stopped, the door opened immediately.

Lin Xiu, who was close to the cabin door, walked out directly at this time.

As soon as he walked out, he felt an icy cold coming.

“It’s so cold.”

Some warriors around felt the temperature and said subconsciously.

Lin Xiu, who had just walked out, saw a vast expanse of whiteness in front of him.

Ice and snow.

“From the front, it is the entrance to the road of ice and fire.”

“Frost dragon’s location has been entered into your smart watch, you guys can check it out.”

At this time, Yu Tao looked at the many warriors around him and said aloud.

“I’m only responsible for leading you here, you guys have to go on by yourselves.”

Hearing Yu Tao’s words, everyone around looked to the front.

It was the first time they were here so there was curiosity in their eyes.

“Of course, if anyone feels that they don’t want to go and want to come back, I will wait for you here and provide support.”

“Wishing you guys good luck.”

Lin Xiu was also slightly startled at this time. He originally thought that Yu Tao would go with them, but he didn’t expect that he was just leading them here.

But that doesn’t matter.

Everything depended on oneself.

“let’s go.”

At this time, one of the Sage warriors had already started walking towards the front.

The rest of the Sage warriors watched this scene and followed suit.

They also know that it is not feasible to act alone at this time and they all gather together to move forward.

Continuing to walk forward for a certain distance, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the surrounding air, which became colder and colder.

The cold wind is biting.

At this time, stepping on the ice and snow, he suddenly felt that his feet became extremely cold.

However, Lin Xiu has the heart of frost, so he didn’t have the slightest feeling at this time.

It’s just that the faces of the surrounding warriors turned ugly.

They felt that their feet became a little frozen and at this moment, the source strength of the body was running and gathered under their feet.

Allowing their feet to warm up and get rid of these cold sensations.

While Lin Xiu was walking, the burly man in front of him stared at Lin Xiu with a fierce look in his eyes.

When he was in the tavern, he tried to attack Lin Xiu unsuccessfully, but instead was sent flying out. It was utter humiliation.

To wash away this humiliation, he could only…

At this moment, he clenched the sword in his hand tightly and in the next moment, his figure flashed and he appeared behind Lin Xiu.

The sword he was holding slashed directly at Lin Xiu’s body!

swoosh—

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s figure also disappeared.

Where did he go!?

The pupils in the man’s eyes shrank.

He was always looking for an opportunity to kill Lin Xiu with one blow. Just now, it was obviously the best opportunity.

How could Lin Xiu dodge again!?

“Sneak attack, not very nice is it?”

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s voice came from behind.

Hearing this voice, his expression changed slightly, he turned around suddenly and looked behind him.

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu’s figure was indeed behind.

When some warriors around saw this scene at this time, they all looked like they were watching a show.

“Zhou Ba, forget it, the most important purpose of this trip is to kill Frost dragon.”

One of the sage warriors looked at him, then said lightly.

“You go, I must kill this kid now.”

Zhou Ba looked at Lin Xiu and said savagely.

Once again, he did not succeed in killing Lin Xiu with a sneak attack, which made him very irritated.

Now he can ignore everything, but he must kill Lin Xiu!

“Come.”

Lin Xiu beckoned at him.

“Courting death!”

Looking at Lin Xiu’s actions, Zhou Ba’s heart filled with infinite anger.

With a loud roar, he held the sword in his hand and attacked Lin Xiu directly! DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

Dang–

Just as he waved the sword in his hand to attack Lin Xiu, a dark spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

The long spear blocked his attack and suddenly there was a loud metal collision sound.

When the surrounding warriors saw this scene, the expressions in their eyes also changed slightly.

Where did his weapon come from?

These warriors just saw that Lin Xiu didn’t have any weapons.

They all thought that Lin Xiu was a boxer.

Lin Xiu used force with his spear-holding hand and Zhou Ba’s body was blown away for a short distance.

Before he could react, Lin Xiu continued to stab him with a spear.

Dang dang-

Zhou Ba’s expression changed drastically, but at this time, he had no way to fight back and could only use his sword to resist Lin Xiu’s attack.

But Lin Xiu’s attack was just too fierce, one stab after another, without the slightest pause.

“what!!!”

He roared angrily at this time and at the same time as the ‘Sphere’ on his body unfolded, his body directly retreated to the back.

Then, he swung the sword with both hands into the air!

In an instant, a huge sword phantom appeared in an instant, slashing toward Lin Xiu’s body!
