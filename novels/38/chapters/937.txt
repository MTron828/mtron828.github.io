Chapter 938: Extremely Arrogant

“Finally back.”

Standing at the gate here, Wu Jie said with a smile.

Uncle Fu and the others also smiled and they seemed to be very relaxed.

Yes, finally back.

“Master is back!”

“Master is back!”

And the guard at the door clearly saw the arrival of Wu Jie and others and said aloud.

Soon, after Wu Jie and others entered the Wu residence, Lin Xiu was assigned a guest room.

After taking a shower, Lin Xiu, who was originally a little dirty, became refreshed.

“Brother Lin?”

And at this moment, there was a knock on the door.

“Come in.”

Squeak-

As the door was opened, Wu Jie’s figure appeared at the door.

“Brother Lin, you really are a talented person!”

Wu Jie looked at Lin Xiu who was wearing clean clothes after washing up, his eyes lit up and he exclaimed in admiration.

Lin Xiu was handsome and had a good figure.

Although the body has strong muscles, it was not the bulging kind of muscles.

Very well-proportioned.

And with the continuous increase in strength, Lin Xiu now seems to have an indescribable aura around him.

“Thank you.”

Lin Xiu smiled and said.

In the desert, they rescued him so he obviously would rescue them too.

Moreover, these people are different from the warriors Lin Xiu met before and their hearts are all good.

After all, he had encountered too many warriors with bad intentions and it was very rare to encounter warriors with such good character.

“Brother Lin, come, I have prepared a meal, please come.”

Wu Jie laughed.

Lin Xiu didn’t stand on ceremony either and followed Wu Jie to the other side.

When he walked to the hall, he saw that many people were already seated at the long dining table.

Uncle Fu and others also washed up and sat here.

“Dad, Mom, this is my benefactor, Lin Xiu.”

“This is my father Wu Xiu and my mother Du Hui.”

Wu Jie walked over and introduced to a middle-aged couple with a smile.

“Thank you for saving Wu Jie and the others.”

They immediately smiled, picked up the wine glass by the dining table and said to Lin Xiu.

“Don’t mention it. Speaking of which, Wu Jie and the others also saved me.”

Lin Xiu smiled, then said to them while holding the wine glass beside the dining table and said.

He drank it all in one mouthful.

“Come on, sit down!”

“Brother Lin’s name is the same as father’s. It’s really fate.”

Wu Jie said with a smile after watching Lin Xiu take his seat.

“Yeah, it’s really fate.”

Wu Xiu looked very kind and kept smiling.

“Wu Jie, you guys really had it tough this time.”

Wu Xiu seemed to have thought of something at this time, looked at Wu Jie and the others and said with emotion.

“We didn’t have it tough, but those brothers who died…”

Wu Xiu seemed to have thought of something and his mood became depressed.

Uncle Fu’s face also turned ugly.

The whole atmosphere suddenly became weird.

Lin Xiu glanced at them, a little curious about what happened.

“Hahaha, come, eat first!”

Wu Xiu laughed loudly at this time and after breaking the awkward atmosphere, he said aloud.

But just as he finished speaking, there was a sound from outside.

“Eh? Not waiting for me to eat?”

As the voice rang out, the expressions of Wu Xiu and his wife changed drastically.

Wu Jie looked over at the door and when he saw the figures entering the door, his expression became extremely nasty.

“Xu Ba!”

Wu Jie looked at the young man who was walking in the front. He squeezed the wine glass with both hands and smashed the wine glass directly!

“What? I heard that you, Wu Jie, have already hunted down the Divine Fire Eagle? What about the odd crystals?”

Xu Ba looked at Wu Jie, then said with a grim smile.

The warriors who were with Xu Ba were also very arrogant.

“I’ve already got it. You guys just proceed as usual.”

Wu Jie looked at Xu Ba, then gritted his teeth and said.

Of course, I said, once you can get the odd crystal of the Divine Fire Eagle, I’ll release that old guy.”

“Oh, you don’t know how much your grandfather had suffered there…”

“Let go of my grandfather and I’ll give it to you!”

Wu Jie roared angrily at this moment and directly took out a fiery red crystal and threw it at Xu Ba.

Snapped–

Xu Ba took the Odd Crystal that Wu Jie threw over, looked at it and he could clearly see the fiery red Odd Crystal at this moment.

As if holding it in his hand, he could feel the warmth.

“Sure enough, the odd crystal of the Divine Fire Eagle.”

“It seems that those elites you brought with you really killed the Fire God Eagle huh.”

Xu Ba laughed.

Having said this, the faces of Wu Jie and the others became extremely ugly.

The Wu family did their best to kill the beast emperor, the Divine Fire Eagle and so many people died.

Moreover, after losing so many people, the Wu family’s power in Sand Sea City will plummet.

“Let my grandpa out!”

Wu Jie gritted his teeth and said.

“Tsk tsk, don’t worry, I have no interest in the old guy.”

Xu Ba laughed at this time.

Everyone in the Wu family has a lot of respect for their elders.

Moreover, Wu Jie’s grandfather was held hostage by them, so he had to save him.

He had to kill the Divine Fire Eagle.

“However, I am a little interested in your fiancee.”

Without waiting for Wu Jie and others to speak, Xu Ba continued to speak.

“What do you mean!?” Hearing Xu Ba’s words, the pupils in Wu Jie’s eyes shrank.

“I’ve already found someone to propose marriage to the Su family. I guess there will be results later.”

“I want Su Xue to be my concubine.”

“Tsk tsk, I wonder what your woman is like…”

Xu Ba continued to speak.

The words are extremely arrogant.

“Courting death!”

At this time, Wu Jie could no longer contain the anger in his heart.

He slammed the table top and flew directly towards Xu Ba!

With one palm, he was about to smack Xu Ba!

“Get lost!”

But at this moment, Xu Ba’s expression changed, he roared angrily and raised his hand too!

With the two palms facing each other, the domineering power of Xu Ba’s palm was passed on directly!

Boom—

Wu Jie’s body flew straight out!

He hit the dining table heavily.

The entire long dining table was directly broken into two!

“Wu Jie!”

Wu Xiu and Du Hui’s expressions changed when they saw their son being shot flying.

“Hmph, let me tell you, I am a Respected warrior now.”

Xu Ba glanced at Wu Jie and the others and said coldly.

Hearing his words, the angry faces of Uncle Fu and the others became even nastier.

The gap between Respected warrior and King warrior is too great! Moreover, the Wu family didn’t even have a warrior at the level of Respected warrior!
