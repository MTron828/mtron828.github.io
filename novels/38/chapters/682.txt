Chapter 683 Who Is the Pariah?

Liu Yanran’s parents wanted to say something, but they couldn’t say it now.

Although it was true that Liu Cheng was the first one to speak rudely, but the Liu family would not care about it. After all, Lin Xiu was equivalent to a ‘pariah’ in this city.

Lin Xiu smiled, holding the spear in his hand, and walked directly to the other side!

“Benefactor, wait!”

Not long after Lin Xiu went out, he heard a voice coming from behind. “What is it?”

Lin Xiu stopped, then looked at Liu Yanran curiously and said.

“This… there is our Marqi planet’s currency in it.”

Liu Yanran handed Lin Xiu a card and said aloud.

“Now that it’s getting dark, you can find a place to stay first. I’m really sorry about this.”

Liu Yanran said a little ashamed.

“No need.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

Liu Yanran was stunned. On the Marqi planet, there was a currency dedicated to Marqi and the currency on earth could not be used at all. “I will find a place to rest. The food tonight is good. Thank you for your hospitality.”

Lin Xiu smiled, the corners of his mouth curled up slightly, then he carried the long spear and walked away.

Under the light of the moonlight, Lin Xiu’s shadow was elongated.

Liu Yanran looked at this scene and stood there in a daze.

She had to admit that Lin Xiu’s personality was actually quite attractive to her. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“If only I was about the same age…”

Liu Yanran muttered to herself at this time.

“Pei pei pei, Liu Yanran, what are you thinking! How shameful!”

After coming to her senses at this time, Liu Yanran’s face flushed immediately, and then she cursed at herself.

After leaving Liu’s house and walking out of the street outside, Lin Xiu could clearly see that the street outside was brightly lit, like daylight.

There were still many warriors walking on the street.

“Hey, come over here, damn pariah!”

Just in the alley ahead, a loud noise made Lin Xiu frown.

He saw a group of warriors, pulling several men to the depths of the alley, and one of the men seemed to struggle for a while, and was immediately punched to the ground by a warrior.

“Don’t go too far!”

When another man saw this scene, he immediately shouted loudly, seemingly very angry. “Lei Tong?”

Lin Xiu seemed to see this familiar figure. He who wanted to leave suddenly stopped.

“Yo? You low-level pariah, you are quite arrogant.”

A warrior grabbed Lei Tong’s collar with both hands, and after lifting Lei Tong’s whole body to the air, he said with a grin.

“You let me go!”

At this time, Lei Tong was extremely angry and wanted to struggle, but the opponent’s strength was too great, and he couldn’t break free at all.

He never imagined that he would be treated like this on the first day he came to this city on Marqi planet. Most of the people in this city had light blue eyes, and people with black eyes like him are called low-level pariahs. “Let go of you? Hehe, pariah, I’ll sell you to the black market later, and cut off all your tendons and hamstrings. Maybe you can beg for some small money in Tianlong City.” The man laughed loudly at this time.

Hearing his words, the expression in Lei Tong’s eyes also changed greatly.

These people were really terrifying, and they were too strong to break free.

It’s over!

“Let him go.” At this moment, a voice came from the side.

The man who grabbed Lei Tong’s shirt’s collar frowned at this moment. He looked to the side and saw Lin Xiu standing there.

Looking at Lin Xiu’s obvious black pupils, the man burst into laughter: “It turns out to be another pariah from the earth, hahaha, you pariahs are really united…”

When he laughed out loud, in the next moment, his head was directly pierced.

Boom–

A large amount of blood sputtered out instantly.

The man opened his eyes wide, his eyes filled with disbelief.

He couldn’t believe that Lin Xiu speared so fast, and he couldn’t believe that he was pierced through his head like this.

But at this time he had no way to think about it because he had completely lost consciousness.

“Courting death!”

When the other men saw this scene, the expressions in their eyes also changed greatly.

Lin Xiu’s methods were really too cruel and he killed someone the moment he attacked. Those people from Marqi planet were also holding the weapons in their hands and began attacking Lin Xiu!

Dang dangBut with a single stroke of the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand, all the spears they were holding were knocked into the air.

In the next moment, as Lin Xiu swept his spear, all of these people were sent flying and slammed into the wall behind. “Brother Lin!”

Lei Tong said very excitedly at this time, he had no idea that he would meet Lin Xiu here.

And Lin Xiu’s strength was so strong.

“Are you okay.”

Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

“I’m fine.” Lei Tong shook his head and said aloud.

“Those people are so hateful, I was almost killed them.”

Taking a closer look, there was another man from Earth, who was brutally killed by these people.

Those who were kicked and flew out by Lin Xiu struggled to get up at this time, looking at Lin Xiu with eyes full of fear.

They had no idea how a pariah could have such a powerful force!?

But now they couldn’t think so much anymore and simply got up and run.

“Ha ha.”

Lin Xiu sneered and waved the Dark Edge spear in his right hand. At this moment, one after another of flaming bird charged towards the front in an instant!

Boom boom boom —

With a loud noise, in the next moment, you can clearly see the flaming birds flying out!

These warriors who wanted to escape turned around and saw the flaming birds, and the expressions in their eyes changed greatly.

But they couldn’t escape now. The flaming birds attacked their bodies, and the powerful and terrifying flames directly burned their bodies into black coals.

“Who are these people?”

After finishing everything, Lin Xiu asked. “They…they are people from Marqi City. They specialize in catching foreigners like us.” A man heard Lin Xiu’s words and said quickly.

The power that Lin Xiu showed just now was indeed beyond their imagination.

“The people from this Marqi planet are really arrogant. I just entered the city and they looked at me nastily.”

At this time, Lei Tong also clenched his hands into fists and said.
