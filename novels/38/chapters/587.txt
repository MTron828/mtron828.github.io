Chapter 588: A Library?

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

This warrior skill was a new diamond grade warrior skills that he cultivated from the combination of both the ‘Thousand Thunder’ and the ‘Flaming Leg’.

Although this skill was extremely powerful, it was still one that Lin Xiu wasn’t used to and plus, it would use up too much energy which was why he never used it.

Lin Xiu’s fist finally met with the fist of the rock monster and it instantly caused a loud sound.

Koong loong – – Koong Loong – –

This time, it was as if the planets had crashed onto each other as there was a huge explosion. The entire Tower of Trials started shaking tremendously once again.

As for those who were below on the ground around the Tower of Trials, they could feel it very strongly!

“What is happening?!”

“Why does the ground keep shaking?!”

Those who were meditating nearby were awakened as well by the loud explosion but they thought that it was just an earthquake and decided to ignore it.

Ka La – Ka La – –

On the other hand, as Lin Xiu fist collided with the rock monster’s huge fist, there were a large amount of cracks that were formed on the monster’s fist.

These cracks were slowly spreading to the other parts of the monster’s body!

Everytime the rock monster tried to move, it was followed by a crackling sound.

Right at that moment, its entire body exploded!

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing the Rock Monster. You have acquired 12.1 billion EXP!”

When Lin Xiu heard the notification that he had just gained a small amount of EXP, he wasn’t too surprised.

The rock monster may be rank 8 but it is one of the least powerful ones amongst those that are rank 8. There was still a lot of difference compared to the green snake that he had fought previously.

However, there was a large number of them that were attacking him very frequently and at a very fast speed.

Lin Xiu may have the ‘Disappearing Without A Trace’ but he had been hit for a few times.

Each time he was hit by the rock monster, he felt as if he had been crashed by a train and it caused a lot of pain all over his body.

If it wasn’t because he had unlocked the gene lock and he had an incredible recovery speed, Lin Xiu would have died from his internal injuries.

This floor seemed to have monsters that are of lower rank but the difficulty of it isn’t any lower than the ones before.

“Well, it is your turn next.”

Lin Xiu had been fighting these rock monsters for an entire day and night and now, he has complete control over the strength that he had just acquired.

The ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’ and the ‘Heavenly Split’ were skills that required him to use his inner strength and transport them onto his fist.

Lin Xiu grabbed onto his fit and was attacking the rock monsters like a crazy man. It was time to play rough!

Koong Loong – – Koong Loong – –

With Lin Xiu’s continuous attack, a large number of rock monsters slowly cracked and crumpled to the ground.

“Ding!’

“Congratulations Master for killing a rank 8 rock monster...”

As the rock monsters were slowly being killed by Lin Xiu, the notification in his head rang non stop as well.

After some time, the ringing in his head stopped and Lin Xiu laid down on the ground, completely exhausted.

All around him were the broken pieces of the rock monsters that he had just destroyed.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations master on another level up! You are not at level 38!”

Level 38?!

Lin Xiu was shocked when he heard the notification and while he was still in shock, he was completely covered by the pale purple glow and soon disappeared from that floor.

“He… he did it!”

Those who had their eyes locked onto Lin Xiu’s progress noticed that his name had been moved up to the 94th floor and all of them stared at it with their wide eyes as they couldn’t believe what they had just seen.

“He really is a monster...”

All the warriors who were around the tower were stunned with their jaws on the ground.

There was a growing number of people who were aware of the crazy man who challenged the 93rd floor. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Where am I?’

As soon as Lin Xiu was transported onto the next floor, he was still lying on the ground and decided to quickly stand up.

Lin Xiu felt strange as this floor was completely different from the ones before. It looked luxurious and there were lots of bookshelves that were filled with books.

These books seemed to be from a long time ago, ancient history.

In this world, hard copy books have already been eliminated.

But as he was surrounded by so many books, he felt as if he had just entered the royal library and he felt curious.

“Forget it. I will look at it later.” Lin Xiu looked at his Dark Edge that was next to him. Then, he sat down, crossed his legs and started cultivating.

However, Lin Xiu was surprised to find that his energy seemed to be sufficient.

As Lin Xiu activated the ‘Cultivation Technique’, there was a large amount of energy that Lin Xiu got to absorb into his body.

With the large amount of energy rushing into his body, Lin Xiu felt a warm feeling running through his entire body.

The exhaustion that he was feeling before had completely disappeared.

While cultivating, Lin Xiu decided to go into the system interface.

He had gotten a total of 38 potential points and most of them were for strength which was why he decided to separate them.

Lin Xiu didn’t think that he would be able to get onto the 38th level so easily. If this is how he would continue to progress, would it be possible for him to reach the 40th level while challenging the tower?

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but feel excited when he thought about it.

Level 40 would mean rank 8!

As he thought of the arrogant looks of those who were from the Sky City back when he was in the Thunder Valley, there was a burning rage inside Lin Xiu’s heart.

He will definitely go to Sky City!

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and calmed himself before opening his eyes to check his surroundings.

This place was just like a library with shelves everywhere and each of them were completely filled with books.

As he looked around, even the walls around the room were filled with shelves and were packed with books.

This floor….why was it so much different from the ones that he had been previously?

Lin Xiu was confused.

He continued walking and as he passed by one of the shelves, he placed his spear on the ground and picked up one of the books.

” ‘Basics of Punches’.”

Lin Xiu took out one of the books and he could see that it was one that was about fists and punches.

Now that they had the warrior skills cards that could be downloaded into their brains which help them learn the skills easily.

There was hardly anyone who would use hardcopy books like these.

As he opened the book, he noticed that it was a handwritten book and it had noted down the thoughts of the author about how to train and how to cultivate.

Lin Xiu flipped through it and at the very end of the book, there was a name: Zhang Kuang.

“Isn’t this....” When Lin Xiu saw the familiar name, his facial expression changed.
