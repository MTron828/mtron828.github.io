1324 These Two People Have Enmity?

Lin Xiu, who was attacking outside the ‘Sphere’ he unfolded, was slashed horizontally by this sword at this time and those clones of Lin Xiu were cut in half by the terrifying sword energy in an instant!

And the real Lin Xiu, at this time, quickly unfolded the ‘Sphere’ to block his blow.

However, the powerful impact still caused Lin Xiu’s body to retreat directly to the back.

“Sure enough, you are the real one…”

Looking at Lin Xiu who retreated to the back, Yang Tiantong, who had a gloomy face, gritted his teeth and said.

At this time, Lin Xiu held the White Moon spear in both hands and he clenched it a little bit harder.

This guy’s sword energy is indeed a bit strong, so it should not be underestimated.

“Yuan Zhen, nevermind that you’re not helping deal with this guy first.”

“However, now I want to kill this guy first. Why don’t you participate in our battle?”

Yang Tiantong looked towards Yuan Zhen and said.

At the beginning of the feeling, he thought Yuan Zhen was a blur young man and wanted to fool him into getting rid of Lin Xiu first.

But the facts have proved that powerful fighters were not fools.

“Sure.”

There was a faint smile on the corner of Yuan Zhen’s mouth.

no one would refuse this.

After all, it was a three-person melee and both of these two people suffered losses. No matter who was left in the end, it was extremely beneficial to him.

“You think you can defeat me?”

Lin Xiu laughed when he heard Yang Tiantong’s words.

This Yang Tiantong simply took it for granted, thinking that he would definitely win.

“A warrior at your level, you are still not my match!”

When Yang Tiantong heard Lin Xiu’s words, his face became even nastier.

As soon as he finished speaking, in the next moment, all the strength in his body burst out without reservation.

Boom, boom, boom——

As his power erupted, the entire battle platform seemed to start to shake.

It’s not just that the entire arena was affected, even the surrounding auditorium seemed to be able to feel a slight shaking.

“Huh? Does this kid want to fight your city lord first and let Yuan Zhen reap the benefits?”

The middle-aged man looked at the scene on the battlefield and said in surprise.

“No matter what, Lin Xiu will be the only one left on the battlefield.”

Baili Haoling said confidently.

The middle-aged man shook his head helplessly. This girl will know the cruelty of the matter later.

Lin Xiu will definitely lose when he fights against Yuan Zhen who is in perfect condition!

At this time, the blood-red source mark power on Yang Tiantong’s forehead was even more dazzling.

His body seemed to be covered with a faint blood-red power at this moment.

With the emergence of this blood-red power, the muscles of his body seemed to become more swollen at a speed visible to the naked eye.

The strength of the whole person is growing at an extremely fast rate!

Source mark that enhances physical strength?

Lin Xiu looked at this kind of source mark power and his eyes showed surprise.

Because this kind of source mark power is very rare.

From before to now, Lin Xiu has almost never seen him.

Moreover, Yang Tiantong’s increased strength is also very large, it’s almost like using ‘Fury’!

However, it is still less powerful than ‘Fury’.

“die!!!”

At this time, it seemed that the strength had grown to the extreme. Yang Tiantong let out a roar and disappeared in place with a ‘swoosh’ and appeared in front of Lin Xiu in an instant!

So fast!

This speed is much faster than when they fought just now!

The long sword in his hand also pierced at this moment.

Dangdangdang——

Lin Xiu’s reaction speed is still very fast. At this time, he held the White Moon spear in his hand to resist.

But Yang Tiantong’s offensive did not stop at all and the long sword in his hand attacked more violently.

At this time, Lin Xiu had no way to fight back. He could only use his long spear to resist his attack.

Click——

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu’s White Moon spear, because of the previous series of battles, now there are slight cracks appearing on the body of the spear.

But Lin Xiu obviously didn’t realize this.

Damn it!

...

Lin Xiu cursed secretly in his heart.

This Yang Tiantong seemed to have a grudge against him.

At this moment, all the strength in his body was unleashed unreservedly, wanting to kill him.

In this case, if Yuan Zhen makes a move next, both of them will be in danger.

However, Yuan Zhuo seemed to abide by what he said to Yang Tiantong just now, sitting on the ground at this moment, resting on his chin to watch the battle between the two.

“These two have enmity?”

Looking at this scene, Wan Gan couldn’t help being taken aback.

“not sure.”

Zhang Qinghua couldn’t help but smile bitterly. It was originally a three-person melee, but now it has become a two-person battle.

“Seems like Yuan Zhen is about to win.”

Wan Gan continued to speak.

...

Both of them fought with their strength, while Yuan Zhen didn’t consume any strength at all.

Next, Yuan Zhen should be able to win easily.

“It seems that Yuan Zhen and Xiao Qingchen will be in the finals.”

“It’s similar to what I guessed before. I want to see what will happen in the battle between the youngest and most powerful warriors from the north and the south.”

These fighters on the rostrum already felt that Yuan Zhen would undoubtedly win.

After all, no matter which side wins, Lin Xiu and Yang Tiantong will no longer be Yuan Zhen’s opponents.

“See where you can retreat to!!!”

Watching Lin Xiu resisting his attacks, Yang Tiantong became angrier and angrier.

Dangdangdang——

The sound of weapons colliding kept ringing out and Lin Xiu’s footsteps were about to retreat to the edge of the battle platform.

Feeling all this, Lin Xiu’s pupils shrank slightly.

With a thought, a white light was released from Lin Xiu’s body.

‘Purification Domain’ and ‘Heavenly Array’ were released at the same time. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Get lost!!!”

Just as Yang Tiantong stabbed with his sword again, Lin Xiu roared angrily.

Because of the power of the ‘Heavenly Array’, Lin Xiu’s power has obviously increased a lot.

Boom——

His source strength erupted and the powerful impact caused Yang Tiantong’s body, who wanted to continue attacking, to retreat to the back.

“Domain force!?”

Looking at the white light on the ground, Yang Tiantong’s face was ferocious.

“My domain force is stronger than yours!”

He roared angrily and wanted to release his domain force.

The blood-red light bloomed on his body.

These blood-red rays of light quickly surged toward the ground.

But when these rays of light first touched the white light on the ground, they disappeared immediately!

How is this possible?

Seeing this scene, Yang Tiantong’s expression changed drastically.

His domain force actually disappeared!

“Do you think that you are the only one who can use the source mark power?”

And at this moment, Lin Xiu’s voice came over.

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu’s forehead also had source marks blooming.

Not one source mark, but… three!!!
