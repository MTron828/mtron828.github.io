1197 Strange Power

“Talk a little too much nonsense.”

At this time, Lin Xiu, who was standing on the platform, looked at Sun Qi and said indifferently.

“You, today, will stay on this platform forever.”

Sun Qi’s eyes were full of intense light.

As soon as he finished speaking, he rushed toward Lin Xiu!

The moment he rushed out, his body instantly turned into six and charged toward Lin Xiu from all around!

“Cloning technique?”

Baili Haoling’s eyes changed slightly when she saw this scene.

This Sun Qi was not only able to use this cloning technique, but Baili Haoling can clearly feel that these six clones not only look exactly the same as him but also seem to have the same strength!

One couldn’t sense which one was fake!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he immediately raised his brows.

If it was just based on his own feelings, Lin Xiu really couldn’t tell which one was Sun Qi’s real body.

For warriors, this was a headache.

But for Lin Xiu, under the Analytic eye, Sun Qi has nowhere to hide.

“found you.”

Lin Xiu glanced around and his eyes narrowed slightly.

Now Sun Qi has split into six, all of them stabbing at Lin Xiu with a long sword.

And Lin Xiu, ignored the attacks of the other five clones, directly attacked one of them!

When Sun Qi saw Lin Xiu’s spear stabbed directly towards him, the look in his eyes shrank slightly.

How did he find out!?

It was too late for him to think about it. The long sword that had stabbed over instantly turned from attack to defense.

dang–

He directly used the body of the long sword to block Lin Xiu’s attack!

Although he quickly resisted Lin Xiu’s attack, the power of Lin Xiu’s attack was still very strong.

At this moment, Sun Qi could feel the numbness in his right hand holding the sword. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

At this time, Sun Qi’s other five clones also directly stabbed Lin Xiu’s body.

Seeing this scene, Baili Haoling couldn’t help but cry out in surprise.

But in the next moment, he discovered that Sun Qi’s clone directly pierced Lin Xiu’s body.

It didn’t cause any damage to Lin Xiu at all!

“What a powerful illusion…”

When Ling Yu and Sun Ruo saw this scene, they couldn’t help but say aloud.

Just now, they all felt that these clones seemed to have the strength of the main body, but they didn’t expect that all of them were illusions.

How did Lin Xiu differentiate?

Not only them but also the city lords of other cities were very surprised at this time.

Dang dang-

At this time, Lin Xiu ignored the expressions of everyone else and just wanted to kill this person.

After coming to the God warrior Realm, Lin Xiu discovered that even if he reached the God warrior level, there were still warriors who are stronger than him.

Now, he can only make himself stronger and stronger to be in control!

Damn!

Sun Qi looked at the long spear that Lin Xiu stabbed, then frantically swung his long sword to resist Lin Xiu’s attack.

While resisting, he stepped back.

Lin Xiu’s attacks were too fast and now he has no ability to fight back for a while.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s thoughts moved and the ‘Sky Covering Array’ skill was used directly.

The entire platform was covered with white light.

Under the blessing of ‘Heavenly Array’, Lin Xiu’s power surged wildly again.

Originally, while resisting Lin Xiu’s attack, Sun Qi secretly gathered his strength to fight back, but at this time he suddenly found that Lin Xiu’s attack was much stronger than before!

He was caught off guard and the long sword in his hand was thrown straight out!

After the long sword spun around in the air, it stabbed directly on the ground in front of Fu Tianling.

Just a little bit more and he was about to stab Fu Tianling.

Seeing this scene at this time, cold sweat broke out on Fu Tianling’s forehead.

He looked at the battle platform and the killing intent in his eyes became even stronger.

He wanted Lin Xiu to go to the platform just to humiliate and kill him.

But he didn’t expect that these warriors were not Lin Xiu’s opponents at all!

“All a bunch of trash.”

His face darkened.

“Get away from me!!!”

And Sun Qi, who was on the battle platform, saw that he was about to fall off the battle platform and the expression in his eyes suddenly changed greatly.

He was about to unleash his own domain force.

But what he didn’t expect, as soon as his domain force was released, he saw another burst of white light on Lin Xiu’s body.

Soon, the domain force he just released disappeared instantly!

how can that be!!!

Looking at this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

“Goodbye.”

Lin Xiu sneered, the Dark Edge spear in his hand was covered with dark blue flames at this moment.

With a wave of the spear, those dark blue flames formed a huge fire dragon and charged toward Sun Qi!

Boom—

This huge dark blue fire dragon filled Sun Qi’s entire body in the next moment!

This move is a skill that Lin Xiu realized based on ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’.

As the dark blue fire dragon hit Sun Qi’s body, the fire dragon quickly spun.

Formed a huge flame tornado.

The temperature of the surrounding air, at this moment, was burning hot.

The surrounding God warrior-level warriors felt the heat all over their bodies.

What a terrifying flame.

When Ling Yu and Sun Ruo saw this scene, they were even more shocked.

They didn’t even know just now that Lin Xiu was hiding such a powerful force.

“You…are you really from Lingxian City…”

Ling Yu couldn’t help muttering to himself at this time.

“what!!!”

But at this moment, Sun Qi, who was in the flame tornado, let out a loud roar.

Lin Xiu, who originally thought that this move should be able to cause serious damage to him, could not help but frown slightly.

Because Lin Xiu now sees a strong golden light emitting from Sun Qi’s body.

And these golden rays of light seemed to condense into a pair of armor at this moment, appearing on his body.

Sun Qi, who was originally hideous and seemed to be in severe pain, slowly began to look better.

What is this?!

Lin Xiu watched this scene, the pupils in his eyes could not help shrinking slightly.

“A mere skill, what can it do to me huh!!!”

Sun Qi roared, the armor that seemed to be formed by a special energy body completely blocked the power of those flames!

And at this moment, he had already rushed out of the flames and an incomparably fast punch hit Lin Xiu’s body!
