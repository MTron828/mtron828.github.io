Chapter 184: The Fire of Red Lotus

“It’s so dark…” Zhang Yin said aloud.

The inside of this building was completely dark and the visibility was very low.

“Ah!!!” Just then, Jiang Li suddenly felt his foot being pulled by something and he yelled in fright.

A rotten hand suddenly caught his foot!

Bang––

Zhang Yin saw this scene and rushed over. He lifted his weapon and slashed down, chopping off the rotten arm that had caught Jiang Li’s foot.

“Go to hell!!!” Jiang Li was taken aback, he looked at the body of a zombie lying on the ground and cut it directly!

Bang bang bang——

Its body was cut into several pieces in an instant.

Pa––

Li Ping also took out a small flashlight at this moment and everything around him became brighter.

When he saw this scene clearly, he couldn’t help but gasp.

There were a lot of corpses on the ground. They were wearing combat suits so it was clear that they were warrior zombies that got infected.

But what is weird was that their bodies seemed to be shriveled, as if the flesh and blood inside were sucked dry.

“It was already dead, you probably accidentally stepped on its hand.” Lin Xiu looked towards Jiang Li and said aloud.

Jiang Li was too nervous just now and scared himself instead.

“But, what are these things…” With the flashlight that Li Ping took out lighting up the place, Jiang Li could clearly see that the zombie’s corpse that had just been chopped into pieces seemed to have some blue things crawling out.

“It looks like bugs…” Zhang Yin also noticed those things and felt sick.

How could there be something like this in the corpses of these zombies?

Lin Xiu looked over there and saw the corpse of the zombie that Jiang Li had cut into pieces. It seemed that there were bugs coming out as well.

Without any hesitation, he activated the Analytic Eye.

“Rank 2 Blue-winged beetle (young), characteristics: creature from another dimension, strong reproductive ability, lives in the flesh of any creature and survives by eating the flesh of the host.

Seeing this, Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted.

It seemed that the inside of all the corpses on the ground was filled with these darn things?

With that thought, Lin Xiu had goosebumps.

He picked up the Dark Edge spear and directly poked at the few Blue-winged beetles that had crawled out.

Bang bang bang——

Their bodies exploded in an instant.

There was too little experience killing these things to be worth mentioning at all.

“Be careful, there are probably still many of these strange bugs in the corpses of these zombies. Don’t step on the corpses.” Lin Xiu warned.

If these darn things ran into his body, it would really be trouble.

“En.” Zhang Yin and the others nodded, the situation here was too weird, and now they were also very cautious and serious.

They continued walking and soon, they saw a ray of light. At the end of the first floor was a huge French window, but because there was a lot of blood and spider webs on it, they couldn’t really see the scene behind.

With a wave of the Dark Edge spear, Lin Xiu released a flaming bird and all the spider webs were burned.

“I see it…!!!” As the large number of spider webs blocking the front were burned, Li Ping shone her torchlight and she could see that in the courtyard, there seemed to be a huge shadow.

Lin Xiu strode over and walked out through the French windows directly. When he reached the courtyard behind, his eyes widened.

In the space above, a huge crack appeared. It seemed that the space had been torn open and it was pitch-black inside with flashes of lightning from time to time.

On the ground of the courtyard, there were a lot of dark blue stones, which seemed to have fallen from the space crack.

This huge courtyard was like a small park covered in dark blue stones.

There were many weird cracks on the stone. No, not cracks, they looked more like a pattern.

“So many stones…” Zhang Yin and the others said to themselves as they looked at these weirdly shaped stones with their mouths wide open.

Luo Yue had already walked forward and with the sword in her hand, she slashed hard at the stones.

Dang——

The long sword hit the stone and it sounded like metals colliding.

“It should be some kind of metal that is very hard.” Luo Yue observed it carefully and said aloud.

Lin Xiu also prodded it with his Dark Edge spear. It was true. These things looked like stones, but they seemed to be some kind of special metal.

At this moment, there was still some white smoke emitting from these things like they had fallen not long ago and the impact caused a part of it to burn.

“It should be pretty good if we brought them back to make weapons, huh?” Li Ping looked at the stones and said in surprise.

“Could it be possible that only these stones were dropped from this space crack?” Zhang Yin said curiously.

There should be other things in these space cracks, such as beasts.

But this space crack was so big yet there was nothing around it.

“Let’s go over there and take a look.” Lin Xiu stepped on these weird ‘stones’ and continued to walk forward.

Luo Yue also followed closely next to Lin Xiu and the two of them jumped to the front quickly.

“Wait for us!!!”

When they arrived at this group of stones, they saw that the stones ahead looked as if something had made them turn red.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue both felt it and the surroundings seemed to become hot.

As Lin Xiu got closer, the burning sensation becomes stronger and the surrounding temperature exceeded at least fifty degrees. As Lin Xiu got closer, the temperature increased drastically.

He took a closer look and the area in front, even the surrounding air seemed to be distorted due to the scorching heat.

“What is this?!” He tolerated the scorching temperature and continued walking. Then, Lin Xiu found a huge sunken area in the middle of the group of stones. Below that, there was a fiery red lotus. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

No, it wasn’t a lotus, it was like a special red lotus made up of energy bodies!

“Red Lotus Fire!?” When Luo Yue saw this, she revealed a shocked expression on her usually expressionless countenance.
