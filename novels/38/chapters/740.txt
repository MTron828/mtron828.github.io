Chapter 741: Obtaining the Source Mark

The land of the source mark.

This was a unique place in the Ice and Snow City.

Every year, they would be able to attract lots of warriors here for a visit.

Since there were ancient source marks that were carved onto the stone walls here.

These source marks were here because the master warriors previously had carved their own onto the walls.

As time passed, there were more and more source marks present on the wall.

For those who have not become master warriors or have master warriors that have not gotten their source mark, they would usually pay a visit here so that they could get the energy from these source marks that have been left behind.

“You have to be at least a rank 9 warrior in order to enter.”

Soon, Lin Xiu and Qian Jing walked into the area.

This place looked like a canyon and right in front, there were lots of staff that were guarding the area.

“Rank 8 are not allowed to enter.”

There was a warrior who wanted to enter the space but as soon as he reached the entrance, the machine located there detected his abilities and was immediately stopped by the staff.

He was unhappy about it and wanted to raise his voice but in the end, he still walked away silently.

“Did you have to pay for this?”

Lin Xiu looked at the place that resembled a tourist attraction before asking Qian Jing.

This was because Lin Xiu noticed a few people who were collecting things on the side. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Of course, 5 thousand gold.”

Qian Jing nodded his head as he answered.

On the Marqi Planet, the currency that was commonly used was gold but most of them wouldn’t carry it around. It was more common for them to use cards or apps that they downloaded onto their phones.

Lin Xiu did not like this bit as the technology on this planet was much more advanced than the one back on earth but the way that they dealt with payment was a little troublesome.

“Perhaps you...” Qian Jing thought about something and was feeling a little helpless.

“En. I’ll have to borrow yours. I have got no money now.”

Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders.

Qian Jing pursed his lips but as he thought about how he was the one who dragged Lin Xiu here, he had no other choice.

After paying the entrance fee, they had to walk through a machine. Upon making sure that they were rank 9 warriors, they were finally allowed to enter.

As he took a closer look, there were quite a number of warriors around.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but narrowed his eyes in suspicion when he saw what was happening.

In fact, compared to earth, there were too many rank 9 warriors on this planet.

“Look, this is a source mark!”

As they continued walking through the canyon, Qian Jing moved his fingers across the wall and showed it towards Lin Xiu.

There were professionals to clean the snow that was left behind on the walls so that they could easily view the source marks that were carved onto the wall.

There were an array of source marks on the wall; some were simple while the others seemed complicated.

There were also descriptions written below the source mark that showed what the source marks represented.

The master warriors who carved their source marks onto the wall were definitely those who have reached the end of their lives. They knew that they were about to die.

Otherwise, no warriors would lightly expose the power of their source mark.

“There are also source marks of the warrior kings that have been carved onto the wall!”

Qian Jing looked at the source marks that were all over the wall and he looked extremely excited.

Lin Xiu turned around as well, looking towards where Qian Jing was pointing at.

It was definitely one that was different from the rest as it was much bigger.

Plus, it looked much more complicated than the others.

This resulted in a larger crowd standing in front of the source mark.

“I don’t even understand this.”

Some of the warriors shook their heads after looking at it for a long time.

“It is indeed complicated.”

Qian Jing fornwed as well. After turning into a master warrior, you wouldn’t naturally gain your source mark. One would have to cultivate and gain a source mark that belonged to them.

Most of them who had just entered the stage would find difficulty gaining their source mark.

However, these source marks had great power and once they are able to obtain it, it would be similar to them getting a new ability.

According to the description on the wall, there were defence and offence types of source marks.

For defence, Lin Xiu had already seen it on Wu Changkong and he didn’t think that there was anything special with it.

As for the offence source marks, there was a huge variety of it and they would be of any elements including wind, thunder, fire and electric.

In between these two, there were still spacial source marks.

But, there were many warriors who would be able to obtain such marks.

That’s when Lin Xiu noticed that there was a spacial source mark on a wall that was nearby.

It wasn’t a large one but it looked complicated and according to it, it belonged to a master warrior.

Most of the audience were looking at the mark that the warrior king left behind and in comparison to that, there weren’t many people looking at this source mark.

For a source mark...

Lin Xiu could easily obtain his source field when he became a rank 9 warrior but as for a source mark, Lin Xiu had no idea what he should do.

Lin Xiu looked at the source mark on the wall and frowned.

He was different from the rest. Instead of looking at the one left behind by the warrior king, Lin Xiu was staring at the spacial source mark.

“Lin Xiu?”

When Qian Jing turned around, he noticed that Lin Xiu was gone.

He took a good look around before finding Lin Xiu at another corner.

“The warrior king’s mark is over there.”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was captivated by a small, common source mark, Qian Jing decided to remain Lin Xiu.

“Stop talking.”

At that moment, Lin Xiu was in a special zone and his eyes were closed as well.

Qian Jing was stunned but soon noticed that there were a large amount of black materials that were gathered on top of Lin Xiu’s forehead.

Lin Xiu did not feel much earlier but after staring at the source mark on the wall, he noticed that the energy in his body started flowing and they were pumping energetically.

Soon, all of the energy formed these black particles and they slowly gathered on top of his head.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

It looked as if Lin Xiu was writing a book on his forehead but then, a black light appeared on top of Lin Xi’s forehead.

“Why is there a black light...?!”

Qian Jing’s jaw fell to the ground when he saw what was happening and his face was filled with disbelief.

One of the warriors nearby was surprised as well as he screamed out loud.

“Look! Over there! There’s someone gathering his source mark!”

Other warriors noticed what was happening and immediately started screaming when they realised what was happening.

Although it wasn’t the first time that this had happened, it was still a rare occasion.

With the warriors screaming and shouting, there was a huge crowd that gathered around Lin Xiu.

The bright black light was still shining on his forehead and they were moving like a river flow. So, it looked like a source mark that was incredibly complicated.

“Source mark! It really is a source mark...”

Qian Jing widened his eyes in shock.
