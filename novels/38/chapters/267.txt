Chapter 268: Whose Fist Is Stronger

They were making a pincer attack from the front and wanted to kill Lin Xiu directly!

But at this moment, Lin Xiu disappeared!

The fist of the warrior who used ‘Fiery Fist’ directly pounded against the saber that the man had swung over.

“Ah!!!”

Although he used ‘Fiery Fist’ and his fist became harder, he didn’t have any gloves in his hand after all. At this time, he smashed the saber that the middle-aged man had swung over at such a fast speed and the blade of this saber sliced into his fist!

The intense pain caused him to cry out at this moment.

“Where did he go!?”

The middle-aged man hurriedly used his force to pull out the saber from his fist and said in surprise.

He really did not expect that Lin Xiu just disappeared like that!

How could he move so quickly?!

He was still in shock when he heard a voice coming from behind him.

“You guys only have this little strength?”

At this moment, Lin Xiu had somehow appeared behind the middle-aged man and said indifferently.

The man who was just attacked by Lin Xiu was still shaking and twitching constantly on the ground.

Lin Xiu’s ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’ could already be used to its fullest potential with his current strength.

Even if the man was a peak rank 5 warrior, this punch would still be quite unbearable.

Unless he has been trained in high-voltage electric shock resistance, he would definitely be unable to withstand this powerful current.

“What kind of person are you!?” The middle-aged man turned around suddenly and asked Lin Xiu.

It really surprised him how Lin Xiu dodged the attacks of the two of them so easily!

And Lin Xiu actually appeared behind him, even he himself was dumbstruck for a while.

Now he didn’t regard Lin Xiu as an ordinary warrior. After all, from the strength that Lin Xiu displayed just now, even a fool would know that Lin Xiu was almost the same rank as him or higher.

“A man.” Lin Xiu smiled and replied.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, a ferocious glint appeared in the middle-aged man’s eyes and he said with a grimace, “Good kid, how arrogant huh.”

“It was just that we were careless just now, this time, I will kill you… kill!”

As soon as he spoke, he used force on his legs and continued to charge towards Lin Xiu!

The saber in his hand was already radiating a hint of cold light and with a strong saber technique, he slashed towards Lin Xiu.

Swish swish swish——

With the continuous swing of the saber in his hand, the sounds kept ringing.

Lin Xiu’s gaze changed at this moment. This saber was not an ordinary saber and his slashing speed was also very fast. If he accidentally got hit and cut himself, he would be in danger.

With that thought, Lin Xiu focused and relied on his extremely fast reaction to dodge at lightning speed!

Lin Xiu was like a shadow, no matter how fast his saber moved, Lin Xiu dodged it!

“‘Do or Die’!!!”

The middle-aged man saw that Lin Xiu avoided every slash perfectly and his expression changed drastically. He roared out and held the hilt of the saber with both hands, then slashed harder!

As he swung the saber, it brought about a majestic source strength and created a huge sword aura!

Lin Xiu stood there, watching the huge sword aura slashing towards him and appeared as if he wasn’t going to dodge at all.

Boom——

The saber slashed and the surrounding ground was shaking.

A huge and bottomless gully appeared instantly across the ground!

“Dead, huh?”

“Did you really think you could dodge it?”

The middle-aged man said coldly at this time.

Although Lin Xiu was very fast and avoided many of his attacks.

But this move was his best skill and it was very swift, it also covered a wide area so there was no way Lin Xiu could dodge it.

At this moment, there was thick dust everywhere, making it even more challenging to see the situation on the already dimmed streets.

“Boss… Boss…”

Just when the middle-aged man heaved a sigh of relief, the man who just used the ‘Fiery fist’ behind him seemed to notice something and his eyes were full of shock and fear.

“What is it?”

Hearing this man’s words, the middle-aged man frowned and was about to say something when his eyes suddenly widened.

He sensed that something was wrong and his pupils constricted.

When he turned his head to look, he saw a fist covered in lightning coming towards him!

Boom——

This punch was so suddent that the middle-aged man had no chance to dodge at all.

Lin Xiu’s fist hit his forehead directly and there was a huge cracking sound!

Bang– UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

In the next moment, the man’s head exploded!

His body was still standing upright, but his head has been blasted off.

This scene looks very bloody, making the man behind him tremble.

“Do you still want to kill and rob?” Lin Xiu waved his right hand, shaking the blood off his fist and faintly said to the man in front.

The man’s eyes were so wide open like his eyeballs were about to fall out.

He looked at Lin Xiu with his eyes filled with horror.

Terrifying, it was really terrifying. He never thought that his boss, a peak rank 5 warrior who was about to advance to a rank 6 warrior, would die so easily under Lin Xiu’s hands.

And he even died in the hands of a young man!

“You… don’t come over…”

The man said while trembling.

He didn’t have any will to fight now and his body seemed to have lost all its strength at this time.

The strength that Lin Xiu has just displayed was completely overwhelming. With such a terrifying opponent, how could he have the guts to resist?

“Sorry, it’s too late now.”

Lin Xiu said faintly at this time.

At this moment, flames covered Lin Xiu’s fists.

The flame of Lin Xiu’s fist was very red and the surrounding air seemed to have become distorted because of the hot temperature!

“I shall let you find out whose fist is stronger!”
