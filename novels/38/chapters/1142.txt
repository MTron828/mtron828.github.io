1143 Upgrading Instantly!!

Boom – –

Then, as Lin Xiu thrusted his long spear towards the energy barrier that was already covered with cracks, there was a loud explosion.

The energy barrier instantly exploded!

“Kill them!!!!!”

Sima Qiang and the rest of them waited for Lin Xiu to break the energy barrier and as soon as that was done, they led a large group of warriors into the Holy City!

The warriors of the Bai family who were in the Holy City rushed out of the city as well!

The warriors from both parties started fighting vigorously with each other.

There were also large numbers of drones in the air that were releasing laser beams.

There were loud and huge explosions that filled with entire ground.

Bai Lin had his eyes fixed on Lin Xiu. Then, he led a group of warriors and headed towards the sky.

Their target was none other than Lin Xiu.

At this moment, all of the members of the Bai family were aware of Lin Xiu and they knew that the strongest member was Lin Xiu as well.

As long as Lin Xiu was dead, their enemies would definitely lose!

“Young man!!!!! You’re dead now!!”

Bai Lin screamed as he rushed into the sky.

“You got your arm back?”

Lin Xiu didn’t even look nervous with a huge group of warriors coming at him. He waved the long spear in his arm and then released the flaming birds towards the laser cannons so that they could be destroyed.

“Kill him!!”

After hearing what Lin Xiu asked, Bai Lin’s face looked awful.

The man screamed and there were about 50 sage warriors that started attacking Lin Xiu!

All of them had their source mark lit up. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

They were using the energy from their source mark and there was a large amount of energy that went straight for Lin Xiu!

Seeing what was happening, Lin Xiu still didn’t look frightened.

As Lin Xiu gathered his thoughts, he activated both ‘Heavenly Array’ and ‘Purification Domain’.

The energy from their sourcemark was completely blocked by Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’.

Lin Xiu was not injured at all!

Prepare for an upgrade!

Lin Xiu was getting excited when he saw the sage warriors near him.

There was at least 50 of them here.

All of them were the elites of the Bai family and these sage warriors would definitely bring a vast amount of EXP to Lin Xiu.

He only needed a little more to reach the next level.

It should be enough once he killed all these sage warriors.

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate and immediately used ‘Rage’!

He was already much stronger than the ordinary sage warriors and as he activated ‘Rage’, his abilities rose to an even higher level!

‘Mirror Image’!

Then, Lin Xiu activated another skill.

There were 5 figures of Lin Xiu that appeared in the air.

The effect of ‘Mirror Image’ was getting stronger as well.

Not only was he able to get 5 split images of him, each figure would have 40% of the strength that Lin Xiu had!

“What the...”

Bai Lin’s eyes were filled with shock.

It was obvious that all five figures of Lin Xiu had a vast amount of energy.

“Go!!!”

As Lin Xiu screamed, all five figures raised their long spear and started attacking the sage warriors!

Clang clang – –

Instantly, there was a loud commotion from their weapons colliding with each other.

Lin Xiu held onto the long spear and moved it frantically in the air.

With each movement, there were a large number of dark blue flaming birds that appeared.

Each was headed towards the sage warriors!

Bai Lin quickly raised his arms and all of the metals found around them gathered on Bai Lin’s hands.

He moved his arms and soon all of the metals were formed into a huge metal ball.

Bai Lin sneered. Then, with his left hand, he threw the huge metal ball to Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu, who was busy attacking the other warriors, saw the huge metal ball that was coming at him and narrowed his eyes.

He immediately turned his long spear towards the metal ball!

Boom – –

The huge metal ball that was headed toward Lin Xiu, suddenly turned directions and went towards Bai Lin.

When Bai Lin saw what happened, his pupil narrowed subconsciously.

He immediately shifted his body in order to dodge the ball.

The huge metal ball then landed on one of the sage warrior’s bodies.

The ball was moving too quickly. It was too fast.

The impact from it was incredibly scary as well.

The sage warrior that got hit was then immediately thrown onto the ground.

As the metal ball crashed onto the ground, it let out a huge explosion.

The entire ground started shaking vigorously.

Bai Lin, who managed to move aside, felt his heart racing.

This boy…..how did he become so powerful?!

“AHHHHH!!!!!”

At the same time, there were cries that filled the air and it was followed by the bodies of the sage warriors who fell from the sky.

These were sage warriors but they looked as if they were just weak, lowly warriors that were being killed by Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s split images were even more powerful than these sage warriors!

‘Heaven Breaking Strike’!!!

Seeing how there weren’t many warriors left, Lin Xiu then transferred a large amount of energy into the tip of his spear.

Then, he immediately swept it around the sage warriors.

All of them have already released their ‘sphere’ but the power of Lin Xiu’s attack was too overwhelming.

Especially how Lin Xiu was already so powerful, the energy that he had released was even scarier than before.

As the warriors took the impact from the attack, not only did their ‘sphere’s explode, even their body was blasted into tiny pieces because of the terrifying energy.

The notification kept ringing in Lin Xiu’s mind as his EXP grew.

These weren’t enough! They weren’t enough!

He has already killed so many sage warriors and his progress bar was only at 95%!

He was still short of 5% before upgrading to another level!

Damn it!

As Lin Xiu cursed under his breath, he looked around him and could see that the only sage warrior left standing was Bai Lin.

With the control of his mind, all of his split images flew to the ground.

They were sent off to fight the warriors from the Bai family.

“Well, you’re next.”

Lin Xiu’s body shifted and he instantly appeared in front of Bai Lin.

Bai Lin was caught off guard when he saw Lin Xiu standing right in front of him.

Then, he subconsciously released his ‘sphere’ in order to block Lin Xiu’s attack.

Boom – –

As Lin Xiu’s spear landed in his ‘sphere’, there was a loud sound that came from it.

There were cracks all over his ‘sphere’.

He couldn’t even block one single attack from Lin Xiu!
