Chapter 359: Alien Ore

Lin Xiu was a little puzzled when they said “stealing things”.

Was there something stolen in the Deep Blue City!?

“You didn’t cooperate with the inspection!” When the men heard Lin Xiu’s words, their expressions suddenly changed and they shouted.

Lin Xiu sneered. Just as he was about to say something, Luo Yue, who had been quiet, looked at the middle-aged man and said faintly, “Zeng Ruo.”

The middle-aged man, who was about to order the warriors behind to arrest Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, had a sudden change in expression when he heard Luo Yue’s words and he looked at Luo Yue – a girl who looked cold but extremely beautiful.

“You are…”

Swish——

The words had just left his mouth when Luo Yue waved her right hand and tossed out a black object that rushed directly to the middle-aged man.

Snapped–

At this moment, the middle-aged man waved his right hand and caught the thing in his hand.

He looked at that object and his face suddenly changed.

Lin Xiu was taken aback and also a little puzzled. The object that Luo Yue tossed out just now seemed like a seal.

And after this person saw it, he appeared shocked, which made Lin Xiu curious.

“Everyone, step down!”

Some warriors were about to surround Lin Xiu and Luo Yue. Just then, the middle-aged man suddenly shouted loudly.

Hearing his words, these warriors were stunned for a moment, their eyes all looked at the man whom Luo Yue called Zeng Ruo.

They saw that their captain Zeng Ruo’s face seemed to become very cautious.

They had not seen their captain look this way before and were very confused.

“Arrest them and punish them!” Then, Zeng Ruo glanced at the men who were sent flying by Lin Xiu and said coldly.

“Captain, it’s them…” Hearing Zeng Ruo’s words, the expressions of these people changed and when they wanted to say something, the other warriors grabbed them away.

“Leave a few people over there to continue the security check, you all can go off first, I have something to say to them.” Zeng Ruo gave his men a cold look and said aloud.

“Yes! Captain!”

Hearing Zeng Ruo’s words, those warriors left immediately.

Lin Xiu looked at Zeng Ruo with a hint of curiosity – what is going on!?

“Miss Luo.” Zeng Ruo knelt on the ground at this time and said.

Lin Xiu was taken aback when he saw this scene.

Miss Luo!?

Could it be that he knows Luo Yue? No, it should be because of what Luo Yue just showed him.

“Get up.” Luo Yue stared at him and said faintly.

Yes. Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Zeng Ruo nodded at this time then slowly stood up.

Zeng Ruo’s expression seemed very respectful now, which made Lin Xiu very curious.

“I’m really sorry, my subordinates were rude.” Zeng Ruo looked at Luo Yue, then at Lin Xiu, and said apologetically.

“What happened?” Luo Yue ignored Zeng Ruo’s words at this time and asked directly.

Zeng Ruo was startled when he heard Luo Yue’s words then sighed and said, “I am now the captain of the guard of the Deep Blue City…”

From what Zeng Ruo said, Lin Xiu found out that a very precious alien ore was stolen from the tower in the center of the Deep Blue City the day before yesterday!

That piece of ore was very rare. A weapon made from this ore would definitely be an amazing weapon.

“The size of the ore is not small and when it was lost, we were on guard at all times. If the thief leaves with this thing, the alarm here will sound and it would be impossible for them to take it away.”

Zeng Ruo said firmly.

At the same time, Lin Xiu looked towards the sky and he could see that there were many aircrafts in the sky, guarding the entire sky.

If someone wants to leave by the flying machine, they will definitely be spotted.

“It’s not found yet?” Lin Xiu walked over at this time and said to Zeng Ruo.

Zeng Ruo nodded and looked at this teenager who was in the same grade as Luo Yue. Although he didn’t know the specific background of Lin Xiu, people who could be with Luo Yue must be from a good background.

With this thought, he appeared very respectful towards Lin Xiu as well.

“We didn’t find it, but I believe that this person is still here.” Zeng Ruo said.

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu became curious about this so-called alien ore.

What ore is it that can mobilize the entire army of the Deep Blue City?

“Let’s go.” Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu, looked at the other side, and said aloud.

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu nodded and when he was about to walk forward, Zeng Ruo stopped in front of Luo Yue and said, “Miss Luo, it’s getting late now. How about I arrange your accommodation?”

“No need.” Luo Yue shook her head.

Zeng Ruo seemed a little disappointed when he heard Luo Yue’s refusal, but because of Luo Yue’s background, he still wanted to be courteous.

“Then you must be careful.” Zeng Ruo nodded and said.

“By the way, do you have any information about the ore? And the person who stole the ore, did you see what he looked like on the monitor?” Lin Xiu said to Zeng Ruo.

“This…” Zeng Ruo was stunned. After all, this information was confidential and cannot be mentioned casually.

He appeared to be in a difficult spot at this moment.

“Let’s take a look.” Luo Yue said lightly.

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Zeng Ruo, who was still hesitant, gritted his teeth then said aloud, “You can’t show this to others.”

Zeng Ruo said, then took out a special silver card and handed it to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu didn’t stand on ceremony and simply took it. Then, he looked at the silver card, touched it gently and the card seemed to have become a high-definition display. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

A dark blue object appeared on the card in the form of a 3D projection.

“Don’t look here!”
