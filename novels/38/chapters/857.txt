Chapter 858: Crushed (1)

The surrounding audience had all dispersed already.

Only Bai Litao and others from Sacred region academy were left.

“So many warriors!”

At this time, Baili Haoling’s pupils also shrank slightly.

He could feel that from all directions, a large number of powerful warriors rushed over.

The auras of these warriors are very powerful and they are on the same level as hers. No, they may even be stronger than her!

how is this possible! How could so many warriors with such powerful strength suddenly appear on the earth?

Feeling all this, the look in Baili Haoling’s eyes changed slightly.

“You guys go!”

At this time, Lin Xiu looked at Baili Haoling and the others behind him.

“But...”

When Baili Haoling wanted to say something, Bai Litao said with a grim expression, “Let’s go, let’s go.”

In the current situation, if they stay here, not only will they not be of much help, but they will become a hindrance.

“Go!”

Baili Haoling just hesitated for a moment, then said aloud.

“If there is anything, go to Luo’s family.”

Lin Xiu said. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Luo Yue and Luo Yan have both improved a lot in their current strength, especially Luo Yue, who has reached the existence of King warrior and after cultivating Purple gold-level skills, their strength is also very strong.

After returning, Luo Yue and Luo Yan were going back to Luo’s house. Because Lin Xiu knew about the match here, he came to take a look first and these things happened.

Lin Xiu stood in the middle without any movement.

Soon, a large number of people flew over.

All of these people seem to be able to use levitation and they were all suspended in the air.

There were almost dozens of people.

The battle uniforms these people wear are very strange, different from the uniforms that appear on Earth.

It seems to be higher tech.

And if you look closely, the skeletons of these people seem to be larger than ordinary people on earth.

All of them are strong men over two meters.

“Huh? An earthling killed our people?”

One of the men who seemed to be the leader looked at Lin Xiu below and said indifferently.

“Where did you guys come from?”

These people can speak Chinese. Although Lin Xiu was a little surprised, he didn’t feel puzzled.

After all, with the current technology, it is not too difficult to learn a language.

“You don’t need to know about that, lowly earthlings.”

One of the men said lightly.

“kill him.”

As soon as he finished speaking, several men, at this moment, directly attacked Lin Xiu!

boom boom boom —

These people used all kinds of skills and burst out with a loud noise.

Whizzing–

Lin Xiu watched them use the power of skills to charge and the spear in his hand suddenly slashed.

The head of the man who attacked first was chopped off.

Instant kill!

Those who were suspended in the air, at this time, their eyes could not help but widen and their pupils shrank.

They couldn’t believe that an Earthling killed their people in one second!

“Courting death! Low-level earthlings!”

The man at the head roared and directly led the remaining dozens of warriors, charging down from the sky!

Lin Xiu raised his eyes and looked at the people who charged down, his eyes narrowed slightly.

With a wave of the Dark Edge spear in his hand, terrifying flaming birds burst out.

The scorching temperature of the flaming birds sent out distorted the surrounding air.
