Chapter 494: The Auction

When the rest of them heard what Lui Wei said, all of them spoke up.

They couldn’t help as their body trembled. Not only were they afraid of Lin Xiu, but they were also more afraid of Luo Yue. They were worried that if they made her unhappy, she would chop them into two!

Lui Wei and his soldiers were surprised as well when they saw how these men reacted.

These criminals were begging to be arrested.

“By the way, the person who hired them is from the Zhao family. You will be fair and square in regards to this issue, right?” Lin Xiu looked at Lui Wei and asked.

“Of course.” Lui Wei nodded his head. Although he had wanted to capture Lin Xiu, who was at the hospital, in the afternoon after receiving a phone call, Lui Wei was still someone who was righteous.

“We will do a thorough investigation.”

“Alright then.” Lin Xiu nodded his head and turned towards Luo Yue.

He smiled and said. “Let’s go.”

“En.”

After seeing them leave, Lui Wei instructed his soldiers as well and said, “Bring them back to the station!”

“Yes Sir!”

“I already looked up about them.” When both of them were taking the elevator, Luo Yue suddenly spoke to Lin Xiu.

“What did you look up?” Lin Xiu was stunned as he asked.

“The Zhao family.” Luo Yue answered as she passed her phone over to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu took her phone and the first thing that he noticed wasn’t what was being shown on the screen; instead, he was more interested in the phone that was as thin as a card and it was covered in pink.

“Your phone is pink in color. It looks cute.” Lin Xiu teased.

When Luo Yue heard the word ‘cute’, she reached out, trying to get her phone back but Lin Xiu turned around and prevented her from getting it.

“Alright. Fine. I’ll stop. Let me see.” Lin Xiu laughed.

He took a good look at the information that was on the screen and all of it was about the Zhao family of Bai Di City.

If it wasn’t because he was reading it, Lin Xiu would have never known that the Zhao family was really powerful and has massive influential power in Bai Di City.

The family was involved in both politics and business which was why that prick was so arrogant.

As they got down to the ground, Lin Xiu took a look at the street ahead of them and there were a lot of people headed in that direction.

“Why don’t we take a look around?” Lin Xiu said towards Luo Yue.

The Bai Di City was well known for its trades and the streets around them were filled with Itinerant merchants.

The meaning of an ‘itinerant merchant’ was those who sold things on the street that they have found in other places.

There were a lot of them and would be selling things at random locations every time.

They would sell things like skill cards, combat suits, weapons…

If they were lucky, they might be able to find some treasures here.

Luo Yue thought about it and nodded her head.

Lin Xiu took out her phone and called Ye Shuanger.

“Brother Lin Xiu?! Are you alright?!” On the other end of the phone call, Ye Shuanger exclaimed in joy.

“Of course. Those men have been arrested.” Lin Xiu laughed as he replied to her question.

“That’s great.” Ye Shuanger let out a breath of relief.

“Oh, by the way, I will be going out with Luo Yue now. We will come back later.”

“En!”

“Let’s go!” After informing Ye Shuanger about their whereabouts so that she wouldn’t worry, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue started walking down the busy streets.

After a short period of time as they got to the corner at the end of the street, Lin Xiu saw that there were a group of warriors who were selling things as well.

In their stores, not only do they have skill cards, there were combat suits, weapons, and even treasures from ancient time.

As Lin Xiu and Luo Yue walked towards it, there were a lot of them on the streets that looked at them.

Since Lin Xiu was handsome and Luo Yue was gorgeous, both of them were a beautiful pair.

“Brother, would you like to have a look?” The man who owned the store next to Lin Xiu asked.

“I have lots of skill cards from all sorts of genres…”

Lin Xiu took a look at the things that the man had to offer. The skill cards that he had were of Platinum and Gold levels which were useless for Lin Xiu now. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

But these skill cards had different patterns that seemed old. They looked like they were from a decade ago.

Perhaps, he would be able to get some long-lost skill cards in these streets.

They continued walking forward and soon finished one big round.

There were a lot of warriors who were here since this was considered a ‘black market’. The things sold here were much cheaper than those in the stores.

If they had good eyes, they would be able to get something great.

“From 2017?!” Lin Xiu saw a book that caught his eyes as he widened his eyes in shock.

In this world, hardcopy books were annihilated. Therefore, it was extremely surprising for him to be able to find books that were printed on paper.

The most important thing was the book was kept in a really good shape.

“Brother, you have good eyes. We found this as we crossed one of the deserted areas and the book was kept inside a special metal box which is why it wouldn’t rot until today.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and took a look. The publishing date written on it was the year 2017, which was the era that Lin Xiu was in previously.

“Did you see it? This book is called the ‘God Rank Upgrade System’, a very heroic book. I just couldn’t believe how people back in 2017 knew about warriors….?” The boss was still busy recommending it to Lin Xiu.

“Plus, the author is known as ‘Master Minesweeper. Sounds cool right? Look, there’s a photo as well. I didn’t think that the young author would look so handsome…”

“…”

Lin Xiu felt a little awkward while hearing the boss’s exaggerated compliments. He has read multiple novels like this and it only felt familiar to him because it was from his era.

“Hey… don’t go! Brother, if you didn’t like this one, I have another one called ‘The Greatest Dragon’. It is also a great book, published from the same areas. They are both antique and you would be able to sell it for a high price…”

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue decided to ignore him and walked in the other direction.

This street was already packed but in the area ahead of them, there was a huge crowd.

“Three hundred thousand coins.”

“Three hundred and fifty thousand!”

As they got closer, Lin Xiu heard different people screaming at the top of their voices.

It sounded like an auction.

“An auction for the skill card?” They took another step closer and saw that the crowd was bidding for a skill card.

The price of it has gone up to three hundred and fifty thousand coins!

“This platinum warrior skill card is worth that much?” One of the warriors looked at the card despicably when he heard the price of the bid.

“Well, that’s because you don’t know anything about it. This is not an ordinary card!”
