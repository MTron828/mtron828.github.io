Chapter 778: Lin Xiu’s Source Mark Power!

The dazzling light made Qian Qiu Rong’s eyes narrow.

And in the next moment, these white rays of light directly covered the blue prints on the ground.

Those blue rays of light disappeared in an instant.

Originally, Liu Pan and the others, who were still feeling unwell, found that the feeling of oppression disappeared instantly!

Taking a closer look at the ground, there are all strange patterns that emit white light.

This is the domain force released by Lin Xiu!

“What have you done!”

Seeing this scene, Qian Qiurong couldn’t help but widen his eyes. Looking at Lin Xiu over there, he roared loudly.

How could his domain force suddenly disappear!

Logically speaking, even if the other party uses their own domain force, it is impossible to cover up his domain force...

Lin Xiu ignored Qian Qiurong’s words. At this time, the whole person had already rushed over and his body jumped suddenly, holding a long spear, charging down from top to bottom!

‘Tiger on the Ground’!

The whole person and the spear seemed to have turned into a huge tiger and it was as if it was biting fiercely!

Looking at this scene, Qian Qiurong couldn’t help but had a change of expression on his face.

“Come, sword!”

With a loud roar, he stretched out his hands and the long swords that had just been sent out seemed to be flying back to him again.

Clank clank—

All the long swords, at this moment, seemed to fit together, forming a huge sword wall!

Lin Xiu, who was charged down from the sky, let out a loud roar and the source strength of his whole body burst out, surrounding his entire body.

Clank—

And at this moment, the long spear in his hand seemed to be trembling slightly.

Boom—

As the long spear pierced the wall composed of those long swords, a loud sound erupted.

The whole ground shook violently.

“Damn...”

Liu Pan felt the dazzling light and at this moment his eyes could not help narrowing slightly.

Lin Xiu seemed to be like a fierce tiger. At this moment, he slammed the sword wall straight away!

Qian Qiurong’s eyes widened and his face was filled with an expression of incomparable confidence.

Impossible! Impossible!

How could he have such a strong power!?

Amethyst Divine Water! It must be because of the Amethyst Divine Water!

“That’s mine!!!”

Qian Qiurong let out a loud roar, watching Lin Xiu break through his sword wall, then rushed over to Lin Xiu, a blue tattoo suddenly appeared on his forehead.

Source mark! Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

‘Clean sweep’!

Seeing that he was about to unleash the power of the source mark, Lin Xiu didn’t care at all and directly used the strongest skill he knew so far!

At this time, the spear in his hand burst out because of the powerful source strength. The original black body of the spear now seems to have turned into colorful glass.

With the spear swept away, a huge force struck and the surrounding space seemed to shake a bit. It seemed that as long as the force was stronger, even the space could be broken open.

“You wanna die!”

The source mark on his forehead has already appeared and it materialized into a huge source mark.

Resist the front like a shield!

Defensive Source mark!

Boom—

But with this terrifying blow, Lin Xiu easily shattered this huge defensive Source mark!

However, seeing Lin Xiu destroy the source mark, not only did he not look flustered, but he showed a hideous smile.

Because the moment the source mark was broken by Lin Xiu’s spear, there was a loud noise.

The entire Source mark actually exploded directly!

“Damn!”

Liu Pan’s eyes widened at this time and the whole person was directly swept away by the powerful impact.

Not only him, but even An Qi and Qian Lin who were not far away flew out at this time.

At this moment, the surrounding ground was blasted with many huge cracks.

This explosion was so terrifying that even the warriors on the other side who were fighting the Raging Flame Lion seemed to have discovered this scene.

But they are now fighting madly with the Raging Flame Lion and they have no time to take care of the affairs here.

“Hahaha, boy, you are still too young!”

At this time, as the dust raised by the explosion slowly dissipated, Qian Qiurong’s figure slowly appeared.

He had unfolded the ‘Sphere’ and there was still a smear of blood coming out of the corner of his mouth and he was laughing wildly.

Lin Xiu would not have reacted to the power of the explosion just now.

And it should be able to kill him directly.

But as the dust in the front began to slowly dissipate, a figure appeared in the air.

Qian Qiurong, who was smiling wickedly, suddenly froze.

“You… You…”

He looked forward with his eyes and he could clearly see Lin Xiu standing in the air.

And around his body, there is a transparent matrix.

“Source mark?!”

Looking at the black tattoo on Lin Xiu’s forehead, Qian Qiurong easily realized.

This was the first time Lin Xiu had used the Source mark power. He didn’t expect that the effect would be pretty good.

When used in this way, it is somewhat similar to a ‘Sphere’, but the shape is different.

But Lin Xiu felt that it was not that simple and that he should be able to use it in other ways.

“Next, it’s my turn.”

As soon as Lin Xiu’s mind was triggered, the square matrix on his body disappeared.

“Go to hell!!!”

He waved his hands frantically, the source strength condensed and bursts of terrifying energy clusters rushed towards Lin Xiu.

bang bang bang-

But at this moment, as Lin Xiu waved his hands, square matrices appeared in front of Lin Xiu, blocking all those attacks.

What the hell is this?!

Looking at these things, Qian Qiurong could not help but frown.

Whoosh whoosh—

And at this time, these matrices instantly appeared in front of Qian Qiurong!

Qian Qiurong’s eyes changed. Before he could figure out what these matrices did, his body subconsciously wanted to dodge to the back, only to find that this matrix appeared behind him.

The body instantly hit these suspended matrices.

boom–

With a dull sound, he felt a sharp pain.

Damn it!!!

Looking at the square translucent matrix that soon surrounded him, Qian Qiurong roared and reached out to smash the square matrix in front of him that was blocking him.

But what he didn’t expect was that as soon as his fist smashed past, he found that his fist smashed into this matrix!

The matrix was not broken and Qian Qiurong’s fist was still stuck in it.

He reached out his hand and tried to pull it out, but he seemed to be stuck and couldn’t get out at all!
