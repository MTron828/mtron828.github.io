Chapter 537: Luo Yue, Goodbye!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Hearing Luo Huatian’s words, the eyes of these people suddenly changed.

“Nan Huang.” The short-haired woman looked at the man who just wanted to kill Lin Xiu and said aloud.

The man’s face changed slightly, but he seemed to have thought of something. He showed a smile and said, “Since you have spoken, I will give you a face.”

“Let’s go!” Nan Huang looked at Lin Xiu at this moment, sneered, then turned around and left.

The people behind him hesitated for a while and followed Nan Huang away.

“Thank you.” Watching them leave, Lin Xiu felt that the oppressive feeling disappeared instantly.

However, Lin Xiu still had a killing intent in his heart.

In this world, strength was still the most important thing.

If he was a rank 8 warrior just now, those few people would be afraid!

Boom–

Luo Huatian turned around and smashed Lin Xiu’s abdomen with a fist.

A sharp pain struck, and a mouthful of blood spit out from Lin Xiu’s mouth.

And because of this severe pain, Lin Xiu collapsed to the ground.

“You are too weak.” Luo Huatian said coldly at this time.

Swoosh—

At this moment, a sword beam shot towards Luo Huatian’s body.

Boom–

But Luo Huatian still stood still, stretched out his right hand, and grabbed the long sword that was stabbing directly with his hand.

“Why, do you want to kill even your own brother?” Luo Huatian showed a strange smile and said to Luo Yue who was about to stab him with a long sword.

Luo Yue didn’t speak and looked at Luo Huatian coldly.

“You really look like dad, no wonder he likes you more.” Luo Huatian shook his head helplessly.

At this time, he also became serious, “Luo Yue, the agreement is about to be implemented.”

Hearing Luo Huatian’s words, Luo Yue’s body suddenly froze.

“I know.” Luo Yue was silent for a while, then said coldly.

“Go back with me.” Luo Huatian nodded and said.

Go back!?

Lin Xiu, who had already stood up while covering his stomach, heard his words, and the expression in his eyes couldn’t help changing.

Of course he knew where Luo Yue was going, almost certainly Sky City.

Luo Huatian walked directly to the front at this time, then looked back. Seeing that Luo Yue didn’t seem to be leaving, he seemed to have thought of something and then said aloud, “If you have something to say, hurry up. “

“You…” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue who was in front of him and suddenly looked like something was stuck in his throat.

The two had been fighting side by side for a long time. Luo Yue was leaving so suddenly, Lin Xiu felt very reluctant.

Luo Yue didn’t say a word, and then seemed to think of something, stretched out her hands around her neck, and quickly took out a jade pendant with a special red thread.

“For you.” Luo Yue said to Lin Xiu.

Seeing Lin Xiu still seeming to be stunned, Luo Yue thought for a while, then walked over and helped Lin Xiu tie it around his neck.

Because of the influence of Thunder Lotus Fire on Lin Xiu’s body, the flashing electric lights spread to Luo Yue’s body at this time, but Luo Yue ignored it.

Without saying a word, she carried her long sword and walked directly to Luo Huatian.

Lin Xiu looked down at a jade pendant shaped like an arc with a crescent moon in the middle.

He held it with his right hand and could still feel her residual body temperature.

“I will come to you!”

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue’s back and shouted loudly.

Luo Yue, who was walking towards the front, suddenly froze for a moment.

Then she turned to look behind and a smile appeared on the corner of her mouth that Lin Xiu had never seen before, “Okay.” 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Soon, as Luo Yue and Luo Huatian disappeared, Lin Xiu’s hands could not help clenching into fists.

Strength strength!

Now his strength was far from enough!

Thinking of those rank 8 warriors just now, they should also be from Sky City.

With his own level of strength, he was only qualified to set foot in Sky City, but it was not enough to gain a foothold in Sky City!

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, put the jade pendant under his clothes, and pressed it against his chest.

Now his body can still feel the pain caused by the Thunder Lotus Fire.

Damn…

At this time, Lin Xiu covered his chest, looked forward with his eyes, and walked forward with his spear stuck on the ground, preventing his body from falling down.

Now Wan Lu and Lao Bai’s group are probably looking for themselves. The best way now is to find a place first, train well, and absorb all the energy of the Thunder Lotus Fire in the body!

“Look! He should have gone there!” At this time, Wan Lu pointed to the forest in front of him and said aloud.

Because the land in the forest here seemed to be relatively wet, he found some footprints left behind and could almost be sure that the person who took the Thunder Lotus Fire ran here!

Thinking of this, he was so angry.

“You guys go and search!” Lao Bai said with a gloomy expression at this time.

These few of them worked tirelessly just to find some energy bodies that might appear at the location of the space crack.

They found it but didn’t expect it to be snatched away by someone else in the end.

“Huhuhu”

At this time, Lin Xiu panted and walked over to the front. The energy of the Thunder lotus fire now seemed to spread to every meridian in his body.

The flame attribute of thunder lotus fire did not cause much damage to Lin Xiu’s meridians, but the domineering thunder attribute energy made Lin Xiu feel a little unbearable!

What Lin Xiu didn’t know was that his method of directly swallowing the Thunder Lotus Fire could have killed him if he was an ordinary warrior.

Fortunately, Lin Xiu had devoured the most primitive red lotus fire with pure fire properties, and all the meridians in his body could withstand the burning of the flame.

Moreover, he also had a strong ability to resist electric shock before, so the current Lin Xiu’s body has not completely collapsed.

At this time, Lin Xiu looked to the front, and he saw that there was a cave in the shadow of the trees.

Looking around, it seemed to be quite hidden, Lin Xiu gritted his teeth, and then ran inside with all his strength.

The inside of this cave was pitch-dark and numb, and Lin Xiu didn’t think too much about other things at this time. After entering, he sat directly on the ground.

Then, the ‘Cultivation Technique’ was quickly activated.

Only the ‘Cultivation Technique’ combined with the ‘Engulf’ skill of the system could maximize the energy absorption in the body!
