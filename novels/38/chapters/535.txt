Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Luo Yue, who was holding Lin Xiu, clearly felt that the electric lights had already surrounded her body.

She also felt a tingling sensation on her body.

But even so, Luo Yue quickly ran to the other side with Lin Xiu in her arms.

Continue to run to the front for a while, and she noticed that there was a forest in front.

“What’s going on!” At this time, Lao Bai also ran over to the Thunder lotus fire, and when he saw Wan Lu standing here, he suddenly said sharply.

Because he obviously found out that this Thunder Lotus Fire has disappeared!

“The thunder lotus was taken away!!!”

At this time, Wan Lu also gritted his teeth and said.

“Where did he go!?” Lao Bai’s eyes widened, and then he said angrily.

The thing that they fought desperately for was taken away just like that!?

“I don’t know, speed is too fast.” Wan Lu shook his head and said aloud.

Just after he avoided the white flame, he found that no one was there.

Thinking of this, in anger, he clenched his hands into fists.

“Find him! Find him for me!!!”

Lao Bai was also full of anger.

At the same time, the huge space beast, also under the siege of those warriors, fell to the ground with a loud sound.

But after killing the evolved beast, they also lost a lot of warriors.

And most importantly, the thunder lotus fire was gone!

“Don’t think anybody came here before.” Luo Yue placed Lin Xiu on a huge branch at this time, and whispered.

At this time, Luo Yue’s eyes were also full of worry, because Lin Xiu’s current state obviously looked very painful.

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide and panted heavily.

This thunder lotus fire was different from the red lotus fire that he absorbed before. It was full of domineering thunder and lightning attributes. Even Lin Xiu, who has a strong anti-lightning ability, felt that it was too much.

If it were someone else who devoured the Thunder Lotus Fire directly this way, they would have already exploded and died.

Now the ‘Engulf’ skill was still in the process of being activated, and it could help him absorb the Thunder Lotus Fire faster.

“Don’t worry, it should be able to be absorbed by tonight.” Although Lin Xiu was in severe pain everywhere, Lin Xiu still showed a smile and said to Luo Yue at this time.

Although Luo Yue was a little puzzled, she still nodded at this time.

But at this moment, Luo Yue seemed to have discovered something, the expression in her eyes changed, and the long sword in her hand clenched tightly, guarding in front of Lin Xiu.

What’s wrong?

Lin Xiu was stunned when he saw Luo Yue’s actions.

“Tsk tsk, turns out this energy body was swallowed by you…”

At this moment, in the depths of the trees behind, several figures came out instantly.

Although Lin Xiu felt severe pain all over his body, he was still awake. At this time, he opened his eyes and looked behind him, and he could clearly see the figure of the person behind him.

It’s them!?

These people were the dangerous people Luo Yue mentioned after entering the Thunder Valley.

According to Luo Yue, these people were rank 8!

“She seems to be from the Luo family.” A short-haired woman in the group glanced at Luo Yue, and then said lightly.

“Well… she seemed familiar.” A man nodded and said aloud.

“You can go, he, stay.” Another man who looked arrogant approached, glanced at Luo Yue, and pointed at Lin Xiu.

“What do you want?” Luo Yue was still standing in front of Lin Xiu, she didn’t move at all.

“Are you trying to protect him?” The man frowned and said aloud.

Luo Yue didn’t speak, but standing here was the answer to his question.

“I’m sorry, you took something you shouldn’t have and I’m going to get it out of your body.” The man ignored Luo Yue and said directly to Lin Xiu.

When Lin Xiu heard his words, he also clenched the spear in his hand.

“You still want to resist with this strength of yours?” The man said with a sneer.

“Sit down!”

He snorted coldly, and a powerful force charged directly towards Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu, who had just stood up with a spear, clearly felt this powerful pressure at this time. His chest became tight, he was about to fall to the ground.

But at this time, Lin Xiu clenched the Dark Edge spear in both hands and stabbed the spear on the ground, so that he was not crushed by this powerful impact.

But at this time, the chest felt tight, and a mouthful of blood was instantly spat out.

“He should have just swallowed the energy body, but it hasn’t completely absorbed it yet.” The short-haired woman looked at Lin Xiu at this time, and said coldly.

Hearing his words, the man’s eyes lit up just now, his body moved, and he rushed in front of Lin Xiu in an instant.

“Give it to me!” He waved his right claw and was about to grab Lin Xiu’s body!

Dang–

But Luo Yue’s reaction was also very fast, directly blocking his attack with a long sword.

But this man was a rank 8 warrior after all, and the power of his claws was also very powerful. Luo Yue’s long sword collided with his claws and she took several steps back.

Damn it!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes were red, and the Dark Edge spear he held in his hand stabbed the man’s body!

Crackling-

The spear was full of terrifying lightning, and when it stabbed like this, the surrounding air seemed to be scorched by electricity.

“En? An ant with such strength still wants to attack me?” The man sneered at this moment, a killing intent appeared in his eyes, and in the next moment, he swung his right claw over!

Lin Xiu’s spear was knocked off, and in the next moment, with a wave of his other arm with claws, he was about to tear Lin Xiu into several pieces!

Can’t dodge!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

Dang–

However, at this critical moment, with a crisp sound, a figure appeared in front of Lin Xiu, and the man’s attack was blocked.

“Enough.”

A somewhat familiar voice rang out.

“Luo Huatian!?”

When the man saw that he resisted his attack, he was surprised and saw the man’s face clearly. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Luo Huatian?

Lin Xiu was startled, looked up, and saw Luo Huatian’s figure.

Why did he appear here?

“Why, people from the Luo Family want to join in?” The short-haired woman looked at Luo Huatian’s appearance at this time and said with a sneer.

“Let him go..” Luo Huatian glanced at these people and then said lightly.
