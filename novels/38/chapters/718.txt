Chapter 719 Purple Gold Skill Card!

Huangji’s words made the faces of the three master warrior-level warriors reveal an irresistible joy.

Xuanfeng Academy could be said to be one of the best academies in Fengyun City. It is called the Royal Academy. Every year, a large number of talented and intelligent warriors enter it to train and study.

Moreover, there were also many mentors at the level of King Warriors.

“Mr. Huang seems to have also gone to Sky City today. What is the strength of this year’s top of the list?”

Yang Yang said with a smile at this time.

“Average.”

Huangji said lightly.

He was very unhappy with Lin Xiu, and at this time he didn’t mention Lin Xiu’s name at all.

Lin Xiu kept his eyes on these warriors.

The Ten Talents in Hongliang City should be similar to the Ten Talents in Tianlong City.

These people were all around twenty-four or five years old, and their strength was also very strong. The weakest was rank 9.

And there were three master warrior-level warriors.

But it seemed that they had just been promoted to master warrior, and their strength was not too strong.

At least, it was weaker than Wu Zhangkong.

And at this time, many warriors came over and greeted Huangji. This old Huangji seemed to know a lot of people.

“Let’s go in too.”

Huangji said aloud at this time.

“En, everyone keep up.”

Jiang Jun nodded, then waved to Lin Xiu and the others behind him.

These warriors had all been to the Legacy land and there was still excitement on their faces.

The entrance was very dark but after entering, the space inside seemed to have a dark red light.

“It turns out that the entrance is a phantom.”

After a warrior entered, he suddenly said in surprise.

What’s even more surprising is entering inside.

The space inside was like entering a lava cave.

Compared to the cold outside, it was getting warmer inside.

No, not only was it warm, but it made people feel a little hot.

“This… is there still lava here?”

Not long after walking, they found that there was a lot of magma flowing under the ravines in front.

Standing on this rocky ground, you could feel the scorching heat below.

“Don’t be surprised, let’s go to the front first.”

Jiang Jun’s voice came over.

He looked to the front, and there were many tall and sturdy warrior statues there.

These warrior statues were really too big, making everyone look very small.

Moreover, they had hideous faces, staring down at everyone, looking a little too lifelike.

There was a spacious and flat wall in front, but there was no way forward.

The only things that stood out in the entire space were the lifelike statues on both sides.

“It can’t be just here. Everyone, look around. There are probably switches around here.”

A warrior said aloud.

Hearing the warrior’s words, the rest nodded.

They didn’t find anything here at all and only saw these things.

Lin Xiu also looked around, but he didn’t find anything strange.

“Interesting…”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, then activated the Analytic eye and began to glance around.

The use of this Anyalytic Eye was not so simple – it not only was able to check the status of people’s attributes, but also to check other anomalies.

“Hint: Abnormal.”

When using the Analytic eye to scan these statues, such words appeared in Lin Xiu’s mind.

Abnormal?

What does Abnormal mean?

Lin Xiu was dumbfounded.

But that’s it, the analytic eye didn’t show anything else, it just showed Abnormal.

It seems that the key lies in these stone statues.

At this time, a warrior looked at the head of the sculpture, as if he had found something, and his eyes showed a fiery look.

In the next moment, his body jumped up and he was about to reach out and grab it.

“There’s a skill card on it!”

Another warrior, looking at that warrior’s movements, immediately shouted.

As soon as he said these words, at this moment, the rest of the warriors reacted.

The surface of these stone statues seems to be made of some yellow rocks, but upon closer inspection, there seemed to be a very faint trace of the size of a skill card on the forehead.

The warrior who was the first to discover jumped up and directly stretched out his hand then slapped the statue’s forehead hard, and a skill card instantly fell down.

“Purple Gold Skill Card!!!”

Seeing the purple-gold light from this skill card, the surrounding warriors instantly became jealous.

This kind of powerful skill was not necessarily able to be cultivated by a strong warrior. Generally speaking, only a warrior at the king warrior level could fully cultivate successfully.

Moreover, the rarity of the Purple Gold Skill Card was also very high, and the price was also very expensive!

“Purple gold! All are purple gold skill cards!”

The surrounding warriors all got excited. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu lowered his voice and said to Qian Jin.

Qian Jin was startled, and before he came to his senses, Lin Xiu had already retreated to the back.

And at this time, a battle had already broken out in the front.

The warrior who was the first to obtain this purple gold skill card, before the skill card was even warm in his hand, his body was directly chopped in half by another warrior!

“This is mine!!!”

The warrior who killed him laughed and snatched the Purple Gold Skill Card.

But he didn’t laugh for long and his head was chopped off.

In an instant, the scene fell into chaos.

“This is too scary…”

Following Lin Xiu’s back to Qian Jin, he couldn’t help but feel terrified.

As the saying goes, people die for wealth and birds die for food, and it is vividly expressed here.

“Humph!”

Huangji snorted coldly at this time and moved.

This purple-gold rank skill card was enough to move him.

“What should we do?”

Qian Jin watched this scene, and then said to Lin Xiu.

“Why, you want to grab it too?”

“The ones fighting over there are all master warrior-level warriors.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Not all warriors were fools. Some warriors with relatively low strength also retreated like Lin Xiu.

Standing there now, even if you didn’t intend to snatch the Purple Gold Skill Card, others would think you were, and then kill you directly.

Is the abnormality displayed just now because there were purple-gold-level skill cards hidden in these statues?

Lin Xiu frowned slightly, feeling that things seemed a little strange.

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

And when those people were all focused on grabbing the Purple Gold Skill Card, Lin Xiu’s eyes focused on those statues.
