1159 This is the new City Lord

Boom – –

There was a loud sound that came from a distant away and Lin Xiu quickly turned towards where the sound was coming from.

When Lin Xiu took a closer look, he could see that there were huge machines right in front of him.

These machines have a huge drill attached to it and it was mining the huge mountains.

!!

There were also a large number of warriors who were carrying huge energy stones out of the mountains. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

These stones seemed heavy and even the warriors looked exhausted as they were carrying it.

Bakk – –

Suddenly, one of the warriors fell to the ground as he no longer had the energy to stand. Then, he was whipped heavily by one of the members of the Tianlan Pavilion!

“Ahhhh!”

When the man felt the intense pain, he instantly cried on top of his lungs.

“Get up!”

When the members of the Tianlan Pavillion saw what happened, they took the whip in their hands that were covered with current and started whipping the warriors.

Whip whip whip – –

With the sound of flesh being ripped apart, the man started streaming in agony.

He had no other choice but to clench his jaw and get back on his feet.

“The members of the Tianlan Pavilion captured these warriors so that they could mind the energy stones here?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he looked at the scene before him.

“That’s right.”

Mr Pang was looking into the distance as well. He kept quiet for some time before nodding his head.

They had no other ways to stop them.

The past city lords were either killed or fell under the control of the Tianlan Pavilion.

With the control of the Tianlan Pavilion, most of the warriors from the Lingxian City didn’t have the chance to escape even if they wanted to.

“Who are you?!”

Suddenly, there was a member of the Tianlan Pavilion that walked towards them.

There was a whip in his hand as he glared at Lin Xiu and Mr Pang.

“This is the new City Lord of Lingxian City.”

Mr Pang looked at the man before answering him.

“The new City Lord?!”

The man was a little stunned when he heard the answer and then, it was followed by a loud laughter.

“Look! The new city lord of Lingxian City is here!”

The man screamed.

The rest of the members of Tianlan Pavilion turned towards Lin Xiu when they heard what the man said.

They stared at Lin Xiu as if they were watching something and there was a mocking look in their eyes.

“Yo! The new City Lord looked young! Was he sent by the pavilion master to dig for some rocks?!”

“Hahahahahahahah!!!!”

The rest of the members from Tianlan Pavilion laughed on top of their lungs.

“Hey! We’re talking to you! Can’t you hear us?!”

The man, who had the whip in his hands, raised his arm and the whip with the horrible current was aimed at Lin Xiu’s head!

It was about to hit Lin Xiu’s head.

Bakk – –

Suddenly, Lin Xiu raised his hand and caught the whip.

“You’re dead!”

When the man saw how Lin Xiu had the audacity to fight against him, the man screamed. Then, he pressed onto the button on the whip and there was a terrifying current that surrounded the whip.

The current travelled through the whip and went all over Lin Xiu’s body.

“That’s all?”

Lin Xiu, who was covered in electrical current, asked in a monotonous tone.

He didn’t look like he was in any pain.

How would this be possible?!

The man’s eyes widened in show as he saw what was happening before him and his eyes were filled with disbelief.

How was it that Lin Xiu wasn’t affected by such strong currents?!

Then, there was a huge electrical current that appeared all over Lin Xiu’s body. It looked even scarier than the one before and this was headed for the other man!

Sizzling – –

With the crisp sound of the current, it felt like the terrifying current had burnt the air around it!

The man’s body trembled in fear but he couldn’t say a single word.

Soon, they could all see that the man’s body was turning black from being toasted.

Then, the man’s body fell to the ground.

He died!

Most of the warriors at the scene were shocked to see what had happened.

“Damn it!”

The rest of the members of the Tianlan Pavilion had no idea that the Tianlan Pavilion was destroyed by Lin Xiu. Their master has already been defeated.

These men, who were used to being arrogant, had obviously forgotten that the city lord was also a warrior god.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes when he saw what happened.

He raised up his right hand and it was covered by a thin amount of energy!

Boom – –

Instantly, the entire place was covered by a loud explosion. The bodies of the members of the Tianlan Pavillion exploded immediately!

It got blasted into a million pieces!

There were a few more warriors behind them. These warriors were not attacked by the energy that Lin Xiu realised but their bodies started trembling as well.

This was horrifying! Absolutely horrifying!

These members of the Tianlan Pavilion didn’t even get the chance to attack Lin Xiu and all of them have died such a horrible death!

“You’re…dead! The pavilion master will never let you go for this!”

The remaining warriors stared at Lin Xiu in fear as they started stepping away from Lin Xiu.

They have been used to being bullies but now they finally realised that no matter how weak the city lords could be, they were still warriors gods.

“You shall be meeting the death god very soon.”

Lin Xiu answered them in a calm tone before releasing a large amount of horrifying energy.

The bodies of these warriors exploded almost immediately.

Mr Pang was frightened as well when he saw what happened.

Lin Xiu was obviously different compared to the other city lords.

He was cold and determined.

Lin Xiu then walked forward towards the mine.

He killed each of the members of the Tianlan Pavilion who were at the scene.

Mr Pang kept quiet as he watched it happen and followed quietly behind Lin Xiu.

He was quite happy with the change.

The members of the Tianlan Pavilion have done many evil things and it’s time for them to be punished.

“Let me introduce him. This is the new city lord of Lingxian City.”

As soon as all the members of the Tianlan Pavilion were killed, all of the warriors gathered around Mr Pang.

The warriors seemed to be covered in wounds and they looked horrible as they have been mining for these energy stones for years.

They looked at Lin Xiu after hearing the introduction from Mr Pang.

They have already noticed Lin Xiu from earlier on.

They also witnessed how the members of the Tianlan Pavilion were easily killed by Lin Xiu!

This new city lord was incredibly powerful!
