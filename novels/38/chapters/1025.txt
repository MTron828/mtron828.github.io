“Hang in there.”

Lin Xiu looked at the iron cables and said aloud.

“Okay.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Sima Qiang nodded slightly.

Lin Xiu looked at the iron cable running through his shoulder blade and in the next moment, he stretched out his hand and yanked it violently!

Sima Qiang was obviously in great pain and his eyes suddenly widened.

But he still gritted his teeth and didn’t make any sound.

The iron cables that ran through Sima Qiang’s shoulders had all been pulled out.

At the same time, the water-attribute energy ball on Lin Xiu’s necklace radiated blue light in the next moment.

Drops of blue water droplets flew toward Sima Qiang’s wound.

As those blue water droplets entered Sima Qiang’s wound, in the next moment, his wound was quickly repaired at a speed visible to the naked eye!

When Sima Qiang saw this scene, his eyes were full of surprise.

On the other side, Zhao Ran had a grim expression on his face and his face was full of infinite killing intent.

His arm was torn off by Lin Xiu!

He continued to use his source strength to gather around his wounds.

Soon, his wounds began to heal quickly.

But the broken arm could not grow back.

At this moment, his body was suspended in the air, looking at Lin Xiu and Sima Qiang below, a purple source mark flashed on his forehead.

With the appearance of the source mark, the surrounding sky became densely clouded.

“Go to… hell!!!”

he growled loudly.

boom boom boom —

At this moment, thunder and lightning flashed suddenly.

One after another terrifying lightning strikes directly towards Lin Xiu and Sima Qiang!

“Humph.”

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu snorted coldly,

In the next moment, he stretched out his hand and waved and Lin Xiu’s electric energy ball also emitted a dazzling purple light.

As if even more terrifying lightning, burst out directly!

Two terrifying lightning bolts collided with each other and a loud sound suddenly erupted.

The lightning released by Lin Xiu was obviously even more terrifying for Zhao Ran.

The lightning instantly crushed the lightning released by Zhao Ran and charged directly towards Zhao Ran’s body!

This is impossible!

Looking at this scene, Zhao Ran’s face was filled with incomparable horror.

The body subconsciously unfolded the ‘Sphere’.

Those terrifying lightning bolts all hit Zhao Ran’s ‘Sphere’.

boom boom boom —

Those bolts of lightning covered his ‘Sphere’ in an instant.

These lightning bolts were so terrifying that Zhao Ran’s “Sphere” became unstable because of the impact of these lightning bolts.

Impossible, this is impossible!

In this short period of time, how could this kid have such a powerful strength!

Zhao Ran roared in his heart at this time.

In the next moment, Lin Xiu moved his body and jumped directly and charged towards them.

Lin Xiu’s speed was very fast, reaching the limit.

swoosh—

With a wave of his right hand, the Dark Edge spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

Holding the Dark Edge spear in both hands, he slashed directly at Zhao Ran’s ‘Sphere’!

boom–

In the next moment, Zhao Ran’s body was blasted down!

At this moment, his ‘Sphere’ also broke directly.

Without the protection of the ‘Sphere’, his body slammed heavily on the ground below.

pfft—

A mouthful of blood spat out directly from his mouth.

Before he could react, a huge flaming phoenix rushed down from the sky!

Directly hit his body!

“No!!!”

Seeing this scene, Zhao Ran’s expression changed drastically.

Can’t help screaming loudly.

But now, he has no way to resist.

Boom—

As the flaming phoenix crashed down from the sky, the entire ground shook wildly.

Zhao Ran’s body was also maddened by the flames at a speed visible to the naked eye and was directly annihilated.

Burned to the point where not even slag was left.

The surrounding Zhao family’s warriors all opened their eyes wide when they saw this scene.

Their most powerful Patriarch was killed by Lin Xiu just like that?

“Chief, your strength…”

At this time, Sima Qiang looked at Lin Xiu who came down from the sky, his eyes were full of shock.

He had no idea that Lin Xiu’s strength had improved so much during the time he disappeared.

Zhao Ran was a warrior at the Sage warrior level, was killed by Lin Xiu so easily!?

“Sage warrior.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Sima Qiang opened his mouth slightly, but his eyes were still full of shock.

Sage warrior, such a young Sage warrior-level warrior.

Moreover, Lin Xiu, who became a Sage warrior, was obviously much stronger than the veteran Sage warriors like Zhao Ran.

This is good news for Sima Qiang.

The Ye family’s revival is hopeful.

“Boy, how dare you come back!!!”

At the same time, a loud sound came from the air.

Boom—

At the moment when the sound came over, terrifying energy beams charged from all directions!

Lin Xiu, who saw this scene, narrowed his eyes.

At this moment, the ‘Sphere’ on the body instantly unfolded.

Surrounding himself and Sima Qiang.

The extremely hard ‘Sphere’ directly blocked all their attacks!

Raising his eyes and looking at the sky, he could clearly see the silhouettes of the black dragon and the white dragon.

These two people had already arrived.

And a large number of warriors from the Black Troop and the White Troop also rushed over.

All surrounded Lin Xiu.

“Where’s Zhao Ran?!”

Bai Long looked around, but found that Zhao Ran was gone.

He and Hei Long had already rushed here when they heard the news of Lin Xiu’s return.

At this time, they also surrounded the place with all the warriors in their troops.

“What do you think?”

Lin Xiu raised his eyes and looked at the old man in the sky. Holding the spear in his hand, he pointed to the huge pit.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Bai Long’s eyes looked over there and he saw the pit that was burnt to pitch black by the flames.

Zhao Ran… was killed!?

Thinking of this, the pupils in Bai Long’s eyes could not help but shrink slightly.

“Don’t talk nonsense, kill this kid, how dare he snatched my beast-saint level odd crystal!”

Hei Long roared at this time.

He was obviously still hung up about what happened before.

Lin Xiu actually took the Beast Saint-level Odd Crystal from under his nose and they didn’t manage to kill Lin Xiu in Wildfire City. It was a shame!

“kill!”

Bai Long also waved his right hand and shouted loudly.

Hundreds of thousands of warriors around, all rushed towards Lin Xiu at this moment.

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand, without the slightest fear.

“Break!!!”
