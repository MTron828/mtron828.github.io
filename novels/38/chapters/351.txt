Chapter 352: Throw Away Directly

“It’s not a good habit to use violence.” Lin Xiu stared at the muscular man and said indifferently.

At this time, the muscular man also saw Lin Xiu who came by, his brows furrowed.

He clearly felt that there was a huge amount of force coming from his wrist, which made his wrist hurt a little.

Boy, I’m quite strong. The man laughed loudly at this time and the next moment, his cheeks suddenly became fierce.

The wine glass held in the other hand hit Lin Xiu’s head!

boom–

With a dull sound, the thick wine glass in his hand did not hit Lin Xiu’s head and he was kicked out by Lin Xiu in an instant.

The whole sturdy body slammed directly on the table behind.

At this time, the eyes of many warriors around were all looking over. Upon seeing Lin Xiu and Luo Yue two such young warriors here, they were a little surprised.

But most people had a proud attitude and no one cared about it.

Is it you? At this moment, a voice came from the other side.

Lin Xiu turned around and saw a man who was somewhat familiar.

“I’m Zhang Zong, do you remember me?” the man said with a smile.

This man was the warrior that he met in the dark forest previously. On the day that Lin Xiu left, he said that he would make a deal with Lin Xiu. If Lin Xiu finds the horn of the Unicorn terror beast, he would do an exchange with Lin Xiu.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded, then took out the horn of the Unicorn terror beast and put it in front of him, “I found it.”

Zhang Zong looked at the horn of this Unicorn terror beast and his eyes lit up.

Found it!?

He seemed a little excited, reaching out to hold the horn of the Unicorn terror beast.

But just when his hand was about to touch the horn of the Unicorn terror beast, Lin Xiu took it away.

“What are you trading with me?” Lin Xiu stared at him, then the corners of his mouth lifted.

“Hahaha.” Zhang Zong was taken aback, then he laughed and said, “Of course there’s something for you.”

“Both you and your little girlfriend, come here.” Zhang Zong laughed loudly then walked to the front.

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu wanted to say something, but seeing that Luo Yue was silent, Lin Xiu didn’t say anything.

“Let’s go.” Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu then said aloud.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded then walked to the front.

When he walked into the passageway inside this pub, Lin Xiu saw a room in front of him.

Squeak—

As Zhang Zong pushed the door open, there was a squeaky sound.

“Come in.” Zhang Zong turned to look at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue at this time and said.

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate and walked in with the horn of the Unicorn terror beast.

As soon as he walked in and looked around, he saw that there were a lot of materials, bones and scales from evolved beasts in this room.

On the glass in front, there were some gold cards and even diamond cards.

“All the things our team collected are placed here.” Seeing Lin Xiu and Luo Yue walk in, Zhang Zong smiled and said.

“You opened this pub?” Lin Xiu said aloud.

“No, I’m just an old friend.” Zhang Zong shook his head and said aloud.

Lin Xiu nodded then didn’t continue the small chat. He asked directly, “What are you using to trade with me?”

Lin Xiu knew the value of the horns of this Unicorn terror beast. It was also an accident that he managed to kill that Unicorn terror beast at that time.

“Well, I won’t beat about the bush anymore; I really need this thing and I didn’t expect you to find it.” Speaking of this, Zhang Zong couldn’t help showing a look of approval.

When he saw Lin Xiu kill the evolved beast that caused him and the others to be in a very difficult situation, he knew that Lin Xiu’s strength was extraordinary, but he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would really kill this Unicorn terror beast. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“You can pick whatever you want here.” Zhang Zong looked at Lin Xiu then said aloud.

There was a hint of pride in his words.

Because these things here were all collected by their team and all of them were materials taken from the bodies of high-level evolved beasts.

Moreover, there were a lot of advanced skill cards here.

“Useless.” Luo Yue glanced at the surrounding things, then shook her head and said.

“Useless? Young lady, look at these. This is the weapon made from the claws of a rank 7 Explosive Wolf – it is very hard. There are also these…” Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Zhang Zong became a little upset, thinking that Luo Yue had never seen the world before and actually said that his things were useless.

At this moment, he looked at the things around him and kept introducing them to her.

“The skeleton of the rank 7 golden turtle, the carapace of the rank 7 flying centipede…” Before Zhang Zong finished speaking, Luo Yue glanced around and managed to name all the materials of these evolved beasts easily.

“These kinds of things would simply be thrown away in my house.” Luo Yue said aloud without expression.

Thrown away!?

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Zhang Zong’s mouth widened.

Although these may not be precious for those warriors of rank 7 or above, they definitely weren’t things that could just be thrown away, right?

But Luo Yue didn’t seem to be lying at all.

Lin Xiu was also secretly stunned; he knew the value of these materials and the diamond cards he collected in the glass cabinet were also very valuable.

But unfortunately, these were not what he needed.

Lin Xiu shook his head then continued to look around.

“What are these?” Lin Xiu walked to the front. The room was filled with the bones of various evolved beasts and other things which seemed a bit cluttered.

In the front corner, there was a small pile of things that looked like hills.

“Oh, you mean this thing ah, this is something we found from a ruin.” Zhang Zong was taken aback, then looked towards Lin Xiu and said aloud.

Something from a ruin?

Lin Xiu looked at this pile of things that were like ‘garbage’ and had a feeling that there was something special.

“It’s just some rubbish, I was about to clear it out.” Zhang Zong said helplessly.

“I want this.”
