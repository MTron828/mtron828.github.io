Chapter 389: The Kiss

The body of the Dark Edge Spear was originally pitch black in color.

But at this moment, there were lots of thin, white markings across the body of the spear.

Compared to the spear from before, the weight of it has changed as well. It felt much heavier now.

The additional weight wasn’t a huge burden for Lin Xiu. Instead, it made it much smoother for Lin Xiu.

The blade of the spears seems to be much sharper as well.

Lin Xiu liked the spear even more with every passing second as he looked at it. He couldn’t help himself and started swinging the spear.

As the Dark Edge Spear danced in the air, there were blasting sounds heard in the air. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

With Lin Xiu’s energy being enveloped around the Dark Edge Spear, the white markings on the spear started glowing.

At that moment, Lin Xiu felt that the spear was becoming even heavier than before.

“The white markings….. Are they from the ore?” Lin Xiu carefully observed the black spear. He suddenly thought of something and decided to ask Luo Yue.

When Luo Yue heard his question, she nodded her head.

“I melted it and incorporated it into the body of the spear.”

Luo Yue said it casually but Lin Xiu knew that it definitely wasn’t as easy as it sounds. He looked at Luo Yue in the eyes and sincerely thanked her.

“Thank you.”

Luo Yue shook her head and then went back to the stone ladder.

PILIBALA –

Lin Xiu held onto the Dark Edge Spear with his left hand and with the control of his mind, he was able to concentrate all of his energy onto the spear in the form of lightning. Soon, it covered the entire spear.

With the lightning that was formed, the air around him was burnt. There was a burning smell that entered his nose.

However, after being washed down by the storm for the past few days, this lightning did nothing to Lin Xiu and it was no longer a threat to him.

Lin Xiu continued to dance with the Dark Edge Spear. When he felt tired, he turned around and noticed that Luo Yue had once again fallen asleep on the step ladder.

When he saw her sleeping, he paused.

In order to forge Dark Edge Spear, she most probably didn’t get much sleep for the past three days.

As he thought of it, Lin Xiu suddenly felt bad. He placed the Dark Edge Spear back on the ground and walked towards Luo Yue.

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment before gently carrying Luo Yue in his arms.

She was completely exhausted as she didn’t wake up even with the commotion.

He carried her soft, gentle body and slowly walked up the stairs.

Soon, Lin Xiu reached her room and as he opened the door, his eyes widened in shock.

This was because Lin Xiu noticed that Luo Yue’s room was completely covered in pink!!!!!

This was a huge surprise for Lin Xiu because Luo Yue has always been a cold person. Who would have expected that Luo Yue would be like the other girls who would like a pink room as well?

Speaking of which, this was the first time that Lin Xiu stepped into her room.

He carefully walked towards the bed and then gently placed her on it.

She was still sound asleep like a little baby.

Lin Xiu slowly took off her shoes and placed the blanket on top of her body.

As he stared at the delicate face that was only a few inches away from him, he suddenly paused. He initially wanted to leave her alone and allow her to sleep peacefully but instead, he placed a kiss on her forehead.

But, he still came back to his senses. He looked at Luo Yue’s figure who was still fast asleep and let out a breath of relief.

If she realized what had happened, she would have hacked him into pieces with her sword.

Lin Xiu gulped down a mouthful of saliva out of fear. He quickly stepped out of the room and closed the door behind him.

When Lin Xiu left the room, the long lashes on Luo Yue’s eyes fluttered.

Lin Xiu returned downstairs and took a shower. After changing into a new set of clothes, he laid down on his bed and rested.

The past few days had been extremely eventful for Lin Xiu.

At the same time, on the other side, Director Zhang had already passed Lin Xiu’s information to one of the deans of the Sacred Region Academy, Dean Baili.

“Dean, that’s him. He was the one who injured all the thunderbirds. All of them are being treated now.” Director Zhang respectfully told Dean Baili who was sitting opposite him.

It was Daen Baili who caught those thunderbirds in order to raise them as pets. For the past few years, Dean Baili had put in a lot of effort for these thunderbirds.

Now with so many of them injured because of Lin Xiu, he wasn’t surprised that the dean would explode in anger.

However, the scene that Director Zhang had imagined did not happen. Instead, when the dean read through Lin Xiu’s information from his screen, he laughed. He stroked his long white beard and said, “So he was the one…”

“Sir, should we…” Director Zhan wasn’t sure what Dean Baili was thinking off in his head but if his assumption was right, the dean should be extremely angry at this point but things weren’t happening as per what he thought.

“It’s alright. Let’s end the ban for him.” Dean Baili shook his head and answered his question.

Director Zhang was shocked when he heard the answer.

This student called Lin Xiu has caused such huge trouble, but the dean was going to forgive him so simply?

“Sir…” Director Zhang wanted to continue but the Dean stopped him by waving his hands and said, “Just leave it this way.”

Lin Xiu, who was now peacefully lying on his bed, was already sound asleep.

Although he was tired, he still had a fixed body clock which was why he woke up early in the morning.

Kuuuuu Kuuuuuuuu.

Lin Xiu opened his eyes and saw Gungun that was standing right in front of him

“When did you turn so big?” Lin Xiu was shocked when he saw Gungun. Its size was much bigger than how it was a few days ago.

Isn’t its growth process a little too fast?

At the same time, Gungun touched Lin Xiu and rolled over to the table where his backpack was at.

“What’s wrong?” Seeing how peculiar Gungun was acting, Lin Xiu was curious.

Kuuuuuu Kuuuuu – –

Gungun let out the same sound again as if he was trying to tell Lin Xiu that there was something in his backpack.

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment. Then, he stood up from his bed and walked over to the table.

Kalakalakalkalk – –

As he got close to the backpack, Lin Xiu could feel that there was a weird sound coming from the inside of his backpack.

It sounded as if something was about to break open.

What was it?

Lin Xiu curiously opened his backpack and noticed that there was something shining from inside.
