Chapter 837: Mutant Purple Frog

This cruise ship looked extremely old.

It was made of a special type of wood, something like the fire lord wood.

There were some damages on the body of the cruise and it was filled with algae as well.

“This ship..... Could it be the ghost ship?”

Lin Xiu asked as he was surprised.

When they first got onto the island and found part of the deck, Chen Dong mentioned that the ghost ship was made of fire lord wood.

Then, they noticed that there was a code on the cruise ship – NB001.

“It should be.”

Luo Yue took a closer look at it before nodding her head.

They managed to find the cruise ship with sheer luck when the others searched through high and low for it.

They wouldn’t have expected that the ghost ship was parked right here.

“Chen Dong, take a look at this.”

Lin Xiu turned around and noticed that most of them were still looking at the humans inside the glass case.

“What’s wrong?”

Chen Dong only came back to his senses. He took away his eyes from the glass case and turned towards Lin Xiu.

“We found the ghost ship.”

“WHAT?!”

Everyone, including Chen Dong was shocked as well when they heard what Lin Xiu said.

All of them walked toward Lin Xiu.

“Why.....why would it be here?!”

Chen Dong then noticed the ‘ghost ship’ that was mentioned.

Right behind them was a pitch black underground river. It would glisten from away and with the river, it would lead them to the Black River.

“It’s here! We found it!”

Compared to Chen Dong, the rest of them would be surprised as well.

They had expected for it to be a rough ride in order to find the ghost ship.

There were also some of them who never had hopes on finding it but who would have thought that it was right here.

It was a huge surprise for all of them.

“Code name 001, made of fire lord wood. It is the Ghost ship.”

Chen Dong came back from his senses and said in excitement.

“I want to take a look at it!”

One of the men screamed loudly.

This was the legendary ghost ship!

Will there be treasures that have been left behind by the legendary warrior king?!

As he thought about it, his heart was racing.

“Don’t!”

Chen Dong tried to stop the man who was getting onto the cruise ship.

But, the man had leaped into the air and had stopped onto the cruise ship.

The entire ship was huge and it was completely covered in algae.

When the rest of the warriors saw the men who headed on, the rest of them followed as well.

“Damn it!”

Chen Dong cursed to himself when he saw what happened.

Some of them were anxious as they tried to get onto the ship.

“Let’s take a look as well.”

Chen Dong had no other choice but to turn to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

His abilities to sense things were much stronger now. He could clearly feel that there is a strong vital sign coming from inside the ship.

There should be something living inside the ship.

Boom – –

When Lin Xiu and Luo Yue landed on the deck, the first man who boarded the cruise ship suddenly flew into the air and landed heavily on the deck.

Pfft – –

Blood started coming out of his mouth.

When they looked at him, he was covered in wounds.

“There’s....there’s something inside...”

Before he could finish his sentence, his body started trembling and there were bubbles coming out of his mouth.

His skin was turning blue as well.

It looked as if he was being poisoned.

Koong Loong – –

There was a loud sound that came from inside as well.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue rushed over to see what was inside and was met with a terrifying scene.

Right inside, there were bodies of huge evolved beasts lying on the ground.

Some of them looked like frogs in a human form with hands holding onto their weapons. They were now fighting the warriors who just stepped onto the ship.

Mutant Purple Frogs.

Rank: King

A creature from another dimension with high intelligence and strong attacks.

Weakness: Not identifiable.

As he read the information from the analytical eyes, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened in shock.

A creature from another dimension?

Why would it be here?

Lin XIu didn’t even get to think much about it when one of the creatures started attacking Luo Yue!

“Careful!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

When he saw it, Lin Xiu quickly pulled Luo Yue towards himself.

Xiu – –

There was a loud explosion that rang in the air.

The frog almost hit Luo Yue with his weapon.

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered as he stood in front of Luo Yue. He pulled out the spear and attacked the frog in return!

There were too many of them and all of them were the size of a ten year old boy.

Not only were they quick, their attacks were terrifying as well.

Lin Xiu didn’t even have the time to think about why there were so many mutated frogs in this palace. He quickly spun the spear in his hand and released the flaming birds!

But, the mutant frogs reacted quickly as well and easily dodged the attack.

The flames landed on the ground and reached the body of the big evolved beast. The bodies were immediately caught on fire and were burnt into ashes.

“Brother Lin! Don’t use fire! It will burn down this ship!”

Chen Dong, who was also fighting another mutant frog with his ‘Yuan’ released, screamed towards Lin Xiu.

Although the fire lord wood might be resistant to fire, Lin Xiu’s fire was different than the other. The fire coming out of Lin Xiu’s spear was extremely hot compared to the normal ones.

He was worried that the ghost ship might be destroyed.

Hellfire would definitely destroy the entire ship. He hesitated for a moment and stopped using the warrior skills that brought out the hellfire.

Clang clang clang – –

As the spear in his arm collided with the weapons of the mutant frog, it gave out a clear, loud sound.

The mutant purple frog was using a machete and it was good with it.

It made Lin Xiu feel as if he was fighting a human.

As for the rest of the warriors, they were involved in the bitter war as well.

These mutant purple frogs might not be as huge as the king grade evolved beasts but their attacks were much scarier.

Boom – –

One of the warriors, who was not careful enough, was chopped into pieces by the mutant purple frog.

Blood was everywhere.

“Damn it!”

When Chen Dong saw another warrior sacrificed in the fight, he screamed in rage.

Why were there so many such creatures on this ship?!

They could even stand up like humans and hold on to weapons with their hands.

Their skin was also purple in colour and it was making their scalp turn numb by how horrifying it looked.
