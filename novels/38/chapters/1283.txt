1284 The Highest Floor

Lin Xiu also noticed that the lock on his door had been broken!

Boom – –

When Lin Xiu kicked open the door, there was a soft groan from inside.

“Koooooo!”

!!

Rollie’s voice came from inside as well.

Although the light was not turned on and the room was dark, Lin Xiu was still able to carefully see what was happening inside.

Rollie and Little Bai were both safe and on the ground, there were a few men dressed in black who were rolling on the ground.

They seem to be struggling on the ground.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu clicked on the switch and turned on the lights.

“This…”

Lei Chong and Baili Haoling walked over and stared at the men who were on the ground. They were both equally shocked.

All of them were wailing and groaning as if they were in lots of pain.

When they took a closer look, they noticed that there were multiple injuries found on these men.

Some of their faces and arms were showing blood and flesh.

Some of them were done by Little Bai where it bit their flesh off while some of them were directly hit by Rollie.

“All of them are warrior gods?”

Lei Chong asked with his eyes widened.

Lin Xiu didn’t think that these warrior gods would dare look for trouble with him but in the end, Rollie and Little Bai were the ones who defeated them.

Lin Xiu was surprised.

Both of them were merely saint beasts and none of them were beast gods yet.

To be able to do such things was indeed shocking.

Plus, at the same time, the staff of the hotel arrived as well.

“We’re sorry, Mr Lin. We didn’t think that these people would…”

According to what they said, these warriors of the Black Demons were the local gangsters who were up to no good.

Although they were warrior gods, they were the weakest ones around.

They didn’t have much strength and loved bullying those who were new in town, robbing these warriors who didn’t have much.

“That’s it?”

Lei Chong’s eyes widened due to how surprised he was.

When he first heard of their name ‘Black Demons’, it seemed as if they were some powerful organisation but he didn’t think that they were just like gangsters on the street.

As these people were taken away, Lei Chong let out a breath of relief.

“I have a feeling that the person who released the energy wasn’t them.”

Seeing how these people were being taken away, Lin Xiu commented on it.

“Not them?”

Lei Chong just got a break from being afraid but now he was feeling nervous once again.

He didn’t even get to see who it was that released that surge of energy and he had already spat out a mouthful of blood.

Those who were groaning on the ground earlier didn’t seem to be such powerful men.

“Don’t think too much about it. Let’s head upstairs.”

Lin Xiu quickly changed the topic.

Baili Haoling nodded her head and she was looking excited.

There were so many warriors here and she was hoping that there would be someone powerful who could fight.

Although she may not be able to be involved in the battles, it would still be nice to fight with some of the more powerful ones for experience.

After getting on the elevator, the three of them headed towards the highest floor.

The hotel that they said was the biggest one in town and it was built on a huge piece of land.

The highest floor was a training ground. During each Multi-city Contest, there would be lots of city lords present. All of them would be staying in the same hotel and when they had nothing much to do at night, they would gather here at the training ground.

As they entered the floor, they could clearly feel the heavy, oppressive aura in the air.

Lei Chong was feeling a little light headed as he arrived.

There were too many powerful warriors here which changed the air in the room.

Those who weren’t strong enough may not be able to stand the oppressive aura in the room.

“Lei Chong, are you alright?”

Lin Xiu checked up on Lei Chong.

“Yeah, I’m fine.”

Lei Chong clenched his jaw and started gathering his source energy. His complexion is slowly getting better.

As he looked at it, Lin Xiu did not reach out to help Lei Chong.

...

The ones earlier were released to suppress strength warriors like Lei Chong and it might kill him. The ones that they were feeling now were because there were warriors training and both were different types of oppression.

A certain amount of it would be good for Lei Chong.

Lin Xiu thought that there may be lots of warriors here and decided to leave Rollie and Little Bai in his room.

This floor was covered with glass walls and by looking through it, they could see that there were lots of warriors cultivating inside.

“Greetings, please show your room card.”

As Lin Xiu was about to enter, one of the staff reminded him.

“Here.”

After showing their room card, the staff finally allowed them inside.

Lin Xiu was the first to enter.

As he felt his surroundings, Lin Xiu’s pupils narrowed subconsciously.

“Be careful.”

...

“The gravity here is different from outside”

Lin Xiu reminded them.

The gravity here was intense. It was at least 50 times more than what they felt outside!

The gravity in the Warrior God Realm was also much higher than other planets but once he entered the floor, even Lin Xiu felt that he was being pressed onto the ground.

This was not a closed space but there was still a difference felt which shocked Lin Xiu.

Baili Haoling did not put too much thought into it and walked into the room.

As soon as she was inside, the look on her face changed.

She could no longer keep her balance.

Seeing how Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling had such reactions, Lei Chong knew how horrible the forces were inside.

He took a deep breath and started gathering his force energy before stepping into the room.

As soon as he was inside, his body started shaking.

The terrifying force was about to pin his body onto the ground.

There was also blood coming out of the corner of his mouth.

“Tsktstk! Not everyone would be able to enter this place.”

There were a few warriors who were watching Lin Xiu and his gang and they started mocking them.

“It’s better if you leave before getting killed.” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

‘Hahahahah…”

There were also other warriors who started laughing at them.

From their perspective, these people couldn’t even stand. How are they going to cultivate here? It was just a joke!

“Seems alright.”

Lin Xiu didn’t lose his balance, it was only Baili Haoling and Lei Chong.

He took the chance to look around and after analysing the strength of the warriors around him, Lin Xiu mumbled to himself.
