Chapter 539: Things in the lake

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

This mountain cave was like a cave, and it was extremely rugged inside.

As soon as Lin Xiu activated his mind, the source strength gathered in his palm, and in the next moment, the source strength was transformed into a red lotus.

The safflower released a red glow, and in this dark environment, it became brighter.

But the flame didn’t seem to be stable. The reason was that the Thunder Lotus fire energy in Lin Xiu’s body has not been completely absorbed, causing a certain load to the body.

“It must be that kid!” Wan Lu shouted loudly at this time, holding the lighting equipment and running frantically to the front.

Not to be outdone, Lao Bai, who was beside Wan Lu, also quickly ran forward.

Lin Xiu was a little out of breath at this time, and after continuing to run forward for a certain distance, Lin Xiu was surprised to find that the front side turned out to be an extremely empty area!

“Where is this…” Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide to see all this, his eyes filled with shock.

It was really spacious and wide, and there were many strange stalactites around.

A drop of water dripped onto Lin Xiu’s cheek, making Lin Xiu feel a touch of cold.

Moreover, the surrounding stalactites protruding from the ground are very huge, taller than people, and there are clusters of things like creepers growing on them, emitting a faint blue light.

Because of these lights, Lin Xiu didn’t need to keep releasing flames to light up the place.

He continued to look forward and found that there was a lake in front of him.

The lake water was emerald green. Lin Xiu approached, using the blue light emitted by the surrounding vegetation and seemed to see his own reflection.

And there were some white skeletons on the shore of the lake!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes couldn’t help but change.

He hadn’t noticed it just now, but now Lin Xiu, who found these skeleton bones, couldn’t help but change the look in his eyes.

“Where are you fleeing to!”

Before Lin Xiu could take a closer look, a loud roar came from behind.

Oops!

Lin Xiu’s pupils shrank, it was obvious that someone was chasing after him.

He looked around and it seemed that he had reached the dead-end of the cave.

There was no way, Lin Xiu quickly hid behind some huge stalactites growing from the ground.

Crackling-

And at this time, Lin Xiu’s body was still flashing with lightning.

98%!

Lin Xiu checked the system interface while hiding behind the huge stalactite, and found that his ‘Engulf’ skill had already helped him to absorb most of the energy of Thunder Lotus Fire.

But this 2% would still take some time. He hoped those people wouldn’t find him so quickly.

Otherwise, given his current situation, he would definitely be killed by these two.

“Where’s he?” As soon as the angry Wan Lu walked in, he found that this place was empty.

And there were many very thick stalactites growing out of it.

The surrounding vegetation seemed to be fluorescent, emitting a faint blue light.

“What on earth is this place…”

Lao Bai looked around and was surprised at this time.

Crack——

As he just lifted his foot and walked to the front, he heard a strange sound, as if he had stepped on something.

Looking down, he saw that it was a white hand bone.

“There’s something weird here.” Lao Bai’s face became cautious, and the long sword in his hand was clenched tightly.

Wan Lu nodded. Although he and Lao Bai were both fighting for Thunder Lotus Fire, the situation here was really weird, and now was not the time to quarrel.

“I know you are here, come out!”

Wan Lu looked around and shouted loudly.

As he shouted, there was an echo in the cave.

Lin Xiu, who was hiding behind a huge stalactite not far away, took a deep breath and continued to run the ‘Cultivation Technique’ to quickly absorb the surrounding energy.

Lin Xiu wasn’t so stupid to answer him.

Now he could only run the ‘Cultivation Technique’ frantically with his ‘Engulf skill to quickly absorb the energy of this Thunder Lotus Fire.

At the same time, the warriors behind also came over. These people were holding lighting equipment, which instantly illuminated the surroundings even brighter.

“Find him.” Wan Lu and Lao Bai said aloud when they saw their men and horses coming over at this time.

Lin Xiu frowned.

He knew that Wan Lu and Lao Bai were rank 7 warriors, and all their subordinates were rank 6 warriors. Under this state, if those people came over, he would be in big trouble.

What was he going to do?

“I think he should be right here.” Wan Lu looked at a huge stalactite in front of him, as if he felt something, he began to approach there step by step.

Oh no!

Lin Xiu opened his eyes and clenched the Dark Edge spear with both hands.

Now the icon on the ‘Engulf’ skill shows 99%!

Almost done!

Without completely absorbing the energy of this Thunder Lotus Fire, not only could he not use the power of this Thunder Lotus Fire, but some of the residual energy of this Thunder Lotus Fire was still destroying the cells in his own body, which affects him severely.

But now it’s too late to think so much, someone has already come to his side.

He could only fight!

Wan Lu clenched his hands into fists, looked at the stalactite near the lake in front, and told him directly that the man who devoured the Thunder Lotus Fire was here!

“Come out!”

When Wan Lu was about to approach the stalactite, the fists of both hands gathered a lot of energy, and the gloves became brighter.

Lin Xiu held the black awn spear tightly in both hands, killing intent burst out from his eyes, and when he was about to start to move, he heard a strange sound. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Clap clap-

“Huh?” Wan Lu, who was just approaching the other side, heard the sound clearly at this time. When he looked forward, he saw a lake in front of him, and it seemed to be boiling.

“The water in this lake is weird!”

When Lao Bai saw this scene, his eyes changed greatly.

Those warriors who were going to search in front were all taken aback.

All the lighting equipment shone towards the lake.

The lake water, which was perfectly calm, now made a crashing and splashing sound and they saw a huge black figure slowly emerging from the lake!

“What is this!?”

At this time, Wan Lu and Lao Bai couldn’t help but tremble, and they clearly felt that there were creatures in this lake that even they were afraid of!

Roar–
