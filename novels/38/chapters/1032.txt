Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Their warrior skills did not harm Ouyang Hang!

The array had appeared out of nowhere and had completely enveloped Ouyang Hang. This was how he was protected from their warriors skills!

Boom – –

Then, Lin Xiu finally got back onto the ground and appeared in the alley.

Bakk – –

With a snap of his fingers, the entire array disappeared.

“Lin Xiu, what was that?!”

Ouyang Hang came back to his senses. Just when he was about to relax, he looked at Lin Xiu in awe.

When he took a closer look at him, he could clearly see that there was a sourcemark on his forehead.

The source mark was black in colour and it was looking mysterious.

“Secret.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

“Stop playing tricks with me!”

The rank 9 warriors also noticed Lin Xiu who suddenly appeared right in front of them. They roared in rage and started attacking Lin Xiu all of a sudden.

It was obvious that they could feel that Lin Xiu was now their biggest threat.

They have to first get rid of Lin Xiu who was getting in their way.

“Be careful!”

Seeing how the warriors were rushing towards Lin Xiu, Ouyang Hang was shocked and he shouted at Lin Xiu to warn him.

But, as he finished his sentence, the warriors around them had already thrust their sharp weapons into Lin Xiu’s body.

But Lin Xiu was still standing on the same spot, motionless.

It’s not that he couldn’t dodge it! It was because he didn’t want to!

Boom boom boom – –

As their weapons landed on Lin Xiu, there was a soft groan.

Then, something shocking happened next. Even when they continued attacking him like mad men, there was nothing happening to Lin Xiu!

He was still standing on the same spot, allowing them to attack him.

“This! This is impossible!!”

The man that spoke earlier held a machete in his arm. He gathered all of the source energy in his body and transferred it onto his weapon.

He screamed before throwing the machete onto Lin Xiu’s head!

Clang – –

However, when the machete landed on Lin Xiu’s head, not only did he fail to break Li Xiu’s head; his machete was the one that broke because of the impact that it had!

The man subconsciously took a few steps back.

He stared at the machete in his hand that had been broken into two and he was lost.

How….how did this happen?!

His machete was made of the strongest metal ever found and it was one of the sharpest amongst its kind. How did it break so easily?!

When Ouyang Hang came back to his senses, he could clearly see that there was a layer of energy around Lin Xiu’s body.

This layer of protection was the reason why Lin Xiu’s body was unharmed.

“You…..are indeed much stronger than before.”

Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu and a bitter smile appeared on his face.

Lin Xiu’s abilities were progressing much faster than he had expected.

Each time he met Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu’s abilities would have grown tremendously.

No matter how hard he worked, it was impossible for him to follow behind Lin Xiu’s footsteps.

“Do it yourself. Kill them on your own for revenge.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

Then, he reached towards Ouyang Hang and gently touched his forehead.

Boom – –

It felt like the whole world was spinning and a strong surge of energy entered into Ouyang Hang’s body!

What…..what is this?!

Ouyang Hang could clearly feel his body being filled up with a strong powerful energy and his eyes widened in shock.

The energy passed by each of the meridiens in his body.

It was slowly transforming his entire body.

Boom – –

Then, as the energy entered his body, it felt as if his body was about to explode anytime!

He has levelled up!

He realised that he had broken his rank!

Not only has he become a rank 9 warrior, he was already at the peak of it!!

“Deal with it yourself.”

Lin Xiu said to Ouyang Hang.

“Kill him!!!”

The other man threw away his broken machete and glared at Lin Xiu and Ouyang Hang in rage.

“Leave.”

Lin Xiu looked at the warriors who were still attacking him and pushed them aside.

Without seeing what happened, the warriors suddenly felt a surge of energy coming at them and they were thrown onto the ground.

“You! Destroy him!!”

Ouyang Hang grabbed onto his sword as well and went for the warriors!

“Damn it!”

The man clenched onto his fist and there were lightning bolts that appeared on his fist.

He was ready to throw a punch at Ouyang Hang.

Xiu – –

However, when Ouyang Hang was still moving towards him, he slightly turned sideways and perfectly dodged the punch.

That punch missed its target.

Suddenly, Ouyang Hang was standing right behind him.

Xiu – –

As a bright light appeared from behind his body, the man was then chopped into two halves!

The rest of the rank 9 warriors were shocked.

How…..how did that happen?!

Ouyang Hang was merely a rank 8 warrior. How did he kill their comrade?

They stared at Ouyang Hang and slowly realised that Ouyang Hang’s abilities have improved greatly from before!

Not only was he now a rank 9 warrior, he was much stronger than they are now!

“The rest of you will be next.”

Ouyang Hang held onto his sword that was drenched in blood. WIthout any hesitation, he instantly attacked the warriors.

At this moment, he could feel that his body was filled with energy.

He looked at the warriors whom he was threatened by earlier and now, he was no longer afraid of them.

He knew that with his abilities now, he could kill them easily.

Clang clang clang – –

The rest of the warriors decided to attack first as Ouyang Hang got closer to them. They grabbed onto their weapons and started fighting him. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As the sound of the weapons colliding rang in the air, there was fresh blood being spilled out at every minute.

Ouyang Hang killed all of them except for one.

“Tell me, who is the one who sent you here?”

Ouyang Hang placed the sword on the man’s forehead and asked in a cold tone.

“I don’t know! I don’t know…”

The man’s knees turned weak and looked at Ouyang Hang in fear.

He had no idea how Ouyang Hang’s abilities became so much stronger in such a short period of time!

This was definitely the strength of a rank 9 warrior.

He looked behind Ouyang Hang and saw Lin Xiu.

Could it be because of him?
