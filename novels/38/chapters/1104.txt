Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

At this time, Bai Rui’s face was already a little hideous.

Previously, he also wanted to look for this ‘Silence’ skill.

Elder Yu gave him the skill card to absorb at the time, but he couldn’t learn this skill at all.

He tried to use this skill but there was no response at all.

But what he didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu actually learned this skill!

“Bai Tao! Call all the Sage warriors on the mission back!!!”

At this moment, Bai Rui spoke to the warrior below.

“Got it!”

When Bai Tao responded, his figure disappeared.

“Today, in Baidi City, there will be no more Bai family.”

While Lin Xiu said coldly, the earth-attribute energy ball on his neck suddenly burst into dazzling light.

In the next moment, the surrounding ground cracked instantly and a large number of rocks charged toward the Sage warrior in the sky!

Whoosh whoosh—

When these rocks came up, they all shattered and turned into rock cones.

Those Sage warriors of the Bai family looked at the rock cones that charged up from below and the expressions in their eyes changed slightly at this time.

All of them spread out the ‘Sphere’ for protection.

Lin Xiu didn’t give them the slightest time to breathe. At this moment, the electric energy, fire energy and water energy on the energy ball burst into dazzling light.

boom boom boom —

At this moment, the entire sky turned pitch black.

One after another huge thunder and lightning slashed directly from the sky.

And all the surrounding water sources flew into the air, forming water cones.

The flames that filled the sky also swept toward those Sage warriors!

Damn it!

Seeing these various attribute forces rushing in, the faces of those Sage warriors also became extremely ugly.

These attacks were really terrifying, even if they unfolded the ‘Sphere’ to resist, it was very difficult.

“Die!!!”

At this time, a Sage warrior displayed his body skill and instantly appeared behind Lin Xiu.

Holding a sword in his hand, he was about to slash at Lin Xiu’s body, cutting Lin Xiu in half!

Dang–

But Lin Xiu seemed to have eyes on his back. At this time, the Dark Edge spear in his right hand stretched out, blocking his attack.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu reflexively attacked with the Dark Edge spear in his hand!

That Sage warrior’s face changed greatly and when the sword in his hand was resisted, he was directly knocked out.

And at this time, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was full of power because his source strength gathered on it.

With a single stroke of the spear in his hand, the ‘Sphere’ of this Sage warrior was damaged!

pfft—

After the ‘Sphere’ was broken, there was a backlash, causing the Sage warrior to spit out blood directly.

But at this time, Lin Xiu hadn’t stopped the movements in his hands and frantically waved his spear.

Without the “Sphere” defense, this Sage warrior could not withstand Lin Xiu’s attack at all and instantly fell from the sky to the ground.

It all happened in a flash.

“All of you attack him!”

When Bai Rui saw this scene, his face became even more sinister and he let out a roar.

As soon as he finished speaking, more than 20 Sage warriors around him used the ‘Sphere’ to withstand those terrifying lightning and flames and charged directly toward Lin Xiu!

At this moment, the source marks on their foreheads lit up.

A large amount of source mark power were released to bombard Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu snorted coldly at this scene.

He didn’t even unfold his ‘Sphere’.

Just at the moment when those skills rushed toward him, Lin Xiu’s body suddenly turned into a golden statue!

‘Golden Body Immortality’!!!

Boom—

Those source mark powers impacted Lin Xiu’s body, making a loud explosion.

But at the next moment, they were shocked to find that Lin Xiu had not suffered any harm.

He was completely immune to the terrifying power generated in that second!

“go!!!”

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered and the source strength of his body erupted and the entire sky was suddenly a sea of ??fire.

‘Holy Level·Fire Refining Starlit Sky’!!!

After using ‘Skill Enhancement’, the skill strength of this ‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’ has directly evolved into holy level!

The entire sky was filled with dark blue flames.

And in the next moment, among these dark blue flames, there were incomparably huge fireballs, slamming down directly towards the bottom!

boom boom boom —

These fireballs were like falling meteorites and they looked extremely terrifying.

“Be careful!” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Those who were still shocked how Lin Xiu was still perfectly fine after being attacked by so many Sage warriors just now, quickly came to their senses as they watched these incomparably terrifying fireballs coming.

Their eyes were full of horror.

They wanted to dodge the impact of these fireballs, but they found that these huge fireballs seemed to have a tracking function, so they could not dodge at all.

bang bang bang-

As the huge fireballs hit their bodies, a huge sound suddenly erupted.

“what!!!”

With the sound of howling and screaming, the ‘Spheres’ of these warriors were directly melted and their entire being was covered by a huge flame.

The terrifying flames directly burned their bodies.

In a short moment, seven or eight Sage warriors fell directly from the sky.

Those flames also directly burned their bodies like black coal.

“Ding! Congrats on killing a Sage warrior-level warrior and gaining experience 264946464…”

“Ding! Congratulations, master…”

At this time, in Lin Xiu’s mind, the system prompts of gaining experience kept ringing.

But Lin Xiu ignored these prompts, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he continued to attack the surrounding Sage warriors.

Bai Rui had been hiding in the sky at the back, looking at the scene not far away, his expression became uglier.

In such a short period of time, Lin Xiu was able to kill so many warriors.

Moreover, these were all warriors of the Sage warrior level!

Lin Xiu ignored Bai Rui and while he was in ‘Fury’, he frantically waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

Gain experience! Gain experience!

Right now, Lin Xiu has only one thought.

The more warriors at the Sage warrior level, the better for Lin Xiu.

Only by constantly killing these Sage warrior-level warriors will his experience increase the fastest.

boom boom boom —

With a loud noise, several more Sage warriors fell directly from the sky!
