Chapter 83: Gold Skill – Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall!

The system notification sounded again. This time, many skill cards appeared as though it was raining cards.

“As expected of the ‘many skill cards’.” Lin Xiu kept all the cards while appreciating what had just happened.

There were a total of three silver skill cards and 12 bronze skill cards.

The three silver skill cards were all unorthodox weapon skills, while none of the bronze skill cards were enticing enough for Lin Xiu.

After all, an individual had limited focus, learning more skills might not be the best.

Lin Xiu thought for a moment before taking three unorthodox bronze skill cards and activated the Synthesis System.

The three chosen bronze skill cards floated, converged together, and instantly released a bright light. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Congratulations Master for successful Synthesis!”

Lin Xiu took a look. The three bronze skill cards actually formed a silver skill card!

“It can even do this?!” Lin Xiu was startled but instantly became elated.

‘So it has this function as well!’

He always thought that three same rank skill cards could only merge into the same rank skill card. Who would have thought that it could improve in rank?

Oh right, he remembered that he had yet to pick what type of weapon he wanted!

‘Is that it, as long as the weapon choice isn’t determined, it can improve in rank?’

Lin Xiu quickly took out the 9 remaining cards and merged them. He managed to merge into two silver skill cards twice and the last try was a fail, resulting in the loss of three cards.

This made Lin Xiu curse the system, he thought he had a 100% success rate.

“I only have six cards left and they are saber or sword skills… they don’t suit me.”

Lin Xiu held onto the six silver cards and muttered to himself.

He continued to merge them without hesitation.

After activating the Synthesis System, three silver skill cards floated towards each other and merged. In the next second, a white light blossomed.

Lin Xiu did not determine it to be a spear skill card.

He wanted to see if it could merge into a gold skill card. As long as it was a gold skill card, he could sell it or exchange it if it was not a spear skill.

“Gold skill card! Gold skill card!”

Lin Xiu became excited, and in the next second, a notification sounded.

“Congratulations Master, synthesis failed!”

“Damn it!” Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide. If the system was a tangible form standing in front of him, he would have given it a punch. ‘Congratulating me for failing? Aren’t you mocking me?’

“I don’t believe that my luck is that bad.” Lin Xiu did not hesitate and activated the Synthesis System with the last three silver cards.

It went through the same process and a white light flashed as the three silver cards disappeared.

‘Failed again?!’

“Congratulations Master, synthesis success!”

Lin Xiu immediately heard the system notification in the next second.

A card floated in the air, emitting a golden light aura.

“Spear… spear skill?!” Lin Xiu thought that it would have been a skill for other weapons. Who would have thought that it would be for the spear!!!

‘My luck transcends the heavens!’

Lin Xiu took the gold card. It was completely gold and looked extremely majestic.

On the card was a figure that had leaped up high with a spear. He was extremely realistic as though he was about to jump out of the card.

Gold skill – Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall!!!

There was an old poem that wrote ‘The waterfall cascade down from three thousand feet above,

like the galaxy river falling from the highest heaven’. The uniqueness of the skill could be described in one word, fast. It was not only fast but the power from it was extremely huge, to be able to amass the grandeur of a magnificent army consisting of thousands of men and horses from one person.

Lin Xiu’s entire body trembled with excitement. He took a deep breath and placed the card into his pocket.

With his rank 3 physique, he felt that he could learn a gold skill, but as his cultivation technique had yet to reach a set standard, he was not an official rank 3 and could not unleash the full potential of a gold skill.

And he had another draw chance!

The draws made Lin Xiu extremely happy and he quickly activated the lottery wheel and sent it spinning.

Very quickly, the needle stopped.

“Congratulations Master, you have obtained Rapid Growth Pack Second Edition x1! Do you want to use it now?”

Lin Xiu heard another notification.

‘Another Rapid Growth Pack?!’

Lin Xiu was stunned. He thought about it for a while before hitting the confirm button.

The Rapid Growth Gift Pack a month before had given him plenty of benefits. Although it was troublesome, it could increase his stats rapidly.

Just like before, another pile of heavy gears came out. But this time, it was much heavier!

The right and left bracers were 40kg each, the legs were 45kg each while the back was the most terrifying, it had reached 80kg!

“Bloody hell, does it want to toy people to death…”

Lin Xiu cursed under his breath, but he stripped his clothes off and equipped the gears.

But what surprised Lin Xiu was that he was not as out of breath as before.

After adapting to it, he still felt rather free. His speed under the weight was roughly equal to his quasi-warrior standard.

“Equip complete, Quick Growth System activated.”

“Progress 0/50000 (Note: 50 Potential points upon completion)”

Once Lin Xiu equipped the gears, the notification rang out again.

“It’s the same again, it will rise in number.”

But the 50 potential points made Lin Xiu excited.

After finishing the draw, Lin Xiu sat on the android wolf and continued ahead.

After traveling for about 2 kilometers, Lin Xiu suddenly heard a beast roar from a distance as well as combat.

‘There are people?!’

Lin Xiu frowned, he could even hear them calling for help.

Ordinary people would never choose this path when traveling between cities and chose other means of transportation. Those who came here were not seeking wealth but to temper themselves.

“Quick! Stop him!” A man ahead saw a Silverclaw Black Bear and trembled.

Rank 2 Silverclaw Black Bear was large with extremely sharp claws. Most importantly, it was fast, extremely fast!
