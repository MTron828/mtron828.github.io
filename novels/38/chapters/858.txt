Chapter 859: Crushed (2)

“What!!!”

Those warriors who rushed down at an extremely fast speed were hit by the terrifying flaming birds and were instantly covered in flames.

They only had time to let out a roar and their bodies were instantly annihilated into bones.

Some, even the bones were annihilated by this terrifying flame.

Whoosh whoosh—

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and when he swung it out, it seemed like afterimages appeared.

One after another, the warriors were all stabbed through the head by Lin Xiu.

No matter how they defend, even if they unfold the ‘Sphere’, they were stabbed.

“Now, can you tell me where you guys come from?”

Soon, these warriors who were aggressive when they came, now only the last warrior is left.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s blood-stained spear pointed at him, his body couldn’t help but tremble.

Powerful, Lin Xiu’s strength is really too powerful, so powerful that he feels that he can’t deal with it at all.

“you you...”

His body was trembling and he never thought that Lin Xiu’s strength would be so powerful.

It’s simply crushing! Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Earthlings, how could they have such terrifying strength!

“Tell me, where do you guys come from.”

Lin Xiu was holding a Dark Edge spear, the tip of the spear was in front of his forehead, but before it touched his forehead, it made him feel an extremely terrifying chill.

“Despicable earthling, do you think I’ll tell you!”

He roared with a ferocious face and reached out to grab the head of the Dark Edge spear to stop the spear and prevent it from stabbing his forehead.

“what!!!”

At that time, when his hand just touched Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear, a powerful electric current burst out.

The man’s arm instantly turned black.

The entire arm was instantly electrocuted.

His body fell to the ground, curled up like a complicatedly cooked shrimp.

“Planet Namir?”

Lin Xiu looked at him and said lightly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the eyes of the man who was suffering from severe pain suddenly changed slightly.

Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed.

Sure enough, he guessed it right, but how could these people find where the earth is?

It probably has something to do with Nan Jing.

“Since you won’t say it, then goodbye.”

As Lin Xiu spoke, he swung the spear in his hand and killed him immediately.

At this time, Lin Xiu rushed over to the Nan Family.

The impact of what happened here is really too great. The entire Sky City now knows that the boy who was wanted a year ago has now returned.

“The old man should be fine, right?”

In the Nan family, Nan Xiang, the head of the Nan family, said aloud to himself while walking back and forth.

“Ah Fu? Have you heard the news?”

At this moment, he seemed to hear footsteps and immediately turned to look behind him.

But what he saw was indeed a man with a long spear and a long white coat.

“Where did they come from?”

Lin Xiu looked at Nan Xiang at this time, then said lightly.

“You...you dare to break into our Nan family! You are courting death!”

When he saw Lin Xiu’s appearance, he said in shock and anger.

“Someone! Kill him!”

Nan Xiang roared angrily.

But around, no one responded to him.

“I’m sorry, everyone who wants to kill me are dead.”
