Chapter 535: About the Lotus Fire

“If we can get this lotus fire, that’d be great but if we can’t, forget it.” The location where Luo Yue and Lin Xiu were hiding was very safe. At this time, Luo Yue said aloud while looking at the scene in front.

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu nodded.

According to the information that he had read earlier, this energy body in the shape of a lotus flame has different main attributes.

Just like the ice lotus fire Luo Yue has, its attribute was mainly ice but it also has the fire attribute.

And Thunder lotus fire’s main attribute was thunder.

These attributes of lotus fires could be found by searching on the website of the Warrior union.

But Lin Xiu didn’t find the red lotus fire he absorbed previously.

Thinking of that red lotus fire, Lin Xiu could feel that it was a pure flame energy body, without any other attributes mixed.

“By the way, I feel that the red lotus fire I absorbed before is a little different from the ice lotus fire you absorbed, and the thunder lotus fire now.” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue curiously as the fight went on and no winner had emerged yet.

Now that the two were next to each other, Luo Yue could feel the warmth of Lin Xiu’s breath.

“Red lotus fire is the purest energy body.” Luo Yue was silent for a while, then whispered to Lin Xiu.

“The red lotus fire is not mixed with any attribute energy, unlike the ice lotus fire and this thunder lotus fire that I absorbed.”

“Then, is the red lotus fire I absorbed weaker?” Lin Xiu said at this moment, a little puzzled.

After all, there were flames that coexist with other attributes, and they seemed to be more powerful.

“No.” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

Just when Luo Yue was about to say something, the whole ground vibrated wildly in an instant.

What happened!?

Lin Xiu, who saw this scene, at this moment, looked to the front, and saw a huge beetle-like thing rushing out from the space crack!

Seeing this scene with his eyes, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes couldn’t help changing.

What the hell is this thing? It’s so terrifying.

This ghost has a pair of huge eyes, which are like light bulbs, emitting a bright red light.

And at this time it swung its forelimbs like a scythe.

With such a single stroke, he even cut off seven or eight of those rank 6 warriors in the battle!

Those rank 6 warriors still had their ‘Sphere’ unfolded.

They got slashed by the forelimb of the scythe of the huge creature, and even the ‘Sphere’ broke!

“What kind of monster is this!?” Wan Lu and Lao Bai, who were originally fighting, also had a change in expressions at this time.

Boom boom boom —

But before they could react, the monster attacked them!

With every attack, the ground vibrated violently.

“Damn it! Lao Bai, it seems that we can only kill this monster, and then decide the outcome, what do you think!” Wan Lu looked at Lao Bai at this time, and said aloud.

“Good idea!” Lao Bai nodded and said, in this situation, even if he snatched the Thunder Lotus Fire, he would not be able to keep it.

They could only first kill this terrifying creature that came out of another dimension.

“Kill this monster first!”

Just when Wan Lu, Lao Bai, and the others were all focused on attacking the terrifying creature, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed.

“Good opportunity, let’s go.” Luo Yue also seemed to realize something at this time, and said suddenly.

Lin Xiu nodded. Just when these people were all focused on attacking the giant beetle, Lin Xiu’s figure moved and rushed straight ahead!

Lin Xiu’s speed was very fast, and all those people were attacking the beetle now. At this time, he didn’t notice that Lin Xiu had already rushed towards the thunder lotus!

In just a short moment, Lin Xiu reached the position of Thunder Lotus.

Lin Xiu crouched down, leaning against the surrounding rocks to cover his figure.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but hold his breath when he looked at Thunder Lotus who was close at hand.

This thunder lotus looks like a lotus flower, and there are many lightning flashes in the lavender flame.

Just looking at it like this, Lin Xiu felt a terrifying pressure in the flames, which made him tremble a little.

“Phew.” Lin Xiu took a deep breath at this moment. He wanted to stretch his hand over there, but hesitated.

Thinking of how he devoured the red lotus fire for the first time, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but feel his scalp tingling.

According to the information on the Warrior Union, the preparations required to devour the lotus fire of different attributes were different, generally by approaching the lotus fire, and then using the ‘cultivation technique’ to slowly guide the energy of the lotus fire through one’s pores and absorbed into one’s body.

This method was the safest, but the pain experienced was also stronger. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

After all, it is a slow process to absorb all this terrifying energy into one’s body.

“There’s someone!?” At this moment, Wan Lu, who was fighting with the huge space monster, clearly felt something, and turned around abruptly to look behind him.

Lin Xiu also clearly heard the voice, and his expression changed slightly at this time.

The cowardly starve to death while the brave endures!

Lin Xiu roared inwardly, then opened his mouth and swallowed the Thunder Lotus.

He actually devoured this thunder lotus in one bite!

“You brat, hand over Thunder lotus!!!”

Wan Lu had already rushed over there at this time, and when he saw Lin Xiu swallowing the Thunder Lotus fire in one bite, he suddenly became furious.

They had been fighting for this Thunder Lotus Fire for so long, but it has become the benefit of others. How could this not make him angry?

Just when he was about to rush towards Lin Xiu, he saw a white flame rushing towards him in front of him!

Wan Lu’s eyes changed, and his body dodged when he felt the horror of the flames.

Boom—

The flame instantly hit the rock behind him, and at this moment, all the rocks turned into ice sculptures.

While surprised, Wan Lu turned to the front, only to find that Lin Xiu’s figure had disappeared!

“Damn!!!”

Wan Lu roared loudly, and smashed the surrounding rocks with a fist.

“Why did you swallow it like this?” Luo Yue hugged Lin Xiu and ran to the other side quickly, while she was running, she said aloud.

Crackling-

Now Lin Xiu was in a critical condition, and there were lightning flashes all over his body!
