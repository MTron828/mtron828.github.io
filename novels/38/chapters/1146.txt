1147 Last Desperate Effort

Boom boom —

Because of the appearance of his ‘source mark’, the entire ground shook at this moment.

The source mark power of the earth attribute!

The surrounding rocks all flew up and even the graves of the back mountain flew into the sky.

At this moment, all of them charged towards Lin Xiu’s body!

Lin Xiu, there is absolutely no way to dodge!

At this moment, a loud noise suddenly erupted.

Even the warriors in the holy city outside felt that the ground they were on was shaking wildly.

The old ancestor of the Bai family, when he thought that Lin Xiu was going to disappear completely, he felt something clearly and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

Because he clearly felt that there was a strong aura of life in the place where the extremely thick dust was raised in front of him.

not dead.

Lin Xiu is not dead!

The old man’s face became extremely ugly. He, a warrior of the God warrior level, just used the source mark power to deal with Lin Xiu.

But Lin Xiu doesn’t seem to be dead at all!

“Huhu...”

At this time, as the dust slowly dissipated, Lin Xiu was out of breath.

This God warrior-level power is indeed incomparably powerful.

Just now, Lin Xiu felt an incomparably powerful force charging toward him.

But fortunately, Lin Xiu reacted very quickly and directly used the ‘Golden Body Immortality’ skill to resist the attack.

His eyes looked forward.

“Damn...”

And at this time, Lin Xiu found that after killing Bai Qi, he didn’t level up at all!

A little bit more to go!

Now the progress bar of experience was at 99.9999%...

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but curse.

Just a little bit, if he simply killed any warrior or evolved beast, he could level up.

But here right now, there wasn’t any!

And if he didn’t reach the level of the god warrior, he couldn’t fight him at all.

Lin Xiu is extremely depressed now and his face has become extremely ugly.

“Die!”

And the old ancestor of the Bai family couldn’t take care of that much anymore and charged directly towards Lin Xiu!

After all, he has the strength of the god warrior. At this moment, his figure flashed and he appeared in front of Lin Xiu in an instant.

That golden long sword stabbed at Lin Xiu’s head!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly and the Dark Edge spear in his hand was about to resist his attack.

Dang–

The long sword pierced the body of the Dark Edge spear that Lin Xiu held in both hands and a spark suddenly sputtered out.

And Lin Xiu’s body also flew out because of this extremely strong impact.

He slammed into the rock behind him heavily and he spat out a mouthful of blood in an instant.

Lin Xiu’s eyes changed and in the next moment, he turned around and ran to the back.

There was still blood coming out of his shoulders.

Originally, with Lin Xiu’s powerful body’s recovery speed, it should have healed by now.

But the old man’s golden sword was obviously strange, so Lin Xiu’s wound could not heal now.

And there was a lot of blood coming out.

Continuing to fight now is extremely unfavorable for Lin Xiu.

He had to find a warrior to kill and upgrade to level 70! ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Where are you going!”

The old man sneered.

At this time, the old man triggered his thoughts and the surrounding space seemed to have undergone some kind of change.

boom–

Lin Xiu, who rushed to the other side, suddenly felt as if he had hit an invisible barrier and a sharp pain came from his body.

What is this time!?

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and his hands touched the front.

In the front, an invisible barrier seems to have appeared, blocking the entire area in front.

“Do you think you can flee?”

The old man said with a sneer at this time, holding the golden long sword in his hand and slowly walking over.

Now his face has become extremely gloomy.

A mere boy at the level of Sage warrior actually played him a few times.

At this time, Lin Xiu tightly held the Dark Edge spear in his hands.

Is this the power of the god warrior?

This kind of power actually caused the surrounding space to be directly separated.

There is no other way but to fight.

Before the old man could rush over, Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge spear in both hands!

boom boom boom —

With the waving of the long spear, flaming birds burst out one after another and charged directly towards the old man!

“Humph!” The old man looked at this scene without any evasion.

The pale golden ‘Sphere’ he unfolded directly blocked those flaming birds.

For him, it seems that there is no impact!

In the next moment, the figure of this old man instantly appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu subconsciously held the spear to resist, but the powerful force made Lin Xiu let go the Dark Edge spear in his hand!

He flew directly to the other side.

The old man’s swordsmanship was very sharp and at this time, he kept charging towards Lin Xiu.

bang bang bang-

The long sword stabbed at the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded and a loud sound erupted.

Soon, due to the high-intensity attacks, a lot of cracks appeared on Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ in the next moment.

damn...

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth. At this time, he wanted to flee to the other side, but he found that he was under the attack of the old man and had no way to leave.

And now Lin Xiu can only continue to use his source strength to strengthen the ‘Sphere’.

Otherwise, if the ‘Sphere’ is broken, there is a real possibility that he will be beheaded and killed!

Now it would be nice if someone could help...

and many more!

When Lin Xiu thought about it, he seemed to have thought of something and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

With a triggering of his thoughts, at this moment, Lin Xiu directly used the ‘Exotic Summoning’ skill!

boom–

With a dull sound, a huge opening was suddenly opened above the head.

Taking a closer look at this time, a huge black evolved beast ran out of it!

The old man seemed to sense something. He looked up subconsciously and saw the beast that appeared.

“Get lost!”

And Lin Xiu seized this opportunity; the source strength of his whole body exploded out and caused the old man flew a few steps away, then Lin Xiu rolled forward and took the long spear that fell.

Roar–

The evolved beast of the other dimension made a huge roar at this time and it was about to attack the old man.

“Courting death!”

The old man snorted coldly, waved his long sword and a huge shadow of the long sword appeared, about to split the evolved beast in half!

But at this moment, a terrifying force rushed over and directly cut off the head of this evolved beast!
