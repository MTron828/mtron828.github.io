Chapter 506: Bloodbath

The security guards didn’t know if they could believe him and quickly walked into the control room. Then, they used the phone in the room and contacted Zhao Xia.

“Who is it?” Zhao Xia was still discussing with his father what the Shadow Squad should do to get rid of Lin Xiu when his phone started ringing.

He took a peek at it and noticed that the screen showed that it was the security guards.

“The security room?” Zhao Xia frowned in confusion.

“Have a look at it.”

“En.” Zhao Xia nodded his head. He walked to the side of the room and answered the call.

“Hello. What is it?”

“Young Master Zhao, greetings.” The security guard greeted him as soon as they heard his voice.

“A friend of yours is here and he is saying he wants to meet you. You…”

“My friend?” Zhao Xia was stunned.

He thought about it hard and he didn’t have many friends in Bai Di City. Perhaps it was one of his classmates who finally knew his power in Bai Di City and decided to come and flatter him?

Zhao Xia couldn’t help but feel proud as he thought about it.

“What is his name?”

“He said that it was Lin Xiu.” The security guard replied.

Zhao Xia, who was still being boastful a second ago, suddenly looked as if he had seen a ghost.

The change of expression on his face happened so fast that it made him look extremely ridiculous.

Zhao Xia obviously knew his name and when he heard that Lin Xiu was here looking for him, he thought about the terrifying skill that Lin Xiu showed back in the western industrial area. He couldn’t help but shudder.

Pakk – –

His phone slipped out of his hand and it fell onto the ground.

“What’s wrong with you?” When Zhao Xiong saw what happened, he couldn’t help but frown.

Zhao Xia quickly picked up his phone and then said in a trembling tone, “Dad, he’s here…”

“He?” Zhao Xiong was shocked and quickly understood what he meant, “It’s that fella?!”

“Yeap…” Zhao Xia nodded his head as he could feel a chill run down his spine. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

This fella must be crazy?! How dare he come alone to the Zhao mansion?!

“Madness!” After hearing Zhao Xia’s reply, his father’s face immediately turned cold.

Lin Xiu had the balls to come to their home so casually. It felt like Lin Xiu was looking down on the Zhao family.

“Kill him. Don’t let him take another step forward.” Zhao Xiong stood up and took over the phone, giving orders to the security guards who were on the other end of the phone call.

When the security guards heard who it was, they were shocked but soon understood what was asked of.

That was Zhao Xiong’s voice.

The security guard who was on the phone turned around and pulled his thumb across his neck as a sign.

The guards on the outside saw what the man inside the room did and nodded their heads.

Some of the guards who were in the hiding took their guards and pointed them towards Lin Xiu’s head.

They took a rough aim and then pulled the trigger.

Xiu Xiu Xiu – –

There were multiple laser beams and all of a sudden, there were bullets headed towards Lin Xiu’s head!

Boom Boom Boom – –

But Lin Xiu’s reaction was too quick. Within a second, Lin Xiu picked up his black spear and blocked all of the laser beams that were headed his way.

“Looks like Young Master Zhao isn’t too happy with me.” Lin Xiu smiled at the security guards and joked about it.

“You’re a dead man!” The security guard’s expression changed and he took out a dagger from his waist.

The dagger was extremely shaped and there were still bloodstains on it. At that moment, there was a bright glow at the edge of the dagger as well.

`

These men were not skillful warriors but they were still quick on their feet and equipped with assassin skills.

All of them found the right time together and started dashing towards Lin Xiu from different directions.

Lin Xiu remained motionless and he didn’t even look flustered.

“Too slow.”

These men thought that they would be able to attack Lin Xiu with their speed but Lin Xiu shook his head.

Xiu – –

There was a semicircle drawn by the spear and the guards who were headed towards him suddenly felt a sharp pain on their chest.

At the very next moment, before any of them got close to Lin Xiu, they were already chopped into halves!

There was blood splashing everywhere.

Horrifying. He was absolutely horrifying.

The men who were standing behind him, holding onto guns in their hands, jumped at the horrifying scene.

But they were professionals. Even when they were completely shocked by what happened, they still tried to fire their guns at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and slowly walked towards them with the long spear in his arm.

Lin Xiu may be walking slowly but none of the laser beams could hit him.

Each of them looked as if they were about to hit him but Lin Xiu could easily dodge them with one small movement of his head.

His reaction speed was way too scary!

“Well, my turn.” Lin Xiu was already at the door when he said those words.

His body moved swiftly and with the long spear in his hands, he dashed towards the men who were shooting at him with their laser guns.

Although they were all hidden, Lin Xiu could still clearly sense where they were hiding at.

As he lifted his spear that was glowing at the tip, there were flashes of bloody fireworks that lit up the place.

“Tell me. Where is Zhao Xia?” Lin Xiu pointed the tip of his spear at one of the security guards and asked.

The man was seated on the ground, filled with fear.

He looked around at those men who tried to kill Lin Xiu and they were all killed by Lin Xiu instead!

And he only used one skill! Lin Xiu only activated one skill and he killed all of his colleagues.

When he felt the tip of the spear on his forehead, he could feel the pain that caused his body to tremble.

“Over…..over there.” The man had no time to think and pointed at the direction on his right as he spoke in a shaky tone.

“In 205…”

After hearing what he said, he took away the spear from the man’s forehead and walked in the direction that he was told.

The man stared at Lin Xiu as he walked away with Dark Edge. His body instantly turned weak as he lay on the ground with his forehead full of sweat.

The feeling of being stuck in the moment of life and death….was horrible!

“They’re dead! He killed all of them!” Zhao Xia and Zhao Xiong were watching the entire thing through the projection and they were both utterly shocked!

The security system of the Zhao family that was incredibly tough was useless in defending Lin Xiu.

He got rid of all of them within seconds.

“Quick! We have to go! Get them to put on a level 1 defense!” Zhao Xiong screamed and dragged his son along with him.

They could no longer stay here even if this was their home!
