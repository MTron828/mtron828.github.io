Chapter 526: Start To Gain Experience

A black figure burst out from it.

“Damn!”

Seeing those things appear, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

Ants, black ants.

But these ants were very big, they looked like the size of a human’s palm.

That mouth was like iron pliers, it looked very terrifying.

There was a huge number of ants, rushing out from the ground frantically, and seemed to be surrounding Lin Xiu and Luo Yue!

And Lin Xiu also saw some grayish-white skeletons from the place where the ground exploded.

It seemed that many warriors had died here. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Black secluded ants, rank 5 evolved beasts.” Luo Yue seemed to know these darn things and said aloud at this time.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded. Although there were a lot of these things, Lin Xiu was not afraid.

At this time, he waved the Dark Edge spear and flames burst out from it.

‘Awe of the phoenix’!

This was the most frequently used move by Lin Xiu. The power of this move cannot be said to be particularly strong, but it does not consume too much source strength and can cause a lot of damage.

As the flaming bird charged towards the front, those black ants were all covered by flames and burned.

After all, these black secluded ants were only rank 5 evolved beasts, and generally, such evolved beasts were not resistant to fire. Soon, a large number of system prompts were heard.

“Congratulations to the Master for killing the rank 5 black secluded ants and gaining 2,500,000 experience!”

“Congratulations to the Master…”

A bunch of prompts for gaining experience kept ringing.

2.5 million experience!

Damn!

Lin Xiu was shocked at this time – how could he gain so much experience!?

When he killed the rank 7 evolved beast just now, he only had about ten million experience.

Lin Xiu felt that this system was very strange. Sometimes he gained more experience by killing evolved beasts, and sometimes he gained less.

Isn’t the experience gained according to the rank and rarity of the evolved beast?

Lin Xiu was a little confused, but at this time, Lin Xiu couldn’t care less, so he quickly killed those black secluded ants with flames!

After calculating that he killed almost 100 and gained more than 200 million experience, Lin Xiu found that all these black ants had been wiped out.

All these black secluded ants were scorched on the ground, giving off a strange smell.

“This kind of black secluded ant is quite rare.” Luo Yue said aloud.

Lin Xiu nodded, and there was still joy on his face.

The appearance of this black secluded ant could be said to be an unexpected joy.

Taking a closer look at his system interface, Lin Xiu found that he had accumulated more than two billion experiences, but it was still far from leveling up.

After all, it takes 15 billion experience to get to the next level.

After crossing this barren area and walking to the front, mountains and rivers appeared again.

“This is the real Thunder Valley, right?” Lin Xiu looked down from the high place and there was a stone road that seemed man-made, going all the way down.

There were towering cliffs on both sides around, and some strange plants grow on the cliffs.

After walking into the hinterland of the Thunder Valley, the surrounding lightning became more and more frequent. Some of the lightning struck the surrounding stones which exploded and small stones burst out.

Lin Xiu looked around, and there were still many corpses of warriors on this road.

It seems that a lot of people died here.

The two moved forward at a very fast speed, and soon, they felt a strong tremor in front of them.

In the distance ahead, a large number of warriors appeared. These warriors were well-equipped, and they were holding weapons to fight against a large number of evolved beasts.

These evolved beasts were completely black, with different shapes, and there were some purple electric lights on their bodies.

Some warriors were accidentally knocked down by those evolved beasts, and their bodies were immediately covered by purple lightning.

Although ordinary high-level warriors have undergone electric shock training, the electric lights that burst out from the bodies of these evolved beasts were obviously quite powerful.

At this moment, the warriors who were affected by the lightning widened their eyes and fell into paralysis.

In this case, if one fell into a state of paralysis, he would be bitten by a large number of evolved beasts into several pieces in an instant.

The scene looked extremely intense.

“Kill!!!”

Those warriors also had reddened eyes at this time, and they fought frantically with those evolved beasts.

Luo Yue originally wanted Lin Xiu to go the other way. After all, there were too many evolved beasts, and it would take a lot of time to fight.

“Luo Yue, wait for me here, I’ll get rid of these evolved beasts first.” Lin Xiu looked at the evolved beasts in front of him and was eager to try.

The sweetness of killing the black secluded ants just now made Lin Xiu desperately want to gain experience.

Only with enough experience could he quickly level up. After all, he was still too weak.

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help clenching the Dark Edge Spear in his right hand. In the next moment, his whole body was like a shadow, and he rushed over in an instant!

“Damn…”

The warrior in front was still fighting hard when he saw a figure rushing over.

Who is this!?

Before they could see clearly, they saw a flash of cold light, and the heads of those evolved beasts were directly stabbed.

In a short period of time, more than a dozen evolved beasts died!

“Captain, who is that!?” A man with blood on his arms retreated to the back at this time, looking at the figure that rushed into the front of the herd.

“I don’t know either.” A middle-aged man holding a huge sword shook his head and said.

He didn’t know what was going on. At this time, he looked at the man in front of him who was madly dancing with the long spear in his hand, and instantly stabbed a dozen evolved beasts in the head – his face was full of shock.

These evolved beasts were all around rank 5, so they were not particularly difficult to deal with.

The more troublesome thing was that these evolved beasts carried lightning on their bodies, and these lightnings would cause a certain paralysis effect to their bodies.

In the middle of a battle, it was extremely dangerous if one couldn’t react quickly!

But the lightning that burst from those evolved beasts was transmitted to Lin Xiu’s body, and Lin Xiu seemed totally fine.

“What a freak…”

Seeing this scene, the middle-aged man couldn’t help but say aloud.

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for killing the rank 5 blade armor beast and gaining 1,550,000 experience!”

These evolved beasts have 1.55 million experience… Although they were a lot less than the black secluded ants, there were many of them!

There were at least hundreds of these evolved beasts!
