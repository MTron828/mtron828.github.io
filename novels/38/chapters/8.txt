Chapter 9: Gaining Rank 3 Odd Crystal!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Those few people’s eyes reddened, and they had a fanatic look on their faces as they charged and attacked that color-changing python violently!

Lin Xiu continued hiding in those bushes and held his breath.

Although that rank 3 mutated evolved beast was strong, it couldn’t handle the attacks of so many warriors.

Moreover, the vital part of snakes was the heart. Even though it had evolved and became so huge, that gigantic body still fell to the ground gradually with a loud thud.

“Hahaha, it’s dead. It’s finally dead!” One of the men laughed heartily.

Though they had managed to kill this color-changing python, most of their teammates were dead as well.

That green substance that the color-changing python spat out had corroded many people’s bodies.

Just as Lin Xiu was about to get up, he accidentally knocked onto the tree at the side, making a sound.

“Get out right now!” Just then, a man with a long sword pointed toward where Lin Xiu was hiding.

Lin Xiu cursed himself for making that sound. He currently had the strength of a beginner warrior, and it was quite impossible for him to deal with an official warrior.

“So you’re the one who attracted this thing over, huh?” That guy sneered when he saw Lin Xiu.

“What are you standing there for? Come here!”

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and walked over obediently.

“Help me remove the skin of this color-changing python and dig out the odd crystal, then carry my brothers back. If you disobey, I will kill you with my sword.” He sneered and pointed the tip of his sword at Lin Xiu.

“Hurry up and dig, useless thing!” The guy walked over and directly kicked Lin Xiu to the ground as he yelled.

As the guy had just fought with the color-changing python, he seemed slightly injured at this moment.

Lin Xiu, who fell to the ground and had his back facing him, had a ferocious gleam in his eyes.

Ever since he transmigrated, he solemnly swore that he would not be a good-for-nothing like the former owner of this body.

He glanced at the ground and saw the battle blade.

That person was already injured, and his strength must be greatly reduced!

Kill…!

As this thought appeared in Lin Xiu’s head, he quickly predicted that guy’s actions and picked up the battle blade from the ground. He then swung the blade at him!

There was a loud bang and the guy’s arm that was holding the long sword was instantly chopped off by Lin Xiu!

“You…” His eyes widened in complete disbelief.

“I forgot to tell you that I hate people calling me useless. Also, don’t step on me,” scoffed Lin Xiu.

The guy who lost his right arm fell to the ground and wailed.

The other dead bodies on the ground were corroded by that venom secreted out by the color-changing python, and they were about to turn into just white bones.

“Hahaha, kill me if you dare! Otherwise, my Zhang family wouldn’t let you go for sure!” The guy’s face contorted in anger as he laughed sinisterly.

A warrior was physically stronger than ordinary people and even though the pain from his severed arm was intolerable, he wouldn’t lose his life because of it.

“Zhang family?” Lin Xiu knitted his brows. There were still several warrior families in this future world.

And Lin Xiu seemed to have heard about the Zhang family too.

“That’s right! You better send me to the A20 district’s medical station and attach my arm back. Then, cut both your arms off. Otherwise… I will make sure you die a graveless death!” The guy bellowed in anger.

It was obvious that he was already slightly irrational.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s face darkened as well.

“Who do you think you are?” Lin Xiu sneered as he held his battle blade and stood by his side.

“You want to kill me? Do you know the consequences of killing me? I will kill your entire family…” The guy saw the ferocious gleam in Lin Xiu’s eyes and his expression changed instantly, but he still threatened viciously.

“Bang.” Right then, Lin Xiu directly stabbed him in the chest without any hesitation.

The man’s eyes widened in disbelief.

“Sorry, I don’t have a family.”

“Ding~~”

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 1 warrior, you’ve gained 2500 experience points.”

“Congratulations Master on leveling up to level 6, you’ve gained 7 potential points.”

“Congratulations Master on killing a warrior for the first time, you’ve gained a chance to draw a prize!”

The icy cold voice resounded in his head, but Lin Xiu didn’t have time to rejoice over it as those bodies on the ground made him feel disgusted.

He held his chest and gagged a few times at the side before this uncomfortable feeling gradually faded away.

Since he had gained another 7 potential points, where should he add them to? F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Strength, physique, and speed – these three should be balanced as there was no point in just having strength alone.

Lin Xiu thought about it and decided to add these 7 points to speed and physique. Right now, his physique and speed had increased to 40 points!

After he was done adding, Lin Xiu felt a sense of comfort around his body.

He was finally a regular person now, right?

He looked at the ground over at the other side and everyone in that adventure team just now was dead. Also, that color-changing python wasn’t making any sound either.

The color-changing python’s body was top-notch and worth a lot of money, but this thing was too huge and difficult to carry.

Lin Xiu thought about it and took out his battle blade and swung it at that python’s head.

“Bang.” A dreary sound resounded and a crack appeared on the snake’s head.

‘It’s really hard…’

After chopping many times, Lin Xiu was finally able to split the python’s head apart. That glow in the middle of its head was instantly visible.

Odd crystals were a kind of crystalline lens that existed in evolved beasts and a source of energy for these gigantic beasts.

Warriors could cultivate and absorb the energy inside, thereby enhancing their cultivation.

They could also use it as a source of power for some machines.

“This should fetch a good price.” Lin Xiu took this odd crystal and smiled.

He found another two odd crystals from these people’s bags. It seemed like they obtained them from hunting evolved beasts. However, those two pieces were quite smaller and should be from a rank 1 evolved beast.

After rummaging through, he didn’t find any other special items that he could take. Besides, their weapons were not suitable for him either.

Lin Xiu didn’t think much and continued going deeper into the forest.

It was most important to level up and increase in strength right now. He probably wouldn’t be so lucky again if he encountered this type of adventure team that wanted to kill him.

He hadn’t realized that he had run in the opposite direction just now and if he continued moving forward, he would be going deeper into the forest!
