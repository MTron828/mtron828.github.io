Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

At this moment, a bright sound rang out from the middle.

Every match at the Sacred Region Academy has a referee and this time was no exception.

“Today’s match is Class 10 against Class 5, please go to the stage!”

“Let’s go up.” Lin Xiu looked and said to Zhang Yin, who was already wearing a combat suit.

Every class would issue their own class’s combat suit. Lin Xiu and the rest had a very faint “10” printed on their combat suits.

“En.” Zhang Yin and the others then walked together with Lin Xiu.

When they were about to arrive at the platform, everyone used force and leaped on it.

“Hey, didn’t expect that you guys really dared to come.” Wu Fei glanced at Lin Xiu and others and then snorted.

He also held a long spear in his hand, a silver spear, no doubt, he was also a spear user.

At this time, he looked at Lin Xiu and was very cautious. He studied the video recording of the match at the Tower of Tournament. Lin Xiu was very strong and if Wu Fei was fighting against him alone, he wasn’t confident that he could win. But if two people used targeted skills against Lin Xiu, this was another story!

“Why not!” Li Ping stared at Wu Fei at this time, then said coldly.

Seeing Li Ping’s gaze, Wu Fei also revealed a sinister look like a poisonous snake.

“Well, the team members are ready, the match shall begin!” At this time, an old man came over and stood in the middle, then smiled and said.

“It’s you!?” Lin Xiu was stunned when he saw the referee.

Because this referee was obvious that the old man at the redemption center!

Why is he here?

“I get points for being a referee, old man here has to earn some points to live eh.” The old man looked at Lin Xiu and spoke helplessly.

Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched – does he even need any more points? Who would believe him, huh!

This old man actually lent him 100,000 points directly to buy the Fire scale combat suit.

“Alright, the match is about to start, are both sides ready?” The old man said seriously.

“Ready!”

The moment the members exclaimed, the old man waved his right hand and yelled, “The match... begins!”

Swish swish–

The old man had just called out when Wu Fei and another guy who also held a spear began to attack!

Lin Xiu did not expect that two people would attack him at the same time.

“‘Sunset’!” Wu Fei held the silver spear and stabbed directly towards Lin Xiu!

The second he stabbed the spear over, there was a golden light shining from the body of his spear.

The light was so bright that Lin Xiu squinted.

And another man who was also holding a spear appeared behind Lin Xiu, the spearhead was about to go through Lin Xiu’s back!

“Be careful!” Seeing this scene, Lin Yin, who was originally blocking Class 5’s attacks called out.

“Hahaha, he is Lin Xiu!? He ain’t that great eh!”

Those onlookers burst out in laughter when they saw that Lin Xiu was about to be attacked.

Obviously, Class 5 already had a strategy to get rid of Lin Xiu, the main threat, quickly!

Dang–

At the time, Lin Xiu leaned to the side slightly and dodged Wu Lin’s shot. He had the Dark Edge spear on his right hand and directly blocked the attack without even turning his head.

It was like he had eyes on his back and could easily block the guy’s stab.

Those who were about to mock Lin Xiu had a change of expression.

When Lin Xiu blocked this guy’s attack, he turned his body and pierced his Dark Edge spear towards the guy!

Dang– VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

The man was shocked and did not expect Lin Xiu to respond so quickly. His silver spear quickly blocked Lin Xiu’s attack.

Dang dang dang——

Although he blocked this attack from Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu had two hands on the Dark Edge spear and continued stabbing wildly.

Low strike, inclined strike, stab.

The guy didn’t have a chance to attack at all as he continued blocking Lin Xiu’s spear.

But even so, it still felt as if his hands that were holding the spear were about to break!

“Goodbye!”

At the next moment, as the Lin Xiu raised his Dark Edge spear, he directly sent the guy’s silver spear in the air!

Bang–

While the guy was horrified, Lin Xiu lifted his leg and kicked him in the chest!

‘Serial kick’!

At this moment, having been kicked multiple times in a row, the guy was sent flying off the platform!

Boom–

His whole body smashed on the ground and a dull sound rang out.

All these happened in a blink of an eye.

In a few seconds, a team member of Class 5 was defeated!?

“Well, it seems that Lin Xiu is doing pretty good today.” Nan Zhengjun, who was sitting next to Class 5’s teacher, mumbled to himself.

But he was very happy in his heart. Lin Xiu easily defeated someone from Class 5 – it made him very proud.

Especially in front of Wu Lin, who didn’t get along well with Nan Zhengjun.

“Faster, arrange some people to send him to the treatment room.” Wu Lin’s face has become extremely nasty. He didn’t expect that a student from his class would be sent flying by Lin Xiu when the match has only started.

And it was very obvious that Wu Fei and the guy wanted to get rid of Lin Xiu together but they failed.

“This student is not simple.” At the same time, on the other side, a middle-aged man looked at the Lin Xiu and touched his own beard.

“Teacher, you’re saying that he’s strong?” Zhang Liangqian was sitting next to him and he looked upset.

He also received the news, so he came over here and initially thought that he could see something embarrassing happening to Lin Xiu. In the end, Lin Xiu actually dealt with Class 5;s attacks so easily and even knocked the guy to the ground.

“Yeah.... he probably isn’t just simply a rank 5.”
