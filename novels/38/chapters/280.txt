Chapter 281: River Of Blood

Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Blood, there was a strong smell of blood here!

Lin Xiu frowned when he smelled it. The smell of blood was really strong, making Lin Xiu feel very uncomfortable.

“It smells like blood…”

Qiu Li and the others also smelled it at this time as they frowned and said aloud.

At this moment, everyone became very cautious.

Their expressions changed as they looked around in their surroundings and moved forward slowly.

Not long after, they saw a river in the middle of the road and the river was blood red!

Guo Ling and the others gasped when they saw this scene.

No wonder the smell of blood just now so strong – the river here has turned into a river of blood!

Lin Xiu frowned slightly and walked over.

Rollie’s head came out of Lin Xiu’s backpack at this moment like he sensed something.

Lin Xiu walked to the side of the river of blood, then squatted down and looked at it. The river was blood red and under such close observation, a stronger smell of blood attacked his nostrils.

Blood, it should be real blood flowing into the river.

His eyes followed the source of the river and he looked to the left.

But there were a lot of trees covering it and there was no way to see where the source of the river was.

But what was certain was that something must have happened in front that caused so much blood to flow into this river, turning it to be like a river of blood.

“Did you see anything?” Guo Ling also walked over and squatted next to Lin Xiu, staring at this river of blood.

“I can’t see anything.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

Except that the river was stained red with blood, there was nothing wrong with it.

“It can’t be that there are evolved beasts and warriors fighting over there or warriors getting killed, can it?” Qiu Li looked over at this moment and mumbled to himself.

“Not sure but let’s be more careful.” Guo Ling observed closely for a moment and found nothing, then stood up and said.

Lin Xiu also stood up at the same time and looked around. At the side, there was a huge tree that fell across the middle of the river.

Someone probably did it in order to walk over to the other side.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu said to Guo Ling and the others as he jumped and stood on the tree that seemed to act as a bridge.

He took a few quick steps and jumped again to the opposite shore.

“Let’s go too.”

Guo Ling glanced over and said to Qiu Li and the others behind.

This was just a little incident. After crossing the river, everyone continued to walk ahead.

“Warrior’s corpse?”

Not long after they continued walking, Lin Xiu began to discover that there were many corpses of warriors appearing here.

In the beginning, those corpses were corpses that had been decayed for a long time, but after going deeper, some corpses that seemed like only a few days old began to appear.

There were a lot of corpses and weapons on the ground, there were Odd crystals scattered all over the place too.

“What the hell is going on?” Qian Lin saw this scene and covered her mouth, her eyes widened as she looked at this scene in shock.

The pupils in Guo Ling’s eyes constricted. The scene here was really tragic. The bodies of warriors were everywhere and they seemed to have been cut in half by some kind of sharp blade. All of them were scattered all over the floor.

It was very disgusting.

Qian Lin rarely saw such a bloody scene. At this moment, she felt nauseous and couldn’t help but retch.

It wasn’t just them, Lin Xiu also felt sick when he saw this scene.

What happened here? How could there be such a bloody scene!?

And Lin Xiu had a feeling that there were more dangerous things awaiting them.

“There are many Odd crystals here…”

Qiu Li saw the Odd crystals scattered on the ground at this time and couldn’t help but exclaimed in surprise.

It seemed that there was a scramble or something that caused the Odd crystals to be scattered on the ground, and these Odd crystals appeared to be rank 5 or 6 – there were so many of them!

If they brought them back to sell, they would definitely make a profit.

“Don’t touch it!”

Just when Qiu Li reached out to pick up an Odd crystal, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted and he shouted.

“What’s the matter?”

Being yelled at all of a sudden, Qiu Li was frightened and he turned to Lin Xiu.

The rest of the people also looked at Lin Xiu at this moment and seemed a little surprised that Lin Xiu suddenly yelled.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, then looked at the Odd crystals and said, “Did you not see the things on the Odd crystals?”

‘What’s on the Odd Crystal?’

When they heard Lin Xiu’s words, they were all startled and quickly glanced over the Odd crystals.

At this moment, they looked carefully and saw that there was indeed some transparent liquid on these Odd crystals.

“These things are poisonous.”

Lin Xiu said while holding a leaf and threw it on top of an Odd Crystal.

Ss ss ss——

As the leaf came into contact with the Odd crystal, a burst of white smoke appeared on the leaf and it melted away in an instant.

Qiu Li gasped and had a lingering fear.

This was terrifying. If he really touched the Odd crystal just now, his hand would probably be gone by now.

With that thought, Qiu Li broke out in cold sweat.

“This place is weird…” Wan Qianshui, who had been silent, said in surprise at this moment.

Qian Lin retched for a while and appeared to be back to normal at this time.

After all, she was a warrior and her psychological quality was still much better than that of ordinary people. After adapting to the broken limbs and internal organs scattered on the ground, Qian Lin appeared better.

“Be careful, I think there is a strong evolved beast around here.” Guo Ling, who saw this scene, looked around at this moment and said aloud to Qian Lin and the others.

This was different from the Dark Forest in her memory.

Before, it was very dangerous, but she didn’t expect that when she returned, this place seemed to have become even more dangerous.
