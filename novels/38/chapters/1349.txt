1350 Netherworld Forest

What’s this!?

Looking at the faint purple light in the valley ahead, Lin Xiu’s eyes showed surprise.

It seems that there is a strange energy fluctuation.

As he got closer, this weird energy fluctuation became stronger.

!!

“Ahead, almost there.”

At this moment, the corners of Sun Wei’s mouth curled up.

Netherworld, have they arrived yet?

Lin Xiu also quickened his pace at this time and soon arrived beside Lu Guangyue.

Lu Guangyue looked at Lin Xiu who was chasing up and there was a slight hint of surprise in his eyes.

His speed is extremely fast and he has always kept ahead.

It’s impossible for these people to catch up so easily.

But he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would be able to maintain the same pace as him.

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked at the scene in front of him and his eyes were full of surprise.

On the other side, on the other side, the bright light has become more and more dazzling.

And Lin Xiu could clearly see that there was a huge hole in the ground.

Those dazzling rays of light came out of this cave.

“We’re here.”

At this time, Lu Guangyue had already stopped.

Lin Xiu also stopped moving forward at this time.

Such a powerful energy breath.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s eyes seemed dazzled by those blinding lights.

“Tsk tsk, we’re finally here.”

The warriors behind had already caught up at this time.

Compared to Lin Xiu, these people seemed to have entered this Netherworld, but they didn’t seem as surprised as Lin Xiu.

“Get ready to go in, be careful, maybe there will be undead creatures swarming over there.”

Lu Guangyue exhorted at this time.

He stood in the radiant, bottomless hole and jumped directly into it.

Lin Xiu just hesitated for a moment and jumped down too.

The same goes for the warriors around.

As soon as he jumped in, Lin Xiu felt that the gravity of his body had changed.

Soon, Lin Xiu found that he had traveled through the space, flew out directly and arrived in another world!

Lin Xiu jumped up from the hole in the world here.

“It’s really interesting…”

Lin Xiu looked at the burrow in the world he was in now and couldn’t help saying.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the gravity of this world is different from that of the God warrior Realm.

Gravity is about three times that there.

It’s just that he wasn’t used to it.

And in the sky here, there were actually two moons.

One was white and the other was red!

Under the moonlight, the surrounding environment seemed very strange.

The place where they were at was a wilderness area.

There were many bones on the surrounding ground.

Snapped–

While Lin Xiu was still checking the surrounding environment, he felt his feet were caught by something!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly and when he looked down, he saw a pair of skeleton hands from the dirt, grabbing his right leg.

Soon, a head popped out and was about to bite down on Lin Xiu’s leg.

“Hng!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and the strength of his right leg exploded.

boom–

The skeleton was shattered into several sections and fell to the ground.

But what surprised Lin Xiu was that these bones, which had been shattered into several sections, began to move slowly again.

Then they started to heal.

“These undead skeletons, unless you smash them into slag, they will still recover. It’s disgusting.”

Sun Wei said at this time.

...

And at this time, the soil on the surrounding ground also began to surge.

There are a lot of skeletons and they are about to crawl out.

“Hurry up, don’t get entangled by these things.”

Lu Guangyue looked at this scene and immediately said.

As soon as he finished speaking, he walked to the other side.

The rest of the warriors also followed behind him and walked forward quickly.

This Netherland is a bit weird…

Looking at the surrounding scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frown slightly.

And now Lin Xiu can clearly feel that the energy concentration in the air is very low.

Under such circumstances, the source power was consumed by the battle and it would be very difficult to replenish it.

“By the way, have you heard of Netherworld Fire?”

...

Lin Xiu walked beside Sun Wei at this time and immediately said.

“Netherworld Flame!?”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the pupils in Sun Wei’s eyes shrank slightly.

“This is not a good thing. If you encounter it, leave immediately.”

Sun Wei seemed to have thought of something and his body trembled slightly.

“So scary?”

Lin Xiu deliberately pretended to be indifferent.

“Nonsense, this is a flame that can only be found in the Netherworld. If you accidentally touch it, you may lose your life!”

“I’m not joking with you!”

Sun Wei seemed to have thought of something and his face became ugly.

After following Lu Guangyue for a while, a warrior seemed to see the scene ahead and his expression became ugly: “Isn’t this the Netherworld Forest?!”

The footsteps of the rest of the warriors also stopped at this time.

The Netherworld Forest is a terrifying place in the Netherworld.

The trees here are dense and there are terrifying creatures inside.

The deeper in the forest, the more terrifying the power of those creatures.

“The Netherworld Unicorn is inside.”

Lu Guangyue turned around and looked at the people who had stopped in their tracks and said lightly.

“After Netherworld… there is Netherworld Flame in this forest…”

Sun Wei seemed to recall some bad memories and his expression became ugly at this moment.

The Netherworld Flame is inside!?

At this time, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly.

This is simply like finding something after searching every nook and cranny – it took a lot of effort to finally obtain it.

“Let’s go.”

These people were a little scared, but Lin Xiu became excited.

Lu Guangyue looked at Lin Xiu curiously. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

He don’t know why, but he didn’t see the slightest fear in Lin Xiu’s eyes. Instead, he seemed to have…excitement?

“Scared?”

Lu Guangyue looked at the other warriors.

“If you’re afraid, don’t come here.”

As he spoke, he walked straight into the forest.

Lin Xiu also walked forward.

Because inside, there is the Netherworld Flame that he wanted!

Those warriors just now were only subconsciously afraid, but soon they became bolder again.

This time there are so many God warriors here, even in the depths of the forest, there is no need to be afraid at all!

Moreover, as long as you kill the Netherworld unicorn, you will have the Divine soul water…

With that in mind, these warriors also walked into the Nether Forest.

“What exactly are you here for?”

After walking forward for a certain distance, Lu Guangyue immediately said to Lin Xiu beside him.
