1247 Liu Cheng

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but feel that there was some special ability to these black balls.

He didn’t think much about it and kept the black ball inside his storage space.

Due to how all of the odd crystals have been kept into Lin Xiu’s expansion space, he could clearly see that the entire area has been stuffed with odd crystals.

“Don’t you want any of these?”

Baili Haoling looked at the weapons that were gathered on the ground and she couldn’t help but ask.

None of these weapons were made of ordinary material and they were definitely considered to be something rare.

It wouldn’t be a bad choice for them to distribute them to the people in Lingxian City.

“I would love to take it but I can’t.”

Lin Xiu spoke helplessly.

Although most of these weapons were not as good as the black spear that he had, these weapons were still quite good.

If he was able to bring them back for his guards, it would definitely elevate the strength of his men in Lingxian City.

“You can get Rollie to bring them back.”

Baili Haoling thought about it for a moment before suggesting.

“Rollie?”

Lin Xiu was stunned and he looked shocked.

Then, he turned around and looked at Rollie who was seated on his shoulder.

He couldn’t believe what he was hearing.

“You’ll see.”

Baili Haoling then showed a mysterious smile.

“Rollie! Come here and bring these back.”

With that said, Rollie who was seated on Lin Xiu’s shoulder suddenly leaped into the air.

Its body grew as well while it was in the air. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Then, its mouth was stretched wide open.

Its huge mouth was like a black hole and it started absorbing all of the weapons that were on the ground.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

The weapons on the ground were instantly sucked into Rollie’s mouth.

Then, all of them entered Rollie’s mouth and into the stomach.

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened when he saw this.

Rollie had just sucked all of these weapons into his stomach?!

After sucking them, Rollie gently patted his stomach and his body slowly returned to its former size.

Then, it went back onto Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

Seeing how Rollie was now resting on his shoulder, Lin Xiu was in awe, “He just ate all of those weapons?!”

These weapons were not ordinary ones. All of them would have been deadly heavy.

Wouldn’t it cause Rollie’s stomach to burst now that he has swallowed all of them?

“Don’t worry. Rollie would be able to bring all of them back.”

Baili Haoling spoke with confidence.

Lei Chong, who was standing behind them, had his eyes opened wide as well.

The evolved beast has just swallowed all of the weapons into his stomach.

And it instantly returned to its original form.

This was something that he has never heard of!

“Well, it looks like there’s nothing left here.”

After scavenging for some time, Baili Haoling pouted before commenting about it.

They have already taken everything that they could and the ones that are left were just ordinary things that they could just leave behind.

“City lord, are you planning to combine both cities?”

Lei Chong asked Lin Xiu.

This was because Lin Xiu has killed the city lord of Shachang City while Sha Qiong himself has killed all of his own men. There was no one left to rule this city.

If they didn’t take this chance to combine both city and expand their territory, it would be a waste opportunity.

“No.”

However, Lin Xiu shook his head.

“That won’t be necessary.”

Lin Xiu was only here to seek for Luo Yue.

It was already a huge headache for him that he had to take care of Lingxian City. If he expanded the territory, wouldn’t he be digging his own grave?

For Lin Xiu, who hates dealing with all these troubles, it was unnecessary.

“Why would we want such a useless place?”

...

Baili Haoling stared at Lei Chong with a judgmental look in her eyes.

Lei Chong felt helpless as this city was much bigger than Lingxian City!

If this place was useless then what about their city?

“Let’s go. We already borrowed the odd crystals that we need.”

Lin Xiu then showed a peculiar smile.

Seeing the hideous smile on Lin Xiu’s face, Lei Chong couldn’t help but shudder in fear.

They didn’t borrow it. They just destroyed the other person’s home!

When they came out of the city lord mansion, Lin Xiu sat on top of Little Bai and returned to Lingxian City.

The rest of the warriors left behind in Shachang City thought that Lin Xiu will continue going after them and they were initially feeling frightened.

However, seeing how these people suddenly left, these warriors were confused.

“They must be heading back to bring more warriors here. Sha Qiong is killed and it will be our turn soon.”

...

There were also a few warriors who were close to Sha Qiong that started to panic.

All of them left the city that night.

However, Lin Xiu had no idea about all these.

Lin Xiu didn’t even care about Shachang City.

Soon, the news of Sha Qiong being killed spread like wildfire.

In Changqing City, there was a man with a head full of white hair that held onto a huge sword as he walked into the hall.

There was also a huge white tiger that followed behind him.

The white tiger had a pair of teeth that were incredibly sharp and there was a cold aura around them.

As they stepped into the hall, the ground beneath them turned into ice.

The rest of them inside the hall could feel that the temperature inside has dropped significantly.

“Father.”

The man with a head full of white hair stared at Liu Mo.

The man who entered the hall was his son, Liu Cheng.

“Looks like your abilities have improved once again. Good Job.”

Liu Mu took a good look at Liu Cheng before nodding his head with satisfaction.

“This is…”

Liu Mo looked at the tiger next to Liu Cheng.

The white tiger has a pair of sharp blue eyes.

It caused Liu Mo to feel cold and pressured.

“I have been able to tame this god-level evolved beast.”

Liu Cheng slowly explained himself.

After hearing what Liu Cheng said, the rest of the warriors inside the hall gasped.

A god level evolved beast?!

It may be difficult for them to kill one but it was possible to do so.

However, to be able to tame one would be something impossible.

This was because after a certain level, most of these evolved beasts were incredibly intelligent.

It would be impossible for one to tame them.

This was enough to prove that Liu Cheng was someone incredibly powerful now.

“You would have known that your brother, Liu Qinglan has been killed.”

Liu Mo looked at his son as he spoke.

“Rubbish.”

Liu Cheng scoffed.

“He was killed by a man from Lingxian City.”

Liu Mo frowned. Just before he could say anything, Liu Cheng spoke instead, “Even if he was a piece of trash, he is still my brother. I will avenge for my brother’s death!”
