1240 Injured

The little black dragon was still devouring those dark spears.

The more Lin Xiu looked at it, the more shocked he became.

This divine soul of mine seems to be much stronger than I imagined!

“You guys died a worthy death, I’ll take revenge for you guys.”

!!

At this time, Sha Qiong had absorbed all the life force of the warriors under him and licked his lips as he spoke.

What he said meant that these people were killed by Lin Xiu.

At this time, the rest of the people in Shachang City also saw this scene through various surveillance broadcasts and suddenly felt chills in their hearts.

Sha Qiong, the city lord of Shachang City, although he usually looked very stern, everyone in Shachang City respects him.

After all, he was the one who led the development of Shachang City.

There were still many warriors in the city looking forward to becoming part of the City Lord council, or becoming the guards of Shachang City.

But they never expected that their city lord would actually absorb all the life force of his subordinates for his own use.

The scene of being sucked dry was really too terrifying.

Of course Sha Qiong knew that everyone in the city would see what he did, but he didn’t care anymore.

The subordinates he originally trained were used by him as a cauldron to absorb power to strengthen himself.

His plan is to let the strength of most warriors continue to improve, then slowly absorb the life force of these people one by one. This way, he could still conceal his plan.

But the death of his own three sons has already triggered him.

Today, he must let Lin Xiu die here!

At this time, he looked at Lin Xiu and raised his hands.

Crash, clatter——

A large number of cracks began to appear in the surrounding ground.

The rocks on the ground were all shattered into pieces, then quickly flew into the sky, where they combined into even bigger stones.

These huge rocks are surrounded by black energy bodies.

It looked extremely weird.

“Haoling, I’ll deal with it.”

Baili Haoling, who was in the sky, was staring at Sha Qiong down there. Just as she was about to make a move, she heard Lin Xiu’s words.

Baili Haoling looked towards Lin Xiu and she was able to clearly see the little black dragon, which ate all the dark spears that stabbed Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ just now!

Baili Haoling’s eyes widened and her eyes were full of disbelief.

This kind of dark energy is the most difficult to deal with.

It is several times more difficult to deal with than ordinary fire attribute energy, ice attribute energy, etc.

But Lin Xiu’s divine soul seems to have a special restraint effect on this dark attribute.

This is too strange.

Under the shock of Baili Haoling, the little black dragon had devoured all those dark spears.

Its body size was obviously much larger.

And it seemed very satisfied, flying around Lin Xiu’s side.

Whoosh whoosh——

And at this moment, those huge rocks with dark energy attached to them also charged toward Lin Xiu from all directions!

“Eat them!”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu didn’t panic at all, but spoke to the little black dragon.

Although this little black dragon is his soul, it seems to be able to have independent consciousness.

And at this time, it seemed to understand Lin Xiu’s intention and instantly rushed toward the rocks that were coming.

At the same time it rushed out, its mouth opened wide and it actually devoured all those rocks!

Lin Xiu was even more surprised when he saw this scene.

This soul seems very extraordinary!

What is happening!?

But Sha Qiong, who was on the opposite side, was extremely shocked when he saw this scene.

You must know that these huge rocks all have their own dark power attached to them.

Unexpectedly… they were directly devoured by that weird little black dragon!?

“Damn it!”

Sha Qiong’s face was extremely ugly at this time and with a movement of his right hand, all the weapons on the ground around him flew up in an instant.

The dark power emanating from his body attached to those weapons and controlled them all.

“go!”

And with the movement of his hands, all these weapons charged towards Lin Xiu.

Although the little black dragon can devour those dark forces, its devouring speed was not fast.

At this time, seeing dozens of hundreds of weapons all charged towards him, the expression on Lin Xiu’s face also changed drastically.

...

The Dark Edge spear in his hand directly blocked them.

Dangdangdang——

After those weapons were blocked by Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear and flew out, they flew back again.

Every weapon seemed to have consciousness, attacking Lin Xiu frantically.

At this time, Sha Qiong in the distance was waving his hands in the air, manipulating dozens of hundreds of weapons like a marionette. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Because of the attachment of dark energy and the control of Sha Qiong, these weapons have become extremely terrifying.

Lin Xiu was not careful for a second and a long wound was drawn on his back.

Damn it.

Lin Xiu’s face became ugly.

Now he can feel his own blood dripping from the wound on his back.

The injury is not serious.

...

Moreover, the dark energy on these weapons seems to have also entered his wounds.

It slowed down the healing speed of the wound.

The little black dragon shuttled among the weapons attached to the dark energy, constantly devouring the dark energy.

As the dark energy on the weapons was swallowed, the weapons fell to the ground in an instant.

But its devouring speed was not fast and there were too many weapons with dark energy attached.

Dang–

The Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand swung out again and some weapons were instantly split in half.

But even so, as long as the broken weapons still have dark energy attached, they would still fly up and attack Lin Xiu.

Seeing this scene in the sky, Baili Haoling clenched the long swords in her hands.

Although Lin Xiu told her not to move, but at this time, it is impossible!

Looking at Sha Qiong not far away, he was waving his hands in the air, as if he was manipulating those weapons.

With the triggering of a thought, the Divine Soul Twin Swords that she had just comprehended before appeared above her body.

Without the slightest hesitation, she rushed towards Sha Qiong below!

“Humph.”

Out of the corner of Sha Qiong’s eyes, he spotted Baili Haoling and immediately snorted coldly.

It seems that Baili Haoling does not pose much threat to him.

Such a non-threatening person dared to attack him, simply courting death!

With a thought, more than a dozen weapons directly charged toward Baili Haoling!
