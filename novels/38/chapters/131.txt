Chapter 132: Control Room

But Lin Xiu quickly calmed himself down and added 10 points into Strength.

After adding 7 points into Physique, he hesitated for a moment before adding 2 points into Speed.

After adding the stats, Lin Xiu felt comfort throughout his whole body, as though his body had become even lighter.

He kept the Dark Edge spear back into the spear box, placed both hands on the door, and pushed. The door gradually opened!

“Go!” Lin Xiu roared and everyone charged in!

Rumble-

The large and heavy doors closed on them not long after.

“Whew”

Lin Xiu gasped for breath, it was too exhausting to push open the doors.

He leaned against the door and looked ahead into the darkness. But in the next moment, Zhang Yin and the others reacted and took out torches from their bags.

Their surroundings lit up.

But the place looked extremely dusty. As they scrutinized the place carefully, they saw a few clothed skeletons.

There was an unbearable stench in the air.

“Are they all warriors?” Lei Lei opened his eyes wide in surprise.

“Should be…” Zhang Yin nodded his head.

The place was huge with various control stations.

“Is this a control room?” Lin Xiu looked around and frowned.

His gaze swept across the place, there were many machines that he did not understand and even spiderwebs that laid everywhere.

Sssiii-

RIght at this time, a black figure suddenly pounced towards Lin Xiu and scared him. He retreated and sent a punch flying!

Bang-

The creature instantly exploded from the punch.

Blood and some strange sticky substance landed on the floor. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing rank 2 black spider, obtaining 5000 experience points.”

“What happened?!” The others heard the vacuum explosion and turned to look at Lin Xiu.

“There are black spiders here, be careful.” Lin Xiu spoke up indifferently as he continued to look around.

Such rank 2 evolved beasts posed no threat to him.

“Hmm.” Zhang Yin and the others became anxious and looked around. Black spiders would be poisonous and they did not want to get bitten.

‘Where’s the exit?’

Lin Xiu looked around but did not find anything that resembled a door.

“Did you guys find the exit yet?” Lin Xiu looked at Zhang Yin and the others.

They were in some sort of control room but did not have any exits. This made Lin Xiu suspicious.

‘Is there really no way out?’

Zhang Yin and the others shook their heads. They were surrounded by strange machines and large control stations but not a single exit.

Lin Xiu frowned and searched around by himself. He believed that there should be an exit.

There had to be an exit here!

Lin Xiu looked around and started to touch the control stations.

Papapa-

His fingers ran along the buttons but there were no reactions.

“Qin Li, you studied science and technology before right? Do you know how to operate this?” After searching around for some time, Zhang Yin stood beside a control station and asked Qin Li helplessly.

“These are all old model control stations, I’m not familiar with them at all.” Qin Li shook his head helplessly.

Lin Xiu suddenly recalled that they had relied on crystals to activate the lighting installations. Is this place lacking in some energy source to start up?

With this thought, Lin Xiu started to look around again.

Lin Xiu discovered a gigantic galvanized chest on the wall above.

‘What is that?’

Lin Xiu hesitated for a second before pulling on it. He realized that it did not have a lock and after some crank sounds, the steel chest opened.

“Cough cough.”

Dust scattered out and made Lin Xiu cough.

He took out his phone and tapped on the light button. The phone that was as thin as a card released a blinding light.

‘This is…’

As he used the light to flash on the box, Lin Xiu saw a strange device. What shocked him was that there were many grooves on the device that had plenty of transparent crystal-like objects!

Odd Crystal!!!

This was definitely the energy source for the control room, who would have thought that it required so many Odd Crystals to light up.

Lin Xiu immediately pulled out all the transparent Odd Crystals that had been depleted of their energy and swapped them out for the odd crystals he had retrieved from killing the rank 3 gold rats.

After placing 10 of them, the expected reaction did not happen.

Lin Xiu smacked the device a few times but nothing happened.

According to logic, the base should no longer have energy supply. As long as the case has an energy source, it should react and start to operate.

Could it be that these Odd Crystals were insufficient?

Lin Xiu suddenly felt unwilling as he placed 10 more odd crystals.

Lin Xiu frowned when there was still no response. Could this thing be swapped out?

All of a sudden, cracking sounds were heard as the facility lights started turning on.

“You found the switch?!” Everyone turned their eyes to Lin Xiu and asked.

“En, I found the power source box.” It required 20 energy sources to activate the control room, and still only a part of it was switched on!

It was a waste of crystals.

When he saw the many transparent odd crystals still embedded inside the grooves of the power source box, Lin Xiu smirked.

“I got it! This is a teleportation stage!!!” Qin Li scrutinized the facility when the lights came up and shouted out in joy.
