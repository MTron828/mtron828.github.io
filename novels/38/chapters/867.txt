Chapter 868: People from the Namir Planet

“But, if you have seen the hidden scroll from the Luo family, the things written inside should be true.”

Luo Zhen said to Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

He will definitely find the Orchids of Heaven!

“What were you guys talking about?”

Luo Yue walked into the room and asked out of curiosity.

She was no longer as cold as she used to be previously.

However, this was only when she was with her family and Lin Xiu.

When she was with the others, she was still as cold as a glacier.

“I was just discussing with Lin Xiu when the both of you should get married.”

Luo Zhen said it openly.

After hearing what her father said, Luo Yue’s eyes were stretched wide and a soft blush appeared on her face.

“Lin Xiu, you’re a thick-skinned man. I’m sure you wouldn’t mind talking about this.

Luo Zhen was surprised by how his daughter was looking a little shy.

This was something that was nearly impossible to see on Luo Yue’s face.

As for Lin Xiu, he doesn’t even appear to be bothered by it.

“Of course not!”

Lin Xiu stood up straight and answered loudly.

“Tsktsk….you didn’t even propose. I will never let my sister marry him.”

Luo Yan joined them in the room and teased her younger sister.

“I’m leaving.”

Luo Yue mumbled and quickly walked out of the room.

“Dad, did you see? It’s a rare opportunity to see her with that expression on her face!”

Luo Yan chuckled as she walked towards her father.

“Look! I even got it on camera!”

Luo Yan was laughing as she showed it to Luo Zhen.

Luo Yan obviously took the opportunity to take pictures of her sister.

“This crazy sister....”

Luo Xiu was speechless after seeing how Luo Yan reacted.

The next morning, Lin Xiu, Nan Xiang and Luo Yue arrived at the cave that had the space teleportation device.

“I really would like to see how they are able to teleport between two spaces that are so far away.”

Lin Xiu said to them as they were walking.

“Luo Yue, be careful.”

Lin Xiu was holding onto Luo Yue’s hand and he looked extremely gentle.

“En.”

Luo Yue nodded her head. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Both of them looked gorgeous together.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was so gentle with Luo Yue, Nan Xiang found it difficult to imagine that this man was able to kill all those warriors.

“So…. they will be teleporting to this place soon.”

Nan Xiang walked towards the space teleportation device and told the both of them.

Those from the Namir Planet wanted the Nan family to be their slaves on earth.

They just didn’t expect that before being able to do anything, most of them were already killed by Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Then I...”

“You shouldn’t leave.”

“Just stand there.”

Lin Xiu already knew what he wanted to say and quickly said it before Nan Xiang.

Nan Xiang desperately wanted to leave but he had no other choice but to stand where he was.

Time passed and soon the ground beneath them started shaking.

Are they here?

Lin Xiu kept his eyes on the space teleportation device.

The device started shaking as well as if it had been activated and soon there was a bright light coming from it.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue had to close their eyes.

The ground was shaking harder with the bright light coming from the machine.

Lin Xiu couldn’t see much due to the bright light but with his strong senses, he could clearly feel that there was an overpowering aura of strong warriors coming from the bright light.

Here they are! There’s lots of them!

There were also a few of them who were warrior kings!

“Hmm? Are you on earth now?”

A voice rang through the cave.

The bright light slowly disappeared and it was replaced by 60 warriors who were standing in front of the space teleportation device.

Most of them were at least 2 metres tall and all of them looked buff and muscular.

“Nan Xiang, are you waiting for us?”

The man that stood right in front saw Nan Xiang.

“Sir Jinli, you’re back.”

Nan Xiang noticed who it was. There were few in his eyes as he quickly got onto his knees.

Some of these warriors had been sent here earlier but Sir Jinli had returned in order to bring more warriors back to earth.

“See? This man comes from the strongest family in Huaxia but he is just a slave of mine.”

Jinli said to his men who were standing behind him.

“Hhahahahahah!!!”

Those at the back started laughing as well.

“How is it that this lame country has warriors? It’s just weird.”

Some of them asked out of curiosity.

“Nan Xiang, those two over there, are they yours?”

Jinli pointed his fingers at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue who were standing close by.

“They...”

Nan Xiang was covered in cold sweats as he couldn’t offend any of them.

“What’s why? Why are you afraid?”

Jinli looked at Nan Xiang and frowned.

He took a good look at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue. The boy was handsome and the girl was gorgeous. Both of them made a great pair.

But, he could feel that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue aren’t ordinary warriors.

“Who are you?”

Jinli asked as he frowned harder.

“Here to kill you.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as well as he said flatly.

“Hahahahaha….did you hear him? This earthling is saying that he wanted to kill us!”

Although he had no idea why Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were here, Jinli still found it hilarious after hearing what Lin Xiu said.

It was the best joke that he had ever heard.

“Nan Xiang, did you hire these two lowly earthlings to kill us?”

Jinli stopped laughing and put on a solemn look instead as he asked Nan Xiang.

“No! It wasn’t me!”

Nan Xiang quickly shook his head.

“Hmph!”

One of the warriors who stood behind Jinli sneered. He swung his sword towards Nan Xiang and his body was instantly sliced into two.

“Hey! You killed my slave!”

Jinli looked at the warrior standing behind him.

“There are so many of them on this planet. Just find another one.”

The man shrugged his shoulders.

“You’re right. I think both of them look good.”

Jinli laughed as he said to his men.

“Both of you! I am giving you a chance here. Get on your knees, crawl and lick our shoes. We will let you live and even allow you to work for us!”
