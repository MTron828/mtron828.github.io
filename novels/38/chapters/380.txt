Chapter 381: Terror Lightning

Lin Xiu saw this scene and there was a look of surprise in his eyes.

It didn’t look very big when he looked up from the bottom of the mountain just now and he didn’t expect it to be so spacious.

And when he took a closer look, there were quite a few people sitting in this wide area. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

People who are punished are confined here?

Li li——

Before Lin Xiu had time to think, he heard an ear-piercing scream again.

Hearing this, Lin Xiu raised his head and looked up, and he saw a figure.

Thunderbird!

This Thunderbird’s body was about the width of two people side by side and it didn’t seem to be particularly large.

At this time, it was constantly flying above Lin Xiu’s head, screaming from time to time.

But Lin Xiu found it strange that there was no lightning strike.

“You’re new?”

Just as Lin Xiu looked around, a man sitting cross-legged on the ground looked at Lin Xiu, then smiled and said aloud.

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu nodded.

“I advise you to take a good rest now. There would probably be some fun later.” He looked at Lin Xiu with an interesting smile.

When Lin Xiu wanted to say something, the man closed his eyes again.

Fun?

Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows, looked up at the sky, then shook his head, and found a place to sit on the ground.

There were clouds and mists on the top of this mountain, and it was quite cooling.

As Lin Xiu sat on the ground, he quickly entered the system interface.

Title: Rank 5 warrior (Unused title: Rank 1 warrior, Rank 3 warrior, Rank 4 warrior, Rank 5 warrior)

The stats points seem to have increased a bit, but he was still far from reaching level 28.

He needed to reach about level 30 before he could become a rank 6 warrior. He would probably need more time.

Lin Xiu sighed helplessly and continued to look at the system. Then, he realized that he actually had accumulated five lottery chances.

He opened his eyes and looked at the nearby warriors and thought about it. He’d better not draw the lottery first. If he got something and these people found out, it would be troublesome.

Cultivate first!

Then, Lin Xiu continued to practice ‘cultivation technique’.

Soon, as Lin Xiu began practicing ‘cultivation technique’, a large amount of energy in the air gathered in Lin Xiu’s body.

They were continuously absorbed into his body through his pores.

Time passed quickly, but Lin Xiu seemed to have heard rumbling sounds.

They sounded like thunder.

Lin Xiu opened his eyes and noticed that those warriors who were also sitting on the ground and were closing their eyes just now had also stood up and looked very alert.

Lin Xiu looked at the sky and saw that there were already a lot of thunderbirds appearing above his head. These thunderbirds were constantly flying around, blocking the sun.

Lin Xiu was surprised when he saw this scene.

Why are there so many thunderbirds?

Li li——

And at this time, as these thunderbirds were constantly screaming, there were strange rumbling sounds.

“What’s happening?” Lin Xiu looked at the man from before and then said faintly.

When the man heard Lin Xiu’s words, he smiled and said aloud, ‘These thunderbirds are ‘attracting thunder’. ‘

“Attracting thunder?”

“You’ll find out later.” After the man said this, he didn’t respond anymore and stared into the sky.

The other warriors also showed a cautious expression as if they feared what was going to happen next.

Boom boom——

At the next moment, the thunder in the air became louder and Lin Xiu could already see lightning flashing in the air.

Lin Xiu was slightly taken aback because he sensed that the voltage of the lightning seemed to be very high.

And Lin Xiu also saw those thunderbirds. They were flying continuously in the lightning, with their mouths open as if sucking the lightning.

This strange scene surprised Lin Xiu.

“Coming!”

At the next moment, as a warrior roared, a huge lightning bolt struck directly from the sky!

Boom——

The thick lightning fell directly to Lin Xiu’s side and the entire ground seemed to vibrate crazily.

If it hadn’t been for the special material under the ground, this thick lightning would directly cause a huge hole.

It was not over yet. With the appearance of the first lightning, more and more lightning began to strike!

Lin Xiu’s face suddenly changed when he saw this scene and he dodged frantically.

The other warriors also began to dodge.

Being struck by these thick bolts of lightning was no joke. A warrior got hit and was taken away charred just now – it terrified those warriors.

Those bolts of lightning were constantly being smashed on the ground and the ground was shaking wildly.

“Ah!!!”

As the lightning smashed and struck more and more quickly, a man couldn’t dodge in time, and in the next moment, he was directly struck by it!

As soon as he was struck by the lightning, he let out a loud howl.

There was a large amount of electricity covering his body for an instant.

But in the next moment, he gritted his teeth and dragged his body to the other side to dodge.

Some warriors of rank 6 and above unfolded their ‘Sphere’ when they were about to be struck by lightning.

But even if the ‘Sphere’ was unfolded, the power of these bolts of lightning was still a little too strong. The ‘Sphere’ of these people shook violently after the lightning struck like it was about to split open.

Lin Xiu was very focused at this moment and he dodged swiftly.

But there seemed to be more and more bolts of lightning and after dodging a thick bolt of lightning, Lin Xiu looked up and saw another lightning which was about to strike his head!
