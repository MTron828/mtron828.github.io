Chapter 215: Return Home

Mirror Image: Activates two identical copies with 30% strength of original. (Duration: 30 seconds, cooldown: 12 hours)

‘Copies that have 30% of my original strength?’

‘It doesn’t feel too strong…’

After all, 30% of his original strength would only be able to bully the low rank warriors.

But the noteworthy point was that Lin Xiu could see the words LV1 on the icon.

This meant that the skill could increase in level, just like engulf!

‘Skills that can grow are great!’

Lin Xiu quickly looked at the unique effect of the Rank 5 warrior Title.

Rank 5 Warrior: When attacked, there is a 30% probability of blocking 50% of harm.

Lin Xiu was stunned, ‘This is a good effect…’

After hesitating for a moment, Lin Xiu removed the rank 4 warrior title and swapped it out for the Rank 5 Warrior title.

The swap caused his Physique to drop by 50 points.

It went down to 250 points.

The drop caused his heart to feel pain.

Lin Xiu exited the stats and opened his eyes to see an emotionless face right in front of him.

Lin Xiu was so shocked he took a step back but heaved a sigh of relief when he realized what was going on.

“I thought you fried your brains.” Luo Yue looked at him curiously and said.

“No!” Lin Xiu glared at her.

He looked at her slightly haggard face. ‘Did she stay up to guard me the entire night while I was absorbing the energy?’

Lin Xiu felt a slight heartache upon thinking about this.

‘She’s a lass that acts cold but is actually warm on the inside!’

‘It must be because I was looking at my stats that she thought something was wrong with me.’

“One day, you only used one day to absorb all the energy in the rank 8 odd crystal.” Lin Xiu looked at Lin Xiu with an unconcealable surprise in her eyes.

It was a rank 8 odd crystal and not something an ordinary odd crystal could compare.

How could a rank 4 warrior possibly absorb all the energy in a day?

But Lin Xiu did it.

This surprised Luo Yue even more.

He had grown from his original state that was not qualified to be a warrior to a rank 5 warrior in just a few months! Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

That was a few months of time! How many people would never be able to reach this stage their entire lives!

“It’s called talent.” Lin Xiu replied proudly.

Luo Yue looked at him as though he needed a spanking and could not help but roll her eyes.

Lin Xiu’s heart palpitated when he saw her roll her eyes.

‘This lass is showing more and more emotions, it truly tickles the heart.’

“Do you want to rest for a bit?” Lin Xiu hesitated before asking.

Luo Yue shook her head, “Today’s the last day, let’s head back.”

It was the last day of the freshmen assembly and their bags were all filled with rank 5 odd crystals. Rollie laid on them as though it was asleep.

Lin Xiu was surprised at the number of odd crystals.

They had unknowingly gathered so many of them.

Due to the appearance of the rank 8 Ice crystal white bird, the other students did not gather as many odd crystals over the last few days.

‘We are most probably first in place.’

Lin Xiu clenched his fists tightly in excitement.

As they walked out, the sky had turned bright and the air was much better. The abandoned city looked to be filled with haze.

Roar-

Just as they walked out, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue immediately heard a roar, followed by a rank 5 mutated dog that rushed over.

Lin Xiu raised an eyebrow at the mutated dog. As it was rushing over, he used the spear in his right hand and stabbed it accurately into its head.

The action took only one breath.

Lin Xiu was able to feel that Dark Edge had become much lighter.

This was due to the substantial increase in his strength and he had yet to get used to his new strength.

“Gu?” Right at this time, Rollie jumped out and swayed its body for a bit before jumping onto Lin Xiu’s shoulder. It then slid down and jumped on Dark Edge and onto the rank 5 mutated dog’s body.

It dug out a rank 5 odd crystal.

“You can have that!” Lin Xiu chuckled and said.

As though it understood him, Rollie jumped in excitement and ate the rank 5 odd crystals like a squirrel eating nuts.

Luo Yue watched on curiously, Rollie was a mysterious creature that she had never seen before.

There were very few traces of evolved beasts and zombies ahead as the ground was covered with blood and corpses. The blood stench was extremely unbearable.

According to their speed, they would be able to leave G17 ruin in half an hour and arrive at the airship.

As expected, after around 20 minutes, they saw the large city gates that were dilapidated.

“Hehe, seems like the biggest prey has arrived.”

But right at that moment, a voice came out at the side of the gates.

They saw four guys and one girl that were in uniform black and white battle robes.

They looked to be in high spirits and had obviously rested well.

Lin Xiu squinted his eyes, their insignia showed that they were from north campus class 1.

Just like south campus class 1, they were all top students to be in the north campus class 1.

‘They should be intending to steal the odd crystals in my bag?’

“Zeze, you must be Lin Xiu and Luo Yue from south campus class 10? I heard that you guys have many odd crystals.” The guy walked ahead and spoke to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

The others immediately turned to look at them when he spoke those words.
