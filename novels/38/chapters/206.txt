Chapter 207: Endless battle

Rumble-

A terrifying laser artillery shell struck again.

But the shocking thing was that the Ice crystal white bird seemed to have eyes behind its back. It suddenly turned and swung its large wings.

The terrifying laser artillery was actually reflected!

It flew towards where it came from!

“How is that possible!!!” Everyone who witnessed it had a change in expression as their eyes were filled with disbelief.

They wanted to run, but it was too late!

The terrifying laser shell returned and instantly decimated their bodies along with the buildings in the area!

Terrifying, it was too terrifying!

“Just like that?” Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide, his face was filled with shock.

‘Isn’t the Ice crystal white bird too powerful?’

‘It can actually repel the laser artillery!’

At the same time, warriors started to appear from the other buildings.

“The real show has just started.” Luo Yue noticed them and spoke up indifferently.

Many high rank warriors had walked over.

“Hmph, the union army soldiers want to take the opportunity to kill the Ice crystal white bird, what a joke.” A few warriors saw the laser artillery team’s destruction and sneered.

In this world, many warriors looked down on the union army because the majority of them utilized advanced technology to carry out missions and would frequently steal hunted evolved beasts. To them, the high rank odd crystals had to be returned to the country and this led to bad blood between the warriors and the army.

So they did not come out to help when they saw the union army’s attempt in using the laser artillery.

But all the warriors seemed to have come to a common understanding and started attacking the Ice crystal white bird!

“Begin the assault!!!” A warrior that wielded a double-sided giant ax stood at the top of a building and roared as he looked at the Ice crystal white bird.

Following his voice, many high rank warriors held their weapons matched with their body skills and charged toward the powerful evolved beast!

Rumble rumble-

Many skills were unleashed and it felt as though the entire region had been placed under concentrated fireworks. The area lit up with explosions and smoke.

Even the peak rank 8 Ice crystal white bird was unable to tolerate the high intensity of skills. It spread its wings open and covered its entire body.

All the skills landed on its wings and caused its entire being to tremble furiously.

But in the next moment, the Ice crystal white bird that was under pressure suddenly released a strange shriek. Following that, a powerful frigid aura spewed out of its mouth.

All the warriors that took the opportunity to get closer were instantly frozen to ice!

Bang bang bang-

The Ice crystal white bird shook its wings and swooped down at a terrifying speed. Some of the frozen warriors were unable to escape and were smacked by its claw. Their bodies were instantly broken into pieces!

“Don’t be afraid, continue to attack! As long as we get it down, all the ice crystal feathers on its body are extremely precious!” The high rank warrior with the double-sided giant ax jumped down and slashed with his weapon!

A loud vacuum explosion occurred. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Bang bang bang-

When the double-sided giant ax landed on the Ice crystal white bird’s back, it released a loud bang with a lot of sparks.

The Ice crystal white bird seemed to be in pain from the attack and released a shriek.

The Ice crystal white bird continued to flap its wings that were covered with the ice crystal feathers.

The cold frigid aura swept towards the surrounding warriors. Suddenly terrifying ice needles appeared from within!

Rumble rumble-

The surrounding buildings were struck by the ice needles and started to collapse.

All the 100 and 200-floor buildings collapsed completely and looked like an apocalypse.

The Ice crystal white bird seemed to be infuriated by the attacks. While flying in a berserk, it took the opportunity to sweep down and used its horrifying claws to attack the warriors.

A few rank 6 warriors were unable to dodge in time and got ripped apart.

“So strong!” Lin Xiu clenched his fists and said.

As expected of a peak rank 8 evolved beast, its terrifying combat ability actually killed many high rank warriors!

“It’ll take a while, we can rest first.” Luo Yue looked as though it was nothing strange. She spoke up and sat in a lotus position and started using her cultivation technique to absorb the energy in the air.

The warriors continued to battle with the evolved beasts with all sorts of lights appearing sporadically.

Lin Xiu stood inside the building. It had already been a night but the battle was still ongoing.

There were no signs of it stopping!

‘Are they fighting from night to day!?’

Early next morning, an ear-shattering explosion occurred and caused all the buildings to sway.

The battlefield was even more horrifying. The surrounding tall structures were all destroyed.

The ground had been covered with ice as though it was an ice world.

“Continue the attacks! It won’t last for long!!” The man in command instructed.

Although more than 10 warriors had died, there were no signs of the number of warriors dwindling, there were more than a hundred of them.

All of them were rank 6 and above.

The warriors looked berserk and unleashed all sorts of skills as they attacked without a care for their lives.

The Ice crystal white bird was not disadvantaged and continued to fan its wings to release cold winds that had ice needles in them.

It would occasionally grasp the opportunity to swoop down and attack.

It did not even look like it was tired!
