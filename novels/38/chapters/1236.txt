1237 Entering Shachang City

“Is that a siren?”

Baili Haoling, who was in the air, looked towards the ground and subconsciously asked.

“I think so. Let’s head down there.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and then went straight to the ground.

!!

“City lord!!! Could you please put me down first?!”

Lei Chong, who was still being grabbed by Little Bai, couldn’t help but begged to be placed onto the ground.

He has no chance of moving anywhere as he was in this position. He thought about the warriors that attacked them earlier. If it wasn’t because Baili Haoling had killed them first, he would have been in a dangerous position as well.

“I think it’s best if you stay in the air.”

Lin Xiu glanced at him before telling the truth.

Lei Chong wanted to cry. If there was anyone else who attacked them, he would definitely be dead.

“It’s safer for you to be up here in the air.”

With that said, Lin Xiu quickly joined Baili Haoling as they entered the city.

They were walking towards the main area of the city.

The siren continued ringing loudly around them.

Ring ring ring – –

Then, there were loud footsteps that were heard and a large group of warriors dressed in uniform appeared before them.

These warriors had a unique uniform on and the weapons that they had were nicely polished.

Lin Xiu glanced around with his analytic eye. It was easy for him to identify the levels of these warriors.

Most were sage warriors and there were only a few warrior gods.

The overall standards of the warriors here was incomparable to the small Lingxian City.

Plus, at this time, the warriors separated into two different lines, clearly out a path before them.

A tall, muscular middle-aged man walked toward Lin Xiu.

As they looked closer, this man looked similar to Sha Qiang and Sha Li.

But, this man looked more mature.

With the information from his Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

From the stats itself, it seemed like this man was much stronger than him.

“Lin Xiu from Lingxian City?”

The middle-aged man looked at Lin Xiu before asking.

“You know me?”

Lin Xiu frowned when he heard what the middle-aged man said. He was also a little surprised as well.

“Of course.”

The man spoke in a cold tone.

“You killed all three sons of mine. How could I not know who you are?”

As soon as he was done talking, there was a loud explosion heard.

Boom – –

The entire ground started shaking. Soon, the entire sky above Shachang City was covered by an energy barrier.

It was a powerful one. No one would be able to enter from outside and no one inside would be able to leave the city.

He wanted to kill Lin Xiu once and for all.

“An energy barrier?!”

Lei Chong, who was still being held by Little Bai, saw the energy barrier that appeared above him. His eyes widened in shock!

The energy in this energy barrier was powerful. He estimated that even with Lin Xiu’s strength, they may not be able to break through it!

As he looked at the warriors that were gathered on the ground, he felt his scalp turn numb.

Everything’s over!

He wanted to cry. This was what they meant by ‘borrowing odd crystals’!

“Sha Qiong?”

Lin Xiu was still extremely calm even when he was surrounded by all these warriors.

“The reason why we’re here is because we need to borrow some god-level odd crystals from you.”

Damn …..

Lei Chong, who was in the air, could clearly hear what Lin Xiu was saying. His eyes widened in shock and he almost burst out cursing.

In such a dangerous situation, wouldn’t these make the other party even angrier?

There were too many people at the opposite party.

“Hahahahaha…”

Sha Qiong, who had an expressionless face earlier, started laughing instead after hearing what Lin Xiu said.

After laughing for some time, his smile froze. His eyes were filled with a cold glance.

“You asked for it!!!”

With that said, all of the warriors around them started glowing brightly.

They seem to have released all of the energies in their bodies.

As they moved their weapons in the air, there were endless horrible warrior skills that were aimed at Baili Haoling and Lin Xiu!

Baili Haoling couldn’t help but feel surprised and her pupil shrunk as well.

There were so many sage warriors here. Along with the addition of a few warrior gods, it would be impossible for them to stop these!

Plus, it would be impossible for them to dodge these attacks.

Baili Haoling’s eyes turned red. If they took a closer look, they could see that the wounds that she had earlier have now completely recovered.

It was as if she was never injured!

Her healing powers were incredible.

Just as Baili Haoling was about to release her ‘sphere’ to block these attacks, there was a bright red light that appeared next to her.

What was that?!

Baili Haoling couldn’t help but be shocked to see what it was.

She soon realised that it was a huge ‘sphere’ and it completely covered Lin Xiu and her in it!

Boom boom boom – –

All of the warrior skills that have been released were stopped by the red ‘sphere’.

It was a thick ‘sphere’ and it was filled with a large amount of energy.

“Lin Xiu….is this your sphere?!” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Baili Haoling’s eyes were opened wide. She stared at Lin Xiu who was behind him and her eyes were filled with disbelief.

Using such a ‘sphere’ would definitely use up a lot of energy.

However, Lin Xiu looked as if nothing was happening and it was a walk in the park.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head. Then, with the movement of his right arm, there were various lotus flowers that were released!

The ‘sphere’ was able to block the attacks from outside but it wouldn’t affect the attacks being released from inside the ‘sphere’.

Boom boom – –

As Lin Xiu’s lotus flames attacked the warriors that were outside, all of them exploded and the flames covered the bodies of the warriors beneath it.

They didn’t even have time to release their ‘sphere’ before they were burned into ash.

“Hmph!”

Baili Haoling sneered.She grabbed both her daggers and formed a cross with it in the air!

Then, there was a blood red cross that rushed out of the ‘sphere’!

A few of the warriors from Shacheng City were then chopped into several pieces because of this cross.

With the ‘sphere’ released, none of the warriors from Shachang City could attack Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling. However, both of them from inside could still attack them!

“Move back!!!”

Sha Qiong’s face turned dull.

With his commands, all of the warriors moved back and all of them stopped their attacks.

Sha Qiong looked at the huge ‘sphere’ that Lin Xiu had released. He reached out his right arm and pointed into the air!
