Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The man stared at Lin Xiu with his eyes stretched wide. He was filled with disbelief.

His sword was made of a special ingredient and it should be extremely strong!

He would have never expected for it to be broken so easily.

“You...”

Before he could react, Lin Xiu gave him a good kick.

Boom – –

The man quickly released his ‘sphere’. Lin Xiu’s kick landed on his ‘sphere’ and with the strong impact, he immediately flew a few metres away!

Koong loong – –

His body landed on the wall behind him and the entire wall collapsed.

“Ahhhhhh!!!!”

The man quickly stood up and stared at Lin Xiu, screaming in rage.

All the energy in his body exploded instantly.

He was incredibly frustrated.

......

He was a respected warrior but he was trashed by this young man!

It happened when he had released his ‘sphere’!

As he screamed, there was a sourcemark that appeared on his forehead.

Boom – –

The entire ground started shaking vigorously.

There were red flames that were released from the man’s body and were all headed towards Lin Xiu’s body!

The flames were horrible and the air around them was distorted because of the scorching heat from the flame.

“Brother Lin, be careful!”

Wu Jie tried to warn Lin Xiu.

However, Lin Xiu still remained on the same spot and it looked like he wasn’t going to do anything.

“You want to play with fire?”

Lin Xiu had a cold laugh.

If it was some unique energy from his sourcemark, it would be a little difficult but if it was flames, was there anyone who would have stronger flames than him?!

Lin Xiu sneered. He waved his hands and there was a dark blue flame that came out of his spear!

The red flames that the man immediately disappeared when it collided with Lin Xiu’s flames!

The dark flame immediately appeared right in front of Lin Xiu’s face!

How would this be possible?!

The man’s eyes were opened so widely that his eyeball was about to fall out of his socket.

The horrible flame completely covered the man’s ‘sphere’.

There was a hot scorching feeling which caused him to scream.

He was a warrior, an expert in using flames but he has never seen such a horrible one.

The thing that appeared to be scarier was that the flames were melting away his ‘sphere’!

It caused his ‘sphere’ to slowly become thinner and thinner.

“Who on earth are you?!!”

The young man roared and he could see a sharp, bright light appear before his eyes.

Boom – –

With a bright sound, his ‘sphere’ became so thin because of the flame that there was a hole formed in it.

As for his head, it was pierced through by the long spear.

“That’s...impossible...” DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

There was fresh, red blood flowing out of his head.

His mouth and eyes were opened wide.

Even till his last breath, he still couldn’t believe that Lin Xiu was someone so powerful.

He was a respected warrior after all!

Boom – –

As Lin Xiu pulled away the long spear, his body fell to the ground.

The rest of the warriors from the Xu family were shocked to see what had happened.

He was a respected warrior! How could he be so easily defeated?!

They were looking at Lin Xiu in fear.

“Kill them!”

Wu Jie grabbed his weapon as well and headed towards the other warriors.

This was because the strength that Lin Xiu showed was terrifying.

Although Lin Xiu hasn’t done anything, the way that he was standing there had already greatly defeated those from the Xu family.

Soon, Wu Jie and the rest of the Wu family defeated all of the warriors from the Xu family!

“Are you alright?”

Su Jian might have been injured earlier but he was much better now. He quickly stood up and shook his head.

“I’m fine.”

Wu Jie shook his head as well.

This time, they have not lost any members of their family but the warriors from the Xu family were annihilated.

“Oh, Uncle Su, Xue Ey, this is Lin Xiu and he is the one who helped us.”

Wu Jie introduced Lin Xiu to those from the Su family.

As he spoke, Su Jian and his daughter turned towards Lin Xiu.

They have seen with their own eyes how Lin Xiu had killed the man.

He was incredibly powerful.

“Thank you, saviour.”

They bowed towards Lin Xiu at the same time.

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“By the way, did Xu Ba do anything to you?”

Su Jian suddenly thought of something and immediately asked Wu Jie.

“Xu Ba wanted to kill all of us but thank God for Brother Lin who got rid of all of them instead.”

Wu Jie explained it to Su Jian.

He killed all of them?

Su Jian gasped when he heard what Wu Jian said.

How was this man so scary?

“The Xu family will hear about this soon and they are in a very good relationship with those from the City Lord Council. We would definitely be in great trouble.”

Su Jian said anxiously.

Wu Jie frowned as he thought of what might happen next.

Their status now was indeed extremely dangerous.

The City Lord Council has 2 respected warriors and there was another respected warrior from the Xu family.

If they worked together, the Wu and Su family would be done for!

“Wu Jie.”

Then, Lin Xiu suddenly spoke up.

“Brother Lin.”

When Wu Jie heard Lin Xiu’s voice, he turned towards Lin Xiu.

“Would you like to be the city lord of the Sand River City?”

Lin Xiu asked bluntly.

“The city lord of the Sand River City?”

Wu Jie was stunned and he looked dumbfounded.

“Are you saying...”

Lin Xiu waved his right hand and a bright token appeared in his hand.

Wu Jie looked extremely surprised when he saw what it was.

“The Imperial Order?!”

When he entered the Wu family, Lin Xiu had been reading through the information that Ye Kai gave him and knew that the Wu family once belonged to the Ye family as well.

Although the Wu family’s warriors weren’t the strongest, they were one of the richest.

“Greetings, Young Master!”

Wu Jie got on his knees.

He has been taught since young that once anyone had the imperial order, the orders will have to obey their commands indefinitely.

“I command you to be the city lord of the Sand River City.”

Lin Xiu gave his command.

“Yes!”

Wu Jie answered loudly.

“Who do you think you are?!”

A loud voice came from afar and it was followed by rolling thunder!

All of them looked towards the sky and saw a man, accompanied by two elders, floating in the air.

These were the remaining respected warriors of the Sand River City and they were also the strongest respected warriors in the city!
