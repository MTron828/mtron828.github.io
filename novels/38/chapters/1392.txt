Chapter 1393  A new Dark Edge...?

Following his roar, the next moment, the man held the black scythe in his hand and attacked Lin Xiu at a very fast speed!

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu snorted coldly and the golden spear in his hand also danced quickly.

Dangdangdang——

The weapons of the two collided with each other at this moment and there were extremely loud noises.

The Netherworld flame on the golden spear in Lin Xiu's hand disappeared.

It's not that Lin Xiu didn't want to keep the weapon covered in flames, the problem was that it consumes too much energy.

In the current state, it is not suitable for use.

"Dead! Die! Die!"

This man has a ferocious face and he was waving a huge black scythe crazily.

But his weapon collided with Lin Xiu's weapon and there was no way to destroy Lin Xiu's weapon.

On the contrary, because of the collision of the weapons, his hand felt a little numb.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly at this moment.

This man's strength is not considered weak. If he continues to fight like this, there is no way to kill him. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At this moment, Lin Xiu didn't want to drag on any longer.

While fighting with him, he triggered his mind and Lin Xiu directly used the system skill - [Heavenly array]!

As soon as the system skill was used, the man clearly saw the light bursting out from Lin Xiu's body.

This light instantly covered the entire ground, like the pattern of some formation.

Domain!?

The expression in his eyes changed slightly.

Bang bang bang——

At this moment, Lin Xiu was already holding the black spear in his hand and frantically attacked him.

At the same time as the spear pierced, there were loud cracking sounds.

Originally, this warrior who was able to use the black scythe was evenly matched with Lin Xiu, but in the next moment, his expression became extremely ugly.

Because he clearly felt the sharp pain from his hands holding the weapon.

This kid is too strong!

With a thought, in the next moment, red power burst out from his body.

"You can't use it."

Lin Xiu said softly while attacking him.

The moment he finished speaking, another white light suddenly burst out.

Instantly covered him with those red energies.

Disappeared!

His domain force disappeared in an instant!

Hell!

Boom--

At this time, when the weapon collided again, he felt the strong impact and his body retreated directly.

The whole body was pushed to the back.

Poof——

A mouthful of blood was spat out from his mouth.

"Ah!!!"

He felt the warm blood he spat out and he seemed to be mad at this moment. The huge scythe in his hand danced wildly in the air.

Boom, boom, boom——

As the huge scythe in his hand danced, all the flames on the ground around him began to dance along with the huge scythe in his hand!

Lin Xiu frowned when he saw this scene.

Soon, those flames instantly formed huge flame vortexes and rushed toward Lin Xiu!

In this space, there is no way to dodge these huge flame vortexes.

'Sphere'!

Without the slightest hesitation, Lin Xiu directly unfolded his 'Sphere'.

But because the source strength is being suppressed, the 'Sphere' that the source strength is used to expand is not thick enough.

At the same time, those huge skull-like flames hit Lin Xiu's 'Sphere'.

Boom, boom, boom——

As soon as they hit Lin Xiu's 'Sphere', there were extremely loud noises.

Lin Xiu, who unfolded the 'Sphere' to resist, obviously felt the strong impact.

The body was also a little uncomfortable from the impact.

"Damn..."

The man looked at Lin Xiu unfolding the 'Sphere'. He didn't look injured at all and his face became extremely ugly.

"Is it gone?"

At this time, after resisting his attack with 'Sphere', Lin Xiu said lightly.

"Die!"

Hearing Lin Xiu's words, his face became extremely ugly. He roared angrily and waved the huge scythe in his hand at this time.

Following the dancing of the scythe, terrifying flames rushed toward Lin Xiu again.

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and directly leaned on the unfolded 'Sphere' to forcibly resist these explosive flames.

Instantly rushed to the man's side.

When the man saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

Lin Xiu didn't pay much attention. At this time, the golden spear in his hand had already stabbed out!

Whoosh—

With a whooshing sound piercing through the air, the sharp tip of the spear was about to stab him in the head.

Boom--

But the next moment, the man reacted quickly and blocked it with the huge scythe in his hand.

The tip of the spear pierced his scythe and the powerful impact caused his body to take several steps back.

But before he calmed down, Lin Xiu continued to attack the past with the golden spear in his hand.

'Profound Intent·Torrential storm of rose flowers'!

The golden spear in his hand stabbed out hundreds of spears again.

Dangdangdang——

He crazily used the huge scythe in his hand to resist, but at the next moment, the hands holding the scythe finally couldn't bear the severe pain caused by the powerful impact and the scythe came out of his hand directly.

Die!

Lin Xiu seized the opportunity and the spear pierced through his head like a rainbow piercing the sun.

His eyes were wide open and his eyes seemed to be full of disbelief.

"How can it be..."

As soon as he finished speaking, he lost his eyesight and his whole body limp as he fell to the ground.

At this time, Lin Xiu also pulled out the long spear that pierced his head and some red and white things flowed out immediately.

In Lin Xiu's head, there was a reminder that he gained experience.

"Damn!"

At this moment, Lin Xiu's eyes widened.

Because if you look closely, you can find that the progress bar of experience has actually risen to 90%!

Killing this guy allowed him to gain so much experience?

It seems that because the man was already dead, his body also began to be slowly burned by the surrounding flames.

The huge black scythe has not changed in the slightest.

It looks like it's also a good weapon.

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment, then directly put the weapon into his expansion space.

Looking forward, he suddenly saw the dark red stone in front.

Is this the Spirit Fire Energy Stone?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu's heart beat faster.

Subconsciously, he took out the Book of Reform, then walked over there.

"The new Dark Edge should be successfully manufactured..."
