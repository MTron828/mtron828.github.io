Chapter 192: The Scattered Group

“Dam…damn…” Zhang Yin quickly flung those slick tentacles wrapped around his body with a strong shake.

Although these tentacles were thrown on the ground, they still seemed to tremble slightly – they were very disgusting.

“What the hell is this?” Li Ping and Jiang Li also came to their senses and their eyes widened as they looked at the tentacles on the ground that had just been chopped off by Lin Xiu.

These things looked a bit disgusting, after all.

“Tentacle zombies.” Lin Xiu said faintly.

Although he couldn’t see where these darn things were, he found out through his Analytic Eye that there were such horribly mutated Tentacle zombies in the thick fog.

Also, they were rank 4 Tentacle zombies!

“It’s coming.” After Luo Yue heard Lin Xiu’s words, her eyes focused on her surroundings.

She seemed to feel something at this moment and her gaze changed, as the long sword she was holding slashed straight ahead!

Bang bang bang——

With a dull sound, some slender tentacles were directly cut to the ground.

Listening carefully at this time, they could feel the rustling sounds around them becoming more and more frequent as if the blood plasma from the tentacles that were cut off attracted some things around.

“This… what the hell is this… thing!?” Zhang Yin had just recovered from the shock and when he took a closer look, he found that slowly, from the surrounding dense fog, a number of figures were approaching.

They quickly surrounded them all!

Soon, Zhang Yin also saw the Tentacle zombie closest to them. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The hands and feet of these zombies were full, but the entire head seemed to be split open and was densely packed with teeth. There were many tentacles on them and they were black-red in color. Also, they had barbs on them as they moved constantly in the air – just looking at them made one’s hairs stand on its ends.

“My god…” Li Ping was already dumbfounded and it was the first time she saw such a disgusting zombie.

Bang bang bang——

Before they had time to react, the Tentacle zombies surrounded them in all directions. At this time, the tentacles in their mouths stretched out towards Lin Xiu and the others and flew over!

There were disgusting tentacles coming from all directions!

‘Awe of the Phoenix”!!!

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate, he waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand and a large number of flaming birds flew towards the front.

As soon as those tentacles touched the flaming bird, they were directly burned.

Luo Yue also rushed forward, constantly waving the long sword in her hand, cutting off those tentacles.

With all the tentacles being chopped off, the heads of those Tentacle zombies that were originally split into two began snapping and were about to bite Luo Yue!

Boom——

Luo Yue frowned and swung the long sword in her hand, cutting one of them into two.

Lin Xiu also rushed over there, waving the spear in his hand continuously.

As he brandished the spear, fiery red flames appeared on the spearhead, instantly slashing the heads above the tentacles.

“Don’t just stand there, kill it!!!” Li Ping came to his senses and howled suddenly, then holding the weapon in his hand, he ran over to these Tentacle zombies.

These darn things obviously had to rely on the thick fog to hide. If it weren’t for the many laser training in the gravity room previously, Lin Xiu might have gotten entangled by the large number of tentacles that were attacking from all sides.

At this time, Lin Xiu was dodging frantically, but he also kept attacking these Tentacle zombies at the same time.

100,000 experience was gained for every kill but this 100,000 experience was still too little for Lin Xiu. He didn’t look at the system prompts at all and continued to wave the spear in his hand.

Bang bang bang——

As Lin Xiu attacked, the tentacles of the Tentacle zombies fell all over the ground and the corpses of the Tentacle zombies whose heads were cut off were also all over the ground.

‘Damn, why is it endless!?’

Lin Xiu’s hand was getting a bit numb and when he saw that these darn things did not seem to decrease in numbers, he clenched his teeth.

There was no other way, in this current situation, even if they don’t kill them, they will keep attacking.

The only way now is to kill them all!

Time passed quickly and when Lin Xiu killed the last Tentacle zombie, he finally let out a sigh of relief.

“How are things over there?” When Lin Xiu turned and looked back, he found that there was a thick fog behind him. It was impossible to see Luo Yue, Zhang Yin, and the others.

And what was even stranger was that the surrounding area was quiet.

There were no sounds of fighting at all.

“Luo Yue!?” Lin Xiu tried shouting, but he didn’t hear any response.

Lin Xiu frowned and quickly walked back with his spear, but when he got there, he found that the tentacles on the ground simply disappeared, and the surroundings seemed a bit strange.

‘What is going on? Where are they!?’

“Zhang Yin, Li Ping, Jiang Li!?” Lin Xiu continued to call out their names but there was still no response.

There was something wrong with this dense fog.

It must be this thing that was interfering.

If his guess was right, he and the others were all separated.

In this situation, the danger was greatly increased.

What was he going to do?

Lin Xiu took out his phone and he had Luo Yue’s number in it.

He made a quick call and got through.

“Luo Yue, where are you now?” Lin Xiu said quickly at this time.

“North City Street 1.” Luo Yue held a mobile phone in her left hand and leaped up. After cutting off the head of a zombie, she raised her eyes to look at the door number of a building on the left and said aloud.

She found it very strange just now as well. She was clearly with Lin Xiu, but soon after she killed the Tentacle zombies, she slowly realized that Lin Xiu and the others had completely disappeared.

At this time, as she was holding the phone in her left hand, she saw the zombie next to her running over. With the long sword in her right hand, she simply beheaded it.

Blood and broken limbs were all over the ground.

“Send me a coordinate.” Lin Xiu said aloud.

He didn’t have the phone numbers of Zhang Yin and the others, so he couldn’t contact them now.

As Luo Yue sent over her current coordinates, Lin Xiu was startled – it was very far from where he was at now!

‘What exactly is going on?’

Lin Xiu was confused at this time.

At this moment, a black figure slowly approached Lin Xiu in the thick fog.
