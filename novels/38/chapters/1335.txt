1336 The Central Pavillion

“The Central Pavillion?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows.

Lin Xiu didn’t even get to check out the Forbidden Land of the Go King.

“En. When you’re here, without the permission from the God King, no one would be allowed to move around as they pleased.”

Baili Haoling nodded her head.

For a woman who wasn’t afraid of anything, she seemed much more obedient.

“Lin…Lin Xiu!”

Rollie hopped onto Lin Xiu’s shoulder as well and started speaking in a soft, mushy tone.

“This is the first time I heard an evolved beast speaking…”

Lei Chong stared at Rollie with his eyes wide open.

Xiao Bai wanted to speak as well but it seemed like it couldn’t and could only continue making chirping noises.

“Let’s go. Let’s head over and take a look there.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were fixed at the door as he spoke.

Once he walked out of the room, Lin Xiu finally got to see the whole image of the palace that he was at.

It was exactly like one of those from ancient times. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

A large surface of the building was glowing with a warm, white light due to how they were made of jade.

There were also complicated markings seen all over the jades.

“Such powerful energy…”

Not only was the air rich with energy, even the building itself was giving out vast amounts of energy.

If they were able to cultivate here, it would definitely help them indefinitely!

“Mr Lin, are you awake?”

Then, there was a guard dressed in a white uniform that greeted Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

He activated his Analytic Eye and noticed that this man was much stronger than him!

This was indeed something that shocked him!

“This way please.”

The man spoke respectfully toward Lin Xiu.

The man then guided Lin Xiu and the rest to the Central Pavillion.

Lin Xiu also managed to take another good look at the palace.

This was a floating palace!

When Lin Xiu looked down from the edge of it, everything was white.

He had no idea what altitude they were at now.

“Please stay here. Only Mr Lin is allowed to enter.”

Soon, they stood right in front of the Central Pavilion.

The Central Pavillion was a huge building and they were now standing at the bottom of the pavilion.

One would have to climb up a long stair before arriving at the pavilion.

“My pets can’t come along as well?”

Lin Xiu looked at Rollie and Little Bai.

“Mr Lin, please go alone.”

The man nodded his head again before smiling at Lin Xiu.

“Alright.”

Lin Xiu passed over Rollie and Little Bai to Baili Haoling before walking up the stairs.

The moment he laid his foot on the steps, Lin Xiu felt that something was wrong.

There was a huge pressure that hit him.

Lin Xiu’s pupils narrowed subconsciously. If it wasn’t because he was prepared, he would have been thrown into the distance by now!

“What’s wrong?”

Baili Haoling noticed something odd about Lin Xiu and quickly asked.

“Nothing.”

Lin Xiu smiled as he answered Baili Haoling.

He controlled his breathing and continued walking up the stairs.

However, with each step he took, the strength of the energy would be stronger which continued pushing him backwards.

Lin Xiu was now prepared for it and was no longer afraid.

He kept himself calm and slowly went up the stair one step at a time.

...

The guard who was watching Lin Xiu looked surprised as well.

This was no ordinary stairs. They called this the ‘Stairs of Trials’. Only those with strong energy would be able to walk up the stairs and only those who can make it to the top will be allowed to enter the pavilion.

For guards like them, they have been trained.

However, to be able to move up so easily like Lin Xiu, it would be impossible even for them.

Lin Xiu managed to move swiftly and in a short period of time, he was already at the last three steps.

He was about to reach the top but Lin Xiu now had a horrible look on his face.

This was because the energy on the last three steps were incredibly powerful.

It caused Lin Xiu to feel as if his body could mess up anything.

Huuuu~~

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and released all of the energy in his body.

Then, he took another step!

...

Boom – –

As soon as his foot landed on the step, there was another wave of energy that rushed toward Lin Xiu, causing him to almost get thrown away from the stairs.

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered. He has once experienced climbing such stairs in the past.

Although this one was much more difficult, Lin Xiu wasn’t afraid of it.

As long as he was determined enough, he would be able to get to the top!

Lin Xiu roared and the veins all over his body were popping.

He continuously finished the last three Steps!

“You’re good…”

The guard couldn’t help but mutter to himself when he saw this.

Lin Xiu had only used one minute to complete walking up the stairs.

It was extremely fast!

“Is this the Central Pavilion…?”

Lin Xiu finally saw two huge doors standing before him once he got to the top.

There were also two stone statues on both sides of the door.

Both look incredibly real.

There were also two more guards that stood by the doors. They were motionless and even looked like statues.

But, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the overpowering aura that came from both of them.

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu walked into the Central Pavillion.

“You’re here?”

Lin Xiu then saw Riyan God Lord as soon as he entered.

The man was standing in the middle and when he saw Lin Xiu, he chuckled as he gently stroked his beard.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

This man with a head full of white hair and long beard was naturally Riyan God Lord from before.

Lin Xiu still remembered who he was.

He knew that this man was powerful.

“The top three for this year’s competition would be you, Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng.”

“But, both of them would not be here so soon.”

Riyan God King chuckled.

Both of them were allowed to come here as well.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes. It was incredibly difficult for him to be able to defeat them during the fight.

He almost killed both of them and could have achieved a large amount of EXP.

As he thought about this, Lin Xiu still felt that he wasted his chance.

“I will be giving you your reward for getting first place.”

Riyan God Lord spoke as he waved his left arm.

Then, there were two wooden boxes on the table that flew towards Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up with excitement when he saw the wooden boxes.

He quickly caught them with both hands.

Both boxes were about the size of his palm and Lin Xiu could feel that one of it was incredibly heavy!
