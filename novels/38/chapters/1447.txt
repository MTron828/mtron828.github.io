1448 Punish the God King, Prepare to Take the Flame of Chaos

Boom–

In the next moment, Zhang Tiansheng’s body was bitten and he flew to the back.

And the golden light on Lin Xiu’s body disappeared instantly at this moment.

Almost all of the previous system skills were cooling down.

But only the Golden Body Immortality was ready for use.

This can be considered good luck.

Otherwise, he might not be able to take the blow just now.

At this moment, his eyes turned to the other side.

He saw Zhang Tiansheng, who was bitten by the black dragon formed by the black river water, frantically trying to struggle his way out.

“Get lost!!!”

Zhang Tiansheng roared angrily.

The strength of his body continued to erupt, but he couldn’t shake off the black dragon that was biting him. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

And at this moment, the black dragon’s body began to circle his body.

Then it quickly turned into black water, covering his entire body.

Zhang Tiansheng’s eyes widened in the black water as he struggled.

But no matter how much he struggled, there was still no way to break free at this time.

At this time, the black water began to seep into his body continuously.

This Zhang Tiansheng possessed a certain amount of dark energy, so he was still able to move around there easily, otherwise it would be impossible.

However, the dark energy within the black water was simply too concentrated.

As the black water infiltrated his body, so did the dark energy.

But the dark energy in this black water is really too rich.

As the black water penetrated into his body.

At this moment, it can be clearly felt that the strength of the whole body seems to be eroded by these dark energies.

“ah…”

At this time, he let out a low growl.

Clutching at his body.

The black water had all infiltrated into his body at this time.

Taking a closer look, Zhang Tiansheng’s body turned black!

He crazily grabbed his body with both hands and his body was covered in blood.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but feel a chill.

Is the water in the Black River so terrifying?

Even a god king became like this!?

At this time, Lin Xiu’s eyes were also full of surprise.

However, Lin Xiu didn’t think too much about it at this time, holding the Dark Edge spear tightly in his hand.

As the strength of the body continued to be transmitted to the body of the spear, the entire body of the spear suddenly seemed to tremble.

“What god king, what a fool.”

The phantom of Zhulong also appeared beside Lin Xiu. Looking at the God King over there, he said viciously.

Now the God King is affected by the water of the Black River and now, there is no way to resist Lin Xiu’s attack.

He is dying!

“You said that as long as I can win, you will lend me your strength, right?”

Lin Xiu also said aloud at this time.

“Hng!”

Zhulong snorted coldly.

At this moment, the phantom of his body disappeared instantly.

Lin Xiu ignored him. The most important thing now is to kill this god king quickly!

At this time, Lin Xiu’s figure flashed and he appeared in front of Zhang Tiansheng in an instant.

The Dark Edge spear in his hand was about to stab his head!

Die with me!!!

Lin Xiu roared in his heart and his whole body burst out with extremely strong power at this moment.

Zhang Tiansheng, who was frantically grabbing his body, suddenly grabbed Lin Xiu’s spear body with both hands.

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly and found that no matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t continue to stab them in!

“I want you all to die!!!”

Zhang Tiansheng roared angrily. At this moment, his whole body began to swell at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Self-destruct?!

This guy is going to blow himself up!

The self-destruction power of a god king is very powerful and terrifying.

Boom——

At this moment, the spear vibrated crazily.

The flames on the entire body of the spear became even more terrifying.

The body of the spear was completely red, like hot iron.

Zizizi——

Following the strange sounds, Zhang Tiansheng’s hands that grabbed Lin Xiu’s spear were instantly melted away.

die!

At this time, Lin Xiu also directly seized the opportunity and used all the strength in his body.

boom–

The spear continued to stab out, piercing through his head in an instant!

Zhang Tiansheng opened his eyes wide.

However, it penetrated his head and Lin Xiu clearly felt that his body was still moving.

He’s not dead!

‘Soul Eater’!!!

At this moment, Lin Xiu used this skill that he had never used before!

As soon as the skill was used, this divine soul power was obviously devoured by Lin Xiu at an extremely fast speed. ”

“No!!!”

He let out a wailing cry.

In the next moment, there was no sound at all.

His swollen body slowly returned to its original shape.

This time, he was really dead.

As the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was pulled out, his body fell directly to the bottom.

boom–

Falling from a high place, it immediately hit the ground, making a loud noise.

“Ding! Congratulations, master, for killing a god king-level warrior and gaining experience 164663154…”

At this time, the prompt of experience gained sounded again.

Lin Xiu was a little dazzled by the series of experience prompts.

“Your are quite strong.”

At that moment just now, it was obvious that the power of the spirit Zhu Long made his Dark Edge spear even stronger.

Only then did he let himself be killed with one blow.

“Hng!”

Zhu Long’s cold snort came from the Dark Edge spear.

His phantom didn’t appear again at this time.

Poof——

Luo Yue, who was below, spat out a mouthful of blood at this moment.

Just manipulating the black water to form the black dragon still consumes too much body strength.

Now all the strength in her body has been exhausted.

“Luo Yue!”

Lin Xiu seemed to have seen this scene. In a flash, he appeared next to Luo Yue and supported Luo Yue.

“I’m fine.”

Luo Yue shook her head.

“This god king has finally been killed.”

Looking at Tiansheng corpse not far away, Luo Huatian couldn’t help but heaved a sigh of relief.

“However, the news of Zhang Tiansheng’s death should be known by the people in Tiansheng Pavilion soon. At that time, it will be troublesome.”

Thinking of this, Luo Huatian frowned.

“I’m going to take a trip to the Chaos Realm.”

“Dark Planet, is there a place where I can teleport there?”

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Huatian.

“Chaos Realm!?”

“That place is very dangerous.”

Hearing these three words, Luo Huatian’s body trembled slightly.

That was the legendary forbidden place, very dangerous.

“I have to go.”

Lin Xiu was now absolutely determined to get the Flame of Chaos.

Ling Tianxi possessed the power of that weak water which caused his Netherworld Flame to be quite ineffective.

He must get the Flame of chaos, that is, the Great Sun Golden Flame!
