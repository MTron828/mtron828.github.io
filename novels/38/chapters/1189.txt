1190 Closing the Arena

This was the rule that they came up with.

The survivor of the match would be able to get the reward.

“Alright. Let’s head to the next one and see what they have to offer.” Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Lin Xiu turned to Baili Haoling and they were ready to continue.

Mr Lui, on the other hand, was looking extremely pissed.

Lin Xiu had killed many warriors today after multiple fights.

Plus, he was incredibly cruel. All of the warriors would end up as meat patties.

Lin Xiu did not give them any chance.

This was why all of the warriors were scared of Lin Xiu.

Was there anyone here who had the guts to fight him?

Seeing how Lin Xiu was getting more rewards, Mr Lui couldn’t stand it anymore.

“The arena would be closed today. Please leave now.”

Then, with his dull expression, he announced it to the warriors standing around him.

Following that, the staff of the underground battlefield started asking people to leave the place.

Most of them left quickly as well.

This is because they knew what was going to happen next.

“They’re coming for us now.”

Baili Haoling placed both her hands on the sheath that was tied to her waist.

“En.”

Lin Xiu had a mysterious smile on his face.

This was what he had been waiting for.

After taking so many treasures from them, they would never allow him to leave so easily.

Boom boom boom – –

Suddenly, there was a loud sound that echoed in the arena. Then, all of the exits were shut.

With Mr Lui leading them, there was a large number of warriors that surrounded Lin Xiu.

“Young boy, don’t you think you’ve gone overboard?”

Mr Lui’s face looked evil as he stared at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu also had a large amount of treasure in his hands.

These included odd crystals, rare ingredients as well as expensive weapons.

These items were originally used to attract the warriors to participate in the fights.

However, with Lin Xiu being here, none of the warriors dared to join the fight.

Therefore, Lin Xiu got his hands on all the rewards.

“Isn’t this your rule? If no one challenges me, I will get to keep these.”

Lin Xiu asked in a calm tone.

“Hahahahahahah!!!”

Mr Lui laughed instead when he heard what Lin Xiu said.

He was laughing out of anger.

“Kill him.”

Then, he suddenly stopped and there was a strong murderous intention that appeared in his face.

If his boss found out that there was someone who walked away with so many rewards, he would be dead!

“Yes, Sir!”

With Mr Lui’s commands, all of the warriors in the same uniform, started attacking Lin Xiu!

Little Bai was the first one who attacked as it let out a bright, loud cry.

Then, it was followed by a large frosty breath.

These breaths were aimed at the warriors.

Even with their ‘spheres’ released, all of them were immediately stopped by the breath of frost.

Xiu – –

Then, Baili Haoling pulled out her sword.

“Let me handle this.”

Just when Baili Haoling was ready to fight, Lin Xiu patted her shoulders.

“But…”

Baili Haoling was stunned. After fighting so long, Lin Xiu should have been exhausted by now.

“It’s alright.”

It was as if Lin Xiu knew what she was thinking. Then, before the warriors got any closed, there was a long spear that appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.
