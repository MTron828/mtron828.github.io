1317 Scale Powder

At this time, the huge ice dragon has already hit the ‘Sphere’ that Ning Yu unfolded.

Boom——

At this moment, an extremely loud sound erupted.

But this terrifying ice dragon didn’t directly explode his ‘Sphere’.

On the contrary, because the ice dragon hit his ‘Sphere’, the whole ice dragon exploded at this moment.

“Damn…”

At this time, Ning Yu’s body also retreated crazily.

The power generated by the impact of the ice dragon is really too huge.

And Lin Xiu, who was holding the White Moon spear, also rushed in front of him at this time and directly stabbed Ning Yu’s ‘Sphere’ with his own spear.

boom–

With the sound of a long gun, the tip of the long spear pierced through his ‘Sphere’ slightly. ‘

Crackling——

And at this moment, with the mobilization of the source strength of Lin Xiu’s body, a large amount of electric attribute energy burst out.

These electric attribute energies directly enter his ‘Sphere’ directly through the point where the spear penetrates!

not good!

Ning Yu’s face changed drastically at this moment.

But at this moment, he has no way to dodge, unless he removed his ‘Sphere’.

But as soon as the ‘Sphere’ is removed, he is finished!

“what!!!”

A large amount of lightning has already entered the ‘Sphere’ at this time.

Those terrifying electric currents made Ning Yu feel extreme pain from his whole body.

He has no way to use water attribute power because this electricity can be transmitted through water.

“Hm?”

Seeing that the electric current did not directly knock him down, Lin Xiu frowned at this moment, pulled out his long spear and continued to stab out!

A small hole had already been pierced on his ‘Sphere’ and Lin Xiu continued to stab at this spot.

Ning Yu, who was shocked by the terrifying electric current, had no way to resist it.

At this time, as the spear pierced the broken hole, a large number of cracks appeared in the entire ‘Sphere’ instantly.

boom–

In the next moment, the entire ‘Sphere’ burst open!

Poof——

Surrounded by electric current, Ning Yu spat out a mouthful of blood.

Seeing Lin Xiuzhi continue to stab with the long spear in his hand, Ning Yu resisted the severe pain caused by the electric current to his body and ran straight to the rear.

He still has a certain ability to resist the electric current. Although the terrifying electric current caused him severe pain, it did not paralyze him.

Lin Xiu sneered at Ning Yu who wanted to run away and continued to chase after him with the spear in his hand.

This Ning Yu deliberately used this large-scale water attribute skill against himself.

Although this water attribute skill affected him at the beginning, the source strength he used up was also very huge.

The current Ning Yu is at the end of his strength!

Ning Yu fled to the back and looked back.

Damn it!

He cursed angrily in his heart, his face grim.

The moment Lin Xiu was about to rush up, he took out a black object from his pocket and threw it!

Lin Xiu, who was chasing after him, clearly saw the black object that Ning Yu threw out.

Lin Xiu, who was holding the White Moon spear, slashed subconsciously.

boom–

As the spear hit the black thing, there was a crisp sound.

The entire battlefield burst out with an extremely dazzling light!

“Flash bomb?”

Looking at this scene, Baili Haoling in the auditorium narrowed his eyes slightly and said subconsciously.

“Small tricks.”

Lei Tong watched this scene and while blocking the dazzling light, he couldn’t help saying aloud.

This so-called flash bomb will not affect Lin Xiu at all!

He still has great confidence in Lin Xiu.

“This is scale powder.”

At this moment, the middle-aged uncle on the left hand side of Baili Haoling spoke.

...

“What is scale powder?”

Baili Haoling spoke directly.

Because she didn’t know anything about this so-called scale powder.

“The powder made from the scales of a special evolved beast can not only have the effect of flash bombs, but also affect people’s perception.”

“This kind of powder is very expensive. Indeed, only the Ning family can spend so much money on this kind of thing.”

The middle-aged man became emotional at this moment.

Baili Haoling’s face turned ugly at this time.

If it is an ordinary flash bomb, although it will blind people for a short time, one can still capture the opponent’s position with one’s strong perception ability.

The impact was not too great.

However, the scale powder scattered throughout the battle stage seems to confuse people’s perception, which is a bit scary.

At this moment, Lin Xiu was caught by this thing and all he could see in his vision was a vast expanse of whiteness.

...

Lin Xiu’s perception ability spread all over the battlefield in an instant.

But what puzzled Lin Xiu was that he didn’t seem to be able to sense where Ning Yu was at this moment!

How is this possible!

Unless this kid escaped from the arena, but in that case, the referee should declare him a loser.

boom–

At this moment, a terrifying spiral of water-attributed energy charged from behind Lin Xiu!

The moment he approached Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu reacted.

His ‘Sphere’ directly unfolded to block the blow.

But this water spiral is very powerful. When Lin Xiu felt that his ‘Sphere’ was hit, he felt an incomparably huge impact.

And it’s not over yet. In all directions, there is a large amount of water attribute energy like an auger bit, rushing towards it crazily!

Bang bang bang——

These water-attributed energies, like auger bits, continuously impacted Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ and suddenly there were deafening noises.

Lin Xiu had no choice but to be forced to resist constantly.

At this time, under the impact of the spiral-like water attribute energy of these drill bits, cracks appeared in the entire ‘Sphere’!

There’s no way, not only can’t see the person, but also can’t feel his existence.

It can only expand the ‘Sphere’ and defend it when it is broken. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

If this continues, the ‘Sphere’ will burst!

“Originally, I didn’t want to use it.”

Lin Xiu’s face turned cold at this time.

At this moment, the source strength of the whole body frantically gathered towards Lin Xiu’s spear!

None of the skills used before used so much source strength.

At this time, the White Moon spear in Lin Xiu’s hand also began to tremble crazily.

There was a raging flame bursting out from the entire spear body.

Those dark blue hellfires distorted the entire space.

‘Profound Intent Sky Fire Meteor’!!!

Just now, Lin Xiu used the ‘Full Blown Profound Intent’ skill. This god-level skill can naturally activate the Profound Intent directly!
