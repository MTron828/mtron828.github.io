1260 Taking the Initiative

Envoy Liu roared with rage. He waved his right arm and a longsword flew out of his drone.

He instantly grabbed onto it.

As he transferred his energy onto the weapon, the longsword that he held onto started shining brightly in gold.

Envoy Liu’s figure shifted quickly and he appeared right in front of Lin Xiu.

With the golden sword in his right hand, he swung it toward Lin Xiu’s body.

He wanted to chop Lin Xiu’s body into two halves.

Xiu – –

Just as he swung the long sword, Lin Xiu’s body disappeared into thin air.

Envoy Liu’s swing hit the air!

Where did he go?!

His eyes narrowed in shock.

Suddenly, he felt a terrifying, strong energy coming from behind him.

Envoy Liu quickly turned around with both his hands on the sword, hoping to stop the attack.

Boom – —

Lin Xiu threw a punch onto Envoy Liu and it landed on his longsword.

The impact of it was so huge that he went flying into the distance with the sword in his hands.

His entire body shook because of the impact.

Boom – –

Not only was it a powerful punch, there was also terrifying lightning that came along with it. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

The currents that came from the lightning travelled through the sword and went onto Envoy Liu’s body.

Damn it...

As the terrifying current travelled through his body, Envoy Liu felt his entire body turn numb.

“Goodbye.”

At the same time, there was another voice that came from afar.

When Envoy Liu looked up, Lin Xiu was headed towards him with another punch!

This was different from the one earlier. This fist was filled with unlimited strength.

By just looking at it, Envoy Liu shivered in fear.

Run!!!!

He had to run away from this attack!

This was what he had in mind but his body couldn’t keep up with him.

This was because the current itself had caused his body to turn numb.

Xiu – –

Lin Xiu’s body flashed and disappeared.

When he appeared once again, his fist was already inches away from Envoy Liu.

“NOOOOO!!!!”

Envoy Liu shivered as he shouted in denial.

The sword in his arms then split into ten different figures and it turned into a shield that protected him.

Lin Xiu’s eyes turned cold. He did not hesitate and landed the punch on Envoy Liu.

‘Destroy the Sky’!!!

Lin Xiu threw the punch without holding back!

The markings on the gloves were shining brightly with a red glow.

The power of his punch was at its peak.

Boom – –

With the loud thud, the shield that Envoy Liu had scattered.

Envoy Liu might have released his ‘sphere’ but Lin Xiu’s punch was enough to cause his ‘sphere’ to explode.

It landed directly on his head!

Envoy Liu didn’t even get the chance to speak when his head exploded into a million pieces.

“Ding! Congratulations master on killing a warrior god. EXP rewarded 1316544...”

Lin Xiu heard a clear notification in his mind.

When he looked at his progress bar, there was only a 0.3% increase.

Lin Xiu was speechless.

Why were the warrior gods worth nothing nowadays?

Boom – –

At the same time, Baili Haoling was still attacking the drones around her.

With each of her attacks, there will be a few drones that would fall onto the ground, followed by multiple explosions.

Envoy Liu brought along a large number of men to fight them but he would have never thought that all of them would be defeated in such a short period of time.

“All of these things can be used as materials!!!”

Lei Chong looked at the drones that fell to the ground and his eyes shone brightly.

Mr Pang couldn’t help but laugh.

They were not at war with Changqing City. He was hoping that their city lord would be able to defeat their enemy.

Otherwise, even if their energy barrier was indestructible, they would not be able to leave the city.

There would be a day where they would be defeated.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu spoke to Baili Haoling as she finished killing the rest of the warriors.

“En.”

Baili Haoling nodded her head.

After making sure of their direction, they got onto Little Bai and flew in the direction to Changqing City.

“They killed Envoy Liu?!”

At the same time, in one of the halls in Chengqing City, Liu Mo was listening to his men’s report.

He was the one who sent Envoy Liu over to Lingxian City.

He wanted to test out Lin Xiu’s attitude towards them.

However, he didn’t think that Lin Xiu would disregard them.

They even killed the men that they sent over.

“En. Not only that, all of the drones that were sent there were all destroyed.”

“According to the latest news, they are headed here now.”

One of the warriors was on one knee as he spoke to Liu Mo respectfully.

“He’s coming to Changqing City?”

Upon hearing what the warrior said, Liu Mo’s face turned cold.

The cup in his hand was instantly crushed into pieces.

“How dare he show himself here in Changqing City?! He’s asking for it!”

Liu Mo roared out of rage.

This was too much. Did Lin Xiu really think that they were afraid of him?

“We are at level 1 DEFCON now!”

Although he was pissed, Liu Mo still quickly calmed his mind.

“Yes, Sir!”

The rest of the warriors answered in unison.

“This time, I want him to stay here forever!”

Liu Mo had a hideous look on his face.

Lin Xiu was lying on Little Bai’s body where he could vaguely see Changqing City.

Changqing City was a place of slightly higher level than Lingxian City and both cities weren’t very far from each other.

“This city seems to be much bigger than Shachang City.”

Baili Haoling stared at the city that they were approaching and was a little surprised.

This place was bigger than Shachange City. Does this also mean that this city would be much stronger?

“It is indeed quite big.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“It looks like it wouldn’t be that easy to defeat them this time.”

With that said, Lin Xiu had a solemn look on his face.

However, this battle was inevitable. Instead of waiting for these men to attack his city, it was better for him to take the initiative.

He still needed a thousand god-level odd crystals.

He shall then see what this city has to offer to him.

With that thought in mind, Lin Xiu’s heart was pounding with excitement.

Boom – –

As Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling flew across Changqing City, there was a loud explosion heard.

As they took a closer look, they could see that the entire city was protected by an energy barrier.

Lin Xiu also noticed with his good eyesight that there was large number of energy cannons that were aimed at him!
