Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

If Lin Xiu wanted to kill them today, it would be an easy task!

Yang Jian sat on the ground with his legs limp, thinking of the stupid thing he did today, his body was still shaking.

Lin Xiu pulled the spear out of Murong’s head and Murong’s body instantly fell to the ground.

Some red and white stuff flowed out from the hole in the head.

His eyes were still wide open as if he died with a grievance.

“Next, it’s you guys’ turn.”

Lin Xiu looked to the side and said lightly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, these people seemed to hear the devil talking and their bodies couldn’t help trembling.

Lin Xiu held on to the blood-stained Dark Edge spear and walked over to them.

Lin Xiu took a step and they took a step back. Now they didn’t dare to fight against Lin Xiu at all.

Afraid, they really felt afraid from the bottom of their hearts.

“Join hands to kill him! Otherwise, we will die!”

A man forcibly suppressed the fear in his heart, then gritted his teeth and said aloud.

As soon as he said the words, the others looked at him and nodded.

Holding the weapon in his hand, he looked at Lin Xiu who was approaching step by step.

“Interesting.” Lin Xiu raised his brows, then said lightly.

Today, Yang Jian’s group made Lin Xiu a little annoyed. Now that Murong and the others wanted to kill him, of course Lin Xiu won’t be patient anymore.

Kill!

Lin Xiu triggered his mind and the body skill ‘Without a Trace’ instantly started.

With Lin Xiu’s body skill activated, his body was like a phantom!

Which is real!? Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

These warriors looked at the multiple figures of Lin Xiu in all directions, their eyes widened and their faces filled with disbelief.

Boom–

A man hadn’t regained his senses and at this moment, Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear pierced his heart directly!

The man’s eyes widened. He had no chance to react, so he was killed!

“Go to hell!”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear piercing the heart of one of his companions, his eyes widened instantly, then he shouted loudly at Lin Xiu.

“‘Earth-Shattering Slash’!”

Holding the sword in his hand, he directly attacked Lin Xiu!

The sword slashed over and instantly a terrifying sword aura burst out, charging directly towards Lin Xiu!

There was a powerful sound breaking through the air.

Boom–

But Lin Xiu stood on the spot and didn’t move at all. The ‘Sphere’ unfolded instantly, blocking his skill, then the next moment, the ‘Sphere’ disappeared again.

If he hadn’t seen clearly, he would have thought that Lin Xiu hadn’t unfolded the “Sphere” at all and he easily resisted the terrifying sword aura.

“What a proficient ‘Sphere’ skill...” Some warriors could not help but were startled when they saw this scene.

“Next, it’s my turn again.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, the spear stabbed out, like dozens of spear shadows stabbing over. The man who had just used a skill to attack Lin Xiu didn’t react then he realized that dozens of blood holes had already appeared in his body, it was too late to even unfold the ‘Sphere’!

Another warrior died in Lin Xiu’s hands!

“Ah!!!”

The rest of the warriors seemed to be crazy at this time and attacked Lin Xiu frantically!

Dang dang-

Lin Xiu waved his spear and in a short moment, he continued to kill the remaining few warriors.

At this time, there was silence all around and there was a bloody smell in the air.

“Phew.” Lin Xiu closed his eyes at this time, took a deep breath and his whole body relaxed.

Just now, he was in a weird state indeed and his heart was filled with murderous intent.

Shaking his head, he swept away the other thoughts in his mind.

He looked to the front and saw that Qu Tingting was still looking at everything around her with her eyes wide open, as if she was frightened.

“What? Scared?” Lin Xiu said with a smile looking at Qu Tingting’s appearance.

Now Lin Xiu looked at the moon-shaped jade pendant around his neck and he suddenly thought of Luo Yue again.

If Luo Yue was here, Murong and others would have been killed by her long ago.

She doesn’t show mercy at all...

It seems that because Lin Xiu thought of Luo Yue, a hint of gentleness appeared in his eyes.

“Hurry up, leave!”

At this time, Qu Tingting walked up to Lin Xiu and said quickly.

She looks very nervous.

“Why?” Lin Xiu said with a funny look when he heard her words.

Since he killed Murong and the others, Lin Xiu was of course prepared.

“Murong’s family has a certain power and you killed them under the Tower of Trials, you would probably get into big trouble.” Qu Tingting said quickly.

She also didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would kill Murong directly.

What surprised her even more was that Lin Xiu seemed to be much stronger than she imagined.

“Where do I go?” Lin Xiu said and shrugged.

“Leave the Sacred Region Academy, hurry up, otherwise there will be big trouble.” Seeing Lin Xiu’s indifferent expression, Qu Tingting couldn’t help but glared at Lin Xiu and said.

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t even look nervous, he wasn’t afraid at all?

“Is that so.” Lin Xiu smiled.

“You...really!” Qu Tingting stomped her feet angrily when she saw Lin Xiu’s appearance.

Boom—

At this moment, there was a sound from the door not far away and soon some middle-aged men in the uniforms of the Sacred Region Academy came over.

“Oh no, people from the elders’ institution are here!” Seeing this scene, Qu Tingting’s expression turned ugly.

“Who did this?” A middle-aged man with white hair around his temples looked at the corpses on the ground without any change in his expression. He glanced at the surrounding warriors, then said lightly.

The middle-aged men behind him also glanced at the surrounding warriors.

“Come over all of you.”

As soon as they said that, those warriors could not help but tremble as they hurriedly went over.

People from the Sacred Region Academy Elders Execution Institution!

Thinking of this, the bodies of these warriors could not help but tremble.

But Lin Xiu still didn’t look nervous at all, looking at the elders.

“I’ll ask again, who did it.” The leading middle-aged man asked indifferently.

“It’s me..” Lin Xiu didn’t have the slightest hint of fear, he walked out at this time and said lightly.
