Chapter 388: The New Dark Edge Spear!

When he saw the scene that unfolded in front of him, Director Zhang’s eyes widened in shock.

He had just heard of a warrior who wasn’t afraid of lightning, allowing the lightning to directly strike his body.

All of the Lightning Birds that he saw now were the ones that were defeated by Lin Xiu.

These were six rank Lightning Birds!

How did a rank five warrior do this?

As he pondered about it, Director Zhang looked below at the edge of the mountain peak and turned quiet.

“Leave, now.” Nan Zhenjun said towards Lin Xiu and he had a nervous look on his face.

“En.” Lin Xiu may be curious but he didn’t say much. He quickly went downhill and soon left the mountain peak.

“Huuuu, we finally left.”

As soon as they left the mountain peak, Nan Zhengjun said as he let out a sigh of relief and wiped the sweat off his forehead.

Lin Xiu hesitated a little before asking Nan Zhengjun, “What’s wrong, Sir Nan?”

“If we didn’t leave soon, Director Zhang would come for you.” Nan Zhengjun answered.

“You really are a bold person, young man. You were bold enough to beat all those Lightning Birds till they dropped to the ground.” Nan Zhengjun laughed heartily.

“Who were the ones who raised those Lightning Birds?” Lin Xiu asked out of curiosity.

From the tone of Nan Zhengjun from before, it seemed that the owner of these Lightning Birds was a very important person.

After hearing Lin Xiu’s question, Nan Zhengjun, who was initially smiling, now had an awful looking expression on his face.

“What’s wrong?” Lin Xue notice the change in Nan Zhengjun’s expression and asked another question.

Nan Zhengjun hesitated for a moment before telling him, “Those were thunderbirds that the headmaster caught just to raise them…”

“No way…” After hearing the reply from Nan Zhengjun, he couldn’t help but gulp down a mouthful of saliva.

The Lightning Birds belonged to the headmaster and he was the one who defeated all of them till they dropped dead on the ground?

As he thought of it, the corner of his mouth twitched with the feeling that he had caused a huge trouble for himself.

“Well, just look out.” Nan Zhengjun patted Lin Xiu’s shoulder and said in a comforting tone.

“Can I drop out now?” Lin Xu asked silently.

“No.”

As they left from the mountain peak, Lin Xiu didn’t follow Nan Zhengjun to the nurse’s office. Instead, he directly headed back to the mansion.

Since the injuries on him weren’t severe, there was no need for him to be treated in the nurse’s office.

Plus, the only thing that Lin Xie could think of was how Luo Yue was still helping him create his new weapon. He couldn’t help but wonder how it was now.

As it was already three in the morning, there were no signs of any students from the Sacral Region Academy.

Soon, Lin Xiu arrived by his house and realized that the surrounding was extremely quiet.

There was a soft, bright light from the garden behind his house.

Lin Xiu walked forward one step at a time and saw the tools that were needed to build the new weapon but Luo Yue was nowhere to be found.

“Luo Yue?” Lin Xiu called out subconsciously.

As he continued to walk forward, Lin Xiu could see the white figure that was on the stone ladder nearby.

Luo Yue was the one who was on the stone ladder, leaning her back against the wall.

At that moment, Luo Yue seemed exhausted and was already sound asleep.

With the moonlight shining on them, it directly landed on Luo Yue’s white, tender cheeks.

Her long lashes and those lips that were like cherries, along with the other delicate facial features, she looked extremely beautiful.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help himself and was staring at her uncontrollably. He then sat down next to her and continued looking at her.

No one kept track of how long it had been but Luo Yue seemed to have realized something. Her long lashes fluttered as she slowly opened her eyes.

She was initially looking exhausted but when she realized that Lin Xiu was staring at her, she immediately opened her eyes wide.

Then, she reached out and was about to attack Lin Xiu.

“It’s me!” Lin Xiu reacted quickly and screamed.

When she heard that it was a familiar voice, Luo Yue stopped and took a good look at Lin Xiu who was in front of her. She subconsciously said his name, “Lin Xiu…?!”

“It’s only been a few days and you already don’t recognize me. That’s cruel of you.” Lin Xiu gave an exaggerated laugh.

Luo Yue noticed Lin Xiu’s clothes that were torn and burned. Plus, the entire head of hair looked as if they had been burnt by lightning and there were spots all over his face.

As she carefully observed the person in front of her, Luo Yue, who was usually cold and boring, couldn’t help but chuckle.

However, it was only within a second where she quickly turned around, refusing Lin Xiu to see this side of her.

“Umm, have you completed it?” Lin Xiu wasn’t even paying attention to her. His eyes were already looking towards the garden, but he noticed that Dark Edge Spear wasn’t around which was why he got curious.

His Dark Edge Spear was still around, right? She wouldn’t have melted it, right?

After hearing Lin Xiu’s question, Luo Yue grabbed a hold of herself and pointed at an item in front of her and said, “It’s over there.”

Where?

Lin Xiu followed Luo Yue’s finger and looked at the direction that she was pointing at. He soon noticed that there was a huge, heavy metal piece that was on the ground.

Luo Yue walked over and took a look at it before saying, “Should be done now.”

As she finished her sentence, she stepped onto a switch and the next moment, the metal plate on the ground flipped open.

Huala~~~~

Lin Xiu immediately noticed the groove that was from inside the metal plate when it flipped open. There was a large huge flame with a large amount of hot molten lava in it.

There was also lots of smoke that came along with it. The air surrounding them immediately turned scorching hot.

Boommm–

The metal plate started shaking violently and soon broke into pieces. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

With the hot molten iron that slowly flowed out of it, there was a spear that was in the middle of the metal plate.

There was a sparkling, white material that was on the spear and it looks like it had completely enveloped the spear.

“It’s done?”

When Lin Xie saw what happened, he asked in shock.

Lin Xiu might not know much about the process of forging the weapon, but from the looks of it, Lin Xiu was sure that the new Dark Edge Spear was a success.

The air surrounding them was still scorching hot but for Lin Xiu, he could barely feel a thing.

He quickly jumped over, landed next to it and grabbed the spear.

While Lin Xie grabbed onto the spear, there was a clear crackle that came from the spear.

There were cracks that slowly appeared on the white, shiny material that was covering Dark Edge Spear.

Crack—

One second later, all of them broke into pieces!

The newly forged Dark Edge Spear was now finally showing it’s true self in front of Lin Xiu.
