1254 Powerful Rollie!

Baili Haoling, who was inside the energy barrier, couldn’t help shouting loudly when she saw this scene.

“Humph!”

At this time, Liu Cheng’s frosty giant sword returned to its original size.

Holding the giant frosty sword in his hand, Liu Cheng’s expression was cold as he watched Lin Xiu fly away.

Because he saw that Lin Xiu, who flew out, rushed back at this moment!

Holding the Frosty Giant Sword in both hands, he slashed directly at Lin Xiu who flew back!

Following the frosty giant sword in his hand slashing in the air, an extremely terrifying ice-cold sword energy slashed towards Lin Xiu in an instant!

Lin Xiu looked at this extremely huge crescent-shaped ice sword energy and immediately snorted coldly.

The Dark Edge spear in his hand also danced in the air.

Following the dancing of the spear, a series of dark blue flaming birds burst out directly.

The ice sword energy charged towards the huge crescent moon!

The skills released by the two sides collided and exploded in the sky.

Boom——

With a loud sound, Baili Haoling and Lei Tong covered their ears, as if their eardrums were going to explode.

Lin Xiu’s body was also sent flying a short distance by the explosion.

Roar–

And at this moment, Lin Xiu heard a huge beast roar.

From the corner of his eye, he looked to the side and saw a giant white beast rushing towards him!

That giant ice tiger!

This giant tiger has a pair of very slender and sharp fangs and it is about to bite him!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he didn’t dodge. Holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he stabbed at it!

boom–

But this giant ice tiger wasn’t afraid of Lin Xiu’s spear at all and even slapped it with his palm!

It collided with the tip of Lin Xiu’s spear and a loud sound erupted.

The sharp tip of the spear did not penetrate the palm of the ice giant tiger. Instead, Lin Xiu felt that he had endured an incomparably huge impact and his hands holding the Dark Edge spear became slightly numb.

At this moment, the giant ice tiger grabbed the end of Lin Xiu’s spear and the other paw was about to slap Lin Xiu’s body!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly, his body turned around the spear and he dodged directly.

And at this moment, with the movement of Lin Xiu’s mind, a large amount of source strength from his body was instantly transmitted to the body of the Dark Edge spear.

At this time, the source strength directly transformed into a large number of hellfires!

Roar–

Just as the giant ice tiger wanted to continue attacking Lin Xiu, it felt a sharp pain in its claws that was grabbing Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear.

He was originally an evolved beast of the ice attribute, but now he was scorched by the flames of hell and its entire palm suddenly became scorched black.

Instantly let go of the Dark Edge spear.

At the same time as it let go, Lin Xiu was about to directly stab it in the head with the Dark Edge spear!

But at this moment, from the corner of Lin Xiu’s eyes, he clearly saw a cold light coming.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu originally wanted to continue to attack the giant ice tiger, but at this moment he could only give up the attack.

Turn offense into defense!

dang–

As soon as he blocked himself with a long spear, he realized that it was Liu Cheng who was attacking with a frosty giant sword!

Baili Haoling, who was standing on Xiaobai’s body, frowned slightly as she watched Lin Xiu and Liu Cheng fight. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

This Liu Cheng has been attacking the energy barrier continuously for so many days, but he hasn’t used up all his energy yet.

At this time, he was still fighting with Lin Xiu and he didn’t seem to be at a disadvantage in the slightest.

“Gu gu!”

But at this moment, Rollie who was also standing on Xiao Bai’s body jumped up.

“Rollie, you want to go out?”

Seeing Rollie’s movements, Baili Haoling said subconsciously.

Rollie’s body swayed for a while, as if he was nodding.

“Okay, go and get rid of that giant ice tiger.”

Baili Haoling believed in Rollie’s ability.

At this time, she thought for a while, then said to Rollie.

The strength of this ice giant tiger was not weak and it was affecting Lin Xiu, who is fighting with Liu Cheng.

At this time, Rollie understood Baili Haoling’s words, flicked its body and flew out directly!

The giant ice tiger was still staring at Lin Xiu who was fighting Liu Cheng on the other side, as if it was ready to seize the opportunity to kill Lin Xiu with one blow.

But at this moment, its eyes seemed to see something flying towards it.

...

Roar–

It roared and a terrifying icy air spat out from its mouth.

The billowing body that flew over was instantly frozen into ice cubes!

Seeing this scene, Baili Haoling couldn’t help covering her mouth.

“Rollie, you’re just frozen like this!?”

But at this moment, when the frozen block of ice was about to fall, a large number of cracks appeared.

Pata——

With a crisp sound, the billowing body broke free from the ice in an instant.

And its body burst out with dazzling white light.

The whole body became incomparably huge.

“Gu gu!!!”

...

Its body was suspended in the air and it seems to be very excited.

A pair of dark eyes stared at the giant ice tiger, with excitement in their eyes.

Roar–

The Ice Giant Tiger looked at Rollie at this time and there seemed to be a hint of fear in its eyes.

However, it seemed that because it showed fear, it felt ashamed and annoyed, then roared angrily.

They are showing their strength.

At this moment, Rollie’s mouth opened wide.

As its mouth opened wide, like a black hole, a strong suction soon sucked towards the giant ice tiger.

The giant ice tiger’s eyes widened and it kept roaring.

At this level, it could already clearly sense the danger.

It wanted to fly away, but at this moment, Rollie’s body rushed over!

The entire mouth has become even bigger, like a monster devouring heaven and earth.

It actually swallowed this giant ice tiger!

And because of devouring this giant ice tiger, Rollie’s body was stretched a lot in an instant.

“Rollie?”

Lin Xiu, who was fighting Liu Cheng, obviously saw this scene and couldn’t help but widen his eyes.

This rollie, it swallowed up that giant ice tiger!?

“Courting death!!!”

When Liu Cheng saw this scene, his eyes were filled with shock.

His own mount was devoured by this monster!?

Liu Cheng was so enraged that he wanted to kill Rollie with his sword.

“Where are you going?”

But how could Lin Xiu let him succeed? With a wave of the spear in his hand, he blocked Liu Cheng’s way.

This Liu Cheng seemed to be on par with him in the fight just now and even faintly suppressed him.

But Lin Xiu knew that he was already at the end of his battle!
