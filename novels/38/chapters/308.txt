Chapter 309: Unicorn Terror Beast

“Above?”

Lin Xiu was stunned and looked up towards the peak.

There were many people heading up. After hesitating for a moment, Lin Xiu followed along.

He was clearly a rank 6 warrior, although his fighting capabilities were extremely strong, it was simply impossible for him to compete with rank 7 and above warriors to seize the Ice Lotus Fire.

Lin Xiu and Hua Tian moved extremely quickly, but the other warriors seemed to be even faster.

They were all heading towards the top.

Rumble rumble-

Lin Xiu suddenly heard a burst of noises as the ground started to tremble.

Roar-

As Lin Xiu walked up, he seemed to have heard a roar. He looked upwards and saw a figure dropping down from above!

Bang-

The person fell onto the ground with a loud thud. A few unlucky ones fell straight down the mountain.

‘What is that!?’

Lin Xiu’s gaze lingered at the top and noticed a giant figure.

It was a monster the size of a hill with its huge and black body with a layer of black scales that covered every inch of it.

On its gigantic head was a black curved horn that instantly pierced through a warrior at that moment.

“Unicorn terror beast!?” Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted when he saw the monster.

The people that he had encountered previously wanted to make a deal with him. But that was only an ‘if’, that is if he could obtain the Unicorn terror beast’s horn, they could exchange it with him.

But after analyzing it with Analytic Eye, it was clearly a rank 7 evolved beast and seemed extremely powerful.

Otherwise, how could the rank 6 warriors be sent down the mountain with such ease?

“We need to find a detour.” Hua Tian looked at the gigantic Unicorn terror beast above, frowned, and said after pondering.

Although he was not afraid of it, it was a waste of time for him.

“No, I want to kill it.” Lin Xiu looked at the Unicorn terror beast and replied indifferently.

The instant he said that, his body flickered and he charged forward with Dark Edge.

Hua Tian was startled by the sudden change of events and smirked.

‘With his strength, can he go against the rank 7 evolved beast?’

“Damn it!!!” The warriors that saw the Unicorn terror beast seemed to be terrified.

But indeed, the Unicorn terror beast looked extremely horrifying and the rank 6 warriors could not do anything.

Rumble-

Just as the warriors were about to attack, the Unicorn terror beast spewed black flames from its mouth towards them.

A few warriors were caught off guard and were instantly charred alive from the black flames.

A few rank 7 warriors and above avoided the attack and moved closer towards the Unicorn terror beast with ease, leaving only the rank 6 warriors behind.

At this time, all the remaining rank 6 warriors looked at the Unicorn terror beast with fear.

Rumble-

But right when they were about to escape, they suddenly saw a blazing bird fly across, towards the Unicorn terror beast!

‘What the hell is that!?’

All of them had a change in expression when they saw the gigantic blazing bird.

Bang-

It struck the Unicorn terror beast’s body. The powerful attack forced the Unicorn terror beast a few steps back.

The flames then enveloped its entire body.

Roar-

As though in pain from the flames, the Unicorn terror beast let out a loud roar.

‘As expected, the creatures from Dark Forest are afraid of fire.’ 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

And although the Unicorn terror beast could blow black flames from its mouth, its body was still afraid of Lin Xiu’s fire.

Bang bang bang-

At this time, the Unicorn terror beast moved its body and dissipated the flames!

It stared at Lin Xiu with its scarlet red eyes. It opened its mouth and spewed out black flames at him!

The black flames seemed to be formed from dense energy and caused Lin Xiu’s expression to change.

But he reacted quick enough for the flames to brush past him before falling to the ground.

Bang-

The black flames unleashed a loud explosion and caused the ground to tremble.

“That kid…is seeking death!” A few warriors snorted when they saw Lin Xiu’s youthful look as he charged towards the Unicorn terror beast with Dark Edge.

They were all rank 6 warriors but were unable to even bypass the Unicorn terror beast.

He looked to be even weaker than them, wasn’t he just looking to die!?

Lin Xiu ignored them and charged forward!

He exerted power in his legs and shot upwards as though he was flying to the moon!

Lin Xiu swung Dark Edge relentlessly in the air and summoned many blazing birds that shot towards the Unicorn terror beast!

Rumble rumble-

All of them surged in the air and turned the ground red.

“That’s a rather neat skill.” Hua Tian watched with a hint of surprise in his eyes.

And as for the rank 6 warriors that wanted to watch how Lin Xiu would die by the Unicorn terror beast were all shocked.

It was a terrifyingly large-scale skill that would exhaust a lot of source strength.

‘How is he doing it!?’

While they were in awe, the blazing birds charged towards the Unicorn terror beast!
