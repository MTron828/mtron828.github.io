1310 The Effect of the ‘Sky Fire Meteor’

There was a large amount of information that rushed into Lin Xiu’s mind.

Lin Xiu furrowed his brows.

Due to the large amount of information from the warrior skill card that entered into his mind, Lin Xiu could feel that his brain was starting to feel a pinch in his mind.

This was different from the time when he used ‘Destroy the Sky’. This warrior skill card obviously contained more power and strength and lots of information.

All of them were rushing into his mind and it was definitely something difficult for one to handle.

Lin Xiu clenched his jaw and slowly absorbed all of the energy that came along with the warrior skills card as well as the information inside it.

Soon, the glow that was once around the warrior skill card on his forehead slowly disappeared and it turned dull.

Bakk – –

After some time, the card fell onto the ground from Lin Xiu’s forehead.

“All of the energy and information has been completely absorbed…”

Lin Xiu opened his eyes and muttered to himself.

The warrior skill card was now useless and it no longer glowed brightly and this was merely a normal piece of card.

As for Lin Xiu, there was a vast amount of information of the warrior skills that appeared in his mind.

“Huuuuu…”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath. At the very next moment, with the control of his mind, Lin Xiu took out the Haoyue Spear from his expansion space.

Lin Xiu then looked around as he picked up the spear.

Then, he started moving the spear in his hands.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

As he moved the spear in his arms, there was a dark blue glow that appeared all around the spear.

Followed by a large amount of sparks.

Lin Xiu could feel that the spear in his hands was getting more and more powerful.

‘Sky Fire Meteor’ would allow a large amount of fire element energy to be transferred over to the spear. With the energy in him exploding, the domineering strength and power of the warrior skills would be released as well.

There would be a large number of meteors that would fall from the sky, destroying a large area.

This was AOE warrior skills.

This was a little similar to ‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’ but the power of ‘Sky Fire Meteor’ was much stronger than ‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’.

“Huu…..if I use this here, it would bring more trouble.”

Lin Xiu tightly grabbed onto his Haoyue Spear and his body started trembling uncontrollably.

If Lin Xiu moved his spear, the skills would be immediately released.

As for the other warriors inside the training ground, they would feel that the air around them is getting warmer as well. It was as if they were getting scorched alive.

Plus, it was obvious that this was because of Lin Xiu’s overpowering warrior skills.

He was merely training and his skills were already this powerful. If he completely released his strength…

Some of the warriors could quickly imagine how powerful Lin Xiu could get and they were looking at Lin Xiu with fearful eyes.

Lin Xiu has already become someone that no one dared to challenge in the training ground.

“Huuuuu…”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and reabsorbed all of the energy into his body.

His hands that gripped onto the Haoyue Spear was trembling uncontrollably due to the vast amount of energy but as he pulled back the energy from it, he slowly regained control.

All of the flames disappeared as well.

The rest of the warriors let out breaths of relief as well.

“I can’t use this skill here…”

Lin Xiu mumbled under his breath.

If he used this skill here, it would destroy the entire place.

He would have to find another chance to use this in an open air space.

Otherwise, if he doesn’t practise using this skill, he would not be able to control when he needs it.

“City lord, is that a god-level warrior skill?”

Lei Chong was exhausted as he laid on the ground with his arms opened wide.

He was drenched in sweat and they were dripping onto the ground like flowing water.

As Lin Xiu reabsorbed his energy, Lei Chong slowly got up.

“En. I’ll head to the other side to test out this skill.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head as he picked up his spear and walked towards the exit.

“City Lord….he’s incredible.”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was already leaving, Lei Chong couldn’t help but mumble to himself.

As he walked out of the hotel, Lin Xiu turned on his GPS and finally found an empty ground.

“This should be it.”

God City was a huge place and there was an area filled with abandoned buildings. From the looks of it, it seemed to have been left abandoned for a long time.

...

He took a good look around and noticed that there was no one living in this area.

Lin Xiu held onto the Haoyue Spear and started moving it around with both hands.

Boom – –

As Lin Xiu moved his spear, there were countless flames that were released from the spear itself.

All of these were hellfire, the strongest flame that he had acquired from before.

However, as he arrived at the Warrior God Realm, it does look like the strength of the flames were not good enough.

But, with the assistance of this warrior skill, the hellfire that he released has reached its peak! F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“AHHHHH!!!!!”

The Haoyue Spear started shaking and Lin Xiu swung the spear across the air.

There was a large amount of energy that was released from the spear and into the air.

Boom – –

...

There was a loud explosion that travelled across the air and it was followed by multiple explosions after that.

With the large amount of energy that was released from the spear, all of them looked like fireworks.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Countless flames fell from the sky like meteorites and they were all headed toward the ground.

Boom boom boom – –

The flames that were like meteorites fell onto the buildings around and all of them caused a huge explosion.

The buildings around him were soon destroyed.

It was as if there had been an air strike.

It was in a blink of an eye where everything was destroyed.

There were countless dents that appeared all over the place and the air around him was boiling.

“Huuuuu…”

Lin Xiu’s forehead was covered in sweat as he tried to catch his breath.

This warrior skill was incredibly powerful. It was even stronger than ‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’ that he had achieved before this.

The only thing that was bad about this skill was how exhausting he felt after using it.

Lin Xiu felt as if all of the energy in his body had been drained.

He had to use at least 80% of the energy in his body in order to use this skill.

At that moment, there was hellfire all around him.

Tat tat – –

Suddenly, there was a weird sound that came from the opposite direction.
