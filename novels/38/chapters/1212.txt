1213 Rollie’s Special Abilities

Fu Tianling noticed how badly Lin Xiu wanted to kill him through the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

Even when he was feeling frightened, he still screamed on top of his lungs.

It was as if he was trying to use his elder brother, Fu Tianyuan to threaten Lin Xiu.

But, would Lin Xiu be afraid of him?

This would be impossible.

“So?”

Lin Xiu smirked. Then, with the long spear in his arm, he went straight for Fu Tianling.

“Move!!!!!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu wasn’t going to stop, Fu Tianling screamed out of fright.

He gathered all of the energy in his body onto his palm and immediately sent a slap from where Lin Xiu was coming from.

Boom – –

There were two rays of golden beams that rushed out of Fu Tianling’s palms and they were aimed at Lin Xiu.

Both these beams were filled with an intense amount of energy and there was also a toasted smell in the air because of the golden beams that had been released.

“Moveee!!!!”

Lin Xiu looked at the energy beams. Instead of dodging them, he attacked them with his long spear!

As the long spear was swung across the sky, the entire body of the spear turned so bright that it was blinding.

“Damn it!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu had not dodged his attack and even tried to block it with his long spear, Fu Tianling screamed as loud as he could.

‘Adjudicate’!!!

Lin Xiu let out a cold laugh.

Then, both the golden beams released were reflected by the long spear that Lin Xiu had in his hands!

This was impossible!

Fu Tianling, who had a hideous look on his face, felt that it was unbelievable as his eyes widened in shock.

He didn’t think that the energy beams that he had released would be reflected back!

“Nooo!!!!!”

He screamed in denial.

Due to the two golden energy beams that have been released earlier, all of the energy in his body has been exhausted. He didn’t even have enough energy to release his ‘sphere’!

Boom —-

Then, with a loud explosion that was heard, his body was hit by the golden beams that he had released. There were two huge bloody holes that were found on his body.

Fu Tianling widened his eyes in shock. This was unbelievable.

Then, he body fell straight to the ground.

It was such a bad fall that he instantly turned into a meat patty.

“Huuuuu…”

Lin Xiu’s body was slowly coming back to the ground as well.

He had used up too much of his energy when he released the divine souls. Plus, he had also activated ‘Rage’. With both these combined, the aftermath of it made it incredibly uncomfortable.

Lin Xiu laid on the ground while trying to catch his breath.

“Chirp chirp?”

“Gu gu?”

Then, Little Bai and Rollie stood next to Lin Xiu.

Rollie looked at Lin Xiu. As it expanded its body, there was a bright white glow that came from it.

What was this…

The light was blinding and Lin Xiu had to narrow his eyes.

As the glow landed on Lin Xiu’s body, there was a comforting feeling that followed.

His body felt warm. The aftermath from ‘Rage’ had disappeared as well.

“Huh?”

Soon, the warmth slowly disappeared. Lin Xiu opened his eyes and he didn’t know what was happening.

He could feel that the aftermath from using ‘Rage’ has slowly disappeared.

The energy that he had exhausted has also recovered as well!

This…..this was so miraculous!

“Lin Xiu, are you alright?”

At the same time, Baili Haoling came from the other side.

She looked nervous.

“I’m fine.”

Lin Xiu shook his head before getting on his feet.

“Thank god you’re alright.”

Baili Haoling let out a breath of relief. Then, she turned towards Little Bai and Rollie with curiosity. “When did these two get here?”

“Oh! Do you know of the special abilities that Rollie has?”

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment before asking Baili Haoling.

Minutes ago, when he was in contact with the bright glow that Rollie released, the aftermath that he felt from ‘Rage’ had completely disappeared!

It felt incredible!

“Special abilities?”

Baili Haoling was stunned at first. After thinking about it, she asked, “it has a good appetite?”

Lin Xiu was mind blown.

“It’s true that Rollie has a good appetite. Every time he eats those warriors, his strength would improve as well!

Baili Haoling answered him in a serious tone.

“He eats warriors?”

“Yeap. Rollie would eat all of the warriors that I have killed.”

Baili Haoling stared at Rollie before telling it, “Rollie, please clean up the bodies of the warriors.”

“Guuuuuu!”

Rollie seemed to be able to understand what she wanted. It quickly moved its body like a small ball. Then, he immediately appeared next to the warriors that Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling has killed.

Then, its body expanded at a very quick speed.

It was now a humongous ball!

“Guuuu Guuuuu!!!!”

There was a peculiar sound that came out of it and then, there was a mouth that appeared on its body.

Rollie’s mouth was like a black hole.

The bodies that were left on the ground were all absorbed into Rollie’s mouth.

Even Fu Tianling’s body that was like a meat patty.

As Rollied was done with absorbing all the bodies of the warrior, it burped.

It seemed to be quite satisfied with its meal.

Then, Lin Xiu noticed that Rollie’s body was giving out a white glow again.

It seem to be evolving?

These warriors might have been killed.

But, their bodies were still filled with energy. As Rollie eats them, it would boost Rollie’s energy as well.

“Chirp chirp!”

Little Bai’s body expanded as well and it started flapping its wings, reminding Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling that they have to leave the place soon.

“Rollie, let’s go.”

Lin Xiu screamed at Rollie.

“Guuuuu!”

Rollie’s huge body leaped into the air when it heard Lin Xiu calling for it. Then, it glowed brightly and reduced its size into a baseball and sat on Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

“Let’s go back to Lingxian City.”

Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling got onto Little Bai’s back.

“Fly in that direction.”

Lin Xiu, who was sitting on the back of Little Bai, gave it a direction. Little Bai flapped its wings and flew quickly. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Just as Lin Xiu left the scene, there was an opening that appeared in the air. Fu Tianyuan then walked through the opening.

His eyes were cold as he looked around.
