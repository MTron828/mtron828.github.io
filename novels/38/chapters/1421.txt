1422 Crazy Slaughter

70th!

Thank you readers!

Lin Xiu was now about to challenge the warrior who was ranked 70th!

“That would be Chen Xian, she’s also a powerful female warrior.”

The rest of the spectators started whispering to each other.

“Will this brat ever get tired? He only joined the ranks today.”

“That’s incredible…”

“Could it be that…he wants to challenge Long Xingtian?”

The rest of the spectators continued gossiping with each other.

Then, there was a bright light that appeared before Lin Xiu.

However, this time, no one walked out of the white light.

About 15 minutes later, the bright light completely disappeared.

“Where is she?!”

The rest of the warriors were confused.

“Looks like she didn’t accept the challenge.”

“That couldn’t have happened!”

“But, Chen Xian is a powerful warrior…”

Hmm?

Lin Xiu was confused as well. He didn’t think that Chen Xian, who was ranked 70th, would turn down the challenge.

Within 15 minutes, if the warrior does not appear, it would mean that they have rejected the challenge.

Then, Lin Xiu could replace her and become the warrior at rank 70.

Time to continue!

Lin Xiu did not stop as he continued picking his next opponent from the screen. He has now picked the one ranked 55th.

“Sister, why didn’t you allow me to join?!”

“If you get up there, you will die.”

The older girl spoke in a cold tone.

“Because of him?!” Chen Xian looked at Lin Xiu who was far away from her and her eyes were filled with disbelief.

Those who were in the top 100 were all confident in their own abilities.

Getting her to surrender before a fight made her feel wronged.

“You will know soon.”

“He reminds me of someone.”

The older girl tried to calm down her younger sister.

Her eyes were fixed on Lin Xiu and there was a complicated look on her face.

55th, Zhao Zao!

Zhao Zao was a man who had a frozen machete as his weapon.

As he stood before Lin Xiu, he sneered, “Young man, I’ve watched all of our fights earlier.”

“Honestly, you are indeed talented but you still aren’t good enough compared to me.”

Lin Xiu ignored him and with Dark Edge in his hands, he rushed forward immediately!

Zhao Zao’s pupil shrank instantly after seeing what was happening.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would disregard him and started his attack so quickly.

The Dark Edge was aimed at his head!

Clang clang clang – –

Zhao Zao then raised his frozen machete and tried to stop Lin Xiu’s attacks.

However, Lin Xiu’s attacks were too over-domineering and there was no time for him to even catch a breath.

“Damn it…”

Zhao Zao’s body was forced to move back and there was a hideous look on his face.

“You’re courting death!”

Zhao Zao roared in rage.

However, he had no chance of a counterattack! Lin Xiu’s attacks were coming at him like a thunderstorm.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

As it continued, his machete was being badly destroyed by the spear in Lin Xiu’s hands.

The dark edge was so sharp and sturdy that it even sliced open his combat suit that was incredibly tough!

[Frozen Seal]!!!

Zhao Zao knew that this would not go on. Then, with another loud roar, he released all of the energy in his body.

With his machete being transported, he released all of them to Lin Xiu!

Crack – –

Lin Xiu’s body instantly turned into an ice statue!

Zhao Zao then showed a determined look in his eyes.

He was ready to attack with his machete!

Snap – –

However, with a blink of an eye, the layer of ice that sealed Lin Xiu instantly cracked!

Lin Xiu then leaped out of the ice that surrounded him earlier and he did not seem to have suffered any damage!

How was this possible?!

Zhao Zao was incredibly shocked to what he saw.

This was a god-level warrior skill of his!

Lin Xiu was definitely sealed in his warrior skills earlier but how was it that he managed to come out of it so quickly?!

Just as he was still in shock, Lin Xiu’s spear suddenly gave off a powerful, chilling energy.

As the spear was aimed towards Zhao Zao and it collided with the machete of the other party, there was an incredible frost energy that appeared all over Zhao Zao!

Then, Zhao Zao’s body was the one who turned into an ice statue!

“That’s….unbelievable!”

The rest of the warriors who witnessed it were incredibly stunned.

Zhao Zao was famous for his specialty in using ice.

However, none of them would have thought that Zhao Zao himself would be defeated by another ice elemental warrior skills that were even more powerful than his!

Plus, they just remembered that Lin Xiu had used flames and also lightning bolts before this. Now, he was showing that he could also use the ice element!

Each element that he had used was incredibly powerful.

Lin Xiu looked at Zhao Zao, who was now covered in ice, and with no hesitation, pierced his opponent with his sharp spear!

Boom – –

The next moment, his entire body broke into a million pieces!

Zhao Zao, dead!

“He killed another warrior in the top 100!”

The audience could no longer stay calm.

Their eyes were all opened wide.

“That brat managed to kill Zhao Zao so quickly…”

Chen Xian, who was still watching the match, felt that this was incredible as well.

Zhao Zao, who was a warrior several ranks ahead of herself, had been defeated so easily?

No! It wasn’t that Zhao Zao was weak. It was the fact that this stranger was incredibly powerful!

He even defeated Zhao Zao with ice elemental warrior skills! Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“I was right when I told you not to fight him.”

The older girl next to her suddenly spoke.

Although Chen Xiao didn’t agree with her earlier, she still nodded her head now.

At the same time, she let out a breath of relief.

If she went on stage earlier, she would have died.

“Sister, do you think he’s going for Long Xingtian?”

Chen Xian felt curious as she asked her sister.

“Of course.”

The older woman nodded her head.

“His aim here is to challenge Long Xingtian.”

“But, is Long Xingtian someone that could be defeated?”

Long Xingtian, the best of the Warrior Gods. This title was not given to him for nothing.

There were already countless warriors that died in his hands.
