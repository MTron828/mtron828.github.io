Chapter 191: The Mist

Hu——

Luo Yue pressed her long sword on the ground and she looked a little out of breath.

That blow just now really consumed a lot of her physical strength.

“Gu lu gu lu…” And the other Blue-winged beetle that was attacked by Lin Xiu with the flames of the ‘Awe of the phoenix’ in its mouth was giving off strange noises.

There was still a lot of white smoke coming out of its mouth.

After a while, it trembled and fell to the ground.

Boom–

The huge body fell to the ground, making a dull sound.

It caused a lot of dust on the ground to fly.

Rollie seemed to feel something at this time and climbed out of Lin Xiu’s backpack, then jumped directly onto Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

It looked around for a while, then jumped out and dived directly into the corpses of the Blue-winged beetles.

Soon, the rank 6 Odd crystals that were like bright blue gems were pulled out by it.

Luo Yue saw this scene and the pupils in her eyes constricted suddenly. She held the long sword and was about to stab Rollie!

“No!” Lin Xiu blurted out.

The tip of the long sword was about to pierce Rollie’s body, but when she heard Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue stopped moving.

Rollie was still trembling and he was very scared.

At this time, seeing that Luo Yue had stopped moving, its chubby body quickly jumped onto Lin Xiu’s shoulder like it was fleeing from her.

“What is this thing?” Luo Yue opened her small mouth slightly and looked curiously as Rollie stood on Lin Xiu’s shoulder like a meatball.

Its two small hands were holding three rank 6 Odd crystals.

“I found this…” Lin Xiu didn’t think much and told Luo Yue about the origin of Rollie.

Luo Yue widened her eyes in curiosity and poked Rollie’s body with her fair fingers – it was soft and fleshy.

“Do you know what this is?” Lin Xiu asked Luo Yue curiously at this time.

Lin Xiu was also very curious about Rollie’s origin. Logically speaking, how could there be such a thing in the rank 6 Green Vine Beast?

More surprisingly, Rollie had a conscience and could understand his words. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“I don’t know either.” Luo Yue shook her head, her eyes filled with surprise.

It was the first time she had seen this kind of creature.

“Phew, let’s take a break first.” Lin Xiu said when he saw that Luo Yue seemed a little tired.

That space crack above was slowly shrinking at this time, becoming smaller and smaller.

This kind of space crack would not last for a long time and would generally slowly shrink until it disappears within two or three days.

To this day, no one knows the cause of it until now.

Zhang Yin and the others were still absorbing the energy of those rank 3 Odd crystals over there.

It wasn’t early anymore and they decided to rest at this place that night.

“Damn it, if the meat of these insects can be eaten, it would be great.” At night, Li Ping and the rest finally regained their strength. At this time, they laid on the surrounding corpses and said aloud.

Drinking these weird-tasting nourishment liquid still didn’t feel very good.

“You can give it a go.” Jiang Li smiled at this moment.

These are creatures from another dimension and they weren’t sure if the meat inside was poisonous.

“It would be great if these stones could be brought back. They should be able to forge good weapons.” Zhang Yin leaned against the huge boulders behind him to rest while looking at these things that looked like stones but were actually unknown metals.

These metals falling from the space cracks were obviously very hard. If you use these to temper your weapons, you could definitely get very strong weapons.

“When we go back, we just need to bring a few of them.” Lin Xiu said aloud.

Although he had recovered his strength, the visibility at night was low and it was more dangerous so everyone decided to take a rest here.

Time passed quickly and as the sky showed a hint of brightness, Lin Xiu slowly opened his eyes.

At this time, Luo Yue was already standing on a rock not far away, looking at something in the distance.

“Awake?”Luo Yue didn’t look back, but she already felt Lin Xiu’s arrival.

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu nodded, then followed Luo Yue’s gaze and look ahead, frowning.

The fog here looked very heavy and the visibility was very low, there was no way to see what was happening in the distance.

Not long after, Zhang Yin and the others woke up one by one and walked to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

“Let’s go, let’s go to the city center today.” Lin Xiu said aloud.

Zhang Yin and the others nodded, now Lin Xiu was basically their core.

“But we can be certain that we won this time, right? After all, we now have four rank 6 Odd crystals!” Jiang Li exclaimed happily at this time.

One piece of rank 6 Odd crystal was equivalent to ten pieces of rank 5 Odd crystals!

“Not necessarily, maybe other people also hunted down the rank 6 evolved beast.” Zhang Yin shook his head and said.

He knew that the strongest person in Class One was a peak rank 5 warrior!

The kind of elite could even kill a rank 7 evolved beast.

“Be careful, the fog is a bit heavy today.” After walking out of the building, Lin Xiu warned while carefully observing the surroundings.

Luo Yue was already holding her long sword tightly with her right hand and it could be seen that she was also on her guard in this strange situation.

As they continued walking, they saw a road that led directly to the front.

According to the map, it would take about 15 minutes to walk to the area close to the city center.

Boom——

At this moment, Zhang Yin, who was walking, suddenly heard a strange sound. He turned his head abruptly and saw a black tentacle which entangled his body instantly!

What is this!?

Zhang Yin was shocked. When he wanted to move, he found that his body had been entangled by several tentacles and he couldn’t move at all!

“Help…”

As soon as he called out, his whole body was about to be pulled to the depths of the mist.

Bang bang bang——

At this critical moment, Lin Xiu rushed over in an instant, the Dark Edge spear in his hand slashed sharply, slashing all those weird tentacles.

As the tentacles broke, a lot of blood-red liquid spurted out and splashed all over the ground.
