1164 Running Into Trouble

As soon as he entered the city lord’s mansion, Lin Xiu could clearly see that there were quite a few warriors walking back and forth.

It seemed like they were looking for something.

“City lord… we’re incompetent…”

Some of the guards who fell on the ground saw Lin Xiu walk in at this time and said out of shame.

They were severely injured and they seemed to have a very difficult time talking at this time.

“Mr. Pang, take them for treatment.”

Lin Xiu shook his head, then spoke to Mr. Pang.

“Yes.”

Mr. Pang responded.

“Hey, boy, tell us, where is this ruin?”

And as Lin Xiu walked over, some warriors who were looking for the entrance to the so-called ancient ruins said to Lin Xiu at this time.

Because they saw Lin Xiu talking to Mr. Pang, they mistakenly thought that Lin Xiu was the manager of the city lord’s mansion.

“You guys are the ones who injured my subordinates huh.”

Lin Xiu looked at these warriors and said lightly.

Today, there were so many ill-intentioned warriors coming to Lingxian City and with what happened just now, Lin Xiu is starting to feel a little unhappy now.

He has become the city lord of Lingxian City. Naturally, he is the supreme controller of this Lingxian City.

These people were unscrupulous in his land, they were simply courting death.

“Yo, you’re quite rude.”

“Can’t you see how much you weigh?”

The warrior who had just spoken to Lin Xiu heard Lin Xiu’s words and his face suddenly showed a look of ridicule.

“Even if your city lord comes over, you have to kowtow to me and admit your mistake!”

He looked at Lin Xiu’s expressionless face and raised his hand wanting to give Lin Xiu a slap.

The rest of the warriors looked at this scene and their faces also showed a look of anticipation for a good show.

boom–

But just as his fist smashed over, Lin Xiu raised his hand and held his fist.

The face of this grinning man suddenly froze. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

And at this time, with the triggering of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the man’s body was suddenly filled with a large number of dark blue flames.

“what!!!”

These dark blue flames directly burned his body and a scream came from his mouth.

boom–

The next moment, Lin Xiu lifted his foot and kicked him.

His body hit the ground behind him heavily.

The rest of the warriors looked ahead and they could clearly see the warrior who flew out. Now his whole body has been directly burned by the terrifying dark blue flames.

Seeing such a terrifying scene, their bodies trembled.

In just a short moment, it became like this.

This man is too cruel.

“You are too vicious…”

Those warriors looked at Lin Xiu and there was fear in their eyes that they didn’t even notice.

“Come to my house to make trouble huh, this is just a small lesson.”

Lin Xiu stared at them and said lightly.

“You are the city lord of this Lingxian city?!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, these warriors reacted quickly at this time.

“Do you know who you killed!”

One of the warriors looked at Lin Xiu with murderous eyes and said.

“We are warriors from the Divine Domain. You, the city lord of a small Lingxian city, how dare you attack people from our Divine Domain!”

The warrior said coldly.

“Divine Domain huh?”

When Lin Xiu heard his words, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

“That’s right, we are from Divine Domain.”

That warrior thought Lin Xiu was afraid and said coldly at this time.

“Now kowtow to me and admit your mistake then lead us to find the ruins, maybe I can show mercy and spare your life…”

But just as he finished speaking, an extremely terrifying electric current burst out directly from Lin Xiu’s body and charged towards him!

crackling-

There seems to be a burning smell in the air.

The man watched the incomparably terrifying lightning strike and although he reacted quickly to unfold the ‘Sphere’ on his body, those lightnings were not ordinary lightnings.

In the next moment, it quickly broke through his “Sphere” and directly impacted his body.

“Ahhh!!!”

These lightning bolts are really terrifying. At this moment, the skin on the warrior’s body was directly scorched black by the electricity.

At this time, out of the corner of Lin Xiu’s eyes, he saw a long sword on the ground over there.

With a thought, the long sword flew directly into Lin Xiu’s hands.

swoosh—

Holding the long sword in his hand, he slashed directly at the warrior surrounded by lightning!

With the long sword, he directly chopped off his ‘Sphere’ and at the same time cut his body in half!

The blood splashed directly onto the bodies of the warriors behind.

At this time, the remaining warriors were all dumbfounded.

In just a short period of time, two of their people have been killed!

Moreover, Lin Xiu clearly knew that they were warriors from Divine Domain and he dared to kill them.

“Do you know where I come from?”

Lin Xiu looked at them and said lightly.

“Namir Planet.”

Before they could speak, Lin Xiu continued talking to himself.

Namir Planet!?

These warriors of the Divine Realm were stunned when they heard Lin Xiu’s words, then they seemed to think of something and their faces became terrified.

They weren’t from the Namir planet and were the original warriors of this world of God warriors.

After joining the Divine Domain, they obviously knew that there was a power they nurtured on the Namir planet.

Recently, they have also heard about the Divine Domain’s power on that planet and it seems that a young man has destroyed it.

This matter has been widely spread among the god warriors of the Divine Domain Realm.

Could it be… that it is the man in front of them!?

Did they just set themselves up for trouble?

“Let’s attack together! Kill him!”

At this time, one of the warriors had already clenched the weapon in his hand and roared.

In Lin Xiu’s eyes now, there is an obvious killing intent.

If they were to escape, the fate would probably be the same as their comrades just now.

But if they could kill Lin Xiu, it might be a great achievement!

The warrior who spoke was a god warrior. Looking at Lin Xiu at this time, there was not much fear.

The rest of the Divine Domain warriors also seemed to notice this and at this time they also clenched their weapons.

“Huh? You guys still want to fight?”

Under the glance of the Analytic eye, all their attributes and power were collected in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

Although there was a warrior of the god warrior level among them, for Lin Xiu, this god warrior was still not enough.

“Take him down!!!”
