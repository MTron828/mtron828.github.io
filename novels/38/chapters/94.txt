Chapter 95: Hidden Treasures Pavilion

“But I do!” Baili Haoling took a shiny skill card out of nowhere and shook it in front of the attendant.

The attendant’s eyes widened like he was terrified.

“Hahaha.” Seeing this, Baili Haoling couldn’t help but laugh proudly.

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched when he saw this – this cheap master acted like a kid.

“Lin Xiu, come here, the skill cards here are not bad. They are definitely suitable for a rookie like you.” At this moment, Baili Haoling waved to Lin Xiu and called out.

Lin Xiu was speechless and felt a little embarrassed but still walked over anyway.

He looked into the transparent glass counter and immediately saw that they were all sparkling skill cards at this side; they were placed in their respective categories, split into spears, knives, swords, and so on…

“I’m already practicing the spear arts, so I don’t need that.” Lin Xiu took a look. He had already cultivated three spear-type skills, and they seemed more powerful than the ones available in the shop.

“Oh? So you use a spear, I thought you use swords,” Baili Haoling said.

Then he looked at the other side, pointed, and said, “I want this one, that one, and this one too.”

“Okay.” The attendant had just been shocked by Baili Haoling’s diamond skill card and understood that the two young men in front of them were not short of money. At this moment, his service attitude improved immediately.

“How much are these?” Baili Haoling held those three silver skill cards and asked.

“A total of 820,000 union coins.” The attendant smiled and answered.

Baili Haoling nodded, then took out a phone that was as thin as a poker card, and swiped it on the machine. The payment was made successfully.

“Thank you for coming.” Seeing Baili Haoling so decisive, the attendant’s eyes lit up as he smiled and said.

“Take them.” Baili Haoling directly threw these three silver skill cards to Lin Xiu.

Although Lin Xiu was a little puzzled, he still caught them instinctively.

“This is a gift from Master, treat it as a gift for taking me as your teacher,” Baili Haoling said proudly with both hands on his waists.

Lin Xiu curled his lips and looked at the three skill cards.

“‘Tiger Strength Fist’, ‘Serial Kick,’ ‘Fire Claws’?”

“En, these three are suitable for your current level, and while people usually focus on cultivating weapons-type skills, but in situations when you don’t have weapons, you have to rely on close combat,” Baili Haoling said.

Lin Xiu nodded. Indeed, he only knew “Rupturing Fist” now, and if he had to fight without a weapon, his strength would be much lower than when using a spear. This was indeed a weakness of his.

“I want to take a look at weapons.” Lin Xiu put the three silver cards in his pocket and said.

“Do you guys want weapons? This way please!” The mustache boss noticed that Baili Haoling bought three silver skill cards without hesitation and knew that these two people were not ordinary, so he suddenly smiled and walked up to them. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

As the mustache boss led him forward, he saw a large number of weapons hanging on the wall.

“What weapons would you like? We have all kinds of weapons in the Hidden Treasures Pavilion and the prices are low, but the quality is good,” said the mustache boss happily.

“l want a spear.” Lin Xiu glanced at the weapons displayed in front of him, although they looked cool, they were not very practical.

“Spear? Sure, I’ll take them out now.” Spears were not used by many people and the mustache boss paused for a moment before he went inside and came out with a couple of spears with a few other staff members.

“This spear is called Thunderbolt, it is made of the thunderstones from Thunder star, what do you think? You can get it at a special price if you buy it now.” The mustache boss laughed and said.

In his eyes, Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling were like fat sheep.

If he didn’t slaughter them brutally now, how could he live up to his Hidden Treasures Pavilion name?

“I just want this one.” Lin Xiu looked at them carefully and found that these spears were ordinary. He thought about it and took the most ordinary spear.

“You want this one?” The boss was dumbfounded. This was an ordinary spear and was simply made with an ore that was a little harder than steel, he couldn’t make much of a profit.

“Well, how much is it?” Lin Xiu nodded.

“500 union coins.” The mustache boss didn’t look very happy at this moment and said indifferently.

Lin Xiu nodded and took out a black card to make payment.

Walking out of the Hidden Treasures Pavilion, Lin Xiu also purchased a mobile phone so it would be convenient to contact others.

Not long after, the two guys walked into the Warrior Hotel.

“Alright, have a good rest tonight. I’ll see you tomorrow.” At this moment, Baili Haoling stretched and said to Lin Xiu.

“Hmm.” However, seeing Baili Haoling actually picking the most luxurious room that cost 150,000 union coins a night, Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched.

‘This man, he’s too rich…’

Like its name, the Warrior Hotel was a hotel dedicated to warriors, with different classes of room and the sizes of the rooms weren’t the same either.

Lin Xiu chose a mid-range room that cost 15,000 union coins per night and had a training space that was 100 square meters.

When Lin Xiu arrived at the room, he let the android wolf return to the state of a robot and placed it aside. He took a bath and sat in the training space that was made with a special wood in his singlet and shorts.

There was a variety of weapons, but they were made of ordinary steel, specifically for people to practice.

Lin Xiu brandished that spear he just bought and released his source strength, covering the spear, then waved it.

Block, pull, thrust, he kept practicing the basic moves of the spear arts and even though it was just an ordinary spear, with the source strength wrapped around it, there was a swish in the air.

Before going on the Path of Death, he shall practice with this ordinary spear first!

After practicing for a while, Lin Xiu put the long spear away, and then took out the three silver martial arts cards that Baili Haoling had just given him.

‘Tiger Strength Fist’, ‘Serial Kick’, ‘Fire Claws’ – these three cards looked really good. Baili Haoling had great taste and seemed to pick these based on Lin Xiu’s current strength.

Would it be okay to use these three silver skill cards at the same time?
