Chapter 454: Weird Robot

At this time, Dean Baili saw the prompt in the lower right corner and said aloud.

“En.” The man on the console nodded, then clicked on the next picture.

As the next picture slowly appeared, everyone’s eyes suddenly changed greatly.

“Space crack!?”

A man saw this and exclaimed in surprise.

Dean Baili’s face also suddenly became nasty.

“Why is there a space crack below!?” A middle-aged man said in shock.

Generally speaking, if space cracks appeared, many unstable factors would surely occur.

It was very possible that something may emerge from that space crack.

“Wait, there seems to be another photo coming!” The man on the console said in surprise at this time.

Lin Xiu recorded all the scenes he saw just now, and then directly passed them to the Sacred Region Academy through the diving suit with a special transmission function.

Looking at the next photos, the faces of Dean Baili and others became very ugly.

“These weird fishes from the space cracks are actually devouring the bottom facilities of our Sacred Region Academy?” Their eyes were full of shock.

They didn’t seem to expect this to happen.

“No, I have to go down in person!” At this moment, the middle-aged man slapped the tabletop and said suddenly.

“Aren’t you afraid of causing a tide of evolved beasts?” Dean Baili looked at him and then said coldly.

“But…” Upon hearing Dean Baili’s words, the middle-aged man came to his senses.

“Damn it!”

“Organize investigators that are around rank 6 to go down and see what the situation is.” Dean Baili thought for a while and then said aloud.

“Yes!” Hearing Dean Baili’s words, those people nodded suddenly and went to make arrangements.

But at this moment, the entire control room shook violently.

“The C11 below was impacted!” The man on the console quickly tapped the keyboard and then said aloud.

Hearing his words, everyone’s faces became even more upset.

“Hurry up! Organize investigators first! See what’s going on below!” Dean Baili said sharply.

They could simply rely on Lin Xiu alone.

But for the rank 6 warriors, Dean Baili really couldn’t find a better candidate, so he could only arrange for ordinary technical staff to go down and take a look.

What kind of evolved beast is this…

Lin Xiu looked at the creature with a huge body and a head that was like a huge ball and was stunned.

Now he seemed to be still accumulating his energy and rushing towards the equipment at the bottom of the Sacred Region Academy.

Lin Xiu now knows that the Sacred Region Academy is a very large ship. If it breaks through the bottom, will the Sacred Region Academy sink?

Thinking of this possibility, Lin Xiu couldn’t help feeling nervous. He held the dagger in his hand, and rushed over there!

Lin Xiu had already swum in front of the weird evolved beast when it was about to charge up and crash.

At this moment, Lin Xiu swung the dagger in his hand abruptly and pierced the body of this evolved beast!

Boom–

The dagger was directly inserted into the body of this evolved beast!

Gurgle gurgle——

The evolved beast seemed to feel a sharp pain, and the whole body shook frantically. Lin Xiu grabbed the dagger with both hands. While preventing himself from being sent flying by its shaking, Lin Xiu continued to wave hard and slash its entire back. A long and deep cut was drawn.

Roar–

This evolved beast made a loud sound. In the next moment, the powerful impact made Lin Xiu fly out violently.

Boom–

Lin Xiu’s body hit a seamount behind, and he felt severe pain in his back. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

He looked towards the front and found that the evolved beast just now had its entire back cracked, and the blood flowing out of its body was not red, but blue, and it looked very strange.

It struggled violently, then the whole body trembled, and there was no response anymore.

Its body slowly began to float to the other side with the seawater. Some evolved beasts in the water sensed something and swam over there too as they bit the body of the evolved beast frantically.

What the hell is this?

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, then continued to swim over there and picked up the dagger from under the seabed.

The space crack just now disappeared slowly at a speed visible to the naked eye which Lin Xiu found quite weird.

He became more and more curious about what happened at the bottom of the sea.

Oh right, see where that artificial intelligence robot is.

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu quickly took out the radar watch.

Upon a closer look, there was a clear dot on it that was flashing.

What the hell is this thing doing!?

Lin Xiu was certain that this robot was definitely not dropped by the people of the Sacred Region academy, and the golden-yellow object it held in its hand made Lin Xiu even more curious.

That thing has a strong energy response, otherwise, the radar would not be able to detect it.

He continued swimming upstream to the target location, just as before, Lin Xiu saw the emergence of the artificial intelligence robot again.

He seemed to be doing something. When Lin Xiu swam past, his expressionless cheek was facing Lin Xiu.

“What the hell are you doing?”

Lin Xiu said aloud, but the voice only echoed in the transparent hood on his head, and no one could hear Lin Xiu’s voice at all.

The artificial intelligence robot glanced at Lin Xiu with blue light glowing in its eyes and then a white light appeared on his body.

There seemed to be some energy gathering together.

What is this?

Lin Xiu was taken aback, but at the next moment, something seemed to have occurred, and the look in his eyes changed drastically.

Not good!

Boom–

A terrifying energy ray hit Lin Xiu’s body directly!

Even under the sea, this terrifying energy ray was so fast!

But Lin Xiu was under the seabed, and his body was greatly restricted. At this time, even though Lin Xiu, who reacted quickly, swam to dodge the attack, this terrifying energy ray still brushed past him.

Lin Xiu felt a hint of pain, and found that his shoulder was already scorched!

He continued to look ahead and he found that this artificial intelligence robot ignored Lin Xiu, but was doing something with the thing with powerful energy fluctuations in his hand.

Soon, the surrounding space seemed to become very unstable and warped.
