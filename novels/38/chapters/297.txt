Chapter 298: Snatch And Curse

The Black-haired Violent Bull howled violently on the ground.

Its seemingly impervious body had been burned by Lin Xiu’s blazing bird and caused it to feel immense pain.

Lin Xiu knew that the Black-haired Violent Bull was extremely afraid of fire when he witnessed its reaction.

As expected, the beasts of Dark Forest seemed to be weak against fire, especially against his Red Lotus Fire. The heat produced by the red lotus fire was 10 times more intense than ordinary flames!

The Black-haired Violent Bull started to roll on the ground.

Not long later, the flames on its body were extinguished.

The thick hairs on its body were gone and replaced with its black and glossy body.

The Black-haired Violent Bull’s eyes turned scarlet red and puffed air out of its nostrils as it glared at Lin Xiu.

Rumble-

In the next second, it was rushing at Lin Xiu again!

‘It’s not dead yet!?’

Lin Xiu frowned, although the Black-haired Violent Bull seemed to be in pain from the blazing birds, it did not seem to have harmed the Black-haired Violent Bull too much..

Just as Lin Xiu was in his own thoughts, the Black-haired Violent Bull was already rushing at him.

But Lin Xiu was not slow in reacting. He moved to the side and avoided the bull again.

With a swing of his hand, another blazing bird flew out from the spear towards the Black-haired Violent Bull!

It became instinctively afraid upon seeing the blazing bird and tried to avoid it.

‘It can dodge my attacks?’

Lin Xiu looked at the Black-haired Violent Bull that was the size of a hall. It was actually able to avoid the blazing birds, surprising Lin Xiu as it was unlike the many evolved beasts he had fought against before.

“This brat is rather strong…”

The warriors behind watched as Lin Xiu battled against the Black-haired Violent Bull with shock in their eyes.

Lin Xiu was fighting against the Black-haired Violent Bull that they had difficulty with together alone and with ease.

“Could he be a high rank warrior!?” The warrior that thought Lin Xiu would have been killed saw how Lin Xiu avoided the Black-haired Violent Bull without panicking and opened his mouth wide as he muttered to himself.

Sou-

Lin Xiu became extremely focused as he avoided the Black-haired Violent Bull’s relentless attacks.

The evolved beast had gone completely berserk and one collision would render him severely injured!

While dodging, Lin Xiu performed a reverse slash as large flames flew at the Black-haired Violent Bull again!

Rumble-

As the flames flew at the Black-haired Violent Bull, there were too many blazing birds. And they were all flying towards it and regardless of how the Black-haired Violent Bull tried to dodge, they would turn and move accordingly.

As more and more birds struck its body, the Black-haired Violent Bull howled out loud.

It started to roll on the ground in an attempt to extinguish the flames.

More and more blazing birds rushed over and attacked the Black-haired Violent Bull’s body as it continued to howl and roll.

More and more blazing birds came over and transformed into a blazing tornado, forcing the Black-haired Violent Bull’s body to turn endlessly!

The blazing tornado formed a powerful gale that caused all the trees to sway.

“What skill is that!?”

The warriors that watched from a distance were all stunned.

They had never seen such a skill before and the flames were emitting extremely high temperatures.

Even with the distance, they were able to sense the abnormal high heat. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Beads of perspiration started to fall from their faces.

The Black-haired Violent Bull continued to struggle in the flames and after a minute or so, the gigantic body that was the size of a hill fell to the ground and stopped moving.

The flaming tornado gradually receded.

Lin Xiu looked at the Black-haired Violent Bull’s body.

At this moment, the Black-haired Violent Bull was completely charred and emitted a strong stench, causing Lin Xiu to wrinkle his nose.

“It’s still not dead!?” Lin Xiu frowned because he did not receive notification from the system.

Lin Xiu thought for a moment and was about to walk forward with Dark Edge when a warrior jumped in front of him.

“Brat, we killed this thing first.” The man looked at Lin Xiu and said.

His intent was clear, the Black-haired Violent Bull was their prey, even if Lin Xiu was the one who killed it, he wanted to be the one to take care of the spoils.

He looked at Lin Xiu and recalled the powerful strength he had exhibited with a bit of palpitation.

But they had at least seven rank 6 warriors on sight. Although they were unable to go against the Black-haired Violent Bull, how could they not deal with Lin Xiu, who looked like a rank 6 warrior at most!?

“And then?” Lin Xiu raised an eyebrow and replied indifferently.

“Then? Of course, the Black-haired Violent Bull’s body and odd crystal will be handled by us!” The man was stunned by Lin Xiu’s reply and answered.

“Fine, if you can even take it.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

He smiled.

People who dared to steal his evolved beasts always died quickly.
