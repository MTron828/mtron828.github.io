In the past, the people of the Black Troop and the White Troop were fighting with each other. Why do the two troops seem united now?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

“Since when is Wildfire City managed by your black and white troops?”

Lin Xiu looked at them and said lightly.

“Joke, Wildfire City, was originally controlled by our troops!”

One of the warriors in the Black Troop laughed loudly at this moment and the next moment, the heavy laser gun in his hand shot at Lin Xiu!

bang bang bang-

Those laser rays shot at Lin Xiu’s body, but they did not cause any damage to Lin Xiu at all!

This… how is this possible!?

Looking at the scene, the surrounding warriors opened their eyes wide.

Their eyes were full of disbelief.

That kind of laser ray has extremely strong penetrating power.

Lin Xiu stood here, not even moving.

Those laser rays shot at his uniform and even his uniform was unharmed!

“Laser of this level doesn’t seem to be very effective.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly. In the next moment, he raised his right hand and in his fingers, there was a white light condensed from the source, which directly charged at the warrior who was shooting at him with a laser gun!

boom–

This laser ray, in the next moment, directly penetrated his head!

The warrior of the Black Troop fell from the sky at this time.

When the rest of the warriors saw this scene, their expressions changed drastically.

“kill him!!!”

At this time, the warriors of the Black Troop and the White Troop all shouted loudly at the same time.

As they roared loudly, the heavy weapons on the aircraft all shot at Lin Xiu’s body!

bang bang bang-

But at this moment, the energy barrier system of the artificial angel was automatically activated.

The energy barrier, like a huge ‘Sphere’, enveloped Lin Xiu’s body in it.

The energy beams emitted by those heavy weapons were all blocked.

Lin Xiu looked at this scene and the fire attribute ball around his neck emitted a fiery red light.

Snapped–

As Lin Xiu snapped his fingers, in the next moment, a flame pattern appeared between the eyebrows of the surrounding warriors.

In the next moment, these people were covered in flames!

“what!”

There was a sound of wailing and screaming and these warriors all turned into flames and fell from the air.

As they fell, those aircraft also all fell to the ground.

boom boom boom —

Those aircraft that fell to the ground exploded directly.

As soon as Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered, the artificial angel flew straight down.

The surrounding warriors, seeing this scene, all subconsciously dodged to the other side.

They didn’t want to be in trouble.

Hm?

Lin Xiu looked around at this time and suddenly found that the surrounding scene seemed to be a little different from before.

At this time, Lin Xiu walked in the direction of the Dark Shadow Base and found that the area in front of him seemed to be blocked.

The entrance to the entire Dark Shadow Base seemed to have been bombed by something.

At this time, if you look closely, you can see that there is a man standing in front, looking at the entrance of the base.

When Lin Xiu saw this person’s figure, he immediately found it a little familiar.

Isn’t this man a member of the Dark Shadow who stole his android battle horse and sold it.

“What happened to the Dark shadow?”

Lin Xiu walked over at this moment and said in a light voice.

“It’s over for Dark shadow… it is over…”

The man mumbled to himself.

At this time, it seemed that he heard Lin Xiu’s words and he turned around.

“Chief… Chief!?”

Looking at Lin Xiu’s figure, his eyes widened, his eyes filled with disbelief.

Because Sima Qiang had appointed Lin Xiu as the new leader, it can be said that everyone in Dark Shadow already knew Lin Xiu.

This man will never forget.

“What happened to Dark shadow?”

Lin Xiu looked at this scene and said lightly.

“They… they destroyed Dark Shadow’s base.”

When the man said this, he clenched his hands tightly, gritted his teeth and said.

It turned out that after the battle, the Black Troop and the White Troop, the two mortal enemy organizations, suddenly united for some reason.

Coupled with the Divine Domain and the Zhao family, Dark Shadow was eradicated in an instant!

Sima Qiang was also arrested by the Zhao family.

After hearing what the man said, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

In his eyes, there is infinite killing intent.

“Take me to Zhao’s house.”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

Hearing his words, the man was stunned for a moment, as if he had thought of something and the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

“Chief, you…”

“Go.”

With this man leading the way, Lin Xiu went directly to the Zhao family.

The Zhao family of Wildfire City is a powerful force entrenched in Wildfire City.

At this time, Lin Xiu and the man had already arrived in front of the Zhao family.

“What’s your name?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

After looking to the front, Lin Xiu said to the man standing beside him.

“Little Zhao Kuan.”

The man quickly nodded.

“Well, Zhao Kuan, right? You go back first and find a way to call back all the members of Dark Shadow.”

Lin Xiu said.

Although Dark Shadow’s base was destroyed and its members were slaughtered, many people survived.

“Yes, Chief!”

When Zhao Kuan heard Lin Xiu’s words, he said excitedly.

Because he had a faint feeling that Lin Xiu’s return would make Dark Shadow revive again!

As Zhao Kuan left, Lin Xiu was already standing at the gate of Zhao’s house.

vwho are you?”

Seeing that Lin Xiu was about to enter the gate, the guard at the gate immediately came over and shouted at Lin Xiu.

The person standing guard at this gate is a warrior at the level of Respected warrior.

Although he was not a peak Respected warrior but using a Respected warrior to guard the gate is enough to see that the Zhao family is not an ordinary family.

“I’m asking you a question, answer me!”

At this time, one of the gatekeepers frowned when he saw that Lin Xiu didn’t speak and walked forward.

boom–

Just when he reached out to push Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu immediately reached out and grabbed his wrist.

“Call Zhao Ran to get out here.”
