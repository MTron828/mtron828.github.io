1362 Forging the body with Netherworld Flame!

The cold feeling of this flame is really terrifying as if one’s own hands are about to be frozen to the point of being unable to move at all.

And there was a strange tingling sensation.

It seems that his soul has been damaged.

It hurts!

Lin Xiu, who had forcibly held back the severe pain, couldn’t help pulling his hand back at this time, panting.

“This flame is too terrifying…”

Looking at his blue fingers, Lin Xiu’s eyes were also full of shock.

And just now, the flame seemed to be burning not only his fingers but also his soul!

“These should just be the peripheral flames that were differentiated from the Netherworld Flames.”

“But even this peripheral flame is so terrifying…”

At the same time Lin Xiu was talking to himself, his blue fingers slowly returned to their original state.

At the next moment, Lin Xiu took a deep breath and continued to reach out to touch the ghostly Netherworld Flame!

If he can’t even resist the Netherworld Flames in the periphery, then there is no way to absorb the real Netherworld Flames!

With the experience from last time, this time, Lin Xiu was able to grit his teeth and endure the pain caused by the Netherworld Flame.

The entire palm of the hand was surrounded by this faint blue flame and soon, the entire hand was stained with a layer of light blue.

In the next moment, a large number of cracks began to appear on the skin.

Pain… It hurts too much!

Lin Xiu continued to grit his teeth and continue to bear it.

Click——

At the next moment, with a crisp sound, the flesh and blood of the entire palm fell down instantly like broken glass.

Lin Xiu’s finger bones were exposed.

“Damn it…”

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and opened his eyes wide.

This flame is also particularly terrifying.

And the scariest thing is, it’s as if his soul has been burned, it hurts to death!

This was more painful than a cracked palm!

He didn’t know how much time has passed. Slowly, Lin Xiu began to get used to this terrifying Netherworld Flame.

After all, he had a heart of frost and strong resistance to fire attributes.

And this Netherworld Flame, to be precise, also belongs to the category of a certain kind of energy. The ‘Engulf’ skill can also be used!

Soon, this group of Netherworld Flames began to gradually become smaller.

And then disappeared.

“Phew, my experience seems to have increased a bit.”

After absorbing the power of this group of Netherworld Flame, the experience progress has increased by about 0.01.

Very little, but no matter how few mosquito legs there are, they are still meat.

As the flesh and blood in his palm had grown again, Lin Xiu continued to walk deep into the forest.

At this moment, Lin Xiu could clearly see more and more Netherworld flames appearing.

Looking at these Netherworld flames floating in the air, Lin Xiu reached out and touched them.

Just the same as before, Lin Xiu absorbed these Netherworld Flames directly with the ‘Engulf’ skill.

Just now he touched the Netherworld Flame with his right hand, but now Lin Xiu touched it with his left hand.

To start, slowly let the whole body become stronger under the tempering of the Netherworld Flame.

Walking forward in succession, after absorbing several balls of Netherworld Flame, Lin Xiu could clearly feel an extremely cold feeling coming from the front.

And in the cold, there seemed to be another extremely strange feeling.

As if to frighten one’s own soul.

The surrounding trees have begun to slowly decrease. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Soon, Lin Xiu could clearly see that there was a sea of flames on the ground in front of him!

The flame is dark blue and looks extremely strange.

“Finally found it…”

Looking at the flames in front of him, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but gasp.

This flame is really terrifying.

Much stronger than the hellfire.

Now this Netherworld Flame is so terrifying, the kind of chaotic fire that even Noble God Riyan fears…

After thinking about it, Lin Xiu shook his head.

Now is not the time to aim too high, we still have to quickly absorb this Netherworld Flame.

If my guess is correct, the origin of the Netherworld Flame should be in the center.

...

“Now is the beginning.”

Lin Xiu clenched his hands into fists. Without the slightest hesitation, he took off his combat uniform and walked directly into the flames naked!

In an instant, he was in the sea of flames of this terrifying Netherworld Flame!

An incomparably terrifying cold with a burning sting, an incomparably weird feeling, invaded Lin Xiu’s entire body in an instant!

And it’s not just the pain in the body, it seems that his own soul is suffering from the horrific pain caused by the flames.

The soul is roasted!

‘Bodybuilding Technique’!

This is the secret technique that Lin Xiu has been practicing for a long time.

Until now, it has been very useful to Lin Xiu.

It can allow one’s physical body to become stronger and more resilient as it is threatened with greater danger and hardship.

Hu——

...

Lin Xiu emptied himself at this time, allowing his body to be scorched by the flames.

Soon, apart from the palms of both hands, there were no problems, but cracks began to appear everywhere in the body.

The epidermis of the body, like broken porcelain, not only began to peel off.

But soon, those peeling skins began to grow at an extremely fast speed.

The physical pain can be ignored, but the feeling of being roasted in the soul is really terrible!

Fortunately, the ‘Engulf’ skill is constantly devouring the surrounding flame energy.

Now that the ‘Engulf’ skill has been upgraded, the speed of devouring has also been accelerated, reducing the pressure on Lin Xiu.

“This kid, I guess he’s going to die there too.”

At the same time, Lu Guangyue has returned to Blackwater City.

Thinking of Lin Xiu going to look for Netherworld flame, he couldn’t help but sigh.

That’s no ordinary flame, it’s the fire of the netherworld!

If ordinary warriors encounter it, they wouldn’t even have time to hide. This kid actually took the initiative to look for it!

It’s just like dying!

“I can only hope that he comes back alive.”

“After all, the Netherworld unicorn’s horn and odd crystal are still in his hand…”

While Lu Guangyue was muttering to himself, Lin Xiu was still being scorched by this terrifying netherworld flame.

After some time, Lin Xiu closed his eyes and sat down cross-legged.

The body was constantly absorbing the abilities of the surrounding flames.

Under this environment, it was more in line with the training requirements of the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’.

He didn’t know how much time has passed, but the healed body has begun to be able to bear this Netherworld Flame.

The cracks on the body just appeared and the next moment, they began to heal again and they would not peel off like before.

After about a few hours, Lin Xiu opened his eyes again!
