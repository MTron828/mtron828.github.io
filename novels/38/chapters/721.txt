Chapter 722 Nine Deaths and One Survivor

“Zhang Zhiheng of the God’s Punishment Guild, this person is someone to be messed with.”

Qian Jin, who seemed to know the middle-aged man, said in a low voice.

“Let’s go… let’s go…”

The other men looked at the head that fell in front of them, and their bodies began to tremble.

Terrifying, it was so terrifying, he actually chopped off his companion’s head with one slash.

And they didn’t even see what exactly happened.

These people gritted their teeth at this time, and then walked over to the eighth passage.

Huangji and the others all stared at this scene.

Originally, they wanted to walk this path. Now that these people were going there, will they encounter anything?

The surrounding warriors all looked over. After what happened in the third passage just now, there is no guarantee of what would happen in this passage…

The passage was very dark, except for the entrance – it was impossible to see what was going on inside.

At this moment, these men walked in tremblingly.

But the minutes passed, and it looked like nothing happened in this passage.

“Huh? Could it be the right passage?”

Zhang Zhiheng raised his brows, and then said to himself.

Boom

But just as he spoke, the surrounding ground shook, and a loud noise came from the passage. Taking a closer look, dense steel needles were exposed from this passage, and the bodies of those warriors who had just entered were all penetrated by the steel needles.

Their death was extremely cruel.

When the warriors present saw this scene, they couldn’t help but gasp.

“This is too scary…”

The warriors behind Jiang Jun all trembled.

These warriors on the Tianjiao list looked impressive in Sky City, but in such a place, they appeared so small and helpless.

“Mr. Huang, what do you think?”

Zhang Zhiheng glanced at Huangji. He seemed to know Huangji and said with a smile.

At this time, Huangji’s face was a little nasty, but he still said aloud, “Nine deaths, one survivor.”

“Among the ten passages, if I guess correctly, only one leads to the right path.”

Hearing Huangji’s words, the surrounding warriors suddenly burst into an uproar.

If so, what should they do?

Although two passages had been ruled out, there were still eight passages left, who would dare to try them one by one?

Some warriors thought of the scene just now, and at this time they all began to stand together in a group.

If Zhang Zhiheng threatened them, they could only resist.

“I see that there are quite a few warriors behind Mr. Huang, do you want them to try it?”

At this time, Zhang Zhiheng looked at Lin Xiu and the others behind Huangji, and said lightly.

“What do you mean?”

Huangji narrowed his eyes and said with a sinister expression. “This is a player who participated in the Fengyun City Warrior Conference. If Your Majesty knows that you dare to make a move, you know what the consequences will be.”

“Haha, of course I won’t do anything, I’m an honest person.”

Zhang Zhiheng laughed, then waved his hand and said.

“But if no one tries, are we just going to wait here?”

“Why don’t we do this? Our groups should send one person each to choose a passage. How about that?”

Zhang Zhiheng looked around and said to the warriors present.

When the surrounding groups heard Zhang Zhiheng’s words at this time, they also somewhat agreed.

After all, if it went on like this, no one would know how to go over.

This was just the beginning and purple gold skill cards and dazzling purple stone weapons already appeared. These were all treasures, and there would definitely be better things ahead.

“You guys have a discussion and send one person out.”

Mo Yong of the Iron Legion stood up and said.

Lin Xiu looked at the warriors around him at this time. At this time, they were all looking at each other, and it seemed that no one wanted to go.

After all, this entry passage can be said to be a sentence to death.

“Lin Xiu, as someone on the top of the Tianjiao list, you should go.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Huangji looked at Lin Xiu at this time, then smiled and said.

He had been unhappy with Lin Xiu for a long time, and this time, he had the opportunity to push Lin Xiu out in an open and fair manner.

“Yeah, let them see how powerful our Tianlong City Tianjiao list is.”

At this time, some warriors thought about it at this time, and then also said aloud.

These people alreayd knew what Huangji was thinking

They also disliked Lin Xiu. After all, Lin Xiu was an earthling, and an earthling occupied the top position. For them, it was a shame.

“Okay, I’ll go.” Lin Xiu smiled and said.

But to their surprise, Lin Xiu agreed immediately.

Even Huangji was stunned.

“Lin Xiu, don’t mess around.”

At this moment, Qian Jin couldn’t help but say aloud.

He still admired Lin Xiu very much, and he also really wanted to fight Lin Xiu, but he didn’t want to watch Lin Xiu die like this.

“It’s okay, let me see, where does this passage lead to?”

Lin Xiu smiled lightly, and then walked out.

At this time, each group has elected a representative.

Although those representatives were extremely reluctant, they had no choice. If they didn’t go out, they might be killed directly by other warriors.

The reality was just so cruel.

“I’ll take the first passage.”

Lin Xiu said with a smile.

The delegates who were sent out didn’t say anything when they saw Lin Xiu choose the first passage, but stood there and watched Lin Xiu walk there.

In their opinion, the correct passage was definitely not the first passage.

There was no doubt that Lin Xiu would die.

Qian Jin was also staring. Although he didn’t know much about Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu was not such an agreeable person.

Back then, he directly rejected the old man Huangji, so why did he agree now?

Did he notice something?

Lin Xiu had already walked into the first passage, and soon, his figure disappeared into the dark passage.

Did he make it?

Qian Jin stared and found that there was no movement for a minute.

“Go and have a look.”

Zhang Zhiheng glanced at a warrior next to him.

The warrior nodded, then walked out to the first passage.

Boom

But when he approached, he found that a terrifying dark red flame erupted from the passage. The man was startled, and his body quickly retreated to the back.

He’s sweating all over his head now and looks a little out of breath.

The temperature of the flame is extremely high, and he was almost hit by the flame.
