1470 Where Are You Fleeing To?

Under the current situation, Huangfu Yuanshen knew that if he continued to fight, he would definitely die.

He was about to break through the space and leave here.

But at this moment, he discovered that in front of him, there were matrixes appearing, blocking the space he had opened!

The pupils in Huangfu Yuanshen’s eyes shrank slightly, and the source strength of his body instantly condensed in his right hand.

Boom——

He directly punched the matrix blocking him with his fist.

Suddenly, a loud noise erupted.

However, these matrices seemed to be elastic. Not only were they not blown away by his fist, but they bounced back directly.

How can this be!!!

He roared loudly in his heart.

Now he has no way to hide in that space anymore.

And at this time, Lin Xiu had already charged in front of him with the black spear in his hand!

The black spear was filled with golden flames.

These Flame of chaos became even hotter.

The space around the flames was distorted badly.

Huangfu Yuanshen watched Lin Xiu stabbing towards him with the black spear in his hand, and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

As soon as he moved, he had to dodge Lin Xiu’s attack.

Whoosh whoosh——

He had just dodged Lin Xiu’s blow, and before he could recover, Lin Xiu’s next blow came!

The speed of each spear piercing was extremely fast.

When Huangfu Yuanshen used his body skills to dodge Lin Xiu’s attack, he was also accidentally scratched by the tip of the spear.

The clothes on his body were torn apart instantly, and a bloodstain also appeared on his body.

It hurts too much!

At this time, Huangfu Yuanshen also showed a look of fear on his face.

At this moment, he felt that he was gathering the source strength of his whole body, and continued to unfold his ‘Sphere’ to resist Lin Xiu’s offensive.

Bang bang bang——

In the next moment, all of Lin Xiu’s attacks hit his ‘Sphere’, and there were loud sounds.

He can’t stop it!

The extremely thick ‘Sphere’ unfolded by Huangfu’s Yuanshen began to deform a little at this time.

Because Lin Xiu’s current strength has improved, the power of the Flame of chaos that he used was infinitely close to the temperature of the source fire of the Flame of chaos.

This temperature was already very high.

Although Huangfu Yuanshen integrated the power of several god kings, at this moment, he couldn’t bear it anymore!

But right now, he couldn’t eliminate the ‘Sphere’ that he expanded.

Once he gets rid of his ‘Sphere’, he will be stabbed to death by Lin Xiu with this spear!

From the corner of his eye, he looked to the other side.

Then he could clearly see Luo Yue’s figure at the mountain peak not far away.

The look in Huangfu Yuanshen’s eyes was changing.

After thinking for a while, the strength of his body suddenly burst out.

Lin Xiu, who was about to continue attacking him, could clearly see the dazzling light in his eyes.

what happened?!

Affected by the dazzling light, everything Lin Xiu saw turned white.

The second that Lin Xiu was blocked by the white light, Huangfu Yuanshen’s figure disappeared!

not good!

In a blink of an eye, he looked to the other side, and saw Huangfu Yuanshen appearing on Luoyue’s side in the opposite mountain range!

This guy wants to hold Luo Yue hostage!

Damn it!

Lin Xiu’s face became extremely ugly.

At this time, with Lin Xiu’s thoughts, his figure disappeared instantly.

Now Lin Xiu’s strength has reached the level of a god king, and he was much stronger than ordinary god kings.

He was also more proficient with the use of body skills.

The current ‘Flashing Souls’ movement method was already equivalent to teleportation!

He instantly disappeared in place.

Huangfu Yuanshen was grinning, and was about to grab the injured Luo Yue with his hand.

“Where are you running to?”

But at this moment, a figure appeared in front of him.

Lin Xiu!

When Huangfu Yuanshen saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank involuntarily.

Why, why is his speed so fast!!!

At this moment, he roared in his heart.

He knew that Lin Xiu cared about this woman very much, and originally wanted to hold her hostage.

But now, it’s obviously impossible.

“Die!!!”

He roared, and a large amount of energy gathered into his mouth.

As he sprayed vigorously, all those terrifying energies rushed towards Lin Xiu’s body!

At this time, Lin Xiu’s body was surrounded by a large number of Flame of chaos.

All the energy sprayed out from his mouth was blocked by this Flame of chaos!

It didn’t cause any harm to Lin Xiu at all!

Huangfu Yuanshen watched this scene and his body was trembling.
