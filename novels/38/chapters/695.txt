Chapter 696 Top of the Tianjiao List, the Combat Strength of Over 10,000!

“Who’s here?”

Hearing this voice, Lei Tong in the audience was startled.

Because he could clearly feel it now, the surrounding warriors seemed to have become extremely excited.

Among the crowd in front, a path was also made.

A man in white with a giant sword on his back was walking slowly. His pace was very slow, but every step he took made people feel a strong sense of oppression.

The man looked like he was in his twenties with an indifferent expression and there seemed to be no emotional fluctuations in his eyes.

Is this the person who is number one on the Tianjiao list?

Lin Xiu watched the man approach from a distance, and his eyes narrowed.

Even from this distance, Lin Xiu could feel the oppressive feeling coming from him.

Without thinking too much, Lin Xiu directly activated the Analytic Eye:

Name: Wu Changkong

Rank: Master Warrior

Strength: 2005 Physique: 2001

Speed: 716

Combat Strength: 10257

Damn it!

Seeing this data, Lin Xiu’s eyes could not help but change slightly.

This guy’s strength and physique were both 2000, he’s a pervert!

Moreover, the combat strength was more than 10,000!

Is this the level of a master warrior?

At this time, Lin Xiu firmly held the Dark Edge spear in his hand, and his body trembled slightly.

This was not fear, but he was trembling with excitement.

Lin Xiu, who had just entered the ninth rank, really wanted to fight with a real expert to show his strength. “Wu Changkong! It’s Wu Changkong!”

“Wu Changkong, the top warrior of the Tianjiao list, is finally here! That arrogant boy is dead!”

As the man in white came over, the surrounding warriors were extremely excited, like fans who saw their idols.

“En?”

Wu Changkong walked over and immediately saw Lin Xiu standing on the warrior platform.

At this moment, his eyes changed slightly.

“Interesting, someone dared to stand here this

year.”

Wu Changkong looked at Lin Xiu who was standing on the competition stage, and said lightly.

This competition platform was his exclusive position. In last year’s competition, no one dared to stand on it.

Not only did someone stand on it this year, but it was a boy with black pupils.

Wonder if he has an exaggerated opinion of one’s own abilities or does he really have such strength? When Wu Changkong was about to reach the competition stage, he lightly stepped on his right foot, and his whole body seemed to be flying up in the air. “Did you come from Earth?”

Wu Changkong looked at Lin Xiu, and then said lightly. “You can tell?”

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed involuntarily.

“Of course, because just yesterday, I was in the Guli Desert and killed a few.”

Wu Changkong sneered.

Lin Xiu’s expression changed slightly. The Guli desert he mentioned, if he guessed correctly, was the area where the spaceship landed.

Those who came in the spaceship with him and others were killed?

“Trash, you must have the consciousness to be disposed of.”

Wu Changkong said lightly. “Who is trash, we’ll find out later.”

Lin Xiu looked at him, and said lightly.

“Ridiculous attempt.” As Wu Changkong’s words just fell, at this moment, he moved!

Swoosh

Lin Xiu’s eyes saw that he disappeared and the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

The next moment, Wu Changkong’s figure appeared in front of Lin Xiu, his fist smashed directly at Lin Xiu’s body!

His speed was too fast, so fast that Lin Xiu had no time to dodge, so he could only hold his hands in front of him, blocking his attack.

Boom–

In the next moment, the powerful impact made Lin Xiu’s body fly out.

When he was about to fly out of the competition stage, Lin Xiu stomped on the ground with his feet firmly on the ground, preventing his body from flying out. “Oh? You could resist it?” Wu Changkong looked at this scene with a slightly surprised look.

After Lin Xiu stood still on the ground, the expression in his eyes changed slightly, his chest was tight, his throat was sweet, and he spit out a mouthful of blood.

A punch, just this simple punch, actually made Lin Xiu feel the qi and blood all over his body surging.

And there was also a burst of pain in the arm that resisted his punch.

“This kid, to be able to take Wu Changkong’s punch, is considered to be a worthy death.”

“Hmph, for Wu Changkong, killing him is too easy!”

The surrounding warriors looked at Lin Xiu over there and seemed to have concluded that Lin Xiu would definitely be killed by Wu Changkong next.

“Brother Lin, you can jump directly off the competition stage!”

Chen Lan stood up at this time, and then shouted to Lin Xiu over there.

Wu Changkong’s strength was really terrifying. Just now, with his speed that seemed to be teleporting, and the power of his punch, even Chen Lan, who was sitting in the audience, was shocked.

Even if Lin Xiu was a rank 9 warrior, even if Lin Xiu had just killed Lu Jiang, who was ranked seventh on the Tianjiao list, he had no chance of winning against Wu Changkong! Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

If you are not careful, you will pay with your life.

“I’m fine.”

Lin Xiu, who has good hearing ability, heard the voice over there, and then said lightly.

In the next moment, Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and hit the ground with force, and the whole spear plunged into the ground.

When some warriors saw this scene, the expressions in their eyes could not help but change slightly.

This warrior platform was made of diamond rock, and it was very hard yet Lin Xiu could pierce through with his spear so easily. What a terrifying force.

“Since you use your fists, I will play with you with my fists too.”

Lin Xiu looked at Wu Changkong not far away, touched the blood on his lips, and said with a faint smile.

“He can still laugh?” “Shouldn’t he be scared stupid?”

“Definitely, this kid is really stupid.”

Lin Xiu ignored the noisy noises around him, took a deep breath, and directly activated the ‘Heavenly Array’!

As soon as the ‘Heavenly Array’ was used, with Lin Xiu in the center, a bright light suddenly released, and then covered the entire competition stage.

“Oh? The source field?”

Wu Changkong didn’t seem surprised at all, he still looked very relaxed. At this moment, Lin Xiu’s thoughts moved, and all the source strength in his body was released, and then all surrounded his body.

“Warm up, let’s begin.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, and in the next moment, his body moved, and he disappeared in place in an instant, just like Wu Changkong!

What a fast speed!

The surrounding warriors were all shocked.

They had no idea that Lin Xiu would be able to break out at such a terrifying speed.

“Too slow.”

But Wu Changkong shook his head, then slammed his fist towards the back!

Boom
