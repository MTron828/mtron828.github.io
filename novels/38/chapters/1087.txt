Chapter 1088: Self-destruction!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he said lightly.

This Frost Dragon was struggling to its death.

Um!?

At this moment, the frost dragon seemed to stop emitting those white energy.

The whole body suddenly swelled up.

What is happening?!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s expression changed slightly.

Wait…

not good!

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something and his face changed drastically.

And at this very moment, the body of this frost dragon has swelled to the extreme!

Boom—

Unexpectedly, it actually exploded.

The explosion was really terrifying and the entire ten-mile radius around it was affected.

At this time, some of the surrounding ice peaks all collapsed.

At this time, Bai Zhan and the others unfolded their ‘Sphere’, then flew into the air.

But even so, the terrifying impact still sent them flying to the back.

“I didn’t expect that... this damn frost dragon would explode.”

Bai Zhan said subconsciously at this time.

A smear of blood slowly flowed out from the corner of his mouth.

The huge impact from the explosion of the frost dragon just now caused him to be severely injured at such a distance.

“But that kid is surely dead.”

Under such a close-range impact, Lin Xiu would definitely be bombed to the point of not even having anything left behind.

Next, when the aftermath completely dissipated, it was their turn to search for the Frost Dragon’s odd crystal.

“Phew.”

At the same time, Lin Xiu, who was in the midst of the explosion, took a deep breath.

Taking a closer look at this time, Lin Xiu had a lot of scars on his body.

And there was also a smear of blood on the lips.

At that moment, Lin Xiu directly activated ‘Golden Body Immortality’ to resist the shock at the moment of the explosion.

But the rest of the aftermath still caused Lin Xiu a lot of damage.

Looking closely at this time, huge pits appeared directly on the surrounding ground and they seemed bottomless.

Down there, they were ice blocks, without the slightest soil.

At this moment, Lin Xiu hesitated for a while, then flew down directly.

Soon, after Lin Xiu flew to the bottom, he found an Odd crystal emitting a strong purple light.

At this moment, the purple light emitted by the Odd crystal was too strong.

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, his eyes narrowed slightly.

What a strong energy fluctuation!

The energy contained in this odd Crystal was far more powerful than the odd Crystal obtained before.

And beside this Odd crystal, there was a white object.

Hm?

Lin Xiu raised his brows, took a closer look and found that this was the horn of the frost dragon.

Although the Frost Dragon’s self-destruction caused its own body to be blown to pieces, the hardness of this horn and this Odd crystal was very high and they were not damaged at all.

As long as you get these two things, you should be able to get the ‘Silence’ skill Card.

boom–

Just when Lin Xiu stretched out his hand and wanted to put the Odd crystal and the horn of the frost dragon in his pocket, a sword aura charged down from above!

Lin Xiu clearly felt the terrifying sword aura and the ‘Sphere’ of his body immediately unfolded.

That sword aura was completely blocked by Lin Xiu’s “Sphere”.

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t care why the sword aura came down and he directly reached out to pick up the Odd crystal and the horn of the frost dragon on the ground.

“Hand them over!”

And at this moment, several warriors flew down directly above.

Taking a closer look, it was Bai Zhan who was leading.

“Boy, I didn’t expect that you are not dead yet.”

At this moment, Bai Zhan stared at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

He thought that he could come here to get this Odd crystal, but he found out that Lin Xiu was already here.

Moreover, this odd crystal and the horn of the frost dragon, were all in Lin Xiu’s hands.

How is this possible? The terrifying explosion just now should have killed him directly.

But this kid, is actually still here and doesn’t seem to have suffered any major damage.

“Why, do you want the Odd crystal?”

Lin Xiu held the Odd crystal in his hand, looked at them and said lightly.

At this time, these warriors had already begun to surround Lin Xiu.

There was a fierce light in their eyes.

“If you don’t want to die, hand it over.”

Bai Zhan said lightly at this time.

He was still a little apprehensive about Lin Xiu’s strength.

Especially when he was able to survive this kind of explosion just now.

His strength is unfathomable.

“What if I say no.”

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched and he said lightly. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He looked at Bai Zhan and the others.

In the eyes of Lin Xiu now, these people are all experience points!

Although the frost dragon died by self-destruction just now, Lin Xiu still gained experience.

On the experience panel, Lin Xiu’s experience progress bar has reached about 90%.

As long as he killed a few more Sage warrior-level warriors, he should be able to level up again!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu looked at them, with uncontrollable killing intent in his eyes.

“Courting death!”

Bai Zhan also clearly felt the killing intent in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

At this moment, he roared angrily and the long sword in his hand directly attacked Lin Xiu!

The same was true for the surrounding Sage warriors.

“Humph!”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu snorted coldly.

With a thought, the Odd crystal in his hand and the horn of the frost dragon instantly disappeared from Lin Xiu’s hand.

Holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he directly drew an arc.

Dang dang-

At this moment, all the weapons of Bai Zhan and others were blocked by the spear drawn by Lin Xiu.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu continued to activate the ‘Reset’, then activated the ‘Fury’ skill.

Because the time for the ‘Fury’ he just used was almost up.

If he did not continue to use it, he would enter a state of sequelae.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s strength was still at its peak.

Destiny Spear art was used and he frantically attacked Bai Zhan.

Seeing this scene, Bai Zhan’s expression changed slightly. He also held the weapon in his hand and fought against Lin Xiu’s spear.

The Destiny Spear art used by Lin Xiu was really too powerful, Bai Zhan can only use his own weapons to resist at this time and he has no power to fight back at all.

At this time, the rest of the Sage warriors attacked directly from all around.

“Get lost!”

When Lin Xiu saw this scene out of the corner of his eyes, he immediately shouted.

At this moment, an extremely powerful force burst out from Lin Xiu’s body.

At this moment, all the warriors who were besieged by this terrifying force were directly sent flying out!

Fury didn’t last long. At this time, he should deal with them quickly!
