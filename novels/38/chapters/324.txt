Chapter 325: Luo Yue’s Enemy

Lin Xiu was surprised when he saw this scene.

Luo Huatian’s strength was really terrifying and he disappeared without Lin Xiu realizing it at all.

“He’s from The Dark World and isn’t like us ordinary humans.” Luo Yue stared towards the front and said faintly.

“The Dark World?”

Lin Xiu had heard about this so-called Dark World and was a little confused.

Is this so-called Dark World really so scary?

Luo Yue nodded and continued, “The Dark World is at the abandoned zones, where the facilities are backward and broken and there are evolved beasts, zombies and some people living there.”

“There are no rules and one could be killed at any time.”

With this, Luo Yue paused, then continued, “And he is one of them who lives there.”

“But isn’t he your brother…”

Lin Xiu hesitated a little at this moment and said aloud.

“When he was five years old, my family sent him there to live alone.” Luo Yue spoke without hesitation.

Five years old!?

Lin Xiu was surprised when he heard Luo Yue’s words.

Going to a place like this at the age of five is just seeking death!

“When he was five years old, he killed a quasi-warrior.” Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu and said.

“Ahem.” Lin Xiu was a little embarrassed at this time. Luo Yue was clearly talking about the first encounter with Lin Xiu. At that time, Lin Xiu was still a beginner warrior.

Which meant that if five-year-old Luo Huatian met Lin Xiu, he could have killed Lin Xiu?

“I’m really curious about how your family is like.” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but sigh.

Luo Yue possessed such terrifying strength at such a young age and Luo Huatian’s strength was even more astonishing.

If he guessed it right, Luo Huatian should have the strength of a rank 8 warrior!

Even the thought of a rank 8 warrior was terrifying.

Luo Yue’s body froze for a moment, but this time, she didn’t say anything and walked directly to the front. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu felt the change in Luo Yue’s expression and knew that she didn’t want to talk about it. So Lin Xiu didn’t say much.

“By the way, what are you doing here?” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue, puzzled.

“Is it to find the ice lotus fire?”

“No.” Luo Yue shook her head as she walked.

There was a cold look in her eyes.

“Came to kill someone.”

“Kill someone?” Lin Xiu was taken aback and subconsciously said out loud.

“An enemy.” Luo Yue nodded, then became silent.

She was not someone who likes to talk; if it weren’t for Lin Xiu, she wouldn’t have spoken so much.

The sky has getting darker and they continued to walk down the mountain. Soon, they arrived at the base of the mountain.

“Wait, I’ll go get something.”

Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue as soon as they reached the base of this mountain, .

Luo Yue nodded.

Lin Xiu walked to the front and found that there were already a lot of sharp rocks on this side.

And the Unicorn terror beast that fell was still here, the sharp rocks had penetrated its body.

The blood that flowed out seemed to have hardened and there were many black substance on the body of this unicorn beast.

Part of its body had turned into white skeletons, which appeared to be caused by these things eating it.

Takinga closer look, aren’t these things the same Scavenger Crows that Lin Xiu encountered previously!?

At this moment, as Lin Xiu walked over, the Scavenger Crows had already pecked the body of the beast till it was completely gone.

The body of this unicorn beast was completely gone in a short moment.

As Lin Xiu approached, the Scavenger Crows seemed frightened as they fluttered their wings and flew away.

Lin Xiu saw this and his expression changed. The Dark Edge Spear he was holding in his right-hand shot out directly.

Swish——

There was a sound that cut through the air and those Scavenger Crows that flew away were all sliced by Lin Xiu.

The other Scavenger Crows also sensed the horror of Lin Xiu and they didn’t even continue to attack Lin Xiu.

Instead, they flew directly to the other side.

Lin Xiu curled his lips. Although he didn’t didn’t gain much experience in killing these Scavenger Crows, they were still experience points, after all.

He shook his head and looked at the corpse of the Unicorn terror beast. It had completely turned into bones. Fortunately, the sharpest part of its body, that is, its horn, was still here.

Lin Xiu slammed hard then inserted the Dark Edge Spear into the ground as he stretched his hands toward the horn of the Unicorn terror beast.

He stepped on the white bones with his foot, then with a violent force, he pulled the sharp and huge horn directly from its body.

Looking at it closely now, the horn of this unicorn was like black jade and it has a very smooth surface.

And its tip looked very sharp.

Lin Xiu put this thing in his backpack. The backpack was filled in an instant and even exposed half of it.

“Gu Gu Gu——”

Rollie, who was inside Lin Xiu’s backpack, made a disgruntled sound as it was being squashed.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but smile.

“Settled?” Luo Yue stood at where she was just now and said when she saw Lin Xiu walking over.

“En, let’s go!”

Lin Xiu nodded and they continued walking for a distance before they reached the area where there were many corpses of warriors.

“I found your sword here.” The corpses of the warriors had all been eaten by Scavenger Crows. There were skeletons everywhere and under the moonlight, they looked terrifying.

“These people wanted to kill me.” Luo Yue glanced around, then continued to speak, “So I killed them all.”

“The person you said you wanted take revenge was also killed by you?” Lin Xiu thought about it and asked.

Luo Yue said just now that her main purpose of coming here was not to find ice lotus fire but to take revenge.

“No.” Luo Yue shook her head.

“I was almost killed by her here, so my sword fell.”

As Luo Yue spoke, her eyes were icy..

“That…”

“Let’s rest here tonight, she would probably make her way here tomorrow.” Luo Yue seemed to know what Lin Xiu wanted to say and she spoke before Lin Xiu could say anything.
