Chapter 616: Easy Kill

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu was a little curious at this time, but he didn’t think much about it.

After thinking for a while, he carried his spear and walked directly to the arena.

This arena was very bright.

The blood from before seemed to have been cleaned up.

“Huh! Is he new here?”

“He doesn’t look great ah...”

The audience saw Lin Xiu’s appearance and couldn’t help but burst into an uproar.

Because most of the warriors go through training and appeared bulky and strong.

These warriors appeared very strong like the kobold who just won ten games in a row, his body was very muscular.

But Lin Xiu looked so ordinary.

“The new contestant Ah Yue, will be against...” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“Our 15-game winning streak contestant, Elephant!”

The host stood on the small flying saucer-like aircraft at this time, holding the wireless microphone in his hand and said loudly.

His voice was instantly transmitted to the surroundings.

“Whoa!!!”

The contestant, codenamed Elephant, stood up at this time, and all the spectators around were excited.

Boom–

Lin Xiu turned around and looked back, and he felt the ground vibrate slightly. A sturdy man with an elephant bronze mask jumped up!

“He’s deadmeat! He’s against the elephant the moment he arrived!”

“Elephant is pretty lucky. He gets such a weak opponent every time.”

“I want to see Elephant and Kobold fight!”

At this time, the surrounding audience was all having a heated discussion.

“Boy, I’m so sorry that it’s me you’re against.”

The man stared at Lin Xiu through the bronze mask and said in a deep voice.

“Oh, it’s you.”

Lin Xiu raised his brows at this time. Based on his voice, Lin Xiu could easily recognize that this guy was one of the men who was in the locker room.

“Get ready!”

As the host shouted loudly, lightning walls instantly appeared around the arena, trapping the two of them in it.

“Tsk tsk, boy, you’re dead.” The elephant clenched his hands into fists at this moment, and in the next moment, a crackling sound came.

“Tear him apart! Tear him apart!”

At this time, the audience around yelled hysterically.

The Elephant shook his head, relaxed his joints, and in the next moment, he waved his huge fists and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

“Goodbye! Boy!”

The Elephant roared loudly, and when he rushed in front of Lin Xiu, that huge fist was about to smash Lin Xiu’s head directly!

Boom–

At this moment, there was a dull sound in the air, as if the space had burst open.

But what made Elephant’s eyes change was that Lin Xiu avoided his attack!

How can it be!?

The expression in Elephant’s eyes changed, and then he turned around suddenly, and saw Lin Xiu appearing behind him.

“You don’t need weapons?”

Lin Xiu looked at him from a distance at this time, and then said lightly.

“Do I need a weapon to deal with you? I will tear you to shreds with my bare hands!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu actually avoided his attack, he suddenly became furious.

He felt like he had been insulted.

Lin Xiu squinted his eyes under the mask, and then he put the Dark Edge spear on the ground next to him, and rushed out without waiting for Elephant to rush over!

“Is he crazy!?”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s actions, the whole scene was in an uproar.

They thought that Lin Xiu had to rely on his flexible body, and then use the spear he was holding to fight the elephant at a distance so that he still had a chance of winning.

But Lin Xiu was now giving up his weapon and rushing towards the elephant. Isn’t this courting death!

“Elephant, tear up that idiot for me!!!” some audience members shouted loudly.

“Tear him apart ! Tear him apart!”

Some people became even more excited when they thought of the bloody scene.

“Go to hell!”

The Elephant watched Lin Xiu rush over, and his entire body burst out with extremely strong power. His huge fist was already covered with source strength, and it was about to smash at Lin Xiu who was rushing over!

But Lin Xiu, who rushed over, turned slightly to the side, and after dodging his punch, he smashed Elephant’s body with a backhand fist!

And at this time, the gloves on Lin Xiu’s fist seemed to turn red because of Lin Xiu’s surge of power.

Boom–

A dull sound sounded, and the huge body of Elephant flew out like a broken kite!

As soon as it flew out a certain distance, Elephant’s body rotated around in the air, and then he half-knelt on the ground.

Pff—

At this moment, he felt a tightness in his chest, and a smear of blood flowed from the corner of his mouth.

But because he was wearing a mask, no one could see this scene.

When the people around saw this scene, there was a sudden silence.

“That kid... sent Elephant flying?”

When some people saw this scene, they couldn’t help but widened their eyes, their eyes filled with disbelief.

“Boy, this time I’m serious!”

Elephant also faintly felt that something was wrong at this time. Lin Xiu did not seem to be as weak as he looked from the outside.

He’s strong.

“Well, whatever.”

Lin Xiu said lightly, as if not panicking at all.

“Don’t be too arrogant!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the elephant was really furious this time. He stood up abruptly, waved his right hand, and shouted at the same time, “‘Ripping claws’!!!”

Elephant let out a loud roar at this moment, and in the next moment, as his right hand extended,, his claws instantly transformed into a giant black claw, grabbing at Lin Xiu’s body!

Boom–

But Lin Xiu didn’t dodge at all. With a direct shot of his right hand, the huge black claws were sent flying!

How is this possible!?

Elephant’s eyes widened in disbelief.

Crackling-

And in the next moment, a lot of lightning appeared on Lin Xiu’s fist, and he attacked with his backhand!

Elephant hadn’t reacted yet, and flew into the air by Lin Xiu’s fist!

There was a lot of lightning on his muscular body in an instant.

Paralyzed, the whole body seemed to be paralyzed.

Looking at the falling body of Elephant, Lin Xiu showed a sneer at the corner of his mouth, and then continued to smash his falling body with his fist!

Boom–

A dull sound sounded, and his body flew into the air again.

Elephant spurted out a mouthful of blood in the air, and he felt that all the bones in his body seemed to be blown apart by Lin Xiu’s punch.

There was no way to move.

“Goodbye!”

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, he attacked the man who fell from the sky again!

Boom–

His body was kicked and he flew out, hitting the wall of lightning behind him.
