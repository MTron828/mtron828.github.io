1239 Strange Little Black Dragon

Sha Qiong’s face changed slightly at this time.

It never occurred to him that Lin Xiu would also have this kind of dark energy.

And this kind of dark energy seems to be fine with his own.

“interesting.”

!!

Sha Qiong snorted coldly and at this moment, the source strength of his body mobilized.

The source strength materialized and all of them turned into dark energy.

Boom——

As he exerted all his strength, these dark energies burst out from his body.

At this time, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly and he clearly felt the strong impact.

At this moment, the entire being was directly bounced away.

He flew out directly and crashed into the huge building in the distance.

“Lin Xiu!”

At this time, Baili Haoling had already rushed to the warriors in Shachang City and was holding the long swords in both hands to fight against those warriors, when she saw Lin Xiu being knocked out.

At this time, Sha Qiong glanced at Baili Haoling’s side. Seeing Baili Haoling’s movements, he snorted coldly.

He raised his right hand and a large amount of dark energy erupted from his body at this moment. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

These dark energies spread to the surroundings in an instant like a black mist.

what is this!?

Baili Haoling, who was killing those warriors, was taken aback.

But the black mist spread very fast. As soon as the spreading black mist touched her body, she felt a particularly uncomfortable feeling inside.

Fortunately, she reacted very quickly just now and had already flown into the sky.

And those warriors in Shachang City were completely covered by the dark energy at this time.

They were still moving at first, but now they stood in place, as if they were frozen.

But Baili Haoling didn’t care so much about this side and looked behind.

Lin Xiu was sent flying out just now and she didn’t know how he was now.

Boom, boom, boom——

And when Baili Haoling looked back, the building behind her began to shake.

The building was quickly trampled down.

And Lin Xiu’s figure flew out of the building very quickly!

Taking a closer look at this moment, there was a little black dragon hovering around Lin Xiu’s body!

This is Lin Xiu’s soul, Black Flame Dragon!

“what is this…”

Sha Qiong also clearly noticed the little black dragon hovering beside Lin Xiu and immediately frowned.

Just now he knew that Lin Xiu was definitely not dead, but he didn’t expect that the moment Lin Xiu rushed out again, there was a little black dragon hovering around his body.

And he clearly felt that this little black dragon carried an extremely huge amount of energy.

He had a sense of crisis.

“No matter what, today, I will definitely kill you.”

Thinking of the death of his three sons at the hands of Lin Xiu, his expression became even gloomier and colder.

He raised his hands and at this moment, the surrounding black mist poured into the bodies of those warriors.

Seeing this scene, Baili Haoling was extremely surprised.

As the black mist poured into their bodies, the bodies of these warriors and their eyes began to gradually become lifeless.

The pupils of the eyes also became completely black and even the pupils could not be seen.

Their bodies also began to slowly become shriveled.

As the bodies of these warriors became shriveled, all the source strength of these warriors’ bodies seemed to be transformed by those dark energies and all of them poured into Sha Qiong’s body.

“Lin Xiu! Be careful!!!”

Seeing Lin Xiu rushing over with a long spear in the back, Baili Haoling shouted loudly.

This Sha Qiong, obviously used this extremely weird method to absorb the life force of those warriors under him and turned it to his own use!

This secret method is really too vicious.

Lin Xiu’s sight was very good. Of course he also saw this scene, but he still didn’t stop.

Holding the spear tightly with both hands, he continued to charge forward!

Lin Xiu’s speed was very fast and he rushed in front of Sha Qiong in the blink of an eye!

“Humph!”

Sha Qiong watched this scene, snorted coldly, waved his right hand and dark shields appeared in front of him in an instant.

Bang bang bang——

Lin Xiu’s spear directly hit the dark shields made of this dark energy, directly stabbing at them.

...

But as soon as the dark shields blocking Sha Qiong’s face exploded, the dark energy surging around his body condensed into sharp spears, shooting towards Lin Xiu all at once.

The spears condensed by these dark energies were so powerful that Lin Xiu dare not resist directly.

With a movement of his body, ‘Flashing Souls’ was released and Lin Xiu dodged directly to the back.

But when he just dodged, he found that these dark spears seemed to have a tracking ability and they continued to stab Lin Xiu in all directions!

‘Sphere’!

Looking at this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes suddenly shrank and all the energy in his body burst out.

Whoosh whoosh——

As the ‘Sphere’ unfolded, all those dark spears pierced Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

Although these dark spears did not directly penetrate Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, they were halfway in.

Looking at the dense dark spears around him, cold sweat dripped down Lin Xiu’s forehead.

This kind of dark energy is really weird, it can actually penetrate his indestructible ‘Sphere’ to this extent.

...

“Just a little more.”

Sha Qiong watched this scene and said to himself in a cold voice.

At this time, his hands were still waving and the life force of the warriors around him had almost been absorbed by him.

One after another, corpses continued to fall on the ground.

“Comfortable…”

Sha Qiong licked his lips, it seemed that because of absorbing this dark energy, he became extremely excited.

Originally, he had a little wrinkle on his face, but now he could clearly see that his skin began to become tighter.

It’s like regaining youth.

And the little black dragon hovering beside Lin Xiu at this time, seeing the dark energy spears pierced in Lin Xiu’s ‘Spheres’, suddenly opened its mouth wide and began to gnaw on those spears!

Lin Xiu was dumbfounded.

This little black dragon will also eat dark energy!?

While Lin Xiu’s eyes were still wide open in disbelief, the black dragon began to gnaw wildly.

It seems that these dark energies are a kind of delicacy to the dragon.

And as it continued to gnaw, it was obvious that its body began to grow bigger at the speed of the naked eye!
