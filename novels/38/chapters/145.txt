Chapter 146: Welcome to Sacred Region Academy

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted when he saw the incoming spear.

He used his left hand to grab onto the spearhead!

The friction between his hand and spear produced even more sparks.

The spear was no longer able to move even an inch!

But right at this moment, Kong Haotian and the others had arrived before Lin Xiu!

Damn it!

Lin Xiu exerted power and pushed the warrior’s spear to the side.

He then proceeded to stab the warrior with Dark Edge in his right hand!

What?!

The warrior was completely stupefied, to actually grab hold of his attacking spear with one hand and then use that black spear to counterattack!

It was too late for him to dodge, he attempted to use his hand to grab Lin Xiu’s spear as well.

But right at that moment, the spear swept past his hand and into his chest!

He looked at Kong Haotian and the others who were about to attack him, Lin Xiu quickly withdrew his spear and swung it backwards!

Adjudicate!!!

The unique characteristic of this skill was that it would counteract incoming momentum. At this time, their weapons seemed to receive a backlash of equal force and they all flew backwards!

Pu-

Kong Hatian’s eyes were wide opened as he spat out a mouthful of blood in midair.

He did not know what skill Lin Xiu had used.

Without a trace!

The instant they landed on the ground, Lin Xiu shot forth with astronomical speed and his legs seemed to be walking on air.

His spear moved as quick as lightning and killed the remaining 3 people!!!

“Whew.” Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief but his eyes were still filled with excitement.

Who would have thought that my strength has increased by so much.

Cultivation technique affected his body’s reaction time, strength, as well as physique greatly.

He was invincible below the rank 4 realm and with Fury activated, he would have the combat capabilities of a rank 4 warrior!

At this time, all those who had placed their sights on Lin Xiu trembled.

The young spearman was too terrifying. He had killed five rank 3 warriors without any hesitation!

Lin Xiu walked on ahead and saw Zhang Yin and the rest standing beside Sima Cheng. None of them had ascended up the airship yet.

What surprised Lin Xiu even more was that Luo Yue was standing there.

When she saw him walk over, her cold expression had no fluctuation as she turned and walked up the stairs.

Lin Xiu did not know whether to laugh or cry at her actions, how lovably arrogant she is…

“You have good strength.” Sima Cheng praised Lin Xiu when he looked at him.

He did not find it wrong that Lin Xiu had killed others. The world was like that, the weak were prey for the strong.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu turned to Zhang Yin and the others.

“Lin Xiu, thank you.” Zhang Yin and the other two looked at him with gratitude.

“Don’t say that, it’s fate for us to know each other.” Lin Xiu chuckled.

To him, the effort for helping them was as easy as raising a hand.

When they boarded the airship, they saw a very large training ground in the middle of the airship.

There were many pieces of equipment around as well.

More and more warriors started to board the airship.

When Sima Cheng boarded the airship, the stairs started to retract.

The airship started to elevate higher. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Alright, congratulations everyone here. All of you have passed the last test and gained the real qualifications to study in Sacred Region Academy.” Sima Cheng stood in the center of the training ground and swept his gaze across the crowd as he smiled and spoke.

There were roughly 400 students, almost two-third had been eliminated.

The warriors became happy when they heard his words.

Some heaved a sigh of relief and sat on the floor.

After all, the route here was one that stretched their minds for a long time. They were finally in a place where they could finally relax.

“From here on out, all of you are students. Under Sacred Region Academy’s rules, you are prohibited from killing other students.” Sima Cheng said.

He looked to be extremely friendly, as though he treated the matter of him punching a warrior to death as nothing.

“We will arrive in about three to four hours. Take this time to have a good rest, who knows, you might not ever have the opportunity again.” Sima Cheng smiled and said.

“What does he mean by that?” Zhang Yin frowned and pondered to himself.

“The windows are all sealed, it seems like they do not wish to let us know where Sacred Region Academy is.” On the other side, Luo Yue looked around and spoke out indifferently.

Lin Xiu nodded when he heard her words. He had realized that as well.

What exactly is Sacred Region Academy? Lin Xiu was extremely looking forward to it.

“Do you know anything about Sacred Region Academy?” Lin Xiu asked Luo Yue.

Anyone could tell that Luo Yue was no ordinary lady. Everyone did not know the route in Path of Death, but she knew where the end of it was.

Luo Yue nodded her head, “On the surface, the four great academies are considered the top educational establishments of the country, but the mysterious Sacred Region Academy is in fact the supreme.

“The strength of the qualified teachers here, the research strength, and all the warriors are top grade here. It is comparable to the world’s strongest academies.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head, this was considered a compliment. All the ‘geniuses’ in the ordinary academies were considered trash and so many had been eliminated.

As for the remaining warriors, no one knew if they would return alive.

“More importantly, it is said that there are rank 9 warriors there.” The expression in Luo Yue’s eyes changed when she said that.

“Rank 9 warrior?!”

That was the peak existence for warriors, every single one of them were considered nuclear warhead existences.

Legends had it that there were even stronger warriors above rank 9. These warriors were capable of destroying planets in an instant and were existences even scarier than antimatter warheads.

But that was just hearsay and only appeared in movies.

The strongest in reality that everyone knew about were rank 9 warriors.

Rumble rumble-

At this time, loud noises could be heard from outside. Everyone could clearly feel that the airship was lowering down.

Bang-

The doors of the airship opened and the stairs pulled out. A blinding light permeated into the airship from the entrance.

“I hereby welcome everyone to…. Sacred Region Academy.”
