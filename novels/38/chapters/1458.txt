1459 Working Together to Kill the God Kings

Then, the dark energy then rushed into his body.

The entire body of the God King was instantly filled with dark energy.

These dark energies were slowly rotting away his physical body and at the same time, even his divine spirit was also locked into his body. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

It was impossible for his divine energy to leave his body!

Swoosh – –

Then, Luo Yue pulled out the sword from his chest and swiped it across his body.

Boom – –

There was a soft groan that followed and the God King’s body was split into two halves.

This time, his physical body as well as his divine spirit were both completely destroyed.

He finally died.

Boom boom boom – –

Lin Xiu was still busy fighting the God King from before with his long spear.

As Lin Xiu’s spear collided with the God King’s warhammer, there were loud explosions that followed one after another.

The black dragon even tried to bite onto the God King’s divine spirit but the God King managed to dodge them all.

The God King’s body might be enormous but he had a certain special skill that allowed him to dodge every attack launched at him.

He then swung his warhammer at Lin Xiu.

However, Lin Xiu once again blocked the attack from his warhammer.

Both weapons collided with each other once again and the entire place shook.

“The Godly Explosive Air Strike!!!”

The God King roared and transferred all of his source energy into his warhammer!

With one final blow, the entire sky was covered with a huge warhammer!

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrunk uncontrollably when he saw what had happened.

Then, he quickly released his ‘sphere’.

Boom – –

His body was covered by the ‘sphere’ and Lin Xiu was thrown far into the distance from the impact of the attack.

The strength of it was overpowering but it did not bring any damage to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu quickly caught his balance.

“Dead?”

When he looked over at Luo Yue, he could see that the God King that Luo Yue was fighting with had gone missing.

It was obvious that Luo Yue had managed to kill him.

“En.”

Luo Yue then went to Lin Xiu’s side.

Both of them then stared at the God King that held the warhammer.

At the same time, the black dragon divine spirit disappeared as well.

Overall, it was only useful in defeating the other party’s divine spirit.

When it came to other close combat, it wasn’t a powerful skill.

Plus, using it requires a large amount of energy.

“It’s the last one. Let’s kill him together.”

Lin Xiu then looked at Luo Yue.

Luo Yue gently nodded her head.

“All of you….must die!!!!”

The man with the warhammer was enraged when he saw both Lin Xiu and Luo Yue unharmed.

Then, he swung the warhammer once again!

However, at the same time, Lin Xiu then released a large number of arrays in between them and formed a huge shield.

Boom – –

The warhammer landed on the arrays and there was a loud sound heard.

The arrays shattered.

However, this had helped Lin Xiu block another attack.

The tip of Lin Xiu’s spear was now covered with Flames of Chaos.

Luo Yue’s sword was also covered with Black Waters.

They looked at each other before attacking the God King ahead of them!

Die!

Lin Xiu’s long spear then gathered together and formed a huge golden dragon!

The dragon was then released by the tip of the sphere!

The Black Waters around Luo Yue’s sword was released at the same time and they formed a huge black water dragon!

Both of them had released their skills simultaneously.

Both dragons then intertwined with each other.

As they spinned in the air, they headed straight for the God King!

“No one will be able to kill me!!!”

The God King with the warhammer roared when he saw the dragons!

He released his ‘sphere’ at the same time and there was a large amount of blue energy that came out of his mouth.

All of them came out at the same time.

Then, there was a huge blue energy pillar formed in between them!

The huge pillar then collided with the dragons that were intertwined with each other.

Boom – –

There was a loud explosion that followed.

However, the twin dragon blasted through the pillar and went directly after the God King!

That’s impossible!

The God King’s eyes were opened wide as he couldn’t believe his eyes.

Boom – –

Then, the twin dragons hit directly on his ‘sphere’. The ground beneath their feet shook violently.

The area where he stood formed a dent.

His ‘sphere’ had exploded as well!

Then, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue dashed forward instantly.

Xiu xiu – –

Luo Yue then aimed her sword at the man’s chest.

As for Lin Xiu, he grabbed his spear and aimed for his head!

Then, there were two huge bloody holes that appeared on his body.

“I will never die…”

Although there was a huge hole on his head, he was still able to talk.

Boom – –

Then, his body fell to the ground and there was a faint blue energy that flew out of his body.

Lin Xiu quickly caught it with his array and trapped the blue energy inside it as soon as he noticed it.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

Lin Xiu quickly flew over and asked the energy that was trapped inside the array.

When he took a close look, the blue energy then looked at the face of the God King that had just died.

“Let me out!”

The God King was hitting on all four walls of the array.

However, as his body was now merely a form of energy, it was impossible for him to do so.

Lin Xiu then reached inside the array and crushed the remains of the divine energy.

“Nooooo!!!!!”

The God King gave one last final cry.

Then, his divine energy was engulfed by Lin Xiu!

‘Engulf!’

As Lin Xiu absorbed the man’s divine energy, Lin Xiu then noticed that his progress bar had reached 95%!

He was only 5% away from reaching another level!

Lin Xiu got excited upon seeing that.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue then flew back to the ground.

Lin Xiu then removed all of the arrays that were protecting Luo Huatian.

“All of them are….dead?”

Luo Huatian was still in awe.

All four God Kings are killed!
