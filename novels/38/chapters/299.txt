Chapter 300: Ambush In The Night

“Tell me! Was it a girl that was using this sword?” Lin Xiu looked at him and asked.

He looked at the sword, if he was not wrong, it was Luo Yue’s!

“How do you know?” The man was surprised when he heard Lin Xiu’s statement.

He didn’t say anything, how did Lin Xiu guess it?

“Tell me, where did she go?” Lin Xiu held onto his clothes and asked.

He was right, Luo Yue was here and the sword was definitely hers.

‘But what exactly happened? Why did she drop the sword that was inseparable from her?’

‘But since there’s no sign of her, she isn’t dead.’

“I… I don’t know.” The man looked at Lin Xiu’s terrifying glare and started trembling in fear.

For some reason, although Lin Xiu’s rank was not high, he gave off a terrifying feeling.

“Don’t know?” Lin Xiu heard his reply and frowned.

“I saw her fighting while carrying that sword, and then we left.” The man continued to explain himself.

He spoke the truth, it was too dangerous that day and they could not stay long and left soon after.

Lin Xiu scrutinized him carefully and realized he was not lying.

Lin Xiu let go of his clothes and regained his calm. He took Dark Edge and walked the other way without looking back.

The warriors watched him leave.

“Boss, we’re just letting him go?” One of them asked the leader who made the deal with Lin Xiu.

The leader watched Lin Xiu’s back, it was painful losing a rank 7 odd crystal.

“Forget it, don’t provoke him.” After thinking about it, he sighed and relented.

For some reason, he had a faint sense that Lin Xiu’s strength was not what it looked like.

Otherwise, he would have ordered them to kill Lin Xiu instead of asking for a deal.

“Quick! Let’s get this bull back!”

“Got it!”

At the same time, Lin Xiu continued to move ahead.

Lin Xiu followed the footprints on the ground and continued ahead.

He would look around occasionally as he moved.

Dark Forest was extremely large and everywhere he turned looked the same.

The only difference that he could spot were the white bones that appeared more frequently.

They were most probably bones from corpses that were devoured. Lin Xiu guessed that the aged bones came from a long time ago.

His surroundings became extremely quiet to the point that it was slightly scary.

Lin Xiu moved cautiously and continued walking for a long time. He did not spot anyone else or discover any living warriors.

“Guess I’ll rest here tonight.” The sky quickly turned dark.

Lin Xiu arrived on a field that had plenty of rocks. He leaned on a black rock and prepared to rest for the night.

Lin Xiu had walked according to the footprints on the ground.

But at this point, all the footprints had mysteriously vanished.

‘Where did they go?’ Lin Xiu was confused.

Feeling a bit of headache, he took out some nourishing liquid and poured it down his throat. He sat on the ground and started to rest.

“Gu?” Rollie seemed to have stayed inside the bag for too long and felt bored. It crawled out of the bag and hugged an odd crystal to nibble while on Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

“This should be brimming with energy.” Lin Xiu looked at Rollie and smiled, then proceeded to take out the rank 7 odd crystal.

It was night but the fiery red rank 7 odd crystal emitted a light that resembled flames. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Whew.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and sat down cross-legged. He placed the rank 7 odd crystal in his hand and activated cultivation technique to absorb the energy into his body.

The energy was of a fire attribute.

Odd crystals that were of fire attributes were extremely effective for him.

After all, he had absorbed the Red Lotus Fire and utilized many fire skills, so he felt much more familiar with such odd crystals.

Boundless energy flowed throughout his body as he continued to absorb.

Although the surrounding air was cold, Lin Xiu was able to feel warm while absorbing the flame energy inside the odd crystal.

Time quickly passed.

Lin Xiu had his back against the rock as he sat down and cultivated, absorbing the energy from the rank 7 odd crystal.

The energy within was endless and even after absorbing for a long time, he had barely absorbed 10% of the energy.

At the same time, a black figure gradually appeared near Lin Xiu.

Sou-

A cold gleam of light flickered in the darkness and the figure charged towards him!

An explosion suddenly occurred in the air.

Lin Xiu had his eyes shut and focused on cultivating when he sensed something and opened his eyes.

He immediately saw the cold gleam of light before him!

Bang-

Lin Xiu’s expression changed as he dodged the attack instinctively.

Bang-

A sword brimming with a cold aura pierced into the rock behind him and produced a loud explosion.

A few strands of Lin Xiu’s hair fell to the ground.

Lin Xiu’s heart jumped a beat when he saw that he was almost killed by the sword!
