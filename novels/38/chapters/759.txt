Chapter 760: Solution

“I’m fine.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

The next moment, An Qi and Qian Lin discovered that Lin Xiu’s wound seemed to be healing at a speed visible to the naked eye!

Seeing this scene, An Qi and Qian Lin couldn’t help but widen their eyes.

What a terrifying healing ability!

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t pay attention to their expressions.

Lin Xiu looked at Liu Pan.

“Go to hell! Die!”

Liu Pan was still holding the double-sided axe in his hand, swinging wildly.

Dang dang-

The double-sided axe in his hand collided with the ‘Hunter”s machete, making one metal collision sound after another.

And every time he swings the double-sided axe in his hand, blood splashes out from his double-sided axe.

All the bloodshed from his own body had flowed to the axe.

This double-sided axe that was originally silver turned into a blood-red axe at this moment.

It looks very scary.

The ‘hunter’ also had a look of disbelief on his face at this time.

Just holding the weapon in his hand to resist Liu Pan’s attack, he felt his hand going numb.

But why, this dead fat man clearly has a lot of wounds and blood was constantly flowing out, not only did he seem fine, but his fighting power became stronger and stronger!

This feeling was really too weird, too terrible!

“‘Sinking Sea strike’!!!”

He finally couldn’t bear it any longer. At this moment, he held the machete tightly in both hands and waved it violently!

This blow was like a slash splitting the sea!

Liu Pan, who was attacking with a double-sided axe, collided with him and his whole being was like a kite with a broken string and in the next moment, he flew out!

boom–

The whole person slammed into the trees behind him heavily.

And then fell into the bushes.

And this ‘hunter’ was also panting at this time.

“Shit... Damn…”

While panting, he cursed inwardly.

This fat man, the more he fights, the stronger he seemed to become. When he was just fighting with him, he almost thought that Liu Pan had reached the level of a master warrior.

Moreover, his eyes turned out to be crimson red, very strange.

But just as he heaved a sigh of relief, Liu Pan, who had fallen over there, began to slowly stand up from the bushes over there.

This ‘hunter’ look suddenly became nasty.

How can it be!

He’s fine!?

This damn fat man didn’t die!?

Taking a closer look, there was blood flowing down Liu Pan’s head. It is no exaggeration to say that Liu Pan is now like a bloody person.

“Lin Xiu, do you want to... go and help him...”

At this time, An Qi and Qian Lin turned their eyes to the front and they found it a little unbearable to watch this scene.

Because the current Liu Pan’s condition was really bad, there was a lot of blood on his body.

In this situation, let’s not talk about fighting. If you don’t treat the wound properly, it is very likely that he will die due to the loss of blood!

“Hold on.”

Lin Xiu was silent for a while, then said aloud.

Because of his parents, this fat man obviously wanted to kill these ‘hunters’ himself.

Moreover, Lin Xiu could still feel that although Liu Pan has a lot of blood all over his body now, his vital signs were still very strong.

He should be fine.

“You!”

The ‘hunter’ looked at Fat Liu as he stood up again like a cockroach who can’t be killed and the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

“You will die for me!!!”

He held the machete in his hand, then waved it wildly in the air.

One after another, the full moon sword aura continued to attack!

bang bang bang-

At this time, Liu Pan frantically waved the double-sided axe in his hand, but he even resisted all these full moon sword aura.

While resisting it, he rushed forward frantically!

The whole person doesn’t seem to feel any pain.

“What!!!”

The ‘hunter’ also let out a roar at this time and now he was completely driven a little crazy by Liu Pan.

At this time, he also held the machete in his hand and rushed towards the front frantically!

If he didn’t kill Liu Pan again, he felt that his life was in danger.

Dang dang-

The two rushed towards each other at the same time and the moment they rushed over, their weapons collided.

Under the collision of the weapons, a lot of sparks erupted.

“Die!!!”

The ‘hunter’ roared and when resisting Liu Pan’s blow, the machete in his hand slashed directly at Liu Pan’s body!

boom– Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

With this hack, he had predicted that Liu Pan would dodge, then continued to attack.

But what he didn’t expect was that Liu Pan didn’t dodge at all and let the slash directly hit him on the shoulder.

Liu Pan’s body looked fat, but when his knife slashed at Fat Liu’s body, he felt that his blade could not cut down directly, but was stuck on his body.

How can that be!!!

His eyes widened and Liu Pan had already revealed a wicked smile.

boom–

Because at the moment when Liu Pan chopped over, the double-sided axe in his hand also chopped over, directly hitting his neck.

The head of this ‘hunter’ was cut off directly.

And his eyes were still wide open and he still maintained that shocked expression.

“Dead...hahaha…”

Liu Pan laughed loudly and at the next moment, his eyes darkened and he fell to the ground.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu quickly walked up.

And An Qi and Qian Lin followed.

“Bring out your restoration fluid.”

Lin Xiu looked at Liu Pan who was lying on the ground and immediately said to An Qi and Qian Lin behind him.

The two nodded, then quickly took out the medicinal liquid used to repair the wound, as well as other medical items.

“Eh?”

But at this moment, Lin Xiu discovered something strange.

So many stab wounds on the dead fat man’s body, at this time, they started to heal.

The blood didn’t flow out anymore.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu was in disbelief.

Lin Xiu’s healing speed was so fast because he unlocked the gene lock and the inner body of his body had changed a lot.

But this Liu Pan’s body was unusual too.

Could it be because of the characteristics of his ethnic group?

Without thinking too much, Lin Xiu directly pulled out the machete that the hunter had just slashed at Fatty.

He took the restoration fluid and poured them on Fatty’s wound.

“What!!!”

At this time, the fat man, who had passed out in a coma, suddenly opened his eyes wide and let out a painful roar.
