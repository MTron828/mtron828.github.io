Chapter 107: Cooperation

His five fingers were like tofu and went through the man’s chest very easily as he grabbed a bright red heart out.

In the next second, Lin Xiu used force and crushed the heart directly.

Those Black Tiger Bandits were suddenly surprised, and at this instant, Lin Xiu got into the God mode. In the next moment, with those short knife and cold blade, they stabbed directly towards the body of Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu raised his brows and his body moved slightly, and he directly dodged the attack.

The middle-aged man at the back became increasingly frightened as he looked at the scene. ‘The strength of this teenager is too scary, huh?’

Not only was he skilled, but he could react so quickly. He merely had to twist his body slightly and the Black Tiger Bandits’ weapons would miss his body, they had no way of attacking him!

Click click——

Lin Xiu saw a cold blade in the Black Tiger Bandit’s hand coming over and he accurately grabbed hold of his wrist and pinched it like a fright dough twist. The sound of bones cracking rang out, and it made one’s hair stand on its ends.

In a short period of time, Lin Xiu had killed the five Black Tiger Bandits on this side! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He gained 100,000 experience points for every rank 2 warrior and had already gained 500,000 experience points in total!

At this point, the experience points in his stats board had become:

Experience: 2,639,635 (2,700,000 experience points required for the next level)

He still needed more than two million experience points, and as long as he killed a few more warriors, his strength should improve very quickly.

Bang——

The train halted to a stop all of a sudden with an emergency brake and the huge impact caused Lin Xiu and the middle-aged men to be thrown back.

“Damn, why did it suddenly stop…” The middle-aged man gritted his teeth.

Lin Xiu steadied himself and wanted to go to the front to investigate.

But at this moment, the train began moving again and security personnel in the train were walking in their direction. They were holding a special laser gun and when they saw the situation at Lin Xiu’s side, they directly aimed the laser gun toward Lin Xiu, then slowly walked over.

“We’re passengers and those Black Tiger Bandits have been killed by this young man here.” The middle-aged man explained as he approached the security personnel who were holding laser guns.

Lin Xiu wasn’t afraid when he saw them pointing the laser guns at him. His combat suit could protect him from laser guns as well and it could be said that the laser guns in their hands couldn’t break his defense at all.

“Show me your ticket.” A security personnel said to Lin Xiu and the middle-aged man.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and simply pulled out the ticket from his pocket, and so did the middle-aged man.

After inspecting their tickets, the security personnel put their guns down.

“I’m sorry, the Black Tiger Bandits snuck into the train and we’re very sorry for the inconvenience caused.” The security chief said apologetically.

“You should say that to the dead passengers.” The middle-aged man snorted coldly.

The moment he said that, those security personnel looked very embarrassed.

“What about the front? Are the Black Tiger Bandits dead?” Lin Xiu asked them.

If not, he would rush over immediately and kill them all!

It was all for the experience points!

“The captain of the train was almost brought under their control, so the train came to a halt, but there’s no problem now, they’ve all jumped out of the train and fled.” The security chief laughed bitterly.

Those Black Tiger Bandits killed a lot of people and robbed a lot of things, this could be said to be a class-A train accident and they were definitely responsible for it, they would be punished for sure.

“Forget it.” Lin Xiu shook his head and returned to his carriage.

By this time, the security personnel had begun to clean up the dead bodies of all those people.

“Bro, are you on your way to the Path of Death?” Just as Lin Xiu sat on the chair in his carriage, that middle-aged man walked over and stood by the carriage door.

“What do you think?” Lin Xiu said indifferently.

“Hehe.” The middle-aged man rubbed the back of his head a little awkwardly and said.

“Let’s get to know each other, my name is Tian Zhi and I’m heading to the Path of death as well, I think we can work together.” Tian Zhi looked at Lin Xiu and said.

Lin Xiu’s aura felt only like that of a rank 1 warrior, but judging from Lin Xiu’s skills, it was clear that he was very strong, he might have the strength of a rank 3 warrior!

Lin Xiu was so strong that he had the impulse to rope him in to his side. After all, the Path of Death wasn’t an easy place.

It was a place where you could die at any time!

“What do you have to offer?” Lin Xiu said with great interest at this moment.

Lin Xiu did not need to use the Analytic Eye and just by his senses, he could detect that the strength of this middle-aged man was only at the level of a rank 2 warrior.

At this age, with such slow progress, he would probably reach the level of a rank 3 warrior at best.

If he went to the Path of Death with his strength, there was a high risk of him dying.

“I have brains.” The man pointed to his head at the moment and said.

“I went to the Path of Death with a team of adventurers three years ago, and I know a lot about the first half of the journey in the Path of Death. With me around, you can avoid a lot of hidden dangers,” said the middle-aged man.

Lin Xiu looked into his eyes and they were sincere, he didn’t look like he was lying.

“You’re going to the Path of Death for the first time, aren’t you?” He asked as both of them were sizing each other up.

Lin Xiu did not answer his question, he didn’t affirm or deny.

“There are several forks in the Path of death from the beginning and it can lead people to their deaths. Without someone giving you directions, it would be hard to navigate.” The middle-aged man continued.

Lin Xiu thought of the information he had read before and the man was right. The Path of death had a lot of terror zones from the start, with hallucinogenic plants, as well as confusing terrain, some people just walked in and got lost, never coming out again until death.

“We can work together but what about you? Why are you going to the Path of Death?” Lin Xiu asked with a smile.

The middle-aged man was taken aback and thought that this teenager was simply too wily.

He had no choice and smiled bitterly, “I’m going to the Path of Death to look for a plant, but there might be a powerful evolved beasts over there, and I was wondering if you could lend me a helping hand.”
