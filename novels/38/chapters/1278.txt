Lin Xiu just turned the corner and looked over there, but found that there was no one in the corridor over there.

The unusually suppressive feeling disappeared in an instant.

Where is he!?

“Hu.”

Lei Tong, who was extremely uncomfortable at first, couldn’t help but heaved a sigh of relief at this time.

Wiping the blood from his lips, he took a deep breath.

“Gone?”

Baili Haoling also frowned at this time.

The warrior who just released such a powerful force was obviously on this side, but now there was no one there.

And at this time, with the triggering of Baili Haoling’s mind, she couldn’t perceive anyone’s existence.

It’s really strange.

“This person should be right here.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly, looked at the corridor, and said.

The corridor here was very long and there were also many rooms on the left and right sides.

“Forget it, let’s go back to the room first.”

Lin Xiu also released his power to perceive everything around him.

But there was still no way to perceive who released the power.

“Ok.”

Baili Haoling nodded slightly.

Lei Tong looked around and finally heaved a sigh of relief.

The feeling just now was really terrifying.

“If you need anything, call me.”

After opening his door, Lin Xiu said to Lei Tong.

The force just now was obviously aimed at Lei Tong.

It’s probably because Lei Tong was a warrior of the Sage warrior level, that’s why it happened.

“Ok.”

Lei Tong nodded seriously.

Lin Xiu lived in the middle room, while Lei Tong and Baili Haoling stayed in the other rooms.

If something happens, Lin Xiu can take care of it.

After all, judging from just now, it seems that the warriors in the City of God were not very friendly to them…

After entering the room, Lin Xiu lay directly on the bed.

“Comfortable.”

The bed was very soft, which made Lin Xiu feel comfortable.

Rollie and Xiaobai jumped onto the bed and the two evolved beasts started to fight at this time.

Lin Xiu closed his eyes and let his whole body relax.

The source strength here was very strong. With Lin Xiu’s ‘Cultivation Technique’ automatically operating at this time, a large amount of source strength was continuously pouring into Lin Xiu’s body.

Comfortable, really comfortable.

If you cultivated in this God Realm, you may be able to more than double your cultivation speed.

This was only in the area not far from the city of God. The God King Palace in the city of God probably has extremely strong energy.

“Cultivation in this kind of place is of course much faster than ordinary places…”

At this moment, Lin Xiu couldn’t help feeling excited.

After a short rest, around evening, Lin Xiu stretched and stood up.

Looking at the time, it was now around six o’clock in the evening.

It was getting dark.

Standing by the window and looking outside, the city below can be seen between the clouds and mist and it has become extremely beautiful.

It’s like a city that never sleeps.

“Time to head out and have a look…”

Lin Xiu said aloud to himself.

The city of God was very large and there should be many specialized warrior malls.

He could go and see if there were any suitable skill cards.

Squeak——

After Lin Xiu opened the door of the room, he saw that Baili Haoling and Lei Tong were already sitting on the chairs in the corridor.

“What are you guys doing?”

Lin Xiu was taken aback when he saw this scene and subconsciously said.

...

“didn’t you hear just now, someone was knocking on the door?”

At this time, Baili Haoling showed a strange expression and said.

“Someone knocked on the door?” Lin Xiu was taken aback.

“no…”

Although Lin Xiu has been resting just now, if someone really knocked on the door, then he will definitely hear it.

But obviously, Lin Xiu didn’t hear anything just now.

“I heard it too.” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

When Lei Tong said this, he had goosebumps.

When he heard the knock on the door just now, he opened the door and looked outside, but he didn’t find anyone at all.

“Someone must have knocked on the wrong door…”

Lin Xiu said thoughtfully.

...

“It shouldn’t be possible. I feel like someone did it on purpose.”

Baili Haoling shook his head, then said seriously.

“Knock on the door, who would be so lame…”

Lin Xiu said to himself.

But thinking about it, Lin Xiu frowned slightly.

Because when he came here today, there were powerful warriors here who exuded hostility.

it doesn’t seem too safe here.

“Don’t think so much, let’s go out and have a look first.”

Lin Xiu laughed.

Soon, the three of them left.

As soon as he walked down the lobby on the first floor of the hotel, he could see the dazzling lights all around him.

“They have quite a nightlife ah…”

Lei Tong looked at everything around him and couldn’t help saying aloud.

In the spacious lobby of the hotel, one could clearly see many warriors going back and forth.

The street outside seems to be more lively.

“Let’s go, go out and have a look.”

Baili Haoling also became interested.

Walking out on the street outside, the entire street was crowded with people and both the ground and the surrounding buildings were emitting light.

Making the whole city look like daytime.

“So many warriors…”

And Lei Tong’s attention was more focused on those warriors who were walking around.

Because he now clearly felt that the strength of those warriors around him was obviously too high.

It seems that every warrior was stronger than him.

The pressure emitted by that powerful warrior made Lei Tong feel so uncomfortable that he found it hard to breathe.

“Don’t think too much, it will be a matter of time before you become a God warrior.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu said lightly.

“En.”

Lei Tong nodded, trying his best to calm down at this moment.

“Let’s go over there and have a look.”

At this time, Lin Xiu looked to the front and saw a huge building.

There was white light emitting from the surroundings of this building and the two words “Warrior Mall” were inscribed on it.

As soon as the three of them walked up the stairs of the building, they saw many warriors coming in and out.

“Welcome to Warrior Mall.”

As the three of them were about to enter the gate, the attendants on both sides spoke out respectfully.

“Even the attendants are Sage warriors…”

At this moment, Lei Tong felt that he had been hit even more.

“Hey, there are quite a lot of things for sale…”

As soon as they walked in, Baili Haoling’s eyes lit up.

Because in this warrior shop, there were a lot of things that werebeing sold.

What is in front of them now were all kinds of battle suits.

And if you take a closer look, these uniforms were not ordinary uniforms, they were all made of very good materials.

Lin Xiu was also surprised.

The items sold in the warrior store in City of God exceeded his imagination!
