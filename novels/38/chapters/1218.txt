1219 Tianling Kingdom

Liu Qinglan and Sha Lin stood in the same place at this time, completely shocked.

To kill so many warriors in an instant, even they can’t do it!

“I haven’t had enough fun yet and it’s over.”

At this time, Baili Haoling said with a pity.

Just now, she thought that person could have some strength, but she didn’t expect that he was so weak, which made Baili Haoling, who had finally met a warrior using two swords and wanted to learn from each other, very depressed.

Haven’t had enough fun yet…

When Sha Lin and Liu Qinglan heard Baili Haoling’s words, their expressions changed.

“Okay, next, you guys have something to do, right?”

At this time, Lin Xiu looked at Sha Lin and Liu Qinglan.

When the two of them looked at Lin Xiu and their bodies could not help but tremble.

Thinking of those lotus fires that Lin Xiu released just now, their hairs stood on ends.

“I don’t want the inheritance of Bai Lingxian anymore.”

Liu Qinglan weighed it and looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“But the ore vein should be in the care of the higher-level cities of Lingxian City.”

Although Bai Lingxian’s inheritance of divine marks was very tempting, Lin Xiu wouldn’t give it up so easily.

And he didn’t have any good reason to force Lin Xiu to hand it over.

But this ore vein, he must get it.

Tianlan Pavilion was not just a small force entrenched in Lingxian City, behind it, there were even more powerful forces.

Therefore, when Tianlan Pavilion was there before, they did not dare to come directly to seize the mines here.

But Lin Xiu is a god warrior who just came from another plane.

He has no background in the God warrior Realm

“As the city lord of Lingxian City, you may not know some things, but you only need to cooperate with your superior city.”

“This is the rule of the Tianling Kingdom.”

Seeing that Lin Xiu didn’t speak, Liu Qinglan immediately felt relieved, thinking that Lin Xiu finally understood.

“What is Tianling Kingdom?”

Only at this moment, Lin Xiu turned to look at Mr. Pang behind him.

“City Lord, we belong to Lingzhou, one of the nine continents in the God warrior Realm. Tianling Kingdom is a big country in Lingzhou. Our Lingxian City belongs to Tianling Kingdom.”

Mr. Pang said with a bit of shame.

He had given Lin Xiu some information about the God warrior Realm before, but Lin Xiu had been immersed in his cultivation recently and had not read any information in this regard.

“Oh I see.”

After listening to Mr. Pang’s words, Lin Xiu showed a look of sudden realization.

“Now you know?”

Liu Qinglan also said proudly at this time.

It seemed that he had fooled Lin Xiu.

“Well, you guys can get out now.”

Lin Xiu nodded, then said.

Liu Qinglan, who was showing a smug smile, thought that Lin Xiu would obey and his face suddenly sank.

“Do you know who you just killed?”

At this time, Sha Lin let out a sneer.

“The one you killed just now was the youngest son of the city owner of Haiwang City.”

“Although your strength is quite good, after the city lord of Haiwang City knows about this, not only will you die, but even your entire Lingxian city will be destroyed.”

“I advise you to flee from here quickly.”

Hearing Sha Lin’s words, Lin Xiu didn’t feel anything.

How many times has he gone through life and death, trying to scare him off just by making some verbal threats? What a joke.

“You also want ore vein, don’t you?”

Lin Xiu did not directly answer his words.

“This thing, your Lingxian City can’t mine it.”

Shalin didn’t say it clearly, but the meaning behind his words was very obvious.

“Then go get it.”

Lin Xiu waved his hand.

So simple?

Liu Qinglan and Sha Lin, who originally thought that Lin Xiu would do something, were really stunned at this time.

According to how Lin Xiu acted just now, this should not be the reaction now…

“Glad you know what’s good for you.”

However, Liu Qinglan thought that Lin Xiu was really scared. At this time, he laughed out loud and was about to lead his subordinates to the mine.

“If you guys can leave alive.”

Just when he was about to leave, Lin Xiu continued to add.

As soon as the words fell, with a flash of light, the Dark Edge spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

swoosh—

The spear stabbed out and took Liu Qinglan’s head straight!

The pupils in Liu Qinglan’s eyes shrank slightly and his body instantly disappeared in place.

And the attack that Lin Xiu had just shot didn’t hit anything!

“Hm?”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu immediately raised his brows. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

At that moment, this Liu Qinglan seemed to have used a special movement technique to dodge his attack.

“Damn low-level pariah, dare to attack me!”

In a blink of an eye, Liu Qinglan’s figure appeared above the city gate on the other side. He stared at Lin Xiu grimly, looking a little out of breath.

It seems that Lin Xiu’s blow just now still left him with lingering fears.

“Today, you all stay here.”

Although he didn’t know what movement technique Liu Qinglan used to dodge his attack, Lin Xiu also has killing intent.

Regardless of the backing they had, Lin Xiu wanted to kill them first.

Even if these people wouldn’t give him much experience, they’re better than nothing.

It’s always better than nothing.

As Lin Xiu finished speaking, a black source mark suddenly appeared on Lin Xiu’s forehead.

Whoosh whoosh—

With the use of Lin Xiu’s source mark power, a large number of matrices surrounded the surrounding into a special space.

what is this!?

Sha Lin, Liu Qinglan and other warriors watched this scene with horror in their eyes.

They have never seen such a strange ability.

“Shalin, this kid not only killed the people of Haiwang City, but now it seems that he wants to get rid of us all.”

The expression in Liu Qinglan’s eyes changed.

At this time, he looked at Shalin.

“Now, if we don’t kill him, we will die!”

Shalin’s face turned cold.

He also did not expect that things would develop to this point.

Originally, he came to divide the ‘cake’, but didn’t expect that not only was the ‘cake’ not divided, but it turned into this.

“I won’t be killed by this kid.”

While Sha Lin was talking, he and Liu Qinglan looked at each other, as if they had reached some kind of consensus.

“kill him!!!”

The next moment, the two shouted in unison.

As soon as their words fell, those warriors who had already surrounded Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling suddenly attacked Lin Xiu!

“Mr. Pang, go in first.”

At this time, Lin Xiu slapped his right hand and threw Mr. Pang into the mansion and the Dark edge spear in his hand swept out!

“Just the right time!”

And Baili Haoling looked at these warriors attacking, not only was she fearless, she became excited.
