Chapter 478: Horrifying Zombie

The flood, along with a large number of zombies, all rushed in from this school gate!

Those students and teachers on the rooftop couldn’t help but widen their eyes when they saw this terrifying scene.

“This is too scary…” a man said with a trembling body.

“Shuang’er, what should we do now?” A young girl asked while grabbing Ye Shuang’er’s arm.

“Don’t be afraid, there will be an aircraft coming to pick us up later.” Ye Shuang’er patted her arm and said.

The girl nodded, but looking at the zombies rushing in from a distance below, she still felt terrified.

There were simply too many zombies – the number made everyone have goosebumps.

Those zombies seemed to know that they were gathered on the rooftop of the highest building in this college, and at this time they rushed over wildly.

“Damn it!” Teacher Zhang’s expression changed suddenly when he looked at the scene below.

These terrifying zombies seemed to be a little bit sane, and they knew that they were all there.

At this speed, it wouldn’t take long for these zombies to rush up.

“Teacher Zhang! Why hasn’t anyone come to pick us up yet!” When some students saw this scene, their expressions changed drastically, and their faces were full of horror.

They were just ordinary entry-level warriors, it was rare to even have a rank 1 warrior around. If those horrifying zombies rush up, they would be dead!

“They’re coming up, they’re coming up!”

The speed of these zombies was shocking and looking down, everyone could see a large number of zombies reaching the bottom of this building!

“Teacher Zhang! Teacher Zhang!”

These students have now regarded Teacher Zhang, who was on the top of the building here, as a life-saving straw. At this time, they all looked over.

“I’ve already contacted them, they’ll be here soon, be patient.” Teacher Zhang also broke out in cold sweat at this time, but still comforted these nervous students.

“Zhang Ke, Luo Zhi, hurry up, move those stones here first and block the gate!”

The men nodded quickly at this time, and then moved the stones on the roof to the gate.

Soon, the gate was blocked.

But… would this even help?

“These zombies…Why are they still climbing up!?” Some students exclaimed while they looked at the zombies climbing up directly.

They were like countless geckos, all climbing up.

This made them even more fearful.

“We’re doomed, we’re doomed.” Teacher Zhang appeared to have lost all his strength and nearly fell to the ground when he saw this scene.

Those students were even more frightened and some of the girls cried.

Boom boom——

But at this very moment, a black shadow flew over in the sky.

“Space…the spacecraft is coming!”

Teacher Zhang immediately looked up. As expected, there was a long spacecraft in the sky, flying towards them.

This rooftop was very spacious and because some students have already fled this place, their current location was very empty.

These students quickly backed away at this time, leaving a place for the spacecraft to stop.

Soon, as the spacecraft stopped and landed, the door of the spacecraft opened.

“Hurry up!” Teacher Zhang shouted.

Because he saw that these zombies were already climbing up!

And there were crashing noises from the door here, it was clear that the rest of the zombies had barged in from this passageway!

Although this door was strong, it wouldn’t last long under the crazy ramming of those zombies.

As soon as the door of the spacecraft opened, the students rushed in frantically!

“Shuang’er! Let’s go, hurry up!” When the girl next to Ye Shuang’er wanted to run onto the spacecraft with Ye Shuang’er, she was violently pulled to the back by the people behind.

She fell directly to the ground.

“Dong’er!” Ye Shuang’er saw this scene, the expression in her eyes changed, and when she turned around, she saw that her classmate was trampled on the ground by other students.

In such a situation, a stampede like that would happen once you fall. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Ye Shuang’er, hurry up!” A man suddenly called out when he saw Ye Shuang’er squeezed toward the back.

Ye Shuang’er ignored his words and continued to walk to the front.

Very quickly, she picked up her classmate from the ground.

“Are you okay?” Ye Shuang’er asked, seeing her clothes dirty and she had bruises all over her face.

“I’m okay…” The girl shook her head. After all, she was a warrior. If she were an ordinary person, she would be trampled to death if she had just been stepped on so many times.

“Who pulled you back?” Ye Shuang’er’s expression became a little nasty at this time.

People who did this kind of thing at this time are really disgusting!

“The zombies are coming!” At this moment, someone shouted.

Ye Shuang’er turned and saw that a large number of zombies was climbing up on the edge at the back!

Several students were directly caught by the zombies and bitten into a few pieces.

Ye Shuang’er trembled at this bloody scene.

Terrifying, it’s really terrifying.

“Hurry up and close the door!” A man stood in the spacecraft and yelled in fear.

“But there are still people who haven’t come up…” Although some other students were scared, they still pointed out.

“Those rubbish, who cares, hurry up!” the man shouted.

At this time, a large number of zombies were about to run up to them. At this critical moment, several federal soldiers in camouflage uniforms on the spacecraft rushed out with laser guns!

Swish swish swish——

As they pulled the trigger, a large number of laser beams shot out!

Several zombies were pierced through their heads by laser rays and died instantly but those zombies that were not pierced through their foreheads were still fine and they rushed over crazily!

Ye Shuang’er helped the girl up and wanted to run to the spacecraft, but at this moment, they found that the door of the spacecraft was closing!

“Just close the door!” At this time, a man on the spacecraft pressed a red button and the spacecraft’s stairs slowly retracted and the door closed.

The federal soldiers were also stunned, they never expected that they would close the door suddenly.

And there were still many students on this rooftop!
