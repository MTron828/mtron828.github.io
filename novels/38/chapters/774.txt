Chapter 775: Wake Up!

Thinking of this and looking at Lin Xiu who was sleeping, a strong killing intent appeared on Qian Qiurong’s face.

Holding the sword in his hand, he directly stabbed Lin Xiu’s body!

Dang–

But when the long sword stabbed Lin Xiu’s body, there was a crisp sound.

His sharp long sword only pierced a little of Lin Xiu’s skin!

How can that be!

Seeing this scene, Qian Qiurong’s eyes could not help but widen.

His eyes were full of disbelief.

And he retracted the long sword. In the next moment, the slashed skin healed quickly at a speed visible to the naked eye!

Hell!

Even an evolved beast doesn’t have such a terrifying healing ability!

“Die!”

Qian Qiurong took a deep breath, then the source strength of his body gathered, almost most of them gathered on the long sword in his hand.

The entire long sword emited a dazzling light.

With this sword, he will kill Lin Xiu!

Boom—

But when he was about to stab Lin Xiu’s head with the long sword in his hand, a strong vibration came!

A huge evolved beast rushed towards him!

Raging Flame Lion!

Seeing this scene, the expression in Qian Qiurong’s eyes changed greatly.

Why did it come so soon!?

This darn thing!

There are so many warriors yet they couldn’t hold it back.

This huge and terrifying Raging flame lion was roaring furiously, waving its huge claws, then slapped his body!

boom–

In the next moment, as the claws of the Raging Flame lion slapped over, Qianqiu Rong flew out.

“I didn’t drink your amethyst divine water!”

At this moment, Qian Qiurong slammed into the wall behind him heavily and suddenly made a loud noise.

A mouthful of blood spit out from his mouth.

Qian Qiurong was aggrieved. This Raging flame lion obviously thought he drank the Amethyst Divine water.

But he didn’t touch the amethyst divine water at all!

And the man who drank the amethyst divine water was obviously still lying in the pool.

It’s just that the Raging Flame Lion clearly saw the existence of Qianqiu Rong and thought it was him. At this time, it attacked him crazily!

Damn!

Qian Qiurong cursed angrily at this time, but at this time he had no choice, so he held the long sword in his hand and charged over.

And at this time, Lin Xiu clearly felt the vibration.

Lin Xiu, who was sleeping at first, clearly felt something at this time. His closed eyes seemed to move slightly at this time and he began to slowly open his eyelids.

“It hurts...”

Lin Xiu frowned and slowly opened his eyelids.

The feeling of the body bursting, as if it just happened.

It was so painful, as if the body burst like an inflated balloon.

But now, all the pain has vanished.

Instead, there is a special sense of relief throughout the body.

And there seems to be a feeling of being able to control something.

Gene lock, finally unlocked successfully...

Lin Xiu remembered that when the unlocking failed, he really thought he was going to die...

boom boom boom —

At this time, because of the vibration of the cave, a huge stone fell from above.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened for a moment and he instantly regained his senses. He grabbed the Dark Edge spear beside him, then jumped directly out of the deep pool.

As soon as he jumped out, he could clearly see the huge Raging Flame Lion on the opposite side, as if going crazy, attacking a man madly.

Qian Qiurong!? Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Seeing this man, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes couldn’t help changing.

How did he get in!?

“It’s him! It’s him who drank your amethyst divine water!”

Qian Qiurong, who was fighting with the Raging Flame Lion, turned his eyes to the front and found that Lin Xiu knew when he had stood up and suddenly shouted loudly.

This Raging flame lion seemed to have acquired a certain intelligence. Hearing Qian Qiurong’s words, it turned to look behind him.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu ran directly to the outside of the cave!

The source strength was running, bursting out at extremely terrifying speed.

The gigantic head of the Raging Flame Lion looked back, looked at Lin Xiu, who ran out and looked at Qian Qiurong, who seemed to have not changed at all. It seemed to sense something and let out a huge roar, a pair of flame wings fluttered and rushed out.

At this time, the entire cave shook as if it were about to collapse.

“Damn... This kid, I’m going to kill you once I get out!!!”

Qian Qiurong was panting in this cave at this time.

He didn’t get anything yet and without thinking, he made a wedding dress for this man.

As for the warriors outside, although they were injured by the terrifying roar of the evolved beast, there were still many master warrior-level warriors who stood up and chased.

These people all thought that the Raging Flame Lion was an arrow at the end of its flight and was about to die before escaping and they didn’t know what happened.

But when they rushed over, they found a man rushing out of the hole.

“Odd crystals! The cave of the Raging Flame Lions has odd crystals piled up into mountains!!!”

Lin Xiu shouted loudly at this time.

“All of them are of rank 10!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the expressions of these people changed drastically.

Rank 10 odd crystal! Stacked up!

They had long heard that the Raging Flame Lion likes to collect all kinds of exotic treasures, but didn’t expect that it was true!

And there were so many treasures.

Lin Xiu’s words undoubtedly stimulated them, causing them to rush forward like they were injected with chicken blood.

Their speed was very fast, but at this moment, the Raging Flame Lion rushed out again!

The Raging Flame Lion was extremely furious. While roaring loudly, a large amount of terrifying flames spit out from its mouth.

Some warriors were caught off guard and were directly hit by the flames and they were scorched into black charcoal in an instant.

It looked around, as if searching for Lin Xiu’s figure.

“Kill it! Kill it to get the treasure!”

Lin Xiu mobilized his source strength at this time, then roared loudly.

This loud voice made the surrounding warriors hear a real, excited warrior. Hearing those words from Lin Xiu, it incited these warriors even further.

At this time, these warriors did not hold back and attacked the Raging Flame Lion who was roaring loudly at the entrance of the cave!

And Lin Xiu’s figure has already reached the other side!
