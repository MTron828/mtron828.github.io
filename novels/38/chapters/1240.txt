1241 Hard Fight

Baili Haoling looked at the weapons that were charging toward her and the pupils in her eyes shrank slightly.

There is no other way, she can only use her own two swords to withstand the impact of those weapons.

Dang dang dang——

These weapons controlled by Sha Qiong seemed to be attacked by invisible warriors with these weapons and the attacks were very fierce.

!!

“Damn…”

Baili Haoling’s eyes turned redder and redder. Because of the power bestowed by the Divine soul, Baili Haoling’s twin swords possessed extremely strong power at this time.

The blades turned blood red.

After slashing against those weapons, soon, cracks appeared in those weapons.

“Hehehe…you all will die here!”

Sha Qiong looked at Baili Haoling and Lin Xiu.

From his point of view, Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling will soon be powerless to resist and when the time comes, they will definitely die!

“It’s over, it’s over…”

Lei Tong in the sky looked at the scene below and muttered to himself.

He also didn’t expect that this Sha Qiong would be so powerful.

Indeed the God warrior Realm had hidden dragons and crouching tigers.

And Xiaobai, who was holding onto Lei Tong with his claws, seemed to sense the crisis of the current situation at this moment and immediately made a loud and clear sound.

Its pair of snow-white and huge wings flapped at this moment.

A stream of ice and snow forces directly charged toward the Sha Qiong below!

Sha Qiong didn’t even look this way and a large amount of dark energy spreading from his body flew into the air.

Under the obstruction of that large area of dark energy like black mist, Xiaobai’s frost power had no effect at all!

‘Fury’ time was almost up.

At this time, Lin Xiu was frantically waving the spear in his hand, while secretly paying attention to the remaining time of his ‘Fury’.

There were still five minutes.

If there was no way to get rid of this Sha Qiong within five minutes, he will definitely be in an extremely dangerous situation.

It is very possible that he was killed by this Sha Qiong!

I, I can’t die here.

At this time, Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and directly activated the system skill ‘Full Blown Profound Intent’!

Under ‘Full Blown Profound Intent’, all the skills used by Lin Xiu have activated the ultimate profound intent.

Even if it is not a god-level skill, the power the skill has after activating the profound intent was extremely powerful.

‘Profound Intent: Heaven Breaking Strike’!!!

At this time, all the source strength of Lin Xiu’s body was transmitted to the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

Because of the transmission of the source strength on the spear, the long spear burst out with a bright light at this time.

Whoosh—

Following Lin Xiu’s direct circular sweep, these weapons that attacked him from all directions were all smashed into countless pieces and they were blown away directly.

A huge space crack was drawn around Lin Xiu.

The power of this blow is really too powerful and terrifying.

Sha Qiong watched this scene and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly. He didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would release such a powerful skill.

At this time, seeing a large number of weapon fragments attacking him, he waved his right hand and a large amount of black energy appeared in front of him, blocking all the incoming weapon fragments.

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate at all and immediately activated the ‘Flashing Souls’ body skill and appeared in front of Sha Qiong in an instant.

“Get lost!”

Seeing this scene, Sha Qiong’s expression changed drastically.

A large amount of black energy gathered on the fist of his right hand. Looking at Lin Xiu who appeared in front of him, he punched out directly!

boom–

Lin Xiu reacted quickly and blocked his blow with the body of the Dark Edge spear.

The power of this punch was terrifying. Even though Lin Xiu had been prepared for it, his body was pushed back a short distance at this moment.

But Lin Xiu still reacted quickly and continued to rush out with the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

‘Profound Intent·Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!

Thousands of spear shadows burst out at this moment and continued to charge towards Sha Qiong.

Each shot carried an incomparably terrifying power.

Sha Qiong’s face had turned gloomy. He never thought that Lin Xiu would have the power to unleash such a terrifying skill.

He continued to wave his right hand and a large amount of dark energy appeared in front of him again.

Form an incomparably huge barrier.

Bang bang bang——

Every shot of Lin Xiu pierced the huge barrier formed by these dark energies.

...

But there is absolutely no way to penetrate this barrier and attack Sha Qiong.

There was a feeling of powerlessness like he was hitting cotton with a fist.

Damn, how can these dark energies be so weird!?

It is too powerful compared to other attribute energies.

“There’s no way, you can’t even touch the corner of my clothes!!!”

At this time, Sha Qiong roared with a ferocious face.

It is time to attack Lin Xiu back!

But at this moment, his face suddenly changed drastically and his left hand trembled violently.

His eyes suddenly looked to the other side.

At this moment, the weapons controlled by his left hand that were attacking Baili Haoling were swallowed by a huge, chubby creature with its mouth wide open.

Those weapons with dark energy attached to them were swallowed by the creature directly into its mouth.

...

And together with the dark energy attached to the weapon and used to control the weapon, it was swallowed up!

how can that be!!!

Sha Qiong’s face became extremely ugly.

What exactly is this evolved beast!?

It looks chubby, with white hair all over its body, like a giant snowball.

But it was this thing that actually swallowed up his weapon and his dark power seemed to be absorbed by it!

It wasn’t just Sha Qiong who was shocked, Baili Haoling was extremely shocked at this time. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Just now, Rollie suddenly flew over from the other side, opened his mouth wide and swallowed the weapons that were still attacking him.

Those dozens of extremely difficult weapons that had dark energy attached were easily swallowed.

And at this moment, Rollie seemed to be very satisfied and patted its tummy.

It’s as if it was full!

It’s weird, it’s really weird.

However, Baili Haoling didn’t think much about it at this time and as soon as she moved, she rushed towards Sha Qiong!

“Humph!”

Looking at Baili Haoling who was attacking, Sha Qiong immediately waved his right hand and some dark energy quickly gathered on Baili Haoling’s side, then formed three huge guards.

These huge guards formed of dark energy held huge sabers and attacked the Baili Haoling who was rushing over!

The expression in Baili Haoling’s eyes changed slightly, but she was very flexible. At this time, she used her body skills and quickly avoided the attacks of the three giant guards formed of dark energy.

And she turned around and slashed at one of the guards twice!
