Chapter 40: Zombie Siege

Xu Wen continued to shoot the laser gun for a while longer but realized that they were not useful.

It was no wonder hardly any warriors used laser guns to deal with zombies. Although the lasers could burst through the zombie bodies, as long as the heads were still intact, the zombies would be fine!

The eight of them shot with laser guns and only got rid of one each. But Lin Xiu’s spear had already killed five or six of them!

These zombies had overall combat strength comparable to rank 1 warriors. If they chose to pounce and bite, the team was in for trouble.

They might end up like the soldier that died.

But fortunately, these zombies did not appear to have any intelligence. Lin Xiu swung his spear out to attack while retreating simultaneously.

By pouring source strength into Silver Immortal Soul, the entire spear seemed to turn into a spear glowing with silver light.

The sharp end of the spear danced alongside Lin Xiu like lightning and shot out in all trajectories.

Bang, bang, bang!

A few zombie heads dropped to the ground.

The notification in his head kept ringing out, but Lin Xiu did not have the time to pay attention to it, because if he was careless, his life might be taken!

Xu Wen was inwardly shocked when he saw Lin Xiu attacking without regard for his life.

‘Isn’t he a student? Why is he so ferocious?’

“Vacuum Slash!” Xu Wen used a skill without thinking further.

Following his roar, his saber slashed forward and unleashed a powerful vacuum blade that sliced through a few zombies and cut them at their bodies.

“All these zombies have no intellect, although their combat strength is high, we will be fine as long as we are careful and not bitten.” Lin Xiu glanced to the side where Li Yi was killing zombies.

As he had increased his speed to 60 points, Lin Xiu felt his body becoming lighter and his reaction speed had grown faster.

Li Yi relaxed when he heard Lin Xiu’s voice. Just like how he hunted evolved beasts in the past, he avoided and killed the zombies.

All the soldiers around unleashed their own skills and killed a great number of the zombies.

Bloodstench pervaded the air and the ground was covered with blood.

“Awe of the Phoenix!” Lin Xiu felt the fatigue and called out.

There were too many zombies and due to slight carelessness, his spear was held and restricted by a few zombies,

A few zombies behind took the opportunity and rushed towards Lin Xiu’s body!

Lin Xiu had no choice but to utilize Awe of the Phoenix. After becoming a Rank 1 Warrior, Lin Xiu felt that his strength had grown substantially.

Although the stats board did not explicitly reveal anything, he was able to sense that his body was different from before.

It was no wonder why Official Warriors were separated at the 800 combat strength mark.

Whoosh!

As Lin Xiu unleashed the skill, the silver spear tip erupted with flames.

With a loud bang, the gigantic flaming bird flew out. All the zombies that tried to restrict Lin Xiu’s spear immediately combust into flames.

Lin Xiu snorted and exerted a force. He pulled out the spear and killed the surrounding zombies without pausing!

Experience! All the notifications kept appearing in his mind.

But Awe of the Phoenix was an extremely exhaustive skill that used up his stamina and source strength. At this moment, Lin Xiu felt a hint of fatigue.

The others were tired as well.

There were too many zombies and they could not do anything to the fear that was setting in.

It simply felt as though the entire city had been sieged by a zombie horde!

“Let’s retreat first.” Xu Wen gritted his teeth and gave the order after killing two zombies with one strike.

The others agreed.

Lin Xiu glanced behind and discovered that the zombies coming from the rear had decreased. There were only a dozen-odd left.

Retreating from that direction was the best decision.

“You guys retreat from the rear, I’ll use my skills to cover you all.” Lin Xiu said and swung his spear to kill another few zombies.

If he had sufficient stamina, killing all the zombies would be a shortcut for him to level.

But he had no other choice, pushing to stay on was too risky.

The expressions of the soldiers became awkward when they heard Lin Xiu’s words, to have a student’s protection was truly too embarrassing.

But it was not a time to be petty, they were almost out of stamina!

“We are in your debt” Xu Wen looked at Lin Xiu deeply and said.

Lin Xiu nodded his head. In an instant, source strength from his body was transferred into the spear as he utilized Awe of the Phoenix again!

The giant flaming bird blocked the zombies and charged towards them!

“Move!” Everyone immediately retreated upon Lin Xiu’s instruction.

A dozen-odd zombies were killed instantly as they retreated.

Lin Xiu ran along with them while depleting the source strength in his body. If this continued, there was a chance that he might die too.

“Over there, let’s hide there!” Li Yi spotted a towering building and the doors seemed open.

Everyone ran in without hesitation.

Lin Xiu pulled the doors and closed them shut.

“Whew”

Everyone gasped for breath. Since it was their first time experiencing such a situation. It was an extremely close shave.

Lin Xiu leaned against a wall and snuck his way to the dark glass. He looked outside but did not find any traces of the zombies.

The zombies most probably did not know that the group had hidden in the building.

“Take a rest, I think the zombies won’t chase us.” Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief and sat on the ground. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

He placed the spear beside him.

He finally had the time to look at his stat board and found that he had earned over 200k experience!

It was truly out of his expectation.

If he continued killing the zombies, who knew if he could even become a rank 2 warrior on the day to return home!

“Da zhu, what’s wrong?” Right at this moment, a soldier asked his comrade that was seated on the floor and howling in pain.

His leg was bleeding. It seemed as though… he was bitten by a zombie!
