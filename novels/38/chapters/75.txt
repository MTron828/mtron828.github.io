Chapter 76: Successful Gene Lock, Promoted To Rank 2 Warrior!

The referee initially thought of stopping Tang Tian as Lin Xiu did not even have the strength to resist and looked as though he was about to die.

But right at this moment, Lin Xiu struggled to shout out, “Hit me harder…”

“Did you not eat?”

“Seeking death!!!” Hearing Lin Xiu’s provocation, Tang Tian held onto Lin Xiu’s body and sent out a barrage of punches.

Low sounds resounded as though he was punching a punching bag.

“Lin Xiu, admit defeat!” Yang Tian could not handle the brutality and advised Lin Xiu.

He wanted to barge in, but there were too many people and he could not advance.

Luo Li looked at Lin Xiu in shock, he could not understand why Lin Xiu would say such words. By saying that, the referee could not stop Tang Tian!

And at this moment, although Lin Xiu was able to see Tang Tian unleashing a relentless barrage of attacks on him, he could not feel a thing. The pain from the Gene Lock was a thousand times more painful than the punches.

And as Tang Tian continued to punch his body, Lin Xiu seemed to feel some relief from the internal pain. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“AH! Go and die!!!” Tang Tian saw how Lin Xiu was staring at him, and he laughed like a maniac. He threw Lin Xiu to the ground, raised his fists, and launched a series of Salvo Fist onto Lin Xiu’s face, punching his head into the stone-hard floor. The surrounding area started to produce cracks.

The entire field was silent.

Yang Tian and Luo Li had their jaws wide open and did not know what to say.

“Mr. Ye…” The other teachers looked at Mr. Ye anxiously.

They knew that Mr. Ye was optimistic and had some sort of connection with Lin Xiu. Who would have thought that Lin Xiu would be beaten to this extent and his head was forced into the ground? It seemed as though even if they saved him, he would have been crippled.

“Wait a moment.” Mr. Ye seemed to have sensed that something was amiss, even though they were far, he was able to sense the power in Lin Xiu’s body with his own strength. He could feel that Lin Xiu was getting stronger.

What was going on?

“Hahaha! Great! Beat him up!!!” When the entire place was silent, Tang Ping slapped his own thighs and laughed out loud.

Although they could not kill Lin Xiu, they would definitely beat him and mess his head until he became crippled. Just like that, they could kill him at any moment!

“Hehe, seems like even if you don’t die, you’ll be crippled.” Tang Tian could not help but laugh.

Since there were many eyes watching him, he could not kill Lin Xiu there and then. He would find another chance to do so.

“Winner, Tang…” The referee could not bear to watch it anymore and wanted to hail Tang Tian as the winner, but suddenly, Lin Xiu who seemed to have been crippled raised his hand. The referee was dumbstruck.

“Everyone look, Lin Xiu, he…”

Right at this moment, the entire crowd flew into an uproar. After having his head beaten into the ground, Lin Xiu who was lying on the ground like a meat pulp raised his right hand.

Tang TIan who had turned to pick up his sword heard the sound from Lin Xiu and turned to look.

His eyes widened and he roared, “How is this possible!”

Crack crack-

It started with his right hand but did not stop there. Lin Xiu started to move his left hand, and after exerting force, he started to lift himself up from the ground.

“He is getting up! He’s actually standing!” Many students gasped. It was too miraculous and the entire crowd was stunned.

Even Mr. Ye was surprised. This change was something he did not understand!

Lin Xiu did not consume any forbidden medicine or do anything else, how did he suddenly have strength again!

“Whew.” Lin Xiu’s face and body was covered with blood, but his entire being seemed to be brimming with energy.

When he stood up, Lin Xiu felt that his entire body, vision, reflexes, and his sensory organs had all become even better.

His body was also brimming with power!

All the cells in his body that had initially exploded had birthed new cells. These new cells had gone through a complete change as they divided more and more!

Following the cell division in his body, Lin Xiu could sense boundless power spreading throughout his body. The wounds on his body were slowly being healed.

“Congratulations Master, success in unlocking Rank 1 Gene Lock!”

“Congratulations Master, success in unlocking Rank 1 Gene Lock, awarded with three draw opportunities!”

“Congratulations Master for successful promotion to Rank 2 Warrior, awarded with one draw opportunity!”

“Congratulations Master for obtaining the title ‘Rank 2 Warrior!”

“…”

Countless system notifications rang out. Lin Xiu knew that he had successfully unlocked the Gene Lock!

Although nobody else could see his state, Lin Xiu knew that a series of transformations had occurred starting from his cells to his marrow, bones, organs, and even skin!

Although this change could not be seen from the naked eye, it had greatly affected Lin Xiu.

The current Lin Xiu was brimming with power!!!

“What kind of act are you playing?” Tang Tian roared out loud and extended his hand to draw his Blood Fiend Sword when he saw Lin Xiu charging forward with a punch!

Air seemed to rip apart from his fists!

Lin Xiu’s Rupturing Fist!

“My Salvo Fist isn’t afraid of you!” Tang Tian roared out loud and sent his own fist out!

He had the strength of a Rank 3 warrior! No matter how powerful Lin Xiu’s Rupturing Fist was, the difference in rank meant that he could not lose!

His heart was filled with killing intent.

Although he was saved from consuming Forbidden Medicine the last time, it had left traces in his body and he would no longer be able to break through rank 4.

Without a choice, he went to the Path of Death and obtained similar medicines that allowed his strength to rise extremely quickly!

Although the aftereffects meant that his body could no longer increase in strength, it was nothing to him.

Right at this moment, their fists collided with a loud ‘bang’ that spread through the entire field!
