1335 The Forbidden Land of the God King

“Go to hell!!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was still coming at him, Xiao Qingchen roared in rage as he tightly gripped onto his machete.

He swung the machete from the top of his head!

The energy coming from this machete was incredibly strong.

Boom !

Lin Xiu looked at the machete that Xiao Qingchen had as well and he roared.

Then, the fist that was covered with the intense energy was thrown forward!

All of the air around twisted due to the heat when Lin Xiu released the attack.

‘Profound intent – Destroy the Sky!’

This was a god-level warrior skill and along with the large amount of energy instilled into it, Lin Xiu’s punch was now at its peak.

There were loud explosions in the air that came one after another.

These loud noises were enough to break through the eardrums of those who were present.

All of them had to cover their ears.

“Ahhhhh!!!”

Xiao Qingchen could clearly feel the strength of the punch coming at him and he screamed.

Then, he immediately released all of the energy inside his body to form his ‘sphere’.

If he was still in his best form, he would have had the chance to stop it.

However, by now, he had already exhausted himself.

The chances of him being able to stop it forcefully was minimal.

Boom – –

Then, he swung his machete, hoping to be able to stop the punch coming from Lin Xiu.

There was a loud sound that was followed by an explosion.

The energy barriers around the stage were badly shaken and there were a large number of cracks that appeared on it.

The intense energy from both the warriors were about to blast through the energy barrier.

If the energy from the battle actually seeped out of the energy barrier, some of them who were weak would be instantly killed from it.

Riyan God Lord was about to secure it when he noticed the God King moving his left arm.

Suddenly, there was a new and special energy barrier that enveloped around the stage.

At that instant, the original energy barrier that was placed around the stage, instantly exploded.

Riyan God Lord couldn’t help but let out a breath of relief.

The energy that was created by the collision of two god warriors was intense.

The energy barrier was about to break.

If it wasn’t because of the God King, most of the audience here would have been affected by it.

Riyan God Lord then turned his attention onto this stage.

Lin Xiu and Xiao Qingchen were both fixed at the same spot.

Xiao Qingchen had both hands on the machete and it had collided with Lin Xiu’s fist.

However, there were already large cracks that appeared all over the machete.

It was obvious that the machete was destroyed.

“I still didn’t get to kill you…”

Lin Xiu looked at Xiao Qingchen who was standing right in front of him as he panted.

When Xiao Qingchen took a closer look, he noticed that Lin Xiu’s fist was already in contact with his machete but it did not throw him away.

However, the intense energy that came from the attack caused Xiao Qingchen’s body to be covered in blood.

Xiao Qingchen was like a walking blood bag.

Even the skin on his face started breaking apart.

It looked incredibly scary.

“I lost…”

Xiao Qingchen smiled before he fell onto the ground.

“Match over!”

“Victory for Lin Xiu from Lingxian City!!!”

The referee, who was floating in the air, gave the final announcement.

The rest of the audience have gone wild as well.

“Lin Xiu!”

“Lin Xiu!”

At that moment, everyone was cheering for Lin Xiu.

However, he could no longer hear them clearly.

...

He felt that he had no energy left in his body.

He looked drowsy and soon, he fell straight onto the ground.

He might have heard Lei Chong and Baili Haoling’s voice next to him.

Time passed but Lin Xiu felt as if he went back in time.

From the moment before his rebirth to when he came to this world and even the moment where he first met Luo Yue.

Every scene flashed across his eyes.

Then, Lin Xiu opened his eyes.

“Lin Xiu?!”

Baili Haoling jumped in surprise when she saw Lin Xiu who finally woke up.

“Where am I?”

Lin Xiu gave his eyes some time to adjust to the light before asking them.

...

Baili Haoling and Lei Chong were both here.

Rollie and Xiao Bai were sitting next to his body as well.

There was also a dim glow that came from Rollie’s body.

This allowed Lin Xiu to feel a sense of warmth inside his body.

“City lord! You’re finally awake! I kept hearing you calling for ‘Luo Yue’. Is she your wife?”

Lei Chong was also delighted to see that Lin Xiu had woken up and he quickly asked.

Lin Xiu ignored Lei Chong’s question and kept quiet.

It has been some time since he came to the God Warrior Realm but he still had no news of Luo Yue.

“But….where are we?”

Lin Xiu decided to look around when no one was answering him.

He then realised that this was not the hotel.

The furniture in the room was different.

The walls seemed to have been made of a special type of rock and they were glowing with a dim light.

He was now lying on top of a bed that was made of jade.

Lin Xiu then carefully felt the air around him and there was a vast amount of energy in the air.

Lin Xiu’s body was already naturally absorbing the energy in the air around him.

“How long have I been asleep?”

Lin Xiu asked both of them.

He then only thought of how in the previous battle, he almost killed Xiao Qingchen.

However, this man’s body was much tougher than he thought.

If he managed to kill Xiao Qingchen, he should be able to gain a ton of EXP, right?

“Just one day.”

Baili Haoling quickly answered.

“This is the Forbidden Land of the God King.” Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Lei Chong answered his other question.

Forbidden Land of the God King?

Lin Xiu was stunned at first but soon realized where he was.

The forbidden place stated was the palace where the God King stayed.

There were no internet or phone lines available in this place which was why it was considered a forbidden place.

“The energy in here is quite strong.”

Lin Xiu, instantly felt that all the energy that he had exhausted from earlier, had now been replenished.

“I know!”

“I have a feeling that I would be able to become a god warrior soon.”

Lei Chong couldn’t help but feel surprised.

“Right! That man known as Riyan God Lord said that we should bring you over to the central pavilion once you woke up.”

Baili Haoling suddenly got reminded about something.

“Umm….I’ll take a look.”

Lin Xiu jumped up from the ‘jade bed’.

Once he moved his body, there were countless bone-cracking sounds that came from it.

It felt comforting!
