Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

This was the building of the Sacred Region Academy.

Looking around, he found that there were high-rise buildings everywhere and there were many airships flying around in the sky.

It looks prosperous.

“Finally reached!”

Ouyang Hang walked down at this time, and said a little excitedly.

He had a bruised nose and a swollen face just now, but after taking the medicine, he had recovered quickly.

“Where is the match held at?”

Lin Xiu said curiously.

“Come on, follow the teacher.” Baili Haoling jumped out of the airship and said aloud with her head held high.

Seeing Baili Haoling’s proud appearance, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but have black lines all over his head.

And Huang Zhen and Qian Yao seemed to be quite afraid of her, so they followed her to the front.

After taking the elevator to the downstairs, Lin Xiu and the others continued to walk forward with Baili Haoling leading.

This Nanyang City looked very prosperous, and there were many pedestrians on this street.

And most of them were young warriors. These warriors were armed with weapons, and it seemed that they were going to participate in the warrior conference.

“This year’s warrior conference is said to be the one with the most academies participating.”

Baili Haoling said aloud as she walked.

“There are indeed quite a lot of people.”

Lin Xiu looked at this scene and said aloud.

They were all wearing the white uniforms of the Sacred Region academy, and you could tell at one glance that they were an academy group.

The gazes of the people around turned to Lin Xiu from time to time.

Although Sacred Region academy was one of the most powerful colleges in China, it wasn’t very popular.

“Well, here we are.”

With Baili Haoling leading, Lin Xiu and the others reached the huge building in front of them.

It was like a huge gymnasium, surrounded by some intelligent robots.

At the gate, there were a large number of warriors wearing various academy combat suits, coming in and out.

An audition...

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and walked in directly.

Soon, as everyone walked in, they started to sign in at the front desk.

“There are so many people…” Huang Zhen said aloud at this time. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This service desk already had many windows for sign-in and registration for contestants from various academies, but it seemed that there was still not enough staff.

There were too many colleges participating in the competition.

Although in the Huaxia region, there were three major divisions for the audition, but even so, there were still too many people.

“Hello, what college are you from?”

When it was Lin Xiu and others’ turn, the staff asked enthusiastically.

“Sacred Region academy.”

Lin Xiu stood in front, and when he heard his words, he said aloud.

“Sacred Region academy…”

Hearing these three words, the staff member was stunned for a moment, and then seemed to have thought of something.

At this time, after he tapped the keyboard, a camera on the upper side moved, and then scanned Lin Xiu and the others.

Di di di-

Soon, with a sound, the words on the screen seemed to match the data.

The staff member also smiled and said, “The registration has been completed. This is your entry card.”

Soon, Lin Xiu and the others were all assigned a card with the same card number: NO:263

“The audition will start at 8:00 tomorrow morning, and you can log on to the website of the Warrior Union at 8:00 tonight to check the grouping tomorrow, please take note.”

“Well, thank you.” Lin Xiu said with a smile.

“I didn’t expect it to be the next day…” Ouyang Hang seemed a little upset.

“Isn’t this great? You’re probably not in your best state, right?”

Lin Xiu said with a smile at this time.

“I guess…” Ouyang Hang agreed with Lin Xiu. In today’s battle, he did suffer a little injury, and the battle with Baili Haoling on the airship just now also caused him to lose a lot of confidence. To fight now was really not a good time.

“Squeak?”

At this time, Xiaobai, who was in Lin Xiu’s pocket, took a peek and then looked around, as if it was curious.

Rollie was in Lin Xiu’s other pocket, it seemed to be still asleep.

“Huh? What is this?”

Baili Haoling noticed Xiaobai. At this time, she looked curiously at the little head and said.

“Squeak!”

Xiaobai looked at Baili Haoling and seemed to sense danger. It looked at her and seemed very on guard.

“My pet.”

Lin Xiu said helplessly.

Rollie and Xiao Bai had been sticking to Lin Xiu ever since they came back this time. There was no other way but to bring them here too.

“I want to take a look.” Baili Haoling couldn’t help but reach out and touch Lin Xiu’s pocket, and took out Xiao Bai.

“Squeak!”

Xiaobai struggled for a while, and looked at Lin Xiu, as if it was asking for help.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu spread out his hands helplessly, showing a helpless expression.

“Haha, your pet is very cute.” Xiaobai struggled, and then stood in the palm of Baili Haoling’s hand, looking a little pitiful.

“Haha, Lin Xiu, you’re such a girl to keep such pets.” Ouyang Hang, who saw this scene, seemed to have seen something extraordinary, and said with an exaggerated smile.

“Hehe, you despise it?”

Lin Xiu said with a sneer.

“Tsk tsk, this little bird, can it eat me up huh?”

Ouyang Hang said with a smile, and then reached out to touch Xiao Bai.

“Squeak!”

When Xiaobai saw Ouyang Hang reach out and touch it, he suddenly turned into an angry bird, opened his mouth, and spat out a cold breath from its mouth.

Clack clack——

As the white cold air erupted in an instant, in the next moment, Ouyang Hang’s whole body turned into an ice sculpture even before he could react.

In the ice sculpture, Ouyang Hang still kept his eyes wide open, his face was full of disbelief.

“Squeak!”

And Xiaobai made a sound at this time, as if to express its power.

Kala——

However, Ouyang Hang was a rank 7 warrior after all, and in the next moment, the ice cube shattered in an instant.

“Damn it, I’m freezing to death.” Ouyang Hang said with a trembling body.

“What kind of evolved beast are you?”

Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“Ice Crystal White Bird.”

Lin Xiu smiled lightly.

“Damn, why didn’t you tell me earlier.”

Of course, Ouyang Hang knew the name of the Ice Crystal White Bird, so he couldn’t help but say it out loud.

“It’s a good bird, how about leaving it with me?”

At this moment, an unfriendly voice came.
