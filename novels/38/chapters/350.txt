Chapter 351: Going To The Pub Again

Soon, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue entered the room.

The room was spacious and there was a small area in the middle where you could cultivate.

Lin Xiu put the Dark Edge Spear on the ground and stretched.

Although he only spent just a few days in the Dark Forest, Lin Xiu felt as if a long time had passed.

Bang–

As Lin Xiu put the backpack on the table next to him, Rollie stuck its head out of the backpack and looked around curiously.

Lin Xiu looked at Rollie and couldn’t help but smile.

When he turned around and looked behind, he realized that Luo Yue was gone.

“Luo Yue?” Lin Xiu was taken aback and called out.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu heard a pattering sound.

He walked near the bathroom and seemed to hear the sound of water.

Taking a shower?

Lin Xiu was stunned when he heard the sound of water and an image appeared in his head which made him swallow his saliva.

But Lin Xiu quickly shook his head – what was he thinking?

Luo Yue probably hasn’t showered in the dark forest for a period of time and she couldn’t take it anymore. After all, girls are relatively clean.

Lin Xiu shook his head then sat cross-legged on the floor to begin the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

Today’s battle has consumed a lot of strength and the source strength in his body was also low. Now it is necessary to replenish it as soon as possible.

After all, dangers were everywhere, it was better to be careful.

After some time, Lin Xiu heard a squeak.

And at this moment, a faint fragrance reached his nose.

Lin Xiu opened his eyes and saw Luo Yue appear in front of him.

Seeing Luo Yue, Lin Xiu was stunned.

Luo Yue was done with her shower and her hair was still wet.

Taking a closer look, she was wearing a skirt, which made her look youthful and lively.

It was unlike her usual icy appearance.

“There was only this kind of clothes here.” Luo Yue spoke up like she knew what Lin Xiu wanted to say.

After hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu suddenly remembered that when they arrived at this town, Luo Yue left for a while to buy something.

So she went to buy clothes…

That makes sense… her battle suit had a hole and could no longer be worn.

“Go take a shower.” Luo Yue wrinkled her nose at this time and said to Lin Xiu.

“Shower?” Lin Xiu was startled, then he looked at Luo Yue, who was like a lotus flower in the water, and swallowed as though he thought of something.

A man and woman were alone in the room, and she even asked him to go and shower. Could it be…

But just as Lin Xiu fell into his dirty thoughts, he happened to see Luo Yue looking at him like he was an idiot.

“You are very dirty now.” Luo Yue said indifferently.

“Ahem.” Lin Xiu coughed awkwardly then realized that he was overthinking.

But his body did look very dirty and because there was a lot of dried-up blood on his body, he gave off a bloody stench.

When he walked into the bathroom, Lin Xiu found out that a set of clean clothes had been placed inside.

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment and when he took a closer look, it seemed to be similar to Luo Yue’s just now, but it was a set for guys.

“Luo Yue?” Lin Xiu called out to Luo Yue outside. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“I accidentally took an extra set.” Luo Yue had already dried her hair at this time then sat on the floor like she was practicing the ‘cultivation techniques’ too.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue said indifferently.

Lin Xiu was taken aback at this moment then couldn’t help smiling.

Could it be… Luo Yue is tsundere?

It didn’t take long for Lin Xiu to wash up then put on the clothes Luo Yue bought. At this moment, he felt very comfortable and clean.

When he was in the dark forest, he hadn’t taken a shower for several days. The feeling after taking a shower was simply too refreshing.

“We can return to the Sanctuary Academy from the Deep Blue City tomorrow at ten o’clock in the morning.

When Lin Xiu came out, Luo Ye was already sitting on the computer at the table while typing on the keyboard and said aloud.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded.

In the evening, the two of them ate something simple at the hotel then walked over to the pub in town.

At this moment, Lin Xiu was still holding the horn of the Unicorn terror beast.

Because those warriors from before said that as long as he got the horn of this Unicorn terror beast, he could go to the pub to do a trade with them.

Anyway, he already brought it back. For Lin Xiu, the horn of this Unicorn terror beast was of no use so maybe he could exchange it for something instead.

Walking on the street, people looked towards Lin Xiu and Luo Yue from time to time.

Because both of their clothes were from the same store, it looked like they were wearing a couple outfit.

Soon, with Lin Xiu leading the way, they arrived at the pub.

It was night time but it looked very lively inside.

The warriors who came back from the dark forest were all drinking or dancing.

Lin Xiu walked in and looked around, but still didn’t seem to find the warrior who had told him to come here to find him.

Lin Xiu frowned slightly.

“Hey young lady, did you come here alone, why don’t you come over for a drink?” At this moment, a muscular man looked at Luo Yue who walked in and his eyes suddenly lit up as he held a glass full of wine and stood in Luo Yue’s way.

At this time, he was looking at Luo Yue greedily.

Although Luo Yue looked cold, she was too beautiful. He had never seen such a beautiful woman.

If he didn’t strike up a conversation, it would be a pity.

Hearing his words at this time, Luo Yue said faintly, “Go away.”

Hearing that, the man smiled, “Interesting, I like a woman with a personality like yours.”

While smiling, he stretched out his hand to touch Luo Yue’s face.

He was already feeling itchy now.

Pa–

At this moment, a hand suddenly stretched out from behind Luo Yue and grabbed the man’s wrist.
