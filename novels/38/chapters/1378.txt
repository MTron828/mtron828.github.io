1379 Lin Xiu to the Rescue!

“We can give them to you.”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng gritted their teeth as they said so.

There were none of them here and there was no chance for the both of them to fight back.

“No. We don’t need you to do that. We can take it ourselves.”

!!

The man with a moustache known as Zhang Laosan let out a cough laugh.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng have a gloomy look on their faces.

It was obvious from his tone that Zhan Laosan was going to kill them.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng started gathering the energy left in their bodies.

Even if they were hurting all over, it was as if they couldn’t feel it.

This was because Zhang Laosan was about to kill them.

“Zhang Laosan, are you sure you’re not going to give them to us?”

At the same time, the other two warriors turned and asked Zhang Laosan.

“You…..”

“Who do you think you are?”

Zhang Laosan warned them in a cold tone.

With that said, the energy in his body exploded instantly.

Boom – –

There was a huge surge of energy that went directly to the two warriors who spoke.

With such a horrifying impact, their bodies got thrown into the distance.

They only managed to steady themselves after a long time and spat out a mouthful of blood.

“You…”

Both of them looked frightened as they stared at Zhang Laosan.

They didn’t think that Zhang Laosan would be someone so powerful.

He had merely released the energy in his body to pressure them but they were thrown far into the distance.

Zhang Laosan ignored both of them and turned back to Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng who were preparing to fight. There was a cold, murderous look in their eyes.

As for the rest of the warriors standing behind Zhang Laosan, they were mocking Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng.

Then, there was a long sword that appeared in Zhang Laosan’s hand.

As he swung it across the sky, there was a huge crescent shaped sword aura that appeared and it was headed for Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng.

The sword came so quickly that both Xiao Qingcheng and Yuan Zheng, who were already injured, did not have the time to dodge the attack.

Boom – –

The next moment, the ‘sphere’ that they had released instantly exploded.

Pfft – —

Both of them spat out a mouthful of blood.

It’s over.

Following that, both their faces turned pale.

With the energy that they had left, they didn’t even have enough to release their divine spirit.

They no longer have the ability to continue blocking Zhan Laosan’s attacks.

“Goodbye…”

Zhang Laosan showed a cold laugh.

As he swung the long sword in the air once again, another horrifying aword aura was released!

Boom – –

Suddenly, there was a figure that appeared in front of Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng.

The sword aura that was headed at them disappeared as well.

Huh?

Zhang Laosan furrowed his brows.

“Lin Xiu?”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng noticed that Lin Xiu was standing in front of them and were both equally surprised.

They didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be here!

“I just happened to pass by.”

“Still alive?”

Lin Xiu smiled as he asked both of them who were behind him.

“Yeah.” Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng nodded their heads.

Although they have been severely injured, they weren’t dying.

“Who are you?”

...

Zhang Laosan stared at Lin Xiu as he asked.

The sword aura may have been a simple attack but it was a powerful one.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be able to stop it so easily.

“Well, that isn’t important.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

He looked at the warriors around and asked, “Are these your men?”

“So what?”

Zhang Laosan sneered.

He tried to sense Lin Xiu’s abilities but all he could find was that Lin Xiu was merely a warrior saint.

However, that would be impossible, only warrior gods would be allowed to enter this place!

There were only two reasons why he couldn’t sense them.

...

One was that Lin Xiu’s abilities are too powerful and the other, Lin Xiu is hiding something.

“Well, get your men to give me their marks so that all three of us can leave this place.”

Lin Xiu spoke with a wide smile on his face.

“Nonsense!”

As soon as Lin Xiu said so, the rest of the warriors looked pissed.

“Kill him!”

Zhang Laosan then looked like he was ready to kill them.

With that said, these warrior gods then rushed towards Lin Xiu!

They were ready to chop Lin Xiu into pieces! Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng chuckled when they saw what was about to happen.

They have first-handedly witness Lin Xiu’s abilities and he was much stronger than both of them.

If it wasn’t because both of them were injured, they wouldn’t be afraid of these warriors.

But now, these warriors were rushing towards Lin Xiu! They were courting death, no doubt!

Lin Xiu held onto his golden spear and smiled as he looked at the warriors who were getting closer to him.

Xiu – –

The spear drew a semi circle in the air and there was a strong surge of energy released.

Boom boom boom – –

The warriors then suddenly felt a heavy push and the bodies were thrown into the air!

Then, they landed heavily back onto the ground.

Pfft!!

All of them were severely injured by it and has suffered internal injuries.

Such powerful strength!

The brothers from before were shocked as well.

They thought that Zhang Laosan was already someone powerful but they didn’t think that Lin Xiu was also the same!

Both of them looked at each other and quickly left the scene.

They should not stay here any longer.

“Interesting.”

Zhang Laosan furrowed his brows.

“Since you’re not giving it to me, I will take it myself!”

Lin Xiu then raised his golden pear and started moving it in the air.

Boom – –

Countless flaming birds were released from the spear.

All of the headed for all the warriors who were on the ground!

When the rest of them saw what was about to happen, their eyes were wide open.

Their eyes were filled with fear.

These flames had such a high temperature that the air around them was scorching hot as well.

The warriors who were lying on the ground felt threatened and quickly tried to gather their energies together.

They wanted to release their ‘sphere’ to block the attack!

Boom boom – –

The dark blue flames landed on their spheres followed by loud explosions everywhere.

The heat was too much and they were feeling extremely uncomfortable.

Even with their spheres protecting them, it still felt as if they were getting burnt alive.

“Hellfire.”

Zhang Laosan knew what these flames were.
