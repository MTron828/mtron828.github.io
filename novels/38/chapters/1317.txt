1318 Killing Ning Yu

Lin Xiu, who was not very proficient in this god-level skill, now felt as if he had used this god-level skill thousands of times after directly activating the Profound Intent.

Very proficient!

“go!!!”

The White Moon spear, which had gathered 99% of Lin Xiu’s body’s source strength, swung directly into the sky!

Boom——

With a loud sound, the terrifying flames in the spear flew directly into the sky at this moment.

In an instant, the entire sky became a sea of flames!

This skill was very similar to the skill ‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’ created by Lin Xiu before.

But the fireballs produced by ‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’ were huge, like meteorites falling from the sky.

And this ‘Sky Fire Meteor’, like a dense meteor shower, hit the entire battlefield.

There is no way to dodge!

Boom, boom, boom——

At this time, the entire battle stage vibrated crazily.

“what is this!?”

As the white light slowly dissipated, the surrounding audience could clearly see that there seemed to be a dense meteor shower on the entire incomparably wide battle platform!

“what!!!”

Meteor showers covered the entire battlefield and Ning Yu, who had his ‘Sphere’ broken just now, let out a wailing cry.

He was obviously shocked by the power of this skill!

If there is a wide range of AOE skill, there is no way for him to dodge!

Hearing his wailing and screaming, Lin Xiu locked his position at that moment.

Holding the White Moon spear in his hand, he rushed directly to Ning Yu’s side!

Lin Xiu’s speed was extremely fast and when he used his body skills, he appeared in front of Ning Yu in an instant.

At this time, Ning Yu, because the meteor shower produced by ‘Sky Fire Meteor’ impacted his body, a large number of holes appeared on his body.

The whole body was burned to the point that it emitted a burning smell.

“I think…”

Looking at Lin Xiu who suddenly appeared in front of him at this time, the expression in his eyes changed drastically and he was about to admit defeat aloud.

Because he knew that if he continued to fight, he would die!

“Sorry, no chance.”

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, the White Moon spear he was holding pierced through his head at an extremely fast speed!

boom–

Blood splattered everywhere!

“Ding!”

“Congratulations, master, for killing a warrior at the level of a god warrior and gaining experience of 268948574…”

At this time, in Lin Xiu’s mind, he also clearly heard the prompt of gaining experience.

“Won… won!”

At this time, the dazzling light produced by those scale powders slowly disappeared and Lei Tong vaguely saw Lin Xiuxi’s White Moon spear piercing Ning Yu’s head!

“Won.”

Baili Haoling also showed a faint smile at the corner of his mouth at this time.

But compared to Lei Tong’s excitement, she was obviously much calmer.

Because for her, this victory is inevitable.

“This kid actually won…”

The middle-aged uncle on the seat to Baili Haoling’s left opened his mouth slightly and his eyes revealed disbelief.

Just now, the entire battlefield was filled with blinding white light and he didn’t even notice what happened.

Only an extremely loud sound could be heard.

Now as the white light dissipates, there were clusters of hellfires still burning on the entire ground.

And Lin Xiu, also holding the White Moon spear, pierced through Ning Yu’s head!

“No!!!”

Ning Tianxuan was sitting in another seat, looking at the scene in front of him, he immediately roared.

He clenched his hands tightly and his whole body trembled.

Ning Yu actually lost!

And he was directly killed on the battle platform!

His eyes looked at Lin Xiu and his eyes were full of killing intent.

“Lingxian City… Lingxian City, you are dead!!!”

At this time, Lin Xiu ignored the reaction of the audience around him and he pulled out the spear that had penetrated Ning Yu’s head.

...

And Ning Yu’s body also fell to the ground, his eyes wide open, as if he was still in disbelief till his last breath.

“Congratulations to City Lord Lingxian for bringing such a wonderful first match. In this battle, Lin Xiu, the city lord of Lingxian City, advanced!!!”

At this time, the referee, whose body was suspended in the air, said loudly.

“Lin Xiu!”

“Lin Xiu!”

“…”

Although the surrounding audience didn’t know who Lin Xiu was before, after this battle, many warriors started to cheer for Lin Xiu.

Hu——

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and immediately jumped off the battle platform.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s face was also a little pale.

After using this ‘Profound Intent·Sky fire Meteor’ just now, Lin Xiu felt as if his body’s source strength was about to be drained.

...

At this time, his body was also very weak.

“The next match will take until the afternoon, you can take a break now.”

As soon as Lin Xiu walked down, a staff member came over and smiled at Lin Xiu.

“Ok.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly, then walked to the player seating area over there and sat down.

After taking a sip of the mineral water, Lin Xiu automatically activated the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

With the operation of ‘Cultivation Technique’, the energy in the surrounding air is being quickly absorbed by Lin Xiu.

It was like a dry river slowly being filled with water at this time. Lin Xiu felt very comfortable.

“Do you know him?”

At this time, the contestants at the back also looked at Lin Xiu at the front.

“Lingxian City was just a small city before.”

“When did such a character appear, he even killed Ning Yu.”

“But this guy killed Ning Yu, I’m afraid he will be retaliated against after the match…” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“…”

Lin Xiu didn’t talk to these people on a regular basis. At this time, he still used his ‘Cultivation Technique’ with all his strength to quickly recover his source strength.

This time, a lot of source strength was consumed and it was necessary to recover quickly, otherwise it would have an impact on the battle in the afternoon.

“In the next match, Yang Fulin from Qiongtian City will face Zhao Kaiyi from Maohuo City!”

At this moment, the referee above the battle stage started announcing the next battle.

Soon, the two city lords whose names were announced also began to take to the stage.

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked at the fighters fighting on the battle platform and did not leave this side.

He looked at the battles of these god warriors and wrote down their fighting methods. It will also be beneficial to his own battles in the future.

In this first battle, he had consumed so much strength. If he didn’t study the characteristics of these people carefully, the battle will be more difficult.

Lin Xiu didn’t want to use the system’s ‘Fury’ and other skills until the finals.

After all, the cooling time is a bit long.

The game progressed very quickly and the final three-person melee was coming soon!

Although the previous matches were exciting, the last three-person melee match was the most interesting.
