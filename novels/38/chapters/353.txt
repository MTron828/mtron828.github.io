Chapter 354: Breaking the “Sphere”

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Although the wound was not deep, it still caused this person intense pain.

Luo Yue’s dagger nearly sliced his head off directly.

He shuddered at that thought.

What a terrifying girl!

“Grab her!!!” At this moment, apart from fear, his eyes were full of anger.

The other warriors came to their senses and charged towards Luo Yue!

The expression on Luo Yue’s face remained unchanged, watching those warriors charging towards her with weapons, Luo Yue kept dodging.

The weapons that the warriors swung over could not hit Luo Yue at all.

Swish swish swish——

.

And when Luo Yue dodged, she swung the dagger in her hand continuously.

“Damn it!” At the same time, the muscular man who kept attacking Lin Xiu was furious when he saw that his attacks didn’t hit Lin Xiu at all.

He thought that Lin Xiu didn’t bring his Dark edge spear when he came out tonight. At this time, looking at the man’s saber that was swinging wildly, Lin Xiu couldn’t find a good opportunity to fight back.

Bang bang bang——

When his saber swung up, the surrounding tables were directly chopped in half!

Many warriors left the pub in a hurry after witnessing this, and some warriors who seemed more powerful watched this scene with great interest.

“What’s happening?” And at this moment, a middle-aged man stepped forward and seeing this mess, his brows knitted slightly.

“Boss Deng, we’re dealing with some personal matters and we will bear the loss!” A warrior said when he saw the middle-aged man who walked out.

The middle-aged man could not help but frown.

He was the owner of this pub and of course, he knew that they were a team of warriors that often go to and fro the dark forest to find materials and sell.

And this team was pretty strong.

At this time, he looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue and was quite surprised. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Because the people in this team were dealing with only a pair of young man and lady, and it seemed that these two people were also very strong.

“Boy, don’t hide if you have guts!!!” The man yelled at this moment and his saber was about to slash Lin Xiu’s body!

Boom——

As he swung down, Lin Xiu’s voice disappeared instantly.

His saber slashed on the ground, making a huge noise, and a huge crack even appeared on the ground, showing the horror of this blade.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu’s body appeared behind this muscular man!

Crackling——

Lin Xiu appeared behind him with his fist raised high and a large number of electric lights had appeared on the fist!

From the corner of the muscular man’s eyes, he saw the light coming from behind, and the pupils in his eyes shrank.

He turned around abruptly and saw that Lin Xiu had already appeared behind him, and the fist of his right hand burst out with a large amount of electric light, and he was about to hit his body!

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate, his fist blasted directly on the man’s body!

Boom——

With a loud sound, Lin Xiu’s fist did not directly hit the man’s body but hit a layer of light blue barrier.

“Hahaha, did you think that your fist can hit me!!!” The muscular man couldn’t help laughing loudly as he watched Lin Xiu’s fist hit the unfolded ‘Sphere.

“You’re a rank 5 warrior. I can simply pinch you to death…”

The moment he spoke, his face suddenly changed.

Because Lin Xiu ignored him, then waved his fist and continued to smash his ‘Sphere’ frantically!

Boom boom——

As Lin Xiu’s fist slammed down wildly, there was a deafening sound one after another.

As Lin Xiu smashed the ‘Sphere’ frantically, he felt his body shaking slightly.

The man’s source strength was depleting quickly because of the ‘Sphere’.

Damn, how could this kid be so strong!?

If his source strength continues to deplete at this speed, he wouldn’t be able to support the ‘Sphere’.

Pa pa pa——

At the same time, there was a continuous sound ringing out and a lot of cracks appeared on the light blue barrier!

“Goodbye!” Lin Xiu snorted coldly and clenched his right fist tightly. Then, a large amount of source strength gathered on his fist.

With the continuous improvement of Lin Xiu’s strength, the ‘Sphere’ that the man unfolded was nothing to him!

At the next moment, Lin Xiu slammed his fist directly on the ‘Sphere’!

Click——

At this time, his fist hit the light blue barrier again, and the ‘circle’ was directly smashed by Lin Xiu in an instant!!!

“He could even break the ‘Sphere’?!” Boss Deng saw this scene and the look on his face changed.

He had the pub for so long and there were a number of warriors who fought in there before, some even died. But he hadn’t met anyone who could break a warrior’s ‘Sphere’ with bare hands!

And this person was clearly quite young.

“You…” The muscular man’s face was full of horror.

He could break the ‘Sphere’?!

What exactly is going on!!!

At this time, it was too late for him to react as Lin Xiu’s right fist continued to hit his body!

“Go to hell!”

Boom——

The fist with electric light directly hit the man’s abdomen, and the huge impact made his body fly like a kite with a broken string.

His muscular body smashed into the wall behind and he was directly embedded in it.

Lin Xiu curled his lips. With his current strength, he should have no problem dealing with the average rank 6 warriors.

Looking to the other side, Luo Yue was still fighting those warriors.

Under the siege of seven or eight warriors, not only was Luo Yue not at a disadvantage, she continued waving the dagger in her hand and left a series of scars on some warriors!
