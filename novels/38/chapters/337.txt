Chapter 338: Sky City- Luo Family!

Lin Xiu’s brow furrowed a little when he heard the voice coming from behind. It was obvious that he was looking for trouble.

“Let’s go.” Luo Yue said plainly and walked straight ahead, without turning her head, as if she hadn’t heard the person.

Lin Xiu heard Luo Yue’s words and walked ahead, completely ignoring the man.

The man’s face suddenly changed and became extremely gloomy.

In the next moment, he exerted force and rushed directly to the front!

His speed was very fast and instantly with the sound of a ‘swish’, he rushed in front of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

“I told you two to stop, didn’t you hear me!” The middle-aged man blocked them and looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue with a gloomy expression.

He found Lin Xiu and Luo Yue so arrogant that they ignored him.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, looked at the middle-aged man standing in front of him and said faintly.

“Hng!” The middle-aged man snorted coldly, then pointed at Luo Yue and said, “Is she the one who swallowed the energy of the ice lotus fire!?”

The moment he exclaimed, the other warriors walked over and immediately surrounded Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

Lin Xiu saw this scene and couldn’t help clenching the Dark Edge spear in his hand tightly.

These people obviously just wanted to find trouble.

“Ah Zhong, is she the one?” At this time, one of the warriors looked at Luo Yue and asked the man next to him.

“It’s the two of them!” The warrior looked at Luo Yue and Lin Xiu then said with certainty.

He saw warriors being killed by Luo Huatian and already knew the horror of Luo Huatian’s strength, so he ran without hesitation.

But he didn’t expect to bump into Luo Yue and Lin Xiu again and the terrifying Luo Huatian wasn’t here!

“I saw it – she swallowed the ice lotus fire!” At this moment, he pointed at Luo Yue then continued to say aloud.

There was still a hint of shock in his eyes.

Because he saw that after Luo Yue swallowed the ice lotus fire, she sat down cross-legged like she was digesting the energy of the ice lotus fire.

He thought it was impossible for Luo Yue to swallow the energy of this ice lotus fire. After all, the energy of this ice lotus fire was really terrifying, even a rank 8 warrior might not be able to swallow this Ice lotus fire fully.

And if it is not swallowed successfully, it may cause a backlash effect. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

But now it appeared that Luo Yue had successfully absorbed the energy of the ice lotus fire, otherwise she would have been dead by now.

At this time, the surrounding warriors looked towards Luo Yue.

All of them were high-ranking warriors which made Lin Xiu feel a little stressed.

However, Luo Yue still appeared very calm.

“So what?” Luo Yue glanced at them, then said faintly.

“You haven’t completely swallowed the energy of the ice lotus fire, right?” The middle-aged man said in a sullen voice.

“The energy of the ice lotus fire is huge, it is impossible to be swallowed completely in such a short time.”

At this time, the rest of the people also suddenly realized that what he said made sense.

“And then?” Luo Yue raised her brows then said faintly.

“Then?” The middle-aged man saw that Luo Yue didn’t show any fear even now and he burst into laughter, “Then, you will hand over all the remaining energy of the ice lotus fire!!!”

The moment he spoke, the saber in his hand swung violently towards Luo Yue!

He wanted to cut Luo Yue’s body in half then absorb the remaining ice lotus fire energy that has not been completely absorbed in Luo Yue’s body!

Swish——

As his saber swung, the blade cut through the air anytime.

The speed of the saber was very fast, like a white glow, slashing towards Luo Yue’s body!

“Be careful!” Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted when he saw this scene.

This person was a rank 7 warrior and his speed was incredible.

Dang–

But at this moment, Luo Yue quickly swung her long sword and blocked the man’s attack.

The long sword collided with his saber, giving off a clear sound.

“Sky City, Luo Family.” Luo Yue glanced at the other warriors who were about to attack and said indifferently.

Some warriors wanted to kill Luo Yue and get the remaining energy of the ice lotus fire that had not been completely absorbed in her body, but when they heard Luo Yue’s words, their expressions changed.

Swish——

Just then, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand had already pierced the body of the middle-aged man who attacked Luo Yue!

The spear was like a cold light. The second it was about to stab the man’s body, it turned into dozens of black shadows and rushed over.

Bang bang bang——

There was a hint of surprise in the middle-aged man’s eyes then, a light blue protective shield suddenly appeared around him.

The dozens of shots that Lin Xiu stabbed in a short moment all hit the light blue barrier.

‘Sphere’!

The middle-aged man reacted very quickly and unfolded ‘sphere’ to protect his body, but the huge impact generated by Lin Xiu’s attack sent his body flying.

He used all his strength to stand on the ground and managed to stop retreating back.

“Everyone, I’ll get going first, goodbye.” At the same time, one of the warriors who had been watching, cupped his fists and said aloud to the surrounding warriors, then left immediately.

The expressions of the rest of the people also changed and of course, they understood what kind of people the Luo Family in the Sky City was.

And these people looked at Luo Yue carefully and seemed to have thought of something when their expressions became even more anxious.

“We were as blind as a bat, sorry.” Some warriors said to Luo Yue at this moment and left.
