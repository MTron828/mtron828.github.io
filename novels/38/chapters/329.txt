Chapter 330: Blood Spurting

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Zhang Jie was really too strong and Luo Yue felt a bit of tightness in her chest.

She wiped the blood off the sides of her lips and stood up, then forcefully pulled out the long sword that was stuck in the ground.

“Why, still not admitting defeat, huh?” Zhang Jie had a pair of daggers in her hands as she looked towards Luo Yue and said faintly.

Zhang Jie didn’t seem affected by the impact of the collision of skills. She looked straight at Luo Yue and said in a cold voice.

Luo Yue ignored Zhang Jie’s words, still staring at her coldly, her eyes full of murderous intent.

“This time I won’t just abolish your skill like the previous time; this time, I’m going to kill you.” Zhang Jie licked her red lips and revealed a sinister smile.

The moment she said that, she rushed towards Luo Yue all of a sudden!

Swish swish swish——

This time, she clearly used all her strength and her speed had reached the extreme!

In a short moment, she was in front of Luo Yue and the daggers in her hands slashed directly towards Luo Yue.

Her blades cut through the air.

Dang dang dang——

Luo Yue waved the long sword in her hand constantly and refused to admit defeat as she fought Zhang Jie.

“Go to hell!”

But Zhang Jie was too fast. At the next moment, the dagger in Zhang Jie’s right hand collided with Luo Yue’s long sword and the dagger in her left hand slashed Luo Yue’s neck!

Luo Yue’s expression changed but it was too late to react now!

Dang——

But at this crucial moment, the dagger she stabbed towards Luo Yue’s neck was already blocked!

A spearhead, a Dark Edge Spearhead blocked her dagger!

Zhang Jie glanced to the side and saw that Lin Xiu had appeared.

And the two double rings that were attacking Lin Xiu had disappeared.

“Damn it!” Zhang Jie screamed then suddenly exploded with even more terrifying power.

Boom——

With her as the center, a huge force burst out in an instant.

Luo Yue and Lin Xiu were both sent flying from the huge impact.

Bang——

Both of them knocked against the branches of the trees behind.

What the hell is going on... How could this person suddenly burst out with such a powerful force?

Lin Xiu looked at Zhang Jie with eyes full of shock and said to himself.

His back was in severe pain from knocking against the tree.

But before Lin Xiu returned to his senses, he saw a figure rushing towards him and a cold light appeared in front of him instantly.

Too late to dodge!

Bang——

A dagger pierced into Lin Xiu’s forehead and went through his head!

“Hng, go to hell.” Zhang Jie growled grimly.

But when she stabbed Lin Xiu’s head with a dagger, she found that a scene similar to the one just now.

At this moment, it was as if she had stabbed a puppet but no blood spurted out at all.

And the body of ‘Lin Xiu’ also gave off a loud ‘bang’ before it turned into a cloud of smoke and disappeared. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Boom——

Just when Zhang Jie was puzzled, a loud noise rang out. She turned around and saw huge phoenixes charging towards her directly!

Bang bang bang——

The phoenixes were like a series of meteorites, hitting Zhang Jie’s body non-stop.

Everything around her turned into a sea of ??flames.

“Almost got killed.” Lin Xiu appeared on the other side as he looked at the phoenixes in the distance.

At that critical moment, Lin Xiu reacted quickly and used the last ‘Mirror Image’ to dodge the attack.

But right now, would the ‘Awe of the phoenix’ be enough to… kill her?

“No, you can’t kill her like that.” Luo Yue walked over from the other side and said to Lin Xiu like she knew what he was thinking.

“Still can’t kill her?” Lin Xiu was taken aback. At this moment, as the flame slowly dissipated, Lin Xiu could clearly see that Zhang Jie’s body already had a light blue circular protective shield. The ordinary things surrounded her body.

Those flames didn’t seem to affect Zhang Jie at all.

Damn, this person actually unfolded the ‘Sphere’?!

Lin Xiu squeezed the Dark Edge Spear with both hands.

If he was also a rank 6 warrior now, it wouldn’t be so strenuous.

Because after a rank 6 warrior can unfold the ‘Sphere’, he would be able to withstand many attacks.

“Tsk tsk tsk, do you guys really think a rank 5 and a rank 6 warrior would be a match for me?” Zhang Jie’s eyes were frosty as she gave Lin Xiu and Luo Yue a sinister grin.

She cracked her knuckles at this moment.

Then rushed directly to Lin Xiu!

It was obvious now that she wants to deal with Lin Xiu first.

Because she could sense that Lin Xiu’s power, although not very strong, was very strange.

She could sense some danger.

Slap——

Lin Xiu hasn’t come to his senses yet. In this short moment, Zhang Jie had already appeared in front of him.

The daggers in her hands slashed directly towards Lin Xiu.

A clear sound rang out instantly.

The scales on the fire-scale armor got cut off!

Dang——

Lin Xiu was shocked. He didn’t expect Zhang Jie to be so fast and the dagger in her hand was so sharp!

But it was too late for Lin Xiu to dodge because the dagger in Zhang Jie’s hand slashed into Lin Xiu’s body again!

As the strongest part of the fire-scale armor has been cut off, if he got cut by her again, he would be in trouble!

Dang——

Lin Xiu wanted to block her attacks with his Dark Edge Spear but he didn’t expect that the daggers in her hands were so terrifyingly strong.

At this moment, the Dark Edge Spear got knocked out of his hand.

Her dagger could slash Lin Xiu’s body easily. This time, Lin Xiu couldn’t use ‘Mirror Image’ anymore.

Blood spurted out in a flash!
