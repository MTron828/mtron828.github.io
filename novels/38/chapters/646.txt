Chapter 647: A One-Sided Situation! ?

Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Tt seems that your strength is indeed stronger.”

At this moment, Nan Huang stood there and didn’t move, looked at Lin Xiu and said lightly.

Lin Xiu also stood there and looked at him, his eyes full of killing intent.

“But if you want to kill me, your strength is not enough.”

Nan Huang shook his head and said arrogantly.

“Today, you must die.”

Lin Xiu stared at him and said lightly.

It was the same when he was in the Thunder Valley. It seemed that when he met someone like him, killing him was as simple as crushing an ant.

“You go to deal with that woman. You cannot participate in the battle between me and him.”

When Nan Huang heard Lin Xiu’s words, killing intent burst out in his eyes. He looked at Yu Muchen who was not far from him and said.

Lin Xiu’s words provoked his dignity, and he would use Lin Xiu’s blood to wash it away!

Yu Muchen hesitated for a moment, then holding his Heaven Painted Halberd, he attacked Baili Haoling!

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu’s side at this time. At this time, she carried her long sword and attacked Baili Haoling with the other two warriors!

At this moment, it became a four-on-one situation.

“Interesting.”

Baili Haoling licked her lips, and a murderous look appeared in her eyes. She pulled out two knives from her waist. She was not afraid at all, but became a little excited.

“Hmph, she’s dead!”

The vice president of Sky City watched the four of them attack Baili Haoling at the same time, and he suddenly let out a sneer.

Bai Litao, who was in the seat not far away, looked at the scene on the field with his eyes and frowned slightly, but didn’t say much.

“Chen Jin, you attack the right wing!

Yu Muchen said to one of the men.

Just now, he thought he could easily defeat Baili Haoling, but he didn’t expect that Baili Haoling would be so terrifying with her dual knives.

She held double knives and it was as if they were two people as the two long knives attacked them frantically!

Especially Yu Muchen was attacked by Baili Haoling.

He was holding the Heaven Painted Halberd and under the close-range attack of Baili Haoling, he was very uncomfortable.

And what surprised him even more was that Baili Haoling’s power was stronger than him!

Seeing those people from the Sky Academy continue to attack him, Baili Haoling’s hands became even faster.

“You’re using a spear?”

At this time, Nan Huang looked at the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand, and said lightly.

Because he also uses a spear!

“You also have a spear.”

Before Lin Xiu could react, he continued to speak coldly.

In the next moment, Nan Huang directly held the spear in his hand and charged towards Lin Xiu!

Compared with ordinary long spears, the spear in his hand was more slender, and the tip of the spear was thicker.

Andat this time, there was a faint golden light on the tip of his spear, which seemed to have powerful energy fluctuations.

Lin Xiu looked at the Nan Huang who was rushing towards him with a spear. At this moment, his eyes widened, and his source strength was mobilized!

Boom-

When the two weapons collided, there was a loud noise.

The powerful impact made Lin Xiu involuntarily take a few steps back, and the hands holding the spear even felt a slight numbness.

‘What a powerful force.

‘Awe of the phoenix’!!!

However, Lin Xiu was not afraid at all, instead he held his Dark Edge spear and attacked him!

Boom boom boom —

One after another, the flaming birds charged towards Nan Huang!

Nan Huang sneered, and as soon as his body moved, he dodged directly.

The next moment, he continued to stab Lin Xiu with the spear in his hand!

The spear contained extremely terrifying power, and the head of his spear was actually filled with golden light.

Lin Xiu resisted with his Dark Edge spear, but the power of Nan Huang’s attack was extremely powerful compared to the previous attack.

Boom-

Lin Xiu felt a tightness in his chest, and he flew out.

“This kid really isn’t Nan Huang’s opponent.”

“I didn’t expect it to be a one-sided situation.”

“Hey, it’s getting boring.”

“Sky Academy is still too powerful.”

Looking at the battle on the scene, some viewers couldn’t help but say aloud.

It seemed that this disparity in power made them feel uninterested.

“Too weak.”

Nan Huang looked at Lin Xiu who flew out, and did not continue chasing, but shook his head and said arrogantly.

Lin Xiu stabilized his body at this time, wiped the blood from his lips, and there was a serious look in his eyes.

This person’s strength seemed to be of the ninth rank!

Just by confronting him, Lin Xiu could feel the terrifying power emanating from his weapon.

And his weapons were not ordinary.

“Interesting.”

Lin Xiu didn’t have the slightest fear, instead he had a strong fighting spirit.

The previous battles were all too simple, so Lin Xiu didn’t have much desire to fight.

Nan Huang watched Lin Xiu who didnt fear of his strength, but was full of fighting intent. Lin Xiu looked at him as if he had seen prey.

This feeling made Nan Huang’s brows wrinkle, because he was the hunter!

At this moment, Lin Xiu raised his right hand, and suddenly a ray of light radiated from Lin Xiu’s body, and then covered the entire platform.

‘Heavenly Array’!

With the use of this skill, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that his power was rapidly increasing.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, looked at Nan Huang who was not far away, and rushed over!

“Go to hell!”

On the other side, because Baili Haoling was attacked by the four members of the Sky Academy, several wounds appeared on her body at this time.

Although she used two knives, she was still unable to resist the attack of the four.

And under their constant attacks, Baili Haoling doesn’t seem to even have the chance to use the source field.

At this time, Yu Muchen held the Heaven Painted Halberd in his hand and attacked Baili Haoling head on again!

Baili Haoling wanted to resist, but found that someone else was attacking her! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Yu Muchen looked at Baili Haoling, as if he was going to use his own weapon to kill Baili Haoling!

“Get lost!”

But at this moment, the expression in her eyes changed drastically. With a loud shout, a strong aura made Yu Muchen fly out!

Dang dang-

The long knife she held in both hands directly blocked the attacks of Luo Yue and others.

“You are my apprentice’s wife, right? You go take a break first.”

Baili Haoling looked at Luo Yue who was attacking, and rushed over.

She inserted the two knives back into the scabbard instantly, and slapped Luo Yue in the air!

Boom—
