Chapter 108: Enter!

“I will consider.” Lin Xiu nodded.

“I’ll come and find you when we get off the train.” Tian Zhi saw that Lin Xiu didn’t seem like he wanted to continue the discussion and knew when to leave him alone.

Lin Xiu closed the carriage door and closed his eyes.

If he didn’t have a good rest, it would be troublesome if he encountered any danger later.

Also, he wasn’t sure if that Black Tiger Bandit gang would appear again later. If they did, it would be equivalent to giving him free experience points.

Time went by quickly, and not long after Lin Xiu closed his eyes, this ultra-high-speed maglev train began to slow down to a stop.

The broadcast in the carriage also alerted the passengers that they had arrived.

Lin Xiu pushed open the door and immediately saw Tian Zhi there.

“We’ve arrived, let’s get off,” Tian Zhi said with a smile.

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu nodded and walked with a huge box on his back.

“By the way, what’s your name?” Tian Zhi asked.

“Lin Xiu,” Lin Xiu replied plainly.

After what happened with Lei Liang and the others, Lin Xiu became more cautious and now he did not say much to people he wasn’t very familiar with.

Walking along the passageway, he could see that there were still some bloodstains that couldn’t be removed, many people probably died.

Tian Zhi was walking behind Lin Xiu and sizing him up when he saw the strange wooden box behind his back and got curious.

‘Is this box loaded with weapons?’

As soon as they got off the train, they could smell a strange smell in the air.

From this side, they could already see a lot of rusty metal houses on the opposite side and as the people got off the train, the place became lively.

“The starting point of the Path of Death, the only place where people live, the Black Iron City.” Tian Zhi was standing next to Lin Xiu as he introduced Lin Xiu to the area.

Lin Xiu nodded and continued walking. The ground was ordinary cement, although those tin houses looked shabby, each tin house had people living inside.

But the facilities inside looked backward and the whole place looked like a slum.

“Boy, the Path of Death is not a place you should go. Just take a look here or you might not be able to return alive.” A tall, thin man, who had also got off the train, glanced at Lin Xiu and laughed.

“Seems like these people want to make money by hunting evolved beasts in the Path of Death. There are a lot of them every year, but almost all of them die there.” Tian Zhi heard the man’s sarcastic words, then frowned and said to Lin Xiu.

“Roar!!!” Just then, a giant dog suddenly appeared from the corner and pounced onto the tall, thin man who was laughing at Lin Xiu. In the next second, it opened its bloody mouth and revealed a mouthful of white fangs, then tear the man’s neck instantly!

The whole scene was exceptionally bloody and those who had just got off the train were frightened by this scene.

“That’s the way it is here. There will be evolved beasts charging to this side from time to time.” Tian Zhi had an awful look on his face at this moment too. Seeing the man’s neck being bitten off at such close proximity and blood bursting out was too horrifying.

In fact, those people who just got off the train scattered like birds and beasts. On the contrary, the residents here seemed to be very calm like they were used to these scenes already.

After the mutated giant dog bit the tall, thin man to death, those pair of blood-thirsty eyes directly turned to Lin Xiu like he was about to pounce on him!

“Be careful!” Tian Zhi had already taken his weapon out, a wide-back machete!

Lin Xiu scoffed. This mutated giant dog was just a rank 2 evolved beast, he wasn’t afraid at all.

Lin Xiu stared at the mutated giant dog and it seemed to sense a strong aura. At this moment, its hairs stood on its ends.

As though it was confronted by a formidable enemy!

“Roar!” As Lin Xiu took a step forward, the mutated giant dog seemed to be enraged and pounced on Lin Xiu!

Bang——

Lin Xiu raised his brows, his right leg went across and he threw a punch with his right fist!

The gloves on the fist turned red at this moment!

His fist directly hit the neck of the mutated giant dog and the strong impact sent it flying more than a dozen meters away before it hit the wall and fell to the ground.

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 2 evolved beast! You’ve gained 10,000 experience!”

Only 10,000 experience ah… Lin Xiu curled his lips – it was too little.

Tian Zhi was dumbfounded and his machete that was raised high didn’t even have time to attack and that mutated giant dog was already killed by Lin Xiu.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu glanced at him and walked ahead. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“Wait for me!” Tian Zhi hurried behind him at this moment.

Many people that came down from the same train saw Lin Xiu’s performance just now and their expressions changed.

Walking on the ground here, Lin Xiu felt as if he was walking on the previous world he transmigrated from.

There were black tin houses everywhere and many bones on the ground, the whole town had a strange atmosphere.

“Keep walking ahead, and you’ve entered the Path of Death.” Tian Zhi walked beside Lin Xiu and told him.

Lin Xiu nodded and looked ahead. It was an endless land that was in a blackish-blue shade in front and there were a large number of black stone columns in the middle like a hill, blocking the view.

The grass that grew on the blackish-blue land was also blackish-blue in color and looked really unusual.

‘This place… Is the Path of Death?’

“Do you know anyone who went to the end of the Path of Death?” Lin Xiu asked Tian Zhi.

“The end of the Path of Death?” Tian Zhi was stunned, then he said with a bitter smile, “Unless you’re a high-ranking warrior, reaching the first half of the Path of Death is already unbearable.”

“There is almost no water or wood inside, it’s hard to even hunt an evolved beast and cook it. But I’ve been here before and got everything ready.” Tian Zhi patted the big canvas bag on his back proudly.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu looked behind, there were many people who got off the train that was walking towards this direction too, they were probably going into the Path of death too.

After all, there was a saying:?If you want strength, wealth, and treasures, come to the Path of death!
