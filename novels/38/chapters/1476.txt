1477 The power of all people, the final blow!

At this time, everyone’s eyes looked at the projection, and they could clearly see that there was a light blooming out of the bottomless hole that was blown out!

What’s this!?

Riyan Noble God and the others looked at this scene, and their eyes were also full of shock.

“The power of the earth…”

Luo Yue seemed to have discovered something, and there was surprise in her eyes at this time.

It seems that Lin Xiu is absorbing the power of the earth!

The source energy on the earth was being continuously absorbed by Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu used this skill before!

Which meant that Lin Xiu is not dead at all!

“Isn’t he dead?”

Tianyin was frantically absorbing the power of those planets in the universe.

At this time, his eyes looked into a huge pit that was blasted out, and he clearly saw traces of white light blooming.

And these white lights seem to be getting more and more dazzling.

Lin Xiu’s figure slowly floated in the next moment.

‘Ultimate·Source Strength Control’!

After upgrading to the highest level, Lin Xiu chose to evolve this skill to the highest level!

At this time, with Lin Xiu’s thought, all the source strength on the earth gathered towards his body!

Whether it’s an animal or a plant, their bodies would contain some source strength.

At this time, all the source strength was absorbed by Lin Xiu.

There are more and more dots of white light.

All of them quickly gathered towards Lin Xiu!

“He absorbed the source strength of the entire planet…!?”

Everyone’s eyes widened.

Give me all your strength!

Lin Xiu closed his eyes as if he could feel the source strength of the entire dilapidated earth.

The source strength of a large number of dead warriors evaporated into the air, but at this moment, they all converged on Lin Xiu’s body.

Lin Xiu’s body began to be covered by dazzling white light.

“Even if you absorb the power of the entire earth, you are no match for me at all!”

Looking at this scene, Tianyin let out a sinister laugh.

He opened his mouth wide. At this moment, those terrifying dark red forces rushed towards Lin Xiu again!

Lin Xiu looked at this scene, and stabbed him in the air with the spear in his hand!

Boom——

Immediately, a wave of white energy directly impacted the past!

It collided with the dark red energy that he spewed out, and a loud noise erupted!

The white energy and the dark red energy collided crazily, and the surrounding space kept trembling.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered, and dozens of his own clones suddenly appeared.

These avatars held the weapons in their hands at the same time, bursting out white energy, which converged with the white energy released by Lin Xiu’s body.

This made the white energy ray released by Lin Xiu even more powerful!

But even so, they still couldn’t suppress the dark red energy that Tianyin spewed out.

“Not enough! The source strength is still too little!”

One of the god kings looked at this scene and couldn’t help but speak out.

The earth, after all, is just a particle world, and the entire planet has too little power.

“There are still ten minutes! The energy of Tianyin is about to spread towards the God warrior Realm!”

Noble God Riyan looked at the projected screen at this time, and his face became extremely ugly.

At this time, he raised hsi eyes and looked into the sky, and he was able to see the entire sky above, as if there was a dark red energy spreading over it!

“It’s over…”

The faces of the other god kings also became extremely ugly.

Soon, the entire God warrior Realm will be surrounded by these energies!

And they will also be drained of power!

“What should we do now!?”

God King Tianling said.

“There is no way.”

Noble God Riyan gave a wry smile.

The energy released by Tianyin was really terrifying.

There was no way to resist at all.

“Unless he can win.”

“Impossible, the earth’s energy is not enough, unless it also absorbs the energy of other planets like the sky.”

However, this is also an impossible thing.

Damn it!

At this moment, Lin Xiu was looking at the dark red energy suppressing the white energy he released, and it was about to come toward him!

Not enough! Source strength is not enough!!!

“Boy, unless you can absorb the power of the entire universe, you won’t be able to defeat me!!!”

Tianyin’s voice echoed directly in Lin Xiu’s head.

What he was absorbing now was the power of the entire universe!

Who can resist his power!

“What is the power of the universe…”

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something at this time, and his eyes suddenly widened.

Spatial Magic Cube!!!

With a thought, the Spatial Magic Cube appeared instantly.

Planet Marqi!

This was the first time he looked for Luo Yue’s planet after leaving the earth!

Planet Namir!

The planet he went to in order to avenge the Ye family!

Dark planet!

The planet he went to in order to find Luo Yue’s brother and avoid the God kings’ attacks!

God warrior Realm!

The planet he went to after becoming a God warrior!

With the triggering of his thoughts, space cracks opened up in the surroundings.

“Xiao Lin! An Qi! Can you hear me!”

As soon as Lin Xiu triggered his thoughts, the sound was sent in along with the broken space crack.

“I need to use the power of your planet and release all your source strength!”

Planet Marqi.

An Qi and Xiao Lin, who were training, seemed to have heard something.

“It seems to be… the voice of the master?”

An Qi opened her eyes, and there was a look of surprise in her eyes.

“look!”

Xiao Lin raised her finger and pointed to the sky.

Taking a closer look, there was a dazzling light in the sky, and a huge hole was actually broken.

“‘I need to use the power of your planet and release all your source strength!’!”

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s voice came over again.

“It’s really the voice of the master!”

An Qi and Xiao Lin were surprised at this time.

The source strength in the surrounding air was quickly absorbed by the space crack.

“Everyone, release your source strength directly!!!”

An Qi and Xiao Lin’s current strength is already at the level of Respected warrior!

On Marqi planet, it was already top-notch.

As their news spread, a large number of warriors released their source strength without hesitation.

“Brother Lin Xiu… are you back?”

Liu Pan, who was killing a powerful evolved beast on the Marqi planet, seemed to be surprised when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

“Did you encounter some difficult opponent?”

He raised his eyes to look at the huge space crack in the sky, and released all the strength in his body at this time.

If the warrior does not take the initiative to release all the source strength of the body, the source strength absorbed will be very little!

After all, this was a large-scale absorption from the space crack.

The planet Namir.

In the sky, a huge space was opened.

Just when everyone was terrified, Wang Qiang seemed to sense something, and his face was filled with surprise.

The time over there was different from that in the God warrior Realm, not sure how many years have passed.

At this time, Wang Qiang has also grown into a powerful warrior of the Sage warrior level.

On the planet Namir, he was also considered very powerful.

“Master’s voice!”

“Everyone, release all the source strength!!!”

Wang Qiang roared loudly.

“Master…!?”

Ye Kai was cuddling a child to sleep. He seemed to feel something at this moment, and looked into the sky.

Sima Qiang, Zhao Yongyuan and others also showed surprise at this time.

Lin Xiu, are you back??

“Are you in trouble?”

Ye Lao’s body was suspended in the sky, looking at the incomparably huge space crack, at this moment he stroked his beard, and a large amount of source strength on his body was released directly.

The dark planet.

“It’s not good, people from the God warrior Realm are here again!”

Looking at the space crack in the sky at this moment, everyone’s eyes were filled with shock.

“Don’t panic, it’s Lin Xiu’s voice.”

Luo Huatian, who was in charge of the construction work, seemed to feel something at this time, and suddenly smiled.

“Benefactor!?”

Some people from the dark planet knew about Lin Xiu and killed all the people from the Tianshen Pavilion who messed up on the dark planet!

“He must have encountered some trouble, everyone, don’t be afraid, release all the source strength in your body!”

Luo Huatian said loudly.

God warrior Realm.

“Does he want our source strength?”

At this time, God King Tianling looked at a huge space crack that appeared in the sky, and said subconsciously.

A large amount of strong source strength from the God warrior Realm was constantly being absorbed.

But the source strength gathered was still too little.

It was very difficult to absorb the source strength of other warriors across space.

“Order all warriors in our continent will release their own source strength! Do not keep it!”

God King Tianling said aloud at this time.

“Go!”

The rest of the god kings looked at each other at this time, and instantly broke through the space and disappeared in place.

Luo Yue raised her hand to face the space crack, directly released the source strength in her body, and rushed towards the space crack!

“I’m coming too!”

Baili Haoling also said aloud at this time.

“It seems to be… Lin Xiu’s voice!”

Lei Tong and Mr. Pang looked at the huge space crack in the sky, and there was surprise in their eyes.

It didn’t matter that much, their power was also released towards the space crack at this time.

“Lin…Xiu!!!”

At this time, Rollie also called out with a childish voice, and its whole body glowed with white light.

The strength of the body was released without reservation.

Xiaobai also raised his head to the sky and let out a long roar, a large amount of white energy was released into the air.

“It must be absorbed…”

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth at this moment.

The asteroids that appear to be devoured by Tianyin were those asteroids with low energy. He must gather enough powerful energy, otherwise it will not be enough.

“Not enough! The source strength absorbed across space is too little!”

Zhu Long also roared at this time.

Under Lin Xiu’s idea, the Spatial Magic Cube spun out crazily.

In an instant, more and more space cracks appeared around them, connecting a large number of unknown planets.

But the source strength from those unknown planets was too little.

As the Spatial Magic Cube continued to rotate, at the next moment, the entire Spatial Magic Cube burst!

Still…isn’t enough…

Lin Xiu’s heart sank when he saw this scene.

The source strength gathered now was not even enough to withstand Tian Yin’s attack!

“Master! Can you hear me!”

“We’re releasing the source strength now!”

At this moment, a voice came from the space crack.

The space crack on Marqi planet suddenly had a lot of source strength, forming a huge white light, which rushed toward Lin Xiu’s body in an instant!

A lot!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened at this time!

Next, there is the planet Namir!

“Master, here it is!”

Wang Qiang led thousands of warriors and stood under the space crack.

The energy was even stronger!

Dark planet!

God warrior Realm!

The God King of Nine Continents led a large number of fighters in this continent, directly floating in the space crack.

“It’s all on you!!!”

God King Tianling roared, white light erupted from his whole body, and surged directly towards the space crack above his head!

What’s this?!

Tian Yin watched more and more white energy continuously gather on Lin Xiu’s body from the space crack, and the expression in his eyes couldn’t help changing drastically.

“Die!!!”

At this time, he stretched out his hands, facing Lin Xiu’s position, released white and dark red energy, and continued to charge toward Lin Xiu!

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s entire body was covered by a white light ball!

Those dark red energies collided with his white energies, and they couldn’t have any effect at all!

With greater energy and momentum, Lin Xiu’s whole body burst into dazzling white light.

It was as if a gigantic sun had appeared above the earth.

From coming to the earth in the future world, all the cultivation and battles seemed to come to mind.

This journey has been exhausting, and there was almost no stopping.

Today, it’s time to put an end to it!

“The sky is overcast!”

Lin Xiu opened his closed eyes at this moment.

A large number of skills flashed in my mind: ‘Awe of the phoenix’ ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ ‘Adjudicate’ ‘Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall’ ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’ ‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’ ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’ ‘Tiger on the Ground’ ‘Clean Sweep’ ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’ ‘Silence’ ‘Freezing the Distance’…

A large number of skills that Lin Xiu had learned were replayed in his mind.

The spear in his hand clanked.

“Zhu Long! Time to go!!!”

Lin Xiu roared angrily, holding a black spear full of dazzling white light in both hands, at this moment, he charged toward Tianyin directly! T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Roar–

Zhu Long let out a roar, which made the entire spear seem to be even more powerful.

Lin Xiu, with that endless white light, rushed towards Tianyin!

Those dark red energies couldn’t resist Lin Xiu at this moment!
