Chapter 785: Direct Devouring

At this moment, as Sun Zi’s voice just fell, the remaining warriors rushed towards Lin Xiu at this moment!

“You guys back away!”

Because of the powerful strength that Lin Xiu showed just now, these warriors directly used those powerful skills at this moment.

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed, then he said loudly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Liu Pan and others also knew that if they were still here, it would be a burden to Lin Xiu, so they stepped back at this time.

boom boom boom —

The skills used by these master warrior-level warriors are very powerful and at this moment, the surrounding ground can’t help shaking.

On the ground, many cracks appeared in an instant.

“Humph! Boy, how dare you struggle!”

Sun Zi watched Lin Xiu directly use his ‘Sphere’ to block these skills and couldn’t help but sneer.

It’s just that the eyes of the old man beside him changed slightly.

Because the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded turned out to be dark red.

Generally, ‘Spheres’ with other colors have other attributes.

crackling-

Some warriors’ weapons attacked Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ and a strange sound suddenly erupted.

On Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, there were many strange lightning bolts that burst out directly, then spread to their bodies.

As those bolts of lightning spread to their bodies, their expressions suddenly changed slightly.

Because they felt waves of numbness in their bodies.

boom boom boom —

And at this time, Lin Xiu had once again waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

The terrifying flaming birds burst out at this moment. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The flaming birds’ temperature was extremely high and hot sweat instantly appeared on Sun Zi’s forehead not far away.

Seeing that the flaming birds were about to hit the bodies of those warriors, at this moment, the old man moved.

Whizzing–

His movements were very fast and he instantly appeared in front of those warriors.

Without any weapons in his hands, he waved his hands to directly extinguish the flaming birds released by Lin Xiu!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s expression suddenly changed.

What’s happening?!

He didn’t even realize what was going on just now, his own flame was directly extinguished by this old man!?

You must know that those flaming birds belong to the fire of the fire lotus and their temperature is extremely terrifying!

“A bunch of trash, step back!”

The old man gave a cold drink at this time and the surrounding warriors quickly backed away to Sun Zi’s side.

“Boy, what method did you use to hide your strength?

The old man looked at Lin Xiu opposite and said coldly.

His tone was full of pride.

“I have to tell you just because you asked?”

Lin Xiu sneered.

“You have to know that there are some people in the world that you cannot afford to offend.”

The old man seemed to have long known that Lin Xiu would say such a thing, but he was not angry at this time and said indifferently.

As soon as he finished speaking, the source strength of his body was mobilized.

swoosh—

Before Lin Xiu could react, his body appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

It’s like teleportation!

Boom—

He raised his hand and punched directly, hitting Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’!

With a loud noise, Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ seemed to shake violently.

In the next moment, Lin Xiu flew out.

“Master!”

“Brother Lin!”

Seeing this scene, Liu Pan and the others couldn’t help exclaiming.

The strength of this old man is too terrifying, Lin Xiu has already unfolded the “Sphere” and he was able to blast Lin Xiu directly out.

boom–

Lin Xiu’s body slammed into the giant tree behind, breaking the giant tree.

However, Lin Xiu quickly got up again.

Although there was a ‘Sphere’ protection, Lin Xiu still felt an extremely powerful impact.

His chest was tight, his throat was sweet and in the next moment, a mouthful of blood was spat out.

“Boy, hand over the item and I will spare you your life.”

The old man stared at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

In his opinion, although Lin Xiu’s strength is good, compared to his words, there is still a huge difference.

The difference between King warrior and Master warrior was huge.

Lin Xiu sneered and after wiping the blood from his lips, he took out the odd crystal of the Raging Flame Lion.

It was a fiery red odd and it looked very beautiful.

“That’s it! That’s it! It’s mine!”

Looking at the fiery red crystal in Lin Xiu’s hand, Sun Zi said excitedly.

“Bring it over.”

The old man stretched out his hand at this time and said lightly.

From his point of view, Lin Xiu must have admitted defeat.

After all, in the face of absolute power, no matter how much you resist, it is useless.

But at this moment, a look of disdain appeared on Lin Xiu’s cheeks.

Holding the odd crystal of the Raging Flame Lion in his hand, he swallowed it directly into his mouth.

Gulp—

Seeing this scene, Sun Zi froze.

And the old man was stunned. He didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would dare to swallow the odd crystal directly!

“Boy, courting death!!!”

The old man looked at Lin Xiu’s actions and at this time he was also furious.

The source strength in the body was released and the surrounding ground seemed to start to vibrate.

swoosh—

As soon as the old man moved, he appeared in front of Lin Xiu again, raising his hand to attack Lin Xiu’s body.

However, Lin Xiu, who was already prepared, kept dodging his body at this time.

The ‘Sphere’ still remained.

Because the strength of this old man is too strong, if there is no protection of the ‘Sphere’ and he got punched like this, his bones would be shattered.

Is this the strength of a King warrior?

boom–

And when Lin Xiu was dodging, he also hit the Sphere with his fist again.

With a loud noise, Lin Xiu’s body suddenly retreated several steps.

The whole ‘Sphere’ vibrated violently.

This old man is a boxer.

And his strength is still very powerful, the power of a punch felt as if he wanted to smash his ‘Sphere’!

“Uncle Yan, kill him! Kill him!”

At this moment, Sun Zi shouted loudly with a ghastly face.

“I’m going to cut him open!”

“Take out the odd crystal!!!”

It wasn’t long after Lin Xiu devoured the odd Crystal, so he could just kill Lin Xiu and take the odd Crystal that had not been absorbed from Lin Xiu’s body!

The old man’s eyes were also full of killing intent at this time.

Originally, even if Lin Xiu handed over the odd crystal, he would kill Lin Xiu, but now Lin Xiu’s actions have made him unabashedly reveal a terrifying killing intent.
