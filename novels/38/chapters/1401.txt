1402 Divine Soul of the Spear

‘Profound Intent·Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

At this time, as Lin Xiu used his skills, all the God warriors surrounding Lin Xiu were blown away.

Bang bang bang——

Each of the God warriors was blasted out at this time!

They all fell to the ground not far away.

“This guy…”

The look in the eyes of the bald man changed drastically.

He never expected that Lin Xiu’s strength would be so powerful.

Under the attack of so many warrior gods, not only did they not fall into a disadvantage, but some warrior gods were even sent flying!

Looking at the God warriors who fell on the ground and spit out blood, his expression became even uglier.

He faintly felt something was wrong.

But Ma Teng hasn’t done anything yet.

Ma Teng, to be precise, is not from Ma Yun’s Ma family.

It’s another ‘Ma family’, which is even stronger than Ma Yun’s side.

Originally, he and Ma Yun didn’t get along very well. This time, of course, he didn’t want to avenge Ma Yun.

Instead, they want to kill Lin Xiu and get the treasure that Lin Xiu got behind the door.

Ma Teng saw that Lin Xiu sent several warriors flying in a short moment, and the look in his eyes changed slightly.

“interesting.”

The corner of his mouth curled up, and at the next moment, with a movement of his body, he rushed in front of Lin Xiu in an instant!

The weapon he was holding was… a spear!

At this time, Ma Teng had just rushed in front of Lin Xiu, holding a spear in his hand, and immediately stabbed Lin Xiu’s head!

DAng–

Lin Xiu’s reaction speed was extremely fast. With a move of his right hand, the golden spear in his hand directly blocked his attack.

Although he resisted it, his blow was so powerful that Lin Xiu took a few steps back!

And at this moment, Ma Teng held the spear in both hands and continued to attack Lin Xiu.

On both sides and behind, there were other God warriors attacking!

boom–

The next moment, Lin Xiu’s body was completely penetrated by their weapons.

Dead!?

These warrior gods saw this situation, and before they had time to be happy, blood holes suddenly appeared on their heads.

Lin Xiu’s figure, at some point, had already appeared behind them.

And he used the golden spear to directly pierce their heads.

The Lin Xiu they ‘killed’ just now was a fake.

“You bastard…”

Ma Teng watched this scene, and Lin Xiu also became ugly.

At this moment, the spear in his hand burst into golden light as his power passed through.

Hm?

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

Whoosh—

The spear in Ma Teng’s hand was thrown directly!

This speed is so fast that Lin Xiu has no chance to dodge.

In the next moment, Lin Xiu’s shoulder was instantly penetrated.

Blood splashed out in an instant.

“Almost.”

Ma Teng frowned, Lin Xiu’s reaction speed was still a bit too fast, otherwise, he could have directly penetrated Lin Xiu’s heart.

Soon, the spear that flew out flew back into a Sphere and was held tightly by Ma Teng again.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen were fighting other God warriors, but they didn’t notice what happened here.

“Damn it!”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen were also very strong. Although there were a lot of God warriors, there was still no way to kill Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen so quickly.

On the contrary, they killed several God warriors.

“Boss, this kid’s strength…”

The God warrior next to the bald man looked at this scene, and his face became ugly.

They never expected Lin Xiu’s friends to be so powerful.

“Don’t worry, Ma Teng will kill that kid soon.”

...

The bald man clenched his hands and said in a low voice.

“Divine Soul?”

Lin Xiu ignored the wound on his shoulder, looked at the spear in Ma Teng’s hand, and said calmly.

The reason why his spear was now glowing with golden light was because of the power of his divine soul attached to the spear.

“Oh? Can you see it?”

When Ma Teng heard Lin Xiu’s words, he was also surprised.

His divine soul was also a spear.

And it can be attached to a weapon, bringing power to the weapon.

“Be good and die!”

As soon as he finished speaking, in the next moment, his body moved, holding the spear, and continued to attack Lin Xiu.

Dangdangdang——

...

The spears of the two of them collided at this moment, and there were loud sounds.

Those surrounding warriors who did not participate in the battle all retreated to the back and unfolded their ‘Spheres’ to avoid being affected.

“Ma Teng actually made a move against these kids, and ended up getting so many people killed in retaliation, tsk tsk.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Some men who knew Ma Teng couldn’t help but sneer when they saw this scene.

“What do you know, this kid got treasures from the most powerful ‘gate’.”

The bald man looked at the God warrior over there and said in a cold voice.

As soon as his words fell, the expressions in the eyes of the surrounding warriors changed slightly.

Now they already know that the higher the level or the further back the door, the greater the difficulty, but also the better the treasure obtained.

This kid actually went to the most powerful gate, and it seems that he also got a treasure.

The words of the bald-headed man immediately changed the expressions of many onlookers.

At the same time, those warriors in the battle burst out with all their strength and used the domain!

But at the next moment, a white light came, and all those domain forces disappeared!

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen looked at Lin Xiu at the same time.

“Use your domain.”

Lin Xiu held the golden spear in his hand and said coldly while fighting with Ma Teng.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen also reacted instantly.

Without the slightest hesitation, the two directly used their domain forces.

They were surprised to find that their domains could be used.

But the domains of other God warriors seemed to be blocked by those white powers!

“You bastard…”

Ma Teng also just wanted to use his domain force but found that the domain force he had just released seemed to be blocked by something.

However, Lin Xiu’s other two companions were able to use it.

Needless to say, everyone knows that it was Lin Xiu’s doing!

Crackling——

At this time, as the purple source mark on Ma Teng’s forehead bloomed, terrifying lightning bolts burst out directly and charged toward Lin Xiu!

“Go to hell!”

The golden spear in his hand, along with these lightning bolts, charged toward Lin Xiu directly!

Boom, boom, boom——
