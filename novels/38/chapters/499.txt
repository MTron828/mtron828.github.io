Chapter 500: Luo Yue’s Abnormality

“Hng… it’s not that easy for you to kill me…” Lin Zhen gritted his teeth and said.

As the source strength in his body gathered, the light blue protective shield appeared directly to protect his body.

‘Sphere’!

He had taken the antidote of Lost Soul Dispersion so he was fine at this time, but Luo Yue didn’t use it. Once Lost Soul Dispersion is absorbed, one’s body would become weaker and weaker.

One could only recover after a period of rest, but there wasn’t any time for her to rest at this time.

“Do you think this would work?” Luo Yue said lightly.

She was in a strange state now, the murderous aura on her body was too strong – it was simply stronger than anyone he has ever met.

And taking a closer look, now Luo Yue’s fingers seemed slightly longer and sharper.

The bones on her fingers seemed to be jittering and her hands were positioned in a stance more suited to murder.

The light blue source strength covered her fingernails and now even if Luo Yue was using her nails, they were like a sharp weapon.

“Stop trying to scare me! Go to hell!!!” Lin Zhen saw Luo Yue’s current state and his expression changed greatly.

He suddenly roared and took out a silver round object with his left hand, then threw it directly toward Luo Yue!

Luo Yue was still walking towards Lin Zhen calmly.

The silver ball fell to the ground and there was a huge explosion!

Boom——

A large amount of dust was blown out and at this time, the surrounding area shook violently.

“Go away from me!!!”

Lin Xiu, who was on the other side, was still besieged by these tigers transformed from source strength and there was no way to help Luo Yue kill Lin Zhen.

Hearing the loud explosion sound behind him, Lin Xiu’s muscles tightened and the green veins protruded above his arm. Looking at the fierce tiger that once again attacked, the pattern on the body of the Dark Edge spear seemed to burst out with white light.

“‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!!!”

Following Lin Xiu’s roar, he sprinted forward with the spear in his hand and a huge black dragon burst out from the Dark Edge spear!

The tigers that were transformed by source strength were instantly swallowed by the black dragon!

But Lin Xiu knew that this was still not enough to completely eliminate the tigers that were transformed by source strength.

He could only drag time with these four tigers and kill those warriors who were using the combination skill!

‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’!

He swung the spear again and his energy was almost completely drained by these two super energy-consuming skills at this instant.

Boom boom——

As Lin Xiu’s spear waved again, the sky above suddenly turned fiery red!

And in the next moment, the flames above were like fireballs as they rushed downward!

They hit the bodies of those warriors directly!

“Ah!!!”

Although they had the protection of the source strength around their bodies, they were not yet rank 6 warriors and there was no way to unfold the ‘sphere’. At this time, as the flame hit some of their bodies, the intense burning sensation made these warriors wail loudly.

A warrior was hit by a fireball in his head and his entire head instantly burned into a skull!

Those warriors who were not hit yet were already trembling with fright and could no longer maintain the Combination skill. They were all evading the flames that were falling from the sky and were ready to flee for their lives!

“Fleeing, huh!” But Lin Xiu whose eyes were bloodshot wouldn’t let these people escape for sure!

Every time the Dark Edge spear stabbed out, it pierced the head of a violent tiger mercenary!

Within a short moment, Lin Xiu killed all 20 people!

The prompts of gaining experience resounded in his mind but Lin Xiu had no time to look at them; he looked behind him and found that it was dusty at the back because of the huge explosion sound just now.

There were still fires around.

Lin Xiu couldn’t care less anymore and simply charged in!

Although the smoke and dust over there were thick, they were slowly dissipating now. Soon, Lin Xiu saw Luo Yue standing over there.

“Luo Yue, are you okay!?” Lin Xiu said anxiously.

As soon as he walked over there, he saw a lot of blood on Luo Yue’s body, especially the dark red blood on her fingers.

He looked towards the front and found that Lin Zhen was lying on the ground with his eyes wide open, with a bloody hole in his body, as if his heart had been taken out.

Luo Yue turned around and looked at Lin Xiu who appeared behind her.

Lin Xiu was stunned when he saw Luo Yue’s face. Luo Yue seemed a little different from the usual Luo Yue. Although she usually looked very cold, it was different right now.

Because Luo Yue seemed dazed at this moment, her dark eyes were like a bottomless pit.

She seemed to be filled with a strong murderous aura.

“Lin Xiu…” But seeing Lin Xiu’s face, Luo Yue seemed to slowly come to her senses. In the next moment, her whole body softened as if she was about to fall to the ground.

But Lin Xiu’s reaction was quick and he quickly hugged Luo Yue.

Luo Yue actually fainted!?

Taking a closer look, the wound on Luo Yue’s arm that was caused by Lin Zhen seemed to have begun to heal and no blood was flowing out.

Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

But now Luo Yue’s body was covered with blood and she was unconscious. Lin Xiu thought for a while, picked up Luo Yue’s long sword, then walked to the other side holding Luo Yue.

The huge explosion on this side was heard by many people. Not long after Lin Xiu left, many people ran over here.

When they saw the scene here, these people were shocked.

“This… isn’t this a member of the Tiger Mercenary Group? These people are dead?” A man saw all the members of the Tiger Mercenary Group who had died on the ground and his expression changed drastically.

Anyone in the know knew that the Tiger Mercenary Group was not an ordinary mercenary group. The members of this mercenary group were all from the underground world and they were powerful warriors.

For Bai Di City, it was also one of the forces that couldn’t be trifled with.

But today, all the members of this violent tiger mercenary group died here!

“It’s them…it’s them…” The man who wanted to buy the ‘Absorb’ card had also appeared at the scene.

Seeing this, his face also became a little pale.

There was no doubt that the people from the Tiger Mercenary Group wanted to snatch something but they were all killed!
