1439 To Kill

What happened?!

The violent shake caused the man with the whip to fall to the ground.

“Who are you?!”

He was furious as he turned around and that’s when he saw a couple standing behind him.

There was a boy and a girl with a full head of white hair, looking peculiar.

“Luo….Luo Yue?!”

Luo Huatian couldn’t believe it as he looked at the young girl standing in front of him.

Seeing how it was his sister, he was incredibly shocked.

Why was Luo Yue here?!

Could it be that he had been hallucinating?

He blinked a few times just to make sure that he was seeing it right.

It really was! He wasn’t hallucinating!

“We’re finally here.”

Lin Xiu then let out a breath of relief.

After flying for so long, they’ve finally arrived at Tianbei City.

“Brother?”

Luo Yue immediately saw the man who looked familiar.

Luo Huatian.

Compared to before, her brother now looked terrible.

There were also multiple machetes placed on his neck.

Lin Xiu heard Luo Yue and subconsciously turned around as well.

Luo Huatian?!

It was indeed Luo Huatian!

The man with the whip walked towards Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

There were lots of guards around them and all of them rushed towards them.

Those who were on the ground holding onto the huge diamond shovels were from the Dark Planet. They looked surprised as well when they saw Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

They’re from…the Dark Planet?!

This was because those from the Warrior God Realm would have to wear a particular suit and helmet to prevent themselves from being affected by the dark energy in the air.

However, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue seemed comfortable with the environment. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Capture them! Can’t believe we’ve actually missed some and they came to us voluntarily!”

The man with the whip sneered.

There was also a lustful look in his eyes as he looked at Luo Yue.

Xiu – –

Then, there was an array that appeared over his head!

Boom – –

With the blink of an eye, the array exploded.

His head was gone as well.

Then, his body slowly fell to the ground.

Another dark blue flame suddenly appeared and his body was burnt to ash.

“Captain!”

The rest of the guards couldn’t believe what they had just seen!

“Go to hell!!”

The rest of them then started attacking Lin Xiu and Luo Yue!

Luo Yue pulled out her sword and rushed forward.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

With that, all of the guards were sliced open.

Then, she quickly ran towards her brother.

Those who still held a machete over Luo Huatian’s neck had a bad feeling about this.

Luo Yue had managed to kill a dozen of the guards!

They couldn’t afford to be careless. They quickly gathered their energy and released their ‘sphere’s, trying to stop Luo Yue.

Boom boom boom – –

However, Luo Yue was too quick and was already standing before them.

Luo Yue was moving at an incredibly fast speed with the sword in her hand.

The only managed to see a bright light flash before their eyes and their ‘sphere’s were already sliced into halves!

Their entire body as well.

There was blood everywhere!

“Brother.”

After getting rid of the guards, Luo Yue finally got to her brother.

She had always been like this with not much expression seen on her face.

“I’m fine.”

Luo Huatian shook his head.

“Why are you two here?”

Luo Huatian looked confused.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were both on Dark Planet.

What surprised him the most was that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were not affected by the dark energy here.

He was only able to stand them because he had been here for a long time.

“It’s a long story.”

With that said, there were loud explosions that came from behind.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu was moving around with his long spear.

Boom boom boom – –

Countless dark blue flaming birds were being released and all of them rushed toward the guards around them.

All of the guards around them were instantly annihilated.

However, there were more and more warriors that joined the fight.

“They are from the Warrior God Realm.”

“Most of them are from the Tianshen Pavillion.”

Luo Huatian quickly informed his sister about it.

There was a determined look in his eyes.

He had resisted earlier because he can no longer stand this life.

Even if he were to get killed, he didn’t want to stay here.

“Kill them.”

Luo Yue stared at the warriors that were getting closer but she did not look afraid.

She gathered her thoughts and instantly released a chilling aura.

All of the warriors were then instantly frozen.

Following that, Luo Yue rushed forward with her thin sword.

Countless horrifying sword aura was released and each aimed at a different warrior.

All of them ended up with their bodies in multiple parts.

There was a large number of warriors then ended up being sliced.

How powerful!

Luo Huatian’s eyes were opened wide.

Since when did his younger sister become so powerful?!

As for Lin Xiu, he was still releasing countless flaming birds with his long spear.

With these attacks, there was also a large group of warriors that were burnt to death!

None of the warriors were able to withstand such attacks.

Although Lin Xiu had already exhausted a part of his vitality, he was still in his best form.

It was a piece of cake to fight ordinary warrior gods.

Boom – –

As the ground shook, there were explosions happening everywhere.

The warriors that came from Tianbei City were all dumbfounded.

All of the powerful warriors from Warrior God Realm have been killed?!

“What happened to your hand?”

After killing the guards, Luo Yue then noticed a black sourcemark that was on Luo Huatian’s arm.

This was not a normal mark, it was an energy mark.

“There is a God King from Tianshen Pavillion that left these marks on us.”

“With one command from him, our bodies will explode.”
