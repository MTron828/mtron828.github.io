Chapter 993: Gloomy Ji Mei

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Boom –

As the mechanical worm fell to the ground, its head exploded in an instant.

Lots of sparks and currents burst out.

“Machine…”

When Gao Lin and the others saw this scene, they realized that the mechanical worm they had just fought was not a real evolved beast, but was a machine!

“Who made this thing?”

Looking at this thing, Gao Cong and Gao Qiang were surprised.

This mechanical worm was really terrifying. If this kind of thing can be mass-produced, it will be a big killer.

At this time, their eyes looked to the other side.

What shocked them even more was that Lin Xiu had just knocked down this terrifying mechanical worm with one blow.

How did he do that?

“He used an electrical skill. The electronic components in this giant worm should have been destroyed by him.”

Gao Cong, who has always been very calm, said aloud at this time.

“I see.”

Gao Lin and Gao Qiang also nodded at this time.

At this time, Gao Lin looked at Deng Men and said coldly, “I advised you not to go just now, you just had to huh.”

At this time, although under the treatment of Ji Mei’s Source mark power, Deng Men’s wound has already scabbed over.

But the arm he lost will never grow back.

“I’ll just install an artificial arm.”

Deng Men gritted his teeth and said at this time.

But there was no way to compare it with his original arm.

Because an artificial arm doesn’t have the ability to become stronger.

“Okay, don’t talk about it, let’s see how to find Angel’s Tears.”

At this time, Ji Mei came out to smooth things out.

Boom—

Just as she finished speaking, the passage in the middle where the mechanical worm came out from suddenly made a loud noise.

This channel was immediately closed.

“This…”

When Gao Lin and others saw this scene, their faces became ugly.

The mechanical worm finally died, but the channel was closed directly.

Now, there were only two other passages.

“What shall we do now?”

Gao Lin couldn’t help but look at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

Because Lin Xiu’s strength was the strongest, at this time, everyone subconsciously regarded Lin Xiu as the backbone of the entire team.

“Be careful.”

Lin Xiu did not answer his words at this time, but spit out two words.

Be careful?

Gao Lin and the others were stunned when they heard Lin Xiu’s words.

At this moment, a strange rustling sound came over.

Turning around abruptly, he saw that something seemed to be breaking out from the body of the mechanical worm.

Soon, some densely white figures emerged from the body of this mechanical worm.

“This… what is this!?”

Deng Men, who was sitting on the ground originally, saw this scene, his body trembled for a while, then he got up quickly.

Worms, a large number of white worms the size of human arms, poured out from the body of this mechanical worm.

“Okay…it’s disgusting.”

Ji Mei looked at the scene in front of her and said aloud.

Whoosh whoosh—

These white worms crawled towards the crowd at a very fast speed,

At the moment of crawling over, they spit out some green mucus from their mouths.

Those slimes seem to be extremely corrosive.

As soon as it touched the ground, a burst of white smoke was emitted from the ground.

“Damn!”

Gao Lin and the others’ expressions changed slightly and they all unfolded a ‘Sphere’.

The green mucus they spit out is too much and this corrosiveness is very terrifying.

It caused a lot of white smoke to rise from the surrounding ground.

A lot of mucus was sprayed on their ‘Sphere’, making their ‘Sphere’ start to corrode.

“Quickly kill these things!”

Deng Men was panicking now because of what happened just now.

Holding the weapon in his hand, he kept attacking the white worms that kept rushing over.

Ji Mei and the three Gao brothers also attacked.

It’s just that there are too many worms and they are not mechanical worms, but real creatures.

They didn’t know how many such disgusting things were hidden in the body of this mechanical worm either.

And as their weapons cut the worm’s body in half, the worm’s body suddenly sputtered out a lot of green mucus.

As the mucus splashed onto their ‘Sphere’, their ‘Sphere’ became more unstable.

Oh no.

They turned to the other side and saw Lin Xiu, who also unfolded the ‘Sphere’, standing in the middle, without moving at all. The moment the white worms touched Lin Xiu’s dark blue ‘Sphere’, they were directly burned into slag.

bang bang bang-

At this time, those white worms, like moths to a flame, kept ramming towards Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

Lin Xiu was standing in front, most of the worms hit the dark blue ‘Sphere’ by themselves and were annihilated.

It didn’t take long before all the worms had been eliminated.

Although the mucus spat out by these worms was very corrosive, the body was still very easy to deal with.

“Your ‘Sphere’ seems to be a little different from ours.”

Ji Mei looked at those worms being wiped out, she heaved a sigh of relief and said to Lin Xiu curiously.

Their ‘Sphere’ can only be used for defense, but Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ seems to have an offensive role while defending.

“Almost the same.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Lin Xiu’s answer made Ji Mei a little gloomy.

Many warriors were usually courteous to her, but she doesn’t care.

She didn’t expect that when she took the initiative to talk to this person, he didn’t want to pay any attention to her at all.

She doesn’t look ugly, does she?

Thinking of this, Ji Mei was even more depressed.

Could it be that this kid is gay?

But it doesn’t look like it…

“Brother Lin, where shall we go next?”

Gao Lin said to Lin Xiu at this time.

“Any one will do.”

Lin Xiu looked at the passages on the left and right and said aloud.

“Can we go both sides?”

Gao Lin was stunned, then said subconsciously.

Deng Men’s eyes flickered and he subconsciously took a step back.

After what happened just now, he didn’t dare go up directly now.

“Will there be such monsters on both sides?”

Ji Mei said subconsciously.

“There will be no monsters, but other things.”

As Lin Xiu spoke, he walked towards the passage on the left.

Ji Mei was startled when she saw Lin Xiu’s actions.

“be careful…”

As soon as she said the words, Lin Xiu walked to the entrance of the passage on the left!

Boom—
