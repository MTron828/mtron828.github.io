1330 True God’s Blood

Lei Chong’s eyes were opened wide but due to the bright, eye-blinding light, he was forced to block them with his hands.

He could only see what was happening with the gaps between his fingers.

The huge glow then slowly descended onto the centre of the committee’s seat.

God King.

It was a middle aged man with long, white hair.

His face seemed to have been shaved by blades as they were sharp and edgy.

He didn’t have handsome features but he was indeed charismatic.

“Is the match about to start?”

He was the God King that dominated this place. No one knew his name but all of them addressed him as the God King.

His voice sounded different from the rest and even Riyan Noble God quickly answered him, “It’s about to start.”

Tianling God king looked at the announcer who was floating in the air before nodding his head.

The announcer nodded his head in return and looked at the stage beneath him. Lin Xiu and Xiao Qingchen were already both on stage.

“Match Start!”

The rest of the crowd cheered even louder. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Especially with how the God King was present, all of them were feeling even more excited.

“So, he’s the God King…”

Baili Haoling stared at where the God King was seated at but she couldn’t feel any energy coming from him.

It was a strange feeling, as though with him just sitting there, he was already undefeatable.

Lin Xiu was already on stage.

Lin Xiu had witnessed the God King’s arrival.

He had already activated his Analytic Eye.

However, as he had assumed, the Analytic Eye would not be able to detect his stats.

“Tsktsk… It’s finally our turn to fight.”

Xiao Qingchen looked at Lin Xiu who was on stage and he had a vicious smile on his face.

He held onto his machete and Lin Xiu could clearly see the lightning bolts that appeared from time to time.

It was obvious that Xiao Qingchen was getting excited.

“Would you be able to do this?”

Before Lin Xiu could say anything, Xiao Qingchen continued mocking him.

This was because he noticed that in the match between Lin Xiu and Yuan Zheng, both of them were head to head. In the end, Lin Xiu only managed to beat Yuan Zheng after exhausting most of his energy.

It was different from his where he didn’t use much energy to defeat his opponent.

“Well, you shall find out soon.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

With two hours inside the training room, he has already quickly activated his ‘cultivation technique’ and replenished his energy.

Lin Xiu has recovered to his best state.

“This match…”

Suddenly, there was a voice that rang through the arena.

However, everyone present knew where the voice came from.

The God King!!!

The God King remained seated on the centre as if he was a king on his throne. His eyes were fixed on both Lin Xiu and Xiao Qingchen who were on the stage.

Lin Xiu and Xiao Qingchen quickly looked at the God King.

Huuuuu~

The God king has brought an intense pressure onto Lin Xiu, causing him to quickly take a deep breath in order to calm himself down.

“The winner will be rewarded with the ‘True God’s Blood’.”

With that said, the entire arena turned chaotic.

“It’s…..the ‘True God’s Blood’!”

Baili Haoling turned towards the man who was seated next to her and his body was trembling!

He seemed to be looking excited.

“What’s ‘True God’s Blood’?”

Baili Haoling was getting curious.

The middle aged man was also surprised to hear Baili Haoling’s question.

This was because from the look of the audience around as well as the committee, all of them looked excited to hear about the ‘True God’s Blood’.

“Only warrior gods that are God King’s or Beast Gods can be considered as ‘True God’s.”

“Their blood contains a large amount of energy and would greatly benefit those who take it.”

“This is something that could only be acquired if a God King or beast god is killed…”

...

As he spoke about this, both his hands were clenched together.

“Looks like Lin Xiu got lucky.”

Baili Haoling quickly commented on it.

“Well, he may not necessarily win. With such treasure on the line, Xiao Qingchen would definitely give his best!”

The middle aged man couldn’t help but speak up when he heard how Baili Haoling was sure that Lin Xiu would win.

This was the ‘True God’s Blood’! Something that everyone would die to have!

“I’m winning this for sure!”

Xiao Qingchen released all of the energy in his body after hearing the reward from the God King.

Sizzling – –

His entire body was covered with a white glow.

The True God’s Blood. Was that something so attractive?

...

Lin Xiu looked at how Xiao Qingchen got excited when he heard that the winner would be able to get the ‘True God’s Blood’ and he couldn’t help but feel curious.

“Let’s start.”

The God King returned to his seat.

“Both warriors, please be prepared!!!”

The announcer who was still in the air made a loud announcement to both the participants.

“Match start!”

The rest of the audience started cheering and chanting like mad.

With the announcement made, Xiao Qingchen quickly shifted his body and appeared right in front of Lin Xiu!

Such speed!

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrunk.

However, Lin Xiu’s reflexes were just as fast as his. He quickly picked up his Haoyue Spear and blocked his attack!

Boom boom – –

At that instant, there was a horrifying amount of lightning that appeared from his machete. Then, through the Haoyue Spear, all of the lightning bolts travelled onto Lin Xiu.

“Be careful!”

Lei Chong shouted subconsciously.

From the competition earlier, he clearly saw how horrible these lightning bolts were and how bad the damages were for the warriors.

“Hmph!”

However, Lin Xiu sneered and resisted the attacks with his own body.

He was someone who was an expert in using lightning bolts!

However, due to how he would usually play with the fire element, his lightning bolts were not as powerful.

The ones that Xiao Qingchen used may be powerful but there was nothing it could do to Lin Xiu.

“That’s interesting.”

Xiao Qingchen looked around and laughed coldly as he started moving the machete more vigorously.

Lin Xiu continued blocking his attack. When he saw how Xiao Qingchen was still moving his machete, Lin Xiu sneered.

The Haoyue Spear in his hands was instantly covered with hellfire!

Clang clang clang – –

Both weapons continued colliding with each other.

There were no fancy moves used. All of them were hard, life-threatening moves.

Due to the hellfire that was released, Xiao Qingchen was already covered with sweat.

“Crushing Thunderbolts!!!”
