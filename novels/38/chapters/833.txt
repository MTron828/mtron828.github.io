Chapter 834: Underground Tunnel

Chen Dong explained to the rest of the warriors.

After hearing what he said, they were all shocked.

If this was the case, the rest of their journey would not be so easy.

It was already extremely difficult for them to fight those flies, if there were anything else that was odd...

“Let’s take a look.”

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue continued walking forward without any hesitation.

“You....”

“Wait for me!”

Chen Dong ran after them as well as they went deeper into the island.

The other warriors looked at each other. They had no other choice but to follow them.

Since they already made it this far.

Plus, in this mission, they were on the hunt for the ghost ship but it looked like this ship was related to this island.

They had no other choice but to take a closer look.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue continued walking forward but they didn’t find anything new.

The things around them were p*tch black, looking particularly odd.

Also, they noticed that there wasn’t a single evolved beast.

It was horrifyingly silent.

“There’s nothing else?”

One of the warriors asked out of curiosity.

As they got to the highest point of the island, they still didn’t find anything odd.

On the ground around them, it was covered with weird looking rocks.

The sky was completely covered with dark clouds and the atmosphere around them felt creepy.

Lin Xiu took a good look around them and they couldn’t find anything new.

It was odd. Where did those flies come from?

Luo Yue was looking around as well and she found something odd. Then, she started walking in the other direction.

Wung wung wung – –

As she got closer to one of the rocks, there was a familiar buzzing sound coming from it.

Then, she noticed that there was an android fly that flew out from one of the cracks. She was shocked but instantly picked up her sword and swung it towards the rock!

Koong Loong – –

There was a huge explosion that rang throughout.

Lin Xiu turned around and when he saw that Luo Yue had already released his ‘Yuan’ and was safe, he let out a breath of relief.

“It should be from here.”

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and told him about the crack.

After hearing what she said, Lin Xiu stood right next to Luo Yue.

Following her gaze, he turned towards the rock as well.

The rock was just like any other rocks around, pitch black in colour.

There was nothing seen on it.

“Did you see the android flies coming from here?”

Lin Xiu seemed to know what Luo Yue was about to say. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“En.”

Luo Yue nodded her head. She noticed that the flies were coming out of the cracks from this rock.

“Did both of you find other android flies?”

Chen Dong and his men walked towards them as well.

“They should be coming from the cracks on these rocks.”

Lin Xiu held onto his spear and pointed to the rock in front of them before explaining it to the rest of the crowd.

“Perhaps, there’s something in the ground?”

Chen Dong asked out of curiosity.

The other warriors thought about what was said and suddenly, all of them looked shocked as if they had thought of something.

“Move.”

Lin Xiu said to them.

“You...”

“I’ll bust it open.”

Lin Xiu said calmly. Then, he gathered all the energy in his body and transferred it onto his long spear.

The rest of the crowd took a few steps backwards. There was a fierce look in his eyes as his spear was now covered with hellfire.

“Destroy it!”

He held onto the spear with two hands and blasted the rock!

Koong Loong – –

Then, the entire ground shook vigorously once again.

All the rocks on the ground have been broken into pieces.

The air around them was instantly covered with thick dust.

“Cough cough...”

Some of the warriors had to cover his mouth.

“Eh? This looks like...”

As the dust started to disappear, some of the warriors looked surprised as they noticed something.

“What’s wrong?”

Chen Dong walked over as well. There was an underground tunnel that appeared on the spot where Lin Xiu had just attacked.

When he saw what it was, Chen Dong’s eyes widened as he couldn’t believe his eyes.

He didn’t think that there would be such a secret passageway on this island.

“Could it be that the core of this island has been emptied...”

“It’s possible that there is a secret lab here.”

Lin Xiu said calmly.

They were here on a hunt for the ghost ship but they have not found any traces of it. Instead, the only thing that they found was this odd island.

“Should we take a look?”

One of the warriors hesitated before asking.

It might be possible that the underground was filled with unforeseeable danger.

“Are you scared?”

One of the warriors mocked him.

“Who…? I’m not scared!”

The warrior was getting provoked.

“Enough. Since we’re here, let’s take a look. If there’s anyone who’s afraid, you can stay behind.”

Chen Dong finally spoke up.

After hearing what he said, the men had completely different expressions on their faces.

All of them were here for the life crystal. If they don’t follow their boss, it would be considered that they didn’t finish their mission and they would not be able to get the life crystals!

“Let’s go. We should take a look to see if there’s any aliens down there!”

One of the warriors started swinging his machete as he said coldly.

The rest of them didn’t want to be viewed as cowards as well and had decided to enter the place.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue looked at each other before heading down the underground tunnel.

As soon as they entered the tunnel, Lin Xiu noticed that the walls of it were not made of rocks or mud. Instead, they were made of a special type of metal.

Bak bak bak – –

As the crowd entered the tunnel, all of the light in it lit up together.

The entire tunnel was now filled with a bright light.

The rest of them were shocked by the light that suddenly appeared out of nowhere.

All of them decided to be cautious.

But then, there was nothing suspicious in the tunnel.

Lin Xiu took a look further inside and noticed that the tunnel was getting wider.

By now, they were walking inside a huge underground tunnel.

“Why aren’t we there yet...”

One of the warriors couldn’t take it anymore and asked.

They have been walking for quite some time and they still haven’t reached the end of the tunnel.

It felt as if the tunnel was going to continue forever.

“Keep quiet.”

Chen Dong waved his hand and continued walking forward.

Ziiii Ziiii Ziiii – –

That’s when he heard an odd sound coming from in front of him.

As expected, after walking a few more steps, they saw a huge door.

There was a bright light shining from behind the door and it looked peculiar.

“Could this….be heaven?

One of the warriors who was getting waived spoke out of nowhere.

This door looked like the one that would bring them to heaven.
