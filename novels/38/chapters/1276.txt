1277 Gathering of the Powerful

“Sir.”

Mr. Pang looked at the figure of Pang Tong coming over and immediately said respectfully.

Pang Tong glanced at Mr. Pang and nodded slightly.

“you’re here too.”

Looking at Pang Tong’s figure, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and said in a faint voice.

“As a God warrior whom I was in charge of receiving, if you can achieve good results, it will be a good thing for me.”

Pang Tong still had no expression on his face.

“Are there many guides like you?”

Lin Xi was taken aback for a moment, then said subconsciously.

“certainly.”

Pang Tong didn’t hide anything and said directly.

“interesting.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

“Thank you for your reminder, let’s go then.”

While talking, Lin Xiu took out the card that Pang Tong gave him earlier.

This was a pitch-black matte card. Apart from a special pattern on it, it doesn’t seem to have anything special about it.

Lin Xiu held this card, hesitated for a moment, then poured his source strength into the card.

After the source strength entered the card, this black card suddenly burst into dazzling light.

It seems that there is an extremely powerful force blooming.

At this moment, the card flew out of Lin Xiu’s hand, then suspended in the air.

The dazzling light on the card directly shone on the ground.

“Let’s go.”

Pang Tong watched this scene and said lightly.

Rollie and Xiaobai were already standing on Lin Xiu’s shoulders.

Lin Xiu looked at Baili Haoling and Lei Tong.

The two looked into Lin Xiu’s eyes and nodded immediately.

In the next moment, the two of them, together with Lin Xiu, walked directly toward the light beam released by this card.

Whoosh—

As the three of them walked over, in the next moment, the figures of the three of them disappeared in place at the same time!

“Left… already?”

Mr. Pang was also very surprised to see Lin Xiu and others disappear in place.

This card actually has this ability.

“En.”

Pang Tong nodded slightly.

With the disappearance of Lin Xiu and others, this black card also disappeared in an instant.

“Damn it!!!”

When Lin Xiu’s figure just appeared at the other end, he found that his figure appeared on the edge of the cliff and fell straight down at this moment!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but curse secretly.

However, he reacted quickly and mobilized his body to generate strength to suspend himself in the air.

Baili Haoling and Lei Tong also responded quickly and stabilized their figures.

“Phew, where… is this place?”

Lei Tong took a deep breath, then said in surprise.

Taking a closer look, there were dangerous peaks all around.

It looks like the bottom was bottomless.

“Where is this?”

Baili Haoling’s eyes also widened, looking puzzled.

“I do not know either.”

Lin Xiu shrugged helplessly.

At this time, the black card suddenly fell from the sky.

Snapped–

Lin Xiu subconsciously reached out and caught it.

This is the passport to enter the city of God. He can’t lose it.

At this moment, Lin Xiu opened the navigation map and soon knew where he was now.

“Qiansuo Peak, we are now in the southwest direction of City of God. If we continue to go here for about half a day, we will be able to reach the gate of City of God.”

...

Lin Xiu looked at the projected map and said immediately.

“Just teleport directly into the city of God.”

Lei Tong said helplessly.

Lin Xiu smiled.

If they teleported directly into the city of God, it would probably cause confusion, so this card teleported them to the vicinity near the city of God.

It’s still early and they would probably be able to reach the city of God in the afternoon.

“Let’s go.”

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, he flew directly in the direction of City of God, followed closely by Baili Haoling and Lei Tong.

The concentration of source strength here was extremely high. If they kept using the levitation technique to fly, the consumed source strength can be quickly absorbed and replenished.

They didn’t have to worry.

City of God.

...

It is in the very center of this continent.

With the City of God as the center, there were countless forces, large and small, occupying the surrounding area.

There were countless cities with City of God as the core.

Lingxian City, where Lin Xiu lives, was like a chess piece on a chess board. No, it should be said that it was not even as good as a chess piece and was inconspicuous.

In the Multi-city contest initiated by City of God, the qualified city lords led a few of their entourages to City of God.

“So… so many people!”

Just as Lin Xiu and the others flew forward, Lei Tong looked at the scene in front of him from a distance and his eyes widened.

Not only was he shocked, but even Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling were also surprised.

Because in the front side, there were countless warriors flying forward as well.

Some of these fighters were flying in the sky, while others were riding various strange evolved beasts.

At this time, Lin Xiu kept scanning the area with the Analytic eye, but realized that there were quite a few warriors that couldn’t be analyzed!

That means that their strength must be much stronger than his current self.

Lin Xiu, who was quite confident at first, felt a blow at this time.

Sure enough, the warriors who could come to this city of God were all extremely powerful figures.

“interesting.”

At this time, Baili Haoling was nervous, but her body also trembled with excitement.

Lei Tong sensed the aura of the warriors around him and felt suppressed and uncomfortable.

It’s too powerful. Just the aura released gave him a feeling of being suppressed.

“City of God, we’ve arrived.”

At this time, after Lin Xiu continued to fly for a certain distance, he was able to see the huge city gate from a distance! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

On both sides of the city gate were two huge humanoid statues.

These statues were really huge like they were about to touch the sky.

This city gate was huge.

On both sides of the city gate, two giants with human faces and beast bodies stood guard.

In the middle, there were several God warrior-level fighters who were inspecting the people who enter.

The warriors who had just been flying in the air all stopped at this moment.

“Go down.”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu said aloud.

They flew directly to the ground.

The three stood on the ground and suddenly found that there were a large number of warriors beside them.

The bodies of these warriors exuded a powerful aura, which made Lei Tong feel more and more uncomfortable.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu patted Lei Tong on the shoulder.

Lei Tong, who was feeling extremely uncomfortable, suddenly felt a surge in strength and that extremely uncomfortable feeling disappeared in an instant.
