Chapter 104: Reward!

At this moment, Lin Xiu activated the Analytic Eye.

Those illusions could not be analyzed at all, but that figure behind could be analyzed. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Character: Fang Zhen

Strength: 201

Physique: 157

Speed: 70

Sure enough, this figure was the real one!

Although his strength was not comparable to Lin Xiu’s, his physique stats were very high; no wonder Lin Xiu’s punch just now did not break his bones.

The illusions attacked Lin Xiu with their sabers but Lin Xiu didn’t move at all.

When that real Fang Zhen attacked, Lin Xiu dodged in an instant!

How could it be!

Fang Zhen’s eyes widened. His gold skill ‘Thousand Illusions’ was like magic and made people hallucinate, they wouldn’t be able to tell which was him.

This was also one of his strongest killing tactics, but he did not think that Lin Xiu could find him so easily!

How was that possible!

“Go to hell!” Lin Xiu punched him in the face at this moment!

“Rupturing Fist”!

The scarlet-lit fist went straight to the middle of the man’s abdomen and his abdomen was dented in from the punch!

“Pffff”, he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Lin Xiu had to admit that his gold skill ‘Thousand Illusions’ was really quite strong. If Lin Xiu did not have the Analytic Eye, he would probably be cut by him!

Fang Zhen felt like his organs were shattered, his eyes were filled with disbelief and there was fear in those ferocious eyes.

He couldn’t treat Lin Xiu as a rank 1 warrior anymore!

He was almost like a rank 3 warrior, too terrifying. Fang Zhen felt like he didn’t have any strength to fight back in front of Lin Xiu.

“Goodbye!” Lin Xiu raised his fist at this moment and pounded him with the ‘Rupturing Fist’ once again!

A series of deafening blasts resounded in the surrounding air.

Fang Zhen was a rank 3 warrior, yet he looked like a weak chicken at this moment and didn’t have the strength to fight back at all. As Lin Xiu’s fist pounded against his body, a series of sounds of bones breaking kept ringing.

‘No way… he must drag Lin Xiu down even if he died!’

Fang Zhen’s blood-shot eyes widened and as Lin Xiu’s fist punched his body once more, he spat out a blood arrow, then clenched his teeth and released a ray of light from his body!

What was that!?

Lin Xiu, who was initially still punching Fang Zhen, was shocked. In the next second, the light rays seem to rush out of Fang Zhen’s body, causing a huge explosion!

Rumble——

A huge crater was formed on the ground and one of Fang Zhen’s arms fell on the other side with white smoke coming out of it.

There was a lot of smoke from the explosion and the ground was full of debris. There were even cracks in the ground and it was evident how horrifying the explosion was.

“Damn…” Lin Xiu, who was in that huge crater, was panting on the ground and his face was covered in soot, he seemed battered.

There was blood coming out of the back of his exposed hand.

That rank 3 warrior had a very powerful bomb in his body but Lin Xiu wasn’t sure how it was detonated.

If Lin Xiu didn’t react swiftly and used the source strength to cover his body, forming a layer of protective film, he would be in danger just now.

“Ding~~ Congratulations Master on killing a rank 3 warrior! You’ve gained 1,000,000 experience points!”

‘1,000,000 experience points!?’

Hearing this system prompt, Lin Xiu was surprised. He had never gotten so much experience from killing a rank 3 warrior before. Could it be because he was approaching the strength of a rank 4 warrior which allowed him to gain more experience?

Thinking about it, it was possible.

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked at his experience interface:

Experience: 2,139,635 (3,200,000 experience required for the next level)

More than three million experience was required before he could level up again. If he killed a few more rank 3 warriors, he could probably level up faster.

After a short rest, Lin Xiu stood up and found that the two other members of Temple of Transformation had already slipped away.

Despite the explosion at close range, the combat suit showed no signs of damage.

Lin Xiu stood up, patted the dust off the suit, then walked to the side. He carried the Dark Edge box on his back and went to the other side of the alley.

There was such a big ruckus just now and the Federal police would probably investigate later, Lin Xiu didn’t want to go to the police station for tea.

He arrived at the Warrior Hotel and simply picked a room. Lin Xiu took a shower, then sat cross-legged on the solid wood floor and began to practice the ‘cultivation technique’.

As he used the ‘cultivation technique’, the energy in the air kept going into Lin Xiu’s pores, filling his cells constantly, strengthening his bones, muscles, and other tissues.

“Fang Zhen was killed!?” The two men who had just escaped had now returned to the other side.

They had lingering fear just thinking about Lin Xiu’s strength.

Until now, they could not believe that a rank 1 warrior would actually be so strong.

They assumed that at Lin Xiu’s age, he was at best a rank 1 warrior and his aura was also very weak, so they were very shocked.

“Useless! Useless things!” The middle-aged man was pacing in the hall and his face darkened.

“Now this matter is no longer just a matter for the Tang Family, he killed several members of my Temple of Transformation, we must get rid of him!!!” The middle-aged man roared angrily.

They had never been at such a disadvantage. Fang Zhen was a rank 3 warrior, he was about to become a rank 4 warrior. Fang Zhen was his right-hand man and he never expected that he actually died!

“Go on the hunting net and post a reward.” The middle-aged man was silent for a moment, then he sneered.

The hunting net was a website created anonymously, nobody knew where the server of this site was.

There were all sorts of illegal dealings inside, as well as rewards for killings.

“Post his information up, the reward is 10 million union coins!”
