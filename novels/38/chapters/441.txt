Chapter 442: Awaken

No one knew how long it had been, but as Lin Xiu woke up, he could feel his body was extremely cold.

It was a bone-chilling type of cold and Lin Xiu’s body was trembling uncontrollably. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

It’s… so cold!

Lin Xiu quickly opened his eyes.

As soon as he opened his eyes, allowing his eyes to move, Lin Xiu noticed that he was wearing an oxygen mask and he was sleeping inside a cabin.

As for the rest of his body, they were completely covered with a pale blue fluid.

It felt as if his entire body was submerged inside the pale blue fluid.

Lin Xiu was aware that he was now lying inside a medical cabin.

Di Di Di – –

The machine was beeping behind him and at that moment, the door to the medical cabin was opened.

Whoosh – –

With the doors to the medical cabin being pushed open, Lin Xiu used a little force and pushed himself up. Most of the pale blue fluid slowly fell off Lin Xiu’s body.

“Huhu…..” Lin Xiu took off the oxygen mask and took a few deep breaths.

“Are you alright?” There was a soft, gentle voice that appeared.

Lin Xiu took a closer look and saw Luo Yue who was standing right in front of him. Her eyes were no longer as cold as usual, it seemed so much more gentle.

“I’m fine.” Lin Xiu said as he smiled.

He decided to take a good look at his body. Other than feeling a little sore, there was no pain or injuries sustained.

As he thought about the battle yesterday, Lin Xian subconsciously clenched his hand into a fist.

Back then, if it wasn’t because he had an additional buffer which was the system, he would have been able to fight Yu Muchen.

Fortunately, he had knocked out a little later than Yu Muchen which was why he managed to win the battle.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and instantly got himself together.

He took the towel, placed it on his cheeks, and wiped off the pale blue fluid that was on his face and body.

His eyes looked towards the side and saw that there was an attire in white that was prepared. Lin Xiu picked it up and changed into it.

“I’m done.” When Lin Xiu saw Luo Yue was showing her back towards him, Lin Xiu laughed.

“En.”

“Oh, by the way, my hair…” Lin Xiu touched his hair and noticed that the wig was no longer there. Instead, there was already new hair that was formed on his head. They were short and stubby and there were also eyebrows now. He took a look at the mirror and saw that his eyebrow was still a little light.

“Hmm….. I also added a little potion for hair growth.” Luo Yue nodded her head as she explained it to him.

“How long have I been asleep?” Lin Xiu stood up and looked towards the window. Then, he saw the dazzling sun that was coming in.

“Two days.” Luo Yue told Lin Xiu.

“F*ck! I was asleep for two days?!” Lin Xiu’s eyes widened in surprise.

It has already been two days.

Lin Xiu put on his shows and stretched a little, hearing the loud cracks that were coming from his joints.

Ka La Ka La – –

The soreness that was from the battle had already completely disappeared. All of them were replaced with an unexplainable comfort.

He could feel that his strength had increased.

“Oh right, what about that dude?” Lin Xiu turned and asked Luo Yue.

As he thought about Yu Muchen, his eyes narrowed.

“I don’t know if he’s dead or not.” Luo Yue replied calmly.

“Pfftttt…..”

“You’re ridiculous.” Lin Xiu laughed after hearing Luo Yue’s reply.

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu as if he was an idiot before leaving the room.

“Where are you going?” Lin Xiu asked as he was surprised.

“Do you want to continue staying here?” Luo Yue replied as she walked out of the room without even turning back.

Then, Lin Xiu realized that he was in the treatment room.

“Lin Xiu? You’re awake?!”

Just when Lin Xiu and Luo Yue walked out of the room, there was another person who was walking in their direction.

After taking a good look at it, it was a familiar figure.

“Teacher Nan.” Lin Xiu saw who he was and greeted him.

It was Nan Zhengjun. He was looking at Lin Xiu in shock.

“You just woke up?” Nan Zhengjun was closely inspecting Lin Xiu. After confirming that Lin Xiu was alright, he nodded his head in satisfaction.

“En.”

“You little brat.” Nan Zhengjun smiled before patting his shoulder.

“Can you leave now?”

“What’s wrong?” Lin Xiu paused for a moment before asking subconsciously.

“The vice headmaster and the other leaders want to meet you. Plus, they wanted to talk about the rewards.” Nan Zhengjun informed Lin Xiu about the meeting.

After hearing what he said, Lin Xiu felt suspicious as he narrowed his eyes.

“I don’t think that it would only be able the rewards.”

Even if he won the match, the school leaders wouldn’t be asking to meet him personally. Lin Xiu couldn’t help but have a bad feeling about it.

“I’m not sure.” Nan Zhengjun smiled bitterly as he answered Lin Xiu.

He was also a little confused and didn’t know what it was about.

“Alright. When would it be?” Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders helplessly.

“Tomorrow afternoon at three, in the main building.”

When Nan Zhengjun made sure that Lin Xiu was alright, he didn’t ask any further questions. After chatting with Lin Xiu for a brief period of time, he left as well since as a teacher, there were still a lot of things that he had to do.

“What do you think?” Lin Xiu asked as Luo Yue walked towards him.

“Did you do something?” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu in suspicion.

“What can I do?” Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulder but felt immensely guilty deep inside.

Could it be that he was caught for the incident at the power station?

As the both of them walked towards the field, there was already a huge crowd gathered there.

All of them were looking at a huge screen.

“Let’s take a look.” Lin Xiu was curious as well when he saw the scene. After saying it to Luo Yue, the both of them walked towards the crowd.

The screen was showing a shocking scene.

“The Frozen Forest at the E99 District suddenly had a rise in temperature causing the rivers to melt…”

It was a 3D video that was taken by a drone and it was extremely clear as if there were there personally.

The video was showing a forest that was covered in white with lots of snow. The ground was surrounded by rivers that were originally frozen. The entire scene could be described as a world of ice and snow.
