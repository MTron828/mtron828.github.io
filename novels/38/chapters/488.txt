Chapter 489: Vice President

After Lin Xiu entered high school, he became more silent and low profile so it was a long time since she saw him.

After hearing that Lin Xiu turned out to be a good warrior, she was also very happy.

Not long after, the doctor walked over.

“Lin…Mr. Lin, the operation was very successful, and the patient should wake up soon.” He looked at Lin Xiu, as if thinking about how Lin Xiu almost threw it down from the 15th floor just now. He trembled slightly at the thought.

“Where is he now?” Ye Shuang’er’s mother heard the doctor’s words and stood up from the hospital bed excitedly, then said to the doctor.

“He’s in the intensive care unit over there,” the doctor said quickly.

Taking a closer look, now he still had some cold sweat on his forehead.

It was obvious that he was still very afraid of Lin Xiu.

“Let’s go take a look too.” Lin Xiu said, looking at Luo Yue and Ye Shuang’er.

“There are still some things I need to settle in my company, I’ll go back first.” The middle-aged woman from before said aloud to Ye Shuang’er’s mother at this time.

“Okay, Sufen, thank you for your help this time.” Ye Shuang’er’s mother nodded, and then thanked the middle-aged woman.

If it weren’t for her, no one would have sent them to the hospital.

“It’s okay.” The middle-aged woman nodded at this time and seemed to think of something and hesitated. In the end, she didn’t say anything.

Soon after she left, Lin Xiu and the others headed to the intensive care unit on the other side.

The intensive care unit looked much more high-class than the ward just now.

Ye Shuang’er’s father was lying in the ward at this time like he was in deep sleep.

There were still a lot of gauzes wrapped around his body and it seemed that everything had been taken care of.

“The bones and everything have been connected, and with the best restoration fluid, the bones will heal very quickly. Tonight, you can try to walk, but I suggest that it is better to rest on the bed for three days.”

Because the doctor was almost thrown off the 15th floor by Lin Xiu just now, his hands trembled at the thought of this, and his attitude towards Lin Xiu was also very respectful.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded.

“I’m glad he’s fine…” Ye Shuang’er’s mother was sitting on the chair, watching Ye Shuang’er’s father who was still sleeping.

“That…” At this moment, seeing Ye Shuang’er and her mother looking at Ye Shuang’er’s father who had just finished the operation, the doctor looked hesitant at Lin Xiu who was standing at the side.

“We’ll talk there.” Lin Xiu seemed to know that he wanted to speak, but it was inconvenient.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the doctor nodded quickly and then stood with Lin Xiu in the passageway at the door.

“Mr. Lin, it’s not that I don’t want him to be treated, but because our vice president is putting pressure on me again…” the man said with a bitter smile.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Xiu raised his brows and then said faintly.

“He wants you to do the discharge procedures immediately.” The doctor hesitated for a while but gritted his teeth and said to Lin Xiu.

“I was not allowed to perform the operation on your relative just now. He hasn’t found out yet, if he does, I can’t stay in the hospital anymore.” The man said with a bitter expression.

Now he was thankless on both sides.

“Where is your vice president?” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes at this time and then said faintly.

“I don’t know!” The man came to his senses quickly as he shook his head, thinking of what Lin Xiu might do.

“I think other people should know.” Lin Xiu ignored him at this time and then walked to the other side.

The man hurriedly stood in front of Lin Xiu and said, “Hey, just let me off. The vice president is not an ordinary person. He is a rank 3 warrior and if he knows that I told you about it, I will really be dead.”

The man was crying and begging Lin Xiu. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

He was scared stiff by Lin Xiu. From his point of view, Lin Xiu seemed to be a rash and unreasonable young man. He might even beat the vice president up later and that would be troublesome.

“Then tell me where he is, I’ll have a good talk with him.” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes at this time and then said faintly.

This so-called vice president was doing this to target Lin Xiu or Ye Shuang’er’s parents.

Could it be due to the pressure of the Chen family?

No, it shouldn’t be. The Chen Jingqian of the Chen family was beaten up by him and it was impossible for this matter to end so easily.

The person playing these tricks should be… Zhao Xia?

“In the office on the second floor, you must not tell him that I told you.” The man begged Lin Xiu with his palms together.

If the vice-president finds out, he wouldn’t be able to survive in Bai Di City, let alone in this hospital.

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu nodded.

“Huh? Where did Lin Xiu go?” After seeing that his father seemed to be all right, Ye Shuang’er heaved a sigh of relief, then turned to look behind, only to find that Lin Xiu was missing.

“He went out for a while.” Luo Yue knew what was going on, and said lightly at this time.

Ye Shuang’er was a little curious but didn’t think too much.

And Lin Xiu quickly reached the door of an office on the second floor according to the directions given by the doctor.

He looked at the nameplate at the side that read “Vice President- Liao Yi Office”.

Lin Xiu looked at the door of the room, his eyes narrowed, and then he twisted it in front of the door. It was not locked.

“I know, I will deal with it as soon as possible, don’t worry young master Zhao.” As soon as he entered, Lin Xiu saw the so-called vice president on the phone.

This vice president seemed to be in his 40s or 50s, and he looked quite muscular.

“Who are you?” At this time, he also noticed Lin Xiu walking in, and he frowned.

Lin Xiu didn’t answer his question. He closed the heavy door directly, and then smiled at vice president Liao Yi and said, “It was Zhao Xia just now?”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Liao Yi was shocked, and then shouted at Lin Xiu, “Who are you! This is my office. If you have nothing to do here, please get out!”

He seemed to be very threatening. No wonder the doctor was so scared of him just now.

It didn’t work on Lin Xiu at all.

“I’m just here to inform you that my Uncle Ye will leave only when he has fully recovered.”
