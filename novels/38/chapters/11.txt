Chapter 12: Luo Yue

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu became cool and comfortable the moment he jumped into the water. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

Although the fish swam extremely fast in the water, Lin Xiu’s current reaction speed was quick enough to spear through a few fish.

He took the fish onshore and found a wooden stick, as well as a thick dried up tree bark, and tinder.

He placed the wooden stick on the tree bark and used both hands to clasp onto the stick and spun it quickly.

As a warrior, the difficult task of producing a fire was quickly accomplished.

The tinder was soon ignited.

Lin Xiu swiftly threw the surrounding dried branches into the fire and created a blazing flame.

He picked up the stick that had the fishes and started cooking them.

If only there was salt...

But Lin Xiu was too famished to think further and quickly ate up a cooked fish.

Lin Xiu was surprised by the taste of the fish. Although there was no seasoning added, it was far more delicious than any fish he had eaten back in his world.

Right at this moment, the sleeping lady frowned and gradually opened her eyes.

When she saw the half-naked boy, her eyes constricted and she immediately thrust her sword at him!

Lin Xiu turned his head in the nick of time and saw the sword!

‘Damn it!’

With a curse, Lin Xiu subconsciously dodged to the back.

“What’re you doing!”

He heaved a sigh of relief after dodging the sword. If not for her injury, he would not have avoided her sword that easily.

“Damn, if I didn’t save you, you would have become fish food!” Lin Xiu fumed in anger.

He was speaking the truth. Although the fish in the water looked gentle, they were still evolved beasts. As long as they realized that she was unconscious, they might nibble her to death.

“You saved me?” The girl frowned and realized that although her clothes were wet, there were no traces of it being touched, while Lin Xiu’s battle robe was taken off and left to the side to dry.

She heaved a sigh of relief and the frown on her brows dissipated.

She thought of moving, but the immense pain stopped her from doing so.

Lin Xiu saw the coldness in her eyes dissipate and heaved a sigh of relief. He then wore the almost dry battle robe. “Relax, I won’t make you give your heart to me.”

The girl was startled then retorted indifferently, “Shameless.”

“The way you say shameless sounds really nice.” Lin Xiu chuckled and replied.

He knew that the girl was injured and could not move much, so he became relaxed.

“Right, do you want to eat?” Lin Xiu sat by the fire and cooked the fish while asking her.

But she remained silent and looked around, as though trying to think about something, causing Lin Xiu to be bored.

“Give me one.” Not long after, her lips trembled as she spoke lightly.

Although she did not eat such food, she was heavily injured and without sufficient energy to recover her exhaustion, it would become very dangerous.

Lin Xiu smirked as he thought to himself, ‘I just asked if you wanted one and you ignored me’.

But he still gave her a cooked fish.

The girl held onto the stick that was stabbed into the fish and brought the fish to her mouth. She took a whiff before taking a small bite.

It tasted not too bad.

“What’s your name?” Lin Xiu asked as he cooked.

“Luo Yue.” The girl remained impassive and replied indifferently.

‘Luo Yue? What a nice name. But she’s too cold and seems to have a poker face.’

“I’m Lin Xiu. It seems that we’re both of the same age, are you an official warrior?” Lin Xiu asked with a smile.

The title of an Official Warrior was not easily achievable. The majority of the people only became Official Warriors after entering college.

Only a small minority had the talent to become Official Warriors while still in high school.

And for this young lady, who seemed to be able to stand against a rank 5 Lightning Leopard, she would most probably be a rank 4 Official Warrior?

Upon thinking about this, Lin Xiu took in a deep breath. It was too terrifying!

“What do you want?” Luo Yue did not reply to Lin Xiu, she instead stared at him with her beautiful eyes and returned with a question.

“What do you mean, what do I want?” Lin Xiu was startled and did not understand her.

“I don’t like owing people.” She looked at him and continued, “Tell me what you want and I’ll give it to you, so we will be even.”

“Or else I’ll kill you.”

Her eyes emitted a ferocious glare that caused Lin Xiu’s heart to tremble at the last sentence.

‘Damn, crazy woman.’

“Alright. I want to be as powerful as you, is that fine?” Lin Xiu waved his hand helplessly.

Luo Yue sized him up and replied slightly hesitantly, “Your aptitude is too bad.”

Lin Xiu almost fell to the ground. He opened his eyes wide in shock. What did that mean?!

The sky had gradually darkened and the blazing fire attracted many mosquitoes.

These mosquitoes were larger than the average mosquitoes, and every sting caused him to wince in pain.

“Expel the mosquitoes.” Luo Yue’s hand was free to move as she grabbed a few strange stalks of grass and threw them into the fire.

A strange scent emanated from the flames and the mosquitoes disappeared.

Luo Yue closed her eyes to rest, but Lin Xiu still felt energetic.

While thinking to himself, he recalled receiving a reward when he killed the Warrior!

He entered the system interface and there was indeed a bright icon.

He moved his thoughts to it and quickly found a familiar lottery interface.

The lottery interface was the same as previously. But there was a small change. The lottery wheel was now divided into ten sections: three of them were categorized as secret techniques, three were union coins, three potential pills. The original three potential pills had changed to two and one became a weapon, while the last section was an extremely small Grand prize.

It seemed that the lottery wheel had different random opportunities every time, there might be some things one time and others at another draw.

He did not need any union coins or secret techniques now but only required a weapon.

It’d better be a weapon!

Lin Xiu held his breath, and with a thought, the lottery wheel started spinning!
