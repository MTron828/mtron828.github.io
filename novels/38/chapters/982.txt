Chapter 983: Draw Again

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Hm?”

Hearing Lin Xiu calling him, Duan Zeyan was stunned and looked over to Lin Xiu.

Thinking of Lin Xiu’s terrifying power that was different from today’s, he looked at Lin Xiu with fear.

When he recalled that he wanted to ambush Lin Xiu before, he felt extremely regretful.

Fortunately, Lin Xiu did not kill him.

“you can go now.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Really…really!?”

Duan Zeyan was stunned for a moment, then said with a trembling voice.

Today he wanted to escape several times, but he was afraid that Lin Xiu would kill him.

Hearing that Lin Xiu wanted to let him go, it felt unreal.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

Although this man wanted to ambush Lin Xiu at first, he was able to complete those S-rank tasks so quickly afterward.

So Lin Xiu didn’t want his life either.

Duan Zeyan had a look of surprise on his face, but at this moment he seemed to have thought of something, and he became hesitant again.

He seems a little afraid to speak out.

“If you have anything to say, just say it.”

At this time, with the death of Pang Kuan and others, the source rings quickly flew to Lin Xiu’s hands. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

A total of fifteen source rings appeared on Lin Xiu’s arm.

In addition to the previous seven, there are now a total of twenty-two source marks.

“Please, can you give me a source ring?”

At this moment, Duan Zeyan plopped down on the ground and said to Lin Xiu.

He stayed here for ten years, and finally opened this Sage warrior space again.

But after five days, other than the contestants and the warriors with source rings in their hands, the rest of the warriors will not be summoned.

If he wanted to go out, he needed a source ring.

Although there were many warriors in this Sage warrior space, he already had a shadow in his heart after the last time he ambushed Lin Xiu.

If the rest of the warriors who came to this Sage warrior space this time were also very strong, then his chances were very slim.

“I can trade it for anything!”

Duan Zeyan didn’t hear Lin Xiu’s voice, and hurriedly continued to speak.

Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered, and with a wave of his right hand, one of the source rings flew towards Duan Zeyan.

The source ring instantly appeared on his arm.

“I’ll give it to you.”

Lin Xiu said lightly, and then walked away.

Leaving behind Duan Zeyan, who seemed to be frozen.

“thanks…”

Duan Zeyan looked at the source ring on his wrist, and his eyes suddenly turned red. He was finally able to go out!

As soon as he walked out, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

The first source stone was in his hand, and next, it was time to look for the second one.

The second source stone, in the wilderness.

That’s where the Angel’s tears were at.

This was based on the information Wu Hao gave him.

Without the slightest hesitation, Lin Xiu started to walk.

The grassland was huge, and Lin Xiu didn’t know how long he had walked before slowly seeing the tall green grass around him disappear.

In its place was a wasteland.

In this barren area, there were still many human skeletons and the remains of various creatures on the ground.

“Phew, I’m a little tired.”

Lin Xiu yawned as he walked.

It was midnight now, and it was pitch black all around.

Although Lin Xiu has a certain night vision ability, it was still a bit difficult to see.

After finding a random stone, Lin Xiu lay directly on this side, then closed his eyes and rested.

It was very quiet all night, and the next day soon arrived.

squeak-

Lin Xiu, who was sleeping soundly, was quickly awakened by the sound of a bird chirping.

When he opened my eyes, he saw sunlight shining into my eyes.

Some strange black birds were flying around, making a strange cry.

“Even birds are made of machines…”

Lin Xiu used his Analytic Eye to scan the birds, and he knew clearly that these were mechanical black birds.

Although they used robot birds, from the information obtained from the Analytic Eye, it can be known that these robot birds possess the same power as a King warrior.

In other words, the power brought by such a small bird may destroy the earth, which only had rank 9 warriors previously.

“This is too nonsensical.”

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but say something to himself.

After standing up and taking out some things from the expansion space to satisfy his hunger, Lin Xiu felt that his whole body was full of strength.

Comfortable, very comfortable.

Holding the Dark Edge spear, Lin Xiu started waving it.

As his strength continued to grow, the spear art he learned before was obviously not suitable for him.

‘Overlord Spear Art’ was not bad but it was the spear art that he had learned before, and he had already fully comprehended it.

Although the holy-level skill has ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’, this skill really consumes too much physical strength and cannot be used often.

“Oh right, let’s see what can be drawn now.”

Lin Xiu thought of the lottery system.

The monthly number of lottery draws was refreshed today.

In addition to the number of lottery draws left over from previous upgrades, there should be quite a few, right?

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu directly entered the system interface, and then entered the lottery system.

The number of times displayed below the number of draws is: 3.

Huh? There are actually three lottery chances.

Because it was not long after the last lottery draw, Lin Xiu thought that there were only two lottery chances at most, including the one chance of the lottery obtained by leveling up, and the monthly chance.

Three chances to draw a lottery… let’s draw!

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu clicked to start the lottery, and soon entered the familiar big wheel interface.

Seeing the familiar lottery interface, Lin Xiu looked carefully.

The lottery interface this time is still similar to the last time, and the turntable is still divided into ten grids.

The three grids are skill cards, the three grids are odd crystals, the three grids are battle suits and weapons, and the last grid occupying a very small position is the grand prize.

“Doesn’t seem to have anything special…”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself a little depressed.

Originally, he had reached the sage warrior level, so he should have refreshed something good.

But now, it seems that there is not.

Only the skill cards had changed from low-level skill cards to diamond skill cards, and there were mostly purple-gold level skill cards.

The battle uniforms were fine, but weapons were definitely not needed.

With the continuous forging of the Dark Edge spear, it was already very suitable for his use.

Without further hesitation, Lin Xiu directly clicked on the lottery draw.

This time, it was not drawn consecutively, but drawn one at a time.

As Lin Xiu just clicked on the lottery window, the carousel started to spin like crazy.

Seeing that the pointer was about to reach the [Grand Prize], Lin Xiu hurriedly shouted:

“stop!”

Soon, after Lin Xiu called out, the pointer of the turntable slowly stopped.

“Congratulations Master for obtaining the odd crystal!”

“Damn it!”

Hearing the system prompt, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but curse.
