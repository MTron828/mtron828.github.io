Bang bang bang-

Looking at the skeleton bones rushing over, Lin Xiu kept waving his fists, directly smashing those skeleton bones into slag.

These skeletons are not threatening, they are just a bit large in number.

And they seemed to be constantly crawling out of the ground.

Not only the skeletons, but even the skeletons of some evolved beasts seemed to be alive and attacked Lin Xiu frantically.

Lin Xiu frowned slightly. There were too many. Even though he was able to kill all these things, the time taken was simply too long.

There were still four days left in this Sage warrior space. Within four days, he must find all the energy source stones in the four map sections.

He took out the Dark Edge spear in the expansion space again.

‘Awe of the phoenix’!!!

As he swung the spear in his hand, in the next moment, a burst of flaming birds flew out.

These flaming birds rushed over, directly melting the surrounding skeletons and the bones of evolved beasts.

rumbling rumbling—

As the flames continued to burst out, those endless skeletons gradually disappeared.

Done?

Lin Xiu raised his brows at this time and looked around and it was true that no other skeletons appeared.

But the source stone didn’t appear either!

“Was I wrong?”

Lin Xiu was a little suspicious of his own guess at this time.

Just now, Lin Xiu used his Analytic eye, but he didn’t find anything unusual.

If he used it now…

After hesitating for a while, Lin Xiu continued to activate his Analytic eye and glanced at everything around him.

“Tombstone.”

“Ordinary skeletons.”

“…”

As the Analytic Eye glanced over, there were also some word prompts under the interface.

But still nothing unusual was found.

“Tombstone: Abnormal energy fluctuations.”

Just as he continued to scan around with the Analytic Eye, in one of the tombstones, Lin Xiu suddenly saw some words displayed.

“Um?”

Lin Xiu was instantly overjoyed. The tombstone in front of him looked the same as the previous tombstone.

Who knew there was an anomaly in this?

“This kind of place the Analytic Eye is like a bug.”

Lin Xiu smiled and walked over to the tombstone.

“Eh?”

As soon as he walked over to this tombstone, Lin Xiu felt as if he had stepped on something and the entire ground started to cave in!

Damn it!

Lin Xiu was startled and subconsciously used the levitation technique to levitate his body.

rumbling rumbling—

The surrounding ground began to vibrate.

The ground, slowly, the surrounding ground, all collapsed.

Under the tombstone just now, a huge skeleton suddenly appeared.

“lizard?”

Looking at this huge skeleton, Lin Xiu couldn’t help frowning.

clack clack——

In the next moment, this huge skeleton began to move.

“No, it’s a bit like what is said in the western world of Earth… Skeleton dragon?”

Looking at this scene at this time, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes could not help shrinking.

This huge Skeleton dragon seems to be awake now.

The pair of huge skeletal wings began to wave at this time.

Soon, its huge sound was suspended in the air.

Roar–

Although it was a Skeleton dragon, it made a huge roar.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help covering his ears.

The sound of this Skeleton dragon’s cry was too strange, as if it was a special kind of sound wave and it shook directly into his mind.

pfft—

At this moment, Lin Xiu saw darkness in front of his eyes, a pain in his chest and spat out a mouthful of blood.

What exactly is going on!?

Originally it was dark just now, but in the next moment, the original vision was restored.

But at this time, Lin Xiu was still full of shock.

At that moment, what happened?

Before Lin Xiu could think about it, in the next moment, the Skeleton dragon opened his mouth wide and charged toward him!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu dodged directly.

Roar–

A pair of huge bone wings of this Skeleton dragon waved and the surrounding wind was gusting.

Holding a Dark Edge spear, Lin Xiu, who was suspended in the air, looked at the Skeleton dragon at this time and suddenly found something, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

In the middle of the Skeleton dragon’s head, there seems to be a black light.

Energy Source Stone! Black energy source stone!

It turned out to be in the head of this Skeleton dragon!

At this time, the Skeleton dragon opened its mouth wide and a large number of black energy substances gathered in its mouth.

Formed a huge black energy cluster.

If Lin Xiu guessed correctly, this was a dark-type energy source stone.

It’s really weird…

At the next moment, that terrifying dark-attribute energy cluster charged directly towards Lin Xiu!

Boom—

With the impact of this dark attribute energy cluster, the entire space seemed to have a huge sound.

The speed of this terrifying dark energy cluster was extremely fast.

Because of this extremely fast speed, the friction caused a large number of cracks on the surrounding space.

At this time, Lin Xiu directly unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

This ball of dark energy was too fast and there was no way to dodge it.

As soon as Lin Xiu unfolded the “Sphere”, this terrifying dark energy ball hit Lin Xiu’s “Sphere”.

The terrifying energy was madly impacting Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

The ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded seemed to have sunk down because of the impact of the ‘Sphere’.

The whole ‘Sphere’ was about to be broken through by this dark attribute energy cluster!

Damn it!

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth at this time. It was the first time that his ‘Sphere’ felt like it was about to be destroyed.

The energy of this dark attribute is too strange!

“Scram!!!”

At this moment, Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and the source energy of his whole body burst out.

It is directly passed to the ‘Sphere’.

That terrifying dark-attribute energy cluster was directly bounced off.

He rushed directly towards the Skeleton dragon’s hand bone!

boom–

The huge hand bone of the Skeleton dragon was directly annihilated after being hit by the energy of the dark attribute!

Roar–

The Skeleton dragon let out a loud roar at this moment and a pair of huge bone wings flapped and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Damn it!

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu cursed, but still reacted quickly with the Dark Edge spear to resist.

bang bang bang-

The long spear collided with the claws that it swiped and suddenly there was a loud noise after another.

Even if this Skeleton dragon has only one claw, its strength is extremely tyrannical.
