Chapter 472: Arriving in Xing Yao City

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue quickly entered the aircraft.

The interior looked like a bar and Lin Xiu found a table then sat down.

“There are still no windows ah…” Lin Xiu glanced at the surrounding at this time, there seemed to be no windows here.

It was the same as the aircraft previously, it seemed that the windows were deliberately sealed.

Is it to prevent others from discovering the location of the Sacred Region Academy?

“There are many people in the underworld who want to attack the Sacred Region Academy.” At this moment, Luo Yue suddenly said aloud.

“Underworld!?” Hearing Luo Yue’s words, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank suddenly.

Hearing this word again, Lin Xiu was no longer unfamiliar with it.

The warriors in the underworld were all black households and they lived in those extreme environments, so their killing skills were much stronger than ordinary warriors, and they were terrifying.

Just like Luo Yue’s brother.

“To prevent the Sacred Region Academy from being located.” Luo Yue continued to say aloud at this time.

After listening to Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu nodded suddenly, as expected, he was right.

Dean Baili looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue who were leaving in the aircraft, and touched his beard, with a look of interest in his eyes.

“I don’t know how far will you guys improve… It’s really interesting to think about…”

Time passed quickly. About three hours later, Lin Xiu heard a slight rumbling noise.

Hm?

Lin Xiu, who was closing his eyes to rest up his mind, opened his eyes at this time, and he was able to see clearly. The surrounding walls slowly became transparent.

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened when he saw this scene. He quickly discovered that the entire aircraft had become transparent and he could clearly see what was outside!

Lin Xiu didn’t expect that the spacecraft could do this.

“Damn!” But when he looked down, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but exclaim when he saw the scene below.

Because there was a vast ocean below and trees that were half-submerged.

Obviously, this must have been a mountain, but it was submerged by the flood.

And above this tree, Lin Xiu saw a decayed body and a very disgusting zombie whose face was also poisoned with sulfuric acid.

It was baring its teeth at Lin Xiu.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu had goosebumps.

It seemed that there these zombies were really resurrected!

Boom——

And at this moment, Lin Xiu felt a violent shaking of the entire spacecraft that he almost fell to the other side.

“What happened!?”

As soon as Lin Xiu spoke, he saw that in the water below, there was a huge tail, which was coming towards the aircraft he was in.

But the person who controlled the aircraft had very good skills and quickly avoided it.

Roar–

At this time, in the water below, he could see a huge evolved beast with its body revealed. That huge head was giving off a loud roar.

“Rank 7 evolved beast?” Lin Xiu’s Analytic Eye retrieved the information of this evolved beast very quickly.

“There were many of this kind of evolved beast in the last century and it is almost extinct now.” Luo Yue looked down and said faintly.

“Didn’t expect them to all be alive now.” Lin Xiu nodded, and his expression became more cautious.

At this time, the speed of the aircraft also flew faster, like a stream of light.

He looked towards the front, Lin Xiu could see the city from a distance. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

And on the highest building in that city, it appeared like there were stars glowing faintly.

The iconic building of Xing Yao City!

“We’ve arrived!?”

Lin Xiu said in surprise at this time.

He hadn’t returned to Xing Yao City for a while and was a little excited now.

The speed of the aircraft was very fast, and in a short while, they arrived at Xing Yao City.

At this time, they looked down and the water was rushing towards Xing Yao City. However, around Xing Yao City, there were flood drainage devices, and the water was easily drained away.

The aircraft stopped on a tall building.

“If you want to return to the academy, you’ll need to take the aircraft back from the Sacred Region Academy bases around.” The pilot said to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue who were leaving at this time.

“En, got it.” Lin Xiu nodded and said.

“Is this the city you lived in before?” Luo Yue stepped off the aircraft, then stood on the rooftop, looked around, and said.

“Yes.” Lin Xiu nodded, and when he arrived at Xingyao City, everything seemed so familiar.

It was as if he had arrived in his hometown, which made Lin Xiu feel very comfortable.

Boom boom——

Just as Lin Xiu took a deep breath of the fresh air here, the whole ground suddenly shook.

“Warning, a huge flood is coming. Residents of Xingyao City, please get on an aircraft at the Aviation Center and leave!”

“Warning warning…”

At this time, the warning was issued, spreading throughout Xingyao City.

Looking down, there were many people on the street rushing to the aviation center anxiously.

“Logically speaking, there are flood control measures next to Xingyao City, so there is no need to leave in such a hurry…” Lin Xiu thought of seeing a scene just now, and couldn’t help but mutter to himself.

Boom boom——

But the tremor came again as though an earthquake had struck.

“Look over there.”

Looking into the distance from the rooftop on this side, it happened to be the gate of Xing Yao City.

Luo Yue could clearly see the scene at the gate of Xing Yao City.

“There’s nothing there…” Following Luo Yue’s gaze towards the gate of Xingyao City, Lin Xiu then saw a figure falling from above the gate.

What is this!?

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank, and after a closer look, it turned out to be… a zombie!

That’s right, a zombie climbed onto the city gate and entered the city!

The guards at the city gate saw this scene and shot the zombie directly with the gun.

But although these laser guns penetrated its body, they did not completely kill it. On the contrary, the zombie’s movements became crazy and swift. Soon, all the guards were bitten!
