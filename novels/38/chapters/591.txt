Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu did not know what to do at this time and began to use the ‘cultivation technique’.

However, when Lin Xiu was running the ‘cultivation technique’, he could clearly sense that the tingling in his hands became more intense. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Zi zi zi–

At this point, the middle-aged man could see that in the middle of the glass ball, the bright light seemed to become active.

Just like a white flame shaking.

Seeing this scene, the pupils in this man’s eyes constricted..

However, this scene did not last long, at the next moment, this group of rays went back to normal.

“Eh?”

Lin Xiu opened his eyes at this time, his hands moved gently, and found that his hands could be taken off from this glass ball.

“What happened?” Lin Xiu asked.

Because the tingling feeling of electric shock in his hands had continued, but suddenly disappeared at this time and Lin Xiu was puzzled.

“It’s fine.”

“You can go now.” The middle-aged man seemed to be a little disappointed, and shook his head.

“Go?”

Lin Xiu was stunned.

“So...”

He looked at this round ball and was still able to feel that it was extremely powerful. If he could swallow the energy, his strength would probably increase many folds!

No, he must find a way to swallow the energy inside!

When Lin Xiu was thinking, this man shook his head, “You have failed, it seems that you are the same as Baili Tao and the others, it is not what we are looking for.”

“Can I try again?”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and looked at him.

“Before they came to this floor, the most talented person could only remember 50 percent of the contents in this library. Oh right, I think he’s called Xia Xing.”

The man did not pay attention to the words of Lin Xiu and looked at him as he mumbled to himself.

“You are the most unexpected one who could remember all the contents.”

“I originally thought that your talent has reached the requirements, but now it seems that you are still not enough.”

After speaking, the man seemed to be a little sad.

“Can I try it again?” Lin Xiu asked.

His gaze was firm.

The middle-aged man was stunned. He wanted to refuse, but saw Lin Xiu’s firm gaze and thought about it then nodded.

“The last time.”

“En.” Lin Xiu took a deep breath. At the next moment, his hands reached out again, then slowly put them on the glass sphere.

This time, Lin Xiu did not feel a stinging sensation.

It seemed that all reactions had disappeared in an instant.

The middle-aged man looked at the movement of Lin Xiu, and then looked at the white light in the glass ball, suddenly shaking his head.

No, seems like he wasn’t the one he was waiting for.

Lin Xiu was also a bit upset at this time, but this powerful energy body, Lin Xiu didn’t want to let go.

Yes, Analytic eye!

Lin Xiu hesitated at this time, then launched the Analytic Eye directly.

Lin Xiu thought that he was only able to analyze the ranks of evolved beasts or warriors in the past but later found that the Analytic eye could also analyze many other things.

“Target lock ... Analytic eye starts…”

“Dididi... energy found, ‘Engulf’ skill automatically activated…”

But once Lin Xiu’s analytic eye started, it seemed to find something and activated ‘Engulf’.

“Forget it...”

When the middle-aged man was just about to say something, his eyes were wide opened in disbelief.

Because he saw the white light in the glass ball becoming active, constantly shaking.

This...

Boom–

And at the next moment, Lin Xiu’s hands seem to penetrate the glass ball in an instant, then went inside and touched the white light!

Lin Xiu also suddenly felt his hand going into the glass ball. He was suddenly scared and both his eyes opened.

But the moment he opened them, he found that the light in this glass ball suddenly became extremely glaring.

All he could see was white.

Soon, Lin Xiu felt a stabbing pain in his head, and he instantly fell into a coma.

After some time, when Lin Xiu once again woken up again, I found that he was in an... Internet cafe!?

Lin Xiu could clearly hear the sound of the keyboards around.

Many people were playing Dungeons and Warriors but most of them were playing a popular game called League of Legends.

On the computer in front of him, there was the interface of the game, and the word “fail” in capital letters.

Lin Xiu looked around and he was still in shock as if he was frozen. He stayed at the same spot not moving at all.

After a while, Lin Xiu pinched his cheeks and felt that painful sensation then took a deep breath.

This must be fake huh...

Lin Xiu’s right hand was trembling as he placed it on the mouse, then he turned off the game interface and looked at the interface of the computer.

Previously, there was a strange window in the game, after he clicked it, he arrived in that world.

But now it seemed like he merely fell asleep and that was just a dream?

Impossible!

At this time, Lin Xiu shook his head – that experience was so real.

But now his touch also felt very real like it wasn’t a dream at all!

It’s more like he fell asleep while playing games and what happened there was a dream!

Right, system, quick, go into the system to see!

Lin Xiu closed his eyes, then wanted to see the system interface in his mind like before.

But what shocked Lin Xiu was that there was no system. When he closed his eyes, there was total darkness!

And there was no connection to that system at all!

“It’s impossible! It’s impossible!”

Lin Xiu stood up in disbelief and yelled.

Those people around the cafe saw the movements of Lin Xiu and looked at him.

“Dumb-ass!”
