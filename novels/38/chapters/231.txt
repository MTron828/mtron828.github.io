Chapter 232: Obtaining The Super Vitality Gift Pack

When Lin Xiu clicked to draw the prize again, the turntable started spinning.

It spun very quickly at the beginning and gradually slowed down.

“Skill card! I want a skill card!” There were more skill card slots separated into silver, gold and even diamond skill cards!

If he got a diamond skill card, he could exchange it for a large number of points even if he could not use it!

The needle stopped and the notification came out.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for obtaining a gold skill card!”

Following the system notification, a gold light appeared before him. The skill card floated in front of Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu reached out for the gold card and all his excitement disappeared when he saw the weapon type of the skill card, turning to utter disappointment.

It was a rod skill that was useless to him.

Left with no other choice, Lin Xiu continued to draw the prize and quickly used up his remaining five chances.

The second was a claw-type weapon that was good in quality but useless for him.

The third was a silver skill card.

The fourth was 1 million union coins.

“Damn you! You’re cheating me!” Lin Xiu was fuming with rage, if the system was an actual android in front of him, Lin Xiu would have beaten it up.

It was truly a cheat, aside from the first gold skill card that was passable, all the other rewards were trash!

“Last draw, grand prize or that diamond skill card.” Lin Xiu watched as he exhausted the last draw and clasped his hands to pray.

If he got rubbish again, Lin Xiu felt that he would vomit blood.

The turntable’s needle started spinning frantically.

Lin Xiu stared at the turntable and suddenly roared out loud, “STOP!!!”

Right when he finished his word, the needle gradually slowed down.

It swayed and seemed as though it was about to stop at the union coins section.

“Screw you!” Lin Xiu cursed out loud.

Sacred Region Academy used its own currency and points and the union coins were practically useless.

Even if he had a few billion union coins, they would be useless!

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for obtaining the super vitality gift pack!”

Just as Lin Xiu was fuming with rage, he suddenly heard the notification and was stunned.

He looked carefully and saw that the needle had moved slightly off the union coins, so he did not get the union coins!

He landed on the “?” section instead!

‘So I see, fortunately, it’s not union coins. It can be anything but union coins.’

Lin Xiu was curious, what was this super vitality gift pack?

The name of it sounds like some medicine or healing item… DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Before Lin Xiu could make a guess, a red gift pack dropped from the sky.

Bang-

The gift pack was not big and Lin Xiu quickly untied the rope and retrieved the items inside.

“Is this…some quack medicine?” Lin Xiu looked at the items and did not know whether to laugh or cry.

There were more than 10 of the quack ointment, a small bottle of pills and another bottle of pale blue liquid.

There were roughly 20 odd pills and only a little bit of pale blue liquid.

There was no introduction to any of the items.

“Let’s have a go at it…” Lin Xiu thought about it and opened a bottle.

A fragrant smell came out upon opening and Lin Xiu could not help but take a deep breath.

‘Super vitality, this should be used to cure injuries, right?’

Lin Xiu took a pill out that was the size of a little fingernail. It emitted a fragrant smell.

After hesitating for a moment, Lin Xiu swallowed it.

Gulu.

Lin Xiu thought he had swallowed a peppermint sweet and instantly felt refreshed upon consuming it.

It surged from his throat to his entire body!

The light internal injury from using Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City seemed to have disappeared as well.

‘This is…. really good!’

Lin Xiu became ecstatic, although he knew that it was meant to heal injuries, he thought that its medicinal effects would be ordinary. Who would have thought that it would be so powerful!

Lin Xiu was able to sense that his stamina had recovered and he became extremely focused.

Not only can the pill heal injuries, it would restore his stamina!

Aside from the quack medicine, Lin Xiu believed that the pale blue liquid would be extremely beneficial as well.

But since it was limited, Lin Xiu decided to try it in the future after sustaining severe injuries.

“Continue training!”

Lin Xiu clenched his fists and muttered to himself.

It was exactly like receiving a pillow when one decides to take a nap.

Training Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City and Overlord Spear Art would affect his body.

So he decided to take advantage of the medicinal properties and train at the same time. This way, all the injuries caused by the skill would be recovered and he did not have to worry about training in the tyrannical skills that would cause harm to his body!

Upon thinking about this, Lin Xiu picked up Dark Edge and started swinging!

Bang bang bang-

Explosions came out when he swung his spear!

The Overlord Spear Art was extremely powerful, just swinging the spear would induce vacuum explosions in the air.

And the might of Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City was most probably even stronger, Lin Xiu did not dare use it recklessly or the entire villa might be destroyed!

Pu-

After training the spear art for a bit, Lin Xiu felt pain in his meridians and his organs seemed to be unable to tolerate it.

He had unlocked his second gene lock and evolved his body further but sustained such damage. If any ordinary warriors attempted the skills, who knew what might happen.

‘This skill and spear art is truly tyrannical!!!’

But Lin Xiu became even more ecstatic, the more powerful it was, the more he trained, the more valuable it would be!!!
