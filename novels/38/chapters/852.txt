Chapter 853: Killing a Respected Warrior!

Bang bang bang-

Huang Ying’s physical strength was still very strong and many spears were directly bounced off.

But the spears that followed could indeed break open his body.

“die!”

At this moment, Lin Xiu also directly charged away with the Dark Edge spear!

With a flash of cold light, the spear was like a dragon, directly piercing Huang Ying’s head.

bang bang bang-

The other thousands of spears also directly penetrated his body into a sieve.

Huang Ying opened his eyes wide and there was an unbelievable look in his eyes.

He is the most powerful being on the Marqi Planet, how could he be defeated by a kid from Earth!?

“Dead!? The emperor is dead!!!”

At this moment, the entire Marqi planet was shocked.

As a powerful Respected warrior, Huang Ying the emperor was defeated by a young man!

Lin Xiu pulled out the spear at this time and Huang Ying fell to the ground.

The entire surrounding ground was filled with long spears.

It seems that the long spears covered the whole city.

hu—

Lin Xiu took a deep breath at this time and he no longer had the heart to watch the system prompts coming from his mind.

Finally dealt with him.

In this way, not only revenge, but the earth should be safe too.

With a wave of his right hand, a terrifying flame instantly swept the entire sky.

And those aerial cameras only be able to see a sea of ??fire in an instant.

“From today onwards, the people of Marqi Planet are not allowed to set foot on earth.

At this moment, a loud sound came out and the entire Fengyun City heard it.

Just hearing the sound, it seemed that Lin Xiu’s mighty power could be felt.

All those warriors were intimidated.

Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared.

Soon, it will be the third day.

The news of Huang Ying being killed has spread throughout the entire Marqi Planet.

Just when the government of Marqi Planet thought that Lin Xiu was going to replace Huang Ying as the supreme ruler, Lin Xiu disappeared.

It’s like he’s never been here.

But in the palace, there were spears stuck on the ground all over the sky, which still shocked the people who came.

On this day, Luo Yue stood on a mountain at the gate of the city, looking into the distance, as if she was looking at something.

There was no expression on her face and she still looked so cold.

She seemed to be waiting for something, which made some nearby warriors very curious.

“Guess who I am?”

At this moment, it seemed that a pair of hands came over from her and covered her eyes.

Luo Yue subconsciously wanted to move, but she seemed to feel something. The body that was about to break free seemed to be frozen.

“Why are you crying?”

At this time, Lin Xiu hurriedly felt the wetness in his palms, put down his hands quickly and said anxiously.

“I didn’t!”

Luo Yue turned her back, then quickly wiped the moisture from the corners of her eyes and said.

“I am back.”

Lin Xiu held her shoulders at this time and said to her.

“Next time, don’t take such a risk, okay?”

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu, her eyes were still slightly red.

Before she knew it, her heart seemed to be occupied by Lin Xiu.

This time, Lin Xiu’s battle against the most powerful Huang Ying in Marqi Planet still made her very worried.

“Not anymore.”

Lin Xiu hugged Luo Yue and patted Luo Yue on the back.

The two just hugged under this hilltop, enjoying the rare tranquility.

pata——

But at this moment, a slight sound resounded, causing the very sensitive Lin Xiu to react.

“Who is it!?”

“Cough, you guys continue, I didn’t see anything.”

Luo Yan walked out from behind a big tree in embarrassment at this time, covered her eyes and said.

Luo Yue also pushed Lin Xiu away with a blushing face.

Lin Xiu glared at Luo Yan.

But at this moment, he saw Liu Pan, Qian Lin and An Qi all behind.

It seemed that he had been peeking from behind for a while.

“you...”

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, his head was full of black lines.

And Luo Yue, who was originally cold, seemed to have a slight redness on her cheeks at this time.

“Unfortunately, I thought the master was going to kiss later, but now we can’t see it...”

An Qi and Qian Lin said regretfully.

Lin Xiu’s ears were very good. Hearing their words, the corners of his mouth twitched.

In the following time, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue both traveled around in Cang Qiong City.

After going through so many lives and deaths, it was as if he had been training every day and it was rather tiring. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Now, it’s finally time to take a break.

And it’s a good feeling to be with someone you like.

Time passed quickly. During this time, several major events happened on the Marqi Planet.

The monarchy seems to have been abolished and is now a united constitutional system.

Because many people were dissatisfied with Huang Ying’s rule before, this time, Lin Xiu indirectly fulfilled those people’s ideas.

Cangqiong City was also rebuilt because of the buildings destroyed by the previous battle.

The ground on the other side of the palace, that large area, was filled with a large number of spears because of the skill that Lin Xiu unleashed that day.

But no one took care of it. That area has become a tourist spot.

The arena where the two world’s most powerful warriors fought, the power of holy skill, attracted many people to visit.

Another thing was the rule that the planet Marqi can never go to Earth.

This day, while Lin Xiu was drinking his morning tea, he received a text message.

“Hm?”

Looking at the text message, Lin Xiu’s hand holding the cup suddenly froze.

“What’s wrong?”

Luo Yue said curiously.

“It seems that the code has been broken.”

Lin Xiu looked at the text message Jiang Ying sent and said.

Moreover, Jiang Ying’s residence was also in Cang Qiong City, which surprised Lin Xiu.

bang bang bang-

When he and Luo Yue came to Jiang Ying’s residence, Lin Xiu knocked on the door.

Squeak-

Soon, a voice rang out and the door of the room was pulled open.

“Cough cough cough…”

The door of this room was just opened from the inside and suddenly some thick smoke came out, accompanied by a cough.

“You guys are here?”

Jiang Ying’s figure appeared in front of them. Looking at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, she said embarrassedly, “I’m doing an experiment...”

“Have you deciphered the contents of that book?”

Lin Xiu spoke to her at this time.

“That’s right! Come in, let’s talk about it.”

Jiang Ying nodded and said.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue walked in and saw that her room was messy, with a lot of experimental equipment and all kinds of weird things in it.

It’s like a laboratory.

“I usually fiddle with these things when I have nothing to do.”

Jiang Ying said a little embarrassedly.

“By the way, I’ll go get the book. I have deciphered the language of the planet Namir.”
