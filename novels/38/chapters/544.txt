Chapter 545: I Will Help You Kill Them

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

A man in Lin Lang’s group looked at these people and said loudly.

Now they were also in a cold sweat.

There were too many people on the other side and they were also holding those strange bows and crossbows.

Now that they haven’t reached the level of rank 6 warriors, they simply couldn’t unfold the ‘Sphere’ to block.

If it goes on like this, their situation would be very dangerous.

“Sacred Region Academy?” The man holding the saber frowned slightly, then shook his head and said, “I’ve never heard of it.”

Hearing his words, the faces of Lin Lang and the others became ugly.

“Why don’t we just give him the rank 8 odd crystal…” One of the men said aloud in cold sweat.

Under the current circumstances, even if they were killed, no one would find out.

“Now I don’t want the Odd Crystal anymore.” The man heard his words and said with a strange smile on the corner of his mouth.

“I want your lives.”

Having said that, all the people around were holding crossbows and were ready to shoot right away.

Seeing this scene, Lin Lang and the others were completely panicked.

They originally came out to experience and complete the task, but what they didn’t expect was that they would encounter such a thing.

“Why don’t you give me the rank 8 odd crystal and I will help you kill them.” At this moment, Lin Xiu on the other side suddenly said.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, everyone around looked at Lin Xiu.

“Oh? You’re not with them?” The man with the giant saber looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

At this time, he also discovered that there were several corpses in the grass behind Lin Xiu and at a glance he knew that his own people were killed.

“Don’t believe me?” Lin Xiu ignored the man, then grinned. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Although Lin Lang and others also felt that Lin Xiu was strong, now that there were so many people on the other side, they were obviously doomed!

“Boy, so arrogant huh.” The man looked at how fearless Lin Xiu was and found it interesting.

And the rest of the people with bows and crossbows also aimed their attacks at Lin Xiu.

It seemed that as long as the man gave an order, Lin Xiu would be shot into a sieve.

“Do we have a deal?” Lin Xiu ignored him and said aloud to the people over there.

“I’ll give it to you!” Lin Lang hesitated for a while, then said through gritted teeth.

“Lin Lang…” His partner was surprised when he heard Lin Lang’s words.

The man on the opposite side looked younger than them. Although he seemed to have killed a few warriors in black battle suits just now, there were so many people here and he would definitely die.

“I believe him.” But Lin Lang said with certainty at this time.

Although he didn’t know what was going on, Lin Lang had an intuition. These people didn’t seem to be simple.

And more importantly, now that he has no choice – these people would definitely kill him and others.

“Deal.” Lin Xiu grinned, then he waved the Dark Edge spear in a circular arc and pointed directly at the leader and said, “Send your head over then. “

“What a joke!” Seeing how arrogant Lin Xiu was, the man just now was angered and at this moment, he laughed.

“Kill him for me!!!”

As his voice just fell, at this moment, the men around him with bows and crossbows directly pulled the trigger.

The steel needle on the mechanical bow instantly made a ‘swish swish’ sound and stabbed towards Lin Xiu in all directions!

At this critical moment, a light blue light suddenly appeared around Lin Xiu’s body and a ‘Sphere’ instantly enveloped Lin Xiu’s body.

“Hehe, you’re dead!” Seeing Lin Xiu unfold the “Sphere”, the leader was not surprised at all, but instead laughed ferociously.

Their steel needles made of special materials from different dimensions could break the ‘Sphere’ of a rank 6 warrior, so this was much better than using a laser gun to deal with warriors!

It’s over!

When Lin Lang saw that Lin Xiu didn’t dodge and simply unfolded the ‘Sphere’ and stood there, he was shocked.

Because before they fled here, they saw with their own eyes that a rank 6 warrior who unfolded ‘Sphere’ was directly penetrated by those steel needles, his body was covered in holes like a sieve!

Bang bang bang-

But at this moment, when these steel needles hit Lin Xiu’s Sphere, they were all shot away!

“Ah!”

Some of the men who were close to Lin Xiu suddenly let out a wailing and miserable scream as the steel needles they shot out bounced back.

How could this be!

The leader of this group of people saw this scene and his eyes widened.

Taking a closer look, you could clearly see that Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ was different from ordinary warriors. There were even some lightning bolts on the ‘Sphere’.

Swoosh—

And without waiting for the man to see more, Lin Xiu’s figure was like a phantom, instantly appearing in front of those men with bows and crossbows.

Although the lethality caused by these bows and crossbows was great, as long as you got close, the effect was obviously much weaker. This was the weakness of long-range weapons.

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in both hands and with a slash, he beheaded several men.

And while beheading these men, Lin Xiu’s movements did not stop.

With the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he danced wildly. In a short period of time, these men with bows and crossbows were all killed.

The situation was completely one-sided.

“This is too crazy…”

The mouths of everyone around Lin Lang opened wide and they were all dumbfounded.

The spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was so gorgeously wielded that with one pick, one stab, one wave, at least one person’s life was taken away.

“Stop!!!”

The leader saw this scene and his heart was bleeding. Lin Xiu killed so many of his subordinates.

At this moment, with his loud roar, the next moment, holding the huge saber in his hand, he attacked Lin Xiu!

His speed was also very fast and he seemed to be comparable to Lin Xiu, obviously using some kind of extremely fast body skill.

“Be careful!”

Seeing this scene, Lin Lang and others blurted out.

After Lin Xiu killed the last man with a bow and crossbow, he looked behind him from the corner of his eyes and found that the leader jumped up with a huge saber and wanted to slashed his body!

“Go to hell!!!”
