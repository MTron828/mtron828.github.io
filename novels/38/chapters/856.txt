Chapter 857: Revenge

“Ridiculous!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Nan Jing couldn’t help but sneer.

“Everyone, this is an order – take down this wanted criminal!!!”

Following Nan Jing’s loud roar, a large number of government military warriors rushed in from the entrances in all directions.

They are all high-level warriors and their uniforms and weapons are extremely well-equipped.

At this time, they all rushed towards Lin Xiu on the battlefield.

Lin Xiu looked at the three men who were bound in the matrix by the power of his own source mark and his right hand volleyed into the air and made a pinching motion.

In the next moment, those matrices contracted and a loud sound rang out directly.

These three men were directly fried into minced meat.

“Kill him!!!”

Seeing this scene, Nan Jing’s face became extremely ugly and he roared.

A large number of warriors rushed up and wanted to attack Lin Xiu.

“Be careful!!!”

Seeing this scene, the pupils in Baili Haoling’s eyes could not help but shrink.

Just when the people at Sacred Region academy were about to help Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu faintly spit out two words, “Go away.”

Those warriors who rushed up seemed to feel a powerful force coming and in the next moment, they all flew out.

boom boom boom —

These people all hit the wall and the ground behind.

There was a loud noise after another.

“This...”

Bai Litao’s eyes widened at this time.

Looking at this scene, he was full of disbelief.

Lin Xiu, when did you have such a powerful strength?!

With just two words, all the thousands of warriors who rushed in were sent flying out!

Those warriors fell to the ground, crying incessantly.

There wasn’t any fighting at all.

Nan Jing, who was high in the sky, saw this scene and the expression on his face also became frightened.

how can that be!

How could this kid have such a powerful strength!?

“You’ve become a master warrior!?”

Nan Jing seemed to have thought of something and his face became hideous.

Looking at Lin Xiu below, he shouted loudly.

“Master Warrior level?”

Lin Xiu showed a strange smile.

A warrior at the master warrior level – he was simply underestimating Lin Xiu.

“Don’t assume that with your current strength you are powerful; you probably have never heard of a more powerful warrior level on another planet!”

Nan Jing said angrily at this time.

At this moment, a purple light burst out on his forehead.

“Crushing Thunderbolt”

Nan Jing roared and in the next moment, a large amount of lightning burst out.

crackling-

At this moment, a huge electric current sounded.

There was a sudden burst of lightning in the air.

In the next moment, all of them rushed towards Lin Xiu.

“Die!!!”

The thick thunderbolts all smashed down Lin Xiu’s body.

Even the indestructible battle platform was torn apart.

Lin Xiu’s body was suspended in the air at this time and he was not afraid of these lightning bolts at all. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Flew straight into the air.

“Go to hell, go to hell!!!”

Nan Jing roared.

His hands were constantly waving and more lightning flashed out, all of them charging towards Lin Xiu.

boom boom boom —

There was a loud noise in the air.

But it was still to no avail.

Lin Xiu was not affected by this seemingly terrifying lightning at all.

“I said, you are too weak.”

Lin Xiu flew in front of him and said lightly.

“you you...!”

Nan Jing pointed at Lin Xiu, his fingers trembling.

Other than anger, there was deep fear.

“If you like to play lightning, let me show you what lightning is.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

With a wave of his right hand, the Dark Edge spear behind Lin Xiu flew out directly, then flew into Lin Xiu’s hand.

‘Thousand Thunder’!

Lin Xiu swung his spear and pointed at the sky.

Boom—

With a loud noise, a loud thunder erupted in the air.

One after another incomparably terrifying lightning burst out from the sky.

After becoming Wu Zun, the strength that this former skill can exert has become even more powerful and terrifying.

boom boom boom —

Those vast bolts of lightning struck the ground and there was a huge sound after another.

The whole ground shook at this moment.

The spectators in the auditorium in the distance around them all exclaimed at this time.

The ground was split into a large number of pits by the lightning and the battle platform was directly turned into tofu scum.

“‘Sphere’!!!”

Looking at the sky, there was still terrifying lightning that was about to hit his body. Nan Jing was frightened and suddenly let out a roar.

All the source strength in the body was mobilized, then a ‘Sphere’ was formed for protection.

boom–

But unlike what he imagined, his ‘Sphere’ couldn’t resist this lightning at all!

The terrifying thunder and lightning struck his ‘Sphere’ and a loud noise suddenly came out.

His ‘Sphere’ exploded immediately!

“what!!!”

Immediately afterward, the lightning struck his body continuously.

The severe pain made him cry continuously.

Logically speaking, his source mark was lightning and his resistance to lightning was very high.

But what he didn’t expect was that the lightning that Lin Xiu used was extremely terrifying.

The lightning bolts directly burnt his body black.

His body suspended in the air, in the next moment, fell directly and fell heavily to the ground.

“Old Master Nan Jing slandered me back then and wanted to take my life. Those who participated in that battle should be ready to die.”

Lin Xiu’s body was suspended in the air and he said coldly.

His words instantly spread throughout the entire Sky City.

Some people who participated in the battle to encircle and suppress Lin Xiu couldn’t help trembling.

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s body gradually lowered.

He stepped on Nan Jing’s chest.

pfft—

Nan Jing, who was seriously injured to the end, vomited out a mouthful of blood at this moment.

“Tell me, where did those people come from.”

Lin Xiu stared at Nan Jing at his feet and said lightly.

“Ha ha ha ha!”

At this time, Nan Jing’s mouth was full of blood, but he still laughed wildly.

“You will be doomed and the entire earth will also be destroyed!”

He looked crazy.

“Are you telling me or not.”

“You will all die, you will all die!”

He seemed to have become crazy, still roaring loudly.

boom–

The next moment, Lin Xiu stepped harder, killing Nan Jing.

His strength, for some unknown reason, has risen to the peak level of the master warrior level in the past year.

On earth, it was indeed the peak.

However, he never imagined that his strength had already reached the level of Respected warrior.

boom boom boom —

And at this moment, a loud noise came from all directions!
