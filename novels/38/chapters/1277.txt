1278 Hostility

“City… City Lord!?”

As soon as his body relaxed, Lei Tong looked at Lin Xiu and immediately said gratefully.

It was obvious just now that Lin Xiu helped him get rid of that extremely uncomfortable feeling.

“Humph!”

!!

Seeing this scene, some God warrior level warriors snorted coldly.

It was the power they released just now, deliberately suppressing this little Sage warrior.

Unexpectedly, Lin Xiu actually intervened.

This made them glance at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu didn’t care about these people’s eyes at all and smiled at Lei Tong and said, “It’s nothing.”

“En.”

At this time, Baili Haoling was looking at the God warriors around her, her hands clenched the double swords hanging from her waist and her body trembled slightly. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

So many warriors! She couldn’t wait to fight.

Seeing Baili Haoling’s expression, Lin Xiu couldn’t help shaking his head helplessly.

This Baili Haoling was indeed a militant.

Soon, it would soon be Lin Xiu and others’ turn to go for the inspection.

At this time, Lin Xiu looked at the giants with human faces and beast bodies on both sides and his Analytic eyes were activated.

But the moment the Analytic eyes were activated, a strong killing intent came from their eyes.

And this killing intent quickly locked onto Lin Xiu.

Sensing this murderous intent, Lin Xiu’s body suddenly turned cold and his Analytic eyes stopped working instantly.

Two horrific murderous auras wandered around Lin Xiu’s body for a while before disappearing.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but secretly heaved a sigh of relief at this time. What kind of strength are these two orc-like monsters? They are so powerful just from their murderous aura.

“Please show your identification.”

At this time, it happened to be Lin Xiu and others’ turn to enter the city gate.

The guard at the gate of the city glanced at Lin Xiu, then said lightly.

“Give.”

Lin Xiu nodded, then handed the black card to the guard.

The guard held the black card and the card suddenly shone with white light.

“Are you the city lord of Lingxian City?”

At this moment, while handing the card back to Lin Xiu, he said.

“yes.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

“These two are your followers?”

He looked at Baili Haoling and Lei Tong.

“yes.”

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, the guard held a special machine and glanced at Lei Tong and Baili Haoling.

“This one doesn’t have an ID. You must leave the city of God immediately after the competition.”

The guard spoke to Lei Tong.

“OK.”

At this time, Lei Tong hurriedly spoke up.

“It’s the same with you, please go back to your original city after it’s over.”

The guard continued to speak to Lin Xiu.

“Ok.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

“go in.”

He waved his hand, then Lin Xiu and others walked in directly.

“Lin Xiu, did you see, there are so many powerful warriors!”

As soon as he walked in, Baili Haoling said excitedly.

“It would be great if we could fight against them.”

“Come on, these people are not simple.”

Seeing Baili Haoling’s excited expression, Lin Xiu said helplessly.

Now that there were so many powerful God warriors here, the strength of Lin Xiu and others seemed a little insignificant.

“Besides, it’s not the time for the competition yet. There will be more powerful fighters appearing at that time.”

Lin Xiu continued talking.

At this time, everyone was walking on the streets of the city of God and they showed expressions of incomparable surprise along the way.

...

The ground of this city of god looks as if it is made of colorful glass and was extremely gorgeous.

Moreover, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the surrounding air contained extremely strong energy.

Practicing in this kind of place would allow them to improve at a tremendous pace.

Lin Xiu didn’t feel that the strength of those warriors who were going back and forth around them was very low.

Standing on Lin Xiu’s shoulders, Rollie and Xiao Bai looked around, as if they were very curious about everything around them.

“It’s here.”

After everyone walked for a long distance, Lin Xiu saw the hotel in front of him, which occupied a very large area.

City of God Hotel.

As a contestant, their lodging has already been arranged.

After entering the hotel, Lin Xiu took out the black card and the receptionist at the front desk had already started arranging rooms for Lin Xiu and others.

There were three rooms in total, one for each person, all on the same floor.

...

“On the 100th floor…”

Baili Haoling couldn’t help being surprised when she saw the number of floors.

“En, go back and rest first and come out to take a look at night.”

Lin Xiu said.

after flying for so long, although their source strength has not been consumed much, but Lin Xiu did not want to continue walking.

And they just arrived in the city of God, Lin Xiu wanted to check the routes in the city and make arrangements for what to do next.

“Well, okay, anyway, I kind of want to sleep.”

Baili Haoling stretched and said.

Everyone entered the elevator and soon reached the 100th floor.

Ding–

With a crisp sound, the elevator door opened.

But the moment Lin Xiu and the others stepped out of the elevator, the expressions of the three of them changed at the same time.

It seemed that an extremely powerful force was attacking them at this moment.

Poof——

Lei Tong, who was weaker, had already spat out a mouthful of blood at this moment.

He seemed to feel that all the organs in his body were about to burst.

Just like before, it’s all the mental power released by those powerful warriors above the level of God warrior.

But this force was much stronger than before.

Rollie and Xiao Bai on Lin Xiu’s shoulders were a little pissed off.

Lin Xiu put his hand on his shoulder and the source strength in his body was transmitted to his body.

“我们的房间,是10025,10026和10027.”

“Our rooms are 10025, 10026 and 10027.”

While talking to himself, Lin Xiu looked at the guides on the surrounding walls. Rooms 25, 26 and 27 on the 100th floor are right in front.

And this extremely powerful force also came from the front.

At this time, Baili Haoling’s eyes had turned red.

And Lin Xiu’s whole body’s source strength was mobilized at this time.

This person’s power was very strong, without any real attack, just releasing this power made it difficult for him to even walk.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly. He really wanted to see who it was over there.

There was a corner up ahead and after the corner was their room.

Come on… out!
