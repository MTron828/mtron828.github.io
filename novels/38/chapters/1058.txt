Chapter 1059: The Peculiar Green Energy

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

This was impossible!

When the right guardian saw what happened, his eyes were stretched wide.

The ice picks that he had realised were floating next to Lin Xiu and they were not attacking Lin Xiu’s body!

This scene was incredibly odd!

“I am better than you at using these skills.”

!!

Lin Xiu looked at the right guardian who was standing right in front of him and spoke in a calm tone.

“Run!!!”

Elder Lin seemed to have realised something and quickly warned the right guardian from behind.

‘Go!’

Lin Xiu quickly gathered his thoughts and soon, all of the ice picks that were headed toward Lin Xiu turned around and was attacking the right guardian instead!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

“This is impossible!!!”

When the right guardian saw what happened, his eyes were filled with shock.

These ice picks that were built with his own energy from the source mark was attacking him!

This was definitely something that he thought was impossible.

However, this was truly happening as well.

These ice picks were coming from all directions. He was now trapped inside such a small space and there was nowhere that he could hide.

The only thing that he could do was to block them with his ‘sphere’!

Boom boom boom – –

As the ice picks landed on his ‘sphere’, there were loud explosions that followed it.

“AHHHHHHH!!!!!”

The right guardian screamed out loud as he realised all of the energy that he had left in order to strengthen his ‘sphere’.

However, the impact of these ice picks were scary.

The right guardian had already released his ‘sphere’ but the scary impact that came from the ice picks caused his body to be thrown far away. As he fell onto the array behind him, there was another loud sound that came from the collision.

There were too many ice picks and they kept coming at him nonstop.

His ‘sphere’ was still blocking the continuous attacks coming from the ice picks and soon, there were cracks all over his ‘sphere’!

“Go to hell!!!”

At the same time, Elder Lin rushed toward Lin Xiu.

Now, there was a green source mark that appeared on his forehead.

There was also a ball of green energy that was headed at Lin Xiu!

What’s this?

When he saw the green energy ball coming at him, Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank subconsciously.

Xiu – –

He quickly moved and Lin Xiu disappeared from the spot where he was at.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Most of the ice picks were covered by the green energy and all of them melted instantly.

Where did he go?!

Elder Lin’s pupil shrink. This was because he noticed that Lin Xiu was now standing right in front of him!

He was so quick!

Clang – –

His body’s reflex caused him to place the machete in front of body.

The tip of the long spear that Lin Xiu was holding onto, collided with his machete.

With the loud ring, his entire body was thrown far away into the distance.

Boom – –

His body that flew into the distance finally landed on the array.

With the strong impact, he had a mouth full of blood.

However, he didn’t have time to care about his injuries as he realised that Lin Xiu was about to attack him!

“Breaking Mountains and Heaven Strike!!!!”

When he saw Lin Xiu with the long spear, Elder Lin gripped onto his machete and shouted in rage.

As he shouted, there was a ray of energy that came out of the source mark that was on his forehead.

The green energy was then headed towards Lin Xiu through his long spear!

There were small cracks that soon appeared in the space around them.

Seeing how the green energy was still coming at him, Lin Xiu subconsciously released his ‘sphere’.

The attack that he got from this green energy caused Lin Xiu to be thrown far away.

Then, the green energy slowly crawled onto Lin Xiu’s body.

What one earth was this?!

This green energy was about to penetrate through Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’ and was getting onto his body!

This was the first time that Lin Xiu had seen something so scary but at the same time, it was shocking as well.

Soon, he felt an intense pain coming from all over his body.

This green energy had a strong corroding effect!

Soon, they could see with their bare eyes that Lin Xiu’s skin started to corrode.

“He’s dead.”

Elder Lin wiped off the blood on the corner of his mouth.

It was extremely difficult for him to aim the green energy onto someone else.

He only managed to do it by placing it on his machete and allowing it to be transferred to Lin Xiu, who was about to attack him.

This green energy of his was able to penetrate through a warrior’s ‘sphere’!

“Right Guardian, are you alright?”

After seeing Lin Xiu being covered in green energy, he turned around and looked in the other direction.

“I’m…..fine.”

The right guardian’s ‘sphere’ has been completely destroyed by the ice picks. Some of it had pierced through his shoulder and there was blood pouring out of it.

His face was now looking extremely pale.

From the look of it, he was definitely severely injured.

“Don’t move!”

Elder Lin rushed to his side and then took out a bottle from his pocket.

As he opened it, there was a blue liquid that was poured onto his wound.

Soon, his wounds were recovering quickly.

“That fella should be dead now…”

The right guardian spoke while gritting his teeth.

The blue liquid might have been able to fasten the recovery of his wounds but there was still an intense pain that came from it.

This was not something that anyone could stand.

“He must be.”

Elder Lin nodded his head.

He finally got to give out a breath of relief.

This battle has been extremely aggressive. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He almost died in the hands of Lin Xiu.

“That young man…..how did they train him to be so strong?”

Elder Lin asked in rage.

Lin Xiu, who was now covered by the green energy, was covered in blood.

All of the skin on his body had been corroded!

Pain! He felt terrible pain all over his body!

However, Lin Xiu’s body has a very strong recovery ability. As his skin was being corroded, they were quickly being healed as well.

With Lin Xiu’s mind, he was able to control the blue-colored energy ball that hung around his neck. Then, there was a bright blue light released from it.

Then, there were large amounts of droplets seen in the air.

“What are these…”

Elder Lin and the right guardian suddenly realised that there were water droplets inside the array and they were both shocked.

The array was still around them which meant that Lin Xiu wasn’t dead!

Then, both of them turned towards Lin Xiu.

That’s when they noticed that amongst the green energy, there was also a bright blue light coming from inside it!
