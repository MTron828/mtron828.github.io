Chapter 263: Killing Zhou Wenhao (2)

Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist!!!!

Lin Xiu’s fist that was enveloped by lightning smashed onto Zhou Wenhao’s body!

Rumble-

It produced an extremely loud vacuum explosion followed by flickering lightning.

Zhou Wenhao did not see Lin Xiu’s punch as he had lost his vision.

His body wanted to dodge instinctively at the sense of danger, but it was too late.

The punch landed right on Zhou Wenhao’s abdomen and sent a large amount of electric current through his entire body!

The impact of the punch forced him a long distance back!

“Damn it!”

Zhou Wenhao had obviously gone through electric shock resistance training, so Lin Xiu’s punch did not affect him too much.

But Lin Xiu’s Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist made Zhou Wenhao feel as though the organs at his abdomen had ruptured.

He was in immense pain.

Especially with something blocking his eyes, it made him grow even more berserk.

He reached out wanting to grab the object but realized that it was extremely slippery. He could not grab it at all!

Qiu Li and the others were stunned at the sight of this.

Because they were able to see an object that resembled a blue ball of flesh that stuck itself onto Zhou Wenhao.

This object was, without a doubt, Rollie.

It jumped out of Lin Xiu’s back and plastered itself on Zhou Wenhao’s face, blocking his vision entirely.

As Zhou Wenhao struggled with all his might to pull Rollie from his body, it moved and stabbed right into his eyes!

Bang-

Following a loud sound, blood trickled down his face.

“ARGHHH!!!”

Zhou Wenhao let out a loud wail.

“Die! Go and die!!!”

He roared out loud and frantically tried to pull Rollie out of his face.

But for some reason, no matter how hard he tried to pull Rollie off, Rollie was unable to come off.

Blood kept on trickling down from his face.

Rollie jumped and separated from Zhou Wenhao’s face on its own accord.

It quickly returned to Lin Xiu’s side.

Lin Xiu looked at Zhou Wenhao and saw that his eyes were bleeding.

His eyeballs had disappeared and his eyes were left with blood sockets. It was an extremely pitiful sight.

Lin Xiu looked at Rollie that had crawled up to his shoulder. He never thought that the adorable Rollie would actually dig Zhou Wenhao’s eyes out.

Zhou Wenhao had gone crazy from losing his eyes. His body erupted with powerful source strength as he started unleashing punches all around him.

Explosions were produced continuously from his punches.

Zhou Wenhao looked like a maniac that had gone crazy.

Although the punches sounded horrifying, it was an extremely good opportunity, the perfect opportunity to kill a rank 7 warrior!

With this, Lin Xiu’s eyes flashed with a ferocious glint.

He shot forward without hesitation when he unleashed power in his feet and charged right towards Zhou Wenhao!

He had transformed the pain from losing his eyes into his berserk. Although he was blind, he could still hear and he reacted against Lin Xiu.

He attacked in the direction where Lin Xiu was approaching!

Lin Xiu sneered, Zhou Wenhao no longer wielded a weapon and his strength had dropped greatly.

And he had lost his eyes and vision.

Lin Xiu dodged his attack as both of his fists got enveloped by lightning.

Whoosh-

Thunder sounds came out as Lin Xiu’s fists landed right on Zhou Wenhao’s body!

Rumble-

After a series of loud sounds, Lin Xiu’s fists released a series of punches on Zhou Wenhao’s body!

Zhou Wenhao was able to retaliate at the beginning. But as time passed, he was no longer able to defend himself due to the sounds.

Punch after punch cracked all of the bones in his body and the crackles sounded all across his body.

Under the relentless Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fists, Zhou Wenhao was bloodied upside down.

As Lin Xiu executed Divine Wind Kick, Zhou Wenhao was sent crashing into a tree.

Bang-

The crash produced a loud sound.

Zhou Wenhao slowly slid down to the floor.

He remained unmoved as though he was dead.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations master for killing rank 7 warrior! Obtaining 300 million experience points!”

The notification sounded out. Lin Xiu was stunned and he felt as though all the energy in his body had disappeared. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Bang-

He fell straight down to the floor and laid down in a ‘大’ manner.

“Whew, whew.”

Lin Xiu gasped for breath, the aftereffects of Fury set in and it made him feel completely weak.

But fortunately, Zhou Wenhao was dead.

And he gave so many experience points!

‘I’ll be able to level up very soon!’

He was already a rank 5 warrior and the progress had become much slower. Every increase in level would lead to an exponential increase in strength of his body.

“He’s dead?”

Guo Ling and the others regained their senses as they looked at Zhou Wenhao’s completely bloodied body with shock in their eyes.

This battle was 80% between Lin Xiu and Zhou Wenhao.

Their opportunities were extremely few.

“Lin Xiu, are you alright?”

Guo Ling saw Zhou Wenhao unmoved and affirmed he was dead before walking over to Lin Xiu and asked him when she saw him all spread out.

“I’m fine, I need a break.” Lin Xiu gasped and replied.

Lin Xiu was feeling fatigued, it was not easy killing a rank 7 warrior.

Part of the contribution was Rollie for digging his eyes out.

Rollie had crawled back into Lin Xiu’s bag.

“Guo Ling, Zhou Wenhao’s dead!” Chen Jin was by Zhou Wenhao’s side and he called out.

Guo Ling nodded her head and turned to Lin Xiu, “Take out your phone.”

“It’s in the side pocket of my bag.”
