Chapter 925: Luo Yue Kidnapped!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Luo Yue’s condition was definitely a headache for them.

Once every two days, she would suddenly fall into a deep slumber and there was no cure for it.

“Well, of course. As long as I return to my planet and learn the skills from my ancestors, I will be able to easily treat this condition.”

“Luo Yue...”

Luo Zhen and Luo Yue looked at Luo Yue.

“I need to wait for him.”

Luo Yue answered flatly.

She was determined with her choice.

Nalan Ruo frowned instead.

“I don’t care who you are waiting for but you need to know that you will never be on the same level as that person. You will become a warrior god, a person above all!”

Nalan Ruo roared.

“Sp....my apologies!”

As soon as she finished her sentence, her figure suddenly appeared next to Luo Yue.

Before Luo Yue could react, the woman had already held onto her and rushed towards the hole that the woman made earlier!

When Nalan Ruo and Luo Yue disappeared, the hole disappeared as well.

“Luo Yue!!!”

Luo Yan and Luo Zhen ran forward and screamed.

However, it was already too late. Luo Yue was already gone.

“Damn it...”

Luo Yan was worried about her sister more than anyone else.

On the other side, on the Namir Planet, Lin Xiu was still sitting on the highest step of the stairs. He was still cultivating the new warrior skills card that he had just obtained.

As he continued cultivating, Lin Xiu could clearly feel how powerful and strong this skill was.

The sage warrior skills card was beyond all the motion-type skills.

Especially when he had ‘flashing soul’ that worked exactly like teleportation!

Huuuuu – –

When Lin Xiu had completely absorbed all of the information from the card, he stood up and took a deep breath.

Dang!

That feels good!!

He looked down at the people below him and those from the Black Troops were still staring at Lin Xiu.

They seem to be waiting for Lin Xiu to walk down the stairs so that they could kill him.

Lin Xiu took a good look at the people below him.

He narrowed his eyes and slowly walked down the stairs.

Most of the energy around here has been absorbed by Lin Xiu earlier.

This was why he didn’t feel much resistance as he walked down the stairs.

“Finish him!”

Lin Xiu was walking down the stairs when Feng Zheng roared out loud.

The warriors from the Black Troops already had their weapons prepared.

As soon as Lin Xiu got down from the stairs, the warriors immediately attacked him! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Since the long distance attacks were all blocked by Lin Xiu, they have decided to have a close combat with him.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frown.

He stretched out his left arm and a long spear appeared in his hand.

The long spear was originally black in colour. As Lin Xiu transferred his source energy into the spear, the long spear slowly turned into a purple gold colour.

“Kill him!!!!!!”

The warriors from the Black Troops screamed but then they were stopped by the flaming birds that looked extremely horrifying.

The flames that surrounded the flaming birds were dark blue in colour and there was a spot of gold in the centre of it.

This was the strength that he got from the Divine Spark. The flaming birds that Lin Xiu released now were much more powerful than the ones before.

As soon as they were released, the air around them was scorched.

The temperature in that place was instantly raised by a few degrees celsius.

The warriors could feel how terrifying these flaming birds were and quickly released their ‘spheres’.

But....it still didn’t stop the scary part from happening!

Boom boom boom – –

The flaming birds crashed onto their ‘sphere’ making a loud sound.

Their ‘sphere’s were soon melted by the heat from the flaming birds!

The warrior bodies immediately caught on fire and were burnt to ash.

Within seconds, Lin Xiu had already killed all the warriors that surrounded him!

“This is impossible!”

Feng Zheng screamed with an awful look on his face.

He tightened his grip on his machete. Just as he was about to attack Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu’s figure had suddenly appeared right in front of him.

Feng Zheng was terrified and he quickly placed his machete right in front of him.

Clang – –

With the sound of metal colliding with each other, the machete in his hands was thrown away!

Lin Xiu’s long spear ended up heading towards his forehead!

Suddenly, Feng Zheng’s forehead started glowing with a bright white light and it looked like his sourcemark had been activated.

His entire body suddenly disappeared.

Lin Xiu had missed his attack.

“Huh?”

Lin Xiu was surprised to see what had happened.

He quickly turned around and saw Fneg Zheng who was standing far away from him.

Feng Zheng was panting, trying to catch his breath while his forehead was full of sweat.

That moment was horrifying.

If he reacted a little late, his head would have been pierced through by Lin Xiu’s spear.

Fortunately, he had his sourcemark even though it wasn’t one with an offence ability.

His sourcemark has the ability to teleport his body.

It may seem weak but it was still important and useful during crucial times.

Especially like what happened earlier.

“Who are you?!”

Feng Zheng stared at Lin Xiu and screamed.

His body was still trembling from the fear.

He was a respected warrior but his abilities were still much below Lin Xiu and it felt as if Lin Xiu was about to kill him.

The difference in their abilities made Feng Zheng wonder that Lin Xiu definitely wasn’t some one ordinary.

Hu Ling and the rest of the White Troops were no longer getting attacked by the Black Troops and most of them finally stood up.

All of them were staring at Lin Xiu as well.

What they have seen so far was shocking and terrifying.

“You can ask that in hell.”

Lin Xiu answered in a monotonous tone. The black spear in his hand started shivering as well after having the overpowering energy being transferred into it.

Feng Zheng realised that he was in trouble and quickly ran for his life!
