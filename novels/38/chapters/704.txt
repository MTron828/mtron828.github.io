Chapter 705 Purification Domain’

‘Purification Domain’

The number of flaming birds was too many and at this moment, they directly blocked the vision of these people.

All they saw in their eyes were these flames.

“Damn!”

These warriors cursed secretly, then quickly unfolded their ‘Sphere’ for protection.

Because there were so many areas on the top of the mountain, it was quite troublesome to dodge it.

But even though they used the ‘Sphere’ to dodge, they could still feel the terrifying temperature from these flames.

The temperature was so high that sweat dripped from their cheeks.

Boom–

A warrior was using a ‘Sphere’ to block the flames because all he could see were flames. Before he could react, he felt a terrifying shock.

The entire Sphere was directly destroyed by the impact.

How can that be!!!

He roared inwardly, but before he had time to react, a flaming bird directly impacted his body!

Without the protection of the ‘Sphere’, the terrifying temperature of the flaming bird instantly scorched his whole body.

As in the case of this man, the ‘Spheres’ unfolded by the rest of the warriors were all destroyed one by one.

“What!!!”

Shrilling voices kept coming.

Although these warriors were strong in flesh, under the impact of the flaming bird mixed with the fire of the red lotus, all of them were so burned that their skins turned black.

“What is happening!!!”

The old man opened his eyes wide at this moment, looking at the scenes in front of him, his eyes were filled with utter shock.

His subordinates’ ‘Spheres’ were broken in such a short period of time?!

How can that be!

Sphere is the hardest shield of a warrior, how could it be easily destroyed by that guy? The members of the Lu family also opened their eyes wide, looking at the scene in front of them with disbelief.

After all, the impact of breaking the ‘Sphere’ was too great for them.

What’s more, the people who just rushed up are all rank 8 warriors!

A dozen or so rank 8 warriors were wiped out in such an instant.

This impact was too terrifying for them.

“That’s all?”

Just when they were shocked, they heard a voice coming from the flames in front of them.

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand, looked at them and said.

Apart from the rank 8 warriors who had just been killed by him, the old man in front was a Master warrior-level powerhouse.

And the rest was rank 9 and some rank 8. This kind of power, in Sky City, is absolutely terrifying

But now, Lin Xiu didn’t show any fear at all.

With the increase in strength, after unlocking the gene lock, Lin Xiu gained much more power than other warriors of the same rank. At this time, Lin Xiu’s body was filled with strength. “You…”

The old man looked at Lin Xiu and gritted his teeth.

The strength that Lin Xiu showed was obviously the strength at his peak, but Lin Xiu and Wu Changkong just had a fierce fight. How could he still maintain his current strength?

“Get him! This guy is an arrow at the end of its flight, he’s bluffing!” Although the old man said so he did not dare to act rashly.

Wu Changkong’s overall strength was better than this old man and this was what he was proud of before.

Now that Lin Xiu could even kill Wu Changkong, he might be able to kill him too. He didn’t dare to take this risk.

“Yes!”

Following the old man’s order, several rank 9 warriors attacked Lin Xiu directly!

And Lin Xiu stood there, looking at the incoming people, he didn’t move at all.

It’s not like he couldn’t react, but like… he doesn’t care at all. II The Domain of Swords’!”

“Flame Dragon Domain!” When these rank 9 warriors rushed towards Lin Xiu, they directly activated their domain abilities.

At this moment, all kinds of rays of light appeared on the entire ground because of the appearance of a large number of domain forces.

“Kill him!”

At this moment, these rank 9 warriors attacked and surrounded Lin Xiu directly.

“‘Purification Domain’.”

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his right hand and pointed straight at the sky. At this moment, a dazzling light burst out from his body.

It directly covered the entire ground.

The domain power they used just now was completely covered up at this moment. “What domain ability is this!?”

When a man saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed.

The domain abilities that several of them used were all cleared at this moment.

All of their attack plans were disrupted at once.

And when all of their skills attacked Lin Xiu’s body, Lin Xiu disappeared!

“Where are you looking?”.

And at this moment, a voice came from behind a rank 9 warrior.

The pupils of the rank 9 warrior shrank suddenly and he unfolded the ‘Sphere’!

Boom–

But even so, he still felt that he was hit by an incomparably terrifying force and he flew out directly, hitting the ground heavily and creating a huge crater. “Damn!”

The rest of the rank 9 warriors also reacted, turning sharply to look at Lin Xiu who appeared behind, then holding the weapon in their hand, they frantically attacked Lin Xiu.

Looking at the attacks of these rank 9 warriors, Lin Xiu frowned slightly, using the Dark Edge spear in his hand to constantly resist.

Lin Xiu’s speed was very fast, even in the face of several rank 9 warriors’ attacks, he could use the Dark Edge spear to resist.

“This guy is really only rank 9?”

Lu Jian looked at the old man of the Wu family beside him and said aloud.

What a monster, even under the siege of several rank 9 warriors, he was able to resist all their attacks.

“Don’t know.”

The old man said with a gloomy expression at this time.

Because if Lin Xiu’s strength was only rank 9, it would be impossible to have such a powerful strength and even Wu Changkong was killed. However, if Lin Xiu had the strength of a master warrior, when Lin Xiu mobilized his source strength, it was impossible not to have the mark of a master warrior on his forehead, which was the source mark.

“Hmph, I don’t believe it, let’s see how long more you can last.”

The old man clenched his hands into fists and stared at Lin Xiu over there.

“Go to hell!!!”

A rank 9 warrior saw that his attack was blocked by Lin Xiu again and suddenly became furious and directly used his most powerful skill.
