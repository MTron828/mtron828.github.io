Chapter 751: Crisis Emerges

“It’s definitely impossible to kill it with just us.”

Liu Pan smiled, then continued, “Because this raging flame lion killed many high-level warriors and collected the weapons and treasures of those warriors into their own caves, so many warriors really want to kill it.”

“As long as you kill it, you can enter its cave and get those treasures.”

“It is said that this evolved beast also killed many high-level evolved beasts and there are also a large number of odd crystals in the cave.”

“In this month of every year, the raging flame lion will also be active and many big forces will come to besiege and kill. We just need to take advantage of this.”

Liu Pan seemed to have a good idea.

“I’m afraid it’s not that simple.”

Lin Xiu smiled and didn’t say much.

“Brother Lin, you should go with us to hunt evolved beasts first. After a few days, we will go to Fengyun City together.”

Liu Pan continued, looking at Lin Xiu as if looking forward to it.

After all, the strength that Lin Xiu had just shown really convinced Liu Pan.

“Fine.”

Lin Xiu spread his hands and said, there was no better way now.

He was also very unfamiliar with this Marqi planet.

“Welcome to the team.”

Xiao Qiang and Zhao Kai also spoke to Lin Xiu at this time.

“Thanks.”

Lin Xiu didn’t say much, which made the two of them a little awkward.

At this time, the group of six continued to move forward.

Time passed quickly and it didn’t take long for the scorching sun in the sky to begin setting.

And the surroundings suddenly turned from grassland to forest.

During this process, Lin Xiu also saw many other warrior teams.

These people also seem to have come out to hunt evolved beasts, carrying large bags and the fur of evolved beasts on their shoulders.

Liu Pan and the others looked at the other warrior groups very cautiously and the other warrior groups also watched Lin Xiu and the others cautiously. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The people on both sides didn’t speak and they passed by quickly.

In this kind of place, no one can see whether the other party will be hostile to them.

There were also many incidents of killing people and stealing treasures.

And after walking into the forest, Lin Xiu also found that there were quite a few warrior corpses on the ground.

“Looks like they just died not long ago.”

Lin Xiu, who was walking in front, looked at the corpses of the warriors on the ground and said lightly.

And Liu Pan also crouched down and looked at the corpses and said, “The sword injury was not by evolved beasts, but was fighting against other warriors.”

“Be careful.”

The faces of Xiao Qiang and Zhao Kai also became serious.

And Qian Lin and An Qi also clenched the weapons in their hands and subconsciously approached Lin Xiu.

After all, Lin Xiu’s strength was relatively strong.

Moreover, the strength of these killed warriors was not very low, it was very dangerous here.

“Where are you going, do you want to continue this way?”

Lin Xiu pointed to the area in front and said.

“Well, there is a huge canyon over there. Every year, many warriors go there to hunt.”

“I even picked up a rank 10 odd crystal there last year!”

Rank 10 odd crystal!

The rank 10 evolved beast is a special evolved beast that is similar to the king level.

The size is not as huge as the king level, but the strength is similar.

Xiao Qiang and others all showed envy.

“There are a lot of evolved beasts over there. They will fight each other when they become active at this time of the year. We can take advantage of this.” Liu Pan chuckled.

“Be careful, I feel something is wrong.”

From the moment he walked here, Lin Xiu could vaguely feel that he was being stared at by something.

This feeling made Lin Xiu very uncomfortable.

“There should be no one around...” An Qi said a little worriedly.

Her eyes looked around. Although the sun was setting, it didn’t have much impact on a high-level warrior.

Her eyes could still see the area in the distance, but besides these tall trees, there seemed to be nothing else around.

Everyone continued to walk forward, but because of the corpses of the warriors they had just discovered, a strange atmosphere permeated everyone’s hearts.

It seemed a little depressing.

Swoosh—

At this moment, a swooshing sound suddenly came over.

“Careful!”

Lin Xiu seemed to sense something, the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly, then he called out.

Lin Xiu, who was standing at the front, dodged to one side of his body.

Boom–

An arrow brushed past Lin Xiu’s face and directly hit a thick ancient tree behind.

Boom—

As the arrow shot over, the ancient tree with a huge trunk suddenly exploded.

It exploded in an instant!

When Liu Pan and others saw this scene, they were all shocked.

Their eyes hurriedly looked around, but they saw no trace of anyone at all.

Lin Xiu has already clenched the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

Arrow, someone actually used an arrow.

This kind of weapon looks very ancient, but the weapon has such great power.

Needless to say, this must be the effect of the warrior using his own source strength.

“At eight o’clock!”

Qian Lin seemed to sense something and said abruptly.

Hearing her words, Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

A large amount of black energy was suddenly released from the spear.

In the next moment, it turned into a black giant dragon and charged directly over there!

Behind a giant tree over there, there seems to be a figure hidden and as the black giant dragon rushed away, it quickly dodged.

Boom—

Because of the impact of the black dragon, the trees over there all dodged instantly.

“At two o’clock, from the side and back, there are warriors coming!”

Qian Lin was concentrating on sensing something, then her face changed and she said aloud.

She also never imagined that so many people would appear in this short moment.

When it was clear that just now, there was no one there.

“Qian Lin has a special talent for sensing. It’s right to listen to her.”

Holding the double-sided axe in both hands, Liu Pan said very calmly.

And An Qi was already holding the giant sword in her hand and seemed to be muttering something and the source strength in her body also burst out.

On the contrary, the two men, Xiao Qiang and Zhao Kai, seemed to panic a little because of fear.

“Humph!”

Hearing the positions reported by Qian Lin just now, Lin Xiu snorted coldly, the Dark Edge spear spun in his hand, then he continued to wave it in the air and the flaming birds rushed out from these directions!

The way these people hid their aura was very good, making it difficult for people to feel it.

Boom—

And as the flaming bird rushed out, the surrounding areas instantly turned into a sea of ??fire!
