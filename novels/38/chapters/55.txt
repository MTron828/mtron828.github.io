Chapter 56: Torrential Storm Of Rose Flowers, Killing Five In A Second!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

A long-haired man that remained silent the entire time and stood behind them suddenly spoke up.

Xu Wen frowned as the man was at least rank 3 or above and gave him a dangerous feeling.

“Brat, you really know how to look. You found a mechanical sword the last time and actually found a Mark III Android.” A knowledgeable man eyed at the android greedily and spoke to Lin Xiu.

These things could be said to be obsolete. Who would have thought that they would encounter a perfect set here?

Taking it to sell could earn them a lot of union coins!

They were most willing to act on zero risk and high reward misdeeds to earn a large number of coins.

“Come, put down your things and give them to us.” As Lin Xiu was extremely cooperative the last time and passed them the mechanical sword, he thought that Lin Xiu would do the same. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“You really want it?” Lin Xiu frowned and asked.

“Bullsh*t, give them to me!” The man sneered and extended his hand towards Lin Xiu.

Sou-

Right at this instant, a cold light flashed as the man’s pupils narrowed. His body attempted to dodge instinctively, but he was too late!

“You…” The man lowered his head and looked at his chest to see a silver spear in his body.

He looked at it in disbelief, why did Lin Xiu, who could be bullied so easily the previous time, suddenly take action?

“Sorry, I can’t give my things to dead people.” Lin Xiu sneered and pulled the spear out of the man’s body.

His shoulder was hurt the last time and he was forced to inaction, but he was fully recovered, and his strength had improved greatly as well.

‘Are you not seeking death and giving me free experience points to try and take my things?’

“Ding~~~”

“Congratulations master for killing a rank 1 warrior, earning 4500 experience.”

En? To actually yield 4500 experience points, it seemed like he was about to become a rank 2 warrior.

The surrounding became extremely quiet, no one would have thought that Lin Xiu would kill their comrade without saying a word!

“Seeking death!!!” The man at the opposite side regained himself and launched an attack towards Lin Xiu with his weapon.

They thought that the man was killed by Lin Xiu due to the surprise attack. After all, Lin Xiu looked young and they did not believe he was as strong as the man.

“Kill!” Xu Wen’s eyes constricted as he roared out loud.

They did not have a choice the last time, but after a month of combat, they had raised their individual strength, especially Xu Wen. He had reached the level of a rank 2 warrior!

Just as he said that, the android beside Lin Xiu took action and started to change!

“Is that… a transformer?” Li Yi’s eyes opened wide as he swallowed a mouthful of saliva and muttered in shock.

In a few seconds, the android transformed into an android wolf and crawled on the ground.

That was right, the most outstanding combat machines in the mech era were androids capable of transforming!

Lin Xiu jumped onto the android wolf and charged towards the front.

“What a scam!” The expressions of the enemies turned sinister when they saw Lin Xiu charging towards them on his android wolf.

They took out their own weapons and unleashed their various skills!

“Be careful!”

Xu Wen’s pupils constricted as he cried out.

The android wolf moved extremely fast and seemed to be able to anticipate its enemies’ movements and dodge accordingly.

“Hmph.” Lin Xiu snorted in disdain as he looked at the warriors. In the month, his individual strength had improved substantially and average rank 1 warriors no longer posed a threat to him.

Silver skill – Torrential storm of rose flowers!

Lin Xiu suddenly thrust forward with his spear!

A cold light ray flashed and suddenly transformed into many light rays in a second!

Bang bang bang!

As Lin Xiu rode past them, the warriors that were standing opened their eyes wide as they looked at their bodies in disbelief.

Every single person had one or two bloody holes on them. None of them knew what or how it happened, but they fell to the ground, dead.

Lin Xiu received many experience points notifications in his head.

After checking his stats board, he realized that he was lacking about 40 thousand experience points to level up!

“So...powerful.” Li Yi and the other soldiers that were about to rush forward opened their mouths wide in surprise.

They had seen Lin Xiu’s improvement over the month, but they did not expect it to be that perverse.

He actually killed 5 rank 1 warriors in a split second!

These were rank 1 warriors and not any amateurs grown along the road.

“Papapa”

“Torrential storm of rose flowers, to kill five in one second, you are indeed powerful.”

Right at this time, the long-haired man that had watched his own teammates die spoke out in admiration without any hint of anger.

The others did not see it clearly, but he saw everything. Lin Xiu’s attack had unleashed six strikes in a second.

Lin Xiu stared at him and replied indifferently, “Lone Wolf, Zhou Diaoyu.”

“Oh? You recognize me?” The long-haired man could not hide his surprise this time.

“No way, it’s him?!” Xu Wen’s ears were sharp and he exclaimed in shock when he heard the name.

This man was similar to the assassin Shadow from before, an important fugitive. But this man killed a group of federal soldiers and had a bounty even higher than Shadow. He was worth 200,000 union coins!

Lin Xiu suddenly thought about this. Who would have thought it would be this man?

What a ferocious man...

“The Lone Wolf that massacred an entire barracks?” Li Yi stared at the long hair with his mouth wide open.

“Captain…” The other three soldiers looked towards Xu Wen.

“Kill him.” Xu Wen looked at Zhou Diaoyu with a gloomy expression and eyes filled with rage.

His comrade had died at Zhou Diaoyu’s hands.

“Kill me? You think that you’re capable?” Zhou Diaoyu sneered, then took out a weapon that was wrapped in black cloth.

As he removed the black cloth, everyone could clearly see that it was a gigantic sword. An extremely gigantic broadsword!!
