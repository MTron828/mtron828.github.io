1434 1 vs “You’re Lin Xiu, right?”

Thank you readers!

Huangfu Yuanshen stared at Lin Xiu as he spoke.

“Who are you?”

Lin Xiu furrowed his brows.

He doesn’t remember ever seeing this man.

“My last name is Huangfu. Who do you think I am?”

Huangfu Yuansheng let out a cold laugh.

Huangfu?!

After hearing what he said, the look in his eyes changed.

So… these must be the leaders of those men that he had killed earlier in Warrior God Realm.

He didn’t think that they would all be God Kings.

Lin Xiu finally put on a solemn look on his face.

If there was only one of them, he may still be able to win them.

However, it would be impossible for him to win all four of them!

Boom boom – –

Luo Yue’s fight with the other warriors has already reached its peak.

With the help of the ‘Exotice Summoning’, Luo Yue, Little Bai and Rollie finally got the upper hand.

They seem to be able to retaliate as well.

Hetian God King noticed this as well and sneered.

As he lifted his arm, there was a horrifying energy beam that appeared from his index finger that was aimed at Luo Yue!

Lin Xiu looked around and his pupil shrank.

Suddenly, there were arrays that appeared all around Luo Yue!

There were a total of six layers around Luo Yue.

Boom – –

The laser beam released by the Hetian God King only managed to burn through 2 layers and the rest were unmoved.

Luo Yue looked over to the other side and noticed Ling Tianxi and the rest.

There were four God Kings!

All of them were giving off incredibly powerful energy aura and he was sure that they were God Kings! Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

With so many of them here, things were getting out of hand!

Roar!!!!!

The demon released from the other dimension, Little bai and Rollie had already killed the rest of the warriors around them!

“Little Bai, Rollie! Run!”

Lin Xiu roared.

Under such circumstances, both his pets would not be able to resist it.

With that said, Lin Xiu grabbed onto his spear and swung it in the air!

Boom – –

There were countless terrifying flaming birds that were released from the appear and were headed toward Ling Tianxi!

“Hmph!”

Ling Tianxi sneered and once again gathered the waters around her, releasing them towards the flaming birds.

These waters were the weakness of the Netherworld Flames and the power of those flames were instantly reduced.

[Energy Control!]

Lin Xiu continued using his other warrior skills.

Xiu – –

Then, there was a large amount of energy that rushed into Lin Xiu’s body.

Lin Xiu had already absorbed a lot of it earlier and now, his body started to expand as more energy entered his body.

It filled his entire body.

“Kill him!”

An Tiancheng had a bad feeling about it.

They had no idea how Lin Xiu was able to absorb the energy from his surroundings.

If they don’t get to kill him now, they would be in trouble if he absorbs even more energy!

Ling Tianxi and the rest noticed it as well and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Since all of them were God Kings, they were moving very quickly as well.

All of them appeared in front of Lin Xiu almost immediately.

Boom – –

However, at that moment, Lin Xiu suddenly released countless terrifying Netherworld’s Flames!

The Netherworld’s Flames gathered together to form a huge flame and it instantly covered around Lin Xiu’s body.

The God Kings who wanted to attack Lin Xiu had to stop.

These flames were something that they were afraid of as well.

However, Ling Tianxi, who controlled water, raised her arms and pushed a large amount of water towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu had a change of look in his eyes and quickly dodged the attack.

These waters were indeed the nemesis of his flames.

As Lin Xiu moved, these waters chased after him as if they were able to track his location!

Damn it!

Lin Xiu gathered his thoughts and activated the Heart of Frost once again.

Splash – –

Then, an overpowering chilly aura rushed toward the body of water.

All of them instantly froze.

However, Lin Xiu was aware that he wouldn’t be able to stop them for long.

Then, he quickly shook his long spear.

God-level warrior skills – [Sky Fire Meteor!]

The flames all over his body got dispersed and they were like meteorites that started showering the God Kings!

“Damn it! That brat!

An Tiancheng had a horrible look on his face.

Lin Xiu had too much energy in his body which was why he could release such powerful skills!

He wouldn’t be able to dodge it and could only stop it with his ‘sphere’.

This also applies to Huangfu Yuansheng and Hetian God King.

Thundering – –

As the meteorites landed on their ‘sphere’s, there were loud explosions that followed.

The impacts that came from these meteorites as they landed on their ‘sphere’s were incredibly terrifying.

All of them were forced to move backwards.

An Tiancheng could also feel the terrifying temperature that came from it even while being protected by his ‘sphere’.

As for Ling Tianxi, she was controlling the waters to protect herself.

She was preparing to attack Lin Xiu as soon as these meteorites disappeared!

She held onto her sword, wrapped it with her waters and thrusted it into Lin Xiu’s body!

Clang – –

Lin Xiu then moved his spear and it instantly collided with her long sword, letting out a huge sound.

The waters around her sword then slowly flowed over to the spear that Lin Xiu had been holding onto.

What was this?!

Lin Xiu suddenly felt that he was in trouble.

This is because these waters have caused the flames on his spear to become weaker.

“Go to hell!!!”

At the same time, due to how Lin Xiu released his warrior skills, most of the Netherworld’s Flames around his body disappeared.

An Tiancheng then rushed forward with a machete!

The machete that was drawn was covered with intense energy that there were gaps sliced open in the air.

Lin Xiu’s body was then sliced into two halves as well.

[Mirror Image!]

There were still three remaining ones that he had not used.

However, just when Lin Xiu’s actual body appeared on the other side, he saw Hetian God King swinging a huge sword at him!
