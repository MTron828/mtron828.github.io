Chapter 17: Slaughter!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The battle blade moved very swiftly and made a crisp sound as it sliced through the air.

“Dang!”

Li Hong wanted to use his long sword and wrap it around the battle blade, but he didn’t expect that the tremendous force would make him let go of his long sword!

A dreary “bang” resounded and the battle blade fell onto his shoulder directly and chopped his arm off!

“Who said that a rusty blade can’t kill, huh?” Lin Xiu sneered under Li Hong’s gaze of disbelief.

There was still quite a gap between a beginner warrior and rank 1 warrior. The most obvious difference was that a rank 1 warrior could cultivate skills.

Lin Xiu kept dodging just now and was even hurt by Li Hong from time to time because he wanted to fill up his rage meter!

With his Power-up strike, Li Hong didn’t have time to react at all.

“You will be… killed by them…” Li Hong spoke with a trembling voice.

In the next second, his body was split into two.

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 1 warrior. You’ve gained 3100 experience.”

“Congratulations Master on leveling up to level 10. You’ve gained 10 potential points!”

“Congratulations Master on reaching level 10. You’ve unlocked the skill- ‘Fury’.”

Hearing the system’s pleasing voice, Lin Xiu got excited. Level 10! He was finally level 10!

Most importantly, he actually unlocked a skill!

Lin Xiu tapped it open.

‘Fury’: active skill, A great increase in strength, speed, and physique for 10 minutes after activation. (Note: After the use of fury, you will be in a state of exhaustion in 5 minutes.)

‘Great increase’ – just how much is the increase? Lin Xiu wasn’t sure, but at this moment, he quickly added these 10 potential points to his speed.

His speed climbed from the original 40 points to 50 points.

Then, before Lin Xiu could take a break, a number of qi energies appeared.

“Pa-pa-pa.” A strong qi charged over and the surrounding trees were destroyed.

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted and he moved in a flash.

Right now, he was glad that he just added 10 points to his speed. Otherwise, he might not be able to dodge this attack!

“Li Hong!” A man ran over and immediately saw the corpse that was chopped into two.

The scene was gruesome.

“Boss! It’s that chap!” That man looked up and saw Lin Xiu’s figure a short distance away.

Zhang Liang jumped down from the tree nearby. That silver skill of his, ‘Blade of the wind’, actually didn’t hit Lin Xiu, and he couldn’t help but frown.

How could that brat be so fast?

Also, observing from a distance, Lin Xiu was clearly different from that night.

Seeing Li Hong’s body, Zhang Liang had a murderous look in his eyes. He wasn’t going to let this guy live!

“Let’s attack together and kill him!” Zhang Liang’s pupils constricted and he rushed toward Lin Xiu.

Fast! His speed was extremely fast!

The gap in strength between a rank 1 warrior and a rank 2 warrior was too apparent. Lin Xiu held his battle blade and wanted to use it to defend, but Zhang Liang had already used his saber and chopped Lin Xiu’s battle blade into two!

“Silver skill: ‘Violent shadow saber’!” Zhang Liang did not hesitate at all and yelled, directly using his strongest skill.

The chopper in his hand transformed into innumerable shadows – it was impossible to tell which was an illusion and which was real.

Lin Xiu cursed in his heart. The difference in their levels was too big and he couldn’t fight him off at all!

Without hesitation, Lin Xiu directly activated the skill he recently acquired- ‘Fury’!

“Go to hell!” Zhang Liang bellowed.

At the same time, Lin Xiu felt a surge of strength in his body, the muscles in his arms bulged and his senses became exceptionally sharp.

He rolled backward and hid.

There were too many shadows of saber, but as long as they didn’t touch him, he would be fine.

At this moment, Lin Xiu fled to the top of a tree at the side and hid.

“Where did he go!?” Zhang Liang’s eyes widened. With Lin Xiu’s speed just now, it was impossible for him to react.

But how, how did Lin Xiu suddenly have an explosive increase in speed that was comparable to the speed of a rank 2 warrior like him?

The other four people looked around, but the trees were lush and the leaves above the trees dense. If one hid inside, they couldn’t see them at all.

Lin Xiu appeared to be holding his breath and at this moment, they had no idea where he went.

“Find him! Be careful.” Zhang Liang’s face darkened.

Never mind that he got fooled once by a beginner warrior, he didn’t expect to actually be fooled again!

Lin Xiu was still on top of the tree, holding his breath.

The effect of Fury was simply a surprise to Lin Xiu, he felt that his attributes in every aspect had almost doubled.

His strength was already at the level of a rank 1 warrior!

But it was still a little challenging to kill four rank 1 warriors and a rank 2 warrior.

There was only one way to kill them!

Looking over from the tree, he immediately saw that among those four rank 1 warriors, there was one who used a spear!

“Split up!” Zhang Liang’s eyes were sinister. He knew that Lin Xiu must be hiding on top of the trees around here and once there was a single movement, Zhang Liang would sense it instantly!

Hearing what Zhang Liang said, they split up and carefully headed in five different directions.

Great!

The man holding the long spear was walking in Lin Xiu’s direction!

Through the gaps in the leaves, Lin Xiu used force on his body and charged down directly!

Over there! Zhang Liang spun around in that direction when he heard this noise.

“Bang!” Lin Xiu took this chance before the rank 1 warrior had time to react and jumped onto this man. He locked his legs around the man’s neck, then forcefully pushed him to the ground.

“Crack.” Lin Xiu used force again and the man’s neck broke at a 90 degrees angle.

That man’s eyes widened and he looked as though he died with a grudge.

Without hesitation, Lin Xiu immediately took the long spear from the man.

This was a silver spear and he wasn’t sure what metal it was made of. The tip of the spear was extremely sharp and even emitted a cold glint.

Although he had never used a spear before, the spear techniques appeared in his head instantaneously. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

That’s right, the skill card that Lin Xiu had used previously- ‘Awe of the phoenix’!

“Bastard! Go to hell!” A warrior was enraged when he saw that Lin Xiu was successful in his sneak attack. He gripped his battle blade tightly and charged at Lin Xiu!
