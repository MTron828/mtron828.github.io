Chapter 581: ‘Thousand Thunder’!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Roar–

And at this time, there seemed to be something roaring from the bottom of the water and the water shook.

Lin Xiu looked to the back and he clearly saw a huge black figure rushing towards him!

What’s this!?

Because the surroundings were dark and dim and the speed of this thing was very fast, Lin Xiu couldn’t see what this thing was for a while.

However, Lin Xiu has the Analytic Eye, so he didn’t need to see the figure of this thing clearly, the system could directly analyze it:

Rank 8 evolved beast, the mutant mad shark.

Features: Bloodthirsty, once it smells blood, it will be greatly stimulated, enter a violent state and its strength would increase by 150%.

Rank 8 evolved beast! Lin Xiu couldn’t help but be surprised at this time.

This 90th floor, as expected, was completely different from the previous levels, not only the underwater environment but also the existence of rank 8 evolved beasts!

Even if a rank 8 warrior came here, he might still be bitten to death by this mutant mad shark.

After all, humans were creatures that live on land. In the water, no matter how good their underwater habits were, they would face the problem of hypoxia in a short time.

There was another serious problem, that is, his strength underwater was affected by the water resistance and would be weakened. It could be said that there was no advantage at all.

But for Lin Xiu, none of this was a problem!

The blood on the Dark Edge spear spread in the water, which stimulated the mutant mad shark.

It rushed in front of Lin Xiu in an instant and its bloody mouth could be seen, as well as the upper and lower rows of sharp teeth.

Boom–

In the next moment, the body of ‘Lin Xiu’ directly bit the mutant mad shark into his stomach.

‘Mirror Image’.

At the critical moment just now, Lin Xiu directly used the mirror image skill and the main body appeared directly in another part of the water and what the mutant shark bit was Lin Xiu’s illusion.

This damn thing was really fast...

Lin Xiu was in a tight spot. Who would have thought that this floor would be like this and the 89th floor required evolved beasts to be killed, so the weapon would definitely be bloody. From this to the 90th floor, as soon as the blood was distributed, the mutant mad shark immediately became crazy.

The person who set up this level was really perverted...

Lin Xiu, who was now accustomed to the dim environment at the bottom of the water, could clearly see some white skeletons underneath.

Is it the student who died after breaking into this floor?

Before Lin Xiu had time to think about it, the mutant shark seemed to realize that it was being deceived. At this moment, it turned around abruptly, its eyes glowing dark red and it frantically charged towards Lin Xiu!

Hng!

Lin Xiu’s thoughts moved and the ‘Sphere’ unfolded instantly, covering his body.

As soon as the mutant mad shark rushed to Lin Xiu’s side, it opened its bloody mouth and was about to bite off Lin Xiu’s body.

The expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes did not change, he held the Dark Edge spear in both hands and stabbed it directly at the side of its mouth!

Boom–

The spear stabbed at its sharp upper teeth and made a loud noise.

Lin Xiu stabbed a hole through!

Some fragments of teeth fell instantly.

The mutant mad shark instantly became even crazier, desperately trying to bite Lin Xiu’s body.

But Lin Xiu’s body was like a fish in the water and he quickly dodged its attack.

Crackling-

And at this time, lightning burst out from Lin Xiu’s body.

The water was a conductor for electricity.

As the lightning burst out from Lin Xiu’s body, the area covered by the lightning also instantly expanded in the water.

The mutant shark was also obviously affected by Lin Xiu’s lightning and its movements seemed to be a little slower now.

‘Thousand Thunder’!!!

Lin Xiu floated in the water, then pointed the Dark Edge spear in his right hand upwards.

Originally, there was a large amount of lightning surrounding Lin Xiu’s body. In the next moment, the lightning became even more terrifying.

It was as if a huge ball of lightning surrounded Lin Xiu’s body.

And at the next moment, a large amount of lightning turned into white laser-like shots and madly shot out in all directions!

As soon as the mutant mad shark rushed towards Lin Xiu, it was attacked by a large amount of lightning. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

Bang bang bang-

The mutant mad shark was instantly struck by lightning that turned white and terrifying and it kept retreating.

And the body was convulsing as if it was in pain.

Lin Xiu went to the Valley of Thunder to train his body previously, another part of the reason was to practice this skill.

At the beginning, the power was not very strong, but because he absorbed the energy of the Thunder Lotus Fire, now using this thunder-type skill, it seemed that the power has also increased exponentially.

Go to hell!

Lin Xiu looked at the mutant shark coming towards him that had been attacked by those lightnings and had a lot of tiny wounds all over its body. Its body was paralyzed because of the lightning. Lin Xiu’s legs exerted force and his whole body was like an arrow as he rushed towards the body of this mutant mad shark!

The long spear was aimed at the head of this mutant mad shark and it would directly penetrate its huge head!

But just as Lin Xiu was about to get close to it, the mutant shark seemed to wake up in an instant, its body turned and rushed towards Lin Xiu and swallowed him directly.

“This guy has already reached the 90th floor...”

The people below looked shocked when they saw the level Lin Xiu was challenging on the screen.

This was really terrifying.

“The 90th floor to 99th floor are called the ten levels of hell. To be able to cross over and climb to the top was equivalent to jumping over a dragon’s gate.” A man said with a smile.

“It’s already really good that he can reach the 90th floor.”

“But there were more than a dozen people who could go up to the 90th floor this year alone.”

“But on the 90th floor, do you know how many people survived?” The man glanced at the people around him, then said lightly.

“How many?”

When the surrounding warriors heard his words, they immediately became interested and they all looked at him and asked.

Seeing that the eyes of the people around him were all focused on him, the man had a satisfied look on his face.

“Three people, the survival rate is only about 20%.”
