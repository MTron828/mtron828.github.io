Chapter 681 Feast at Hongmen?

Soon, with his research, Lin Xiu had a handful of information about the Marqi Planet.

It turns out that this planet was actually built by humans from earth centuries ago!

From the planet’s history, those who moved to the Marqi planet thought that the people on earth were low grade peasants while they were outstanding superior beings.

“Hmmmmm.”

Lin Xiu snorted when he was looking through the information that he found.

Centuries ago, they were still at war. It may be that some of the smarter inventors had designed the spaceship allowing these people to leave earth and move to Marqi planet.

They were refugees of the war. How was it that they suddenly thought of the people back on earth as lower beings? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

As he continued reading, Lin Xiu got even more shocked.

On this planet, it was a monarchy based system. Not only was the king the strongest man, he was also the most powerful.

With the king leading the country, every city was controlled by a City Lord. All of them had been assigned with great power.

The cities of the Marqi planet were far from one another. It would take days to travel from one city to another.

Plus, there were lots of terrifying, dangerous places in this place. There were also ample empty spaces on this planet which was why there were lots of evolved beasts.

The evolved beats here were different from the ones back on earth; they were much scarier.

“Eh? They have a warrior contest here as well?”

Lin Xiu looked at the headlines of one of the newspapers and it was about the warrior competition on Marqi Planet.

The auditions are happening now, just like the ones in Sky City. They would only be granted permission to enter the next city once they win the matches. After several matches, only 24 warriors would be able to participate in the finals that would be held in Fengyun City.

Plus, those who participate would get the chance of being tittled by the king.

Along with the matches that were going on, there was a strict barrier placed outside of Fengyun City. It would be difficult for anyone to enter the city. “Sounds like trouble…”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frown when he read about it.

There was only one train to the Ice and Snow City. If Liu Yanran couldn’t get the tickets…

Lin Xiu felt his head hurting as he thought about it.

Time passed and Lin Xiu spent his afternoon reading the information that he could find.

With the immense amount of things to read, Lin Xiu finally had more understanding of the planet that he was on.

“It’s already dark outside?”

Lin Xiu looked at the window and noticed that the sky had already turned dark.

That’s when Lin Xiu saw Liu Yanran walking from the other direction, looking disturbed.

Just when Liu Yanran was about to reach the door, Lin Xiu immediately jumped out of the window to meet her.

“Hey, what’s the matter?”

Lin Xiu saw the disappointed look on her face and asked immediately.

Liu Yanran was shocked by how Lin Xiu had suddenly appeared but soon came back to her senses.

“Saviour, I’m so sorry.”

She said in a troubled tone.

“I couldn’t get the tickets to the Ice and Snow City…”

“Why is that?”

Lin Xiu asked as he raised his eyebrows. “They have already distributed the tickets…” Liu Yanran bit her lips and looked guilty. “It’s alright.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“I’ve figured out another way.”

When he read about the Marqi Planet, Lin Xiu already knew that there wasn’t much hope for Liu Yanran to get those tickets.

This was because this train to the Ice and Snow City was used to send certain ‘VIP’s.

Liu Yanran’s family might be powerful but Liu Yanran herself was nothing in her own family.

It was obvious from what had happened earlier today.

“What are you going to do?”

Liu Yanran was shocked and she couldn’t help but ask.

“I am going to participate in the Warriors Competition.”

Lin Xiu replied calmly.

“But, without the identity card from the Marqi Planet, you wouldn’t be ble to participate in it.”

Liu Yanran said subconsciously.

“Well, it shouldn’t be a problem for you. Am I right?” Lin Xiu put on a sweet smile.

Liu Yanran paused for a minute before nodding her head.

“I can do that.”

It was true that it would be easy for her to forge a fake identity card for Lin Xiu.

“By the way, my parents have learnt of the news of how you saved me and have invited you over for dinner.”

Liu Yanran suddenly thought of something and told Lin Xiu.

“The feast Hongmen?”

Lin Xiu chuckled when he asked.

“What’s a Hongmen Feast?”

Liu Yanwan obviously wouldn’t know what it meant.

“Ummm back on planet earth, it means a very scrumptious feast.”

Lin Xiu explained.

“Oh! Well it is a feast at Hongmen indeed.” Liu Yanran nodded her head.

With Liu Yanran leading the way, Lin Xiu walked with her to the other side of the place.

The architecture here was very different from the ones back where they were at.

The style on this part of the building seemed much more ancient.

As he took a closer look, he noticed that they had a very strong security system. There were groups of warriors with laser guns walking around, securing the area.

When they saw Lin Xiu, who was holding onto a spear, they acted cautious.

But as soon as they noticed Liu Yanran, all of them moved back.

“Here we are.”

After a short walk, Liu Yanran pointed at a house before them.

It was a huge building. The exterior design of the house looked a little like buildings from the ancient Tang Dynasty. However, there were lots of modern machines and equipment inside the building.

In conclusion, it was a little bit of everything, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but shook his head.

Well, the taste of those living on the Marqi planet isn’t as good as he thought they were.

“Mum, Dad. He’s here.”

As Liu Yanran walked into the room, she introduced Lin Xiu with joy.

“Greetings, Mr and Mrs Liu.’

As Lin Xiu walked into the room, he saw a couple in their fifties and greeted them.

“Lin Xiu? Don’t be shy. Sit.”

Liu Yanran’s parents seemed friendly.

She must have told her parents his name.

Liu Yanran’s parents showed a seat and had Lin Xiu sit on the chair that was at the center of the table.

There was a feast that had been laid out on the table.

He had no idea what these dishes were and there were even some where he couldn’t even recognise the type of meat that was used.

Although Lin Xiu had no idea what they were, they smelled great and it caused him to salivate.

“Lin Xiu, thank you so much for saving our daughter today. Let’s cheers to that!” Father Liu picked up a bottle of wine and poured a glass for Lin Xiu and himself.

“It’s no big deal.”
