Chapter 992: Giant Mechanical Worm

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Just when he was about to step in, a huge roar suddenly came out!

The pupils in Deng Men’s eyes shrank suddenly and his body wanted to retreat, but it was too late now!

A huge head suddenly emerged from this passage.

That bloody mouth bit into Deng Men’s body!

Although Deng Men reacted quickly and wanted to dodge, the entire left arm was directly bitten off by the huge head!

!!

In an instant, blood spurted out in the air.

“Ah!”

Deng Men let out a wailing scream, but at this critical moment, he quickly unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

The figure of the monster was also revealed at this time.

This was a huge worm!

The body looked like a worm that has been magnified countless times.

Its head was very huge and in its open mouth, one could see its countless slender white teeth.

Deng Men’s arm, under the bite of its slender and long teeth, instantly turned into minced meat.

And at this time, the huge worm, with its mouth wide open, continued to bite Deng Men. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Although Deng Men unfolded the ‘Sphere’, the worm ignored it and seemed to want to bite off his ‘Sphere’ together!

Deng Men gritted his teeth and looked at this scene with a look of horror.

Because of his broken arm, there was still blood flowing out.

At this time, because of his fear of death, the ‘Sphere’ that he unfolded began to gradually become unstable.

If it continues like this, it is very likely that his ‘Sphere’ will be directly bitten off by this terrifying worm!

“Go!”

The three Gao brothers, holding the weapons in their hands, attacked the huge worm directly!

Lin Xiu looked at the huge worm and directly activated the Analytic eye.

Under the inspection of the Analytic eye, the information of the huge worm also appeared instantly:

Name: Mechanical Giant Worm

Level: close to the Sage warrior level.

Features: A huge mechanical worm made by artificial intelligence. The outer armor is made of special materials and is extremely hard.

This giant mechanical worm actually possesses power close to the Sage warrior level?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu was surprised.

This thing is capable of destroying a low-level planet!

Dang dang-

At this time, the three Gao brothers rushed over. They directly held the swords in their hands and attacked the body of this giant worm!

The swords slashed on its body, making sounds like a metal collision.

But there is absolutely no way to cut its body!

The giant mechanical worm seemed to sense the attack of Gao Lin and others on him. At this time, it directly spat out Deng Men, who was defending with a ‘Sphere’ and attacked Gao Lin and others directly!

boom–

Deng Men’s body, which had the ‘Sphere’, slammed into the ground behind him heavily, making a loud noise.

pfft—

Although the ‘Sphere’ was unfolding, the powerful impact still caused Deng Men to spit out blood.

“Are you alright?”

At this time, Ji Mei walked over and said aloud.

Although she didn’t like Deng Men, they came together after all.

“It’s no big deal.”

At this time, Deng Men moved with difficulty and said.

As soon as his body moved, the wound on the severed arm was pulled, causing him to grimace in in pain.

Ji Mei’s thoughts were triggered at this moment and a green source mark appeared on her forehead instantly.

At this moment, as the source mark power was revealed, a green light shone on Deng Men’s body.

Deng Men, whose face was full of pain originally, slowly calmed down at this moment.

“thanks…”

Deng Men said to Ji Mei at this time.

Ji Mei shook her head.

At this time, he looked at the three Gao brothers who were fighting the giant mechanical worm, then looked at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was still standing there, looking at the giant mechanical worm, nobody knew what he was thinking.

rumbling rumbling—

At the same time, the giant mechanical worm opened its mouth wide and a lot of energy gathered in its mouth.

Soon, it spewed out what seemed like particle cannons, bombarding the Gao brothers and the others!

The Gao brothers reacted quickly, unfolding their ‘Sphere’ and constantly dodging them.

Those energy rays like particle cannons hit the ground, causing a large number of pits to appear on the entire ground and the surrounding vibrated wildly.

“Damn, what the hell is this…”

At this time, Gao Lin and others also felt the strenuous effort required.

Because no matter how hard they tried, there was no way to break its defense.

The outer layer of this mechanical worm was too hard!

At this time, Lin Xiu’s body’s source strength slowly began to gather.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly as he watched the giant mechanical worm continuously ejecting terrifying energy rays.

At the next moment, his legs moved and a terrifying force erupted, charging directly towards the giant mechanical worm!

swoosh—

Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared instantly!

What a fast speed!

Seeing this scene, Ji Mei’s eyes were full of shock.

In the next moment, Lin Xiu’s figure instantly appeared in the sky.

The fist of his right hand was raised and a large amount of lightning burst out from Lin Xiu’s fist.

‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’

Although this skill was used by Lin Xiu a long time ago.

But after reaching Sage warrior, Lin Xiu became handier in controlling various powers.

Now using this skill, the power that burst out iwas not weak at all.

And Lin Xiu thinks that this move should be very effective against this kind of mechanical evolved beast with a layer of armor!

“Break!”

Following Lin Xiu’s roar, in the next moment, Lin Xiu’s electric punch hit the head of this terrifying giant mechanical worm directly!

‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’ does not destroy from the outside, but from the inside.

Even though the outer armor of this mechanical worm is so thick and hard, the terrifying power generated by Lin Xiu’s punch directly caused huge damage inside this giant mechanical worm.

Boom—

With a loud noise coming out of the mechanical worm’s head, a large amount of electric current also poured into its head instantly.

Because it was originally a mechanical structure, at this time, the electronic components inside were blasted away and this huge mechanical worm fell directly to the ground!
