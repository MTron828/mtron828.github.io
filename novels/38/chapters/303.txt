Chapter 304: Luo Yue’s Friend!?

Whoosh–

At this moment, as the man waved the thin-winged long sword in his hand, there was a sound of it cutting through the air.

There seemed to be a faint cold light on the thin-winged long sword. You could sense the lethal power of it just by looking at it.

Dang dang dang——

Su Xie’s pupils constricted when he saw this scene and with the long sword in his hand, he continued blocking the attacks.

When the long sword collided with the long sword that the man slashed out, there was a sound of metal collision one after another.

Su Xie kept backing away, his eyes were full of surprise.

He didn’t expect that this man would be so strong and he seemed a little overwhelmed.

“Damn!!!” Su Xie yelled suddenly and gripped the long sword in his hand firmly and was about to use his skill!

He was more and more certain that the man before him was extremely strong and he didn’t dare to relax at all.

The source strength in his body has been activated and he wanted to use the power in his whole body to kill the man who made him felt threatened!

“Goodbye.”

When the young man saw this scene, his expression changed abruptly. In the next moment, the thin-winged long sword in his hand stabbed over again!

When it stabbed out, a ray of light burst out from the blade.

Su Xie squinted when the eye-piercing light shone.

Not good!

At this moment, he seemed to feel something and his expression changed drastically. Then, he unfolded a ‘sphere’ for protection.

Swish swish swish——

Just as he squinted, there was a sound of something cutting through the air and cold rays of light appeared one after another in the air.

Su Xie was holding the long sword in his hand and was about to use his skill to kill the man but at this moment, his eyes widened.

His whole body seemed to freeze as he stood still at the same spot.

The ‘sphere’ that he just unfolded disappeared.

“What skill is this!?”

Su Xie’s body seemed to be frozen, but his eyes were still staring at the man.

“Skill to kill.” The man looked at Su Xie and said faintly.

As soon as he spoke, Su Xie’s body instantly gave out a ‘bang bang bang’ sound.

As the sounds rang out, his whole body burst open and was torn apart with blood splashing all over the floor!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, his eyes were filled with shock.

What exactly is going on!?

This is too terrifying, how can the guy be so powerful!?

That Su Xie was a rank 7 warrior and he was killed by him so easily!?

Lin Xiu was still in shock and he instinctively used his Analytic Eye, but the results of the analysis made Lin Xiu even more surprised.

From the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu found out that this guy’s strength was clearly a rank 6 warrior, but he killed Su Xie, a rank 7 warrior so easily.

How did he do it?

Lin Xiu’s eyes were filled with surprise at this moment.

Lin Xiu was shocked and in disbelief when the guy turned around and looked towards Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu saw this guy looking at him and he directly squeezed the weapon tightly, staring at him stubbornly.

Now Lin Xiu felt very threatened.

With the strength of a rank 6 warrior, he killed Su Xie, a rank 7 warrior. This terrifying strength made Lin Xiu feel a lot of pressure.

This guy is too powerful!

Lin Xiu watched him approach slowly and wanted to use the ‘Fury’ skill to fight this guy, the man suddenly smiled and Lin Xiu was taken aback.

What is this guy smiling at?

“Are you Lin Xiu?” Lin Xiu was puzzled when the guy asked.

“How do you know?”

Lin Xiu heard his words and blurted out, he was in shock.

How did this guy know his name?

Lin Xiu was in disbelief. Also, taking a closer look, the guy’s eyes were not filled with the terrifying aura like when he was fighting against Su Xie.

“Hahaha, it really is you.” The man laughed loudly but didn’t explain anything.

Lin Xiu, who initially wanted to use the ‘Fury’ skill to fight this guy, now relaxed slightly.

But he was still very confused.

What is going on with him? How did the man know his name?

“Don’t worry, you and I are not enemies, I know Luo Yue.” The man seemed to see the doubt in Lin Xiu’s eyes and said with a smile at this moment.

‘He knows Luo Yue?’ UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Lin Xiu frowned when he heard his words.

“You can call me Hua Tian.” The man looked at Lin Xiu and said.

‘Hua Tian?’

Lin Xiu frowned slightly, he had never heard of this man’s name.

And looking at the guy, he didn’t look like a student of the Sacred Region Academy, but he wasn’t hostile towards Lin Xiu for sure.

“Are you Luo Yue’s friend?” Lin Xiu asked while looking at him.

He guessed his name so Luo Yue should have told him, right?

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, he was stunned and he laughed, “You can say that.”

“Do you know where she is now?” Lin Xiu stared at him and hurriedly asked.

“No, I don’t know either.” Hua Tian shook his head and said.

“How should I put it, I was together with her before, but something happened later and I was lost.” Hua Tian said regretfully.

He was with Luo Yue previously…

Could it be that Luo Yue came here because of him? Lin Xiu thought about it, then looked at Hua Tian. Huatian was very tall and handsome and he was terrifyingly strong.

With that thought, Lin Xiu didn’t know why but felt a little discomfort in his heart.

The man seemed to notice the change in Lin Xiu’s expression and the corners of his mouth curled up, but Lin Xiu didn’t notice it.

“Let’s go, do you want to find her with me?” Hua Tian stared at Lin Xiu and asked.

Lin Xiu hesitated a little, then nodded.

Then he walked to the back with his spear and carried his backpack.

When he carried the backpack, he looked at Hua Tian who was still standing there, and asked, “Do you know where she is?”
