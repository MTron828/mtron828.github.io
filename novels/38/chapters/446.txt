Chapter 447: ‘Silver Leopard Armor’

After leaving the central building of Sacred Region academy, Lin Xiu returned to the training room.

“Class monitor?” Zhang Yin and the others were all pleasantly surprised when Lin Xiu appeared.

“Are you okay?” Zhang Yin stepped forward, then said to Lin Xiu.

“Yes, class monitor, do you want to rest first…”

The rest of the people also said to Lin Xiu caringly.

“I’m fine.” Lin Xiu was slightly moved when he heard the caring words of his classmates and shook his head.

“Let me tell everyone a piece of good news. The reward this time is 50,000 points per person plus a gold skill card. Each participant of the battle will get an extra 50,000 points.” Lin Xiu glanced at them and said.

“For real!?”

“Great! 50,000 points and a skill card!!!”

At this time, everyone exclaimed and suddenly became extremely excited.

50,000 points were quite a lot and could exchange for a lot of things. If you used it slowly, it would be enough to last for a long time.

This was originally the welfare given to Class 1. It requires a lot of resources in order to groom elites after all.

But even the leaders of the academy did not expect that Class 10 would take first place.

“By the way, have you seen Luo Yue?” Lin Xiu asked Zhang Yin who was next to him.

“No.” Zhang Yin shook his head and said.

“Usually at this hour, she would be practicing in the gravity room inside but I didn’t see her today.”

At this time, Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment, then shook his head and walked over to the gravity room.

“Would you like to come together?” Lin Xiu turned to look at Zhang Yin and others behind him.

“No, no.” When Zhang Yin and others heard Lin Xiu’s words, their heads shook like a rattle. Lin Xiu trained under a state of many times the gravity. They didn’t want to be crushed to death by that strong gravity directly.

After entering the gravity room and closing the door, Lin Xiu did not directly activate the gravity system, but sat cross-legged on the ground and began to enter the system interface in his mind.

At this time, he took a closer look and saw that there were two lottery draws.

Lin Xiu thought for a while and went directly to the lottery draw interface, it was still the same as before, there was not much difference.

And there were no special rewards.

Lin Xiu thought for a while and used the lottery chance. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Soon, as the roulette turned quickly, Lin Xiu heard a crisp sound from the system:

“Ding! Congratulations Master for obtaining ‘a large number of odd crystals’!

“Damn!” Although he knew that the chance of getting good items was very small, these odd crystals were of no use to Lin Xiu now.

With this thought, Lin Xiu could not help but curse inwardly.

“Ding! Congratulations Master on getting the battle suit ‘Silver Leopard Armor’!”

But when the system notification of the second item traveled to Lin Xiu’s ears, Lin Xiu was stunned.

‘Silver Leopard Armor’!?

Before Lin Xiu could react, he saw a bright light flashing in the air. At this moment, a packet of odd crystals appeared in the air, then fell directly onto the ground.

But this was not what Lin Xiu cared about at the moment because when this packet of odd crystals fell on the ground, Lin Xiu could clearly see a battle suit coming down!

“A bit heavy…”

This was a battle suit that looks a bit like chain armor. The suit was silver with a trace of leopard print.

It looked majestic.

“The Analytic Eye is enabled: Leopard print battle suit, superior battle suit, increases strength and speed attributes when worn, ability: intermediate.”

Now after the upgrade of ‘Analytic Eye’, he could not only analyze evolved beasts but battle suits and weapons as well!

Hence, Lin Xiu activated the ‘Analytic Eye’ and discovered this information.

Seeing the information provided by ‘Analytic Eye’, Lin Xiu was pleasantly surprised, then quickly tried to put it on. Lin Xiu felt that his strength seemed to have improved!

“That’s not bad.” Lin Xiu smiled in satisfaction. After all, the previous battle suit was broken and this one was good for Lin Xiu.

Wearing this silver leopard armor, Lin Xiu stood up and walked over to the console.

Then directly activated the gravity system, adjusting the gravity to ten times.

At this moment, Lin Xiu could clearly feel a strong pressure coming from him, his chest was tight and his body was about to fall to the ground.

But soon, as Lin Xiu took a deep breath, the uncomfortable feeling resided.

But his whole body still felt very heavy.

“Phew, it’s not that easy to fully adapt to ten times the gravity.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, then started the “dodge training” in the control system.

As soon as he clicked ‘Confirm’, laser rays shot down from the ceiling instantly.

Lin Xiu’s gaze changed, then his body dodged at an extremely fast speed.

In this state of gravity, the purpose of this training was to strengthen oneself from this laser dodge training.

At the same time, on the other side of the Sacred Region academy, a man was in a pavilion high above a small mountain.

He seemed to feel someone walking up and said faintly, “You’re here?”

“What’s the matter?”

Looking closely, it was Luo Yue who walked up. Luo Yue was still the same as usual, with a cold expression on her face.

When the person standing in the middle of the pavilion turned around, it was Yu Muchen.

“I didn’t expect that the kid would be so strong.” Yu Muchen seemed unafraid to mention what happened that day and looked at Luo Yue.

“No wonder you fancy him.”

“What do you want to say?” Luo Yue fumbled slightly, then said faintly.

“Nothing, do you know why I came here? My father asked me to tell you that at the beginning of next year, we will hold an engagement ceremony for us in Sky City.” Yu Muchen said helplessly.

“Impossible.” When Luo Yue heard Yu Muchen’s words, her face became even colder and she said with a cold snort.

“I know you don’t like me, but it’s not my decision.”

Before Luo Yue could speak, Yu Muchen continued to say, “Don’t worry, I will not force you and I am also very happy to see that you have found someone you like.”
