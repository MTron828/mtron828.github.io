1435 Ready To Roll!

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank uncontrollably when he saw what had happened.

However, he still managed to react quickly and blocked the sword with his spear.

Clang – –

The impact from the long sword was horrifying.

Lin Xiu could feel the pain in both arms.

!!

Then, he quickly moved backwards. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

But, Huangfu Yuanshen was already coming at him.

Xiu – –

He thrusted his long sword into Lin Xiu’s body.

“It’s still the fake one!”

An Tiancheng screamed.

Then, Lin Xiu appeared in the air above them.

All four of them then quickly chased after Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

As they rushed over, all of them released their most powerful warrior skills.

All of them were aimed directly at Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu looked down at the god-level warrior skills that were coming at him and he gathered all of his energy to form his ‘sphere’.

This was because he would not be able to dodge these attacks!

The overpowering warrior skills from all four God Kings landed on Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’ and this caused it to tremble uncontrollably.

It felt as if it was about to break apart!

Damn it! He can’t stand it! There’s no way that he could!

If they rushed toward him now, he would definitely be dead.

He activated ‘Source Strength Control’ once again and absorbed a large amount of energy.

He had no other choice…

As he controlled it with his mind, he activated ‘Sacrifice’!

Burn it!

Lin Xiu sacrificed his vitality!

Then, his vitality started burning passionately.

As they burnt, Lin Xiu’s hair turned from black to white.

His entire body was now covered with a large amount of energy!

An Tiancheng rushed over toward Lin Xiu!

“Die!!!”

Seeing how An Tiancheng was trying to kill him, Lin Xiu’s pupil shrunk uncontrollably.

He then thrusted his spear forward.

Clang – –

The machete in his hands had a hole in the middle as it collided with the Dark Edge!

Then, the tip of the spear pierced through his combat suit and into his chest!

How was this possible?!

An Tiancheng’s eyes were wide and he couldn’t believe what was happening.

How sharp would this spear have to be and how powerful was this brat for this to actually happen?!

But, Lin Xiu still managed to do it all!

Following that, there were large amount of dark energy that surrounded the appear.

These dark energies penetrated into his body.

Lin Xiu pulled out his spear and wanted to continue to slice his head off when Hetian God King suddenly appeared.

He had a huge sword in his hand and attacked Lin Xiu with it!

Ling Tianxi and Huangfu Yuanshen then attacked Lin Xiu from behind.

Lin Xiu’s complexion changed. He no longer had the chance to continue attacking An Tiancheng and could only start defending himself from the attacks of the other three God Kings.

Clang clang clang – –

The spear was moving quickly under Lin Xiu’s control.

None of the God Kings were able to cause any damage to Lin Xiu.

They seem to be suppressed as well.

F*ck!

Hetian God King had a horrible look on his face.

He never expected Lin Xiu to be so powerful.

He could actually fight four God King’s together!

“That person’s energy is still in him! Get it!”

Huangfu Yuanshen had a hideous look on his face as he screamed.

That person?

Lin Xiu frowned, not knowing what this man was referring to.

He was getting all of his energy from his vitality and he had to make every second count.

“Damn it!”

Although An Tiancheng had been pierced in the chest …

He was a God King after all and it would be that easy to kill him.

He covered his chest that was bleeding and suddenly noticed Luo Yue who was inside the array.

Since he wouldn’t be able to kill Lin Xiu, he would then kill the person that mattered to him most!

However, as he thought of getting closer to Luo Yue, he suddenly noticed that there was dark energy all around his body!

What was happening?!

Upon seeing this, all of them looked surprised.

“Damn it!”

Lin Xiu along with the God King’s looked at An Tiancheng who was on the ground and sneered.

[Profound Intent – Silence!]

As Lin Xiu controlled it with his mind, all of the dark energy spread across An Tiancheng’s body!

His entire face started turning black.

“An Tiancheng?!”

Huangfu Yuanshen noticed that something was off. As he looked to the ground, he could clearly see that An Tiancheng’s body had turned black!

Boom – –

Then, there was another loud sound that followed and An Tiancheng’s body suddenly turned into a million particles that disappeared into thin air!

What was that?!

Ling Tianxi and the rest were stunned.

That’s horrifying! How did a God King just die so easily?!

“Damn it!”

Huangfu Yuansheng then had a horrible look on his face.

He quickly moved backwards and took out a peculiar looking stone.

Xiu – –

As he threw the stone into the air, the stone exploded and there was a large surge of energy released.

It spreaded in all directions.

“You’re dead!”

Huangfu Yuanshen looked hideous at this point.

He had already sent the message to the other God Kings.

As he released the transportation stone, the other God Kings would soon arrive!

Lin Xiu knew what Huangfu Yuansheng had in mind and his pupil shrunk uncontrollably.

“Move!”

He released a huge surge of energy from his spear and caused Ling Tianxi and Hetian God King to be pushed aside.

Then, he rushed over to Luo Yue.

Xiu – –

Lin Xiu was moving very quickly as he rushed to the ground.

“He’s trying to run!”

Ling Tianxi’s face turned cold. Just as she wanted to get closer, there were countless arrays that appeared before them!

He subconsciously moved backwards.

All of these arrays turned into a huge wall and stopped them outside the array.

“Luo Yue, let’s go!”

Lin Xiu caught Luo Yue and that’s when the Spatial Cube appeared before him!

Boom – –

Then, there was a loud explosion heard all around them!
