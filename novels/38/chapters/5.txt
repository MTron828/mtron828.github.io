Chapter 6: Boss Zombie

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

2 Potential Points?

Lin Xiu felt elated. He initially thought he would only receive 1 potential point for every level. Who would have thought that he would gain 2 potential points after leveling up!

If that was the case, would he get 3 potential points at level 3?

Lin Xiu no longer hesitated and added both points into Strength.

At present, his strength was at 38 points and was considered average for a normal person.

At this point, zombies pounced from another direction and shocked Lin Xiu, who retreated almost immediately.

Zhang Yi snorted and charged forward.

He was a beginner warrior and was much stronger than Lin Xiu. He ran forward and exerted his strength to hack down and quickly dealt with a few zombies.

“Powerful, Zhang Yi.” Ye Qiu rushed forward anxiously and started flattering him.

“Who was the one that did not dare rush up initially?” Yang Tian sneered.

“You…” Zhang Yi pointed at Yang Tian, and his expression became ugly.

Lin Xiu did not bother about them. To him, the most important thing was to hunt and kill zombies to level up.

The few zombies that were snatched by Zhang Yi caused Lin Xiu a heartache.

They were all experience points!

As they continued venturing in, they could see the outline of the city clearly. This caused Lin Xiu to gasp in surprise.

It looked just like a forest a moment ago. The truth was that the trees were too tall and had covered all the structures.

Yang Tian and the others looked around. They were cautious and afraid that something might pop up.

“These zombies again, let me take care of them!” Ye Qiu spotted a few lingering zombies and rejoiced as he rushed forward.

“Let us go too!” Yang Tian spoke up as well.

They were out to temper themselves. When they saw the zombies, they knew they had to take out at least one or two by themselves.

“Roar!” But when Ye Qiu arrived before them, the closest zombie actually charged at him at a fast speed. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It was so sudden that Ye Qiu could not react in time and was actually forced onto the ground!

The zombie opened its bloodied mouth and bit on his body!

“Scram!” Zhang Yi reacted quickly and kicked the zombie on its chest, causing it to flip to the side.

“How can the zombie be so fast!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted as he quickly activated Analytic Eye.

“Level 1 Boss Zombie trait: Extremely fast, sharp claws and teeth, able to summon a level 1 zombie. Overall Combat strength: 580”

What the hell!

A Boss Zombie!

“Yang Tian! Don’t go over!” Lin Xiu immediately warned Yang Tian when he realized that.

“What’s up?” Yang Tian looked at Lin Xiu suspiciously.

“That’s a Boss Zombie, he will be able to summon level 1 zombies over. It’ll be troublesome then.” Lin Xiu replied with a solemn expression.

Although he wanted to kill the zombie and gain experience, his life was more important.

“Rubbish! What Boss grade, we can just kill it!” Zhang Yi was obviously unhappy with Lin Xiu and immediately charged forward with his battle blade.

The Boss Zombie actually knew how to dodge whenever Zhang Yi slashed forward. It dodged continuously and used its sharp fingernails to scratch Zhang Yi on his battle robes and immediately ripped a hole in it.

“Scram!” Zhang Yi held onto his robes and hacked at the Boss Zombie’s arm. With a bang, the arm was chopped off cleanly.

“ROAR!!!” The zombie suddenly unleashed a loud wail that shook the entire forest.

“See that, trash. I, Zhang Yi, can deal with this zombie with ease.”

He turned and spoke to Lin Xiu in disdain.

“Zhang Yi… Behind… you” But right at this time, Ye Qiu retreated while crawling and rolling with all of his might as he spoke up.

Lin Xiu looked in the same direction and got the shock of his life. His Analytic Eye was right, there were zombies rushing at them!

Zhang Yi had just taken a turn when a zombie pounced on him from the back.

More and more zombies appeared, totaling to more than a dozen.

Zhang Yi was at a loss for words. He continued to slash while retreating.

The number of zombies had scared him as well.

“Lin Xiu, why are you running over there!” Lin Xiu saw that the zombie that Zhang Yi cut down was still alive and rushed forward to land another strike.

“Ding! Congratulations, Master has successfully killed a rank 1 zombie, obtaining 200 experience points!” The clear sound came out again.

The icy cold voice sounded pleasant to Lin Xiu’s ears.

But it would still take a while for him to reach level 3. He looked at the progress bar in his mind: 200/500

Three more, just three more!

“Lin Xiu! Let’s go now!” Yang Tian saw the zombies slowly moving towards them and shouted out.

Zhang Yi, who was taken aback previously, had a change in expression. He ran away immediately. If he were to be infected because of the number of zombies, it would be over!

Although he was considered strong in the class, he was extremely afraid of death.

“Zhang Yi, wait for me!” Ye Qiu was so scared that he peed in his pants while escaping with Zhang Yi.

The blood in Lin Xiu’s body started to boil when he saw the zombies surrounding them.

He was still not strong enough. As long as he could kill the zombies, leveling up multiple times was possible!

Aside from the Boss Zombie, the other level 1 zombies were slow. He felt that it was possible, and the Boss Zombie was currently standing in place and holding onto its broken arm, as though it was trying to reattach it back.

‘A chance! As the saying goes, ‘Riches and honor in the depths of danger’, I’ll risk it!’

He held onto his battle blade and slashed onto a zombie that approached from the side!

“Bang!” The zombie had its head sliced off immediately, as blood sprayed all over the ground.

It was his first time killing zombies today and Lin Xiu started to feel disgusted and nauseated.

“Lin Xiu…” Seeing how he continued to kill the zombies, Yang Tian thought for a moment before taking his battle blade and joining Lin Xiu to deal with the zombies.

The zombies had slow reaction speed. Under Lin Xiu’s constant hacking, he killed countless zombies.

The notification of him gaining experience points appeared incessantly.

“Must we risk so much for this…” Yang Tian looked at Lin Xiu who was fanatically hacking down at the battle blades and felt a shiver down his spine as he muttered to himself.

“Roar!” By this time, the Boss Zombie had somehow reattached his broken arm to the main body. It noticed Lin Xiu’s massacring its zombie horde and immediately rushed forward!
