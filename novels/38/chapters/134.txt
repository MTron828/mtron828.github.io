Chapter 135: Meeting Luo Yue again!

Lin Xiu said in surprise.

She was in a white combat dress, and her long sword was still the same one.

She seemed to have seen Lin Xiu’s at this moment as well and the eyes on her exquisite face also revealed a look of surprise.

Luo Yue!

He didn’t expect to see this proud young lady again here.

But just when Lin Xiu’s long spear had stopped attacking, Luo Yue took the opportunity to stab Lin Xiu with her long sword.

“What’s with you!” Lin Xiu was startled by her sudden movements and exclaimed.

However, Luo Yue did not stop, but her strength seemed to be getting weaker and weaker. In the end, with just a slight force, Lin Xiu blocked the long sword in her hand.

And at this point, she was tottering and unsteady.

When Lin Xiu noticed this, he put his arm around her waist and said, “Are you all right?”

“Let me go!” Luo Yue stared at Lin Xiu, trying to break free, but her body seemed to be very weak.

Lin Xiu, who was holding her, felt something cold on his hands and he was taken aback.

It seems like… blood?

Lin Xiu knitted his brows, then helped her sit on the ground.

“I’m your savior, after all, this isn’t very nice, is it?” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but tease her when he saw her.

“No, I’m going to kill you, so no one’s going to affect me.” Luo Yue shook her head and said.

“Wait, you said I’d affected you? Don’t tell me that you’ve fallen for me?” Lin Xiu touched the fringe on his forehead and said coquettishly.

“Shameless.” Luo Yue, who was impervious to desires and passions, saw how lowly Lin Xiu was acting and couldn’t help but blush a little, then gritted her teeth and said. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

But she seemed to have suffered a lot of injuries and her brows knitted as she spoke.

“I have medicine here, do you want it?” Lin Xiu took a small bottle out of his backpack and said.

Luo Yue looked at him coldly and did not speak.

“I’ll just take your silence as a ‘yes’ ah.” Lin Xiu then pressed her on the ground directly.

“Let me go!!!” Luo Yue was struggling, but now she was out of fighting power because of the injuries and physical exertion.

“The more you want me to let go, the more I won’t – how about that?” Lin Xiu said playfully.

He hasn’t seen anyone at all for a long time and when he met this chick he hasn’t seen for a long time, Lin Xiu was quite surprised.

Lin Xiu found it quite fun to tease this ice-cold chick.

At this moment, Luo Yue’s tightened her fist and didn’t struggle anymore, then said helplessly, “I will kill you!” ”

“Sure sure sure.” Lin Xiu ignored her which made Luo Yue felt like nothing she did had an effect on him, she was simply punching cotton.

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked at the center of her back. It seemed like even this combat dress had torn as if she had been stabbed by a sharp blade.

Blood permeated through the tear.

Lin Xiu hesitated a little at this time, then tore the combat dress slightly and saw her bleeding wound.

“Put up with it,” Lin Xiu said, then took out the small bottle of light blue liquid and applied it directly to her wound.

Luo Yue felt a sharp pain, it was so painful that her brows knitted.

But she did not show make a sound which surprised Lin Xiu.

This restoration fluid was very powerful; it stimulates cell regeneration and could heal the wound in a short period of time, but there were some side effects – when used, the injured person would feel severe pain.

It was ten times stronger than the pain of pouring alcohol directly onto the wound.

“Who the hell did you fight with?” Lin Xiu asked.

But Luo Yue was still silent.

Lin Xiu waved helplessly, then held her body up, leaning against the trunk of a huge tree next to them.

Looking at her cold eyes staring straight at him, Lin Xiu waved and said, “Yes yes yes, I know you are going to kill me.”

“You…” Luo Yue’s eyes widened at this moment, then she took a deep breath and calmed herself down.

“What are you doing here?” After a moment’s silence, Luo Yue suddenly said.

“Give it a guess?” Lin Xiu said.

Under the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu knew that this girl was a rank 4 warrior and her combat strength was more than 4,000!

Luo Yue turned her head and simply ignored Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu curled his mouth and thought that this girl was really boring.

“Actually, I’m here to go to the Sacred region academy.” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue who had her head turned to the other side.

She didn’t seem to care but when she heard the words ‘Sacred region academy’, her gaze changed slightly.

She was stunned when she recalled Lin Xiu asking her where they could meet again and she told him the ‘Sacred region’.

There was a subtle joy on her face that nobody could see.

“I didn’t come because of you.” Lin Xiu felt the need to make things clear, otherwise, she would think that he came over just to find her.

Luo Yue’s eyes suddenly turned cold and she looked at Lin Xiu but did not say anything.

“What do you mean by that?” Lin Xiu was hurt. This person was so beautiful but why was her personality so unappealing?

What an arrogant girl.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu froze all of a sudden like he heard some sounds coming from a distance.

At this moment, he tensed up and laid on the ground without hesitation, then placed his ears on the ground.

With his powerful hearing and perception, Lin Xiu was sure that there was a group of people coming towards them and they were strong!

“They’re coming for me.” Luo Yue seemed to know something and knitted her brows, then she said.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu did not ask her why and hesitated before speaking.

Even a rank 4 warrior like her got so injured, it was clear how strong those people were.

Coupled with the number of people they had, Lin Xiu wasn’t confident that he could defeat them.

There was no way out except to escape and hide!
