Chapter 1042: Your Fire Is Like A Child’s Play

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

What’s that sound?

Sage warriors tend to have very good hearing.

When they heard the sound, all of them turned towards the direction from where the sound was coming from.

They looked at the huge green dumpling that was made out of vines and it was shaking on its own.

When the warriors noticed it, they couldn’t help but frown.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

The pointy rocks that had penetrated the huge dumpling were all coming out!

When the warriors saw what was happening, all of them started walking backwards subconsciously.

Boom boom – –

The pointy rocks then came out from its original place and landed on the ground with loud noises.

“That kid…”

The fire element sage warrior had his eyes wide opened in shock as he looked at the green dumpling that was shaking on the ground.

Soon, all of the green vines were wilting at an extremely quick speed.

In the end, all of them turned into dried vines.

Boom – –

When the vines turned brown and dry, there was a huge explosion and the entire thing exploded.

Lin Xiu’s body once again appeared in the air.

“He’s not dead…”

When the warriors saw what happened, the look on their faces changed.

Lin Xiu’s body was floating mid air as he stared at the warriors on the ground. His eyes were filled with a murderous intention.

The vines were made of something peculiar instead of actual vines. This was why when Lin Xiu was completely covered by it, he was still able to suck the energy out of it by using ‘rage’.

The warriors were powerful when they worked together and it would be impossible for Lin Xiu to kill them together.

Now, he could only kill them one by one.

With that in mind, Lin Xiu gathered his thoughts and activated ‘Skill Enhancement’.

All of the warrior skills that he was about to use after this would be the level of a sage warrior.

With his eyes locked onto the gold element warrior, Lin Xiu moved and he disappeared once again.

‘Flashing Souls’!

He’s missing again?!

The warriors, who were standing on the ground, were still in shock as they watched what was happening to Lin Xiu.

Before they knew what was going on, Lin Xiu appeared right behind the gold element warrior!

Although Lin Xiu had no idea what this warrior could actually do, Lin Xiu had a feeling deep inside that this warrior would threaten him most.

Therefore, while his powers are in full bloom now, he decided to get rid of him first!

Lin Xiu immediately held onto his long spear as he stood next to the gold element warrior.

The gold element warriors could feel that there was someone behind him as well. When he turned around, he only saw the tip of the long spear that was coming at him.

‘Holy level – Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City!”

With that, the entire spear looked as if it had been melted into tiny dark particles.

These black particles then came together and became a huge dragon. It was so big that it looked as if it could cover the entire sky.

The huge dragon opened its mouth wide and roared.

“AHHHHH!!!!!”

The golden element warrior screamed in fear. He could not run from it and had to release his ‘sphere’.

Boom – –

Then, the black dragon immediately went for his ‘sphere’!

There was a loud explosion that followed and the entire ‘sphere’ was destroyed because of the black dragon.

This was his chance!

Seeing how the ‘sphere’ had disappeared, Lin Xiu’s body then flashed before his eyes.

With the long spear that was now covered in flames, it was aimed at the gold element warrior’s body!

“Stop!”

The remaining warriors immediately released their warrior skills and attacked Lin Xiu.

They were trying to force Lin Xiu to stop.

But Lin Xiu did not care about the warriors that were coming at him.

In a blink of an eye, his body was covered with a golden glow.

‘Golden Body Immortality’!

With the skills activated in his system, within seconds, Lin Xiu’s body was similar to the golden body of a god.

None of the strong warrior skills from the warriors were able to harm Lin Xiu.

As for the gold element warrior, he had suffered some internal injuries when his ‘sphere’ exploded.

At that moment, he had nowhere to run!

NOOOO!!!!!

Seeing how the long spear was already coming at him, he was screaming in fear deep inside his heart.

But, he still had nowhere to go!

Boom – –

Then, the sharp tip of the long spear pierced through his head!

His head exploded on the spot!

“Ah Jin!!!!!!”

The rest of them couldn’t help but scream in pain as well. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

His head had exploded which meant that he was definitely dead.

The four of them were furious as their eyes turned red and they headed for Lin Xiu almost immediately!

Lin Xiu sneered. He pulled out the long spear that was still inside the man’s head and was prepared for the next fight.

Lin Xiu had discovered that the gold element warrior was the leader amongst this group of warriors.

Clang clang clang – –

The fight continued but Bai Zhangei’s face was slowly turning pale.

This group of men were known as the Five Element Sage Warriors.

They were considered quite famous on this planet.

With the five of them working together, they were a strong group of warriors.

But, Bai Zhanfei didn’t think that Lin Xiu was able to kill one of them and the one that he did was the leader of the group.

With that warrior dead, all of the combined skills of the group would now be useless!

Boom boom boom – –

Then, with Lin Xiu moving his long spear continuously, there were flaming birds that were released into the air.

The four warriors who were busy attacking Lin Xiu were frightened by the flaming birds and tried to avoid them when they saw them coming out of Lin Xiu’s spear.

These flaming birds had a very high temperature and because of them, the air around them was scorched as well.

“Get lost!!!”

The fire element warrior looked at the flaming bird that was coming at him. He roared in rage and there was a red sourcemark that appeared on his forehead.

Then, a huge flaming dragon was released and it started fighting the flaming birds.

The flaming birds were instantly destroyed.

As for the flaming dragon, it turned and went towards Lin Xiu!

“Your fire is like a child’s play.”

Lin Xiu sneered when he saw the dragon.

He then moved the long spear in his arms once again.

This time, there was a large number of flaming birds that were released from it!

However, instead of rushing towards the enemies, they gathered in front of Lin Xiu!
