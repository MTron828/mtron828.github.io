Chapter 377: Is It That Kind Of Relationship Between You And Her?

“What are you going to do with it?”

Lin Xiu passed both the items to Luo Yue and subconsciously asked the question.

“You’ll know when you’re back.”

Luo Yue was acting a little mysterious which was why Lin Xiu got curious.

“Alright then, I’ll head over there first.”

However, Lin Xiu was aware of Luo Yue’s personality and didn’t continue pushing for an answer. Then, he walked towards Nan Zhengjun’s office.

While he was walking by the roadside in the Sacred Region Academy, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but stretch his back.

He finally felt a little relaxed today since he had been exhausted for the past few days.

There were students around him, who were wearing the uniform of the Sacred Region Academy, staring at Lin Xiu as he was still wearing the Fire Scale Combat Suit that was a little torn.

Lin Xiu didn’t care about them and quickly arrived at Nan Zhengjun’s office.

Knock knock – –

The door was closed and Lin Xiu decided to knock on the door before entering.

“Come in.”

As soon as Lin Xiu stepped into the room, he saw Nan Zhengjun who was sitting by the table.

He seemed to be engrossed about something on the computer.

“What’s the matter?” His eyes were still glued onto the monitor, extremely focused on what was happening on the screen. He didn’t even look towards Lin Xiu’s direction.

“Yes. We completed the mission.” Lin Xiu laughed and said out loud.

When Nan Zhengjun realized that it was a familiar voice, he quickly raised his head and finally saw Lin Xiu who was by the door.

“Lin Xiu?!”

When he saw that it was Lin Xiu, Nan Zhengjun let out a surprised look.

“You’re back?”

“Yeah, just got back.” Lin Xiu nodded his head. Then, he got one of the chairs and helped himself to a seat opposite Nan Zhengjun.

Nan Zhengjun took a good look at Lin Xiu and saw the cuts on his combat suit. Looks like Lin Xiu has gone through some hardships while being in the Black Forest.

“Looks like you had quite an experience.” Nan Zhengjun sighed.

It has only been a week since he last met Lin Xiu but he noticed that Lin Xiu was a little different from before.

His face, which was still a little childish a while ago, looked a little more firm now. The aura that he was radiating now was also much stronger than before.

“You can say that.” Lin Xiu nodded his head in agreement. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Although he wasn’t in the Dark Forest for a long time, there were indeed a lot of things that happened to Lin Xiu and he had already lost count of them.

“This Fire Scare Combat Suit, it wasn’t really useful.” Lin Xiu took a look at the combat suit that he was wearing and said with a frown on his face.

“Haha, I’m sure it was useful.” Nan Zhengjun laughed and his fingers continued typing on his keyboard.

“Yi? Looks like someone has already handed in the report for your mission.”

“It might be the second-year student who went with you and the rewards have been divided as well. Should I transfer them to your card now?”

“What are the rewards?” Lin Xue was stunned and immediately thought of how Guo Ling and the rest had returned before him.

Lin Xiu stood up and looked at the screen of the monitor;

Remaining reward withdrawal: [ 150 thousand ]

Remaining reward recipient: Lin Xiu [ ID: 9814126]

“There is a 300 thousand point reward and they gave you 150 thousand…” Nan Zhengjun was shocked.

He knew that there were a lot of them in their team and definitely did not expect them to leave half of their reward to Lin Xiu.

“Withdraw it then.” Lin Xiu was a little shocked but he wasn’t as surprised as the other person.

As he was well aware of how large his contribution was to the team and he didn’t accept the material reward from before as well.

“En.” Nan Zhengjun nodded his head and with his fingers quickly typing on the keyboard, Lin Xiu felt a slight vibration in his pocket.

He subconsciously took out the school card from his pocket and could clearly see the glow on the card. It was showing ‘+100000’ on the card.

He had recently ran out of points and since he now has an additional 100 thousand points, there would be quite a few things that he could do now.

“Okay then, I’m leaving now.” Lin Xiu placed the card back into his pocket and said to Nan Zhengjun.

“Hold up.” Just when Lin Xiu finished his sentence, Nan Zhengjun immediately stopped him.

“What’s wrong?” Lin Xiu was stunned and quickly asked.

“Remember to bring the rest of your classmates out for training tomorrow. Plus, the monthly exam is coming soon. Make sure you do your best.” Nan Zhengjun smiled and told Lin Xiu.

Monthly exam?!

When he heard of those words, Lin Xiu finally remembered that there is an exam every month here in Sacred Region Academy. It would include theoretical knowledge as well as actual combat experience.

These exams would be done with the guidance of their headteacher and would not have to compete with the rest from the other classes.

“No problem.” He didn’t think too much about it and quickly agreed to it.

The monthly exam wasn’t a problem for Lin Xiu. Forget about the actual combat experience, the part that tested them for theoretical knowledge was extremely easy for him.

This was because before Lin Xiu transmigrated here, he already had the knowledge in his head. There was so much of it that even the teachers here wouldn’t have as much as him.

“Oh, by the way, is Luo Yue back as well?” Nan Zhengjun thought of something and asked Lin Xiu.

“En, we came back together.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“I’m guessing, is it that kind of relationship between you and her?” Nan Zhengjun was asking Lin Xiu with a curious look in his eyes, trying to know more gossip.

Upon hearing his question, Lin Xiu almost tripped and asked the other person with a head full of questions, “what kind of relationship?”

“You little brat, don’t try to act innocent with me. You just tricked her into staying with you as soon as you got to Sacred Region Academy.” Nan Zhengjun patted Lin Xiu on his shoulder and laughed out loud.

Seeing Nan Zhengjun who was burning with passion as he started gossiping, Lin Xiu glared at his teacher who wasn’t acting like a respectable teacher and said, “We are staying in separate rooms and we’re just friends.”

Lin Xiu wasn’t lying about this. Although there was a special bond between them, none of them have ever talked about it.

It always felt that there was one last step left.

“Looks like you’re not as good as I thought.” Nan Zhengjun shook his head, showing as if he was disappointed in Lin Xiu.

When Lin Xiu saw the expression on his face, his mouth twitched uncontrollably. The teachers here at Sacred Region Academy are such …..busybodies!

Dididi – –

At that moment, there was a weird sound that came from Nan Zhengjun’s computer.

“Eh?”

Nan Zhengjun was shocked for a moment before clicking on the message that appeared on his screen.
