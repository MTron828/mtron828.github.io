Liu Cheng Arrives

These energy barriers quickly unfolded.

It formed a semicircle covering the entire Lingxian City!

“Success!” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Lei Tong looked at this scene and suddenly said excitedly.

It worked!?

Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling also took a closer look at the huge energy barrier that had been deployed.

Because of the appearance of this energy barrier, the entire sky is now purple.

“let me try…”

With a thought, the Dark Edge spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

“City Lord, feel free to attack!”

Lei Tong looked at Lin Xiu in the sky and shouted loudly.

He was very confident in the energy barrier he built.

“Then I’ll try.”

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, he continued to charge towards the sky above.

“I’m coming too!”

At this time, Baili Haoling also drew out her two swords and flew into the sky.

Holding weapons, the two of them directly attacked the energy barrier with all their strength!

If the energy barrier can’t even withstand the attacks of the two of them, then it’s useless.

At this time, Lin Xiu was already holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand and blasted towards the energy barrier!

boom–

As the spear pierced past, there was a loud noise.

But this energy barrier is still motionless.

It doesn’t seem to be affected in any way.

“Hm?”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu showed surprise in his eyes.

The hardness of this energy barrier was beyond Lin Xiu’s expectations.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly and continued to mobilize all the strength in his body.

With the mobilization of the body’s strength, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand also became full of light due to the transmission of the source strength.

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

With the use of skills, the Dark Edge spear once again turned into hundreds of spears and stabbed out!

Bang bang bang——

At this time, the entire energy barrier continuously burst out with muffled sounds.

But this energy barrier was still motionless.

On the other side, Baili Haoling continued to attack the energy barrier with a pair of swords.

Same as before, this energy barrier has not been broken yet.

“It’s really good…”

Lin Xiu stopped what he was doing at this moment, looking at the energy barrier close, he said.

Even if he used ‘Fury’, there should be no way to break this energy barrier.

One hundred god-level odd crystals became the energy cores and the energy barrier built to this extent really satisfied Lin Xiu.

“Haoling, can’t you break it?”

Lin Xiu turned around and looked at Baili Haoling.

“En.”

Baili Haoling nodded, feeling a little numb in both hands.

Just now she attacked the energy barrier crazily with force, but now it seems that there were no cracks on the energy barrier.

as firm as a rock.

“Now we wait for other warriors to come over and see how the energy barrier holds up…”

Lin Xiu himself was very interested in this energy barrier. When the warriors from other cities attack, he would like to see how this energy barrier holds up.

After all, among the fighters from the three cities he killed last time, besides Shachang City, there were also people from Haiwang City and Chang Qing City.

The people from these two cities haven’t come over yet, but from what it looks like now, they should be sending people over soon.

Boom——

The moment Lin Xiu finished speaking, Lin Xiu felt something appearing behind him.

Turning around abruptly, he saw a huge snowball rushing from behind!

When it hit the energy barrier, there was an extremely loud sound.

...

But the energy barrier was still motionless!

“Speak of the devil?”

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened at this time and his eyes were full of surprise.

“Look over there!”

Baili Haoling, whose body was also suspended in the sky, saw a black spot in front of her and her pupils shrank slightly.

Looking at the direction Baili Haoling was pointing at, Lin Xiu also looked there.

A man riding a huge white tiger was charging over!

The white tiger opened its mouth wide and the sharp claws of both hands directly grabbed the energy barrier!

Boom——

As its claws caught the energy barrier, a loud sound suddenly erupted.

“Damn it, someone is here!?”

...

Lei Tong looked at the scene in the sky below and his eyes widened.

And it seems that this enemy seems to be quite strong…

“However, the energy barrier built by me, Lei Tong, is not so weak…”

Lei Tong clenched his hands tightly.

He has great confidence in the energy barrier he built.

“En!?”

At the same time, Liu Cheng who was outside the energy barrier frowned watching this scene.

This energy barrier, even my own mount can’t directly break through it!?

“continue.”

Liu Cheng said coldly.

The white tiger he was sitting on continued to attack the energy barrier frantically at this moment.

Loud noises sounded continuously, but the energy barrier was still motionless!

“So you want to break through the energy barrier of my Lingxian City?”

Looking at the huge white tiger and Liu Cheng on the white tiger through the energy barrier, Lin Xiu couldn’t help saying.

Although Lin Xiu didn’t know this person, but judging by his actions, he knew that he must be looking for trouble in Lingxian City.

Liu Cheng’s face became gloomy when he heard Lin Xiu’s mocking words.

He pulled his right hand back and immediately pulled out a white frosty giant sword.

“What a strong energy fluctuation…”

After he pulled out the giant sword, Baili Haoling clearly felt something and the look in her eyes changed slightly.

Feeling it carefully, this powerful energy fluctuation was transmitted from this frosty giant sword.

“Lin Xiu, there is something wrong with this man’s giant sword.”

Baili Haoling flew to Lin Xiu’s side, then spoke to Lin Xiu.

“En, I feel it too.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly and said.

The weapon in his hand was comparable to his Dark Edge spear.

It can be said to be a magical weapon.

It’s just that with his sharp weapon, can he break through the energy barrier that Lei Tong built?

“Break it!”

And at this moment, Liu Cheng, who had a cold face, held the frosty giant sword and slashed down toward the energy barrier from top to bottom!

His sword was extremely sharp and had killed countless hard-bodied beast god-level evolved beasts.

He was confident that he could break through this energy barrier directly!

Whoosh—

As his frosty sword swung down, a piercing sound erupted in the air.

Even the space was split open!
