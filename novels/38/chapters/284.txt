Chapter 285: Target: Level 30!

The system prompts kept ringing in his head.

It made Lin Xiu feel very accomplished.

He had already lost count of how many Black Tooth Spiders he killed. He only knew that the experience bar on the stats board in his mind was constantly rising.

This was simply a sacred place for gaining experience!

The weakness of this rank 6 evolved beast was fire, so it took almost no effort to kill them.

Lin Xiu did not stop the movement of his hand at this time and kept using ‘Awe of the Phoenix’ to kill the Black Tooth Spiders that came up.

While Guo Ling and the others were fighting against mutated Black Tooth Spider.

This mutated Black Tooth Spider has fire resistance properties, so using flames did not help.

They could only fight in close combat at this time.

“It should be in front.”

At this moment, on the other side, a man spoke with a gloomy face.

This man was the man who wanted to snatch the Odd crystal of the Giant Black Rock beast that Lin Xiu killed.

Thinking of what happened that night, he ground his teeth in anger.

He was actually tricked by that kid and Scar was killed by him – darn it!

“Boss, I see them, that kid and those people – they look like they’re fighting on the other side!”

At the same time, one of the men stood on a large black tree that looked like an umbrella and looked far away. He suddenly saw Lin Xiu and the others fighting in the distance.

“Very well, this time, we are going to kill them all.” The leader said with a gloomy face at this moment and a sinister smile appeared at the corner of his mouth.

“Let’s go!”

“Damn, why is this thing so hard to kill?” Meanwhile, Qiu Li, who was fighting the mutated Black Tooth Spider felt extremely pressured.

The pale blue skin of this mutated Black Tooth Spider was like a carapace. When his weapon hit against its body, there were ‘dang dang dang’ sounds.

But no matter how hard he tried, there was no way to pierce through the spider.

“Its skin is too hard.” Qian Lin also agreed at this time.

The few people worked very well together. At this moment, they were scattered in all directions and attacked the mutated Black Tooth Spider continuously.

“Find a chance and wait for it to open its mouth.” Guo Ling looked calm and said while attacking its body with a long sword.

Although there was no way to penetrate its carapace-like skin directly, it can still leave deep cracks on its skin.

As long as they hit this crack continuously, they would break through its hard skin sooner or later.

“Open its mouth?” Qiu Li was surprised to hear what Guo Ling said and seemed a little confused.

But as soon as he spoke, the huge iron pincers on the mutated Black Tooth Spider’s mouth continued to bite.

It was constantly opening and closing like a huge pair of scissors.

Qiu Li was not careful and was almost cut into two pieces by the huge iron pincers on its mouth.

“Be careful.” Wan Qianshui held Qiu Li’s back and pulled him back.

“Thank you.” Qiu Li’s face was a little pale. That was simply terrifying; he was almost cut in half by this Black Tooth Spider!

Lin Xiu didn’t pay attention to the battle on their side and continued to use ‘Awe of the Phoenix’ to attack the Black Tooth Spiders that came up.

The speed of these Black Tooth Spiders was very fast, but when they touch Lin Xiu’s flaming birds, it was like a flame touching a gasoline barrel and they were instantly burned.

His experience was constantly increasing and it felt refreshing. This was definitely a good place for leveling up!

After some time, Lin Xiu discovered that his experience had risen to more than two billion!

Lin Xiu gasped when he realized.

More than 2 billion experience points – he did not expect that he could gain experience so quickly!

Now Lin Xiu was even more motivated. As long as these Black Tooth Spiders continue to climb up, he can continue to kill them to gain experience!

With that though, Lin Xiu got a little excited.

It might not be impossible to get to level 30 here!

Hiss hiss hiss–

Behind Lin Xiu, the mutated spider’s mouth opened wide and was about to spit out some silk threads!

“Good chance!”

Guo Ling saw this and was surprised. Then, she reacted very quickly and took out something round from her pocket which looked like a silver ball.

As soon as she pressed a red button on it, the silver ball suddenly began flashing red light.

“Go!”

Guo Ling threw it harshly into the mouth of this mutated Black Tooth Spider! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The mutated Black Tooth Spider that was about to spit out silk threads to attack them swallowed the silver ball in.

“Success!?”

Chen Jin’s eyes lit up when he saw this scene.

He knew what the silver ball was.

It was the latest type of bomb and the explosive power was very powerful.

Although the skin of this mutated spider was extremely hard, once this silver ball exploded inside, it would be dead!

Just as he exclaimed, there was a resounding “boom”.

Roar–

The Black Tooth Spider opened its mouth wide and cried out. From its opened mouth, one could clearly see all the flames bursting out.

This was caused by the explosion of this bomb.

“Great, seems like we killed it… ah!!!”

When Qiu Li stood and said aloud, he saw a cold light flashing by his side and his arm was directly cut off!

Blood sputtered out in an instant!

It was obvious that a person who rushed over suddenly cut off Qiu Li’s left hand with a saber!

And this was not over yet, this person still held the saber in his hand and wanted to cut Qiu Li into two!

Dang–

Just then, a long sword blocked Qiu Li and collided with the saber, giving off a crisp sound.

“It’s you!?” Holding the long sword to help Qiu Li block the attack, Wan Qianshui saw the man’s face.

It was the man who snatched the Black Rock beast’s Odd crystal last night!

“Hng, didn’t expect us to come here?” The man said with a sinister smile.

Just as he spoke, a group of men rushed over!

Wan Qianshui’s expression changed in an instant. He didn’t expect these people to catch up with them at this moment!!!

“Courting death!”
