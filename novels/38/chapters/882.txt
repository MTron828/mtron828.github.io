Chapter 883: Shocked Everyone

?

Boom–

With a loud noise, one could clearly see a man falling under the nine-story tower.

Taking a closer look, he found that the man was Pang Hu.

“Pang...Pang Hu?”

When some warriors saw this scene, their eyes widened.

Because the person who fell from the second floor of the Nine-Story Pagoda is undoubtedly the Pang Hu just now.

Pang Hu’s eyes widened, and there was blood spilling from his mouth.

There are a lot of wounds on the sturdy body as big as a hill.

These wounds are huge, and they look like they have been bitten by some beast.

“What on earth did Pang Hu encounter...”

When some warriors saw this scene, they couldn’t help covering their mouths.

Pang Hu’s expression was full of horror, as if he had encountered something terrifying before he died.

“Holy-level skill cards are hugely attractive to everyone, but I have never heard of anyone who can reach the top.”

“It is said that even a Respected warrior reached the eighth floor once...”

When the surrounding warriors saw this scene, they couldn’t help but sigh.

Some warriors who originally wanted to enter the nine-story tower now feel that there is no hope.

“Did you see it?”

Zhao Xiaoqing said proudly to Lin Xiu at this time.

“This nine-story pagoda was built by our Zhao family ancestors. Those with strength can obtain the holy-level skill cards left by our Zhao family ancestors.”

“But you have also seen that people who are not strong enough will end up like this.”

While talking, Zhao Xiaoqing observed Lin Xiu’s expression.

Originally, she thought that Lin Xiu would be afraid, but what she didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu was still as calm as the wind and the wind, without any fear at all.

Hng! You’ll know how awesome it is later! Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Zhao Xiaoqing thought to herself, when Lin Xiu can’t even open the stone gate, she must laugh at him!

Some warriors around shook their heads at this time, and were about to leave.

At this time, seeing Lin Xiu walking over, a curious look appeared in his eyes.

Because Lin Xiu was really too young, and he was wearing an ordinary long coat. Apart from being very handsome and having a special temperament, he seemed like an ordinary warrior.

He was definitely not as good as Pang Hu.

He might not even be able to open the stone gate.

When these people thought about it, they couldn’t help but sneer at the corners of their mouths.

However, Lin Xiu ignored those people and walked over with the Dark Edge spear on his back.

The first gate of this nine-story pagoda is a huge stone gate.

The statue on the stone gate is like two demons guarding the gate, and they were lifelike.

“I don’t know how many tons this door weighs. It’s easier said than done to push it open.”

When some warriors saw that Lin Xiu seemed to be about to push the door, they couldn’t help showing a sneer.

“I guess he’s here to have fun.”

The rest of the warriors could not help but show a playful smile.

Even Zhao Xiaoqing, who had seen Lin Xiu’s formidable strength, did not believe that Lin Xiu could push the stone door open.

Lin Xiu looked at the stone gate, his eyes narrowed slightly, and all the strength of his body gathered in his hands.

After reaching the level of Respected warrior, Lin Xiu’s strength has become extremely powerful.

The source power is not comparable to that of ordinary warriors.

huh—

After taking a deep breath, Lin Xiu flexed his hands.

They respectively pressed on this stone door.

“Hahaha, I knew this kid can’t push it open.”

“Tsk tsk, let’s go down, don’t waste your time.”

Seeing this scene, these people couldn’t help laughing.

But soon, his smile stopped.

Because at this moment, this stone gate was slowly pushed open!

how is this possible!

Those warriors who were still mocking just now, their eyes widened at this time.

Both eyes were full of disbelief.

Boom—

As Lin Xiu continued to use his hands violently, the two stone doors were completely opened!

Unlike Pang Hu who just opened it halfway, Lin Xiu had completely pushed it open!

“This... is this fake?”

Zhao Xiaoqing originally planned to laugh at Lin Xiu, but when she saw the current scene, her eyes were wide and round.

This stone gate is not an ordinary stone gate, it is made of special materials, and its weight is unimaginable.

So just pushing the stone gate open made many warriors discouraged.

But Lin Xiu pushed it away so easily!

Lin Xiu walked in without any hesitation.

Boom—

As Lin Xiu stepped into the nine-story pagoda, the huge stone gate closed in an instant.

“This is impossible!”

A warrior who was mocking Lin Xiu just now, hurried up at this time, and reached out to push open the stone door.

But no matter how hard he tried, there was no way he could push the stone door.

Everything was true just now!

When the warriors outside were shocked, Lin Xiu had already entered the nine-story pagoda.

The inside of the tower looked very dark, with only the candlelight illuminating the surroundings.

Ka Ka Ka Ka –

At this time, a strange sound suddenly came over.

Um?

Lin Xiu raised his brows. Before he could react, a large number of steel needles shot from the surroundings!

Dangdang-

Lin Xiu’s reaction speed was still very fast. These steel needles all stabbed the ground, and they didn’t stab Lin Xiu’s body at all.

“A steel needle with source strength?”

He took a closer look at the steel needles stuck on the ground. There was a blue translucent source strength on the steel needles.

Under the wrapping of this terrifying source strength, the power of this steel needle is enough to easily pierce the body of a warrior of the King warrior level.

Just now, Lin Xiu glanced at Pang Hu’s body. It was obvious that his body also had a wound that was penetrated by a steel needle.

This person must have been injured by a steel needle on the first floor, and then killed by something on the second floor.

“Interesting.”

Lin Xiu not only didn’t feel scared, but got a little excited.

After all, after advancing to the level of Respected warrior, there are fewer and fewer warriors who were worthy of being his opponents.

And this kind of fun is rarely encountered.

“This guy, he wouldn’t be able to get that holy-level skill card right...”

Seeing that Lin Xiu still hadn’t come out, Zhao Xiaoqing couldn’t help but say out loud to himself.

There are ‘cleaners’ in this nine-story tower, and the bodies of warriors who die will be tossed out directly.

Just like Pang Hu just now.

Lin Xiu hadn’t come out yet, which meant that he was still in the tower and not dead.

Walking on the wooden stairs on the second floor, Lin Xiu could feel the cool aura coming from above.

What was it that was upstairs that caused Pang Hu to be directly killed?
