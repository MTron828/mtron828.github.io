Chapter 269: Ice Lotus Fire

Just after Lin Xiu spoke.

His body moved suddenly and he rushed directly to the man in front of him!

The man was shocked when he saw that Lin Xiu’s hands were still bursting with flames at this time.

He could sense that the flames released by Lin Xiu’s fists were even more terrifying than his own ‘Fiery Fist’.

But now he has no retreat. If he wanted to escape now, he would most likely be hit by Lin Xiu!

“‘Fiery Fist’!!!”

And he couldn’t believe that someone’s fists were actually stronger than his own.

After all, his ‘Fiery Fist’ was close to the power of a diamond skill and he had practiced it for a long time.

Following his roar, his right fist was instantly covered in flames.

Compared with the flames on Lin Xiu’s fist, his flames looked ordinary, but it was still very hot.

The surrounding air seemed to be distorted because of his flames.

“Go to hell!”

Watching Lin Xiu’s flame-covered fist coming towards him, the man punched out with his flame-covered fist!

Bang–

The two fists slammed against each other and a loud noise resounded.

The flames on the two fists appeared to have a special reaction because of the collision.

After a while, the man felt a sharp pain.

Click, click——

There were clicking sounds from his bones like they were about to crack into pieces.

“Ah!!!”

Just as he was about to move, he felt the flame on Lin Xiu’s fist wrapping around his fist.

The flame on his fist had already been swallowed by those flames of Lin Xiu as it burned directly in his hand.

Within a second, his fist turned charred black.

Lin Xiu didn’t give him any chance to dodge and escape, he swung his other fist and punched his abdomen.

Boom–

There was a dull sound and the man was sent flying, then his entire body hit the wall behind.

His eyes were wide open as his whole body slowly fell to the ground and he stopped breathing. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Ding!”

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 5 warrior and gaining 12 million experience!”

12 million experience… he still needed around 20 million experience to level up.

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed as he looked at the man who fell on the ground and was still twitching because of his ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’ attack.

He revealed a ferocious glint.

If it wasn’t for his own strength and tyranny, he would have been the one dead.

Lin Xiu was not a saint. At this moment, his eyes were cold, his fist was covered in lightning andhe threw a punch on the man’s body!

Boom——

With the punch that killed him, in the next moment, a system prompt resounded again.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master on killing rank 5 warrior and gaining 12 million experience!”

After Lin Xiu dealt with all these people, Lin Xiu checked and saw that he was still a few million experience points away from leveling up again.

He shook his head. Lin Xiu didn’t think much and left the place.

Lin Xiu only walked a short distance when a black figure stepped out and glanced at the corpse on the ground. At this moment, a strange smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

“Seems like this person is pretty strong, I doubt a head-on confrontation would kill him, it’s better to wait for a good opportunity before making a move…”

He said to himself and soon, his figure was hidden in the dark night.

After Lin Xiu returned to the hotel room, he took a hot bath and laid directly on the soft bed to rest.

Lin Xiu was a little tired and didn’t intend to practice the ‘Cultivation Technique’ again. He had a good rest and prepared to go to the Dark Forest tomorrow.

Lin Xiu had a feeling that he would meet Luo Yue in the Dark Forest.

Time passed quickly. When Lin Xiu opened his eyes, he could already see a faint light coming through the curtain.

“It’s seven o’clock.”

Lin Xiu, who has a good biological clock, woke up easily at this time.

After washing up, he carried his backpack, then walked out with the Dark Edge spear and saw Guo Ling standing at the door.

“I thought you haven’t got up yet.” Guo Ling smiled and said.

“I’m used to getting up early.” Lin Xiu smiled lightly.

At this moment, he looked ahead and Qiu Li and the others also walked out of the room one by one.

They were all neatly dressed and seemed to be in good spirits.

“Morning.”

After experiencing what happened yesterday, Qiu Li and the others did not regard Lin Xiu lightly and greeted him respectfully.

“Well, morning.” Lin Xiu nodded.

After having their breakfast in the hotel, the group of people rode out on their Android Battle Tigers.

“Why are there so many people?” Qian Lin looked around and said curiously.

Qiu Li and the rest also noticed that this small town was already bustling with activity so early in the morning.

And these people were undoubtedly warriors.

The Dark Forest was very dangerous and low-ranking warriors would rarely come here.

Like last night, those who wanted to attack Lin Xiu were the peak rank 5 warriors. They definitely had a reason for taking such a big risk to come here.

It was clear that according to the information that Lin Xiu inquired about last night, it was for the Ice Lotus Fire!

“It’s really a bit weird, why don’t we ask around first? Guo Ling also nodded.

She looked around and seeing the whole street full of warriors, she was also very puzzled.

“No need to ask, I know what it is.” Hearing what they said, Lin Xiu who was riding the Android Battle Tiger suddenly said aloud.

“You do?” Guo Ling was taken aback, then subconsciously turned around and asked Lin Xiu.

Qiu Li and the others also looked at Lin Xiu at this time.

Lin Xiu glanced around and when he saw that no one was paying attention to them, he suddenly said, “Ice Lotus Fire, the Dark Forest is said to have Ice lotus fire.”

“Ice Lotus Fire?”

They were taken aback when they heard Lin Xiu’s words.

They looked like they didn’t know what it was.

“If you don’t know what it is, you can check it on your phone.” Lin Xiu continued.

Guo Ling had already come to his senses and searched this thing on his phone. After reading the introduction of this thing, his eyes suddenly widened.
