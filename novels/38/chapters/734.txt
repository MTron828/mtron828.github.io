Chapter 735 The Power of Huangji

Lin Xiu was already holding the Dark Edge spear and rushed in front of him!

The sharp spearhead was about to stab his body directly.

However, Xue Liantian’s reaction speed was very fast and at this moment, he dodged directly.

But Lin Xiu’s offensive didn’t stop at all. The Dark Edge spear in his hand stabbed like countless spear shadows.

DangdangXue Liantian frantically danced his sword, constantly resisting the attack. The spearhead of the spear pierced the blade of the battle knife and sparks erupted.

Damn, why is this kid so powerful? Just by resisting Lin Xiu’s attack like this, Xue Liantian felt a little numb in the hand holding the sword.

As for Huangji, who was not far away, the expression in his eyes changed at this time.

But seeing that Lin Xiu was still attacking the snowy Lin Xiu, Huangji’s body suddenly moved.

With the movement of his body, at this moment, he directly rushed towards Lin Xiu.

He had to rely on the moment Lin Xiu attacking Xue Liantian to kill Lin Xiu in the back!

Go to hell!

Just when his figure instantly appeared behind Lin Xiu, a long sword in his hand slashed directly at Lin Xiu’s body from top to bottom!

Instantly chopped Lin Xiu’s body in half!

He’s dead!?

Xue Liantian, who was constantly resisting Lin Xiu’s offensive, was surprised to see Lin Xiu being directly cut in half.

“Right here!”

But at this time, Huangji’s eyes changed, then holding the weapon in his hand, he charged directly to the other side./

Looking in the direction Huangji rushed over, Xue Liantian saw that Lin Xiu had gone to the other side at some point!

What was it that he slashed just now!?

Phantom?

Dang– At this time, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand had already collided with the long sword in Huangji’s hand.

Under the collision of the weapon, a spark was emitted.

“You think I don’t know your tricks yet?”

Huangji looked at Lin Xiu in front of him and said with a sneer.

“Ha ha.”

Lin Xiu sneered and didn’t say much, the spear in his hand continued to wave.

After all, this old guy was a peak master warrior-level powerhouse. If he wanted to kill him directly, it was still a bit difficult.

Moreover, the cooldown of the ‘Fury’ skill was not completed yet, which was really a troublesome thing.

boom–

Just when Lin Xiu was thinking about how to kill Huangji, Huangji had already continued to attack Lin Xiu with the long sword in his hand!

Lin Xiu’s eyes changed and he continued to resist with the Dark Edge spear, making a dull sound.

“Mr. Huang, I’ll help you!”

Xue Liantian also shouted at this time, then rushed over from the other side.

He could feel that Lin Xiu was very dangerous. If he didn’t kill him now, things would become more troublesome later.

Seeing Xue Liantian also rushing over, Lin Xiu, who had resisted Huangji’s attack, could not help frowning.

If these two attacked him at the same time, he would most likely be killed!

Damn it!

“Humph! You want to kill me? I don’t know where your courage comes from!”

Huangji said mockingly while attacking Lin Xiu.

A rank 9 warrior wanted to kill him, a master warrior-level powerhouse, this was simply nonsensical!

And at this time, Xue Liantian had already rushed over from behind with a sword!

At this time, Lin Xiu also directly activated the system skill ‘Heavenly Array’.

As soon as this skill was activated, a white light burst out from Lin Xiu’s body.

Soon, these white rays of light were transmitted to the ground and the surrounding ground was covered with a layer of white patterns.

“A domain?”

When Huangji saw this scene, he sneered. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

But Lin Xiu’s figure at this time had disappeared in front of him and Xue Liantian also attacked.

Lin Xiu suddenly disappeared and his attack almost hit Huangji.

“Hid really fast.”

Xue Liantian clearly felt that Lin Xiu’s aura appeared on the other side and his face suddenly became a little ugly.

He was a master warrior, nevermind that he couldn’t kill a rank 9 warrior directly but he was actually being fooled by him.

It was simply shameful.

“Use the domain, kill him directly.” Huangji looked at Lin Xiu who had dodged to the opposite side and said coldly.

He had seen the battle between Lin Xiu and Wu Changkong.

The master warrior-level Wu Changkong was killed by Lin Xiu’s many bizarre skills.

And Lin Xiu dared to come here, he must have some kind of support.

He couldn’t drag any longer with Lin Xiu and had to kill him directly!

Hearing Huangji’s words, Xue Liantian also nodded, the two master warrior-level powerhouses released their own domains at the same time!

“This guy is dead...”

Those Xue Liantian’s subordinates who had just fought against Lin Xiu said out of breath.

Thinking of the scene of the battle just now, they all felt as if they had escaped death.

Huangji’s domain was a red glow, while the domain released by Xue Liantian was purple, which looked very strange.

But when their domains were just released, Lin Xiu’s body suddenly burst out with white light.

It seemed that another domain has been released!

How is this happening!?

Seeing this scene, the expressions in Huangji and Xue liantian’s eyes could not help but change slightly.

How can the power of the two domains be unleashed?!

Just when they were amazed, this domain power actually covered all their domain power!

“My domain power...”

Xue Liantian’s eyes were full of shock, because he clearly saw that his domain power had completely disappeared. Huangji’s face also became extremely gloomy at this time.

It could cover the domain powers of both himself and Xue Liantian.

What the hell is this!?

And what shocked them even more was still to come.

At this time, the rays of light from the stars shone down from the sky and directly reflected on Lin Xiu’s body.

It made Lin Xiu’s whole body instantly filled with light.

And this kind of light didn’t stop, making Lin Xiu’s whole body glow with white light, like a god descending to earth.

“Hu.”

Lin Xiu felt the filling power coming from his body at this time and he couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

Since ‘Fury’ cannot be used, then only ‘Power of the Stars’ can be used.

Previously, he didn’t use this skill when he was fighting during the day, so now there was no cooldown and he could use it directly.

“This guy’s combat power seemed to be rising like crazy...”

Not far away, one of Xue Liantian’s subordinates was wearing a special eye shield. After locking on Lin Xiu, he said with a trembling voice.
