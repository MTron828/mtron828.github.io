1469 Crushed!

Level seventy-five!

At this time, Lin Xiu looked surprised.

Unexpectedly, after Ling Tianxi, was killed by him, he really upgraded!

At this time, as the level rose, Lin Xiu could clearly feel an extremely comfortable feeling coming from his body.

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for reaching the seventy-fifth level and being bathed in holy light!”

At this time, the voice of the system came again in his mind.

Following the sound of the system, a white light instantly reflected on Lin Xiu’s body.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s physical injuries recovered quickly at a speed visible to the naked eye.

It feels so comfortable.

Lin Xiu closed his eyes at this time, enjoying the bath of the holy light.

“Damn guy…”

Huangfu Yuanshen looked at the scene below, and his face became extremely ugly.

Although he didn’t know exactly what happened.

But now it is obvious that Lin Xiu’s strength seems to have become stronger!

And what made him even more incredible was that at this moment, the wounds on Lin Xiu’s body began to heal at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Those wounds that looked horrific have all healed.

Now he clearly felt that something was wrong. At this moment, the long sword in his hand directly attacked Lin Xiu below!

Whoosh—

With his long sword slashing out, an incomparably powerful energy directly charged downwards!

As this powerful energy passed by, the surrounding space was directly impacted with many space cracks.

Lin Xiu looked up at this scene and snorted coldly.

After being bathed in the holy light just now, Lin Xiu’s wounds not only healed completely.

Moreover, the original strength of the body has completely recovered to its best state at this time!

Boom——

Huangfu Yuanshen, the incomparably powerful force from the long sword was directly blocked by the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded at this moment.

Lin Xiu was unscathed.

This is impossible!

Seeing this scene, Huangfu Yuanshen’s eyes widened.

His eyes were full of disbelief.

The power he released just now is not weak at all.

Even the space can be easily broken open, but at this moment, there is absolutely no way to cause any damage to the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded!

“die!!!”

Huangfu Yuanshen’s eyes widened. At this moment, he not only waved the long sword in his hand, but also unleashed waves of a powerful force, and continued to attack Lin Xiu below!

Boom, boom, boom——

An incomparably powerful force hit the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu had unfolded, and there were loud sounds.

But Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ perfectly resisted all of this.

He didn’t even move a single step!

Just after the upgrade, Lin Xiu hadn’t had time to check yet.

But he could clearly feel that his strength has been enhanced in all aspects!

Damn it!!!

Huangfu Yuanshen looked at this scene, and the expression on his face became extremely ugly.

At this moment, the long sword in his hand exploded with incomparably powerful power.

Whoosh—

The next moment, he was in front of Lin Xiu.

The long sword in his hand crazily attacked Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

Bang bang bang——

At this time, loud noises sounded.

But no matter how he attacked, he couldn’t break the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded!

Boom, boom, boom——

With his attack, the surrounding ground kept shaking.

“Your strength has surpassed his.”

At this time, the phantom of Zhu Long also appeared beside Lin Xiu.

“You should have absorbed all of the old man’s power.”

At this moment, Zhu Long stared at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu didn’t say a word. Now he can clearly feel it. After upgrading to level 75, he already could feel the improvement in strength.

This kind of power increase is really too exaggerated. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

Far stronger than before!

At this time, Lin Xiu’s eyes were already filled with intense killing intent.

“die.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

At this moment, with Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the Dark Edge spear in his hand released a strong Flame of Chaos!

At this moment, the barrel of the Dark Edge spear made a ‘clank’ sound.

The spear seemed to be shaking!

Huangfu Yuanshen, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly at this moment.

Because at this moment, he found that Lin Xiu had already stabbed him with the Dark Edge spear in his hand!

The Flame of Chaos carried in the spear is much stronger than the previous Flame of chaos.

This time, Lin Xiu’s powerful body has been able to release the truly powerful Flame of Chaos!

when–

As the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand stabbed out, the next moment, it collided with Huangfu Yuanshen’s long sword.

Suddenly, an incomparably loud sound erupted.

It’s so hot!

The long sword held by Huangfu Yuanshen felt as if it was going to be melted at this moment.

It’s hot, it’s really too hot!

But at this time, Lin Xiu was still holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, and kept stabbing out!

At this time, the speed of the Dark Edge spear piercing out was extremely fast.

After Huangfu Yuanshen forcibly resisted a few times, the long sword in his hand had a hole!

This sword cannot withstand the attack of the Dark Edge spear at all.

“Bye now.”

As soon as Lin Xiu finished speaking, Lin Xiu swung the Dark Edge spear in both hands directly into the air.

Boom——

An incomparably huge flame erupted directly at this moment.

It formed a huge flame dragon and charged toward him!

“No!!!”

Looking at this scene, Huangfu Yuanshen looked at this scene, and the expression in his eyes changed drastically.

At this time, he let out a low growl.

The strength of his body also exploded completely. While forming an extremely strong ‘Sphere’, the strength of his body and a large amount of energy in his hands gathered together, forming a huge energy shock wave, which rushed towards Lin Xiu. !

Boom——

The huge energy shock wave he released collided with the flame dragon formed by Lin Xiu’s Flame of Chaos, and a huge and incomparably loud sound erupted immediately.

The surrounding ground collapsed at this moment.

The powerful energy impact released by Huangfu Yuanshen, at this time, the black dragon formed by the Flame of Chaos directly impacted and disappeared!

In the next moment, the terrifying flame dragon is about to charge towards the ‘Sphere’ he gathered!

Seeing this scene, the pupils in Huangfu Yuanshen’s eyes shrank slightly, and he broke open the space directly, about to run away!
