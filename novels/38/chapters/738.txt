Chapter 739: Finally Killing Huangji

But at this time, this terrifying evolved beast has waved its claws and slapped Huangji again!

Boom—

As its claws slapped down, it made a loud noise.

Blowing up a thousand piles of snow.

Huangji’s reaction ability was still very fast and his body leaped up at this moment, dodging the blow.

But this terrifying evolved beast seems to have regarded him as a target to hunt down and attacked him frantically.

“Run... run quickly…”

Xue Liantian’s subordinates, seeing this scene, said with trembling bodies.

Just now they thought Huangji would be able to kill Lin Xiu, but after this terrifying evolved beast came out, they felt incomparable fear.

At this moment, both legs trembled.

“Run where?”

Just when they were about to leave, they found that Lin Xiu had appeared in front of them at some point.

Looking at Lin Xiu who appeared behind, these people suddenly seemed to have seen a ghost and their expressions changed greatly.

These people now know the gap in their own strength and now they don’t have any will to fight at all, so they wanted to run to the other side.

But Lin Xiu didn’t give them any chance at all and rushed over with the spear in his hand!

Under the blessing of ‘Fury’, ‘Power of the Stars’ and even ‘Heavenly Array’, Lin Xiu’s current strength has reached its peak.

With a direct stroke of the spear in his hand, those people didn’t even have a chance to unfold the “Sphere” and they were all killed by Lin Xiu!

He looked to the back and saw the old man Huangji was still fighting with the evolved beast summoned by the system skills.

And at this time, if you look closely at the system interface, you can clearly see the ‘Exotic Summoning’ skill, which seemed to have a countdown of time.

“Five minutes, does the summoned evolved beast only have five minutes?”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

Now more than two minutes had been wasted and he couldn’t afford wasting more!

Looking to the front, Huangji was still dodging the attack of the evolved beast.

Although he was a peak master warrior, it was still not that easy to deal with that terrifying evolved beast.

And he didn’t want to kill this evolved beast, because his target was Lin Xiu!

Before Huangji could find Lin Xiu and attack, Lin Xiu had already rushed out first.

“Boy, go to hell!”

Huangji, who jumped up in the sky, then came down, saw Lin Xiu’s figure at this time and suddenly shouted loudly.

With the long sword in his hand, he swung it in the air!

The crescent-shaped sword aura directly charged over.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu, who rushed over, sneered when he saw this scene and swung the Dark Edge spear he was holding to block the sword aura.

Now Huangji was entangled by the evolved beast summoned by that system skill and had used up quite a lot of source strength.

At this time, the strength of his skill was obviously not that strong.

And Lin Xiu, because of the influence of the power brought by the upgrade just now, is still at his peak!

“Damn!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu easily withstood his attack, Huangji’s face became even more hideous.

Just when he made a move, the terrifying evolved beast directly slapped his body with its claws! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Boom—

With this slap, the whole ground shook again.

And Huangji, at this time, could only dodge.

But just as his body was dodging, the head of the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand stabbed him.

Dang–

Looking at the spearhead that was coming, the pupils in Huangji’s eyes shrank slightly and the long sword in his hand resisted it.

Boom–

But while he resisted Lin Xiu’s attack, the claws of the terrifying evolved beast had already grabbed him!

Because he had to resist Lin Xiu’s attack, this time, Huangji had no way to dodge.

His body was directly caught by the huge claws of this evolved beast!

Huangji’s face changed greatly, his body suddenly wanted to break free, but he found that he couldn’t break free at all!

“Go to hell!”

Lin Xiu let out a roar and the Dark Edge spear full of dark red flames stabbed straight out!

“No!!!”

Huangji roared. Although he was grabbed by the claws of this terrifying evolved beast, he still wanted to mobilize the source strength of his whole body and once again unfolded his ‘Sphere’ to resist the blow.

Just now Lin Xiu used ‘Golden Body Immortality’ to resist Huangji’s full-strength blow. Now Huangji’s source strength was not that strong anymore.

The Dark Edge spear emitted a dark red light.

Bang bang bang-

The long spear stabbed out and it was as if hundreds of spears were stabbed out in an instant.

The tip of the spear slammed into his ‘Sphere’, making loud noises continuously.

Pff—

Huangji, who was originally caught by this evolved beast, felt that his entire body was in great pain from being pinched by the evolved beast’s claws.

Coupled with Lin Xiu’s frantic attack, a mouthful of blood spat out from his mouth.

Break!!!

Lin Xiu clearly felt that Huangji was an arrow at the end of its flight. ” ”.At this moment, he roared in his heart and the offensive became even more fierce!

The ‘Sphere’ that Huangji unfolded now has many cracks.

Boom—

Finally, at the next moment, his ‘Sphere’ exploded directly.

Lin Xiu didn’t stop his movements in the slightest. After breaking the “Sphere”, the spear directly stabbed him in the chest!

Boom–

As the spear penetrated his chest, a stream of blood spurted out instantly.

“You you...”

Huangji opened his eyes wide and blood continuously flowed out of his mouth.

Huangji never thought that the ant, whom he had always looked down on and wanted to find a chance to kill him, actually killed him.

How can that be? How could this ant kill him?

Roar–

At this time, the evolved beast roared loudly, grabbed Huangji’s body directly and sent it into his mouth.

He swallowed Huangji in an instant.

“It is finally over.”

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but heaved a sigh of relief.

The snow was still falling and soon, the figure of this huge evolved beast began to slowly turn into tiny particles, then gathered into a ball and disappeared into the space crack.

And Lin Xiu, because of the end of the ‘Fury’ time, was in a state of exhaustion at this time and he collapsed on the snow, panting.

However, because of the influence of the Heart of Frost, Lin Xiu did not feel the cold on this snowy ground.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations, master, you have successfully killed a master warrior and gained experience...”

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for successfully upgrading! The current level is 51!”

Upgraded again!?

Hearing the prompt from the system in his mind, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but be surprised.

Because of the battle just now, Lin Xiu hadn’t taken a closer look at the attributes after the upgrade.

What kind of title will he get when he reaches the master warrior!?
