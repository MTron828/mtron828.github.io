Chapter 1044: What I’m Looking For Is the Bai Family

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

With a wave of Lin Xiu’s right hand, an earth-attribute power was immediately released.

The surrounding rocks quickly formed into rock monsters, attacking the giant rock dragon that came over!

boom boom boom —

Soon, both the rock monsters and the giant rock dragon shattered into countless pieces.

At this time, the three Sage warriors were completely panicked.

They never imagined that Lin Xiu would be proficient in so many attribute energies.

“What a bunch of trash!”

Bai Zhanfei who was at the back, saw this scene and his face became extremely ugly.

He never imagined that things would develop to this level.

The Five Elements Sage warriors, who had always been invincible, already had two people killed in this short moment!

This time, not only was the loss heavy.

Even his life may be in danger.

Damn it!

Bai Zhanfei hesitated for a while, then he wanted to control his huge mechanical mount and leave.

“Want to flee?”

Lin Xiu saw the situation over there from a distance and said coldly.

Ignoring the three Sage warriors, Lin Xiu rushed over there first and captured Bai Zhanfei.

“Don’t think about going over!”

Looking at Lin Xiu’s movements, the three Sage warriors directly blocked Lin Xiu.

“Courting death.”

While Lin Xiu said lightly, a black source mark appeared on his forehead.

The remaining three Sage warriors had already played all their cards and there was no threat to him.

As Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered, in the next moment, one after another translucent energy matrix appeared directly on their side!

what is this!?

Looking at the sudden appearance of the matrix, the three Sage warriors were all startled.

Whoosh whoosh—

At this time, with the triggering of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, a series of matrices appeared again and again.

But these three Sage warriors clearly felt the strangeness of these matrices. At this time, their figures were constantly flashing and those matrices were difficult to frame their bodies. Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly at this moment, his thoughts were triggered and in the next moment, the source mark on his forehead transformed into a golden source mark.

With the use of the power of the source mark, golden flame balls burst out from the source markin an instant, then charged towards the three Sage warriors!

The temperature of these golden flames is no weaker than those of dark blue flames.

At this time, as the flames rushed out, the three Sage warriors had no choice but to quickly unfold the ‘Sphere’ to resist.

And in the next moment, the source mark on Lin Xiu’s forehead changed back to the black one.

While they were dodging the flame ball’s attack and predicting where they were about to dodge, Lin Xiu’s matrix directly framed their bodies!

At this moment, the three warriors felt that their bodies were being framed in these matrices and the expressions in their eyes suddenly changed greatly.

At this time, they subconsciously wanted to break through this matrix, but found that they couldn’t break through at all!

And in this matrix, the power of the body seems to be suppressed.

There is absolutely no way to escape!

This is impossible!

At this moment, the eyes of the three Sage warriors showed horror.

There is no way to use the source strength, which means that they were like lambs about to be slaughtered now!

bang bang bang-

They slammed into the matrix frantically, but they still couldn’t break through.

At the same time, Lin Xiu ignored them and flew directly towards the side where Bai Zhanfei fled.

In the matrix, there was no way for their bodies to break free, so Lin Xiu didn’t have to worry about it.

“Damn!”

At this time, Bai Zhanfei was already riding this huge mechanical mount and fled to the other side.

This time, he came out to travel and brought enough strength to protect him.

When he was here, he met the huge artificial angel and he fell in love with it at first sight.

For him, there is no way to get anything he wants.

But when things developed to this point, he really did not expect it at all.

His strongest protection team, Five Elements Sage Warriors, Gold Sage Warrior and Fire Sage Warrior, were killed by Lin Xiu so easily.

These two are the most powerful beings among the Five Elements Sage warriors.

Although he was arrogant before, he is not a fool. At this time, he frantically drove the mechanical mount away.

“Where are you going?”

Although the speed of this mechanical mount was very fast, in the next moment, a figure appeared in the area ahead.

how can that be!?

Looking at the scene in front of him, Bai Zhanfei opened his eyes wide with an unbelievable look in his eyes.

Because in front, the figure of Lin Xiu appeared!

How could he be so fast!

“Get away!”

Bai Zhanfei roared angrily at this time and continued to drive the mechanical mount toward Lin Xiu!

He was going to knock Lin Xiu straight!

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu watched this scene and the moment his mechanical mount charged over, he swung the Dark Edge spear in his hand.

boom–

The spear attacked his mechanical mount, making a loud noise.

This mechanical mount simply flew out!

Boom—

As the mechanical mount smashed heavily on the ground behind it, a loud noise suddenly came out.

But soon, the mechanical mount, which fell to the ground, slowly got up again automatically.

Taking a closer look, there seems to be an energy barrier around this mechanical mount, which blocked all the attacks from Lin Xiu just now.

“Damn…”

Bai Zhanfei’s body didn’t seem to be hurt, but he looked at Lin Xiu who was not far away and his eyes were sinister.

“Why, you still want to escape?”

Lin Xiu looked at him, his eyes narrowed slightly.

“Do you know who am I huh?”

Bai Zhanfei’s face turned gloomy, his eyes fixed on Lin Xiu who was not far away and said aloud.

Although this mechanical mount has an energy barrier to help him resist the attack, if Lin Xiu thought about it, he could still destroy his mechanical mount in minutes.

After all, Lin Xiu just killed several Sage warriors one after another!

“Bai family right?” 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

“That’s right, if you leave now, I might not pursue this matter.”

Bai Zhanfei said coldly.

“I’m sorry, I’m looking for someone from the Bai family.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

As soon as his words fell, Lin Xiu’s figure flashed and disappeared.

While Bai Zhanfei was shocked, Lin Xiu appeared in front of him again.

The Dark Edge spear he held in his hand slashed directly toward Bai Zhanfei!
