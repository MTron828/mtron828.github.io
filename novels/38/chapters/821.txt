Chapter 822: Respected Warrior, Huang Ying!

Luo Jiucheng’s sword was immediately pushed away by Lin Xiu who rushed toward them.

He grabbed onto Luo Yue’s waist and pulled her backwards.

“Damn it. That son of a b*tch...”

The warrior king that was using his lightning and thunder looked sickeningly mad.

This was because Lin Xiu doesn’t seem to be afraid of lightning or thunder.

With his strong source mark, it seems to be harmless toward Lin Xiu.

“Get that chick from the Luo family first!”

Some of the warrior kings noticed how Lin Xiu was being extra protective over Luo Yue and immediately knew that Luo Yue meant a lot to him.

If they got their hands on Luo Yue, Lin Xiu would be over!

The rest of the warrior kings started attacking them once again and the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes were different now.

Before they could come close to him, Lin Xiu was already spinning his spear.

Koong loong – –

One after another, there were numerous flaming birds that rushed out of the spear and were headed towards them.

Damn it!

The warrior kings didn’t even have the opportunity to get close to Lin Xiu.

Their plan was perfect but first they had to capture Luo Yue which seemed impossible at this point.

These flaming birds were formed by hellfire. When it comes to hellfire, even if they were warrior kings, they still wouldn’t dare to come in contact with them!

“Go to hell!”

At that moment, Luo Jiucheng picked up his sword once again and attacked.

However, this time, he was headed toward Luo Yan!

When Luo Yue saw it happening, she quickly ran to her sister.

As for Lin Xiu, he reacted quickly as well. He leaped into the air and sliced his spear onto the ground!

Boom – –

Luo Jiucheng honestly did not expect Lin Xiu to be able to react so quickly.

His arm that was holding onto the spear was instantly chopped off by Lin Xiu’s spear.

There was blood everywhere.

“AHHHHHHH!!!!”

Luo Jiucheng screamed in vain and slapped Lin Xiu with his other hand.

That slap was extremely strong. Although it did not hit directly on Lini Xiu’s body, the impact of it was enough to throw Lin Xiu on to the ground. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This was a good opportunity!

As for the rest of the warriors, they noticed their chances and activated their strongest warrior skills, aimed towards Lin Xiu!

“You’re dead!!”

All of them screamed in rage and there was terrifying energy coming in all directions towards Lin Xiu.

“Go!!!”

When he saw Luo Yue and Luo Yan near him, he quickly pushed them aside.

Koong Loong – –

Those warrior skills that were overpowering landed on top of Lin Xiu and the ground beneath him broke as well.

“LIN XIU!!!!”

Seeing what had happened to the ground, Luo Yue, who had been emotionless, turned ghastly pale as if she had lost all the energy in her body.

“Lin Xiu wouldn’t be dead...”

Luo Yan gritted her teeth as she mumbled to herself.

“HMPH! There are 14 warrior kings who unleashed their strongest warrior skills at the same time! You wouldn’t even dare to be alive!”

One of the warrior kings let out a cold laugh.

All of them had released their strongest skills and had attacked Lin Xiu at the same time.

Even if Lin Xiu was strong, he would still be dead!

“Looks like all of you have already used up your strongest skill?”

The smiles on their faces did not stay for long as there was a familiar voice that came from behind.

The smile on their faces froze as their eyes widened in shock, unable to believe what they had just heard.

With the wind blowing away the dust, Lin Xiu’s figure slowly appeared in front of their eyes.

“How is this possible?!”

The looks on their faces were awful.

How was it possible that Lin Xiu was alive?!

Those were skills that were released by 14 warrior kings at the same time!

If he survived it, could he be a respected warrior?!

No! That’s not possible! There was only one in the entire world!

Plus, the strength of a respected warrior is extremely strong. He would have been able to defeat them easily.

It was obvious that Lin Xiu was not a respected warrior.

Pfft – –

Then, Lin Xiu spat out a mouthful of blood.

Although Lin Xiu managed to activate the ‘Golden Body Immortality’ while he was in that dangerous state earlier and blocked most of the attack, there was still a split second where he was exposed to the impact and it had affected him.

Plus, the time for ‘Rage’ was coming to an end.

“That brat has nothing left now. Let’s go!”

The rest of the warrior kings could also feel that Lin Xiu’s condition wasn’t at its peak. They shouted out loud and continued attacking him.

Lin Xiu sneered and within a blink of an eye, he activated ‘Reset’.

Following that, he used ‘Rage’ combined with ‘Heavenly Array’!!!

‘Freezing the Distance’ !!!

Seeing how they were rushing towards him, the heart of frost was beating frantically. There was a snow storm that appeared out of nowhere and the entire place was covered with ice and snow!

Crap!

Some of them turned pale as they didn’t think that Lin Xiu would still be able to release such terrifying skills.

One of the warrior kings touched the cold wind that was blowing at them. His hand was immediately frozen and it exploded on its own.

“AHHHHHH!!!!”

The warrior kings’ attacks have failed once again.

“Do you think that you could defeat me?!”

Lin Xiu shouted out loud and was prepared to attack them.

As long as he could get rid of all these warrior kings, he didn’t care about the rest of the warrior masters. Even if there was a large number of them, he would still be able to get rid of them with his flaming birds!

“Don’t you dare!”

Suddenly, there was a loud voice that came from the sky.

A figure slowly appeared in the air.

It was a middle-aged man and he was dressed in a luxurious costume.

He snapped his finger and a bright light appeared. It was directly aimed towards Lin Xiu!

‘Yuan’!

Lin Xiu stared at the man and quickly released his ‘Yuan’.

However, that was an incredibly strong energy that could pierce through Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’. It even got through Lin Xiu’s body!

With the powerful impact, Lin Xiu’s body was like a kite with a broken string as he was thrown aside.

Luo Yue quickly ran towards him and caught Lin Xiu.

“Your majesty!”

When the warrior kings saw who it was, all of them were surprised.

The emperor?

The only person who is a respected warrior!

Huang Ying!

“He’s so strong...”

Lin Xiu, who was being held by Luo Yue, mumbled to himself.

With only one snap of his fingers, he was able to give out such a powerful explosion.

“Rubbish.”

Huang Ying turned towards the demon that came out of the space who was still attacking the other warriors. He flew towards it and with a gentle sweep from his left hand, a huge sword that was formed by a golden energy appeared in his arm.

With one clean swipe, he instantly chopped off the demon’s arm!

“Are you alright?!”

Luo Yue panicked as she looked at the man in her arms.

There was a huge bloody hole on his shoulder and it was obvious that it came from the attack of the emperor.

“Quick! Leave at once!”
