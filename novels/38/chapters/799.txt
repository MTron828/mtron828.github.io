Chapter 800: Absorption Is Successful!

“This...isn’t this Brother Lin’s weapon…”

When Liu Pan saw this scene, his eyes widened.

“Why in this auction house...”

Liu Pan was stunned for a moment, but soon came back to his senses and thought of a terrifying possibility.

Could it be that Lin Xiu has...

“Impossible. With Brother Lin’s strength, no one can do anything to him.”

An Qi and Qian Lin also didn’t want to believe that something would happen to Lin Xiu, but this is Lin Xiu’s special weapon.

If nothing happened, how did it get here...

“Anyway, at the auction tomorrow, I must get master’s spear back!”

An Qi clenched her fists and said.

Liu Pan looked afar and he seemed to be in a bad mood.

Brother Lin... are you really all right?

boom boom boom —

At the same time, Lin Xiu’s body was still in that terrifying hellfire.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s body was no longer burnt by this terrifying flame.

And Lin Xiu, who was sitting cross-legged on the ground, like an old monk entering the ground, opened his eyes at this time.

The dark blue hellfire covered the body at this time.

But Lin Xiu didn’t feel much pain anymore.

“Phew...”

Lin Xiu could not help but heaved a sigh of relief at this time.

Fortunately, his physical strength was strong and he has learned the ‘bodybuilding technique’, otherwise, he might really die here.

Looking at the middle, you can see that there is a flame that emits a relatively strong light in the middle.

The hellfire that he had endured before was split from this flame.

What is truly terrifying is this little flame.

What should he do now?

If he wanted to go out now, it shouldn’t be a problem, but...

He looked at the group of flames.

If he absorbs the source strength of this hellfire, his strength would improve.

And he can control the hellfire.

The power of this hellfire is not even an ordinary King Warrior dare to provoke.

The fire of the fire lotus, which was terrifying on Earth before, is no longer effective against warriors of the king warrior level on this planet.

Moreover, Fengyun City probably had more powerful warriors.

He must improve his strength as soon as possible!

Gritting his teeth, Lin Xiu walked over to the middle.

As soon as he walked over, he clearly felt an even more terrifying burning sensation.

Lin Xiu’s body has become even more terrifying under the continuous forging of Lin Xiu’s body during this period of time.

But even so, when he approached the source flame of this hellfire, he still felt a little overwhelmed.

Lin Xiu hesitated for a while, then reached out and touched the flame.

Whatever!

As soon as Lin Xiu gritted his teeth, his fingers touched the flames.

Shit...

The moment his fingers touched the flames, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

The pain caused the whole body to tremble.

As the saying goes, the nerves of the fingertips are linked with the heart. At this moment, the fingers were burned till his bones could be seen.

The pain was imagineable.

But Lin Xiu’s recovery rate at this time was also very amazing and the burned fingers also healed quickly.

But the moment it healed, it started to burn again.

He would have been driven insane long ago if he was an ordinary person.

But at this time, Lin Xiu’s nerves became stronger, he gritted his teeth and at the same time he used the system skill ‘Engulf’, then used the ‘Bodybuidling technique.

The source fire that was slowly guiding this hellfire began to slowly absorb into his body.

After the flames of the hellfire entered his body, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the meridians of his entire body and as the traces of hellfire entered, it became extremely painful.

It hurts too much.

But Lin Xiu seemed to be numb and continued to guide the flame, slowly inhaling from his fingers, then passing it to the various meridians of the body.

This is even more painful than when he first fell.

Hang in there!

This flame looks small, but it is very difficult to absorb all of it.

The energy it contains is really terrifying.

If he directly absorb it into his body, he would probably explode and die.

It can only be absorbed little by little and slowly guided into one’s body.

This process is also the most painful, because the pain continues.

And he couldn’t let this pain affect his future strength.

Minutes and seconds passed, but Lin Xiu still remained in a position without moving.

After so many days of pain, Lin Xiu has become a little numb.

Slowly, after some time, there were a little bit of flames left.

With the absorption of the last bit into his body, the veins all over Lin Xiu’s body seemed to burst.

The whole person fell to the ground and kept rolling.

This hellfire kept scurrying around in his body, as if his entire body was going to explode and die.

damn...

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide and in the next moment, he fell into a coma again.

On this day, An Qi and others have already gone to the auction.

“Why didn’t Brother Lin come back...”

When Liu Pan followed An Qi and Qian Lin into the auction venue, he said out loud to himself.

“Fatty, don’t talk about it, Master will be fine!”

When An Qi heard Liu Pan talking to himself again, she said in a very irritable voice.

On this day, Lin Xiu still did not come back.

“He will definitely come back.” Qian Lin firmly believed.

Just as the three of them were sitting on their reserved seats, Sun Zi and Yan Yongxin just happened to come over from the other side.

“Humph!”

Looking at Sun Zi’s eyes, An Qi couldn’t help snorting coldly.

“Why, you also came here to get something?”

With a strange smile on the corner of Sun Zi’s mouth, he walked over and said to Lin Xiu.

An Qi and Qian Lin looked at him coldly and didn’t say anything.

“Do you want that spear?”

Sun Zi seemed to have thought of something and continued to say with a smile.

“What do you mean!?”

When An Qi heard Sun Zi’s words, the expression in her eyes couldn’t help changing.

“It was you who took Brother Lin’s weapons!”

When Liu Pan’s expression changed, he stood up and reached out to grab Sun Zi.

crackling-

But at this moment, a wall of lightning appeared in front of Liu Pan.

And Liu Pan’s hand also touched the lightning wall without a doubt.

The terrifying electric current was instantly transmitted to Liu Pan’s entire body. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The severe pain made Liu Pan’s body tremble several times and he almost fell to the ground.

“Are you OK?”

At this moment, Qian Lin hurried forward to support Liu Pan, who was on the verge of collapsin.

“I’m...I’m okay...”
