Chapter 291: Successful Capture

As Lin Xiu continued to kill those monsters in front, Guo Ling and the others had already gathered at the back.

Watching Lin Xiu continuously release those phoenixes and killing all the Black Tooth Spiders, Guo Ling’s eyes were full of shock.

She was still glad that she invited Lin Xiu to come to this Dark Forest with them.

She had definitely made a wise choice.

She looked to the side and saw the corpses of the warriors who had been killed by them just now, as well as the corpse of a huge mutated Black Tooth Spider lying next to her.

She threw a very powerful bomb into its mouth and it exploded so it was dead at this moment.

Although its carapace was very hard, it was still very fragile inside.

“Qiu Li, are your hands all right?” Guo Ling turned to Qiu Li and asked.

“It’s fine, I should be able to move tomorrow.” Qiu Li shook his head and said to Guo Ling.

Qian Lin used those emergency treatment tools for treatment and his arm was saved.

And it was healing at a very fast speed, but it wasn’t so easy to heal the nerves and would take time.

“En, if we find a mutated Black Tooth Spider tonight, we can go back tomorrow.” Guo Ling nodded.

With Qiu Li in this state, if he encountered something, there was no way to fight back.

“Hurry up! Do you have something to catch it!!!” Lin Xiu who was in front, waved his Dark Edge Spear, and phoenixes charged to the front.

All those Black Tooth Spiders were annihilated at this moment but among them, there was a light blue Black Tooth Spider rushing towards him.

This thing was not afraid of his flames and Lin Xiu could tell at one glance that it must be the mutated Black Tooth Spider!

Only mutated Black Tooth Spiders had this kind of fire resistance and they were not afraid of Lin Xiu’s flames!

And this mutated Black Tooth Spider was very small compared to the one just now, it was only the size of a bowl!

This size was obviously the most suitable for capture!

“Mutated Black Tooth Spider!?” Guo Ling looked in front and saw the small mutated Black Tooth Spider that appeared.

The speed of this thing was very fast and it was about to hit Lin Xiu’s body.

“Hng!” Lin Xiu sneered when he saw that the little thing wanted to kill him.

He lifted his right foot and stepped on it directly with exceptional precision.

Bang–

A dull sound resounded and with Lin Xiu’s right foot on its body, it couldn’t move at all.

Moreover, Lin Xiu’s hands did not stop moving as he continued to wave the Dark Edge Spear and released phoenixes to attack.

Guo Ling didn’t hesitate at all and started to flip through his backpack.

Very quickly, he took out a black rectangular object.

“Hurry up!” Lin Xiu shouted at this moment because he could feel that the mutated Black Tooth Spider under his foot was struggling wildly.

Lin Xiu could sense that this mutated Black Tooth Spider was very strong. He had already used a lot of his strength yet it was still a challenge trying to keep the mutated Black Tooth Spider from moving.

Damn it!

Lin Xiu cursed, then continued to exert strength on his right foot.

Guo Ling reacted quickly as well and rushed directly to the front and squatted down beside the mutated Black Tooth Spider that Lin Xiu had stepped on.

“Release your foot!” Guo Ling found a good opportunity and called out to Lin Xiu.

Hearing Guo Ling’s words, Lin Xiu did not hesitate to retract his right foot.

Bang–

Just as Lin Xiu released the mutated Black Tooth Spider, it jumped out.

The pupils in Guo Ling’s eyes constricted and he directly pressed the piece of black square against its body!

Click——

When pressed against the spider’s body, this black square object unfolded instantly.

It suddenly became a square box, capturing the mutated Black Tooth Spider inside.

“It’s done!?” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but exclaimed when he saw this scene.

Now the mutated Black Tooth Spider was contained in the square box made of special materials.

Bang bang bang—— UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The Black Tooth Spider in the box seemed to be constantly struggling, but the quality of this box was obviously very good; no matter how hard it struggled, it couldn’t escape at all.

“Yeah.” Guo Ling nodded with a look of surprise on her face. Originally, she thought it would take a lot of time to find a mutated Black Tooth Spider of a suitable size to capture, but she didn’t expect it to be so fast. They were actually done.

As long as they brought this thing back, their mission is completed.

Lin Xiu nodded and when he looked towards the front, he also realized that the number of Black Tooth Spiders rushing up had gradually decreased.

Lin Xiu found it a pity. If the Black Tooth Spiders continue to come, it is possible that he can be upgraded to level 30 just by killing all of them until tomorrow morning, right?!

With that thought, Lin Xiu sighed.

Boom——

As Lin Xiu waved his spear one final time, the phoenixes directly annihilated the last wave of Black Tooth Spiders.

“Worn out.”

After seeing the last Black Tooth Spider annihilated by his flames, Lin Xiu laid on the ground and panted heavily.

Although Lin Xiu was very excited when he killed these Black Tooth Spiders, as soon as he laid on the ground and rested, Lin Xiu felt that he had no strength left in him.

He had no energy to continue fighting.

Lin Xiu laid on the ground, panting continuously.

“They’ve all been wiped out!?” Chen Jin and the others went forward at this moment and looked at the burned corpses of the Black Tooth Spiders everywhere – their eyes were filled with shock.

They had no idea how many Black Tooth Spiders there were, it was simply impossible to count.

Some of them were killed by the flames released by their flamethrowers, but Lin Xiu dealt with most of them himself.

It could be said that Lin Xiu’s strength alone was comparable to all their strength together.
