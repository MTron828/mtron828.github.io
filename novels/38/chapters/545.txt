Boom–

As his saber came down, Lin Xiu directly blocked it with his Dark Edge spear.

Under the collision of the weapons, there was a loud noise.

“Die!!!”

The man was obviously furious. At this time, he waved the saber in his hand and slashed towards Lin Xiu frantically.

Although the weight of this saber was very heavy, this man could hold and swing it wildly.

The sword aura produced by this saber was very terrifying and because of the influence of the sword aura, a large number of deep cracks appeared on the surrounding trees.

You must know that this kind of tree was not an ordinary tree and its branches were harder than steel.

And Lin Xiu, who was fighting the man with the Dark Edge spear, also clearly felt the tingling sensation in his hand.

After Lin Xiu resisted his blow again, he slammed hard and the moment he pushed him away, the Dark Edge spear in his right hand swung violently!

‘Awe of the Phoenix’!!!

The flames shot out of the spear tip, instantly forming flaming birds, which charged directly in front of them! ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The man’s expression suddenly changed when he saw this scene and he stopped attacking at this time, then quickly dodged the incoming flaming birds.

The flaming bird passed by his side and he could clearly feel the terrifying power contained in it.

The surrounding space suddenly became extremely hot.

And at this time, Lin Xiu took advantage of these flaming birds charging over and he rushed towards the man!

After using the ‘Without a Trace’ body skill, Lin Xiu’s body was like a phantom, making it impossible for people to see clearly.

Damn it!

The man with the saber gritted his teeth and his eyes were full of raging anger.

However, Lin Xiu was too unpredictable. All he saw was Lin Xiu’s phantoms and he didn’t know which was the real Lin Xiu and which was fake!

Swoosh—

When he was looking around at Lin Xiu’s phantoms, the real Lin Xiu had already stabbed the back of his head from behind!

Dang–

But at this critical moment, the man still reacted and the saber directly blocked the attack.

The tip of the spear collided with the blade of his blade, bursting with sparks.

And at this moment, a large amount of lightning surged from the spearhead and it was transmitted directly to his body through his blade!

“It’s useless!”

The man let out a loud roar, just as he was trying to prove that he was often trained in electric shocks and would not be affected by the lightning released by Lin Xiu at this time, he felt a strong tingling sensation in his body instantly.

Like being struck by lightning!

How could this be!?

His body went numb and when he didn’t have time to move, Lin Xiu’s spear continued to stab his body!

Sphere!

He roared in his heart, but still came his senses and a light blue barrier instantly surrounded his body.

But as soon as his ‘Sphere’ was unfolded, Lin Xiu’s spear pierced through it!

Not only the man was horrified at this scene, but even Lin Lang and the others opened their eyes and mouths wide and were completely shocked.

“Goodbye.”

The man thought that his ‘Sphere’ could resist Lin Xiu’s attack and wouldn’t need to block at all. At this time, as Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear pierced his head and blood spurted out instantly.

As Lin Xiu pulled the Dark Edge spear out of his head again and his body fell directly to the ground.

His eyes were still wide open. Even when he died, he still didn’t understand how Lin Xiu could break the ‘Sphere’.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing a rank 6 warrior and gaining 50,000,000 experience!!!”

The 50 million experience was about the same as before.

For Lin Xiu now, even a peak rank 6 warrior would not be a match for him.

Lin Xiu saw that the man seemed to be carrying a backpack.

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly, then holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he directly cut through his backpack and could clearly see more than a dozen different crystals of different colors.

At this time, he checked it and the purity of these odd crystals was very high and half of them were rank 7.

This was an unexpected gain. Now Lin Xiu needed to quickly absorb the energy of these odd crystals, then improve his physical strength.

The presence of the people from Sky City really put a lot of pressure on Lin Xiu.

And...

Lin Xiu thought of something and looked at the jade pendant around his neck and seemed to feel a touch of warmth.

“Senior.”

Just when Lin Xiu was lost in thought, a voice came from beside him.

After Lin Xiu put these odd crystals in the pocket of his battle suit, he turned around and looked behind and saw Lin Lang and the others approaching.

“Don’t call me senior.” Lin Xiu looked at the people walking by, then shook his head.

“Then…” Lin Lang was startled, because Lin Xiu’s strength just now was so terrifying that they couldn’t believe he was so young.

All of them thought that Lin Xiu merely looked young and his real age was definitely not that young.

“You can call me classmate.”

Lin Xiu glanced at them, the corners of his mouth curled up and said.

Classmate?!

Lin Lang and the others were taken aback when they heard Lin Xiu’s words and it took a while before they reacted.

“You are also from the Sacred Region Academy!?”

A man said excitedly at this time.

What could be more exciting than meeting your classmate and this classmate actually saved them just now.

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu nodded.

“My name is Lin Lang, how should we address you?” Lin Lang had a surprised look on his face at this time, then said to Lin Xiu.

“Lin Xiu.” Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

When these people heard Lin Xiu’s name, they immediately started thinking, but no matter how hard they thought, they never found the name ‘Lin Xiu’ familiar.

Could it be a hidden expert in the academy?

They never thought that Lin Xiu would be a freshman.

“We just entered the second year of high school and came out to practice. We didn’t expect to encounter such a thing.” Lin Lang relaxed at this time, then said a little depressedly.

“When you go out, danger is inevitable.” Lin Xiu nodded.

“Yeah, it’s fortunate that I met Classmate Lin.” Lin Lang and the others also said happily at this time.

Lin Xiu smiled, then stretched out his hand to face Lin Lang.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s actions, Lin Lang was taken aback for a moment, as if he didn’t know what to do.

“The rank 8 odd crystal, give it to me.”

At this time, Lin Lang and the others were dumbfounded. What happened to being peers?
