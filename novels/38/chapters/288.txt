Chapter 289: Killing A Rank 6 Warrior!

Boom——

Just as Lin Xiu’s spear was pierced out, the smoke that turned into a huge black dragon opened its mouth and bit the man’s body!

“Get lost!”

Holding the long sword in his hand, the man was about to sever the black dragon rushing over in half.

But at this time, the black dragon had already opened his mouth and bit his weapon hard.

Damn it!!!

The man’s eyes were filled with fright. This weird and powerful skill sent a chill down his back.

The huge black dragon not only bit the weapon in his hand into two but it was also about to swallow him whole!

Horrorifying, it was horrifying!

“Go to hell!” Lin Xiu snorted coldly. As the black dragon attacked, the spear in his hand also thrust out towards the man!

“Go away!” The man saw the tip of the spear that was about to stab him in the body. He yelled loudly and the ‘Sphere’ unfolded again!

Bang–

The spear tip pierced his unfolded ‘Sphere’.

This ‘Sphere’ was like a light blue barrier, enclosing his entire body.

“Hahaha! You have no way of destroying my ‘Sphere’, it is impossible for you to kill me!”

The man saw that Lin Xiu’s spear had no way of piercing the ‘Sphere’ and he laughed loudly.

But at this moment, the black dragon has rushed towards his ‘Sphere’ again!

Bang bang bang——

The ‘Sphere’ he unfolded was producing some ripples at this moment.

When the man saw this scene, his expression changed slightly.

But soon, he heaved a sigh of relief. It was impossible. No matter how strong his skill was, it was impossible to destroy his ‘Sphere’!

He was confident in himself!

“Hng!” Lin Xiu looked at this scene with a cold expression in his eyes. The ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’ skill relied on his powerful source strength to produce a powerful black dragon, but very quickly, this black dragon would disappear as his source strength disappears.

At this moment, he had to destroy the ‘Sphere’ and kill him!

With that thought, the movement in Lin Xiu’s hand did not stop and he continued to attack the ‘Sphere’!

‘Profound intent·Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!

Lin Xiu stabbed the Dark Edge spear violently!

Bang bang bang——

The man in the ‘Sphere’ was shocked when he saw this scene. What’s going on, how could Lin Xiu suddenly become so crazy!?

In this short second, Lin Xiu didn’t know how many times he thrust his spear out.

All the man saw were spear shadows and he couldn’t see the movements of Lin Xiu’s shots clearly.

And what was even more terrifying was that the black dragon followed Lin Xiu’s movements and attacked the ‘Sphere’ that the man unfolded as well.

The ‘Sphere’ he unfolded at this time kept rippling and shaking constantly because of Lin Xiu’s attack.

It seemed extremely unstable.

Now he had started to regret a little. If he hadn’t tried to snatch Lin Xiu’s Odd crystal, everything would have been fine.

‘Damn, this guy is so young, why is he so strong?!’

‘Did he start cultivating from the womb?’

“Break… now!!!”

As Lin Xiu thrust out with the last shot, a loud sound rang out and the ‘Sphere’ was directly destroyed!

Pu——

As the ‘Sphere was destroyed, the pupils in the man’s eyes ?onstricted and he felt a tightness in his chest, sweetness in his throat and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

Clang clang clang——

Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear kept clanging and the moment he broke the man’s ‘Sphere’, he continued to aim for the man’s head without stopping his movements.

Lin Xiu wanted to stab his head directly.

As the man’s ‘Sphere’ was now broken by Lin Xiu, it was as if he got bitten hard back and felt extremely uncomfortable.

But seeing that Lin Xiu seemed like he wanted to pierce through his head directly, he still quickly reacted and was about to block with the long sword in his right hand!

Dang–

The tip of the Dark Edge spear directly hit his sword. At this moment, the man’s eyes widened.

Because he could clearly feel the power of Lin Xiu’s attack and it was really terrifying.

That huge force was directly transmitted to his hand at this time and he felt his hand go numb. In the next moment, the long sword that he was holding tightly was knocked out directly!

Lin Xiu saw this scene, his gaze changed, knowing that it was time to kill the man. Without any hesitation, he displayed the ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ again.

“‘Sphere’!!!” The man felt that the hairs all over his body were on its ends and he roared loudly.

The source strength in his whole body burst out at this moment as he tried to unfold the ‘Sphere’ again to block against Lin Xiu’s attack.

But at this time, the Sphere he unfolded had already been broken by Lin Xiu once and now it became very weak.

Bang bang bang——

The spearhead of the Dark Edge spear stabbed his ‘Sphere’ wildly.

This weak ‘Sphere’ was broken by Lin Xiu with just a few stabs.

At the next moment, the spear pierced through the man’s body. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

There were loud blasts that sounded continuously and within a few seconds, Lin Xiu pierced dozens of holes in his body.

It was as if he was being penetrated by a big bullet.

“How can I… possibly… be killed by a rank 5 warrior…”

He spoke slowly and his eyes widened. In the next moment, he fell directly on the ground.

His eyes were not closed like he died with a grievance.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master on killing a rank 6 warrior and gaining 50 million experience!”

When Lin Xiu killed the man, he heard the system prompt in his mind that he had gained experience and was stunned.

How could it be so little!?

He worked so hard to kill this guy and he was only worth 50 million experience!

Just as Lin Xiu was cursing the system for cheating him, he saw a cold light flashing from behind him.

Lin Xiu didn’t turn his head back and the spear in his hand directly blocked the attack at this moment.

He didn’t even have to think to know that it must be the subordinate of the man who was killed by him.

Dang–

As the spear collided with the man’s weapon, a metal collision sound rang out.

“You actually think that you can kill me!?”
