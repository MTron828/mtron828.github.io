Chapter 732 Warrior Forum

Lin Xiu looked at his photo.

It was when it was on the snow, according to the approximate distance of the person taking the picture in this photo.

It should be that guy Huangji.

And besides him, Lin Xiu couldn’t think of anyone who would do this to him.

“This old guy…”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and there was a faint killing intent in his eyes.

Because of what just happened, the security of this hotel has become even more strictly guarded.

For a while, it seemed that no one would dare to come.

After all, this Ice and Snow Hotel is the best hotel in Ice and Snow City and the forces behind it were also very strong.

bang bang bang

At this moment, Lin Xiu heard the door of his room being knocked again.

“Come in.”

Lin Xiu released his consciousness and he could easily sense the strength of the people outside the door.

Judging by strength, you can probably know who it is.

As the door opened, at this moment, Qian Jin walked in.

“I just heard that someone assassinated you?”

Qian Jin walked in and said to Lin Xiu.

“Well, you are quite well informed.”

After Lin Xiu closed the information he had just checked, he said to Qian Jin who walked in.

“Do you know that you are being discussed in the warrior forum in Ice and Snow City right now?”

Qian Jin said helplessly.

“Discuss me? What about me?”

Lin Xiu seemed very puzzled.

“Someone said that you obtained the Purple Gold Skill Card in the legacy land and also attached your photo.”

Qian Jin said in a low voice. “Really?”

Lin Xiu deliberately showed a surprised look.

“You’re the target of many people now.”

Qian Jin said.

“Whatever, I just don’t go out of this hotel then.”

Lin Xiu spread his hands and said.

“Okay, I’m going to rest, do you have anything else to do?”

Qian Jin looked at Lin Xiu speechless for a while, as if Lin Xiu still didn’t understand the importance of the matter.

After being targeted this time, Lin Xiu’s situation was very dangerous. After all, the Purple gold Skill Card was too attractive.

“Be careful, I don’t want you to be killed before we fight.”

As Qian Jin said, he looked helplessly at Lin Xiu, who seemed to be disapproving, then

left.

“This guy…”

As soon as Qian Jin left, Lin Xiu’s eyes became sharp.

Looking at the time, it’s still early.

Lin Xiu, who had waited for some time in this room, took out a strange silver mask from his arms when night fell completely.

This was a prop he won by lottery.

‘Silver Moon’: After wearing this mask, you can increase your physique by dozens of points and have a concealment effect.

With the original ‘Disguise’ skill, the current Lin Xiu’s aura was completely hidden.

After opening the window, Lin Xiu looked at the scene below and in the next moment, he jumped and flew straight down from here!

“That kid really has a Purple gold Skill Card on him?”

At the same time, in a room on the other side, a middle-aged man frowned and said to Huangji.

Huangji took a sip of tea from the teacup in front of him and nodded.

“Look.”

At this time, he took out the Purple Gold Skill Card from his arms.

Looking at the purple gold skill card that Huangji took out, the eyes of the middle-aged man sparkled.

The Purple gold skill card is a very cherished skills card. Even if it is sold, it can be sold for a lot of money.

“I was not the only one who got the Purple Gold Skill Card there, that kid got three.” Huangji pointed to the photo of Lin Xiu on the projection screen next to him and said aloud.

Hearing Huangji’s words, these people’s eyes showed a fiery look.

A Purple Gold Skill Card was very impressive and to get three cards, this was an explosion of luck.

“I didn’t expect that there are so many good things in the legacy land.”

These people secretly swallowed and said.

Now they all regret not going to the Legacy land. If they got a purple-gold skill card, it would be very, very impressive.

“This kid is from earth and his strength is only rank 9.” Huangji glanced at them, then said lightly.

“Mr. Huang, you’re saying…”

The middle-aged man was excited at this time, then said to Huangji. “His life or death has nothing to do with me.”

Huangji said lightly.

“Understood.”

The middle-aged man showed a strange look, then nodded.

After thinking about it for a while, he continued to say:

“Is he in the hotel now?”

“That’s right, 711 on the seventh floor.” Huangji nodded.

“But because some idiots went to him today, he killed them and now he has changed rooms.”

“And the security of the hotel seems to have been strengthened a lot.”

After hearing Huangji’s words, the middle-aged man also frowned.

“If that’s the case, there’s nothing we can do…”

The security of the Ice and Snow Hotel was notoriously strict and after what happened, the current security was expected to be tighter. If you want to go to Lin Xiu’s room to snatch the Purple gold Skill Card, people would find out easily. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Don’t worry, I’ll call him out later.”

Huangji put down the teacup in his hand and said lightly.

“Mr. Huang, do you have an idea?”

When the middle-aged man heard Huangji’s words, a look of joy appeared on his cheeks.

If it was outside, as long as Lin Xiu showed up, he would be dead!

“This is a communicator specially assigned to each of them after they have qualified for the promotion.”

Huangji took out a miniature mobile phone-like item from his pocket.

“I’ll send him a message and tell him that he needs to gather here.”

When Huangji said this, a vicious look appeared on his face.

“I’ve sent a message to let him be outside, you can go out now.”

Huangji said aloud after pressing the mini communicator in his hand.

“Okay! After we get the skills card, we will definitely thank you.”

The middle-aged man thanked Huangji.

The other men also stood up and when they were about to open the door at the back, they saw their men outside the door, all of them in a pool of blood.

“What happened!”

Behind this was the courtyard, this area was theirs and someone unexpectedly killed all of their people!?

The middle-aged man’s eyes looked ahead and he saw a person wearing a mask!
