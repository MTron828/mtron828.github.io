1185 The Powerful Baili Haoling

Baili Haoling’s eyes were opened wide when she saw that it was Lin Xiu.

She couldn’t believe that he would be here.

“Why are you here?”

“I didn’t think that you would be here as well.”

!!

Lin Xiu smiled as he spoke to Baili Haoling.

It was a rare opportunity that he got to meet someone that he knew. Plus, it was Baili Haoling of all people which made him feel even happier. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“How could you be so ill mannered? You didn’t even greet your master when you met her!”

Baili Haoling playfully glared at Lin Xiu while there was also a huge smile on her face.

“I think….it’s better for you to concentrate on that guy first.”

Lin Xiu pointed at the muscular man who was standing opposite her.

“Of course I would.”

Baili Haoling’s voice turned cold.

She stared at Grey Bear who was standing opposite her. Her eyes that were initially pitch black suddenly turned red.

The longswords that were in her hands started shaking as well.

It wasn’t because of fear. It was because there was a large surge of energy that entered the longswords that caused her hands to shake.

When Lin Xiu saw the change happening to her, he was surprised as well.

As soon as her eyes turned red, it seemed like her strength would increase tremendously.

The increase in her strength seemed to be more than when he uses ‘Rage’.

After checking with the analytical eyes, Lin Xiu noticed that Baili Haoling was only a sage warrior but now, she has already leveraged herself to become a warrior god.

Her abilities now were about the same as Grey Bear.

“You were being arrogant the whole time. It’s my time now.”

Baili Haoling smiled. Then, she bent her body forward, ready to charge at the man opposite her.

“Hehe, little girl….you will be dying very soon!!”

Grey Bear started laughing on top of his lungs.

With both his hands on the huge axe, he dashed forward to Baili Haoling.

Xiu – –

Suddenly, Baili Haoling moved and she disappeared.

Grey Bear missed his target!

Where did she go?

Grey Bear’s pupil shivered.

He didn’t expect for the young girl to suddenly disappear into thin air.

However, his reflexes were quick as well. He immediately sensed that there was something behind him. He grabbed onto his axe and placed it behind his head.

Clang clang – –

Baili Haoling suddenly appeared behind him and was attacking him with both the longswords.

“Useless tricks!”

Seeing how his axe managed to block her attacks, Grey Bear screamed in excitement.

Baili Haoling ignored his comment. Then, she continued her attacks with both her longswords.

Clang clang clang – –

The impact that came with each attack was horrifying.

Grey Bear was only trying his best to defend against Baili Haoling’s attack with his huge axe.

Damn it!

He had a bad feeling about it. The young girl that he has been winning against suddenly became so strong!

Each attack brought along a terrifying amount of energy and he didn’t have the chance to retaliate.

He could only tighten his grip on the axe and continue defending himself.

“I didn’t think that you would know each other.”

Mr Lui said to Lin Xiu.

“But, I shall give you a friendly reminder. Your friend would be dying in the hands of Grey Bear.”

Mr Lui looked at Grey Bear who seemed to be in a bad state now but he knew how powerful that man can be.

Grey Bear has had a winning streak.

There are countless warriors who have died under his axe.

“You mean that guy?”

Lin Xiu asked calmly as well.

“He won a lot of matches?”

“He never lost.”

Mr Lui had a gentle smile on his face as well.

“Well, that’s a shame. He will be dead soon.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“The Wrathful Strike!”

Grey Bear shouted on top of his lungs. He held onto the sword with both hands and the energy that was released from his body caused Baili Haoling to be thrown far into the distance. He also swung the huge axe that was in his hands.

The energy that was covering his axe was incredibly powerful.

There was a huge figure of an axe that suddenly appeared and it was headed for Baili Haoling!

Boom …

Suddenly, there was a huge explosion that was heard.

The entire place was covered with dust.

However, there was an energy barrier around the ring. No matter how powerful the warriors skills may be, it will never affect the audience.

“They even broke the energy barrier…”

Some of the warriors who were watching the match felt frightened.

This energy barrier was installed so that some of the powerful warrior skills that were used by the warriors would not affect the audiences who were watching the match.

The energy barrier was tough and not all warrior skills would be able to break it.

The skill that Grey Bear had released was a saint level warrior skill.

It definitely wasn’t a warrior god skill.

“We have a winner now.”

Mr Lui looked at the ring that was covered in dust and a smile appeared on his face.

“You’re right.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

As the dust dissipated, Grey Bear’s figure was the first one to be seen by the audience.

“He won.”

Mr Lui nodded his head in satisfaction.

“This…..is impossible.”

Grey Bear’s eyes were opened wide and it was filled with disbelief.

He was still talking when there were large amounts of cuts that appeared all over his body.

Then, blood started spurting everywhere.

The huge body immediately fell onto the ground.

Baili Haoling slowly appeared as well.

Both her longswords were covered in bright-red blood.

Her eyes that were bright red before had slowly recovered to its normal state.

“I won.”

Baili Haoling held onto her longswords and swept off the blood that was found on it. Then, she returned them to its sheath.

Mr Lui’s face looked as if he had swallowed a fly. He couldn’t believe what had happened.

“Grey Bear…..he’s dead?!”

The rest of the warriors gasped in shock as well.

This was because Grey Bear was a frequent here and he has never lost.

However, he just died in the hands of a young girl and this was shocking to them.

“Give Rollie back to me!”

Baili Haoling turned and glared at Mr Lui.

“Anyone else would like to challenge her?”

Mr Lui’s eyes turned solemn as he looked around.

The rest of the warriors took one step backwards when they saw Mr Lui scanning the room.

Grey Bear was dead now! They wouldn’t want to get themselves killed!
