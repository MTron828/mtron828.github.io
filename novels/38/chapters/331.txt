Chapter 332: One Year Ago

Luo Yue shook her head then stood up again, her eyes looked in the distance and said, “She’s not dead yet.”

Lin Xiu heard Luo Yue’s words and looked ahead as well. He immediately saw Zhang Jie, who was sent flying by him, appearing to get up again at this moment.

“Darn it…” She looked very sinister at this moment and there seemed to be cracks on her skin because of the weird white flames released by Luo Yue.

Click, click, click——

As the crisp sounds rang out, her skin seemed to be falling off.

As the skin on her arm came off, they could see that her arm was made up of many mechanical things and they were glowing with dark red light.

This person is really a cyborg!?

Lin Xiu looked at this scene and was surprised.

He has been in this world for a while and it was the first time he saw a cyborg that used to only exist in the world of science fiction.

“Seems like you absorbed the power of the ice lotus fire? I didn’t expect you to find it…” Zhang Jie’s voice now became a little weird. She looked at Luo Yue and spoke as she made her way over.

“You turned into a cyborg.” Luo Yue looked at Zhang Jie, who was now approaching her, without any fear and looked at her indifferently.

“Yes! If you hadn’t cut off my arm, I wouldn’t have to become this way!!!” It was as if her tail got stepped on when she heard Luo Yue’s words and her whole face changed. It got uglier.

Her arm was cut off by Luo Yue?

“A year ago, she wanted to snatch my Odd crystal and her arm got cut off by me.” Luo Yue seemed to notice the puzzled look on Lin Xiu’s face and explained.

Lin Xiu nodded, hesitated for a moment then said, “She said that your warrior rank decreased?”

Lin Xiu had indeed heard her say that Luo Yue’s strength had not been restored.

“En, I was plotted against by someone and the injury didn’t heal.” Luo Yue nodded and said faintly.

And as soon as she spoke, Zhang Jie had already rushed over again!

Swish swish–

As she rushed over, the two rings from before spun in the air once again, then charged towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu’s expression changed.

Why is this darn thing spinning again?

Could it be that these things are also controlled by machines…?

With that thought, Lin Xiu gripped the spear in his hand tightly and waved it hard, releasing many phoenixes towards these spinning rings!

Boom——

The targets of these phoenixes were the spinning rings.

The phoenixes seemed to be able to track as they followed the rings and charged towards them.

Swish swish–

But very quickly, the rapidly spinning rings hit Lin Xiu.

However, Lin Xiu reacted very swiftly. He moved slightly and managed to dodge, then he released another flaming bird and sent it towards the rings!

As the scorching flames continued to hit these rings, their speed began to slow down.

At the next moment, with a resounding ‘bang’, these rings suddenly burst then fell directly to the ground.

He was right!

These double rings were not simple weapons but had something like an electronic machine built into it. Through the control of Zhang Jie’s source strength, it can continuously spin and attack.

But now, it seemed that this thing cannot withstand such a high temperature and had been completely scrapped.

Dang–

At the same time, Zhang Jie had rushed over to Luo Yue and was attacking her wildly with her daggers.

She was so fast, so fast that Lin Xiu’s eyes couldn’t even keep up with her movements.

“Hng! I’ll see how long you can block my attacks!” Zhang Jie saw Luo Yue constantly waving the long sword in her hand and her face became even more hideous.

Now Luo Yue could clearly see that Zhang Jie’s right arm had no flesh and blood, it was completely like a robotic arm.

And her arm was obviously very strong.

Boom——

Luo Yue seized the opportunity when blocking Zhang Jie’s attack and her long sword in her right hand burst out with the white flames from before. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

When these flames appeared, the temperature in the surrounding air dropped.

“This is the power you gained from absorbing the ice lotus fire?” Zhang Jie said in a sinister tone as her dagger slashed Luo Yue’s long sword and she looked at the white flames bursting from the long sword.

Zhang Jie’s body seemed to be affected due to these white flames appearing and her speed slowed down slightly.

Although Luo Yue has always been on the defense, she was also waiting for an opportunity to strike. At this moment, Zhang Jie’s movements truly slowed down.

Swish——

Zhang Jie slashed again but she missed!

Good chance!

Luo Yue held the long sword that was already covered in white flames and stabbed Zhang Jie directly!

Bang–

With a dull sound, Luo Yue’s long sword pierced through Zhang Jie’s chest directly!

The sharp tip of the long sword actually only pierced her body a little and could not go in any further.

What’s even more terrifying was that the long sword was now stuck in her body and there was no way of pulling it out.

“Do you think that your flames really affected me?” Zhang Jie smirked and revealed a sly look.

“I am not a robot, I wouldn’t slow down just because of the coldness.”

Luo Yue stabbed the dagger towards Luo Yue as she spoke!

“Luo Yue!” Although Lin Xiu had realized that something was wrong and wanted to rush over there, it was too late!

Zhang Jie’s dagger had penetrated Luo Yue’s body.
