Chapter 560: Back To The Academy

Boom Boom Boom – –

As both of their weapons clashed, it let out loud noises of explosion.

The lightning on both of their weapons collided with each other.

What’s happening?!

As the lightning from Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge Spear traveled towards him, he could feel a sense of numbness all over his body. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

There was also a sharp pain that accompanied the numbness that was felt.

For Lin Xiu, it was as if those lightning didn’t have any effect on him.

Instead, his attack grew to become even stronger.

“Goodbye.” Lin Xiu waved his spear and continued piercing it forward.

At that moment, there was a large amount of thick, black smoke that appeared from the Dark Edge. The smoke gathered together and turned into a huge, black dragon that rushed towards Lei Jun’s body!

‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks The City’!

Lei Jun’s pupils shrank uncontrollably. He lifted up both his hands and placed them in front of his body, hoping to block the attack.

However, as the black dragon opened his mouth, he bit onto Lei Jun’s body!

Lei Jun struggled, trying to escape from the dragon’s mouth but he soon noticed that he no longer had the energy to do so.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu swung his Dark Edge across the air and threw Lei Jun’s body into the distance. Lei Jun’s body then landed on the huge stone pillar that wrote ‘Thunder Valley’ and it let out a loud sound.

Lei Jun was completely embedded onto the stone pillar and there were also large amounts of stones that fell onto the ground because of the impact.

As for the Twin Warhammer that he had in his arm, it had now been dropped heavily onto the ground.

Pfft– –

Lei Jun stared at Lin Xiu with his wide eyes as he spat out a mouthful of blood.

He had completely ignored the pain that could be felt all over his body as his eyes were locked onto Lin Xiu. His eyes were filled with shock and disbelief.

Just a while ago, he had completely lost all the abilities to fight and was defeated by Lin Xiu.

One would only be able to feel the difference between them once they have personally fought with Lin Xiu.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu said towards Lin Lang and his group of friends who were also in shock.

“Sure… sure.”

When they heard Lin Xiu talking to them, they finally came back to their senses.

Lin Xiu’s performance just now was incredibly terrifying.

As for those from the Thunder Corp noticed that Lin Xiu was about to leave but this time, none of them dared to stop him. They moved the sides instead, giving him space to walk.

Their leader, Lei Jun, had been defeated by Lin Xiu within seconds. Who would have the guts to actually fight Lin Xiu now?

“You… Who are you?!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was leading a group of them that included Lin Lang and was leaving Thunder valley, Lei Jun asked him the question.

“A student… from Sacred Region Academy.”

Lin Xiu answered bluntly and left without even turning back.

“Captain!”

Some of the men from the Thunder Corp finally came back to their senses and immediately gathered around their captain, Lei Jun.

“Don’t go after him.” Lei Jun looked at his men and commanded them.

After fighting with Lin Xiu, he knew that not only himself, even the entire corp fought with him simultaneously, they wouldn’t be able to fight him.

The differences between their abilities were way too much than they had expected.

“Sacred Region Academy…..what is that?” Lei Jun suddenly thought of what Lin Xiu said and his eyes were filled with confusion.

As Lin Lang and his gang continued walking with Lin Xiu, Lin Lang let out a breath of relief.

“Senior Lin, thank you so much.” Lin Lang and his friends thanked Lin Xiu respectfully.

Lin Xiu was stunned as he was humored by their actions. Did they really take him as a senior student?

“Just call me Lin Xiu. I’m just a first-year student.” Lin Xiu replied.

First-year student?

How is that possible?!

None of them believed what Lin Xiu said and thought that Lin Xiu was just acting humble.

“Senior Lin, where are you headed to now?” One of them asked Lin Xiu.

Seeing how they were still persistent that he was a senior student, Lin Xiu found it hilarious and did not bother changing them.

“Back to campus.” Lin Xiu thought about it before answering them.

In his original plan, he was supposed to take a look at Area E99 but since Luo Yue had already left, he felt a little down and had already lost interest in that area. Plus, the audition for the World Warrior Competition was about to start and it was about time for him to head back.

“That’s right, the World Warrior Competition is about to start. We should head back to witness it as well.”

Lin Lang suddenly clapped as if he was reminded of something.

“Right! It is one of the biggest competitions that is held every 5 years!”

The rest of them started getting excited as well.

“Let’s head back together then.” Lin Xiu smiled and said.

As for the rest of the journey, it was smooth sailing and nothing special happened.

After a few days, Lin Xiu and the rest of them finally returned to the Sacred Region Academy with their designated aircraft that was prepared by the academy.

“Finally back here!”

As soon as Lin Lang got off the plane and felt the sea breeze blowing at his face, he stretched his back and screamed out loud.

Lin Xiu walked out of the aircraft as well. It was supposed to be a happy thing that he has finally returned to campus but as he thought of how Luo Yue, who left with him, had not returned with him, he suddenly felt a little sad.

He looked at the jade that was huge around his neck and grabbed it with his right hand as if he was holding Luo Yue’s hand. It gave Lin Xiu a little warmth.

“Senior Lin?”

Just when Lin Xiu was deep in thought, he heard someone calling him.

“What’s wrong?”

Lin Xie saw that it was Lin Lang who stood in front of him.

“Thank you so much.”

“Thank you!”

Lin Lang and his friends thanked Lin Xiu with gratitude.

Not only because Lin Xiu had saved their lives, but their journey back home was also extremely safe because of him as well. They were only able to come back so smoothly because of Lin Xiu.

“It’s just a small matter. You don’t have to thank me.” Lin Xiu shook his head.

“I’ll be heading back first. You guys should head back as well.”

Lin Lang and his friends nodded their heads and bade goodbye to Lin Xiu.

“Eh? How did you end up with him on your way back?”

Then, as Lin Lang and the rest of them walked back into campus, a student from the Sacred Region Academy walked towards them while asking the question.

“Yang Cheng, you know him?” When Lin Lang heard the question, he got curious.

As for the rest of them, they were curious as well. With Lin Xiu’s abilities, he should be a famous person in the academy but they have never heard of his name during their stays in the Sacred Region Academy.

“Of course. He’s the famous first-year student.” Yang Cheng nodded his head.

Due to the events that have happened before, almost everyone on the campus knew who Lin Xiu was.

“First-year? He’s a first-year student?!”

Lin Lang and his gang were all stunned..
