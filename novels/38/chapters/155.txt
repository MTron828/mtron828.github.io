Chapter 156: No, you’re too weak

Everyone’s eyes lit up when they heard Nan Zhengjun’s words.

The five strongest warriors would be picked to participate in the freshmen assembly!

If they performed well, it would be a chance to shine!

Everyone started their own training after Nan Zhengjun’s departure.

There were all sorts of weapons and training equipment.

There were many weapons on both sides of the training grounds of all sorts, but they were unsharpened.

They were only heavy, extremely heavy. For example, There were spears there that started from 100kg to 2000kg!

Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge was about 800kg.

He took the 1000kg spear and started brandishing it around.

Although it was slightly heavy, it was not a problem for him.

“Last name Lin, why don’t we spar?” right at this time, the big fool that provoked Lin Xiu previously took out a large machete and walked to Lin Xiu.

A few freshmen walked behind him, they were obviously unhappy that Lin Xiu was the class monitor.

“Li Ping, what’s the meaning of this!” Zhang Yin and the others walked over as well as they glared at the big fool.

He had been causing disturbance right from the beginning and made them unhappy.

“I just want to spar with ‘class monitor’ here, or is he afraid?” Li Ping laughed and said.

Although Lin Xiu had destroyed the strength test machine with one punch the day before, Li Ping felt that Lin Xiu used a trick after pondering about it.

Otherwise, how can the strength test machine be destroyed with one punch?

And he sensed that Lin Xiu’s warrior aura was weak and should be an ordinary rank 3 warrior. But he was close to being rank 4!

How could he accept an ordinary rank 3 to be the class monitor!

All the students spectating at the side turned to look at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was handsome and had a temperament that was neither obsequious nor supercilious, making the girls in the class to have a good feeling towards him.

“I won’t spar with you.” Lin Xiu shook his head.

“Are you afraid?” Upon hearing Lin Xiu speak up, Li Ping and the others behind him laughed.

Zhang Yin and his group clenched their fists, they were unhappy seeing how happy Li Ping was.

“No, you’re too weak.”

Lin Xiu replied indifferently when Li Ping closed his mouth.

“Seeking death!” Li Ping was infuriated when he heard Lin Xiu’s arrogant reply.

“Come at me, all of you together.” Lin Xiu held the 1000kg spear in his right hand and used it to point at the aggressive group in front of him.

Although Lin Xiu looked young, his aura that felt as though he was looking down on the world swayed the hearts of many of his female classmates.

Li Ping was already angry and brandished his machete with lightning speed and slashed at Lin Xiu!

Clang clang clang-

His machete clashed with Lin Xiu’s spear and produced loud metal sounds.

The weapons in the training room were all dulled down, but when the collision strength was at such a degree, getting hit would still result in serious injuries!

“Too slow.” Lin Xiu waved the silver spear while commenting indifferently.

“Seeking death!” Li Ping became even more furious at Lin Xiu’s words. He used all of his strength and charged forward!

But the silver spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was like a white dragon. It turned into specks of cold light that stabbed at Li Ping.

Li Ping was taken aback and immediately used the machete’s body to block.

Clang clang clang-

The speartip produced many stabs and struck onto the machete’s body.

Li Ping felt a giant burst of force and his hands immediately turned numb. In the next instant, his hand was no longer able to grip the machetes and they flew out!

Everyone exclaimed in shock at this.

Everyone from the side watched the machete fall. When they inspected the machete, they realised that there were many dents in the weapon, all of which were the result of Lin Xiu’s attacks!

Everyone became even more shocked at that. It was too terrifying.

“Brother Ping!” The other guys checked to see if Li Ping was injured, then immediately charged forward and surrounded Lin Xiu!

All that entered Sacred Region Academy could be considered arrogant people. They were unhappy at the sight of this.

“Shameless!” The other students cursed when they witnessed that.

They immediately thought of helping Lin Xiu to handle them.

“Don’t need to come over.” Lin Xiu spoke up indifferently.

After unlocking rank 1 gene lock and absorbing the energy of a rank 6 odd crystal to improve his body, Lin Xiu was already a peak existence in the realm of rank 3 and he did not fear anyone of them.

It was time for him to establish his name as a class monitor.

He snorted at the sight of the incoming men. He fought them without utilising any skills and only using the simplest spear arts!

The spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was 1000kg, adding the force produced by swinging the spear, all of their weapons immediately flew out of their hands when struck!

Serial Kick!

Once their weapons were out of their hands, Lin Xiu produced a series of kicks and sent them flying!

“Convinced?”

He did not deal any fatal strikes since they were all in the same class. He only wanted to teach them a lesson. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Li Ping looked at Lin Xiu with clenched fists. After taking a deep breath, he walked over.

Right when everyone thought that Li Ping wanted to retaliate, he bowed towards Lin Xiu, “Sorry, class monitor.”

All of the spectators that thought he wanted to fight heaved a sigh of relief when they heard his words.

Lin Xiu nodded his head and glanced at the others. This time, no one had any ill intentions in their eyes.

“Do you know we were placed in Class 10?” Lin Xiu spoke up indifferently.

“Why?” Jiang Li immediately replied when he heard Lin Xiu’s question.

The others had roughly guessed it.

“Because we have the weakest combat ability out of the 10 classes.” Lin Xiu continued.

“If you guys don’t want to lose face at the freshmen assembly, train yourselves well. Those who are unhappy with me are welcome to beat me down.” Lin Xiu looked at all the guys that were struck by him and said.

These students were already afraid of Lin Xiu. He was able to beat them 1 against many and they did not have the ability to even retaliate!

How could they dare to provoke him again?!
