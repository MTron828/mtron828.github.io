1142 Attacking the Holy City!

The glow that came from the body of the Angel was getting even sharper.

It looked like….as if the Angel was absorbing the energy from the odd crystal?!

Lin Xiu stared at the Angel and his eyes were filled with surprise as well.

“Wang Qiang, head back with her then.”

Lin Xiu turned towards Wang Qiang before getting them to leave.

“Alright.”

Wang Qiang nodded his head and then sat on the shoulders of the Angel.

Boom boom – –

With the control of Lin Xiu’s mind, the Angel then flew across the sky.

They were headed towards Bai Di City.

Seeing how the Angel had already left, Lin Xiu then turned back to the Divine Domain Mansion.

Wu Hao was still instructing the architects and the warriors on repairing the Divine Domain.

The Bai family has been completely annihilated this time and most likely there wouldn’t be anyone else who would be sent here for the time being.

Lin Xiu was in one of the rooms, practising on the ‘Time Control’.

Soon, one week has passed.

For the entire week, the Bai family from the Holy City was completely quiet.

They did not launch any attacks.

As for Zhao Yongyuan, Sima Qiang and Ye Kai, they have already contacted all of the allies of the Ye family and were getting rid of all the warriors belonging to the Bai family.

This attack felt as if there was a huge earthquake that happened on Nano Planet.

This became headlines for most of the warriors on Nano Planet.

Lin Xiu did not name his forces as the ‘Ye family’. This was because Lin XIu, himself, isn’t truly from the Ye family.

He was only getting revenge for them.

Lin Xiu then named his forces as ‘Hua Xia’.

Bai Di City was then renamed as Hua Xia City and Lin Xiu was the owner of it.

This was his way of remembering the country that he was from before the transmigration.

Time passed and one day, there was a large number of warriors that were gathered together.

“Young master, we should be at Holy City very soon.”

Ye Kai stood by Lin Xiu’s side and reported to him about their latest status.

Ye Kai was looking excited as well.

With how they have been working, other than the Bai family left in Holy City, the rest of the Bai family has been completely annihilated.

Plus, with the help of the vast amount of odd crystals that Lin Xiu had given them, Lin Xiu was able to grow hundreds of sage warriors within the shortest period of time!

Ye Kai was now a sage warrior as well.

The others like Zhao Yongyuan, Sima Qiang, Wang Qiang and Qu Hao were here as well.

They had a large number of warriors with them.

“En. This is the final battle.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head. He looked far into the distance as he mumbled to himself.

There should be quite a lot of sage warriors in the Bai family.

Once he killed all of them, he should be able to reach level 70 and become a warrior god.

By then...

As he thought of Luo Yue, Lin Xiu clenched onto his fist and he was feeling anxious.

He should be able to meet her once he got to the warrior god realm.

“Attack!!”

Lin Xiu waved his right hand and his long spear appeared.

With Lin Xiu levitating in the air, he led the warriors towards the Holy City!

There was a huge group of warriors that followed behind him.

“Master! They’re here!”

At the same time, the core members of the Bai family were gathered together.

All of them had a bad feeling about this.

“Are you ready?”

Bai Qi looked at the rest of them before asking them.

“We’re ready.”

The Bai family, led by Bai Qi, nodded their heads.

There was also an artificial arm that had been installed on Bai Lin.

But, it looked similar to an actual one.

“Kill them all.”

Bai Qi demanded coldly.

There was a strong murderous intention in his eyes.

As he thought of what had happened recently, he was furious.

The teleportation device in Star City has been destroyed and they were not able to teleport themselves there with the teleportation array.

Plus, most of their warriors have been destroyed.

There were also lots of warriors who had left the Holy City.

The only ones remaining were the warriors of the Bai family.

This was because all the warriors knew that there would be a huge battle soon.

Everyone on the planet was paying attention to this battle. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

This battle would then decide who would take over the Nano Planet.

For now, Lin Xiu was the one who first entered the Holy City!

“Get him!!!”

Bai Lin was stationed at one of the towers and he shouted when he saw Lin Xiu.

When he thought of how Lin Xiu was the one who sliced off his right arm, he was filled with rage.

There was an overwhelming murderous intention in his eyes as well.

Boom boom – –

With that said, the entire Holy City that had been installed with laser cannons was shooting at Lin Xiu!

Lin XIiu already had his ‘sphere’ released.

These laser beams were nothing to Lin Xiu.

He grabbed onto his long spear and headed towards the ground.

Boom – –

Then, an energy barrier appeared and Lin Xiu couldn’t even enter the city.

“An energy barrier huh?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

The energy barrier completely surrounded the Holy City.

The strength of this barrier seemed to be much stronger than the ones that Wu Hao had built.

Boom boom boom – –

Lin Xiu, who was protected by his ‘sphere’, completely ignored the attacks from the cannons and started attacking the energy barrier instead.

Boom boom – –

With each loud collision, the entire energy barrier seemed to be moving.

“Damn it...”

Bai Lin’s pupil narrowed subconsciously when he saw what was happening.

Bai Qi, who was on the other side, stared at Lin Xiu who was attacking the energy barrier and he looked pissed.

He could clearly feel that Lin Xiu’s energy was much stronger than how they’ve met previously.

Damn it. If this continues, the entire Bai family would be over!

“I’ll head over to the cemetery first.”

Bai Qi turned around and left.

After hearing what Bai Qi said, the look in their eyes changed.

“I’m breaking…it!!!”

Lin Xiu, who was still in the air, gathered a large amount of energy onto his long spear.

Then, he held tightly onto it and then thrusted it onto the energy barrier once again and it was followed by a loud explosion.

Boom – –

The entire energy barrier started shaking vigorously.

Then, there were cracks that appeared all over it!

The energy barrier was about to explode!
