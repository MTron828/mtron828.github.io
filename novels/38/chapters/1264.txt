1265 Domains That Can’t Be Suppressed

The warriors of Changqing City not far away saw this scene, and their eyes widened.

Their city lord was actually blasted down from the sky by Lin Xiu!

On the ground below, Liu Mo, who had been blasted down, directly caused a bottomless pit.

There was also a lot of dust around.

Lin Xiu didn’t care whether Liu Mo was dead or not and rushed toward Baili Haoling at this moment.

Several God warriors are besieging Baili Haoling and she was obviously under great threat.

There were also many injuries on her arm.

“Go to hell!!!”

One of the warrior gods roared angrily, holding the saber in his hand, he was about to strike at Baili Haoling from behind!

Baili Haoling killed too many of his subordinates just now, filling him with incomparable killing intent.

boom–

But just when he was about to strike Baili Haoling’s body from behind with a saber in his hands, a bright light flashed over.

From the corner of his eye, he looked to the side and he clearly saw a fist full of light, smashing toward him!

‘Sphere’!

With a roar in his heart, he directly turned the offense into defense and unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

Boom——

The fist slammed into his unfolded ‘Sphere’ and a loud noise erupted immediately.

There were a lot of cracks in his ‘Sphere’.

His whole being was directly blasted to the building below by this powerful impact.

Poof——

The warrior’s body hit the building behind it and the ‘Sphere’ that had cracks in it broke immediately.

A mouthful of blood was spat out.

“Damn…damn…”

He opened his eyes wide, looking at Lin Xiu’s figure in the sky in disbelief.

He had no idea when Lin Xiu rushed over.

However, although the power of this punch was terrifying, it was impossible for it to kill a god warrior like him.

He was about to get up, but at this moment, his eyes clearly saw several lotus flames rushing toward him.

Three lotus fires of different colors.

These three lotus fires look small and they don’t seem to pose any threat to people at all.

He suddenly stretched out his hand wanting to slap the three lotus fires away.

But just when his hand was about to touch the three lotus flames, they seemed to gather together in an instant.

And something extremely terrifying happened.

Boom——

Following the sound of a huge explosion, there was a crisp sound in Lin Xiu’s mind.

This is the sound of the experience prompt for killing the god warrior.

Everything just happened in a flash.

At this time, Baili Haoling obviously realized that Lin Xiu was coming to support her and she frantically waved her two swords.

Lin Xiu also waved his fists and attacked these warriors.

While attacking, the divine soul power was also released.

At this moment, the little black dragon appeared.

As Lin Xiu swung his fist, it also attacked those warriors.

Bang bang bang——

Although those warriors spread out their ‘Spheres’, under the impact of the little black dragon, their ‘Spheres’ were all pierced and exploded.

And Lin Xiu also directly punched those warriors who didn’t have the ‘Sphere’ protection.

Under the state of ‘Fury’, Lin Xiu’s strength has improved so much that it is really terrifying.

Although these fighters are all at the level of God warriors, they are nothing to Lin Xiu.

Soon, under the attacks of Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling, all of these skilled fighters were killed.

On the other side, Rollie has already swung the shining giant hammer in its hand, directly hammering a large number of warriors to death.

The remaining warriors from Changqing City were already trembling and some of them fled away.

Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling’s strength was extremely terrifying and even the evolved beast was equally perverted.

They had no desire to fight at all.

“Is everything dealt with?”

After beheading the last warrior in the sky with the double swords held by Baili Haoling, she looked around.

No warrior dared to attack.

...

“Don’t think so.”

Lin Xiu shook his head, thinking of the man holding the Frosty Giant Sword.

This person hasn’t appeared yet.

“what!!!”

At this moment, a loud roar came from the other side.

This sound was too loud and extremely penetrating.

Both Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling felt their eardrums ache from the shock.

The entire Changqing City shook at this moment.

“Hm?”

When Lin Xiu heard the roar, he easily realized that it must be Liu Mo.

This guy attacking him crazily just now. Although he didn’t die, Lin Xiu also believed that his body must be paralyzed and unable to move.

...

That’s why he went to support Baili Haoling first.

But looking at it now, this guy seems to have retained some strength…

While Lin Xiu was thinking, a figure slowly rose up from the bottomless pit over there.

Lin Xiu took a closer look and it really was Liu Mo!

It’s just that Liu Mo was in pretty bad shape now.

Because of Lin Xiu’s attack just now, Liu Mo now has scars on his cheeks and blood at the corner of his mouth.

He has disheveled hair, but his whole body was surging with incomparably terrifying power.

Crackling——

There were a lot of lightning bolts around his body.

These lightning bolts were different from ordinary lightning bolts, they were actually black!

Black lightning?

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the look on his face changed slightly.

Liu Mo looked at Lin Xiu in the distance with both eyes and his eyes were filled with infinite killing intent.

With a wave of his right hand, at this moment, an incomparably terrifying force was directly transmitted.

As the power spread out, a huge array-like domain began to form in the sky.

Is it domain force?

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, with a thought, a white light also burst out from his body.

‘Purification domain’!

With a wave of Lin Xiu’s right hand, the domain force released by Lin Xiu directly covered Liu Mo’s domain!

Lin Xiu originally thought that it would be the same as his usual fights and it would be able to directly cover the opponent’s domain.

But at this time, Lin Xiu discovered that there was no way to cover Liu Mo’s domain!

Moreover, at this time, the force of his own domain also disappeared rapidly at a speed visible to the naked eye.

“Boy, you forced me!!!”

At this moment, Liu Mo roared angrily.

It can be seen now that this Liu Mo seems to have become older than before, with many wrinkles appearing on his skin.

But his strength has indeed been greatly improved!

This was completely beyond Lin Xiu’s expectations. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m
