Chapter 1063: A Client

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu had the ability to kill these warriors by just swinging his fist?!

Plus, he was doing it in such a bloody method.

“You…”

“I know great beings who own universe boat are not to be trifled with, but I am still unreconciled to the meat on the tip of my tongue. So I went forward to negotiate with the great beings in universe boat, and I even brought up my Ancient Yuan Star. Who would have thought that the other party did not care about my Ancient Yuan Star at all? He even directly asked me to get lost, and if I were to say one more word, he would kill all of us.” The sturdy old man clenched his hands tightly, in a low voice, he said, “No matter what, he is still snatching the meat from our mouths, yet he is still so overbearing, completely disregarding our Ancient Yuan Star. Of course, this makes me angry. I have been unable to swallow this anger, so naturally, I do not have the mood to continue hunting.”

“Is that so?” The silver-haired middle-aged man in the long robe nodded slightly, but then he smiled. “Why, are you not happy? Don’t tell me you want to drag out the great beings in universe boat and kill them?”

!!

The muscular old man was stunned, but then he shook his head. “I’m not stupid. How could I dare to attack him directly? Even if I’m angry, I can only endure it.”

“It’s good that you know.” The middle-aged man in the silver-haired robe laughed, “In the universe, to be able to own a universe boat is enough to show his identity and power. Unless we have absolute confidence to figure out his true power and means, we shouldn’t provoke such a person.”

“I know, but this person has been hiding in universe boat and hasn’t shown himself. There are arrays on universe boat that block my soul probing, so I can’t find out his true power, so I don’t dare to act Rashly. However, the more this is the case, the more unwilling I am to accept it. If the other party is really a powerful great being, and he shows himself, or shows a little godly power or aura, and it really scares me, then it’s fine for me to be reprimanded by him, but what if the person in universe boat isn’t a great being, and he’s just using universe boat to put on airs? Then I’ll become a joke,” said the sturdy old man.

In the universe, there were many people who relied on universe boat to put on airs.

Everyone knew that those who could own universe boat were all extraordinary, so naturally, very few people dared to provoke them.

However, the universe was so big that there were some weaker people who had obtained universe boat by chance.

In the Purple Micro Star Field alone, it had happened several times that the other party rode universe boat, but his own power was very ordinary. There was even a Principles Master who rode universe boat.

“Old man, do you think the person I met this time is a real great being, or is he just putting on an act with the help of universe boat?” Asked the muscular old man.

“I don’t know.” The silver-haired middle-aged man shook his head. “It’s hard to get a universe boat,” said the middle-aged man, “there’s no doubt about that. Under normal circumstances, those who own a universe boat must be real great beings or people with a big background. Of course, there are also some people who are lucky enough to get such a universe boat. However, such situations are rare. However, from what you just said, the other party didn’t show up at all. He didn’t even show his godly power or aura. That’s strange.”

“You think it’s strange too?” The muscular old man’s eyes lit up.

“A little, but I can’t be sure.” The silver-haired middle-aged man’s voice was calm, but his gaze suddenly turned toward the muscular old man. “Thirteen, if you’re really unhappy and feel aggrieved, and you can’t take this lying down, you can try to probe that universe boat, but don’t show yourself. Just send your subordinates to probe it, or use some other method to figure out the level of power of the great beings in the universe boat. Then you can decide whether to make a move or not.”

“Haha!” The old man laughed, “I’ve been waiting for you to say that. To tell you the truth, I’ve been planning to do that for a long time. However, I don’t need my men to test it out. I just need to wait quietly. I’ve known for a long time that the couple saved by the great beings in universe boat are going to wing fire star field. When my men fought with this couple, they used some special methods to sense their location.”

The rest of the warriors trembled when they saw what happened and started walking away from Lin Xiu.

Especially Yuan Bin, who still wanted to attack Lin Xiu, looked incredibly scared.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu could have such powerful strength. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Trying to kill me to get your hands on it?”

Lin Xiu looked at Yuan Bin and asked in a cold tone.

“You…you…”

Yuan Bin’s body was trembling as well.

“Kill him! Kill him right now!!!!!!”

But then, he was still screaming furiously.

“Don’t be frightened of this kid! There are so many of us here! Why should we be afraid of him?!”

After hearing what Yuan Bin said, all of them had a different look in their eyes and they were ready to kill once again.

All of them assumed that they had been careless. How would a young boy like him be able to kill all of them?

“Kill him!!!!!”

Then, there were warriors that came from all directions.

All of them have released their domain forces and they have transferred their energy onto the weapons.

It could be clearly seen that there was a large amount of energy accumulated at the tips of their weapons.

When Lin Xiu saw what was coming at him, he narrowed his eyes.

Then, there was a bright light that appeared all around Lin Xiu. It slowly expanded on the ground with Lin Xiu being in the centre of it and all of the domain forces that were released earlier soon disappeared.

Xiu – –

Then, there was a black spear that appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand.

Those who were getting closer to Lin Xiu noticed how he had swung his spear in the air and soon, without even getting the chance to release their ‘sphere’, their bodies were already chopped into half!

Lub Dub – –

Yuan Bin, who wanted to attack last, felt his knees turn weak as he fell onto the ground.

Instant kill!

All of his companions have been killed by Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu was still holding onto his spear as he walked toward Yuan Bin.

“Don’t! Don’t come any closer!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was about to get closer to him, Yuan Bin shivered in fear as he started moving backwards.

Lin Xiu has shown that he was a terrifying man.

If it was luck that allowed Lin Xiu to kill the first man, then he has proven all of them wrong just now. It definitely was not capable with just luck.

There were so many of them and Lin Xiu killed all of them.

He did it in seconds!

“Are you having fun?”

Lin Xiu looked at Yuan Bin and asked.

This man was the one who wanted to kill him in order to get the box. Lin Xiu would not be merciful toward this man.

“I’m sorry. I’ve made a terrible mistake. Please! Let me go…”

Yuan Bin crawled toward Lin Xiu as his body shook in fear. He was trying to hold onto Lin Xiu’s ankles.

However, as he crawled on the ground, his face that was away from Lin Xiu and where Lin Xiu couldn’t see, he had a hideous look on his face.

When he was right in front of Lin Xiu, he gathered a large amount of energy together and aimed it at Lin Xiu.

“Go to hell!!!!!”

Boom – –

Right then, before he could finish his actions, Lin Xiu’s spear had already pierced through his head.

“I knew that you were going to do that.”

Lin Xiu mumbled under his breath.

Killing all these respected warriors didn’t bring him much EXP.

He pulled away the long spear and got rid of all the blood on the tip of it. With the control of his mind, the black long spear then returned to his expansion space.

Clap clap clap – –

Then, there was an applause that came from the other end.

Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows. He looked over and noticed that there was a middle aged man sitting by the corner.

The rest of the crowd have already left in order not to be injured from the fight. This middle aged man was the only one left.

“Let me introduce myself. I am the owner of this place, Bibo.”

As the middle aged man walked toward him, he smiled at Lin Xiu.

“Do I have to pay for the damages here?”

Before Lin Xiu could continue, the man chuckled.

“You are powerful indeed. Are you interested in looking for something to do here in Bai Di City?”

Bibo looked at Lin Xiu and asked if he was interested.

“What do you need me to do?”

Lin Xiu was curious as well and the corner of his lips curled upwards.

This was getting interesting.

“Have you heard of the Road of Ice and Fire?”

Bibo looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

The Road of Ice and Fire?

Wasn’t this the information that he enquired about in the search of the Orchid of Heaven?

He was planning to go there as well but now, someone was asking him to do it instead.

This was similar to how he wanted to take a nap and someone handed him the pillow.

“There is a client who told me to find a bunch of warriors to kill the Ice Dragon.”

Bibo continued as he stared at Lin Xiu.

“Ice Dragon?”

After hearing what Bibo said, Lin Xiu looked confused.

“Yes. An evolved beast at god level. It lives there and is extremely powerful.”

“The client wants the horn and the odd crystal?”

Bibo nodded his head.

“What about the pay?”

Lin Xiu remained calm as he continued.

“‘Silence’.”

Bibo lowered his voice as he told Lin Xiu the reward.

After hearing the answer, his pupil shrank subconsciously.

Silence?

What he meant was…..

“The legendary sage level warrior skills of the Ye family – ‘Silence’.”

Bibo looked around before telling Lin Xiu with a soft tone.

It really was the one he expected!

Lin Xiu looked surprised.

The three famous sage warrior skills of the Ye family include ‘Heaven Breaking strike, Silence and Time Control.

The skill that he had cultivated, ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’ was already so powerful and the other two must also be as powerful as the one that he had.

“This skill is a legendary skill. If you are able to kill the Ice Dragon, you will be able to get it.”

Bibo’s words were tempting.

“I’m just worried that I won’t be useful there.”

Lin Xiu looked at Bibo and there was an interesting look in his eyes.

This was such a powerful skill and there would definitely be a lot of powerful warriors looking for it.

It definitely wouldn’t be an easy trip.

As Bibo heard what Lin Xiu said, he had an awkward look on his face.

This domineering, legendary warrior skill was the reward and there will definitely be lots of warriors fighting for it.

“This is the invite. If you are interested in it, you can just head over to the address written on it one day after tomorrow.”

Bibo took out a piece of card and passed it to Lin Xiu.

“Alright. I’ll think about it.”

Lin Xiu answered without giving the final answer.

“Goodbye.”

Then, he turned around and left the bar.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was already out of the bar, Bibo took out a cigarette and lit it.

“There goes another candidate.”

The mission that he was given was to invite powerful warriors to join the hunt. Whether or not Lin Xiu would be there or if he ended up dead, it was none of his business.
