1427 The Bitten Soul

One man and two beasts killed the three warriors in an instant.

Thank you readers!

Looking at the scene in front of her, Zhang Linlin was completely shocked.

Escape!

There is only one word in her mind now.

But now the entire ‘Sphere’ was covered with ice.

She wanted to escape, but there was no way to flee!

Can’t fly away!

But she didn’t dare to retract ‘Sphere’ and break through the frost with her weapon.

Kala Kala——

At this moment, with Luo Yue’s triggering her thoughts, the frost covering Zhang Linlin’s ‘Sphere’ began to shrink slowly.

Her ‘Sphere’ also made strange noises because of being squeezed.

This is…

Zhang Linlin felt all this and became panicked at this moment.

Her ‘Sphere’, at this moment, has been squeezed to the point of being deformed!

No more! If this continues, her ‘Sphere’ will be squeezed by these ice cubes and explode!

Just when she was about to make a move, Luo Yue’s thoughts were triggered, and she stretched out her left hand and grabbed the air!

boom–

The frost covering her ‘Sphere’ instantly squeezed crazily.

Her ‘Sphere’ exploded immediately! Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

And those ice cubes were all directly squeezed into her body.

Squeeze her body flat in an instant.

The blood and water mixed with ice cubes, all fell to the ground.

Seeing Zhang Linlin die, Luo Yue also heaved a sigh of relief.

If Zhang Linlin was more persistent, it was possible for Luo Yue to be killed by her.

Luo Yue, who had just heaved a sigh of relief, hadn’t had time to take a break. The next moment, as if she felt something, the look in her eyes changed slightly.

“She even killed all the members of my law enforcement team. She is a good apprentice I value.”

At this moment, a figure instantly appeared in the sky.

The lord of the sect that Luo Yue was forced to join, Ling Tianxi!

God King level.

And beside him was another man who looked very vicious.

God King Hetian!

Seeing the appearance of these two people, the expression in Luo Yue’s eyes changed drastically.

As soon as she moved, she was about to fly away.

boom–

But the moment she flew out, she felt her body hit an invisible barrier.

Taking a closer look, a black source mark had already appeared on the forehead of the God King Hetian.

Black source mark, spatial ability!

Luo Yue has been completely blocked by space power!

Behind these two people, there were also a large number of warriors following.

“Bring her to me, take her back.”

God King Hetian stared at Luo Yue and then said lightly.

As soon as he finished speaking, the subordinates behind him immediately surrounded Luo Yue below!

Xiaobai let out a shriek and blocked Luo Yue from behind. It flapped its wings and sent out a large number of icicles to attack the surrounding warriors!

And Rollie also holds his war hammer, trying to attack the surrounding God warriors!

“Hng!”

Looking at this scene, Ling Tianxi’s expression suddenly changed.

With a wave of his right hand, an incomparably terrifying power burst forth instantly.

The bodies of Rollie and Xiao Bai were directly thrown out by the powerful force and fell directly into the ocean below.

And just as Luo Yue was about to resist, several swords were held directly around his neck.

“Tianxi, dress her up well, and we’ll get married tomorrow night.”

At this time, King Hetian said lightly.

At the same time, Lin Xiu on the other side of the battle platform frowned.

It seems that he felt something.

Originally, he had already attacked Long Yingtian, but when he was so distracted, the attack fell through in an instant.

“With this strength, you still dare to challenge me!”

Long Yingtian let out a roar, and the saber in his hand burst out a large amount of dark energy.

As his saber collided with Lin Xiu’s spear, the dark energy was directly transmitted to Lin Xiu’s spear, and seemed to spread to Lin Xiu’s hands along with the body of the spear!

But at this moment, a large amount of dark energy appeared on Lin Xiu’s body, directly assimilating the transmitted dark energy!

Looking at this scene, Long Yingtian’s pupils shrank slightly.

It seems that Lin Xiu never thought that Lin Xiu would also use dark energy.

Lin Xiu wanted to end the battle quickly and directly activated the ‘Fury’ skill, and then activated ‘Full Blown Profound Intent’!

‘Profound Intent: Heaven Breaking Strike’!

At this moment, Lin Xiu slashed across with his long spear, and a terrifying force erupted immediately!

Boom——

There was a loud explosion, causing all the warriors around to cover their ears.

At this moment, Long Yingtian’s body was also blown away!

His flying body hit the ground heavily, and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

“ah!!!”

Long Yingtian quickly turned over and let out a loud roar.

The eye of the saber in his hand also turned red at this time.

At this time, behind Long Yingtian, a blood-red eye suddenly appeared!

Red-level divine soul!

Although it is a red-level soul, it seems to have some kind of strange power.

Lin Xiu, who was about to attack Long Yingtian, saw this eye at this time, and his whole body seemed to be frozen.

For a while, he couldn’t move at all!

What’s going on!?

At this time, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly.

Why can’t I move!

Is it because of the influence of his eye-like soul power!?

“I’m bleeding… You’re the first one to beat me till I bleed.”

Long Yingtian wiped the blood on his forehead, and suddenly his face became ferocious.

At this moment, holding his saber, he walked towards Lin Xiu.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you so easily, I will torture you slowly.”

He had to chop off Lin Xiu’s flesh piece by piece before he could let him die!

What he didn’t know at this moment was that traces of black energy appeared behind Lin Xiu’s body.

Soon, they gathered into a little black dragon!

The moment Long Yingtian approached, this little black dragon also flew towards him in an instant!

It directly targeted his divine soul power, that is, the red eye, and began to bite!

“ah!!!”

As soon as the power of the soul was bitten by the little black dragon, Long Yingtian felt the severe pain of backlash, and his whole body trembled.

How is this happening? How could his divine soul power be…

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s body was able to move!

Holding the spear in his hand, he rushed towards Long Yingtian without hesitation!
