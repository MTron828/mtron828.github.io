Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

As the long spear in his hand drew an arc, terrifying energy burst out directly.

The surrounding space seemed to ripple for a moment.

Those terrifying energies directly formed an arc and charged toward the warriors of the black troop and the white troop!

bang bang bang-

In the next moment, the bodies of those warriors were instantly cut in half by this terrifying power!

And at this time, the movements in Lin Xiu’s hands have not stopped and both hands continue to wield the Dark Edge spear.

boom boom boom —

One after another, dark blue flaming birds continued to be released at this moment.

“what!!!”

Those warriors who had just rushed over were hit by these incomparably hot flaming birds and suddenly screamed in pain.

Although some warriors responded quickly and unfolded the ‘Sphere’, the temperature of the flaming bird was too high. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When they unfolded the “Sphere”, they found that their “Sphere” was directly melted by the flaming birds released by Lin Xiu.

“Damn!”

The black dragon and the white dragon, who were watching this scene in the sky, clenched their hands into fists.

The elite warriors of their troops were simply killed as if Lin Xiu was mowing the grass!

“Where are the people from the Divine Domain!?”

Seeing that Lin Xiu was constantly attacking the people in their troops, Hei Long asked Bai Long.

“could not be reached.”

Bai Long shook his head and said.

At this time, he was also very puzzled, the people of Divine Domain suddenly withdrew from Wildfire City.

Even Huangfu Lin disappeared.

“Never mind, let’s go together and kill this kid!”

Hei Long looked at Lin Xiu below and felt more and more that Lin Xiu was a great threat.

He let out a loud roar and in the next moment, he and Bai Long rushed straight down!

At this time, as the flaming birds rushed around, there was no way for the warriors of the Black troop and the White troop to charge over again.

Looking up, Lin Xiu saw Hei Long and Bai Long rushing down!

Lin Xiu snorted coldly, holding the spear in his hand and went up to fight.

Dang dang-

The two held the long swords in their hands and kept attacking Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s long spear collided with their long swords and a lot of sparks burst out.

Hei Long and Bai Long clearly felt that Lin Xiu’s power became stronger and stronger.

Now they directly unfolded the ‘Sphere’ to avoid being attacked by the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand.

Destiny spear art.

At this time, as Lin Xiu used the Destiny Spear art, the spear in his hand stabbed wildly in an instant.

The spear art was extremely powerful. The long swords held by Hei Long and Bai Long continued to collide with the long spear and they suddenly felt severe pain in the hands holding the swords.

Dangdang——

At the next moment, all the long swords they were holding got hit!

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and the spear turned into thousands of stabs.

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

bang bang bang-

As Lin Xiu attacked, both of them felt the strong impact and flew out directly.

pfft—

Hei Long and Bai Long, who had just been blasted out, spat out a mouthful of blood.

But fortunately, their ‘Sphere’ was not destroyed.

“Go!”

Hei Long and Bai Long, whose bodies flew to the back, looked at each other. At this moment, source marks appeared on their foreheads.

Two energies, one black and one white, burst out from their source marks in an instant.

what is this!?

When Lin Xiu saw this scene from a distance, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

It was the first time he saw that the Source mark power could be combined.

Roar–

In the next moment, as if hearing a huge roar, Lin Xiu saw the black energy and white energy that converged together turning into a black dragon and a white dragon.

They were dragons formed by a real energy body!

These two black and white giant dragons showed their teeth and danced their claws and charged directly toward Lin Xiu!

“Go to hell!!!”

Following their roar, the two giant dragons charged directly towards Lin Xiu’s body!

Boom—

At this moment, the ground trembled wildly.

The surrounding buildings all collapsed.

The rest of the surrounding area exudes thick dust.

“Hmph, this time, he’s definitely going to die.”

Hei Long and Bai Long were suspended in the sky and they looked at the area below and there was thick dust everywhere.

Although the two of them were mortal enemies in the past, the combined strength of the two is indeed very powerful.

It was impossible for ordinary Sage warriors to resist this blow.

Lin Xiu, this boy, is sure to die!

“That bit of strength huh.”

But at this moment, a voice came from below.

Hearing the voice, Hei Long and Bai Long were surprised.

Lin Xiu, this is Lin Xiu’s figure!

Whoosh-

At this time, with the gust of wind around, all the thick dust was blown away.

Lin Xiu’s figure appeared.

Behind Lin Xiu was Sima Qiang.

The ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded protected both of them.

Moreover, their skill had no way of destroying Lin Xiu’s “Sphere”.

This is impossible!

Hei Long’s face became extremely sinister.

They used their most powerful joint source mark just now, but they didn’t expect that even Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ could not be broken!

“Chief, are you alright?”

Sima Qiang had almost recovered from his injuries at this time, standing behind Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“certainly.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

The ability attached to the skill title just now was triggered, with a 30% chance of resisting the upcoming 50% attack.

50% of the power of their skill was resisted!

Therefore, the power of their skill has no effect on Lin Xiu at all.

Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” can easily resist the attacks.

At this moment, Sima Qiang’s eyes became more and more filled with shock.

Lin Xiu became so strong after his return.

He was so much stronger than before.

But it’s only been a short time!

“From today, there is only one force in Wildfire City and that is Dark shadow.”

Lin Xiu raised his eyes to look at Hei Long and Bai Long and said lightly.

In the words, there is a look of incomparable confidence.

“Nonsense!”

Bai Long snorted coldly, all the source strength of his body was mobilized.

The same is true for Hei Long.

But none of them released their domain force.

Because they have experienced previous battles, they all know that Lin Xiu has the ability to cover their domain force!
