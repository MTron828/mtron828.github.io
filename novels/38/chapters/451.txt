Chapter 452: Undersea Fright (Part 1)

Do not panic no matter what he sees?!

What was there in the sea?

After hearing what the dean said, Lin Xiu got curious as well.

But, Dean Baili did not continue and Lin Xiu didn’t bother asking as well, thinking that he would know it as soon as he got into the water.

“Let’s go.” After making sure that Lin Xiu had all the things that he needed, Dean Baili led the way.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded before following behind him.

Other than him, there were a few other staff members that followed Dean Baili as they walked towards the gate.

The Sacred Region Academy was built on an island and it was surrounded by the ocean.

The ocean looked endless and there was nothing else that they could see other than the waves of the ocean.

“Alright. Drink this.” Dean Baili took out a transparent tube from his pocket and it was filled with a pale, blue fluid.

“Nutrition fluid?”

“En. Finish this and you won’t have to eat for another 24 hours but still get the energy that you require.” Dean Baili nodded her head.

Lin Xiu took the tube from him and drank without any hesitation.

“This dagger, take it.” From his other hand, Dean Baili took out a dagger that was kept in its cover.

“These are mutant creatures in the ocean. Usually, they wouldn’t attack you as long as you don’t disturb them. If there is any urgent matter, use it.” Dean Baili continued saying.

“Alright. Should I go down now?” Lin Xiu asked.

“En, go ahead. Remember, once you find out what it is, press on the red button that is on your wrist. You can also use it if you are in any trouble, we’ll receive a notification as well.” Dean Baili instructed him.

“En.”

Lin Xiu looked at the ocean that was right before him. He took a deep breath before putting on the transparent helmet.

The special suit that he had on lit up as soon as he put on the helmet and the two were connected seamlessly.

Boom – –

Without wasting any time, Lin Xiu dived into the ocean.

“Dean Baili, are you sure that it wouldn’t be a problem allowing that kid in the water?” One of the men who was standing by Dean Baili asked when he saw the look in the dean’s eyes.

“Don’t worry about it.”

“But…”

“Enough. Other than him, I can’t think of anyone else who can do this. The ocean is not as peaceful as it used to be.” Dean Baili sighed as he looked at the endless ocean.

Lin Xiu, who had just entered the ocean, immediately felt cold.

In the middle of his diving suit lit up like a lamp which made it easier for him to see the things around him.

‘This creature…..where is it?’

Lin Xiu held onto the radar that he was given as he thought to himself.

However, the radar was not showing any signs. Lin Xiu felt bumped but he had no other choice but to continue.

Hong hong – –

He took a closer look from where the noise was from and noticed that there were a lot of weird looking fishes near him. These fishes looked huge and terrifying.

According to what Dean Baili has told him, these fishes were very sensitive to energy. If they realized that there was a huge amount of energy near them, they would go crazy.

As he activated his Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu learnt that these fishes were rank 6 mutant creatures.

There’s light?

While he was in the water, it was pitch black but Lin Xiu noticed that somewhere below him, there was something that was giving out light.

What’s that?

Lin Xiu was taken aback and decided to swim towards it and soon, an astonishing scene appeared before his eyes.

“What…..what the hell is this?!”

After seeing what was in front of him, Lin Xiu was shocked.

Machines.

Underneath the island, Lin Xiu saw lots of peculiar looking machines and all of these were attached beneath the island.

Lin Xiu finally knew why the group of men were so cautious towards Dean Baili’s idea of sending him down here.

This was there is a secret of the Sacred Region Sanctuary that was hidden here!

The academy looked like it was built on an island when it was above water but as he is now beneath it, he saw how the entire island was being supported by all these weird machinery. Lin Xiu finally realized that the entire Sacred Region Academy was built on a man-made island!

The island could have been a huge cruise ship or a spaceship.

This was fascinating.

Lin Xiu was shocked for a moment before taking a deep breath. He took a closer look at it and noticed that there were tiny worm-like creatures that were biting on the machines.

The machineries looked like they were made of a special material and looked as good as new.

But, the odd-looking black worm-like creatures were still chewing on it.

“What is that?” Lin Xiu decided to get a little closer to see what it was but as soon as he tried moving towards them, he realised that these creatures had changed their target. They were targeting him instead!

Lin Xiu could now appreciate the appearance of these worm-like creatures.

They were just like tadpoles that were as huge as a human’s palm with a pair of red eyes. They have a huge mouth as well and whenever they opened their mouth, it revealed a bed of sharp, densely arranged teeth.

It was incredibly disgusting and it would give others goosebumps.

Seeing how they were trying to bite him, Lin Xiu quickly took out the dagger and started slashing at the worms who were headed towards him.

Although the buoyancy underwater was great, Lin Xiu could still feel the speciality of the diving suit that he was wearing which helped reduce the restriction that he would face underwater.

Plus, Lin Xiu was really strong as well and with the help of the sharp dagger, he was able to easily cut the worm’s body into two parts.

After getting rid of the groups of worms, Lin Xiu swam in the other direction and was looking at the machinery. There was a part that was made of steel that seemed to have been bitten really badly.

Luckily, the damage wasn’t concerning.

These worms…..why do they look so weird?

Lin Xiu frowned and activate his Analytical Eye as he looked at the remains of the worms;

“Rank 5 Black Tooth Fish ( Alien Creature ). Features: Sharp teeth, able to chew hard things”

He didn’t care about the rank of the features of the creatures. The only thing that caught his attention was that this was an alien creature?! Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

After reading through the information that was given by the Analytical Eye, he was shocked.

How could it be an alien creature? Why are they here?

He looked downwards and saw something that made his pupil shrink in shock with his mouth wide open.

Right below him, there was a vortex-like thing that looked as if there was a crack in space!
