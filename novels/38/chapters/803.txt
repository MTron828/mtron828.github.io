Chapter 804: Killing Sun Zi

His body was still in great pain now and he couldn’t hide!

He could clearly feel that with this attack, it would take away his life!

“Damn it!!”

Sun Zi, who was standing by the side, was in shock as well.

He reached for the heavy laser gun from the security guard next to him and started shooting Lin Xiu frantically.

Xiu xiu xiu — –

The terrifying laser beams were shot onto Lin Xiu’s body but they did no damage to Lin Xiu!

How….how is this even possible?!

When he saw what happened, Sun Zi looked shocked.

Lin Xiu did not release his ‘Yuan’ and was blocking the laser beams with his physical body. Judging from this, how strong would his physical strength be?!

“Die!!!!”

At the same time, Lin Xiu was still headed towards Yan Yongxin!

The tip of the Dark Edge was covered with hellfire and it was aimed towards that man!

“AHHHHHH!!!”

Yan Yongxin screamed and released all of the source body from his body in order to strengthen his ‘Yuan’ so that he could defend himself from Lin Xiu’s attack.

Koong Loong – –

At that moment when the tip of the spear touched the ‘Yuan’, there was a loud explosion.

The entire ground shook vigorously.

There were dust and ashes everywhere.

As for Yan Yongxin, he was looking at his ‘Yuan’ and he noticed that there was a huge crack from where Lin Xiu’s spear had pierced through his ‘Yuan’.

Crack – –

Following that, his ‘Yuan’ shattered into pieces.

The tip of the spear then headed towards his chest and pierced through it as well.

“You...”

He stared at Lin Xiu, who was wearing the mask, with his wide eyes when the spear went through his body.

He couldn’t believe that he…was killed by a warrior who was only a master warrior.

And….he was such a young master warrior.

“Head onto the other world now.”

Lin Xiu said bluntly as he released his source power onto the spear. From the spear, there was a large amount of dark blue flame that appeared and from the end of it, it spread towards Yan Yongxin’s body.

Koong Loong – –

With the large, terrifying hellfire, his entire body was burnt into ash under the naked eyes.

In the end, there was only a set of bones left.

The entire area was filled with dust and it was as if they were in a region covered with severe haze.

Most of them couldn’t even clearly see what was happening.

But for Lin Xiu, his eyes still had a murderous intention.

Without any hesitation, he moved towards another direction.

“Damn it!”

Sun Zi was covering his mouth with both his hands. With the dust and smoke around him, it was making him feel uncomfortable

Did Lin Xiu kill Yan Yongxin with that attack?!

If Lin Xiu killed Yan Yongxin, he would be in big trouble now!

This was because the match was about to happen in Fengyun City and most of the elders from the Sun family had already moved there to help out. They only left Yan Yongxin to protect him.

However, what he didn’t expect was that Yan Yongxin would fail here.

That man might be a bald man with a mask on but from the way that he was using the spear, it was obvious that this man was Lin Xiu!

Sun Zi tightened his jaw and he wanted to leave this place as quickly as possible.

He had a bad feeling about this.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

As he turned around, there was a familiar voice that came from behind him.

When he heard the voice, the blood from his face drained off and he started running.

But, Lin Xiu had already appeared right in front of him and had blocked his way.

“You...”

Sun Zi widened his eyes in shock. Before he could say anything, the Dark Edge was already heading to his head.

Boom – –

He didn’t even have the chance to release ‘Yuan’ as the spear had already pierced through his head.

“They’re over there!”

At that moment, the smoke around them was slowly disappearing and there was a large group of warriors headed towards Lin Xiu.

Looks like they were from the Sun family.

Lin Xiu immediately pulled back the spear from Sun Zi’s head and ran in the opposite direction.

A large number of them ran after Lin Xiu’s figure and headed towards the east of Cangqiong City.

“Yan Yongxin….was killed?!”

An Qi and Qian Ling widened their eyes in shock as they looked at the scene in front of their eyes.

They noticed that on the spot where Yan Yongxin fell earlier, there was only a seat of bones left.

Lin Xiu was definitely alive which means that this was Yan Yongxin.

He had turned into bones within a blink of an eye.

How powerful would the person be in order to do this?!

“Fatty….we have to leave Cangqiong City now.”

Then, there was another voice that appeared next to them.

Liu Pan and the rest were shocked. They quickly turned around and saw Lin Xiu standing behind them.

He was no longer wearing a mask and had shown his true self.

He wasn’t bald either and had long, shoulder length hair.

“You...”

Liu Pan widened his eyes and looked in the other direction.

He was confused. Wasn’t that Lin Xiu?

An Qi and Qian Ling were shocked as well.

“That’s my mirror image.”

“We have to leave quickly or else, we wouldn’t make it.”

Lin Xiu quickly explained what happened earlier.

He had been using his mirror image just now and made a replica of himself that only had 30% of his actual strength.

As for him, he hid in a corner and took out the hair growth serum that he prepared earlier which allowed him to have such long hair within seconds.

“We’ll send you off.”

An Qi and Qian Ling finally understood what was happening and offered to see them off.

“Don’t. We would get you in trouble as well if anyone else found us odd.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“And, looking at the time, there are only two weeks left until the match. If we don’t leave now, we won’t be able to make it there in time.”

Lin Xiu explained the situation to them.

“But…..”

“This is for you.”

Lin Xiu suddenly thought of something and took out a few warrior skills cards from his pocket and handed it to An Qi and Qian Ling.

These were his own spear technique skills.

“Work hard with it. We shall meet in the future.”

Lin Xiu smiled and did not say anything much after that. He looked at Liu Pan before walking towards the city gate.

“Brother Lin, wait for me!”

Liu Pan called after Lin Xiu. Before running after Lin Xiu, he turned towards An Qi and Qian Ling, waved his hand and said, “Beauties… goodbye!”

Soon, both of them arrived at the city gate.

But, they noticed that there were lots of warriors guarding the place and were checking each and everyone who was leaving the place.

By the side, Lin Xiu could see that there were posters of him, bald and with a mask on.

That’s quick?!

When Lin Xiu saw the posters, he was shocked.

“You. Stand there.”Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com
