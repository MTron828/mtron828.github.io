Chapter 802: Dragon and Phoenix Fight!

The host was stunned when he heard the voice and looked around, but he didn’t seem to find the person who spoke.

At this time, everyone looked around and started discussing.

As for Liu Pan, An Qi and Qian Lin, their faces had a look of surprise at this time.

This voice... so familiar!

“Humph! I have already bid for it anyway, this weapon is mine!”

The man who just bid for the Dark Edge spear stood up at this time and snorted coldly.

Yan Yongxin frowned slightly at this time.

He had a feeling that something is wrong.

swoosh—

And at this moment, a figure appeared beside the host.

“Who are you?!”

The host was surprised when he saw someone suddenly appeared above.

Taking a closer look, this man was wearing a somewhat tattered battle suit, with a strange mask on his face.

There is no hair on the head, it is a bald head.

“So it’s here huh.”

The man wearing the mask was undoubtedly Lin Xiu.

At this time, looking at his Dark Edge spear, Lin Xiu said in a light voice.

“Security!!!”

The host shouted loudly at this time.

At this moment, many warriors in security uniforms rushed up and wanted to grab Lin Xiu.

“Get lost.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

At this moment, terrifying pressure struck instantly.

All the security guards who rushed up were sent flying out!

Lin Xiu stretched his hand towards the Dark Edge spear.

The Dark Edge spear that was originally placed on this table flew over in an instant and let Lin Xiu hold it in his hand.

At that time, he spun the Dark Edge spear and the familiar feeling came over again.

“Uncle Yan!”

At this moment, Sun Zi looked at Yan Yongxin who was sitting beside him.

“It’s that kid.”

Yan Yongxin’s face was gloomy and he said with a bit of gritted teeth.

He slammed the armrest next to him and he flew over to the table in an instant!

crackling-

The moment he leaped over, a terrifying giant lightning bolt appeared in the air.

“Get out of the way!”

With his loud roar, the host over there turned pale with fright and hurriedly left.

“Humph!”

Seeing the pair of huge lightning fists rushing towards him, Lin Xiu snorted coldly, holding the Dark Edge spear in both hands, directly resisting the giant lightning hand.

And at this moment, a white light burst out from Lin Xiu’s body.

The light instantly covered the entire field.

‘Heavenly Array’!

And at this moment, Lin Xiu had activated the ‘Fury’ skill.

The strength of the body, at this moment, has reached its peak.

“It really is you!”

Yan Yongxin, who was in the air, looked at the dark red ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded and the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

He had clearly thrown Lin Xiu into the hellfire – why, why is he still alive!

At this moment, he waved his fists wildly in the air.

All those huge lightning fists hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

boom boom boom —

A loud noise continued to sound and the entire space shook.

These people who were originally participating in the auction, when they saw this scene and exclaimed, quickly left.

After all, Yan Yongxin’s skill was still very powerful and they didn’t want to be affected.

“Call someone! Quickly call someone!”

When the host escaped, he hurriedly shouted in shock.

“Don’t be nervous, Uncle Yan will take care of him.”

Sun Zi, who was standing on the other side, glanced at him, then said lightly.

“Sun... Young Master Sun...”

The man was stunned when he heard Sun Zi’s words.

The Sun family was in control behind this auction. Hearing Sun Zi’s words at this time, he did not continue to call out.

After all, Sun Zi had given his promise.

Moreover, Yan Yongxin still has a certain reputation in Cangqiong City. After all, he is a warrior at the level of King warrior who is called the Lightning King.

boom boom boom —

A loud sound resounded through the entire space at this time.

But Lin Xiu, who was standing in the ‘Sphere’, let his pair of huge lightning hands attack his ‘Sphere’.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and the source energy of his whole body was mobilized at this moment.

As soon as the legs exerted force, the whole person leaped up without waiting for the giant lightning hand to strike again!

The Dark Edge spear he was holding was about to stab Yan Yongxin in the air!

“Courting death!”

Looking at Lin Xiu’s movements, the expression in his eyes couldn’t help changing, then he shouted loudly.

Lin Xiu, who was leaping in the air, with his body in the air, inconceivably dodged the impact of this giant lightning hand. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

At this moment, the Dark Edge spear held in both hands waved directly into the air!

At this moment, one after another flaming birds burst out, directly impacting Yan Yongxin’s body!

The color of the flaming birds this time was different from the previous one.

The color turned dark blue!

Yan Yongxin originally wanted to smack these flaming birds of Lin Xiu, but at this moment, he seemed to sense something and the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

The huge lightning hand disappeared instantly and his body also jumped down from the air.

It seems that he wants to avoid the flaming birds coming.

But the flaming birds flew down from the sky as if it could track him and continued to pursue Yan Yongxin.

“Damn!”

Yan Yongxin’s expression changed greatly.

He clearly felt the horror of that flame, and if he was not careful, it would cause him fatal injuries.

Only hellfire could make him feel this way!

Could it be that...

At this moment, he seemed to have thought of a terrifying possibility.

But he immediately denied it in his mind.

This kind of terrifying flame existed there for so many years, how could it be absorbed by him.

At this time, Yan Yongxin also used his body technique, dodging frantically around here.

boom boom boom —

As soon as those flaming birds hit the surrounding seats, the entire body of those seats was burned to the point where there was no slag left.

The entire space seemed to become extremely hot.

“Master! It’s Master!”

An Qi and Qian Lin said excitedly when they looked at the familiar skill.

“Hahaha, I knew that Brother Lin Xiu would be fine!”

Liu Pan also burst into laughter at this time.

“Courting death!”

After Yan Yongxin continued to flee for a distance, he suddenly turned around and looked at the flaming birds that continued to charge and he suddenly became angry with shame.

To be chased and beaten by a master warrior-level warrior is a shame!

He roared and a purple light burst out from his body.

Domain force!
