Chapter 140: Rollie’s Accomplishment!

Glurggh-

Wan Hu was in the middle of his laughter and did not know what entered his throat and subconsciously swallowed it down.

“What the hell is that!” He opened his eyes wide as he felt the thing sliding down his throat. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

The strange feeling caused him to open his eyes wide.

What is that thing?!

He suddenly felt immense pain in his body as he dropped his weapon to the ground.

The pain came from his chest.

Wan Hu tore off his own clothes and could clearly see something protruding out from inside his chest.

“What the hell is that! Get out!!!” Wan Hu was overwhelmed with fear and reached out to press on the protrusion.

But when he pressed down, the thing moved to another location.

Luo Yue was shocked at the sight of it as well.

What is that thing?!

Lin Xiu was still gasping for breath, the aftermath of Fury had yet to be dispelled.

He could not feel an ounce of energy in his body.

But Lin Xiu was surprised at Wan Hu’s state as well.

Can Rollie….kill Wan Hu?

“AHHH!!!!” Wan Hu suddenly screamed as he felt a burst of pain and he started to roll on the floor.

“Get out!!”

“Get out of me right now!!!” Wan Hu rolled fanatically and roared.

He extended his hand in an attempt to claw at his chest. He wanted so badly to break in and dig the thing out.

Bang-

In the next moment, his chest swelled up like a ball and exploded.

He focused and saw many large holes in his chest. He could even see his own heart beating.

Wan Hu’s eyes were wide opened, but he no longer had any consciousness left.

Rollie actually killed him!?

Even Lin Xiu was shocked.

“What is that thing?!” Luo Yue looked beside Wan Hu’s corpse where the round Rollie that resembled a ball rolled over.

Luo Yue saw it rolling over and her gaze changed. She was about to make a move when Lin Xiu advised her, “Don’t attack it.”

Luo Yue was startled. She watched as the thing rolled on Lin Xiu and sat on his shoulder.

Rollie performed a jump on his shoulder as though it was saying ‘praise me, praise me’.

“Thank you, this is for you.” Lin Xiu chuckled and caressed its body as he took out a gold odd crystal and handed it to Rollie.

Rollie seemed to be ecstatic when it took the odd crystal and revealed a mouth that could not be seen at all. It was like a squirrel nibbling on melon seeds as it ate the crystal.

Lin Xiu was gradually recovering. Although he was unable to battle, he could do simple movements.

“Are you alright?” Lin Xiu asked Luo Yue.

Luo Yue shook her head. She attempted to pick up her own sword when her legs turned soft and she sat on the ground.

“Let me help you apply some medication.” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue

Lin Xiu had changed his view on her seeing how she blocked the attack for him.

She looked ice-cold, but her heart was completely unlike her appearance.

Luo Yue sat on the ground and did not reject him.

Lin Xiu took some recovery liquid and walked over to her side.

He looked at the place where she was stabbed and the rip on her clothes. He tried to pull it but the material was too high quality. He failed to rip it and this situation made him awkward.

“Why don’t you take out your dress…”

Lin Xiu subconsciously blurted out.

Upon hearing his words, Luo Yue turned and glared at him coldly.

“I’m just trying to put some medicine on you. Your clothes material is too strong and I can’t rip it out to see the wound.” Lin Xiu explained himself.

He was not thinking about it in a perverse way.

Luo Yue’s gaze changed. She hesitated for a moment before using her uninjured hand to pull down the top part of her dress.

Lin Xiu could not help but watch her attentively.

But as she pulled it down, he saw another white shoulder strap inside

She revealed her delicate collarbone and fair arm.

Her injured shoulder continued to flow with blood.

“Quickly.” As though sensing Lin Xiu sizing her up, Luo Yue immediately reminded him.

“Oh.” Lin Xiu nodded and took out a bottle of disinfectant and poured it on her wound.

The blood and disinfectant liquid all flowed down from the wound to the floor.

Lin Xiu was inwardly stunned when he saw her wound. It was extremely deep that revealed her bones that were close to the point of breaking.

Lin Xiu did not feel disgusted, after all, she had taken the blow for him.

He took a deep breath and started to apply for recovery medicine on her horrifying wound.

Sssii-

The recovery liquid reacted with the wound and white smoke was produced.

Lin Xiu saw Luo Yue frown a few times but she did not make a sound.

Lin Xiu was inwardly impressed. If it were any other guy, they would be rolling on the ground in pain, right?

“Sprinkle this.” Luo Yue took out a transparent glass bottle that was filled with a pale gold powder and threw it to Lin Xiu with her other arm.

Lin Xiu took the bottle and after thinking about it, pressed down on her shoulder and closed the open wound before sprinkling the powder on her shoulder.

Once the powder was set, no more blood flowed out and the powder seemed to be extremely effective on this wound.

Luo Yue used her left hand to feel for her collarbone before pressing down on the cut region.

As the recovery liquid became effective, the cells in her body divided rapidly and started the fast healing. At this point, although her collarbone had yet to be healed, there were no longer any open cuts.

“Have a good rest tonight.”

Seeing that Luo Yue’s wound was handled well, Lin Xiu spoke up.

“En.” Luo Yue nodded her head and did not refute.

The moon in the sky was very bright and cast two extremely long shadows on two lonely figures in the desert….
