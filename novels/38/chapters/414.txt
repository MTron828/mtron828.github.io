Chapter 415: You Didn’t Take Your Medicine Today?

The man on the opposite side seemed to be unable to withstand the continuous attack of his halberd. The ‘Sphere’ was already unfolded to protect him from the attack. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Bang–

But this man was holding the halberd with both hands and he broke the man’s ‘Sphere’ with a direct blow!

How could this be!!!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted.

That was not something ordinary, it was a ‘Sphere’!

The ‘sphere’ was formed by the concentration of the source strength from the whole body! Even if the force could be broken, how could it be done so easily!

With this thought, Lin Xiu was shocked.

Soon, the man was shot off the arena directly.

The man waving the halberd turned around and looked behind him, his eyes seemed to look through the screen, staring straight at Lin Xiu.

“31st floor of the Tower of Tournament, Lei Zhu was a rank 7 warrior known as the ‘Sword King’ in his sophomore year.” Luo Yue said faintly as she stared at the screen.

Taking a closer look, Luo Yue’s gaze was solemn.

“The one who was defeated just now was a rank 7 warrior!?” Lin Xiu was even more shocked when he heard Luo Yue’s words.

This was too much, a rank 7 warrior was defeated so easily!?

“Yeah.” Luo Yue nodded.

“By the way, this guy with the halberd is also a freshman?” Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something at this time, then he slapped his thigh and said suddenly.

Because he heard those people talking about this at the exchange center today.

“En.”

“Why haven’t I seen this person before…” Lin Xiu said, a little puzzled.

One must understand that Zhuo Qixing and Ouyang Hang were the strongest at the time, but this guy was obviously much stronger than them!

No, it should be said that they were not on the same level at all.

“Yu Muchen.” Luo Yue looked at the video of the previous battle at the top of the screen and there was a little bit of murderous intent in her eyes.

“Yu Muchen? You know him?” Lin Xiu asked.

And the sharp-eyed Lin Xiu was able to clearly capture the murderous intent in Luo Yue’s eyes.

This person has enmity with Luo Yue!?

“An enemy.” Luo Yue replied coldly.

“You should study his battle video first. We will fight with him sooner or later.” Luo Yue was obviously in a bad mood at this time. As she spoke, she walked upstairs.

At this timing, Luo Yue should be training but now it was obvious that because of this man named Yu Muchen, Luo Yue seemed to have thought of something and gave off a murderous aura.

“Yu Muchen, huh…” Lin Xiu couldn’t help narrowing his eyes as he watched the battle video on the screen.

This was his battle video from the first floor to the thirty-first floor and Lin Xiu looked very carefully. He discovered that no matter which floor Yu Muchen was on, he only used basic combat routines and didn’t use any skills at all to defeat those people!

Seeing this, Lin Xiu was in even more shock and felt a burst of pressure in his heart.

This person is too strong eh?

At this moment, Lin Xiu heard footsteps coming from the gate.

“Who is it?” Lin Xiu furrowed his brows slightly when he felt the presence of someone outside the door, then called out.

“It’s me.” The person outside the door was silent for a while, then said aloud.

Hearing this familiar voice, Lin Xiu quickly knew who it was and he was slightly surprised.

Why is this guy here!?

“Come in.” Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand at this time, then said faintly.

As Lin Xiu spoke, the door opened.

“It really is you.” Looking at the person who appeared, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, then said faintly.

Ouyang Hang!

That’s right, the person who came turned out to be Ouyang Hang!

“Didn’t bring any cyborgs along to deal with me this time?” Lin Xiu said coldly as he looked at Ouyang Hang.

This guy suddenly turned up and Lin Xiu was very surprised. What the hell does he want!?

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Ouyang Hang looked embarrassed.

Obviously, Lin Xiu knew that he was the one who planned the incident with Yu Yi.

“Lin Xiu, don’t be so hostile. I am here this time to make a deal with you.” Ouyang Hang took a deep breath, then said to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu looked at him and saw that he didn’t even have a weapon in his hand and didn’t bring anyone over. It was obvious that he was not here to find trouble.

“Do you think there is anything to talk about between us?” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, then said faintly.

“And aren’t you afraid that I would just kill you directly!?”

As soon as Lin Xiu said that, the spear in his pierced directly towards Ouyang Hang!

Swish——

At this moment, the tip of the spear was a few millimeters away from touching Ouyang Hang’s neck and penetrating it.

But Ouyang Hang didn’t seem to have any intention of dodging it.

“I know you won’t kill me.” Ouyang Hang said calmly.

That was what he said but the cold sweat on his forehead had already betrayed him.

Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows, then retracted the spear, “You wouldn’t come here for nothing; go on, what’s the matter.”

Watching Lin Xiu put the spear back, Ouyang Hang heaved a sigh of relief. He was really afraid that Lin Xiu, who was very unpredictable, would kill him directly. Then, he really had nothing to say.

Lin Xiu looked at Ouyang Hang at this time. Ouyang Hang seemed very strange and wasn’t looking at him with hatred, he didn’t bring his weapon either.

Did this guy take the wrong medicine?

“You’re watching this too?” Ouyang Hang looked at the projection behind Lin Xiu – it was Yu Muchen’s battle scene.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded, then thought about it carefully and said to Ouyang Hang, “Let me ask you a question.”

“Huh?” Ouyang Hang was taken aback, then said, “Sure, I came here with sincerity, what do you want to know, I will tell you.”

Ouyang Hang had already guessed that Lin Xiu might ask him about Yu Muchen.

He came to talk to Lin Xiu about Yu Muchen anyway.

“You… didn’t take your medicine today?” Lin Xiu thought for a while, then gave him a suspicious look before he spoke.
