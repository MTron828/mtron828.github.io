Chapter 522: Requiem

Lin Xiu frowned, put the odd crystal into the pocket of the battle suit, looked ahead, and found that someone was coming over.

“I saw it, over there!!!”

Some people seemed to see the huge body of the Unicorn Thunder Cow over there, then shouted loudly.

Soon, a group of about 20 warriors came over.

“Head!”

The few people who had just been rescued by Lin Xiu saw this scene and they were surprised as they shouted towards the man in the lead.

“I asked you guys to attract the fire first, but I didn’t expect to run here.

“But how did you kill this Unicorn Thunder Cow?”

Some warriors looked at the body of the Unicorn thunder cow lying on the ground and couldn’t help being shocked.

“They saved us.” A man slowly stood up, then pointed to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue over there and said.

“Oh?”

Hearing his words, everyone’s eyes followed his finger and looked towards Lin Xiu.

After seeing Lin Xiu and Luo Yue clearly, they were surprised.

Because Lin Xiu and Luo Yue seemed very young and Luo Yue was a stunning beauty, but she looked a bit cold.

“Did you guys kill this Unicorn thunder cow?”

The man leading glanced at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, then said lightly.

While they were sizing up at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, Lin Xiu glanced at them.

These people were all carrying backpacks and there were some skins of evolved beasts and animal horns on their backpacks.

It was clear that the main purpose of this group of people wasn’t to find space cracks but to hunt for evolved beasts and take the materials of the evolved beasts to sell.

Hunter among the warriors.

“This unicorn thunder beast belongs to us.” Before Lin Xiu could begin to speak, the man looked at Lin Xiu, then said faintly.

The people behind him also looked at Lin Xiu at this time, their eyes filled with coldness.

“You said that it’s yours?” Lin Xiu didn’t have any desire for this evolved beast’s body, even if the materials of a high-level evolved beast were very expensive.

But this person’s attitude made Lin Xiu unhappy.

“Captain, they just saved us.” A man walked over at this moment and said.

“Go away.” When the man heard his words, his face changed and he kicked him away.

At the next moment, he pointed a saber at Lin Xiu.

“Captain of the Requiem Group, Liu Kun.” The man said to Lin Xiu.

Their Requiem Hunter group was very famous in Black Rock City.

“No clue,” Lin Xiu said lightly.

“You…” Liu Kun’s expression suddenly changed when he heard Lin Xiu’s words. He originally wanted to use his team’s name to suppress Lin Xiu and make him terrified, but Lin Xiu was so direct which embarrassed him. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

“Bring that girl here.” At this time, Liu Kun showed a cruel smile on his face, then said in a grimace.

Several warriors who had been itching for a long time walked towards Luo Yue.

“Little beauty, big brothers are here.” These warriors had a grin on their cheeks and their eyes were full of lust. They looked at Luo Yue who was standing there and swallowed secretly.

It was the first time they had seen such a beauty.

The men just now looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue and they all showed a complicated gaze.

It was originally Lin Xiu who rescued them, but now their leader wants to…

“Captain…” When a man gritted his teeth and wanted to speak to Liu Kun, he saw Liu Kun’s murderous eyes.

“Why? This kid saved you, you are going to disregard me as the leader?” Liu Kun said with a smile at this time.

Just this smile sent them trembling.

Bang bang bang——

But at this moment, a blood arrow shot out directly from the side and shot directly on Liu Kun’s face.

“Did I tell you to kill her!!!”

Liu Kun was anxious at this time, turned around, and roared loudly.

But when he just turned around, his eyes suddenly widened and he seemed to be frozen.

He thought it was his subordinates who killed the beauty, Luo Yue, but then he took a closer look and discovered that all of his subordinates had been killed by Luo Yue!

Their bodies fell and blood flowed all over the ground.

The other members of the Requiem Group had a change of expression when they saw this scene.

They did not expect that this young girl would directly attack and be so ruthless.

“You…” Liu Kun’s lips trembled. Watching this scene, his back somehow felt cold.

It’s my turn. Lin Xiu looked at Liu Kun, his eyes narrowed, and said.

“Courting death!” Although he was shocked that Luo Yue killed his subordinates in an instant, Liu Kun was also furious at this time.

He was the captain of a team that has been in Thunder Valley for so many years, will he fall into the hands of two little kids?!

He shouted angrily and the saber in his hand attacked Lin Xiu’s body!

Dang–

When he moved at this time, Lin Xiu’s dark edge spear resisted his blow, then he immediately used the ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

Liu Kun’s face was full of horror. He never thought that Lin Xiu would stab out at the same time.

“‘Sphere’!!!”

At this time, Liu Kun had no time to think so much. He roared abruptly and a light blue circular shield suddenly appeared around his body, enclosing his body.

Bang bang bang——

The spear tip madly pierced his ‘Sphere’, making a sound after another.

The powerful impact force caused Liu Kun’s body to retreat continuously.

Lin Xiu was holding a long spear in both hands and with a sudden force, Liu Kun, who was wrapped in the “Sphere”, was like a round ball. Being struck by the dark edge spear, he flew out and smashed against the trees at the back.

Those very tough trees broke and fell to the ground after getting knocked against by Liu Kun.

Lin Xiu didn’t stop the movement of his feet at this time. He used force on his legs and sprinted forward.

And after sprinting for a certain distance, Lin Xiu’s body instantly jumped high!

“You… don’t come over…”

The remaining people in the Requiem Group watched Luo Yue walking slowly with the blood-stained sword and their eyes were full of horror.
