Chapter 217: Gold Skill- ‘Sand Rock Wall‘

Lin Xiu snorted coldly, ignoring them.

He held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and attacked Ouyang Hang!

Ouyang Hang was startled and he wanted to block the attack with the silver spear in his hand.

“‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!!!”

But the moment the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand thrust over, it was transformed into dozens of illusions!

The cold light on the tip of the spear seemed to sparkle.

Dang dang dang——

The pupils in Ouyang Hang’s eyes constricted slightly and the spear in his hand reacted very quickly to block.

This was not an illusion, every hit was real!

But Lin Xiu’s ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ skill was really terrifying. In just one second, he stabbed over a dozen times!

Ouyang Hang’s reaction has reached the extreme, but Lin Xiu still stabbed him in the body.

Bang bang bang——

Although the spear tip hadn’t pierced his combat suit that had a very strong defense, he was still injured and blood flowed from the suit.

Ouyang Hang opened his eyes wide in disbelief.

Since he became a warrior, he had never suffered this kind of injury!?

And he was actually hurt by a student of Class 10 of the South Campus!

This shame immediately angered him.

“You’re courting death!!!”

Ouyang Hang yelled and the source strength in his body burst out suddenly.

Boom——

The ground around them shook and the wind was strong.

Lin Xiu frowned. This Ouyang Hang actually exploded with such powerful source strength, the situation seemed a bit weird.

Click, click, click——

Ouyang Hang’s body made a strange sound at this moment as if his bones were changing.

Lin Xiu took a closer look and noticed that his muscles were swelling up at this time!

“Go to hell!” The veins of Ouyang Hang’s body protruded, he held the silver spear with both hands, and with a sudden force on his legs, he attacked Lin Xiu!

He actually left a pair of footprints at the spot he was standing at just now!

What a terrifying speed!

Before Lin Xiu had time to react, Ouyang Hang appeared in front of him!

Dang——

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear with both hands and blocked immediately!

Ouyang Hang’s attack was so powerful that even Lin Xiu’s hand was getting a little numb.

Lin Xiu wasn’t afraid, the blood in his body was boiling instead.

The two fought frantically.

As the spears collided, loud noises resounded and gave off a lot of sparks.

The other three people in Class 3 of the North Campus were surprised to see this scene.

One must know that Ouyang Hang was the number one student in the North Campus and Lin Xiu, a member of Class 10 of the South Campus, was equally matched with him at battle!

He was simply too strong, huh?!

If the three of them attacked Lin Xiu as well, they would probably be able to get rid of him quickly.

But they knew Ouyang Hang’s temperament and they certainly didn’t want to. Right now, they could only watch.

“Hng, didn’t expect that your strength is nothing more than this.” Tian Zixia was fighting Luo Yue with a long sword at this time, seemingly at ease.

After keeping watch the entire night yesterday, Luo Yue wasn’t in the best state mentally. At this time, while fighting Tian Zixia and listening to her mocking words, Luo Yue’s expression remained unchanged.

“Is that so?”

As she spoke, her swordsmanship became even sharper.

Swish——

The thin long sword slashed forward and a deep crack suddenly appeared on the ground!

What a terrifying sword aura!

The sword aura generated by covering the long sword with source strength was simply too powerful.

Tian Zixia accidentally cut off a few strands of her long hair.

“Go to hell!!!” Tian Zixia was shocked and attacked Luo Yue with the long sword in her hand again!

Luo Yue moved slightly and dodged.

Although she was not in her peak state, with her own combat experience, even Tian Zixia, who was currently stronger than her, couldn’t do anything to her.

The battle between the two seemed to be equally matched.

Boom——

While Lin Xiu was fighting with Ouyang Hang, the tip and the body of the spear began to have small flames.

Ouyang Hang, who was fighting with Lin Xiu with a silver spear, clearly felt something was wrong.

He felt that it was getting hot!

What was happening!?

He looked to the front and saw the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand. He wasn’t sure when flames began appearing!

When his silver spear collided with Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear, the entire silver spear became scorching hot due to the flames!

‘Awe of the Phoenix’!!!

Before he could react, Lin Xiu directly held his spear and continued to attack!

A large number of flaming birds flew out and flames covered the sky!!!

What is this!? At this time, not only Ouyang Hang, but the guys in Class 1 of the North Campus were stunned.

The temperature of this flaming bird was extremely high, so high that it seemed like it could even cause the surrounding air to become distorted!

These flaming birds cut through the sky and rushed towards Ouyang Hang!

Although Ouyang Hang was using a spear as well, he has never seen all the skills used by Lin Xiu before!

Damn it!

“Gold skill- ‘Sand Rock Wall’!!!” Ouyang Hang gritted his teeth, his eyes widened, and his spear thrust directly into the ground.

Boom——

The whole ground caved in instantly and all the dirt on the ground gathered together, then formed a sphere to surround his body!

Bang bang bang——

The flaming birds rushed over there and they were surrounded by the spheres made of soil!

“Hng! If you hide inside, I will cook you directly!” Lin Xiu snorted and waved the spear again.

Those flaming birds rushed over there in an instant!

A large number of flaming birds gathered together and formed a huge flaming tornado, crashing against the sphere covering Ouyang Hang’s body!

Boom boom——

“Ouyang Hang!!!” Tian Zixia, who was fighting with Luo Yue, saw this scene and her expression changed. She wanted to rush towards Ouyang Hang!

Dang–

But Luo Yue didn’t give her the chance to and the long sword in her hand pierced Tian Zixia’s body!

Fortunately, Tian Zixia’s ability to react was fast, otherwise, Luo Yue’s long sword would have penetrated her body! Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Boom——

At this time, as the flaming tornado continued to spin, the huge sphere composed of mud exploded instantly!

“Lin Xiu! I going to smash you into pieces!!!”
