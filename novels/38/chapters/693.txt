Chapter 694 Lu Jiang’s Strength

Lu Jiang’s eyes became extremely sharp, and the strength of his whole body burst out at this moment. ,

He would use his strongest power to directly crush Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu, who clearly felt this situation, had a change of expression on his face. This Lu Jiang was different from the previous warriors. He didn’t have any hidden strength at all, and the strength of his whole body burst out at this moment.

Obviously he wanted to kill Lin Xiu directly.

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate at all at this time, and the source strength of his whole body was also mobilized.

At this moment, the Dark Edge spear in his hand also burst into dazzling light.

“How dare you resist!”

Seeing the powerful source strength that burst out from Lin Xiu’s body, Lu Jiang became even angrier at this moment.

The long sword he was holding instantly stabbed in front of Lin Xiu!

The power of this sword was too great, and a huge sound broke through the air.

Lin Xiu was focused, watching the terrifying sword he stabbed, without any panic.

The Dark Edge spear in his hand emitting a dazzling light directly resisted it!

Boom–

With a loud noise, the two weapons collided, as if a huge explosion occurred, and at the next moment, they took a dozen steps back at the same time.

Both of them stepped on the edge of the competition stage, preventing themselves from flying out.

“This guy is actually able to fight against Lu Jiang!?”

The warriors who watched this scene below were all amazed at this moment.

Because Lu Jiang was the seventh person on the Tianjiao list but he wasn’t able to knock Lin Xiu down directly.

“He doesn’t seem too weak.”

Lu Jiang stared at Lin Xiu, then said with a sneer.

Just now, he thought that he could blast Lin Xiu directly, but he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu really had such strength.

At this time, with a wave of the long sword in his hand, the original sword turned into two swords.

Holding both hands, he looked at Lin Xiu, his eyes were full of killing intent.

“Here it goes! It seems that Lu Jiang is serious now!”

“This is Lu Jiang’s double sword flow!”

“Today, you won’t leave here alive.”

Lu Jiang looked at Lin Xiu and said proudly.

“We still don’t know who’s going to live.”

Lin Xiu sneered, and in the next moment, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he charged directly towards Lu Jiang!

After the ‘Without a Trace’ body art started, Lin Xiu’s figure was like a phantom, and it was astonishingly fast! “Humph!”

Lu Jiang snorted coldly, and charged with a long sword in both hands!

The two long swords was monstrous, and after his unique moves, it seemed that the two swords and the human were one. “The Flowing Milky Way’!!!”

Lu Jiang roared angrily, the two swords flew out of his hands, and turned into stars all over the sky, all charging towards Lin Xiu who was in front of him!

This seemingly beautiful starry sky was indeed full of terrifying power.

If it was an ordinary warrior, he would have been bombarded into slag long ago.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu has directly unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

The dark red ‘Sphere’, like a dark red flame, enveloped Lin Xiu’s body. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

Boom

Those energies that were like stars in the sky all hit Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, making a huge sound.

“Blocked!?”

When these people saw this scene, the expressions in their eyes showed incomparable surprise.

“Damn!”

When Lu Jiang saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed slightly, because he never thought that Lin Xiu’s “Sphere” would easily resist all of his attacks, and he was not injured at all.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but heaved a sigh of relief at this time. The power of Lu Jiang’s skill was very powerful. There was no way to dodge on the competition stage.

He could only use his ‘Sphere’ to resist.

Just when he was resisting, he triggered the power of the warrior title, offsetting half of the power! Therefore, his skills didn’t work on Lin Xiu at all.

“You are also a rank 9 warrior?”

At this time, Lu Jiang’s eyes became more and more cautious.

He originally thought that he could easily kill Lin Xiu, but he did not expect that Lin Xiu would resist all of his blows.

This was beyond his expectations.

“What do you think?” Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Humph!”

Lu Jiang’s face became nastier and nastier, and the double swords that just flew out returned to his hands.

Before he could make a move, he saw flames one after another, charging towards him! “Huh? This skill again?”

Qian Jin on the other side of the competition stage, watching this scene, showed a look of interest on his face.

Qian Jin was very curious about this ‘Awe of the Phoenix’. This kind of strength was powerful and it didn’t seem to be a skill that consumed much energy, which made him very curious.

Is this the skill from Earth

“What is this!?”

When Lu Jiang saw the flaming birds charging towards him, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

The power of this flaming bird was so great that even the surrounding air seemed to be distorted.

Lu Jiang didn’t have time to think too much at this time, he also unfolded the “Sphere” of his body, completely resisting those flaming birds. But even so, Lu Jiang felt that his whole body was extremely hot. It’s like being in a furnace.

Damn, what kind of skill is this!?

And at this moment, he clearly saw a cold light charging towards him.

It was Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear.

Lin Xiu rushed over with a long spear. The head of the spear was full of cold light, and there was a large amount of black matter emitting from the spear’s body. Slowly, it turned into a black giant dragon! “Get away from me!!!”

Lu Jiang felt a sense of oppression that he had never felt before, and now he knew that he could no longer continue defending like this. If he continued like this, even if he resisted, he would be thrown out of the competition stage!

The source strength on Lu Jiang’s body burst out again, and the two swords burst out with a strong light.

The light was so bright that all the warriors narrowed their eyes.

‘Splitting Mountain Divine Sword’!!!

The two swords in Lu Jiang’s hand formed a cross and the terrifying sword aura charged directly!

The black giant dragon that rushed over from Lin Xiu was directly dissipated by this terrifying cross sword aura!

The surrounding warriors exclaimed in surprise. Just when they thought that Lin Xiu would also be cut into several pieces by this terrifying cross sword aura, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand moved and made a strange arc.

As a ray of light burst out, the cross sword aura turned and charged towards Lu Jiang!

“Impossible!!!”
