Chapter 253: Hunted to Hunter I

Guo Ling was stunned when she saw the person charge forward.

‘Isn’t that Lin Xiu?’

“Trying to die!” Qiu Li spoke up when he saw Lin Xiu rush ahead.

Even rank 6 warriors with spheres were suffering from the barrage of laser beams. Wasn’t Lin Xiu looking to die as a rank 5 warrior? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

All the others had the same thought, the laser beams started to aim at Lin Xiu.

White beams shot towards Lin Xiu’s direction as he charged at the assailants.

Lin Xiu held Dark Edge in his right hand and moved his body continuously to avoid the laser beams.

All of the laser beams were an inch away from him, but none managed to land a hit.

“How is that possible!”

Everyone was stunned by his movements.

He was actually able to avoid the dense mass of laser beams.

Lin Xiu did not move extremely fast, but it looked as though he had some instinct to sense and avoid the laser beams with ease.

Guo Ling and the others were shocked.

Although the gravity room in class had the training to avoid laser beams, they were not able to imitate Lin Xiu and have such reaction speed.

Lin Xiu charged to the front and swung Dark Edge at the men who had dropped from the tree!

“Damn it!”

Their eyes changed as they threw their laser rifles to the ground and immediately drew their dual blades from their backs.

Clank clank clank-

Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge clashed with their weapons and produced metallic collision sounds.

They were evidently rank 5 warriors and immediately felt the power of Lin Xiu’s attacks as their hands turned numb from the collision.

Lin Xiu did not stop his momentum and stabbed forward quickly after avoiding all the remaining laser beams!

Bang-

One of the assailants had his dual blades flung out of his hands by the impact and the spear went through his body!

Blood sprayed everywhere.

His other four comrades were shocked, they did not expect Lin Xiu to be so strong.

Lin Xiu stared at them with cold eyes as though he was looking at dead people.

Dark Edge continued to move with its immense power. The assailants tried to use their weapons to block but they were repelled away as well.

The spearhead went through another two assailants’ bodies!

As he killed them, Lin Xiu could hear the system notifying him of the experience points.

But compared to the experience points needed to level up, the experience gained was far too little for him to bother.

“We’re going too!” Guo Ling watched Lin Xiu kill three of the assailants in shock and jumped down from her mount as she leaped over.

Bang bang bang-

She activated Sphere to block the incoming laser beams and charged ahead.

But the laser beams were too concentrated and the powerful impact caused Guo Ling’s advancement to become extremely slow.

“Kill him!”

Right at this time, Lin Xiu was in the middle of jumping up a tree. The warriors that were still hiding on top exclaimed out loud and threw their laser rifles and drew their melee weapons. They engaged in melee combat on top of the trees!

Their weapons emitted cold auras and produced vacuum explosions as they slashed downwards.

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu snorted and swung Dark Edge Spear while jumping upwards.

Flames surged out from the body of the spear to the tip and gushed outwards!

Rumble-

The flames transformed into a gigantic blazing bird upon release!

The air around started to distort due to the high temperatures.

All the leaves that the blazing bird touched turned to black.

“What is that!?” All the people in the air with their weapons that were thinking of killing Lin Xiu exclaimed out loud.

They wanted to dodge, but the blazing bird seemed to be locked onto them and struck them right on their bodies!

“Ah!!!”

They immediately felt the burning pain when the flames touched them. Their hair got burnt off and their skin charred black.

The immense pain caused them to fall to the ground.

But the flames did not disappear and more blazing birds swooped down to attack them.

A large blazing tornado immediately formed!

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing rank 5 warrior, obtaining 12000000 experience points!”

“Congratulations Master for killing rank 5 warrior…”

Notification sounds came out endlessly.

‘How many rank 5 warriors do I need to kill to reach 4 billion experience points if each one of them only provides 12000000 experience points?’

“Kill that brat!!!”

The people hiding in the trees were infuriated.

Lin Xiu had killed more than 8 of them in a short span of time!

All of them were rank 5 warriors. The deaths of so many of them had greatly impacted the strength of their team.

When the order was given, all the men dressed in the same clothes jumped down with various weapons!

They had used their tried and tested method of using laser rifles to kill warriors from long distances all the time, but they never expected Lin Xiu to break through their tactic.

Since laser beams could not hit him, using the laser rifles had become pointless.

They could only resort to close combat!

“Very good! Watch as I get rid of you all!” Qiu Li and the others were furious about the laser beams and with them gone, they jumped off their mounts and brandished their weapons!

All the remaining members of the team charged towards Lin Xiu’s side!
