Chapter 664: One Hit Kill!

Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

Profound Intent!

When a skill has been cultivated to its maximum level and if the warrior using it is powerful, it would get even more terrifying!

As Lin Xiu pierced his spear forward, there were hundreds of its figures appearing in the air. The tip of the spears had a cold, horrifying aura. The elder from the Zhuo started feeling afraid when he saw the spears right in front of him. He quickly gathered his energy and released his ‘Yuan’.

As he shouted, he was trying to re-enforce his ‘Yuan’ so that he could defend this horrible skill.

However, at that moment, he could hear crackling sounds around him and he noticed that there were holes all over his ‘Yuan’!

The old man widened his eyes in shock. As he looked down on himself, he realised that there were dozens of bloody holes all over his body.

“You…”

He widened his eyes in shock. He couldn’t believe until now that Lin Xiu’s strength could be so powerful.

He was a rank 9 warrior but he ended up in such a state.

Boom —

Lin Xiu did not hesitate. He continued attacking with his spear and it went through the old man’s head, causing it to explode immediately.

One hit kill!

The system in his mind had tons of notifications and it looks like he had an upgrade too.

However, Lin Xiu did not care about it. His eyes were cold and as he thought of the image of a wounded Luo Yue, he turned around towards the warriors behind him.

‘There were countless warriors running towards him.

These warriors had fear in their eyes as they stared at Lin Xiu. Even when they had surrounded him, none of them dared to attack Lin Xiu.

“Go to hell!”

Nan Huang’s grandfather, who was still occupied with Luo Yan, was getting irritated. He grasped onto his sword and immediately threw his sword like a dagger towards Luo Yan!

At that moment, with both his hands in the air, hundreds of these swords immediately appeared and all of them were headed towards Luo Yan!

Luo Yan had a bad feeling about it when she saw what was happening. She immediately turned around and ran.

With such a strong warrior skill, it would be impossible for her to block it now.

If she tried to block it with her protective shield, there was a possibility that her ‘Yuan’ would break and she could be injured!

“HMPH!!!”

Seeing how Luo Yan had already fled because of his skills, his eyes turned to the other side.

‘There was a large number of warriors surrounding Lin Xiu but none of them were attacking him. He frowned and leaped forward towards Lin Xiu.

“Old man, what’s wrong? You can’t even finish a kid?”

‘When Nan Huang’s grandfather landed next to the elder from the Jiang family, he asked the man who was holding onto his hammer as his eyes were still locked onto Lin Xiu.

The elder from the Jiang family did not bother with the sarcasm from Nan Huang’s grandfather. Instead, he said, “Zhuo Lin’s dead.”

Zhuo Lin was the old man that was just killed by Lin Xiu.

He was a powerful rank 9 warrior.

“WHAT?!”

‘When he heard what was said, his eyes were searching the ground and he then noticed the body that was lying cold on the ground.

‘As expected, that was Zhuo Lin’s body.

“He…” Nan Huang was stunned. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

The three of them were enemies but were also friends since they were the heads of the oldest family in Sky City. When he saw Zhuo Lin’s body, he still felt sadness deep inside.

“The young man was the one who killed him.”

‘The elder from the Jiang family tightened his grip on the hammer as he told what happened.

His body had started trembling because Lin Xiu’s condition now was indeed terrifying.

No….it was extremely horrifying.

“Kill him!”

Nan Huang looked over at the young man who was covered in a bright white glow, looking as if he was a god that had descended on earth.

As he commanded, there were large numbers of military drones and fighter aircraft that flew in the sky. There were laser beams and explosives that were all aimed at Lin Xiu!

Koong Loong ~ – Koong Loong ~~

At the spot where Lin Xiu was at, there were explosions one after another. The warriors who were next to Lin Xiu had already taken a step back but there were still a few of them who were badly injured by the explosions.

‘These explosions have corrosive ingredients in them. This was why the ‘Yuan’ couldn’t protect them as well.

In order to kill Lin Xiu, Nan Huang’s grandfather had gone mad.

Nan Huang was his favourite grandson. Now that he was killed by Lin Xiu, this old man was completely filled with rage.

As the smoke around the area disappeared, Nan Huang’s grandfather and the elder from the Jiang family then noticed that Lin Xiu’s body had gone missing!

‘What happened?!

‘With the explosives just now, it wouldn’t have turned Lin Xiu’s body into ashes!

“LOOK! ABOVE YOU!”

‘As they looked up, Lin Xiu was already in the air. The moon was shining brightly behind him which made him look even scarier.

Lin Xiu was in the air with the Dark Edge spear in his arms. There were hundreds of flaming birds that rushed out of his spear, acting like automatic tracing missiles. All of them were headed towards the drones and the fighter aircraft!

Koong Loong – – Koong Loong ~ –

As the drones got hit by these flaming birds, they gave out a loud explosion.

All of them were completely destroyed.

As Lin Xiu landed back onto the ground, his eyes looked forward and stared at Nan Huang’s grandfather who was standing right in front of him.

“Next, it’s your turn.”

Lin Xiu raised the spear in his arm that was still covered in blood, aiming it towards Nan Huang’s grandfather.

“Arrogant!”

When he noticed how crazy Lin Xiu was acting, he screamed. He raised his left arm and looked at the sword on the ground that belonged to the elder from the Zhuo family. As he called it with his source energy, the sword then landed on his arm.

He grabbed onto the sword and leaped upwards using both his legs, full force. Then, he immediately appeared inches away from Lin Xiu!

‘The sword in his arm was coming from above, about to chop Lin Xiu into two equal parts!

Clang -—

However, Lin Xiu was faster. He had already blocked the attack with his spear.

It was followed by a large surge of lightning that covered Lin Xiu’s spear. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Sizzling -—

‘The lightning that was even scarier than the high voltage energy was travelling towards Nan Huang’s grandfather!

‘The old man was surprised. He could feel the sharp pain all over his body. He couldn’t believe what he was seeing with his eyes.

How is this even possible?!

This brat was giving out such powerful currents and he could stand them!

Lin Xiu was still thinking about how Luo Yue was injured and he had no idea if she was alive. There was only one thing that he wanted…. He wanted them dead!

As the other party was distracted by the current that he released, he turned the spear and pushed away the sword that was above his head. The tip of the spear that was now covered in lightning was about to hit the centre of the old man’s forehead!
