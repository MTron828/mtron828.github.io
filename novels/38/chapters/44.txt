Chapter 45: Besieged

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The blade drew a bit of blood that splattered across his face.

But the shocking fact was that the blade was stuck in the neck of the Sabertooth Hound and did not slice through cleanly! How was that possible?!

In his disbelief, the Sabertooth Hound took the opportunity and opened its jaws to bite down!

“Be careful!!!” Xu Wen ran forward, but the Sabertooth Hound was faster than him.

The bite went through the man’s neck and ruptured an artery. This caused a massive amount of blood loss.

The man struggled for a bit before losing his last breath.

A warrior had just died like that!

Xu Wen’s pupils constricted as he witnessed the scene before using the blade in his right hand to hack down at the Sabertooth Hound’s body.

Dang!

In that instant, the Sabertooth Hound’s right claws blocked and collided with his blade and unleashed a sharp metal collision sound.

How sharp!

“Roar!!!”

The Sabertooth Hound roared and caused their minds to tremble. At the same time, the blade that was stuck in its neck was flung out.

The wound quickly stopped bleeding.

With a smash, the warrior’s head beneath its legs was smashed into meat pulp.

It did not stop and pounced right at Xu Wen.

Lin Xiu charged forward and thrust his spear. The spear was so quick and instantly struck it.

But it suddenly swerved its body and dodged his spear!

What?!

How could it be so fast!

While in shock, Lin Xiu reacted in time and retreated.

The soldiers behind ran forward and launched a barrage of laser beams on the Sabertooth Hound’s body!

“It’s useless!” Xu Wen saw their actions and shouted to them while dodging the Sabertooth Hound’s attack.

“Sou sou sou” The sound of laser beams resonated and struck the Sabertooth Hound.

But the expected destruction of its body like how the lasers were effective on the zombies did not occur, instead they only left grazes on its body.

“It’s really a rank 3 evolved beast...”

A few soldiers clenched their jaws when they witnessed the ineffectiveness of their guns and kept them in the bags.

Evolved beasts above rank 3 had toughened skin that was impervious to laser beams.

Without a choice, they took out their unique metal weapons and charged at the Sabertooth Hound.

“Rending Slash!” Xu Wen bellowed and used both hands to perform a slash in the air!

The slash unleashed an air blade that left an extremely deep wound upon hitting the Sabertooth Hound’s foreleg that revealed its bone.

Lin Xiu snorted and unleashed the technique he had just learned – Torrential storm of rose flowers.

Although it was far from the real Torrential storm of rose flowers, he was able to unleash three stabs in a second. Unlike the Awe of the Phoenix, Torrential storm of rose flowers was based on his physique and the quick succession of stabs. It utilized less source strength and was less of a burden on his body. The Awe of the Phoenix would not be powerful without imbuing source strength and would require more exertion.

Bang bang bang!

Cold auras flashed as Lin Xiu’s three stabs emerged. Aside from one that missed, the other two stabbed into the Sabertooth Hound’s eye and ear. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

The eye exploded and the ear was immediately pierced through. As though having felt immense pain, it suddenly became even more berserk.

It opened its large mouth and revealed two extremely long and sharp ivory fangs.

It wanted to attack Lin Xiu, but Xu Wen provoked it from the other side. When it wanted to attack Xu Wen, Lin Xiu would land another attack on it.

Meanwhile, the other soldiers had charged forward. Although it was a rank 3 evolved beast, it was besieged by many warriors.

“Roar!!!’

More wounds quickly appeared on its body as the warriors continued their barrage of attacks. At this time, it suddenly roared and raised its upper body and stood on two legs.

“Crap, it’s going to use its ability!” Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted when he saw it. Evolved beasts above rank 3 could use special abilities. Who would have thought that the Sabertooth Hound would have one of its own?

Although they did not know what ability it was, its decision to utilize it in this situation meant that it would be dangerous.

Upon hearing Lin Xiu’s remark, the soldiers quickly retreated.

The Sabertooth Hound’s eyes turned blood red as it pounced right at Lin Xiu.

It had become even faster!

But Lin Xiu was prepared for it and dodged to the side.

Bang!!!

It used its front claw to smack the ground that resulted in a large crack and cloud full of smoke.

It was much stronger and was without a doubt the ability that the Sabertooth Hound possessed when in peril. It was able to unleash 150 percent power from its original strength.

As though it had determined Lin Xiu as its opponent, it started attacking him. Very quickly, Lin Xiu’s body had a long scratch wound.

The immense pain caused Lin Xiu to frown.

‘I actually got hurt?! Damn it!’

After doing a few rolls and avoiding the enemy, Lin Xiu stood up.

He had no other choice but to use that move.

“Awe of the Phoenix!!!” Just as it was about to pounce on him, Lin Xiu suddenly roared out loud with both hands clasping the spear.

He originally did not plan to use the move as it was overly exhausting, but he had no other choice!

A large flaming bird erupted from his spear!

The flaming bird flew straight at the Sabertooth Hound. The flaming bird immediately transformed into a fiery coiling dragon when they collided and started to twirl.

As the Sabertooth Hound already had multiple wounds on its body, the flames immediately burned its hair and burned its way into the Sabertooth Hound’s body through the old wounds.

“Roar!!!” The excruciating pain caused the Sabertooth Hound to howl loudly.

“Chance!” Xu Wen immediately unleashed multiple Rending slashes.

“Asura slash!”

“Shadow strike!”

“...”

The other warriors took the opportunity and unleashed all their skills!
