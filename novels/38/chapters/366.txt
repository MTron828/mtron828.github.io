Chapter 367: The Powerful Old Man

This time the speed of the man with the broken arm seemed to have reached the extreme, and he appeared in front of Lin Xiu in an instant.

Looking at the light blue light, the sharp dagger was about to pierce his body, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank suddenly.

At this critical moment, without any hesitation, Lin Xiu directly activated the ‘Fury’ skill!

The moment the ‘Fury’ skill had been activated, Lin Xiu’s abilities improved greatly.

Swish——

Originally, his dagger was about to pierce Lin Xiu’s body, but at this moment, Lin Xiu dodged easily.

And while dodging, the Dark Edge spear in his hand pierced the man’s body directly.

Zizi——

But the man with the broken arm reacted swiftly. At this time, holding the dagger in his hand, he directly blocked Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear.

The tip of the spear collided with his dagger, producing many sparks.

“You have taken the medicine!?” The man with a severed arm looked at Lin Xiu with cold eyes and said.

Lin Xiu’s strength just now was completely different from the previous time, as if he suddenly became a lot stronger.

This shouldn’t be Lin Xiu’s intentional preservation of strength, but to be able to become so strong in this short period of time, he must have taken the Forbidden Medicine!

Lin Xiu sneered and ignored his words as his Dark Edge spear continued to pierce towards the man’s body!

Under the state of ‘Fury’, Lin Xiu’s strength has been raised to a peak rank 6 warrior.

Coupled with Lin Xiu’s original strength, his combat effectiveness was very strong.

“Go to hell!!!”

The man with the broken arm heard Lin Xiu’s sneer. At this time, he felt as if he had been taunted by a low-level warrior and became furious.

While dodging the attack of Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear, the dagger in his right hand stabbed Lin Xiu again!

Swish——

After the battle just now, Lin Xiu also has a certain understanding of the warriors who use this kind of close combat weapon.

At this time, Lin Xiu directly backed away and moved a distance away from the man. Then in the next moment, the Dark Edge Spear in his hand continued to pierce the man!

The pupils in the eyes of the man with the broken arm constricted suddenly. If there’s a distance, it would be very difficult to cause damage to Lin Xiu.

And Lin Xiu had also clearly discovered this, so every time he attacked, Lin Xiu created a distance, then turned back and stabbed him with the Dark Edge Spear. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Damn kid!

Although the man with the broken arm was very upset, he gritted his teeth, stopped, and continued to stab Lin Xiu’s body, then stepped back to avoid Lin Xiu’s attack.

But at this moment, from the corner of his eye, he saw a cold light flashing by his side.

What is this!?

Swish——

Before he got back to his senses, a long sword pierced from his side, directly into his clothes, and along his chest.

If he hadn’t reacted quickly, he would just be a few millimeters away from having the sword pierce through his body!

“It’s you!?”

As soon as the man with the broken arm turned around, he saw Luo Yue next to him.

Luo Yue was expressionless at this time, the long sword in her hand was drawn out and she continued stabbing him!

He lost an arm and his strength has dropped a lot.

Not to mention that Lin Xiu has now activated the ‘Fury’ skill, and his overall strength has reached its peak.

Dang–

The man with the broken arm saw the sword that Luo Yue thrust and he blocked it with his dagger instinctively.

But Luo Yue’s sword was really too strong and the man’s hand that was holding the dagger was numb. In the next moment, the dagger in his hand suddenly flew out.

“‘Awe of the phoenix’!!!”

Just when there was a look of panic on his face, Lin Xiu’s roar came from the other side.

He looked to the side instinctively only to see flaming birds charging towards him!

He couldn’t dodge them!

Boom——

As the flaming birds hit his body, there was a loud noise and the ground shook.

All the surrounding things were shaken off and a large amount of gravel rushed over, causing Lin Xiu to block his eyes with his arm.

The flaming birds turned into a tornado of flames, surrounded the man with the broken arm, spinning frantically.

“Ah!!!”

The man with the broken arm let out a roar, struggling frantically in the flames.

In the next moment, his struggling voice became smaller, and the flames began to gradually decrease.

Boom——

With another explosive sound, the flame disappeared instantly and the man with the broken arm was burned into a charred corpse.

Bang–

Seeing this, Lin Xiu’s body also felt a little tired and his Dark Edge spear stabbed into the ground.

“Luo Yue…” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue and when he was about to say something, he saw Luo Yue looking straight ahead, with a rare hint of surprise in her eyes.

What happened!?

Lin Xiu was taken aback. At this time, he subconsciously looked in front of him and immediately saw the figure of the old man and the men in black lying on the ground.

Damn!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but curse.

Because Lin Xiu had just felt the strength of the men in black, they should be even stronger than the strength of the man with a severed arm.

But what I didn’t expect was that the men in black were knocked down by the ordinary-looking old man!

“I’m old, I haven’t moved for a long time.” At this time, the old man moved his body and stretched, cracking his joints.

He looked towards the front, and there was a man in black at the last that hadn’t fallen down.

The man in black looked at the old man and clenched the box in his hand tightly.

Seeing his comrades on the ground and wailing with their joints twisted, cold sweat dripped from his forehead.

‘Strong, he is too strong.’

‘Who is this old man!?’

At the next moment, he carried the box and rushed to the safe passage on the side!

Flee!
