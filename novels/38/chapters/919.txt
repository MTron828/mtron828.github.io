Chapter 920: Stairs

The warriors behind Lin Xiu also clearly trembled when they saw this scene.

“Go over!”

These people from the black troop ignored them and escorted Lin Xiu and the others over there.

Sitting with the people from the white troop.

“Feng Zheng, haven’t you succeeded yet?”

The middle-aged man looked at another black-clothed warrior and said aloud.

“No, most of them can only go to the second floor.”

The warrior known as Feng Zheng shook his head and said.

There were ten steps of stairs leading to the high place above.

Each step was very high.

There is a space high above and there seems to be something in it.

But you can’t see it from this position, you can only see a group of light.

But everyone can imagine that in this kind of place, there is nothing else except the secret treasure.

“continue!”

The middle-aged man continued to speak at this time.

.....

“Yes!”

At this moment, there is another warrior in the white troop being escorted to this step.

“I don’t want, I don’t want to go up!”

The warrior in white saw the tragic state of the warrior who went up before and his face became extremely ugly.

He tried to run away.

But at this moment, Feng Zheng directly held the sword and chopped the man in half.

Blood spurted onto his cheeks instantly.

He wiped the blood on his cheeks, then looked at Lin Xiu and the others who had just come over and said, “Whoever disobeys will end up like this.”

The warriors behind Lin Xiu’s body couldn’t help but tremble at this moment.

“If anyone can go up and take the things on it, we will not only let you go, but also give you something nice.”

“Just take a good look at it, how to go up correctly!”

Feng Zheng continued to speak.

“Next, come on!”

He glanced around, then pointed to a warrior next to Lin Xiu and said.

As soon as his words fell, the warrior’s neck had a knife directly wrapped around it and he walked forward.

Although this warrior was extremely fearful in his heart, he was even more afraid when he thought about the body of the warrior that was sliced in half.

“I can go up, I can go up...”

His body was trembling, but he still comforted himself in his heart.

Looking at the dazzling staircase, he took a deep breath, then with a thought, he flew up directly toward it!

He raised his brows and stepped onto the stairs, but chose to use the levitation technique to fly up directly!

When Feng Zheng saw this scene, a strange smile appeared on the corner of his mouth.

“So that’s it, just fly up, huh...”

When some warriors saw this scene, they seemed to have a sudden realization.

But just as his words fell, the flying warrior seemed to be hit by a terrifying electric current.

The body directly turned into a ball of fire, then instantly burned into slag.

The warrior who thought this was a good method just now opened his eyes wide and his body trembled.

“I forgot to tell you, this method, we have already tried it, it won’t work.”

Feng Zheng said to the crowd with a faint smile.

“Now, continue to go up until you find a way!”

As Feng Zheng ordered people one by one, the warriors who were ordered had to step on the stairs.

But all the warriors, without exception, all died on the stone stairs.

This stone stairs seems to contain some kind of terrifying power, that these warriors can be easily killed even if they unfold the ‘Sphere’.

Hu Ling saw that he was only left with a small number of warriors and his face became ugly.

.

“now you!”

Feng Zheng looked at a warrior in a white troop and said aloud.

“No, I’m not going! I’m not going!”

The warrior’s body trembled.

Once you go up, you will be dead!

“Why, do you want to die?” Feng Zheng’s mouth curled up slightly and the whole expression looked a little intimidating.

The white-robed warrior trembled, feeling like he was going to pee.

However, when he looked to the side, he clearly saw Lin Xiu.

“It’s you!?”

When he saw Lin Xiu at this time, he couldn’t help but exclaimed.

“Oh? Do you know each other?”

When Feng Zheng saw this scene, he immediately became interested.

“It’s him, it’s him who killed the people in your black troop!”

“Elder Sun! You...”

A warrior on the other side suddenly had a change in expression when he heard the man’s words.

Taking a closer look, the man was the deacon of the white troop, Zhang Rin.

At the beginning, Lin Xiu rescued them unintentionally and received the Purple Gold skill Card——’Fist Ray’.

“Zhang Rin, are you saying that he killed the people in the black troop and saved you all?”

Elder Sun said loudly.

Zhang Rin’s face became extremely ugly.

Just now, he also noticed Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was a benefactor to them, after all.

He would never return one’s kindness with ingratitude.

“Oh? No wonder my men didn’t kill you guys that night. It was because of this kid.”

Feng Zheng looked at Lin Xiu, revealing a killing intent.

Lin Xiu looks very ordinary now and at most he is a warrior with some strength.

Feng Zheng also didn’t take Lin Xiu seriously.

“You two, come over.”

Feng Zheng said to Elder Sun, then pointed to Lin Xiu.

Hearing Feng Zheng’s words, Elder Sun’s face became ugly.

He thought that as long as he pointed out Lin Xiu, he would not need to step on the stairs, at least not so fast.

Unexpectedly, Feng Zheng made them both go at the same time.

Hu Ling’s eyes also turned to Lin Xiu.

She saw that the current Lin Xiu was still very calm and there was no sign of panic at all.

Even at times like this, he doesn’t seem to panic.

Is he not afraid, or...

“Go together.”

Seeing Elder Sun and Lin Xiu standing in front of the stairs at the same time, Feng Zheng said coldly.

“Damn...” Elder Sun’s eyes were full of unwillingness.

But at this time there is no way. Feng Zheng’s strength was higher than him and he had no chance of escaping.

At this time, Lin Xiu had already stepped on it.

fine?

Lin Xiu stepped onto the first floor and nothing happened. Everyone thought that Lin Xiu was going to die but found that Lin Xiu was totally fine!

Still standing on this step calmly!

“Hm?”

When Feng Zheng saw this scene, he was a little surprised.

Because the vast majority of warriors will die when they step on the first step.

Even if he stood on the first step, some accidental injuries would occur, but when Lin Xiu stood up, nothing seemed to happen!

“Your turn!”

Feng Zheng pointed at Elder Sun and said.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om
