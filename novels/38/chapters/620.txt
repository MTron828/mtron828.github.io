Chapter 621: Beg Me

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“You...” Zhou Chen heard Lin Xiu’s words at this time, his eyes widened, and he looked a little anxious.

Originally, the sudden change of gravity caused his blood to surge. In the next moment, a mouthful of blood was about to come out from his mouth, but he forcibly swallowed it back.

He wiped the little bit of blood that spilled from his mouth, then sneered at Lin Xiu and said, “Are you sure you can do it?”

“You’re the one who can’t handle it right?”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time, and at this moment, Lin Xiu had already walked in front of him.

Although Zhou Chen didn’t fall down, his legs were already starting to soften. After all, suddenly adjusting to twenty times the gravity, it was still a bit difficult to get used to in a short period of time.

“I see that your fingers are shaking. Let me press it for you.”

“Don’t be too arrogant!”

Zhou Chen said stubbornly at this time.

But his hands were indeed trembling a little now, and they were a little weak, and he couldn’t move at all.

But Lin Xiu had already reached out and pressed the button on the wall.

“Hm... how many times should I adjust it? Shall we try twenty-five times?”

At this time, Lin Xiu said as if he was talking to himself.

The hearing of the warriors were all very good. Hearing Lin Xiu’s words at this time, the expressions of the warriors in the training room suddenly changed greatly.

Twenty times felt a bit worse than death. If it reaches 25 times, they will be dead!

“If you guys don’t want to stay here, you better leave first.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

At this time, the expressions in the eyes of the surrounding warriors changed, and then they hurriedly used all their strength to walk out of this place.

“Hey you guys wouldn’t want to take the opportunity to run out, right?”

“That would be too shameful for your Interstellar Academy.”

They wanted to leave at first, but now, if they left, it would be too embarrassing!

“Don’t go too far.” Zhou Chen glared at Lin Xiu viciously and said, without the proud and smug look he had just now.

“Well, okay.”

After Lin Xiu saw that the warriors were all out, he reached out and adjusted the gravity to twenty-five times!

Pff—

Just after adjusting for less than a second, Zhou Chen was crushed to the ground, and in the next moment, he vomited out a mouthful of blood.

And his two companions did the same, blood flowed out of their mouths, and the strong sense of oppression made them feel like their internal organs were beginning to burst.

Although Lin Xiu felt a little uncomfortable at this time, it was still not as exaggerated as they were.

“Is it fun?”

Lin Xiu looked down at Zhou Chen and said aloud.

“Don’t be too pleased, you’re dead meat...” Zhou Chen gritted his teeth and said.

He wanted to support the ground with his hands and wanted to get up, but at this time he couldn’t get up at all.

Twenty-five times the gravity was like a big mountain pressing down on him.

“Then how about we stay for another hour?”

Lin Xiu smiled and said aloud.

“You...” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Zhou Chen was so angry that he spat out a mouthful of blood.

“What on earth do you want...”

He couldn’t bear it, not to mention his two companions who were about to be crushed to death because of this terrifying gravity.

“Beg me.”

Lin Xiu looked at him with coldness in his eyes.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s eyes, Zhou Chen didn’t know why, but he felt as if he had seen something terrifying, and his body trembled.

What a terrifying murderous aura!

“Please...!”

Zhou Chen felt that he was about to be crushed to death by this gravity. At this time, he gritted his teeth and roared in a low voice.

Just when he was about to faint, there was a crisp ‘pop’ sound.

The surrounding gravity instantly changed.

“Next time, don’t mess with me again.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

Then he walked straight out of the training room.

At this moment, Zhou Chen’s face was on the ground, and he was still breathing heavily.

His face was covered with sweat, and it felt as if he had stepped into the gate of hell just now.

He thought that there should be very few people who were stronger than himself in this warrior competition, but he didn’t expect to encounter a tough stubble the moment he arrived.

Boom–

As Lin Xiu opened the door of the training room, he saw Ouyang Hang and others standing outside.

“Why are you guys still standing outside?”

Lin Xiu looked at them and said with a smile.

“Damn, you didn’t kill those guys, did you?”

Seeing Lin Xiu come out, Ouyang Hang said aloud.

“Am I the devil who kills without blinking?”

Lin Xiu spread his hands helplessly and said.

“Don’t worry, they are all right. Killing the contestants in the hotel of the Warrior Union is a big offense.”

And those people didn’t really offend him, they were just a little arrogant.

Lin Xiu merely taught them a lesson this time. Next time, they wouldn’t dare to just come over and be cocky. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“What training did you have?”

Huang Zhen and Qian Yao were silent for a while, but couldn’t help asking Lin Xiu.

After these few days with Lin Xiu, the two of them became more and more surprised. Lin Xiu’s strength seemed unfathomable. Even now, they still did not fully understand Lin Xiu’s strength.

He’s too strong, twenty-five times the gravity, it’s like nothing to him.

“Mountains of swords and seas of fire, thunder, and fiery magma.”

Lin Xiu slowly said a few words, then patted them on the shoulders and walked to his room, “I’d better rest first, see you tomorrow.”

“This guy, he is indeed the most pretentious guys I have ever met.”

Ouyang Hang looked at Lin Xiu’s back and couldn’t help but muttered to himself.

Lin Xiu stopped cultivating after returning to his room at this time, because he felt that he wasn’t in the best state.

Lin Xiu felt a little uneasy that he hasn’t killed the last person on his list, the Jiang family, Jiang Feng.

Bang bang bang-

Time passed quickly. Early the next morning, when Lin Xiu was still sleeping when he heard a knock on the door.

“Who is it?”

Lin Xiu got up and looked at it. It was already seven in the morning. He opened the curtains and the dazzling sunlight came in.

Opening the door, he saw that it was Ouyang Hang.

“What’s up?”

Seeing him come so early in the morning, Lin Xiu said out of curiosity.

“Where did you go last night?”

At this time, Ouyang Hang said to Lin Xiu with a serious expression.

“Sky City Arena.”

Lin Xiu replied subconsciously.

“Are you sure? Didn’t do anything else?”
