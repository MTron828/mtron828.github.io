Chapter 847: The Orchid of Heaven

Boom –

The huge blue arm slammed into Lin Xiu’s body, but it didn’t blast Lin Xiu’s body out.

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu had already unfolded a ‘Sphere’ at this moment.

The ‘Sphere’ became blackish-blue which was very strange.

This huge blue arm slammed into the ‘Sphere’, not only did it fail to move Lin Xiu’s body, on the contrary, the blue arm seemed to be scorched by a strange dark blue flame.

This was formed by the release of Luo Tian’s source strength. At this time, he had no idea that even his source strength could be burned.

He had to quickly withdraw his source strength.

However, he was counter-attacked by the source strength and he spat out a mouthful of blood.

“How is it possible... how is it possible…”

Luo Tian opened his eyes wide, blood stained his white beard.

He couldn’t believe how this young man possessed such powerful power.

“Tell me, how do you get rid of the sequelae from the secret methods of your Luo family.”

Lin Xiu ignored Luo Tian. At this moment, he stepped on Luo Jing’s chest and said lightly.

Luo Jing struggled physically, but being stepped on by Lin Xiu, he was unable to move at all.

His eyes were fixed on Lin Xiu, his face was hideous and his eyes were full of infinite killing intent.

“Speak.”

Lin Xiu said coldly with no expression on his face.

As soon as his feet exerted a little force, Luo Jing felt a sharp pain and he vomited out a mouthful of blood.

“I won’t say anything!”

Luo Jing seemed to have difficulty talking.

“I will definitely kill you, hahaha!”

Luo Tian wanted to attack Lin Xiu on the other side, but Lin Xiu just unfolded the ‘Sphere’, he had no way of attacking at all.

He would also get caught in those terrifying flames by attacking Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ which indirectly hurts him.

“Then, I’ll kill all of your Luo family first.”

Lin Xiu stared at him, then said lightly.

As if he was saying something trivial.

“you dare!”

Before Luo Jing could speak, Luo Tian’s eyes widened in anger.

The source strength in his body was mobilized again and at this moment, there were two pairs of huge blue arms that were about to hit Lin Xiu’s body.

“Get lost.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu squinted slightly and shouted.

A powerful wave of source strength came and before Luo Tian could attack, his body was blown away.

It slammed into the wall behind.

Luo Jing’s eyes widened.

His father, Luo Tian, ??was a very powerful king warrior-level warrior.

At this time, Lin Xiu shouted so harshly and was blasted out.

“You... have you reached the Respected warrior realm?”

Luo Jing thought of an unbelievable possibility at this time, his eyes widened and his voice trembled a little.

“What do you think.”

Lin Xiu did not deny it and said lightly.

“I’ll give you another chance, otherwise, I’ll kill him first.”

As soon as he finished speaking, with the swing of the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand, a dark blue flaming bird was released with the swing of the spear.

The flaming bird flew towards Luo Tian, ??hovering above his body.

The temperature of the flame was extremely high and the surrounding air seemed to be distorted.

Now Luo Tian is injured, lying on the wall behind him, unable to dodge at all.

As long as the flaming bird swoops down, his body will be directly annihilated.

“You dare, he is Luo Yue’s grandfather!”

Under Lin Xiu’s feet, Luo Jing shouted loudly at this time.

“Is he worthy?”

Lin Xiu sneered at this time.

These Luo family members merely used Luo Yue and Luo Yan as bargaining chips.

“you...”

Luo Jing looked at Lin Xiu’s eyes full of murderous intent and couldn’t help but shudder.

Now, he has no doubt that Lin Xiu will really kill Luo Tian.

Luo Tian must not die. If Luo Tian dies, the entire Luo family will be in chaos.

People from other families in Fengyun City will also take the opportunity to attack the Luo family.

At that time, the Luo family will really be finished.

“I say...”

Luo Jing had no choice at this time. After clenching his teeth, he finally said aloud.

“There’s a limit to my patience.”

Lin Xiu stared at him and said lightly.

“The Orchid of Heaven.”

“what?”

Hearing Luo Jing’s words, Lin Xiu raised his brows.

“A special kind of flower that has the spiritual energy of heaven and earth. It is said that the ancestors of our Luo family took this flower to eliminate the sequelae of the secret art.”

“Legend?”

“This is indeed recorded in the ancient books of our Luo family.”

The expression on Luo Jing’s face did not seem to be fake.

Seeing that Lin Xiu still had a look of disbelief on his face, Luo Jing gritted his teeth, then continued to say, “A few years ago, our Luo family had a direct descendant who was also troubled by the sequelae of the secret technique.

No such flower has ever been seen on Marqi planet.”

“Now he’s dead.”

“However, it does exist in ancient books.”

“Bring the book.”

Lin Xiu raised the foot that was on Luo Jing’s chest, then said lightly.

Luo Jing got up, touched the blood on his lips, looked at Lin Xiu in front of him and the expression in his eyes changed.

“Don’t play tricks, it will take no more than ten seconds to destroy your Luo family.”

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Jing and said lightly.

“I’ll get it now.”

Luo Jing thought for a while, then said aloud.

Originally, he wanted to use the power of the Luo family to surround Lin Xiu.

But after thinking about it for a while, he felt that this method was not feasible.

The power that Lin Xiu has displayed now was really too powerful. In the face of absolute power, there was no way to do it.

On the other side, Luo Tian looked at the terrifying flaming bird hovering above his body and didn’t dare to move at all.

The incomparably hot temperature made him sweat all over his body.

Not long after, Luo Jing came over with a simple scroll.

“That’s it?”

Lin Xiu looked at the scroll in his hand and said lightly.

“Yes.”

Although Luo Jing looked very painful, he threw it towards Lin Xiu while saying it out loud.

After Lin Xiu caught it, he immediately felt a strange feeling.

This scroll seems to be made of special paper.

Although it looks very primitive now, it is really well preserved.

Lin Xiu pulled it open and saw a strange flower painted on the scroll.

The flowers look like orchids, but the colors are weird.

This was a color that he had never seen before.

In addition to being able to heal injuries, the Orchid of Heaven also has a very wonderful effect on improving the body.

The fairy flower formed by the legendary aura of heaven and earth
