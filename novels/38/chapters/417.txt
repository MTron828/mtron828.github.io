Chapter 418: Against Class 1 of the South Campus!

Yu Muchen looked at Lin Xiu at this time and said.

“En, and then?” Lin Xiu raised his brows, and then said faintly

“Aren’t you afraid?” Seeing Lin Xiu still looking so calm, Yu Muchen looked at Lin Xiu with a look of interest and said aloud.

“Afraid of? If you want to fight, I will fight.” Lin Xiu stared at him without flinching.

“Well said!” Zhang Yin and the others were also surging with rage as they said with clenched fists.

“Hahaha, very good, I look forward to your victory against Class 1 of the South campus. You will fight against Class 1 of the North campus tomorrow.” Yu Muchen seemed even more excited when he saw Lin Xiu showing no fear at all.

After laughing loudly, he left directly.

“This Ouyang Hang didn’t appear but this guy is here instead, could he be better than Ouyang Hang?” Li Ping couldn’t help but snort as he watched Yu Muchen leave.

“He is indeed better than Ouyang Hang.” Lin Xiu said indifferently.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Li Ping was taken aback, and then said, “That’s impossible, right?” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“Have you heard that a new student recently reached the 32nd floor of the Tower of Tournament? That’s him.” Lin Xiu continued.

At this time, Zhang Yin and others came to their senses and gasped, “That person is him!?”

They had also heard of the news, but when they found out that this person was actually Yu Muchen and they were shocked.

“En, let’s go, let’s fight with Class 1 of the South Campus first.” Lin Xiu nodded and proceeded directly to the field.

As Lin Xiu arrived at the field, there were already a lot of students there, and the seats around were filled.

“You’re here?” Lin Xiu walked in and saw Luo Yue standing there.

“En.” Luo Yue nodded.

“It seems that Zhuo Qixing has not appeared after losing to Lin Xiu last time, but there is a man named Zhu Jun in their class who is already a rank 6 warrior, and it seems a bit troublesome.” Zhang Yin clearly prepared well and said to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue at this time.

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu nodded and saw the stern expressions on Zhang Yin and others’ faces then he suddenly smiled, “Don’t be nervous, relax.”

“How can we not be nervous?” Zhang Yin couldn’t help but say with a wry smile when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

Although the coordination between them has been trained to be perfect, the gap between their ranks couldn’t be compensated by their coordination.

And they were against Class 1 of the South Campus.

“It’s okay, we are here.” Lin Xiu smiled and said.

“Okay, it is almost time, members of Class 1 of the South Campus, and members of Class 10 of the South Campus, please proceed to the platform!!!”

At this moment, the angry voice of the old man before was transmitted to the entire field.

“Hng, we’re finally going to fight.” Zhang Liangqian was sitting in the corner at this time, staring at the middle position.

These few days, he had watched every battle.

Because in his opinion, to deal with an enemy, you must first understand the enemy’s combat characteristics, in order to be more effective and have a higher chance of killing him.

But what made him feel uncomfortable was that for Lin Xiu, the battles these days were too easy or something.

Lin Xiu did not use skill at all but used simple spear methods to fight.

But even so, Lin Xiu led Class 10 to victory against all 8 classes.

“But today’s fight is against Class 1 and you carry those four cumbersome ones… can you still win?” Zhang Liangqian let out a sneer.

But when he saw Lin Xiu and others on the court, the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

Because he saw Luo Yue appear.

She’s fighting?

Looking at Luo Yue in the distance, he couldn’t take his eyes off her.

To tell the truth, he has never seen such a beautiful woman, and she was also so classy.

The reason why he fought Lin Xiu was also because of Luo Yue.

“Damn it!” Seeing Luo Yue standing beside Lin Xiu at this time, Zhang Liangqian’s hands couldn’t help but clenched tightly.

His eyes were filled with jealousy.

“Alright, everyone, get ready, let the match… begin!”

Following the referee’s order, the entire field was fired up.

Zhang Yin and others also immediately held the weapons in their hands, looking very cautious.

But to their surprise, the people in Class 1 of the South Campus had not moved yet.

The guy standing in the middle stared at Lin Xiu at this time.

“You are Lin Xiu, right?”

This was a guy holding a crimson saber, staring at Lin Xiu.

Before Lin Xiu could say something, he continued, “Let’s get to know each other, I am Zhu Jun.”

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded, looked at him with a calm expression without a hint of panic on his face.

Looking at Lin Xiu’s expression, Zhu Jun’s brows knitted.

Doesn’t he know that he is already a rank 6 warrior?

“I and Zhuo Qixing are different.” He continued to speak to Lin Xiu at this time.

“Different indeed; one takes longer to be defeated by me and the other takes a shorter time.” Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up, and then said faintly,

“Courting death!” Zhu Jun heard Lin Xiu’s words and his expression changed drastically. At this moment, he roared and rushed towards Lin Xiu.

Swish swish swish——

His body was like a phantom, and he appeared above Lin Xiu in an instant. The sword in his hand was like a blood-red crescent moon as he slashed at Lin Xiu’s body!

“What a fast speed!”

The students around were all exclaiming in excitement. In just such a moment, Zhu Jun appeared above Lin Xiu!

“Hng, if he can’t deal with a warrior of this level, he doesn’t deserve to be my Ouyang Hang’s opponent.” Ouyang Hang looked at the scene on the platform and sneered at this time.

Dang–

As expected, at the next moment, Lin Xiu held the body of the long spear in both hands and directly blocked Zhu Jun’s attack.

As the saber collided with the spear body, a lot of sparks were emitted in an instant.

Dang dang dang——

At this time, Zhu Jun didn’t seem surprised that Lin Xiu was able to block his attack, and continued to attack him frantically.

The spear and the saber collided madly.

And at this moment, all three people from Class 1 of the South Campus attacked Luo Yue!

The other guy attacked Zhang Yin and others!

“Careful!”
