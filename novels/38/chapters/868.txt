Chapter 869: People from the Namir Planet (2)

Jinli looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue as he spoke to them. This was the best offer that he could give them.

“Are you an idiot?” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Lin Xiu said to Jinli without any hesitation.

Jinli was a little shocked but he soon understood what Lin Xiu was saying. Lin Xiu was humiliating him!

“Kill the man and shave him till he becomes as thin as a stick. As for the woman, bring her to me.”

Jinli said with a furious look on his face.

The low lying earthling dared to speak to him in that manner! How dare he?!

After getting the command from Jinli, one of the warriors dashed towards Lin Xiu.

In their opinion, Lin Xiu was merely an earthling. They only needed to send one warrior to get rid of Lin Xiu.

Boom – –

Just as he was running toward Lin Xiu, the spear that was behind Lin Xiu’s back flew into the air and started spinning.

The warrior that was running saw a bright light and before he could react, all four of his limbs had been chopped off from his body.

Only his body was left on the ground.

“AHHHHH!!!!”

He let out a loud, painful cry and soon, he was dead due to the major blood loss.

The rest of the warriors from the Namir Planet were shocked to see what had happened.

How was that possible?!

This earthling! How did he have such strong power?!

He didn’t even do much and he managed to kill the warrior

“Luo Yue, as you ready?”

Lin Xiu asked Luo Yue who was standing next to him.

“En.”

Luo Yue pulled out her sword that was tied to her waist. The firm look in her eyes showed that she was ready to fight.

Luo Yue had the physique of a warrior god that had not been encountered in the Luo family in centuries. If she was given enough resources and skills to train, she would definitely be one of the best.

The environment on earth had limited her progress but when she got to the Marqi Planet, she had improved tremendously and was terrifyingly powerful.

“Get rid of them!!”

The expression on Jinli’s face looked extremely awful.

They were superior to these low lying earthlings but this man had killed his warrior in such a humiliating manner.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue looked at each other. Without saying a word, both of them rushed towards the men.

There were some who were warrior kings amongst the men that came from the Namir Planet but these warrior kings were nothing compared to Luo Yue.

The sword in her hand has already become a part of her body.

With the sword glistening in the air, it was followed by gushes of fresh red blood that continuously appeared in the air.

Luo Yue was a merciless woman when it came to the battleground.

Soon, all that’s left were debris of body parts all over the ground accompanied by the cries and wailing of the men that were still alive.

The other warrior kings decided to get rid of the men that looked more dangerous.

All of them surrounded Lin Xiu and were attacking Lin Xiu with all sorts of warrior skills.

The warrior skills that they were using were quite similar to those that were seen on earth.

The only difference was that the strength of their warriors skills.

Lin Xiu was swinging his long spear and his figure was moving so fast that it looked like a shadow.

The warrior kings who were all around Lin Xiu didn’t even get the chance to hit Lin Xiu.

As Lin Xiu continued to move the long spear in his arm, there was a bright light that flashed before their eyes.

Boom boom boom – –

They were about to get closer to Lin Xiu but instead, their heads got pierced by Lin Xiu’s long spear and it led to their heads exploding!!!
