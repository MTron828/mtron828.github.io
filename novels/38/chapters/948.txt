Chapter 949: Mr Zhang

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu sat on the chair and took a good look around.

The Dark Shadow was an agency created by the Ye family a long time ago.

Now, they have grown to become one of the largest intelligence agencies on this planet.

The founder of the Dark Shadows, will they still obey the Imperial Order?

Crack– –

Soon, Lin Xiu could hear lots of footsteps coming from the outside.

When he heard those noises, he could also feel the strong energy coming from those outside and Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

It looks like things aren’t going to go on as smoothly as he had imagined.

Boom – –

That’s when a loud sound came from the door as the entire door was kicked opened.

IIt was a heavy metal door and it was headed towards Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu saw the door coming towards him and he frowned behind his mask.

He slowly raised his right hand and gave it a good smack. The heavy, strong metal door instantly broke into a few smaller pieces.

......

“Mister Zhang, he’s the guy who you’ve been hunting for!”

Dong Shang appeared in the room first and he pointed at Lin Xiu while speaking to another man.

The expression on his face was totally different from the one that he had earlier. The respectful look on his face was no longer found.

“Did you really think that we wouldn’t be able to recognise you just because you have a mask on? We have a scanning system here.”

Dong Shang glared at Lin Xiu and sneered.

“Looks like the Dark Shadow does not acknowledge the Imperial Order.”

Lin Xiu slowly stood up from his chair and said softly.

Dong Shang ignored Lin Xiu and spoke to the man standing next to him, “Mr Zhang, this is the man that the Divine Domain has been looking for.”

“I know.”

Mr Zhang looked at Lin Xiu and there was a sarcastic smile on his face.

In his perspective, this was a very weak man.

“The Huangpu Elder even placed a warrant on you? Hmph! Such a waste of resources for a warrior like you.”

Mr Zhang said in a cold tone.

“Arrest him and bring him back.”

He raised his hand and gave his commands to the men standing behind him.

These were elders from the Divine Domain, they held onto their weapons and rushed towards Lin Xiu.

“Get on your knees!”

One of the warriors screamed at Lin Xiu.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was still standing on the same spot motionlessly, he was starting to get frustrated.

“We have already given you a chance!”

“Go on!”

He screamed and all of the warriors released their warrior skills and headed towards Lin Xiu.

They wanted to teach Lin Xiu a lesson.

“Move.”

Just when they were about to inch closer to Lin Xiu, he spoke to them bluntly.

With that, all of the warriors headed towards Lin Xiu were thrown into the distance!

Boom boom boom – –

All of their bodies landed on the wall behind them.

Every time a body landed on the wall, it let out a loud sound.

Some of their bones were broken because of the impact and they spat out a mouthful of blood as they fell to the ground, whining in pain. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Dong Shang and Mr Zhang, who assumed that they could easily capture Lin Xiu, had a change of expression on their face.

This was because all of the warriors that they have sent were some of the best that they’ve got.

Other than some who were still warrior kings, most of them were already respected warriors!

But, they didn’t even get close enough to Lin Xiu and were already defeated within a blink of an eye!

“Dong Shang, I am really disappointed in the Dark Shadow.”

Lin Xiu stood up and said to Dong Shang.

Dong Shang immediately had a panicked look on his face.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be such a strong person.

“Mr Zhang, not only has this man caused trouble in the Dark Shadow, he even injured the men from the Divine Domain. Should we work together to kill him?”

Dong Shang turned towards Mr Zhang, who was standing next to him, and gave him a suggestion.

“Sure.”

Mr Zhang answered firmly.

Then, he gathered his source energy and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

He was quick and he was already standing right in front of Lin Xiu within seconds.

He had a sword in his hand and it was headed for Lin Xiu.

However, Lin Xiu was faster and his body immediately moved sideways, dodging the attack!

“Where do you think you’re going?”

Then, Dong Shang screamed.

Dong Shang raised his right hand and there was another sword that appeared in his arm.

These men had their swords coming from different directions and were all headed towards the same target – Lin Xiu!

Both of them were respected warriors and their strength was also considered one of the strongest.

Lin Xiu was being cautious as well and was not giving himself any chance of making a mistake.

He quickly entered the expansion space and took out his long spear.

Clang clang clang – –

He swerved his long spear and it collided with their weapons!

Mr Zhang and Dong Shang felt that their attack had been blocked by an invisible wall and could only use half of their actual strength.

Plus, the way that Lin Xiu was wielding his long spears felt like they were wind blades.

They couldn’t see the attacks that were similar to wind blades and could only block them by feeling it.

However, Lin Xiu was moving it too quickly. In order to dodge the attacks from the wind blades, they wouldn’t be able to block the hits from the long spear.

Xiu Xiu Xiu —-

Soon, there were wounds seen all over their arms.

Damn it!

Dong Shang and Mr Zhang looked awful.

They realised that as they continued attacking Lin Xiu, he was only getting stronger instead of weaker.

‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flower’!!!

Lin Xiu looked at Dong Shang and Mr Zhang who were trying to force him to a corner. He leaped into the air and changed the position of his long spear!

Clang clang clang – –

Seeing how there were thousands of figures of the long spears headed towards them, Dong Shang and Mr Zhan started to panic.

They quickly moved the sword in their arms, trying to block as many as possible.

They couldn’t help but take a few steps back as well.

As Lin Xiu was wearing the title ‘Source Strength Absorption’ with the passive effect of absorbing 5% of the other parties’ energy while fighting them, all of the energy that Dong Shang and Mr Zhang was losing while being attacked by the long spear would be absorbed by Lin Xiu. So, Lin Xiu would always be recovering the energies that he had just lost.

In other words, Lin Xiu would never lose any source energy while fighting!

As for the other party, they would be losing theirs significantly.

Therefore, they had no other choice but to release their ‘spheres’.

This was because Lin Xiu’s attacks were too strong and if they missed one of them, they could be killed by it!

Koong loong – –

Then, Lin Xiu started spinning the long spear in his hands.

There were flames that were shooting out of the long spear.

“Go!”

Mr Zhang could feel how strong the flames were.

That’s when he screamed to the rest of his men.
