1229 The Power of Sha Li

When the two fists clashed, there was an extremely loud sound.

Although Lin Xiu’s fist was wrapped with source strength, this Sha Li was wearing a special glove.

An extremely severe pain hit and Lin Xiu’s body was directly blown away.

The Dark edge spear was still stuck on the black energy matter and was not drawn back.

“Hehe, that’s all you’ve got huh.”

Sha Li licked his lips and said with a sneer.

Then he pulled out the Dark Edge spear that was stuck on the released dark energy matter.

Holding the Dark Edge spear, he looked toward Lin Xiu who flew out, revealing a look of contempt.

Dangdangdang——

At the same time, Baili Haoling had already started fighting Sha Qiang.

Sha Qiang picked up a sword from the ground and attacked frantically.

And while attacking with weapons, the source strength in his body was continuously materialized into those gravel-like substances.

They scattered on the ground.

Soon, as the battle between the two continued, a large amount of gravel-like material transformed from the source strength appeared on the ground.

“Die!!!”

Baili Haoling was fuming at this time.

The double swords in both hands were already waving even faster.

Dangdangdang——

As her two swords collided with his sword continuously, a lot of sparks erupted.

Although Baili Haoling’s attack looked fierce, she could not kill Sha Qiang.

On the contrary, Sha Qiang seemed to be able to handle it with ease.

Damn it!

At this time, Baili Haoling wanted to kill him even more, but found that no matter how much power she used, she couldn’t do it.

“It’s my turn.”

After resisting Baili Haoling’s attack again, Sha Qiang showed a sneer.

Those gravel-like substances on the ground instantly formed hands of gravel, directly grabbing Baili Haoling’s feet!

Just as Baili Haoling was about to continue attacking, she felt that her feet were caught and she couldn’t move at all.

Looking down suddenly, she saw that the gravel-like things he had just released had formed so many hands of gravel, grabbing her feet tightly!

And at this moment, before she could think about it, a cold light flashed over!

boom–

Sha Qiang’s sword had already slashed at Baili Haoling’s head.

But fortunately, Baili Haoling’s reaction speed was fast enough and she could completely resist it by using the ‘Sphere’.

“You react pretty quickly eh.”

Sha Qiang snorted coldly.

He was a little surprised by Baili Haoling’s powerful reaction ability.

At this moment, without any hesitation, he continued to wave the sword in his hand.

Bang bang bang——

As he waved the sword and attacked Baili Haoling’s Sphere continuously, there was a burst of loud noises.

Sha Qiang’s frenzied attacks did not stop at all.

And Baili Haoling couldn’t move at all because of those gravel hands.

She could only withstand Sha Qiang’s attacks continuously.

Soon, cracks began to appear in her ‘Sphere’.

The expression on Baili Haoling’s face changed slightly and struggled, trying to break free.

Once the ‘Sphere’ is broken, she would be in danger!

“It’s useless, give up struggling!”

Sha Qiang seemed to know what Baili Haoling was thinking. At this moment, he said in a cold voice while continuing to wave the sword in his hand.

The ‘Sphere’ is about to… break!

At this moment, a scream came from the sky.

Xiaobai rushed over and grabbed Sha Qiang directly! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Go away!”

Seeing this scene from the corner of Sha Qiang’s eye, he suddenly stopped attacking Baili Haoling and turned around to attack Xiaobai!

boom–

His sword attacked Xiaobai’s body and immediately a large number of ice crystals scattered down.

Some purple liquid also flowed out from Xiaobai’s body.

This was Xiaobai’s blood.

“Xiaobai!!!”

Seeing this scene, Baili Haoling’s eyes turned even redder.

She frantically wanted to break free, but there was still no way.

The grip of those gravel hands was too terrifying, there was no way to break free.

At this time, Xiaobai had already flown directly into the sky.

“Humph!”

Seeing Xiao Bai who was almost split in half by himself, Sha Qiang snorted coldly.

Just when he was about to move, he found a cold feeling coming from the bottom of his feet.

Looking carefully, a large number of ice cubes appeared from the soles of his feet.

These ice cubes are still spreading to his body.

What is happening!?

Seeing this scene, the pupils in his eyes couldn’t help shrinking.

Is this caused by that ice crystal white bird!?

Before Sha Qiang had time to think about it, at this moment, his entire body was covered by a large number of ice crystals.

At this time, Sha Qiang suddenly turned into an ice sculpture.

“go to hell!”

At the same time, Sha Li on the other side held Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear and threw it directly.

The Dark Edge spear charged toward Lin Xiu’s body that flew out!

It seemed that it was about to hit Lin Xiu’s body and penetrate his body!

But just as it was about to hit Lin Xiu’s body, the Dark Edge spear stopped instantly.

Seeing this scene, Sha Li frowned.

And the body of Lin Xiu who flew out also stabilized at this time.

Pff——

But as soon as he stabilized his body, Lin Xiu spat out a mouthful of blood.

The punch just now not only hurt his fist, but also shocked his internal organs.

This person’s power is very strange, not an ordinary warrior.

He took a closer look at the fist on his left hand, it was already a little bloody.

It looked extremely miserable.

“interesting.”

Lin Xiu wiped the blood from his lips and with a wave of his right hand, the Dark Edge spear was stored in his expansion space.

Now Lin Xiu was a little angry.

The source strength of his body gathered crazily at this moment.

‘Heavenly Array’!

Following Lin Xiu’s thoughts, a white light burst out from Lin Xiu’s body.

Instantly covered the surrounding area.

With the use of the ‘Heavenly Array’, Lin Xiu’s strength is increasing at an extremely fast speed.

“A source field huh.”

Seeing this scene, Sha Li sneered suddenly.

He doesn’t feel any fear of the so-called source field power.

But what surprised him was that Lin Xiu’s strength seemed to have suddenly improved.

A source field that can increase strength?

“Do you think I can’t do that too?”

Sha Li sneered.

“This is the real strength source field!

His source field is capable of greatly increasing strength!

In his opinion, it is thousands of times stronger than Lin Xiu’s current source field!
