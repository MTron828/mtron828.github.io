Chapter 861: Space Teleportation Device (2)

“I do not know.”

Nan Xiang shook his head.

Feeling Lin Xiu’s gaze, for some reason, he suddenly felt like he was falling into an ice cave.

“It’s true, I really don’t!”

At this time, Nan Xiang had cold sweat spilling out of his forehead and felt that he said aloud.

“But in another week, there should be someone teleporting over!”

Nan Xiang quickly told what he knew, he didn’t want to lose his life here.

“Hm?”

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu’s brows couldn’t help but raise.

Another week huh.

“If you lie to me, the Nan family doesn’t need to exist.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“It’s true, I would never dare lie to you.”

Nan Xiang wiped the cold sweat on his forehead and said quickly.

“After that week, I will find you here again.”

Lin Xiu said and left here.

“Phew.”

Seeing Lin Xiu leave, Nan Xiang’s legs suddenly softened and he fell directly to the ground.

The pressure Lin Xiu put on him just now was really terrifying.

“You are... Luo Yue?” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

At this time, Bai Litao and the others went to the Luo family as Lin Xiu said.

When they saw Luo Yue with long snow-white hair, their eyes were filled with surprise.

“Dean.”

Luo Yue looked at Bai Li Tao and said lightly.

“En, long time no see.”

Although Bai Litao didn’t know what happened in the past year, he still touched his beard and smiled.

“What did that kid Lin Xiu do?”

Luo Yan said a little dissatisfied at this time.

He just came back but it seems that the kid is going to make the city full of storms again.

“He seems to be fighting with the Nan family.”

Baili Haoling said aloud at this time.

“How can the people of the Nan family have such strength?”

Ouyang Hang, who came here together, also frowned.

The strength of those people is simply too terrifying. Even the former top powerhouses like Bai Litao don’t seem to be their opponents at all.

And the thing was that those people looked very young.

“Maybe from other planets.”

Luo Yue said lightly.

“Other planets?”

“I tell you, the strongest warriors on earth are nothing on other planets.”

Luo Yan also said aloud at this time.

Sounds like an exaggeration, but it’s the truth.

On the Marqi planet, rank 9 warriors were so common.

“So exaggerated?”

Ouyang Hang said with wide eyes.

“Luo Yue, Luo Yan, did they do anything to you!?”

At this time, Luo Zhen also came out and said aloud.

“President Baili?”

As soon as he walked out, he saw the existence of Bai Litao and others over there and he was stunned for a moment.

It seemed that he was a little surprised by the arrival of Bai Litao and others.

“Something happened just now, Lin Xiu asked us to come here first.”

Bai Litao simply described those things.

“This kid, just came back and something happened again.”

Luo Zhen shook his head helplessly when he heard Bai Litao’s words.

However, Lin Xiu actually came back from Marqi planet, which means that his strength must be much stronger.

“Humph! Those Luo family members still want to push Luo Yue into the fire pit, but fortunately, Lin Xiu finally came over and he has already dealt with them.”

Before Luo Yue could speak, Luo Yan said aloud.

“Really!?”
