Chapter 438: Soaring Combat Strength!

He could win?

The others were stunned when they heard what Luo Yue said.

There were many questionable looks and the remaining students from Class 10 of the South campus looked at each other in disbelief.

After all, the strength that Yu Muchen displayed was too perverted.

“You deserve praise for your courage.” Yu Muchen looked at Lin Xiu who was still standing on the platform and laughed.

“You will lose.” Lin Xiu looked at him, then said indifferently.

“Although you’re rank 6 now but do you really think that you can defeat me?” Hearing Lin Xiu so confident, Yu Muchen was not mad and laughed instead.

The strength that Lin Xiu has displayed was simply too weak for Yu Muchen.

He wasn’t worthy of even being his opponent.

“You talk a lot of nonsense.” Lin Xiu gripped the Dark Edge spear tightly and said indifferently.

“Courting death!” Hearing the words of Lin Xiu, the originally calm Yu Muchen flared up.

He moved like a shadow and charged towards Lin Xiu.

A huge weapon like the halberd didn’t seem to have any weight in his hand.

A cold light flashed and the halberd swung towards Lin Xiu!

Dang–

Lin Xiu did not dodge but attacked!

Under the collision of the Dark Edge spear and the halberd, a loud sound rang out and there were sparks everywhere.

The best defense is offense!

This was the core of the ‘Overlord Spear Art’.

The two looked at their weapons colliding and glanced at one another, retreating at the same time. At the next moment, they both rushed towards each other again!

Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge Spear very swiftly and the patterns on the spear had lit up at this moment.

However, although Lin Xiu was fast, Yu Muchen’s halberd was moving faster!

Dang dang dang——

The weapons collided together and a deafening sound rang out.

“Interesting.” Yu Muchen became cautious and moved in a flash. After avoiding a shot of the spear, the halberd slashed towards Lin Xiu’s body.

Boom–

However, Lin Xiu reacted quickly and unfolded the ‘sphere’.

The halberd stabbed Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ and caused Lin Xiu to take a few steps back.

However, the currents on the ‘Sphere’ traveled to Yu Muchen’s halberd and at this moment, those currents covered his body.

“I’ve gone through electric shock resistance training and the current is much stronger than this.

Yu Muchen looked at Lin Xiu and said plainly. The currents now did not have any impact on Yu Muchen.

Lin Xiu saw this scene and knitted his brows. Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu’s hands were turning red.

When he was fighting Yu Muchen, the impact of the force was too big and Lin Xiu’s hands were clearly in pain.

“At your level, I can easily defeat you without using any skill.” Yu Muchen looked at Lin Xiu and said.

While talking, he seemed to recall something then he smirked, “And at your current level, even if Luo Yue is interested in you, you can’t be with her – you’re still too weak.”

Yu Muchen continued to ridicule and thought that Lin Xiu would be deflated but didn’t expect that Lin Xiu didn’t say a word which made Xu Muchen frown.

Taking a closer look, there was no smile on Lin Xiu’s face and his gaze appeared different from before.

“He is serious now.” Ouyang Hang saw this look from afar and said.

“You talk a lot.” Lin Xiu looked at Yu Muchen and said.

The moment he said that, Lin Xiu took a deep breath then activated his ‘Fury’ skill without hesitation!

At this time, Lin Xiu was wrapped in a white glow.

What’s happening!?

Yu Muchen was shocked when he felt the strong aura from Lin Xiu.

“His combat strength… is constantly rising!”

The machine on the platform could clearly capture Lin Xiu and Yu Muchen’s current combat strength and Lin Xiu’s combat strength was soaring wildly at the moment that even the observer was shocked.

“‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky’!!!”

The Dark Edge slashed down and a red flame burst out in an instant engulfing the entire platform.

Above this huge platform, everything was covered in flames.

The surrounding air seemed to become extremely hot.

The whole platform became a big fire furnace.

Rumble——

And the flames that covered the platform turned into fireballs in the next second, coming down from the sky!

“This guy’s skill… is really exaggerated…” Ouyang Hang exclaimed in his heart.

Those fireballs were like meteorites. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

If one got hit by these fireballs, it would burn the entire person eh?

“Insignificant skill!!!”

Yu Muchen screamed, his hands held the halberd and it was covered in a faint blue light. Seeing the fireball coming towards him, he waved his halberd immediately.

That fireball was immediately cut into two halves by his halberd!

“He could even chop flames!?”

Seeing this scene, the audience was shocked.

But when he cut the flame ball into two halves, Lin Xiu appeared in front of him!

Yu Muchen’s pupils constricted and he rushed towards Lin Xiu with the halberd.

Dang–

The huge impact caused Yu Muchen to take a few steps back.

Lin Xiu’s body was giving off silver light and he looked like a warlord. Without giving Yu Muchen a chance, he attacked again wildly!

“‘Awe of the phoenix’!!!!”

And as Lin Xiu waved the Dark Edge spear, flaming birds burst out and rushed over!

“Damn!!!”

Yu Muchen’s eyes were filled with fright.
