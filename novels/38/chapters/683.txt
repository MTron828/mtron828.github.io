Chapter 684 Respected Warrior!

“Let’s go, if more of their people come, you guys will be in trouble.”

Lin Xiu said aloud at this time.

“Are you also from Earth?”

A man hesitated for a moment, then said to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

“You too, right.” Lei Tong said at this time.

He was just caught here. Before he came, he saw these people here.

“We were born on Marqi planet.”

The man shook his head, then continued to say, “But our parents used to be people from Earth.”

“This brother, do you want to go to the base with us?”

The man thought for a while, then said aloud.

“Base?!”

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu’s brows suddenly twitched, he was a little puzzled.

“En, in that place, there are those of us who are not welcome by the Marqi people.”

“Everyone lives there.”

Said the man.

“Brother Lin, let’s go and have a look. I just went to ask. Most of the hotels here only accept people with light blue eyes. It’s really discriminatory!”

Lei Tong said this, and became angrier and angrier.

“Alright.”

Lin Xiu thought for a while and then nodded. Maybe he could find other clues from there.

After all, what he saw before was only the information on the Internet.

“Let’s go quickly, and when the patrolling finds out, we’ll be finished!”

A man looked at the bodies of those people, and in the next moment, said aloud.

After all, Lin Xiu had already killed so many people from Marqi Planet, even though those people were not good people. With these people leading the way, they arrived at the other side.

This area, compared to the downtown side of Tianlong City, looked relatively dilapidated.

The surrounding houses all looked a bit shabby.

They entered an underground bar.

This underground bar was very large. At this time, there were a large number of people reveling in it, and it looks very lively.

Taking a closer look, the people here look the same as the Chinese people on Earth, their pupils were all black or brown. “Come on, sit down.”

After everyone sat on the other side, the men just relaxed immediately, and then brought a bottle of wine and put it on the table here.

“I don’t know what your name is?”

A man said respectfully to Lin Xiu.

“Lin Xiu.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“My name is Lei Tong.”

Lei Tong said. “My name is Chen Lan.”

The man also introduced himself, and the other two were named Zhang Hu and Su Qiang.

Because Lin Xiu saved them tonight, they were very grateful to Lin Xiu.

“This is the gathering place for our so-called ‘lower-class people’.”

Chen Lan laughed at himself at this time

“Are there many people on Earth here?”

At this time, Lei Tong also said a little curiously.

“Not a lot, because the route to your earth was recently established.”

“Most of the people here are people from other planets.”

Chen Lan shook his head and said.

“And as far as I know, quite a few of those Earthlings that came over in the last few batches have already been killed.”

Chen Lan said in a deep voice.

“It seems that the discrimination here is quite serious.” Lin Xiu took a sip of wine and said.

“Yes.” Chen Lan sighed.

“However, the strength of those people is indeed very strong. Their monarch is already a warrior at the Respected warrior level.”

“What is Respected warrior?”

“A rank 9 warrior?”

Lei Tong was stunned when he heard his words and then said subconsciously. “Hahaha.”

When Lei Tong’s words were spoken, Chen Lan and the others laughed.

“Brother Lei, don’t you know, rank 9 warriors, for that group of people, are just beginners.”

“Beginners?”

Lin Xiu was startled at this moment. He hadn’t inquired about this aspect. Hearing Chen Lan’s words at this time, the expression in his eyes changed slightly. “Well, above the rank 9 warrior, there is the master warrior, above the master, it’s the king warrior, and then the respected warrior.”

“A Respected warrior’s strength is extremely powerful. It is said that the monarch of the Marqi planet can break open space with his own power!”

Speaking of this, Chen Lan looked a little excited.

“He is really that strong?” When Lei Tong heard Chen Lan’s words, his face was full of shock.

He used to be on Earth and thought that the rank 9 warrior was the most powerful existence.

Unexpectedly, above the rank 9 warrior, there was still such a powerful existence.

To be able to break open the space, this was simply a god.

“I just heard about it, but I haven’t seen it.”

Chen Lan smiled, shook his head and said.

“But there are several master warriors in this sky city.”

“So many!”

Lei Tong sucked in a breath of cold air. This so-called Master warrior was beyond the existence of a rank 9 warrior. “The head of the top ten warriors in Tianlong City, Huangfu Jun, is a master-level warrior.

“Only twenty-four years old.”

When Lei Tong heard this, he couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

This was too terrifying, so young, so powerful. Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes. It turns out that the ninth rank is not the end yet…

“Tomorrow’s warrior audition is about to start, and this Master-level genius will also appear at the venue.”

Chen Lan continued to speak.

“Is there anyone here signing up for the competition?”

Lin Xiu said aloud at this time. Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, everyone was stunned, and then Chen Lan smiled bitterly and said, “How can anyone here participate in this competition? The requirement for this competition is to be a warrior under twenty-five. Our age is no longer suitable.”

“Even if our age is suitable, we’re not strong enough. And if the people of Marqi planet sees people like us competing, they will kill us in the competition.” “Well, I’m going to participate.” Lin Xiu nodded and said aloud.

Pff

Hearing Lin Xiu’s voice, Lei Tong spat out the wine he had just drank.

“Brother Lin, are you kidding me?”

Lei Tong widened his eyes and said, Lin Xiu looked like he was in his thirties.

With his age, he didn’t meet the competition requirements at all. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Brother Lin, the minimum age requirement for this competition is to be under 25 years old.” Chen Lan said with a wry smile at this time.

“When the time comes, you guys will find

out.”

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up slightly, and then said aloud. “Come on, let’s have a drink!”

Although Zhang Hu and Su Qiang felt that Lin Xiu’s strength was quite strong, but at this time they thought that Lin Xiu was joking and didn’t say much.

Boom

Just when everyone was drinking and bragging, the door of this bar suddenly made a loud noise.

The entire gate was blown apart!

The people who were reveling around started screaming.
