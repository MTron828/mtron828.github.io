Chapter 1030: One Hit KO

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu was flying above the Sacred Region Academy and he could clearly see that there was a large crowd at the gate of the academy.

Other than warriors who were dressed in the uniforms of the Sacred Region Academy, there were those who were dressed in the uniforms of another academy.

“Baili Tao, looks like the warriors from your school aren’t that great as well.”

There was a young man, dressed in the uniform of another academy, mocking at the students from the Sacred Region Academy.

They were in fact students from the Interstellar Academy. They were supposed to be here for an exchange problem but they decided to mock and disgrace the Sacred Region Academy.

This was because the Sacred Region Academy was too powerful last year and even defeated the Interstellar Academy.

They have been waiting for an opportunity to do this.

After hearing what they said, Baili Tao’s face turned solemn.

Some of the warriors from the Sacred Region Academy who were involved in the fight, felt furious as well.

Almost all of them have lost to the warriors of the Interstellar Academy.

“Baili Tao, shall we have a battle then?”

The young man looked at Baili Tao and challenged him.

“Mu Zhi, you shouldn’t be too arrogant.”

Baili Tao was furious after being challenged by the man.

These students from the Interstellar Academy were here to humiliate the Sacred Region Academy.

“What’s wrong? You’re scared?”

Mu Zhi let out a cold laugh.

“So, that;s how useless this school is.”

“Even the headmaster himself refuses to fight me. I think it would be best for all the students from this useless academy to join us.”

Mu Zhi continued laughing.

Baili Tao looked even more furious than before.

The man, known as Mu Zhi, was powerful.

Baili Tao wasn’t sure if he could defeat him.

If Baili Tao lost to his young man, it would be worse for the students of the Sacred Region Academy.

“You’re just a small warrior who is still studying. How dare you challenge us?”

Suddenly, there was a voice that appeared in the sky. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The crowd subconsciously looked up in the sky when they heard his voice.

That’s when they noticed that there was someone floating in the sky.

Students from both the Sacred Region Academy and the Interstellar Academy were both shocked.

“He’s in the air?”

“Lin Xiu?!”

Baili Tao was surprised to see that it was Lin Xiu.

Xiu – –

Within a blink of an eye, Lin Xiu was already back on the ground, standing next to Baili Tao.

“Headmaster, long time no see.”

Lin Xiu greeted Baili Tao with a smile on his face.

“You fella. When did you come back?”

Baoli Tao gently stroked his beard and laughed.

“I just got back.”

Lin Xiu laughed as well.

“Lin Xiu? That’s Lin Xiu?”

The rest of the young warriors around them asked subconsciously.

They were a new batch of students.

This batch was much stronger than the ones that they ever had before since most of them were already rank 8 warriors.

But then, Lin Xiu noticed that most of them from the Interstellar Academy were rank 9!

They were already considered the stronger ones on earth.

“Who are you?!”

Mu Zhi couldn’t help but frown when he saw Lin Xiu.

He had an odd feeling about Lin Xiu. He could feel that Lin Xiu isn’t that powerful but he couldn’t find out the true potential of him.

It felt as if Lin Xiu had blended with the surroundings.

It was just a peculiar feeling.

“You’re from the Interstellar Academy?”

Lin Xiu ignored Mu Zhi and asked another question.

“With those weak abilities, you have the guts to come to the Sacred Region Academy?”

Lin Xiu took a good look at them before speaking to those from the Interstellar Academy.

“Idiot! You’re asking for it!”

Mu Zhi was the one who got mad after being provoked by Lin Xiu.

From how Lin Xiu was able to stay in the air for so long, he knew that Lin Xiu wasn’t a nobody.

But, no matter how strong Lin Xiu was, he was still no match for Mu Zi!

“All of you can come together.”

Lin Xiu looked at all of them once again before telling them.

All together?

They were all shocked when they heard Lin Xiu’s request.

“Nonsense!”

One of the warriors screamed and with the weapon in his hands, he attacked Lin Xiu.

He had a sword in his hand and with the source energy instilled in it, there was a bright glow coming from the long sword.

Boom – –

Just when his sword was about to hit Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu managed to hold it with only 2 fingers.

“You…”

The young man widened his eyes in shock. He tried to pull it back but he soon noticed that it was impossible!

What…how is this even possible?!

Boom – –

Lin Xiu gently bent his fingers and the sword broke into pieces!

The rest of the warriors were shocked!

That was an extremely sturdy sword. How did Lin Xiu break it so easily?!

“You aren’t strong enough.”

Lin Xiu shook his head as he spoke.

“AHHHHHH!!!!”

The warrior turned mad and screamed as he continued attacking Lin Xiu with the broken sword.

Lin Xiu frowned and suddenly, his entire body disappeared.

The warrior missed his target.

Before he realised what was happening, he felt a strong surge of energy from behind him and he was thrown into the distance.

Lin Xiu had suddenly appeared from behind him and gave him a good kick!

How…..how did this happen?!

Mu Zhi was watching the fight the entire time and he couldn’t believe his eyes.

This was because the warrior that had just attacked Lin Xiu was a rank 9 warrior!

He was known as a genius in Interstellar Academy.

How did Lin Xiu kick him around as if he was just a piece of garbage?!

“You’re too weak.”

Lin Xiu looked at the students from the Interstellar Academy and commented.

That’s when all of them got furious.

“Who are you?!”

Mu Zhi glared at Lin Xiu.

“I was just a student of the Sacred Region Academy.”

Lin Xiu answered the young man.

The rest of the students from the Sacred Region Academy started cheering.

The rank 9 warrior that fought Lin Xiu seemed powerful but Lin Xiu managed to defeat him easily. This was definitely something that cheered them up.

“Do you still want to play?”

“If you do then do it together.”

Lin Xiu looked at the students from the other school and gave them another chance.

“You’re dead!!!”

Mu Zhi couldn’t hold it in anymore after hearing what Lin Xiu said.

As he rushed towards Lin Xiu, all of the warriors from the Interstellar Academy attacked Lin Xiu as well!

The students from the Sacred Region Academy panicked and they wanted to help Lin Xiu.

“It’s alright. He can do it alone.”

Baili Tao looked at his students before stopping them.
