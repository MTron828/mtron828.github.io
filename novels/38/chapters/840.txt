Chapter 841: It’s Over

In the end, including himself, there were only four people left.

“I said it, tell them not to touch those things.”

At this time, Jiang Ying was still holding the book and said helplessly.

Just now, if she wasn’t lucky, she would have died in that base.

Lin Xiu felt a little weird at this time.

From the moment he entered the base to fight the giants, Lin Xiu felt that the head in his body became active.

“I don’t know where these people come from.”

Thinking of the giants just now, Chen Dong couldn’t help but speak out in fear.

The bodies of those giants are really terrifying and their physical strength alone could resist the skill attack of the King warrior.

“Namir Planet…”

Jiang Ying looked at the strange words on the quaint book and said in a low voice.

“What did you say!?”

Hearing her words, Lin Xiu said aloud.

Jiang Ying was all taken aback at this moment.

“What’s the matter, Brother Lin?”

Chen Dong was also stunned for a moment.

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu curiously, she rarely saw Lin Xiu show such an expression.

“I’m sorry, I lost my cool.”

Lin Xiu said a little embarrassedly at this time.

“I want to ask, what you said just now, is it Namir planet?”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, calmed down and said to Jiang Ying.

“En.”

Jiang Ying nodded.

“Is there any information in it?”

Namir Planet!

Lin Xiu of course remembered this planet. This was the Tower of Trials and the old man was on the original planet.

Because he was hunted down by a Bai family on Namir planet, he fled to Earth.

And he could also be said to be the ancestor of the warriors on earth.

The mass of energy he bestowed on Lin Xiu contained extremely powerful power and Lin Xiu still hadn’t completely absorbed it.

“I still don’t understand the back yet.” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Jiang Ying shook her head and said.

“Namir Planet, I don’t seem to have heard of it.”

Chen Dong thought about it seriously at this time, then shook his head and said.

“Let me know after you’ve studied this thing.”

Lin Xiu said to Jiang Ying.

“Sure.”

Although Jiang Ying was a little surprised that Lin Xiu attached so much importance to this Namir planet, she still nodded.

At this time, everyone had gone outside.

The sky was still gray and it looked extraordinarily weird.

When they returned to the ship, some crew members said curiously, “Captain Chen, where are they?”

Because now, there were only four of them.

The figures of the dozen or so warriors from before have all disappeared.

“Dead.”

Chen Dong said lightly.

“Dead!?”

Hearing Chen Dong’s words, the crew members on the ship were all surprised.

Those warriors just now were all top-level master warrior-level warriors, as well as King warrior-level warriors, all of them died?

“We have found the ghost ship. Now we will arrange for people to pull it out.”

Chen Dong said aloud at this time.

“Really?!”

When the crew members on the ship heard Chen Dong’s words, their eyes suddenly showed surprise.

After Lin Xiu and the others boarded the ship, according to the approximate position previously estimated, Chen Dong directed the ship and went over.

On the other side of the island, there was an inconspicuous hole.

Soon, those people sent people to pull the ghost ship out.

Shortly after the ghost ship came out, the whole island began to shake.

“What’s happening?”

Some people looked at the shaking island and couldn’t help being surprised.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue stood on the deck and looked at the island.

At this time, if you look closely, you can clearly see the island and it begins to sink slowly.

“It should be the self-destruction device in the base that has activated.”

Jiang Ying watched this scene and said subconsciously.

“I see.”

Chen Dong nodded.

Boom—

As the island sank to a certain extent, in the next moment, a huge explosion sounded.

The entire Black River swayed violently.

The cruise ship that Lin Xiu was in shook wildly.

“It’s over.”

Chen Dong looked at this scene and sighed.

They traveled far and wide looking for something, only to find it easily but there were too many people who have died.

“Let’s return!”

The cruise ship pulled the ghost ship along and soon they began to drive toward the pier.

Soon, Lin Xiu and the others returned to the yard where they received the mission.

“You guys wait here, Mr. An will come over later.”

Chen Dong arranged for Lin Xiu and others to sit at the yard and said aloud.

“En.”

Jiang Ying nodded and didn’t seem to be in a hurry at this time.

“It’s over, where do you want to go after that?”

Lin Xiu stood beside Luo Yue, looked at Luo Yue softly, helped her brush the hair on her forehead and said.

“Wherever you go, I’ll go with you.”

Luo Yue showed a smile and said.

Looking at Luo Yue’s smile, Lin Xiu couldn’t help being mesmerized.

“What are you looking at, idiot.”

Luo Yue blushed slightly, looked at Lin Xiu angrily and said aloud.

“Cough cough.”

Lin Xiu came back to his senses at this time, noticed that Jiang Ying seemed to be looking at him and Luo Yue was a little embarrassed.

“Just can’t get enough of you.”

Lin Xiu approached Luo Yue’s ear and whispered.

Luo Yue gave Lin Xiu a blank look, but her heart was full of joy.

Looking at Lin Xiu who was so close to her right now, Luo Yue seemed to recall the past.

More than a year has passed.

It seemed that it has been a long time since she met Lin Xiu.

It was so long that it seemed as if he was with her through everything she had been through.

It would be great if it could go on forever.

“Cough cough.”

At this moment, Mr. An sat on an electric wheelchair and drove slowly over.

Behind him, there are still several men in black.

After not seeing him for a few days, Mr. An seemed to be very haggard.

“You guys are back...”

Mr. An said in a hoarse voice.

“Well, the ghost ship, we have found it.”

Jiang Ying nodded and said aloud.

“It seems that many people died in the Black Styx.

Looking at Lin Xiu and the others who were the only few remaining, Mr. An said.

“I don’t need the ghost ship anymore.”

Don’t need it!?

Mr. An seemed to have thought of something and rubbed his red eyes.

“Since they are all dead, I will give you everything, six life crystals each.”
