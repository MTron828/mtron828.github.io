Chapter 96: Absorption Of Odd Crystal Energy

Without further ado, Lin Xiu placed these three silver skill cards directly on his forehead.

Memories surged into his mind.

It wasn’t long before Lin Xiu felt that he had the memory of how to use these three skills in his mind.

Lin Xiu was surprised after he knew how to use these skills, they were very useful for close combat.

‘Tiger Strength Fist’ was not an ordinary punch but a skill that could enhance one’s strength. When using ‘Tiger Strength’, he could also use ‘Rupturing Fist’ and the effects of these two skills stacked together would probably be unbelievable.

And ‘Serial Kick’ was, as its name suggestsed, an ordinary leg technique skill card, and allowed the user to kick continuously. Baili Haoling probably knew that his leg work was relatively poor so he deliberately picked this skill card for him.

And the ‘Fire Claws’ could produce flames on all five fingers so when the user grabs his opponent, it would cause great harm.

“By the way, when I use ‘Rupturing Fist’ to attack then use ‘Fire Claws’, would it become a combo skill?”

Lin Xiu immediately tried it. He punched the air with ‘Rupturing Fist’, then unleashed ‘Tiger Strength Fist’, and this ‘Rupturing Fist’ seemed to cause an explosion in the air.

After punching the air, Lin Xiu’s fingers immediately spread out and grabbed the air. Suddenly, there were flames bursting out between his five fingers.

‘It’s feasible!’

Lin Xiu was elated. If others collided against his fist, he could change his fist, then use the ‘Fire Claws’ to grab the enemy’s fist.

With the new skills, he obviously had to strike when the iron is hot and train hard, especially since they were three silver skills.

Lin Xiu trained till the early hours of the morning and was a little breathless.

He had basically almost mastered these skills, but to use them smoothly, he still needed a period of combat training.

Lin Xiu poured out all the previously acquired Odd Crystals from the backpack.

He killed a lot of evolved beasts along the way and seized many Odd Crystals, plus those that he won from the lottery. When he poured all of them out, they covered the ground.

“Oh my, so many?” Seeing this, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened. Many of them were rank 2 Odd Crystals and wouldn’t sell for much, but he still had millions of union coins in his card so he wasn’t very short of money.

Holding these Odd crystals, Lin Xiu thought for a moment and decided to use them to practice the ‘cultivation technique’, absorbing all the energy inside and turning them into source strength!

With that thought, Lin Xiu put these Odd Crystals in his hands, then began to practice the ‘cultivation technique’.

As Lin Xiu was absorbing the energy in the air while also absorbing the energy inside the Odd Crystals, a large amount of energy was constantly absorbed and transformed in his body. Lin Xiu felt that every cell of his body had become more active, and the cells were constantly divided.

Although the cells were dividing, they did not damage the nucleus at all.

Because he had uncovered the rank 1 Gene Lock previously, the cell composition in Lin Xiu’s body now went through some kind of change.

A great deal of energy stored inside the Odd Crystal was absorbed like water flowing through his entire body.

Click click——

His bones seemed to go through some sort of qualitative change. His bone density was also increasing, become harder and stronger.

Even the cells in his brain seemed to become more active.

Not sure how long had gone by, when Lin Xiu finally opened his eyes again, he saw a ray of morning sunlight shining in through the curtains.

“Feels great!” Lin Xiu stretched his limbs lazily, it was as if the fatigue brought about by the training was completely gone.

Looking down on the ground, he saw a pile of ordinary rocks.

“Didn’t think that I would actually absorb so many Odd Crystals in one night…” Lin Xiu’s jaw dropped in surprise.

He felt a little heartache. If he sold these Odd Crystals, he might be able to make some money.

Generally speaking, people who used Odd Crystals to speed up the practice of ‘cultivation technique’ were all rich people. Lin Xiu didn’t think that he was also such a tyrant.

He felt that after last night’s practice, his body’s source strength was much stronger, but he also had a feeling that his ‘cultivation technique’ would soon have a breakthrough again. By then, he would be able to become a rank 3 warrior!

It was only six o’clock now and the sun had risen very early.

Bang bang bang——

Just as Lin Xiu was done showering, he heard a series of knocks coming from the door.

“Who is it?”

Lin Xiu was washing his face in the bathroom and called out.

Could it be that Baili Haoling wanted to drag him out for training again? Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Breakfast delivery.” A strange voice sounded.

‘Breakfast? I don’t remember ordering any breakfast ah… Did Baili Haoling order it for me?’

Lin Xiu hesitated a little, opened the door, and saw a tall, thin man pushing a dining cart.

Although he was dressed as a waiter, Lin Xiu felt something was amiss. This person’s eyes revealed a trace of murder intent, although it was very mild, Lin Xiu could still sense it.

He wanted to close the door immediately!

Bang——

Just when Lin Xiu was about to close the door, the man also reacted swiftly and kicked the door. Lin Xiu took a few steps back from the impact then jumped over directly to the training space.

A very short guy immediately sprang out of the dining cart.

A midget?

The man looked very short, but he was filled with a warrior’s aura.

His eyes were cold, and he looked at Lin Xiu as if he was looking at a dead man.

“It’s time to hand it over.” The tall thin man smiled and said. He was wearing a white waiter uniform and took a knife out of his pocket.

“I’ve seen that convertible robot, the android wolf. It should be the robot behind him.” The midget looked over behind Lin Xiu and spoke with a monstrous voice.

“Oh? So you’re trying to take this thing?” Lin Xiu sneered.

This android wolf was a product from the mech era, and it was in such good condition which would fetch quite a sum of money, that’s why they were eyeing it.

‘So it’s just for money, huh…’
