1150 Stepping into the God warrior Realm

“We won! We won!”

At the same time, Wang Qiang and others on the other side shouted excitedly.

All the warriors of the Bai family have been killed.

At this time, the Holy City had also been breached.

And now, a large number of surrounding buildings have fallen to the ground and the whole city looks like a ruin.

Although they were victorious, many warriors on this side also died.

“Master!?”

Seeing Lin Xiu coming over at this time, Ye Kai said in surprise.

The surrounding warriors all looked at Lin Xiu.

Taking a closer look at this time, Lin Xiu’s body exuded a faint golden light, which looked very strange.

“What I promised has been done.”

Lin Xiu looked at Ye Kai and said lightly. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Ye Kai was startled, then nodded slightly.

Of course he understood that what Lin Xiu said was what happened when he was at the Sacred Region Academy, at the top of the Tower of Trial.

Because of this reason, Lin Xiu came to the Namir planet.

“Everyone, goodbye.”

Lin Xiu glanced at the crowd at this time, then smiled and said.

goodbye?

“Master, where are you going?”

Wang Qiang came back to his senses at this time and said quickly.

“I’m leaving here.”

Lin Xiu continued speaking.

“Going to the God warrior Realm.”

God warrior Realm!

The surrounding warriors were shocked when they heard Lin Xiu’s words.

Could it be that... Lin Xiu has become a god warrior now!?

“Master...you have become a God warrior!?”

Zhao Yongyuan opened his eyes wide and said in disbelief.

The rest of the people also looked at Lin Xiu with shock in their eyes.

God warrior, this legendary warrior level is now in front of them!?

“En.”

When Lin Xiu spoke out, he felt a strange force strike.

His body, directly and slowly flew up into the air.

“It’s almost time.”

At the same time, Elder Ye’s figure also appeared in the air.

At this time, Elder Ye looked at Lin Xiu, then touched his beard and said aloud.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

“Goodbyem then.”

Lin Xiu smiled at the many warriors below and in the next moment, a dazzling light came out from the sky.

Seeing this dazzling light, the warriors below subconsciously blocked their eyes with their arms.

Soon, in the sky, a huge golden door appeared.

In the next moment, this giant door began to slowly open.

“Go.”

Elder Ye said to Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded and the next moment, he walked directly into the giant gate.

Soon, as Lin Xiu walked in, the giant door closed immediately.

The giant gate and Elder Ye’s figure also disappeared at the same time.

“Go... gone?”

Wu Hao opened his eyes wide at this time, watching the dazzling light in the sky disappear and Lin Xiu’s figure could no longer be found.

The surrounding warriors all seemed to be stunned at the same time.

Although Lin Xiu has left, his story will be passed down here forever.

God warrior Realm.

This is an incomparably huge planet, the size of the entire planet is countless times larger than the earth.

There is a lot of energy here.

For the warriors that cultivated here, the speed of cultivation is very rapid.

Every warrior in the God warrior Realm is born with extremely strong power.

There are nine continents in the God warrior Realm. At this time, Lin Xiu appeared in the Ice and Snow Divine Continent.

“Huh? New here?”

At this time, with Lin Xiu’s figure appearing here, here, Lin Xiu saw a warrior in a special uniform, looking at himself.

“you are...”

Lin Xiu looked at the middle-aged man and after being stunned for a while, he said aloud.

“Receiving people.”

The middle-aged man said lightly.

“They call me Mr. Pang.”

“Hello, Mr. Pang.”

Lin Xiu nodded and said aloud.

He can clearly feel that this warrior is very powerful.

God warrior, he is also at the God warrior level.

“Which planet are you from?”

Mr. Pang looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“Namir Planet.”

“Namir Planet?”

At this moment, Mr. Pang nodded with his right hand and a projection screen appeared.

“Well... there aren’t many God warrior from Namir planet...”

“What’s your name.”

Mr. Pang continued to speak.

“Lin Xiu.”

Although he still don’t understand what’s going on, Lin Xiu still said aloud.

“Hm.”

“Lingxian City, go to Lingxian City.”

After thinking about it for a while, Mr. Pang said aloud.

“What am I going to do there?”

Lin Xiu was startled, then said subconsciously.

“I almost forgot to tell you.”

Mr. Pang patted his head, then said to Lin Xiu, “According to the instructions of the God King, in this God warrior Realm, every new warrior can manage a city.”

“I do not need that.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

The main purpose of his coming to the God warrior Realm was to find Luo Yue.

“It’s not up to you.”

Mr. Pang shook his head and said.

“According to the rules, every God warrior must manage a city for more than three years before they can go to other areas.”

“If the city is badly managed, it will be longer.”

When Lin Xiu heard his words, his eyes narrowed slightly.

“goodbye.”

He turned around and was about to leave.

“Wait.”

But at this moment, in front of Lin Xiu, a large number of transparent barriers appeared.

All of Lin Xiu’s paths were cut off.

“This is the rule set by the God King.”

Mr. Pang looked at Lin Xiu and continued to speak.

“And if you say no, you lose your identity token.”

“Without an identity token, in the God warrior Realm, every city will not accept you.”

When Lin Xiu heard his words, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

“Also, your strength is only at the level of a beginner God warrior. It is very easy for other God warriors to kill you.”

Lin Xiu fell silent at this time.

This God warrior Realm seems to be more complicated than he thought.

And just now Lin Xiu used the Analytic eye to check his attributes, but he found that the Analytic eye showed that it could not be analyzed!

Just a warrior receiving people is so powerful?

“I can promise you, but I want you to help me find someone.”

Lin Xiu turned to look at him at this time and said lightly.

“This is not a promise to me, this is a rule.”

Mr. Pang shook his head at this time.

“But I can look for that person for you.”

“really!?”

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu said a little excitedly.

“En, do you have a photo of the person you need to look for?”

Mr. Pang nodded, then said lightly.
