1257 Book of Reform

Soon, a week went by quickly.

Everything was still the same and nothing happened.

Baili Haoling continued to cultivate and within a week, she managed to become a warrior god.

This was something that surprised Lin Xiu.

!!

When he first met Baili Haoling at the warrior god realm, she was only a saint warrior but now she has already progressed to become a warrior god.

Most importantly, she did not get any help from cultivating the odd crystals. She did it all on her own.

Lei Chong and Mr Pang had help from the odd crystals but their speed in absorbing them was slow.

This was why they were still cultivating them.

It wasn’t that easy for them to become warrior gods.

“Hmm….I still don’t feel anything.”

During one of the mornings, Lin Xiu was still training as per usual and regained consciousness from his cultivation.

However, he still couldn’t find the dark energy anywhere in his body.

This meant that he still had no control over them.

As he thought of how Sha Qiong was able to control these horrifying energies to fight him, Lin Xiu was dying to know how he could get his hands on them.

Lin Xiu stretched his back and entered the system interface.

As he took a closer look, he realised that there were five chances now in his lucky draw.

“Let’s do it then.”

Lin Xiu thought about it as he mumbled to himself.

Without much hesitation, Lin Xiu clicked onto the start button and started the lucky draw.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he looked at the familiar interface.

The distribution of the rewards were similar to the ones before. There were still ten slots.

Three of them were warrior skills cards, three were odd crystals and the last three only had a question mark written on them. The last one which had a small space was the huge reward as per before.

There was nothing different found on it.

When Lin Xiu saw that it was the same thing, he turned speechless.

He was thinking that he might be able to get something interesting but in the end, it was still the same.

“Hmm…forget it. Just finish the draw then…”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

Then, he spinned the wheel.

With that, he clicked onto the start button once again and the lucky draw started.

As he was doing continuously, the wheel spinned extremely quickly.

“Ding! Congratulations master, you have been awarded with odd crystals!”

“Ding! Congratulations master, you have been awarded with healing potion!”

“Ding! Congratulations master, you have been awarded with a giant war hammer!”

“Ding! Congratulations master, you have been awarded the Book of Reform!”

“Ding! Congratulations master, you have been awarded with odd crystals!”

When Lin Xiu heard the notification that appeared, he turned speechless.

He got odd crystals twice!!

As for the rest of them, all of them sounded like they were useless items.

Then, there was a bright light that appeared above him and a large amount of odd crystals fell onto his lap like a heavy rain.

It was all over the floor.

“Hmm? Saint level odd crystals?”

Lin Xiu noticed how half of them were saint level odd crystals and he was a little surprised.

There were at least a hundred of them and they were all of good quality. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

As for the others, they were beast king odd crystals which would be useless to him.

“Healing potion? Instant recovery of 20% of source energy used.”

Lin Xiu read the instructions that came with the twelve bottles of healing potion.

With the control of his mind, he kept all of it into his expansion space.

Boom – –

Suddenly, an eye blinding light appeared before him and there was a war hammer that fell from the sky.

The entire ground shook as the war hammer landed on the floor.

With that, the bright light that appeared earlier slowly disappeared.

When Lin Xiu took a closer look, the war hammer was still glowing but it was not as bright as before.

The war hammer was huge and there were lots of weird ridges seen on it.

Although it was not a suitable weapon for Lin Xiu, he still tried playing with it.

...

It was a heavy weapon but it was still nothing compared to his long spear.

As he moved the war hammer, there was a sharp explosion that appeared in the air.

Lin Xiu could feel that as he transferred the source energy into the war hammer, the weapon started glowing brightly once again.

The weight of it increased as well.

“Hmm?”

Lin Xiu could clearly feel the difference on the war hammer and he was shocked.

He didn’t think that this war hammer would be something different as he assumed that it would only be a normal war hammer.

“Should I give this to Lei Chong or Mr Pang…?”

Lin Xiu continued muttering to himself.

“Koooo koooooo~”

Before he could make up his mind, Rollie, who had been quietly sitting on his shoulder, started making a loud sound.

...

“Rollie, what’s wrong?”

Lin Xiu was a little curious about what Rollie wanted.

Rollie has always been quietly sitting on his shoulder the entire time.

It was as if it was hibernating.

Now that Rollie was suddenly chirping so loudly, Lin Xiu felt that it was a little odd.

It leaped onto the war hammer that was glowing and it looked incredibly excited.

“You want this?”

Lin Xiu hesitated a little before asking.

“Koooo!!”

Rollie nodded his head.

“You shall have it then.”

Lin Xiu was a little caught off guard at first but he still shuckled.

This war hammer seems to be a good weapon but Lin Xiu already had Dark Edge and he wouldn’t need anything else.

“Kooooo koooo!”

After hearing how Lin Xiu gave him the war hammer, Rollie jumped around in excitement. Its body suddenly grew big and his mouth was opened wide like a black hole. Then, in an instant, he swallowed the entire war hammer.

When everything was done, his body returned to its original size.

“So…you wanted to eat the war hammer?”

Lin Xiu finally realised what Rolier wanted.

“Right…..what about this book?”

Lin recalled that there was a book known as the Book of Reform.

What on earth was this?

Lin Xiu took a closer look at it and noticed that it was a scroll made of lambskin.

Lin Xiu then gently opened it and noticed that it was empty. There was nothing written on it.

Lin Xiu turned speechless.

This must be a joke.

“Please place the weapon above the scroll.”

Suddenly, Lin Xiu noticed that there was a row of words on the scroll.

Hmm?

Lin Xiu, who was so pissed that he almost swore, suddenly looked at it with his eyes wide open.

He did not hesitate and took out Dark Edge from his expansion space.

“Am I supposed to put it here?”

Lin Xiu continued muttering to himself as he placed his spear on top of the scroll that was long and wide.

As soon as he placed it on top of the scroll, the scroll started shining brightly.

“Would this actually work?”

Lin Xiu was surprised and he was in disbelief as he muttered to himself.

The long spear might have been carefully curated to his needs but as Lin Xiu became more powerful, his weapon would also have to be strengthened as well so that it would be more comfortable for him to use.
