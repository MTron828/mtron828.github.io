Chapter 326: Leisure Time

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue stayed next to the river that night.

Lin Xiu was still a little curious about Luo Yue’s enemy – who is it?

While thinking, Lin Xiu was already standing in the middle of the river as he held his Dark Edge Spear and stabbed into the water, getting a fish that was quite big.

The shape of this fish was similar to the previous world, but it was very big.

Lin Xiu threw the fish directly to the shore.

On the shore, Luo Yue has set up the fire, which was burning ferociously, causing her cheeks to be a little flushed.

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue who was sitting by the fire. At this moment, Luo Yue seemed to be deep in thoughts as she looked at the fire in a daze.

Lin Xiu felt a little playful at this moment. With a wave of his right hand, he splashed some river water directly towards Luo Yue.

When the river water splashed onto Luo Yue’s face, she came back to her senses instantly.

“What are you thinking about!” Lin Xiu said with a smile.

“You’re having fun, huh?” Luo Yue stood up, then revealed a rare smile and said to Lin Xiu.

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, coupled with the smile on the corners of Luo Yue’s mouth, Lin Xiu felt a chill.

Luo Yue seldom smiles and when she smiled like this, Lin Xiu felt that something was wrong.

As expected, at this moment, Luo Yue moved swiftly and appeared directly on the bank of the river. She waved her right hand and a stream of river water rushed towards Lin Xiu.

Whoosh——

Lin Xiu’s body was soaked in the river water at this time.

He was like a drowned rat.

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment, then he threw the Dark Edge Spear on the bank and with a sudden force, he pushed the river water with both hands and sent a huge wave towards Luo Yue.

Crash——

Following the crash of the river water, Luo Yue, who obviously didn’t have time to dodge, got splashed by the water, making her whole body wet, even her straight long hair was clinging on to her skin.

“Ha ha ha ha.”

Luo Yue, who was usually icy cold, looked very sorry. It was the first time that Lin Xiu has seen her this way and he couldn’t help laughing out loud.

The moment Lin Xiu burst out laughing, Luo Yue had already gone down the river. Her source strength burst out as she waved her hands and a huge wave rushed towards Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu, who was still laughing, drank a mouthful of river water and a small fish happened to be stuck in Lin Xiu’s mouth.

Lin Xiu widened his eyes, looked at Luo Yue and quickly spit out the fish in his mouth.

Then, he continued splashing water towards Luo Yue. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The two people were like kids having fun at this moment.

“That’s enough, that’s enough.” Lin Xiu sat in the shallow river water and panted.

Luo Yue stood in the river, looking at Lin Xiu’s sorry figure, and began laughing.

Lin Xiu was stunned by Luo Yue’s smile.

Luo Yue, who was already too beautiful to look at, looked even more attractive with her laughter.

It wasn’t even an exaggeration to say that she was exquisitely dainty and ravishingly beautiful.

But what Lin Xiu noticed was that Luo Yue was now wet all over and her clothes were now clinging onto her body.

It outlined her stunning figure.

Lin Xiu stared at this scene and felt that his nose seemed a little hot.

At this moment, Luo Yue saw Lin Xiu staring at her body and he seemed a little curious. When she lowered her head, she saw that her white clothes was stuck to her body because of the water.

And it seemed a bit see-through.

Luo Yue waved her right hand and formed a high wall with the river water, then pushed it towards Lin Xiu!

Spash——

“Damn!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened when he saw this scene. Before he could react, the water hit his body directly.

“Pah pah.”

Although the water did not cause any harm to Lin Xiu, it still tasted a bit strange when the river water entered his mouth so he quickly spat out the river water.

When he looked ahead, Luo Yue had disappeared in the river.

Luo Yue was already on the shore, returning to her icy appearance and at this moment, the clothes on her body were completely dry, which made Lin Xiu a little disappointed.

“Was it fun?” Lin Xiu walked up from the river at this time and activated his source strength. In a short moment, his clothes began to dry slowly.

“Childish.” Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu, then said coldly.

But when Luo Yue turned around, the corners of her mouth curled up, revealing a smile.

“Tsk.” Lin Xiu curled up his lips.

‘She called me childish but had so much fun just now.’

Lin Xiu cleaned up the fish that had just been killed, then took a stick and started to grill it.

The night went by..

Soon, it was the next day.

In the morning, Lin Xiu opened his eyes and found that Luo Yue was already awake. At this moment, she was waving the long sword in her hand.

Swish swish swish——

There were sounds of the blade cutting through the air. Luo Yue’s swordsmanship looked ferocious but at the same time, she wielded very gracefully.

It was like a kind of enjoyment watching her swing a long sword like this.

“The fish is ready.” Seeing that Lin Xiu had woken up, Luo Yue said aloud.

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu looked over to the front and found that the fire seemed to have just gone out and it was still warm.

There was a wooden stick with a grilled fish.

It seems that Luo Yue had caught the fish and barbecued it early in the morning.

At this moment, there was a hint of warmth in Lin Xiu’s eyes. Then, he didn’t stand on ceremony and took the grilled fish directly and ate it.

Although there was no oil or salt on the grilled fish, Lin Xiu found it very delicious.

When Lin Xiu finished the grilled fish and filled his stomach, he heard a rustling sound next to him all of a sudden.

What’s that!?
