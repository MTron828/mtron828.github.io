Chapter 110: The Start Of Farming Experience

“Ah!!!”

All the warriors suffered under the swarm of locusts.

All the black locusts gathered together like a black tornado. Upon reaching a warrior, they would immediately turn into a corpse.

“Damn, isn’t that too terrifying?” Tian Zhi watched from a distance and swallowed saliva.

If he did not listen to the old man’s suggestion and continued straight ahead, he would have suffered from the black locusts. Who knew if he would have survived?

“That is why we shouldn’t bully people that look weak.” Lin Xiu chuckled.

Tian Zhi nodded his head then replied, “If we continue walking ahead, we will arrive at Azure Forest.”

“Azure Forest?” Lin Xiu became curious.

All he could currently see were protruding stone pillars that resembled hills.

They were clustered densely and blocked his path. This made Lin Xiu feel a headache looking at them.

It was like a maze.

“Hmm after walking another kilometer, we will arrive at the forest. The trees there are all azure in color, so it is hailed as Azure Forest.” Tian Zhi nodded his head and said.

There were marks carved out by people on the stone pillars. Under Tian Zhi’s guidance, they quickly routed through the stone pillars and ended on the other side.

“You guys knew that there’s something there? Why didn’t you say?!” Right at this time, a few footsteps could be heard as a few people walked over.

They were two guys that carried their own bags and most probably warriors that came down the train.

They were gasping for breath, obviously shaken by the black locusts.

But their faces were filled with anger as they looked at Lin Xiu and Tian Zhi.

“I’m not your dad, why should I be in charge of your safety?” Lin Xiu heard their words and turned to sneer at them.

“You…” The man was speechless against Lin Xiu’s retort.

“Continue ahead?” Lin Xiu turned to Tian Zhi and asked.

Tian Zhi nodded and whispered as he pointed ahead. “We can just keep going ahead.”

“But there will be a few monsters that would appear occasionally, we have to be careful.”

At this point, many other warriors had caught up. Many of those that died were the weaker ones and had reacted slower. The remaining were warriors that escaped unscathed.

Lin Xiu and Tian Zhi walked at the front while the warriors followed tightly behind them.

They saw that Lin Xiu and Tian Zhi had the experience and avoided many dangers by following the duo.

Lin Xiu realized the number of warriors that were following them carefully from afar but did not bother.

The warriors that came into the Path of Death for riches and wealth were truly unafraid to die.

But if Sacred Region Academy was at the end of the Path of Death, how strong were the students there?

Buzz buzz buzz-

Before Lin Xiu could continue in his train of thoughts, he heard the numbing sound again.

“Crap! There are some black locusts here!” Tian Zhi heard the sound and immediately trembled.

The insects were troublesome, even if a warrior could kill a few, they could not kill dozens of them!

Very quickly, more than 10 black locusts gathered like a cloud and charged over.

Lin Xiu was not afraid and instead revealed a look of joy.

It’s time to farm for experience!

“Quickly, run!” Tian Zhi shouted at Lin Xiu but realized that Lin Xiu had no intention of running, but had instead charged towards the front!

Tian Zhi was shocked. ‘Is he trying to die by going forward?’

As Lin Xiu rushed forward, he pressed the little button at the side of the box. In an instant, the almost thousand catty Dark Edge shot out.

What is that?! Tian Zhi took a shock when he saw something black fly out from the box.

Lin Xiu extended his right hand out and grabbed onto Dark Edge!

Spear! It was a black spear!

Awe of the Phoenix!!!

Lin Xiu held the spear tightly and leaped upwards while drawing an arc with the spear!

A burst of flames appeared and transformed into gigantic blazing birds that shot towards the black locusts!

The sight of many blazing birds was extremely majestic!

Rumble-

Upon colliding into the black locusts, they burned the black locust bodies.

“Ding! Congratulations Master for killing rank 2 black Locust, obtaining 5000 experience!”

“Ding! ….”

As he unleashed Awe of the Phoenix, many of the black locusts were burnt to death!

Endless notifications sounded in his head.

Lin Xiu landed on the ground and singlehandedly placed Dark Edge back into the box.

He then checked on his stats:

Experience: 3139635 (22000000 points experience required for the next level)

Although the black locusts he had killed were rank 2 and gave very little experience points, their quantity brought him almost 500,000 experience points! ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

That too in a short span of time!

But Lin Xiu felt that it was a pity, if only he had walked straight and encountered more black locusts, he would have earned even more experience.

‘No, I can’t think of it that way. The black locusts are sturdy and my Awe of the Phoenix unleashed 20 blazing birds to completely kill off these few black locusts.’

‘If I encounter more than a thousand or tens of thousands of them…’ Thinking about it caused Lin Xiu to tremble.

‘It’s not so easy.’

But Tian Zhi and the others were dumbstruck, a few hundred black locusts were instantly obliterated by Lin Xiu?

And his skill was extremely beautiful.

Many odd crystals dropped to the ground. Although the black locusts were burnt, their odd crystals did not melt.

100 Odd Crystals! Although they looked small, Lin Xiu grabbed all of them and kept them in his bag.

‘It is no wonder they say the Path of death is a place to reap a fortune. I already have 100 rank 2 crystals in a short span of time.’

The smaller rank 2 odd crystals could fetch roughly six to seven thousand each. That meant to say he had earned almost a few hundred thousand!

“So strong…” Tian Zhi had his mouth wide opened as he remained in shock.

“The Azure forest is right ahead?” Lin Xiu looked forward. He was able to see a vast forest of blue in the distance.

‘What is awaiting me over there?’
