Chapter 196: Beauty Saves The Hero!?

Lin Xiu’s eyes grew large when he saw the attack.

The power of the skill was too terrifying and caused the ground to tremble.

The powerful blade aura was heading straight toward him!

There was no way to block it, if he were to resist it head-on, he might be killed!

He could only dodge!

Right at this time, a white figure rushed down and carried Lin Xiu away.

Rumble-

The rumbling loud noise arrived at Lin Xiu’s original position and produced a large gorge that was bottomless!

If Lin Xiu had stayed, he would have been sliced into two!

But Lin XIu had disappeared!

“Why does it feel like Beauty is saving the hero?” Lin Xiu was carried in a princess hug and did not know whether to laugh or cry.

‘Seems that the situation has been reversed from hero saving the beauty to the beauty saving the hero.’

But Lin Xiu was overjoyed at Luo Yue’s appearance. He wanted to look for her but encountered them.

“You’re not.” Luo Yue glanced at him and replied indifferently.

Her direct reply made him almost vomit blood.

“Hmph, seems like his companion is here.” Cheng Fan looked ahead and his eyes turned gold.

He had unleashed a powerful skill and he did not have much strength left.

More importantly, not killing Lin Xiu hurt him the most.

“No matter how many they come, we will kill them all.” His companions, the remaining three rank 5 warriors, all glared coldly towards Lin Xiu’s direction.

They were the heads of G17 ruin.

The Sacred Region Academy’s freshmen could not overpower rank 5 warriors no matter how strong they were!

They believed that it was a fluke for Lin Xiu to kill the bald man.

“We will take two each.” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu standing beside her.

En.” Lin Xiu nodded, he still had seven to eight minutes of Fury left which was enough.

By going all out he only needed the seven to eight minutes to kill the two rank 5 warriors. It was not a problem!

Right after their conversation ended, the two charged straight for the building with tacit understanding!

They moved extremely fast like a black and white figure!

“Incoming!!!” Although the mist was still thick, it did not influence their vision.

Clank clank clank-

Cheng Fan discovered a black figure in front of him just as he finished his sentence.

Lin Xiu, with his black Dark Edge, had arrived!

His spear moved like a black dragon that stabbed at Cheng Fan!

Cheng Fan could not retaliate but engage in defense.

‘So strong!’

‘How is this possible! His strength previously was at rank 4 only.’

But he was suddenly able to unleash a substantial difference in power.

‘Did he consume some prohibited drug?’

While still in shock, he noticed stars appearing inside the mist. It was as though the sky had fallen.

At the same time, the black spear that Lin Xiu brandished produced white lights.

Gold skill – Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall!!!

The powerful force caused Cheng Fan’s expression to change.

Just as his body wanted to dodge instinctively, he realized that Lin Xiu’s attack was not at him!

“Be careful!” Right at this time, the other rank 5 warrior turned to look over only for his expression to change.

He thought that Lin Xiu was using the powerful skill against Cheng Fan and was behind Lin Xiu to deal with a fatal strike!

Who would have thought that Lin Xiu would suddenly turn while unleashing the skill and use it on him!

He wanted to use his own weapon to block but was instantly devoured by the lights of the skill.

Bang-

As Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall overwhelmed the guy, his weapon was instantly destroyed while his body exploded into countless pieces!

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing a rank 5 warrior, obtaining 10 million experience points!”

‘Another 10 million!’

All this happened while Luo Yue was against the other two rank 5 warriors.

The thin sword in Luo Yue’s hands unleashed endless attacks on them, her sword arts were sharp and precise, giving the two a great deal of pressure.

They did not know what bizarre skill she was using as well that enveloped her sword with a frigid cold aura.

Whenever her sword collided with their weapons, it would cause a layer of frost on their weapons.

This frost made their hands extremely cold and holding their weapons would instead feel more painful.

“We need to kill her, otherwise we will die!” The two glanced at each other and roared. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

If this went on, they were bound to die!

They no longer held back and used their best skills as they attacked Luo Yue!

Even so, Luo Yue remained calm and indifferent as she blocked their skills with ease.

“Who would have thought that I would get cheated by you.” Cheng Fan glared at Lin Xiu coldly and said.

He did not expect that someone would suddenly change their target to another person when unleashing a skill.

This even led to the death of his teammate.

“It’s your turn now.” Lin Xiu ignored his words and held the spear tightly as he performed a thrust at Cheng Fan.

“Stop bragging, you must have used some forbidden medicine to increase your strength. Once it is over, you’re definitely dead!”

Cheng Fan believed that Lin Xiu had ingested some forbidden medicine. He decided to delay time instead of going head-on with Lin Xiu until Lin Xiu became weaker!

Lin Xiu’s eyes changed, he did not ingest anything but the aftereffect state of Fury was the same as consuming forbidden medicine.

He still had four minutes and had to kill him within that time limit!

Without further ado, Lin Xiu shot forward like an arrow!

As expected!

Seeing Lin Xiu’s slightly anxious state Cheng Fan believed that he had guessed right. He believed that he only needed to defend against Lin Xiu and wait for the effects of the drug to disappear before killing Lin Xiu!
