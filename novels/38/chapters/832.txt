Chapter 833: Technology From Another Planet

One of the warriors turned around and glared at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue as he screamed in rage.

“Why didn’t you warn him?!”

After being questioned, Lin Xiu frowned and said, “I already told him to be careful.”

“Plus, I am not your parent. I don’t have to take care of you.”

“You...”

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, his face turned dark and wanted to attack Lin Xiu.

“That’s enough.”

Then, Chen Dong stood in front of Lin Xiu.

“Just be careful.”

The warrior glared at Lin Xiu and was forced to stop.

“Lin Xiu, did you find anything odd just now?”

Chen Dong was curious as well as he asked Lin Xiu.

It was true that he felt danger and immediately dodged it but he didn’t think that such a terrifying explosion would happen.

The rocks on the ground around them had melted away because of the explosion.

It definitely showed how scary the explosion was.

“A fly.”

Lin Xiu said flatly.

“A fly?”

Chen Dong was stunned.

“It was something like a fly. I have no idea why it suddenly exploded.”

Lin Xiu remembered Luo Yue mentioned about hearing a buzzing sound earlier and that’s when he saw the flying object.

The object looked like a fly and there was nothing odd about it.

However, when it landed on the warrior’s neck and he hit on it, it suddenly let out such a horrible explosion.

“Could it be an android fly?”

Chen Dong hesitated for a moment before asking.

“If it was those, they could have been a decoy. They might look like a fly but it is a robot with a security camera and with a self-destruct ability.”

“Would that be even possible? An android fly could be so powerful?”

Some of them questioned Chen Dong as they couldn’t believe it.

It’s true that android flies do exist but the cost of producing one was extremely high.

Plus, they were in the era where every single human being were warriors and thus these little things could no longer harm them.

But....the explosion earlier was definitely much scarier than they could imagine.

“I don’t know but what I’m sure is, there are others on this island.” 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Chen Dong suddenly looked solemn.

Wung wung wung – –

Suddenly, there was a loud buzz that surrounded them.

This time, most of them could hear it clearly.

“Be careful! Something’s coming!”

Chen Dong picked up his weapon and screamed to his men.

As they looked around, there were numerous fly-like creatures that were flying toward them in each direction.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

These flies did not target the entire crowd. Instead, there were small, minor laser beams that appeared on their bodies.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue had a change of expression on their faces and quickly dodged it.

These laser beams looked much stronger than those that the crew had on the ship.

As for the rocks and trees around them, there were multiple tiny holes that appeared.

“HMPH!”

Lin Xiu sneered and swung his long spear!

Koong Loong – –

At that moment, there was another huge explosion.

The sound was so loud that it hurt their eyedrum.

The entire ground shook vigorously with the explosion.

Luo Yue turned towards Lin Xiu. When she noticed that he had released his ‘Yuan’ and was not injured, she felt relieved.

“Everyone! Get down!”

Chen Dong released his own ‘Yuan’ as well. As he tried to dodge the drone flies, he screamed to the rest of his men.

The laser beams from these flies were horrifying. Even with the ‘Yuan’ around them, they could still feel as if their ‘Yuan’ was being struck by the laser beams and was about to break.

This was frightening. Were there such horrifying technologies available?

Even for a warrior king like him, his ‘Yuan’ might not be able to take the attacks from the laser beams.

If there was a larger group of them that attacked them...

As he thought about it, he felt his scalp turn numb.

“What should we do? Do we attack?!”

As for the rest of them, they finally got to release their ‘Yuan’ and started dodging the flies.

After seeing how terrifying the explosion was after Lin Xiu attacked it, they didn’t dare to attack the flies light-heartedly.

With such a strong explosion, they would still be injured by the huge impact coming from it even if they had their ‘Yuan’.

“Fine.”

Lin Xi shook his head helplessly. With the control of his mind, there were arrays that appeared.

As for the flies, they were all trapped inside the arrays.

“What’s that?”

As Chen Dong was looking at the flies and was still thinking if he should attack those flies, the flies were suddenly trapped in the arrays and he was thoroughly shocked.

“It’s alright. Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu said flatly.

He wasn’t doing this to help the warriors. It was only because the flies were too dense and he was worried that it might hurt Luo Yue.

It hasn’t been long since Luo Yue had woken up.

“You’re the one who did it?”

Chen Dong asked Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Lin Xiu had nothing else to say.

As for the rest of them, they were all filled with shock after seeing what happened.

He filled the Overload Octopus and now, he had just released such mysterious strength.

This young man.....what rank was he at?!

The warrior that questioned Lin xiu earlier suddenly felt chills shooting down his spine.

“How do we get rid of this?”

Seeing how the transparent arrays had trapped all the drone flies, Chen Dong asked Lin Xiu for his opinion.

“Destroy.”

The rest of the crowd continued walking and with Lin Xiu’s control, all of the arrays expanded.

It was followed by multiple loud explosions.

It felt as if the entire island started shaking once again.

The loud explosion noise hit their ears once again.

“Leader Chen, would it be possible for you to explain what happened?”

“Yes! How could those laser beams be so terrifying?”

“It’s not possible for drone flies to be so scary!”

As they continued their journey, some of the warriors turned around and asked Chen Dong.

Warriors were strong and they were not afraid of laser beams as they would be protected by their ‘Yuan’.

Plus, as the warriors become stronger with their levels getting higher, the strength of the ‘Yuan’ would be stronger as well.

However, the tiny laser beams that the drone flies had given out could have such terrifying penetrative strength.

It only got even more terrifying as they were reminded about it.

“I’m not sure. I have never seen such powerful laser beams as well.”

Chen Dong shook his head.

“There wouldn’t be such things on this planet. It’s not a technology from the Marqi planet.”

“You’re saying...”

“That’s right. It’s possible that on this island, there are others from the another planet.”
