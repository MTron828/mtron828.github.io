Chapter 527: Dark Spirit Fruit

Although there were a lot of them, Lin Xiu was not afraid at all.

Because his advantage was obvious, that is, he was not afraid of the lightning that bursts from the bodies of these evolved beasts!

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu over there thoughtfully.

She didn’t know why Lin Xiu was so keen to deal with these low-level evolved beasts, Luo Yue felt that it should be related to Lin Xiu’s cultivation technique.

Thinking of this, she stood nearby and watched Lin Xiu’s battle, she didn’t seem to have any intention of going up to help. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Lin Xiu frantically waved the spear in his hand, and used the skills such as ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ and ‘Awe of the phoenix’, which consume less energy. After about half an hour, all the evolved beasts here were eliminated.

“Finally…” Lin Xiu took a deep breath at this time, feeling a little tired.

Taking a closer look at the system, he actually gained hundreds of millions of experience!

Cool!

Lin Xiu looked in front and found a huge tree.

This tree was different from ordinary trees, it was completely black but at that time it seemed like it had been painted, and it was smooth and reflective.

And the leaves of this tree were dark red, and there were some dark black fruits on this tree, which looked very strange.

What kind of tree is this?

“It seems to be a dark spirit fruit.” There were too many evolved beasts just now, and he didn’t pay attention to this side. At this time, Luo Yue saw the strange tree in the distance, with a slightly surprised look in her eyes, and then walked over then said to Lin Xiu.

Dark Spirit Fruit?

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu was also stunned for a while, then searched the information in his mind, and knew that this was a mutated fruit tree, which seemed to have absorbed the energy between heaven and earth, and evolved to have a certain spirituality. After taking this fruit, one’s physical fitness would be improved to a certain extent.

Of course, only those who had taken this fruit would have the most obvious effect.

This thing was quite precious. It was a rare item in the Warrior Mall and he didn’t expect to see it here.

“Brother, thank you.” At this moment, a middle-aged man came over, stood in front of Lin Xiu, and laughed.

There were dozens of warriors behind him, and their faces looked a little tired.

“It’s fine.” Lin Xiu glanced at them, then shook his head and said.

He didn’t actually want to save these people and merely wanted to gain experience. Of course, Lin Xiu didn’t say it directly.

“Get to know each other, my name is Jiang Tao.” The middle-aged man said aloud at this time.

“Lin Xiu.” Lin Xiu, seeing that the middle-aged man had no ill intentions, said aloud at this time.

“You are also looking for space cracks?” Lin Xiu asked before the middle-aged man could continue to speak.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Jiang Tao was stunned for a moment, then shook his head and said with a wry smile, “We are a team that often hunts evolved beasts in the Thunder Valley and we have also heard about space cracks recently, but we haven’t seen it with our own eyes.”

“Our aim is to…”

“Do you want the Dark Spirit Fruit?” Looking at Jiang Tao’s hesitant look, Lin Xiu said lightly.

“That’s right.” Jiang Tao looked at Lin Xiu and said directly with a bitter smile.

They saw the dark spirit fruit here and wanted to take it but there were too many evolved beasts and they had been preparing for a long time to kill these evolved beasts.

But didn’t expect that the final result would be so tragic.

If Lin Xiu hadn’t killed these evolved beasts, they would probably be finished this time.

“We want two and you guys can have the rest.” Lin Xiu looked at the dark spirit fruit tree, and said lightly.

Lin Xiu glanced at it just now and found that there were only two dark spirit fruits that have matured and these two had the best effect.

He and Luo Yue could take them.

“Really?!” Not only Jiang Tao, but the others were also pleasantly surprised when they heard Lin Xiu’s words.

Lin Xiu had dealt with most of the evolved beasts just now and with Lin Xiu’s strength, even if he didn’t give them any, they couldn’t do anything.

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu nodded. Although this dark spirit fruit was very precious, he didn’t have time to wait for all the remaining fruits to ripen.

“Thank you!” Jiang Tao and the others were all excited.

Lin Xiu smiled, then said to Luo Yue who was standing beside him, “Luo Yue, have you eaten this before?”

It was said that the effect of this dark spirit fruit would be maximized only when you eat it for the first time. If you eat it again, it would not have much effect.

Luo Yue shook her head.

“Let’s try it then.” Lin Xiu walked over to the dark spirit fruit tree and said aloud.

Whoosh whoosh—

At the same time, a sound of breaking through the air came.

Jiang Tao and the others turned to look behind them, and saw some huge birds and beasts flying over here!

“People from the Royal Beast Sect!?” When Jiang Tao saw this scene, the expression in his eyes suddenly changed greatly.

“Hahaha, Bai Fei, I didn’t expect that we found the Dark Spirit Fruit Tree!” A man riding a huge bird beast that landed directly on the Dark Spirit Fruit Tree shouted to the sky at this time.

Soon, more than twenty warriors riding on birds beasts landed in front.

“Young Master Bai, look!” At this time, some warriors respectfully said to Bai Fei who jumped from the bird beast.

Bai Fei was a young man who wore a very precious battle suit. At one glance, you would know that he was not an ordinary person.

“Yes, this dark spirit fruit tree is ours.” Bai Fei looked very excited when he saw this dark spirit fruit tree.

“This is the evolved beast herd that Brother Lin destroyed. We fought with our lives to get it, it’s not yours!” Jiang Tao walked over at this time, and then roared loudly.

With his loud roar, the warriors behind him also stepped forward and dozens of people surrounded them.

Bai Fei raised his brows, glanced at Jiang Tao and the others, and said lightly, “I said it is mine.”

He sounded like nobody was allowed to refute his words.

He said it was his, it was his, and there was why or how.

“Let me give you guys two words.” Lin Xiu stood up, glanced at the people from the Royal Beast Sect, and said lightly.

“Get lost.”

“Boy, you’re courting death!” Hearing Lin Xiu’s arrogant words, one of the men from the Royal Beast Sect suddenly had a change in expression and he attacked Lin Xiu with the sword he was holding!

Lin Xiu sneered, and with a direct stroke of the spear in his right hand, the sword that the man was holding was blown away by the powerful force!
