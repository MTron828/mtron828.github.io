1259 Envoy Liu

“It’s alright. I gave those to you.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“What I need would be more than these.”

“How many do you need?”

!!

Lei Chong asked subconsciously.

“About a thousand of them.”

Lin Xiu glanced at him.

“A thousand?!”

Lei Chong’s eyes were widened as he couldn’t believe what he had just heard!

It was already extremely difficult for them to even find a hundred odd crystals and now he wants a thousand of them?!

How would that be possible?

“Changqing City should be bigger than Shachang City, right?”

Lin Xiu asked Mr Pang who was standing next to him.

“En.”

Mr Pang nodded his head.

“I have also heard that after we’ve destroyed the Shachang City, those from Changqing City have taken over that city.”

“Oh?”

Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows when he heard what Mr Pang said.

Those from Changqing City seemed pretty ambitious.

“I guess we shall head over and borrow some from them.”

Baili Haoling already knew about how Lin Xiu needed odd crystals to rebuild his weapon. She gently moistened her lips as a murderous look appeared in her eyes.

She was ready to fight and was always willing to start a mess.

“Lei Chong and Mr Pang, make sure you take good care of our city. Haoling and I will be out to borrow some odd crystals from them.”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

Lei Chong, on the other hand, felt his scalp turn numb when he heard how Lin Xiu wanted to borrow odd crystals.

While Lin Xiu was saying that he wanted to borrow them, he was just there to rob these people.

However, those from Changqing City would be more powerful than those in Shachang City and Lei Chong couldn’t help but start getting worried for them.

“Please be careful.”

Mr Pang knew that he wouldn’t be able to stop Lin Xiu and this was the only thing that he could say.

“En. Just take good care of our place.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

Boom – –

Just when Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling were about to leave, there was a loud explosion that appeared in the air.

“Those from Lingxian City! Show yourself!!!”

There was another loud explosion that followed.

“Envoy Liu?”

When they heard the man’s voice, Mr Pang’s face turned pale.

“Who’s that?”

Lin Xiu was feeling curious.

“He is the special envoy of Changqing City and he’s responsible for monitoring the cities that are under the control of Changqing City.”

Mr Pang quickly explained it to Lin Xiu.

“Let’s take a look outside.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and walked out with the rest of them, before flying into the sky.

When he took a good look outside, he could see that there were dozens of drones in the air.

All of the drones had powerful laser cannons installed in them and they were attacking the energy barrier of Lingxian City.

Boom – –

Explosions followed one after another.

However, the energy barrier remained firm and there wasn’t even a single crack.

Envoy Liu was a middle aged man with long hair. As he stood on one of the bigger drones and looked at what was happening, he had a hideous expression on his face.

“The city lord of this city!!! Show yourself! Otherwise, you will regret this!!”

Envoy Liu gathered his energy and screamed as loudly as possible with his penetrative voice.

Just as he was done, he saw Lin Xiu and his gang who was in the air as well.

When he saw who they were, Envoy Liu sneered, “I was just thinking that perhaps all your idiots finally had the guts to go against our rule.”

“Mr Pang, what do you think you’re doing? Now that you saw who I am, how dare you still leave this energy barrier open?!”

...

Seeing how one of them was Mr Pang, Envoy Liu was mad.

Mr Pang was his name since he only has a last name. Everyone was only calling him Mr Pang as such and it wasn’t because they were being respectful.

“Envoy Liu, what do you think you’re doing by attacking our energy barrier?”

Mr Pang wasn’t afraid of him and in return, questioned the man opposite him.

“Hahahahahah! Just because you are working with a warrior that is slightly skillful, you’ve got the audacity to talk to me in such a wild manner?”

Envoy Liu was pissed when he heard how Mr Pang had answered him.

His eyes were filled with rage as he glared at Mr Pang before diverting his attention to Lin Xiu.

“So, you’re the new city lord?”

“Yes. What is it that you want?”

Lin Xiu smiled as he spoke in a cold tone.

Lin Xiu also noticed that there was a familiar mark on his uniform.

...

This mark seems to be representative of Changqing City and it was the same as the one seen on the man who came with the frosty giant sword.

From how this was going, this man must be from Changqing City.

As he thought about it, there was a murderous look that slowly appeared in Lin Xiu’s eyes.

Since these people dug their own graves, Lin Xiu would then slaughter all of them here in exchange for EXP.

“Our city lord had sent me to invite you for lunch at Changqing City.”

Envoy Liu spoke proudly.

He acted as if this command was a blessing from the Gods.

“Oh? I was heading towards Changqing City as well.”

Lin Xiu purposely looked shocked.

“Without the approval of the city, why would a small warrior like you from LIngxian City want to go to Changqing City?!”

Envoy Liu frowned as he screamed with rage.

“To borrow some odd crystals. We ran out of it and thought of getting some from Changqing City.”

Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders as if he was innocent.

“You’re dead!!”

After hearing how Lin Xiu was provoking him, Envoy Liu was pissed.

Boom boom – –

All of the drones around them continued firing at their energy barrier.

However, it remained untouched.

“Haoling, we shall….”

“Kill them all.”

With that said, Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling went straight towards the drones!

Xiu – –

In the blink of an eye, both of them appeared outside of the energy barrier.

“Kill them all!!!!!”

Envoy Liu was fuming mad when he saw this.

With that said, there was a large amount of laser beams that were shot at Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

However, both of them had quick reflexes and none of the laser beams landed on Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling.

All of them landed on the energy barrier behind them.

“Hmph!”

Baili Haoling’s eyes were blood red and she started attacking one of the drones with her daggers.

Boom – –

One of the huge drones was chopped into pieces by Baili Haoling’s daggers!

A few of the warriors ran out of the drones and started attacking Lin Xiu.

“You came at the right time.” Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Lin Xiu looked at the warriors who surrounded him and started moving both his arms.

[Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist!]

It has been a long time since Lin Xiu has used these warrior skills and it wasn’t a high grade one as well but Lin Xiu’s abilities have been greatly improved which was why it still let out a surge of horrifying energy.

Boom – –

When these warriors were hit by Lin Xiu’s fist, their skull instantly ruptured.

There was a large amount of lightning around the warriors and all of their skin had been charred.

Envoy Liu who was standing far away couldn’t help but look shocked when he saw what happened.

He didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would be someone so powerful!

“Even if you’re strong, it would still be impossible for you to defeat me!!!”
