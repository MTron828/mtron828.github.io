Chapter 488: Don’t Worry, I’m Here

Lin Xiu said coldly and started to lift his right foot.

“What are you going to do!!! If you dare to provoke the Chen family, you are dead!” One of Chen Jinqian’s lackeys who had just been kicked out by Lin Xiu saw this scene and his expression changed as he struggled to get up.

Lin Xiu glanced at him, then stepped on his arm with one foot!!!

Click, click, click——

There was the sound of crushing bones.

“Ah!!!” Chen Jinqian let out a painful wail at this time, which was echoed throughout the whole passageway.

“What’s going on!?” Some medical staff rushed over and they were shocked when they saw the situation at this time.

“Oh, they seem to be here for treatment, but they might have found the wrong door.” Lin Xiu looked at the medical staff who ran over and said faintly.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s faint murderous intent, the medical staff trembled.

“We are from the Chen family… Hurry up, take my young master to treatment first…” The man who was kicked out by Lin Xiu couldn’t get up due to the severe pain but he still told the staff.

His eyes were full of horror. They were used to following Chen Jinqian around to commit crimes in this Bai Di City, and this was the first time they had encountered this situation where the roles were reversed.

And with Chen Jingqian beaten up like this, they would definitely be blamed by the Chen family.

“Hurry…hurry up and call the nurse!” When a doctor heard that the man said it was someone from the Chen family, his face changed drastically.

Soon, as the nurses carried Chen Jinqian and other injured men away, the place instantly became empty.

The middle-aged woman looked at Lin Xiu with surprise. She didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would be so brutal.

“You shouldn’t have been so rash just now.” But then she seemed to think of something, and then sighed at Lin Xiu.

After all, this was the territory of the Chen family. Although Lin Xiu looked like a good warrior, even if he is strong, can he fight against the Chen family?

“They are members of the Chen family, I guess they won’t let you off so easily…”

“Don’t worry, I’m here.” Seeing Ye Shuang’er casting a worried look at Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu rubbed her head then said with a smile.

“En.” Ye Shuang’er originally wanted to say something, but simply nodded instead.

She didn’t know when did Lin Xiu seem to become more and more mature, and it made people feel safe.

“After your father’s operation is done, let’s leave this place.” Seeing how Lin Xiu and Ye Shuang’er were still unaware of the horror of the Chen family, the middle-aged woman reminded them.

“Why don’t we kill them.”

Just when the middle-aged woman wanted to continue to say something, Luo Yue, who had been silent, said lightly.

“Kill…Kill them?” The middle-aged woman’s eyes widened at this time, as if she couldn’t believe Luo Yue’s words.

Because Luo Yue has not spoken just now, she looked like a very quiet and sweet girl.

But what she didn’t expect was that she would simply say to kill those people as soon as she spoke. This contrast shocked the middle-aged woman.

“Ahem, she was kidding.” Lin Xiu looked at Ye Shuang’er at this time, then at the shocked middle-aged woman, and then said aloud.

Luo Yue’s brows furrowed slightly. When she was about to say something, she saw Lin Xiu’s eyes and quickly understood what Lin Xiu meant.

“Just kidding.” Luo Yue said lightly.

Ye Shuang’er laughed and said, “Big Sister, you are so cute.”

Cute?

Luo Yue was stunned when she heard Ye Shuang’er’s words. This word didn’t match with her at all.

Lin Xiu saw this scene and found it a little funny.

“Hm…” Ye Shuang’er’s mother, who was lying on the hospital bed at this moment, move her body slightly and opened her eyes slowly.

“Mom!” Ye Shuang’er clearly noticed this and called out in surprise.

“Shuang’er…? Why are you here?” Ye Shuang’er’s mother’s vision was still blurred but she recognized Ye Shuang’er’s voice.

Rubbing her eyes, she could see Ye Shuang’er in front of her.

“En, mom, how are you feeling now? Are you alright?” Ye Shuang’er nodded, and then said anxiously.

“I’m fine, this is the hospital? Where’s your dad!?” Ye Shuang’er’s mother seemed to have thought of something at this time and then said anxiously.

“Dad has gone to surgery now, there should be no major problem.” Ye Shuang’er briefly described the situation just now to her mother.

“You’re Lin Xiu?” Ye Shuang’er’s mother said while looking at Lin Xiu with her eyes wide open.

“We haven’t seen each other for two or three years, right? You have become a handsome young man.”

“Nah.” Lin Xiu said with a smile.

The middle-aged woman looked at how Lin Xiu looked like an honest boy but recalled how vicious Lin Xiu looked just now.

“This is…” Ye Shuang’er’s mother also saw Luo Yue here.

Seeing Luo Yue’s expressionless face, but with extremely delicate features, Ye Shuang’er’s mother was also surprised.

What a beautiful girl. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“She is Lin Xiu’s girlfriend.” Ye Shuang’er’s eyes shifted, then she whispered in her mother’s ear.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue’s hearing was very good, and of course they could hear Ye Shuang’er’s words.

Lin Xiu glanced at Luo Yue, Luo Yue seemed to have no reaction at all, and he didn’t know if it was her default expression or if she was pretending that she didn’t hear it.

“By the way, Lin Xiu, you look pretty strong now, you’re almost a warrior right?” Ye Shuang’er’s mother said to Lin Xiu with a smile at this time.

Because she knew that Lin Xiu looked a little weak before and was always at the bottom.

But Lin Xiu looked a lot stronger than before, and he has a confident look that she has never seen before.

“Mom, Brother Lin Xiu has long been an official warrior, and this morning, it was Brother Lin Xiu and sister Luo Yue who came to rescue us!” Ye Shuang’er said aloud at this time.

Then she also recounted what happened this morning.

“Good, Lin Xiu has finally become a man now.” Ye Shuang’er’s mother smiled in relief at this time.

Because Lin Xiu’s late parents had a good relationship with them, they all treated Lin Xiu like half their son.
