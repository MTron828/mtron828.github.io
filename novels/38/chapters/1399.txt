1400 Frozen Heart

Apart from the broken battle uniforms on the ground, there were also some dark green bone fragments.

“The Ma family… belong to the Ma family!”

The bald man identified it carefully and seemed to recognize something quickly.

“The genius of the Ma family this year is Ma Yun. From this point of view…”

!!

While muttering to himself, his eyes suddenly looked toward the passage.

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu had already left the passage at this time.

The bald man’s body trembled and there was a look of fear on his face.

There is no doubt that the man just now seems to have forced Ma Yun to blow himself up!

No wonder when he was about to come in, he felt the space vibrate as if it was about to collapse.

“Brother, what should we do now?”

One of the warriors couldn’t help but speak out.

This top ‘door’ must have the best things.

They were really a little bit unwilling to let Lin Xiu leave just like that.

“I doubt even with the strength of five of us, we wouldn’t be able to deal with him.”

The bald man has self-knowledge.

They couldn’t even deal with Ma Yun yet this man forced Ma Yun to blow himself up, so his strength must be very strong.

If they ran out to block his way now, isn’t it just courting death?

“But he took so many things…”

At this moment, he seemed to have thought of something and a sinister look appeared on his face.

At the same time, Lin Xiu had already walked out.

As soon as he walked out, before he had time to move, Lin Xiu’s body quickly disappeared in place.

Boom, boom, boom——

The space just now, at this time, has already begun to crack.

The five warriors also rushed to the exit.

“Where is this?”

As soon as Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared, he realized that his current position had changed.

Under his feet, he seemed to be stepping on a stone.

Taking a closer look, he saw that he was now in a space surrounded by various stone walls.

And on the surrounding stone walls, there were circles of seats suspended in the air.

These seats were not big, just enough for one person to sit on.

There seem to be 99 of them in total.

“Huh? Someone came over again?”

At this time, God Warrior, who had already arrived here, looked at Lin Xiu’s figure and suddenly sneered.

Lin Xiu also glanced at these people.

Taking a closer look, there were already dozens of God warriors here.

They stood in the middle, looking at everything around them, but they didn’t make any movements.

It seemed like they were waiting for something.

Lin Xiu also remained silent at this time, standing where he was, waiting with them.

Boom——

At the same time, Luo Yue on the other side was holding a long sword with thin wings and with one sword, she split the body of a huge dragon in half.

Although the strength of this dragon was very strong.

But it was an ice dragon.

And Luo Yue’s main attribute strength was ice.

So for Luo Yue, although this ice dragon was a bit difficult to deal with, it is not too challenging.

As Luo Yue beheaded the ice dragon, its body also quickly melted away at a speed visible to the naked eye.

And as its body melted away, she could clearly feel the ground around her begin to vibrate.

The ground in front of it was cracked and something started to protrude from the ground.

At this moment, Luo Yue turned her eyes to the front and she could clearly see that there was a white light group like snowflakes in front of her.

“Frozen Heart.”

Luo Yue looked at this thing with surprise in her eyes.

This thing was one of the best things for warriors who use ice attribute power.

Luo Yue wiped off the blood that flowed from the corner of her mouth because of the battle just now and continued to walk forward.

Walking in front of the Frozen Heart, Luo Yue hesitated for a moment, then reached out and touched the Frozen Heart.

As soon as her white and slender fingers touched the Frozen Heart, she could clearly feel that an extremely cold force was transmitted from her fingers to her body in an instant.

...

Kala Kala——

At this moment, Luo Yue’s body seemed to be frozen in an instant!

But even so, the power of the Frozen heart seems to be slowly spreading into Luo Yue’s body.

It seems to be being absorbed by Luo Yue.

After some time. the power of the Frozen Heart was slowly absorbed, and Luo Yue, who had become an ice sculpture, began to crack.

The whole body appeared again in an instant.

“Is this the power of Frozen Heart…”

At this moment, Luo Yue looked at her hands and muttered to herself.

His eyes were full of surprise.

At this time, with a wave of her hands, the ice cubes around her immediately flew into the air.

Soon, they formed a giant ice dragon!

...

Luo Yue held the thin-winged long sword that had just been inserted into the ground and at the next moment, jumped directly on the body of the ice dragon and flew out directly with the ice dragon!

“Huhu, damn it, it’s finally killed.”

At this time, Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen watched a giant beast fall to the ground in front of them, panting.

From the moment they entered the first gate, they encountered powerful evolved beasts.

But with their strength, they were easily killed.

And got good items.

They continued to walk toward the front ‘door’ again. Although it was a little more difficult this time, they managed to get through it.

Next, they directly chose the underground ‘door’ at the back.

But what they didn’t expect at all was that this time, the creature they encountered was simply not on the same level as the one just now.

It’s too scary. The two of them almost died here.

“Continue, there are too many good things here, we must search for them all!”

After Xiao Qingchen rested for a while, she stood up to fight.

“En.”

Yuan Zhen also nodded. After entering this kind of door leading to the underground three times, things they obtained got better and better, which made them look forward to it even more. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

It’s just that what they didn’t expect at all was that as soon as they went out this time, their bodies were directly teleported away!

“This is…”

When they reacted, they realized that they were already in another space.

Here, there are already hundreds of God warriors standing here.

Seeing the appearance of these two people, some God warriors looked at them.

But it was just a glance and they didn’t stare at them.

“You guys are here?”

At the same time, Lin Xiu clearly felt something. Looking back, he saw Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zhen.
