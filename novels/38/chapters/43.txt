Excellent, once more!

“Torrential storm of rose flowers!” Lin Xiu bellowed as he thrust forward with Silver Immortal Spear.

Following cold gleams of light, four holes appeared on another wall.

The terrifying technique with the powerful might he had unleashed previously that destroyed the wall did not appear.

“To gain enlightenment on profound intent is not so easy. You were lucky, so be happy with it.” Xu Wen advised enviously.

One had to rely on their feeling to be successful with gaining enlightenment on profound intent.

And Lin Xiu could be considered to have extreme luck to accidentally gain slight enlightenment upon using the silver card.

If he had already gained a bit of enlightenment, why should he be afraid of not gaining it again?

“I’m so jealous…” Li Yi sighed, it was extremely infuriating to witness such a thing.

It was just like hunting for a set of equipment in a game and unable to obtain it after killing the same monster tens of thousands of times, yet someone else immediately obtained it after a short while. How could one not feel jealousy and hatred?

Lin Xiu chuckled and clenched his fist. It was truly unexpected happiness.

So long as he continued to train, he believed that he would gain the opportunity to be enlightened on profound intent again.

“Alright, it’s about enough rest, let’s continue to head down!” At this time, Xu Wen looked at the other soldiers seated down and announced.

“Yes!”

They walked down the stairs and heard noises.

Some of the zombies from before were actually charging upwards and even brought down the steel doors and surged upwards.

Lin Xiu frowned and stabbed forward with his spear.

A zombie’s head exploded with his accurate aim.

The soldiers only reacted after the kill and started using their guns to open fire.

Sou sou sou—

Laser gun sounds came out endlessly and pierced through the zombies.

A large number of zombie corpses lay on the ground.

In a short span of time, the zombies that had blocked the path were decimated.

“We should be able to rest now. We will begin preparing for Operation Clean-up. Pay attention and don’t get bitten.” Xu Wen walked to the front and said.

All the soldiers were slightly numb from being surrounded by the zombies earlier but had no other choice as it was their mission.

If they did not comply and became army deserters, they would implicate their own families and everyone would be listed as wanted criminals!

They could not leave and only fight with their lives on the line!

“Why do you look excited?” Li Yi was originally afraid but saw Lin Xiu already holding Silver Immortal Spear tightly. Lin Xiu had walked to the front and looked extremely ready to attack, so Li Yi could not help but ask.

“For experience.”

“Experience?”

“Cough cough, experience on killing zombies.” Lin Xiu laughed and replied.

He had obtained a great deal of experience from killing all the zombies earlier. He had tasted the sweetness from the experience notifications.

To the others, it might be Hell. But to Lin Xiu, it was simply Heaven.

Top grade heaven!

A soldier walked towards a shutter door and reached out to pull it up when a fast zombie suddenly pounced on him!

He was taken aback. He did not see any shadows or zombies when he looked inside from the window, how did the zombie suddenly appear?!

He was not in time to react due to the shock.

But in the moment of peril, a gleam of light flickered and a hole appeared on the zombie’s head.

“Be careful.” Lin Xiu pulled his spear from the zombie’s head and said indifferently.

He regained himself when he heard Lin Xiu’s voice and slowly staggered in to push the corpse away.

“Thank… thank you.” The soldier gasped and looked at Lin Xiu with gratitude.

This was just a brief interlude. Upon going outside, roars could be heard.

“What’s that?” Xu Wen walked out and cast his gaze over. His pupils immediately constricted.

“Sabertooth Hound, rank 2 evolved beats.” Lin Xiu answered.

It was exactly like what they saw from before, but it was larger in size.

And they were fighting against a group of zombies.

“No, it should be a rank 3 evolved beast!”

“What?!” Everyone exclaimed when they heard Lin Xiu’s words.

He used the analytical eye and identified it as a rank 3 leader, Sabertooth Hound!

Its traits were extreme speed and sharp claws and fangs. A rank 1 warrior could be instantly ripped apart if caught.

“I think it is just a rank 2, we don’t have to be afraid.” A soldier held onto his blade and scoffed.

He had killed Sabertooth Hounds before who were about as strong as ordinary rank 1 warriors. So long as they were careful, it was extremely safe.

The large Sabertooth Hound howled and the heads of the zombies around instantly exploded.

After dealing with the zombies, it turned and glared at the humans.

Its eyes were blood red and filled with murderous intent.

It bent its limbs and pushed forward. The launch speed was so fast that it looked like it teleported over! RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Seeking death!” The soldier immediately charged forward with the blade in hand as he intended to hack the Sabertooth Hound in two!

They had agreed previously that the odd crystals belonged to whoever killed the evolved beasts. A rank 2 odd crystal was worth a lot of money.

“Don’t!” Xu Wen did not believe Lin Xiu’s words and thought that this was a rank 2 Sabertooth Hound as well.

But when he saw the speed at which the Sabertooth Hound had flown over, he immediately felt something was wrong.

It was not only huge but extremely powerful!

The ground started to tremble as it ran over.

“Go and die!” The man charged in front of the Sabertooth Hound and leaped upwards as he hacked down with the blade!

But just as the blade slashed down, the Sabertooth Hound increased its speed and smashed into his chest.

What?!

The instantaneous attack was too fast and exceeded his calculations.

He smashed right down to the ground.

But the soldier was experienced, although he was thrown to the ground, he reacted fast enough to use the blade and slashed at the Sabertooth Hound’s neck!

Bang!
