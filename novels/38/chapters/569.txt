“What if he wins the challenge?” Qu Tingting heard his words and felt a bit upset as she looked at him and said. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“If he can reach the 60th floor, I will give you the rare diamond skill card I got at the 42nd floor!” The man said loudly.

“Then you better get ready to take it out.” Qu Tingting said.

“But if he can’t, why don’t you promise me something?” The man glanced at Qu Tingting, then showed a wretched smile.

“Hng, you are going to lose for sure.” Qu Tingting snorted.

But then she regretted it. Although Lin Xiu was the strongest amongst the freshmen, it wasn’t so easy to reach the 60th floor.

It’s just that this man agitated her so she said that.

However, if this man asked for something too overboard, she could just leave directly.

Looking up, she looked at the 30th floor of the Tower of Trial and the figure of Lin Xiu had disappeared.

For some reason, when Qu Tingting saw Lin Xiu the first time, she already had a feeling that he could possibly reach a very high floor.

She couldn’t say why she would feel this way but if she had to, it should be a woman’s intuition.

At the same time, in the Tower of Trial, with the Dark Edge spear in his hand, a purple light flashed on Lin Xiu and Lin Xiu disappeared.

“It’s only the 31st floor, there’s still a long way…”

The person who placed a bet with Qu Tingting just now sneered at this time.

However, after this screen showed that Lin Xiu arrived at the 31st floor, he immediately went up to the 32nd floor!

The man’s eyes widened and had a look of disbelief.

But all this has not yet finished, the rising number of floors was still changing in an incredible speed.

32, 33, 34...

On this screen projection, Lin Xiu was going up one level in the tower almost every five seconds!

This is too horrifying...

“This system ... has a glitch eh…”

The rest of the people were shocked to see this because it was simply unbelievable.

No matter how fast one was, how could he possibly reach this speed?

“Wait, there are Murong, Tian Zhiliang and other rank 5 warriors there, he couldn’t go through that easily.”

Sure enough, after Lin Xiu reached the 40th floor, the number of floors displayed on the screen stopped changing.

This made these people heaved a sigh of relief. The way the numbers jumped just now was simply too scary.

“There’s someone?”

At the same time, Lin Xiu had arrived at the 40th floor and he saw that there were a few men who were fighting with an evolved beast.

There were rays formed by various skills around the battleground and sounds of battle.

In addition to Tang Zhi, who chased after Lin Xiu to kill him just now, this was the first time Lin Xiu encountered another warrior during the challenge.

And this time, he actually met five warriors.

“Damn! This money silver leopard is so difficult to kill.”

One of the warriors commented while fighting.

This money silver leopard was mainly silver, but there were a lot of golden coins on its body.

“A peak rank 6 evolved beast actually made us fight for so long… damn it, did the academy make changes to it?!”

The rest of the warriors who were attacked by the money silver leopard said unhappily.

According to normal conditions, evolved beasts were a rank higher than warriors even when they have equal strength.

For example, a rank 6 evolved beast was actually almost equivalent to a rank 5 warrior.

But everything was not absolute, some rare evolved beasts could fight with the same ranking warriors.

Just like the money silver leopard they were facing now..

Roar–

At this time, this money Silver leopard roared and its eyes became red. Its attacks became fiercer and horrible.

One of the warriors accidentally got its sharp claws on his arm and there was a shade of red instantly as fresh blood flowed out of his arm.

“Get lost!”

However, this warrior obviously had combat experience and did not care about his injured arm. With the boxing glove on his right hand, he threw a punch directly!

Boom–

This hit sent the money Silver Leopard flying to the opposite side.

Lin Xiu looked at the body of this flying money silver leopard and was stunned. At the next moment, he dodged instinctively.

Roar–

This money silver leopard was on the ground but climbed up again.

Looking at Lin Xiu who was nearest to it, it charged towards him directly!

This money silver leopard was very fast, waving its paws and rushing over.

Swish swish swish——

However, Lin Xiu moved fast. This money silver leopard couldn’t get near him at all.

“Seems like I got into trouble the moment I got here.” Lin Xiu smiled, then attack with the Dark Edge spear in his hand!

“Who is he?”

Murong and others saw Lin Xiu and were suddenly stunned.

The five people were tangled with this money silver leopard and didn’t manage to kill it. They didn’t think that there was another person.

And this person looks very young, it is very strange.

However, just as they were taken aback, Lin Xiu took the Dark Edge spear in his hand and attacked smoothly, stabbing the body of the money silver leopard several times.

Blood sputtered all over the ground.

While Lin Xiu attacked, he created a distance between him and this money silver leopard.

This money silver leopard could only get attacked by Lin Xiu’s spear and couldn’t reach Lin Xiu at all.

There was no way.

“Hurry! This money silver leopard is going to die, if he gets to the next floor, we will not have a chance!”

At this time, Tian Zhiliang thought of something and his expression changed.

This challenge was the same as before. As long as one killed an evolved beast on this floor, one would be able to advance to the next floor.

But only the person who killed this money silver leopard could advance to the next floor, not all of the warriors.

After listening to Tian Zhiliang’s words, the rest of the warriors also reacted and didn’t attack the money silver leopard, but they attacked Lin Xiu instead!
