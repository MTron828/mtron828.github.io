1176 Terrifying Divine Mark Giant

What kind of skill is this…!?

Those warriors who were knocked out by Lin Xiu didn’t even have time to get up when they saw the huge arc-shaped white light charging towards them!

It was so powerful and terrifying that when it hits, many space cracks appear in the surrounding space.

But now they had no way to dodge, they could only take this blow directly!

boom–

With a loud noise, the ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’ directly hit their ‘Sphere’, blasting all their ‘Sphere’!

pfft—

As soon as the ‘Sphere’ was broken, the battle uniforms on their bodies were all torn apart by the shock.

Blood spit out directly from their mouths.

And at this moment, they saw a lot of black energy charging towards them!

what is this!?

Seeing this scene, the pupils in their eyes shrank slightly.

Their “Sphere” has just been broken and now there is no way to expand the “Sphere” again.

And those black energies swept over their bodies in an instant.

“what!!!”

In the next moment, they let out a wailing scream at the same time.

‘Silence’.

Immediately after using ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’, Lin Xiu immediately used the skill ‘Silence’.

Those black energies instantly invaded their bodies.

Their bodies slowly became shriveled at a speed visible to the naked eye.

Not long after they struggled, they all fell to the ground.

Dead.

At this time, Lin Xiu ignored these people, turned around and jumped to the sculpture of Bai Lingxian.

He stretched out his hand and directly picked up the secret scroll.

With a thought, the scroll disappeared in Lin Xiu’s hands.

It was put into the expansion space by Lin Xiu.

“Put down the scroll!!!”

Zhao Laosan rushed over at this time and roared loudly.

The sword in his hand has turned blood red.

It looked very weird.

“Haha.”

Lin Xiu sneered when he looked at Zhao Laosan who rushed over.

With a wave of his right hand, the giant formed by the combination of countless divine marks directly attacked Zhao Laosan who was rushing over!

“Get lost!”

Seeing this scene, Zhao Laosan roared angrily, holding the sword in both hands, he was about to chop off the divine mark giant.

But when his sword slashed on the arm of the divine mark giant, he found that he couldn’t cut it at all.

As soon as Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered, the other arm of the divine mark giant blasted directly at his body!

Now Lin Xiu felt that he was connected with the divine mark giant and was able to clearly control the divine mark giant.

The divine mark giant was made up of a large number of divine marks.

Among these Divine Marks, there were extremely powerful Divine marks. The power of this punch was much stronger than the blow of an ordinary God warrior.

Zhao Laosan was caught off guard and was directly knocked to the ground by the divine mark giant.

pfft—

Blood vomited out of his mouth in an instant.

“I’m from the Murder Shrine… If you’re wise… let me go quickly…

Zhao Laosan was not directly smashed to death by the divine mark giant’s fist.

At this time, under the fist of the divine mark giant, Zhao Laosan said with difficulty.

“Murder Shrine…”

“What is that?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

With the triggering of Lin Xiu’s thoughts, the fist of the divine mark giant continued to bombard Zhao Laosan’s body wildly!

boom boom boom —

At this moment, the whole ground shook crazily.

Although Zhao Laosan has source strength to protect his body, he was instantly hammered into meat sauce under the bombardment of such a powerful force of this divine mark giant.

The divine mark giant was too powerful.

When Lin Xiu watched this scene, he was startled.

At this moment, from the corner of Lin Xiu’s eyes, he could clearly see a cold light coming from behind.

A sneer appeared on the corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth and the Dark Edge spear he held in his hand directly blocked it.

Dang–

“A sneak attack?”

Lin Xiu looked back and said to Ye Yu indifferently.

“What Luanxuan Palace, that’s all to it huh.”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Ye Yu’s face suddenly became extremely ugly.

“die!!!”

At this moment, his face became a little grim.

The long sword in his hand burst out with a dazzling golden light.

His golden long sword rattled loudly.

He wanted to continue to stab Lin Xiu with his sword!

Dangdang-

Lin Xiu also reacted very quickly at this time, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand and colliding with his long sword.

This Ye Yu’s strength was indeed incomparably powerful. At this moment, Lin Xiu was shocked and flew out a certain distance.

“Humph.”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and with a move of his right hand, the divine mark giant also moved as Lin Xiu’s right hand was raised.

That Ye Yu originally wanted to continue chasing Lin Xiu, but the moment he rushed over, with Lin Xiu’s fist smashing into the air, the fist of the divine mark giant also directly smashed towards Ye Yu who was rushing over.

The speed of this punch was extremely fast, Ye Yu wanted to kill Lin Xiu and at this time there was no way to dodge this blow.

Boom—

The punch of the divine mark giant directly hit Ye Yu’s ‘Sphere’!

Ye Yu, who had rushed over with a sword and wanted to kill Lin Xiu, flew out.

His body hit the wall behind him heavily.

pfft—

The blood spit out directly.

Because of this blow, his ’round’ also had a lot of cracks.

Ye Yu opened her eyes wide and looked at the divine mark giant over there, with a hint of fear in her eyes.

The power of the divine mark was so terrifying.

“Get away from me!”

Seeing Lin Xiu walking towards him step by step, Ye Yu immediately roared.

But Lin Xiu ignored his words at all and continued to walk.

And the divine mark giant also followed Lin Xiu to Ye Yu’s side.

“Go away!!!”

Ye Yu let out a roar when she was afraid in her heart.

The golden long sword in his hand swung wildly.

One after another, sword energy rushed towards Lin Xiu frantically.

bang bang bang-

Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered and the divine mark giant had already blocked Lin Xiu’s face. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

This divine mark giant not only possesses extremely powerful strength, but also possesses an extremely powerful defense.

Those sword auras that seemed to be able to cut through the space were completely blocked by the divine mark giant at this time.

“Get lost! Get lost! Get lost!!!”

At this time, Ye Yu was already a little crazy and continued to wave the long sword in his hand.

“It’s useless.”

While Lin Xiu spoke, he triggered a thought and the divine mark giant charged directly towards Ye Yu!

Directly ignoring Ye Yu’s attack, he waved that huge Divine mark fist!
