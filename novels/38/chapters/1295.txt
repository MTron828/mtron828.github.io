1296 Controlling the Power of Frost

Flame!?

Fire attribute warrior??

Looking at this scene, the look in Lu Kai’s eyes, who was holding a black sickle, changed slightly.

Soon, the corners of his mouth curled up.

Boom, boom, boom——

These dark blue flaming birds quickly rushed to Lu Kai’s body.

But at this moment, Lu Kai swung the black sickle in his hand and cut all these flaming birds in half!

Dang–

At the next moment, when Lin Xiu’s White Moon spear was about to stab his body, it was blocked by his huge black sickle.

When the weapons collided, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that there was an extremely cold aura coming from his black sickle.

The power of ice attribute!?

That icy breath seemed to freeze his hands.

Just now he thought he might be using the dark attribute.

But he didn’t expect that it turned out to be a warrior majoring in ice attributes!

“Hehe.”

At this time, Lu Kai showed a strange smile, as if saying “you didn’t expect it huh”.

The power of the ice attribute does have a certain restraint effect on Lin Xiu’s flame.

“Freeze!”

At this time, the black sickle in Lu Kai’s hand was shaken violently. After knocking Lin Xiu away, before the terrifying freezing cold, it burst out and charged toward Lin Xiu!

The freezing cold covered the entire surrounding area and there was no way to dodge it.

Kala Kala——

With crisp sounds, the surrounding ground turned into ice.

Lin Xiu’s body was also affected by this terrifying icy air and was frozen into an ice sculpture!

“It seems that I won.”

Lu Kai looked at Lin Xiu who had been frozen into an ice sculpture by his own power and the corners of his mouth immediately raised.

Many people thought that the power he possessed was of the dark attribute, but no one knew that the attribute he possessed was of the ice attribute.

“The result can be announced.”

Click——

The moment Lu Kai finished speaking, clear and crisp sounds came over.

Hm!?

When Lu Kai heard this voice, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

Taking a closer look, he found that Lin Xiu, who had turned into an ice sculpture, had a lot of cracks on his body!

This is impossible!

Seeing this scene, Lu Kai’s expression completely changed.

His icy power was very powerful. If he didn’t dodge at the beginning and was turned into an ice sculpture, there was almost no way to break free.

Even if he could break free, it wouldn’t be so fast!

Kala Kala—— Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

As the crisp sound became louder, the ice sculpture on Lin Xiu’s body exploded instantly.

“Phew, your ice attribute power is indeed quite strong.”

Lin Xiu, who came out of the ice sculpture, patted the ice shards on his body at this time, then said aloud.

Lin Xiu’s face was already a little pale at this time.

What Lin Xiu said was the truth. The ice attribute power used by Lu Kai is indeed a bit strong.

If he didn’t have a heart of frost, although the icy power just now could not directly freeze Lin Xiu to death, it would definitely cause serious damage to Lin Xiu.

“However, I have it too.”

While talking, Lin Xiu stretched out his left hand.

Originally, the surrounding area became icy cold because of Lu Kai’s use of ice-attributed power, but at this moment, as soon as Lin Xiu’s words fell, the surrounding temperature became even lower.

Lu Kai, who originally had a strong resistance to the ice attribute, had a change of expression at this time.

At this moment, when he took a closer look, he found that his body was covered with frost!

This kid used the same method he used to deal with him!

“Damn it!!!”

Lu Kai, who had a relaxed expression before, roared angrily.

The source strength of the body burst out, directly exploding the frost on the body.

But even though the frost on his body was blasted off, he still felt extremely cold.

No, it seems that his cold power was also used by this guy to deal with him!

...

How is this possible!

Lu Kai didn’t have time to think too much, because Lin Xiu had already rushed over with the White Moon spear at this time!

At this time, with Lin Xiu triggering his thoughts, the White Moon spear was filled with dark blue flames.

The entire spear became extremely hot.

If it weren’t for the White Moon spear being made of special metal, it wouldn’t be able to withstand the high temperature.

Dang dang dang——

Lu Kai gritted his teeth, holding his own black sickle to fight against Lin Xiu’s spear.

When the weapons of the two collided, an incomparably loud sound suddenly erupted.

But now Lu Kai, because of the backlash from the cold force, his body has become slower.

“How can you control the power of the ice attribute…”

While fighting Lin Xiu, Lu Kai couldn’t help but speak out.

...

Lin Xiu is so strong when using the power of the fire attribute and now he can even control the power of the ice attribute!

Even the ice attribute power released by him was controlled by him!

“Be careful, don’t talk.”

At the same time that Lin Xiu said lightly, he stabbed again.

Dang–

Lu Kai blocked it with the side of his black sickle and suddenly felt a strong impact and his whole body retreated to the back.

Poof——

The powerful impact made him spit out a mouthful of blood.

At this time, Lu Kai felt extremely aggrieved and wanted to fight back against Lin Xiu, but Lin Xiu’s offensive was so fierce that he didn’t have any chance to fight back.

‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!

Seeing that Lu Kai had just been sent flying to the back by him, Lin Xiu immediately snarled.

The White Moon spear in his hand stabbed directly.

A large amount of black matter surged out of White Moon’s spear and soon formed a huge black dragon.

Following Lin Xiu’s long spear, he attacked Lu Kai who was pushed back to the back!

When Lu Kai saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

He clearly felt that the blow was extremely powerful.

“Sphere!!!”

…

…

At the same time, in an unknown hell, a woman with long white hair cut a huge evolved beast that was rushing towards her in half with a single sword.

“Luo Yue, you’ve improved again. This time, you can kill this tiger-headed beast with one slash!”

Behind her, a woman said enviously.

“Why can’t I participate?”

Luo Yue’s long hair fluttered with the breeze and said to the woman faintly.

Luo Yue now seems to have grown a lot compared to before.

A faint icy breath exuded from her body.
