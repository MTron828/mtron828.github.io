Chapter 204: Fighting Sha Qiu!

Sha Qiu was interested in the Red Fire Lotus.

He had obtained special information and even brought a special box capable of storing special energy dropped from the space cracks.

Who would have thought that Lin Xiu would discover it first?

“You’re talking about the Red Lotus Fire?” Lin Xiu raised an eyebrow and smirked, “It’s in my stomach.”

“Seeking death!!!” Sha Qiu thought that Lin Xiu was intentionally provoking him and immediately flew into a rage. He raised his fist and punched at Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu’s eyes changed when he saw the fist. He raised his spear and stabbed at Sha Qiu’s hand!

Sha Qiu jolted and immediately forced his fist back.

“Class monitor!” The guy behind him called out for him and threw his saber over.

Sha Qiu accepted the saber and erupted with powerful source strength. He enveloped his body and the saber with his source strength.

His slash unleashed a powerful blade aura that produced several cracks on the ground.

Bang-

Lin Xiu snorted and swung Dark Edge upwards and produced a crescent blade of source strength that flew forward!

It collided with the aura produced by Sha Qiu’s blade and produced a loud sound.

The ground around them shook.

“What powerful source strength!” A few Sacred Region Academy students were inwardly shocked.

‘Isn’t the south campus’ Class 10 at the bottom? How can there be a warrior capable of being Sha Qiu’s equal?’

Sha Qiu was a peak rank 4 warrior ah!

“Hmph, puny skill!” Sha Qiu sneered and his body flickered as he charged at Lin Xiu like lightning as he continued to slash down!

His saber was covered in dense source strength and every swing of his blade produced vacuum sounds.

Lin Xiu was able to sense the horrifying blade aura that caused cuts on his skin.

‘This blade qi is very strong.’

“You only know how to dodge? So weak!” Sha Qiu sneered as his momentum became even stronger.

Although he looked to be sneering and mocking Lin Xiu, he was inwardly shocked.

‘Even under his ferocious attacks, Lin Xiu was not at a disadvantage although he was defending.’

He was aware of his strength as a peak rank 4 warrior while Lin Xiu was obviously someone who had just stepped into the rank 4 level.

“Wind God’s slash!” Sha Qiu lost patience and activated all of his source strength.

As he unleashed his skill, the air around seemed to stir into a great gale.

A small tornado formed on his saber and enveloped the entire blade.

“Go and die!” He held the saber with both hands and swung down as the tornado gushed forward.

The originally small tornado instantly transformed into a gigantic tornado as it charged towards Lin Xiu!

Sha Qiu’s eyes were smeared with killing intent as he charged forward.

The might of his tornado was enough to mince a rank 3 warrior’s body up. Even for Lin Xiu, a rank 4 warrior, taking the tornado head-on would result in him being severely injured.

So he dodged the attack, but Sha Qiu had prepared another strike behind.

This attack was the true brilliance behind the skill!

But right at this moment, the tornado that was heading towards Lin Xiu seemed to mix with flames. The ordinary tornado suddenly transformed into a fire tornado. The terrifying part was that this fire tornado actually turned back towards Sha Qiu!

‘How is that possible!’

Sha Qiu was at a loss for words when he saw the change.

But he was unable to dodge and his body collided right into the fire tornado!

“AHHH!!!” A scream came out from inside the fire tornado.

“Class monitor!” The students of north campus class 2 were shocked.

They did not expect that Sha Qiu’s most powerful skill would be resolved so easily and instead used back at him!

It was too terrifying.

All the other Sacred Region Academy students were stunned.

They thought there would be a show to watch. They wanted to see Lin Xiu being oppressed but never expected the situation to be reversed.

It was simply too inconceivable.

Bang-

The fire tornado dispersed and revealed Sha Qiu gasping within, his clothes had been charred black.

His head full of hair was completely burnt.

If not for his peak rank 4 source strength that enveloped his entire body, he would have been barbequed. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“So what, still coming?” Lin Xiu raised his right hand out and pointed at him with his spear.

Sha Qiu stared at him with venomous eyes.

‘How did he do it?’

He did not see what Lin Xiu did!

“Damn it, just a trash from the south campus’ Class 10! You dare harm me!!!!” Sha Qiu roared and raised his saber as he charged at Lin Xiu again!

The other north campus’ Class 2 students all had the intent to charge forward as well!

“Move and die.” But a white figure suddenly appeared before them.

In an instant, a cold aura enveloped them and caused them to shiver.

One of them had a sword at his head.

The piercing pain caused him to tremble, as long as Luo Yue exerted a bit of force, the sword would cut through his head!

The three were at a loss, they did not expect Luo Yue to be so fast.

“Red Fire Sand Comet!” Sha Qiu gritted his teeth and unleashed another gold skill.

Flames appeared on his blade as he erupted with source strength!

The temperature of his blade became extremely high to the extent that the atmosphere around the flames seemed to distort.

Sha Qiu’s eyes grew large, he wanted to take Lin Xiu’s life!!!
