Chapter 476: Luo Yue Is Jealous?

The murderous aura from Luo Yue was so strong that Yang Tian could feel it.

“Your girlfriend… is really amazing…” Yang Tian said subconsciously.

“I have contacted the people in Bai Di City. We will leave now and there will be someone over there to pick us up.” At this moment, the Dean of Xing Yao Academy spoke to the pilots.

“Get ready to take off.”

“Yes!” Hearing his words, the pilots nodded suddenly.

At this time, the dean of Xing Yao Academy looked at Lin Xiu, then smiled and said, “Student Lin, do you have any other tasks this time?” Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

During the conversation with Luo Li just now, the dean of Xing Yao Academy had learned that Lin Xiu was recruited into the Sacred Region Academy by Mr. Ye, which even he hadn’t expected.

Others may not know where the Sacred Region Academy was, but he did.

That place was equivalent to the top institution in China!

At this time, he looked at Lin Xiu and his expression changed.

“No task, I just came back to take a look.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

The dean of Xing Yao Academy nodded at this time, hesitated for a moment then said, “Do you want to go to Bai Di City together?”

“With this flood about to rush in, if you don’t go out now, you will be in trouble later.”

The dean sighed when he spoke. The flood rushing in was not a big problem because Xing Yao City has a drainage system after all and would be dealt with soon. The real problem was the zombies and evolved beasts washed over by the flood, there would be more and more of them!

These zombies were already so terrifying, if there were evolved beasts coming as well, then things would be even more troublesome!

“No, let’s take a look first.”

Lin Xiu said aloud at this time.

“By the way, Yang Tian, do you know where Ye Shuang’er’s school is?” Lin Xiu said to Yang Tian.

“Ye Shuang’er!?” Yang Tian was startled, then he smacked his head like he recalled something.

“By the way, your childhood sweetheart, Ye Shuang’er, has been trying to contact you but couldn’t.”

“I have also sent you several messages but you are not on VV anymore.” (Note: VV, a certain social software.)

Lin Xiu was embarrassed at this time, indeed, because after he came to the Sacred Region Academy, things happened one after another and he forgot to log in to this software.

“Okay, stop talking nonsense, which college did she go to?” Ye Shuang’er should have gone to high school, she was not in Xing Yao Academy, she should have gone to another academy.

But there were also several high schools in Xing Yao City, and they were all located on different corners of Xing Yao City.

“It seems to be Beidou Academy.” Yang Tian thought for a while, and then said aloud.

Beidou Academy! ? Isn’t that at the north gate!?

Thinking of the news that he had just read that the evolved beast had broken through the north gate, Lin Xiu’s expression suddenly changed.

“Childhood sweetheart?” Lin Xiu turned around and looked at Luo Yue, only to find that Luo Yue was staring at him as she said indifferently.

“Yes, a beautiful and lovely little sister who has a good relationship with Lin Xiu.” Yang Tian said aloud, wishing for the world to be in chaos.

“Ahem, it’s a neighbor’s little sister who used to live next door.” Lin Xiu glared at Yang Tian, and then said to Luo Yue.

“Oh.” Luo Yue was still expressionless.

“Uh…I don’t know anything about that.” Yang Tian looked at Luo Yue and Lin Xiu and silently stepped back.

“Let’s go.” Luo Yue looked at the distance and then said aloud.

“Where are we going?” Lin Xiu was taken aback when he heard Luo Yue’s words, and then subconsciously said aloud.

“Go and save your little sister.” Luo Yue said solemnly at this time.

Lin Xiu had goosebumps. Although Luo Yue seemed to be making a serious remark, why does it feel a little weird?

Is she jealous? impossible…

“Wait for me!” But seeing that Luo Yue had already gone ahead, Lin Xiu also leaped down at this time, and headed towards the north gate of Xing Yao City!

“Fatty, see you next time!” As Lin Xiu ran to the front, he turned his head and shouted at Yang Tian above.

“Okay!” Yang Tian also nodded at this time.

Seeing that Lin Xiu’s current strength had reached this level, he couldn’t help but feel happy for Lin Xiu.

And there was no estrangement between himself and Lin Xiu, just the same as before.

“Didn’t expect that Lin Xiu has grown to this level. This is really unexpected.” Luo Li looked at Lin Xiu who had left, and couldn’t help but sigh with emotion.

Who would have thought that the bottom-ranking student a few months ago has now reached a level even more terrifying than the dean?

The other instructors of Xing Yao Academy looked at Luo Li, full of envy, jealousy, and hatred.

If only Lin Xiu was in their class previously. After all, if such a powerful warrior was in their class, they would be able to show off.

“Hng, he has grown to at least a rank 6 warrior artist in a few months, he must have a secret.” Director Tang’s face showed a sullen look.

Then he took out his mobile phone and looked at it, but his gaze changed.

“Do you know how to get there?” Lin Xiu and Luo Yue ran side by side on the road in Xing Yao City, and then said aloud to her.

“I’ve been here before.” Luo Yue said lightly.

“You’ve been to Xingyao City?” Lin Xiu said curiously.

“En, I came here once, and memorized the map.” Luo Yue nodded and said.

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but gasp. After coming once, she memorized the map of Xingyao City?

This is too genius…

At this time, Luo Yue seemed to know the streets better than Lin Xiu, a local, as she brought him into those small alleys.

Because the two people were very fast, it didn’t take long for them to reach the north of Xing Yao City.

When the two of them first ran over there, they saw many people screaming in surprise, and ran in the direction where Lin Xiu and Luo Yue came!

“What are you guys doing! Leave, there are zombies and evolved beasts coming!”

A man in a police uniform, holding a laser gun in his hand, looked at Luo Yue and Lin Xiu over there and shouted.

Roar–

As soon as he called out, a huge figure appeared in front of him and let out a huge roar.
