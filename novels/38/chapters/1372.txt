1373 Spear Divine Spirit

The young man roared in rage.

“How dare you kill my men?! I am An Tianlan!”

His eyes that were filled with murderous intentions glared at Lin Xiu.

“An Tianlan? Never heard of it.”

Seeing how he told his name, Lin Xiu shook his head.

For warrior gods like him, it would be a waste of time to even activate the Analytic Eye.

“An? Could it be the son of the master…”

Yuan Zheng seemed to have thought of something and the look on his face changed.

Lin Xiu peered at Xiao Qingchen who was still fighting and asked Yuan Zheng instead, “Is the master of the Royal Beast Sect a powerful man?”

“He is. He’s someone like the God King.”

“But, he’s obviously not better than Tianling God King.”

Yuan Zheng quickly explained it to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and had his eyes on An Tianlan. He was ready to fight this young man.

Boom – –

Then, there was a loud explosion that followed. Xiao Qingchen has managed to send Luo Tian and his evolved beast face into the distance.

When An Tianlan saw what happened, the look on his face turned gloomy.

He thought that these three were just ordinary warriors. He didn’t expect them to be such powerful men.

They were terrifying!

An Tianlan took a deep breath and gathered all of the source energy in his body.

Xiu – –

As An Tianlan controlled it with his mind, the golden spear that was fixed onto his saddle flew into his arms.

He caught onto it quickly.

Following that, his body flew into the air and swung the golden spear at Lin Xiu.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

A crescent shaped sword aura appeared and it was directly headed for Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu gave a cold laugh and his body disappeared into thin air!

Where did he go?!

An Tianlan’s pupil shrank subconsciously when he noticed what happened.

However, right after that, he could feel something from behind him and Lin Xiu was already standing behind him. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

There was a huge fist that was aimed at his body!

Boom – –

Suddenly, An Tianlan’s ride was the one who came rushing from the side.

Lin Xiu frowned and pulled back his fist. His body then instantly disappeared once again.

“Interesting.” Lin Xiu raised his brows when he appeared on the opposite side.

An Tianlan and this evolved beast was obviously much more powerful than the man known as Zhuo Qiu.

“Dirty Tricks!”

An Tianlan’s face turned even gloomier than before.

Lin Xiu’s skills were incredibly peculiar as he could disappear from time to time.

It was as if he was teleporting.

He took a deep breath, moved backwards and there was a golden glow that appeared around his body.

Divine Energy!

Coincidentally, his divine spirit was also a spear.

It was exactly the same as what his weapon was.

“No matter who you are, you are dead today!”

The young man roared and soon, the golden spear released a bright golden glow!

Xiu – –

He quickly shifted his body and appeared right before Lin Xiu. The sharp tip of his spear was about to be driven through Lin Xiu’s body!

Lin Xiu sneered and he never thought of dodging the spear.

Instead, he gathered his energy onto his fist and threw a powerful punch.

The sharp tip of the spear collided with his fist and let out a huge explosion.

“Ahhhhh!!!”

An Tianlan was thrown into the distance due to the impact but he wanted to continue attacking Lin Xiu.

There were hundreds of spears that appeared in the air. However, Lin Xiu was able to quickly stop all of them.

An Tianlan was furious.

...

How was this possible?!

He had already used his divine energy but he still couldn’t beat this brat!

“Heavenly Murder!!!”

At the very next moment, An Tianlan gathered all of the energy left in his body and roared in rage.

He swung his spear once again. A blast of energy was release from his body and it was aimed directly at Lin Xiu!

The air around them looked twisted due to the horrifying warrior skills that An Tianlan had released.

If they were in another area, there would have been a huge opening in the space but this was Warrior God City which was different from the other places.

Boom– –

As the large surge of energy headed towards Lin Xiu, there was a loud explosion.

He expected Lin Xiu to be killed instantly but the next moment, An Tianlan’s eyes opened wide in shock.

But, Lin Xiu was still alive!

...

Not only was he still alive, it looked….. It looked as if he was not injured at all!

Plus, Lin Xiu did not release his ‘sphere’ to protect himself.

“This fella’s physique is quite tough…”

Xiao Qingchen looked at Lin Xiu who was in the air and he was in awe.

He saw it with his own eyes. Lin Xiu has been defending all of the attacks with his own body.

This was incredible.

Xiao Qingchen had already defeated Luo Tian and his evolved beast.

“Don’t worry. The master of the Royal Beast Sect would not be allowed to enter here.”

Xiao Qingchen noticed that Yuan Zheng looked a little worried and slowly reassured him.

Yuan Zheng let out a bitter smile after hearing what Xiao Qingchen said.

Both these men were crazy.

“Your spear and divine spirit aren’t too bad.”

Lin Xiu moved his body and he smiled as he stared at An Tianlan’s spear and divine spirit.

What did he mean?!

After hearing what Lin Xiu’s said, the look in An Tianlan’s eyes changed.

At that moment, he could clearly see that there were black particles that appeared around Lin Xiu’s body.

Then, there was a little black dragon that appeared.

Divine Spirit?!

An Tianlan’s eyes narrowed in shock after seeing what was happening.

This was because he noticed that there were three faint spirit marks on the dragon.

This was a black grade divine spirit!

Xiu – –

Lin Xiu instantly used ‘Flashing Soul’ and appeared in front of An Tianlan.

“Move!”

Seeing how An Tianlan’s evolved beast was about to attack him from behind, Lin Xiu shouted at it.

Along with that, there was another surge of terrifying energy that was released.

The evolved beast was directly hit by the energy.

Then, it fell straight to the ground beneath them.

At the same time, Lin Xiu had swung his fist at An Tianlan!

The opposite party had a spear and it would be difficult for An Tianlan to use it in close combat.

An Tianlan had no other choice but to place the spear in front of his body.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu’s punch landed directly on the spear and there was a loud sound that followed.

He had to take a few steps backwards because of the impact.

Pfft – –

As soon as he steadied his body, he spat out a mouthful of blood.
