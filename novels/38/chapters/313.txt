Chapter 314: Looking for Ice Lotus Fire

“I don’t know what this is either.” Luo Yue shook her head and said.

“I found it nearby.”

“You were also shot down by warriors?” Lin Xiu thought of the warriors just now and a murderous intent burst forth from his eyes.

Luo Yue nodded slightly, her eyes filled with coldness.

“Shall we go up now?” Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue.

Even though there was a strange white light covering his body now, he and Luo Yue had nothing to do at the bottom of the lake.

But if the light suddenly disappeared, then they would be in trouble.

He has learned the power of these weird lakes.

“No.” Luo Yue shook her head, then looked below and continued, “Take that thing first.”

“What thing!?” Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu asked.

“Ice lotus fire.”

The moment Luo Yue spoke, she pulled Lin Xiu with her right hand that was embracing Lin Xiu’s body and the two of them sank below directly.

Lin Xiu wasn’t sure how deep the lake was but he felt his body sinking and after some time, they reached the bottom.

At this moment, using the white light on their bodies, Lin Xiu could clearly see that the rocks below were dark blue rocks, which looked very strange.

“Is this Ice lotus fire really here?” Lin Xiu looked around. Except for these weird blue rocks at the bottom of the lake, nothing weird could be found.

Lin Xiu looked at the bottom, then continued to check and said.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Luo Yue nodded slightly.

Lin Xiu got a little curious; Luo Yue came here just to find this Ice lotus fire?

Their eyes scanned the surroundings, searching for the so-called “Ice Lotus Fire”.

Lin Xiu had been looking around the bottom of the lake for a long time, but still hasn’t found anything special.

“By the way, is that Hua Tian your friend?” Lin Xiu asked casually while looking.

Luo Yue was startled when she heard Lin Xiu’s words, then she seemed to be thinking of something before she answered seriously, “Yeah.”

“A very important friend.”

‘Very important friend?’

‘It can’t be her…’

With that thought, Lin Xiu didn’t know why but he looked slightly uncomfortable.

“Oh.” However, Lin Xiu’s expression did not change much and he responded faintly.

The two people continued to look around. At the next moment, Lin Xiu saw a very faint light in the cracks between the rocks below.

“Luo Yue! Here!” Seeing this, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and the pupils in his eyes constricted.

He held his breath and looked over there.

If his guess was right, the thing that appeared at the bottom of this lake must be Ice lotus fire!

When Luo Yue heard Lin Xiu’s words, she followed Lin Xiu’s gaze and approached that thing.

She stretched out her hand and wanted to touch the thing that shined in the cracks.

“Don’t touch–” Lin Xiu called out instinctively.

Because this thing was probably like the Red lotus fire previously; if you touch it directly, it your arm would probably get burned.

But it was too late. Luo Yue’s hand had already touched that thing directly.

But what worried Lin Xiu did not happen. Instead, these rays of light went directly to Luo Yue’s body because of the contact with Luo Yue’s hand.

Soon, those things surrounding Lin Xiu and Luo Yue began to become brighter and brighter.

It seemed to make this light stronger.

“This…” Seeing this, Lin Xiu’s mouth opened slightly – this is not the Ice lotus fire!?

“These are the lights on our bodies.” Luo Yue explained.

Lin Xiu suddenly realized that when Luo Yue fell into the lake, she probably relied on her powerful source strength to protect her body initially, then found these strange things below.

As all the rays of light were channeled to them, the lights in the cracks were gone.

“This Ice lotus fire… where exactly is it?”

Just as Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were relying on the protection of this white light to continue looking for the Ice lotus fire at the bottom of the lake, Hua Tian was still fighting against the two warriors above the water. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The more they fought, the more shocked those two rank 7 warriors were.

Because they clearly felt that Hua Tian’s strength was simply unfathomable. He was merely a rank 6 warrior but the strength of two rank 7 warriors actually couldn’t kill him directly.

Instead, they were at a disadvantage because of Hua Tian’s attack.

“Who on earth are you!?” The two rank 7 warriors looked at Hua Tian and exclaimed in shock.

Hua Tian disappeared in an instant, then appeared behind them, slashing their battle suits directly and leaving a very deep mark behind them.

“The Dark World.” Hua Tian looked at them and said faintly.

His dark eyes were now filled with murderous intent.

Hearing Hua Tian’s words, not only the two rank 7 warriors, but also the warriors who were watching the battle, had a change in expressions.

The Dark World was also known as the underground world. On this earth, there are many broken and chaotic cities and in those cities, there are some unknown warriors.

These warriors are very skilled and they appear in very dangerous places. They were trained to kill people and evolved beasts since they were young and the skills they use are all skills for killing.

Compared with ordinary warriors, these warriors have very powerful combat capabilities.

“Don’t bluff! Go to hell!!!” When the two warriors saw Hua Tian continue to attack, they held the weapons in their hands and wanted to continue to attack him!

Boom——

But at this moment, the surrounding ground seemed to shake violently.

The warriors almost couldn’t stand firmly.

What’s happening!?

Some people’s expressions changed, then they looked into the lake, only to see that the surface of the originally calm lake seemed to be boiling now – the scene was very spectacular!

Hua Tian’s eyes widened too and he did not continue to look at the two rank 7 warriors. Instead, he jumped directly to the opposite side of the lake near the shore and looked at the state of the lake with his eyes filled with surprise.
