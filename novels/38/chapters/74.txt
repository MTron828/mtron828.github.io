Chapter 75: Unlocking Rank 1 Gene Lock!

His sword moved extremely fast and slashed down at Lin Xiu in the next second!

This round was even more exciting than the previous two, and all the students that had witnessed Tang Tian’s Moving Clouds and Flowing Water cutting the Awe of the Phoenix into half were in an uproar.

Lin Xiu turned pale with fright when he saw the Blood Fiend Sword slashing down at him from close range.

He exerted force from both hands as the spear swiped upwards. He wanted to use Adjudicate to reflect all the power back!

But right at that instant, Tang Tian seemed to have sensed something and immediately withdrew Moving Clouds and Flowing Water’s last strike and unleashed an ordinary strike towards Lin Xiu.

Bang-

After a groan was heard, Lin Xiu’s shoulder had a hole penetrated from the sword.

When Tang Tian saw Lin Xiu’s shocked look, he could not help but reveal a sinister laugh. “Do you think it was an accident? I have completely seen through your skills!”

When he said that, he pulled out his sword from Lin Xiu’s body and slashed at his neck!

“He wants to kill Lin Xiu!” Right at this moment, Luo Li, who was in the stands, smashed the table and stood up.

Although Lin Xiu tried to avoid the last sword strike, he was pierced in the shoulder. Tang Tian chose to attack the same location. Once the artery was cut, a huge blood loss would follow and it might mean the death of Lin Xiu!

“Luo Li, I have to say, why are you so anxious? It’s inevitable to get injured and Lin Xiu hasn’t admitted defeat yet.” Liu Bai glanced at Luo Li from the side and laughed out loud.

He was extremely ecstatic, Tang Tian was bound to win for sure!

“You…” Luo Li fumed, but he saw Lin Xiu dodging the attacks instead of admitting defeat.

Clang clang clang-

As Lin Xiu used his spear to block Tang Tian’s attacks, the sound of the metal collision rang out.

The Silver Immortal Soul spear already had small cracks all around, but under Tang Tian’s Blood Fiend Sword, more cracks appeared!

Lin Xiu was drenched in perspiration; this was the most dangerous battle he had encountered to date.

Tang Tian was filled with killing intent, he was obviously trying to kill him!

“Do you know? I am already a rank 3 warrior!!!” Tang Tian roared out loud and hacked down with his sword once again. Lin Xiu’s spear got slashed into two!

“No way?!”

At this time, everyone all gasped in shock, the battle had become even more exciting. Even the weapon was cut into two?!

Right at this moment, Tang Tian kicked Lin Xiu’s chest and sent him flying!

With a loud bang, Lin Xiu flew to the edge of the stage.

He coughed out blood.

The wound on his shoulder had stained his robe and dyed it red.

“Hahaha, this time, the winner will be me!” Tang Tian laughed out loud and walked towards Lin Xiu with his blood-stained sword.

He wanted to slash Lin Xiu’s body into two!

“Hahaha, I see that Lin Xiu has lost for sure!”

All the lackeys around Tang Ping started to laugh out loud.

Tang Ping nodded his head and revealed a sinister laugh. He was not only a loser, but he was definitely…dead!

“Lin Xiu, quickly admit defeat!” Luo Li had walked down from the stands and shouted towards the stage.

He had seen Tang Tian’s eyes that were filled with killing intent. He was sure that Tang Tian wanted to kill him!

But Lin Xiu did not listen to his words as he glared at Tang Tian.

‘I can’t lose, I can’t admit defeat!’

The “Gene Lock” in his head flashed in his mind, there was only a 50% success rate. ‘If I fail, I might die!’

‘What to do?!’

As he saw Tang Tian approaching, Lin Xiu knew he did not have much time. Right at this time, he entered the system and hit the Gene Lock interface!

Do you want to unlock rank 1 Gene Lock? [Y/N]

(Note: Gene Lock process includes a 10% death, 20% loss of consciousness, 30% unforeseeable situation…)

The notification was the same as before.

Lin Xiu clenched his teeth and chose the [Y]! Right at this instant, he felt a jolt in his body as an immense pain spread throughout his entire body.

It felt as though every vessel, vein, and artery in his body were ripping apart!

Lin Xiu had never felt such pain before, it felt as though a knife was stabbing right at his heart and he was dying.

He could not move at all! He did not even have the strength to scream.

Gene lock, this was the most mysterious origin of power of the legends!

In theory, if an ordinary human activated Gene Lock, he might gain the strength to carry an automobile!

It was as what was shown in the news, some people might erupt with inconceivable strength from a great external stimulation.

As long as Gene Lock was successful, Lin Xiu believed that his strength would increase substantially!

“Go and die!” Tang Tian looked at Lin Xiu and roared out loud as he raised his sword to slash downwards!

“Hold your hand! Are you trying to kill somebody!” The referee roared out loud and Tang Tian felt his body jolt. Right at this time, he subconsciously held his sword back and laughed. “How dare I?”

Although he was smiling, his heart fell. His sword would have killed Lin Xiu, but why did he have a weird feeling that made his body unable to move forward?

“But he hasn’t admitted defeat, right?” Without thinking, Tang Tian continued to speak. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He then stabbed the sword to the side and walked towards Lin Xiu.

He sneered inwardly as he looked at Lin Xiu who was at a loss for words.

Did he become dumb from shock?

He pulled onto Lin Xiu’s robes and carried him up, then punched Lin Xiu in his chest!

Lin Xiu coughed out more blood!

Many people covered their eyes at this scene. Lin Xiu’s entire body was covered with blood and he looked extremely terrible.
