Chapter 199: Luo Yue’s Advancement In Rank

Roar-

The Mutated red-eyed dogs realized that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were rushing at them and howled.

The sight of the pieces of flesh from the corpses they had just eaten stuck in between their teeth was extremely gruesome. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

They charged towards Lin Xiu and Luo Yue without waiting for them to come over.

They were rank 5 evolved beasts with extremely fast speed!

They did not even leave shadows inside the mist!

Bang-

Lin Xiu took the first strike and stabbed at a mutated red-eyed dog without hesitation!

But the red-eyed dog actually avoided his attack surprisingly.

This shocked Lin Xiu, he was already extremely fast but the mutated red-eyed dog was actually even faster.

And as it avoided Lin Xiu’s attack, it actually pounced straight at his neck!

‘What a ferocious mutt!’

Lin Xiu’s aze changed and he took a step back.

As he retreated, another mutated red-eyed dog from behind pounced at him!

“Scram!!!” Lin Xiu panicked and unleashed Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall!

Rumble-

This struck the mutated red-eyed dog that was sent flying. The impact even created a hole in the wall.

“Careful!” Luo Yue called out and slashed in front of Lin Xiu.

Bang-

A mutated red-eyed dog that took the opportunity to sneak an attack on Lin Xiu was cleaved into two.

Blood sprayed everywhere.

Roar-

Although one of the mutated red-eyed dogs was killed, the others had fear and any signs of retreat. They continued to charge at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

They did not care or could not care. They simply looked crazy.

“Die for me!!!” Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted as he predicted one of the rank 5 mutated red-eyed dog’s movements and thrust Dark Edge at it!

Bang-

Specks of flames suddenly appeared at the spear tip.

Bang-

As Lin Xiu had anticipated, his spear struck one of the rank 5 mutated red-eyed dog just as it was about to pounce.

The spear stabbed right into its large opened mouth and along with the terrifying flames, the dog’s body instantly swelled up.

And blew up into pieces.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing rank 5 mutated red-eyed dog, awarded with 1 million experience points!”

‘Only a million!?’

The corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched, one million experience points was simply inefficient to him.

Luo Yue also got rid of another mutated red-eyed dog at this time.

It was not difficult for Luo Yue to kill them.

Gu-

Right at this time, the mutated red-eyed dogs all released a howl.

They retreated not long later and their figures were hidden by the dense mist.

They disappeared in an instant.

Lin Xiu frowned, it was difficult for them to pinpoint their locations once they were hidden.

After all, it was too terrifying inside the mist as their visibility was impacted.

“You’re a rank 5 warrior now?” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue and asked in surprise.

He realized that Luo Yue’s movements were far stronger than before and she was much faster in killing the rank 5 mutated red-eyed dogs.

When he looked at her, he realized that she had been promoted to rank 5.

“I broke through inside the space crack.” Luo Yue nodded and replied indifferently.

But Lin Xiu’s eyes suddenly enlarged, as he felt that burning pain in his entire body.

‘What’s going on?’

Bang-

He could not hold his spear steadily and quickly sat down as he gasped.

He was out of energy, as though all of it had been converted to heat energy.

Luo Yue walked over when she noticed the abnormality and squatted next to him. She extended her hand and grabbed his wrist.

His wrist was extremely hot and his pulse was fast.

Lin Xiu immediately imbued her cold source strength into his body without hesitation.

The immense heat in his body quickly became less painful.

“What’s going on?” Lin Xiu asked curiously.

He had clearly absorbed all the Red Lotus Fire energy, why would he still heat up?

Luo Yue seemed to read his thoughts as she explained indifferently, “Although you’ve refined the Red Lotus Fire, your body isn’t capable of enduring it when you use it.”

Incapable of enduring it?

Lin Xiu was enlightened, so my body will be affected when using the Red Lotus Fire?

“Once your body has completely adapted to using the Red Lotus Fire, it shouldn’t occur again.” Luo Yue explained.

Lin Xiu nodded his head and heaved a sigh of relief as he stood back up.

The mist was still around and they did not know when it would dissipate.

“I heard from the others that this mist was formed by an evolved beast.” Lin Xiu suddenly said as the two cautious moved ahead.

“An evolved beast formed this mist?” Luo Yue revealed a hint of surprise when she heard his words.

How powerful would the evolved beast be if it was the culprit capable of producing a mist that could shroud the entire G17 ruin?

A rank 9 evolved beast?

Luo Yue frowned upon thinking of this.

“I heard it from the Moon Wings Corp people, I’m not sure if it’s true or false.” Lin Xiu was also skeptical.

‘It should not be possible. If such a powerful evolved beast exists, we’re all done for.’

At the same time, on the other side.

“Damn it, that brat and that girl will be dead the next time we meet!!!” Cheng Fan thought to himself as he ran into their secret base with a pale face.

Upon entering, he applied the medication to his broken arm.

While pouring the medicinal liquid over his wound, it produced a lot of white smoke.

The immense pain caused him to open his eyes wide as he clenched his teeth.
