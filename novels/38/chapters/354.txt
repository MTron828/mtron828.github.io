Chapter 355: Powerful Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist

Lin Xiu looked ahead at this moment and rushed directly to the front.

“Damn it! How could this woman be so strong?!” Luo Yue dodged the attack of a warrior again and he had a look of surprise.

Under the attack of seven or eight warriors, Luo Yue didn’t even seem to be struggling.

Just when he wanted to continue attacking Luo Yue, he heard a ‘crackling’ sound.

What sound is that!?

Hearing this weird sound at this time, he turned around instinctively and saw Lin Xiu rushing over from behind!

Lin Xiu’s right fist was raised high at this moment, the fist in his hand was covered in a lot of electric light and he slammed it directly towards the man.

“Get lost!!!”

When the man saw this scene, he let out a loud roar at this moment then the saber in his hand swung directly at Lin Xiu’s fist!

Bang——

When his saber hit Lin Xiu’s fist, it let out a deafening noise.

This man’s sharp saber didn’t cut Lin Xiu’s fist in half, but because of the huge impact of Lin Xiu’s punch, his saber flew out of his hand directly!

And his hand even had a faint tingling feeling at this time.

What exactly is going on? Why is this guy so powerful!!!

Before the man had time to react, Lin Xiu rushed forward at this instant!

He continued swinging his fists and smashing them on his body!

At this moment, the man didn’t dare to attack Lin Xiu anymore, a trace of fear appeared in his eyes.

His body instinctively dodged the attacks.

Bang bang bang——

Lin Xiu’s fists kept waving and punching.

Although the man reacted quickly and constantly dodged, Lin Xi’s movements were simply too fast. In the next moment, his fist hit the man who wanted to dodge.

Bang–

With a loud explosive sound, the body of this warrior was instantly covered by a large amount of electric light and the whole body flew out.

His body, which had been flooded with electric light, hit the ground in front of him.

At this time, his body was twitching and white foam was spitting out from his mouth.

The rest of the warriors who were attacking Luo Yue had clearly noticed this situation at this time and they were shocked.

Lin Xiu actually brought down the two warriors in their team by himself!?

This was simply unbelievable to them because they thought that just one of their warriors could easily deal with Lin Xiu.

“Kill them.” At this time, Luo Yue looked at the warriors who attacked her then said lightly.

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed.

Since these people wants to kill him and Luo Yue, he couldn’t play nice anymore.

With this thought, Lin Xiu’s body tensed up and clenched his fists that were still carrying a lot of electric light.

Now Lin Xiu was now very familiar with ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’, so it was very easy to use.

However, these electric lights still have to consume a lot of source strength in the body before they can be transformed.

“Go and kill that kid!” A warrior shouted with a sinister face.

Seeing a large amount of electric light on Lin Xiu’s fists, he sensed a strong and dangerous aura from Lin Xiu.

As he yelled, three of the warriors who were still surrounding Luo Yue gave up attacking her and went straight to Lin Xiu instead!

Lin Xiu saw this and did not dodge but faced the attack head-on!

Earlier, Lin Xiu was wearing the ‘Red Moon’ glove that he won from the previous lottery.

With the protection from the gloves, Lin Xiu didn’t have to dodge these attacking warriors at all. now watching the weapons held by these men slam his body, Lin Xiu doesn’t need to dodge at all and hit their weapons with his fists!

Dang–

The long sword in the warrior’s hand collided with Lin Xiu’s fist and let out a clear sound.

When he was still stunned that he hadn’t directly penetrated Lin Xiu’s fist, he realized that the electric light on Lin Xiu’s fist had spread to his body through his long sword!

“Ah!!!”

The voltage of the electric light was very high, which made this warrior who has not been in electric shock resistance training at all feel like death was better.

His whole body was also paralyzed at this moment and he was unable to move.

Lin Xiu didn’t stop and seized this opportunity as he threw a punch on the warrior’s body!

His fist smashed his body directly!

Even though he was wearing a battle suit, the powerful force generated by Lin Xiu’s fist was directly transmitted into the body of this warrior.

Click, click, click——

The damage caused by the ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’ starts internally. Now, because of Lin Xiu’s punch, many bones on his body were shattered!

As he vomited a mouthful of blood, his whole body smashed against the wine table on the other side and he fainted instantly.

And on the other side, Luo Yue was constantly waving her dagger and the warrior suddenly felt a sharp pain in his arm.

A lot of blood sputtered out in an instant!

His eyes widened suddenly and he discovered that his arm got sliced off by Luo Yue’s dagger!

“What!!!”

At this moment, severe pain began to come over him and he couldn’t help but let out a loud wail.

But Luo Yue didn’t stop the movement in her hand, she appeared in front of him swiftly and her dagger flashed like a cold light and was about to chop his head off.

Dang–

But at this critical moment, a long sword pierced from the side, stopping Luo Yue’s dagger.

“Courting death!” The man who used his long sword to block Luo Yue’s dagger was startled and angry when he saw his companion’s cleaved arm.

And at this moment, another warrior pierced Luo Yue’s body from behind with his long sword!
