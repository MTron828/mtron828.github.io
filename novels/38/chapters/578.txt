“Are you all right?” Qu Tingting came over at this time and said to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu shook his head.

At this moment, Xiao Bai and Rollie ran out of the silver box not far away and flew to Lin Xiu’s side.

They looked at the people around with a cautious gaze, especially Xiaobai, an ice crystal little white bird, who seemed to be showing its teeth and claws, like an angry bird.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help showing a smile when he saw that they seemed to be protecting his injured self.

“What is this...” Qu Tingting was taken aback, then stepped back subconsciously.

But after a closer look, she realized that this little bird and the white furry ball was very cute.

“So cute.” Qu Tingting said with bright eyes after seeing their figures clearly.

However, Xiaobai’s frizzy appearance made Qu Tingting not dare to approach.

“Are these the evolved beasts you raised?”

Qu Tingting said curiously.

“En, but they are afraid of life.” Lin Xiu said with a smile without explaining anything.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Qu Tingting nodded.

She also knew that evolved beasts were generally impossible to tame. Lin Xiu was able to tame these two, it must have been very difficult.

However, these two evolved beasts were small and they were so cute that Qu Tingting’s heart was about to melt.

“If there is nothing else, I will cultivate first.” Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

The punch he just used against the leader caused a lot of damage on Lin Xiu’s body.

Originally, if he had kept the ‘Sphere’ defense, he wouldn’t have suffered too much damage, but when he finally saw the fist he swung over, Lin Xiu had a sudden burst of fighting spirit, then he also threw a punch.

But the power of that punch was really terrifying and now Lin Xiu felt like his arm bones were cracked.

And his internal organs also felt a little aching.

“Well, I won’t disturb you then.” Qu Tingting knew that Lin Xiu was injured and now it looks like he was going to heal, so she didn’t plan to disturb Lin Xiu at this time.

“Oh right.” Just as Qu Tingting was about to leave, she seemed to think of something and the expression on her face became serious.

“What’s wrong?”

Lin Xiu said subconsciously.

Although the people from the execution team wouldn’t bother you anymore, but you killed Murong after all. I believe it won’t be long before other people will know about it.” RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“So what.” Lin Xiu said indifferently.

“The people of the Murong family are notorious for revenge. I guess they will come to trouble you.” Qu Tingting hesitated for a while, but said aloud.

“There’s always a solution; the people of their family couldn’t possibly come over to the academy, right?” Lin Xiu said indifferently, spreading his hands.

Seeing that Lin Xiu was still indifferent, Qu Tingting couldn’t help but pouted.

“You’d better be careful.”

“Well, thank you Senior for your concern.” Lin Xiu said with a smile.

After Qu Tingting left, Lin Xiu’s face also became serious.

It’s not that Lin Xiu didn’t think about what Qu Tingting said just now. He also heard about the Murong family. It was said that they were a very powerful family, but Lin Xiu couldn’t care that much anymore. Murong wanted him dead so he should suffer the consequences.

Lin Xiu didn’t think much about it. At this moment, he sat down with his legs crossed, then took out the rank 8 odd crystal that had not been absorbed before.

With the simultaneous operation of the ‘Cultivation Technique’ and ‘Engulf’ skills, the energy in the rank 8 odd crystal was being absorbed by Lin Xiu frantically.

The energy poured into Lin Xiu’s body and was absorbed by Lin Xiu’s body and the cells in the body became very active.

Those internal injuries were quickly healing.

Once he fell into the state of cultivation, Lin Xiu didn’t seem to feel the passage of time.

And Xiaobai and Rollie were also standing on Lin Xiu’s body, as if they were protecting Lin Xiu.

After some time, when Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, he found that the sky was already bright.

The whole body felt very comfortable.

Compared with yesterday, he felt much more comfortable and the injuries on his body seem to have completely healed.

He glanced around. Many of the warriors here were currently in the cultivation state. Some people walked over to the other side and seemed to be receiving nourishment liquid from the staff there.

Lin Xiu knew this, there was an area here where you could get nourishment liquid for free.

After all, people who challenge the Tower of Trials would stay here and they wouldn’t leave until they couldn’t continue the challenge, or they ran out of challenge cards.

After all, if you leave this place and come in again, you would also need a challenge card.

Lin Xiu walked over there and received a nourishment liquid for free.

Some warriors looked at Lin Xiu’s figure and subconsciously stayed away from Lin Xiu. After all, many people watched the battle between Lin Xiu and the leader of the execution team the day before.

Moreover, Lin Xiu also killed Murong. In their eyes, Lin Xiu has become a dangerous person.

Lin Xiu ignored these warriors and directly took a bottle of nourishment liquid and drank it.

As he drank, Lin Xiu felt a burst of relief all over his body.

A bottle of this kind of nourishment liquid was enough to supplement the energy consumption of a day.

Looking around, Qu Tingting did not appear.

As for Qu Tingting, Lin Xiu didn’t harbor any intention, she was just an ordinary senior.

After drinking, Lin Xiu walked over to the gate of the Tower of Trial and entered the system interface.

Taking a closer look, in his experience column, he already had nearly 20 billion experience!

It was obvious that most of the experience was obtained by absorbing this rank 8 odd crystal.

However, compared to the 100 billion experience gained by killing the rank 8 warrior before, the experience gained now was still too little.

The current level was level 37. If he wanted to upgrade to level 38, he needed 130 billion experience.

In other words, there was still more than 100 billion experience to go.

Actually, it wasn’t much but it wasn’t little too.

Because as long as he killed a rank 8 warrior, Lin Xiu could directly level up, but if he gained experience by killing those evolved beasts before, he would probably take a very long time.

Lin Xiu looked at the moon-shaped jade pendant around his neck and squeezed his hands tightly.

Sky City, Luo Yue, wait for me!

Lin Xiu’s eyes showed an incomparably determined look, then he continued to step into the Tower of Trials!

Today, he is going to go straight to the upper floor!
