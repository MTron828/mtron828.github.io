Chapter 262: Killing Zhou Wenhao (1)

Lin Xiu felt immense pain all over his body. The use of ‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’ had consumed the majority of the source strength in him.

It was fortunate that Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City had blocked Total Annihilation, otherwise, his body might have been destroyed from the powerful sword qi.

Lin Xiu used Dark Edge to support himself and stabilize his body.

He was at an extreme disadvantage if they continued to fight. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

The dust slowly scattered.

A figure appeared from within.

‘Is he dead!?’

Upon seeing the figure, Lin Xiu’s expression changed.

“Hahaha, you really think that can kill me!” A roar came out.

At this time after the dust had dissipated, Lin Xiu, Guo Ling, and the others were able to see Zhou Wenhao inside!

He looked to be tired and injured as though he had been through a difficult situation.

He stared at Lin Xiu with killing intent in his eyes.

His face had many wounds that dripped blood down his cheeks.

His eyes were also filled with shock. He did not expect Lin Xiu’s skill to force him to this state.

Lin Xiu stared straight back at him and held onto Dark Edge tightly.

‘I can’t even beat him down now, what do I do?’

Lin Xiu frowned.

Fury was about to end and if he failed to beat him down before the aftereffect kicked in, Lin Xiu would definitely be killed!

“Quick, kill him!!!!” Guo Ling’s eyes changed expression as she screamed.

Although Zhou Wenhao did not die, Lin Xiu’s Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City was obviously stronger than Zhou Wenhao’s skill.

Zhou Wenhao was severely injured.

It was the best time to hit him down, otherwise, it would be more troublesome once he recovered!

Qiu Li and the others were aware of this. Upon hearing the command, they held their weapons and charged towards Zhou Wenhao!

Zhou Wenhao’s gaze turned cold as he looked at Qiu Li and the others charging at him.

But he did not retaliate against Qiu Li and the others but went straight for Lin Xiu!

Qiu Li and co. did not pose a threat to him, while Lin Xiu had become a target in his eyes!

He felt that he would be in a dangerous position if he did not kill Lin Xiu right away.

It was his first time in his life to come across a rank 5 warrior that made him feel as though he was in danger.

Sou-

Zhou Wenhao moved extremely quickly, causing the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes to change.

He thought to dodge backward but felt a pain in his neck.

Warm blood spurted out.

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted.

A cut had appeared on his neck.

Fast, Zhou Wenhao was too fast.

His neck was so close to being completely sliced through by Zhou Wenhao’s gigantic sword!

Zhou Wenhao did not stop and swung the gigantic sword upwards.

The gigantic sword came down extremely quickly and Lin Xiu was still unable to react even under Fury.

The sword tip found Lin Xiu’s robes and caused a ‘shua’ sound.

“I am now using 100% of my strength to fight against you. You should feel proud, brat!” Zhou Wenhao roared as he held the sword with both hands.

The speed of his swings became even faster and even more terrifying.

The surroundings started to become extremely windy with every swing of his sword.

Clank-

Lin Xiu tensed up as his reaction speed reached its peak.

He thrust Dark Edge out but was repelled by the gigantic sword and produced a loud and sonorous sound.

Lin Xiu held Dark Edge tightly with both hands and felt numbness in them from the impact.

The sword qi of the gigantic sword actually transmitted through the spear to him!

The sharp sword qi instantly lacerated his fingers.

Lin Xiu immediately felt immense pain from his fingers.

Clank-

Zhou Wenhao did not stop his momentum and swung the sword at Lin Xiu again!

This time, Dark Edge was flung away due to the pain in his fingers.

“Go and die!”

Zhou Wenhao’s eyes grew large at this moment as he raised his sword with both hands, as though gathering his strength to hack Lin Xiu into half!

In that moment of peril, Qiu Li and the others rushed to Zhou Wenhao’s side!

They used their weapons at Zhou Wenhao.

And their target was his head.

If they were able to land their weapons on his head that was not protected by anything, they could kill him!

“Scram!” Zhou Wenhao’s pupils constricted when he saw them and sent source strength outwards.

He activated Sphere that protected his entire body.

Bang bang bang-

The collision between their weapons and his sphere produced loud sounds.

“Go and die!” Zhou Wenhao swung his sword at them after blocking them with Sphere!

Clank clank clank-

The same scene happened to them as their hands immediately felt pain and their weapons were flung away!

Just as Zhou Wenhao was about to swing his weapon, he instinctively felt something flying towards him from behind!

He turned and felt something land on his eye.

In an instant, he was blind!

“Damn it!!!!” Zhou Wenhao screamed from the sudden loss of vision and extended his hand to grab the thing from his face.

Crackle crackle-

But terrifying electric crackles suddenly appeared in his ears.
