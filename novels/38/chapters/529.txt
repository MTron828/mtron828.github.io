Chapter 530: Hijacking!

“Do it!” Bai Fei roared suddenly when he saw this scene.

The warrior on Bai Fei’s side passed by at this moment. When Luo Yue held the long sword in her hand and wanted to attack, she found that another long sword was sitting on her neck!

Those powders were just a blindfold. The key was that the smell emitted by those powders – it was poisonous!

At this time, it was not only Luo Yue who smelled those odors, but also those warriors from the Royal Beast Sect around Luo Yue.

Their eyes changed, their bodies remained the same, and the unfolded ‘Sphere’ disappeared instantly.

In the next moment, Jiang Tao and the others rushed up and killed all those warriors who suddenly lost the protection of the ‘Sphere’!

Those rank 5 warriors were also stunned. They did not expect that they would kill several rank 6 warriors!

“Stop or I’ll kill her!”

At this moment, Bai Fei and another warrior stood beside Luo Yue, each holding a long sword at Luo Yue’s neck.

Now Luo Yue felt that her strength was slowly recovering, but the long swords held by the two people were on her neck and she couldn’t move.

“Stop!” Jiang Tao said with a wave of his hand as he watched this scene.

Although those warriors surrounded Bai Fei and the others, they didn’t do anything anymore.

“‘Lost Soul Dispersion’?” Although Luo Yue was held at the neck by the long swords, she didn’t seem to be afraid at all.

Seeing her calm look, Jiang Tao was surprised.

“Tsk tsk, the effect is similar to that thing. It is developed from the ingredients extracted from a special flower in a different dimension. There are only a few bottles in this world. You have the honor.” Bai Fei said at this time.

“It seems that you have even attacked your own people.” Jiang Tao heard Bai Fei’s words and understood what had just happened.

No wonder they were able to so easily get rid of those rank 6 warriors. It turned out that those warriors might have been weakened by some special medicine, so they could hack them to death.

“Humph!” Bai Fei snorted coldly, ignoring Jiang Tao’s sarcasm. For him, it was only important that he survived.

“Let go of her!”

Lin Xiu had just burst out a powerful force, and just after he had eliminated the rank 6 warriors, he saw Luo Yue over there being held hostage.

“Kill them.” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and said lightly.

“Shut up!” Bai Fei roared loudly at this moment, and he had chills down his spine just looking at Luo Yue.

Why is this woman not afraid at all? He has never seen such a person before.

But Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue at this time, and did not speak, but walked forward step by step.

“If you come any closer, don’t blame my subordinates for being rude!” Bai Fei’s face showed a ferocious look and the long sword in his hand exerted a little force, the sharp blade was pressed on Luo Yue’s neck and some blood flowed out.

“Let her go.” Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu felt extremely distressed in his heart, but there was no expression on his face as he stood there and said coldly to Bai Fei.

At this time, Bai Fei also saw that Lin Xiu cared about Luo Yue. He knew that he was right to hold Luo Yue hostage.

“Come here, let him stab you and I’ll let her go.” Bai Fei showed a hideous smile on his cheek, and then said to Lin Xiu.

The eyes of Jiang Tao and the others changed. If this stab was stabbed in the chest, it would be deadly.

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu at this time, and the look in her eyes was obviously telling Lin Xiu to ignore her and kill Bai Fei and the other rank 6 warrior.

“Sure.” Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

“Brother Lin!” Jiang Tao couldn’t help calling out when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

After all, Lin Xiu saved their lives just now and gave them the Dark Spirit Fruit. Jiang Tao didn’t want to see Lin Xiu die like this.

“Don’t worry, our Royal Beast Sect people will kill you guys too.” Bai Fei glanced at Jiang Tao and the others, and then laughed proudly.

As soon as he finished speaking, Bai Fei gave the man beside him a wink.

The man nodded, then removed the long sword in his hand from Luo Yue’s neck.

At this time, although Bai Fei was alone, Luo Yue’s strength had not fully recovered. As long as Luo Yue moved, the long sword on her neck would directly chop her neck down.

“One stab, right?” Lin Xiu said lightly.

“That’s right, don’t use the Sphere, just take his stab.” Bai Fei said coldly at this time.

“Okay, come on.” Lin Xiu glanced at the man who came over, and said lightly.

“Tsk tsk, how affectionate and righteous.” Bai Fei said with a grim smile on his cheeks.

Lin Xiu killed the evolved beasts of their Royal Beast Sect, as well as those warriors, which really made Bai Fei hate him.

The man looked at Lin Xiu standing in front, and the Dark Edge spear in his hand was also on the ground, as if he had given up his defense.

Looking at this scene, the expression in his eyes changed, and then in the next moment, holding a long sword, he stabbed Lin Xiu on the body!

Jiang Tao watched this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly, but Lin Xiu still stood on the spot, and didn’t seem to dodge in the slightest.

Boom–

The long sword that the warrior was going to stab directly at Lin Xiu. When it was about to touch Lin Xiu’s body, it became a slash and slashed down at Lin Xiu’s neck as it chopped Lin Xiu’s head off!

If it was just a stab, the possibility of directly stabbing Lin Xiu to death was not 100%, but if his head was chopped off, he is dead!

“Hahaha! What a fool!!!”

At this moment, Bai Fei suddenly burst into laughter. With this, Lin Xiu was no longer a threat at all!

Luo Yue’s current strength has not fully recovered, and at most it could only recover to the level of a rank 5 warrior. For her, this was not a problem.

Boom– 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

But just when he was laughing proudly, he found that a lot of blood spattered on his cheeks, and when he looked down, he realized that his arm had been cut off at some point!

The hand holding the long sword also fell to the ground!

“Ah!!!”

Bai Fei wailed and found himself kicked out!

“No!” The man who had just chopped off Lin Xiu’s head also clearly noticed something was wrong.

As he heard the scream of Bai Fei, he realized that Lin Xiu, whose head had been chopped off in front of him, was gone!

And the real Lin Xiu actually appeared behind!
