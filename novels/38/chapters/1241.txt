1242 The Little Black Dragon That Doesn’t Stop Engulfing.

As Baili Haoling thrusted her daggers forward to the soldiers who were formed by the dark energy, she realised that her daggers were headed back to her!

All of the bodies of these soldiers were formed by the dark energy. Although they were merely energy, when her dagger got into contact with it, it felt as if they were made of high elastic rubber.

Pfft – –

Before Baili Haoling could do anything, all of the dark energy turned into the form of a dagger and it was headed toward her!

As the daggers travelled in the air, there were ear-piercing sounds that could be heard all around them.

There seems to be waves in the space around them.

Baili Haoling had no other choice but to continuously dodge the daggers.

With these three huge soldiers that were made of dark energy protecting him, it would be impossible for her to attack.

“Hahahaha….with those weak energies of yours, you will never be able to kill me!”

Sha Qiong stared at Baili Haoling and Lin Xiu as he started laughing out loud.

After absorbing all the energy from the warriors, the dark energy that he had now was incredibly strong. It was undefeatable!

Although he couldn’t kill Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling directly, they would still be the ones who would die if this goes on!

Boom – –

Just as he was laughing, there was a bright ray that appeared before his eyes.

What was this?!

His smile froze and his pupil shrunk.

Then, he subconsciously covered his head with both his arms.

Although there was a large amount of dark energy around his arms, he could still feel a sharp pain.

The impact of this sudden surge of energy forced him to take a few steps backwards.

What was going on?!

He was shocked as he turned around and noticed that on the huge energy barrier that he had, there was a hole!

Lin Xiu had walked towards the hole and had pierced his arm with a long spear.

After taking a closer look, there was a bright white glow that appeared on the tip of the spear. There were also streaks of dark energy on the spear.

Usually, if he used the dark energy to defend himself, it would be difficult for the other warriors to penetrate through it.

However, there was dark energy found on the tip of the spear as well. This was why the defence on both his arms were not as strong as before.

Plus, what was more shocking now was that there was a black dragon near the hole found on the energy barrier that he had built with the dark energy. It was eating up the energy barrier!

It was doing it at a very fast speed as if it was eating a huge biscuit!

Before Sha Qiong could react, Lin Xiu raised his long spear and thrusted it forward once again.

Xiu – –

This time, he reacted fast enough and shifted to another side.

“This is your divine spirit?!”

Sha Qiong asked in a cold tone after appearing at another corner of the space.

He thought that the dragon was one of Lin Xiu’s warrior skills but after so long and from the details of it, it may be possible that this was an animal spirit.

As for the young girl, she had a weapon spirit.

Both of them had spirits!

The murderous intention in his eyes grew.

Divine spirits are something difficult to comprehend. There were lots of warrior gods who would try but they would fail to get their own spirits.

Even Sha Qiong didn’t have one himself.

If they didn’t get rid of Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling now, it would be a big threat to him.

“You talk a lot of nonsense.”

Lin Xiu sneered. By using ‘Flashing Souls’, he managed to appear right in front of Sha Qiong once again.

The long spear was still being spun in the air and it looked like it was a part of Lin Xiu’s body.

The wounds that were caused by the weapons on his back have already started to heal.

When Lin Xiu broke the weapons with the ‘Profound Intent – Heaven Breaking Strike’, the little black dragon had also absorbed all of the dark energy that was attached onto the weapons.

It was now impossible for them to rebuild the weapons.

The wounds on his back were huge but as the dark energy on them was slowly absorbed by Lin Xiu, they started healing at an incredible speed.

Afterall, Lin Xiu’s body has very strong healing powers.

“I was careless earlier. Did you really think that you would be able to hurt me?!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was still trying to attack him, Sha Qiong was infuriated.

He gathered a large amount of dark energy from his body and then formed a large number of tentacles that were aimed at Lin Xiu.

It looked as if it was trying to penetrate through Lin Xiu’s body and wanted to tie him up.

However, Lin Xiu was too agile and it was impossible for those tentacles to be in contact with Lin Xiu’s body.

At the same time, Lin Xiu continued driving his long spear into Sha Qiong’s body.

Although there was a thick layer of dark energy around his body as defence, Lin Xiu had an energy stone that contained dark energy and this gave Lin Xiu a certain amount of dark energy.

...

Then, Lin Xiu transferred all of it to the tip of his long spear.

Perhaps it was because of the dark energy, Lin Xiu noticed that the tip of his spear that was covered with dark energy would be able to penetrate through the dark energy that Sha Qiong has released.

Although it wasn’t completely through, it still caused a huge damage to Sha Qiong.

Damn it!!!!!!

Sha Qiong had a vicious look on his face.

He continued releasing the dark energy that he had in his body. The entire ground now was covered with pitch-black dark energy.

It caused Lin Xiu to feel as if he was swimming inside a black river.

Wait! Something’s not right!

Lin Xiu looked at the energy that was overflowing on the ground and the look in his eyes changed.

He quickly moved and flew into the air.

“You’re dead!!!!”

...

Sha Qiong showed a horrendous smile on her face.

With one loud roar, the ground that was like a river of dark energy had hundreds of tentacles that appeared out of nowhere. All of them were going after Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu wanted to hide but at some point, there were already a few tentacles from behind that caught his body. It was impossible for him to move now!

All of these tentacles that appeared from the ground came with sharp, pointy tips. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

Plus, there was dark energy around it and was penetrative. It was different from those that were made by other elements.

Thousands of them appeared in the air! There was no way for him to run!

“Gone…”

Lei Chong was still in the air as he witnessed this.

Lin Xiu could definitely be killed from this!

He wanted to close his eyes so that he didn’t have to see such a cruel scene.

However, there was a bright golden light that appeared all over Lin Xiu’s body!
