Chapter 918: Sage Warrior Inheritance?

When Hu Ling heard the words of the surrounding warriors, she fell silent.

The powerful laser rays that just hit.

They made her a little bit fearful.

“I’ll try.”

Lin Xiu walked over at this time and said lightly.

The eyes of the people all looked toward Lin Xiu.

When Hu Ling was about to say something, Lin Xiu had already walked over.

Whoosh whoosh—

At this moment, a large number of laser rays shot directly from the bottom!

Lin Xiu’s body was instantly hit by those terrifying laser rays!

But what was shocking was that those laser rays seemed to have no way to penetrate Lin Xiu’s body at all.

Lin Xiu, who was standing there, took down the sword as if it was nothing.

“En, a little heavy?”

Holding the sword and waving it, Lin Xiu said lightly.

“For you.”

In the next moment, Lin Xiu threw the sword directly toward Hu Ling.

At this time, Hu Ling subconsciously held the sword.

Looking ahead, Lin Xiu ignored the impact of those laser rays and continued to search for something.

Taking a closer look, there was a layer of dark blue energy on Lin Xiu’s body, which surrounded and protected Lin Xiu’s entire body.

No wonder!

He released source strength to protect his body.

Actually, it’s the same principle as ‘Sphere’, but Lin Xiu narrowed down the area.

If one didn’t look carefully, one would have thought he didn’t unfold the ‘Sphere’ at all.

What a terrifying power.

clack clack——

At this time, Lin Xiu looked at the so-called Sage warrior sculpture and seemed to have discovered something.

crackling-

The fist of his right hand was clenched and a terrifying electric light burst out from Lin Xiu’s hand.

“What are you doing?”

Hu Ling seemed to be aware of Lin Xiu’s actions, but at this moment, she was startled and she said subconsciously.

Boom—

As soon as she finished speaking, Lin Xiu directly bombarded the statue of Sage warrior with a fist!

With a loud sound, the statue of the Sage warrior was directly smashed to pieces!

And at this moment, as the statue shattered, a large amount of white light seemed to be released inside.

In the next moment, all these white light clusters rushed towards Lin Xiu’s body.

Comfortable!

From the very beginning, Lin Xiu felt that the statue had extremely strong energy fluctuations.

Sure enough, he was right.

For some unknown reason, there were so many energy groups in these statues.

As soon as these energy groups were absorbed, Lin Xiu felt warm, even a little hot, all over his body.

The total experience bar has risen by about 2%!

“You absorbed the inheritance of the Sage warrior?”

Several warriors looked at the cluster of light just now, thinking that this was the inheritance power left by the Sage warrior.

Their eyes were full of jealousy.

If they had known, they would have smashed the statue first.

Lin Xiu glanced at them, but didn’t say anything.

“Hey, explain yourself!”

These few warriors looked at Lin Xiu and seemed to ignore them and suddenly there was a wave of anger in their hearts.

After all, Lin Xiu got the ‘inheritance’ and they gained nothing.

“This is what we found together. You took all this inheritance power by yourself. Don’t you think it’s inappropriate!?”

A warrior stared at Lin Xiu and said.

“Oh? Then what do you guys say we should do?”

Lin Xiu felt amused, but still spoke up.

“Hand over that inheritance power!”

“He hasn’t completely absorbed it yet, as long as we kill him, we should be able to absorb it again!”

Following the words of the warrior, the eyes of some warriors around became a little red.

“Are you all crazy?”

Looking at these warriors, Hu Ling couldn’t help but say aloud.

She was not worried about Lin Xiu, but about these warriors!

After all, she knew about Lin Xiu’s strength.

To kill these warriors is not a problem at all.

“kill him!”

But these warriors are now attacking Lin Xiu like crazy!

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

Watching them attack, he immediately waved his right hand and a dark blue lotus-like flame was released directly.

Boom—

The warriors who attacked first were instantly hit by the flames.

The entire body was directly covered with flames.

And in just one second, all the warriors who were hit by this dark blue flame were directly annihilated.

The rest of the warriors looked at this scene, their eyes widened and they all seemed to be frozen.

Standing on the spot, watching this scene in disbelief.

In the blink of an eye, several warriors were all wiped out.

What power is this!?

Some of the warriors who had been instigated originally looked at Lin Xiu with expressions of fear.

“You guys...”

Hu Ling couldn’t help but sigh at this moment.

If you attack Lin Xiu, wouldn’t that be courting death?

“If you don’t want to die, know your place!”

Hu Ling looked at the crowd, then said.

Now there are more than a dozen warriors left here.

How long has it been since they came in huh!

These warriors no longer dared to look at Lin Xiu.

After all, the strength that Lin Xiu showed just now was really terrifying.

“You just... did you really get the inheritance?”

Continuing to walk forward for a while, Hu Ling couldn’t help but say aloud.

After all, it was the inheritance of the Sage warrior, not an ordinary inheritance.

“Do you think it’s possible?”

Lin Xiu said with a faint smile.

Hu Ling was stunned for a moment, then showed a wry smile.

It was indeed impossible.

The inheritance of the Sage warrior, how could it be so easily absorbed.

Those just now are probably just ordinary energy groups.

“Origin Blood Bodhi!?”

After continuing to walk forward for a short distance, Hu Ling seemed to see something and said in surprise.

On a wall in front of this, there are a lot of things that look like ovals and raisins.

But its color is indeed blood red.

It looks very weird.

“This thing contains very powerful energy and everyone can eat it.”

“But don’t eat too much, so that your body won’t be able to bear it.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

While talking, Hu Ling took off a lot and put it in her mouth and bit it.

After biting through the Origin Blood Bodhi, a large amount of serum spread throughout the mouth and that fiery feeling spread to the whole body in an instant.

The surrounding warriors were also pleasantly surprised at this time.

They also began to pick and eat these Origin Blood Bodhi.

“Comfortable, it’s really comfortable.”

From the moment they came in, apart from the deaths of the players, this was the first time they gained something.

At this time, they all seemed to be very excited.

“Eh?”

Lin Xiu looked around and seemed to have found something.
