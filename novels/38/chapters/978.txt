Chapter 979: Treasure

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“I have not.”

Duan Zheyan shook his head.

Most of the missions in the C grade weren’t as easy as he thought. There were some very annoying characters involved.

Some were washing the dishes or moving bricks that may give 1 gold coin but the rest would not be rewarded.

“I want one of the C grade missions.”

“Alright.”

“Please show me your watch.”

After picking one of the C grade missions, the bearded man asked for Lin Xiu’s watch.

The robot scanned Lin Xiu’s watch and he read through Lin Xiu’s information before giving Lin Xiu the mission.

“If they were here for the first time, what can they do without the watch?”

Lin Xiu asked Duan Zheyan.

“You can take a loan from here in order to get a watch but that will cost 20 gold coins instead.”

Duan Yanzhe answered helplessly.

This meant that every single one of them who entered the sage warrior space would be forced to buy one of these.

Without the watch, they would not be able to carry out any mission.

Without the mission, they would not be able to earn gold coins in order to survive.

They only have 5 days inside this space which also meant that they only had five day to search for the energy source stone.

“Alright. I’mg going to do my mission now.”

Lin Xiu walked right out of the door.

That’s when Duan Zheyan caught a glimpse of Lin Xiu’s mission – to wash dishes.

The reward of it would be a bottle of water.

This was a mission that would only be done by silly men like Lin Xiu.

Since Lin Xiu had left already, does this mean that he could run as well?

That’s what he wanted initially but Duan Zheyan hesitated.

He wanted to see what Lin Xiu was up to.

Time passed by quickly and Lin Xiu managed to do almost all of the missions available.

The missions from grade A to C were fairly easy but they were time consuming with low rewards.

S grade missions might be difficult but with him around, it was much easier to complete them.

“It’s unfortunate that these missions would only refresh themselves after one week. After today, you won’t get any more missions.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

When Lin Xiu headed back to the centre after the last mission, Duan Zheyan reminded Lin Xiu.

“I don’t need to do these missions anymore.”

Lin Xiu answered flatly before entering the mission centre.

“I found the bones of the dragon.”

Lin Xiu took out a little box and placed it on the counter.

“Alright.”

Seeing how Linn Xiu had already found the material required by the mission, the robot took a look at it and said, “Very well, adventurer. This is your reward.”

He took the material off the table and gave a bag of gold coins to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu gathered his thoughts and suddenly the bag of gold coins had disappeared.

Duan Zheyan was utterly shocked when he saw the scene before his eyes.

What on earth?

How did it disappear?!

Duan Zheyan was beyond curious but he didn’t have the guts to ask Lin Xiu.

“Congratulations on completing all the missions. We have acknowledged your abilities.”

“Huh?”

When Duan Zheyan heard what the robot was saying, he got confused.

The robot has never said such things to him!

“This is the map that will lead you to the treasure. With you abilities, you should be able to find it.”

While talking to Lin Xiu, the robot bent down and too out a map made out of lambskin.

“Thank you.”

Lin Xiu thaned the robot before taking the map.

Duan Yanzhe, on the other hand, was speechless.

Treasure?!

Why was there treasure?!

“As expected. Once all the missions have been completed, there will be a hidden mission.”

Lin Xiu held onto the map and told Duan Zheyan.

“How did you know?”

Duan Zheyan’s jaw was on the ground as he asked.

“You don’t play video games much.”

Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders.

When Lin Xiu learnt about how this world was similar to the gaming world, he had a few assumptions.

Then, when he saw the missions, he thought that something different might happen once he finished all the missions.

Since this was the only town in the entire grassfield and there was only one mission centre.

“But, I still have to take you for helping me with the S grade missions.”

If he did it on his own, it would be quite impossible for him to do so within one day.

However, Duan Zheyan has been here for a decade and he has completed all the S grade missions.

So, he already knew all the details of the mission which allowed Lin Xiu to complete it quickly.

“If I’m right, the first energy source stone should be right here.”

Lin Xiu looked at the map before saying it to Duan Yanzhe.

“Really?!”

Duan Yanzhe was shocked when he heard what Lin Xiu said.

He has been wasting so much time here and he did not figure out how to get the energy source stone.

He was aware of how important these energy source stones might be in the sage warrior space.

There was a function on the watch that was specifically designed to store these stones.

As they walked out of the building, they noticed that there were a few warriors that were gathering by the door. All of them were looking at Lin Xiu and Duan Yanzhe.

“Hehe…..we heard everything.”

The leader of the gang stared at the map that was in Lin Xiu’s hands.

“We never thought that there would be treasures here.”

“That place… would hold the secret to becoming a sage warrior, right?”

As one of the men continued, they were looking at the map in greed.

Lin Xiu took a good look at all of them and all of them had their source ring.

It was without a doubt that these warriors were of the same batch as Lin Xiu.

Duan Zheyan couldn’t help but frown.

Those who are allowed to enter here were warriors beyond the ordinary.

There were 5 to 6 warriors around them and all of them were respected warriors.

This was getting out of hand.

He turned towards Lin Xiu and noticed that he was still looking very calm.

That’s when he realised that the map was gone!

How did it disappear?!

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu said calmly to Duan Yanzhe, completely ignoring the other men.

“Alright.”

Duan Yanzhe thought about it before nodding his head.

“Stop right there!”

When Lin Xiu was about to leave, the other warriors got furious.

Lin Xiu’s actions were provoking them and he was being too arrogant!

The man, who was the leader of the group, was the first one to attack Lin Xiu!

He had a dagger in his hand as he rushed towards Lin Xiu.

His dagger wasn’t an ordinary one. As he transferred his source energy into it, there was a dim blue light that appeared on the dagger!
