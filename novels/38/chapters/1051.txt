Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“En.”

Tang Qi nodded and his face was a little grim. At this time, he looked at his father, Tang Qing and continued to say:

“Father, the one from the Haoyue Sect has been confirmed to be seriously injured, should we just arrest them all?”

He said this without any scruples.

When Ji Mei and the others who were not far away heard his words, their expressions became ugly.

The chief of their Haoyue Sect, the top warrior of the Sage warrior level, has indeed been seriously injured.

They have been hiding this matter, but they don’t know why Tang Qi knew about it.

“Is that so.”

At this moment, Tang Qing turned his eyes to Ji Mei and others on the other side.

In the next moment, the warriors of Tang Pavilion also surrounded Lin Xiu and the others.

Hm?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu raised his brows.

The guards of the City Lord Council looked at these and returned to the dungeon.

There was a wilderness around here. As long as no one was fighting in the center of Baidi City and destroying those buildings, no one will care.

“What do you guys want?”

Ji Mei also drew out her long sword at this time and looked at the people in the Tang Pavilion with alertness.

“What do you want?”

Tang Qi also seemed to be fearless at this time, standing next to Tang Qing, staring at Ji Mei with a sneer.

“Tang Pavilion, is it going to go against our Haoyue Sect?”

At this moment, Ji Mei said with a nasty look on her face.

Although there are many people like Tang Pavilion now, there is still no fear in Ji Mei’s eyes.

Bingbing and LanLan also stood beside Ji Mei with their weapons in their hands.

“Haoyue Sect? What is that?”

At this moment, Tang Qing glanced at Ji Mei and the others, then said lightly.

“you…”

Hearing Ji Mei’s words, both Bingbing and Lanlan flushed with anger.

“And you, you killed Zhang Yude?”

Tang Qing ignored Ji Mei and the others and looked at Lin Xiu at this moment.

The moment he looked at Lin Xiu, his brows slightly wrinkled.

Because he clearly felt that Lin Xiu’s strength was very average.

With such general strength, even Tang Qi could easily defeat him.

But why did Tang Qi say that Lin Xiu killed the Sage warrior?

This made him extremely puzzled.

“So what?”

Lin Xiu looked at him, then said lightly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Tang Qing’s eyes narrowed slightly and there was killing intent in his eyes.

“Boy, you have guts.”

While he was talking, he gestured to the surrounding warriors.

Those warriors seemed to understand what Tang Qing meant. Several of them, holding the weapons in their hands, attacked Lin Xiu directly!

“Be careful!”

When Ji Mei on the other side saw this scene, she immediately said aloud.

Although she knew that Lin Xiu’s strength was not ordinary, she said subconsciously when she saw these people surrounded and attacked.

As soon as she finished speaking, the weapons held by those warriors were about to slash Lin Xiu’s body!

Because of the transmission of their source strength, their weapons have become full of power at this time.

Incredibly sharp.

But at this time, Lin Xiu seemed to be frightened as he stood on the spot without the slightest movement.

Dang–

In the next moment, as their weapons attacked Lin Xiu at the same time, a crisp sound suddenly sounded.

The weapon slashed Lin Xiu’s body, but there was no way to hit Lin Xiu’s body!

When Tang Qing saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

Taking a closer look, you can clearly see that Lin Xiu’s body has a faint source strength covering his body.

It was because of the coverage of the source strength that Lin Xiu formed a transparent armor so that those weapons could not cause any damage to Lin Xiu.

This is simply impossible for a Respected warrior-level warrior to do.

boom–

Just as Tang Qing was shocked, Lin Xiu’s body burst out.

Boom—

A large number of dark blue flames burst out directly with Lin Xiu as the center.

“what!!!”

Those warriors who attacked Lin Xiu were all covered by the sudden burst of flames.

They couldn’t even unfold the ‘Sphere’ at all and they were covered in those flames.

The temperature of the flame was really terrifying.

Letting their bodies melt away quickly.

In a short moment, they were burned into coke.

“Their strength don’t seem like much ah.”

Lin Xiu looked at Tang Qing and the others in front of him and said lightly.

The Tang Pavilion’s people looked at Lin Xiu’s eyes and glanced over, as if they felt a strong murderous aura. At this time, they subconsciously took a step back.

“You are not a respected warrior.”

Tang Qing looked at Lin Xiu and said with an ugly expression. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Although he didn’t know why, he couldn’t feel Lin Xiu’s strength at all, but what was certain was that Lin Xiu must not be an ordinary Respected warrior-level warrior.

Otherwise, just now, his subordinates wouldn’t even be able to unfold the “Sphere” and they would be burned to black coal in an instant.

Tang Qi’s body also subconsciously took a step back at this time, hiding behind Tang Qing.

The strength that Lin Xiu showed just now is indeed a bit terrifying.

“This matter has nothing to do with Your Excellency. Everything before, I, the Tang Pavilion, can let bygones be bygones.”

Tang Qing said to Lin Xiu at this time.

This is a world where formidable warriors are respected. The strength that Lin Xiu showed just now really made him feel that something was wrong.

Besides, it is also possible that Lin Xiu, such a young warrior, would have a stronger power behind him.

There is no need for him to continue like this and have one more mortal enemy.

“Of course this matter has something to do with me.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes when he heard his words, then said lightly.

“You want to be hurt my friend and besides, you want to kill me, how can this have nothing to do with me?”

A faint sneer appeared on the corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth.

“Are you sure you want to oppose my Tang Pavilion?”

Tang Qing never imagined that Lin Xiu would not give any face at all. At this time, his expression was extremely nasty.

“From today, there will be no such force as the Tang Pavilion.”

Lin Xiu glanced at the surroundings, then said lightly.

Hearing his words, Tang Qing laughed angrily, “Very well, I want to see, how are you going to make my Tang Pavilion disappear!”

As soon as he finished speaking, at the next moment, his right hand was raised up in the air.

A large amount of source strength gathered and released from his arm.

A blue energy group burst into the air directly.

Boom—

With a loud noise, a strange pattern bloomed in the air.

“Signal huh?”

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu also said aloud like he was talking to himself.
