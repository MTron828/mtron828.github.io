Chapter 699 Knowing Strike!

What on earth was happening?!

All of the audience were shocked.

As for the bright light that was being emitted from Lin Xiu’s body, it started covering the entire stage!

It even covered all of the Red Moon Field that belonged to Wu Changkong! As for the figures that were stacking Lin Xiu, they completely disappeared.

The look on Wu Changkong’s face changed as well as he could feel the difference after landing on the ground.

But, he did not stop his attack and continued swinging his sword onto Lin Xiu’s head!

It was as if he wanted to cut the sky apart! Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Lin Xiu looked up and activated all of the source energy inside him. With the ‘Yuan’ protecting him, he held the spear with both his hands and released all of the energy from the spear.

A huge, black dragon appeared from the spear and headed towards the huge sword that was coming from Wu Changkong!

“Go to hell!!!!”

Wu Changkong screamed in rage when he saw Lin Xiu defending his attack and gathered his strength onto the sword in his arm!

Koong Loong – – As the huge sword collided with the balck dragon that came out of Lin Xiu’s spear, there was a loud explosion.

It gave out a bright, eye-piercing glow that all of the warriors around had to cover their eyes as well.

There was also a strong wind that blew which was about to blow them away.

“What’s happening?”

They were covering their eyes with their hands but were still trying their best to see what was happening on the stage. However, other than the bright light, there was also the strong wind which made it impossible for them to see what was in front of them.

After a few seconds, they could finally open their eyes properly. Who won?!

As they took a closer look, there were cracks everywhere. The strong, solid stage had turned into debris and it was a shocking scene to all of them.

“Damn it…”

Wu Changkong stood on one side of the stage as he stared at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu remained on the same spot but there was a dent underneath his feet.

Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’ had disappeared but both his hands were still holding onto his spear.

Pfft – –

Then, he spat a mouthful of blood.

“There! I told you that this brat wouldn’t win Wu Changkong!”

When they saw what happened, all of the warriors let out a breath of relief and this was because Lin Xiu’s abilities seemed to be up par with Wu Changkong a minute ago.

If Lin Xiu did win, it would be embarrassing for Tianlong City.

Just when they thought that Wu Changkong was the winner, he spat out a mouthful of blood as well.

All of the warriors frozen the spot.

Wu Changkong was injured as well?

“How did you do it?!”

Wu Changkong’s eyes were still locked onto Lin Xiu. He wiped off the blood from the corner of his mouth and asked Lin Xiu.

His domain forces had completely disappeared!

“This….is the power of my domain abilities.”

Lin Xiu said bluntly back to Wu Changkong.

That’s right. This was the source field that Lin Xiu created after being a rank 9 warrior.

His domain forces had no other features. The only thing that it could do was suppress the other person’s domain abilities.

As soon as Lin Xiu released this, all other domains would be ineffective.

Along with the help of the ‘Heavenly Array’, Lin Xiu’s strength was now at its peak.

But, he didn’t have much time left with ‘Rage’.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and gathered all of the energy inside his body.

He must win this match.

The only reason he came to Marqi Planet was so that he could find Luo Yue. He had just arrived in this little city. How could he be stopped here?!

Fight!

Lin Xiu’s body moved so quickly that all they could see was just his shadow. He held onto his spear and rushed towards Wu Changkong!

“Damn it!”

Wu Changkong couldn’t believe how Lin Xiu was still trying to kill him. His eyes narrowed as he tightened his grip around the sword and headed towards Lin Xiu as well!

Koong Loong – –

As both of their weapons collided, there was a loud explosion and it was accompanied by multiple sparks.

The huge impact caused both of them to step back but soon, they continued the fight.

Lin Xiu’s spear turned red and every time he thrusted it forward, flaming birds would be released.

As he was fighting Wu Changkong, Lin Xiu realised why this man was the master warrior.

This fella’s attacks and defences were all meticulous.

It was a difficult fight.

Fortunately, Lin Xiu had the system and along with the effect from his title, Lin Xiu could activate different types of skills that affected the man,

As they continued the fight, Wu Changkong was feeling tired.

Crap! This fella was only a rank 9 warrior. How could he have such strength?

Wu Changkong widened his eyes in surprise and the look in his eyes changed as well.

“So this is all you have as the master warrior?”.

Lin Xiu said as he thrusted his spear once again and it was blocked by Wu Changkong’s sword.

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, Wu Changkong had an ugly look on his face.

His strength was getting weaker as time passed but Lin Xiu was still remaining the same.

Perhaps, this brat had taken the forbidden drugs?! “Wu Changkong? What’s happening?” At the same time, there was an elder that asked out loud as he continued watching the battle between Wu Changkong and Lin Xiu. He had a troubled look on his face as well.

“Where is this fella from?! How could he be as powerful as the young master?”

The elder seated next to a young man frowned as well.

“They are not of the same level.”

The elder shook his head. He could clearly feel that Lin Xiu was stronger.

Plus, he was aware that Lin Xiu was only a rank 9 warrior. He was not a master warrior yet. If Lin Xiu was one, there would be a unique mark that would appear on his forehead as he released his source field but he didn’t see that on Lin Xiu’s head.

This meant that he was only a rank 9 warrior? But if that was true, how could he be so powerful?

“Wu Changkong cannot lose this match.”

The elder was still focused on the battle as he spoke to the young man next to him.

After hearing what the elder said, the young man nodded his head.

He understood what the elder meant.

Back onto the stage, Lin Xiu had once again thrusted his spear forward and Wu Changkong was still blocking it with his sword.

However, this time, the impact was so strong that Wu Changkong moved a few steps backwards.

‘Knowing Strike’!

Lin Xiu took the opportunity. His Dark Edge spear was covered with a red hue and his combat suit lit up as well.

This was the new skill that he gained from the combat suit and now would be the best time to use it!

Wu Changkong noticed Lin Xiu heading towards him with the spear. It was covered with terrifying energy around it as if he could pierce a hole in the sky!
