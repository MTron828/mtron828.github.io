Chapter 1085: Going to be Killed!?

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Because of this Frost Dragon’s physical strength, it had a very strong defense against the other Sage warriors’ skills.

Ordinary skills couldn’t even break its defense.

Its defense wasn’t so strong against fire-type skills.

Its weakness was only fire.

But at this time, with the frantic struggle of the Frost Dragon, the dark blue flames that burned its body began to slowly disappear.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes changed slightly.

how is this possible!?

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

As its body swayed wildly, even those flames could be shaken away.

And now the Frost Dragon seemed even more furious.

In the next moment, its pair of pupils exuding purple power looked towards Lin Xiu.

It seemed to know that it was Lin Xiu who used those flames to attack him just now.

At this time, it opened its mouth wide and was about to bite Lin Xiu over there.

“Humph!”

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu snorted coldly and the Dark Edge spear in his hand continued to wave.

The flaming birds continued to charge at this time!

But this time, the Frost Dragon clearly knew that those flaming birds could cause damage to it and its body danced in the air.

It actually dodged the flame birds that flew over.

In an instant, it rushed in front of Lin Xiu!

It opened its mouth wide and was about to bite down on Lin Xiu’s body.

Looking at this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly and the ‘Sphere’ opened directly.

The Frost Dragon’s mouth bit on the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu was unfolding.

boom–

With a dull sound, not only did the Frost Dragon not bite the ‘Sphere’ that Lin Xiu unfolded, but because of the terrifying temperature of the dark blue flames on the outer layer of the ‘Sphere’, the Frost Dragon seemed to be in pain as it spat out Lin Xiu’s body.

While spitting out Lin Xiu’s body, a large amount of white energy was gathered in Frost Dragon’s mouth.

It seems to want to spit out this white energy and charge at Lin Xiu’s body!

Lin Xiu saw this scene at this time, without the slightest fear, he directly held the Dark Edge spear and blasted it at its head!

Boom—

The spear attacked its head and a loud sound erupted.

At this moment, the white energy gathered in the mouth of the Frost Dragon spat out.

And Lin Xiu’s body instantly disappeared in place.

The ejected energy directly slammed on an ice peak opposite.

The huge ice peak collapsed in an instant.

Whoosh whoosh—

The rest of the Sage warriors also rushed over at this time and they all used their domain forces at the same time.

Soon, various colors of light covered the surrounding ground.

These Sage warriors were still frantically attacking the Frost Dragon.

No matter how powerful the Frost Dragon’s physical strength was, in the face of the attacks of so many Sage warriors’ skills, its body had gradually started to have scars.

And Lin Xiu’s figure appeared on the other side in the next moment.

The power of this Frost Dragon was really powerful.

And at this time, looking closely, this Frost Dragon flicked his tail and threw the body of one of the Sage warriors.

“continue!!!”

Elder Gong also roared loudly.

To kill such a powerful Beast Saint-level evolved beast, you need to keep pressing on and attacking and you can’t relax in the slightest.

While he was yelling, the long sword in his hand flew out, then formed countless long swords, all of which charged towards the Frost Dragon!

Whoosh whoosh—

The skill of this move seems to be the most powerful skill of Elder Gong.

The thousands of long swords that were transformed into the air suddenly let out loud whooshes in the air.

In the next moment, everything hit Frost Dragon’s body.

The tips of those long swords pierced into the skin of this Frost Dragon.

But they merely pierced the surface of its skin.

But even so, it was very powerful.

After all, none of the other Sage warriors could break through the Frost Dragon’s powerful body.

“good!”

When those Sage warriors saw this scene, they also said excitedly.

But at the next moment, the body of the Frost Dragon swayed wildly.

Those thousands of long swords that were inserted into its body were all shaken away!

Roar–

It let out a huge roar, opened its mouth wide and quickly rushed out to bite one of the Sage warriors.

Although the Sage warrior unfolded ‘Sphere’, at this time, he was also bitten off directly.

“No!!!”

The Sage warrior let out a roar.

In the next moment, the entire body was directly chewed to pieces by that Frost Dragon’s teeth.

Seeing this scene in his eyes, the surrounding Sage warrior could not help but shudder.

They were starting to get a little scared now.

The strength of this Frost Dragon was really terrifying. They used so many skills, the source mark power and they did not cause any damage to the Frost Dragon.

On the contrary, there were only a dozen Sage warriors left!

“Damn!”

When Elder Gong saw this scene, his expression couldn’t help changing.

He didn’t expect that this Frost Dragon would be so powerful.

He had just used the most powerful skill, but it was only enough to break its skin.

It’s not that easy to really kill it.

“continue!”

“Whoever wants to escape will be killed by this Frost Dragon!”

Elder Gong continued to speak loudly.

Those warriors who had originally wanted to retreat, all trembled when they heard the words of the old man.

If they wanted to leave now, they were more likely to be killed by this Frost Dragon.

All they could do was work together to kill this Frost Dragon.

“kill!”

These Sage warriors also roared angrily at this time, then mobilized the source strength of their bodies to attack.

And Lin Xiu, who was in the sky, continued to wave the Dark Edge spear in his hand at this time, creating flaming birds to charge toward the body of the Frost Dragon.

Although the Frost Dragon clearly intentionally dodged the incoming flaming birds.

But facing the attacks of other Sage warriors, he couldn’t completely dodge the flaming birds released by Lin Xiu.

Some flames hit it and continued to scorch its body.

Because the thousands of long swords that Elder Gong just released hit its body, causing it to have many open wounds on its body.

Although these wounds were minor, the flames seemed to seep into the skin from its wounds, causing great pain to the Frost Dragon.

“Very good! Go on!”

When Elder Gong saw this scene, he immediately nodded approvingly at Lin Xiu who was in the sky and continued to shout loudly.

Lin Xiu was only releasing his skill from a distance and didn’t attack in close range.

The same was true for the rest of the Sage warriors.

The Frost Dragon was quickly covered by a large amount of hellfire at this time and its body was shaky! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m
