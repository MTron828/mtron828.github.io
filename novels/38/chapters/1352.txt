Chapter 1353 - 1353 Netherworld Monitor Lizard

1353 Netherworld Monitor Lizard

“Behind!”

Lu Guangyue seemed to have noticed something, and the look in his eyes changed suddenly, and he said sharply.

As soon as he finished speaking, in the next moment, a huge beast rushed over from behind!

“Careful!”

!!

The God warriors around them also reacted at this moment.

All jumped to the back.

Boom——

The beast jumped up and slapped the ground, and immediately made a loud noise.

At this moment, the whole ground also shook wildly.

Lin Xiu looked forward, and he could clearly see that it was an evolved beast like a crocodile.

The size of this evolved beast is very huge, almost like a big truck.

What’s more frightening is that the body of this evolved beast has many sharp barbs.

Under the red and blue moonlight, it looked very scary.

“Netherworld monitor lizard!”

Seeing this scene, Lu Guangyue’s expression became ugly.

The Netherworld monitor lizard was a beast god level creature.

It’s just that this kind of creature lives in the water, but when did it come on land!

In normal times, with so many God warriors present, killing this evolved beast is only a matter of time.

But now, it’s a little troublesome.

Because if you fight this evolved beast, it is very likely that other evolved beasts will come over later.

Especially in this situation.

If the Netherworld unicorn also comes over…

Boom——

But now it’s too late for him to think about it.

Because at this moment, the Netherworld Monitor Lizard opened its mouth and ejected a large number of purple energy rays.

Charging towards him!

The pupils in Lu Guangyue’s eyes suddenly shrank, and he jumped up. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The rest of the warriors also dodged at this moment.

Lin Xiu jumped onto a huge tree branch.

The energy spewed out by the Netherworld monitor lizard was indeed a bit terrifying. The surrounding trees that couldn’t even be burned by flames were directly destroyed by the impact.

“Kill this thing first!”

While Lu Guangyue called out, he directly held the weapon in his hand and attacked the Netherworld monitor lizard!

Bang bang bang——

His saber slashed crazily on the body of the Netherworld Monitor Lizard, and there were extremely loud noises immediately.

But the armor of the Netherworld monitor lizard is too thick, and there is no way to break through it now.

The Netherworld lizard seemed to sense the attacks of these people. At this time, it flicked its tail and sent Lu Guangyue flying.

The expressions of the surrounding warriors changed at this time, and they also held the weapons in their hands and joined the battle.

“Your turn!”

Lu Guangyue quickly ran back from flying out.

He wiped the blood from his mouth and continued to join the battle.

Boom, boom, boom——

Although the Netherworld Monitor Lizard’s defense is extremely strong, under the attacks of so many warriors using various skills, cracks began to appear in its outer armor.

No matter how small a mosquito’s legs are, they were still meat…

Lin Xiu muttered to himself as he looked at the Netherworld Monitor Lizard, which had obviously begun to be injured under the siege of the surrounding God warriors.

At this moment, the strength of the body burst out, and it rushed directly from the tree above.

All the energy in his body poured into his fist at this moment.

It directly charged toward the Netherworld monitor lizard below!

The Netherworld lizard flicked its tail, and at the same time it swept several warriors away, it turned around suddenly and saw Lin Xiu rushing down from above.

His right fist was full of incomparably terrifying power.

Roar–

Looking at this scene, it roared and opened its mouth wide, and there was an incomparably terrifying purple flame gathering in its mouth!
