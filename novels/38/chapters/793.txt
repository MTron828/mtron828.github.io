Chapter 794: Level 53

After absorbing the energy of these odd crystals, Lin Xiu found that his level had increased again!

“Upgraded!?”

In addition to being pleasantly surprised, Lin Xiu directly entered the system’s properties panel:

“Haha, level 53!”

Looking at his attribute panel, Lin Xiu was extremely excited.

Sure enough, it’s good to come here to gain experience.

However, Lin Xiu felt a little regretful that this kind of flaming rat seems to be a rare evolved beast and he killed all of them.

All the potential points were added to the strength, the strength attribute was exactly 3,000!

His strength and physique had both become 3,000!

And as soon as the potential points were added to the strength attribute, Lin Xiu felt a sense of power surge over his body.

boom boom boom —

At this moment, a sound like the sound of a drilling rig drilling came over.

“What’s that sound?”

Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment, then said out loud to himself.

His ears perked up, then he walked over there according to the source of the sound.

“Hurry up!”

“Damn, these stones are too hard...

Some warriors wearing special isolation suits, holding strange machines at this time, are drilling the rocks of the mountain.

The rocks on these peaks don’t seem to be ordinary rocks. The huge machine, with a big drill bit, is drilling frantically.

But no matter how hard you drill, the rock on this mountain seems to be just a little cracked.

“It is indeed the Black Gold Rock...”

“Everyone, work harder! Go on!”

But at this time, these people seemed very pumped up and they still wanted to drill those rocks and carry them away.

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu didn’t know whether to laugh or to cry.

“Excuse me, is there a path to go up?”

Lin Xiu walked over and said to the man in command.

The man was wearing a special cooling suit, but he was still sweating profusely. Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, he looked at Lin Xiu and said suspiciously, “Who are you?”

“Uh... I came here for a holiday.”

Lin Xiu made a random excuse.

That person didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would say that. At this time, he glanced at Lin Xiu like he was a fool.

“If you want to go up, you can go up from there, but if you don’t want to die, just stay here.”

Although he felt that Lin Xiu’s appearance here at night was a bit inexplicable, he still said aloud.

“Thank you.”

Lin Xiu nodded, then walked in his direction.

“This is sending himself to death...”

Looking at Lin Xiu’s back, the man couldn’t help shaking his head.

“Everyone, work harder, hurry up!”

But soon, he looked at the subordinates around him and shouted loudly again.

Unexpectedly, there are still people coming here.

And also want to mine the rocks here.

However, the rocks here are indeed different from ordinary rocks.

And the texture is not like an ordinary rock, but like metal.

It is extremely hard and if it is used to forge weapons, it is indeed a good weapon that can be forged.

However, his Dark Edge spear should have absorbed the power of those amethyst divine water and now it has become more powerful, so there is no need to change weapons.

According to the direction that the man just said, when Lin Xiu continued to walk forward, there was indeed a natural path up the mountain.

It’s just that the road seems to be piled up with a lot of bones.

It looks very scary.

The entire mountain was barren, it was made up of this so-called black gold rock.

This rock has a lot of holes and inside these holes, there were dark blue flames burning fiercely.

Just approaching the place, Lin Xiu felt an extremely hot air.

Hot, too hot.

Looking at the front, the surrounding air seemed to be distorted.

Extraordinarily weird.

These warriors probably fainted from the heat before they even walked up, then died here...

“The ongoing hellfire should still be up there...”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and walked straight up.

zizizi——

As his feet stepped on the rocks on the path up the mountain, it sounded like his shoes were melting.

Even shoes of this very good texture feel like they are about to melt when stepping on these scorching hot rocks.

And at this time, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the soles of his feet were very hot.

The higher he went, the hotter it gets.

damn...

When walking halfway up the mountain, Lin Xiu felt that the heat was unbearable.

And at this moment, the heart of frost in the body started to work.

The body, which was scorching hot at first, slowly cooled down at this time.

An incomparably comfortable feeling came instantly.

“Phew, thanks to the Heart of Frost.”

Lin Xiu only came to his senses at this time.

He possessed something as cold as the Heart of Frost.

After subconsciously activating the Heart of Frost in his body, the burning sensation was greatly reduced.

Lin Xiu facepalmed and couldn’t believe he didn’t actually know to do this just now.

In the early days, it would be more difficult to bear so much.

He took a deep breath and continued to walk upwards.

Because Lin Xiu faintly felt that on the top of the mountain, those flames were the most terrifying.

“Found him!” Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

And just as Lin Xiu continued to want to go up, a voice came from behind.

Taking a closer look, more than a dozen men in special uniforms were looking at him, then rushed up quickly.

“That’s right! It’s him!”

A man nodded the button on the smartwatch he was wearing and a portrait of Lin Xiu suddenly appeared and projected in the air.

A master warrior-level warrior?!

Looking at the more than 10 master warrior-level warriors rushing up, Lin Xiu frowned slightly.

Who are these people?!

I don’t seem to know them...

Were they sent by Sun Zi?

boom boom boom —

And one of the men has already started to signal.

It seems that friends and others are also looking for him.

“It seems that you are here to give us experience.”

Lin Xiu said with a sneer as he looked at the people who rushed up with weapons.

Experience?

When these warriors heard Lin Xiu’s words, they immediately felt inexplicable.

“Take his head!”
