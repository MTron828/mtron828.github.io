Chapter 1019: The Information

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Although Anda’s body was resistant to the lightning bolt…

The strong currant coming from Wang Qiang caused him to feel an intense pain all over his body.

Suddenly, there was smoke coming out of Wang Qiang’s body.

As the lightning bolts disappeared, he fell onto the ground.

It was as if he had lost all the bones in his body.

!!

Wang Qiang walked towards him and stood next to Anda, watching him from above.

“If you…..dare to touch me, I will kill your entire family…”

Anda was feeling an intense pain all over his body. He couldn’t move his body at all and was still trying to threaten Wang Qiang who was standing in front of him.

Wang Qiang glared at Anda and then gave him a good punch!

Boom – –

As his fist landed on Anda’s face, there was blood spitting out everywhere.

“How dare you…”

Boom – –

Before Anda could finish his sentence, Wang Qiang threw another punch.

“Let me go….please….let me go…”

This was because Wang Qiang had punched Anda’s head and he has been having blurred vision.

He could still feel the murderous intention coming from Wang Qiang and he couldn’t help but trembled.

“That’s impossible.”

Wang Qiang heard Anda’s threat earlier and now, he just wanted to kill him!

Crackling – –

His right fist was now covered with a large amount of currant.

Then, it went for Anda’s head!

Boom – –

With a loud explosive noise, his head instantly exploded.

Anda – dead.

Huhu– –

Wang Qian widened his eyes as he stared at the body before him, he couldn’t help but tremble as well.

Lin Xiu walked over to him and patted his shoulder, “let’s go.”

“En.”

Wang Qiang nodded his head.

After being bullied by Anda and his family all these years, he finally got his revenge.

Then, the Angel followed right behind Lin Xiu as they walked back into the city.

After arriving at the city, Wang Qiang headed back home and Lin Xiu went in the other direction.

“Brother Lin, you’re back?!”

Wu Hao, who was still sipping onto his cigarette, stood up the minute he saw Lin Xiu walking into the room.

Wu hao was now looking extremely excited.

The respected warriors who were standing behind Wu hao looked surprised as well.

This was because they noticed that compared to the last time they saw Lin Xiu, he has now become much more mysterious.

“En.”

Lin Xiu walked to the table and sat opposite Wu Hao.

“Did you…..find it?!”

Wu Hao asked as he tried to suppress his excitement.

God knows how nervous Wu Hao was feeling.

“Of course.”

Lin Xiu gathered his thoughts and took out the box that held the Angel’s tears.

With the box in his hand, Lin Xiu gently opened the box.

At that moment, there was a bright purple liquid found inside the box.

Wu hao widened his eyes in shock and his body was trembling.

Bakk – –

Suddenly, the box was shut close.

“Give it to me.”

Wu Hao said to Lin Xiu.

He was already trying his best to stop himself from grabbing Lin Xiu.

This was because he knew that the warriors behind him wouldn’t be Lin Xiu’s opponent.

But, he really needed the Angel’s tears.

“The information.”

Lin Xiu answered calmly.

The Orchid of Heaven. He has to find the Orchid of Heaven.

“I understand.”

Wu Hao took a deep breath, trying to calm himself down.

Then, he waved his hand and the warrior standing behind him passed a document over to Wu Hao.

“Take a look.”

Lin Xiu took the document from Wu Hao.

He slowly read through the things that were written on it about the Orchid of Heaven.

The Orchid of Heaven was a very rare treasure. Not many people have heard nor seen the flower.

According to the document, the flower would only exist in a place where there was extreme heat and extreme cold.

But….where would such a place exist?

As he continued reading the document, the place with both extreme heat and extreme cold do exist.

It was located in the northern parts of the planet.

However, the environment there was bad. Not only were there terrifying evolved beats, there were also warriors from other planets trying to explore the place.

An ordinary warrior would never land his foot at that place.

“Here.”

As he read through the document, Lin Xiu picked up the box with the Angel’s tears and passed it to Wu Hao.

When Wu Hao held the Angel’s Tears in his hands, his body started shaking.

“I will transfer the shares over to you now.”

Wu Hao could no longer control the excitement in him as he spoke to Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Lin Xiu did not reject the offer given.

This was because he would be needing lots of money to continue his plan.

The Wu corporation was the richest corporation on the planet.

By having 51% of its shares, he would have the final say. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Once you return with me, you will be the head of the Wu Corporations.”

Wu Hao said to Lin Xiu.

Wu Hao didn’t seem to care about it nor felt sad about it.

“No. That won’t be necessary. You can continue to manage it.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

He has done his research on Wu Hao as well.

This man may look like he’s wasting his time in the bars but according to what he found about him, Wu Hao was definitely a smart businessman.

However, for some reason, he slowly fell out.

“This…”

“I still have other things to do. I will look for you when I need you.”

Lin Xiu told Wu Hao.

After this, he would have to return to the Wildfire City.

Amongst the four sage warriors who tried to kill him, Huang Fulin had been killed by him.

Zhao Rui, Hei Long and Bai Long.

They are the only ones left.

Plus, he had no idea what the situation was in the Wildfire City.

“Alright. Sure.”

When Wu Hao heard what Lin Xiu said, he wanted to say something in return but soon stopped himself from it.

“Right….If I could know, why do you want this Angel’s Tears so badly?”

Lin Xiu was curious.

Wu Hao was a little stunned when he heard the question. A bitter smile appeared on his face and there was a sad look in his eyes as well.

“My wife has been in a condition where she has been unconscious for years.”

“I heard that the Angel’s Tears would help, which is why I have been looking for it.”

As he talked about his wife, Wu Hao grabbed onto the box tightly.

He was really trying his best to control his emotions.

Lin Xiu then gently patted on Wu Hao’s shoulder.

He thought of Luo Yue as well.

Now, he should head home to earth first.
