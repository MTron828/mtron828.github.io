Chapter 448: Dissolution of the Marriage Contract

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Hearing Yu Muchen’s words, Luo Yue looked at Yu Muchen like he was a fool.

“Hey, don’t look at me with this kind of eyes.” Yu Muchen also felt like he was a fool when he was being stared at this way.

“I’m just helping you to test his strength this time. I didn’t expect that he would be so strong and he also has weird skills – I’ve never seen them before.”

Yu Muchen sighed; he was very knowledgeable, but he had never seen all the skills used by Lin Xiu.

You need to know that in the warriors’ circle, he could be regarded as the ‘Encyclopedia of Skills’. He could tell what skill it was at one glance and how powerful it is.

But this time, he failed.

“Besides, both of you are a good match,” Yu Muchen said with a shrug.

Hearing Yu Muchen’s words, Luo Yue had a look of disbelief in her eyes as she did not expect Yu Muchen to say that.

“Don’t tell me that you think I’m a villain eh? I just did this on purpose, after all, we have known each other since childhood, right?”

“How does it go ah… oh, childhood sweetheart?” Yu Muchen thought about it and said aloud.

“Idiot.” Luo Yue said coldly when she heard his words.

Yu Muchen, who was planning to repeat it triumphantly, was immediately choked by Luo Yue’s words.

“Well, I’m leaving, this Sacred Region Academy is not fun, I’d rather go experience and train.” Yu Muchen said helplessly.

“By the way, if you want to dissolve the marriage contract, ask that kid go back to Sky City with you at the beginning of next year.”

Yu Muchen’s face became serious.

“If he is really capable, he shouldn’t disappoint.”

After which, Yu Muchen walked out of the pavilion, then passed by Luo Yue’s side and said plainly, “All right, goodbye.”

As soon as he said that, Yu Muchen had already walked down the mountain.

Watching Yu Muchen leave, Luo Yue stood on the mountain, looking far away, as if she saw the shadow of Sky City.

Sky City, the most prosperous city on earth.

And those who could be in Sky City must be a warrior of rank 6 and above, or an elite in a certain field.

At this time, Lin Xiu was still practicing in the gravity room.

Lin Xiu, who was under ten times the gravity, was not able to dodge those laser rays so quickly.

From time to time, he was shot at.

But because of the silver leopard armor on his body, those laser rays couldn’t penetrate Lin Xiu’s body at all.

“Phew phew…” After practicing for half an hour, Lin Xiu panted and laid down on the ground with his limbs spread out until the laser beams were automatically turned off.

“Sure enough, training under ten times the gravity... It’s still a bit too hard…”

Usually, when Lin Xiu’s resting, he would directly enter the system interface in his mind.

Taking a closer look, it seemed that he could unlock the rank 3 gene lock!

Seeing this, Lin Xiu was shocked.

And looking at the introduction, it stated that after unlocking the rank 3 gene lock, he would have a complete change.

Even his brain would change. The human brain would become like a computer and it could quickly make judgments when fighting.

And the cell structure of the body would evolve again!

With such an exciting outcome, Lin Xiu almost clicked to unlock the rank 3 gene lock immediately.

But at this time, Lin Xiu could clearly see a row of red reminders beside the rank 3 gene lock icon.

“The probability of failure to unlock the rank 3 gene lock: 50%.”

“Result of Failure: Death (80%) vegetative state (15%) severe coma (4%) severe physical injury (1%)” Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

Seeing this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but swallow his spin. This 50% chance was really too low.

It was either life or death.

Lin Xiu really didn’t have the courage to do this now because he has already died once and he was lucky to be reborn into this world. If he dies again, he would probably really disappear.

And in this world, there were already people whom Lin Xiu was reluctant to leave behind.

“Oh right, let’s look at the rank 6 title!”

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something at this time, and then quickly turned to the title interface, click to view the sixth-tier title.

Tier 6 title: It can replenish body energy once every 24 hours, and has a 30% chance of resisting the 50% damage that is about to be caused to oneself.

This is the upgraded version of the title of Tier 5 Warrior! There is one more effect.

“I can replenish energy once every 24 hours. What does this mean?” Lin Xiu frowned as he looked at this introduction at this time, and then after thinking about it, he directly replaced the title of the rank 5 warrior.

Just when he changed the title, Lin Xiu saw a + sign beside the title of rank 6 warrior.

Lin Xiu clicked into it curiously. At this moment, Lin Xiu felt a powerful force surging inside and the source strength of the whole body seemed to be full in an instant!

And after using it, there was obviously a countdown at the back: 23:59:59

“I see – this so-called energy is the source strength huh!?”

With this thought, Lin Xiu was still very surprised. Source strength absorbs the energy in the air to strengthen the body, but some of the power will be transformed into source strength and stored in his body, whether it is for the release of skills or use of ‘Sphere’, they all need the support of source strength.

If during a battle, the opponent sees that his source strength is almost exhausted, but it is suddenly refilled again, this would definitely be a killing machine that can turn defeat into victory!!!

After resting for a while, Lin Xiu took a deep breath and began to practice again.

Ten times the gravity, he must overcome the influence of ten times the gravity by today!

The time went by quickly. Seeing that it was almost six o’clock, Lin Xiu took a deep breath, took out his scorecard, and then walked out of the gravity room.

“You’re finally out?”

When Lin Xiu walked out, he saw a familiar face.

“He said he wanted to wait for you to come out.” Zhang Yin was also practicing swordsmanship nearby at this time and said when Lin Xiu came out.

Lin Xiu nodded to Zhang Yin, expressing his understanding.

“Interesting, you trained for so long under ten times the gravity.” Ouyang Hang said, looking at Lin Xiu.

There was still a slight surprise in his eyes because even he couldn’t adapt to ten times the gravity, Lin Xiu’s growth was too terrifying eh!?
