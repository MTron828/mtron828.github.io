Chapter 619: Death List

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

As Dong Qian roared loudly, a light blue circular barrier appeared on his body in an instant.

Directly surround his body!

Boom–

Lin Xiu’s punch directly hit his ‘Sphere’, making a loud noise.

Although Dong Qian unfolded Sphere, with the huge impact of Lin Xiu’s punch, Dong Qian’s body flew out in an instant.

Boom—

His body hit a giant tree beside the road behind, and in an instant, even the giant tree was directly knocked down by him.

“Kill him!” The rest of the men in the car also jumped up at this time, and then attacked Lin Xiu!

Although they all seem to be playboys, but in Sky City, even playboys all possess extraordinary strength.

Their weakest was a rank 6 warrior!

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu looked at the warriors who were attacking him, and snorted coldly, then raised his legs and swept across!

[Flaming Leg]! ! !

Boom—

Lin Xiu’s legs seemed to be bursting with flames as he swept it across. Those men who attacked Lin Xiu were not wearing combat suits at all. At this time, they were all kicked out by Lin Xiu.

And the clothes on their bodies instantly caught fire!

“What!!!”

These people kept rolling on the ground, making a painful howl.

Lin Xiu ignored these people and walked over to Dong Qian.

Dong Qian just stood up at this time, and there seemed to be a smear of blood on the corner of his mouth.

When he saw Lin Xiu approaching, his expression suddenly changed, and he wanted to escape from here.

He knew that his strength was not as good as Lin Xiu’s at all, and it seemed that Lin Xiu was not the kind of person who wanted money, but wanted... life!

“Where are you going?”

Just when he turned around and was about to use his body skill to escape, Lin Xiu instantly appeared in front of him.

Seeing Lin Xiu’s figure, Dong Qian’s expression changed and his body trembled.

“What the hell do you want!”

Dong Qian was indeed a little scared at this time, and shouted at Lin Xiu.

“Your life.”

“I’m from the Dong family in Sky City. If you dare to touch me, I want your whole family to be buried with you!”

Dong Qian roared loudly at this time.

Boom–

As soon as he finished speaking, Lin Xiu swung his fist!

The pupils in Dong Qian’s eyes shrank slightly, and he did not expect Lin Xiu to be so direct.

The ‘Sphere’ on his body unfolded again, but this time, because the body’s source strength had not been fully restored, the ‘Sphere’ he unfolded was still relatively weak, and Lin Xiu broke it easily!

At the moment when it broke, the fist full of electricity smashed directly into his head.

In an instant, his head made a ‘bang’ sound like a balloon exploded.

“The end.”

Lin Xiu looked at Dong Qian’s corpse lying on the ground, and said lightly to himself.

Next, it was their turn.

Lin Xiu took out his mobile phone and looked at the people recorded on it.

This was the death list. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

At this time, Lin Xiu had a killing intent in his eyes, and then left.

This night could be said to be a night in which the small families in Sky City fell into a haze.

Because a direct descendant of their family was killed tonight.

“Check, check for me!!!”

The patriarchs of some families were enraged, killing their people in sky city, their territory was simply the greatest provocation and insult to them!

And our initiator, Lin Xiu, has now returned to the Warrior Hotel.

Changed the black clothes, and took off the mask, Lin Xiu was now back to his original appearance.

Holding his Dark Edge spear, he took the elevator to his own floor.

Tonight, relying on the information, Lin Xiu killed almost all the people on this list.

These were all members of a small family, and information was easy to obtain.

But it was not so easy getting that Jiang Feng of the Jiang family’s information.

Those who killed his parents must die.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

“Hey, what are you doing, you look murderous.”

Just when Lin Xiu got out of the elevator, he saw Ouyang Hang passing by with a towel around his neck and a bottle of sports drink in his hand – he looked like he had just exercised.

“Nothing.”

Lin Xiu restrained his murderous aura at this time, then said with a smile.

“Damn it, you’re back? You didn’t go to the Sky Arena, did you?”

It was only at this time that Ouyang Hang came to his senses, and then said to Lin Xiu.

“I did, I won a dozen games and made some money.”

Lin Xiu smiled faintly at this time.

“Bragging.”

Ouyang Hang obviously didn’t believe it. It was a very dangerous place. How could Lin Xiu win more than a dozen games?

“By the way, I’ll pay you back.”

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something, then took out his mobile phone and pressed it directly, and heard a ‘didi’ sound.

“Don’t worry about it.” Ouyang Hang said aloud at this time, and then he saw the information displayed on his mobile phone that Lin Xiu had deposited five million Union Coins into his account.

Pff—

Seeing this scene, Ouyang Hang, who was drinking a sports drink, almost spat it out.

“This is the interest.”

Lin Xiu said.

“Why do you suddenly have so many union coins?”

Ouyang Hang said with wide eyes.

“I already said that I went to the Sky Arena and won more than a dozen games.”

Lin Xiu shrugged helplessly and said – truly no one believed him when he spoke about his strength.

“Forget it, I won’t listen to your nonsense. There is a training room. Do you want to go there to exercise? Many college students are staying here, because the game will be played the day after tomorrow, so these people are preparing.”

“We can also take a look at the strength of those people.”

At this time, Ouyang Hang lowered his voice and said.

“Well, you can go and have a look. I’ll change clothes first”.

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then nodded.

“Well, I’m going to train with Huang Zhen, Qian Yao and the others. I’ll wait for you to come.”

Ouyang Hang nodded and said at this time.

As soon as Lin Xiu returned to his room, Rollie and Xiao Bai rushed over, making Lin Xiu smile helplessly.

“You guys should just stay in the room. There are many warriors here. Be careful, they might catch you to make soup.” Lin Xiu said with a terrifying look on purpose.

However, these two evovled beasts didn’t fall for Lin Xiu’s trick, instead they became noisier.

“Okay, stop making so much noise. I’ll change into a suit and go to practice. You guys stay in the room and play.”

Lin Xiu reluctantly said to the little ice crystal white bird standing on his shoulder, and Rollie stuck to his leg.
