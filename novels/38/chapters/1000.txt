Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Gone… they’re gone…”

Ji Mei raised her eyes and looked above, and said in a dazed voice.

Even after she got what she wanted, she felt a sudden sense of loss that she couldn’t even explain.

Lin Xiu was sitting on the artificial angel at this time, and he had already flown into the air.

“Now, it’s time to go to the ocean section.”

!!

Lin Xiu, who was sitting on the shoulders of the artificial angel, said aloud like he was talking to himself.

“Congratulations to the player for obtaining the Source stone of Water in the Ocean Area!”

Just as Lin Xiu was manipulating the artificial angel and flew towards the ocean section, a voice that sounded like a machine came from the air.

“Huh? It’s been obtained?”

After hearing this voice, Lin Xiu was startled.

Unexpectedly, besides Lin Xiu, two other source stones have already been acquired by others.

Controlling the artificial angel, Lin Xiu stopped directly in front of the ocean.

“Phew.”

Jumping down from the artificial angel, Lin Xiu couldn’t help stretching.

The sea breeze made Lin Xiu feel very comfortable.

After pressing the smartwatch and entering the ‘collection’ interface, Lin Xiu could clearly see the ‘Source Stone of Darkness’, ‘Source Stone of Fire’, ‘Source Stone of Electricity’ obtained.

“Still missing ‘Source Stone of Earth’ and ‘Source Stone of Water’. Could it be the same person who obtained these two energy source stones huh…”

Lin Xiu thought subconsciously at this time.

‘Angel’s Tears’ has now been obtained. After three days, he could go out and exchange it with Wu Hao.

At this moment, Lin Xiu seemed to sense something, and immediately frowned.

Raising his eyes and looking at the sky, he saw a figure after another, flying towards him.

Soon, as these people landed on the ground, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Divine Domain.

All of these people are from the Divine Domain.

And among these people, an ‘old friend’ also appeared.

Huangfu Lin.

“I didn’t expect that you really haven’t died.”

Huangfu Lin looked at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

Although he had completely recovered from the injuries he suffered when he fought against Lin Xiu, the scene at that time was still vivid in his mind.

Lin Xiu, a young warrior, actually used his own strength to fight against them, the five great sage warriors.

They still didn’t manage to kill Lin Xiu.

The thought of this made him feel ashamed.

“Tsk tsk, are you Lin Xiu?”

Standing beside Huangfu Lin, Huangfu Bai stared at Lin Xiu with a strange smile.

“He doesn’t seem capable.”

“Huangfu Lin, you can’t even deal with this kind of kid?”

Huangfu Zhong also stared at Lin Xiu stubbornly.

The source strength fluctuations from Lin Xiu’s body were not very strong.

Just by looking at him, he looked like a very ordinary warrior.

“Humph!”

Hearing Huangfu Zhong’s words, Huangfu Lin’s face suddenly turned ugly.

But he didn’t say much.

“I actually offended three Sage warriors from the Divine Domain, should I feel honored?”

Lin Xiu looked at them and said with a smirk.

Unexpectedly, these people from the Divine Domain actually entered this Sage warrior space directly to seek revenge.

And behind Huangfu Lin, Huangfu Bai, and Huangfu Zhong, there were many peak Respected warrior-level warriors.

This time, Divine Domain seemed to have used a lot of money, just to have Lin Xiu killed.

“I’m sorry, today, you have to die.”

Huangfu Bai said lightly.

“You’ll have to try.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

Whoosh whoosh—

At this moment, the warriors behind the Divine Domain made a move directly.

Instead of attacking Lin Xiu directly, they surrounded Lin Xiu in a strange formation.

In the next moment, the source strength of their bodies burst out.

And the source strength that burst out quickly gathered together.

Soon, the source strength that gathered together quickly spread over the entire ground.

Domain!?

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu’s eyes also showed a hint of surprise.

This strange domain was released by so many warriors at the same time.

Soon, with the appearance of the domains, Lin Xiu saw those strange lights on the ground.

Um?

Soon, his source strength seemed to be bound by some kind of power, and there was no way to use it!

“go to hell!!!”

Huangfu Lin reacted very quickly, and directly charged toward Lin Xiu.

He directly punched Lin Xiu’s body and attacked him!

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes. At this moment, without any dodging, he directly slammed his fist against Huangfu Lin’s fist!

Moreover, Lin Xiu’s fist swung out, and a large amount of electric light burst out.

“Courting death!”

Huangfu Lin roared at this time.

The source strength of the body was gathered in his fist.

In a domain that is created jointly by many people, even Sage warriors cannot escape it.

It can suppress the source strength of the warrior.

At this time, Lin Xiu had absolutely no way to operate the source strength normally.

Huangfu Lin could imagine that Lin Xiu’s fist would be smashed by him.

Kala——

At the same time as their fists slammed into each other, a crisp bone-shattering sound resounded instantly.

Huangfu Lin’s eyes widened, and his eyes were full of disbelief.

Originally, he thought he could smash Lin Xiu’s fist to pieces, but what he didn’t expect was that his own fist seemed to be fractured!

boom–

And in the next moment, the mighty power of the electric ray made Huangfu Lian’s body fly straight out.

“The domain… disappeared!?”

At this moment, Huangfu Zhong frowned.

At this time, the joint domain was covered by another white light.

The effect caused by the domain just now disappeared completely in an instant.

Those warriors who use the joint domain were in disbelief.

“A joint domain huh? Interesting?”

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched, and he said lightly.

“Damn…”

At this time, Huangfu Lin felt the tingling sensation in his hand, and his face became extremely ugly.

With the punch just now, all the bones in his hand were fractured.

Lin Xiu’s strength has improved a lot compared to when they were fighting before! DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Elder Bai, this kid is not easy.”

Huangfu Zhong was really disdainful of Lin Xiu.

But at this time, his eyes became more cautious.

“En.”

Huangfu Bai nodded.

A green source mark appeared on his forehead.
