Chapter 433: Rank 6!

“Phew.” Lin Xiu took a deep breath when he knocked the rank 6 warrior away.

He was very surprised.

Because Lin Xiu’s strength was still surging.

He looked at the other side and could clearly see the fight between Luo Yue and Yu Muchen.

Dang dang dang——

Loud metal collision sounds rang out continuously.

The figures of the two of them were so fast that they couldn’t be seen clearly, they were just like two shadows and there were flashes of cold light.

At the next moment, the other three men surrounded Lin Xiu and attacked Lin Xiu at the same time.

“‘Mountain Strike’!!!”

One of the men holding the rod suddenly jumped up. At the next moment, the rod in his hands emitted a red light and directly attacked Lin Xiu below!

And at this moment, Lin Xiu raised his head and looked up and he could clearly see that his rod turned into a huge stick figure, directly pressing on Lin Xiu’s body!

Boom——

With the use of his skill, there was a loud noise in the arena and the ground seemed to vibrate violently.

Although his skill created a huge impact, Lin Xiu was holding the spear body of the Dark Edge spear at this time, directly resisting his offensive.

And the man on the left swung his saber in the air and a crescent-shaped sword aura flew over directly!

Another man with a warhammer rushed over from the right.

There were a lot of spikes on that huge warhammer. If one was hit, he or she would probably die or be seriously injured!

“Oh no, Lin Xiu’s in danger!” Seeing this thrilling scene, Class 10 of the South Campus exclaimed.

Nan Zhengjun’s brows also knitted.

He had already sensed that those three people were all rank 6 warriors and now Lin Xiu had to deal with three rank 6 warriors. Could he cope!?

Lin Xiu was now holding the Dark Edge spear with both hands, blocking the attack of the man holding a rod.

And the people on the left and right were about to attack him!

“It’s useless! You are dead!” The man holding the rod and pressing Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear fiercely shouted with a hideous expression at this time. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Lin Xiu, run!”

The two people were about to hit Lin Xiu and Nan Zhengjun couldn’t sit down anymore, he stood up and shouted.

He’s doomed!

Ouyang Hang couldn’t help but think to himself when he saw this scene.

If these people were not rank 6 warriors, Lin Xiu could still deal with them, but Ouyang Hang himself has no confidence to deal with the three rank 6 warriors.

Crackling——

But at this very moment, a strange sound rang.

The three warriors who fought against Lin Xiu saw a light blue light flash before their eyes.

Bump–

There was a loud sound and the bodies of all three of them flew out at the same time.

They fell directly on the edge of the arena.

Taking a closer look, you could see that there were many electric arcs flashing on the bodies of these people.

“Ddd…damn…”

The faces of these three warriors were in disbelief.

Just now their attacks were all bounced back and the electric arcs on their bodies now paralyzed their bodies.

They also felt severe pain in their bodies.

“He’s rank 6 already!”

Nan Zhengjun, who had just stood up, clenched his fists.

Looking at Lin Xiu’s in the arena, his eyes were full of excitement.

Now Lin Xiu has a light blue circular protective cover around his body, covering his body completely.

‘Sphere’!

This was the sign of a warrior who has advanced to rank six!

Lin Xiu has reached the level of a rank 6 warrior!

“This guy is rank 6 now!?” Seeing this scene, Ouyang Hang couldn’t help but stand up, looking at Lin Xiu in the arena in disbelief.

And the “Sphere” that Lin Xiu unfolded was different from the normal “Sphere”!

Because there were some electric arcs on the ‘Sphere’, flashing constantly, making a crackling sound.

“That’s all you’ve got?” Lin Xiu glanced at them, then said faintly.

“Courting death!”

Lin Xiu’s words instantly angered these three people. At this moment, they got up and continued to attack Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and before they rushed over again to attack him, Lin Xiu rushed out first!

Swish——

Lin Xiu, who rushed out, disappeared like a shadow instantly!

The look in the eyes of these three warriors could not help but change.

“Where are you looking?”

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s figure instantly appeared in front of a man holding a warhammer.

Lin Xiu saw this scene and his expression changed.

“Courting death!” Seeing Lin Xiu appear in front of him, the man holding the warhammer was shocked and angry.

The warhammer in his hand was about to hit Lin Xiu’s body!

Dang dang dang——

But at this moment, Lin Xiu held his Dark Edge spear with both hands and slashed directly at his warhammer.

Originally, the man wanted to hit Lin Xiu with his warhammer, but the attack with the Dark Edge spear that Lin Xiu was holding was really terrifying.

It actually forced him to retreat.

‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers’!!!

Lin Xiu didn’t give them the slightest chance. At this moment, the Dark Edge spear in his hand continued to pierce out!

And at this moment, the markings on the Dark Edge Spear also light up.

The speed at which the spear stabbed out became even more terrifying and it slammed into the warhammer frantically.

The huge force finally made the man unable to bear it and he let go of his warhammer.

Swish——

Lin Xiu saw this scene, without hesitation, his spear continued to stab towards his body.

“Sphere!!!”

The man’s eyes widened in anger and with a loud roar, a light blue barrier appeared around his body instantly!

The most powerful protection skill of a rank 6 warrior-Sphere!

Boom–

But Lin Xiu seemed to ignore the “Sphere” he unfolded and with the Dark Edge spear in both hands, he was still attacking madly.

Bang! Bang! Bang!

A dull sound continued to sound. Although the man unfolded the ‘Sphere’, he still felt a strong impact.

“Goodbye!”

Lin Xiu let out a cold snort, then with a sudden force, the Dark Edge spear in his hand made a horizontal slash!
