Chapter 799: Falling Into the Fire Cave

“Hehehe, do you know what these fires are?”

The huge lightning hand grabbed Lin Xiu and walked towards the hole in the middle of the top of the mountain.

Looking at the scorching environment below, a hideous smile appeared on his face.

“This is known as hellfire. Even if it were me, I would be shattered in an instant.” Yan Yongxin said with a wicked smile.

Lin Xiu was still in a state of rage at this time, but even so, his body was affected by the lightning from Yan Yongxin’s domain force just now, and now Lin Xiu’s body seems to be in a state of semi-paralysis.

It is impossible to break free from this giant hand of lightning.

The power of the source mark on the forehead appeared.

Whoosh whoosh—

A series of matrices instantly appeared in front of Yan Yongxin.

But Yan Yongxin’s reaction speed is too fast. These matrices have little effect on him and can’t control him at all.

“Final struggle?”

Yan Yongxin sneered.

The huge lightning hand, under the control of Yan Yongxin, grabbed Lin Xiu even tighter.

It made Lin Xiu feel extreme pain.

“Hm?”

Yan Yongxin frowned. Logically speaking, his lightning hand could directly crush Lin Xiu to pieces.

But in fact, he had no way of pinching Lin Xiu to death.

Can’t let this kid grow up.

At this age, he has such power and physique. When he grows up in the future, he would be terrifying eh?

Thinking of this, Yan Yongxin had a ferocious look on his face, and with a thought, the giant lightning hand threw Lin Xiu directly from above!

“Die!!!”

Let this hellfire annihilate you directly!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened, and he fell into the cave.

The scorching flames covered Lin Xiu’s entire body in an instant.

“Ended.”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s body being ‘submerged’ by hellfire in this cave.

Yan Yongxin also heaved a sigh of relief.

Under this flame, no one can survive.

The domain force on the ground and the pair of huge lightning hands slowly disappeared.

Yan Yongxin’s grim expression also returned to its original state at this time.

However, his face looked a little pale.

pfft—

And the next moment, a mouthful of blood was spat out from his mouth.

Yan Yongxin covered the wound on his shoulder and his body trembled.

“I was almost killed by this kid...”

He had already used all the strength of his body just now, but he was not able to kill Lin Xiu.

The physical strength of this kid is so terrifying, it doesn’t look like a normal human being can achieve.

When he was about to leave the bottom of the mountain, he saw the Dark Edge spear that Lin Xiu had dropped on the ground.

“It looks like a magic weapon.”

Yan Yongxin remembered Lin Xiu’s use of this spear before, so he directly picked up the Dark Edge spear.

“Damn... it’s so heavy...”

Just as he took it hard, he almost fell to the ground.

Because he did not expect that this Dark Edge spear would be so heavy.

“This is the trophy for killing you. Even if you’re gifted, you won’t have the chance to grow!”

Yan Yongxin looked at the raging hellfire, took Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear, and left with a big laugh.

At the same time, as Lin Xiu’s body fell into the fire cave, the terrifying flame instantly burned through Lin Xiu’s entire body.

The hair on his body was instantly burnt clean.

The battle suit on the body, at this time, was also burned by the flame and disappeared at a speed visible to the naked eye.

These battle suits, as well as the ‘Red Moon’ gloves, will not melt in the magma. Here, they are all burned.

Lin Xiu felt that his body seemed to be melted by the flames.

Can’t die! Can’t die!

The strong winds and waves have survived by themselves, but it is just a mere flame.

It is rumored that Sun Wukong developed his sharp eyes by staying in the alchemy furnace for 49 days.

And after being in this fire cave and persevering as well, ‘Bodybuilding technique’ will make his physical strength even more terrifying!

Lin Xiu clenched his teeth tightly, and his body moved according to the operation method of the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’.

After the clothes on his body were instantly burned away, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the pain coming from his whole body.

This kind of pain is really too intense as if the pain is deep into the bone marrow.

But it seems that Lin Xiu’s body was reshaped by the power of Amethyst Divine Water.

At this time, as Lin Xiu’s body was scorched by the hellfire, his body also seemed to be like amethyst glass.

The situation looked very strange.

And he didn’t know why, the Engulf skill seems to be able to slowly guide those hellfires into Lin Xiu’s body at this time, and then let the body devour it.

Of course, now that Lin Xiu was in the state of ‘Bodybuilding techniquet’, he sat cross-legged in the middle, and he didn’t feel all the magic.

‘Bodybuilding technique’ ran continuously, absorbing hellfire, so as to strengthen one’s body.

This method is really too painful, if you are not careful, you will die.

Hence this ‘Bodybuilding technique’ was not practiced on Earth, and it gradually disappeared.

Only Lin Xiu got it and was able to continue cultivating.

Time passed quickly, and he didn’t know how many days passed, Lin Xiu was still surrounded by the flames that filled the sky.

At this time, after being burned to a bloody state, the skin on his body quickly healed at a speed visible to the naked eye.

In the next moment, he was burnt by the hellfire again.

This process keeps repeating, if it is an ordinary person, they would probably be tortured crazy.

But Lin Xiu had experienced too much pain before, and all his nerves had become extremely strong.

No matter what kind of pain, he can persevere.

“Brother Lin, why haven’t you come back?”

At the same time, Liu Pan was walking back and forth in the large courtyard of the An family.

It has been a week since Lin Xiu went to the Divine Fire Cave and he still hasn’t come back.

This made Liu Pan anxious. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Could it be that...

At this moment, An Qi and Qian Lin walked over, looking gloomy.

“What’s wrong? You guys look so gloomy.”

Liu Pan looked at them and said curiously.

“Look.”

At this moment, An Qi clicked on the mobile phone projector, and an auction house’s projection advertisement appeared in an instant.

And one of the items is...Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear!
