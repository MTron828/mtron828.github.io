Chapter 38: Operation Clean-up, Begin!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The faces of the soldiers changed when they heard Qin Qiang’s words.

They even had the intent of ganging up on Lin Xiu, but they regained themselves. This youth was only a high school student and not a warrior!

“If you have so much energy to waste on stupid things, why not think about how to survive when you reach Guang Ming Fort.” Qin Qiang spoke coldly.

Because of the incident, the soldiers no longer dared to look down on Lin Xiu and nothing like this ever happened again when the plane landed.

===============================

Guang Ming Fort was once a large military installation designed to withstand against zombies and mutated beasts, but its former prestige was gone and it had become dilapidated.

The exterior of the structures looked tattered and torn from the passing of time.

The plane landed at the center plaza of the fort.

“We’re finally here.” Lin Xiu held the Silver Immortal Soul in hand.

Upon coming out of the plane, he took a deep breath.

“The three instructors and I will head to the core region and clear out the evolved beasts that are of bigger threats.”

“The soldiers from other cities have already moved out for Operation Clean-up, so all of you be quick on your feet. 10 in a team and all of you can head out from the south gate.” Qin Qiang gave the orders to the crowd.

“Yes sir!”

The group was quickly formed into teams of 10 with Lin Xiu grouped with Li Yi.

Due to the contamination, there was a weird smell in the air.

But a warrior’s body would not be affected by the contaminated place. So long as they were not struck or attacked by mutated beasts or zombies that had been infected, they were safe.

“Have you been here before?” While walking, Lin Xiu asked Li Yi.

“No.” Li Yi shook his head and chuckled bitterly, “Everyone here was chosen. I just graduated from the army and never thought that I would be picked.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and continued moving with the team. They quickly arrived at the city gate.

Everyone held onto various types of weapons and the four teams left in the gates in different directions towards the outside.

“Kid, I hope you don’t die so easily!” Jin Hai shot a glance at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

The incident on the plane had humiliated him.

“Relax, I’ll live well.”

“But for you, don’t think you’ll see the light of tomorrow’s sun.” Lin Xiu replied indifferently.

“You…” Jin Hai became infuriated and clenched his fists with the intent of punching Lin Xiu when he heard him refute.

But upon recalling what had happened, he became slightly afraid. Even until now, there was a slight sore in his arm.

“Jin Hai, let’s go.” A soldier pulled Jin Hai away.

“Hmph!” Jin Hai snorted and headed off in the other direction.

After walking for a distance, they saw a town not far ahead of them.

The structures looked ancient and were similar to the structures of his previous world.

Many of the building surfaces were covered with vines and strange plants.

They continued walking and arrived at the town.

“There are many small towns like this around Guang Ming Fort. The 10 of us are responsible to clean-up the evolved beasts and zombies here.” A tall and sturdy man explained to the team.

He was called Xu Wen and was the temporary leader of the team.

Right when he finished his sentence, a strange sound came out from the corner.

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted and he ran forward with the spear in his hand!

“Brat, why are you running so fast!” Li Yi was stunned when he saw Lin Xiu and chased after him.

Lin Xiu saw a few figures upon turning the corner.

The clothes on their bodies were already moldy and their faces were extremely white with bloodshot eyes. Their mouths contained two rows of extremely sharp teeth with saliva dripping down uncontrollably.

They saw Lin Xiu the moment he saw them.

As though having seen a delicious meal, they started moving towards Lin Xiu’s direction!

Analytic Eyes, activate!

“Rank 2 zombie traits: Extremely fast, sharp claws, carries contamination and mutated virus. Overall combat strength: 746”

Combat strength of 746?! Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted, that was too terrifying.

It was true, rank 2 zombies or mutated beasts could rival that of rank 1 Official Warriors!

Although he was nervous, Lin Xiu remained unafraid. He held his spear tightly and swung his spear against an approaching rank 2 zombie and sliced its body cleanly into 2!

But even with its slightly higher combat strength, a zombie was still a zombie without any sense or intellect. They only knew how to hunt and bite.

Zombies were easier to kill compared to evolved beasts.

As long as one remained careful not to get bitten.

“Ding~~ Congratulations Master, for killing a rank 2 zombie, obtaining 2800 experience points.”

So many experience points?

Just as Lin Xiu was celebrating, the zombies from behind had charged towards him.

They opened their mouths and swung their claws with the remaining meat stuck in between their teeth. It looked extremely hideous.

Lin Xiu did not retreat but moved his spear. The spear tip emitted a cold aura as it moved like lightning and thrust forward!

The head of the zombie at the front exploded. Lin Xiu then turned and pierced the chest of the zombie behind him before kicking it away.

Lin Xiu killed a few rank 2 zombies in this corner and gained countless experience notifications.

“Ding~~~Congratulations Master for reaching level 12!”

I’m level 12 already?! Lin Xiu was stunned, his experience points grew every night as he trained and after earning all these experience points, it was no surprise that he should level up.

Lin Xiu quickly pulled up his stats board:

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: Level 12

Experience Points: 15 (420855 experience required for the next level)

Strength: 105

“I have 700 plus combat strength already?”

Perfect, once I add these 12 potential points and level once more, I’ll reach the level of an ordinary rank 1 warrior!
