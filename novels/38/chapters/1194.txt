1195 On the Battle Platform

“Bullsh*t!”

At this time, Fu Tianyuan looked at Fu Tianling and shouted coldly.

“Brother, this kid didn’t bring any warriors here. There probably are not many warriors in the damn city. If he wants to participate, let him go up.”

Fu Tianling continued speaking.

!!

“Tianling is right, just treat it as an interesting program and let him try.”

Some city lords sitting on the other side also agreed at this time.

Fu Tianyuan’s brows wrinkled, logically speaking, this is very unethical.

But at this time, the warriors from various cities around him also chimed in, making him hesitate.

His eyes turned to Lin Xiu’s side and he could clearly feel that Lin Xiu was also a warrior at the God warrior level.

Of course, this goes without saying. Anyone who can become the city lord was at least at the level of a God warrior.

A very weak god warrior.

Fu Tianyuan thought for a while, “Okay, since everyone allows it, then you can represent your Lingxian City to fight.”

“Lin Xiu, don’t go…”

Baili Haoling hesitated for a while and said aloud.

The warriors here were all God warriors and she saw those warriors who had just entered the battle platform and they were also extremely powerful.

If Lin Xiu went up now, it would be very dangerous.

Besides, this Fu Tianling must have deliberately asked Lin Xiu to go up to kill him.

“It’s alright, someone wants to give me God warrior-level skill cards, it’s pretty good.”

Lin Xiu’s mouth curled into a smile.

Without thinking much, Lin Xiu walked straight ahead.

When he was about to reach the battle platform, he jumped up and jumped directly to the battle platform.

When Fu Tianyuan saw this scene, his eyes narrowed slightly.

From his point of view, Lin Xiu really only brought humiliation when he entered the battle platform.

“Master, Lingxian City is just a small border town.”

At this moment, a warrior came over, standing beside Fu Tianyuan and said in a low voice.

Just now, Fu Tianyuan asked his subordinates to check the information about this Lingxian City.

Seeing the information handed over by the man, Fu Tianyuan said lightly, “Since Tianling wants to have fun, so be it.”

“City Lord of Lingxian City, do you know that when you go to the battle platform, it doesn’t matter if you live or die, you can go down now, there is still time.”

Fu Tianyuan now looked at Lin Xiu who was standing on the battle platform and said.

“En.”

Lin Xiu looked at him for a moment and said lightly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Fu Tianyuan frowned.

“Foolish.”

A warrior next to Fu Tianyuan saw that Lin Xiu still didn’t leave and said coldly.

A warrior who came from a small city, even a city lord, must be a city lord with low strength.

“bring it on.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly at this time and spoke to a warrior who was already standing on the battle platform, across him.

“The city lord of Lingxian City, right?”

This is a warrior who looks quite young.

At this moment, he glanced at Lin Xiu with a look of disdain in his eyes.

He is also a God warrior-level warrior and he can clearly feel that Lin Xiu’s strength is not as good as his.

If he guessed correctly, Lin Xiu should have just been promoted to god warrior not long ago.

Rookie god warrior.

“bring it on.”

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up.

“Humph!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu was still not afraid of being nervous at all, the warrior’s expression became ugly.

From his point of view, Lin Xiu was simply foolish!

At this moment, he moved and disappeared directly! Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Bo Nan, he is the strongest young generation in our Taifeng City. He entered the God warrior level a year ago.”

A middle-aged man on the other side touched his beard and said proudly.

In his own city, being able to give birth to a powerful warrior is indeed something to be proud of for him.

“This kid is dead meat.”

At this moment, Bo Nan appeared behind Lin Xiu and the daggers he had in both hands directly stabbed at Lin Xiu!

swoosh—

At this time, Lin Xiu’s figure also disappeared!

Where is he!?

The pupils in Bo Nan’s eyes shrank slightly and at this moment, his attack hit the air.

Is it…

He seemed to feel something, but his body was too late to react!

boom–

An incomparably terrifying force struck, making him feel as if his back was hit by a fast-moving train.

The whole person flew out in an instant!

But after all, he is also a warrior of the God warrior level. When his body was about to fly off the stage, he quickly stabilized himself.

pfft—

However, the powerful impact still made him spit out a mouthful of blood.

“Damn…”

He wiped the blood from his lips, looked forward with his eyes and could clearly see Lin Xiu’s figure in front of him.

“Hm? Quite powerful eh.”

Lin Xiu waved his fist, looked at Bo Nan at the edge of the battle stage and said lightly.

The faces of those warriors who were still looking down on Lin Xiu just now changed slightly.

“This kid, he’s a little weird.”

Fu Tianyuan also had a curious look in his eyes at this time.

Originally, he felt that Lin Xiu’s strength was very ordinary, but at that moment, the strength that Lin Xiu showed was beyond his imagination.

Very strong.

Fu Tianyuan didn’t know why, but these two words suddenly popped up in his mind.

“Bo Nan was careless.”

The face of the city lord of Taifeng City sank at this time.

Just now he was bragging about how powerful Bo Nan is, but he didn’t expect that he would be slapped in the face in an instant.

“Bo Nan, be serious, kill him for me!”

At this moment, he said coldly to Bo Nan who was standing at the edge of the battle platform.

“I know.”

After Bo Nan wiped off the blood on his lips, he said coldly.

At this time, his body trembled slightly.

As the strength of his whole body surged, his body was also surrounded by a faint golden light.

After the god warrior’s source strength materialized, this kind of pale golden source strength will appear.

“Die!”

He took a swooping stance and before Lin Xiu could attack, he pushed his legs hard and his whole body was like a shadow, rushing directly toward Lin Xiu.

Holy-level skill – ‘Falling Petals’!!!

And at the moment he rushed over, there seemed to be thousands of daggers swiping around him.

It looked dazzling.

In the surrounding space, there were a lot of space cracks because of this rotating dagger.

What a terrifying blow!

When the surrounding city lords saw this scene, they couldn’t help but be in an uproar.

Dang dang-

Just when they thought that Lin Xiu couldn’t resist this terrifying skill, a very clear sound rang out.

Those daggers seemed to have been knocked away by something!
