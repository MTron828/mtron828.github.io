Chapter 875: Aoshuang City

“What’s happening?”

Zhao Gui could feel what it was and his eyes were slowly stretched wide open because of it.

When he turned around, he could see that the green ball that he created was getting bigger.

This was not because of him. His source energy would not be able to do this.

The green ball grew.

Koong Loong – –

Then, it suddenly exploded.

There was grass everywhere.

A figure slowly appeared in front of his eyes.

It was that man, Lin Xiu! He was totally unharmed!

“That’s impossible!!!”

Zhao Gui screamed uncontrollably.

He was one of the best warrior kings and even when he used all the energy that he had in him, he still couldn’t kill this earthling.

Most importantly, there wasn’t even a single scratch on this man!

Nothing was seen! Not a single scratch!

“You’re pretty good.”

Lin Xiu said flatly as he continued walking Zhao Gui

“Go to hell!!!!”

Zhao Gui was provoked by Lin Xiu and he was madly whipping his sword around.

There were sword auras that were continuously released and all of them were headed towards Lin Xiu.

Koong Loong – –

These crescent-shaped sword auras led to massive explosions.

His sword aura may seem horrifying but when it got to Lin Xu, it did not cause any harm to him!

This was illogical! This was impossible!!!

Zhao Gui had already turned completely crazy.

With the continuous attack, Lin Xiu was not injured at all and he could no longer keep himself calm.

“AHHHHHH!!!”

He roared in rage. With the huge sword in his arm, he raised it above his head and threw it downwards onto Lin Xiu’s head.

Clang – –

Lin Xiu did not dodge the attack. Instead, the huge sword landed on his neck but it was only followed by a bright, crisp sound.

Zhao Gui’s eyes were opened wide. His eyes were filled with disbelief.

Hiis huge sword was extremely sharp and he even transferred his source energy on to his weapon. This definitely wasn’t the outcome that he was expecting!

“You are a ‘respected warrior’?!”

Zhao Gui finally thought of it and his body shook.

“You finally realised.”

As Lin Xiu answered him in a monotonous voice, he grabbed onto the sword that was on his neck.

He gently pushed it and took away the sword from Zhao Gui.

His body was shaking as he continued walking backwards. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

When he knew that Lin Xiu was a ‘respected warrior’, he no longer wanted to fight Lin Xiu.

The difference in the abilities between a warrior king and a respected warrior was huge.

Even if he was at his peak, it was still impossible for him to be the opponent of a ‘respected warrior’!

Run!

That was the next time that appeared in his head.

Then, he gathered the energy in his body and soon his body disappeared into thin air.

“Did you really think that you could leave?”

Lin Xiu asked Zhao Gui.

Everything here was under his control.

Zhao Gui, who was trying to leave, realised that Lin Xiu was suddenly standing right in front of him.

“You...you...”

Zhao Gui’s lips trembled uncontrollably and his knees felt weak.

He was the leader of the Good Hunters but he was still afraid of death.

Plus, he was still a young man. He wouldn’t want to die here in this place, under such circumstances.

“Let me ask you something. Do you know the Bai family?”

Lin Xiu stood above him and asked the frightened man.

The Bai family?

Zhao Gui was stunned for a while when he heard Lin Xiu’s question.

“No I’ve never ...”

After hesitating for a moment, Zhao Gui shook his head.

“Really?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he asked again.

Logically speaking, the Bai family should be a huge family. How was it that Zhao Gui has never heard of it?

“There are lots of families on this planet…..I have no idea which one you are referring to...”

Zhao Gui quickly explained himself.

“Plus, the mission of the god hunters are usually on other planets. When it comes to our planet, we don’t know much about it.”

“Right! I have an account on the Interstellar Warrior Union. You can log in to the website to look for more information!”

In order to survive, Zhao gui was telling Lin Xiu everything that he knew.

“Give me your account.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes once again.

He didn’t think that there was also a warrior union available on the Nanor Planet.

But…this was an interstellar warrior union.

“Here. Take this. This is a micro computer.”

Zhao Gui quickly surrendered what he had.

He removed the watch that was on his wrist that could be just as a projector to show a computer screen.

His information for the account of the Interstellar Warrior Union was written on the screen.

“Can…..can I leave now..”

Zhao Gui was carefully taking a few more steps backwards as he asked one again.

He was a warrior king but with a respected warrior standing in front of him, he was small and weak.

“You are the only one left that knows about this place?” Lin Xiu finally opened his mouth.

“That’s right. I’m the only one left, no one else knows about this and no one would be heading to earth.”

Zhao Gui already knew what Lin Xiu was about to ask and he quickly answered them.

“Great.”

Lin Xiu spoke with a peculiar smile on his face.

“I’ll be leaving then.”

Zhao Gui looked delighted as he thought that he had managed to save himself.

Then, he started walking towards the gates.

“Where do you think you’re going?”

However, Lin Xiu’s voice suddenly appeared from behind him.

When he turned around, there was a huge flaming bird that was flying toward him!

“NOOOOO!!!!!”

Zhao Gui cried out loud and he quickly gathered the energy in his body.

His ‘Yuan’ was released immediately.

Koong Loong – –

The huge flaming bird that was dark blue in colour as it was made of hellfire instantly destroyed his ‘Yuan’.

This horrible,terrifying flame immediately toasted his body.

Within seconds, his body had turned into ash.

“Now… no one will know about earth.”

Lin Xiu mumbled to himself.

The average strength of those on the Nanor Planet was much stronger compared to those back on earth.

These people can never know about earth.

Otherwise, the people back on earth would be in danger.

“The closest down should be Aoshuang City.”

Lin Xiu was playing around with the microcomputer that he got from Zhao Gui and soon found where he was currently.

He even knew which city was now closest to him.

After making some preparations, Lin Xiu decided to leave.

He took a look at the buildings as he was leaving. He picked out his spear and started destroying the buildings on the front. The palace started shaking and had turned into debris.

This way, no one would be able to find the device that is hidden in the basement.

He took a deep breath before he started on his journey.

Now, he was about to go into one of the cities on this planet.

Lin Xiu had no idea what would be waiting ahead of him.
