1149 God Warrior, Lin Xiu!

But just when he unfolded the pale golden ‘Sphere’ that seemed to be indestructible just now, the terrifying power of ‘Profound Intent.Heaven Breaking Strike’ had already swept over!

With a loud noise, in the next moment, his body was directly impacted and exploded into countless pieces!

Just now, he used special power to unfold the barrier and at this moment, it all shattered.

Moreover, this terrifying force swept directly to the outside!

boom boom boom —

At this moment, the whole ground trembled wildly.

And at this time, all the surrounding buildings were affected by this terrifying power.

The ground shook wildly and all the buildings in front collapsed.

“What kind of power is this!?”

Sima Qiang and the others, who were fighting in the distance, clearly felt the terrifying force coming and the expressions in their eyes changed greatly.

All of them unfolded the ‘Sphere’ at the same time to resist. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

All the buildings in the Holy City collapsed crazily and the ground shook so much that there were a lot of cracks.

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for killing the god warrior and gaining experience 4671495745...

At this time, a pleasant voice came from Lin Xiu’s mind again.

“It’s over.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath.

A lot of cracks appeared in the surrounding ground at this time.

And at this time, if you look closely, you can see that all the buildings had collapsed and shattered.

It was because he was affected by his ‘Profound Intent.Heaven Breaking Strike’ just now.

Entering his system panel, Lin Xiu can clearly see his current attributes:

Rage Build-up: 0/100

“Damn!”

Looking at his attribute panel, Lin Xiu’s eyes were extremely shocked and he couldn’t help but cursed.

The attribute power has also increased too much!

It’s a qualitative leap!

No wonder at the moment of the upgrade just now, he felt that his whole body was incomparably light.

And at this time, Lin Xiu quickly took down the old title of Sage warrior and replaced it with the new title of God warrior.

The new title of God warrior does not fully inherit the ability of the previous title:

Title of God warrior: ‘Resistance Barrier’: With a 35% chance, it will resist 50% of the upcoming attacks.

‘Body of God warrior’: With the body of God warrior, you can communicate with the source strength of heaven and earth and the recovery speed of source strength is greatly improved.

‘Fatal Blow’: A powerful force that gives you a 3% chance to kill your opponent with a direct fatal blow when you attack.

Although the new God warrior title doesn’t have too many messy attributes, it is still very good in general.

After Lin Xiu put on the title of God warrior at this time, he could clearly feel that the power he had just consumed was recovering quickly at this time.

Lin Xiu felt an unusual sense of relief throughout his body.

Comfortable, really comfortable.

It seems that the energy between heaven and earth is absorbed into one’s body by what one needs.

Is this the power of the so-called ‘God warrior’s Body’?

And at this time, there were a lot of information prompts in his system interface.

“Congratulations to the master on your successful upgrade! Obtained ‘Divine remolding pill’! You can take it out directly in the expansion space!”

“Congratulations to the master for becoming a God warrior and obtaining a God warrior suit! You can take it out directly in the expansion space!”

“Congratulations to the master for getting the expansion space increase!”

“Congratulations, master, for winning ten lucky draw chances!”

“Congratulations...”

At this time, a large number of system prompts kept popping up, making Lin Xiu a little dazzled.

But at this time, Lin Xiu was extremely excited.

God warrior, I have finally reached the level of a God warrior!

“I didn’t expect it, but you did it.”

At this moment, a voice came from the other side.

“Elder Ye?”

Hearing this familiar voice, Lin Xiu said subconsciously.

Taking a closer look, a hole was opened in the space in front and Elder Ye rode a mechanical bull out from there.

“An eye for an eye.”

“Hiding here, you will inevitably die in the end.”

Elder Ye walked out at this time, glanced around, saw that the ancestor of the Bai family exploded countless pieces of corpses in the city, then shook his head and said.

“A foul wind and a rain of blood, Lin Xiu, do you think you’re doing it right?”

Elder Ye looked at Lin Xiu and said lightly.

Lin Xiu was startled when he heard his words.

What Elder Ye was referring to was, of course, Lin Xiu killing all the warriors of the Bai family in the entire Namir planet.

“I don’t think it’s right or wrong, it’s just a matter of standpoint.”

Lin Xiu retracted the Dark Edge spear in his hand to the expansion space, then said lightly.

From his own standpoint, he wanted to avenge the Ye family for what he had promised before, but from the perspective of the Bai family, he might be the one who destroyed their Bai family.

At that time, kings and losers had been conquered since ancient times, and history was written by the victors. Who would really care so much?

At this moment, a faint white light emanated from Lin Xiu’s body, then slowly flew out from Lin Xiu’s body.

Faint starlight appeared around the entire space.

This is...

Back then, in the Tower of Trial, that group of light that he absorbed contained the inheritance power left by the old Ye family.

Originally, Lin Xiu thought that everything had disappeared, but he didn’t expect that there were still some hidden in his body.

At this time, it seemed that because Lin Xiu helped him complete his revenge, the energy he left on Lin Xiu’s body had completely disappeared.

“Okay, since you’ve become a god warrior now, I’m going to send you away.”

“Namir planet, it’s not suitable for you to stay.”

Elder Ye looked at the surrounding light, froze for a moment, then said aloud.

At this time, Lin Xiu also clearly felt that after he became a god warrior, everything in this world seemed to have a sense of rejection towards him.

rule.

This was the power of rules of the planet Nanor.

“Go to the God warrior Realm?”

Lin Xiu looked at Elder Ye and said aloud with sparkling eyes.

“En.”

“That’s the right place for you.”

Elder Ye nodded and said.

“Okay, I’ll go, can you give me some time before that?”

Lin Xiu looked at him and said.

“Go.”

Elder Ye seemed to know what Lin Xiu wanted to do, so he nodded.

Seeing that Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared, Elder Ye reached out his hand at this time.

Looking at the little lights flickering around, he muttered to himself, “Welcome back.”
