Chapter 139: Affectionate Couple Condemned To Die

“I will give you one more chance, surrender obediently and come back with me.” Wan Hu saw that Luo Yue was panting and started to chuckle.

“What an adorable beauty, it will be a waste to kill you.”

Luo Yue ignored Wan Hu’s words. While he was speaking carefreely, she continued to attack him.

Sou-

Her sword swept towards his body and drew a hole in his clothes.

Wan Hu was taken back. He did not expect Luo Yue to be preserving her stamina and thought to kill him when he was taking a break.

“You can’t blame me anymore!” Wan Hu roared out loud and went all out!

He had originally planned to capture Luo Yue alive to enjoy her body but with how sneaky she was, he would lose his life if he was careless!

He could no longer care anymore, he would kill Luo Yue!

Clang-

Luo Yue was already an arrow at the end of its flight. Wan Hu raised his machete and slashed downwards. As she raised her sword to block, the collision produced an extremely loud sound.

The sword fell straight to the ground as she did not hold it steadily!

“Time to die!” Wan Hu roared and raised his machete at her neck!

Luo Yue’s eyes changed, she intended to dodge but her reactive abilities were no longer able to keep up with her mind.

Bang-

In the nick of peril, a cold aura flashed past. Wan Hu felt as though something had knocked into his machete and caused his right arm to turn numb and almost let the weapon fall out of his hand.

“You’re not dead!” Wan Hu retreated a few steps and was shocked when he saw Lin Xiu rushing over.

While battling Luo Yue, he never turned to observe Lin Xiu’s battle.

He only heard the loud explosion and subconsciously thought his companions had used their strongest skills to kill Lin Xiu.

Wan Hu turned his attention while retreating and could not find his companions, only a few pieces of flesh.

How is that possible! This kid actually fought against three of them and killed them!?

With that strength, is he already at the rank 4 warriors’ level?

Upon coming to this theory, he could not help but take in a breath of cold air and his gaze towards Lin Xiu turned to fear.

There were 10 seconds left.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and charged towards Wan Hu’s position with the time in mind.

“I will fight it out with you!” Wan Hu was a ferocious man and knew that retreating would mean death. He held his large machete with both hands and slashed down towards Lin Xiu!

Clang-

Lin Xiu had both hands on Dark Edge and repelled the slash!

He exerted force and pushed Wan Hu back before stabbing at his throat!

It’s over!

Seeing this, Wan Hu thought that he was about to die, but realized that Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge seemed to be trembling.

No way, am I out of energy?!

Shit!

Lin Xiu started to perspire in a cold sweat, Fury’s aftermath had taken effect.

My body… can’t move!

Although Wan Hu did not know what was going on, it was the perfect opportunity for him!

Bang- Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu was no longer able to wield Dark Edge as he was out of energy and it fell straight to the ground.

“Brat, go and die!” Wan Hu sneered sinisterly.

He knew that Lin Xiu was spent!

“I am the final victor!!!” Wan Hu’s expression was ugly as he raised his large machete and slashed towards Lin Xiu!

It’s over!

Lin Xiu’s eyes opened wide as he watched the blade come down at him.

Bang-

RIght at this time, a low sound came out as a figure stood before him.

Luo… Luo Yue?

Wan Hu was surprised, he did not expect Luo Yue to appear here.

And Wan Hu’s machete was moving towards her shoulder.

Although Luo Yue had a shoulder guard on, the power in Wan Hu’s slash was extremely large and his machete was not an ordinary grade weapon. The slash actually cut through the armor, into her shoulder, and broke her bones.

THe machete fractured her collarbone.

“Zezeze, who would have thought that you would block the attack for this kid, how touching.” Wan Hu already knew that victory was at hand as he laughed out loud.

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue’s figure in a daze.

She stood in place without moving, her petite figure was filled with determination and willpower. She was unwilling to fall because of the slash.

“I did not do this to save you.” As though having sensed his gaze, Luo Yue spoke up indifferently.

Her face had turned pale because of the long drawn-out battles.

“Hahaha, seems like today will be the death day for the both of you.” Wan Hu laughed out loud.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue could no longer fight, making Wan Hu extremely confident.

Damn it, am I going to die here?

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth.

But right at this time, a blue object suddenly rolled down from his body.

Rollie?

Lin Xiu was surprised at the sight of Rollie.

What was it doing?

Lin Xiu wanted to find out, but he saw Rollie drill its way into the sand like a gopher and towards Wan Hu.

Wan Hu did not notice Rollie that was slowly rolling towards him in the sand due to his happiness.

“Sigh, seems like we are about to become an affectionate couple condemned to die.” Although Lin Xiu did not know what Rollie was doing, he decided to feign acceptance and sighed.

“Shut up.” Luo Yue snorted out when she heard his words even before Wan Hu could say a thing.

“Affectionate couple? Zeze, I will let you watch how I toy with her to death!” Wan Hu suddenly exerted strength and pulled Luo Yue’s clothes off as he laughed.

Right at this time, a black figure suddenly shot out from the sand and right into his opened mouth!
