1340 Blood Essence Pool

Soon, with Riyan God Lord guiding the way, all three of them walked past the tunnel very quickly.

The eye-blinding light caused all of them to narrow their eyes.

After getting used to the light, Lin Xiu looked around and noticed that they were floating in the air!

The ground beneath their feet felt weird.

“Hmm? You’re here?”

There was a voice that rang in his head that caused Lin Xiu to turn in that direction.

There was a huge figure that appeared before them.

Tianling God King!

He was wearing a combat suit that was pure white and he looked like a warrior.

Such overpowering pressure.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but think to himself.

‘I thought that with the help of the system, I would be invincible once I became a warrior god.’

Lin Xiu didn’t think that it was possible for someone to have such powerful energy like the God King.

Even if he activated ‘Sacrifice’ and used up all of the energy in his body to increase his body strength, he still wouldn’t be able to defeat the God King.

Lin Xiu was still too weak.

“Greetings, God King.”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng quickly greeted the God King.

Lin Xiu followed along as well.

“Please, get up.”

Tianling God King smiled as he looked at all three of them.

As for Riyan God Lord, he moved to the side.

“I’ve watched the match this time. It was incredible.”

Tianling God King continued smiling.

“Well, I shall not waste anymore time.”

“Now, I got you here because there is a mission for you.”

Tianling God King has his eyes fixed on all three of them as he speaks.

A mission?

When they heard what was said, Lin Xiu looked confused.

Not only for him, even Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng were both shocked. They had no idea what he was referring to.

“Tianmen City. Have you heard of it?”

Tianling God King showed a mysterious smile.

Tianmen City?

It has only been a short time since Lin Xiu arrived at Warrior God Realm which is why he has never heard of it.

But, Yuan Zheng and Xiao Qingchen seemed excited.

“Is that the city that only opens once every 21 years?”

Xiao Qingchen was trying his best to suppress the excitement inside him.

“That’s right.”

“Tianmen City only opens once every 21 years. All of the young, talented warriors from here will be allowed entry.”

“Since all of you are below 50, there shouldn’t be a problem.”

Tianling God King explained it to them carefully.

So… all those before 50 were considered young?

Lin Xiu caught onto something interesting and he thought that it was funny.

“Does this mean that there will be no old folks going with us this time?”

Lin Xiu asked subconsciously.

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng had their lips twitch subconsciously.

What did he mean by….old folks?

“En. All of them would be the warrior gods of the new generation.

Tianling God King nodded his head.

The corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth then curved upwards.

After meeting Riyan God Lord and Tianling God King, Lin Xiu knew that there were still so many warrior gods that were more powerful than him.

God knows how long they have trained and with his current abilities, it would be impossible for him to defeat them.

However, if it was those below 51 years old, Lin Xiu could swear that no one would be better than him!

“Well, I want you to get first in.”

Tianling God King continued looking at them.

...

First?

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng showed a bitter smile.

Although both of them were already considered the best….

There were still other warrior gods from all around the realm that would head to Tianmen City.

There were already a few mysterious but powerful new warrior gods that did not participate in the Multi-city Contest, but they would definitely head to Tianmen City.

“Don’t worry. There’s still 31 days left. You can continue training here for the time being.”

Tianling City seemed to have read what they had in mind and continued talking to them.

“Come here.”

With that said, Tianling God King started walking in the other direction.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and followed behind him.

As they continued walking, Lin Xiu felt a surge of warmth around him.

...

There was also a huge haze before them.

“What is this?”

It was as if they were standing on clouds. As they looked forward, it seemed like there was a…. Hotspring?

That’s right! There was a hot spring that was located on top of a huge piece of cloud.

But, the fluid inside did not look like water. It looked more like…blood?

“Is this God’s Blood?!”

Xiao Qingchen was already envious of Lin Xiu for getting God’s Blood and when he saw the pool before him, he got excited.

“This isn’t it.”

Riyan God Lord noticed how excited Xiao QIngchen was and he couldn’t help but speak up to correct him.

It isn’t?

Xiao Qingchen, who got anxious earlier, felt as if a bucket of cold water had been poured over his head.

“This is the Energy Essence.”

Tianling God King finally told them what it was.

The Energy Essence?!

When these words came out of his mouth, Yuan Zheng was the one who looked surprised.

He wanted to say something but nothing was coming out of his mouth.

“These are pure energy essence.”

“After soaking in this, all of your energy would greatly improve.”

Lin Xiu could already feel how much energy this hotspring contained.

If he was able to absorb them all, his abilities will definitely have a major breakthrough.

“Jump inside then until your body can no longer stand it. Just remember. The longer you can stay inside, the more breakthrough you will achieve.”

Tianling God King reminded them.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng were dying to jump inside. Both quickly tore off their clothes and jumped into the pool.

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment before removing his clothes and joining them in the hotspring.

As soon as he jumped into it, Lin Xiu could feel his body sinking.

He closed his eyes and quickly activated the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

With the skills activated, it felt as if all the pores in his body had been stretched open.

Continuous amount of energy rushed into Lin Xiu’s body.

The energy that this essence contained was incredibly scary.

Lin Xiu’s body had just been rebuilt by the God’s Blood and now, it was undergoing another quenching process.

“Ding!”

“Energy found. Would you like to activate ‘Engulf’?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The system’s notification popped inside Lin Xiu’s mind.

He was a little shocked at first when he heard the notification.

That’s right! This energy essence was a form of unique energy. With ‘Engulf’, he would have no problem absorbing them!

Lin Xiu merely hesitated for a moment and clicked on the ‘agree’ button!

Tianling God King was the one who said that it would be better for them to stay here for a longer time. If it was possible, Lin Xiu would like to absorb all of the energy that was contained here!

With his skills activated, all of the energy started rushing into Lin Xiu’s body.

He could now feel a sharp pain all over his body!
