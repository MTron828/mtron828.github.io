Chapter 390: Hatched

When he took a closer look, Lin Xiu could finally see what was inside his backpack.

It turned out to be a white egg!

Surprisingly, the egg was now giving out a warm, bright light.

“The egg of the Ice Crystal White Bird?” Lin Xiu was stunned for a moment when he thought of the incidents that happened when he was in the G17 dumpster area.

This egg must have been brought back from the Ice Crystal White Bird’s body when they killed it.

As he recalled, Lin Xiu no longer hesitated. He immediately picked up the egg, took it out of his backpack, and placed it on the table.

As he looked at it, there were already multiple cracks that were found on the egg.

Plus, the snow-white egg seemed to be vibrating slightly.

Was it about to hatch?

Lin Xiu was shocked when he saw the scene before his eyes.

This Ice Crystal White Bird’s egg must have been in his backpack for quite some time. He wouldn’t have known that it would hatch on its own today!

Lin Xiu held his breath and glared at the egg that was right in front of him.

Kala Kala – –

The sound of the egg cracking continued and soon, the small cracks that were on it became wider and longer.

Pak ––

Then, along with the crisp voice that rang through the room, the egg cracked open!

There was a little head that popped out of the eggshell.

“This is…” Lin Xiu looked at the little head that popped out with his eyes wide open. His jaw was on the ground and he was talking to himself.

Chirp chirp ––

Its entire body was snow-white in color. It was a young Ice Crystal White Bird that looked like a little chicken that had just hatched. The bird tried to open its eyes and showed a pair of glowing, bright eyes. It was staring at Lin Xiu when it gave out a loud, happy cry.

Pai pai pai ––

While it was struggling to get out of the shell, Lin Xiu could clearly see that it had jumped out of the shell.

Its entire body was clean and fair as there were no feathers on it yet.

The bird subconsciously tried to flap its wings, wanting to fly towards Lin Xiu but for some reason, the bird wasn’t able to fly now.

With just one flap, it directly fell off the table and was heading onto the ground.

Boom – –

Fortunately, Lin Xiu’s reaction was fast enough to catch it and he held onto it carefully in his palm.

With its body so small, it doesn’t even resemble the horrifying rank seven Ice Crystal White Bird.

Chirp Chirp – –

When the little bird noticed that it was now in Lin Xiu’s hand, it seemed extremely excited and was rolling its tiny body back and forth.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but smile when he saw what the little bird was up to. It was indeed a really cute bird.

Plus, Lin Xiu could clearly feel the cold air that was coming from the body of the Crystal White Bird.

“I should give you a name…” Lin Xie said to himself as he stared at the little Ice Crystal White Bird in his hands.

Then, the little bird reacted as if it understood what Lin Xiu said. It looked up and stared at Lin Xiu.

“I shall name you Xiao Bai!” Lin Xiu looked at its body now that was fair and clean. After thinking about it, he named the little bird.

Chirp Chirp – –

The little Ice Crystal White Bird seemed happy with it as it started jumping up and down in Lin Xiu’s hand.

But, after a while, it started looking sick.

“What’s wrong?” Lin Xiu looked at the bird that suddenly looked weak and tired, he was shocked.

The bird was just fine a minute ago, why did it suddenly turn this way?

Lin Xiu also noticed that the cold air that was coming from it was getting weaker compared to before.

What’s wrong with it?!

Lin Xie thought hard and finally realized that it may be because the little bird’s physique was still weak since it is so little. It would be more suitable for it to grow in colder weather.

Perhaps it’s the warmth in his hands that made it uncomfortable?

As he thought of it, Lin Xiu wanted to place it back into its eggshell.

However, the little bird bit him instead. It didn’t want to leave Lin Xiu’s hands.

Lin Xiu was dumbfounded by the reaction of the little creature. After considering its condition, Lin Xiu picked up the eggshells and placed them on Lin Xiu’s hands.

The eggshell was special. There was a white mist that was coming from it like dry ice and it felt cool as well.

With the eggshells on Lin Xiu’s palm, the Ice Crystal White Bird must have felt the difference as it started to slowly stand up on its own. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Guess I’ll have to make you a special environment for you to grow.” Lin Xiu let out a sigh of relief since he thought that the Ice Crystal White Bird was about to die.

When Lin Xiu tried to put it back down on the table, its little claw was still clinging onto Lin Xiu’s hands.

Lin Xiu found it funny when he saw the Ice Crystal White Bird’s reaction. This little thing must have misunderstood him as its mother.

“Alright, you shall stay with me.” Lin Xiu said helplessly.

There were a lot of things that could be found at the exchange center, even the goods that were sold at the Sacred Region Academy.

He should be able to find what he needs.

“Gungun, you stay here, alright? Wait for me to come home.” Lin Xiu turned towards the creature that was round and was the size of a football.

Kuuuuuu Kuuuuuu –

Gungun reacted like he understood Lin Xiu and let out a peculiar cry.

With the little Crystal White Bird, Xiao Bai, in his right hand, Lin Xiu started heading towards the Exchange Center.

The Exchange Center was far away from Lin Xiu’s place and soon he had arrived.

It was only eight in the morning but the Exchange Center was already filled with students.

When Lin Xiu left, he brought along his Fire Scale Combat Suit.

“Young fellow, you’re back?” The elder who was by the counter saw Lin Xiu who was entering the center. His eyes lit up in excitement and he started waving at Lin Xiu.

When Lin Xiu noticed the elder who was calling him, he quickly walked towards him.

“This combat suit, do you think they’ll take it back?” Lin Xiu placed the armor on the table and asked the elder.

When he saw the Fire Scale Combat Suit, the elder narrowed his eyes and said, “you didn’t find it?”

“No.” Lin Xiu shook his head.

Previously, Lin Xiu had promised him that if he found the Dark Red Spider Lily, he wouldn’t have to return the points that he loaned Lin Xiu.

However, when he was in the Dark Forest, Lin Xiu didn’t even get to see the thing that the elder wanted.

The elder looked into Lin Xiu’s eyes. The look in his eyes was still the same as before as he sighed, “It’s alright. I always knew that it wasn’t easy to find it. Otherwise, I wouldn’t have wasted 20 years looking for it…”

He mumbled to himself as he reached out for the Fire Armour Combat Suit. He took a look at it and asked, “what’s wrong? It wasn’t helpful?”

“For me, it was useless.”
