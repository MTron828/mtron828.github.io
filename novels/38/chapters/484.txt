Chapter 485: Hospital

As soon as he got off the spacecraft, Lin Xiu heard a roar from behind before he had time to even look at the surroundings.

He took a closer look – isn’t that Director Qian?

Director Qian held the pale Zhao Xia and shouted at the staff in front of him.

“He is from the Zhao family. If you can’t put his finger back, you’re in trouble!” Director Qian said arrogantly.

When the staff heard the “Zhao family”, their expressions changed.

The Zhao family of Bai Di City was one of the most powerful families. It was said that the strength of many warriors in the family has reached rank 6!

In this kind of city, rank 6 warriors were considered quite formidable, not to mention that there were many rank 6 warriors in their clan.

“We will take young master Zhao and you to the best hospital right away,” the staff member said quickly.

Soon, an emergency aircraft flew over and picked up the two people.

“Not going to kill them?” Luo Yue said indifferently as she watched the two flying away for treatment.

Luo Yue usually killed those who dare to offend her, without hesitating or showing mercy.

“Forget it.” Lin Xiu shook his head.

Ye Shuang’er was here, Lin Xiu didn’t want her to see him killing her classmate.

Although this guy was indeed very hateful, and Lin Xiu still saw the hint of sinister in his eyes, it was obvious that as long as he was in Bai Di City, he would probably come over to cause trouble.

“But those who provoke you are really unlucky.” Lin Xiu laughed at Luo Yue.

Luo Yue was not like him, just like when he first met her, she nearly killed him.

Luo Yue glaced at Lin Xiu and didn’t speak.

Seeing Luo Yue’s eyes, Lin Xiu found it interesting. Luo Yue, who has facial paralysis, seemed different.

They were in a spacious parking airport and there were already many classmates around, embracing with their parents.

“Shuang’er, where’s the uncle and auntie?” Lin Xiu looked around.

“Strange, I have told them that I will be reaching Bai Di City soon.” After Ye Shuang’er bid farewell to her friend Dong’er, she walked to Lin Xiu’s side, looked around, and really didn’t see her parents.

They should be very close to this area.

“Let me call them.” Ye Shuang’er thought for a while, then took out her mobile phone and dialed his mother’s phone number.

The person on the other end didn’t answer and it sounded after it rang for more than a minute.

“Ye Shuang’er?” An unfamiliar voice came over there.

“You are?” Ye Shuang’er was taken aback for a moment, and then asked.

“Are you Guo Mei’s daughter? Your father was beaten up and your mother fainted in anger. They’re now in our hospital.” This was the voice of a middle-aged woman and she sounded a little anxious.

What!?

Ye Shuang’er’s face changed drastically when she heard her words.

“Which hospital?” Ye Shuang’er said quickly at this moment.

“The People’s Hospital of Bai Di City, on the 15th floor.” The person said aloud.

“Okay, I’ll go over right now.” Ye Shuang’er said quickly.

“What’s the matter?” Seeing Ye Shuang’er look very anxious, Lin Xiu subconsciously said.

Ye Shuang’er took a deep breath, and then told Lin Xiu what happened.

“Let’s go to the hospital together.” Lin Xiu frowned, then said aloud.

He looked at Luo Yue and she nodded. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Soon, the three of them took a maglev taxi, and after a while, they arrived at the hospital.

The best People’s Hospital in Bai Di was very big and it was said that this place could even transform people into cyborgs.

But ordinary warriors would not accept transformation, only those disabled warriors would want this kind of surgery.

They took the elevator and quickly reached the 15th floor.

As soon as they reached the 15th floor, they saw a middle-aged woman walking along the corridor anxiously.

She saw Ye Shuang’er walking over and she beckoned then said, “Are you Ye Shuang’er?”

“Yes, Auntie.” Ye Shuang’er nodded, seeing her mother’s mobile phone in her hand, it was obvious that it was the person who just called.

“Where are my parents?”

“They are over here.” The middle-aged woman nodded, and then led Ye Shuang’er into the ward at the front.

“I hate hospitals.” Luo Yue seemed to smell some strong disinfectant smell and frowned.

“Why?” Lin Xiu said curiously.

Luo Yue shook her head and didn’t speak any more, which made Lin Xiu even more curious.

But now was not the time to think about this. He and Luo Yue walked over to the front. When he reached the ward in front, he could see that there were two beds in the ward, two people lying down.

They were Ye Shuang’er’s parents.

Ye Shuang’er’s mother seemed fine, she just fainted, but Ye Shuang’er’s father was in a miserable situation. There was a lot of blood on his body. His trousers had been cut open, revealing his fuzzy legs and a nurse was disinfecting his wounds.

“Doctor, how are they now, my dad is fine, right?” Ye Shuang’er asked the doctor who was standing at a side and wearing a white mask.

Hearing Ye Shuang’er’s words, the doctor tore off the mask, exposing his mouth, and uttered, “Broken limbs or broken ribs. He must undergo surgery immediately. Otherwise, even if there is no life-threatening condition, he will be disabled.”

“Then perform the operation quickly.” Ye Shuang’er said anxiously.

The doctor nodded, “The operation can be performed immediately, but the fee must be paid first.”

“Yes, how much does it cost?” Ye Shuang’er nodded and asked, she still has some savings.

And following the school to participate in missions, she gotten some low-ranking odd crystals that could be sold.

“It depends on which surgery you choose. If you want the traditional treatment method, he will take more than a month to fully recover, but if you use the restoration fluid, he will be cured tonight.” The doctor said aloud.

Nowadays, ordinary soft tissue contusions, or internal injuries, could be repaired directly by lying in the medical cabin, but this kind of bone fracture requires surgery to connect the bone.

“With the best restoration fluid, money is not a problem.” Lin Xiu walked in and then said lightly.

“But…”

Ye Shuang’er heard Lin Xiu’s words, and when she was about to say something, Lin Xiu waved his hand and said, “Uncle Ye was very good to me before. How can I not help if something happened to him and this small amount of money is nothing to me.”
