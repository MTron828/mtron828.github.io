Chapter 779: Destroy Qian Qiurong

‘What is this?!’

At this time, his face was full of shock.

“Blast.”

Lin Xiu, who was opposite him, said lightly at this time.

The black source mark on the head, at this time, slightly exuded a strange light.

boom–

At this moment, the square matrix that stuck his fist exploded in an instant!

“What!!!”

At this moment, Qian Qiu Rong suddenly let out a scream.

Taking a closer look, his fist was directly blown off!

At that moment, with his fist in that matrix, he could not even transmit the source strength over.

As if there was a special space there.

“Ama… amazing...”

Liu Pan was dumbfounded when he saw this scene.

This kind of strange source mark power is simply incredible.

Even Qian Qiurong’s hand was blown off.

And at this time, Lin Xiu didn’t give him any chance to breathe. With the spear in his hand, he continued to attack!

boom boom boom —

The spear in both hands danced and the terrifying flaming birds charged away again!

The temperature of these flaming birds is even more terrifying than before.

Even Liu Pan and others who were nearby could feel their whole body was instantly scorching hot due to these flaming birds.

At this time, Qian Qiurong forcibly resisted the severe pain in his arm and dodged his body.

Although he dodged those flaming birds, Lin Xiu’s figure had already rushed in front of him.

In an instant, the spear in his hand turned into a giant black dragon and charged towards his body!

“NO!!!”

Seeing this scene, Qian Qiurong couldn’t help roaring loudly.

The body wanted to continue to dodge, but found that a large number of square matrices appeared around him, blocking his body and there was no way to dodge. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He hadn’t had time to unfold the ‘Sphere’ and at this moment, the black dragon directly devoured his body!

Boom—

With a loud noise, Qian Qiurong’s body was instantly hit by the black dragon and his body was bloody.

There is no ‘Sphere’ protection, even around his body

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for killing a warrior and gaining experience 448572146...”

Looking at the progress bar of experience, it has increased by 15%.

This was quite a lot.

At this time, he felt that his body seemed to have improved a lot in all aspects.

Especially the control of power seemed to have become more proficient.

He looked at the Dark Edge spear in his hand and at this moment, it slowly changed from the original state of amethyst glaze to pitch black in color.

“Did my spear also absorb that power…”

Lin Xiu vaguely remembered that in the previous battle, there seemed to be a crack on the body of his Dark Edge spear, but now it was completely gone.

It’s really weird.

Boom—

On the other side, the battle has also reached a climax.

Those warriors were fighting desperately.

And the huge body of the Raging Flame Lion is now beginning to have many wounds.

At this time, blue blood flowed out.

“Brother Lin, did you kill him?”

Liu Pan came up at this time and said aloud.

“En, he should be dead.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

He looked at Qian Qiurong who was on the ground. At this moment, his eyes were wide open, as if he still couldn’t believe that he was killed by a young man.

“This guy is too annoying.”

An Qi and Qian Lin also spoke out at this time.

At this time, the vibration of the ground became more and more obvious and the Raging Flame Lion seemed to have reached the end of its power. At this time, it became even more violent.

The surrounding warriors have also suffered countless casualties.

“What do we do now?”

An Qi and the others looked at Lin Xiudao.

“I’ll kill it first.”

Lin Xiu hesitated for a while, then said with a firm look.

“Kill the Raging Flame Lion!?”

Qian Lin exclaimed.

An Qi and Liu Pan had a look of surprise in their eyes.

Because from Lin Xiu’s tone, he seemed to have confidence that he could directly kill the Raging Flame Lion.

“I should be able to.”

Lin Xiu nodded and looked at the distance.

“By the way, do you know what Amethyst Divine Water is?”

When Lin Xiu was about to go ahead with the spear in his hand, he seemed to have thought of something and said it aloud.

There was such a big change in his body and he successfully unlocked the gene lock. The big reason was the energy of this amethyst divine water.

And there is that white light in his heart.

This is the power that was inherited from the elder at the Tower of Trials.

It’s just that after this time, the light has become much weaker.

“Amethyst Divine Water? I don’t think I’ve heard of it before…”

Liu Pan thought about it for a while, then shook his head and said aloud.

He looked at An Qi and Qian Lin and they both shook their heads, as if they had never heard of it.

“You guys be careful, I’ll deal with the Raging Flame Lion first.”

As Lin Xiu finished speaking, this time, Lin Xiu ran over there without looking back.

Lin Xiu’s speed was very fast and in the next moment, he appeared in front of the Raging Flame Lions.

“Damn beast!!!”

A warrior with a lot of blood on his body roared furiously at this time and at the next moment, holding the weapon in his hand, he was going to attack the body of the Raging Flame Lion.

boom–

But at the next moment, the man was directly slapped down by the giant claws of the Raging Flame Lion.

He was directly turned into meat sauce.

A large number of warriors have died and the Raging Flame Lion seems to have reached the end of the force.

Although a more terrifying attack broke out, but Lin Xiu believed that its power will be insufficient soon.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, then clicked on the item in the system and the mask from the lottery appeared in Lin Xiu’s hands.

This is a new system function that Lin Xiu discovered.

The items obtained from the lottery can be saved and taken out when needed.

After putting on this mask, Lin Xiu watched the battle ahead from a distance, waiting for the opportunity.

Roar–

As another round of new skills charged towards the body of the Raging Flame Lion, the Raging Flame Lion suddenly let out a huge roar.

In the next moment, it opened its mouth wide and an extremely terrifying flame spurted out of its mouth!

Now is the time!

When all those warriors were avoiding the terrifying flames, Lin Xiu had already burst out with force on his legs, charging towards the Raging Flame Lion!

The Raging Flame Lion clearly saw Lin Xiu attacking and the flames spewed out of its mouth, spraying directly at Lin Xiu!

The surrounding warriors have already unfolded their ‘Sphere’ to resist, but there are still many warriors who are directly burned into black coal.
