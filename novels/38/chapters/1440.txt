“Tool spirit…”

Lin Xiu mumbled under his breath.

What was this that the God King wanted so badly?

“What’s the use of a tool spirit?”

Luo Yue felt curious as well.

!!

“I don’t know. I only heard that there used to be a warrior who was beyond all God Kings and was terrifying. He had a godly weapon with him and in that, there was a tool spirit.

“Due to some reasons, the weapon was destroyed and only the tool spirit was left behind.

“Right here at the Dark Planet.”

Luo Huatian then told them everything that he knew.

“So this means that the tool spirit is something incredibly powerful.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head as well.

With his current abilities, even if he used all of the skills that he had in his system, he still wouldn’t be able to defeat the God Kings.

Plus, Ling Tianxi even had control over the waters that were a weakness to his flames.

As he got reminded of it, he felt troubled.

Even his Netherworld’s Flames were no match for it.

If the flames couldn’t get close to them, he would not be able to instill the pain of burning their souls.

“Bring me there then. The ruins that they’ve been talking about.”

Lin Xiu then asked for Luo Huatian to lead the way.

If the rumors were true, would he be able to absorb this tool spirit into his Dark Edge?

Afterall, he had a god-level weapon now.

“Sure. Over here.”

Luo Huatian nodded his head.

With his guidance, Luo Huatian, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue all flew in the other direction.

This was different from an ordinary one.

The waters in the river were as black as ink.

“This is the Black River of the Dark Planet.”

Luo Huatian then slowly descended onto the ground, near the river banks.

Lin Xiu was a little surprised.

It was the first time that he had seen waters that were so black.

Plus, Lin Xiu could obviously feel that there was an intense amount of dark energy inside the river.

“Those from the Warrior God Realm, even if they were warrior gods or the God King himself, none of them have dared to go inside this river.

“This is because once they dive in, they completely lose vision and the dark energy inside has a rotting effect.

“They never thought of how the ruins would be beneath this place.”

Luo Huatian sneered as he told the other two about it.

Even when he knew about it, he would never tell them about it.

“Well…. How do we get down there?”

Lin Xiu was curious.

If they simply jumped into it, Lin Xiu didn’t think it would be a good idea.

They might even end up dead.

This Black River seems oddly terrifying.

“Even if you have control over the dark energy, you can’t just dive right in unless your body has been filled with enough dark energy.

“Come, let me do it.”

Luo Huatian walked out and raised his hands.

Then, he started chanting.

He was speaking some weird language that Lin Xiu did not understand.

But, Lin Xiu did feel that someone was different.

There was something happening to the waters in the river.

Splash – –

With the odd sound that they heard, the water in the river split into two halves!

There was a path that appeared in the middle of the river.

Upon seeing this, even Luo Yue, who was usually unaffected, looked a little surprised as well.

She specializes in controlling water but now, her powers were useless against this Black River.

“Previously, I inherited the powers of my master.”

Luo Huatian started explaining himself.

His master was the reason why he came to the Dark Planet.

“Your master…”

“He was killed.” Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“He was killed by those from the Tianshen Pavillion.”

With that, Luo Huatian clenched his first and his eyes were filled with hatred.

He took a deep breath and finally calmed himself as he spoke to them, “Let’s go! Let’s see what’s inside.”

Luo Huatian led the way. Lin Xiu and Luo Yue looked at each other before following the man.

The skills that Luo Huatian had shown earlier were peculiar. He was able to split the river into two!

As they walked on the ground, Lin Xiu noticed that they were not soil but only large pieces of rocks.

Soon, they arrived at an empty ground in the center.

When they took a closer look, there was indeed a huge gate!

As Lin Xiu looked at the huge door beneath his feet, Lin Xiu was shocked.

“So, this is the ruins?”

“I’m not sure as well but there is a possibility that it’s here.”

Hua Luotian shook his head.

“The Black River has a long history and no one knew when it first appeared.

“None of them from the Dark Planet dared come close to this place.

“My master is one of the elders who inherited this secret skill.

“This is the most mysterious place on the planet and it is highly likely that the ruins are here.”

After hearing so, Lin Xiu stomped on the gate beneath them and there was a deep groan that followed.

However, the stone gates did not budge.

The stone gates looked normal and there was nothing special about it.

There wasn’t even a mark seen on it.

“But…. how do we open it then?”

Lin Xiu bent down to get a closer look.

He still couldn’t find a way to open it.

“I don’t know either. I only know that the ruins might be behind it.”

Luo Huatian shook his head.

Lin Xiu continued checking the gates and then released the energy from inside his body.

Open!

He placed all of the energy on his fist and slammed it against the stone gate!

Boom – –

Followed by a loud thus, the stone gate trembled.

But, that was all. It still remained shut.

“That’s….impossible…”

Lin Xiu was shocked.

His punch didn’t even cause a crack on it.

Luo Yue hesitated for a while and stabbed it with her long sword.

However, still nothing happened to the stone gate.

The huge gate seemed to have been made of a special material!

“If none of you can open it, there must be something great hidden behind it!”

Luo Huatian felt excited.

Neither Lin Xiu or Luo Yue could break the door.

It was indeed peculiar.

Would the Analytic Eye be able to show them something?

Lin Xiu quickly thought about his system.

Then, with the help of the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu noticed that the entire gate was covered with smooth-threads.

This…

This was the first time that Lin Xiu had encountered such things and he was stunned.

These smooth-threads were like lines on the gates.

This was strange.

Lin Xiu then subconsciously placed his hand on the stone gate.

He could then clearly feel that there were bumps on the gate that looked smooth!
