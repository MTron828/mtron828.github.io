Chapter 471: Black Rock City-Thunder Valley

“Do you know about the World Warrior Competition?” Dean Baili looked at Lin Xiu at this time and said with interest.

World Warrior Competition!?

Hearing these words, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted.

Lin Xiu knew about this warrior competition, or rather, anyone who is a warrior would know about it.

This was the most famous warrior competition in the world. It is held every five years and was said that the top ten could get the opportunity to experience training on another planet.

The energy on the earth is limited, even if one’s ‘Cultivation Technique’ was very strong, one wouldn’t be able to absorb a lot of energy.

And if a warrior wants to become stronger, he or she can only go to other planets to practice.

But not everyone could go. The cost of taking the spacecraft alone was already quite steep and those planets with plenty of energy have long been occupied by big forces and they were not allowed there.

Only some rich people could go to some asteroids for vacation.

But the winner of the warrior competition is qualified to go to planets with extremely high energy density.

“Of course.” After Lin Xiu returned to his senses, he nodded to Dean Baili.

“This time, in addition to the individual competition, there will be an academy competition.” Dean Baili nodded, then looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“Academy competition!?”

“Yes, five members from each academy. By then, you must come back. I have already decided. You and Luo Yue are both candidates for the competition.” Dean Baili said. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

World Warrior Competition…

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but feel a little excited. This competition was undoubtedly what all warriors yearn for.

But at the same time, the warriors who could participate in this competition were not ordinary warriors.

After all, they were warriors gathered from all over the world.

“However, with our current strength, I’m afraid we’re not going to win?” Although he didn’t want to admit it, Lin Xiu sighed helplessly.

“No, next month is just an audition. After all, the Warrior Competition is held every five years, and there are many participants.”

“The real competition is probably next year.”

Dean Baili touched his beard, then smiled and said.

“Well…that’s OK, I’ll be back.” Lin Xiu thought for a while, then nodded.

“If there is nothing else, I will leave first.”

Lin Xiu left here as soon as he finished speaking.

On the way back, Lin Xiu took out his mobile phone and logged in to the communication software that he hadn’t used for a long time.

He looked at it; the previous teacher, a few classmates, and Ye Shuang’er had all sent messages to him.

But at this time, they don’t seem to be online.

“Is it because of the accident over there that even the Internet was affected?” Thinking of this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frown.

Lin Xiu returned to the villa and continued to practice his new diamond skill- ‘Thousand thunder’ with his Dark Edge spear.

Crackling——

With the use of skills, the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand was covered by a large amount of lightning, and it made a strange sound.

Even the surrounding air seemed to have a scorched smell.

It was clear that if one was stabbed by Lin Xiu’s spear, he or she would be completely charred by electricity.

“No, the power is still not strong enough.” After practicing for a while, Lin Xiu muttered to himself a little breathlessly.

Although his source strength could be transformed into lightning, the power of this lightning was still insufficient.

It was sufficient to deal with ordinary warriors, but those high-rank warriors had a certain ability to resist electric shock.

At this time, the current did not appear to be that strong.

Damn it!

“Go to another place for training.” At this moment, a sound came from the other side.

Hearing this voice, Lin Xiu was taken aback, then subconsciously turned around and looked behind him, and saw Luo Yue.

“What?”

“Black Rock City, where the Thunder Valley has the most terrifying current in the world, if you want to train your body’s thunder and lightning ability, you have to go there to train.” Luo Yue said indifferently.

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue, a little surprised at this time. It was the first time that he saw Luo Yue say such a long sentence.

“You seem to have changed.” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue and then said blankly.

Although her expression was still the same, Lin Xiu clearly felt that from the first time he knew Luo Yue to now, it seemed that Luo Yue has really changed a lot.

“I don’t know.” Luo Yue said blankly.

Lin Xiu was a little helpless seeing Luo Yue’s expression.

“I am going back to Xing Yao City tomorrow, are you going?” Lin Xiu thought for a while, and then told Luo Yue of his plan.

“Alright.”

“I’ll take you to the Thunder Valley on the way.” Luo Yue nodded and said faintly.

“Your current strength is still too weak.”

Lin Xiu, “…”

Lin Xiu sighed helplessly. Although he didn’t want to admit it, his strength was still quite weak now. Luo Yue was already rank 7 and he was still rank 6. If he didn’t use the ‘Fury’ skill, his strength was really not good.

Thunder Valley…

Time went by and it was the next day. That morning, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue arrived at the gate of the academy.

Many workers were standing on the coast, seeming to be preparing to take down a large number of machines from the bottom of the sea for repair work.

“So early?” Dean Baili was standing on the shore and talking to the staff. He turned around and looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue who came by.

He glanced at them, touched his beard, and exclaimed, “You guys looked like a married couple ah…”

Luo Yue and Lin Xiu were dressed in white which looked like a couple’s outfit.

Swish——

Just when Dean Baili finished speaking, he saw a flash of cold light.

Boom–

But he reacted very quickly. As soon as he moved his right hand, he caught a dagger between his fingers.

“Hey, this is murdering the Dean.” Dean Baili looked at Luo Yue and said aloud.

“You talk a lot of nonsense.” Luo Yue said coldly while looking at Dean Baili.

“Ahem, Luo Yue, we have to respect the elderly…” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue, then coughed, and said sternly.

“Humph.”

“I am not an old man!” Upon hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Dean Baili blew his beard and stared.

Boom boom——

Soon, a strong wind greeted the surrounding area. Looking up, a mini aircraft landed.

“The five cities near the E99 area are all flooded now.”

“But we can still send you to Xing Yao City. Then, it’s up to you guys.”
