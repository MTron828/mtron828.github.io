Chapter 554: Absorbing Energy from the Rank 8 Odd Crystals

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu looked up to the sky. It was cloudy but he could still vaguely see a black figure that was flying towards him.

When Lin Xiu realised what it was, the look in his eyes changed. As he was reminded about how those from the Royal Beast Sect had the abilities to easily control these evolved beasts, it was possible that the rank 8 warrior was riding on that flying evolved beast that was headed in his direction!

As he had expected, he saw the evolved beast that spread its wings and there was a human standing on top of it!

Lin Xiu widened his eyes in surprise. He didn’t have much time to react and quickly jumped back into the river!

“Run?!”

The rank 8 warrior from the Royal Beast Sect obviously saw Lin Xiu and immediately jumped off the flying evolved beast that he had been riding.

The place that he landed was the exact spot that Lin Xiu was standing at just seconds ago.

However, Lin Xiu had already dived into the waters!

The young man got angry and his eyes were filled with a fierce, murderous look. He must kill Lin Xiu!

“Did you think that I wouldn’t be able to do anything to you just because you jumped into the river?!”

As for Lin Xiu, who was inside the river, he started swimming frantically.

Although he was deep inside the waters, his actions were similar to when he was on land.

For him, even when he was underwater, he didn’t have a problem with breathing since he could breath with his skin.

After swimming for some time, Lin Xiu hid under a rock that he found at the bed of the river.

This was a shady spot and no one would be able to find him.

That young man might be a rank 8 warrior but it was impossible for him to stay underwater for as long as Lin Xiu could.

Therefore, even when the rank 8 warrior was close behind him, Lin Xiu wasn’t worried at all.

The only thing that he wanted to do now was to absorb all the energy from the odd crystals so that he could increase his ranking.

Lin Xiu, who was hiding behind a rock, quickly reached into his pocket and took out the two rank 8 odd crystals that he had from earlier.

He got one of them from killing the rank 8 green snake and the second odd crystal was given to him by someone from the Sacred Region Academy.

Both the odd crystals had a large amount of energy and in comparison, the one from the green snake was much more powerful than the second one. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

But, Lin Xiu had decided to absorb the both of them together!

As he thought of the trouble that he was in and how he might be heading towards Sky City very soon, Lin Xiu had no other choice. He clenched onto his teeth and grabbed onto both the odd crystals.

For the others, in order to absorb the energy from these high rank crystals, he would have to palace them inside his body for him to absorb the most of its energy but this wouldn’t be necessary for him since he had the skill – ‘Engulf’. He would be able to absorb the energy from these crystals even without swallowing the crystals.

Without thinking much, he activated the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

With the help from the skill, a large surge of energy came from both the crystals and they were slowly transferred into Lin Xiu’s body through his hands.

The energy from these rank 8 crystals were incredibly horrifying. Lin Xiu could feel that every single cell in his body was now scorching hot.

The water around him was really cold but his body was burning.

If he had the choice, Lin Xiu should have absorbed these crystals one at a time but now, Lin Xiu did not have the time for him to do so.

Both the crystals were being absorbed at a really fast speed which was why all the cells in his body were being filled up by a large amount of energy. There was so much of it that the cells in his body were about to explode.

With the help of the ‘Cultivation Technique’ and the ‘Engulf’, the speed at which he was absorbing the energies from the crystals were at its peak!

Some of the fishes seemed to have found Lin xiu who was hidden in the corner. As they tried to get close to him, they could feel that the water around him was turning hot and they would quickly swim away.

Lin Xiu closed his eyes and at that moment, he had completely entered into his cultivation zone!

As for the rank 8 warrior, he entered the water as well.

There was a pale purple ‘Yuan’ that was enveloped around his body. The fishes that accidentally came into contact with his ‘Yuan’ died as soon as they touched it.

The rank 8 warrior had a ferocious look in his eyes as he moved around the waters, hunting for Lin Xiu who was hiding under the water.

The river in the water was different from the others. It was much more dense and it made it even more difficult for him to swim in it.

Plus, the bed of this river was dark in colour as it was filled with lots of weird looking rocks which made it even more difficult for him to find Lin Xiu.

Damn it!

After hunting for a short while, he could no longer stand it even when he was a rank 8 warrior. He quickly went up to the surface and jumped back onto the small piece of land that he was at earlier.

“Damn it! I don’t believe that you can stay in there for that long!” He was sure that Lin Xiu wasn’t dead but he didn’t know where Lin Xiu was hiding.

He believed that Lin Xiu would definitely show himself very soon, even if Lin Xiu was good at holding his breath, he would still have to come up for air. Otherwise, he would die from suffocation!

Lin Xiu, on the other hand, was completely in his zone and had forgotten what was happening around him.

His entire body was giving up a bright red glow as the energy moved around his body.

He may be in the cultivation zone but Lin Xiu could still clearly feel the sharp pain that was all over his body.

Even the cut that the rank 8 warrior caused earlier. He had already stopped the bleeding earlier but now, it felt as if it was slowly tearing apart.

Not only that, he could also feel that there were pale stretch marks all over his body.

Fresh blood slowly started sipping through his body and it attracted a lot of evolved beasts that soon surrounded Lin Xiu.

However, the scorching hot water that surrounded Lin xiu immediately caused them to quickly swim away.

With the ‘Engulf’ still being activated and with Lin Xiu’s ‘Cultivating technique’, his EXP bar on the system was madly increasing.

“He’s not out yet?!” The man by the shore was getting impatient as he frowned.

There were a few of the flying evolved beasts that were flying around in the air as if they were being commanded by the young man.

“I don’t believe that you would be able to be in there any longer!” The young man snorted and decided to sit on the ground, by the shore with his eyes locked on the surface of the river.

Time passed by quickly and soon, the sky started to turn dark as well.

Lin Xiu was still underwater and he felt as if his body was being stretched in every direction. His body was extremely bloated and his skin was being torn into a horrible state.

But, the wounds that Lin Xiu had earlier were recovering so quickly that it could be seen by the naked eyes.

As for his bloated body, it was slowly recovering into its original state.

By taking a closer look, Lin Xiu had already let go of one of the rank 8 crystals that he had in his palms.

The crystal slowly fell onto the ground.

The crystal that used to be transparent had suddenly turned dull as if there was no energy left in it.

“Ding!”

At that moment, there was a bright sound that rang in Lin Xiu’s mind!
