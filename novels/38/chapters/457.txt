Chapter 458: Rank 6 Whitefin Fish

Fortunately, Lin Xiu was protected by a hood and he couldn’t smell the unpleasant smell of blood.

Now the entire ocean floor was extremely turbulent as if there was a tornado in the ocean.

Damn it!

Lin Xiu grabbed the seamount next to him and didn’t let his body rush to other places along with the violent surging current.

Oh right, that artificial intelligence robot…

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something at this time. He looked to the front and found that the robot seemed to have disappeared but on the ground over there, there was an energy body emitting golden light.

Seeing this scene, the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed, then he swam over there directly.

But the current was so rapid that Lin Xiu’s body seemed to be out of control. As soon as he let go of the seamount, he immediately followed the current to the other side.

Boom–

And directly hit the seamount behind.

The intense pain made Lin Xiu’s eyes widen.

Damn… it hurts.

And when Lin Xiu was about to move, he found that his body seemed to be entangled by something else. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

What is this!?

The look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed and he looked at his hands and he could clearly see his hands were entangled by something like seaweed!

And it wasn’t just his hands. Soon, a large amount of this weird seaweed wrapped around Lin Xiu’s body.

“Mutated seaweed, because of virus infection, it possesses certain intelligence. It’s corrosive and aggressive.”

Lin Xiu’s ‘Analytic Eye’ was instinctively activated and he saw the information provided.

Corrosive!?

Taking a closer look, as he was entangled by these seaweeds, Lin Xiu could see his diving suit in detail and it was starting to corrupt!

Oh no!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank abruptly and he tried to break free but the seaweed was too strong and his strength was limited in the sea.

He couldn’t get rid of them at all!

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth, then with a thought, he gathered all the power from his whole body!

Boom——

On Lin Xiu’s body, a fiery red flame burst out instantly!

Red Lotus Fire!

Even in the sea, these flames seemed to be able to burst out and at this moment, because of the effect of the flame, these seaweeds were burnt and Lin Xiu broke free in an instant.

Although the red lotus fire was terrifying, it didn’t last long in the water.

Of course, it couldn’t be used to deal with other evolved beasts, but as for these seaweeds, it worked.

At this time, Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief as he looked at the seaweeds around him that were burnt. He found that there was something shiny on the ocean floor.

When Lin Xiu wanted to squat down and take a look, he felt that his skin had a cold sensation.

He took a closer look. Although Lin Xiu’s diving suit has just been freed from the entanglement of the seaweed, they had corroded a large part of it and his arm was exposed.

Damn it!

When Lin Xiu noticed this, his expression became ugly. If the diving suit was broken, he couldn’t stay for too long.

But the robot and the energy body have not been found yet, Lin Xiu was still a bit unwilling to leave.

Gurgle gurgle——

Just when Lin Xiu was deep in thoughts, a white figure suddenly appeared from the side.

Lin Xiu saw this from the corner of his eyes and he turned around. Then he saw a huge figure rushing towards him!

What is this!?

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and before he had time to react, this thing had already crashed into Lin Xiu.

Boom–

With a loud noise, Lin Xiu hit the seamount behind him and a lot of rocks fell down.

Lin Xiu also felt severe pain in his chest and back.

When he looked to the front, he could clearly see that it was a huge white fish.

“Rank 6 whitefin fish – its body can emit white light, attract the attention of other creatures and swallow them. It is extremely aggressive.”

Rank 6 evolved beast…

Seeing that it wanted to crash into his body again, the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed, then he turned around abruptly and dodged.

Boom–

The whitefin fish directly hit the seamount behind, making a loud noise before falling down along with a lot of broken rocks.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate to dodge its attack. He took the sharp dagger out of the scabbard fixed to his side, swam over, and was about to stab the whitefin fish directly!

The whitefin fish’s response speed was not so fast and Lin Xiu’s knife was directly inserted into its back!

It seemed to feel the sharp pain from his back and its body began to struggle violently.

Lin Xiu let out a cold snort and grabbed its white fins with his left hand. Then, he sat on top of it, and with a sudden force, the dagger made a long and deep cut down its back. A lot of red blood flowed out of the mouth.

Boom–

Just when Lin Xiu wanted to get rid of it in one fell swoop, he was slammed by its tail and his entire being was flung out.

He hit the seamount nearby and the dagger in his hand fell on the ocean floor.

Damn it!

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and looked at the front only to see the whitefin fish struggling crazily due to the intense pain.

And when it saw Lin Xiu, it seemed to become crazier and directly rushed towards him!

Go to hell!

Seeing that it still wanted to rush towards him, Lin Xiu was also angered, his right hand clenched into a fist, a large amount of lightning burst out of his fist, then directly attacked the whitefin fish that came over!

‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’!!!

Boom——

Lin Xiu’s fist covered in the electric current hit the head of this whitefin fish!

At this moment, the body of the whitefin fish was torn apart.

Huhu——

After Lin Xiu finished all this, his body suddenly felt tired and he was panting a little.
