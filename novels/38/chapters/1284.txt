1285 Sun Tian

Most of them were warrior gods.

They were also some who were quite powerful.

His analytic eye also showed him that there were a few who were stronger than him.

This was something that excited him.

Only powerful and strong warriors were worth fighting.

“Let’s head over there.”

After looking around, the place was huge and there were still ample empty spaces that weren’t occupied.

“En.”

Baili Haoling and Lei Chong nodded their heads in agreement.

Lei Chong was still having difficulty walking earlier but now, he was already able to slowly move.

However, he couldn’t do it quickly and could only move one step at a time.

The additional gravity that they were feeling did have an impact on them.

Baili Haoling also took a deep breath and followed behind Lin Xiu.

Boom – –

Lin Xiu then placed the special wooden box that felt the Hao Yue Spear on the ground.

They had just bought this spear and he didn’t have the time to use it before this. This training ground gave an opportunity for Lin Xiu to do so.

“Lei Chong, start practicing on the ‘Cultivation Technique’ and get use to the gravity here.”

Lin Xiu gave his instructions to Lei Chong.

Lei Chong nodded his head. He noticed that there was a screen before them that states ’50’ which would have meant the gravity instill in this floor.

Plus, they were able to freely control it as they pleased.

Baili Haoling then pulled out her dagger and started moving them swiftly in the air.

It must definitely be beneficial to be able to train under such pressure.

Plus, the training ground was different from the others. The density of the air in here was thick as if there was some energy coming from the ventilation. They were able to gather the energy in the air to help with their cultivation.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but think that this hotel must have spent a bomb to be able to do so.

As he held the spear in his hands, Lin Xiu could feel that the spear was now much heavier due to the additional gravity around them.

Lin Xiu felt that it was a little difficult for him to even hold it in his hands.

“But….it feels good.”

Although it was heavy, Lin Xiu was still happy with it.

The weapon has to be heavy enough for him to comfortably use it.

With the help of ‘Rage’, he could no longer feel the weight of the spear.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Lin Xiu started spinning the spear that was in the air.

There were also multiple explosions that happened at the same time.

It has been a long time since he got to use a spear and Lin Xiu was getting more comfortable with it.

When the rest of the room heard the explosions, all of them turned and looked at Lin Xiu.

Especially for those who mocked him earlier. Seeing how he was able to move the spear so swiftly, all of them were stunned.

They had mocked him, thinking that they were weak warriors.

Now, as they got to see him move with the spear, they knew that Lin Xiu definitely wasn’t someone weak.

“Zhao Lin, that man has got skills.”

The man with an unfriendly look in his eyes stared at Lin Xiu while he told this to another warrior next to him.

“He’s alright but from the looks of it, he’s not our match.”

The man, who was slightly muscular, spoke instead and he sounded confident.

From what they could see, Lin Xiu had good spear techniques but they didn’t feel any strength coming from him.

The loud explosions that they heard were mainly just for show.

“I would like to know where he came from.”

The man spoke in a cold tone.

When he was mocking them earlier, Lin Xiu glared at him as warning and had completely ignored them when Lin Xiu walked passed. This was in fact a call for a challenge.

“Sun Tian, just let it go.”

Zhao Lin thought about it and tried to warn Sun Tian. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They were here to make preparations for the contest tomorrow. There was indeed no need for them to do such things tonight.

“It’s obvious that they’ve come from a small town. I would like to know how powerful they could get.”

Sun Tian completely disregarded what Zhao Lin was saying and couldn’t wait to teach Lin Xiu a lesson.

Lin Xiu was still swinging his spear around, trying to be familiar with it.

It hadn’t found anything that was suitable earlier and had been using his fist technique. He was a little rusty in his spear technique.

...

However, the moment he picked up the spear, he immediately got into the zone.

Boom – –

However, when Lin Xiu thrusted his spear forward, there was a figure that suddenly stood in front of him.

The other party seemed to have got hold of his spear as well.

“Hmm?”

Lin Xiu frowned when he saw that the other man had caught the other end of his spear.

Due to how Lin Xiu was only practicing on his own, he did not put in much strength and it was normal for others to be able to hold onto it.

However, this was the man who mocked them previously.

Baili Haoling paused as well and looked at what these people were up to.

Lei Chong had his eyes closed while cultivating and it was normal that he didn’t see this happening.

“What do you want?”

...

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he stared at Sun Tian.

“Young man, you’re good but you’re weak.”

Sun Tian sneered as he spoke to Lin Xiu.

“Which little town are you from?”

His tone was filled with arrogance as if he wouldn’t accept anyone rejecting to answer his question.

“Move.”

Lin Xiu had a cold smile on his face.

Sun Tian, on the other hand, was shocked. Did this brat just ask him to move?

“You…”

“Which little town did you come from? How did you get qualified? How dare you act so boldly?!”

Sun Tian turned furious and grabbed onto Lin Xiu’s arms. He wanted to take the spear away from him.

However, as he tried to thug onto it, he realised that the couldn’t move the spear!

Boom – –

Then, there was a dark blue flame that covered the entire spear.

When the flame appeared, it caught everyone’s attention.

HellFire was something of a high temperature. Those who were cultivating inside the room could feel it as well.

“Ahhhhhh!”

Sun Tian was still holding onto it when he felt the intense pain and let out a loud cry.

He instantly let go of the spear.

When he took a few steps back and stared at his palm, he noticed that they had turned black.

He was a warrior god!!! He had a tough body. How did such a flame harm him to such an extent?!

“You!!! You asked for it!!”

Sun Tian stared at Lin Xiu with an evil look in his eyes.
