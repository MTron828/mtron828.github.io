Chapter 881: Taking the Holy Level Skill Card

“Go this way!”

Zhao Xiaoqing walked in front of Lin Xiu at this time, then pointed to the way ahead and said.

Seeing her walking in front, Lin Xiu didn’t say much.

Is there really a holy-level skill card?

Lin Xiu was still a little unconvinced.

But no matter what, he’d better go to Aoshuang City first.

Zhao Xiaoqing walked forward while touching the wound on her neck.

The wound is not deep and thanks to her powerful healing ability, the bleeding has now stopped.

It’s just a little pain when touched.

Out of the corner of his eye, she looked behind him.

She saw that Lin Xiu was still strolling leisurely.

Zhao Xiaoqing could not help stamping her feet secretly, then walked a few steps faster.

Lin Xiu didn’t say a word along the way, just followed her footsteps. After about two or three hours, Lin Xiu saw a huge city in the distance.

The buildings of the whole city look white and translucent.

Looking at it from a distance, it seems like a city covered with snow and ice.

“This is Aoshuang City?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly and said.

“That’s right.”

Zhao Xiaoqing nodded.

After arriving at Aoshuang City, Zhao Xiaoqing was also obviously relieved.

How many things happened before, it really made her a little scared.

“Walk.”

Lin Xiu said lightly, carrying his Dark Edge spear on his back and walked directly inside.

The previous area was still quite hot, but after coming here, Lin Xiu felt that the temperature had dropped significantly.

As he got closer, he found that the surrounding ground was covered with frost.

Zhao Xiaoqing also seemed to feel the cold at this time and hurriedly pressed a button on her battle uniform.

Dididi-

With a strange sound, the heating device of the battle suit was activated.

Zhao Xiaoqing, who was shivering a little from the cold, suddenly felt a burst of warmth.

He looked at Lin Xiu and found that Lin Xiu was wearing very thin clothes and he was not wearing a battle uniform, but he seemed to be not afraid of the cold.

“Aren’t you afraid of the cold?”

Zhao Xiaoqing couldn’t help saying at this moment.

The temperature of this Aoshuang City is freezing to the bone. Even high-level warriors will feel uncomfortable if they stay in this place all the time.

But what is puzzling is that Lin Xiu seems to have nothing at all.

Even a warrior of the King warrior level can’t ignore the temperature changes so much, right?

Lin Xiu glanced at her, then said lightly, “Go, get me the skill card.”

“Humph!”

At this time, Zhao Xiaoqing gave Lin Xiu a fierce look.

Then quickly walked to the front.

At the gate of Aoshuang City, there are several warriors guarding it.

“Hello, Miss Zhao.”

These guards seemed to know Zhao Xiaoqing and respectfully said to Zhao Xiaoqing.

“En.”

Zhao Xiaoqing nodded slightly, then gestured to Lin Xiu with his eyes.

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate and went in directly.

“It seems that you still have some status in this Aoshuang City.”

Lin Xiu said lightly as he walked in.

“Of course, I’m from the Zhao family!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Zhao Xiaoqing said with great pride.

“Alright, skill Card.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Zhao Xiaoqing, who was so proud at first, glared at Lin Xiu as if she was a cat who had been trampled on the tail.

After entering this Aoshuang City, Lin Xiu was still a little emotional.

This Aoshuang City is completely different from Earth, both in terms of architectural scale and architectural styles.

The things here seem to be several levels higher than the technology on Earth, no, the technology on the Marqi planet.

There seems to be a special electronic teleportation array not far away and there are few vehicles.

Many warriors have come out of those fixed electronic teleportation arrays.

This kind of thing seems to replace the traditional means of transportation.

“You haven’t even seen the teleportation array, have you?”

Zhao Xiaoqing looked at Lin Xiu staring over there and suddenly said out of curiosity.

“skill card.”

“Can you stop saying the word ‘skill card’ all the time?”

Zhao Xiaoqing’s cheeks were bulging with anger.

Why does this person keep staring at the skill card!

“You don’t have it, right?”

Lin Xiu looked at her and said aloud.

“Of...of course I do!”

Zhao Xiaoqing said with little confidence.

“Let me tell you, if you can’t get a holy-level skill card out, then you know the consequences.”

Lin Xiu glanced at Zhao Xiaoqing, then said lightly.

After being glanced at by Lin Xiu’s eyes, Zhao Xiaoqing suddenly felt a chill.

It made her back feel cold and she couldn’t help shivering.

“I... I’ll give it to you.”

Zhao Xiaoqing said with a trembling voice.

This man’s eyes are so terrifying!

He followed Zhao Xiaoqing all the way to the front. On the street, there were many people looking at them.

There is nothing special about Lin Xiu. It is probably because of Zhao Xiaoqing that these people are curious about Lin Xiu’s origin.

“Yo, Zhao Xiaoqing, why, have you hooked up with a man?”

Just at the corner in front, there was a man in luxurious clothes standing there, blocking Lin Xiu and Zhao Xiaoqing’s way.

“Yan Kuan?”

Zhao Xiaoqing looked at him, frowning slightly.

There seemed to be a hint of disgust in her eyes.

“It turns out you have quite the appetite huh?” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“You prefer pretty young boys?”

Yan Kuan said with a bad expression on his face.

He has been pursuing Zhao Xiaoqing, but Zhao Xiaoqing ignored him.

Today, Zhao Xiaoqing openly walked on the street with a handsome man, which made Yan Kuan feel that he had lost face.

And that man is obviously not a member of any big family in Aoshuang City.

Like an ordinary person who looks a little more handsome.

“Scram.”

Zhao Xiaoqing stared at Yan Kuan and shouted coldly with a gloomy face.

“Humph!”

Yan Kuan’s gloomy eyes glanced at Lin Xiu and Zhao Xiaoqing, then walked directly to the other side.

“Just a self-righteous person, don’t pay attention to him.”

Zhao Xiaoqing watched Yan Kuan leave and spoke to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu spread out his hands and said it didn’t matter.

“The holy-level skill card is in my clan, do you really want to get it?”

When Zhao Xiaoqing was walking, she suddenly stopped, then looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

There was a hint of craftiness in her eyes.

“certainly.”

Lin Xiu said with an expressionless expression.

From the moment he came in, Lin Xiu began to look at the strength of the warriors around him. He sensed it carefully and found that the warriors around him had the lowest level of strength of a master warrior.

The overall strength of a warrior is indeed much stronger than on Earth.

“Just up ahead.”
