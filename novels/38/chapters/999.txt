Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

At this moment, his ‘Sphere’ was directly pierced by the spear of this artificial angel!

pfft—

A mouthful of blood spat out from his mouth.

Like a kite with a broken string, his body flew straight out.

“Big brother!”

When Gao Lin and Gao Qiang saw this scene, the expressions on their faces changed greatly.

It was clear just now that this artificial angel couldn’t move, why, at this moment, she was able to move again!?

boom boom boom —

And just as Gao Cong’s body slammed into the ground, the artificial angel’s body also slowly stood up from the state where she was half-knelt on the ground.

“Phew, it feels good to sneak an attack on me, right?”

Just as Gao Lin and Gao Qiang flew down to help Gao Cong up, Lin Xiu’s voice came over.

Taking a closer look, Lin Xiu was standing on the shoulders of this artificial angel and he had recovered from that state of deep sleep.

The artificial angel let Lin Xiu stand on her shoulder and did not attack Lin Xiu.

This miraculous scene made Ji Mei on the other side very surprised.

This… what the hell happened?

Lin Xiu looked at Gao Lin and the others below, his eyes narrowed slightly.

The Analytic Eye and Engulf skills had successfully deciphered the intelligent system of this artificial angel.

And directly devoured the energy protective layer inside her.

Now the original controller in this intelligent system has been erased and Lin Xiu has become the controller of this artificial angel.

“Kill them.”

As soon as Lin Xiu’s words were spoken, the artificial angel attacked Gao Lin and the others!

At this moment, the artificial angel’s spear suddenly burst into dazzling white light.

Obviously, there was a lot of energy, rushing toward the spear in her hand.

Doomed!

Gao Lin and the others watched this scene and their eyes were filled with incomparable horror.

They did not expect that Lin Xiu, who seemed to have fallen into a deep sleep, suddenly came back to his senses.

What’s even more terrifying is that this artificial angel seems to be suddenly controlled by Lin Xiu!

The three Gao brothers looked at the artificial angel charging toward them and there was no way to dodge it.

At this time, they can only quickly unfold the ‘Sphere’ and fight hard!

Boom boom—

The artificial angel seemed crazy at this time, madly waving the huge spear in her hand.

At this moment, the entire ground shook crazily.

Gao Lin and others’ “Sphere” could not resist the attack of this spear at all and soon, the “Sphere” exploded directly.

Their bodies were also instantly hit and turned into mud.

Just like that… they died?

Ji Mei watched this scene, her eyes widened slightly.

The three living warriors just died in front of her eyes so the impact on her was still very big.

“Eh? It looks like you’re fine.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu jumped off the shoulder of the artificial angel, looked at Ji Mei over there and said lightly.

Ji Mei looked at Lin Xiu in front of her, she was shocked and took a few steps back subconsciously.

“Don’t worry, I won’t kill you.”

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu spread his hands and said.

Just now, although he closed his eyes and entered the system to watch the progress bar, he could still clearly feel everything in the real world.

The three Gao brothers looked quite honest before, but he didn’t expect that at the last moment, they wanted to kill him.

But they may not know that their strength was far from Lin Xiu’s.

“This artificial angel… was controlled by you?”

Ji Mei hesitated for a while, but she still couldn’t help but speak out.

Because now after this artificial angel killed Gao Lin and the others, she stood still and seemed to be waiting for Lin Xiu’s order.

This scene was astonishing.

“You can put it that way.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

In the next moment, with Lin Xiu’s triggering of his thoughts, the artificial angel half-knelt on the ground.

Lin Xiu moved and flew in front of the artificial angel’s eyes. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Her eyes were like amethyst glaze and they looked extremely dazzling.

Taking out that special small box, Lin Xiu hesitated for a while, then reached out and touched one of her eyes.

In the next moment, with a dazzling light, a purple liquid flowed down from her eyes.

Lin Xiu held the small box and quickly filled the liquid into it.

Similarly, Lin Xiu touched her other pair of eyes.

The same purple liquid also flowed out.

This little box was soon filled.

At this time, if you look closely, you can clearly see the eyes of this artificial angel had dimmed a little.

Pa–

Lin Xiu closed the box. With a thought, the box instantly entered the expansion space.

“You brought me here. You will have a share of the reward.”

After doing all this, Lin Xiu’s body slowly landed on the ground and he looked at Ji Mei who was behind and said aloud.

Ji Mei’s face looked a little weird at this time.

It looks like she wants to say something.

“If you have anything to say, just say it.”

Seeing Ji Mei’s expression, Lin Xiu said lightly.

“You… can you share a little angel’s tears with me?”

“I don’t want the reward from Wu Hao, just a little angel’s tears will do.”

Ji Mei gritted her teeth, but still said everything she wanted to say.

“Just a little bit, Wu Hao won’t know.”

Ji Mei saw that Lin Xiu didn’t speak, thinking that Lin Xiu would not agree, but at this moment she still spoke out in a hurry.

“What do you want Angel’s Tears for?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

Ji Mei was startled, then she became a little sadder.

“I want to save my brother.”

“My brother has a strange disease and can’t get out of bed. I need a few of this angel’s tears as a primer to make that potion.”

Pa–

At the next moment, something seemed to be thrown toward him and Ji Mei subconsciously caught it.

“This…”

Taking a closer look, he could clearly see that what she had just caught was a small bottle of liquid.

The liquid inside was purple and seemed to emit a faint glow.

Angel’s Tears!

“Okay, goodbye.”

Lin Xiu smiled, then sat on the shoulder of the artificial angel.

boom boom boom —

In the next moment, the artificial angel fanned its six wings and a strong wind surged.

Flying straight into the air!

The building above was directly broken open by this artificial angel.

The dazzling light shone in instantly, causing Ji Mei to squint.

When she opened her eyes again, Lin Xiu and the artificial angel had disappeared.
