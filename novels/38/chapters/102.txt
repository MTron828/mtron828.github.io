Chapter 103: A Thousand Illusions!

The man in black at the front did not give Lin Xiu any time to think and immediately charged at Lin Xiu with his saber!

Lin Xiu scoffed and took a step forward as he placed the huge wooden box on the ground, then rushed over without any weapons!

The streets were spacious, but on this night, there were no pedestrians around, only the streetlights were still shining.

“Courting death!” Seeing Lin Xiu charging over recklessly, the man in black sneered.

He was a rank 3 warrior and a rank 1 warrior actually dared to rush over empty-handed – he was simply courting death.

But just as he sneered, he found that Lin Xiu was already in front of him!

How could he be so fast!?

The man’s gaze changed and when he hacked down with his saber, Lin Xiu had already appeared behind him!

How could it be!

He was about to resist when Lin Xiu’s fist came toward him!

After these few days of practice, Lin Xiu’s understanding of the source strength had improved drastically. At this moment, the source strength was wrapped around his fist, coupled with the gloves in his hand, his fist was harder than steel!

When Lin Xiu waved his fist out, it turned scarlet red and looked like a red circular light. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Bang––

This fist had hit the man’s back and with the amplification from ‘Tiger Strength Fist”, the power of this ‘Rupturing Fist’ increased drastically!

The man’s body was sent flying in an instant, and he rolled on the ground several times before he steadied himself.

Then, a mouthful of blood came out of his mouth.

Pain, there was an intense pain coming from his back!

It was like his bones were all broken!

Had it not been for the special skill that protected him, his back would have been broken by Lin Xiu!

His responsiveness, speed, and power were not what an ordinary warrior could possess!

But he clearly sensed that Lin Xiu wasn’t very strong ah!

Damn it! What kind of monster is he!

“Kill him!”

At this moment, the few warriors on the other side rushed to Lin Xiu, surrounding him and brandishing their sabers toward him at the same time!

Lin Xiu did not hide and allowed the saber to cut his body.

Clang––

As Lin Xiu was wearing a combat suit, the saber had no way of cutting his body!

Lin Xiu felt only a slight shock at this moment.

This suit is really good!

The money he spent didn’t go to waste!

That man was visibly stunned and appeared to be in disbelief.

But Lin Xiu did not give him any time to react, in the next second, he kicked his right foot directly against the man’s body and the man flew up!

When the man was coming down, Lin Xiu threw a hook with his right hand at that man in the air!

Lin Xiu used the strength from his whole body and a loud sound of bones breaking resounded. This rank 2 warrior’s lumbar vertebrae seemed to have exploded into pieces!

His whole body flew into the air again, then knocked the ground with a dull sound. He laid flat on the ground and was motionless.

Also, there was a lot of blood coming out from the seven apertures of his head!

“Ding~~~ Congratulations Master on killing a rank 2 warrior. You’ve gain 150,000 experience!”

Lin Xiu did not stop the movement of his hands as he grabbed left and right, accurately getting hold of the two warriors who were planning to slash him with their sabers.

Those two warriors turned pale with fright, but when they tried to break free, it was already too late.

Lin Xiu grabbed their wrists, his hands stretched out, and used the skill ‘Fire Claws’!

Tear——

With sparks bursting out of his fingertips, their arms were suddenly torn apart from their wrists by Lin Xiu’s ‘Fire Claws’!

There was a smell of meat being burnt.

“Ah!!!”

The intense pain made them wail non-stop.

Lin Xiu did not show any mercy and continued to attack them, crushing them completely!

He used ‘Serial Kick’ and sent them flying like a broken kite, and these two people fell directly into a ditch nearby.

Their bodies landed hard.

“Ding~~ Congratulations Master on killing a rank 2 warrior. You’ve gained 150,000 experience!”

“Ding~~ Congratulations Master on killing a rank 2 warrior. You’ve gained 150,000 experience!”

Two of the same prompts rang out, but they were merely rank 2 warriors and Lin Xiu did not care much about it.

With the intimidating power that just killed two rank 2 warriors, the other two rank 2 warriors on the other side didn’t dare to act recklessly.

There was fear in their eyes, after all, Lin Xiu just displayed such terrifying strength, he did not seem like a rank 1 warrior at all.

Impossible! How could he be so strong! Were we given the wrong information?

The rank 3 warrior at the back had a murderous intent in his eyes as he stared at Lin Xiu.

This person cannot stay, otherwise, he would bring more trouble to the Temple of Transformation!

With that thought, he took a deep breath, grabbed his saber, and rushed over to Lin Xiu!

Body skill- ‘Flashy’!

Lin Xiu ignored the two rank 2 warriors next to him and his attention was on that rank 3 warrior at the back.

This rank 3 warrior moved very quickly and was right in front of Lin Xiu in a brief moment!

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted and threw a punch without hesitation!

But when his fist hit the man’s body, it was as if he hit a layer of net and didn’t really pound against anything!

“Gold skill- ‘Thousand Illusions’!” Lin Xiu suddenly turned around and saw that the rank 3 warrior had jumped behind him.

He held the gold saber tightly in his hands and roared loudly.

Gold skill!?

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked straight at the man and his mind shook as the scene before him seemed to change.

There seemed to be about a dozen of that man in black and they surrounded him in a circle while slashing toward him with their sabers!

Each one was so real and there was no way to tell which was real!!
