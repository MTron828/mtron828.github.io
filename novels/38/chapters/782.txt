Chapter 783: Swagger Off

Those people looked at the flaming birds coming from the impact at this time and subconsciously unfolded the ‘Sphere’ for protection!

But what they didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu also charged over with those flame.

The spear in his hand, now because of the source strength, has instantly turned into amethyst glass.

It doesn’t look like a weapon, but like a perfect work of art.

bang bang bang-

‘Clean sweep’!

A skill attacked and instantly shattered the protective shields of the people in front of him.

Those flaming birds all slammed into their bodies in an instant.

boom boom boom —

The flames burned frantically, instantly turning the three master warrior-level warriors into burning men. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“What!!!”

A wailing scream came from their mouths.

Especially when their hands were blown apart just now and now the flames burned to their wounds, they let out a loud wailing sound.

The flames are really terrifying. Even if they are master warriors, they are directly hit by the flames without the protection of the ‘Sphere’. Even if their physical strength is strong, they can’t stand it.

bang bang bang-

And at this time, Lin Xiu held the spear in his hand and stabbed it over in an instant, directly killing the three warriors who were screaming and rolling on the ground.

At this time, the system in his head also showed a prompt of killing master warrior-level warriors and gaining experience.

However, after killing these three master warrior-level warriors, the experience only increased by 0.5%.

Upgrading is getting harder and harder.

boom boom boom —

At this moment, the entire cave began to vibrate slightly.

Some rocks fell down, as if the cave was about to collapse!

“Hurry up! Take away the high-level odd crystals first, the cave will collapse soon!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes changed, then he spoke directly to Liu Pan and the others.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, they also reacted quickly, ran directly to the mountain of odd crystals and began to put the odd crystals in their pockets.

“Fuck, there are too many Odd crystals, please don’t collapse...”

Liu Pan’s eyes lit up and he quickly put the rank 9 and 10 Odd crystals into his pocket.

And Lin Xiu didn’t stop his movements either.

Even though the rank 10 odd crystal is not very helpful to him now, quantitative change causes qualitative change so yes, it is better than nothing.

“Go!”

But when everyone just grabbed a handful of Odd Crystals and put them in their pockets, a huge rock fell.

It smashed heavily on the piled-up Odd crystals.

“Hurry up!”

Lin Xiu also reacted at this time and said.

The rock in this cave is not an ordinary rock. From the previous fights, we know that this rock is extremely hard.

So it is only now that it has begun to collapse.

If you are pressed inside, it is not so easy to get out.

An Qi and the others also reacted very quickly. At this time, they couldn’t care about these odd crystals and ran straight out of the cave.

boom boom boom —

After everyone ran out, the entire cave completely collapsed in an instant.

The huge stone completely blocked the entrance of the cave.

“Damn it... is it blocked?”

After running out, Liu Pan watched this scene and couldn’t help but say aloud.

But apart from the odd crystals, there were also other treasures.

It’s really a pity.

“This is Heimao rock, which is very heavy and in this case, it shouldn’t be that easy to lift it to find those Odd crystals.”

At this time, An Qi also said a little regretfully.

Those odd crystals were in the middle of the mountains. They had to use large machines to excavate them, otherwise it is very troublesome.

“Forget it, anyway, the most important thing, I have taken out the Odd crystals.”

Lin Xiu said at this time.

That’s right, Lin Xiu took most of the rank 10 odd crystals that were inside, while Liu Pan and the others took the rest.

Looking to the back, you can see that many warriors are still messing with the corpse of the Raging Flame Lion Beast.

Its skeleton, there are warriors who want to get rid of it.

After all, the skeleton of this king-level evolved beast is also extremely powerful for making weapons.

“Let’s go quickly.”

Lin Xiu took a look. Those people should still be chasing him, but they didn’t realize that he just went around and came back to the cave.

“Ok.”

Liu Pan and the others nodded, then walked to the other side.

The surrounding warriors glanced at Lin Xiu and the others, but they didn’t come forward to look for trouble.

“Hahaha, we’re finally out, this time the harvest is okay.”

After walking outside, Liu Pan heaved a sigh of relief and took out several rank 10 Odd crystals in his pocket and he couldn’t help being pleasantly surprised.

“Let’s rest here for a while, shall we?”

Walking to a place in the forest ahead, An Qi said out of breath.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu nodded, looked around, the environment here should still be very safe.

“I’m exhausted brother.”

Liu Pan sat on the ground unceremoniously, leaning against the trunk of a huge tree behind him.

“By the way, Brother Lin, that Raging flame lion... you killed it?”

After resting for a while, Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something, then looked at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“En... I just made a final kill.”

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then smiled.

If those warriors hadn’t attacked the Raging Flame Lion for so long and forced the beast to the end, he wouldn’t have been able to kill it so easily.

At this time, he took out a bit from his pocket and took out a fiery red Odd crystal.

This Odd crystal looked very strange – it had a fiery red body around it and looked like a heart.

“This is the King-level Odd Crystal!?”

Seeing this scene, An Qi and Qian Lin could not help exclaiming.

“What a powerful energy fluctuation...” Liu Pan couldn’t help but sigh now.

The Odd crystals of the king-level evolved beasts are indeed extraordinary. Just by being so close, you could feel the terrifying energy fluctuations.

“Brother Lin, now is the time when the energy is the most abundant. If you swallow it now, you will get the most power!”

Liu Pan said.

He was right. When the Odd crystals were just dug out, the energy contained was the strongest, but as time passed, some energy would always be lost.

“Don’t have to swallow.”

Lin Xiu shook his head. At this moment, Lin Xiu put his hands together with the King-level Odd crystal in the palm of his hand, then began to absorb the energy inside.

“Don’t have to swallow...?”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s actions, Liu Pan couldn’t help being stunned.

After all, high-level Odd crystals can only be swallowed into the body to absorb all the power...

At this moment, a rustling sound rang out, causing Lin Xiu, who was about to absorb the power of this king-level Odd crystal, to frown.
