1464 Fierce Battle

Experience is not enough!

After killing this God king, Lin Xiu found that his experience was still not up to the level of leveling up.

“So many god kings, can you kill them all?”

At this moment, the figure of Zhulong also appeared beside Lin Xiu.

“certainly.”

Lin Xiu said in a cold voice at this moment.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s eyes were full of killing intent.

The earth, the entire earth’s cities, have all been destroyed!

Almost all humans were dead.

Lin Xiu’s eye sockets turned red.

At this time, the killing intent has reached its peak.

“Kill him together!”

Huangfu Yuanshen roared angrily at this time.

As soon as he finished speaking, the other two god kings also rushed over at this time.

They are the Wind God King and the Purple Lightning God King!

“His inheritance should be on this kid’s body!”

At this time, Huangfu Yuanshen stabbed Lin Xiu with the long sword in his hand, and continued to roar loudly.

As soon as he finished speaking, Xia Guang and the 20,000 god kings had fiery expressions in their eyes.

If Lin Xiu can be killed, then they will be able to absorb those inherited powers!

And now Lin Xiu still has a divine weapon, and the divine weapon spear also has a tool spirit!

Lin Xiu watched them charge over, and the black spear in his hand danced wildly.

At this moment, a series of terrifying flaming birds rushed directly towards the crowd!

Seeing the incoming flaming birds, the expressions in the eyes of the god kings changed slightly.

At this time, they all used body skills to dodge at the same time.

Lin Xiu looked at Huangfu Yuanshen, without any hesitation at this moment, and appeared in front of Huangfu Yuanshen in a flash!

‘Profound Intent·Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

As the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand stabbed out, it instantly turned into tens of thousands of spear shadows!

A large number of cracks appeared in the surrounding space at this time!

Dangdangdang——

At this time, Huangfu Yuanshen was frantically waving his long sword, trying to resist Lin Xiu’s attacks.

But the speed of Lin Xiu’s long spear stabbing out is extremely fast, and the power is also extremely powerful.

At this moment, he also had no way to resist Lin Xiu’s attacks.

The tip of the spear poked a few blood holes in his body in an instant!

Because of the flame of chaos on the tip of the spear, at this time Huangfu Yuanshen’s poked blood holes also started to burn with flame of chaos!

“ah!”

At this time, he let out a scream.

At this time, with a movement of his body, he disappeared in an instant.

Where did you run off to!?

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes couldn’t help shrinking.

Lin Xiu also wanted to search for Huangfu Yuanshen.

But at this moment, Xia Guang and other god kings have already attacked!

The black source mark on Xia Guang’s forehead has already begun to change at this time.

At this moment, Lin Xiu was once again trapped in a square space.

There is no way to leave here for a while!

And at this time, a large number of wind attribute skills, as well as electric attribute skills, directly charged towards Lin Xiu!

Boom, boom, boom——

At this moment, loud noises erupted suddenly.

Because of this terrifying skill, there were a lot of space cracks in the surrounding space!

At this time, under the joint attack of Ling Tianxi and Hetian God King, Luo Yue’s body had already started to have wounds.

Although the set of battle uniforms given by Lin Xiu is very defensive, it is still too difficult to completely resist the attacks of these god kings.

“Die!!!”

At this moment, Ling Tianxi swung the long sword in his hand, and suddenly a huge wave of weak water rushed towards Luo Yue!

Seeing this scene, Luo Yue’s pupils shrank slightly.

The long sword in her hand was raised.

Whoosh—

At this moment, a large amount of black water also burst out directly with the long sword.

Collided with the water released by Ling Tianxi.

Boom——

Weak water and black water collided together, and there was a loud sound.

“ah!”

The black water directly suppressed her Weak water!

A large number of black water explosions hit Ling Tianxi’s side, causing Ling Tianxi’s entire body to be hit by the black water.

The severe pain made him let out a scream.

At this time, he fell down.

“die!!!”

At this time, God King Hetian was holding a saber, and pierced through Luo Yue’s shoulder from behind!

“Get lost!!!”

Lin Xiu just saw this scene with his eyes, and his eyes turned red.

Boom——

At this moment, a lot of flames burst out from Lin Xiu’s entire body.

At this time, along with these bursting flame of chaos, they rushed out.

The space formed by Xia Guang’s space ability also burst instantly.

Lin Xiu’s ‘Flashing Souls’ body technique was used, and he appeared directly next to God King Hetian.

The black spear in his hand was about to stab his head!

God King Hetian was startled, and the saber that pierced Luo Yue’s shoulder was pulled out at this moment.

His body also instantly disappeared in place.

“Luo Yue, are you okay?”

At this moment, Lin Xiu hugged Luo Yue.

“I’m fine.”

Luo Yue shook her head.

At this time, Lin Xiu stretched out his left hand, and some water attribute power was released immediately.

With the release of these water-attributed powers, it immediately began to heal Luo Yue’s wounds.

“You all will die.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu was furious.

‘Source strength Control’!

Lin Xiu used this skill directly at this time.

Although the source strength on the earth is meager, with the use of the ability to control the source strength, he could still absorb a large amount of source strength.

Lin Xiuji’s black spear pointed at the sky.

Boom——

At this moment, a large amount of flame burst out from the entire body of the black spear!

These flame of chaos directly covered the entire sky! Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

Xia Guang and the god kings looked at the flame of chaos in the sky at this time, and their eyes were full of fear.

The temperature of this flame of chaos was really terrifying.

Their bodies all felt extremely hot.

Sweat kept coming out.

“go.”

Following Lin Xiu’s angry shout.

There were a large number of flaming meteors impacting down in the sky!

“Get away!”

Looking at this scene, Xia Guang’s pupils shrank slightly.

“Hiding?”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly.

At this time, a black mark appeared on his forehead.

“Do you think that you are the only one with spatial abilities?”

With the release of the power of Lin Xiu’s spatial source mark, there were a large number of matrices in the surrounding sky, surrounding the entire space!

These god kings wanted to leave this area, and immediately found the matrix blocking them!
