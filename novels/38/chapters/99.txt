Chapter 100: Give You A Weapon

The Warrior Union was the only warrior union in the world, in which there were five levels of membership, ranging from one star to five stars. Five-star members were practically the leaders of the Warrion Union, only the heads of state or warriors who made great contributions had it, followed by four-star members, and so on.

Three-star members were also very great, to say the least, they were very strong warriors.

Lin Xiu really didn’t expect Baili Haoling to be a three-star member.

“Come on,” Baili Haoling said to Lin Xiu.

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu nodded, looked at the people behind him, then threw a punch fiercely!

“1999KG!” To conform to the norms of society, Lin Xiu did not use all his strength.

But the rest of the warriors were frightened and wondered if the younger generation was really so perverted now.

“Oh? It’s you guys?” At this moment, Baili Haoling smiled when he saw Lei Liang and the others.

Lei Liang smiled awkwardly and still felt quite afraid. He wanted to snatch Baili Haoling’s things and didn’t expect that he was actually an examiner!

“Come on, don’t worry, I’m not going to mix personal grievances with this.” Baili Haoling seemed to read his mind and assured him.

The test of strength had eliminated dozens of people, and the remaining hundred or so warriors were led to the field by Baili Haoling.

The speed test was simple – it was a 100-meter sprint.

Ten people started at the same time, of course, Lin Xiu passed this test very easily.

Not many people were eliminated this around, only around 30 people.

And the final round was the physical test. The remaining warriors took the test together and had to run a hundred laps in a row which was about 50 kilometers. This test was limited to 30 minutes.

As long as they passed, they would get the certificate.

This was hard for some people, but it was really easy for Lin Xiu.

After all, during these few days, he also ran almost 100 kilometers at one go and even had to kill evolved beasts while running.

“Ding~~~”

“Congratulations Master on completing 100 percent of the weight-bearing growth plan!”

“Congratulations Master on gaining 50 potential points!”

When Lin Xiu was done running 100 laps in 18 minutes, a clear voice resounded in his head.

‘So soon!?’

Lin Xiu hadn’t been paying attention to it these days, so when he heard this voice, he was pleasantly surprised.

And the weighted vests and protective gears on his body were weightless instantaneously and became ordinary protective gears.

Without the weights, Lin Xiu felt very light. It was as if he just had to put in a slight force and his body would be able to fly!

Surprised, Lin Xiu went straight into his head and opened the stats board.

Host: Lin Xiu

Level: Level 16

Experience: 839,635 (4,500,000 experience required for the next level)

Strength: 261

Physique: 107

Speed: 79

Skill: ‘Analytic Eye, ‘Fury’, ‘Disguise’

Rage build-up: 0/100

Potential points: 50

Title: Rank 2 warrior

Overall Combat Strength: 1,915

Awesome, it seemed that his previous training was quite effective and his attributes had increased slightly.

At this moment, Lin Xiu thought about it and added the 50 potential points directly to Strength, so that the 261 points increased to 311 points!

His combat strength had also changed and became 1,990!

He just needed ten points of combat strength and he would be able to reach the level of a rank 3 warrior!

His ‘cultivation technique’ was probably still not up to par, otherwise, he could break through 2,000 combat strength and reach a rank 3 warrior.

And when he reached a rank 3 warrior, there should be rewards, right? With that thought, Lin Xiu became excited.

The final physical test had eliminated quite a number of people and only a few dozen people were able to get the warrior certification.

“Congratulations on successfully becoming a member of the Warrior Union, this is your Warrior Card.” Inside the hall, Baili Haoling handed Lin Xiu a card.

The Warrior Card was very thin, but it felt exceptionally hard like it was made of special material with the Warrior Union logo printed on it.

“The ID number is printed on the back and the initial password is the last six digits of your ID.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“With this card, you can log on to the official website of the Warrior Union on your computer or mobile phone, check for information, buy weapons, or take on a variety of missions.”

Lin Xiu nodded and was a little excited as he held the card.

“Alright, I’ve received a message from the union that they need me for a mission, I can’t train with you already.” At this moment, the warriors who got their cards left excitedly as Baili Haoling stood next to Lin Xiu and spoke to him.

“Hmm.”

“Don’t you have anything to say to persuade me from leaving, huh?” Seeing how indifferent Lin Xiu was, Baili Haoling viciously stared at Lin Xiu and said.

“Fine, fine. Can you continue to train with me?” Lin Xiu said helplessly at this moment.

“Not sincere.” Baili Haoling curled his lips and said, “Where are you going to next?”

Lin Xiu hesitated but did not hide and answered directly, “The Path of Death.”

“You’re going there ah? At your current level, it’s quite dangerous.” Baili Haolin said, slightly surprised.

“Hmm. But I have to go over there. Because the Sacred Region Academy is there and If I don’t graduate, a lot of things would be difficult to do.”

“Throw that lousy weapon away, I’ll give you a new one.” At this moment, Baili Haoling glanced at the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand and said.

“Do you have a spear?” Lin Xiu asked.

“Hehe, I just extorted it from the owner of this Warrior Union branch.” Then, Baili Haoling gave a sly smile, then like a magic trick, he carried a huge wooden box from the back and placed it on the table with a bang.

“Although you can strengthen a weapon by enveloping it with source strength, the effect of this advanced weapon is better.”

The box was large and long, it seemed to be made of some very high-end reddish-black wood.

It looked very simple and had a layer of dust on it.

Lin Xiu placed his hand on it and suddenly felt a vibration. The thing inside seemed to be pulsating with life.

“That old man doesn’t need it for himself so he hid it, but I found it.” Baili Haoling smiled and blew the dust off it.

“Don’t say that your master doesn’t care about you.”

Bang——

As the box opened, a ray of dazzling light suddenly pierced Lin Xiu’s eyes.
