Chapter 296: I Want To Make A Deal With You

Lin Xiu looked towards where his finger was pointed at. It was right towards the place where there were many corpses.

“I don’t.” Lin Xiu shook his head and replied.

He was suspicious of the situation and wanted to interrogate more people.

But the group was also unaware of what had happened.

“When did you guys come in?” Lin Xiu looked at the man and said.

Lin Xiu finally found surviving warriors and wanted to listen to any information they had.

“Yesterday.” The man saw that Lin Xiu was unaware of the situation and replied to him.

“We came here yesterday and discovered corpses all over when we came here. There were even corpses belonging to rank 7 warriors.” At this point, the man’s face became serious.

It was definitely not good news for them if even rank 7 warriors could die here. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

From the looks of it, they were already in danger.

“Why are you guys not going further ahead?” Lin Xiu looked at them and asked.

As he said that, their expressions changed as though they knew something but hesitated to speak.

The man’s expression changed and sighed, “There seems to be a few high-level evolved beasts ahead. We can’t get past.”

Their expressions changed to one of unresigned and unhappiness.

As though they wanted to continue but had no way to do so.

“What’s over there?” Lin Xiu asked anxiously.

“Shouldn’t it be my turn to ask you now?” The man was astute and smiled.

Lin Xiu looked at him and nodded his head. It was considered an exchange of information and he would not lose anything.

“When did you come here?” The man posed the same question to Lin Xiu.

“The day before.”

“What are you doing here?”

“Looking for someone.”

“Could you be…” When Lin Xiu replied, one of the people behind the leader had a change in expression and subconsciously blurted out something. But when he saw the man’s gaze, it made him keep quiet

The man’s glare had shut him up.

“You wanted to say if I’m looking for the Ice Lotus Fire?” Lin Xiu shook his head and asked.

“How do you know?” The man was startled and took the chance to ask.

“There are so many warriors that came in recently, isn’t it because of that?” Lin Xiu replied.

If not for the Ice Lotus Fire that was worth cities, why would so many warriors risk their lives to come in?

One had to know that the Dark Forest was extremely dangerous.

The number of rank 7 and rank 6 warrior corpses revealed how scary and dangerous Dark Forest was.

“Are you guys looking for it too?” Lin Xiu raised an eyebrow and continued.

“No, we are not.” The man was startled then regained his smile and shook his head.

“Although it is very valuable, we are aware of our strengths. We are looking for something to save our friend.”

‘Looking for something!?’

Lin Xiu frowned and looked at him, as though trying to see if the man was lying or not.

‘By the looks of it, he isn’t lying.’

“Alright, seems like you guys don’t have any further useful information. Let this conclude, farewell.” Lin Xiu spoke up indifferently.

He turned and started to move ahead.

“You sure you’re going that way?” The man looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

“Why, is it very dangerous?” Lin Xiu looked at him and asked.

“En.” The man hesitated for a moment and nodded his head.

“Well, whatever.” Lin Xiu remained expressionless.

‘So arrogant!’

The two words came up in everybody’s minds at the same time when they heard him.

Although his spear was explosively strong, they felt that he was at most comparable to them.

Isn’t he seeking death if he continued that way with his strength?

“I want to make a deal with you, what about it?” The man hesitated for a moment and added.

Deal?

“What deal?”

Lin Xiu was originally about to continue onward but was taken aback when he heard the word ‘deal’.

‘I don’t seem to have anything for them to make a deal with, right?’

“If you head in deeper and obtain the horns of the Unicorn terror beast, I can exchange something with you.” The man looked at Lin Xiu earnestly and said.

Unicorn Terror beast? Lin Xiu never heard of this evolved beast before.

“We’ll see how.” Lin Xiu nodded his head then carried on without turning back.

“If you find it, find us at the bar in Forest Town, I’m Zhang Zong.” The man continued to speak as he watched Lin Xiu depart.

“Zhang Zong, what’s the point of telling him that he’ll be dead once he goes over there.” The man that almost died to Lin Xiu’s spear spoke up once Lin Xiu was gone.

“Not for sure.” The man called Zhang Zong shook his head.

He did not know but intuition told him that the young man was strong and could be able to achieve it.

“Maybe I’m overthinking it.” Zhang Zong gave a self-mocking smile and returned with the group.

Lin Xiu continued ahead and looked around as he became cautious.

‘The group of rank 6 warriors were unable to continue ahead, what came out from here?’

He held Luo Yue’s sword as his thoughts became more complicated.

As he brought his suspicions ahead, he suddenly caught a whiff of a dense blood stench.

“Quick! Kill it!!!”

Lin Xiu heard shouting from a distance.

It seemed as though there was a battle ahead!
