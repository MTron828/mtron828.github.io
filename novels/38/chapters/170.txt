Chapter 171: Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist!

‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’ was a Gold skill card.

“Oh? Do you want this one?” The old man said aloud when he saw Lin Xiu looking at this skill card.

“This skill is not easy to learn. As far as I know, all the people who have bought this skill card got seriously injured.” The old man touched his beard and continued to say.

“Seriously injured?” Lin Xiu raised his brows.

“Yes, I don’t know if you have ever heard of a powerful fist technique in the bronze skill called ‘Rupturing Fist’. The old man nodded.

“‘Rupturing Fist’ would injure the user first before it could be trained to the extent of hurting others and ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’ is actually related to ‘Rupturing Fist’. But the difference lies in that you could use the powerful current generated by source strength along with your punch which greatly increases its power.”

“Even people who knew how to use the ‘Rupturing Fist’ must be able to withstand extremely strong currents so as to not hurt themselves…”

“I want this.” Lin Xiu nodded and said at this time.

The old man was taken aback. He said so much and this kid still insisted on this extremely dangerous skill card?

“You sure?”

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu nodded.

This skill card was probably too dangerous and didn’t require a lot of points, just 6,000 points.

Lin Xiu continued looking around and purchased the ‘Divine Wind Kick’ skill for 10,000 points. Now, he was left with more than 7,000 points.

He wanted to buy another skill card but didn’t have enough points.

Forget it, he would just get these two today!

The old man could not help but shook his head secretly as he watched Lin Xiu’s retreating figure. Just this ‘Divine Wind Kick’ was also very difficult to learn among the gold skills, not to mention the ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’.

Practicing these two very powerful skills all at once, how could he possibly succeed?

Just as Lin Xiu was about to leave, someone blocked his way.

“You’re Lin Xiu, right.” Standing in front of Lin Xiu was a handsome man.

And Lin Xiu could feel the terrifying aura from him.

Zhuo Qixing.

The strongest warrior in this intake of freshmen; he was only slightly older than Lin Xiu, but his strength has reached the peak of a rank 5 warrior.

As Lin Xiu has reached the level of a rank 4 warrior, he enabled the Analytic Eye and could clearly see Zhuo Qixing’s attributes:

Character: Zhuo Qixing

Strength: 685

Physique: 289

Speed: 180

Combat Strength: 5,799

His attribute was much higher than Lin Xiu’s.

“It is indeed pretty good to be able to defeat Yu Yi by trickery.” Before Lin Xiu could speak, Zhuo Qixing spoke.

“My purpose of looking for you is very clear, I just wanted to tell you that you and Luo Yue are from different worlds.” Zhuo Qixing said and looked straight into Lin Xiu’s eyes.

“If you know yourself, please take the initiative to leave.”

“Are you threatening me?” Lin Xiu raised his brow and asked.

“It’s not a threat, I’m just telling you a fact.” Zhuo Qixing said indifferently.

“I’ve checked your identity. Both your parents are dead. Unless you can reach rank 9 warrior, you are still considered weak in this world.”

“Thank you for your trouble.” Lin Xiu still didn’t have any expression on his face.

As Lin Xiu spoke, he walked to the other side without looking back.

“Young Master Zhuo, this guy is really smug, huh.” At the same time, Luo Xiaoqi, who was walking behind, said in disdain.

Previously, he asked Zhao Huang and the others to teach the people in Class 10 a lesson but didn’t expect Lin Xiu to teach him a lesson instead.

This made him very upset.

‘Isn’t he just the class monitor of Class 10?’

“He should know, based on his status, he is not worthy to be with Luo Yue.” Zhuo Qixing’s eyes became cold at this time.

Lin Xiu walked to the road.

He seemed to be in a daze.

‘Luo Yue’s status?’

Lin Xiu had also thought about this before. To be able to groom such a powerful warrior, coupled with Luo Yue’s temperament, he knew at first glance that she was not an ordinary girl.

So, what exactly is her status?

“Why am I thinking so much!” Lin Xiu suddenly shook his head, it was as if he was going to propose marriage.

But what he must admit was that after spending time together these days, Lin Xiu seemed to have developed a special feeling for Luo Yue.

As soon as he returned to the villa, he saw that there were already ordered meals on the table, and Luo Yue was still brandishing her sword.

“I’ve eaten.” Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu and said faintly.

Lin Xiu knew exactly what she meant and simply sat at the dining table and gobbled the food up.

“By the way, have your class nominated someone for tomorrow’s freshman assembly?” Lin Xiu asked.

“You’ll find out tomorrow.” Luo Yue gave a sly look at this time, but it was just a flash, and she returned to her usual icy countenance.

Lin Xiu curled his lips.

But thinking of Zhuo Qixing’s words made Lin Xiu’s face change.

Luo Yue noticed it and she stopped what she was doing for a moment. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

‘What’s up with him?’

But very quickly, after seeing that Lin Xiu was moving, Luo Yue continued practicing basic swordsmanship.

An elite isn’t created overnight. Only by practicing day after day can one become strong.

Lin Xiu sat on the other side of the training ground after eating and took out the two gold skill cards.

‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’ was almost tailor-made for him because he had the foundation of ‘Rupturing Fist’ and was forced by Luo Yue to go through the electric shock resistance training.

He could withstand normal currents.

But ‘Divine Wind Kick’ was a bit difficult.

He shook his head and put the skill cards directly on his forehead.

With the use of the skill card, a large amount of information surged in his mind.

Although all the information was in his mind, he didn’t have muscle memory yet, so he still had to practice constantly.

The night passed quickly and it was the morning of the next day.

“Gu gu gu”

Early in the morning, Rollie seemed to be very excited, standing on Lin Xiu’s shoulders and constantly jumping, making a strange noise.

“Do you want to go too?” Lin Xiu said to this little thing at this time.

Rollie seemed bored staying in the house all the time.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, it jumped excitedly.

“You must stay in my pocket and don’t move around.” Lin Xiu said as he put it in his pocket.

Lin Xiu neatened his clothes and was about to set off.

Today is…the freshmen assembly ah!
