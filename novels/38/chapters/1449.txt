1450 Approaching Flame of Chaos

Boom boom boom—

At this time, just as Lin Xiu stepped into the space crack, he heard loud noises.

This is…

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked around.

After taking a closer look, he found that everything he saw in front of his eyes was blurry.

Very weird.

“This place is the Chaos Realm?”

Lin Xiu said to himself.

At this time, he could clearly feel the strange energy in the surrounding air.

These energies are very powerful, but they seem to contain many kinds of impurities.

There was no way to absorb it. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Once absorbed, the unknown substances contained in these energies will pour into one’s body together.

“Chaos Realm.”

The phantom of Zhulong also appeared beside Lin Xiu at this time.

“Have you been here before?”

Lin Xiu said in a faint voice while walking forward.

“Hmph! I am more familiar with this place than anyone else!”

Zhulong said in a cold voice.

“That old guy, I don’t know how many times he’s been here.”

Listening to Zhulong’s words, Lin Xiu also had a look of surprise in his eyes.

“He also wants to absorb the Flame of Chaos?”

“Absorb? Hehe, I don’t need to absorb.”

At this time, Zhulong showed a strange expression.

“If you want to absorb the flames of chaos, go to the left and keep going.”

At this time, Zhulong continued to speak.

“Why did you tell me?”

Lin Xiu said a little vigilantly.

This Zhu Long, who suddenly told Lin Xiu the location of the Flame of Chaos so kindly and Lin Xiu felt that something was wrong.

“I told you so easily because I want you to die quickly.”

Zhu Long sneered.

“Do you think that just anyone can absorb the Flame of Chaos?”

In the next moment, his figure disappeared instantly.

Is the Flame of Chaos so powerful?

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly at this moment.

Ignoring Zhulong’s words just now, Lin Xiuxi walked directly to the left with the black spear in his hand.

Walking forward step by step, Lin Xiu didn’t know how long he walked.

But the surrounding scene doesn’t seem to have changed much.

Under the feet, there is a gray-black substance.

These substances are a little fuzzy, but he could still stand firmly on them.

It’s not just under the feet, even other places are full of such things.

The Chaos Realm is indeed full of chaos.

Are there no monsters here?

Walking here, there is nothing else at all and there is no end.

And the surroundings would also change constantly.

If you want to remember any key places, you can’t remember them at all.

In this way, you will get lost…

Soon, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the surrounding space began to become hotter.

It’s hot, very hot.

As Lin Xiu continued to walk forward, the burning sensation became more and more intense.

It’s like trying to burn people down.

“Huh? Is someone here?”

At this moment, a voice came from the front.

When Lin Xiu heard this voice, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

Taking a closer look, he saw a dark-bodied man standing in front of him.

The man looked strong and strong and his eyes were looking at Lin Xiu who was walking over.

“Don’t worry, I won’t attack you.”

“Because later, you will die here too.”

The man looked at Lin Xiu and suddenly showed a strange smile.

“You too, are you here to absorb the Flame of Chaos?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“certainly.”

“I will definitely absorb it successfully.”

He seems to be very confident.

“Then let’s see.”

Lin Xiu smiled and continued to walk forward.

“Let’s go together.”

This man also walked beside Lin Xiu.

While walking, Lin Xiu didn’t let his guard down.

Because this man was the first person he met in the Chaos Realm.

“This is…”

Looking forward, you can clearly see that flames are starting to appear in the front.

A golden flame, but it’s different from ordinary golden flames.

This golden flame has a very terrifying feeling.

Just standing here gives people a sense of terror from the depths of their souls.

At this time, take a closer look, there were other warriors around as well, not only the man he met just now!

And there were quite a few of these warriors!

These people stood on this chaos realm, staring at the Flame of Chaos over there.

They also seem to want to absorb the flames of chaos.

Someone has passed by!

Taking a closer look at this moment, Lin Xiu saw the God warrior, who seemed to be walking into the sea of flames.

To absorb the power of the Flame of Chaos, one needs to find the source of fire.

This source of fire must be in the center.

To find the source of fire, one must first enter the flame.

“ah!!!”

As soon as the man walked in, his whole body was instantly burned.

He made a miserable sound.

Soon, his body was directly burned at a speed visible to the naked eye.

This means that even the soul will be burned.

Some people around couldn’t help but tremble at this moment.

Although they want to obtain the power of Flame of Chaos.

But the scene in front of them still made them feel afraid.

The Flame of Chaos is really terrifying.

At this time, Lin Xiu also approached the flame.

If one didn’t have strong fire resistance, they wouldn’t be able to stand there.

“Do you see it?”

“Everyone wants to obtain the Flame of Chaos.”

“But you saw that everyone died in the end.”

The man who had just walked over with Lin Xiu couldn’t help but speak aloud at this time.

“Then what about you, aren’t you afraid of death?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly when he heard his words.

“People who are afraid of death will not come here.”

“As long as you can get the flame of chaos, you can become the strongest existence!”

The man grinned grimly.

It was as if he had already thought of the scene where he obtained the flame of chaos.

“It’s really crazy.”

Lin Xiu scanned the area and found that most of the warriors had fanaticism in their eyes.

Flame of Chaos.

Since knowing the coordinates of the Flame of Chaos, an unknown number of God warriors have come here at the risk.

Just to absorb the Flame of Chaos.

This kind of flame power can match everything!

“I will definitely get you.”

Lin Xiu looked at the Flame of Chaos and said lightly.

But there was an extremely firm look in his tone.

“Don’t die so fast.”

The man just now also showed a hint of ridicule.

“If you die, I will be free.”

The phantom of Zhulong also appeared beside Lin Xiu.

“Just let me in.”

With a thought, Lin Xiu put the Dark Edge spear directly into his expansion space.

At this moment, the phantom of Zhu Long disappeared instantly.

And Lin Xiu, at this moment, also walked in directly!
