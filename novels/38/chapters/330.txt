It hurts and the intense pain made Lin Xiu clench his teeth.

“‘Heavenly Dragon Wrecks the City’!!!” Lin Xiu screamed just as Zhang Jie was about to slash his body with the sharp blade. Then, the Dark Edge Spear on his right hand stabbed out and many black substances burst out from the spear.

These black substances instantly converged into the head of a huge Dark Edge dragon and directly charged towards Zhang Jie!

Zhang Jie didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would have such a powerful skill!

At this moment, the black dragon opened its huge mouth and bit her body, then rushed directly to the back!

Bang——

Zhang Jie’s body slammed directly against the thick branches behind and a loud rumble echoed.

The entire tree shook violently at this moment.

“Kill her!” Lin Xiu bellowed.

At this moment, Luo Yue had already rushed over and she was about to attack Zhang Jie with her long sword!

Zhang Jie looked at Luo Yue, who was rushing towards her at an extremely fast speed and her face turned ugly.

As this skill released by Lin Xiu caused her body to hit against the branch at the back, she felt an intense pain throughout her body.

A rank 5 warrior actually injured her! For her, this was simply embarrassing!

And she was even more shocked that this dragon that was formed out of a black mist was still biting on to her body and she couldn’t move at all.

At this time, Luo Yue had already rushed in front of Zhang Jie and the long sword in her hand slashed Zhang Jie’s neck.

“Go to hell.” Luo Yue said coldly and the long sword instantly turned into a cold ray of light.

Dang–

But what she didn’t expect was that when the long sword cut through Zhang Jie’s skin, a clear sound rang out!

It was as if her long sword cut into a metal object.

Luo Yue’s expression changed as she saw that beneath Zhang Jie’s skin, there were a lot of machine-like things inside.

“Cyborg!?” Luo Yue’s expression changed drastically and she exclaimed.

Bang–

As soon as she said that, Zhang Jie suddenly exploded with power and she broke away from the black dragon.

Then in the next moment, she grabbed Luo Yue by the neck.

She lifted Luo Yue up with one hand and grabbed the long sword in Luo Yue’s hand with the other hand.

“Hehe, you didn’t expect that I would turn out this way, huh?” Zhang Jie said with a sullen expression looking at Luo Yue.

“Only in this way can I become even more powerful. The flesh and skin of human beings simply can’t reach this level.” Zhang Jie said as she threw Luo Yue’s long sword on the ground.

Then, she tugged on the skin on her neck and very soon, the skin began to heal.

“Let her go!”

Lin Xiu saw this scene and rushed over, holding the Dark Edge Spear, he was about to attach Zhang Jie!

“Hng!” Zhang Jie saw Lin Xiu rushing over and the pupils in her eyes constricted. Then, she moved her right hand and there was a strange noise around her.

Swish swish–

Two cold rays of light appeared in front of Lin Xiu at this moment.

Lin Xiu’s expression changed and he bent his back backward instinctively, dodging the attack.

But some of Lin Xiu’s hair still got cut.

At the moment when Lin Xiu bent over to avoid the attack then quickly stood up, he could see that there were two spinning rings in front!

Those rings that he had pierced into the mud began flying again!?

Before Lin Xiu had time to think about it, the two rings rushed towards Lin Xiu wildly!

The speed of the ring’s rotation seemed to be at its extreme as they cut through the air.

“Go away!!!” Lin Xiu was a little mad now and his skills were all in a cooling-down state, there was no way to use them at all.

The only thing he could use was his own strength.

‘Ninth Heaven Galaxy Fall’!!!

Seeing those things rushing over, Lin Xiu roared and the Dark Edge Spear in his hand was like a stream of light, knocking out the two rings directly.

While knocking those things away, Lin Xiu rushed towards Zhang Jie without any hesitation.

He pointed the long sword at Zhang Jie!

“You want to save her?” Zhang Jie saw Lin Xiu and she asked grimly.

Then, she exerted force around Luo Yue’s neck and was about to kill Luo Yue directly!

She wanted Lin Xiu to witness with his own eyes how Luo Yue was killed by her!

But just as she was about to exert force, Luo Yue grabbed her arm and she actually felt an iciness.

It was freezing!

The look in Zhang Jie’s eyes changed drastically. She looked up at Luo Yue and a white flame appeared on Luo Yue’s hand, then it was transferred to Zhang Jie’s arm!

These flames were different from ordinary flames. They were ice-cold like her arm was frozen because of these white flames.

Her eyes turned gloomy and the strength on her arm seemed to disappear.

“Get lost!!!” Before Zhang Jie came to her senses, Lin Xiu’s spear had already pierced her body!

Although the sharp tip of the Dark Edge Spear could not penetrate Zhang Jie’s body, the powerful impact that it produced caused Zhang Jie to fly out directly.

Lin Xiu stretched out his hand and hugged Luo Yue who was lifted in the air by Zhang Jie.

“Are you okay?”
