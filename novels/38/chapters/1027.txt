As they gathered their source energy, they swung their right hand and the sword that Lin Xiu had thrown onto the ground once again returned to them.

The swords in their hands were glowing brightly in white as they transferred their energy into it.

They were moving around as they released their skills.

Soon, they were standing right in front of Lin Xiu.

They held onto their swords and were attacking Lin Xiu ‘sphere’.

Boom boom boom – –

The swords that were covered with a bright light seemed to be filled with energy.

As the loud sound rang in the air continuously, they still couldn’t break Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’ with their sword.

“Elder Qiang, head back to the Dark Shadows. I’ve told them to gather.”

Lin Xiu informed Sima Qiang.

He was not moving at all and allowed both Hei Long and Bai Long to attack his ‘sphere’.

“Alright.”

Qima Qiang hesitated a little but decided to listen to Lin Xiu and quickly flew to the Dark Shadows.

“Trying to leave?”

Hei Long, who was busy attacking Lin Xiu, noticed Sima Qiang who was about to leave. He held onto his sword and went after him.

At the same time, the crystal ball of earth hanging around Lin Xiu’s necklace started glowing brightly.

Boom – –

The rocks nearby then floated into the air.

The sword aura that came from Hei Long were all blocked by the huge rocks.

“Alright. That’s enough. I’ll be serious from now on.”

Lin Xiu looked at Bai Long and Hei Long, who were right in front of him, before attacking them!

Boom – –

As Lin Xiu swung his long spear, it collided with Bai Long’s sword.

There was a loud noise and Bai Long’s sword flew out of his hands.

Xiu – –

Then, one of the warrior skills got activated and there were wind blades being released.

Bai Long was not prepared for it and one of his arms got chopped off by the wind blades!

“AHHHHHH!!!!!”

Bai Long screamed in agony.

He didn’t even have the chance to fight Lin Xiu and Lin Xiu was already aiming the tip of the long spear at his body!

As the long spear was thrusted outwards, there was a huge black dragon that appeared and it went directly towards Hei Long!

He no longer had energy left to release his ‘sphere’!

As the black dragon moved past his body, Bai Long’s body was instantly annihilated!

“Bai Long!”

Hei Long was beyond shocked when he saw what happened.

Bai Long, who was a sage warrior, got killed by Lin Xiu?!

Although they were mortal enemies, Hei Long still felt a little sad when he saw that Bai Long was dead!

“Now it’s your turn.”

Lin Xiu turned towards Hei Long and warned him.

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, Hei Long felt frightened.

He had just witnessed the death of Bai Long and he no longer had the courage to fight Lin Xiu.

Then, his body disappeared and he tried to run!

“Are you leaving already?”

Lin Xiu remained at the same place and did not go after him.

Instead, there was a black sourcemark that appeared on his forehead.

As Lin Xiu gathered his thoughts and stared at the direction that Hei Long ran, there were arrays that appeared in the sky.

Hei Long noticed the arrays that appeared and was shocked.

He was still trying to run away, avoiding the arrays at all cost.

But, it didn’t work. Within a blink of an eye, he was stuck inside these arrays.

“Let me go!”

Hei Long screamed in rage as his body was now stuck inside the array.

He was wriggling his body, trying his best to escape from the array.

No matter how hard he tried, he still couldn’t set himself free.

He tried gathering his source energy but soon realised that while he was inside the array, he could not use any of his energy.

There was no way where he could set himself free.

“Goodbye.”

Lin Xiu looked at Hei Long, who was struggling inside the array from afar, before bidding goodbye.

The entire array slowly expanded with Lin Xiu’s control.

Boom – –

With a loud noise, Hei Long’s body was then blasted into ashes.

Then, there was a notification that came from his system.

Lin Xiu looked around before disappearing into thin air.

Three of the sage warriors from the Wildfire City were dead.

Every single warrior in Wildfire City were shocked.

The three strongest parties in Wildfire City – the Zhao family, the Black Troops and the White Troops were all annihilated.

The Dark Shadows, led by Sima Qiang, suddenly became the only party left.

“Have you recovered from your injuries?”

A few days later, Lin Xiu appeared in Wildfire City.

“I’m much better.”

Sima Qiang smiled.

In the past few days, the members of the Dark Shadows have all returned.

There were also new members that joined them.

The Dark Shadow’s base has turned from underground to above ground.

“Thank you, young master, for saving my life. Otherwise, I would have been killed by Zhao Rui.”

Sima Qiang was beyond grateful towards Lin Xiu.

When he was captured by Zhao Rui, he knew that he would die.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would return to Wildfire City.

In the end, not only did Lin Xiu return, he was much stronger than before.

Lin Xiu shook his hand. He suddenly thought of something and asked Sima Qiang, “I told you to look up something for me. Any news about it?”

The Orchid of Heaven.

Lin Xiu had gotten the Dark Shadows to look for it.

Although Wu Hao had already given him the information, Lin Xiu still wanted to make sure if they were true.

“I already got them to look for it but we didn’t find anything useful.”

Sima Qiang shook his head.

“You couldn’t find any?”

Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows after hearing Sima Qiang’s answers.

Then…..how did Wu Hao find it?

“En. We couldn’t find anything now but I have told them to continue looking for it.”

Sima Qiang nodded his head.

“Alright. I will leave Wildfire City to you then.”

As Lin Xiu walked out of the building, he could see the entire Wildfire city.

“No problem.”

Sima Qiang answered confidently.

“After this, I will be gone for a period of time. By the time I return, I hope to see a new Dark Shadow.”

Lin Xiu smiled as his body slowly disappeared.

Sima Qiang starred in the direction where Lin Xiu was previously standing.

“Young Master, I will be waiting for your return.”

Lin Xiu was now riding on the Angel, flying in the opposite direction.

It was time for him to head back to earth.
