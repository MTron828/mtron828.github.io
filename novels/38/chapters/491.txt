Chapter 492: The Grade C Criminal Gang

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Sister Luo Yue, are you injured?” Ye Shuanger took a look at the ground beneath them before turning around, noticing that the clothes on one of her shoulders were burnt.

There was also blood seeping through her clothes.

“Don’t worry about it.” Luo Yue answered blandly and walked towards the window.

Lui Wei was shocked when he saw Luo Yue walking towards him. Just when he was about to say something, he noticed that Luo Yue had already jumped out of the window!

Ye Shuanger’s eyes widened in surprise as well when she saw what happened.

This was the fifteenth floor!

However, within seconds, they could already see Luo Yue on the ground and she seemed completely fine!

“This...” Lui Wei’s eyes turned huge as he felt that this was unbelievable!

Even if they were rank 6 warriors, it still would be possible for them to be injury-free from jumping down from such heights!

When he thought of how Luo Yue was able to chop all his men’s laser guns into pieces, he felt even more shocked.

Could it be…..that they were above rank 6?!

That’s impossible...

At that time, Lin Xiu had already walked into the building opposite the hospital. He got onto the high-speed elevator and soon got to the highest floor within minutes.

The door leading to the balcony on the highest floor was locked and the lock seems rusty. God knows how long this lock has been here.

Looks like that sniper did not enter from this route.

Lin Xiu didn’t waste his time thinking. He threw a punch and directly broke the entire door!

Boom – –

As Lin Xiu pushed the door open, he immediately walked towards the balcony.

With one foot onto the balcony, Lin Xiu could already feel that there were multiple laser beams that were on his body.

If it was anyone else, they wouldn’t be able to react quick enough and would definitely be hit by these laser beams.

But, at that very moment, Lin Xiu’s body moved by an inch and all the laser beams completely missed him. They landed on the wall behind him and there were instantly multiple holes that were formed on the wall.

The sniper wasn’t the only person here, there were a few more of them who were hiding here!

Xiu Xiu Xiu – – –

Without giving Lin Xiu any time to think about it, there were multiple laser beams that landed on him again.

One should remember that these laser beams travel at an extremely fast speed and with so many of them at the same time, the target would definitely be injured by these beams.

However, back in their training grounds, Lin Xiu has already done multiple training sessions that were similar to these. He didn’t even look nervous as he swiftly moved his body across the room and dodged each of the laser beams.

As he thought of how this sniper has injured Luo Yue, his eyes were immediately filled with a murderous intention.

He looked up and saw that there were a few men who were hiding behind a metal sculpture that was on the other side of the balcony. They were holding onto laser guns and were aiming those beams at Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu did not hesitate after seeing this and directly walked towards them.

‘Without a Trace’!

Although he had the diamond-level skill, it was mainly for dodging. As for this skill, it would help increase his traveling speed.

Lin Xiu’s figure was now like a shadow that was traveling across the room. They didn’t even have the time to see it carefully and Lin Xiu has already appeared right before their eyes!

When they saw Lin Xiu’s figure right before them, the look in their eyes changed.

Lin Xiu didn’t plan on giving them the time to react. He whacked them with his right hand and threw their laser guns onto the ground!

‘Serial Kick’!

Then, Lin Xiu’s right leg landed on them and a few of the men instantly were thrown off the balcony, falling right onto the ground!

“AHHHHHH!!!!”

Lui Wei and his men were still rushing towards that building and saw a few figures falling off the balcony.

Boom Boom Boom – –

There were soft groans as the men flew onto the street.

Their eyes were wide open, their brains cracked open with blood everywhere. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Lui Wei’s face changed uncontrollably after seeing these men.

These men…..seemed to have fallen off the balcony?!

“Director! These men…..look like wanted criminals!” One of the soldiers was reminded of something when he saw those men on the ground and quickly informed his senior.

“Wanted criminals?! Lui Wei was surprised. He immediately took out his phone and logged onto the app. He scanned the faces of the men that had died on the ground and soon found their information.

“Quick! Take a look at what is happening up there!” Lui Wei started panicking.

They were part of a grade C criminal. There were about 20 of them and the one leading them was a rank 5 warrior!

Lui Wei’s face turned ugly looking when he thought of how these criminals were now in Bai Di City. It would have caused so many problems to the safety of the city. If anything were to happen, he would definitely get to the bottom of this!

Plus, when he thought of how the leader of this gang was a rank 5 warrior, he felt a headache coming.

But there was no time left for him to think about these. He led a group of soldiers and headed towards the highest floor in that building.

“What rank are you?” Lin Xiu had just gotten rid of some of them by throwing them off the balcony when he heard a deep voice from behind him.

He turned around and saw a group of men who were staring at him with an evil look.

The young man in the center, who was also the one that spoke to him, had a scar across his face and looked extremely fierce.

His men, who were next to him, were holding onto heavy machinery and they were all pointing it at Lin Xiu.

“It was your man who shot just now?” Lin Xiu looked at them and asked.

His entire body was giving off a dangerous vibe.

With Lin Xiu staring at them, one after the other, these criminals who were used to killing others felt a chill running down their spine.

They did not understand how a young man could have such a strong murderous aura.

“Let me introduce myself. I am Spider.” The man with a scar on his face said towards Lin Xiu.

“I think that there has been a misunderstanding.” Spider looked at Lin Xiu and explained.

When Lin Xiu kicked his men off the balcony and after feeling the strong murderous intention that Lin Xiu had, Spider knew that Lin Xiu wasn’t an ordinary man.

It would cost them too much damage if they decided to fight him. It didn’t suit their style.

“Who was it?” Lin Xiu was still staring at them while he asked again.

“Seven, apologize to him..” Spider waved his hand and gave his commands
