Chapter 353: Broken Box

Lin Xiu picked up the weird thing that looked like a rectangular box and said.

“This?” Zhang Zong was stunned, then looked at the somewhat shabby and simple box in Lin Xiu’s hand.

The box is still covered with dust, it really looks like something taken out of the garbage dump.

Just take it away, anyway, I’m going to throw away this pile of things. Zhang Zong spread his hands and said aloud.

For him, these things are indeed some rubbish. Although they were recovered from the ruins, after careful analysis and inspection, they are all useless things.

Yeah. Lin Xiu nodded then threw the foot of the huge unicorn in his hand to Zhang Zong.

Zhang Zong was taken aback when he saw Lin Xiu throw the horns of the unicorn beast.

But he reacted quickly and directly caught the horns of the unicorn.

“You…”

“I’ll just give you this thing.” Lin Xiu said lightly.

Zhang Zong’s things here may be useful for others, but for Lin Xiu, they were really useless.

Although those skill cards were gold and diamonds, none of them were suitable for them, so there was no point.

“Give it to me?” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Zhang Zong opened his mouth and seemed surprised.

He originally planned that if Lin Xiu was greedy and demanded more than an item, he would have given them to him. After all, he needed this horn.

But what he didn’t expect was that Lin Xiu actually simply gave it to him?

“You don’t want these things…” Zhang Zong hesitated a little and said to Lin Xiu.

“It’s fine.”

“These things are of no use to me anyway.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and looked at the shabby box-like thing in his hand.

The value of this thing should be higher than all the things in this room.

With that thought, the corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth raised.

“That won’t work, I’ll give you Union coins.” Zhang Zong shook his head and said.

“How about I just take a diamond card?” Lin Xiu said helplessly when he heard Zhang Zong’s words.

Because he will be returning to the Sacred region academy the next day and Union coins were of no use to him at all over there.

“Yes, just take it, you can take two if you want!” Zhang Zong nodded and said with satisfaction.

As long as Lin Xiu took something, he was worried that Lin Xiu wouldn’t want anything.

If Lin Xiu didn’t want anything, he would feel that something was wrong. After all, nothing is free in the world.

What’s more, the horns of the Unicorn terror beast were something that could be regarded as precious.

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu simply took out two diamond skill cards from the cabinet and placed them in his pocket.

He glanced around but didn’t find a skill card that suited him or Luo Yue, so he didn’t pay much attention.

Anyway, this diamond skill card can be exchanged for points when they return back at the Sacred region academy.

“Let’s go,” Lin Xiu said.

Luo Yue nodded then walked out with Lin Xiu.

“Have a good day.” Zhang Zong looked at the Unicorn terror beast’s horn in his hand and stroked it like a treasure.

When Lin Xiu and Luo Yue walked out of the passageway, they could hear the noises coming from the outside.

“What is that?” Luo Yue said a little curiously at this time.

Although the thing Lin Xiu took looked like a broken box, Luo Yue felt that it was not that simple.

Otherwise, Lin Xiu would not have simply given the horn of the Unicorn Terror beast directly to Zhang Zong.

But Luo Yue was still a little curious; she was experienced and knowledgeable but when she saw that box just now, she couldn’t figure out why Lin Xiu wanted it.

“I don’t know either. I might find out once we go back.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

As soon as they walked out, they saw a group of warriors gathered nearby.

They glanced around the pub like they were looking for someone.

“It’s those two!!!”

The muscular man, who was sent flying by Lin Xiu previously, had a sinister expression the moment he saw Luo Yue and Lin Xiu, and pointed at them immediately.

The other warriors heard his roar and their eyes followed the direction he pointed.

“Da Li, don’t tell me this kid dealt with you eh?” An equally tall and muscular warrior said as he sized Lin Xiu up at this time.

The man who was kicked by Lin Xiu before had some bruises on his face and looked a little battered.

“Hng, I was just careless!” The man who was known as Da Li had a gloomy expression at this time.

“It seems that we are in a bit of trouble.: Lin Xiu put the box and the skill cards into his pocket then said to Luo Yue next to him.

“Just kill.” Luo Yue was still expressionless and she spoke coldly.

As soon as she said that, Da Li and the other warriors rushed towards Lin Xiu!

“Boy, go to hell!!!” Holding a Golden machete, he rushed towards Lin Xiu first.

The machete in his hand was about to be chopped down on Lin Xiu’s body! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

He has to cut Lin Xiu in half to wash away the shame!

Swish——

But when his machete stabbed towards Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu dodged it!

The machete nearly slashed Lin Xiu’s body!

Swish swish swish——

Da Li didn’t stop the movements in his hand at this time. He was now looking at Lin Xiu already burning with anger and was swinging his machete wildly like a continuous flash of cold light.

But every time Lin Xiu dodged it easily.

“Damn!!!”

When he realized that his several attacks had missed Lin Xiu, Da Li’s expression became even more sinister.

“Young lady, I suggest you’d better…” The other warriors looked at Luo Yue and when they were about to say something, Luo Yue took out a dagger from nowhere then charged towards them!

Swish——

The warrior right in front merely saw a flash of cold light and a sharp pain came from his neck.

In the next moment, blood sputtered out!

“You…”

In a blink of an eye, the man had moved to the back swiftly, but the trail of blood on his neck could still be seen.
