Chapter 1069: Dominating Skills

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

There was a bright, blinding light that came from the huge black ball that was formed by the crawling black, beetles.

What on earth was that?!

Seeing how there was a bright light coming from it, Bai Chuan seemed to have a different expression on his face.

“Bai Qiong! What’s that?!”

He turned towards the elder standing next to him before asking out loud.

“I don’t know.”

Bai Qiong shook his head.

It’s true that he could control those beetles but he really had no clue what was happening. Why was there a light coming from the huge black ball?!

Cracking – –

Then, at the very next moment, along with the bright light, they could clearly see that all of the black beetles started burning very quickly on their own.

There was a white flame that covered the beetles’ bodies.

The huge body of the beetle started falling from the sky.

As for Lin Xiu’s body, he soon reappeared when the blood sucking insect slowly fell to the ground.

“You think you can kill me with those little bugs?”

Lin Xiu stared at them and asked in a cold tone.

The looks on Bai Chuan and Bai Qiong’s face changed almost immediately.

Ye Kai looked delighted as well.

Lin Xiu was fine!

“Bai Qiong!”

Seeing what had happened to Lin Xiu, Bai Chuan was incredibly mad as he glared at Bai Qiong!

This was because when Lin Xiu had killed the men from Tang Sect, he had shown skills that were extremely powerful. After seeing what was happening here, he felt scared.

“Keep quiet!”

Bai Qiong screamed. Then, the source mark on his forehead started glowing brightly once again.

Cracking – –

Suddenly, the ground beneath them started sinking.

There were numerous huge pits that could be seen all over the ground.

Soon, there were huge black tentacles that came out from the ground.

All of them grew upwards to the sky and they were tangling themselves all over Lin Xiu’s body!

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered. As he gathered his thoughts, the long spear once again appeared on Lin Xiu’s hands.

Seeing how the tentacles were coming at him, Lin Xiu started swinging his long spear.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Before the tentacles could touch Lin Xiu, all of them had been chopped off.

Damn it!

The look in Bai Qiong’s eyes changed when he saw the tentacles being chopped off.

The sourcemark on his head was glowing brightly again and all of the tentacles that had come through the ground slowly disappeared.

Then, a huge evolved beast crawled out of the ground and flew to the sky.

This evolved beast was like a huge blak ball and there were multiple tentacles coming out of its body.

The tentacles that came out of the ground belonged to this beast.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but narrow his eyes when he saw what happened.

This thing had way too many tentacles on him and it looked disgusting.

However, Lin Xiu also understood that the power of this old man’s source mark was having control of this beast.

“Go!”

Bai Qiong sneered.

At the very next moment, the tentacles that were hanging off the beast’s body started becoming thicker.

The tentacles that had been chopped off by Lin Xiu much earlier started attacking him once again!! Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Plus, when he took a closer look, there was a faint red flow that was underneath the tentacles. It looked a little peculiar to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu frowned when he saw the tentacles coming at him. With both his hands on the long spear, he started swinging it around.

Boom boom boom – –

However, this time, the long spear might have touched the tentacles but it had failed in trying to chop it into pieces.

There were a large number of tentacles that were headed toward Lin Xiu!

They were trying to wrap itself all around Lin Xiu’s body.

Damn it!

Lin Xiu could feel it now. These red energy that were underneath the tentacles made it impossible for Lin Xiu to chop them off the beast’s body.

“Hehehe…”

Bai Qiong let out a cold laugh.

With his mind controlling the beast, these tentacles then wrapped itself all around Lin Xiu’s body.

He didn’t even give Lin Xiu the chance to release his ‘sphere’.

“You brat! You’re going to hell!”

Bai Qiong laughed.

Then, those tentacles that were tightly wrapped around Lin Xiu were twisting and turning at the same time, trying to squeeze Lin Xiu to death.

“Leave!!!”

Just when Bai Qiong thought that Lin Xiu would be dead very soon, there was a loud roar.

All of the tentacles that were wrapped around Lin Xiu exploded instantly.

Pfft – –

Bai Qiong uncontrollably spat out a mouthful of blood.

It looked as if he had been attacked by some backlash.

“This…..this is impossible.”

His eyes were opened wide and they were filled with disbelief.

His energy was linked to the evolved beast.

This was why there was red energy surrounding the tentacles on the evolved beast.

The red energy surrounding it was the reason why Lin Xiu could not chop off those tentacles.

But how was it that these tentacles that were wrapped around Lin Xiu ended up getting blasted?

“Hmph!”

Plus, as soon as Lin Xiu blasted off the tentacles that were wrapped around his body, he grabbed onto the long spear with both his hands and killed the evolved beast entirely!

The body of the evolved beast exploded immediately and the fleshes of it slowly disappeared.

An energy form?

Seeing what had happened to the beast, Lin Xiu had a different look in his eyes.

He finally figured out what it was.

This beast was something that was made out of the old man’s energy!

This was why Lin Xiu felt that something was different about it.

“Bai Qiong, you…”

Seeing how Bai Qiong’s mouth was covered in blood, Bai Chuan looked worried as well.

“Stop talking and kill him now!”

Bai Qiong wiped off the blood at the corner of his mouth and screamed.

Bai Chuan was looking uncertain as well.

He didn’t think that Bai Qiong, who was much stronger than he was, would fail to kill Lin Xiu as well.

When he thought of how Lin Xiu annihilated the whole Tang Sect and even killed all five of the sage warriors, Bai Chuan wanted to leave.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

But, at that moment, there was a huge array that appeared in the air.

These arrays covered the entire sky.

Then, a huge dome was formed in the air.

Both Bai Chuan and Bai Qiong were trapped inside it.

Bai Chuan’s pupil shrunk uncontrollably. He had a feeling that something wasn’t right and he wanted to run!

Boom – –

Just as he was about to leave, he crashed onto the array.

Damn it!

He screamed in rage. Then, he pulled out the sword from his back and started attacking the walls of the array frantically.

However, no matter how hard they tried, nothing happened to the array.

“Useless!”

Bai Qiong looked at Bai Chuan who wanted to run and he couldn’t help but feel mad.

Then, he gathered his thoughts together and tried to use the energy from his source mark.
