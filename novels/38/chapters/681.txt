Lin Xiu said camly before raising his glass and finishing it. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Let’s have some food then. Please help yourself.”

Mother Liu said enthusiastically.

Lin Xiu nodded his head. He was indeed hungry and decided to enjoy the feast that had been laid out.

“Brother Lin, are you from planet earth?”

As they continued eating, Father Liu asked.

“Yes.”

Lin Xiu answered.

“I’m just curious. Do you have any reason why you are here in Marqi? If there’s anything that we can do for you, please let me know.”

Father Liu smiled as he offered.

His smile was genuine and it made Lin Xiu feel comfortable.

“I’m looking for someone.”

Lin Xiu said flatly.

“Our planet is slightly more complicated than Earth but thank god, we do not have many cities. If the person that you are looking for is in this city, it shouldn’t be difficult.”

“She is in Fengyun City.”

Lin Xiu said.

“Fengyun City?”

Father Lu was stunned. He frowned and said, “If it’s Fengyun City, it might be a bit more difficult.”

“Because of the warrior competition that will be happening soon. It may be a little more difficult to go to Fengyun City.”

“En. I understand. I am going to be participating in that competition as well.”

Lin Xiu answered honestly.

“Oh? But…you would have to be below 25 years old….”

“HAHAHAHAH….YOU?! You want to join the warrior competition?

Don’t make a joke out of yourself!”

Right then, a loud voice came from behind the door.

“Liu Cheng?!”

Liu Yanran’s face changed when she heard the voice.

“Ah Cheng, why are you here?”

Father Liu’s face changed as well when he saw Liu Cheng walking into the dining hall with a huge group of people.

“Second uncle, this man injured my men. I would have to be here.” Liu Cheng said flatly.

The man slightly sneaked a peek behind him. When he saw how Lin Xiu had picked up the glass and was enjoying his wine, he couldn’t help but shiver.

He could still remember how Lin Xiu almost broke both of his arms.

“Liu Cheng, don’t cause any trouble.”

Liu Yanran had an ugly look on her face.

LiOCheng has been looking for trouble on multiple occasions and now she is getting mad.

“Me? Causing trouble? You’re the one who brought back a man. Why are you judging me?!”

Liu Cheng laughed.

When the Liu parents heard Liu Cheng, their faces turned pale.

But, Liu Cheng is the first male descendant of the Liu family. On the Marqi planet, men are more important than women,

Plus, Liu Cheng would be the next head of the Liu family. Even if they were unhappy with them, they couldn’t say anything to him.

“What do you want?’

Liu Yanran bit her lips and asked Liu Cheng.

“The Liu mansion isn’t for anyone. Get him out of here.”

Liu Cheng sneered.

He had come all the way here for this. It wasn’t only Lin Xiu that he wanted to be embarrassed. He wanted to embarrass Liu Yanran as well.

“Don’t you know that earthlings and dogs aren’t allowed to enter the Liu family?”

Liu Cheng walked towards Liu Cheng and said to Lin Xiu in a soft, low tone.

“Say that again.”

After hearing what he said, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed. He suddenly stood up and grabbed onto Liu Cheng’s throat, lifting him off the ground.

When everyone else saw what was happening, all of them were shocked.

Especially for Liu Cheng. He widened his eyes in surprise as he stared at Lin Xiu.

He didn’t expect Lin Xiu to do such things! This is the Liu household!

“Let me….go…”

Liu Xiu was struggling, trying to escape from Lin Xiu’s grasp but his hands were like a metal claw. It was impossible for him to move.

“Brother Lin, please calm down!”

When Father Liu saw what happened, he was shocked as well.

Liu Cheng was someone extremely important in the Liu family. This was because his father was Liu Long, the head of the Liu family!

If anything were to happen to Liu Cheng, they would be in big trouble. “I would be able to rush rubbish like you with a single finger.”

Lin Xiu looked at Liu Cheng, who was like a chicken being lifted by the neck as he said coldly.

Boom

Then, Lin Xiu threw him to the side just like an unwanted rubbish. He landed hard onto the ground and rolled a few times on the ground.

“Kill him! Get rid of him!!!”

Liu Cheng crawled on himself as he got onto his feet. He was panting as he screamed.

When the men heard what Liu Cheng ordered, all of them had a sharp look on their faces as they rushed towards Lin Xiu!

The dishes that were on the table all fell onto the ground.

Liu Xiu sneered and moved aside. After dodging one of their attacks, he threw a punch onto another man who was trying to attack him. This threw the man into a distance!

Lin Xiu’s punch was not a normal punch. ‘Rupturing Fist’ was now at its peak after practising. With one punch, the man’s bones were crushed into ashes.

A few seconds later, the warriors who were around Lin Xiu had all been pushed away by Lin Xiu, lying onto the ground. They couldn’t even move and were wailing in pain.

“That’s all you got?”

Then, Lin Xiu looked at Liu Chen who was standing far away and started walking towards him.

Liu Yanran’s parents were completely shocked by the scene. They didn’t think that Lin Xiu could be so powerful.

It should be noted that Liu Cheng is a rank 7 warrior. As for his men, all of them were also rank 7 warriors but even so, all of them were easily defeated by Lin Xiu.

“This is the Liu family! How could you do this to me?! You will die in vain

When Liu Cheng saw Lin Xiu walking towards him, his body started shivering and he was frightened.

‘Do you think that I would be afraid?”

As Lin Xiu walked towards him with his black spear and aimed it towards Liu Cheng’s forehead!

“No!!!”

Lin Xiu’s spear was moving too quickly. He was so fast that the rest of them could only see a flash of lightning. The tip of his spear was already right in front of him.

As he stared at the sharp spear, Liu Cheng’s body shivered and he passed out from the fear of it.

Plus, there was a pool of water around his feet.

He was so scared that he wet himself.

“Such a pussy!”

Lin Xiu gave a cold laugh.

As he turned around, Lin Xiu smiled and said, “Excuse me. Looks like I won’t be able to stay here any further.”

Liu Cheng has been causing problems for them multiple times. Lin Xiu has already been unhappy with him and wanted to kill him but with the current situation, he wouldn’t be able to do so.
