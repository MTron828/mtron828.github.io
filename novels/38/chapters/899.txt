Chapter 900: Those from the Elder’s Home

Zhao Yong Yuan looked at Lin Xiu as he asked the question.

It was obvious that he knew what was on Lin Xiu’s mind.

“I’m ready.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he answered the old man.

“Zhao Qi, from now onwards, will work together with Yongyuan.”

He looked at Zhao Qi and gave his commands.

“Yes, Young Master!”

Zhao Qi answered immediately.

He was feeling a little lost. The descendant of the Ye family has returned and he even brought along the Imperial Order.

He has been doing according to the orders of his ancestors, obeying to the commands of the man who had the Imperial Order.

Even when he had no idea what the ending of it would be.

The Bai family has been growing relentlessly in the Nanor Planet and it would be impossible for them to defeat the Bai family.

However, if Lin Xiu was able to lead them to success in destroying the Bai family, the Zhao family would then leap ahead of the others as well.

This was an opportunity. It would either make or break the entire Zhao family.

“Young Master, would you be leaving for Wildfire City now?”

Zhao Qi hesitated for a little while before asking.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

He has already accomplished the things that he had planned earlier and would like to see what he could find in Wildfire City.

According to what Zhao Qi had told him, the Wildfire City has the largest intelligence agency on the planet.

Perhaps, he would be able to find what he needed in that city.

“Please give us a minute. I will be arranging for the best mechanical mount for you to ride to the city.”

Zhao Qi nodded his head before leaving.

“En.”

While waiting for Zhao Qi to arrange for the mechanical mount, Lin Xiu walked into the courtyard and saw Zhao Xiaoqing.

Zhao Xiaoqing was aimlessly walking back and forth in the courtyard.

When she noticed Lin Xiu next to her, her eyes were immediately filled with fear.

“What’s wrong? Are you afraid of me?”

Lin Xiu found her expression humourous and chuckled as he spoke to the young girl.

“Young Master.”

Zhao Xiaoqing seemed to have figured out what had happened as well and quickly greeted Lin Xiu.

She had no idea that Lin Xiu was the secret that the family had been protecting. He was the descendant of the Ye family.

Crack crack – –

At that moment, the sound of a mechanical mount slowly approached them.

When they turned around, they saw an android battle horse that was walking towards them. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Young Master, this is the most advanced android battle horse that we could find in this city. It has the fastest speed. You should be able to reach Wildfire City within 2 days.”

Zhao Lin walked into the courtyard with an android battle horse.

“Alright. I will be leaving now.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“There is already food and drinks prepared for you.”

Zhao Lin continued speaking to Lin Xiu.

“Alright.”

There was a small computer attached to the horse and there was a map displayed on it.

This android battle horse would bring Lin Xiu directly to Wildfire City.

“Young Master, this is news about the Huang family from Wildfire City. There is also a letter here. Pass it to the Huang family and they will know what to do.”

Zhao Qi passed a handwritten letter over to Lin Xiu.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu took the letter and nodded his head once again.

He placed the letter in his pocket and was about to leave on his android battle horse.

Crack crack – –

Suddenly, there were footsteps coming from behind them.

“What’s going on?”

When Zhao Qi heard the footsteps, he couldn’t help but frown.

“Those from the elder’s home seem to have returned.”

Zhao Lin answered instead.

Those from the elder’s home?

“Zhao Qi, Zhao Lin....what do you think you’re doing?”

Then, an old man’s voice came from a distance.

Lin Xiu took a good look at it and he could see that there were several elders walking towards them.

Following behind them were a few young warriors.

They were all dressed in white and had strong, sharp weapons in their hands.

Lin Xiu activated his analytical eyes and knew that all of them were warrior kings.

As for the elders in front, they were at their peaks.

“Old man, what are you saying?”

Zhao Qi seemed to be mad at what the old man had just said.

He was the lead of the Zhao family now but the elder’s home still had a huge say when it came to their family matter which was why Zhao Qi was furious.

“Do you really believe that this man is the descendant of the Ye family?”

The old man pointed at Lin Xiu.

It seemed like they already knew what was happening.

“Have you forgotten the words of our ancestors?”

Zhao Qi frowned and asked in a cold tone.

“The Imperial Order. I want to see the Imperial Order.”

The old man did not move and demanded to see the Imperial Order.

“Zhao Kun, enough!”

Zhao Qi tried to stop him.

“That man is called Zhao Kun from the elder’s home. Every decision made for the Zhao family has to be approved by the elder’s home. The head of the family is not allowed to decide on his own.”

Zhao Xiaoqing, who was standing next to Lin Xiu, whispered to him.

Lin Xiu slightly nodded his head.

“I just wanted to see the Imperial Order. How could you simply make a decision that could greatly affect the Zhao family?!”

Zhao Qi and Zhao Kun were glaring at each other and none of them were willing to back down.

“You...”

Zhao Qi was furious when he heard what Zhao Kun said.

“This is the Imperial Order.”

Lin Xiu stood out and took out the Imperial Order from his pocket before showing it to Zhao Kun.

When Zhao Kun saw the Imperial Order, his pupil shook.

“Give it to me. I want to take a closer look.”

Zhao Kun continued demanding for the Imperial Order.

Then, Lin Xiu threw the Imperial Order to Zhao Kun.

Boom – –

Zhao Kun caught the Imperial Order. He gathered energy from his body and transferred it onto the Imperial Order.

Soon, the imperial order started glowing with a bright white light.

Then, there was a huge projection of the word ‘Ye’ in the air.

“That’s enough?”

Lin Xiu asked calmly.

The look in Zhao Kun’s eyes took a turn. Suddenly, he stared at Lin Xiu with murderous eyes and said, “This is a fake! Kill him!”

“Don’t you dare!”

Zhao Qi and Zhao Lin had a change of expression when they heard what Zhao Kun said.

“Zhao Qi, do not believe this man. He is a fake!”

Zhao Kun screamed. He quickly placed the Imperial Order into his pocket and pulled out his sword.

He held onto his sword and rushed towards Lin Xiu.

He wanted to finish Lin Xiu with one blow!

Lin Xiu remained motionless on the spot as if he couldn’t react.

As for Zhao Xiaoqing, she was shocked as well.

There was a terrifying sword aura coming from him. Zhao Xiaoqing, who was standing some distance away, could already feel the pricking pain that was coming from it.

All of a sudden, a mind blowing thing happened!
