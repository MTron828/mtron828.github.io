Chapter 496: Tiger Mercenary Group

Lin Xiu was a little dumbfounded. That was a huge amount of union coins, too many to count the number of digits.

He didn’t expect that Luo Yue was a little rich woman!

“I got them from completing tasks before.” Luo Yue said flatly.

It was not only Lin Xiu, but some people around with good sight also saw the balance displayed on the phone when Luo Yue was transferring money to the merchant.

Although they couldn’t see the specific numbers, they could see that there were countless digits in a row and knew that she must have a lot of union coins.

Some people with bad intentions had a change in expression at this time.

“Is it all right now?” Luo Yue glanced at the merchant holding the ‘Absorb’ card, then said faintly.

“Yes, yes, I’ll give it to you.” The merchant was elated at this time. This skill card was discovered by chance in a ruin somewhere and it didn’t cost anything. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He sold it for more than 30 million now, how could he not be happy!

At this moment, he was all smiles, then he held the skill card in both hands and presented it to Luo Yue.

Luo Yue took the skill card, then said to Lin Xiu, “Let’s go.”

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu nodded. Although there were a lot of things sold here and quite a number of weird things, there weren’t many things that were useful to Lin Xiu and nothing caught his eye.

“Damn it!” The man who just made a bid to buy this ‘Absorb’ skill card, balled his hands into fists and looked at the retreating backs of Luo Yue and Lin Xiu, shaking with anger.

He had been coveting that skill card for a long time and was about to get it but he didn’t expect that Luo Yue would actually get in his way!

How could this not make him feel angry?

“Mr. Liu Zong.” At this moment, a group of people walked over from the other side. The leader was a bald man and the flesh on his cheeks made him look very sinister when he smiled.

“You are…” When someone called his name, the man was startled and didn’t seem to know the man in front of him.

“Lin Zhen, head of the Tiger Mercenary Group.” The bald man grinned at this moment, showing two rows of slightly yellowed teeth.

The Tiger Mercenary Group?!

Hearing this name, the look in Liu Zong’s eyes couldn’t help but change.

Although he didn’t see the members of this mercenary group, he had heard of them.

This was a strong mercenary group entrenched in Bai Di City and it was said that there were also rank 6 warriors in it!

This mercenary group often entered dangerous areas to obtain some rare objects, then put them up in the black market here.

He did not expect that he would actually see these people today and this bald man turned out to be their leader!

This guy is a rank 6 warrior, right?

With this thought, Liu Zong became respectful. Although he has a lot of money, he couldn’t compare with this rank 6 warrior.

“Mr. Lin, I wonder what’s the matter?” Liu Zong said respectfully to him.

“Did you want that skill card just now?” Lin Zhen looked at Liu Zong and said aloud.

“That’s right.” There was nothing to hide so Liu Zong nodded.

“Would you want it if I got the skill card back and sold it to you?” Lin Zhen looked at Liu Zong and said aloud.

Liu Zong was stunned, then looked at the ferocious-looking members of the Tiger Mercenary Group and quickly realized what they wanted to do.

Liu Zong hesitated, then gritted his teeth and said, “Yes!”

“I will give you 20 million union coins!”

“Well, sure, wait for my news.” Lin Zhen nodded, then patted his shoulder and said aloud.

He obviously didn’t want this silver skill card but he noticed the balance displayed on Luo Yue’s phone just now.

The sight of this rank 6 warrior was very good and the balance shown on it was tens of billions of Union coins!

For a rank 6 warrior, tens of billions was still a large number!

“Seems like someone has his eyes on us.” When Lin Xiu and Luo Yue walked to the other side of the street, Lin Xiu raised his brows, then said faintly.

When Luo Yue transferred the money to the merchant boss, Lin Xiu felt that many people revealed a look of greed.

“Just kill.” Luo Yue didn’t say much. As far as she was concerned, anything that threatened her would be dealt with directly.

If one sword didn’t work, then two swords!

Lin Xiu blushed with shame – this chick is a really violent person.

When they walked to the front, the surrounding environment became a little different.

If the outer area looked like a metropolis with a sci-fi style, this place was as if you were in a slum in the sci-fi world.

The steel-made houses around seemed to have become rusty due to the passage of time.

“Here you go.” When they were walking on this street, Luo Yue handed Lin Xiu the silver skill card.

“Huh?” Lin Xiu was taken aback and hadn’t come to his senses yet.

“You learn it.” Luo Yue said lightly.

“You don’t want it?” Lin Xiu was a little puzzled now. He thought Luo Yue bought this skill card because she wanted it?

“I bought it for you.” Luo Yue said.

“I know this skill.”

“You do?” Before Lin Xiu came to his senses, Luo Yue had taken out an odd crystal and looked at Lin Xiu, “Look.”

As Luo Yue spoke, the odd crystal instantly turned into a transparent glass-like thing.

“Damn!” Lin Xiu’s eyes widened when he saw this scene.

Because Lin Xiu noticed that Luo Yue had completely absorbed the energy from this odd crystal in an instant!

“This is the effect of ‘cultivation technique’ in conjunction with ‘absorb’.”

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu who was in shock and said softly.

Using ‘Cultivation Technique’ not only could absorb the energy in the air, but also the energy in the Odd crystals but generally speaking, the absorption speed was very slow. He didn’t expect that Luo Yue managed to absorb all the energy in an Odd crystal in a blink of an eye!

You must know that after the energy of the Odd crystal is absorbed, part of it penetrates into your cells to improve and evolve your cells and the other part will become source strength for storage in the warrior’s body.

If it could be absorbed so quickly, then as long as there were odd crystals around during battle, one’s source strength would never deplete!?
