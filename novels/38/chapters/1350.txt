1351 Purple Winged Bat

Hearing Lu Guangyue’s words, Lin Xiu was slightly taken aback.

“I can see that you are different from them and you are not here for rewards.”

Lu Guangyue said lightly at this time.

“Of course I came here for the rewards.”

!!

Lin Xiu smiled.

At first he wasn’t, but after he heard that the reward was the so-called Divine soul water, he also became interested.

This kind of liquid that can nourish the Divine soul is also effective for him.

Lu Guangyue took a look at Lin Xiu and continued to walk forward without saying anything.

Ci ci-

Just as he walked to the front, he could clearly hear strange noises.

“what sound is that?!”

When some warriors heard these voices, they immediately pricked up their ears and looked around.

They clenched the weapons in their hands tightly and they looked around.

Although they are warriors at the level of God warrior, in the strange environment of Netherworld Forest, everyone’s perception seems to be restricted.

Now they have no way to expand their perception and find out what was it that was coming over.

And at this moment, that strange noise came again.

A black shadow passed by in an instant.

“A bat!”

One of the men seemed to sense something and said immediately.

“Hmph! Are you all afraid of this kind of thing?”

Another God warrior-level warrior, holding a saber in his hand, slashed toward the front!

boom–

This bat, at this moment, was chopped in half by the warrior.

Some viscous purple liquid also splashed on the ground.

“Don’t kill!”

Just as Lu Guangyue spoke, he discovered that the bat-like creature had already been killed.

“It’s just a purple-winged bat.”

The warrior who had just killed the purple-winged bat curled his lips in dissatisfaction.

Woo woo woo——

But the moment he finished speaking, an even weirder sound came over.

“Damn… what kind of sound is this…”

As soon as these voices sounded, everyone felt waves of pain in their heads.

Head, it hurts, it hurts!

Not only those people, but even Lin Xiu obviously felt uncomfortable.

These voices seemed to penetrate their heads and be transmitted to their minds.

“It’s coming.”

Soon, Lin Xiu seemed to sense something and his eyes changed slightly.

A large number of purple-winged bats rushed out from all directions.

Boom——

Lin Xiu stretched out his right hand and a lotus flame appeared in his hand.

Go!

With a wave of Lin Xiu’s right hand, these lotus fires rushed toward the group of purple-winged bats in front of them.

After the seemingly small lotus fire collided with the purple-winged bat over there, a loud sound erupted immediately.

Boom——

It’s like an oil barrel exploding.

Suddenly there was a sea of flames.

A large number of purple-winged bats were directly burned to slag.

On the other hand, those God warriors also resisted the severe pain in their heads and waved the weapons in their hands.

Bang bang bang——

A large number of purple-winged bats were killed.

Poof——

But the warrior who was the first to kill the purple-winged bat just now spat out a mouthful of blood.

He felt severe pain in his head.

It was as if it was about to explode.

...

At this time, his body’s movements also became sluggish. Looking at the purple-winged bats that were constantly charging toward him, he wanted to spread out his ‘Sphere’ to resist, but it was too late.

Because at that moment, a large number of purple-winged bats flew onto his body.

These purple-winged bats all had sharp fangs and they bit down on his body right now.

“Quanlin!”

Another warrior who obviously knew him also noticed this scene at this time and his expression changed drastically.

These purple-winged bats that absorbed the blood of the God warrior became golden-glowing at this moment.

“Quick, kill it!”

When Lu Guangyue turned around and saw this scene, her expression changed drastically.

Holding a saber, he slashed across the air!

Whoosh whoosh——

A burst of terrifying sword energy burst out, then charged toward the purple-winged bat crawling on the warrior’s body.

...

Quite a few purple-winged bats were cut in half by the terrifying sword energy.

As for the other ones, their bodies were already glowing with golden light and they looked even stronger.

“Quanlin…”

These warriors looked at the body of the God warrior just now, it has been sucked by those purple-winged bats until it looks like a dried-up human being.

It was extremely terrifying.

Woo woo woo——

And at this time, the remaining purple-winged bats seemed to start making weird noises again.

It was as if these sounds had penetrated into their heads, making them feel extremely uncomfortable.

At this time, Lin Xiu moved his body and rushed toward the front.

At this moment, the source strength of the body has gathered in the fist.

Facing those purple-winged bats that were obviously making weird noises, they punched them with a fist!

Bang bang bang——

Although the fists did not directly hit the bodies of these purple-winged bats, the terrifying impact directly crushed their bodies into pieces of flesh.

As a large number of purple-winged bats died, the headache-causing sound seemed to disappear slowly.

“Damn it!”

Some warriors also came back to their senses at this time, frantically waving the weapons in their hands,

Some warriors also used the energy of the fire attribute to burn those purple-winged bats continuously.

“Burn that warrior’s body too.”

Lu Guangyue glanced at one of the warriors and said to him.

“Why?”

The warrior was taken aback for a moment, then subconsciously said.

Those who have been bitten by creatures may become undead creatures.

Lu Guangyue said coldly.

“Which means that he may become the same skeleton man as we came in just now?”

Lin Xiu said to Lu Guangyue curiously.

“How did you think those skeletons get here?”

Lu Guangyue said lightly.

Those skeletons were all warriors who came and died in this Netherworld. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“So, I tell you to be careful, otherwise, you will become like him.”

As soon as Lu Guangyue finished speaking, the next moment, the warrior who had turned into a dried corpse stood up instantly.

Opening his mouth wide, he was about to bite another warrior.

“Fuck!”

The warrior was shocked when he saw this scene. Holding a long spear in his hand, it pierced through his head in an instant.

But even after piercing his head, his hands and feet seem to be able to move.

“Damn it!”

Another warrior cursed secretly and with a wave of his right hand, the terrifying fiery red flames hit the body of the warrior who had turned into a corpse.
