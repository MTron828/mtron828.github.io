1377 The Hunt

What’s happening?!

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank subconsciously.

He didn’t even have the time to react and was already pulled by the overpowering force!

“This…”

Lin Xiu took a look around him. He could clearly see that there were no warriors around where he was.

This should still be a part of the Misty Forest.

He could only assume this because there aren’t many changes to his surroundings.

Lin Xiu subconsciously touched his forehead and the rune was still there.

“So….they’re playing it this way in the Misty Forest?”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

There was also white mist that slowly appeared everywhere.

His vision was slowly hindered by the white smoke.

Even if they were warrior gods, it would still be impossible for anyone to see things that were far into the distance.

Lin Xiu grabbed onto his gold spear before slowly walking forward.

Due to the smoke around him, Lin Xiu had no idea where he was.

Plus, the trees around him looked exactly the same.

Therefore, even when Lin Xiu was moving forward, it felt as if he was marching on the spot.

Xiu – –

Then, at the very next moment, Lin Xiu heard a weird sound and his body disappeared instantly.

The spot where Lin Xiu was standing earlier was replaced by a deep dent after a laser beam had hit it.

“You’re quick.”

Seeing how Lin Xiu’s body appeared on the opposite side, the warrior who had a gun in his hands walked out.

That’s when Lin Xiu noticed that there were two marks on his head.

This man has already killed another warrior?

Lin Xiu raised his brows.

Plus, the gun in his hand did not seem like a simple one.

It seemed like it was something formed with his source energy.

“Just hand over the energy rune. You don’t belong here.”

The man glared at Lin Xiu and threatened him.

“I should be the one telling you that.”

Lin Xiu had already activated his Analytic Eye and was aware of the abilities of this man.

“Huh?”

The man showed a cold smile and then, he pulled the trigger on his gun, aiming it at Lin Xiu.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

There was a colourful laser beam that was headed straight for Lin Xiu’s head!

It was quick and there was a burnt smell in the air.

Lin Xiu let out a cold laugh and started moving the gold spear in his hands.

‘Adjudication’!

The laser beam that was supposed to be headed for Lin Xiu suddenly turned around and was coming back at him!

This is impossible!

The man had a different look on his face after seeing what had happened.

The laser beam came back as quickly as how he fired it and he almost got hit by it.

He had no other choice but to gather the energy in his body and quickly release his ‘sphere’.

Boom boom boom – –

With a soft groan, the man managed to stop the laser beams with his ‘sphere’.

“Catapult The Sky!!!”

Now, he dare not be careless with Lin Xiu.

The man decided to use his most powerful warrior skills.

His body started moving.

As he moved, the gun in his hand shot out numerous laser beams and all of them were headed for Lin Xiu from all directions!

Lin Xiu remained on the same spot and he did not move. As he continued swinging the spear, he managed to block all of the laser beams that were coming at him.

The spear that was golden in colour may seem lame but it was still made of great materials.

Lin Xiu was able to block every attack with the spear.

Then, Lin Xiu also got his chance to retaliate as soon as the attacks were over.

...

Xiu – –

The energy from his body quickly got transferred over to the spear and a sharp pierce was thrusted forward.

Boom – –

Although the man had already released his ‘sphere’, Lin Xiu was still able to pierce through his body.

“That’s….impossible!”

Lin Xiu’s spear has just cut through his tough ‘sphere’ and through his chest!

He thought that Lin Xiu was a newbie and with the thick mist around them, he would be able to finish Lin Xiu with one move.

“Well, when you have to fight with an expert, you are indeed still a child.”

Lin Xiu gave a cold comment and pulled out the spear from his chest.

Thud – –

The man’s body fell on the ground and the energy rune on his head got transferred over to Lin Xiu.

...

“I have three now? That’s easy.”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

Killing the warrior god did not bring him much EXP and Lin Xiu was a little disappointed.

He would either have to kill someone extraordinarily strong or absorb a huge energy source in order to gain enough EXP.

He was now at seventy percent.

It would be possible that he could get to level 74 while he’s in the ruins!

He was already a warrior god at level 70. Could there be a chance that he would be God King at level 75?

As Lin Xiu thought about it, he started feeling excited.

He swung the golden swung in his arm to clean off the blood before moving forward.

He had no idea how big this forest was but since there were 5 thousand warrior gods here, it would be easy to meet one, right?

Although he didn’t have a clear vision, he still had a great sense of his surroundings.

Lin Xiu had then released his sensory energy, hoping to find the other warriors.

Boom boom boom – –

On the other side, there were continuous explosions.

It was obvious that there were warriors fighting on the other side and the warrior skills released were the ones causing the explosion.

Lin Xiu hesitated for a little before heading to where the noise was coming from.

Perhaps he’ll be able to find an opportunity there.

“Damn it!”

On the other hand, Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng were in a difficult fight.

Both of them were up against 5 warrior gods and were continuously getting attacked.

Yuan Zheng had a horrible look on his face. They had thought that they were lucky since they quickly met up after being separated. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

They thought that they could team up to quickly gather 5 energy runes but they didn’t think that they would run into a team of 5 warrior gods working together!
