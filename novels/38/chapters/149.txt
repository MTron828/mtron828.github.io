Chapter 150: Grand Prize! Another Grand Prize!!!

“You mean…”

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide and revealed a shy look as he replied her:

“Are we moving too fast?”

“The house has two floors.” Luo Yue glanced at him and replied indifferently, as though understanding his thoughts.

“…” Lin Xiu with his evil thoughts drooped his head low.

“Give me 250 points.” Luo Yue told him. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Can we transfer the points?” Lin Xiu was startled while holding his card. But in the next moment, Luo Yue took it and slotted it into a machine at the side. After pressing on a few buttons, she turned to him: “Give your confirmation.”

He took a look and saw that it required fingerprint confirmation.

“Please confirm if you want to transfer 250 points”

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment then extended his hand onto the screen. After a ‘ding’, the point transfer was completed.

“Right, we can all share to pay the rent and afford better housing!” Zhang Yin and the others exclaimed happily.

If that was the case, they could greatly decrease the number of points consumed per person.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue headed towards their villa.

The villa was situated at the peak of a hill and had a good view.

When they looked down, they would see Sacred Region Academy’s entrance.

At the tall entrance was a rank 9 evolved beast that stood atop the stone door, as though it was standing guard.

“I’m taking the top floor.” Luo Yue gave Lin Xiu a glance before heading up.

Lin Xiu smirked. The ground floor had a large hall and a small training ground.

There were many equipment, battle strength computation apparatus as well as strength test machines, etc.

The ground floor had a small room that was extremely simple, but it was clean and relatively new.

Lin Xiu placed his bag on the table in the corner, the spear sheathed at the side, and he gradually relaxed himself.

Rollie jumped out of the bag.

As though happy with its new surroundings, it ran about on the table.

Lin Xiu saw a card groove on the table and hesitated for a moment before slotting his card in.

A projected screen appeared in an instant.

Sacred Region Academy’s website was extremely mysterious, it could only be accessed by scanning the card or slotting the card in.

After taking a look around, he found a page that was similar to a shopping center on the website.

Sacred Region Academy had everything of the outside world

“Diamond skill?!”

Lin Xiu clicked onto the skills section and immediately discovered a current sale for diamond skills.

And there were many diamond skills but the astronomical points required to purchase them left him astounded.

1 million points!

How the hell can someone earn so much, we don’t even have enough for a month now.

He continued on and opened the map of Sacred Region Academy. Very quickly, a 3d projection appeared.

Following Lin Xiu’s finger movements, the entirety of the place was revealed.

Lin Xiu could not help but take in a breath.

Sacred Region Academy is actually so big, it’s equivalent to the size of a small city.

Lin Xiu also noticed that Sacred Region Academy was segregated to the south and north campus.

The south should be for study while the north will be for fights.

The highest point of Sacred Region Academy was a gigantic field with a large screen.

It was said that there were various ranking boards for combat strength, skills, etc. Only the top 10 were able to get on the ranking boards.

“How to earn points.” Lin Xiu thought for a moment, then keyed in the words into the search bar.

A list of missions appeared.

As I’ve guessed, it’s like that. This is the way to earn points here.

The 500 points are the most basic.

“Chopping down firewood two hours a day provides 100 points each time.”

“Training companion, 1 hour a day, provides 150 points each time.”

“Working in the kitchen, 3 hours a day, provides 100 points each time.”

What kind of missions are these!

Lin Xiu frowned at the sight of the missions. It seemed as though that aside from the regular missions assigned by the academy, anyone could come up with their own missions.

But creating a mission required some points as well.

Lin Xiu found out that there was even an exchange center, aside from using points to exchange for things, they could use the exchange center to sell things for points.

Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up.

Aside from leveling up to increase his strength quickly, Lin Xiu could resort to absorbing energy from odd crystals and improve his body.

“I should draw a prize first.” He closed the computer.

Lin Xiu entered the system in his mind.

The counter at the familiar turntable revealed the number: 4.

I have four chances, I will get to spin it once more next month.

He looked at the prizes on the turntable carefully and did not discover anything new.

After hesitating for a moment, he decided to have a go at it.

The first draw was a rank 3 odd crystal, the second was a silver skill card, and the third was a potential pill.

“Damn!”

Lin Xiu did not know whether to laugh or cry at the draws.

The three draws yielded rubbish.

Lin Xiu obtained 5 stat points after consuming the potential pill. He added all of them into strength without hesitation.

Should I use my last draw?

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment, gritted his teeth, then clicked the draw prize button.

There were 2 sections that had good rewards, one was ‘multiple odd crystals’ and the other was ‘Grand Prize’.

Lin Xiu wanted either one.

He knew that ‘multiple odd crystals’ had the probability of obtaining high-rank Odd Crystals!

“Stop! Stop!” Lin Xiu clenched his fists in suspense.

As the turntable spun rapidly for a while, the speed gradually slowed down.

Very quickly, the needle pointed to the union coins section.

“Damn it!” Lin Xiu’s heart jumped when he saw that and was about to curse. Union coins were useless now!

But the needle did not stop.

It gradually pointed to the extremely small section.

“Congratulations Master for obtaining the Grand Prize!”

Grand Prize! Another Grand Prize!!!
