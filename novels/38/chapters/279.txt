Chapter 280: Rest!

“Wait!”

At the same time, on the other side.

Not long after those warriors left, the man leading suddenly thought of something and stopped.

He now realized that what happened just now seemed a bit weird.

It shouldn’t be like this.

If Lin Xiu was so strong, why would he simply let them go?

This was absolutely impossible.

Thinking about it now, he had a sudden realization.

It was very likely that Lin Xiu had used all his strength to kill Scar and was already an arrow at the end of its flight.

He deliberately appeared strong in order to scare them away.

With that thought, his body trembled with anger.

“Let’s go!”

Following the man’s roar, the other warriors also came to their senses and realized that something was off just now.

At this moment, these people returned directly to the same place just now.

The huge corpse of the Black Rock Beast was still at the same spot and exuded a foul smell.

Once this thing was dead, its body seemed to decay quickly.

“They seem to be gone.”

The men looked around and they did not see Lin Xiu and the others.

“Give chase! After that guy killed Scar, he must have exhausted all his energy. If we find him now, we can definitely kill him!” The man was leading said with a gloomy expression at this time.

He had no idea that he had just been tricked by Lin Xiu and they probably had already gone far.

It might not be so easy to find them.

But no matter what, he couldn’t take this lying down. He must kill Lin Xiu and the rest!!!

Of course, Lin Xiu and the others didn’t know what was happening here. At this moment, they were still walking.

Lin Xiu looked across and suddenly realized that there was a small river in front.

The flowing water was pattering.

“Let’s rest here tonight.” Guo Ling stepped forward, then looked around and found that there were no evolved beasts or anything threatening.

At the river in front, there were also some black rocks where they could sit and rest.

Lin Xiu sat down next to a withered black tree and took out a bottle of nourishment liquid from his backpack.

The rest also did the same.

As ordinary food was more troublesome to carry around, drinking this nourishment liquid gave them a lot of nutrition and energy.

The downside was that it didn’t taste very pleasant.

Everyone sat on the rock and began to rest. They were not only physically fatigued, but also mentally drained.

After all, this Dark Forest was too depressing.

After drinking the awful nourishment liquid, Lin Xiu began to sit down cross-legged and practiced the ‘Cultivation technique’.

The air in the Dark Forest was filled with strong energy for some reason.

Under this condition, Lin Xiu was also able to absorb energy rapidly.

While absorbing the energy in the air and strengthening his body, Lin Xiu recalled what happened today.

It has been a day since they entered the Dark Forest, but they still didn’t encounter many warriors which was very strange.

Could it be that they were still at the border of the Dark Forest?

Were there more warriors in the middle of the Dark Forest?

And Lin Xiu thought of Luo Yue at this time. There were so many warriors who were rank 6 and above. If she had already entered, would she be in danger?

While Lin Xiu was deep in thoughts, he suddenly felt something and opened his eyes, then found Guo Ling standing in front of him.

“What’s the matter?”

Seeing Guo Ling’s face, Lin Xiu asked.

“Your reaction ability is really strong.” Guo Ling got a shock when Lin Xiu suddenly opened his eyes, but he smiled after that.

Not very strong but extremely strong and it was a little terrifying.

“We should be able to reach the place where there are the most Black tooth spiders by tomorrow evening.” Guo Ling said to Lin Xiu.

“Tomorrow evening? Is this Dark Forest so big?” Lin Xiu was a little surprised.

It was hard to imagine how big this Dark Forest was.

“En, tomorrow’s journey is probably more difficult.” Guo Ling nodded and said. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Have you been there before?” Guo Ling seemed to be familiar with the topography of this Dark Forest and Lin Xiu couldn’t help but ask.

Guo Ling glanced at Lin Xiu, did not hide anything and nodded directly.

“When I was in my freshman year, I came here with my sophomore seniors.” Guo Ling said and her expression seemed to turn gloomy.

She looked at the sky and continued, “But in the end, I was the only one who managed to leave.”

She was the only one?

Lin Xiu also seemed surprised after hearing her words.

“Something happened that time, but this time, we should all be able to leave safely.” Guo Ling seemed reluctant to talk about what happened previously and smiled.

Lin Xiu nodded. Although he was a little curious about what happened to Guo Ling there, Guo Ling was obviously unwilling to talk about it so Lin Xiu did not continue to probe.

“I just want to tell you that we will leave at six o’clock in the morning. You should rest well.” Guo Ling chuckled lightly, then sat on the rock next to Lin Xiu and began to practice ‘Cultivation Technique’, absorbing the energy in the air.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and also entered the ‘Cultivation technique’ state.

Time flew by quickly. Because of the bright lighting equipment, it seemed that no evolved beast approached their area.

This was because the evolved beasts here were either afraid of fire or light.

When Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, he realized that the sky was already getting brighter.

Not just Lin Xiu, the others seemed to have opened their eyes too.

As he drank the nourishment liquid last night, Lin Xiu didn’t feel hungry at this time.

This special nourishment liquid could provide energy and one didn’t have to eat until tomorrow.

“Once we’re ready, we should set off. We should be able to get there by evening.” Guo Ling stretched and said.

Qiu Li and the others nodded at this time.

With Guo Ling leading in front, they began their journey again.

As they went deeper into the Dark Forest, there was a strange smell in the air.

Lin Xiu sniffed and his expression changed suddenly.
