Chapter 914: Devouring the Divine Spark

Seeing Lin Xiu coming over, An Nengxing recovered from the shock just now.

“What are you doing!”

When An Nengxing saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

The body subconsciously stepped back.

After all, the strength that Lin Xiu showed just now was too terrifying and he was really a little scared.

“Where’s the Divine spark?”

Lin Xiu quickly walked in front of him and said with a faint smile.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, his face slowly turned nasty.

The Divine Spark was obtained by him very accidentally.

This Divine Spark was a priceless thing, but he was still very unwilling to hand it over to Lin Xiu.

As he thought about it, he subconsciously held a small box in his hand.

...

This special box is used to hold the divine spark and keep the energy of the divine spark from leaking out.

“Boy, even if you get this divine spark, you can’t absorb it.”

“The fire energy contained in the Divine Spark is enough to burn you into slag.”

An Nengxing looked at Lin Xiu and said.

Seeing that Lin Xiu didn’t seem to have any words, he rolled his eyes and continued, “Anyway, you also killed my Shadow Squad, let’s drop this then?”

Speaking of which, he was actually very heartbroken.

The Shadow Squad was his proudest combat unit. He never thought that it would be destroyed by Lin Xiu so easily!

Thinking of this, he was also full of resentment and murderous intent towards Lin Xiu in his heart.

Of course, there was no expression on his face.

“Hand it over.”

Lin Xiu ignored his words, looked at the small box in his hand and said lightly.

“Are you sure you want to be the enemy of us, the Divine Domain?”

An Nengxing said with a gloomy expression.

“An Nengxing, don’t drag your own behavior into our entire Divine Domain!”

Hu Ling also walked over from the other side and after hearing An Nengxing’s words, she said with a cold expression.

“You can’t say that. After all, he also killed An Nengxing’s shadow squad.”

Zhang Jin and Luo Kun also walked to An Nengxing’s side at this time and said aloud.

At this moment, Hu Ling’s brows furrowed.

It was indeed a sticky situation.

“What, you’re not planning to keep to your word?”

The corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth twitched, showing a smile.

An Nengxing’s face was gloomy and uncertain.

“I can’t possibly give you the Divine Spark.” ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, he gritted his teeth with a hint of coldness and said.

“En, then go to hell.”

Lin Xiu nodded and he directly waved the Dark Edge spear in his hand!

Boom—

A cluster of white light burst out instantly and charged directly towards An Nengxing’s head!

Without any precautions, the whole head was instantly blasted into slag.

Hu Ling and the others all opened their eyes wide and they were so frightened by this sudden scene that they froze.

“This is mine, right?”

As Lin Xiu spoke, he took out the box in An Nengxing’s hand.

“You dare to kill the deacon of our Divine Domain!?”

Luo Kun and Zhang Jin opened their eyes wide and said in disbelief.

They didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would simply kill An Nengxing directly over a slight disagreement!

“So what?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“you...”

The two of them wanted to say something, but just as they were about to say it, the words seemed to be stuck in their throats.

“When do you guys go to the Secret Realm?”

Lin Xiu ignored the two and instead spoke to Hu Ling.

“Tomorrow afternoon.”

Hu Ling was startled, then said subconsciously.

“Very good, I’ll go with you guys tomorrow.”

“Goodbye.”

Lin Xiu waved his hand and left without looking back.

Watching this scene, Zhang Jin and Luo Kun stood there blankly.

“Hu Ling! He was the warrior you chose and he killed An Nengxing!”

As Lin Xiu’s figure completely disappeared here, Zhang Jin and Luo Kun looked at Hu Ling and said angrily.

“And?”

Hu Ling looked at them with a sneer.

“An Nengxing was not strong enough and he even ruined the shadow squad.”

“Even if he doesn’t kill An Nengxing, what good would come out of An Nengxing?”

Hearing Hu Ling’s words, both Zhang Jin and Luo Kun fell silent.

At this time, Hu Ling looked in the direction Lin Xiu was leaving, then said lightly, “I will recommend him to be the new deacon.”

After Lin Xiu left, he quickly checked into a hotel.

“Huh? I only gained 5% of my experience.”

Looking at the experience gained after killing Shadow just now, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but feel a little depressed.

5%, for Lin Xiu, is indeed not much.

After all, Shadow was also a warrior of the Respected warrior-level.

His current level was 61 and it would probably be very challenging to reach 62.

“Look at this thing first.”

Sitting cross-legged on the ground, Lin Xiu slowly opened the box.

Soon, the divine spark was taken out of the box.

The branches of this divine spark seem to be made of special materials.

It seems that it was added later to hold the Divine Spark.

The divine spark was like a special red-golden flame, it looks very gorgeous.

And under such close contact, Lin Xiu couldn’t feel the temperature of the flame.

However, he could feel the powerful energy contained in this divine spark.

“It seems that it is indeed worthy of the title of being invaluable.”

As Lin Xiu spoke, he hesitated for a while, then took it slowly to his mouth.

Looking at the divine spark in front of him, Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and swallowed it directly!

As this divine spark entered his belly, Lin Xiu suddenly felt powerful energy that burst out in his belly!

pfft—

A bloody arrow spat out from Lin Xiu’s mouth.

With the body’s abdomen as the center, the terrifying burning sensation radiated out and instantly spread to the entire body.

That burning sensation made Lin Xiu feel like his internal organs were about to melt away!

This was even after Lin Xiu’s body had experienced the hellfire and was reborn from the ashes!

If it was an ordinary person, the moment he swallowed the Divine Spark, he would probably have vanished into ashes.

This divine spark doesn’t seem to have any temperature, but he didn’t expect that the energy that erupted after being swallowed would be so powerful.

Although Lin Xiu felt the severe pain coming from his whole body and was panicking, but he acted very calm.

‘Cultivation Technique’ and ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ were activated at the same time.

While the power of the divine spark was absorbed, the damage to the body was constantly being healed.

This process was repeated constantly.

After some time has passed. When Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, the sun had just risen.
