Chapter 930: The Powerful Lin Xiu

The previous games were all free fight.

But this time, the three seemed to have negotiated and wanted to get rid of Lin Xiu at the same time!

“These three people are all well-known Respected warriors and they seem to know each other. It is normal to gang up and kill Lin Xiu.”

Zhang Jin sneered.

Hu Ling gave Zhang Jin a stern look and continued to look towards the field.

She saw that Lin Xiu, who saw the three attacking, didn’t seem to panic at all.

At this time, holding the Dark Edge spear, he directly resisted their attacks.

Dang dang-

As the weapons collided, there was a loud noise after another.

And the entire space seemed to vibrate at this moment.

Lin Xiu resisted the attacks of these three people and seemed to have no fear at all.

And what’s even more shocking is that Lin Xiu didn’t lose the slightest!

“Um?”

......

Heilong frowned slightly when he saw this scene.

Because of the strength that Lin Xiu showed, something seemed amiss.

He was obviously stronger than the other three Respected warriors!

“Hahaha, Hei Long, that’s all there is to your warriors huh!”

Huang Fulin laughed happily at this time.

Lin Xiu’s performance at this time made the Divine Domain very proud!

“Damn!”

At this moment, Zhang Jing’s pupils shrank slightly.

He knew that Lin Xiu’s strength was not simple, otherwise he wouldn’t be able to kill Luo Kun easily.

But he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu’s strength would be so powerful.

In the face of the famous Respected warriors sent by the other three forces, he could fight to this extent!

boom boom boom —

These three Respected warriors obviously felt the pressure and at this time they also directly released their powerful skills, all of them attacked Lin Xiu and died!

“Be careful!”

Seeing this scene, Hu Ling couldn’t help but exclaimed.

Whoosh whoosh—

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s body instantly turned into several Lin Xiu!

Those skills only hit a few of the ‘Lin Xiu’.

The other three Lin Xiu attacked them separately!

When the three warriors saw this scene, the expressions in their eyes changed slightly and they attacked the three Lin Xiu respectively! Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

One of the Lin Xiu, raised the corners of his mouth.

It was also very difficult for Lin Xiu to face the attacks of the three Respected warriors at the same time.

Unless he used Fury to directly crush and kill them.

But Fury, for him, was a supreme stunt.

It cannot be used unless it is absolutely necessary.

After all, the sequelae are too serious.

Taking advantage of the fact that the two warriors could not tell real from fake, Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand and attacked one of the warriors frantically.

At this moment, the face of the black-clothed warrior changed greatly.

He deliberately wanted to remind the two around him that this Lin Xiu was the real one.

But he was busy blocking Lin Xiu’s continuous attacks that he didn’t even have time to speak.

boom boom boom —

And at this time, the Dark Edge spear held in Lin Xiu’s hand had a terrifying electric ray and a dark blue flame at the same time.

Under the collision between the Dark Edge spear and his weapon, these dark blue flames, as well as the terrifying electric lights, were transmitted directly to his body along his sword!

“what!!!”

In the next moment, he really couldn’t bear the flames and electric lights that passed along his sword and at the same time he let out a wail, the weapon in his hand also fell directly to the ground.

“goodbye.”

Lin Xiu said coldly.

At the same time that the weapon in his hand fell to the ground, the spear in his hand stabbed out.

Immediately, a hole was stabbed in his head.

With the blood splashing, the warrior fell directly to the ground.

When the surrounding warriors saw this scene, they couldn’t help but exclaimed.

One person fought against three Respected warriors, not only did he not fall behind, but he even killed one of the warriors at this time!

“good!”

When Huang Fulin saw this scene, he couldn’t help laughing.

Hei Long’s face became extremely ugly.

The warrior who just died was a warrior in the black troop!

“kill him.”

Zhao Ran and Bai Long said indifferently at this time.

The other two clones had already been seen through at this time.

He was also killed by those two Respected warriors.

At this time, they came to their senses and attacked Lin Xiu directly!

Lin Xiu was at the level of Respected warrior but didn’t have the slightest bit of pride at this time.

As soon as his thought was triggered, the ‘Sphere’ unfolded directly.

boom boom boom —

The power of these two Respected warriors all attacked Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

Lin Xiu himself was not injured at all.

‘Awe of the phoenix’!

And at the next moment, Lin Xiu, who was holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, waved it violently.

With the swinging of the Dark Edge spear, a large number of flaming birds burst out!

As soon as these flaming birds came out, the temperature of the surrounding air instantly increased.

“En?”

The four Sage warriors frowned as they looked at the flaming birds.

There was also a look of surprise in their eyes.

Because even with their Sage Warrior strength, looking at these flaming birds, it seems that they don’t dare to fight without unfolding the ‘Sphere’.

This flame is dangerous and terrifying.

“Domain!”

When the two warriors saw this scene and unfolded their own ‘Sphere’, they also unfolded their domain power.

On their bodies, two bright rays of light flashed out in an instant.

These rays of light directly covered the surrounding ground.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu, who saw this scene, snorted coldly at this moment, his thoughts were triggered and his domain power was directly used too.

A white light flashed and the domain power Lin Xiu used also covered the entire field.

They used those domain powers and as Lin Xiu’s domain power covered them, they disappeared immediately!

“Oh? Interesting.”

When Huang Fulin saw this scene, he couldn’t help showing a smile.

Lin Xiu’s domain power is a power that can clear other people’s domains.

The two Respected warriors noticed all this and they were shocked at this moment.

He looked to the front and saw those flaming birds, which had already reached in front of them!

“what!!!”

The two Respected warriors shouted loudly when they saw such a terrifying scene.

He used his own ‘Sphere’ to resist the incoming flame birds.

But the power of these flaming birds is so powerful that even if the two warriors unfolded the ‘Sphere’, they could feel the burning horror.

And they also clearly felt that their ‘Sphere’ seemed to be melting away at a speed visible to the naked eye!

Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he charged directly toward one of the warriors!
