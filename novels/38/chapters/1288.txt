1289 Simply Giving Away A Hundred Million

Yuan Daliang started trembling when he heard what Baili Haoling would do to him.

His eyes were filled with fear.

This way, his life would be completely over!

“I’ll give them to you!! I will!!!”

!!

Yuan Daliang screamed on top of his lungs.

A hundred million energy stones was a vast amount but he had no other choice.

He didn’t want to die.

“Alright. When will you be paying it to me?”

Baili Haoling smiled in return.

“Once I get my hand back….I will give it to you immediately…”

Yuan Daling was trying to catch his breath.

The pain that he felt from both his arms getting chopped off caused sweat to trickle down his forehead.

“Alright. Just remember to do it.”

Baili Haoling remained smilling.

“Or else, I will go over to your city to get them and then, the amount would no longer be the same.”

The rest of the warriors around pitied Yuan Daliang as they heard what Baili Haoling was saying.

“Get lost.”

With that said, one of the warriors who knew Yuan Daliang quickly stepped forward and picked up the pair of arms that were lying on the ground.

As soon as Yuan Daliang left, the cleaners from the training ground quickly cleaned the floor.

They seemed to be used to scenarios like this and there were no expressions on their faces.

That’s how she got a hundred million energy stones?!

Lin Xiu’s eyes were opened wide and he was still in disbelief.

A hundred million worth of energy stone definitely isn’t a small amount.

Energy stones were not as pure as odd crystals. They weren’t only filled with energy and if they were to use it for cultivation, it would take a long time.

However, the good thing about these energy stones was that they could be used to replace other energy sources.

They could be used on machineries as well.

Therefore, energy stones were important for a city.

“Wait. Stand right there.”

Suddenly, Lin Xiu glanced at the other end of the room and spoke out loud.

Zhao Lin was trying to bring Sun Tian out of the room but when Lin Xiu spoke, he stopped.

He didn’t voluntarily stop. It was because he felt an incredible amount of energy headed in his direction.

He couldn’t move at all.

His heart instantly sank as he could already guess what would happen next.

“The fight that we had earlier, I’ve exhausted myself as well. You should at least compensate me for that.”

Lin Xiu spoke casually.

“Give me a thousand million and you can leave.”

The rest of the warriors pursed their lips.

They were all asking for a hundred million! This was similar to mugging.

“In your dreams!”

Sun Tian widened his eyes in shock as he screamed.

He did have a hundred million energy stones but these were all in his storage back in his city. If he gave them all to Lin Xiu, there would be nothing left in his city.

This was because the entire city required a large number of energy stones.

“Are you sure you aren’t going to give it to me?”

Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows.

“You can kill me if you dare…..” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Sun Tian glared at Lin Xiu and with how he was feeling pissed, there was blood that trickled from the corner of his mouth once again.

Zhao Lin was still being compressed by the energy released by Lin Xiu and he couldn’t speak at all.

He couldn’t even move a finger.

He was feeling helpless. Sun Tian has really hit a metal board this time.

Who would have thought that such a young man would have such skills?

Plus, the young girl next to him wasn’t a friendly figure either.

“I would like to kill you immediately but it isn’t allowed here.”

Lin Xiu spoke in a sad tone.

This was the rule here and Lin Xiu didn’t want to cause a scene here in this city.

...

Afterall, there was a god king here in this city.

This god king could conquer the entire Warrior God Realm, it was obvious enough that he was definitely a powerful man.

Otherwise, Lin Xiu would have wasted so much time talking and would just pierce Sun Tian’s head with his spear.

“Or…. I can also chop off your arms and legs too…”

With that said, Sun Tian’s face turned ghastly pale.

Were these two demons….?

The rest of the warriors around were silently judging them.

Crippling another warrior but not killing them…Those guarding this hotel definitely wouldn’t be involved in this.

“Would you like to try it out?”

With that said, Lin Xiu suddenly disappeared into thin air.

Then, Sun Tian saw Lin Xiu with his Hao Yue spear and it went straight for Sun Tian.

...

Without any hesitation, Sun Tian’s left arm had been chopped off!

There was blood everywhere!

“Ahhhhhh!!!!”

Sun Tian roared in rage.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu would act so quickly.

“Well, I shall then chop off all four of your limbs then.”

Lin Xiu continued.

He held onto his spear, ready to slice off another limb from Sun Tian.

“I’ll do it!!! I’ll give it to you!!!”

Sun Tian was aware that Lin Xiu would do as he said.

“Well, if you agreed to it earlier, you wouldn’t have lost an arm…”

Lin Xiu stopped as he said to Sun Tian.

It would definitely cost a lot more energy stones to reconnect his arm.

“415414…”

“That’s my card number. You better transfer the money soon or….I will find you.”

Lin Xiu gave him his card number and showed a cold smile on his face.

Sun Tian’s body felt cold as he saw the look on Lin Xiu’s face.

“I will!!! I will!”

His body was shaking as he tried to suppress the pain that he was feeling. He quickly picked up the arm and then left the training ground with Zhao Lin.

The rest of the warriors couldn’t help but shake their heads.

Sun Tian had been overconfident earlier. If it wasn’t for that, he wouldn’t be in this state now.

“You, idiot! You copied me!”

Baili Haoling glared at Lin Xiu.

“Well, we should get rich together.”

Lin Xiu was a little happy with it. They have gotten back all the money that they have used on buying their weapons.

The shops here were filled with fun and interesting things. Lin Xiu wanted to take a look at them.

The warrior skills card may cost a bomb but if he saved up a little more, he should be able to buy them.

“The both of you have taken this too far.”

At the same time, the remaining warriors gathered around Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling.

Then, Lei Chong suddenly felt a pressuring aura over his head and he couldn’t help but spat out blood.

They seem to have figured out that Lei Chong came with him.

Lin Xiu patted on Lei Chong’s shoulder when he saw what had happened.

There was a surge of energy that entered his body and Lei Chong instantly felt much better.

Lin Xiu looked around and finally found his target.

He looked at the warrior who was placing the energy on them and returned it with a even stronger force of energy!
