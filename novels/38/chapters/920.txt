Chapter 921: Absorbing Energy

Although Elder Sun was reluctant in every possible way, he had no choice but to directly lift his foot up.

Since Lin Xiu is fine, then he will be fine too!

Thinking so, he stepped on it directly.

What he imagined did not happen and Elder Sun was safe and sound!

“Hahaha!”

Elder Sun couldn’t help laughing in surprise at this time.

But just when he laughed out loud, a ‘crackling’ sound came over for a short time.

Boom—

A lot of lightning suddenly appeared on Elder Sun’s body!

The whole person was instantly covered by a terrifying electric current!

“what!!!”

Elder Sun let out a wail and roar at this time.

This terrifying electric current seems to have caused great harm to him.

......

Even if he unfolds the ‘Sphere’, there is no way to protect him.

After a while, the current disappeared.

And Elder Sun fell directly on the stairs, as if he had lost half his life.

“Huh? It’s alright, he’s still alive.”

Seeing this scene, Feng Zheng said lightly.

Although Zhang Rin didn’t like what Elder Sun did just now, he was relieved to see that Elder Sun was fine.

After all, they were members of their white troop and they didn’t want Elder Sun to die directly.

“You guys, keep going.”

Feng Zheng did not give Lin Xiu and Elder Sun a chance to rest and continued to speak.

Hearing his words, Elder Sun’s body trembled even more.

The terrifying current just now almost destroyed him.

If it weren’t for the fact that he had just practiced electric current-type skill before, he had a certain resistance to electric current.

He would have died on this stairs long ago. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The first step was already so difficult, wouldn’t the next step be even more terrifying?

Thinking of this, he felt a chill all over his body.

And Lin Xiu looked at the stairs and his brows slightly wrinkled.

Judging from the situation just now, every time you step on this ladder, you will endure extremely terrifying power.

This power, even if you allow yourself to forcibly resist it, was a bit challenging.

No, it should be said that it may be life-threatening.

Strange, was there really any inheritance up there?

“Hurry up, or I’ll kill you!”

Seeing that the two of them still hadn’t moved, Feng Zheng roared angrily.

The sword in his hand had already been raised at this time.

The sharp sword made Elder Sun’s body feel cold at this time.

He was also afraid that Feng Zheng would directly cut his body in half with this sharp sword!

He gritted his teeth and stepped directly onto the second step!

Boom—

At this moment, he seemed to feel a lot of energy pouring into his body.

The whole body became like a ball.

In the next moment, it will explode directly!

When the people around saw this scene, their eyes widened and their bodies felt cold.

This Elder Sun, was a warrior at the level of King warrior, he actually just died like that.

And the faces of the people in the white troop also became extremely ugly at this time.

Elder Sun is dead. Next, it’s their turn!

“You, go on.”

Seeing Elder Sun’s death, Feng Zheng frowned slightly and pointed at Lin Xiu with the sword in his hand.

Lin Xiu stood there, ignoring him.

Feng Zheng saw that Lin Xiu ignored him and there was killing intent in his eyes.

In the next moment, he slashed directly at Lin Xiu!

A terrifying blade aura burst out directly.

It was as if Lin Xiu’s body was going to be chopped in half.

When Hu Ling and Zhang Rin saw this scene, the expressions in their eyes changed slightly.

Boom—

But the scene that people imagined did not appear.

The terrifying sword aura hit Lin Xiu’s body and after making a loud noise, it disappeared instantly!

It was as if it had never appeared before!

what happened!?

Feng Zheng’s eyes widened when he saw this scene.

His attack just now was not simple.

Ordinary warriors of the King warrior level will be seriously injured even if they unfold a Sphere.

But this man didn’t even move at all, his sword aura just disappeared!

What is the reason?

At this time, Lin Xiu looked at the second level of stairs and stepped directly up!

Boom—

As soon as he stepped on the second step, he felt extremely powerful energy coming over.

Fortunately, Lin Xiu had already taken precautions.

At this time, the strength of the whole body was activated.

“Ding! Found energy, the ‘Engulf’ skill is in use!”

And at this time, the system’s ‘Engulf’ skill started to be used automatically again!

Soon, the energy that rushed over and wanted to explode Lin Xiu’s body was quickly absorbed by Lin Xiu.

The surrounding warriors saw a miraculous scene at this time.

They saw that Lin Xiu’s body had swelled up like a balloon, but in the next moment, it quickly shrank at a speed visible to the naked eye and returned to normal.

Stepped up!?

At this time, Feng Zheng’s eyes were full of shock.

Because the warriors just now all died when they set foot on the second step.

Lin Xiu is the only one who can stand on the second step like this.

“Very good, you, go on to the third step.”

When Feng Zheng saw this scene, a smile appeared on his cheek and he continued to speak.

“Shut up.”

Lin Xiu, who was absorbing the terrifying energy, said lightly.

“What did you say?”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Feng Zheng’s expression suddenly became extremely ugly.

How dare this kid tell him to shut up!?

Lin Xiu ignored Feng Zheng and continued to operate the ‘Cultivation Technique’ with the ‘Engulf’ skill, constantly absorbing the energy he had just obtained.

Lin Xiu, whose physical strength is very powerful, quickly devoured all that seemingly terrifying energy!

Damn it!

Feng Zheng now has murderous intent in his eyes.

Holding the sword, he continued to slash in the air!

Whoosh whoosh—

At this moment, the terrifying sword aura rushed towards Lin Xiu frantically.

bang bang bang-

But at the moment when it was about to hit Lin Xiu’s body, these sword auras seemed to be blocked by an invisible barrier and could not cause any damage to Lin Xiu at all!

.

Feng Zheng was a little bit furious now.

He wanted to rush over and kill Lin Xiu, but was afraid to approach the stairs and endure the terrifying energy shock.

crackling-

Lin Xiu turned around and looked at Feng Zheng. As soon as his thoughts were triggered, a large amount of electricity flickered on his body.

This electric current seems to be more terrifying than the electric current that Elder Sun has just endured.

‘Thousand Thunder’.

As Lin Xiu’s indifferent words fell, with Lin Xiu as the center, a large amount of terrifying electric current burst out!

boom boom boom —

The surrounding air seemed to be scorched.

The incomparably terrifying electric current charged toward Feng Zheng!
