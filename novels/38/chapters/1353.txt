1354 Weird ‘vines’!

As these flames converged into its mouth, the surrounding air seemed to become distorted at this moment.

This flame is very terrifying!

“Be careful!”

Lu Guangyue and the others clearly sensed the horror of the flames and at this moment they let out a loud roar.

The surrounding warriors dodged in an instant.

However, Lin Xiu’s punch still struck down.

The Netherworld Monitor Lizard opened its mouth wide and the flames had already spewed out and it directly rushed out!

Lin Xiu’s body was directly impacted by the flame.

The whole person entered into the flame shock wave.

“This kid, courting death…”

Looking at this scene, Sun Wei couldn’t help saying aloud.

This was obviously the most powerful attack of the Netherworld Monitor Lizard. If you don’t dodge, you will probably be directly reduced to ashes by the flames, right?!

boom–

But at the next moment, with a loud sound, the flame that spewed out instantly disappeared.

The body of the Netherworld Monitor Lizard fell directly to the ground, letting out loud howls.

If you look closely, you can clearly see its upper jaw, which was directly pierced.

A large amount of purple blood spattered out.

The warriors around were shocked when they saw this scene.

“This…”

At this moment, Lu Guangyue’s eyes were also wide open. Looking at this scene, he seemed to be in disbelief.

The armor of the Netherworld monitor lizard is very hard. They have not destroyed it after attacking for so long, but now…

No, the attack was from the inside!

At this moment, he looked ahead and saw Lin Xiu’s figure!

Lin Xiu clenched his hands into fists and continued to attack in this direction.

That kind of terrifying flame is not a problem at all for Lin Xiu, who is extremely resistant to flames.

At this time, he continued to attack the ghost monitor lizard.

Although he has no weapons, Lin Xiu is not weak in the slightest when using boxing techniques.

At this time, the Netherworld Monitor Lizard let out a frenzied roar and swept its tail at Lin Xiu who was rushing towards him.

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and jumped up.

With his fist, he punched the Netherworld monitor lizard in the air.

Boom——

Although it didn’t hit the Netherworld Monitor Lizard’s body directly, the powerful impact caused by this punch directly caused most of the Netherworld Monitor Lizard’s body to sink into the ground.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu continued to frantically wave his fists, stood on the head of the Netherworld Monitor Lizard, and crazily smashed down on its head.

Boom, boom, boom——

As the fists continued to hit the Netherworld Monitor lizard’s head, loud noises erupted suddenly.

The Netherworld Monitor Lizard wanted to struggle, but there was absolutely no way.

The warriors around originally wanted to continue attacking, but at this moment, they were all dumbfounded.

The destructive power produced by Lin Xiu’s fist is really terrifying.

At this time, under his frenzied attack, the outer armor of the giant ghost beast has been completely dented.

What exactly is going on!

As Lin Xiu punched down again, the ghost lizard completely lost its life.

At this time, a system prompt of experience gained also rang in his mind.

The experience progress bar has now reached more than 61%.

It’s still very slow.

“The Netherworld monitor lizard… was killed by him alone!?”

At this time, Sun Wei looked at this scene with eyes full of shock.

The strength of his fist is really too terrifying, he actually punched the Netherworld monitor lizard to death!

“Be careful, something is coming!”

At this time, Lu Guangyue was shocked by Lin Xiu’s strength and at the same time shouted sharply.

Whoosh whoosh——

As soon as he spoke, the warriors around him also clearly heard strange noises.

Their faces became a little ugly.

The commotion caused by the battle with the Netherworld monitor lizard just now was too great.

It probably attracted the attention of some monsters around.

...

Lin Xiu, who has a strong sense of sensitivity, clearly felt something at this time.

As soon as the odd crystal of this evolved beast was pulled out from its head, Lin Xiu’s body jumped up immediately.

boom–

At this moment, a huge ‘vine’ flew directly from the other side.

In an instant, the corpse of the Netherworld monitor lizard was directly pulled into the depths of the forest by the huge ‘vines’.

Lin Xiu looked at this scene with surprise in his eyes.

Because the corpse of the Netherworld Monitor Lizard was very large, the ‘vines’ seemed to easily sweep the corpse away.

Whoosh whoosh——

And at this moment, a sound that seemed to break through the air reached the ears of other warriors.

Lu Guangyue also seemed to feel something, he moved and dodged directly.

Boom——

...

The ground where he was just now was suddenly blasted by a ‘vine’ into a huge hole.

Not only on his side but also in all directions of the forest, there were also a large number of vines, rushing over directly!

Most of the God warriors’ reaction speed was extremely fast, but there are one or two God warriors whose reaction speed was a little slower.

They were directly entangled by the vines.

Damn it!

The expressions of the two God warriors suddenly changed.

The moment these vines strangled them, they felt that the source strength in their bodies had been suppressed in some way and there was no way to use it now.

No matter how hard they tried to break free, they couldn’t break free.

What exactly is going on! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

At this moment, their hearts were filled with fear.

No matter how hard the body tries, there is no way. And in the next moment, their bodies were directly dragged by these ‘vines’ to the depths of the forest!

“ah!!!”

Soon, there were wailing sounds of fear.

“Damn it!”

At this moment, Lu Guangyue’s face became ugly.

The Netherworld unicorn has not been seen yet and now three warriors at the level of God warriors have disappeared.

Moreover, these ‘vines’ were really alive now!

At this time, these vines were still madly charging toward everyone.

Now everyone was on alert and brandished their weapons to attack.

Bang bang bang——

With one dull sound after another, the vines began to fall down.

And fell on the ground, these vines wriggled on the ground like worms.

Looking at them made one’s scalp tingle.

Lin Xiu moved and while dodging the stabbing ‘vine’, he punched the ‘vine’ with his right hand.

Boom——

With a loud sound, the ‘vine’ was directly shattered by Lin Xiu’s fist.

Roar–

And at this moment, there were strange roars from all directions!
