Chapter 477: 15 seconds Lin Xiu?

What is this!?

Lin Xiu looked ahead and saw a giant beast as tall as one storey and an unusually muscular body.

Its eyes were crimson red and there were two rows of sharp teeth in its mouth, it also had some shredded meat between its teeth.

It appeared to be like shredded human flesh and looked very terrifying.

Roar–

At this time it let out a loud roar again and its huge mouth was coming toward Lin Xiu and the policeman!

Swish swish swish——

The police responded very quickly. He directly raised the laser gun in his hand and shot the monster in the mouth!

Although it didn’t cause much damage to the monster, the monster made a huge wailing sound, and then backed away.

“Hurry up, leave!”

The policeman shouted loudly at this time.

This monster was too terrifying, even his hand was trembling a little at this time.

But Lin Xiu and Luo Yue both stood there and didn’t mean to leave at all.

“Did you hear me! Leave!”

But at this moment, Lin Xiu moved, and charged forward with the Dark Edge spear in his hand!

Courting death!

Seeing this scene, the policeman looked at Lin Xiu like he was looking at a lunatic.

This monster was definitely rank 5 or above. If it hadn’t opened up its mouth, his laser gun would not be able to cause any damage to it.

Lin Xiu, a young man, how could he be able to deal with this evolved beast!

But at the next moment, he was stunned.

Bang bang bang——

Lin Xiu was holding a spear as he rushed to the front frantically!

The spear attacked the monster’s huge body wildly and the impact caused it to retreat continuously.

The spearhead of the Dark Edge spear collided with the monster’s body, emitting a lot of sparks.

Its hard outer armor showed a lot of scratches at this time.

Roar–

The evolved beast let out a huge roar, and then the huge claws were about to slap Lin Xiu’s body.

But Lin Xiu swung the Dark Edge spear in a crescent-shaped arc, severing the monster’s claws directly!

And this was not over yet – with Lin Xiu’s continuous attacks, a large number of holes appeared on the monster’s body instantly.

A disastrous state!

Boom–

That huge body fell directly to the ground in the next moment.

The policeman was dumbfounded at this time.

This huge rank 5 evolved beast was killed just like this…!?

“15 seconds, a bit slow.” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu, and then said faintly.

“The skin of this darn thing is too thick.” Lin Xiu said helplessly.

The policeman was even more dumbfounded at this time, this… this is too crazy eh?

Within 15 seconds, he dealt witha rank 5 giant evolved beast?!

“Hey Policeman.” Lin Xiu looked at the policeman at this time, and then said with a smile.

“Oh, oh, what’s the matter?” The policeman came to his senses at this time, and then said aloud.

He was still in too much shock and he hasn’t fully recovered yet.

“How is the situation over there now?” Lin Xiu said.

“Oh right! There are now zombies over there, as well as terrifying evolved beasts!” The policeman looked ahead and said.

Thinking of this, his body trembled.

“You guys better leave quickly, otherwise…”

Well, let’s go first. Before he finished speaking, Lin Xiu smiled and said aloud.

The policeman’s eyes widened, but thinking of Lin Xiu’s terrifying strength just now, he didn’t say much at this time.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue glanced at each other and seemed to be in tune as they ran to the front together.

As expected, they could see the flood coming in.

Although the drainage system here was very good, the flood was really horrifying. There was still a lot of muddy-yellow water seeping in.

The water was about to reach the people’s knees.

And in the water, there were many zombies on it. Seeing Lin Xiu and Luo Yue appear, these zombies were like hungry ghosts seeing food and they rushed towards Lin Xiu wildly!

“Hng!” When Luo Yue saw this scene, she suddenly gave a cold snort, then held the long sword in her hand. Before the zombies rushed over, she rushed over!

The long sword in her hand slashed madly and the bodies of those zombies, as if cutting tofu, were all cut in half by Luo Yue.

Lin Xiu didn’t stop the movements in his hands either. Following the wave of the Dark Edge spear, flaming birds burst forth from the tip of the spear, and then rushed towards the zombies in front of them! L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

After those zombies were hit by the flaming birds, they got burnt and fell to the ground.

Hundreds of thousands of experience per kill. Although it was still a drop in the bucket for Lin Xiu but no matter how small the mosquito’s legs are, they are still meat ah.

So Lin Xiu had the motivation to kill at this time. Soon, the zombies here were all dealt with under the attack of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

“Go, go to Bei Dou Academy.” After Lin Xiu dealt with the zombies that were blocking their way, he went straight ahead with Luo Yue.

As the water in front would cover their knees and even though they were wearing shoes and trousers were waterproof, but the resistance of this water would still slow them down. So Luo Yue and Lin Xiu leaped up directly onto the building above and proceeded from the building above.

“Oh no, oh no, why are there so many zombies here…” At this time, at Bei Dou Academy, a large number of students were gathered on the highest rooftop of the school.

They looked ahead and saw a lot of cracks on the gate of Bei Dou Academy.

Obviously, those zombies and terrifying evolved beasts seemed to be breaking through the door and were about to enter.

“Teacher Zhang, what shall we do?” Some students became nervous after seeing this scene, and then said to the middle-aged man on the side.

“The aircraft just sent a group of students to a safe city nearby, and they will be back soon.” Teacher Zhang wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and said aloud.

Seeing this scene, he was also scared.

Nobody expected to see so many zombies.

Due to the large number of zombies passing by, the drainage outlets were blocked which allowed the water to rush into Xing Yao City.

Boom——

In the next moment, the gate of Bei Dou Academy broke directly!
