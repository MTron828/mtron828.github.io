And this box appeared to have been damaged before.

Obviously, Zhang Zong, who treated it as garbage previously, wanted to find something in this box.

But it seems that he didn’t find it.

“It should be in here…” Lin Xiu found a knife in the hall, then began to carve the surface of the wooden box layer by layer carefully.

This box was very hard like steel.

Lin Xiu didn’t have any other choice. The source strength in his body burst out and it covered the top of the knife.

Very quickly, because of the source strength, the knife became very sharp.

Ge ge ge–

As Lin Xiu forcefully scraped the wooden box layer by layer from the top, there was a screeching sound.

Lin Xiu was very cautious like he was working on a piece of art.

Lin Xiu scraped layers as thin as paper off this wooden box.

As several layers were scraped away, Lin Xiu could see a gleam of silver light at the bottom.

It’s really in here!

Seeing this, Lin Xiu had a look of excitement that could not be concealed. He took a deep breath. After holding his breath, Lin Xiu continued to carefully scrape the wood off.

At the next moment, Lin Xiu took out a dazzling diamond skill card!

“Hahaha, I was right, there is indeed something in it!” Lin Xiu became excited at this time.

This kind of special wood was very rarely seen and the skill card hidden in this box would not be found even if it was scanned.

So after Lin Xiu discovered this kind of wood, he felt that there might be something hidden inside.

“The person who hid this skill card here is really insidious. If one accidentally scratched the skill card, it would be useless.”

Because the manufacturing process of this skill card was different from the current ones; just a scratch and the information recorded in the skill card would become messy and useless.

Looking closely, there was a sturdy man on the skill card waving his fist.

This was very likely to be a skill lost in the last century. Even if he didn’t need it, it would be worth a few diamond skill cards!

‘Bodybuilding Technique’!? Lin Xiu took a closer look. On this skill card whose cover was similar to the current diamond skill card, there were two words written on it.

Bodybuilding technique... Bodybuilding technique!?

When Lin Xiu saw this, he seemed to recall something and his body trembled.

“Damn, it can’t be... really this thing...!?”

This is no ordinary skill card!

This is...

With this thought, Lin Xiu suppressed the excitement in his heart, then turned on the computer and started to type on the virtual keyboard frantically. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Soon, information about the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ appeared.

Bodybuilding Technique: it’s a skill developed by the warlord Li Yanyi, known as the ‘devil muscle man’ – a skill similar to the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

Instead of absorbing the energy from the air, then strengthening and changing one’s cells like the ‘Cultivation Technique’ thereby changing your body and forming a qualitative difference, ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ pays more attention to working out and other physical exercises. It has a powerful effect on the coordination of the body and the training of willpower.

Warlord Li Yanyi relied on the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ and ‘Cultivation Technique’, and transformed inside and out which was how he had such a powerful melee combat ability.

(Remarks: After Li Yanyi passed away, ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ was lost.)

“It was said that ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ is actually the same as ‘Cultivation Technique’ in essence but it was not as strong as ‘Cultivation Technique’. After all, the ‘Cultivation Technique’ is changing one’s own cells, it is a qualitative change!”

Lin Xiu continued to read and saw that many people were discussing this ‘Bodybuilding technique’.

However, because the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ was lost, these people can’t debate and come to a conclusion. Also, although Li Yanyi has accepted apprentices, those apprentices had already died in some kind of battle. So, the ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ was completely lost.

“Is this real?” Lin Xiu became extremely excited as he looked at this card.

If it is really Li Yanyi’s ‘Bodybuilding Technique’, then this thing is really priceless!

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and after calming himself down, he put the card on his forehead.

But as before, there was a coldness from the card, but Lin Xiu didn’t feel any information going into his mind.

What’s happening...

Snapped–

Just when Lin Xiu thought the skill card was a fake, he smacked his forehead.

This ‘Bodybuilding Technique’ card looked similar to the Diamond Skill card. It was obvious that one must reach rank 6 and above to use it!

Lin Xiu was a little sad that he couldn’t use all these skill cards...

“Forget it, hurry up and reach rank 6 then!”

Once he reached the rank 6, his strength would improve!!!

“Ice Crystal White Bird?” Just when Lin Xiu got excited, he heard a clear sound ringing.

He turned around and saw that Luo Yue had walked down from the stairs and was wearing a set of Sacred Region Academy uniforms, a white robe.

Her hair seemed a little bit wet and it was clear that she must have just taken a bath.

“You could tell what it is?” Lin Xiu smiled, then said aloud.

The body of this ice crystal white bird was like a white hairless chick, it looked very cute.

Ordinary people would definitely think that they were some kind of mutant chickens.

“Doesn’t it look like the ice crystal white bird?” Luo Yue walked over, then took the ice crystal white bird out of the refrigerator.

Looking at the ice crystal white bird that Luo Yue took out, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

Because Lin Xiu realized that this ice crystal white bird, which did not have any feathers before, has now grown white feathers!

The feathers were very beautiful and looked as if they are made of ice crystals. After taking a closer look, apart from its size, this ice crystal white bird was exactly the same as the huge and terrifying ice crystal white bird from the previous time!!!

“It’s growing too quickly eh?” Lin Xiu’s eyes widened in disbelief.

It was merely over an hour from the time he put it into the refrigeration box and gave it some Odd crystals. It actually grew into this size!?
