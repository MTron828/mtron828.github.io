Chapter 743: Self-cultivate

Lin Xiu, who was walking on the snow, was already looking forward to having the strength of a Respected warrior.

However, Lin Xiu has not practiced for a long time now. If he can reach this level and others found out, they would probably be frightened.

Soon, Lin Xiu returned to the hotel.

It seemed that because of Huangji’s affairs, Jiang Jun and others went somewhere.

Lin Xiu didn’t think about it. When he came back that night, he had already bypassed the surveillance location, so no one should be able to know that he jumped out of the window.

And those people present had already been killed.

“Is this the power of the source mark...”

Lin Xiu returned to the hotel room. At this moment, he triggered his mind and some black substances gathered on his forehead. In the next moment, they gathered into a complicated black pattern.

Lin Xiu looked in front and as his mind was triggered, a translucent white square enchantment-like thing appeared in front of him.

Looking at the square barrier floating in the air, Lin Xiu showed a hint of curiosity.

Is this the source mark of the space type?

However, the power of the source mark was used for a short while and in the next moment, it completely disappeared.

The translucent square matrix in the air also disappeared.

“Hu.”

With the disappearance of the square matrix, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but take a deep breath and there was a little sweat on his forehead.

He was just promoted to the Master warrior-level warrior and couldn’t control the consumption of his source strength when using this thing. At that moment, most of his source strength was consumed.

But at this time, Lin Xiu became more and more interested in this source mark.

This thing was definitely something that would make him stronger after being promoted to the master warrior level.

After taking a deep breath again, Lin Xiu activated the ‘Cultivation Technique’ to absorb the surrounding energy.

Time passed quickly and there was no notice to go to Fengyun City for two or three days, so Lin Xiu was cultivating here.

As for the power and use of the Source mark, Lin Xiu slowly controlled it.

As for Qian Jin, it seemed that these days, he has been going to the place where the source mark was engraved to observe the source mark, hoping to gain some new insights. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This day, early in the morning, Jiang Jun gathered everyone in the hall.

“The train has been repaired now and the damaged road has also been repaired. Get ready, we’ll set off later.”

Jiang Jun said to the crowd.

However, his current expression didn’t seem to be very good.

Huangji disappeared for no reason, he searched for a long time but couldn’t find him.

However, he found out that Huangji finally went to a guild in this ice and snow city.

What’s even weirder was that the president of this guild has also disappeared.

There were traces of battle in that guild, but there was no surveillance there, so he didn’t know what happened.

He only heard vaguely that there were king-level evolved beasts.

But now there was no other way, even if Huangji was not found, they would continue to go to Fengyun City.

Because the day of the competition was coming soon.

These warriors on the Tianjiao list had doubts in their eyes when they heard Jiang Jun’s words. They seemed to have no idea why Huangji disappeared.

“Do you know where Huangji went?”

Qian Jin stood beside Lin Xiu at this time and whispered to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu shook his head, expressing that he didn’t know.

“That’s true, how would you know...”

At this time, Qian Jin also felt that he was thinking too much. The disappearance of Huangji should have nothing to do with Lin Xiu.

With Jiang Jun leading the way, everyone arrived at the railway station in Ice and Snow City.

“Get your ticket and get on the train.”

Jiang Jun walked behind and said aloud to the people in front.

The train was similar to the one before and when he walked in, Lin Xiu arrived in a small box.

This small box was separated for each warrior, so Lin Xiu was alone in a small box.

“Because of the recent riot of evolved beasts, there may be some road damage on the way to Fengyun City, so the speed will be slower.”

“But when we arrive, I will inform you guys, so you can just stay in the carriage.” Jiang Jun said to the people who were already in the small boxes as he walked.

Lin Xiu didn’t say anything. He was in the room at the moment, closing his eyes and resting.

The warrior standards of Fengyun City was the highest among Marqi planets and the area of ??Fengyun City was also very large. Lin Xiu has both a sense of anticipation and a different emotion.

The train was running smoothly and fast and Lin Xiu was still immersed in his practice.

At the same time, on the other side, Luo Yue was sitting at a table in a classroom and seemed to be listening carefully to the words of the lecturer on the podium.

The instructor seemed to be explaining the knowledge about source mark. As he spoke, he drew various Source marks with intricate patterns on the blackboard.

“Okay, that’s it for today’s class, class is over.”

It didn’t take long for the instructor to speak out after hearing the ringing of the bell.

“Tsk, he’s talking about the source mark again, this kind of simple thing has long been understood.”

As the instructor left, a man dressed in luxurious clothes stood up, looking disdainful.

At this time, while he was talking, he looked at Luo Yue.

This was the classroom of Xuanfeng Academy and Luo Yue was naturally arranged by the Luo family to attend these studies.

At this time, Luo Yue was also wearing the white uniform of Xuanfeng Academy.

She had a ponytail and her whole body was full of youthful aura, but her face looked a little cold and she was a bit difficult to approach.

But her beautiful face still caused many male students to look at her secretly.

Luo Yue seemed to be used to it already. At this time, she ignored the eyes of the others and was holding a pen and drawing source marks on the notebook that the instructor just introduced.

She has also reached the level of a rank 9 warrior. At this time, it was also a good time to understand the power of source marks.

(About the issue of rank, some readers said that it is confusing so now I will add an explanation: After rank 1 to 9, it is followed by the Master warrior, the King warrior, then the Respected warrior.

As for evolved beasts, there are rank 1 to 10 and rank 2 is equivalent to rank 1 of a warrior. That is to say, if the evolved beast and the warrior are of the same rank, the evolved beast is weaker.

In addition to rank 1 to 10, the next level is the beast king, the beast saint and the beast god. Because the evolved beasts that reach the level of the beast king are huge and possess terrifying physical strength, in general, the top beast kings are no weaker than ordinary warriors and even requires a large number of warriors to be able to kill, as can be seen from the previous Snow lizard. )
