Chapter 286: Pursuit To Kill

Qian Wanshui witnessed Qiu Li’s arm being hacked off by the man and roared out loud as she charged forward in anger!

She slashed her saber down at the man!

“Insignificant talent!” The man looked at Qian Wanshui rushing at him and snorted. He used the sword that was covered in Qiu Li’s blood to attack Qian Wanshui!

Clang clang clang-

The two moved extremely quickly and the clash unleashed a series of sounds.

On the other hand, Guo Ling reacted extremely quickly and picked Qiu Li’s arm from the ground and ran over to him.

“Qian Lin! Grab the emergency suture kit from the bag and all the medicine inside!” The arm that had just been cut off could be reattached and healed with the current technology without any problems.

And Qian Lin was versed in medicine and was considered the support member of the team.

“Got it!”

Qian Lin nodded upon hearing Guo Ling’s command and walked over to Qiu Li. She placed her bag down and retrieved the medical supplies.

Rumble rumble-

At the same time, Lin Xiu realized that more and more Black tooth spiders were appearing. He swung Dark Edge incessantly and summoned more than 10 blazing birds!

The blazing birds converged at the area in front of him and formed a gigantic flaming tornado!

The gigantic tornado blocked the front and the area quickly turned into a bright red in a split second.

All the Black Tooth Spiders were pulled into the tornado and burned to death.

Lin Xiu continued to receive countless experience notifications in his head.

The experience bar kept on growing!

Lin Xiu glanced behind and saw a few men rushing forward.

And Chen Jin and the others were engaged with another man!

‘They caught up again!?’

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted at the sight of this. He had previously guessed that the people whom he had tricked would finally realize and chase after them.

But he did not expect them to catch up so quickly.

Lin Xiu charged over with Dark Edge in hand without hesitation.

“Are you alright?” Lin Xiu walked over to Guo Ling and the others. Qian Lin was using a few special needles and patching Qiu Li’s broken arm up.

Qian Lin was extremely meticulous and professional, as though she had operated many times.

In a few moments, the broken arm was reattached. Upon inspection, no one would realize that his arm had been cut off before.

“The arm was sliced off cleanly, I don’t know whether that’s a good or bad thing.” Qian Lin commented and took a few vials of strange blue liquid and poured them on Qiu Li’s arm.

“Ahhh….” Qiu Li immediately felt the immense pain when the blue liquid seeped into his wounds.

This pain was far more intense than pouring alcohol on wounds!

Lin Xiu looked behind and saw Qian Wanshui and Chen Jin fighting against the man who had cut off Qiu Li’s arm. It was an extremely intense battle.

But more and more warriors were rushing over and joining the fight.

The situation had turned chaotic!

Lin Xiu squinted his eyes and released dense killing intent.

He exerted power in his legs and charged forward!

Sou-

Although Lin Xiu had unleashed Awe of the phoenix multiple times against the Black tooth spiders, it did not consume much of his source strength any longer.

The reason for this was Lin Xiu’s profound comprehension of Awe of the phoenix and the increasingly boundless source strength in his body!

“Go and die!”

The culprit who cut off Qiu Li’s arm saw his helpers joining the battle and immediately revealed a sinister smile. He took the opportunity when Chen Jin was avoiding an attack and struck forward!

Sou-

The sword moved like lightning and produced a vacuum sound as it cut through the air. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

‘I’m dead!’

Chen Jin felt the dense killing intent from behind and subconsciously turned to look to see the man with the sword moving at an inconceivable speed straight at the neck!

The dense sword qi around the sword formed a tornado.

Clang-

Right at this moment when the sword was reaching Chen Jin’s neck, a clear and crisp sound came out!

‘What is that!?’

The man felt a powerful burst of force surge through his sword and into his hand and the expression in his eyes changed.

Chen Jin looked at the sword tip in front of her and took in a breath of cold air. The sword was about to cut in by a bit!

They looked and saw a black spear blocking the sword tip!

“Lin Xiu!?”

Chen Jin looked behind and exclaimed out loud upon seeing Lin Xiu’s figure.

“It’s you!?”

The man evidently noticed Lin Xiu and dense killing intent flooded his eyes.

They all got scared when Lin Xiu killed scar!

Upon thinking about this, a wave of humiliation entered his heart.

He had to kill him, he had to!

“Go and die!” His face changed as he clenched his jaws and extended his sword out towards Lin Xiu!

“Go!”

Lin Xiu immediately moved against the sword when he felt the man’s change in focus and exerted a force to pull Chen Jin’s clothes and flung Chen Jin to the back.

Clang clang clang-

At the same time, Lin Xiu used Dark Edge with his right hand to repel the man’s attack!

The spear and sword collided and produced countless sparks!

“Hmph! Do you think your victory over Scar by catching him off guard with your sudden burst of strength can kill me? What a joke!” The man blocked Lin Xiu’s sharp attacks at lightning speed and spoke out.

‘That’s right, he is a rank 5 warrior. I have nothing to fear!’
