Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu had just returned to his home and as soon as he opened the door, there were two white figures that rushed towards him.

“Hahahahaha — – ”

As both of them got closer to Lin Xiu and were gently rubbing themselves on Lin Xiu, he felt ticklish and even laughed out loud.

Lin Xiu looked at them, and weren’t they Rollie and Xiao Bai?

Xiao Bai, the Ice Crystal White Bird, was much bigger now. As for Rollie, he has also grown into a huge, fluffy ice ball with a ball of huge, dark eyes.

“That’s weird. How did the both of you turn out so big?” Lin Xiu gently brushed through their furs and mumbled to himself.

Plus, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that both Rollie and Xiao Bai had suddenly turned stronger than before.

Compared to when he first got them, it was completely different.

Lin Xiu continued walking into his home and for some reason, his entire house was really clean with no dust seen.

“The both of you. Did you absorb all the energy sources?!”

Lin Xiu went back to his room and saw that the box that hid the energy source was now completely empty. He stared at it in shock and was bemused.

The energy source belonged to the artificial intelligence robot that he destroyed earlier. Although he had gotten it a long time ago, he couldn’t figure out why he wasn’t able to absorb the energy from it.

He didn’t think that the both of them would have absorbed it instead!

Xiao Bai and Rollie started acting coquettish around Lin Xiu as if they really understood what he had just said.

“Fine. You already ate them anyway.” Lin Xiu said helplessly.

Although he still didn’t know what he could do with the energy, Lin Xiu knew that the source contained a large amount of energy.

This would explain why Xiao Bai and Rollie suddenly became so large.

Just when Lin Xiu was about to rest, he could hear a soft sound from outside of his house.

As his level advanced, his hearing improved as well and he could easily hear the noises outside his house.

Lin Xiu raised his brows and walked outside.

Xiao Bai and Rollie went out at a fast speed and rushed out of the door!

“F**k! What is that?!”

Before Lin Xiu stepped out of the house, he heard a familiar voice.

When he heard the familiar voice, Lin Xiu looked out the door and saw the man who was busy dodging the attacks from Xiao Bai and Rollie.

Xiao Bai blew out a gigantic ice-cold breath and caused the entire ground to be covered by a thin layer of ice.

“Ouyang Hang?”

Lin Xiu frowned when he saw Ouyang Hang who was in his courtyard.

Although he had a ‘beef’ with this man, the relationship between them has been much better than before. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Why was he here?

“Lin Xiu, are you here?! Quick! Help me get rid of these two! Damn it!”

Ouyang Hang panicked when he saw Xiao Bai who was continuously blowing out ice-cold breath in his direction.

Plus, it wasn’t only Xiao Bai who was attacking him. Rollie, who looked extremely adorable and cute, gave Ouyang Hang an even scarier feeling.

What on earth is this horrible thing...?!

“Xiao Bai, Rollie.” Lin Xiu called for them.

As soon as Lin Xiu called out for them, Xiao Bai flew straight towards Lin Xiu’s shoulder while Rollie rested next to Lin Xiu.

Ouyang Hang saw what happened, he let out a breath of relief.

“You’re breeding them?” Ouyang Hang took a good look at Xiao Bai and Rollie before asking Lin Xiu.

“Say it. Why are you here?” Lin Xiu rolled his eyes and immediately asked Ouyang Hang.

“You’re being rude.” Ouyang Hang said helplessly.

“Do you know about the World Warrior Competition that will be happening next week?” Ouyang Hang paused for a moment before asking.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded his head. This was the reason why he rushed back to the campus.

Since he had already promised Dean Bai Li, he wouldn’t go back on his words.

Lin Xiu also wanted to see for himself the difference between himself and the warriors from around the world.

“The auditions are about to start. Do you think that you’re good enough?” Ouyang Hang put on a stern look and asked Lin Xiu.

He had no idea that Lin Xiu was now a rank 7 warrior and thought that Lin Xiu was still rank 6.

“Just say whatever you want to.”

“Stop it with the nonsense.” Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders.

“Dumbass.” Ouyang Yang gritted his teeth in rage but soon calmed down.

“I will be going home for a week and will only return before the competition. By then, my abilities would be at rank 7.”

“Rank 7 ?” Lin Xiu frowned as well. It hasn’t been long since he had turned into a rank 6 warrior. How did he manage to become a rank 7 warrior in such a short period of time?

Since Ouyang Hang wasn’t the same as he is. He didn’t have the system like Lin Xiu did.

“This is related to my family’s secret which is why I can’t tell you much. I just hope that you aren’t too weak and that you aren’t able to keep up with me.” Ouyang Hang said it in pride.

“Don’t worry. You won’t be able to fight me.” Lin Xiu said.

“You!” Ouyang Hang clenched onto his fist and almost threw a punch onto Lin Xiu’s face.

He took a deep breath and said to Lin Xiu, “Do you want to know how you can improve your strength within the shortest period of time?”

“Increase my strength?” Lin Xiu was stunned but he looked at Ouyang Hang in suspicion. He didn’t think that Ouyang Hang would be someone so nice and would tell him about these things.

“I wasn’t planning on lying to you.” When Ouyang Hang saw the look in his eyes, he immediately told Lin Xiu.

“Do you know about the Tower of Trial?”

“Of course.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head. Before he came to the Sacred Region Academy, he had already heard about the Tower of Tournament and the Tower of Trial.

The tower of tournament wasn’t something new for Lin Xiu since he has been there a couple of times but as for the tower of trial, Lin Xiu has never stepped into that building.

One should know that there were only two towers that were found in the entire Sacred Region Academy.

“There’s a secret in the topmost floor of the Tower of Trial.” Ouyang Hang took a look around him before whispering to Lin Xiu.

“What’s the secret?” Lin Xiu was surprised and asked subconsciously.

“I don’t know what it is. I only heard it from someone else but from what I know, most of them who reached the 100th floor are rank 9 warriors now.”

Lin Xiu was stunned as his pupils shrunk but he quickly recovered and tried his best to stay calm.

“Hmmm, then?”

Lin Xiu said with an emotionless look on his face.

“Then?” It was Ouyang Hang’s turn to be shocked and he didn’t know what to say as well.

“I just want to tell you that you’re the first person who defeated me. I don’t want you to fail in the qualifying rounds at the World Warrior Championship.”

With that said, Ouyang Hang turned around and left.
