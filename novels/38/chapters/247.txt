Chapter 248: Fire Scale Combat Suit

Soon, Lin Xiu arrived at the exchange center again.

The old man on the counter over there already recognized Lin Xiu’s face. At this moment, seeing Lin Xiu coming over, he couldn’t help but laughed and said, “Young man, you’re here again?”

He looked at Lin Xiu who was approaching and said with a smile.

“En, are there any better combat suits?” Lin Xiu nodded and went straight to the point.

“Combat suit ah…” The old man nodded and began to tap on the screen.

“What kind do you want?”

“The stronger the protection, the better.” Lin Xiu said.

Although the combat suit that he used before was worth about a few million Union coins, after so many battles, it has now begun to have marks.

There were even holes in some places.

And when he reaches the Dark Forest, this battle suit was simply not enough.

“Where are you going?” The old man thought for a moment then asked Lin Xiu curiously.

After all, if you train at the Sacred Region Academy, there was no use for such expensive combat suits.

Only when you go out to fight evolved beasts, the use of these combat suits could be brought to the fullest.

“If you are not going to a dangerous place, there is no need to use such expensive protective clothing. After all, this requires a lot of points.”

“Dark Forest.” Lin Xiu said directly.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, the old man’s gaze suddenly changed.

“You’re going to that darned place?” He seemed to know the horror of that place and said with widened eyes at this time.

If a warrior above rank 6 entered the Dark Forest, the survival rate was only less than 50%.

As for Lin Xiu’s current strength, the old man could easily tell that he only had the strength of a rank 5 warrior.

In his opinion, going to the Dark Forest with his current strength was simply courting death.

“En, is there a recommended combat suit?” Lin Xiu nodded and said.

He knew that there were many combat suits that were specially designed for different places.

So Lin Xiu also knew that wearing a special combat suit specifically designed to deal with the evolved beasts in a certain area would be most effective.

“Are you really going to that place? Young man, you may not know how dangerous it is over there.” The old man had a good impression of Lin Xiu and he reminded him kindly at this time.

“I know what kind of place I am going.” Lin Xiu was also a little bit dumbfounded at this time. Why do these people keep thinking that he will definitely die if he went to the Dark Forest?

But he has an upgrade system and has unlocked the rank 2 gene lock, plus with the ‘Fury’ and ‘Mirror image’, the danger of going there would be greatly reduced.

“Okay.” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words and knowing that Lin Xiu would not listen, the old man swiped on the screen at this time.

“The Fire scale combat suit is made of scales of the rank 7 Flame beast. As the source strength on the body erupts, the scale armor on this combat suit will also transmit a scorching sensation, which produces a layer of hot air for protection.”

“The beasts in the Dark Forest are afraid of fire, so this is definitely the best choice.” The old man explained.

Lin Xiu looked at the Fire scale suit on the screen – it really looked very impressive.

And the protective ability was much better than that of his previous combat suit.

This thing looks good, but the points required were also a lot, right?

“How many points does it require?” Lin Xiu asked.

He only had about 100,000 points currently. If it required too many points, he really couldn’t redeem it.

And had to find something cheaper.

“The inventory of this one is relatively small so it requires quite a lot of points.” The old man replied.

Hearing this old man’s words, Lin Xiu frowned slightly.

Seems like this combat suit is very expensive?

In this case, he really did not have enough points.

“How many?” Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“200,000 points.” The old man looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“Nevermind, I’ll take a look at other combat suits.” Lin Xiu said a bit regretfully.

Sure enough, he was right. The points required for this combat suit were a bit too much and he didn’t have enough points to redeem it.

“Are you really going to the Dark Forest?” The old man ignored Lin Xiu’s words and stared at Lin Xiu.

“Of course.” Lin Xiu nodded.

He has already made an agreement with those people and he would definitely be there.

Also, the experience gained from killing the evolved beasts was much more compared to training here.

“How many points do you have now?” The old man asked.

Lin Xiu took out his card and pressed on the inquiry sign at the side. It instantly showed that he had a little over 100,000 points.

“100,000 points, you still need half more…” The old man touched his beard, then looked at Lin Xiu and said, “I can lend you 100,000 points.”

“You can lend me?” Lin Xiu was stunned when he heard the old man’s words.

He originally wanted to redeem a suit that could be exchanged for about 100,000 points.

After all, he couldn’t simply get 100,000 points all at once right now.

“Yes, I can lend 100,000 points to you and you can return them to me within this semester.” The old man nodded.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, looked at him, and said, “What conditions do you have?”

There was no free lunch in the world. Lin Xiu didn’t believe that this old man would lend him 100,000 points just because he was handsome.

Of course, unless he was an old gay.

With that thought, Lin Xiu suddenly felt a chill.

“You are going to the Dark Forest to complete a mission, right?” The old man looked at Lin Xiu, as if he had already guessed something.

Lin Xiu nodded, there was nothing to hide.

“When you go there, help me find something.” The old man shifted his eyes and said to Lin Xiu.

While he was talking, he took out a card and soon, a picture appeared on it.

The picture was an introduction of a plant.

“Dark red spider lily – help me find this plant and bring it back.” The old man said aloud.

“Isn’t this the legendary red spider lily? There really is such a thing?” Lin Xiu looked at this black flower and said in surprise.

“No, it’s just a plant that looks very similar to the legendary red spider lily, that’s how it got its name.” The old man shook his head and said.

“There are a lot of these things in the Dark Forest but can’t simply leave the Sacred Region Academy. You only need to find this thing for me and bring it back, then I will lend you 100,000 points.”
