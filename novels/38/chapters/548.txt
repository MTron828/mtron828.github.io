Boom–

The color-changing mantis was attacked and its body was not directly split in half, but it fell heavily to the ground.

Seeing this scene, the man heaved a sigh of relief.

Glancing at the people around him who looked very alert, he couldn’t help sneering proudly, “Are you guys afraid of this kind of thing?”

“Ah!!!”

As soon as he spoke, a scream came out of his mouth.

Lin Xiu, who has been paying attention, also clearly saw that his foot was cut off by something!

At this moment, his whole body fell to the ground.

Like the previous scene, a large number of scavenger crows gathered towards his body because of the outflow of blood!

“Go away! Go away!”

He fell on the ground watching this scene, his body suddenly sat up, then frantically waved the sword in his hand, trying to kill all these Scavenger crows.

But these Scavenger crows seemed to be crazy and they gathered frantically towards his bleeding wound.

Now it was impossible for the man to expand the ‘Sphere’ again and soon a voice that made one’s scalp tingling came over.

Under the man’s body, there was another color-changing mantis!

And the sickle-like forelimb cut off the man’s head directly.

“Ah!!!”

At the same time, there were also wails coming from the surroundings.

“A lot of… color-changing mantises…”

At this time, the warriors who seemed to be watching a play were all shocked.

There were so many color-changing mantises hidden on the ground!

And many people who were searching for odd crystals on the ground had their hands directly cut off by those color-changing mantises.

“Go! Let’s go!!!”

Just now, it seemed as if they had entered a treasure land and these excited warriors all began trembling and shouting to leave this place.

“It is quite dangerous here after all.” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes at this time, then said secretly.

Kala——

At this moment, a sound rang under his feet and the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank suddenly and his body moved in a flash like a phantom.

And the skeleton under his feet just now was cut in half!

Below this, there was a color-changing mantis whose appearance was very similar to the color of the surrounding skeletons!

Damn beast!

Lin Xiu’s eyes changed, then he waved the Dark Edge spear he was holding and a flaming bird charged towards it instantly.

The reaction speed of this color-changing mantis was not slow at all. Seeing the flames rushing towards it, it flapped its wings and quickly dodged.

Lin Xiu looked at this scene, snorted coldly and the movement of ‘Without a Trace’ started to work, then he charged forward with the Dark Edge spear.

Boom–

The speed of the spear piercing was very fast and the color-chaing mantis, which was trying to dodge the flaming bird, was directly penetrated by Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear!

“Ding!”

“Congratulations Master for killing the rank 6 color-changing mantis and gaining 10 million experience!”

Lin Xiu didn’t have a lot of experience now, but now he was about to be upgraded. No matter how little points he got, they were still points.

And what Lin Xiu wanted was the sickle-like forelimbs of this color-changing mantis.

Looking at the corpse of the mantis, he directly took out a small dagger and separated its pair of sickle-like forelimbs from its body.

Then he found a backpack around and put it directly into the backpack.

After doing all this, he looked around and saw that many warriors had their hands and feet cut and broken by those mantises, then pecked by those terrifying scavenger crows and turned into bones.

Now Lin Xiu knew why so many odd crystals could be picked up here. It turns out that there are so many warriors who died here and there are probably warriors who die here every day.

Lin Lang and others were probably lucky and did not alarm the color-changing mantises and escaped the catastrophe.

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t dare to be careless, because the color of these color-changing mantises would change with the surrounding environment, so it was very dangerous.

Directly unfolding the ‘Sphere’, a light blue circular barrier surrounded Lin Xiu.

Boom–

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear and swept his gaze across the surroundings.

Soon, another color-changing mantis was discovered.

The combat power of these discolored mantises was not particularly high. Lin Xiu easily killed another one and just like before, he cut off its scythe-like limbs.

And Lin Xiu couldn’t see the odd crystal in its body and under the current situation, it was not easy to dig out the odd crystal from its corpse.

Buzzing-

Just as Lin Xiu was hunting for those mantises, a slight sound made Lin Xiu’s face change.

“Go to hell!”

A warrior not far away watched Lin Xiu unfold the ‘Sphere’ to hunt those mantises and couldn’t help sneering.

Because at this time, behind Lin Xiu, there was a color-changing mantis fluttering its wings and rushing towards Lin Xiu!

Soon, the color-changing mantis rushed to Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ and its forelimbs was about to break Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’!

Once a warrior’s “Sphere” was destroyed, it wouldn’t be possible to unfold another one immediately.

If Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ broke at this time, his situation would be very dangerous!

Zizizi——

But the moment the color-changing mantis touched Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’, it made a strange sound and soon, white smoke emitted from its body and even its body turned black.

It’s like, it’s burnt!

How can this be!

The warrior who saw this scene opened his eyes wide, full of disbelief.

Boom–

Lin Xiu turned around with a shot and directly smashed the head of this mantis.

“Eh? You want to sneak an attack on me?” Lin Xiu raised his brows at this time, then said lightly.

On his ‘Sphere’, there was lightning around. An evolved beast of this rank couldn’t withstand this terrifying voltage at all.

This color-changing mantis was electrocuted.

But what surprised Lin Xiu was that even so, its scythe-like forelimbs didn’t seem to be affected by his own lightning at all.

After that, Lin Xiu continued searching for the color-changing mantis here. After about an hour of hunting, Lin Xiu’s backpack was already loaded witha lot of the forelimbs of the color-changing mantis..
