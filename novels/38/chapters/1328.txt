1329 The God King Has Arrived!

He was feeling exhausted.

Lin Xiu rested on his chair and was panting.

The match that happened earlier has been exhausting.

Plus, the aftermath of ‘Rage’ was about to hit him.

!!

It would have been nice if Rollie was with him. This way, the aftermath of it would disappear quickly.

“I am surprised. I thought that I would be fighting Yuan Zheng this time.”

“I didn’t think that it would be you.”

Then, a man appeared next to Lin Xiu.

Xiao Qingchen.

“Well, you would have to win them before getting the chance to fight me.”

Lin Xiu looked at Xiao Qingchen who appeared next to him before speaking gently.

Due to the aftermath from the ‘Rage’, Lin Xiu was now looking incredibly pale.

“Both of them are weak.”

Xiao Qingchen stared at Niu Jing and Sun Tao, who was already on stage, before giving off a cold comment.

Hearing how confident he was, Lin Xiu frowned.

Niu Jing and Sun Tao had pretty good stats when he analysed them using the Analytic Eye.

They were definitely much stronger than the warriors that he had met before.

Well, of course, none of them were comparable to Yuan Zheng.

But….Xiao Qingchen could confidently say that they’re too weak?!

Was he being over confident or was it because he really did have the ability?

“Please be prepared to start!”

One of the staff shouted out loud for the warriors to be prepared.

“We shall be fighting each other very soon.”

Xiao Qingchen smirked as he walked away.

Then, he leaped and directly landed at the center of the stage.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he watched the match.

He would like to see how Xiao Qingchen would be able to easily defeat both of them.

“Xiao Qingchen, you have become quite arrogant.”

Niu Jing stared at Xiao Qingchen who just got on stage, looking ignorant and he was feeling quite unhappy about it.

“What’s wrong? I remember that you lost to me a few years ago.”

Xiao Qingchen shrugged his shoulders.

“That was years ago!!!”

Niu Jing’s expression turned dull after hearing what Xiao Qingchen was saying.

“Forget it, Niu Jing. He will definitely taste failure this time.”

Sun Tao spoke in a cold tone.

“Hmph!”

Niu Jing sneered as he kept his eyes fixed on Xiao Qingchen. There was a murderous intention in them.

Both of them already knew who they had to fight in this match and had agreed to defeat Xiao Qingchen first.

It was already clear how powerful this man was. If they didn’t work together, both of them would be eliminated.

“Come then. Both of you together.”

Xiao Qingchen chuckled in response.

As the match started, both Niu Jing and Sun Tao rushed towards Xiao Qingchen!

The fight finally started!

Lin Xiu, who was seated in the audience seat, kept his eyes on the fight that was happening on stage.

Similar to the match from before, Xiao Qingchen only uses one element.

Electricity.

He seems to have used these lightning bolts to its peak.

In the end, Xiao Qingchen won the match.

As for the other two warriors, they were both killed by the horrifying lightning bolts.

At the same time, Xiao Qingchen seemed to have been injured.

“The finals will be happening in two hours!”

The loud voice from the announcer rang through the room.

“In two hours time…that would be the finals already?”

Baili Haoling mumbled to herself after hearing the announcement.

...

Rollie and Little Bai, who were sound asleep on her shoulder, finally opened their eyes.

“Your pets looked unique.”

The middle aged man seated next to Baili Haoling noticed Rollie and Little Bai who had just woken up and he was pleasantly surprised.

He thought that they were both toys and he never expected for them to be two evolved beasts that were asleep.

Plus, he could also feel that these two evolved beasts were not common, lowly ones.

“Old man, who do you think would win the contest?”

Baili Haoling peered at him before asking. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I am not an old man!”

When the middle aged man heard what Baili Haoling said, he glared at her with his big eyes!

He was only a middle aged man….why was she calling him an old man?!

However, he quickly calmed himself and said, “From the match earlier, Xiao Qingchen’s abilities would probably be the same as your city lord.”

...

“With both of them uninjured, your city lord may not have a chance of winning Xiao Qingchen.”

“From the match earlier, Xiao Qingchen only got minor injuries but when Lin Xiu fought with Yuan Zheng, it was tough and he must have exhausted most of his energy.

“Hmph! Old man! You’ll know later that your judgment is incorrect!”

Lei Chong replied in a cold tone after hearing what he said.

“Don’t call me an old man!!”

The middle aged man glared at Lei Chong as if he was ready to fight him if they ever called him ‘old man’ again.

Xiao Qingchen, who had just won the match, jumped off the stage.

As he returned to his seat, he noticed that Lin Xiu was missing and nowhere to be found.

“Looks like you went to get ready.”

“But….it wouldn’t matter. I will be winning the match no matter what.”

Xiao Qingchen sneered as he muttered to himself.

At the same time, Lin Xiu was in the training room backstage.

Although the aftermath of ‘Rage’ has disappeared, he has still used up most of his source energy in the fight earlier.

He had to quickly activate his ‘Cultivation Technique’ in order to absorb the thick energy in the air.

He still had 2 hours left.

With two hours, it would be more than enough for Lin Xiu to replenish all of his energy.

Time passed quickly and for Lin Xiu, who was buried in his cultivation, two hours were like a blink of an eye.

“Huuuuu~”

As Lin Xiu let out a huge breath, he finally opened his eyes.

Both of them were now filled with energy.

“The finals would be starting soon1”

The audience started going wild as they heard the announcement.

“The God King!!!! The God King is here!!”

Plus, a group of them noticed something and started screaming at the top of their lungs.

There was a bright glow of light that appeared on top of the arena and it was coming down slowly from the sky.

Baili Haoling narrowed her eyes when she saw this.

She could feel a strong pressuring sense that came from this man.

It was incredibly strong!
