Chapter 1068: Bai Chuan’s Revenge

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“En. They are in another area.”

Ye Kai nodded his head.

At this point, Lin Xiu didn’t know if he should be laughing or crying. This was Bai Di City, a place ruled by the Bai family. Ye Kai brought his men to Bai Di City hoping that the Chen family would go against the Bai family. This was definitely something impossible.

However, what the Chen family did was definitely something horrible.

“Chen Jing, the head of the Chen family, he was the one….”

Ye Kai gritted his teeth as he continued.

“It’s best for you to stay here for now. I have a feeling that they will be hunting for you in the city.”

Lin Xiu took a look around before suggesting it to Ye Kai.

This area looked like it would be harder for them to find him.

“Here.”

Then, Lin Xiu moved his right hand and the gold box that was placed in his expansion space appeared in his hand.

“This…”

When he saw what Lin Xiu was holding onto, the look in Ye Kai’s eyes changed.

The thing that Lin Xiu was handing over to him definitely wasn’t something simple.

Plus, this gold box looked mysterious as it was a little different from the other boxes.

It felt like there was a strong energy coming from inside the box.

“Open it and take a look at it.”

Lin Xiu told Ye Kai to open the box when it appeared on his palm.

Ye Kai was stunned but soon, he nodded his head.

He held onto the gold box and slowly opened it.

As soon as the box was opened, there was an eye-blinding light that’s shining from inside it.

This was an odd crystal! An odd crystal with intense energy!

“I can’t have this.”

Ye Kai saw that it was an odd crystal and quickly closed it before returning it to Lin Xiu.

The energy that was coming from the odd crystal was shocking.

He has never felt such a terrifying energy from any other odd crystals.

This must definitely be one that belonged to a saint beast!

This was a priceless treasure.

“This odd crystal wouldn’t be useful for me. Keep it for yourself, Uncle Ye. It may be able to help you.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and put the box back into Ye Kai’s arms.

It has been a long time since he met Ye Kai and Ye Kai also must have been through something miraculous that he was now already a respected warrior.

But, being a respected warrior was weak.

This saint beat odd crystal may be nothing for Lin Xiu but it definitely would be able to help Ye Kai greatly increase his abilities.

Plus, this odd crystal was much stronger than the one that he took away from Huang Fulin and the rest of the party.

Once Ye Kai absorbed it, it may also be possible for him to become a sage warrior.

“But…”

“You don’t have to say anything else. Uncle Ye, just accept it.”

Lin Xiu shook his hand and spoke in a domineering tone.

“Thank you, Young master.”

Ye Kai stopped pushing away the gift and thanked Lin Xiu gratefully.

“For the next few days, you should stay here and absorb the energy from this odd crystal. I will be leaving Bai Di City for some time.”

Lin Xiu told Ye Kai.

“En.”

Ye Kai nodded his head.

Boom boom – –

Then, all of a sudden, Lin Xiu felt something and his pupil shrank.

“Move!”

Then, Lin Xiu roared as he grabbed onto Ye Kai and leaped.

They went through the ceiling and flew out of the factory.

As he took a closer look at it, he noticed that there was a large number of huge, black insects that entered into the factory.

Within a short period of time, the entire factory was filled with beetles that were the size of a human.

The beetles then started chewing off the walls of the factory.

The factory that they were in easily was instantly destroyed.

“What…..what is that?!”

Then, as Ye Kai’s body was floating in the air, the look in his eyes changed.

These huge beetles were terrifying. If it wasn’t because Lin Xiu had reacted fast enough and pulled him into the air, he would not have noticed that there were such dangers headed toward the house.

“Hmph! You managed to run away.”

Then, a cold voice came from the distance.

Lin Xiu, who was floating in the air, looked up and saw an elderly with a middle-aged man who were in the air as well.

One of them looked familiar and it was none other than Bai Chuan.

The man was the only one from Tang Sect who managed to escape.

“So, it’s you.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes when he saw who it was.

As he looked down, he could see thousands of beetles moving around and it looked disgusting.

“You managed to run away the last time but today, I want you to be buried here!”

Bai Chuan glared at Lin Xiu and screamed.

“I think you meant the opposite.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and answered calmly.

When he fought the men from Tang Sect, this middle-aged man managed to escape by using a special type of source mark energy.

But now, this man was saying that Lin Xiu was the one who ran? Such a ridiculous joke.

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, Bai Chuan’s face turned dark.

“I’m curious, how did you find me?”

Lin Xiu looked at Bai Chuan and asked out of curiosity.

“You don’t have to know the answer to this.”

Bai Chuan sneered and ignored Lin Xiu.

“Bai Chuan, how could you be so weak? You were bullied by a young man?!”

The elderly standing by Bai Chuan chuckled. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Stop it with the nonsense. Kill him and I will agree to any conditions you ask for.”

Bai Chuan sneered.

“That’s what you promised.”

There was a peculiar look that appeared in the old man’s eyes.

Then, there was a bright green glow that appeared on his forehead.

The source mark looked like a worm and it was on the old man’s forehead.

As his energy was slowly being released, all of the huge beetles underneath them seemed to be summoned and started flapping their wings!

When Ye Kai saw what was happening, he was in shock.

“Don’t move.”

Lin Xiu said to Ye Kai.

Then, there was an array that appeared and it completely covered Ye Kai’s body.

This…

When Ye Kai saw what it was, he was surprised.

However, from the corner of his eyes, he noticed that the huge, black beetles were getting closer.

“Be careful!”

While Ye Kai screamed, Lin Xiu’s body was already covered by the huge, black beetles.

There were more and more of them that surrounded Lin Xiu and his body was now a huge black ball in the air.

“The boy will definitely be killed. These are blood-sucking beetles.”

When the old man saw how Lin Xiu’s body had completely disappeared amongst the beetles, he spoke to the middle-aged man beside him.

“It’s good news that he’s dead.”

Bai Chuan laughed coldly.

In order to defeat Lin Xiu, he had purposely gotten this elderly to fight Lin Xiu.

“Don’t forget what you have promised me.”

The old man peered at Bai Chuan before reminding him.

“Hmph!”

Although Bai Chuan wasn’t happy with it, he still had to nod his head in agreement.

“Hmm?”

Suddenly, Bai Chuan frown when he noticed that something was wrong.
