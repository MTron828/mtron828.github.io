Chapter 756: News

What’s that noise?!

Lin Xiu quickly turned to the direction where the noise was coming from and he could see a bright light heading towards them!

Koong loong – –

At that moment, there was a huge explosive sound that followed the bright light.

There was a huge explosion that appeared in the area that they were in.

“Hahahahah… a bunch of idiots! Go to hell!!”

The muscular man from before was carrying a huge rocket bomb as he laughed and said to his men.

These rocket bomb had a huge corrosive effect and those who were attacked were definitely dead.

In this situation, it would be impossible for them to release ‘Yuan’.

“Damn it, bit*h! She stabbed me with the dagger.”

The man with the injury on his palm was using a healing potion to mend his wounds and the cut on his palm soon disappeared.

The man said in a twisted manner as he looked at the wildfire that was happening ahead of them.

“This….how is this possible?!”

At that moment, one of the warriors from their group noticed that something was odd and screamed in surprise.

“What’s wrong?”

When the muscular man heard what was said, he frowned in dissatisfaction.

“You…..look at you….”

As he turned around, he noticed that in the midst of the wildfire, there was a huge ‘Yuan’!!!

It was dark red in colour and there were multiple lightning surrounding the entire ‘Yuan’!

What was that?!

The expression on his face changed as well when he saw what happened.

This was because it was Lin Xiu and his gang who were standing inside the ‘Yuan’.

All of them were covered by the ‘Yuan’, none of them looked injured.

“I …. That was scary.”

Liu Pan said as he gently patted his chest.

As he looked around, there was still fire burning brightly; even the stones around him were corroded.

As for the ground around them, they were all badly corroded as well.

They knew that if it wasn’t because of Lin Xiu’s ‘Yuan’, they would have melted to ash.

Qian Ling and An Qi were frightened as well.

They were also shocked at the same time.

That’s right, they were shocked.

Lin Xiu was able to release such a huge ‘Yuan’. This would only be possible with a huge amount of source energy.

Lin Xiu stared at the warriors who were standing close by and his eyes were filled with a murderous intention.

He didn’t want to cause any trouble but for now, he had no other choice.

He gently signalled his brain and reabsorbed his ‘Yuan’.

Then, Lin Xiu grabbed onto his black spear and quickly leaped forward.

“Kill him!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was heading for him, the muscular warrior screamed in rage.

With his command, the rest of the warriors around him grabbed onto their weapons as well and started attacking Lin Xiu.

Koong Loong – –

Lin Xiu released a large number of flaming birds from his Dark Edge.

Most of them were in fear when they saw the flaming birds rushing towards them.

They did not have the time to hesitate and immediately released their ‘Yuan’.

They were fortunate that the ‘Yuan’ managed to block the flaming birds that came from Lin Xiu.

However,they could still feel the strong heat around them.

They were sweating profusely.

Plus, when the flaming birds surrounded their ‘Yuan’, it didn’t break through it instead, it completely blocked their vision. All they could see were flames around them!

Boom —

One of the warriors was still waiting for the flames around him to disappear when he could feel his ‘Yuan’ being attacked.

The impact was so strong that his body almost flew out.

His ‘Yuan’ remained intact.

At the same time, the flames surrounding his ‘Yuan’ soon disappeared and he could see that it was Lin Xiu who was attacking his ‘Yuan’ with his spear.

“It’s useless!”

When the man saw what Lin Xiu was trying to do, he screamed in rage.

A warrior’s ‘Yuan’ was their strongest defence. If it wasn’t because the warrior becomes exhausted, the ‘Yuan’ would never break!

Just when he was screaming, he noticed that there was a huge crack on hi ‘Yuan’!

How is this even possible?!

His face turned pale as he noticed cracks all over his ‘Yuan’.

This was the first time that he met with such a situation. His ‘Yuan’ was slowly breaking because of another warrior’s attack!

“NOOOOO!!!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was still continuing his attack, the man screamed in fear.

Crack – –

As Lin Xiu continued to swing his spear, the man’s ‘Yuan’ immediately broke into pieces!

Koong Loong – –

Suddenly, there were flames that covered his entire body and he turned into a human torch!

The intense pain caused him to lose all of his abilities.

Lin Xiu then thrust his spear forward and caused his head to explode.

With the same manner, Lin Xiu continued attacking the others.

He activated his skill – ‘Disapppearing without a trace’ and Lin Xiu’s figure was like a shadow. He was moving at a horrifying speed.

“AHHHHHH!!!!”

There were screamed everywhere as their ‘Yuan’s were all being destroyed.

Liu Pan, An Qi and Qian Ling, who wanted to help, instantly stopped as they were stunned.

“This…..this is crazy...”

Liu Pan’s eyes were widened in shock and his double bladed axe almost fell to the ground. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

An Qi and Qian Ling looked excited.

This was the first time that they realised how cool a spear was.

Plus, Lin Xiu was looking extremely hot as he fought the other men.

‘Clean Sweep’!!!

Lin Xiu, who was busy fighting, looked extremely serious.

He swung his spear around and gave them a good attack.

Koong Loong – –

With a loud explosion, all of the other men flew into the distance.

The ‘Yuan’s that protected them exploded as well.

Their bodies have all been torn into pieces within a blink of an eye.

At least 6 rank 9 warriors were killed by a single skill from Lin Xiu.

“You shall be the next one.”

Even when he released such a powerful skill, Lin Xiu didn’t look tired at all.

As he turned around, Lin Xiu warned the muscular man who was the leader of the gang.

“You…..”

His eyes were filled with disbelief!

That was impossible! How could this man be so powerful?!

As Lin Xiu started walking towards him, he was still trembling even when he stayed inside his ‘Yuan’.

This was because the man before him could break ‘Yuan’s!

What’s the use of it then?!

Fear caused him to shake from head to toe and he did not have any motivation to fight Lin Xiu.

Seeing how Lin Xiu was getting closer to him, he could no longer take the pressure and immediately got on his knees, “Please...don’t kill me!”

“I can give your information in exchange!”
