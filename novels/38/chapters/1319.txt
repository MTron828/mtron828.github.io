1320 The Powerful Xiao Qingchen

All of the currants gathered together and formed a huge bird.

The huge electric bird flapped its wings and went straight toward the huge wild boar!

Boom – –

As the bird and the cow collided with each other, there was a deafening sound that rang through the room.

Lei Chong subconsciously covered his ears.

The entire stage shook vigorously.

The strong impact had spread to the audience seat.

Just as the bird and the wild cow collided with each other, the cow instantly disappeared!

The currents circulating around the huge bird had reduced but it didn’t completely disappear!

It continued flying towards Zhao Xintong!

Zhao Xintong saw what was happening but his body was still in the air due to the huge impact that happened earlier.

Before he could steady himself, the huge bird was already coming at him.

His pupil shrunk subconsciously.

The currant on the huge bird has been reduced due to how it has collided with the wild cow that he had released.

But, even so, he could still clearly feel the overpowering energy that came from the bird.

If he were to collide with the bird, his body would be turned into crisp.

Damn it!

He swore silently in his heart. As he tried to release his ‘sphere’, he was also using other skills to hide from the bird.

But, there seemed to be a tracking device installed on the bird and it was only targeting Zhao Xintong! It would be waiting for him in the direction where Zhao Xintong ran to!

Boom – –

Soon, the huge bird landed on his ‘sphere’!

Sizzling – –

The huge bird dissipated as all the currants enveloped Zhao Xintong’s sphere.

He had cold sweat all over his face when he saw how his ‘sphere’ was completely covered by the horrifying currants.

If he didn’t release his ‘sphere’ in time and got hit by them, his life would be in danger.

At the same time, Xiao Qingchen wanted to continue his attack on Zhao Xintong.

However, he seemed to have felt something and turned around with his huge machete.

Clang – –

Peng Wei, who had turned into black fog, suddenly appeared from behind Xiao Qingchen.

Peng Wei had a sword in his hands.

He wanted to stab Xiao Qingchen from behind but he didn’t think that Xiao Qingchen would be able to react in time.

Xiao Qingchen pushed away the sword with his machete and then swung it at Peng Wei! Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Xiu – –

However, as the machete landed on Peng Wei, his body turned into black fog and he completely disappeared!

“Interesting.”

Xiao Qingchen wasn’t even annoyed when this happened and instead, there was a smile that appeared on his face.

“Go to hell!!!”

Zhao Xintong, who finally had the time to breathe, picked up his spear and attacked!

With his skills activated, he appeared behind Xiao Qingchen and wanted to pierce through Xiao Qingchen’s body with his spear.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

At that moment, there were multiple spears that appeared and each were attacking at full force, sending loud explosions into the air.

Xiao Qingchen didn’t react in time and all of the attacks landed on his back.

Zhao Xintong finally looked happy as he thought that he could defeat Xiao Qingchen.

“Are you done?”

However, right at that moment, Xiao Qingchen slowly turned around and a cold smile appeared on his face.

Zhao Xintong’s eyes widened in shock. This was because he knew that each of his attacks had landed on Xiao Qingchen but it doesn’t seem to have any effect on Xiao Qingchen!

The sharp tip of his spear couldn’t even pierce through his body as if there was something blocking him.

“He gathered all of his energy and placed it across his back…”

Lin Xiu was surprised as well to see what Xiao Qingchen had done.

Xiao Qingchens’ mind was brilliant. He was able to quickly gather all his energy and spread it all across his back, using it as a unique shield.

Just like a ‘sphere’, all of the attacks landed on the layer behind him and it has not done any damage to Xiao Qingchen!

To be able to do it in such a manner, his reflex would have to be quick and he would have to make sure that all of the energy has been distributed evenly. With how Zhao Xintong was attacking him continuously, Xiao Qingchen would have been injured at parts where there wasn’t even protection.

This man was indeed brilliant.

The other party would be defeated soon.

...

“This…. This is impossible!”

Zhao Xintong, who was on stage, was shocked. His eyes were opened wide and he couldn’t believe what he had just witnessed.

“Hahaha…”

Xiao Qingchen had a hideous smile on his face. As Zhao Xintong tried to attack again, his spear was caught in the air!

Zhao Xintong’s eyes were already wide open and as he tried to continue his attacks, it felt as if he had been pinned. No matter how hard he tried, he couldn’t move at all!

“Let me show you something fun.”

Xiao Qingchen sneered as he released overpowering and frightening lightning bolts from his arm!

Boom – –

The terrifying lightning bolts went through the spear and instantly entered Zhao Xintong’s body!

His entire body was being attacked by the currents and all the hair on his body was standing on its ends. There was also smoke that appeared all over his body.

Then, the skin around his body turned black.

...

Following that, his entire body started burning like a piece of charcoal.

Xiao Qingchen then finally let go.

As for Zhao Xintong, his body fell onto the ground.

His body was still burning like a fireball.

Slowly, all his flesh disappeared and only his bones were left on the stage.

All of the audience had their eyes opened wide.

They were all shocked by what had happened.

Zhao Xintong was a warrior god but within such a short period of time, his entire body was burnt to ash by those terrifying lightning bolts!

Peng Wei, who wanted to ambush Xiao Qingchen, quickly stopped as well when he saw what happened.

Zhao Xintong is dead!

He felt defeated as well.

Xiao Qingchen…..how could he be so powerful?!

“That current of his…..it’s incredible!”

Lei Chong, who was in the audience seat, started muttering to himself.

Baili Haoling frowned instead.

Her instincts tell her that this was a dangerous man.

If Lin Xiu had to fight this man…

“It’s getting interesting…”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes as he witnessed the fight.

There was no fear seen in his eyes but instead, he looked excited.

It would definitely be more interesting to fight powerful opponents.

He would be able to gain more EXP if he fights powerful opponents, just like Huangfu Gu.

“Well, you’re next.”

Xiao Qingchen then had his eyes fixed on Peng Wei.

Peng Wei couldn’t help but tremble when he heard this.
