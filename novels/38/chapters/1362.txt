1363 Controlling the Netherworld flame!

At this moment, the Netherworld Flame can no longer cause any harm to him.

There will be no blood marks on the body.

“Phew, this flame is really terrifying…”

At this moment, in the midst of this Netherworld Flame, Lin Xiu said to himself.

!!

Although he didn’t suffer any physical damage, his soul was still burned.

It hurts.

“This is just the outer flames…”

Lin Xiu still felt that he had underestimated the power of the flames.

At this time, as Lin Xiu continued to walk into the depths of the flames, blood redness began to appear on his body again.

The flesh and blood slowly peeled off piece by piece.

But while peeling off, Lin Xiu’s powerful healing ability made the flesh and blood begin to heal again.

“The physical pain can still be endured, but…”

But the feeling of being roasted in the soul is really hard to bear!

At this moment, Lin Xiu covered his head with his hands, and the severe pain almost made him collapse.

No, I haven’t reached the source of the fire, I can’t just stop like this!

Lin Xiu bit his lip until it bled.

Walking forward step by step, Lin Xiu seemed to forget the time at this moment.

The body was constantly being destroyed and repaired, becoming stronger.

After the soul was honed, not only did it not drive Lin Xiu crazy, but it made him even stronger.

Continue!

As Lin Xiu walked forward step by step, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the source of the Netherworld flame seemed to be in front.

“Finally found…”

Looking at the small blue flame in front of him, Lin Xiu murmured to himself.

He wasn’t sure how much time had gone by, maybe one day, maybe two days, or…

Lin Xiu couldn’t remember clearly. He just knew that his flesh and blood were constantly being destroyed and reborn, and his soul was honed to be more tenacious.

Now the peripheral flames of the Netherworld flame can no longer cause any harm to him.

“I’ll try…”

Lin Xiu looked at this scene with his eyes, and the expression in his eyes became determined.

Seeing this small flame, he stretched out his hand and slowly touched it.

Now is the most terrifying beginning.

At this time, all the energy in the whole body is mobilized to protect his internal organs.

When his hand was about to touch the small flame, Lin Xiu stopped for a moment.

Then his expression became extremely firm.

His fingers touched this little flame directly!

Boom——

As soon as Lin Xiu’s body touched it, his whole body was immediately covered in blue flames, and he instantly turned into a burning man!

At this moment, the flesh and blood of the body fell apart at an extremely fast speed.

If it wasn’t for his own power to protect the internal organs, even the internal organs would have exploded now.

This flame is too terrifying!

“Ah!!!”

And at this moment, Lin Xiu let out a loud roar.

Because he clearly felt that his soul was being roasted even more horribly.

It seems like it’s about to collapse!

Get in!!!

At this time, Lin Xiu relied on the last sliver of reason, and directly sucked the original flame of the Netherworld flame into his body!

Boom——

The moment it was sucked into the body, there was an extremely loud sound.

Lin Xiu’s whole body seemed to explode.

But at this moment, a dazzling golden light flashed out.

‘Golden Body Immortality’!!!

At this moment, Lin Xiu activated the ‘Golden Body Immortality’ skill, and successfully resisted the pain caused when the source flames of the Netherworld flame entered his body.

But after this second passed, Lin Xiu’s flesh and blood were instantly burned by the flames.

In the whole body, there is only one golden bone left!

But the soul strength has not been wiped out, Lin Xiu is not really dead yet!

...

At this time, if you look carefully, you can see that there were already a lot of cracks in the bones.

It seems that even the bones are about to be burned and cracked by this terrifying Netherworld Flame.

And at this time, because his soul was being roasted continuously, Lin Xiu was on the verge of collapsing.

I can’t die…

I’m still waiting for Luo Yue!!!

Lin Xiu, relying on his strong willpower, persisted crazily!

This persistence lasted for some time.

Originally, the surrounding area looked like a sea of flames, but now, the flames had begun to slowly disappear.

Only a golden skull was left sitting on the ground.

Taking a closer look, there is a small blue flame floating in the middle of the golden skull.

There are also many small flames on the bones.

...

But these small flames seem to be unable to cause any harm to the golden bone.

“Finally… finished absorbing.”

At this moment, an ethereal sound rang out.

That’s right, this is Lin Xiu’s voice.

After reaching the level of God warrior, he can already use the power of his thoughts to speak out.

After experiencing the terrifying burning and tempering, the soul finally stabilized.

Right now, his soul is far stronger than the average God warrior.

“It’s just that it turned into a skull again.”

Lin Xiu looked at his body and couldn’t help but cry.

After standing up, Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something.

“Oh right…”

With a thought, Lin Xiu took out three large glass bottles containing energy liquid from the expansion space.

These are all obtained by killing the plant god.

As long as there is external energy, I can use this energy to reshape my physical body!

At this time, following Lin Xiu’s thoughts, all the caps of the glass bottles were opened.

Soon, a large amount of energy liquid flew into the air, instantly forming a huge energy ball.

Lin Xiu, who had already turned into a skeleton, jumped into the air and entered the energy ball.

A large amount of energy liquid instantly covered Lin Xiu’s bones.

Soon, the energy liquid slowly transformed into Lin Xiu’s flesh and blood.

Slowly, under the guidance of Lin Xiu’s power, these energy liquids, which had been transformed into flesh and blood, began to materialize. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

About an hour later, Lin Xiu’s real body was formed again!

His skin at this time looks like a newborn baby, extremely smooth and delicate.

“Phew, comfortable.”

Lin Xiu exhaled at this time, subconsciously wiped his head, and found that the hair hadn’t grown yet.

With a thought, at this moment, his hair grew rapidly.

Good!

Although the physical body has been reshaped, the current physical body is no weaker than the previous one.

And even stronger!

As Lin Xiu stretched out his right hand, with a thought, a blue flame appeared in the palm of his hand!

Netherworld Flame!
