1389 Fighting the Frost Dragon (Part 2)

As the saber in his hand danced wildly, all of a sudden terrifying wind blades rushed directly toward the wings of the frost dragon!

Whoosh whoosh——

The wind blade was so terrifying that there were crackling sounds in the air.

The wings that had been blasted out of the hole by Lin Xiu, at this time, with the impact of the terrifying wind blade, its frosty wings were blasted to pieces in an instant.

Roar–

The Frost Dragon became even crazier at this time.

Its tail swept towards Zhang Xiuxian at an extremely fast speed. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Zhang Xiuxian was still releasing a powerful wind blade to attack the frost giant dragon, but at this moment, he seemed to feel something and his body retreated directly.

But now, it’s too late.

The huge tail directly knocked his whole body into the air and fell heavily on the ground far away.

The whole body is embedded in the frost on the ground.

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu frowned.

This Frost Dragon is indeed quite strong and now here, Lin Xiu can still feel that his source strength is being suppressed by the power of the rules.

If he used the flame power again, his source strength will soon be emptied.

It will be dangerous then!

Damn it!

Lin Xiu cursed secretly. At this moment, his figure moved, holding the golden spear in his hand, and continued to attack the giant frost dragon.

Although the Frost Dragon’s attack power is extremely high and its speed is quite fast, compared to Lin Xiu’s speed, it is still a lot worse.

Lin Xiu’s figure kept moving and the golden spear kept attacking its body, making loud noises.

The frost on the body of the Frost Dragon kept falling off at this moment.

“Damn…”

At this time, Zhang Xiuxian slowly crawled out from the ground.

He wiped the blood from his mouth and looked at the sky in front of him. Lin Xiu was still fighting with the frost dragon.

The frost on the body of the Frost Dragon was blasted by Lin Xiu’s attack and dropped many ice cubes.

These ice cubes are equivalent to the body of the Frost Dragon.

“It’s really powerful…”

Looking at this scene, Zhang Xiuxian couldn’t help but secretly said.

But at this moment, he didn’t think much about it. He took a deep breath and mobilized all the energy in his body again.

Directly use the air defense technique, then rush to the sky above!

Whoosh—

His speed was also very fast and he rushed to the other intact wing of the frost dragon in an instant.

Holding the saber in his hand, he attacked his wings frantically.

Bang bang bang——

The sword slashed on the wing of the giant frost dragon and there were huge and incomparably loud sounds.

The frost on the wings also kept falling off.

The attacks of the two made the giant frost dragon even more insane.

Kala Kala——

A large number of cracks suddenly appeared on the surrounding frosty ground.

boom–

In the next moment, all these frosts burst.

Those shattered ice cubes all turned into sharp ice picks and directly stabbed toward Lin Xiu and Zhang Xiuxian who were attacking it above!

Whoosh whoosh——

At this moment, there seemed to be crackling sounds in the air.

“Careful!”

At this time, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank slightly.

The speed of these piercing ice picks was too fast. Lin Xiu didn’t dodge for a while and was pierced to the body by those ice picks.

Bang bang bang——

With dull sounds, the sharp point in front of the ice pick pierced through Lin Xiu’s skin.

But there is no way to continue to penetrate.

And although Zhang Xiuxian’s reaction speed was fast, he was still hit by one of the ice picks, which directly pierced through his shoulder.

The splashed blood was frozen in that instant.

“ah…”

The severe pain made Zhang Xiuxian grit his teeth tightly.

The remaining source strength of the body, at this moment, directly unfolded into a ‘Sphere’.

...

But now, under the suppression of the power of rules, the ‘Sphere’ that he had expanded was really too weak.

Under the impact of so many ice picks, his body was also crumbling.

“Hng!”

Lin Xiu saw a large number of ice picks coming towards him again, the strength of his body burst out and those ice picks were all shaken away in an instant.

The little cut on his skin has completely healed at this time.

At this moment, the source strength of the whole body directly penetrated the golden spear.

At this time, with the infusion of source strength, the golden spear suddenly burst into dazzling golden light.

As soon as the figure moved, it appeared on the body of the frost dragon.

Lin Xiu completely ignored those piercing ice picks.

Because it was impossible for those picks to penetrate his body, it just felt a little painful.

“This physical power is too terrifying…”

...

Out of the corner of Zhang Xiuxian’s eyes, he saw Lin Xiu not even unfolding the ‘Sphere’ and was still being hit by those ice picks, his eyes were full of shock.

At the same time, Lin Xiu stood on the body of the giant frost dragon. Lin Xiu held a long spear in both hands and stabbed his body frantically!

Boom, boom, boom——

A huge and incomparably loud sound continued to ring out at this moment.

A large number of ice cubes were blown off the body of the frost giant dragon.

Originally controlling the ice cubes on the ground to form ice picks to attack the giant frost dragon, at this time, because of Lin Xiu’s attack, those ice picks stopped moving immediately.

The densely packed all fell down in an instant.

boom–

With a loud sound, the other wing of the frost dragon was instantly broken off.

Its huge body fell directly at this moment.

Boom——

The whole ground shook.

Roar–

The frost dragon let out a huge roar, turned around, and was about to slap Lin Xiu with its giant frost claws.

But Lin Xiu’s reaction speed is really too fast.

Before his claws touched Lin Xiu’s body, Lin Xiu had already dodged to the other side.

At this moment, Zhang Xiuxian also rushed over from the other side and attacked the frost dragon!

Boom, boom, boom——

Following the crazy attacks of the two, loud noises came out one after another.

“die!”

And Lin Xiu, in the next moment, held the golden spear full of source strength and directly stabbed the forehead of the frost dragon!

The whole person pierced through its head, then rushed out from its back!

Kala Kala——

A large number of cracks appeared in the huge body of the frost dragon in an instant.

It seems that it will explode soon!
