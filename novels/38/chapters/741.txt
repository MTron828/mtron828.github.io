Chapter 742: Spacial Source Mark

Lin Xiu’s eyes were still closed and he looked as if he was in a peculiar condition.

The black light on his forehead soon disappeared and there was a source mark that was slowly forming on his forehead instead.

His source mark was completely different from the others. The usual ones would glow brightly in white but Lin Xiu’s ones was black in colour which looked odd.

“Hey!”

Then, a man walked over towards Lin Xiu and pushed Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

“What are you doing?!”

Qian Jing noticed the man and quickly rushed forward, pushing him away from Lin Xiu.

If a warrior was disrupted while he was comprehending the source mark, he would lose everything!

Not only that, there was a possibility that the warrior would counterattack instead causing even more damage.

“I just thought that something was wrong with him and decided to tell him about it.”

The man shrugged his shoulders and spoke in an innocent manner.

“You...”

Qian Jing was about to scream at the man when he felt a light tap on his shoulder.

When he turned around, he saw Lin Xiu who was already awakened.

The source mark that was seen on Lin Xiu’s forehead soon disappeared as well.

From the way Lin Xiu looked, it seemed like he didn’t receive any damage.

“I’m fine.”

Lin Xiu spoke flatly towards Qian Jing.

Then, he turned his attention to the man in front of them.

“You’re the one who pushed me?”

Lin Xiu asked the man who was standing in front of them.

“I thought that you looked off and thought that there was something wrong with you.” The man was still trying to look innocent and helpless as he shrugged his shoulders.

“Bro.....don’t take my friend’s kindness the wrong way.”

There were two more muscular men, who laughed and spoke, while standing next to the man and it was obvious that they were a group.

They were glaring at Lin Xiu and from their eyes, it was obvious that they were threatening Lin Xiu.

The three of them were top rank 9 warriors which meant that they were close to being a master warrior.

They have been here multiple times in order to comprehend the source mark, preparing themselves to obtain a sourcemark as soon as they become a master warrior.

Despite the multiple trips, they still couldn’t comprehend a single source mark but this young man, who had just arrived, had already obtained one!

Rank 9 warriors were allowed to comprehend source marks but they couldn’t obtain it immediately.

The only advantage that they would obtain from comprehending source marks while being a rank 9 warrior was so that they could immediately obtain a source mark once they became a master warrior and then gained the source energy.

Therefore, when they noticed that Lin Xiu was able to obtain a source mark, the man had intentionally disrupted Lin Xiu.

“It was the right hand?”

Lin Xiu asked calmly.

“What? Are you trying to cause trouble?!”

One of them gave a cold laugh.

Lin Xiu did not answer him and instead, he walked towards the man.

It was fortunate that he had completed the comprehension before being pushed onto the shoulder. If it was a minute earlier, the consequences of it would be unimaginable.

“Go to hell!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was slowly walking towards him, the man was feeling an immense pressure. Before Lin Xiu reached him, he had already swung his fist and threw it towards Lin Xiu’s face!

Boom – –

As he swung his fist towards Lin Xiu’s face, Lin Xiu moved his right hand as well and caught the fist before it reached him.

“You...”

The expression on the man’s face changed. He felt as if his fist was being clamped by a strong metal plier.

Crackling – –

As the sounds of bone cracking could be heard, the man could feel his bones breaking as if they were about to turn into ash.

“AHHHHHH!!!”

With the intense pain, he couldn’t help but scream out loud.

“Let go of him!”

The other two men were surprised as well and immediately pulled out their machetes and were about to chop Lin Xiu’s arms!

“Leave!”

Lin Xiu roared and with a strong pull, he tore off the man’s arm from the body!

At the same time, Lin Xiu moved his body to the left and could still dodge the attack from the other two men.

Before they could react, Lin Xiu had already sent two strong kicks towards their body!

Boom boom – –

With the strong kicks, both the men flew into the distance.

They were two bulky, muscular men that looked strong and sturdy. As soon as they hit the wall, there was a loud thud.

Lin Xiu was about to take another step forward when some of the staff walked towards them.

“What’s the matter?!!”

By looking at the ground that was now covered with blood with a dismantled arm on the ground, the manager in charge screamed at the crowd.

“He started it first.”

Qian Jing said in a cold tone.

As for the man with a missing arm, he was panting and looked incredibly pale.

He was looking at Lin Xiu and his eyes were filled with fear.

He never thought that Lin Xiu would be such a powerful man.

Lin Xiu was terrifying and he had no ways of defending himself towards Lin Xiu.

The staff also got the footage from the security cameras as well.

When they saw what the man did to Lin Xiu, he frowned with disapproval.

Then, when he saw Lin Xiu pulling out the man’s arm, he was shocked as well and he looked terrified of what he just witnessed.

“According to the rules here, you have to leave now!”

The staff who was in charge said towards the trio.

Lin Xiu did not care about it and shrugged his shoulders, about to leave the place.

“Qian Jing, you take your time. I’ll be leaving now.”

“Alright.”

Qian Jing thought about it before nodding his head.

There were lots of benefits that a warrior could get in this area and seeing how Lin Xiu had already gotten his source mark, it motivated Qian Jing as well.

As for the three men, they were asked to leave by the staff.

Lin Xiu walked out of the canyon and took a deep breath of the fresh air.

Nice!

He didn’t expect himself to obtain a source mark before he got here.

Plus, the source mark that he had obtained was not any ordinary source mark. It was the most special one amongst the others – a spacial source mark.

As he thought about it, Lin Xiu felt excited and wanted to test it out immediately.

In the Ice and Snow City, there was still snow falling out of the sky.

The snowflakes in this city always seemed to be floating in the air.

There were also lots of robots who were still cleaning the thick layer of snow. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

There were also multiple huge screens around that were promoting the annual warrior conference.

From the videos, Lin Xiu caught a glimpse of Fengyun City.

Plus, he noticed that most of the judges for the conference were warrior kings.

The legendary king of Marqi planet, who was a respected warrior, will be handing out the rewards after the conference.

“How would....the power of a respected warrior be?”

Lin Xiu was looking forward to the competition.

But, the thing that was even more exciting was that.... Luo Yue should be at Fengyun City as well, right?
