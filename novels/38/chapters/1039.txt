Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Why should I tell you?”

Lin Xiu frowned as he answered calmly.

Then, the Angel flew back to Lin Xiu from the other corner.

Boom – –

As the Angel returned to Lin Xiu, her body then landed on the ground.

That caused the entire ground to shake vigorously.

“You brat! You have guts.”

Bai Zhanfei had a hideous look on his face after hearing what Lin Xiu said to him.

“I want your robot. Give me control over it.”

Bai Zhanfei looked at the robot that just landed on the ground. Then, he pointed at her and commanded Lin Xiu to give it to him.

“Until now, you still don’t have any idea about what is going on?”

After hearing what Bai Zhanfei said, Lin Xiu asked in a curious tone.

These people from the Bai family were still talking in this manner?

“The one who has no idea about what’s going on….is you.”

The man chuckled.

Then, Lin Xiu noticed that the warriors that were once standing next to Bai Zhanfei were now standing all around Lin Xiu.

There were five warriors in five different directions. They were blocking Lin Xiu from every direction.

When he saw what happened, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but narrow his eyes.

The five of them have done a good job hiding themselves. Without using the Analytic Eyes, Lin Xiu had thought that these warriors were just normal warriors.

After using the Analytic Eye, Lin Xiu finally noticed that the five of them were incredibly powerful sage warriors!

Wow. This must have been costly.

How did the Bai family have so many sage warriors protecting them?

“Perhaps….there are sage warriors everywhere?”

Lin Xiu gave a remark after seeing the warriors around him.

“That’s right. We have lots of sage warriors working for the Bai family!”

Bai Zhanfei stared at Lin Xiu and gave a cold smile.

“I am giving you another chance now. Give me control over the robot.”

“I may be able to just take you as a stupid dog and let you go.”

Bai Zhanfer continued commanding Lin Xiu.

It felt as if the three sage warriors and the number of respected warriors that were killed did not threaten Bai Zhanfei at all.

“It looks like you still do not understand.”

“My strength.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and then energy burst out of his body.

‘Heavenly Array’!!

With Lin Xiu in the centre of it, there was a bright light coming from his body.

A domain?!

When they saw what Lin Xiu was doing, this was the first thing that they thought of.

‘Rage’!

With the ‘Heavenly Array’ being used, Lin Xiu continued with using ‘Rage’!

The five of them here were different from both the sage warriors that he had just fought. Lin Xiu could clearly feel that they were much stronger.

Although with Lin Xiu’s current abilities, he had the confidence of killing one sage warrior. However, there were 5 of them here and there was a peculiar connection between them which made it difficult for him.

He had no chances for error.

Lin Xiu continued expanding his array.

Then, due to the force that Lin Xiu was releasing from his body, the entire ground started shaking.

The rocks that were beneath Lin Xiu’s feet started breaking apart as well.

“Ah Jin, be careful. This young man is pretty strong.”

One of the warriors warned the rest of them with his eyes locked on Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu also took the time to look at the warriors around him.

As he took a closer look, he noticed that these warriors were all holding onto sticks as their weapons.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but think that this was weird.

Most warriors would have picked swords and machetes as their weapons. He hasn’t seen anyone who picked sticks.

But now, there were 5 of them who were using it.

“If it’s possible, don’t kill him. I want him tortured.”

Bai Zhanfei, who was far behind them, gave the instruction to his man in a cold tone.

From his knowledge, he was sure that Lin Xiu would be dead soon.

Lin Xiu had the long spear in his hand. He looked around him at the five warriors and then suddenly, his body disappeared into thin air.

All of the warriors were completely stunned.

He’s gone?!

They would have never thought that Lin Xiu, the man whom they have surrounded, would be able to go missing within a blink of an eye!

“Ah Shui, be careful!”

The man, who spoke earlier, noticed that something wasn’t right and quickly warned the man who stood opposite him.

Just when he was done, Lin Xiu’s body appeared behind of the man known as Ah Shui.

With the long spear in his hands, the weapon was aimed at the man’s head!

Boom – –

If it was done properly with no interruption, Lin Xiu could have killed this warrior without much effort.

But, since this man was warned by his comrade, he had released his ‘sphere’ at the very last minute!

Lin Xiu’s attack then landed on his ‘sphere’ instead!

Boom – –

With the loud explosion, the man’s body was thrown into the distance because of the impact.

However, his ‘sphere’ was released and he was only blasted away from the impact.

The warrior inside it was not injured at all.

“Damn it, kid.”

After steadying himself, he wiped off the blood that was coming out from the corner of his mouth.

Lin Xiu’s attacks were much stronger than he had expected.

As he was blasted away, he was slightly injured as well.

“Gold, Wood, Water, Fire, Earth…..does this represent the elements that you have?”

Lin Xiu thought that it was a waste since he had failed the ambush earlier but now, after hearing how they were calling each other, Lin Xiu had an idea in his mind.

From their nicknames, they were all named after the elements.

“Hmph! It’s useless even if you knew this.”

The man who just spoke was named ‘Huo’ which represented the fire element. He held onto his stick and started attacking Lin Xiu.

All of the energy in his body was then transferred onto the stick.

The black, boring stick from before was now shining brightly.

The entire stick seemed to be covered with a huge flame.

The flame was not an ordinary one since it looked extremely bright.

“Fire?”

Lin Xiu did not dodge the attack.

Instead, the fire crystal ball around his neck lit up.

The tiny flame that was inside the crystal ball was trying to get out.

Boom – –

Then, there were flames that appeared on Lin Xiu’s spear as well.

Compared to the flames seen on the man’s stick, Lin Xiu’s one was different as his was dark blue in colour.

It looked odd.

Clang – –

Lin Xiu immediately attacked the man who was coming at him with the long spear that was now covered with hellfire. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Boom!

As the weapons collided with each other, there were also sparks that came from the flames.

There was a loud sound that came from it which sounded like an explosion!
