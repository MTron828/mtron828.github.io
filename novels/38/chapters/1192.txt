1193 The Tournament

Sun Ruo spoke in a serious tone.

He had a strong perception. He could clearly feel that Rollie was not an ordinary evolved beast.

However, he couldn’t clearly say what was different about it.

It was weird.

“I feel that Rollie is a little different as well.”

Baili Haoling added in.

“How different?”

Lin Xiu was starting to get curious.

Then, he gently caressed Rollie who was sitting on his shoulder.

Rollie’s body was covered with thick, white fur.

He was like a white ball and the fur that he had on were like those on a lamb.

It was something comfortable to touch.

It has a pair of pitch black eyes. Rollie has its eyes closed now because of how Lin Xiu was gently touching it. It looked incredibly comfortable.

“The things that it consumes are much more than Little Bai.”

Baili Haoling answered helplessly.

From the moment she took care of these two pets, she has been feeding them odd crystals.

The amount of crystals that Rollie could eat would be much more than Little Bai and it never seems full from it.

“You have such a huge appetite?”

Lin Xiu slowly patted Rollie. As he spoke to it, an odd crystal appeared in Lin Xiu’s palm.

When they saw that it was a bright red off crystals, Sun Ruo and Ling Yu’s pupil shrank subconsciously.

It was a beast god odd crystal!

It was incredibly difficult for them as warrior gods to get such odd crystals.

Baili Haoling was shocked as well.

However, she wasn’t shocked to see such an odd crystal. She was shocked to see how it suddenly appeared in Lin Xiu’s hands.

“Oh, I may have another one.”

Lin Xiu thought about it and with the control of his mind, another bright blue odd crystal appeared on his other palm.

This was also a beast god odd crystal.

This was incredibly rare.

The odd crystal was one of those that Lin Xiu won from the underground battle.

This was also why Mr Lui had to stop Lin Xiu from leaving.

“Little Bai, this is yours.”

Lin Xiu looked at the blue odd crystal in his arm and threw it at Little Bai who was flying above them.

As soon as the odd crystal left Lin Xiu’s hands, Little Bai quickly caught it with his mouth.

“Rollie, this is yours.”

As for the red odd crystal, Lin Xiu gave it to Rollie.

‘Xiu!” Rollie instantly swallowed the entire odd crystal.

Although it was a fire element beast god odd crystal, this was useless for Lin Xiu.

If he wanted to increase the power of his flames, he would have to find and absorb flames that are even scarier than what he has now.

However, he still wasn’t familiar with the warrior god realm. Along with how he was being tied down to one of the cities, he couldn’t leave as he pleased.

This meeting was the only exception that he has.

He would have to immediately return once everything was over here.

Lin Xiu felt a headache coming every time he thought about this.

Grumbling – –

Suddenly, there was a peculiar noise that came from Rollie.

Its eyes were shut close and its body was shivering as well.

The ice crystal white blood that was flying above his head earlier, rested on Lin Xiu’s other shoulder as well.

Its eyes were closed and it looked as if it had fallen asleep.

“This…”

Lin Xiu was a little shocked to see what happened.

“The energy that they’ve absorbed is too strong. They couldn’t digest it now which is why they are hibernating now.”

Sun Ruo’s jaw had hit the ground due to shock. When he recovered from it, he explained the situation to Lin Xiu with a bitter smile on his face.

Those were odd crystals of a beast god! How could he just feed them to these two evolved beasts?

Sun Ruo and Ling Yu felt a heartache coming from their chests.

“Oh….is this why?”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

Both the men turned speechless.

These were beast god odd crystals!

It wasn’t just a random odd crystal!

“I wanted to feed them a few more.”

Lin Xiu pursed his lips.

What the f**k?

Sun Ruo and Ling Yu felt that there were a hundred question marks that appeared on top of their heads.

Why don’t you give them to us?! It’s just a waste for it to be fed to evolved beasts!!!

“You’re a generous man.”

Baili Haoling pursed her lips as well.

Soon, as the crowd finished their meals, Fu Tianyuan went back on stage.

“I hope that everyone is satisfied with the food?”

Fu Tianyuan smiled.

Then, he continued, “Following this, as per usual, we will be having the tournament next.”

“This time, with huge sincerity, the reward for the tournament…..”

He looked around at the crowd before announcing, “Will be a warrior god skills card.”

With that said, all of the warriors gasped.

Their eyes were also burning with passion.

A warrior god skills card was something incredibly rare even in the warrior god realm!

Fu Tian smirked when he saw how the rest of them reacted.

“Bring it here.”

As he waved his hands, he signalled one of his men to walk on stage with a square box.

The rest of the crowd had their eyes fixed on the wooden box.

The warrior god skills card was incredibly tempting.

“City lord Fu is definitely being generous this time…”

Sun Ruo was shocked as well to see what the reward was.

“He’s just trying to attract more people.”

Ling Yu sneered.

He was looking a little unhappy with what was happening on stage.

“Attract?”

Lin Xiu raised his brows and he was getting curious.

“Every year, Fu Tianyuan would do the same thing. The warrior that becomes the winner would be offered a position in Manhuang City and become one of his men.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head as he slowly understood what was happening.

“If that’s the case, why would you bring the young warriors here?”

Baili Haoling raised a question.

“This is a tradition that has happened for a long time. Due to how the reward offered by the city lord is tempting, most of the younger warriors would want to give it a try. As their city lords, we can’t stop them from participating.”

Sun Ruo shrugged his shoulders helplessly.

“At the same time, the city lord of the warrior who got first, would also receive a similar reward.”

Sun Ruo peered at Ling Yu and said, “He received a sage warrior skill card last year.”

“What’s the use of one sage warrior skills card?”

Ling Yu seemed unhappy with Fu Tianyu and he only replied with a cold sneer.

Lin Xiu quickly understood the story. Ling Yu must have brought his warriors here and got first but they ended up being roped into Manhuang City. It was only natural for Ling Yu to be unhappy about it.

After all, it wasn’t something easy for them to raise a powerful warrior.

However, this was the rule and he had to obey it.

Otherwise, there would be no young warriors who would be willing to stay in his city. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m
