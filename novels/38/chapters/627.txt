Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

When the audience saw what was happening, all of them held their breath.

This was the first time that they had seen such a terrifying skill that enveloped such a huge area.

“Qixing!”

One of the men from the Sky Academy saw what was happening and he was shocked. He quickly rushed forward trying to help.

“Hey! I’m your opponent, not him.”

At that time, a figure stood in front of him and blocked his path.

“Go to hell!”

When the man saw that it was Baili Haoling, he sneered. He swung his sword and aimed it towards Baili Haoling!

Baili Haoling smiled as well and just when the sword was about to touch her neck, she finally moved.

She pulled out the boardsword from her waist.

The swords weren’t very broad but they were long

Just as she pulled out her swords, she was moving at such a quick speed that her movement could no longer be followed by the naked eyes.

Clang Clang clang – –

As the weapons collided with each other, the man who had aimed his sword at Baili Haoling ended up losing his weapon as his sword had now been chopped into small pieces!

How was this even possible?!

When the man saw what happened, his eyes widened in shock.

He initially wanted to continue attacking her but he had no other choice but to jump backwards.

He took a good look at his weapon and noticed that he only had the handle left!

“You wanted to kill me. Am I right?”

Baili Haoling looked at the man ahead of her. She might be smiling but her smile was sending chills down the man’s spine.

“Who are you?!!!”

The man shouted. Perhaps he had seen it wrongly but he saw that there was a bright red glow that appeared in her eyes. Even her broadswords were covered with a dull red hue.

In conclusion, she looked terrifying.

“This girl, something’s not right....”

One of the officials from the Warriors Federation noticed Baili Haoling and the expression on his face changed.

Baili Tao frowned as well. If Baili Haoling stayed in this condition, the brat from Sky City would definitely die!

The vice chancellor of the Sky Academy had a dull look on his face as well. Baili Haoling had just chopped the man’s sword into pieces just now.

Her boardsword! How could it be so powerful?!

The man wanted to move backwards but he soon realised that he was already at the edge of the stage.

One more step and he would already be out of the match.

Damn it!

He had a determined look in his eyes. As he turned around, he headed towards another direction!

On both sides of the stage, there were additional weapons left on the shelf. They were allowed to be used by the contestant but the quality of these weapons definitely wouldn’t be as good as their own.

He quickly picked up a sword and looked at Baili Haoling cautiously as she remained on the same spot.

“Are you ready?’

Baili Haoling asked with a straight face.

With a strong breeze, both her ponytails moved uncontrollably.

“Hmph! What were you thinking? It’s just because you have really good weapons...”

The man showed a twisted expression on his face. As he gathered his energy, he released his ‘Yuan’ as well.

Baili Haoling grabbed onto her boardswords and placed them like a cross.

With the swords rubbing onto each other, it let out a loud horrifying sound.

“Go to hell!”

The man who just got his weapon, leaped upwards and swung his sword like a mad man.

The sword was filled with energy and the sword aura was headed towards Baili Haoling!

As the crescent shaped sword aura headed towards her, there was a wind breaking sound that ran through the room.

If the aura hit any warriors, it would be able to chop the person’s body into two!

However, Baili Haoling did not move. Instead, she headed for the sword aura that was coming towards her!

“You’re dead!”

When he saw what was happening, the man screamed.

Then, he saw how Baili Haoling chopped the sword aura into pieces. She was moving her boardsword like a lunatic and she managed to destroy all the sword aura!

The sword aura.....can be destroyed?

How was this possible?!

As the scene happened, there was a different look in his eyes.

Baili Haoling was getting closer to him. As she leaped in the air, her baordsword was held in a cross as she aimed it towards the man!

There was a bright red energy that was flowing around the swords, looking like fresh blood.

‘Blood Cross Slash’!

“Move!”

The man roared as he swung his sword upwards and his yuan was glowing brightly.

Boom – –

With the huge impact, Baili Haoling suddenly appeared behind the man and landed safely on the ground.

Then, she kept her broadsword into their covers that were around her waist and stood up, without looking back.

“You...”

The man widened his eyes in surprise. Just as he was about to say something, his ‘yuan’ broke.

Boom – –

With a soft groan, his body was separated into several pieces and there was blood all over the stage!

“Shuhai!”

The vice Chancellor of the Sky Academy stood up in shock.

The boy was the leader of the second team from the Sky Academy. He was extremely talented but was now chopped into pieces on stage.

He was about to turn crazy.

“Lao Jiang, calm down.”

Baolli Tao said to him in a calm tone.

“Your students aren’t taking human lives seriously! The Warrior Competition wouldn’t allow such...”

“Shut up!”

When Baili Tao heard what the vice chancellor said, he shouted.

“Your students have killed students from another academy and even killed ten warriors. Should we disqualify them?”

After hearing what Baili Tao said, the vice chancellor of the Sky Academy finally calmed down. As he looked at Baili Tao, there was hatred in his eyes.

“Captain!”

The two other men from the Sky Academy who were fighting Qian Yao and Huang Zhen were both shocked when they saw their captain getting killed.

“Destroy it!”

While they were distracted, Huang Zhen and Qian Yao took the opportunity to kick them off the stage!

Boom boom boom –

With a loud sound, the both of them were immediately kicked off the stage!

“Don’t come for me!”

Ouyang Hang screamed at them. He was still fighting another man when he noticed Huang Zhen and Qian Yao running over to help him.

Koong Loong – –

On the other side of the stage, there were still flaming birds that were headed towards Zhuo Qixing.

The flaming birds were like meteorites causing a huge impact as it hit the ground like an explosion!Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates
