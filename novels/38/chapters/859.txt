Chapter 860: Space Teleportation Device (1)

But as he roared loudly, there was still no one here to respond to him.

The entire Nan family seems to have become quiet.

What happened!?

Nan Xiang’s body also became a little cold at this time.

“How did the people from Planet Namir get here?”

Lin Xiu said lightly at this time.

“I have no idea!”

In addition to being frightened, Nan Xiang roared loudly.

Boom—

Just as he finished speaking, Lin Xiu swung the spear in his hand and suddenly a powerful force burst out.

All the warriors suddenly exploded and flew in all directions.

Nan Xiang, who was standing there, stared at this scene in a daze, as if he was frightened.

“Not telling me? Then your Nan family doesn’t need to exist anymore.”

Lin Xiu said lightly, the spear in his hand seemed to be about to swing!

Nan Xiang’s pupils shrank at this time.

“I’ll speak!!!”

He gritted his teeth and finally said aloud.

The strength that Lin Xiu is showing now is really terrifying.

And if he guessed correctly, including Nan Jing, the rest of the people have all died.

“They came through the space teleportation array.”

Nan Xiang took a deep breath, calmed down the trembling body in fear, then spoke up.

Space Teleportation Array!?

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu’s brows could not help wrinkling.

“Take me there.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Fine…”

Nan Xiang had no choice but to take Lin Xiu to the other side.

This is in a mountain range in Sky City.

There is a cave inside. The entrance to the cave is small, but the space inside is extremely huge.

If you look closely, you can find some huge and weird mechanical devices inside.

“They came from here.”

Nan Xiang walked in with Lin Xiu and said aloud.

“Space teleportation device...”

It can be teleported directly from the planet Namir.

How is this done?!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu’s brows could not help but wrinkle tightly.

“Why are they helping you?”

Lin Xiu continued to speak. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Nan Jing must be able to possess such powerful power now because of the power provided by these people.

“These people originally wanted our Nan family to help rule the earth...”

Nan Xiang hesitated for a while, but he had no choice but to tell the truth.

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed slightly.

Rule the earth? How can it be so easy.

And this group of people doesn’t seem to be from the Bai family.

“Are there still any people from Planet Namir now?”

Lin Xiu continued speaking.

“They’ve all gone...”

Hearing Nan Xiang’s words, Lin Xiu knew that those warriors just now were all warriors of the planet Namir.

“There are others that haven’t come yet.”

“If this device is destroyed, then they won’t be able to come here?”

Lin Xiu looked at the huge space teleportation device and said aloud.

“This is a device for teleportation back to Planet Namir. Even if it is destroyed, there will still be people who can teleport over to Planet Namir.”

Nan Xiang said aloud at this time.

Lin Xiu frowned slightly.

It seems that this matter cannot be completely resolved.

“Do you know how to use this thing?”

Lin Xiu continued to look at the teleportation device, but still couldn’t find how to activate it.

If he could teleport directly to the planet Namir, then he didn’t need to find the location of the planet Namir.

He could go over directly through this thing!
