Chapter 173: Move Out!

“Lin Xiu, you will delegate who will go to G17 ruin and who will head towards Emerald Forest.” Nan Zhengjun looked at Lin Xiu and said.

Lin Xiu nodded and looked at the students that were in neat rows.

Many had anxious expressions on their faces. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

After hearing Li Ping’s words, they felt that the G17 ruin was a place with real danger.

“Those who want to go can come out.” Lin Xiu glanced at them and spoke up indifferently.

Opportunity and danger coincide together, although there were zombies and terrifying evolved beasts, they were just experience points to him.

Everyone hesitated while looking at each other.

“I’ll go.” Zhang Yin gritted his teeth and spoke up.

Lei Lei’s expression changed and pulled onto his hand.

After all, it was truly dangerous and she did not feel at ease as his girlfriend.

“It’ll be fine.” Zhang Yin patted her hand and reassured her.

“No, I’m going with you.” Lei Lei shook her head and said.

“You can’t, it’s more dangerous there and it’ll be hard to take care of you as well.” Zhang Yin advised.

It was a fact, Lei Lei’s strength was on the weaker side. If she went, it would be even more difficult.

Lei Lei kept quiet after hearing his words.

Zhang Yin was worried for her and although they were slightly emotional before, she managed to calm down.

“I’ll go.” Jiang Li gritted his teeth and stood out as well after seeing Zhang Yin volunteer.

“One more.” Luo Yue spoke up indifferently.

Needless to say, she would participate in the ruin. Emerald Forest posed no threat to her.

Lin Xiu looked at them and could not help but frown.

It required five people to form a team to go, but the level of danger was too high and many did not dare.

If they did not meet five volunteers, it would be regarded as a direct forfeit and they would fall to the bottom of the freshmen assembly!

“I’ll go!” Li Ping clenched his teeth and said.

Everyone turned to look at him in surprise. After all, he was one of those that were afraid.

His expression was extremely ugly and his eyes were still filled with fear.

“Really?” Lin Xiu frowned and asked.

He sensed that there was something amiss in Li Ping’s eyes as though he had experienced something scary before.

“Yes!”

“Good, then it’s decided. The five of us will head to G17 ruin, the rest of you will go to Emerald Forest.” Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Alright!”

After deciding on the count, everyone headed in their respective directions under Nan Zhengjun’s guidance.

“This bag has space to store odd crystals and contains some nourishment. The time limit is one week, the teams that enter G17 ruin and obtain the most rank 5 and above odd crystals will be hailed as the winner.” Nan Zhengjun explained.

He took out a few special bags and handed them to everyone while explaining.

As for Emerald Forest, it was said that there was a trophy cup deep inside, whichever class rushes to obtain it will be the winner.

In other words, G17 required more battles and would be more difficult.

Once everything was set in place, everyone headed towards the school gates.

Everyone saw two airships parked at the shore and knew they were separated to head towards G17 ruin and Emerald Forest.

Before boarding, everyone was scanned for carrying odd crystals to prevent cheating.

If someone carried many rank 5 odd crystals over, the competition would be meaningless.

‘Oh no.’

‘Rollie is on me, will it be scanned out as an odd crystal?’

“Lin Xiu, what’re you dazing out for?” Nan Zhengjun saw Lin Xiu standing in place and slightly out of sorts and called out to him.

“Oh, it’s nothing.” Lin Xiu shook his head and walked over.

The result surprised Lin Xiu, as the scan did not detect Rollie. This made Lin Xiu suspicious.

Everyone boarded the airships and soon enough, the airships started to rise.

The windows were pitch black as usual, most probably to prevent people from knowing where Sacred Region Academy’s actual location was at.

“Li Ping, what’s wrong?” Lin Xiu noticed Li Ping standing in place and his expression was one of fear.

‘No way, he knows that it is dangerous there, did he become like that because he is afraid?’

“Zeze, if you’re afraid, don’t go! Be careful that you might lose your own life!” The other students started to mock him when they saw him frozen.

“Hahaha, as expected of class 10, weak chicken.”

Lin Xiu could clearly sense that something was off, as though there was some sort of shadow in his heart.

“I’ve been there before.” Li Ping sighed and spoke up after staying in a daze for a long while.

While saying that, Lin Xiu saw the pain in his eyes.

“You’ve been there before?” Jiang Li was startled and blurted out subconsciously.

Seeing everyone’s skepticism, he plunged into his memories: “You guys know how short-tempered I am, I don’t get convinced well. There was once my classmate who told me it was very horrifying there and said no one dared to go. I don’t believe in evil, so I accompanied him.”

At this point, Li Ping’s hands started to tremble.

“On the first day that we were there, my friends were all hurt by some evolved beasts and got infected, mutants…” At this point, Li Ping’s eyes grew larger as his body trembled.

He did not want to recall that horrifying scene.

“I came back alone.” He took a deep breath and calmed himself down before revealing a bitter smile.

“The evolved beasts there carry some sort of virus?” Zhang Yin asked.

Although evolved beasts at other places were equally as terrifying, warriors would at most get injured after being attacked. But the evolved beasts in the ruin could infect people?

“That’s right.” Li Ping nodded his head.

“Although the virus carried on these evolved beasts are not as much as the zombies, whoever gets hurt and infected will turn into one in 24 hours.”

“How can you understand watching your own friend turn into a zombie?!”

That helplessness made him realize how unbearable it was.
