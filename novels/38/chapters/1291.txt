1292 The Contest Is About to Begin

Lin Xiu, who just opened his eyes, looked at the God warriors who had left and couldn’t help but whispered to himself.

Looking at Baili Haoling and Lei Tong next to him, they also opened their eyes.

“Lin Xiu, let’s go.”

Baili Haoling stood up directly, seeming a little excited.

!!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu also smiled helplessly.

The blood on Baili Haoling’s clothes had dried up and her wound seemed to have almost healed.

The blood on the clothes looked a little horrifying, but he looked very energetic.

Lei Tong was also a little excited at this time.

Multi-City Contest.

There will inevitably be many powerful warriors from other cities.

Watching these fighters fight will also benefit him a lot.

“You’re not fighting, why are you so excited?”

Lin Xiu stood up slowly and said to the two of them.

“Why don’t you let me go on your behalf?”

After Baili Haoling thought about it, her eyes lit up and she said.

“No, this is recorded. Do you think you could replace me so easily.”

Lin Xiu didn’t know whether to laugh or cry.

“Humph!”

Baili Haoling pouted, thinking about the fact that she would not be able to play, she immediately became unhappy.

“Let’s go.”

At this time, Lin Xiu had already lifted the spear in his hand and walked towards the gate of the practice room.

At this time, there was already a lot of staff at the entrance of the City of god Hotel.

Guiding those participating warriors.

Lin Xiu also walked down, seeing a large number of warriors around him, he couldn’t help being surprised at this moment.

Originally he thought that there would be a large number of participating God warriors coming to the training room on the top floor to practice last night, but unexpectedly, there were not many.

On the contrary, there were many local warriors.

Feeling the powerful aura emanating from the surrounding God warriors at this time, Lin Xiu couldn’t help being surprised.

“These warriors are quite strong indeed…”

Baili Haoling also said aloud at this time.

She also had to admit that the strength of these God warriors is incomparable to those of last night.

“Lin Xiu, you must get the ranking.”

Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu.

Although she knew that Lin Xiu’s strength was already very strong, there were too many powerful warriors here and it was very difficult to win first place.

As long as he can get the ranking, it’s worth the trip.

“En, I’ll try my best.”

Lin Xiu said solemnly at this time.

Among these God warriors, there were many existences comparable to Liu Mo and some were even stronger than Liu Mo.

His Analytic eyes can’t analyze it at all.

But now that he had mastered those dark forces and his strength has improved to a certain extent, he didn’t need to be too nervous.

“Give.”

At this moment, Lin Xiu walked over to a staff member, then handed out the previous black card.

The staff member held Lin Xiu’s black card, scanned it with the machine, nodded slightly and returned the black card to Lin Xiu.

And at this moment, a number appeared on the black card.

99.

99

Looking at the faintly visible number on the black card, Lin Xiu was slightly taken aback: “This is…”

“This is a number that just appeared randomly, which means you will be contestant No. 99.”

The staff member said with a smile.

“Number 99…”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

“Please come this way, you can only bring up to three warriors with you.”

The staff member continued to speak.

“En, it’s them.”

Lin Xiu pointed to Baili Haoling and Lei Tong and said.

...

Following the staff, Lin Xiu started to go to the competition venue.

The venue of this competition was not nearby, but they had to take a special super express sky train, towards the center.

The speed of this super-express sky train is very fast. After getting on the train, Lin Xiu looked outside through the glass, but couldn’t see clearly the scene outside.

In just five minutes, the train stopped again.

“Arrived.”

The staff member spoke to Lin Xiu.

“En, let’s go.”

Lin Xiu nodded, then said to Baili Haoling and Lei Tong who were sitting on the other side.

The two also quickly followed Lin Xiu out of the train.

As soon as he got out of the train, Lin Xiu raised his eyes and looked ahead and he could clearly see the huge building outside.

This building was not much different from the Beijing Olympic stadium, but it was indeed countless times larger.

...

And there were a lot of entrances below.

There were already many warriors at the entrance, rushing to the front.

“Go to the dedicated passage for competition selection, your friends need to go to the audience passage.”

The staff member said while leading the way.

“Lin Xiu, get rid of all those warriors!”

Baili Haoling also said aloud at this time.

The hearing of the God warrior was very sensitive. At this time, some of the God warrior who passed by heard Baili Haoling’s words and immediately sneered.

They looked at Lin Xiu. Lin Xiu’s aura was very weak and there was nothing to be afraid of.

These participating warriors gave Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling a look of disdain, then left directly.

“City lord, come on.” Lei Tong also said aloud at this time.

“Well, let’s try to get the first place.”

Lin Xiu also said seriously.

The staff who picked up and dropped off Lin Xiu heard Lin Xiu’s words and the expression on his face also became strange.

First?

How could it be so easy to be the first in the Multi-City Contest?

Looking at Lin Xu’s confident expression, he couldn’t help feeling amused.

Of course, there was no expression on his face.

Soon, Lin Xiu went to the dedicated passage for contestants.

When he walked to the passage dedicated to warriors, Lin Xiu could clearly see that there were a large number of warriors at the skill level around him and they were also queuing up for this passage.

Such a strong sense of oppression…

At this time, Lin Xiu clearly felt the power from the surrounding warriors.

None of the God warriors who came here to compete hid their strength.

It seems that in order to prove their strength, they all began to release their strength.

Generally, the weak God warriors may really be affected.

When he walked inside, Lin Xiu could clearly see the huge open space.

Inside, there were also a large number of battle platforms, each of which was very large and made of special metal.

It seems to be able to handle a God warrior level battle without being destroyed.

“More than 10,000 God warriors…”

At this time, Lei Tong, who was sitting in the auditorium, couldn’t help but gasped as he looked at the scene below.

It was unimaginable before that so many God warriors were fighting here. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

The auditorium was surrounded by a large number of seats and it was slowly filling up at this time.

A lot of warriors came to watch this competition.

“Who is this person?”

Lin Xiu was looking around. At the next moment, he seemed to see something and the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.
