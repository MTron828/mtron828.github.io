1345 Returning Home

“Sure!”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“I will let you know then how to participate in these matches when the time comes.”

It seems like Riyan God Lord was taking the extra step to make Lin Xiu feel secure.

!!

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

Then, he took another deep breath in order to control his emotions.

Lin Xiu stared in the distance as he thought to himself.

Luo Yue, I’m coming for you!!!!

The next morning.

Lei Chong finally broke through and became a warrior god and even Baili Haoling’s abilities have improved.

Lin Xiu felt that he was already at its peak and he wouldn’t be able to gain much by just cultivating and decided that there was no use for him to stay here any longer.

He decided to leave God City and return to Lingxian City.

“Greetings, God Lord!”

Pang Chong and the rest of them welcomed Lin Xiu back to Lingxian City.

“You seem to be very well informed.”

Lin Xiu was indeed surprised.

He was now given the title of the new God Lord.

This title was much fancier than the ones he had before.

For the past year, there were only a dozen warriors who could make it after the elimination round and half of them even ended up dead.

“Of course, God Lord. You were the champion of the Multi-city Contest!”

Pang Chong replied carefully.

He was surprised.

He had confidence in Lin Xiu which was why he fought hard to get him a place in the contest but he didn’t think that Lin Xiu could defeat everyone and become the champion!

As the person who guided Lin Xiu to where he is now, it was honourable!

“All thanks to you who fought to get me a place.”

Lin Xiu smiled.

“These are presents.”

Lin Xiu waved his arms and threw a bottle filled with red fluid towards Pang Chong.

Pang Chong was stunned but he still caught it with his reflexes.

“This is…..”

“The energy essence.”

Lin Xiu replied casually.

Pang Chong’s eyes suddenly opened wide. Before he could say a word, Lin Xiu had already walked into the city.

All of the citizens of Lingxian City were cheering for Lin Xiu.

This new city lord has brought them countless surprises.

“From today onwards, there will be an Energy Stone Conversion Device installed here. All of Lingxian’s City citizen will be able to use it for free!”

Lin Xiu walked into the city and made his first announcement.

His voice travelled across the entire city.

The citizens were quiet at first but suddenly, all of them started busting into loud cheers.

The Energy Stone Conversion Device was something rare and would only be found in God City.

But, due to how Lin Xiu had gotten first, they will be placing one in Lingxian City.

The device would help with extracting the energy from the energy stone and allow them to cultivate.

These energy stones had much more energy than odd crystals but because of its form, it was impossible for any of them to cultivate with the energy stones.

With the Energy Stone Conversion Device, they will be able to extract the energy from the stones itself!

They would then be able to cultivate even faster than before!

“I will be allowing one month of free usage on the Energy Stone Conversion Device for the entire city!”

Lin Xiu continued making his announcement.

At this point, it would be difficult for him to make any significant progress. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

He had a bunch of people to take care of now in Lingxian City and so he decided to do something nice for them.

“City Lord, you’re the best!”

“The best!”

The rest of the crowd started chanting as well.

“City Lord!”

...

As soon as they got back into the city lord mansion, Mr Pang looked incredibly grateful.

“These are presents for all of you.”

Lin Xiu smiled as he stretched out his right arm. There were countless bottles filled with the energy essence and each guard had a small bottle of it.

“This is…”

Mr. Pang and the rest of the guards were shocked.

They could clearly feel the overpowering energy that came from the blood-red fluid inside the bottle.

“These are energy essence. Have a go at it.”

Lin Xiu left behind a gentle smile.

All of the guards were shocked and froze on the spot.

The energy essence was considered a priceless treasure!

This was only found inside the Essence Pool found at the God King’s pavilion!

...

This small bottle would have cost a fortune!

“Lin Xiu, where is mine?!”

Baili Haoling couldn’t help but ask as soon as they returned to the mansion.

She was envious of what the guards had received.

“Why are you in such a rush? Let’s go to your room first.”

Lin Xiu answered casually.

Baili Haoling narrowed her eyes as she stared at Lin Xiu when he carried a huge bucket into her room.

Then, a large amount of energy essence was poured into the wooden bucket.

The entire bucket was soon filled with a blood-red fluid.

Lei Chong quickly rubbed his eyes as he thought that there was something wrong with them.

The energy essence that Lin Xiu had given the rest before this was nothing compared to these!

“With your abilities, you should be able to absorb all of the energy from the fluid here.”

Lin Xiu quickly explained himself to Baili Haoling.

While he was inside the blood pool, Lin Xiu opened up his expansion space and filled them with the water inside.

Otherwise, with Lin Xiu’s abilities alone and the ‘Engulf’ skill from his system, he still wouldn’t be able to carry so much fluid with him.

“HAHAHAHA! Lin Xiu! You have finally thought of your master!”

Baili Haoling couldn’t help but laugh when she saw the wooden bucket filled with energy essence.

Her face turned red almost immediately.

“All of you get out! I want to start with my cultivation!”

Soon, Baili Haoling started pushing them out of the room.

“Well, she’s treating us like strangers after getting what she wants.”

Lin Xiu shrugged his shoulders helplessly.

Then, he pulled out another bottle.

“This is for you.”

Lei Chong looked at the bottle that Lin Xiu was giving to him and he was delighted.

“You have just broken through and your body may not be able to support such a huge amount of energy.”

“I understand. Thank you, City Lord!”

Lei Chong was already beyond grateful to be able to get his hands on the bottle of fluid.

“Oh! By the time, we would have to depend on your for installing the Energy Stone Conversion Device.”

Lin Xiu gently patted Lei Chong’s shoulder.

“Don’t worry! Leave it up to me!”

Lei Chong patted his own chest and smiled.

At this moment, the entire Lingxian City was filled with happy cheers.

Time passed quickly and it has already been a week since they’ve returned.

For the past week, Lei Chong worked quickly and installed the huge Energy Stone Conversion Device.

Along with his modification, the energy that gets converted inside the device gets spread across the entire city!

With an endless amount of energy stones being supplied, the entire Lingxian City was filled with energy.

As for Lin Xiu, he has been sitting inside his room, busy gathering information about the Netherworld Flame.
