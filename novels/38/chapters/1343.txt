1344 Found Luo Yue!

“If grandfather could be here, he would also be able to…”

Baili Haoling couldn’t help but mutter to herself.

“Why didn’t you bring your ancestors along?”L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but smile.

Baili Haoling’s ancestors were powerful warriors as well.

Even when Lin Xiu was already a warrior god, every time he thought of Baili Haoling’s ancestors, he still felt that they were much more powerful.

“That would be impossible. They wouldn’t care about these. If it wasn’t because I was talented enough, they wouldn’t have brought me along.”

Baili Haoling looked proud of herself as she spoke about it.

“Look at how arrogant you are now.”

Lin Xiu pursed his lips.

“Lei Chong, if you continue cultivating, how long do you still need?”

Lin Xiu then looked at Lei Chong.

“About one day!”

Lei Chong quickly answered.

The energy in the air here was incredibly rich.

If he was allowed to continue, he would break through very soon.

“Alright then. We shall leave after one day.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head. Then, he turned around and looked at the top of the stairs where Riyan God Lord was at.

“God lord, would we be allowed to stay here for another day?”

Lin Xiu asked for his permission to stay.

“Of course.”

Riyan God Lord nodded his head.

“Thank you, City lord!”

Lei Chong felt nothing but excited.

He also felt grateful towards Lin Xiu.

This was because not only did Lin Xiu save his life, Lin Xiu was giving him the chance to become a warrior god!

“Continue then.”

Lin Xiu did not say much and patted Lei Chong’s shoulder.

Lei Chong did not waste his time. He quickly sat cross legged on the ground and activated the ‘Cultivation Technique’, trying to absorb the energy around him.

He has to break through in one day’s time.

“I’ll continue as well.”

Baili Haoling informed Lin Xiu.

This time, she could feel that Lin Xiu has grown to become more powerful than before.

His overall stats must have increased tremendously.

Baili Haoling felt pressured to step up as well.

If she doesn’t work hard on her cultivation, she may not be able to catch up with Lin Xiu.

“Both of you can stay here for now.”

Seeing how Lei Chong and Baili Haoling has decided to continue cultivating, Lin Xiu placed Rollie and Little Bai on the ground before making his way up the Stairs of Trial.

The stairs were the same as before. As soon as Lin Xiu placed his foot on it, he could feel a strong surge of energy pushing him away.

As Lin Xiu’s stats have been upgraded, the energy on the stairs should not be of much problem for him.

However, Lin Xiu could feel that the energy coming from it was much stronger than before.

What on earth is happening here?!

After feeling the difference, Lin Xiu was shocked.

“The Stairs of Trials will change according to the strength of the warrior.”

Riyan God Lord noticed that Lin Xiu was trying to get up the stairs once again and he smiled.

It changes according to the strength of the warrior?!

Interesting!

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, gathered all of his energy and rushed up the stairs.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Within a short period of time, Lin Xiu finally got up the stairs.

“Thirty seconds.”

Riyan God Lord smiled when he saw Lin Xiu standing before him.

“What’s wrong? Tell me.”

Seeing how Lin Xiu had something he wanted to know, Riyan God Lord went straight to the point.

“God Lord, I’m looking for someone. Would you be able to help me?”

Lin Xiu looked at Riyan God Lord and asked sincerely.

Luo Yue…

This time, he was at one of the God King’s pavilions in the Warrior God Realm. There should be all sorts of information in this pavilion.

As long as Luo Yue has identified herself here, he should be able to find her.

“Since you got first, I shall help you with that.”

Riyan God Lord paused for a moment before asking.

“What’s the name?”

He reached out and placed his hand on an invisible wall.

Then, a screen appeared on the wall.

“Do you have pictures?”

“Yes.”

Lin Xiu started pressing on his watch.

An image of Luo Yue appeared on the watch.

Riyan God Lord looked at the image and started pressing on the screen. Soon, Luo Yue’s image was uploaded onto the screen.

The search engine on the screen was activated immediately.

Lin Xiu kept his eyes on the screen.

About an hour later, the search engine seemed to have filtered through all of the warriors that have registered themselves into the Warrior God Realm.

However, her name could not be found.

“She’s not here.”

Riyan God Lord shook his head.

Lin Xiu looked disappointed as well.

The Warrior God Realm is huge and there were nine different states. It was obvious that Luo Yue wasn’t in the same one as him.

“What is her name?”

Riyan God Lord seemed to have thought of something.

“Luo Yue.”

Lin Xiu gave a simple reply.

“She’s the same age as me and would be as powerful as well.”

Luo Yue has the physique of a warrior god and she would definitely be able to break through easily once she got here.

“I’ll help you look for her. If she has participated in any contest, I should be able to find her in the ranks.”

Riyan God Lord then continued tapping away on the screen.

Soon, the search engine started working again.

“Ding!”

Then, there was a sharp ring that came from the screen as if it had found something!

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrunk uncontrollably.

“I think…..we found her.”

Riyan God Lord was a little caught off guard. He was merely trying to help but he didn’t think that it would work.

“Let me see!”

Lin Xiu quickly stepped forward.

As he took a closer look, it was indeed Luo Yue’s information on the screen.

“From Meizhou, 310th on the Warrior God Rank.”

These were the only information displayed on the screen.

Along with an image of Luo Yue.

It was without question that this was Luo Yue.

“Can you find out where she is now?”

Lin Xiu was starting to get anxious.

“No.”

Riyan God Lord shook his head.

“The Warrior God Rank is a rank system for the young warriors from all states. It only opens once every 6 months.”

“This one has already closed.”

Closed…..?

“When’s the next one?”

Lin Xiu continued asking.

“Soon? In about 2 months.”

Lin Xiu clenched his fist together.

Two months…..

In two months, he would have to participate in this contest!

“Well, before that, you would have to go to Tianmen City.”

“Perhaps you may even meet her there.”

Riyan God Lord gave a suggestion.

Tianmen City was the same as the Warrior God Rank. They were both open to powerful warrior gods of the younger generation.
