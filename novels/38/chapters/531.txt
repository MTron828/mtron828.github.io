Chapter 532: Devouring the Dark Spirit Fruit

“Rank 8 warrior!?”

Jiang Tao’s heart skipped a beat when he heard Bai Fei’s roar.

There was still an unbridgeable gap between these rank 7 and rank 8 warriors, much less the rank 6 warriors!

This Bai Fei, since he was the young master of the Royal Beast Sect, if he really kills him…

“Hehehe, if you’re smart, just let me go…” Bai Fei seemed to see the expressions of everyone at this time, and he couldn’t help but say with a smile.

Lin Xiu pulled out the Dark Edge spear from the ground and pointed directly at his head.

“You dare!”

Seeing this scene, Bai Fei immediately roared.

Boom–

Lin Xiu sneered. Under the shocked gazes of everyone, the spear in his hand stabbed into Bai Fei’s head instantly.

Blood spurted out in an instant.

Bai Fei’s eyes were still wide open at this time, as if he couldn’t believe it – Lin Xiu really dared to stab him like this.

Jiang Tao’s eyes widened at this time, and then he said in a trembling voice, “You really killed… him…?”

“En, this matter has nothing to do with you.” Lin Xiu nodded, and then said lightly.

“Brother Lin, I’m sorry, it’s really…” Jiang Tao smiled bitterly at this time as if he wanted to say something.

“I understand.” Lin Xiu smiled calmly, Jiang Tao just didn’t want to involve all his team members.

After all, if they really faced a rank 8 warrior, dozens of people in their team would be easily wiped out.

“I’ll keep it a secret for you.” Jiang Tao looked around and said aloud.

There was no surveillance camera or anything here. It was impossible for people to know that these people from the Royal Beast Sect were dead.

At this moment, Luo Yue suddenly rushed forward with a long sword, and then stabbed Bai Fei’s body!

As the long sword stabbed at Bai Fei’s chest, a dull sound sounded, and the clothes on his chest exploded instantly.

Boom–

“What’s wrong?” Lin Xiu couldn’t help but be surprised when he saw this scene.

Taking a closer look, as Luo Yue’s sword stabbed down, it sounded like something short-circuited and exploded in Bai Fei’s chest.

Luo Yue used her long sword to pick up a very thin, weird-looking thing that looked like a chip.

“Locator, and it has a camera.” Luo Yue said lightly at this time.

“He put this thing in his battle suit?” Lin Xiu was surprised.

And if you look closely, this thing was next to Bai Fei’s chest. As long as Bai Fei’s heart stops beating, this thing would have the effect of positioning and taking pictures.

Lin Xiu’s face had probably been recorded by this instrument.

And this thing could also be located directly by satellite.

“Fortunately, you destroyed it.” Jiang Tao sighed in relief at this time.

“This Thunder Valley has a special magnetic field that can shield the network signal. It does the same for the signal from this locator, right?” Lin Xiu said at this time.

“I don’t know.” Jiang Tao shook his head, then smiled wryly.

“Forget it, we’ll work it out when something happens.” Since he killed the people of the Royal Beast Sect, Lin Xiu was not afraid of their revenge. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

Luo Yue’s expression didn’t change at all.

Jiang Tao looked at Luo Yue and Lin Xiu and couldn’t help shaking his head. These two were really not afraid of anything.

“Dispose of their bodies.” Jiang Tao looked back and then said aloud to his team members.

“Yes!”

When these warriors heard Jiang Tao’s words, they began to clean up the bodies of these warriors and looted all the valuables on them.

After all, a rank 6 warrior has a lot of treasures on his body. Even their equipment and weapons were extraordinary.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were still standing beside the Dark Spirit Fruit, and after thinking about it, Lin Xiu picked the two fully ripe Dark Spirit Fruit.

“Let’s try it?” Lin Xiu handed one of the Dark Spirit Fruits to Luo Yue and said with a smile.

“Yeah.” Luo Yue was pretentious as she held this dark spirit fruit and hesitated for a while, then opened her small mouth and took a bite.

Lin Xiu smiled when he saw this scene, and then bit down on the Dark Spirit Fruit in his hand.

It gave him a special feeling, as if all kinds of flavors were mixed together, and it also has a faint minty sensation.

It’s really a strange feeling…

Lin Xiu didn’t care about this and quickly devoured the Dark Spirit Fruit at this moment.

Soon, after the Dark Spirit Fruit was swallowed up by Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu could clearly feel a burning sensation from his pubic region.

This burning sensation was instantly transmitted from his pubic region to all parts of his body.

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue who was in front of him, she had already sat down with her legs crossed.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu also sat down with his legs crossed at this time, and then used his ‘Cultivation Technique’.

This ‘Cultivation Technique’ not only absorbs the energy in the air but also speeds up the absorption of the energy in the body.

Jiang Tao looked at the young faces of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, and couldn’t help but sigh, “Seems like I’m really quite old…”

At this time, Lin Xiu was activating the ‘Cultivation Technique’, feeling that the activity of the cells in his body suddenly increased crazily.

And his cells were dividing faster.

A steady stream of power surges through the body, infiltrating its own cells, bones, and muscles.

Lin Xiu felt that while his body was in severe pain, he was also filled with a strange sense of comfort.

Lin Xiu was now immersed in a wonderful atmosphere as if he had forgotten the time.

When Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, he found that Luo Yue, who was also sitting cross-legged across from him, also opened his eyes at this time.

At this time, the sun was setting, and the dim sunlight was shining on Luo Yue’s cheeks, looking beautiful.

“How do you feel?” Lin Xiu opened his eyes and smiled at Luo Yue.

“Already at the intermediate level.” Luo Yue nodded and said aloud.

The middle stage of a rank 7 warrior!

“It seems that the effect is quite strong.” Lin Xiu was also excited at this time.

Then he opened his panel and saw that the progress bar of his experience seemed to have increased a lot!

He just needed 100 million more experience and would be able to level up! And all his attributes had improved a lot!

After swallowing this thing, he could actually also gain experience?

Feeling all this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but get excited.

Moreover, the effect of this dark spirit fruit was only manifested now, and within the next week, the effect of this dark spiritual fruit would completely disappear.

“You guys aren’t eating it?” Lin Xiu looked to the side and found that Jiang Tao and the others were still sitting nearby.

It seemed that he was protecting himself and Luo Yue. Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu had a very good impression of him.
