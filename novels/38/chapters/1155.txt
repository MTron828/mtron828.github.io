1156 Fatal Blow Successfully Activated!

Boom boom – –

The entire ground was shaking non-stop.

The warriors gods who each had a sword and a machete had their

‘Sphere’s released but the temperature from the flaming birds was too high. Plus, these flaming birds had a detection system and even when they tried to dodge it, the flaming birds were still able to land on their ‘sphere’.

The warriors had a drastic change on their faces due to the temperature. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

They could feel that their ‘sphere’s were being burnt by the scorching heat and it was about to melt.

It was hot. Incredibly hot.

As for the Pavilion master of Tianlan Pavillion, he was pushed far behind by the horrible impact of the explosion from the lotus fires.

His entire body was framed onto the wall behind him.

“AHHHH!!!”

He roared as he tried to free himself.

It could be clearly seen that all of the veins on his body were popping and he looked hideous.

“I want you dead!!!”

As he moved, all of the energy in his body was released before he flew towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu wanted to attack the two other warrior gods but when he saw the elder coming at him, the look in his eyes changed.

Lin Xiu tightened his grip on the long spear and then turned it towards the old man!

Clang – –

The old man quickly clenched his fist and aimed it at the long spear that was coming at him. Instantly, there was a loud sound that came from the collision.

The ola man’s body was forced to the back.

There was a pair of indestructible gloves that appeared on the old man’s fist.

It was clear that he was a fist master.

Fist master like him would be at a disadvantage if he didn’t get close to his enemy.

This was when Lin Xiu continued moving the long spear in his hands.

Numerous dark blue flaming birds were released continuously.

“This is nothing!”

The old man was already furious. As he saw how there were flaming birds coming at him continuously, he roared as he swung his fist around.

Boom boom boom – –

This man was using his fist to attack the dark blue flaming birds and he managed to destroy him!

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank uncontrollably when he saw what was happening.

This old man was so much more powerful than he thought!

When the old man was about to attack him again, Lin Xiu quickly released the ‘Heavenly Array’ as well as the ‘Purification Domain’.

Soon, there was a bright white glow that came from Lin Xiu and then it expanded across the ground.

With the help of the ‘Heavenly Array’, Lin Xiu’s abilities became stronger.

Then, Lin Xiu quickly used the ‘Full Blown Profound Intent’!

As for the two other warrior gods, they finally recovered from the flaming birds and went after Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu sneered and transferred energy into his long spear.

‘Heaven Breaking Strike’!!!

While using the skill, there was a huge explosion that occurred.

Boom – –

There was a dome shaped glow that suddenly appeared.

“Ding! The Fatal Blow has been successfully activated!”

Suddenly, a notification appeared from the system inside Lin Xiu’s head.

The Fatal Blow successfully activated?

Lin Xiu was shocked as well when he heard the notification.

The two warrior gods wanted to block Lin Xiu’s attack but they didn’t think that they would suddenly be hit by such a strong, terrifying force.

Then, their body was blasted into pieces.

They died instantly!

“Congratulations, Master! You have killed a warrior god. EXP achieved 52994644…”

There were two other notifications that appeared from the system after he killed the warrior gods.

Lin Xiu took a close look at the progress bar and realised that there was a 2% increase.

How is this possible?!

When Lin Xiu activated the ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’, the pavilion master, who was the old man, managed to dodge it with some peculiar method.

However, his men, his best men…..died instantly from the blow!

The old man couldn’t believe it.

Both of them were warrior gods!!

Who on earth was this young boy?!

Just when the old man was still in shock, Lin Xiu was already coming at him with his long spear!

Clang clang clang – –

The old man narrowed his eyes and quickly moved his fist in order to block Lin Xiu’s long spear.

‘Profound Intent – Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers!’

Lin Xiu quickly chose his next skill.

Then, there were multiple spears that appeared in the air.

All of them were aimed at different parts of his body.

Even if the old man had quick reflexes, it was still impossible for him to dodge and block all of the attacks from Lin Xiu.

Boom boom boom – –

As the tip of the spear landed on his ‘sphere’, the old man let out a soft groan.

The strong impact forced his body to move backwards.

He was getting pinned by Lin Xiu and he didn’t have a chance.

Damn it!

How could this young man be so strong?!

The old man’s face looked horrible. He wanted to attack but Lin Xiu was too fast. As soon as he raised his arm, there would be another spear coming at him.

He had no other choice.

Then, his body started shining with a bright purple light.

A huge ‘eye’ figure appeared behind the old man.

What was that?

Lin Xiu saw the figure as well.

The next moment, Lin Xiu felt as if there was a pause button and he could no longer move his body!

“Die!!!”

The old man roared as he landed a hard punch on Lin Xiu’s chest!

Boom – –

With another soft groan, Lin Xiu’s body was like a kite being snipped off from its thread!

“Hmph! I had to use my spirit power.”

The old man said coldly.

However, just as he was speaking, there was blood coming out of his mouth.

He touched the corner of his lips and he looked uncomfortable.

The impact from Lin Xiu’s attacks had caused internal injuries.

Just as he was about to continue attacking Lin Xiu, there was a huge flaming phoenix that came from the main entrance!

The old man’s eyes were opened wide when he saw what was coming at him.

The phoenix was huge and the temperature of it was much higher than those from the flaming birds earlier!

Boom – –

As the phoenix flapped its wings, there wasn’t a single corner in the Xiantian Mansion that he could hide!

“Crap!!”

The old man screamed. The only thing that he could do now was to gather as much energy as possible to strengthen his ‘sphere’ in order to block this attack!
