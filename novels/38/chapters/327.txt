Chapter 328: Zhang Jie

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The woman licked her lips and said to the warriors.

When those warriors heard this woman’s words, their bodies trembled.

Terrifying, she’s terrifying. They never expected that their leader, a rank 7 warrior would die just like that even before he had time to unfold the ‘sphere’.

In this short period of time, they have lost two warriors!

The terrifying power of this person made them tremble.

One of the warriors’ legs trembled and at the next moment, he turned around and ran to the other side.

As the man ran away, the other men ran as well.

These people had no fighting spirit left in them at all.

This woman’s strength had far exceeded their imagination.

“You’re not leaving?” At this moment, the woman looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

“Why should I?” Lin Xiu stared at her without the slightest fear and said indifferently.

But on the inside, Lin Xiu was still in shock. His Analytic Eye was activated and he found out that the strength of this woman was clearly the level of a rank 7 warrior, which was similar to the rank of some of the warriors just now.

But why, why was the difference in strength so huge!?

“Oh? So you are not in the same group as those people…” A strange look appeared in the woman’s eyes, then she licked her red lips and said.

“Is she the one you are talking about?” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue next to him and asked.

“Yeah.” Luo Yue nodded, then looked at the woman over there and said, “Zhang Jie, let’s settle our differences here.”

The woman Luo Yue called ‘Zhang Jie’ burst into laughter, “Settle it? With your current level?”

“I still remember how you were beaten by me here a few days ago and you even dropped your sword? Didn’t expect that you would dare to come back here.” Zhang Jie said coldly while looking at Luo Yue. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

However, Luo Yue heard her words and did not speak, but moved closer to her step by step.

“Courting death!!!”

Seeing Luo Yue’s movements, Zhang Jie seemed angered and suddenly rushed towards Luo Yue!

Her speed was very fast. At this time, she charged over and found that Luo Yue also rushed directly towards her.

This made Zhang Jie feel as if she had been challenged and her expression turned sinister.

With a wave of the ring in her hand, the two rings flew directly to Luo Yue!

The rings were spinning crazily at an extremely fast speed and appeared to become rays of cold light.

Dang–

Luo Yue saw this scene and with a violent wave of the long sword, it hit the spinning rings.

But not only did the rings not budge from Luo Yue’s attack, Luo Yue even felt a strong impact which caused her to take a few steps back.

Also, there was another spinning ring behind rushing towards Luo Yue at a crazy speed!

Dang–

Just then, Lin Xiu charged ahead directly, then he thrust his spear and knocked the spinning ring directly.

Lin Xiu’s hit was just like Luo Yue’s; they both felt the strong impact from the spinning ring and took a few steps back.

But Luo Yue took advantage of this opportunity to avoid the direct impact of these rings!

Swish swish–

These two rings crashed into the trees behind Luo Yue and like a circular electric saw that rotates wildly, they instantly cut off all the branches of the giant trees behind.

Boom boom——

The row of huge trees with black branches all fell down, letting out loud noises.

This is too scary...

Lin Xiu saw this scene and his eyes were full of shock.

Because Lin Xiu knew that the bark of these trees was very tough.

And he didn’t expect that such tough trees would be chopped off so easily.

“Hehe, seems like you guys are pretty strong ah.”

Soon, the two rings that were spinning crazily in the air flew back directly into Zhang Jie’s hands and she caught them.

“Next, I will kill both of you.”

After catching the rings in her hand, Zhang Jie looked at Luo Yue, then at Lin Xiu, and let out a weird laugh.

Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear tightly with both hands as he looked at Zhang Jie and his body tensed up.

He felt that this woman was unlike ordinary warriors and had a dangerous air around her.

This was similar to how he felt towards Luo Huatian.

But it was clear that Luo Huatian’s was much more dangerous than this woman.

“Leave.” Luo Yue held the long sword in her right hand tightly then said to Lin Xiu.

“No way.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

“Both of you shall not leave! Both of you must die here!” Zhang Jie said sinistery, then moved directly towards Luo Yue and Lin Xiu!

Just like before, the moment she rushed over, her hands waved hard and the two rings in her hand spun in the air at a very fast speed as they charged towards Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

“‘Awe of the phoenix’!!!” Lin Xiu yelled suddenly and waved the Dark Edge spear with both hands vigorously. At this moment, one after another flaming birds burst out of Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear.

They charged forward directly!

The flame was very hot and the air seemed distorted because of the fire!

Zhang Jie had already taken out a short knife at this time and when she was about to continue charging over, she noticed the flaming birds released by Lin Xiu.

Seeing this scene, her expression changed slightly and a hint of surprise appeared in her eyes.

But she reacted very quickly and easily dodged the attack of the flames.

Moreover, the double ring she tossed didn’t seem affected by the flames and directly rush towards Lin Xiu!
