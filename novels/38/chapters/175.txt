Chapter 176: Golden-Back Wild Bull

From the time they arrived at the G17 Ruin, apart from the group of zombies they just encountered, they didn’t see any evolved beast.

This was a bit weird.

“According to the data, the place with the most evolved beasts should be in the area ahead.” Lin Xiu said while looking at the phone in his hand.

As they were walking, Lin Xiu took advantage of this time to log in to the Warrior Union website with his phone and paid to search for information about the G17 Ruin.

It wasn’t that there were no evolved beasts, there were so many!

The entire G17 Ruin used to be a big city, but it became like this because of the outbreak of the virus.

According to the display on the map, they were probably around the borders only.

Roar——

At this moment, Lin Xiu and the others heard a roar.

“It’s here!” Luo Yue’s gaze changed and Lin Xiu rushed forward at the same time!

The roar of the mutated beast was very loud and deafening.

It looks like a big guy, at least a rank 4 evolved beast!

“Wait for us, guys!” At this moment, Zhang Yin and the others saw Lin Xiu and Luo Yue rushing up and they ran forward with their own weapons as well.

Boom——

At the same time, the wall of a building at a corner in front was smashed in an instant.

A huge figure dashed towards Lin Xiu and Luo Yue!

“Dodge!” Seeing this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted.

At this time, he turned his body and dodged.

Luo Yue leaped up high and cut down with her long sword!

Dang——

The long sword slashed the back of the evolved beast and there was a sudden sound of metals colliding.

Can’t cut through?!

Luo Yue’s gaze also changed at this moment. She turned her body, stabilized herself in the air, and jumped to the other side.

Lin Xiu activated his Analytic Eye instantly.

Rank 5 evolved beast—— Golden-back Wild Bull!

Characteristics: After the infection, the ordinary cow has been mutated. Its body shape is like a giant elephant with a mutated back. Its back is golden yellow in color and is the hardest part of the body.

“This is a rank 5 evolved beast, be careful!!!” Lin Xiu shouted and in the next instant, he pounced in front and rushed over, directly avoiding the collision of the Golden back wild bull.

Although the size of this darn thing was very large, its speed was very fast, especially when it charged over, a force like that actually destroyed the surrounding buildings.

It was very strong, extremely strong!

It seemed to be annoyed by Luo Yue’s attack just now. After charging to the opposite side, it shook its head and turned back to attack Luo Yue who was standing there!

“Damn!” Zhang Yin and the others muttered a curse when they saw this scene.

This was a rank 5 evolved beast and its strength was comparable to a rank 4 warrior!

They were only at the peak state of a rank 3 warrior and the body of this thing was so huge, just looking at it gave them pressure.

Rumble rumble——

As the Golden back wild bull rushed towards Luo Yue frantically, the entire ground seemed to shake.

Luo Yue frowned slightly, then a force burst forth from her body as she rushed forward without avoiding it!

Lin Xiu also chased behind, carrying his Dark Edge spear and attacking from behind!

The back of this Golden back wild bull was the hardest part. It was not easy to break its defense and could only be attacked from the side!

The moment it hit Luo Yue, Luo Yue’s body seemed to be light and fluttering as she flew directly into the air. Moreover, at this moment, the body of the long sword transformed into an illusion of a huge long sword, which directly pierced into its huge and black eyes!

Bang bang——

As the two sounds rang out like something was being jabbed, the eyes of this Golden back wild bull burst!

What kind of skill is this!?

Lin Xiu’s jaw dropped when he saw this scene.

At this moment, the Golden back wild bull suddenly let out a miserable roar and its body moved violently, charging everywhere.

The huge horns hit Luo Yue’s body directly!

Luo Yue, who was caught off guard, flew out directly. Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Lin Xiu stopped moving when he saw this scene and leaped. As he flew out, he hugged Luo Yue’s body and landed on the ground.

“Are you okay?” Lin Xiu whispered.

Luo Yue shook her head and broke free of Lin Xiu’s embrace as she looked at the Golden back wild bull in front that was trampling and crashing around like crazy.

With it being in this state, it was a challenge to even attack it in close range, not to mention kill it.

The ground around them was being trampled by it like crazy and a lot of cracks had appeared, the ground nearby seemed to be shaking slightly too.

Zhang Yin and the others stood at the same spot while they watched helplessly.

In this situation, who dares to step forward and attack, huh!

“Release a skill from a distance!” Lin Xiu looked at Zhang Yin and the others on the opposite side and yelled.

As soon as Lin Xiu said that, he swung his Dark Edge spear in the air.

At this moment, several flaming birds rushed from all directions to the Golden back wild bull who was going crazy there!

“I’ll give you a whole roasted beef!” Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and kept releasing the ‘Awe of the phoenix’ skill.

It has been upgraded to a gold skill. At this moment, Lin Xiu could release more than 30 flaming birds at once!

And the temperature of this flaming bird was also very high.

As a large number of flaming birds crashed against the body of the Golden back wild bull, at this moment, a tornado of flames was formed again, burning the Golden back wild bull madly.

“‘Mountains and Earth Split’!!!” Zhang Yin jumped up from a distance at this time and struck down.

In an instant, deep gullies appeared on the ground around them and attacked the bull directly while Li Ping and Jiang Li used the ‘Crescent Slash’ to form a crescent-like sword attack!

Due to the burning of flames, the thick hair on the body of this Golden back wild bull has been completely burned, and its skin blackened.

The skills hit the side of its body and wounds appeared as its blood continued to flow down.

Good chance!

As the flames produced by Lin Xiu’s skill slowly reduced, Luo Yue’s gaze changed in the next moment, and she rushed over like a bullet out of the chamber!

Swish——

At this moment, her long sword slashed directly at the neck of the Golden back wild bull.

Slash!
