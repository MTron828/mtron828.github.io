1460 Wedding Planning

“We finally got them all.”

Lin Xiu then let out a breath of relief as well.

It definitely wasn’t as easy as he had imagined to kill all four God Kings.

The Flames of Chaos may be powerful but it was useless towards these God Kings.

Plus, as God Kings, many of them already had certain resistance towards these flames.

“Let’s head over to Tianbei City first.”

Luo Huatian suggested.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu then nodded his head.

Then, he looked at Luo Yue before flying up into the air once again.

All three of them headed straight for Tianbei City.

There were lots of warriors from the Tianshen Pavillion who were still waiting in the air.

They seem to be waiting for their God Kings to return after killing Lin Xiu.

“The God Kings….!”

Some of them noticed that it was Lin Xiu instead and they had a bad feeling about it.

Their God Kings were not here. Perhaps…

Then, they immediately knew that something had gone wrong.

“Run!”

Just when they confirmed that it was Lin Xiu and his gang, all of them had a different look in their eyes.

They could confirm now that their God Kings have died!

Just as they wanted to run off, there were countless flaming birds that chased after them from the other direction.

There were so many of them.

Some of the warriors were stunned when they noticed this.

Then, they had subconsciously released their ‘sphere’s.

Boom boom boom – –

However, when the flaming birds hit their bodies, there were loud sounds that followed.

All of their ‘sphere’s melted instantly.

The Flame of Chaos then got in contact with their bodies.

Their bodies then started burning.

Soon, all of the warrior gods were killed by Lin Xiu!

But, his progress bar only grew by 0.1%.

The EXP brought by these ordinary warriors were too little.

“Should have gotten rid of all of them here.”

Lin Xiu then tried hunting for those that he might have missed.

However, after checking the surrounding hundred miles, there were any warrior gods found.

It was most likely that those from the Tianshen Pavilion had already been killed.

“All of them are dead?”

Luo Huantian then shifted his focus onto Tianbei City and he looked defeated.

He had been here for quite some time and had made friends.

But now, the entire city has been destroyed.

Most of the people that he knew have already been killed.

“When are the both of you planning to head back?”

Hua Luotian then asked Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

They have already gotten the tool spirit and Luo Yue even got to absorb the Black Waters. It was about time for them to leave this planet.

“We’ll head back after this.”

Lin Xiu thought about it for a minute before answering.

“Really?”

“Will you be preparing to get married once you’re back?”

Luo Huatian then started teasing them.

Luo Yue did not have any expressions on her face but it was obvious that there was a faint red blush on her cheeks.

“Yes. We will.”

Lin Xiu answered sincerely.

This was what he actually had in mind.

He should be able to become a God King very soon.

He should be able to head onto the next level very soon after killing Ling Tianxi and the rest.

Everything would be ending soon.

He has been involved in countless battles and fights for years.

He did indeed feel a little tired.

This time, he would like to head back to earth and visit some of his friends.

Then, they shall hold a wedding on earth as well.

“Won’t you be coming with us?”

Lin Xiu then asked Luo Huatian about his plans.

“I want to stay on the Dark Planet for now.”

“You saw it yourself. The Dark Planet has turned into such a state. I want to rebuild it.”

Luo Huatian made his decision.

He was already deeply involved with this place.

“You’ve decided?”

“En.”

“Alright. We shall be leaving then.”

Lin Xiu then grabbed onto Luo Yue’s hands.

“Hey! Remember to inform me when you’re getting married!”

Hua Luotian chuckled.

“Of course.”

“I wouldn’t leave out my brother-in-law!”

Lin Xiu chuckled as well. Then, he pulled out the Spatial Cube from his expansion space.

The Spatial Cube then started spinning quickly as Lin Xiu held onto it.

Let’s head back!

Then, there was a bright light that appeared before them and there was a small gap in the space ahead.

Hand in hand, Luo Yue and Lin Xiu then disappeared in the bright light.

“I should also cultivate to become a warrior god soon.”

Seeing how Lin Xiu and Luo Yue had left, Luo Huatian mumbled to himself.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue did not head back to earth immediately. They’ve decided to return to the Warrior God Realm and visit Lingxian City first.

As soon as they got there, Lin Xiu was shocked by what he saw.

The entire city has been destroyed!

There was debris everywhere.

“WHO DID THIS?!”

Liu Xiu roared in rage.

Then, he quickly flew closer to the ground.

Everything has been destroyed and there were bodies of warriors everywhere.

When he rushed back to his City Lord Mansion, Lei Chong and Mr Pang were also dead as well.

Their bodies have been left on the ground.

Luo Yue quickly followed and she was stunned by what she saw.

“There were a bunch of God Kings that bombarded this place with their warrior skills.”

Then, a familiar voice appeared.

It was Pang Tong!

“Was it Ling Tianxi?”

When Lin Xiu saw that it was Pang Tong, he quickly asked about who was behind this.

“I’m not sure.”

“I only knew that one of them was Hetian God King.”

Pang Tong shook his head.

As he was a commander of the transportation device, he was spared due to Tianling God King.

“It is them!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes turned cold.

When he looked around him, Lin Xiu was filled with rage.

Then, he took a deep breath and tried to calm himself.

Then, he reached out his right hand and released an overpowering amount of energy. The energy that blasted and there were energy waves that were released across the city.

After absorbing the Flame of Chaos, Lin Xiu has also gained an incredible amount of energy.

There was still limitless energy being released.

Soon, all of them covered the entire city!

Crack – –

Suddenly, the ground started shaking.

The buildings around slowly recovered under their sight!

This was a large scale time reverse!!!
