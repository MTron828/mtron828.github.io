Sha Li sneered. At this moment, with his thoughts, black energy continued to be released from his body.

It seems that the released black energy will soon cover the surroundings!

Lin Xiu looked at this scene and the corners of his mouth curled up.

With a wave of his right hand, at this moment, a white light was released again.

The dark energy he just released seemed to be suppressed at this moment.

There is no way to continue to release it.

The pupils in Sha Li’s eyes shrank slightly. He wanted to show off his powerful source field power just now, but he never expected that at this moment, his source field seemed to be suppressed by some strange power and he couldn’t use it at all!

Hell!

There was disbelief in his eyes.

Before he had time to think about it, Lin Xiu had already appeared in front of him in an instant by using the ‘Flashing Souls’ movement technique!

The fist full of source strength slammed towards Sha Li’s cheek!

“Courting death!”

Seeing this scene, the look in Sha Li’s eyes changed slightly and he subconsciously used his arms to block.

boom–

The power of Lin Xiu’s punch was still very strong. At this time, it hit his arms and a dull sound erupted immediately.

Sha Li’s body flew to the back directly because of the impact of this punch.

“how can that be…”

Sha Li, who flew out, felt the sharp pain in his arms and his face became ferocious.

Whoosh—

And at this moment, before Sha Li flew out to stabilize his figure, Lin Xiu appeared in front of him again!

“Do you like punching?”

Lin Xiu sneered and continued to punch Sha Li with his right fist!

And this punch is not an ordinary punch.

God-level skill – ‘Destroy the Sky’!!!

“what!!!”

Sha Li roared angrily and also swung his fist, hitting Lin Xiu’s fist!

boom–

After the two punches clashed, Lin Xiu’s body did not fly out like before.

On the contrary, Sha Li’s body, because of the terrifying power produced by Lin Xiu’s punch, his entire arm exploded!

That’s right, under the power of this god-level skill ‘Destroy the Sky’, Sha Li’s arm has been blown up.

“AH!!!”

At this moment, a wailing came from Sha Li’s mouth.

He never expected that Lin Xiu’s current punch would possess such terrifying power.

The terrifying force not only caused his arm to explode but also made him feel extreme pain.

It seemed that the power generated by that fist was transmitted to his heart.

It hurts, it really hurts.

But at this moment, Lin Xiu didn’t stop the movements in his hands and continued to punch and attack Sha Li!

The pupils in Sha Li’s eyes shrank slightly, he forcibly held back the severe pain and forcibly mobilized the source strength of his whole body.

With the mobilization of his source strength, the ‘Sphere’ unfolded in an instant.

Bang bang bang——

Lin Xiu didn’t pay attention to the ‘Sphere’ he unfolded and continued to wave his fists, hitting his ‘Sphere’ continuously.

Now Lin Xiu’s every punch is extremely powerful and Sha Li, who has a broken arm, can’t resist it at all.

Crack crack——

With the sound of clear and crisp sounds, he could see a lot of cracks in his ‘Sphere’.

“Break!!!”
