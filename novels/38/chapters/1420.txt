1421 Zheng Xianxuan

In the blink of an eye, Zhao Jichao turned into an enormous figure made of source energy.

Thank you readers!

With the warhammer in his hands, he swung it directly at Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes when he saw what was about to happen.

He tightly gripped around his spear and aimed it toward the warhammer!

Suddenly, there were dark blue flames that appeared all over the tip of the spear.

As soon as the horrifying flames appeared, the temperature in the air around them rose tremendously!

The Hellfire was already incredibly powerful but along with the Dark Edge, it has grown to become even more terrifying.

Boom – –

As the spear and the warhammer collided with each other, there was an incredibly loud explosion heard.

His warhammer was instantly dented and it even started melting!

“Ahhhhhh!!!”

The warhammer then fell onto the ground.

When he took a closer look, he noticed that there were burnt marks all over his palms.

Lin Xiu never gave him the chance to breathe. Lin Xiu continued attacking Zhou Jichao with his spear!

As soon as he thrusted the spear forward, he released the dark energy as well.

It instantly turned into a huge, black dragon!

Seeing how the dragon was coming at him, Zhou Jichao looked frightened.

“Ahhhhhh!!!!”

The man roared as he gathered all of his energy onto his ‘sphere’!

Boom – –

However, the black dragon had already collided with his ‘sphere’!

Then, there was another loud explosion that followed.

The black dragon was terrifying and it instantly blasted his ‘sphere’s apart!

There was blood coming out of his mouth.

He didn’t think that Lin Xiu’s warrior skills could be so powerful!

“No!”

As he looked up, Lin Xiu was already dashing toward him with his spear and Zhou Jichao had a bad feeling about it.

Boom – –

With his last cry, Lin Xiu’s spear had already pierced through his body!

“Zhou Jichao who’s in the 100th rank got killed…”

The rest of the spectators had their eyes opened wide and they looked stunned.

Lin Xiu pulled away the spear from the opponent’s body and the stage quickly got on stage to get rid of the body.

Lin Xiu then continued looking for his next challenge.

Those who were in the top 100 were strong warriors and the difference in strength between each individual warrior was huge. No ordinary warriors would skip the ranks.

However, Lin Xiu skipped all the way to the 85th warriors!

In the top 100, they could only skil up to 15 ranks.

“85th, Zheng Xianxuan!”

When the rest of them saw who Lin Xiu had picked, all of them were shocked.

None of them would have thought that Lin Xiu could continue challenging.

And, he had skipped the other warriors and went to the 85th rank!

“Master Long, it looks like this man wants to be in the top 100.”

At the same time, a man was reporting the results to another man who was dressed in a golden armour.

The man in the golden armour was Long Xingtian.

Known as the best amongst God Kings, the 1st on the God Battle List!

“Haven’t we seen quite a lot of such people?”

Long Xingtian spoke in a casual tone.

“You’re right. There are a lot of people who don’t know their place.”

The man next to him chuckled.

“It’s already a blessing that he made it into the top 100 and he’s still fantasising about the first?”

There would be reward for every victorious fight in the God Battle List.

However, the higher up, the more rubbish these rewards would become.

“It’s the last day. I knew that there would be a lot of people who would challenge me.”

Then, there was a bright glow that appeared and a man stood opposite Lin Xiu inside the ring.

Zheng Xianxuan!

He had a bow as his weapon.

This was a rare weapon and was also the first time that Lin Xiu had seen anyone use this.

He only had a bow with no arrow.

Zheng Xianxuan quickly lifted his bow and aimed it at Lin Xiu!

He pulled his bow and then, there was an arrow made of source energy that appeared and it was headed straight at Lin Xiu!

In the beginning, Lin Xiu wasn’t cautious about it.

However, he didn’t think that the arrow would move so quickly.

Xiu – –

The arrow that swift past Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

“You’re quick on your feet.”

Zheng Xianxuan furrowed his brows.

But, he did not stop.

He continued pulling his bow.

Then, there were countless arrows that were continuously headed for Lin Xiu!

As the energy arrows were released, there was a sharp ear-piercing sound that travelled through the air.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Lin Xiu continued moving around and instantly appeared before Zheng Xianxuan.

Lin Xiu had his spear in his arm and it was aimed at Zheng Xianxuan’s body!

Zheng Xianxuan’s pupil shrank subconsciously and tried to block the attack with his bow.

Then, there was a dagger that slipped from the sleeves from his right arm.

As he held onto the dagger, he thrusted it into Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

It was aimed right in the centre of Lin Xiu’s chest.

However, Zheng Xianxuan then learnt shocking news. It was impossible for his spear to pierce through Lin Xiu’s chest!

This was impossible.

This was the dagger that he had prepared for a close combat fight.

This was what he was waiting for.

But, the sharp dagger that he had could not be jabbed into Lin Xiu’s chest!

Only a small part of the tip went in.

Zheng Xianxuan’s eyes were wide open from the shock.

Then, he felt a surge of energy coming at him and he was pushed far away along with the dagger.

Lin Xiu then lifted his leg and kicked Zheng Xianxuan in the stomach, throwing him even further away!

Following that, Lin Xiu swung his spear in the air and there were countless horrifying lightning bolts that appeared.

There were thick lighting bolts that instantly wrapped around his body!

“Ahhhhhh!!!!!”

The strong electric current from it caused his face to turn pale.

These lightning bolts were like a tight rope wrapped around his body and he couldn’t move!

Before he was allowed to move, Lin Xiu thrusted his spear forward! Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

In a few seconds, Lin Xiu had already stabbed the man before him thousands of times.

The man’s body had turned into a honeycomb!

Zheng Xianxuan, dead!

The entire arena turned quiet.

This was terriying!

Zheng Xianxuan who was placed 85th did not have the chance to fight Lin Xiu.

“This man…..he’s powerful…”

The rest of the warriors around trembled in fear.

Those who were on the God Battle List were just dolls to Lin Xiu.

“He’s….he’s picking his next opponent!”
