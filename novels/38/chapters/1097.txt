“Want it?”

Lin Xiu shook the token in front of them.

When Elder Bai saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

“give it to me!”

At this moment, Elder Bai moved and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

!!

His speed was very fast and the moment he finished speaking, he appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

Reaching out, he was about to grab the token in Lin Xiu’s hands.

swoosh—

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s figure disappeared instantly.

Elder Bai grabbed the air!

Where is he!?

Elder Bai had no idea that Lin Xiu’s speed would be so fast.

Lin Xiu’s figure appeared on the other side.

“kill him!”

Elder Bai’s face became gloomy and he shouted angrily.

As soon as he finished speaking, in the next moment, those warriors in the air released various skills at the same time, charging towards Lin Xiu and Ye Kai!

Ye Kai’s expression changed greatly at this time and he subconsciously unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

Just as he unfolded the ‘Sphere’, a matrix covered his body.

This is…

Seeing the sudden appearance of the matrix that framed himself in it, Ye Kai’s pupils shrank slightly.

boom boom boom —

Before Ye Kai could react, a large amount of skill power rushed towards him and Lin Xiu.

Suddenly, a loud noise sounded.

At this time, Lin Xiu had already unfolded the ‘Sphere’.

Those seemingly terrifying skills were all blocked by Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

These skills did not cause any damage to Lin Xiu at all.

“I’ll continue to use you guys to practice…”

At this moment, Lin Xiu mumbled to himself.

He triggered his thoughts, at this moment, a large amount of black energy bodies suddenly emerged.

‘Silence’.

As the source strength of Lin Xiu’s body erupted, these black energies instantly charged toward the numerous warriors around!

Whish-

Those dark energies rushed to the surrounding warriors like a tide.

“Get out of the way!”

Elder Bai looked at these dark energies and the expression in his eyes changed slightly.

Those warriors in the sky were still attacking Lin Xiu.

But at this time, there was absolutely no way to dodge.

Those dark energies that rushed through like a tide covered their bodies in an instant.

As those dark energies covered their bodies, their eyes seemed to lose their radiance in an instant.

“die.”

At the same time as Lin Xiu said in a faint voice, the bodies of those warriors covered by dark energies all fell to the ground.

They could not even scream or struggle and they all fell to the ground.

All their vitality was drained by those dark energies.

Even those warriors of the Respected warrior level who unfolded the ‘Sphere’ were not spared.

bang bang bang-

As a large number of warriors continued to fall from the sky, Elder Bai’s complexion had become extremely ugly.

“Damn…”

He clasped his hands together.

“‘Silence’, you got ‘Silence’…”

He clearly knew what skill Lin Xiu used just now.

This is one of the three holy-level skills of the Ye family, [Silence].

“He… did he learn this skill?”

Standing behind Elder Bai, Chen Jing’s eyes widened.

His eyes were full of disbelief.

He had also heard of this legendary skill, but he didn’t expect to see it now.

Moreover, this skill is too terrifying. In this short moment, all the warriors of the Bai family in the sky actually died.

Oh right, his warrior was killed by this guy using this skill too.

“It seems that Bai Zhan didn’t get this skill card.”

Elder Bai continued to speak with a gloomy expression.

“Bai Zhan, are you talking about the warrior who died in my hands?”

Li You Xu looked at him and said lightly.

“Humph!”

Elder Bai’s expression became even nastier at this time.

He snorted coldly and the source strength in his body erupted.

Although he couldn’t feel Lin Xiu’s specific strength, Lin Xiu’s performance just now was enough for him to regard Lin Xiu as an opponent of the same level.

gurgle–

With a wave of his hands, all the water in the surrounding pools flew into the air, then gathered towards his hands.

“go!”

Elder Bai shook his hands and a huge water droplet instantly dissipated into thousands of small water droplets, charging toward Lin Xiu!

These small water droplets, at this time, flew faster than bullets. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

If there is no accident, Lin Xiu’s body will be completely damaged by these small water droplets!

And now, Lin Xiu is still standing in place and not dodging!

Just when those thousands of small water droplets were about to hit Lin Xiu’s body, they stopped in the air, as if they were frozen!

how can that be?!

Seeing this scene, Elder Bai’s expression changed greatly.

“go.”

In the next moment, Lin Xiu waved and these thousands of small water droplets stagnating in the air, in turn, charged toward Elder Bai and the others!

‘Sphere’!!!

When Chen Jing saw this scene, he couldn’t care about anything else and directly unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

The same goes for Elder Bai.

bang bang bang-

The remaining warriors of the Chen family in the back were all pierced by those small water droplets.

immediate death.

In a short period of time, the warriors of the Chen family and those brought by the Bai family were almost dead.

It’s just that in addition to Elder Bai, there were four other Sage warriors of the Bai family, standing in the four corners of the place and they haven’t moved, which Lin Xiu found a little weird.

What do these people want to do?

Elder Bai looked at the necklace on Lin Xiu’s neck.

The necklace has five transparent glass balls and inside the glass balls, there is actually some attribute energy in it.

It looks very weird.

Although he was not clear what it is, Lin Xiu has such a powerful strength and it is very likely that it has something to do with it.

Must kill him.

“Elder Bai…”

At this moment, Chen Jing said with a trembling voice.

He never thought that the strength of the people Ye Kai brought would be so strong.

All the warriors under him have died!

His heart is bleeding.

These are the strengths that their Chen family has cultivated for so many years.

“shut up!”

At this time, Elder Bai said with a gloomy expression.

With a move of his right hand, he drew out a long sword from behind him.

This long sword was very strange, it turned out to be all black like charcoal.
