Chapter 102: Warrior Union Website

“It’s out of service a long time ago, there’s only one train that goes there.” The attendant smiled and said.

As the Path of Death was too dangerous, not many people wanted to go, and they couldn’t earn back the operating costs, so they stopped the service.

“Alright,” Lin Xiu nodded helplessly, then booked a ticket for the next morning.

He looked at it and he was in carriage G2.

It seemed that still a lot of people booked the ticket.

Lin Xiu thought for a moment and went to a nearby coffee shop.

He simply ordered a cup of coffee and sat in front of a computer.

The computer was very thin like a card and looked incredible.

Also, the display was all in 3D, the rendering effect was very good.

Lin Xiu took out the Warrior Union card, entered the URL indicated, and opened the website of the Warrior Union.

In the information column, Lin Xiu searched for the keywords ‘Path of Death’, and suddenly a lot of information about the Path of death appeared.

“The evolved beast I found on the Path of Death.”

Looking at a headline like this, Lin Xiu didn’t think much and simply clicked into it.

“10,000 union coins are required to browse this post, do you want to continue?”

As soon as he clicked into it, a prompt appeared.

‘Holy shit! I need to pay!?’

Lin Xiu was stunned, then saw that the other posts also had symbols to indicate that union coins were needed to read them.

Also, there was a message around it. Those posts that required payment had been reviewed by Warrior Union and were confirmed that the post contains accurate information.

Lin Xiu hesitated a little, then entered his Warrior Union number and changed the password. After that, he bound a bank card to it and paid to view the post.

‘I have millions of union coins anyway, this 10,000 isn’t a lot.’

As soon as he clicked on the post, Lin Xiu saw what appeared to be pictures of evolved beasts taken by the warriors and he could see the nearby area.

The Path of Death was surrounded by black rocks, there wasn’t a single blade of grass, and it looked very strange.

“Rank 3 evolved beast, rock snakes, are usually hidden at the bottom of rocks and have paralysis-type toxicity. Those rank 3 and below who get bitten would go directly into a paralysis, motionless state.”

“Rank 4 giant crow has a huge body and often covers its body with its wings, looking just like an ordinary black rock from afar. It is ferocious and would attack crazily when encountered.”

“…”

Lin Xiu kept scrolling down and became more and more frightened. This Path of Death had a variety of evolved beasts, as small as insects and as large as a giant elephant.

Also, there were rank 5 evolved beasts! He could sense a powerful aura just looking at the photos.

After checking on some information, Lin Xiu clicked into the Warrior Union store.

After thinking about it, Lin Xiu typed the words ‘Dark Edge’.

He didn’t expect that there would actually be results.

“Dark Edge Double Sword”

There was an introduction at the bottom that it was made of black iron meteorite and the only one that was on sale in the Warrior Union mall.

The listed price turned out to be a billion!!!

And this was only the starting price of the bid, not a fixed price!

“Oh my!” Seeing this, Lin Xiu’s jaw dropped, that cheap master of his had given him a big gift!

Shocked, Lin Xiu clicked on the combat uniform at the side.

The Path of Death was dangerous and he had to prepare a combat uniform.

On closer inspection, expensive combat uniforms could go up as high as hundreds of millions of union coins, and Lin Xiu simply couldn’t afford these now.

He simply bought a ‘Black Wing’ two-piece set; the combat uniform came with a matching backpack and this backpack has a special design that wouldn’t get in his way when he’s fighting

“Three million union coins… It really hurts…”

Lin Xiu thought about it and still clicked on the payment. In a short moment, the prompt of a successful deduction appeared.

“The goods are expected to be delivered to you in 30 minutes.”

As soon as the payment was made, Lin Xiu heard this prompt.

Sure enough, after waiting less than thirty minutes in the café, he saw a man in a Warrior Union uniform walking over with a large wooden box.

“May I know if this is Mr. Lin Xiu, please?”

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu nodded, then handed the Warrior Card for verification and signed off.

Lin Xiu looked at the big box and sighed with emotion – the express courier service in this future world was simply too fast.

It used to take at least a few hours for something to arrive even when the location was nearby.

After tearing open the box, it was indeed a black combat suit and a black backpack.

Lin Xiu tried it on and sure enough, the suit fitted very well. Also, it felt very soft, but Lin Xiu knew that even a rank 3 evolved beast couldn’t tear this uniform.

With the backpack on his back, Lin Xiu felt more and more comfortable, and it seemed that the union coins didn’t go to waste.

Lin Xiu thought for a moment and began to walk out of the coffee shop.

It was already nighttime and the area here wasn’t bustling, there were also very few people around.

He’d better spend the night at the same Warrior Hotel.

Although it was slightly expensive, it was more comfortable after all.

Just as Lin Xiu reached the corner in front, he stopped all of a sudden, then looked back and said to the seemingly empty street, “You’ve followed me for so long, aren’t you tired?” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

That’s right, from the beginning, Lin Xiu sensed that something was wrong so he deliberately walked this way.

It seemed that someone had come to give him some experience again.

“Tsk tsk, you actually found out.” At this moment, several men in black appeared from all directions, exuding a thick, murderous aura from their bodies.

Many people had lost their lives at the hands of these men in black, otherwise, it was impossible for them to exude such a strong murderous aura.

“From the Temple of Transformation?” Lin Xiu asked instinctively.

When the two men were killed this morning, one of the men mentioned this and Lin Xiu remembered it.

Also, when he entered the Warrior Union’s website, Lin Xiu checked and found that this so-called ‘Temple of Transformation’ was like a militant organization, the people inside kill without blinking.

The federal government offered a 100 million bounty for their leader.

“Glad you know that, get ready… to go to hell!” The moment the man in black in front said that, he rushed over to attack Lin Xiu!

And the men in black behind also followed closely. As they rushed over, they pulled out the sabers from their backs.

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted and before they rushed over, he charged over directly!

He activated the Analytic Eye and the man in black in front was a rank 3 warrior while the rest were rank 2 warriors.

Not a threat at all!
