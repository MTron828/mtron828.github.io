1175 Killing a God Warrior

This kid actually fooled him!

This kid, from the very beginning, pretended to obey him.

With this thought, Ye Yu’s face became extremely ugly.

“certainly.”

!!

At this moment, Zhao Laosan said in a sinister tone.

Lin Xiu showed a sneer at this time.

He didn’t make a move previously because he was worried but now he could let go and fight.

Lin Xiu swung the Dark Edge spear in both hands and at this moment, dark blue flaming birds charged directly at Ye Yu and Zhao Laosan!

“Playing small tricks!”

Looking at these flaming birds rushing over, Zhao Laosan roared angrily and suddenly a purple light burst out from his body.

Taking a closer look, you can clearly see that he has unfolded a ‘Sphere’ that emits purple light!

His ‘Sphere’ was different from the ordinary ‘Sphere’. The outer layer actually had a layer of frost and white smoke.

When Lin Xiu’s flaming bird hit his ‘Sphere’, it disappeared at a speed visible to the naked eye!

Seeing this scene, the pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes could not help but shrink.

This Zhao Laosan, actually possesses such pure frost power.

His hellfire didn’t have any effect on him!

“Die!”

At this time, Ye Yu had already rushed over from the other side.

Instantly appeared behind Lin Xiu.

The golden long sword in his hand slashed directly at Lin Xiu!

Dang–

But Lin Xiu’s reaction speed was not slow at all.

The right hand holding the Dark Edge spear moved back and blocked Ye Yu’s blow directly.

Ye Yu’s eyes were full of infinite killing intent. At this time, he continued to hold the golden long sword in his hand and continued to attack Lin Xiu frantically.

Dangdang-

A sound caused by the collision of the weapons kept ringing.

The golden long sword in his hand burst out with extremely terrifying sword aura.

Lin Xiu, who was fighting with Ye Yu, was affected by the terrifying sword aura and the backs of his hands began to tear apart.

Lin Xiu’s brows wrinkled. Although there was a tingling sensation, it was nothing to Lin Xiu.

With Lin Xiu’s current strong recovery ability, those wounds caused by the sword aura recovered at a speed visible to the naked eye.

‘Wiping Out the Heavens’!!!

Ye Yu couldn’t wait to kill Lin Xiu at this time.

His whole body’s source strength was concentrated on the golden long sword and in an instant, the entire long sword burst into golden light.

A hole opened in the surrounding space with the stroke of his long sword!

Lin Xiu watched this scene and the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

boom–

In the next moment, this sword directly cut Lin Xiu’s body in half!

“Here!”

But Ye Yu clearly knew that Lin Xiu, who was cut in half, was not the real Lin Xiu.

His thoughts have already covered the surrounding area.

At this time, he turned around and slashed!

A substantial sword aura slashed directly at the back.

The figure of Lin Xiu who appeared behind was instantly cut in half.

boom–

But just like before, Lin Xiu, who was cut in half, immediately dissipated like smoke.

It’s fake again!

“Damn!”

Zhao Laosan was on the other side at this time, cutting Lin Xiu’s body in half.

And found out that this Lin Xiu was also fake.

Just as the two of them were looking for Lin Xiu’s figure, a burning smell came over.

crackling-

They had very good hearing and at this time, they clearly heard a strange sound.

on top!

At this time, they all looked up at the same time.

Taking a closer look, it was Lin Xiu.

And at this moment, a path of incomparably terrifying electric current rushed down from above!

The incomparably terrifying electric current seemed to scorch the air and there was a burning smell.

Ye Yu and Zhao Laosan’s expressions changed slightly.

The range of these lightning strikes was so wide that there was no way to dodge them.

The two of them had no choice. At this time, they could only use their ‘Sphere’ to resist.

The other God warrior-level warriors in Luanxuan Palace below, just got up and saw these terrifying lightning strikes, their faces changed greatly.

They also unfolded their ‘Sphere’ to resist.

bang bang bang-

The terrifying lightning struck their ‘Sphere’ and a loud noise erupted. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Lin Xiu looked at the people who were resisting the lightning power he released and after a little thought, he attacked Ye Yu directly!

“Courting death!”

Ye Yu, who was resisting the power of lightning, immediately roared when he saw Lin Xiu who appeared in front of him in an instant.

Lin Xiu ignored his words and the Dark Edge spear in his hand attacked frantically.

‘Profound Intent·Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

The moment the Dark Edge spear pierced out, it suddenly turned into thousands of attacks.

They all stabbed in his ‘Sphere’!

The incomparably powerful impact made Ye Yu’s ‘Sphere’ vibrate constantly.

“kill him!!!”

Ye Yu felt an extremely strong pressure coming. At this time, while frantically using his source strength to reinforce his ‘Sphere’ as he shouted loudly at the warriors not far away.

Those warriors from Luanxuan Palace, while blocking those lightning powers, looked at the back.

“Help the young master kill that kid!”

At this time, their whole body’s strength also burst out.

Attacking Lin Xiu from behind!

Lin Xiu frantically waved the spear in his hand and attacked Ye Yu in front of him. Out of the corner of his eye, he also saw those warriors rushing over from behind.

These warriors of Luanxuan Palace were also of the God warrior level.

Lin Xiu didn’t dare to be careless.

“Get lost!”

At this time, Lin Xiu directly stabbed a powerful shot, sending Ye Yu, who was unfolding a Sphere, flying to the far side.

He turned around and attacked the warriors who wanted to surround him from behind!

‘Clean Sweep’!

With a single stroke of the spear, an incomparably powerful force was released.

The bodies of these rushing warriors were directly knocked out by the powerful force!

Originally, he wanted to save a chance to use the ‘Fury’ skill.

But now it seems that it has to be used.

Lin Xiu didn’t hesitate any more. After activating the ‘Fury’ skill, his body’s strength instantly increased to the extreme.

‘Heaven Breaking Strike’!

Those warriors who were hit by his skills and flew out had not even regained their balance when Lin Xiu’s next blow came again!

At this time, with the volley of the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand, a huge arc-shaped white light burst out and charged towards them.

This incomparably powerful skill has caused a large number of space cracks to appear in the entire space!
