Chapter 663: All Of You Are Dead!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Since Lin Xiu was just a nobody that had no major background support.

He may be champion of the world warrior’s championship, so what?

With the drones dropping bombs on him from behind, Lin Xiu was still moving around as if there were eyes behind his head. As he leaped into the air, his entire body floated around.

Koong Loong – – Koong Loong – –

The bombs landed onto the ground and let out huge explosions.

The warriors who were still on the ground were immediately blown away by these explosives.

Lin Xiu waved his spear as he was in the air and aimed it towards the drones, there was a bright, white light that came out of his spear.

Koong Loong – – Koong Loong – –

With the bright light that was released, the drones were all destroyed!

As he got onto the ground, Lin Xiu started runing again.

Then, there was a figure that appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

“Pass her to me.”

It was a middle-aged man that spoke to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu’s eyes were now filled with anger. He wanted to continue his attack with the spear in his hand.

Anyone who dared to stop him would have to die.

“Tam her father.”

The man continued walking towards Lin Xiu. With the moonlight shining on him, Lin Xiu could clearly see that this man looked similar to Luo Yue.

“Allow father to bring her to safety. Even if you bring her to the Sky City hospital, it’s useless. It belongs to the four major families.”

Luo Yan dodged the attack from Nan Huang’s grandfather and jumped next to Lin Xiu before telling him.

She seemed to be injured from fighting Nan Huang’s grandfather as her arms were already covered in blood.

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue once again. The girl in his arms had already closed her eyes. She looked as if she had already passed out.

The blood on her clothes have already imprinted onto his own.

Her body vitals were dropping tremendously.

‘When he saw what was happening, Lin Xiu’s body started shaking.

No... No.... This can’t be happening.....”

“Lin Xiu, calm down.”

Luo Yan noticed that something wasn’t right with Lin Xiu and she quickly reminded him.

After hearing what Luo Yan said, Lin Xiu came back to his senses and saw Luo Yue’s father who was now right in front of him.

“Pass her over to me. She will be fine.”

Luo Yue’s father said once again.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and passed Luo Yue over to her father.

“Luo Zheng, I can’t believe you’re here as well.”

When Nan Huang’s grandfather noticed who it was, he called him out in a cold tone.

Luo Zheng glared at Nan Huang’s grandfather and did not say a word as he left in the other direction.

“Since you’re here now, you should stay here forever!”

The Luo family may not be one of the richest families in Sky City but these few years, their family has been growing stronger. They were so strong that it started to threaten the big four.

The big four already had plans on destroying the Luo family.

“Don’t you dare!”

Luo Yan saw how Nan Huang’s grandfather was going after her father. She quickly took out her sword to stop him!

Luo Zhen held Luo Yue in his arms. He tured around and within a blink of an eye, he disappeared.

“Damn it!”

‘When the elders from the Jiang and Zhuo family noticed that Luo Zhen disappeared, the look in their eyes changed.

They wanted to kill off Luo Zheng but he was moving too quickly. They could no longer catch up with him since they were already injured.

“The next one would be the both of you.”

But then, Lin Xiu’s body had already appeared right in front of him.

Lin Xiu’s body was still glowing brightly. With the black spear in his arm, Lin Xiu looked like a god that had descended onto earth.

The warriors hidden around the buildings pointed their guns towards Lin Xiu. Just as they were about to pull the trigger, Lin Xiu lifted up his spear and swung it in the air without even looking back. A long, bright glow flew out from his spear.

Xiu xiu xiu–

As the bright light came towards them, it was so quick that most of them did not have the time to react. Before they knew what was happening, the light had already cut their heads into two.

How did this fella’s strength become so strong suddenly?!

“All of you should die.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

The eyes that were looking at them were filled with hate.

They were the reason why Luo Yue was injured.

Now, he wouldn’t know if she would be alive.

As he thought about it, Lin Xiu got even more angry.

At that moment, ‘Rage’ was about to disappear. The withdrawal of the skill was about to happen which was why he could feel his body becoming weaker. However, he noticed that there was a strong force that was coming from within!

This time, it wasn’t a skill of the system. It was the energy source that was inside the glass ball that he found inside the Tower of Trials. It was the energy that was left behind by the ancestors on earth.

This energy has been deeply buried inside of Lin Xiu’s body and has never appeared but with Lin Xiu being furious, it started becoming active inside Lin Xiu’s body.

As the energy flowed through Lin Xiu’s entire body, the bright glow around him continued.

The strength was not only because of ‘Rage’. He only felt weak for a few seconds and it was soon replaced with a strong surge of energy.

The elders of the Jiang and Zhuo family looked at each other and attacked Lin Xiu together at the same time!

Clang clang clang —

Lin Xiu turned the spear in his arm, ready to fight them. As their weapons collided, there were sparks everywhere.

He wasn’t using any warrior skills. These were all the basic spear skills but Lin Xiu was already skilled in it.

Boom ——

As the elder from the Zhuo family touched Lin Xiu’s spear with his sword, he could feel a sharp pain travelling up his arm. The sword in his hand immediately flew out of his grasp!

How is this even possible?!

He widened his eyes. He couldn’t believe what was happening.

He was a rank 9 warrior! How did his weapon get thrown out so easily?!

This was an insult.

He didn’t have time to think. This was because Lin Xiu’s spear was already heading towards him.

“Yuan!”

The spear was coming at him quickly. Without any hesitation, he screamed.

As he shouted, his entire body was covered by a protective shield.

Lin Xiu did not stop and aimed his spear towards the old man’s ‘Yuan’!

The Dark Edge was now covered with a dark red hue and there were hundreds of its figures aiming towards the old man’s ‘Yuan’!
