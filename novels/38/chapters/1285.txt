1286 Paper Tiger

As Sun Tian roared in rage, he quickly moved and disappeared

Boom – –

Then, his fist appeared right in front of Lin Xiu.

It was aimed toward Lin Xiu’s head!

!!

When he saw what happened, Lin Xiu did not seem frightened at all. He instantly returned a punch as well!

Boom – –

As both fists collided, there was an incredibly loud sound that came from it.

Lin Xiu took a few steps backwards and when Sun Tian’s figure appeared once again, he was already far away from Lin Xiu.

Zhao Lin had quick reflexes as well and quickly rushed forward to catch Sun Tian.

Pfft – –

Sun Tian instantly spat out a mouthful of blood as soon as he was caught.

His eyes were opened wide. As he stared at his fist that was now covered in blood, his eyes were filled with disbelief.

How is this possible?! How was it that this brat had such a powerful fist?!

Sun Tian was someone who had expertise in fist technique. From his point of view, Lin Xiu was someone who only knew the spear technique. Why was it possible for Lin Xiu to give out such a powerful punch?

“This is interesting.”

At this point, Lin Xiu looked at Sun Tian as an interested smile appeared on his face.

Although Lin Xiu was also affected by the impact, he didn’t suffer any damage.

As for how Sun Tian had been provoking him, Lin Xiu finally felt that this was getting interesting.

Previously, while Lin Xiu had been practising with his fist, he never got to fight with any warrior gods.

Now, he was given the chance to do so.

“Lin Xiu, do you want me to kill him?”

Baili Haoling held onto her daggers and started feeling excited as well.

“It’s alright. You can practise aside. I feel like using him to get warmed up.”

Seeing how Baili Haoling would jump at any opportunity to fight others, the corner of his lips twitched before rolling his eyes.

“Damn it…”

Sun Tian overheard the conversation between Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling and he looked evermore pissed.

This fella was using him as warm up?!

That….that was unacceptable!

“Sun Tian, forget it.”

Seeing how angry he was, Zhao Lin tried to stop him.

From the short collision earlier, he could feel that Lin Xiu was someone who was incredibly powerful.

He definitely wasn’t as weak as how he looked.

Instead, he was incredibly powerful!

“It’s none of your business.”

Sun Tian was now infuriated as he spoke to Zhao Lin and his eyes were fixed on Lin Xiu.

“You brat! Come over here so that I can spank your ass!”

Sun Tian roared angrily and started releasing one of his skills before attacking Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu left the Hao Yue Spear on the ground and waited for Sun Tian.

“Meteorite Fist!!!!”

Sun Tian saw how Lin Xiu was ready for a fight and it pissed him even more.

He no longer cared about the injuries on his fist and raised both of them into the air.

Both were aimed at Lin Xiu!

This was a saint warrior skills card and as both his fists were raised above his head. There were a thousand fists that instantly appeared in the air!

It was so quick that Lin Xiu had no other choice but to defend himself first.

He placed both arms across his chest and he managed to stop all of Sun Tian’s attacks

.

Boom boom boom – –

As the punches landed on Lin Xiu’s arms, there were loud, blasting sounds.

Sun Tian’s face turned pale.

This was because he was using a saint warrior skill and each of them were filled with energy.

However, how was it that Lin Xiu’s arms were able to stop his attacks?!

Strictly speaking, even if Lin Xiu’s hands were covered in energy, they must have been severely injured by now!

However, Sun Tian had no time to think. After his turn, Lin Xiu would be attacking next.

Sizzling – –

...

Lin Xiu’s punches were filled with horrifying currents.

There was a toasted smell that appeared in the air.

This was the modified ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’!

Lin Xiu had been experimenting on fist technique. The ones that he was using now were much more powerful than the ones that he had before.

Lin Xiu immediately used ‘Flashing Souls’ and his body disappeared into thin air.

Where did he go?!

Sun Tian narrowed his eyes.

Before he could react, he saw a huge fist covered with currant that appeared before his eyes.

“You…..” ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Sun Tian’s pupil constricted uncontrollably. He wanted to hide but his body couldn’t keep up with it.

Boom – –

...

The punch landed straight on Sun Tian’s face.

The horrifying force along with the frightening currents! It almost blasted Sun Tian’s head!

Sun Tian’s body flew into the distance from the impact and his skin turned black from being burnt. There was also a large amount of blood that came flowing out of his mouth.

This time, Sun Tiao was indeed frightened.

If it wasn’t because he gathered enough source energy over his head to protect himself, that punch itself was enough to break his head.

However, Lin Xiu did not stop and was about to attack Sun Tian again!

“Sun Tian!”

Seeing how Sun Tian was in such bad shape, Zhao Lin wanted to step forward to help.

“How dare you?”

However, there was a sharp cold gaze that shot from the side.

Zhan Lin subconsciously took a few steps backwards.

At the same time, he felt a sharp pain coming from his neck.

He subconsciously touched it and noticed that there was blood!

At that instant, he almost lost his head!

Seeing how there was a young girl standing right in front of him, he suddenly felt frightened. His face had turned completely pale.

“Don’t move or I’ll chop your head off!”

Baili Haoling glared at Zhao Lin as she let out a cold smile.

Boom boom boom – –

As for Lin Xiu, he was still fighting Sun Tian with his fist.

Sun Tian’s condition was beyond words.

After suffering a few more punches from Lin Xiu, not only did he feel as if all the bones in his body have been crushed into pieces; the horrible currents have burned his skin so badly that they have all turned black.

All of his hair stood on their ends and he looked horrible.

Pfft – –

Then, at the end, Sun Tian took the last punch from Lin Xiu and he spat a mouthful of blood before falling onto the ground.

“That’s all you’ve got?”

Lin Xiu stared at him as he was a little disappointed.

He was thinking that there may be a chance for him to have a good fight but he didn’t think that Sun Tian was nothing but a paper tiger.

This made Lin Xiu feel a little helpless.

“I….I surrender…..”

Sun Tian spoke these words with the energy that he had left.

He had regretted everything!

Lin Xiu’s abilities were different from how he looked!
