Chapter 675: Arrival

Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

“It’s nothing, just that after what happened tonight, I think we have to be careful when we get to Marqi Planet.”

Lei Tong wiped the wine from his lips and said seriously.

“What do you mean?”

Lin Xiu said.

“The Skeleton thieves is a very large gang. What we met tonight is only a small part of them. This time we have killed so many people. If their people know about it, they will definitely hunt us down.” Lei Tong said this, and his face became serious.

“We’ll adopt measures appropriate to the actual situation so there’s nothing to worry about.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

“Come on, let’s go.”

Lei Tong also smiled at this time. Indeed, life and death are ruled by fate. Today, if it wasn’t for these people who died, he would probably be the one dead.”

Lin Xiu smiled, the wine bottle he was holding clinked with the wine bottle in Lei Tong’s hand, and the two men, each with their own thoughts, started drinking again.

“Brother Lin… What are you going to do on this Margi planet…”

Lei Tong seemed to be a little drunk at this time, and his speech became slurry.

He was still very curious, what exactly was going on for a powerful warrior like Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu didn’t look like someone who wanted to make money…

“Bind someone, find someone who is very important to me.”

Lin Xiu replied plainly. Lin Xiu, who was not used to drinking, also started to get drunk at this time. It was just his powerful source strength that suppressed the drunkenness.

Time passed quickly, and Lin Xiu, who fell asleep, suddenly felt that the entire spaceship shook violently.

Lin Xiu immediately opened his eyes.

Looking at the transparent window next to him, he found that the spaceship seemed to be passing through the atmosphere, and was about to prepare to descend!

“We’ve arrived!?”

‘When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he suddenly became energetic.

“What arrived…”

Lei Tong slept on the chair on the other side, yawned at this time, and said a little dazedly.

Lin Xiu ignored Lei Tong who was in a daze, stood up from the chair, and walked to his room.

There was nothing else in the room, only the Dark Edge spear that he had placed over there.

Holding his Dark Edge spear, Lin Xiu subconsciously reached out and touched the body of it.

Compared to the spear he used yesterday, the Dark Edge spear was undoubtedly about ten times heavier, but Lin Xiu felt more comfortable when he held it in his hand.

Margi Planet, we’re arriving.

“Everyone, we have arrived at the Margie planet, and the landing is about to begin. Please be prepared!”

The voice of a pilot in the cab was transmitted to every corner of the spacecraft through a special device.

We’re really here.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, and Luo Yue’s face flashed across his mind.

After a while, a relatively strong tremor came from the spacecraft again.

‘When Lin Xiu walked out of the central hall, there were already many warriors standing there waiting.

Boom boom boom —

“We have reached our destination, everyone can go down.”

‘An older pilot came out of the control room at this time and said to everyone.

‘As soon as he finished speaking, the door of the spaceship slowly opened.

Holding the long spear in his hand, Lin Xiu walked over there, and a dazzling sunlight hit him.

We have finally arrived…

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes. As soon as he walked down to take a look, he found that the surroundings were deserted.

En?

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but frown slightly. How could the spaceship descend to such a place? Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

At this time, many warriors also began to get off one after another.

Taking a closer look, the place where they were now seemed to be a desert. In the back, there was a relatively large factory with a small building around, and there was no other place.

“This Margi planet, isn’t a primitive planet, is it?”

‘When some warriors saw this scene, they couldn’t help but complain.

After all, compared with the bustling Sky City, the contrast of all this was really too great.

“No, the Margi planet is still very prosperous, but the empire on our side has discussed about this and we can only stop here.”

The pilots came out and said aloud.

“By the way, I forgot to remind you all that there is almost no danger in this desert, but there is a great possibility of encountering danger outside of this desert.”

The older pilot said in a deep voice at this time.

‘When these warriors heard his words, they immediately disagreed. Now that they saw this scene, they already felt that this was just an indigenous planet. What sort of powerful existence could there be?

At most, the rank 9 evolved beasts seen in the video.

And they will not provoke that kind of existence.

“If we want to leave, do we come here to take a spaceship?”

Aman asked the older pilot at this time.

“Yes, but we have to stay here for at least a week before we can leave. You have also seen that the hull of the spacecraft has been damaged.”

He pointed to the spaceship and said aloud.

“However, on this route, apart from our staff, no one is currently going back.”

He still said in a deep voice.

“Why?”

Aman frowned and said.

“I don’t know, maybe people have already died, who knows.”

He said meaningfully.

“Humph!”

When the man heard the driver’s words, he snorted in dissatisfaction.

“Brother Lin, why did you come down so quickly?”

At this time, Lei Tong also got off the spaceship.

Just a few steps down, his expression changed slightly.

“Why do I feel so heavy? Could it be that I haven’t sobered up after drinking too much…”

He muttered to himself.

“No, it’s the gravity here is different from ours on Earth.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

“It should be about three times the gravity of the earth.”

Because he had done too much gravity training in the gravity room, he didn’t feel it just now, but now he felt it carefully and found that the gravity here was different from that of the earth.

“This brother is amazing. The gravity of this Marqi planet is indeed about three times that of the earth.”

The older pilot gave Lin Xiu a thumbs up and said.

“No wonder…” Lei Tong also suddenly realized at this time.

After all, he was also a high-level warrior, and soon, he began to adapt.

But in general, on this planet, one’s strength should be a little weaker.

“The people on the Margi planet are all used to this kind of gravity, even those evolved beasts. Therefore, the warriors and evolved beasts here are generally stronger than ours on Earth.”

The older pilot continued speaking.

“This brother, the people of this Margo planet, are not very kind to us people on Earth. If you want to leave this desert, you have to be more careful.”
