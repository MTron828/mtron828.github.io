Chapter 515: On Your Knees!

Pfft – –

The warriors could clearly hear them and when they heard what Luo Yue said, they almost spat out the alcohol in their mouth.

This beauty was willing to share a room with him?!

As they thought about it, most of them were enraged.

“Alright. The total would be 1200 warrior coins.” The receptionist quickly made the arrangements.

“This beautiful girl, would I have the honours to get to know you?” At that moment, there was a man that walked towards them and stopped right in front of Lin Xiu and Luo Yue who was about to leave.

His eyes were locked onto Luo Yue and had totally ignored Lin Xiu who was right next to her.

“This is the young master of the Chen family.” One of the warriors said as he looked at the handsome young man who was well dressed.

As for the rest of them, they turned towards Young Master Chen as well when they heard what the warrior said.

With the power and status of the Chen family in Bai Di City, it should be easy for him to get any girl that he wanted but this young man seemed like a well-mannered man as well. It does show that he was someone experienced.

“I am Chen Yang from the Chen family.” Chen Yang introduced himself.

He was helping a friend from another city with the check-in process and saw Luo Yue who was next to me.

When his eyes landed on her, he couldn’t look elsewhere.

Luo Yue might look cold and distant but her beauty was absolutely stunning.

He has bever seen such a beautiful woman.

“Move.” Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

When Chen Yang was waiting for an introduction from her as well even if she didn’t like him since he had already introduced himself with his handsome face but all he got was a cold answer.

Move?

Everyone else in the room was shocked as well.

This cold woman….told him to move?

“Beautiful lady, I don’t think that that’s very nice of you. Don’t you think so?” Chen Yang was a pure gentleman a while ago when he introduced himself but when he got such insulting answers from Luo Yue, the expression on his face changed as well.

“Get out of the way.” Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and told Chen Yang.

This bastard has been ignoring him and was trying to flirt with Luo Yue right in front of his eyes which made him mad.

“Rubbish, shut up!” When Chen Yang heard Lin Xiu, he glared at Lin Xiu and sneered.

“Tsktsk…..that fella has decided to fight Chen Yang for that woman. He’s doomed.” Some of the warriors looked at them as if they were an interesting skit.

Chen Yang was the eldest amongst the descendants of the Chen family and was considered one of the most powerful persons in Bai Di City. Lin Xiu was just a young nobody. It would be extremely easy to get rid of him.

“Get on your knees and apologise.” Lin Xiu said bluntly.

“Go the hell!” When he heard what Lin Xiu said, Chen Yang was fuming bad. This teenager had the balls to talk to him in such a manner?!

He has no idea what was about to hit him!

Chen Yang was furious and immediately threw a punch towards Lin Xiu!

“On your knees!”

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth as he said it with eyes filled with a murderous look.

Chen Yang, who was about to throw the punch, suddenly turned ghastly pale. His knees turned weak and immediately knelt on the ground.

The men around who were watching them in interest suddenly felt chills running down their spine when they heard Lin Xiu’s command.

“Chen Yang…”

When they took a closer look at them, Chen Yang was indeed kneeling on the ground.

“Chen Yang, what’s the matter?” Then, there was a group of men that walked into the scene and were shocked to find Chen Yang who was on the ground.

“Let’s go.” Lin Xiu didn’t bother talking to these men and spoke to Luo Yue instead.

Luo Yue nodded her head and toned down her impulses to kill the man before her.

It would have contaminated her hands just to kill men like them.

“Wait a minute. What were you trying to do?” As they were about to leave, there was a huge, muscular man that stopped the both of them.

“Jin Yuan….he…..he hit me…” Chen Yang lifted his head and said to his friend.

He looked extremely pale. When Lin Xiu looked at him a while ago, he could feel the terrifying vibe from Lin Xiu and because of that, he suddenly felt weak and fell onto the ground.

“Chen Yang is my brother! How dare you!” Jin Yuan screamed at Lin Xiu in an unfriendly manner and there was an evil look in his eyes as well.

There was also a group of men who stood behind Jin Yuan that was protecting him.

These men were much stronger than Jin Yuan.

“Interesting. You’re still interested in these things?” Lin Xiu said while trying to suppress his anger.

“Kneel and bow down, beg for mercy. As for this woman, you shall be with us for a few days while we are in Bai Di City and we shall call this even.” Jin Yuan said to Lin Xiu.

His words were filled with arrogance and he was acting as if he was in control of the scene, giving out commands.

Chen Yang was still weak but as he looked at Lin Xiu, his eyes were filled with hatred.

“The Jin family?!”

“Oh! Right! The Chen family and Jin family are actually related. The Jin family would always come for a visit each year.”

Some of the warriors around started gossiping about it.

“Alright, bow down then.” Lin Xiu said towards Jin Yuan.

Jin Yuan was stunned when he laughed out loud, “Do you know who you’re talking to?!”

Jin Yuan has never seen such an arrogant man. He swung his arm and threw a punch to Lin Xiu’s head!

The fist was moving at an extremely scary speed as if it broke through the air around it.

Boom – –

Right at the next moment, Lin Xiu raised his right hand and caught Jin Yuan’s fist!

“That’s it?” Lin Xiu raised his brows and asked.

“You…” Jing Yuan was in shock. He was a rank 4 warrior, one of the best in the entire Jin family. He has been specialising in these punches and this one punch could have destroyed Lin Xiu, the ant who has no idea who he was messing with but instead, Lin Xiu easily caught his fist!

“You’ve overestimated your abilities.” Lin Xiu could obviously feel that Jin Yuan was struggling to set himself free but with Lin Xiu’s gentle force, there was a loud, cracking sound that came from the fist.

Crack Crack – –

“AHHHHHHHH!!!!” Jin Yuan screamed in pain. He could clearly feel that the bones in his fist had been broken into ash!

“Move!” Lin Xiu snorted and kicked him out of the way.

“Young Master!” The bodyguards who were portecing Jin Yuan from afar obviously had no idea that Lin Xiu would be such a powerful young man.

By the time they realised that, they had on other choice but to catch Jin Yuan who was already in the air.

Chen Yang widened his eyes in shock as he couldn’t believe what he just saw. This was a young seventeen year old boy who was able to throw Jin Yuan so far away when he was a rank 4 warrior?!

“This…”

As for the rest of the warriors who stayed to watch the scene, they did not expect for the events to happen in this manner.

“Kill him!!!!” Jin Yuan roared from a distance. All of the bones in his right hand have been crushed into pieces and his entire palm was just a bloody mess!
