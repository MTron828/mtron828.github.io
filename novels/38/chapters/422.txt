Chapter 423: Stealing the Electricity

Lin Xiu quickly came to his senses and held his breath. He looked over to the other side and saw two of the staff that were wearing the customized uniforms walking towards them.

But soon, both the staff walked past them and Ouyang Hang let out a breath of relief.

“Let’s go!” Ouyang Hang lowered his voice and said towards Lin Xiu. Both of them walked forward cautiously, trying to avoid touching the trees around them.

Lin Xiu nodded his head. It shouldn’t be too difficult for them to walk without making any noise with both of their abilities.

As for the staff that has just walked past them, their abilities seemed average which is why he had assumed that they were technicians.

After walking past that region and as they looked towards the far distance, they could clearly note the huge, oval-shaped building that was near them. There were lots of lights that were coming from the building.

“I really don’t understand why you wanted me to bring you to the power station of the Sacred Region University.” As they got to the safe zone, Ouyang Hang pouted and said towards Lin Xiu.

That’s right. Lin Xiu’s only request was for Ouyang Hang to help him find the power station of the Sacred Region Academy.

As Lin Xiu looked at the huge building that was right before him, the corner of his lips twitched upwards.

When Ouyang Hang saw Lin Xiu’s smile, he couldn’t help but feel that Lin Xiu was up to something.

“Are you trying to ruin the entire power station?” Ouyang Hang thought about it before asking Lin Xiu.

“Are you stupid?” Lin Xiu looked at him as if an idiot had asked that question.

“You’re the stupid one!” After hearing Lin Xiu’s question, Ouyang Hang got so angry that his entire night turned red.

He was the Young Master of the Ouyang family. How dare anyone call him an idiot?

If it wasn’t because he wasn’t as strong as Lin Xiu, he would have fought Lin Xiu.

“Come on. Let’s go.” Lin Xiu didn’t say much to it before telling him to continue.

“What! If we get any closer, we will be caught!” Ouyang Hang suddenly felt nervous.

If they were caught by any of the staff from the Sacred Region Academy, they would never be able to prove themselves innocent.

They would definitely assume that both of them were up to something.

“Are you coming or not?” Lin Xiu looked at him and asked.

“No way.” Ouyang Hang quickly shook his head.

“If you’re not coming, I’ll tell the staff that you’re the one who brought me here.” Lin Xiu said as he continued walking forward.

“You…”

When he heard what Lin Xiu said, Ouyang Hang was so angry that he almost lost his life.

Unreasonable! This man was being completely unreasonable! He was the one who wanted me to bring him here!

“Fine! I’m coming!” As he glared at Lin Xiu, Ouyang Hang quickly followed behind him.

As they got closer, Lin Xiu became cautious as well. He looked everywhere before heading over and could easily find areas that were blindspots for the security cameras.

“Have you been a thief previously? How do you know about all of these blindspots??” As he looked at Lin Xiu, Ouyang Hang was shocked and he couldn’t help but comment.

“Hey, I’m telling you not to go there! It’s dangerous.”

“Can you hear me? Don’t you get me in trouble…”

Lin Xiu felt a little annoyed seeing how Ouyang Hang was being extremely talkative as he kept talking nonstop.

He hadn’t noticed before this but Ouyang Hang turned out to be someone who talks non-stop. Lin Xiu almost wanted to stuff socks in his mouth.

“Shut up!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were still focused in front and they were now extremely close to the building.

As he looked at the tall building that was standing right before him, Lin Xiu’s eyes narrowed uncontrollably.

“If I was right about it, it should be on this side.” Lin Xiu continued looking at the ground. Then, when he found a rectangular cover on the ground, he reached out for it and pulled it hard, lifting up the entire metal cover.

“What are you doing?!” Ouyang Hang was shocked because of what Lin Xiu was doing.

What was he trying to do?!

As the cover got removed, Lin Xiu looked down and was able to clearly see that there were lots of peculiar-looking, transparent tubes underneath them. Inside these transparent tubes, he could clearly see the horrifying current that was traveling continuously.

The tube in the middle was the thickest, it was as thick as a human’s waist. As it was a transparent tube, Ouyang Hang could clearly see the horrifying current that was running within it.

“The main tube that supplies electricity?” Ouyang Hang silently gulped a mouthful of saliva when he saw the scene in front of him.

Seeing how the current was running so vigorously beneath them, Ouyang Hang couldn’t help but shiver.

If he got electrocuted by it, his entire body would have been a toasted corpse.

“Finally…” Lin Xiu smiled and immediately jumped downwards, landing on top of the tube.

“Do you have a death wish?!” Seeing how Lin Xiu was acting so boldly, Ouyang Hang took a deep breath as he was shocked.

If the tube breaks, it would definitely kill him with such a huge current.

“Go over there and help me distract the staff. Get them to the other side.” Lin Xiu reached for his pocket and took something out of it before handing it over to Ouyang Hang.

Ouyang Hang subconsciously caught the things that Lin Xiu threw in his direction and noticed that it was a small silver ball.

When he realized what it was, Ouyang Hang was stunned. He immediately knew what it was as he took a closer look and the look in his eyes changed. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Flame bomb, C14 compression bomb. You want me to destroy the power station?” As he stared at the small silver ball in his hands that was like an explosive, Ouyang Hang was shocked as he screamed at Lin Xiu.

“Of course not. I don’t want to be a fugitive from the Sacred Region Academy.” Lin Xiu raised his hands helplessly.

Although there was a horrifying, high-pressure current running below him, Lin Xiu wasn’t feeling afraid or nervous.

“But you…”

“At the 7 o’clock direction, I just saw that there are a lot of dry woods there. Use the flame bomb and start a fire over there and with the help of the C14 compression bomb, ignite it in the 4 o’clock direction. Attract them in both directions.” Lin Xiu said to him in a serious tone.

“You have to tell me what on earth are you trying to do?!” Ouyang Hang was completely lost as he had no idea what Lin Xiu was trying to do.

Lin Xiu looked around and then stared at the current that was flowing through the thick pipe below him and said with a stern look on his face, “I want the electricity.”
