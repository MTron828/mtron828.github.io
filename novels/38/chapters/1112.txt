Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

The source strength of Zhao Yongyong and Sima Qiang’s bodies subconsciously mobilized at this moment.

“it’s me.”

At this moment, a familiar voice came again.

“M… Master?”

Sima Qiang and Zhao Yongyuan were stunned for a moment, then said.

!!

This voice clearly came from the skeleton in front of them.

This is really strange.

“Well, something happened and I became like this.”

Lin Xiu said helplessly at this time.

He never thought that he would turn into a skeleton.

Although Zhao Yongyuan and Sima Qiang’s eyes were still full of shock.

But slowly they realized that this was really Lin Xiu.

“Okay, I’ll take care of the affairs outside.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

As Lin Xiu’s words fell, Lin Xiu, who turned into a skeleton, flew directly into the sky.

“This… is really the master?”

Zhao Yongyuan still kept his eyes wide open at this time.

“En, no doubt.”

Sima Qiang nodded affirmatively at this time.

Although he didn’t know why Lin Xiu suddenly turned into a skeleton, it was definitely Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu, who was flying into the air at this time, felt that although his body was destroyed, the source strength of his body was stored in every part of his bones.

He was still capable of bursting with great power!

“what is this!?”

One of the Sage warriors saw this group of golden light flying over and his eyes were full of shock.

“Go away!”

The Sage warrior watched this golden light rush towards his body and immediately roared, with a wave of his right hand, a terrifying skill directly slammed into it!

boom–

But his skill didn’t seem to have any effect.

Lin Xiu’s figure instantly appeared in front of him.

Sk… skeleton!?

Seeing the golden skeleton appearing in front of him, the warrior’s eyes were full of disbelief.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s thoughts were triggered and the Dark Edge spear appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand from the expansion space.

Holding the Dark Edge spear, he directly attacked the Sage warrior in front of him!

The pupils in Sage warrior’s eyes shrank slightly.

At this time, he subconsciously unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

boom–

Lin Xiu’s stab directly hit his ‘Sphere’.

clang-

With a sound like glass breaking.

The ‘Sphere’ he unfolded exploded at this moment!

This is impossible!

His eyes widened, looking at the scene in front of him in disbelief.

The ‘Sphere’ he unfolded was actually blown up by a skeleton with a weapon!

And as his ‘Sphere’ burst, blood spat out of his mouth.

‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

Whoosh whoosh—

At this moment, the spear turned into thousands of cold lights and continued to charge towards him! Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, a large number of holes appeared in the body of this Sage warrior.

A warrior at the Sage warrior level just died.

Everything happened in a flash.

The surrounding Sage warriors were going to attack the energy barrier of Baidi City, but at this time they all looked at Lin Xiu.

Seeing the scene in front of them, their eyes were filled with shock.

Skeleton, a golden skeleton.

This skeleton was holding a black spear and killed one of their Sage warriors!

“What the hell!”

Some Sage warriors watched the big scene and roared, holding their weapons in their hands and attacking Lin Xiu!

Hng!

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and as the source strength was transferred to the spear, the Dark Edge spear instantly turned into amethyst glass.

Dangdang-

The spear danced wildly, and collided with their weapons, bursting out sparks and loud noises.

The moment when Sage warrior and Lin Xiu fought, their expressions changed greatly.

They couldn’t believe it, why a skeleton could have such a mighty power.

But at this time, they had no time to think, because a large number of flaming birds burst out from Lin Xiu’s spear, sweeping toward them!

These Sage warriors clearly felt the extremely scorching temperature from the flaming birds and the expressions on their faces changed slightly at this time.

They instinctively unfolded their ‘Sphere’ to resist.

bang bang bang-

When the flaming birds hit their ‘Sphere’, they knew that there was no way to resist this flame!

Those terrifying flaming birds seemed to melt their ‘Sphere’!

“what!!!”

Some Sage warriors obviously couldn’t bear the terrifying flames and let out a wailing scream.

Their ‘Sphere’ was melted directly by the flame of the flaming birds!

After their ‘Sphere’ melted away, those flames directly burn their bodies.

Without the protection of the ‘Sphere’, these Sage warriors instantly fell like moths to the flames, one by one fell.

One, two, three…

In a short period of time, more than a dozen Sage warriors all died at the hands of Lin Xiu!

“What the hell are you!!!”

The remaining dozen powerful Sage warriors looked at the golden skeleton and roared aloud.

“Skeleton, can’t you see it?”

Lin Xiu, who was holding the Dark Edge spear, glanced at them at this time, then said lightly.

Lin Xiu was also a little helpless about turning into a skeleton.

But fortunately, the strength was still there.

“you…”

When the surrounding Sage warriors heard Lin Xiu’s words, their faces became extremely ugly.

They didn’t know how such a darn thing would suddenly appear. It was obviously a skeleton, yet it had such great power.

“You should be the only Sage warrior of the Bai Family in Baidi City.”

“That’s right. If I kill you guys, I should be able to level up.”

At this time, Lin Xiu said lightly.

Although these Sage warriors didn’t know what Lin Xiu meant by leveling up, it was obvious that Lin Xiu was going to attack them!

“Courting death!”

With a roar, they were about to release their domain force.

But when they just released their domain force, they found that it disappeared in an instant as a white light flashed.

The Sage warriors had no way to use their domain force at all!

They clearly felt all this and the expressions in their eyes changed greatly.

crackling-

But those Sage warriors responded quickly and used their source mark power.

A large amount of electricity, flames and other attribute powers all charged towards Lin Xiu!
