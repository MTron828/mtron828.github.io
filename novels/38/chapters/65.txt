Chapter 66: The Tiger of Xing Yao

“Lin Xiu, be careful. He is dangerous.” As Lin Xiu walked over, Yang Tian was already at the side of the stage.

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu nodded his head as he held the Silver Immortal Spear and walked up.

Soon after Lin Xiu was called, Ye Gulin walked over too.

Lin Xiu’s face became cautious when he saw Ye Gulin.

His intuition told him that the man was dangerous.

Without further ado, he activated Analytic Eye:

Character: Ye Gulin

Rank 2 Warrior

Strength: 222

Physique: 100

Speed: 65

Overall Combat Strength: 1867

The information caused Lin Xiu’s eyes to dilate: a rank 2 warrior! His strength was too terrifying. Aside from his speed, every attribute of his was higher than Lin Xiu’s!

At this time, many students gathered around Lin Xiu’s stage. The majority of the students came from nearby stages.

After all, this match was too important. One side was the tyrannical fourth ranker that was hardly at school, Ye Gulin, also known as The Tiger of Xing Yao.

The other side was the so-called trash of the school who seemed to have become extremely successful to the point of scaring others, Lin Xiu.

“Hahaha, Ye Gulin, Lin Xiu is actually up against Ye Gulin. He’s bound to die!” A student saw the match up and laughed out loud.

In his eyes, it was impossible for Lin Xiu to defeat Ye Gulin no matter how strong he had become.

“It’s hard to say.” Yang Tian heard his words and became unhappy. He glared at the student ferociously.

“If Lin Xiu wins, I will eat this entire stage!” The student heard Yang Tian’s furious reply and retorted.

“That’s great, I’ll wait for you to eat the stage!” Yang Tian rebuked him.

At the stand, Mr. Ye looked at Lin Xiu’s figure and revealed a strange smile.

“Mr. Ye, take a look at that. He is Ye Gulin, our school’s fourth ranker.”

“He is young and is already a rank 2 warrior…”

The teacher in charge of guiding Mr. Ye spoke up.

“I think that Lin Xiu is good too,” Mr. Ye replied.

“Lin Xiu?” The others around were startled, they did not understand what Mr. Ye saw in Lin Xiu?

Although everyone knew about the fight between Lin Xiu and Tang Tian, he merely defeated Tang Tian. But he could not possibly defeat Ye Gulin.

After all, Ye Gulin was a rank 2 warrior. How many were able to reach the rank 2 standard at the tender age of 18?

“You are Lin Xiu?” On stage, Ye Gulin looked at him and asked.

His gaze was cold and filled with bloodthirst. He looked at Lin Xiu as though he was looking at a dead man walking.

“That’s right.” Lin Xiu’s entire body became tense. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

This guy’s stats were high and he went out frequently for actual battle. The battle instincts gained from encountering real life-or-death situations was something the students that had grown spoilt in the castle could not compare to.

“Very good, I will kill you.” Yu Gulin revealed a smile that looked warm, but it made other people felt chills down their spine.

Lin Xiu then noticed that Ye Gulin’s weapon was neither a saber nor a sword. It was a hammer instead.

An extremely gigantic hammer!

“Both parties, get ready…” The referee looked at his watch and continued.

“Let the battle begin!!!”

His words caused the spectators to quieten down, and all eyes remained fixated on the stage.

Could Lin Xiu win? Or would he be done by Ye Gulin?

That was a question that everyone wanted the answer to.

“I will smash your brains,” Ye Gulin said and charged forward like a tiger who broke out of its cage.

Lin Xiu originally thought that Ye Gulin would be slow seeing how he carried the extremely heavy hammer. But who would have thought that his speed would be surprisingly fast!?

Lin Xiu leaned to the side and dodged the hammer.

Bang-

The hammer smashed on the ground and shook the entire place.

The students below felt the ground tremble slightly.

“Eh? You dodged it?” Although Ye Gulin revealed a surprised expression, he continued to use the gigantic hammer to attack Lin Xiu.

Yang Tian was inwardly shocked as he watched the battle. If someone got struck by that gigantic hammer, wouldn’t their bones shatter?

Lin Xiu dodged a few of the strikes and imbued his source strength into his spear.

He took the opportunity and thrust his spear at Ye Gulin.

Although Ye Gulin’s hammer looked huge and stupidly heavy, it was extremely light in his hands as he used it to block the attack.

“Just with this bit of strength?” Ye Gulin sneered and exerted force with his hammer and forced Lin Xiu back a few steps.

Lin Xiu felt the space between his thumb and forefinger go numb. Ye Gulin was simply too strong with his large hammer. Not only was he quick and smooth, but he was also strangely nimble.

‘But I can’t use Fury, it has a cooldown of three days. If I use it now, I won’t be able to utilize it anymore.’

‘What do I do?’

Ye Gulin did not give Lin Xiu any time to think as he used his hammer to continue his attacks!

Lin Xiu did not dodge and launched a counterattack this time.

It was said that offense was the best defense, especially when up against heavy weapons, maintaining a defensive position might be even more disadvantageous.

The sparring continued as sparks were formed from the collision of two weapons.

Lin Xiu’s eyes were cold, his spear was like a dragon that grasped every opportunity to pierce forward.

But Ye Gulin’s defense was strong as well and blocked all of Lin Xiu’s attacks.

“You’re only like this?!” Ye Gulin laughed.

Flaw!

Lin Xiu ignored his words, and his eyes contracted. He grabbed the chance when his weapon was retracted and went all out.

Skill – Torrential storm of rose flowers!!!

Clang clang clang!

Ye Gulin’s relaxed face immediately changed as his body instinctively felt danger. He subconsciously used his hammer to block.

But he was too late, he did not anticipate Lin Xiu’s skill that unleashed five thrusts in one second. Every thrust struck different parts of his body!

All the spectators held their breath at the sight of this scene.

They witnessed Lin Xiu’s sudden change in speed and the spear that produced afterimages and extremely cold rays of light!

In the next second, Ye Gulin was the first to retreat a few steps as blood splattered across his right shoulder.

“Ye Gulin… was actually hurt by Lin Xiu?!”
