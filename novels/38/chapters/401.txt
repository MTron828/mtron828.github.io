Chapter 402: A Huge Reward On His Head!

Lin Xiu said it out loud uncontrollably.

When Luo Yue heard his comment, she paused for a moment and her face started blushing.

“Here you go.” Luo Yue passed him the lunchbox, took her sword, and went upstairs.

Then, Lin Xiu finally realized that the things that he just said were a little embarrassing.

However, Lin Xiu still couldn’t help but say, “That chick’s attitude is really arrogant…”

While shaking his head, Lin Xiu opened the lunch box and started munching on his food.

Time passed by and it was already evening.

Lin Xiu was in his room sitting by his table and reading the screen on his monitor.

“There are very limited ways of improving my skills…. There also aren’t many creatures for me to hunt in school…” Lin Xiu was trying to look for more information on the internet in regards to improving his skill and was controllably frowning.

‘Chirp chirp – ‘

The little Ice Crystal White Bird was now lying on the refrigeration box and was happily chirping while staring at Lin Xiu.

But soon, its eyelids were dropping and Lin Xiu allowed it to sleep as he slowly placed it back into his box.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu found it interesting. The little Ice Crystal White Bird was growing at an incredibly fast rate and it was astonishing….

As for Rollie who was on the other end of the table, was lying motionlessly and it may be that it had already fallen asleep.

With two of his pets with him, Lin Xiu felt less lonely.

“Focusing Water?” Lin Xiu was reading on the warrior net and saw something known as the ‘focusing water’.

From its introduction, it was a special liquid medicine that was made from a high-grade alien crystal along with some rare ingredients. If he was able to train with this water, the effect from his cultivation would at least be doubled!

Lin Xiu was surprised as he read through the internet. For him, this was something that was extremely useful.

However, the price of it was about a few thousand for a bottle and there were different grades of it. The greater the effects, the higher the price.

Plus, now that Lin Xiu was in the Sacred Region Academy, he wouldn’t have the chance to get it.

“But, this should be sold in the Sacred Region Academy…” Lin Xiu thought about it and realized that it was not an urgent issue.

As he continued looking through the internet, the Warrior Union’s website had a lot of other news about the other warriors. There were a lot of things on it and he should really look through it. Otherwise, he would have no idea if there wasn’t anything big that happened.

“One young warrior wanted at a high price!”

Soon, Lin Xiu saw something that caught his eyes and he was stunned for a moment.

What was this?

When he saw this particular news, he did pause for a moment for some reason as he had a peculiar feeling.

He subconsciously clicked onto the news.

This was news about the disappearing rewards on the dark webs. There were many warriors that were wanted on the dark web every day. Usually, the number of rewards given was enough to show how powerful the warrior was.

The president of the Warrior Union was a good example; his reward was a total of a trillion league coins.

Well, of course, this wasn’t something that anyone was willing to do.

But, as he was scrolling through the news, Lin Xiu saw a familiar photo.

The photo showed a young man carrying a spear. It was obvious that this photo was taken from a hidden angle but it was a high-definition photo.

“F**k!” As he looked at the photo, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but mutter to himself.

Oh sh*t, wasn’t this him?!

Plus, the amount that he was wanted for has somehow increased up to ten trillion!

Ten trillion league coins was a price that was simply astronomical!

Lin Xiu took in a deep breath subconsciously. Who was it that was willing to pay so much for him?

One should know that with so many league coins on the bargain, most of the rank eight warriors would be willing to do so.

He may be able to beat a few of the warriors and fight them with his brains and the help from the system.

But he was only a rank five while the others were rank eight warriors. This was a huge barrier that he wouldn’t be able to overcome. If a rank eight warrior was really out for him, he would be in trouble!

As he thought about it, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but clench his fist.

A sense of danger grew all over Lin Xiu.

“Well, thank god that I am still inside the academy.” Lin Xiu mumbled to himself in order to comfort himself.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but sigh. The location of the Sacred Region Academy was already considered hidden. He didn’t even know the way to the academy and the rest of them wouldn’t know either.

He would be considered safe as long as he was inside the academy.

But, how did Ouyang Hang bring all these men here?

This was what confused Lin Xiu since the Sacred Region Academy’s location was difficult to find…

The Ouyang family. This family isn’t an ordinary one…

But, now that he has already become enemies with the Ouyang family, Lin Xiu wouldn’t step back as well.

He took out the diamond skills card from his pocket and played with it around his fingers, as he mumbled to himself, “Diamond skills card… huh…”

This is a skills card from the Ouyang family that has never been passed to any outsiders….. Lin Xiu has decided that he’ll learn it.

Lin Xiu was getting a little sleepy. Instead of continuing with the cultivation, he soon fell asleep.

The next morning, he woke up early and after finishing his breakfast, he rushed towards his classroom.

Luo Yue was earlier than Lin Xiu. As he got to the training grounds, Luo Yue was already standing there, dancing with her sword alone.

The others from the tenth class were shocked when they saw how sharp Luo Yue’s movements were with her sword.

“Lin Xiu!!”

As soon as Lin Xiu walked in, Zhang Yin noticed him and quickly waved to greet him.

“Zhang Yin.” Lin Xiu smiled. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Monitor!” When the rest of them saw Lin Xiu, all of them greeted him excitedly.

“How have you all been?” Lin Xiu looked at them and asked with a smile on his face.

“We have been focused on our training and even won the seventh class in the friendly match that we had two days ago!” Zhang Yin reported to Lin Xiu with pride.

“That’s right. We have taught the arrogant brats from the seventh class a lesson!” Some of his classmates added on to the story.

“A friendly match?” When Lin Xiu heard about it, he was surprised.

It seems like a lot has happened during the period of time when he was at the Dark Forest.

“En. Just a small match between the classes. 5 vs 5. Their class was the one who invited us but fortunately, we won.” Jiang Li said out loud and laughed. After all, he was still extremely proud of himself that the tenth class had defeated the seventh class!

However, if he looked closer, Lin Xiu would be able to see multiple wounds on his body that were now covered with red lotion.
