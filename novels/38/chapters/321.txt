This man held his saber and was about to attack Lin Xiu again!

Lin Xiu saw this and the pupils in his eyes constricted sharply.

If he gets hit, he would be doomed!

Just as Lin Xiu was about to dodge,a black figure appeared in front of him.

Dang–

A crisp sound rang out and the warrior’s saber was instantly sent flying!

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked at the figure that appeared in front of him.

Luo Huatian!?

Lin Xiu was slightly taken aback when he saw him.

He saw that Luo Huatian was already standing in front of him with a silver dagger in his hand.

There was no doubt that it was Luo Huatian who suddenly appeared just now and used a dagger to hit the warrior’s saber away.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu looked ahead and realized that all the warriors had been killed!

There were severed limbs all over the ground – it was a bloody scene.

This guy… is too scary eh!?

Lin Xiu saw this scene and the pupils in his eyes constricted.

Those people were all high-ranking warriors, even dealing with one was already so tough for him but Luo Huatian actually dealt with all of them so easily?

With this thought, Lin Xiu felt a chill down his back.

“Who on earth are you!?” After the warrior’s saber was knocked off by Luo Huatian, Lin Xiu looked at him and asked coldly.

There was confusion in his eyes. Luo Huatian’s strength was indeed too terrifying – he knocked out the warrior’s saber even before Lin Xiu noticed a thing.

“You talk a lot of nonsense.” Luo Huatian looked at this guy and said plainly.

At this moment, Lin Xiu looked at the silver dagger in Luo Huatian’s hand. When he took a closer look, he saw that it was covered with a large amount of black source strength that seemed to be flowing constantly.

Why is this guy’s source strength black in color?

Lin Xiu looked at this scene and was surprised.

“Courting death!” Although this warrior was a little frightened, he roared all of a sudden and stretched his right hand to the side. The saber that had just been knocked away by Luo Huatian went directly into the hands of this warrior.

At this moment, he held the saber and attacked Luo Huatian directly!

Dang–

Luo Huatian didn’t panic when he saw this scene. With a ‘swish’, he disappeared once again!

How is this possible!?

This warrior originally wanted to slice Luo Huatian’s body in half but didn’t expect that at this moment, Luo Huatian disappeared!

What exactly is going on!?

Before he returned to his senses, a trail of blood appeared on his neck.

“You…” The man opened his mouth wide and seemed like he wanted to say something when his whole head fell directly to the ground.

“Too weak.” Luo Huatian said faintly as he looked at the corpse lying on the ground.

When he said this, he turned to look at Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu felt as if he was stared at by a poisonous snake and felt a chill.

At this moment, Lin Xiu subconsciously clenched the Dark Edge Spear in his hand tightly and stared at Luo Huatian.

Dangerous, this person is too dangerous.

And he didn’t know what Luo Huatian was trying to say.

[Fury] was already activated just now and he had about two minutes before the effect of [Fury] would disappear.

Luo Huatian looked at Lin Xiu and slowly moved closer to him.

Lin Xiu didn’t know what he meant but seeing him approaching, he continued holding the Dark Edge Spear tightly.

He was ready to attack Luo Huatian any time.

Luo Huatian still looked a bit different from before.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He now has long, straight hair and looked very dashing, but his moves just now were really terrifying.

Swish——

The instant Luo Huatian was about to approach Lin Xiu, his body moved slightly and he rushed towards him.

He’s coming!

Lin Xiu saw this and the Dark Edge Spear in his hand attacked him directly.

Lin Xiu’s speed of reaction has reached the extreme.

Dang dang dang——

The Dark Edge Spear stabbed over continuously, then collided with the dagger in Luo Huatian’s hand, giving off a ring. a metallic sound.

Lin Xiu’s eyes were full of shock at this time.

This guy is holding a dagger, but he has such a terrifying strength. Not only does he have no advantage with his gun, but the weapon in his hand almost knocks his dagger out.

Lin Xiu slammed one side of his body and after avoiding Luo Huatian’s attack, his body slammed forward!

Torrential storm of rose flowers]!!!

At this moment, Lin Xiu’s spear pierced to the front at an extremely fast speed!

The spear turned into a lot of black shadows and dozens of spears shot out in an instant!

Dang dang dang——

But when Luo Huatian saw this scene, he didn’t even dodge and the dagger in his hand was like a phantom, blocking all of Lin Xiu’s attacks!

Swish——

And in the next instant, with a sudden movement of his body, he rushed to the front and then appeared in front of Lin Xiu!

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted immediately and when he was about to move, he saw a dagger placed on his neck.

“You lost.” Luo Huatian said faintly at this time.

Lin Xiu felt the icy cold blade on his neck and his scalp went a little numb.

If Luo Huatian simply exert force on the dagger in his hand, his head would probably fall off to the ground just like those warriors just now.

But in the next moment, Luo Huatian removed the dagger from Lin Xiu’s neck.

“You’re not going to kill me?” Lin Xiu stared at him and asked.

“You lasted for ten seconds, not bad.” Luo Huatian looked at Lin Xiu and said with a smile.

Lin Xiu didn’t notice it but there was a blazing passion in Luo Huatian’s eyes.

It has been a long time since I met such an interesting person, but he still needs to grow up a little more.

At this moment, he ruffled his hair, a little annoyed, “If I killed you, my sister wouldn’t let me off…”
