Chapter 762: Sudden Earthquake

Looking at these things, Lin Xiu was also a little confused.

There is such a thing.

“We are serious.”

At this time, An Qi and Qian Lin watched Lin Xiu stand there in a daze, thinking that Lin Xiu thought they were joking.

Lin Xiu came to his senses from the system when he heard their words.

“Are you sure?”

“Sure!”

An Qi and Qian Lin both nodded and said at this time.

“Why don’t you learn the double-sided axe from me, my double-sided axe is more powerful.”

At this time, the fat man waved his axe and said proudly.

“Go away.”

Hearing Fatty’s words, An Qi and Qian Lin glared at them at the same time.

“Tsk.”

Liu Pan pouted, then looked over at Lin Xiu and said to Lin Xiu with a flattering expression, “Brother Lin, why don’t you take me as your apprentice too.”

“Get lost.”

Lin Xiu glanced at him, then said aloud.

“You guys are targeting me!”

Liu Pan was very aggrieved at this time.

Seeing this wretched fat man showing such an expression, An Qi and Qian Lin couldn’t help but feel amused.

“Ok.”

Lin Xiu hesitated for a while, then nodded to Qian Lin and An Qi and said.

This suddenly activated the so-called apprenticeship system and Lin Xiu was very curious.

Lin Xiu still didn’t know what benefits this apprenticeship system can bring to him.

But it didn’t matter if he gave it a try.

“Really?”

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded.

“Yeah!”

An Qi and Qian Lin seemed very happy at this moment.

They didn’t seem to be very old, they look like they are eighteen or nineteen years old.

Now that they had the strength of the peak rank 9 warrior, it was still considered very good.

But compared to him, it’s still a little bit worse.

After all, he has the help of the upgrade system.

Time passed quickly, because they walked for so long today, so they sat by the fire and fell asleep slowly.

The trees in the fire can burn until dawn and now they feel very warm.

Lin Xiu looked up at the night sky. Tonight, the night was sultry and the stars were shining. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Lin Xiu held the crescent-shaped jade pendant that he hung around his neck, as if he saw Luo Yue’s face.

Fengyun City, are you really in Fengyun City?

Lin Xiu looked at the crescent-shaped jade pendant and a gentleness appeared in his eyes.

“Master, this is given to you by a lady?”

At this moment, An Qi came over, looked at the crescent-shaped jade pendant Lin Xiu took out from his chest and said aloud.

Because Lin Xiu agreed to accept them as disciples just now, so they changed their tune.

“Why haven’t you slept yet.”

Lin Xiu said helplessly.

“Hehe, I saw it. It was made by Lan Shiyu. This thing is only worn by girls on the Marqi planet.”

“And if a girl handed it over to a boy, it would be equivalent to a token of love.”

“You didn’t buy this yourself, right?”

An Qi said proudly.

“Cough, kid, don’t ask so much.”

Lin Xiu glared at her and said aloud.

“Tsk, you yourself are younger than me.”

An Qi pouted, disapproving.

But what made Lin Xiu curious was that this jade pendant was actually produced by Marqi Planet.

Lin Xiu didn’t expect this.

Coupled with the fact that Luo Yue went to Marqi Planet for treatment this time, Lin Xiu guessed that it was a possibility.

The Luo family must have relatives or something at this Marqi Planet...

“I’m resting, we’ll need to be on our way tomorrow.”

Lin Xiu closed his eyes and said.

“En, I’ll watch the night.”

An Qi nodded and said aloud.

Because of what happened last night, she still thinks it’s better to be cautious.

Especially in this area, if you encounter any ill-intentioned warrior and you are still sleeping, it will be over.

Although Lin Xiu closed his eyes, he didn’t fall asleep completely.

Time passed quickly and slowly the sky began to light up.

Everyone woke up on time.

“Hu.”

Lin Xiu stood up and took a deep breath.

The fire in front of this place has been extinguished.

But there is still a bit of residual warmth.

squeak-

And at this time, there seemed to be a crisp sound around.

It seems to be the sound of birds.

“Ah, morning.”

The fat man stretched, then stood up and said.

As he spoke, he began to slowly remove the bandages on his body.

“Is it crusted?”

Lin Xiu saw that Fatty’s wounds were all scabbed over and he couldn’t help but be surprised.

This healing speed is too fast.

You must know that yesterday’s Liu Pan’s wound was very deep, especially on the shoulder.

Although he didn’t cut off his shoulder directly, the wound was also very deep.

It’s all healed now.

“Of course, the Fat Master’s healing ability is super strong!”

At this time, Liu Pan said proudly and called himself “Fat Master”.

“Damn!”

But at this moment, he seemed to see something, then grabbed Lin Xiu’s arm and said with wide eyes.

“Brother Lin, your wounds are gone?”

Liu Pan found out yesterday that Lin Xiu’s arm was also injured and he also had a wound, but now, when he looked at it, not only did the wound disappear, but Lin Xiu’s arm was as smooth as ever as if he had never been injured.

“My healing ability is also good.”

Lin Xiu shook the hand that Liu Pan grabbed at him and said lightly.

“What a monster.”

Liu Pan suddenly felt a sense of frustration.

“Okay, let’s move on.”

Lin Xiu looked at An Qi and Qian Lin at this time and said aloud.

“Sure!”

It wasn’t far from there.

Boulders Valley.

This was a strange area because there were two large mountains around; one of them was frozen all year round and the other has an active volcano that seemed to erupt every year.

In the valley in the middle, there were many evolved beasts.

boom boom boom —

When everyone walked towards the front, they felt that the surrounding ground seemed to be shaking.

“What’s happening?”

An Qi and Qian Lin felt the shock and were stunned for a while, then subconsciously grabbed the surrounding trees to stabilize their bodies.

Because the shaking was so violent, it was like a big earthquake.

Lin Xiu also frowned slightly.

From the moment he came here, Lin Xiu faintly felt that something was wrong.

Some low-level birds or animals could be seen before, but this area was completely absent.

The surroundings were terribly silent.

Roar–

At the same time, a huge roar came over!
