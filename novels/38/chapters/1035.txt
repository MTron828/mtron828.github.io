Chapter 1036: The Bai family, Bai Zhanfei

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Nothing happened to Lin Xiu even when his entire body was covered in flames.

While he was inside it, Lin Xiu smirked and was mocking the other man.

Bakk – –

Then, with a slight force, Lin Xiu managed to break the sword that he was holding onto into two!

The flames that were covering Lin Xiu’s body have disappeared completely.

!!

“Let me show you how to really play with fire.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and there was a gold sourcemark that appeared on his forehead.

As the energy gathered around his sourcemark, there was a powerful force that headed towards that man!

Boom – –

Then, there was a bright golden flame that came out of Lin Xiu and directly attacked the man standing before him.

“AHHHHHH!!!”

As the flames got onto his body, a loud cry of pain and agony came out of the man’s mouth.

He instantly turned into a flaming torch and was rolling in pain on the ground.

He wailed in pain and his voice caused most of the warriors behind him to shiver in fear.

They were aware that this warrior was an expert at using the fire element warrior skills and he had a strong resistance against fire.

However, the flames that he had released earlier were useless and instead, he was being burnt by the flames that Lin Xiu had released.

Soon, the man who became a flaming torch stopped screaming and the golden flames slowly disappeared.

When they took a closer look, his body was completely burnt.

The warrior died from the flames. A strong warrior who was an expert playing with fire was burnt to death!

“Kill him!!!”

When the rest of the warriors finally came back to their senses, all of them surrounded Lin Xiu.

“How dare you go against the Bai Young Master?! You’re dead!”

One of the warriors grabbed his weapon and went towards Lin Xiu!

Young Master Bai?!

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank when he heard the name being mentioned.

He has been on this planet long enough to know that the name ‘Bai’ was rare amongst the warriors.

Only those who came from huge families would have such names.

Perhaps those from the Bai family are really here?

As he thought about it, Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes in suspicion.

Just when Lin Xiu was still thinking about it, there was already a warrior with a machete in his hand, headed towards Lin Xiu!

The machete was filled with energy and it was glowing brightly in white.

With the machete being swung at him, there was a loud sound coming from it.

Clang – –

Then, a long spear suddenly appeared in Lin Xiu’s hand and he quickly blocked the attack!

The look in the man’s eyes changed as he didn’t understand how there was a long spear that suddenly appeared.

At the same time, the rest of the warriors started attacking Lin Xiu from all directions!

Clang clang clang – –

Lin Xiu used all of the strength in his body to push away the warrior with the machete. Then, he continued swinging his long spear.

All of the warriors were thrown into the distance after colliding with Lin Xiu’s long spear!

‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers’!!!

For those who were still attacking him, Lin Xiu had decided to use these warrior skills on them.

Within seconds, there were thousands of spears that appeared in the air.

All of them were heading towards the warriors!

Although most of them already have their ‘sphere’ released, the spears were still able to penetrate through their ‘sphere’.

Not only did it pierce through their ‘sphere’, it even pierced through their bodies causing multiple bloody holes all over their bodies!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

With the Dark Edge in his hands, it was like a vicious snake and all of the warriors that were attacked fell onto the ground.

Following that were notifications coming from the system.

These were respected warriors and he wouldn’t be able to get more EXP from them.

For someone who needed a large amount of EXP to level up, these were barely anything.

“You…..who are you?!”

The man, who was the first one to attack Lin Xiu with the machete but was thrown aside, looked at Lin Xiu as his body trembled.

The skills that Lin Xiu had shown earlier were extremely horrifying.

Within such a short period of time, he managed to kill more than 10 respected warriors!

“You mentioned Young Master Bai. Is he from the Bi family?”

Lin Xiu asked in a low tone.

The man was stunned when he first heard what Lin Xiu said, then he put on an arrogant expression and answered, “Hmph! You better know your place now! The Bai family is the strongest in the Namir Planet!”

“That man is Bai Zhanfei from the Bai family. You better get on your knees and beg for mercy. Then, you’ll have to tell us how to control this robot. You have killed so many of us here and the Bai family will never let you go!”

The man assumed that Lin Xiu was frightened after hearing that they were from the Bai family and then, he stopped walking backwards due to the fear that he had for Lin Xiu.

“Bai Zhanfei from the Bai family?”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself.

Then, he glared at the man before him with a murderous look in his eyes, “Well, this is convenient. I wanted to kill people from the Bai family.”

“You…”

The man’s eyes widened after hearing what LinXiu said.

This was because he could clearly feel the murderous intention coming from Lin Xiu.

Out of reflex, he quickly released his ‘sphere’!

At the same time, Lin Xiu appeared right in front of him and had thrusted his long spear at the man.

“I have the ‘sphere’! You can’t kill me now!”

The man screamed in rage.

Lin Xiu was not bothered about what he said and continued attacking the man with his long spear.

Boom – –

His strong, resilient ‘sphere’ was then easily destroyed by Lin Xiu’s long spear!

The spear then went straight towards his chest.

“This…..this is impossible…”

His eyes were opened wide when he saw what happened.

He only thought that his body would be thrown into the distance once again but he didn’t think that Lin Xiu’s spear would be able to be pierced through his ‘sphere’.

The ‘sphere’ was made of the warrior’s source energy. It was their strongest defence.

“Who told you that I can’t kill you when you have the ‘sphere’?”

Lin Xiu answered calmly and pulled out the spear from the man’s body.

The man then dropped dead on the ground.

Until his last breath, his eyes were still opened wide and filled with disbelief.

Lin Xiu turned around and noticed that the Angel had been forced to a corner because of the attacks from the warriors.

“Quick! Break the goddamn energy barrier. I want this robot!!!”

One of the warriors who was sitting on the android screamed at his men.

The warriors on this end did not notice that the other half of their group had been killed by Lin Xiu.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎
