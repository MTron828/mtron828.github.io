Chapter 211: Swallow A Rank 8 Odd Crystal!!!

At this time, Zhuo Qixing had taken out a weird oval-shaped machine and he pressed a certain button on it.

The machine turned on in an instant.

The screen on it lit up like a radar.

“This is…” Luo Xiaoqi and the others’ jaws dropped when they saw this thing and looked very surprised.

A red dot could be clearly seen on the radar and it was constantly moving.

“This thing can detect the Odd crystals around the area.” Zhuo Qixing said with a smirk.

If the Odd crystal is in the body of the evolved beast, that kind of energy fluctuation would be isolated and this thing would not be able to detect it.

But after that person took away the rank 8 Odd crystal, he definitely didn’t expect that Zhuo Qixing had an instrument to track it, right?

There were many small red dots on the screen at this time, but only the brightest one was constantly moving.

There was no doubt that this bright spot was the rank 8 Odd crystal!

“Let’s go!” Zhuo Qixing snorted at this time and ran towards the red dot indicated on the machine.

Lin Xiu and Luo Yue held their breath in the sewer at this time.

They had been running just now and didn’t know how long they had been running. The surrounding area was full of stench, which made Lin Xiu feel a little sick.

Above his head, Lin Xiu could hear footsteps and they were very strong.

“What did you throw out just now?” Lin Xiu recalled that when they ran away, Luo Yue suddenly threw something out.

“A thing that releases a gas that makes those evolved beasts and zombies more violent.” Luo Yue said lightly.

It turns out that when the rank 8 Ice Crystal White Bird died, those evolved beasts that ran out because of the aggressiveness of the Ice Crystal White Bird have already begun to return at this time, coupled with the thing that Luo Yue threw out, it attracted those evolved beasts and zombies. This way, it would be harder for those people to find them.

“But fortunately, I finally got the rank 8 Odd Crystal.” Lin Xiu was lying on the wall covered in dust behind him as he panted.

The aftereffects of ‘Fury’ came again and Lin Xiu’s entire body seemed to be drained.

Those high-ranking warriors just now were really terrifying and they were almost overtaken even after he used the ‘Fury’ skill.

“Did you get it?” Luo Yue’s face seemed a little strange when she heard Lin Xiu’s words.

“What’s the matter?” Lin Xiu was startled and squat on the ground, then looked at Luo Yue.

Other than Lin Xiu’s mouth, other parts of his body couldn’t move at all.

He was really tired.

Luo Yue quickly took out an Odd crystal from her backpack.

The moment she took it out, the entire place brightened up slightly from the glow of this Odd crystal.

It was giving off white light. If it was cut like a diamond with sharp edges and corners, it would look like the rank 8 Odd crystal pulled out from the body of the Ice crystal white bird!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened at this time.

That’s right, he remembered that he seemed to have taken the Odd crystal.

Now that the Odd crystal was in Luo Yue’s hand, then… what was it that he took?

“Look at what’s in my backpack. I remember I got something and put it in my backpack.” Lin Xiu said aloud at this time.

Luo Yue nodded, then opened Lin Xiu’s backpack. Then, Luo Yue took out an oval-shaped object from Lin Xiu’s backpack.

Seeing this thing, Luo Yue’s eyes lit up.

“This is…” When Lin Xiu saw what Luo Yue had taken out of his backpack, his eyes widened instantly.

What she took out was not an Odd crystal, but an…egg!

That’s right, it was an egg the size of a palm. It was oval in shape and the surface was crystal clear!

“The rank 8 Ice crystal white bird’s egg.” Luo Yue glanced at Lin Xiu and said faintly.

“What’s the use of this thing…?” Lin Xiu was taken aback. It was the first time he saw the egg of the evolved beast and it was a rank 8 Ice crystal white bird.

“If there is a chance that it can be hatched, you can train it.” Luo Yue thought for a while and said.

Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up. If it could be hatched, it would be pretty good.

This Ice crystal white bird is very powerful and looks very beautiful. The feathers on its body were like ice crystals.

Luo Yue put the egg back into Lin Xiu’s backpack, then looked at Lin Xiu with the rank 8 crystal in her palm, then said, “Now, swallow this thing first.”

“Swallow…!?” Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

This was an Odd crystal, wouldn’t he choke to death if he swallowed it or get stuck in his throat, huh?

But Luo Yue didn’t give Lin Xiu any chance to react, she directly opened Lin Xiu’s mouth with her right hand and stuffed the rank 8 crystal into Lin Xiu’s mouth!

“Woo woo woo…” Lin Xiu’s eyes widened. At this moment, he felt as if his mouth was frozen and his tongue was numb, unable to move.

But this Odd crystal looked very pleasant. It was obviously a big one, but at this time it felt slippery. It slid directly into Lin Xiu’s body, down his throat.

Lin Xiu couldn’t move at all because of the aftereffects of ‘Fury’.

When the rank 8 Odd crystal entered his body, Lin Xiu’s whole body shuddered subconsciously. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Cold, extremely cold.

It was like jumping naked into the ice water in the winter.

In the next moment, frost appeared on Lin Xiu’s body.

“Use the ‘Cultivation Technique’.” Luo Yue, who was standing in front of Lin Xiu, said aloud at this time.

Lin Xiu was already frozen to the point that his body had become numb. Hearing Luo Yue’s words at this time, his body began to use the cultivation technique subconsciously.

With the use of the cultivation technique, the source strength originally stored in the body seemed to be flowing everywhere in his body at this time.

The remaining energy of the Red Lotus Fire began to surge at this moment.

The frost on his body turned into droplets of water and began dripping. Lin Xiu’s entire body has become extremely hot.

This burning sensation didn’t last long, the rank 8 Odd crystal in the body followed the use of the ‘Cultivation technique’, and a large amount of cold energy gushed out and was absorbed by Lin Xiu’s body!!!
