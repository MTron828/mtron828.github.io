1347 One Punch

“Okay,” Pang Tong nodded.

He had already absorbed the bottle of blood marrow that Lin Xiu had given him, and his overall strength had clearly increased.

“Have you decided where to go in the Dark Continent?” Lin Xiu asked.

“The Netherworld. Can we go there?” Pang Tong spoke up.

!!

At the sound of Lin Xiu’s words, Pang Tong was suddenly taken aback.

“You want to go there?”

“What’s the problem?”

Looking at Pang Tong’s expression, Lin Xiu asked curiously.

Pang Tong had always been calm, and Lin Xiu had never seen him show this kind of expression before.

“The creatures in that place are very difficult to deal with,” Pang Tong’s expression also became serious.

“I’m not afraid.”

“Can I go?”

Lin Xiu shook his head and continued, “You can’t go directly there, but you can teleport to the Blackwater City in the Dark continent.”

“Going from that city will be closer.”

“Okay, can I leave now?” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Lin Xiu nodded slightly and continued, “Of course.”

As Lin Xiu’s words fell, Pang Tong pointed his right hand at the screen in the void, and there was a clear sound of the space around him being broken.

Looking carefully, one could clearly see a crack in the surrounding space. Soon, the crack slowly opened and formed a door.

“Going out, you’ll be at the teleportation center of Blackwater City in the Dark continent.”

Pang Tong spoke up.

“Okay, goodbye.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly and walked straight in.

As soon as he walked in, Lin Xiu felt as if his body had lost gravity in an instant.

In the next moment, light shone into his eyes.

Arrived?

Looking around, he found himself in a hall.

It was very spacious, with many thick columns.

The columns were covered with dragon and phoenix words that read “Teleportation Site.”

As Lin Xiu looked around, he also noticed many warriors who seemed to have been teleported from other places, appearing in this hall.

Is this the so-called Blackwater City?

Lin Xiu walked outside and found that the streets were all black tar.

The decoration of the houses was mostly in black tones, and many warriors were walking on the street with their weapons on their backs.

“How far away is the Netherworld exactly…”

Lin Xiu murmured to himself.

He tapped his smartwatch and looked at the map on it.

The map had been transformed into a map of Blackwater City in the Dark continent.

The map was zoomed in, but Lin Xiu still could not see where the Netherworld was.

There was no label on the map at all.

After walking around the street once, Lin Xiu found a building over there with four large characters on it: “Warrior’s Guild.”

Upon entering, he realized that this was the only place in Blackwater City to receive missions.

“Are you here to receive a mission?”

Seeing Lin Xiu standing here, the staff looked at the missions displayed on the screen for a while, then took the initiative to speak.

“Yes.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

“Is there a mission related to the Netherworld?”

Although the staff didn’t know how to get to the Netherworld, if there were people in a team who knew how to get there, then someone could take him there.

The Netherworld?

The man was stunned when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

People who go there are very rare, he said seriously. “Moreover, they are all S-grade team missions.”

The Netherworld is a very dangerous place, and even hearing about it can make people feel a sense of fear.

“Help me find a way to go,” Lin Xiu said seriously.

The man looked at Lin Xiu’s serious expression and was taken aback. Lin Xiu looked too young and he did not feel the immense power that Lin Xiu had.

But since Lin Xiu made the request, he quickly clicked on his virtual keyboard and soon found a task to go to the Netherworld.

The recruiter for this mission requires the recruitment of god warriors and above, the man said as he pushed his glasses.

...

Fifteen of the twenty people have already been recruited.

He spoke as he looked at Lin Xiu.

“You can also take this task, but you need to be tested.”

“What test?” Lin Xiu raised an eyebrow.

“Come here and punch this steel plate,” the man said, pointing to a large and powerful machine that clamped a steel plate in place.

“Let me see your strength.”

“Okay,” Lin Xiu said, his eyes narrowing as he walked over.

“Wow, there’s someone who’s suicidal and wants to go to the Netherworld,” some of the warriors sitting on the chairs around him said in a strange tone.

Lin Xiu ignored their words and walked up to the machine.

Looking at the golden steel plate, Lin Xiu reached out his right hand.

His pupils shrank and his entire body’s strength erupted into his fist at that moment!

...

Boom!

A loud noise suddenly erupted.

The entire impact made the whole building tremble.

The warriors who were sitting on the chairs fell to the ground.

“Is this enough?” Lin Xiu looked at the golden steel plate he had just punched through and turned to look at the worker behind him.

“Yes… it’s enough…” The man was dumbfounded.

This golden steel plate was a special metal with an extremely terrifying degree of hardness. Only warriors could leave marks on it. But Lin Xiu had directly punched through it with one punch!

And the machines surrounding the steel plate had many cracks.

This… was too terrifying!

“Sir, please show your identity,” the man said respectfully to Lin Xiu after taking a deep breath and calming himself down.

“Here,” Lin Xiu said as he handed over his identification.

Looking at the identity card in Lin Xiu’s hand, the man’s pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

“Are you a Noble God in Lingzhou?”

“Yeah.”

No matter which continent, anyone with the title of Noble God was not an ordinary god warrior.

“Can Lingzhou’s ID card be used in the Dark Continent?”

“Yes, it can be used in all nine continents.”

The man nodded slightly.

It can be used in the nine continents, but the responsible personnel in other continents cannot access this identity information.

“Okay, register me, I want to participate in this mission in the Netherworld.”
