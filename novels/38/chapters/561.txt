Chapter 562: 11 Lucky Draws!

“That fella…”

As Lin Xiu watched Ouyang Hang leave the house, he shook his head.

Lin Xiu fell into deep thoughts as he was reminded about the Tower of Trial.

For him, the most important thing now was for him to improve his skill as quickly as possible and the Tower of Trial that Ouyang Hang mentioned was definitely something that Lin Xiu was interested in.

The 100th floor…

He has never been to that tower and has no idea what the situation was like on the inside. Plus, why would Ouyang Hang be so kind as to tell him something so secretive?

“Forget it. Let’s see what we have on the lucky draw.”

Lin Xiu mumbled to himself as he walked back into his living room and sat on the floor.

As he turned back into the system inside his mind, he was surprised to learn that he had already completed 11 lucky draws.

“Well, I didn’t think that I’d already done that many lucky draws…”

Lin Xiu tried to recall and ever since he became stronger, he seemed to have lost interest in the prizes from the lucky draw.

He no longer collected the monthly chances and the lucky draw chances where he would get after advancing to another level.

With the remaining draws that he had, Lin Xiu didn’t want to waste it and he thought that there might be a chance where he could get something nice.

Even if it is only an odd crystal…

Soon, Lin XIu clicked onto the lucky draw interface.

When the view appeared in his mind, Lin Xiu started reminiscing. The last time that he had a lucky draw was something that happened a long time ago.

This interface was similar to the ones from before. There was a wheel with ten boxes.

Three of them had warrior skill hard, the other three had odd crystals and another three had a question mark on it. As for the last box, it was a small box that mentioned ‘Grand Prize’.

Alright then….should he draw 11 times in a row?

Previously, he could only draw once at a time and has never continuously done these lucky draws. Lin Xiu did not hesitate for long and quickly pressed on the button that said ‘Draw’.

As soon as he clicked on it, the wheel started spinning!

What would he get?

Lin Xiu started to get excited. If he got the grand prize, maybe it could be something unexpected.

“Ding! Congratulations. You have got the ood crystals!”

“Ding! Congratulations. You have gotten a potential pill!”

“Ding! Congratulations. You have gotten ‘Thor’s armour’!”

“Ding…”

As the lucky draw continued, the notifications continued ringing inside Lin Xiu’s head.

At the same time, there was a bright light on top of him that appeared and the prizes that he got were being dropped all over the ground.

“That’s quite a lot.”

Lin Xiu looked at the things that he got that were being dropped all over his living room and mumbled to himself.

He was a little bumped since he had done it 11 times in a row but he still didn’t get the grand prize.

Looks like the chances of getting the grand prize would be quite low.

Lin Xiu started looking through the prizes that he got.

There were a lot of odd crystals but most of them were of the lower ranks. (For Lin Xiu’s current state, anything that was less than rank 8 was considered low.)

“Here you go.” Lin Xiu looked at Xiao Bai and Rollie who were sitting next to him. Their eyes were both stuck onto the odd crystals that he held in his hands.

As usual, they acted as if they could understand Lin Xiu and quickly went for the odd crystals. They moved all the odd crystals that were gathered together like a small hill, to one corner of the room and started chewing on it.

Lin Xiu chuckled before scavenging through the rest of his prizes.

” ‘Thor’s Armour’ …. This looks cool.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up with excitement when he saw the new combat suit that he just got. The ‘Silver Leopard Armour’ that he had before had been damaged in the fight with the rank 8 warrior. It was about time that he needed a new suit.

Lin Xiu removed the Silver Leopard Armour and replaced it with Thor’s Armour. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

The new armour seemed thick and heavy but as he put it on, it felt light.

Plus, as soon as he put it on, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that his body strength was a little stronger.

It does feel amazing.

“Potential Pill….and this warrior skill card…”

“Huh?”

As he continued looking through the prizes that he got, one of the warrior skill cards caught his attention as his eyes lit up with surprise.

The word ‘Middle’ was written on the card and on the back of it, it says – ‘Clean Sweep’.

This was the same card that he had gotten previously!

He still remembered the one that he got before was ‘Up’ but this one was ‘Middle’!

“I already have an ‘Up’ and a ‘Middle’, so the only one that remains is ‘Down’?”

As he made sense of the cards that he had, Lin Xiu got excited. Although he had no idea what level these cards were, you can only use them after collecting all three parts of it. That shows that these cards had extremely powerful skills!

With that thought in mind, Lin Xiu felt even more excited.

He stored the cards carefully and swallowed the potential pills.

There were a total of 50 of them and after taking all of them, he had a total of 50 potential points.

“That’s quite a bit…” Lin Xiu was surprised. He didn’t think that there were so many potential pills.

His strength, physique, speed have all been increased.

After adding those points, there was a comfortable feeling that ran through his body.

Lin Xiu may be a rank 7 warrior now but it still isn’t enough. While facing a true rank 8 warrior, it wouldn’t be as easy for him to deal with if he didn’t have the system.

As he thought about the warrior from the Royal Beast Sect, Lin Xiu was sure that he had to quickly improve his abilities.

“I’m leaving while the both of you stay at home.” Lin Xiu stood up and picked up his backpack. He also picked up Dark Edge before turning towards his pets.

When they heard what Lin Xiu said, they stopped chewing on the odd crystals and rolled towards Lin Xiu.

Seeing their reaction, Lin Xiu asked helplessly, “What’s wrong? Both of you want to go out as well?”

“Both of you are too big. It’ll be too difficult for me to bring you out.”

As soon as Lin Xiu said that, both creatures shook their bodies and their entire body started trembling.

“What’s happening?” This was the first time that Lin Xiu has ever seen this happening and he was shocked.

Soon, with Lin Xiu looking at them, Rollie and Xiao Bai started shrinking at a quick speed!

Xiao Bai shrunk his body till he was the size of a small bird while Rollie was only the size of his palm.

Rollie was like a bouncy ball as it bounced and landed on Lin Xiu’s left shoulder while Xiao Bai rested on Lin Xiu’s right shoulder.

“You can change sizes?!” Lin Xiu asked as he couldn’t believe what he just saw..
