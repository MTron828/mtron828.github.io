Chapter 728 It’s Snowing

Qian Jing looked at the gates of the Legacy Land that was now in debris. He was stunned.

All of the lava were now covered with thick snow and they could no longer see the lava coming from within it.

“Hu…..hu…”

Huang Ji continued staring at the land before him. The Legacy Land was no longer there and everything was now covered in snow.

It was as if that place had never existed.

He looked at the purple gold warrior skills card in his hand and smiled.

He might not have gotten the inheritance of the Ice and Snow Emperor but he still managed to get this skills card. He was already happy with it.

Plus, Lin Xiu, the annoying earthling, was dead as well, which made him even happier.

“Mr Huang Ji, what do we do now?”

Jiang Jun turned towards Huang Ji who was standing next to him and asked.

Although they didn’t get the main thing that they had come for, they still managed to get lots of diamond level warrior skills cards as well as war loot. They took a lot from the legacy land and it was good enough for them.

“We’ll head to the Ice and Snow City and think of a way to get to Fengyun City.”

Huang Ji thought about it for a moment before saying

“Alright.” Jiang Jun nodded his head. “How many lives did we lose?”

Huang Ji continued asking.

“A staff as well as the first on the Tianjiao List.”

Jiang Jun took a look at the crowd behind him before answering Huang Ji.

It was a waste for Jiang Jun seeing how the first on the Tianjiao List had died inside the Legacy Land.

“En. I’ll report it to them.”

Huang Ji said flatly.

“Who said that I’m dead…”

Just then, a familiar sound came from behind that caused an ugly looking expression on Huang Ji’s face.

As he turned around, he could see Lin Xiu’s head bobbing out of the thick layer of snow, trying to crawl his way up.

“So, you’re alive.”

Huang Ji was smiling but his eyes were filled with a murderous intention.

How is it even possible?! There was terrifying lava chasing after this brat and he isn’t dead?!

As he was surprised, his will of killing Lin Xiu grew.

“Well, I wouldn’t die so easily.”

As soon as Lin Xu crawled out of the thick snow, he pulled out the Dark Edge as well.

As Lin Xiu commanded a flow of energy in his body, the source body in his energy flowed through and melted all of the snow that was on his body.

as

He immediately felt warm.

As for the rest of the warriors, the looks in their eyes looked complicated when they saw Lin Xiu.

“You brat…. I knew that you were going to be fine.”

Qian Jing laughed when he saw Lin Xiu.

“It’s great that you’re fine.” Jiang Jun was surprised but he still nodded his head.

The place where they were standing at now, it was an infinite amount of white. They couldn’t even see the end of it.

As for the rest of the warriors who managed to escape, they started walking in the opposite direction.

“Mr Huang Ji, I just wanted to ask if you’ve seen our leader, Zhang Zhiheng?”

One of the members of the God’s Punishment Guild asked as they walked past Huang Ji. “I’m sorry. I haven’t seen him.”

Huang Ji shook his head.

He thought that it was weird as well. Zhang Zhiheng was the one who got the inheritance. He was also one of the strongest warriors here. How is it that he never got out?

“Thank you.” The man thanked Huang Ji before walking away.

“Let’s get going as well. Here. This is the direction to the Ice and Snow City.”

Jiang Jun settled the rest of them and got them walking towards the Ice and Snow City.

“It’s snowing…”

At the same time, in Fengyun City, there were snowflakes falling out of the sky as well.

A young girl was holding onto her sword as she was about to practise it when she suddenly stopped. She reached out her hand and allowed the snowflakes to fall onto her palm.

The snowflakes’ shape was special as they looked like they were floating.

But, as soon as it landed on the girl’s palm, it immediately melted with the warmth coming from her palm.

She stared at the snowflakes that had melted as if she had thought of something.

A young man who was nearby saw the girl and his entire focus was on the girl.

This young girl was incredibly beautiful. With her standing there, she was just like a piece of art.

“Who is it?”

Suddenly, the young girl noticed him. She turned around and frowned as she swung her sword. A horrifying sword aura was released from the sword that was headed towards the young man.

Boom – –

As the sword aura was headed towards him, he managed to block it with his ‘Yuan’.

“Yue’er, it’s me.”

The man chuckled as he said to her.

“My name is Luo Yue.”

The young girl said with a cold look on her face.

That’s right. This young girl was Luo Yue.

As soon as she woke up, she and Luo Yan were staying here.

A long time has passed, Luo Yue looked much more mature than she was before.

“Haha… isn’t it the same? It’s just the same.”

The young man smiled at Luo Yue.

“When are we allowed to leave here?” Luo Yue looked at the man before asking him.

“I heard that the only spaceship back to earth has been attacked and it’s now destroyed. If the spaceship starts working again, I will let you know.”

The young man smiled as he continued.

“This is also the Luo family. You could just…..”

“You can leave now.” Before he could finish, Luo Yue said to him flatly.

“The Luo family will be having dinner with the Huang family in two days later. You should be prepared for it. The old master looks forward to this dinner. You have to be there.” Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

The middle aged man wasn’t angry by what she said and was still speaking to her with a smile on his face.

“He was hoping that you could be prepared for it.”

With that said, the young man left.

Luo Yue was stunned for a moment before she let out a breath of relief.

Well, some things are just unavoidable.

“This fella…..this is no different than putting us on house arrest.”

Then, Luo Yan appeared from the other end and she sounded mad.

Luo Yue’s injuries had completely recovered. It may have been easy for them to come here but it wouldn’t be as easy to leave.

Especially after how the Luo family has realised that Luo Yue’s body was different from the rest. They would never allow them to leave so easily.

“Hmm? Yueyue, it looks like your abilities have gotten better?”

Luo Yan walked over towards her as she stared at Luo Yue in shock.

“Don’t call me that.”

Luo Yue felt uncomfortable after being called in that manner by Luo Yan.

“Fine. What level are you at now?”

Luo Yan asked as she laughed at her sister.
