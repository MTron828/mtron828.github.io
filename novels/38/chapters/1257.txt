1258 Rare Materials

As the blinding white light started to slowly move across the long spear, the entire Dark Edge was glowing brightly.

Lin Xiu stared at his weapon and waited for the glow to slowly disappear.

Everything returned to its original state.

However, Lin Xiu noticed that there were words that appeared on the scroll.

Weapon’s type: Spear

Weapon’s name: Dark Edge

Weapon’s level authentication: Saint level

Options: [High grade saint level] [Beginner’s grade god level]

When Lin Xiu saw the options at the end, it seemed like he could choose one of the options.

His long spear, was it a weapon that belonged to a saint level?

Lin Xiu looked at the analysis of his weapon and was surprised.

At the end of it, Lin Xiu was actually given a choice to actually upgrade his weapon?

But, how would he be able to choose it? By pressing onto it with his fingers?

Lin Xiu didn’t know what to do and decided to reach out towards the scroll.

A god level weapon would definitely be much better than one that was of a saint level. Who would choose to upgrade their weapon to a saint level one?!

As Lin Xiu clicked onto the option of a god level weapon, there was another bright light that came from the scroll.

When he took a closer look at it, the bright light was getting absorbed into the scroll!

“Damn it!”

Lin Xiu was beyond shocked when he saw what was happening.

The long spear has been absorbed into the scroll?!

Lin Xiu quickly picked up the Book of Reform.

When he took a good look at it, he could clearly see that there was a picture of his long spear inside the scroll.

His long spear was stuck inside the scroll!

Lin Xiu quickly looked towards the words that were written at the bottom.

Materials needed: [Spirit Stone Energy Stone] + [The Root of Frost] + [ Metal of Thousand Years Old] + [Odd Crystal of Thousand Year Old Beast God]

There were also pictures of the materials that were requested.

After looking at it, Lin Xiu pursed his lips.

Forget about those that he had never seen before, how was he going to get an odd crystal of a beast god that was a thousand years old?!

“Give it back to me!!! Give it to me now!!!”

Lin Xiu picked up the scroll and started shaking it vigorously.

He wanted to shake the long spear out of the Book of Reform.

However, it was useless.

“It’s over.”

Lin Xiu widened his eyes and sat on the ground helplessly.

From what he could understand now, before he gathered all of the materials needed to upgrade his long spear, he would not be able to get it back from the scroll!

What a trap?!

“Mr Pang, get over here!!”

Lin Xiu, who was furious, screamed for Mr Pang.

Soon, Mr Pang’s figure came running into Lin Xiu’s room.

“City lord, what’s wrong?”

Mr Pang was trying to catch his breath.

This was the first time that Lin Xiu had heard him being so angry. He completely disregarded his own cultivation and ran to Lin Xiu.

“Do you know where to get these?”

Lin Xiu passed the scroll to him.

Mr Pang took over the scroll and carefully looked at the items that were written on it. He couldn’t help but gasp.

“What’s wrong? Would I be able to find these things?”

Lin Xiu panicked as he asked Mr Pang.

“Each of these items are rare other than the odd crystal.”

Mr Pang gulped as he spoke.

“It’s that difficult?!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were opened wide.

Did he just dig his own grave?!

If he couldn’t use his long spear as his weapon, it would be a major blow to him!

None of the other weapons would be able to allow him to release all his strength.

...

“But….I do know where to get the Metal of Thousand Years Old.”

Mr Pang carefully thought about it before informing Lin Xiu.

“Where?!”

Lin Xiu’s body shook a little before asking.

“At the Multi-City Contest that happens every October!”

“Amongst the nine states that we live in, there is a god king and he would be the one who will host the contest. All the city lords would be allowed to participate in it. If I remember correctly, one of the rewards for the contest would be the Metal of Thousand Years Old.”

Mr Pang was trying his best to jog his memory.

“Which month is it now?”

“It’s 13th August now.”

“Well, from the looks of it, there is about one month left before the contest.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were narrowed when he heard what Mr Pang said.

...

“All of the weapons that we brought back, have you distributed all of them?”

Lin Xiu thought about the weapons that had been taken from Shachang City.

The weapons found there may not be as good as his long spear but they were still considered to be good weapons.

Although there were lots of them in the warrior god realm who were warrior gods, the weapons that most of them have were not as skillful as they look.

“There are still a few of them left.”

“They’ve been placed in the storage room.”

Mr Pang answered carefully.

“En.”

Lin Xiu took the Book of Reform and placed it in his expansion space before heading to the storage space. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

Most of the weapons have been taken away by the guards and amongst those that were left behind, there were daggers, whip, claws and a pair of boxing gloves!

Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up brightly when he saw the boxing gloves!

Other than using his spear, Lin Xiu also had experience with using his fist.

This was because Lin Xiu had cultivated skills related to fist technique and he even got a god level warrior skill – ‘Destroy the Sky’.

Lin Xiu immediately picked up the boxing gloves from the ground.

It was a heavy pair of boxing gloves which was why no one picked it.

For the ordinary warriors, these boxing gloves may make it difficult to throw punches.

However, for Lin Xiu, it was indeed something that suited him.

“Nice.”

Lin Xiu threw a few air punches and instantly felt relieved.

As the energy in his body slowly got transferred into the boxing glove, Lin Xiu could clearly see that there were faint red marks on the gloves.

Lin Xiu could feel a strong surge of energy that came from the gloves when the red marks appeared.

It looks like these faint marks would be able to make him stronger!

“Looks like I unexpectedly found a treasure.”

Lin Xiu was overjoyed.

As he already lost his long spear, Lin Xiu started training on his fist techniques.

This was to ensure that his actions would be smooth.

Time passed quickly and it was already the second day.

“Let’s head to Changqing City.”

Lin Xiu was at the city lord mansion and he gave his instructions to Baili Haoling, Lei Chong and Mr Pang.

“You want to go to Changqing City?!”

When they heard what Lin Xiu had said, all of them widened their eyes in disbelief.

Those from Changqing City were obviously planning on how to attack Lingxian City.

Instead of defending their city, they would be attacking first?

“En. I need odd crystals.”

Lin Xiu answered shamelessly.

“Odd crystals? I still have four of them…”

Lei Chong quickly spoke up when he heard what Lin Xiu needed.

Lei Chong and Mr Pang weren’t quick with how they absorbed their odd crystals and they didn’t even finish absorbing even one off crystal after so many days.

“City lord, I have some as well.”

Mr Pang quickly spoke up as well.
