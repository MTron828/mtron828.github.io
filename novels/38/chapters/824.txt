Chapter 825: Accompany You To The Ends of the Earth

puff–

Inside the palace of Fengyun City, a middle-aged man spurted out a mouthful of blood.

“Damn...”

This man is Huang Ying.

He used his external avatar to deal with Lin Xiu previously.

But he didn’t expect that in the end, Lin Xiu used a method to increase his strength.

Killing his avatar.

“Damn... If it weren’t for the lockdown, a warrior of this level would not survive for a second at all.”

Huang Ying’s face was a little ugly.

Looking at the blood he vomited, since he unified Marqi Planet, he didn’t remember how many years he haven’t vomited blood.

/

“You can’t escape, even if you go anywhere, you can’t escape.”

Huang Ying sneered when he thought of the young man’s face.

“I will come back, even if you are Respected Warrior.”

And Lin Xiu, who was outside the city, hugged Luo Yue’s body, looked at Fengyun City in the distance and said expressionlessly.

Looking at Luo Yue with long white hair, Lin Xiu hugged her and left directly to the other side.

“where are you going?”

Luo Yan looked at Lin Xiu’s actions and said aloud.

“The ends of the earth.”

————————————————————————————————————————-

“Speaking of that day, that young man from Earth, holding a long spear, shot through the sky and fought against a hundred thousand warriors for a beauty...”

Above a restaurant on the Marqi planet, an old man touched his long white beard and said aloud.

Beside him, many warriors listened with relish.

What happened that day has evolved into countless versions and spread all over the Marqi planet.

After all, in this era of extremely convenient communication, you can’t hide anything.

“I didn’t expect that the warriors from earth would be so strong.”

“Where is he from?”

“Old man, go on, was he killed by the emperor in the end?”

“...”

“One hundred thousand warriors? Brother Lin is too strong!?”

And a fat man who happened to be sitting at the other table suddenly widened his eyes and said aloud.

“Sure enough, Master is definitely worthy of being a master, you’re amazing!”

The two beautiful girls sitting across from him also spoke out a little proudly at this time.

“It’s not that exaggerated, there may be more than 10,000 warriors.”

Luo Yan said helplessly at this time.

Half a year has passed since the incident that day and Lin Xiu asked Luo Yan to settle down in Cang Qiong City.

With Liu Pan and others, they are quite familiar with each other.

“I don’t know, Brother Lin, where are you now?”

Liu Pan said a little helplessly at this time.

Hearing Liu Pan’s words, Luo Yan and others couldn’t help but froze for a while.

“This place is said to be the top of the highest cliff on the Marqi planet, isn’t it beautiful?”

At the same time, somewhere in the world, under a said to be the highest mountain, a man sat on the top of the mountain, looked at the scene below and suddenly laughed.

And beside him, also sat a very beautiful woman.

The woman has long white hair and she seems to have closed her eyes and fallen asleep.

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue, who was hugging and sitting beside him, with a soft look in his eyes.

Since the beginning of cultivation, he hadn’t had a good look at the surrounding scenery.

After settling Luo Yan in Cang Qiong City, Lin Xiu took the sleeping Luo Yue and walked all over the Marqi planet and saw all kinds of the most beautiful scenery in the world.

Although Luo Yue was still sleeping, Lin Xiu was thinking that she would definitely feel it.

The source energy in her body is poured into her body every day, even if she does not need to eat, she can maintain the energy of her body.

Of course, the consumption of source energy is also very large.

boom boom boom —

At this moment, a sound of vibration came over.

This made Lin Xiu’s brows wrinkle involuntarily.

Looking back, you can clearly see that there are a large number of giant evolved beasts rushing over there.

There are also many king-level evolved beasts living on the highest peak mountain range in the world.

Lin Xiu seemed to have broken into their territory. At this time, a large number of evolved beasts attacked Lin Xiu.

“Wait for me, I’ll be right back.”

Lin Xiu carefully held Luo Yue against a big tree, then used the source mark power to release a matrix to protect Luo Yue.

With a wave of his right hand, the Dark Edge spear on the ground immediately flew towards Lin Xiu’s hand.

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly, his body moved and in the next moment, he rushed towards the front!

Whoosh whoosh—

These dozen or so giant evolved beasts of the king level, watching; Lin Xiu rushed over and suddenly became even more furious and attacked Lin Xiu frantically.

boom boom boom —

There was a loud noise on the surrounding ground.

boom boom boom —

In the body of the Dark Edge spear, there are a lot of flames burning.

With a stab of the spear, the head of a huge king-level evolved beast was pierced by Lin Xiu’s spear!

Although he has traveled all over the world in the past six months, Lin Xiu’s practice has not fallen too far.

Now he has been upgraded to level 59.

After reaching level 59, even if you kill a king-level evolved beast, you won’t gain much experience.

boom boom boom —

With the long spear swung in his hand, all the evolved beasts around were killed by Lin Xiu.

The huge bodies of those evolved beasts fell to the ground in an instant.

“I only gained 0.001 percent of my experience...”

Looking at the system prompt in his mind, Lin Xiu was speechless.

Originally, he thought that he would be able to advance to become a Respecter warrior by upgrading to level 60, but what he didn’t expect was that now he would gain so little experience by killing a king-level evolved beast, which is too painful.

He wasn’t sure how long it would take to become Respected Warrior.

“Cough cough.”

And at this time, Lin Xiu’s face turned pale for a while, then he spat out a mouthful of blood.

There was also a sharp pain in the body.

When he was fighting in Fengyun City that day, the system skill ‘Sacrifice’ he used had overdrawn too much of his life force.

Although the vitality of warriors is very strong, as the warrior becomes stronger, the lifespan will be longer.

But having overdrawn too much life force made Lin Xiu look like he didn’t have much time left.

“Within half a year, I must reach level 60.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, wiped the blood from the corner of his mouth and said to himself.

After arriving at Respected Warrior, he should be able to restore a lot of lost vitality.

Or, in this world, finding any genius treasure should be able to make up for the overdrawn vitality.

“Lin... Xiu.”

At this moment, a familiar voice suddenly came over, causing Lin Xiu’s body to froze in place.
