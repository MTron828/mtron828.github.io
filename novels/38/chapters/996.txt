Chapter 997: The Terrifying Defense

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

How did that happen?!

Ji Mei was stunned when she realised what was happening.

This was already her strongest warrior skill by using her source mark but she still couldn’t hurt the Angel!

However, she didn’t have the time to think about what was happening. The Angel had 3 pairs of wings on her back and they were shining brightly. Suddenly, there was a white ray of energy beam that instantly headed towards her!

Boom boom – –

Ji Mei’s pupils shrank uncontrollably and she quickly released her ‘sphere’!

The terrifying energy beam landed on her ‘sphere’ and there was a loud explosion that followed.

Her entire body was thrown far far away.

Even when she was already protected by the ‘sphere’, the impact still caused her to spat a mouthful of blood.

She took a good look at her ‘sphere’ and noticed that there was a huge crack on it.

“It’s so strong…”

Ji Mei wiped off the blood on the corner of her lips and mumbled to herself.

This angel that was artificially built was so powerful. This must be why they were able to kill so many powerful warriors previously.

Right at that moment, the Angel started moving the huge pike, pointing it at Ji Mei!

Her eyes were opened wide when the terrifying weapon was pointing at her.

She had just been hit by the overpowering energy beam and now she had to deal with such a horrifying attack.

She couldn’t take it anymore!

Just when she thought that everything was over, a figure stood right in front of him.

Clang – –

Lin Xiu was holding onto his spear and started firing it towards the large pike!

With the continuous launch of attack, the Angel had no other choice but to take a few steps back.

“Go!”

Lin Xiu screamed at Ji Mei.

He had gathered all of the energy in his body and was about to explode.

Not only was this Angel filled with energy, she also had an armour that was extremely tough.

It was much tougher than the ‘sphere’ that these warriors had!

Ji Mei nodded her head and ran, trying to find a place to hide.

She knew that with her condition now, she would be dead soon if she stayed here.

“AHHHHH!!!”

As for the Gao brothers, they were behind the Angel. They leaped into the air as they raised the machetes over their heads, releasing their strongest attacks towards the Angel’s body!

But, the armour that the Angel had was something that they have never seen before.

Even with their strongest skills, it had no effect on it!

“How is this even possible?!”

Gao Lin looked at how the Angel was unharmed after attacking it multiple times. He started to lose his mind and was screaming on top of his lungs.

“Calm down! Try to find its weakness!” DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Gao Chong was much calmer than his brother and immediately warned Gao Lin.

“That’s right. We have to find the weakness to the artificially created Angel!”

Gao Qiang nodded his head as well.

This robot that was created might be scary…

But it was something created by mankind and this meant that there will definitely be a way to defeat it.

At the same time, the angel was now targeting Lin Xiu.

She continued moving the huge pike and was attacking Lin Xiu non stop!

Boom boom – –

On the ground, there were huge craters formed with every single explosion that she caused with her pike.

The entire ground was starting to collapse.

Suddenly, a bright light appeared on Lin Xiu’s head.

There was a black sourcemark that was slowly visible on Lin Xiu’s head and the entire space was filled with floating arrays that were dark blue in colour.

Lin Xiu continued stepping on the arrays and used them as a support to get closer to the Angel so that he could attack her with his long spear!

Clang clang clang – –

Lin Xiu’s body quickly moved across the Angel and immediately slashed the armour!

Sparks flew everywhere.

However, there were only slight marks left on the armour.

At this point, Lin Xiu was shocked as well.

He was aware of how sharp his weapon was.

Along with his energy strengthening it, it should have been able to break her armour.

But, things didn’t go as he had expected. He couldn’t even break it open!

The Angel held up her shield and hit it against Lin Xiu who was still trying to attack her.

She managed to accurately estimate where Lin Xiu would be at and the shield directly hit Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

With that, Lin Xiu’s body flew in the air and landed heavily on the ground.

“Are you alright?”

Ji Mei saw the fight and rushed towards Lin Xiu.

The sourcemark on her head got lit up again and there was a bright green light that entirely covered Lin Xiu’s body.

Lin Xiu, who wasn’t badly hurt, instantly felt a warm feeling around his body.

All the minor injuries that he had, quickly recovered on its own.

“You can use two source marks?!”

Just when Lin Xiu was about to get up on his feet, he was surprised to see the sourcemark on her head.

“En.” Ji Mei nodded her head but suddenly, she looked worried.

“Look out!”

Lin Xiu looked up and saw the Angel coming at them with her huge pike!

The entire pike was now glowing brightly in white as the Angel transferred her energy onto her weapon.

It looked like there was already a large amount of energy gathered on it.

“Crap!”

The Gao brothers had a bad feeling about it when they saw what was about to happen.

The Angel’s pike that was covered with energy was much stronger and scarier than before.

Gao Lin and his brothers couldn’t help but think that even with their ‘spheres’, the pike would instantly break it apart.

Lin Xiu was shocked as well.

The black sourcemark appeared on his head once again.

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Within a blink of an eye, there were multiple arrays that surrounded Lin Xiu and Ji Mei!

Boom boom boom – –

The dozen layers of arrays that were protecting them immediately broke apart and the pike immediately landed on Lin Xiu’s ‘sphere’.

Because of the arrays that Lin Xiu had released, it managed to take up most of the impact and Lin Xiu’s sphere was just enough to protect the both of them from the attack!

Gao Lin and his brother dropped their jaws to the ground.

It was a terrifying attack but Lin Xiu managed to survive it!

“Go!”

Lin Xiu pushed Ji Mei away so that she could hide and immediately activated ‘Rage’!

Initially, he refused to use it because Gao Lin and the rest were here. It would put him in a terrible situation due to the aftermath if he used it now.

But now, he had no other choice!

“Move!!!”

As Lin Xiu activated ‘Rage’, his entire body was then filled with energy once again.
