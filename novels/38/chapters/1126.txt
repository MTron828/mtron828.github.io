Chapter 1127: Getting the Holy Water

Lin Xiu suddenly realised that there was no sound when he spoke!

No…..it wasn’t that there was no voice, it’s just that he couldn’t hear?

Lin Xiu continued talking but he couldn’t hear anything.

At the same time, Lin Xiu could feel a cold breeze hitting his cheeks.

!!

What’s that…?

Lin Xiu subconsciously touched his face and realised that there was water coming from above his head.

As the water droplet fell on the ground, there wasn’t even the slightest sound heard.

So….it wasn’t that he had no voice. Instead, he couldn’t hear.

Lin Xiu frowned. He turned around and saw that everything was pitch black.

In this small tunnel, he couldn’t hear any sound and it felt as if he had been separated from the rest of the world.

He couldn’t see the entrance and he couldn’t see the end of it as well.

Especially now when he couldn’t hear a single sound, if it was anyone else instead of Lin Xiu, they would have gone crazy.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath before continuing forward.

As he walked in the tunnel, it felt as if time had frozen.

He had no idea how long it had been but Lin Xiu continued walking inside the tunnel.

It felt as if it had been a decade long.

Lin Xiu’s heart, which was a little anxious in the beginning, was slowly starting to calm down.

Then, there was a dim light that appeared in front of him.

Hmm?

When Lin Xiu saw the bright light, the look in his eyes changed.

Then, he fastened his pace and moved forward.

As he got closer to the light, Lin Xiu then noticed that he had gone into another region!

“This is…”

When he took a closer look around, it was a huge space and there was a dim, white glow that came off the walls that were made of rocks.

There were also lots of odd looking vines that grew on the walls.

These vines were like creepers as they were stuck onto the wall.

“Hmm?”

Lin Xiu suddenly noticed that he could hear his voice. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

Looks like it was the problem with the tunnel.

Lin Xiu looked around and found a well that was in the centre of the space.

Where am I?

When Lin Xiu saw the well, his pupil shrunk. He tried his best to suppress his excitement as he moved forward.

Lin Xiustood next to the well and looked into it. That’s when he noticed that the well had a dazzling light inside it.

These dazzling lights seemed to be coming from the liquid that is found in the bottom of it.

Lin XIu could also clearly feel that the well was full of intense energy.

This energy was so strong that Lin Xiu was incredibly surprised.

“This should be….the Holy Water!”

“Who was it?!”

At the same time, by the gates of the forbidden grounds, there was a large number of warriors from the Bai family that finally arrived.

One of the elders looked extremely pissed.

As for the rest of the Bai family, they were frightened by what they saw.

There were eight sage warriors’ bodies found lying on the ground which showed that it must have been a tough fight.

However, they did not hear any sound coming from the fight.

It was only when the patrols were moving around and they found them dead.

These eight sage warriors were responsible for protecting the forbidden grounds and their abilities would definitely be the best. However, all of them are dead now!

“Lock up this area and activate the first degree defence mode!”

The elder told the rest of his men in a solemn tone.

“Yes!”

The rest of the warriors nodded their heads after getting the instructions.

“Would it be possible that they entered the forbidden grounds…..”

One of the warriors from the Bai family asked.

From his perspective, it would be impossible that there was only one person who killed 8 sage warriors.

Plus, these people definitely had intentions of entering the forbidden grounds.

“We can’t have a search in the forbidden grounds.”

The elder agreed with what was said as well as he shook his head.

Only the head of the Bai family would be allowed to enter the forbidden grounds.

“Elder Bai Lin.”

At that moment, there was a voice that called him from behind.

The elder turned around and saw a middle-aged man walking towards him.

“Greetings, Master!”

When they saw who it was, the elder quickly bowed respectfully.

“Greetings, Master!”

The rest of the warriors kneeled on their knees.

The middle-aged man was the head of the Bai family, Bai Qi.

“Stand up.”

Bai Qi looked at his men before waving his left hand.

There was a strange energy that whiffed across them and all of the warriors stood up at the same time.

“Master, someone has killed the sage warriors guarding this place and went into the forbidden grounds.”

Bai Lin looked at Bai Qi and reported the things that he knew.

“How many were there?”

Bai Qi didn’t seem to be nervous and was still talking in a calm manner.

“We’re not sure about that. There should be a group of them.”

Bai Lin shook his head.

To be able to kill so many sage warriors silently, it has to be a warrior god!

However, it would be impossible for warrior gods to appear in Nano Planet.

“All of you stay here. If there’s anyone that comes out, kill them.”

Bai Qi gave his commands.

“Yes, Master!”

The rest of the warriors answered respectfully and quickly got into position.

Bai Qi then walked into the forbidden grounds.

He carefully looked around and noticed a few small footprints on the ground.

“Hmm?”

Bai Qi looked at it and he couldn’t help but frowned.

From the looks of it, there was only one person who had entered this place.

Only one.

It was only one person who killed 8 sage warriors?

There was a look of disbelief in Bai Qi’s eyes.

Then, he continued walking through the tunnel.

This place was known as the ‘Underworld Tunnel’.

There was a weird feature to this place. Once you enter the tunnel, you will not be able to hear anything.

Most of the warriors who could not stand it would immediately turn mad!

“This should be it…”

Lin Xiu stood by the well and stared at the dazzling fluid that was in the bottom of it. He was starting to get excited.

Then, he removed all of the armour that he had on.

Exposing the gold skeleton bones that were left of his body.

Without any hesitation, Lin Xiu jumped into the well.

As his body was being surrounded by the fluid, Lin Xiu could feel that there was a strong energy penetrating into his body.

They were penetrating into his bones.

The feeling of being completely filled by the overpowering energy made Lin Xiu feel extremely comfortable.

It was indeed very comfortable.

At the same time, Lin Xiu started moving the energies in his body. He was trying to slowly use these Holy Water to regenerate his body.

Lin Xiu already had the experiences of using the purple crystal water to regenerate his body. So, the Holy Water was slowly gathering itself over his bones under the control of Lin Xiu’s consciousness.

It started forming a human body!
