Chapter 1092: Victory

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

What was that?!

When Lin Xiu saw what was happening before him, his pupil shrank uncontrollably.

This was because he could clearly feel that there was a sudden burst of strong energy from the body of the flame dragon.

With such horrifying energy, Lin Xiu could also clearly feel the pressure coming from it.

Roar – –

With the flame dragon’s loud roar, it slapped its wing and went high up into the sky!

His entire body was covered with a large amount of energy which was why the body of the dragon had a bright red glow.

Lin Xiu saw the dragon that was coming at him. He tightly gripped onto his long spear and gathered all of the energy in his body.

The temperature around him suddenly dropped tremendously.

He was using the Heart of Frost.

‘Freezing the distance’!!!

As the long spear was aimed at the flame dragon which was rushing toward Lin Xiu, a terrifying frost appeared and it went straight for the flame dragon.

Whoosh – –

Instantly, the body of the huge flame dragon was covered in ice.

It was now like a huge ice sculpture that was floating in the air.

Lin Xiu started at the scene ahead. Without much hesitation, he attacked the dragon with his long spear.

He was hoping that he could break this flame dragon into pieces!

Crackling – –

But, at that moment while Lin Xiu had the long spear raised above his head and was about to hit the flame dragon, there was a loud, clear noise that came out of nowhere.

What’s that sound?

The look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed when he heard the sound.

Then, at the very next moment, the ice that was all over the body of the flame dragon cracked!

Roar – –

The flame dragon came back to life and let out a loud roar.

It immediately breathed out a mouthful of fire at Lin Xiu who was about to attack him.

Lin Xiu was caught off guard and his entire body caught in the flames.

The huge flames had completely covered Lin Xiu’s entire body.

Lin Xiu’s body instantly became a huge ball of flame.

These flames were different from the ones that surrounded Lin Xiu earlier.

This was an extremely vicious flame. As Lin Xiu was getting burnt by the flames, he could feel the sinister energy that was coming from it. It felt as if it was slowly penetrating through its pore and into his body.

It was a terrible feeling.

Then, while Lin Xiu was still trying to set himself free from this devilish flame, the flame dragon started attacking him again.

It was aiming its claws at Lin Xiu’s body!

Boom – –

The huge claws landed on Lin Xiu.

With the huge impact, Lin Xiu’s body, which was covered in flames, flew into the distance.

Boom – –

His entire body fell heavily onto the ice ground and there was a loud explosion that followed.

Following that, the flame dragon continued to open its huge mouth.

That’s when a large flame came rushing out from inside its mouth.

Boom boom boom – –

At that moment, there were balls of flames that went directly toward Lin Xiu.

Boom boom – –

As the balls of flame hit the ground, the entire ground started shaking.

There were loud explosions as soon as these flames landed on the ground.

“Damn it!”

Lin Xiu, who was amongst the flames of the explosion, finally stood up.

With the ‘sphere’ protecting him, Lin Xiu didn’t suffer many injuries.

There were only traces of blood on the corner of his mouth.

Although these flames were sinisters and made it very uncomfortable for Lin Xiu…

Lin Xiu could still slowly adapt to the energy of the flames.

Due to how Lin Xiu has been absorbing energies from different flames, these flames were nothing too scary for him.

Plus, at the same time, he had the heart of frost. Everything around him seemed to get much cooler in an instant.

The flames around him slowly disappeared as well. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

In order to defeat this flame dragon, it seemed like warrior skills that were of the fire element wouldn’t be useful.

Therefore, he could only use the skills from the other elements.

As he controlled it with his mind, the ice on the ground cracked into pieces and all of them flew into the air.

Soon, all of this ice turned into powder and formed a huge ice pike.

“Go!”

With one loud scream, the ice hammer that was floating in the air, directly went to the flame dragon!

Roar – –

The flame dragon looked at how the huge ice pike was coming at it and the dragon let out another loud roar.

It continued shooting out large balls of flame.

It was trying to completely melt the huge ice pike that was coming toward him.

However, the ice pike seemed to be resistant to flame and it directly passed through the flames that were coming out of the dragon’s mouth. It was still headed toward the dragon!

Boom boom boom – –

As the ice pike hit its body, it was followed by several loud noises.

Although the ice pike had not pierced through its body, half of it was already inside!

At least half of the huge body of the flame dragon that had been pierced by the ice pike.

Roar – –

The flame dragon started screaming madly as if it was in intense pain.

Its body was struggling in the air like crazy as well.

Lin Xiu’s body was still floating in the air and then, he started moving the long spear that was in his hands.

There were large pieces of ice that continued attacking the huge flame dragon.

These ice were travelling at a very quick speed and when they landed on the dragon’s body, there were loud explosions that followed.

Soon, there was a large amount of blood that came splashing out of the dragon’s body.

For evolved beasts that were of this size, it would be impossible to defeat it with close combat. It would be best to fight them from far away.

He looked at the flame dragon and noticed how its body was slowly falling from the sky as it was getting attacked by the ice.

Now’s the time!

Lin Xiu saw his opportunity. He gathered the energy in his body and transferred it to the long spear that was in his hands.

The entire spear started shaking vigorously.

‘Heaven Breaking Strike!’

With the long spear moving across the air, there was an opening that appeared in the space right in front of them!

The body of the huge flame dragon was then sliced into two by this overpowering warrior skills!

There was a large amount of blood that came splashing out of the body of the dragon.

Then, a notification came from his system about the EXP gained from killing the flame dragon.

1%…

He only gained 1% after killing a saint evolved beast.

Lin Xiu was speechless.

His EXP was progressing too slowly.

He was still 2 levels behind from being a warrior god and it was getting really difficult to pass these levels.
