Chapter 341: Seen Through

Crash—-

Lin Xiu could see the figure of the middle-aged man!

He’s not!!!

“Hahaha! This is all you’ve got!?” At this time, as the flame dissipated, the middle-aged man’s voice could be heard.

Take a closer look, although the flame was blocked by his unfolded ‘sphere’ and he didn’t seem to have suffered any damage, he was drenched in sweat and his entire battle suit was completely soaked.

The scorching temperature of the flame still scared him; if it wasn’t for his strong source strength which supported him in resisting the flames, he would be annihilated by the flame by now! Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

With this thought, a chill went down his spine.

But it was a pity that he was completely fine now.

“You have used up a lot of your body’s energy by using this skill? It’s my turn now!” The man looked at Lin Xiu on the other side and said aloud.

The second he said that, the light blue barrier on his body disappeared instantly.

If he kept using ‘sphere’, it would use up a lot of energy.

Lin Xiu’s face turned ugly at this time. The ‘Awe of the phoenix’ just now consumed a lot of Lin Xiu’s power and now there was no way of using the ‘Awe of the phoenix’ to attack again.

He didn’t have any choice now – either the man dies or he dies.

Lin Xiu clenched the Dark Edge spear tightly and took a deep breath. Before the man rushed to his side, Lin Xiu rushed straight ahead!

Swish——

Lin Xiu’s speed has reached the extreme and like a shadow, he rushed to the front!

“Courting death!!!” The middle-aged man saw Lin Xiu even dared to rush over and he immediately felt that his dignity had been insulted.

And coupled with the fact that Lin Xiu had just used that powerful skill to suppress him, he became extremely angry.

Holding the saber in his hand, he slashed at Lin Xiu’s body abruptly!

Dang–

A loud sound rang out as his saber hit the Dark Edge spear that Lin Xiu thrust out.

Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted.

After all, this guy was a rank 7 warrior. The power of the saber that slashed over at this moment was too strong. The impact was transmitted to the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hand and Lin Xiu’s arm went numb, he nearly dropped the spear.

But Lin Xiu still gripped the Dark Edge spear tightly, took a step back then continued to attack the middle-aged man!

Swish swish swish——

The moment the spear stabbed out, there was a sound slicing through the air.

What a fast speed!

When the middle-aged man saw the dozens of spears illusions stabbed out by Lin Xiu, he had a tinge of surprise in his eyes.

If a warrior of the same rank used this kind of skill, he wouldn’t be surprised but Lin Xiu was merely a rank 5 warrior yet he used such a powerful skill.

“Insignificant skill!” However, he was a high-ranking warrior after all and he was very confident of himself. In addition, Lin Xiu has just used such a skill that used up a lot of source strength, it should be the end of the battle now!

Kill him!

There was an extreme murderous intent in the eyes of the middle-aged man as the saber let out clanging sounds like it felt the powerful force transmitted to the saber and trembled.

Lin Xiu’s ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’ stabbed out, but the middle-aged man actually managed to dodge all of them!

Lin Xiu looked at this scene and frowned. It was indeed too strenuous to fight against a rank 7 warrior himself.

And at this time, the sharp-eyed Lin Xiu also found that the man’s saber had a very powerful sword aura gathered on it.

What is this!?

Lin Xiu was shocked.

It seemed that this middle-aged man was secretly gathering strength while using his body skills to dodge Lin Xiu’s attacks.

Just when Lin Xiu’s spear pierced out again, the middle-aged man dodged then he held the saber in his hand with both hands and slashed down on Lin Xiu’s body!

As he slashed over, the surrounding space sounded like it was about to tear apart, making a loud noise.

And at this moment, Lin Xiu could clearly see the dazzling light from the saber.

This light was directly reflected in Lin Xiu’s eyes. In an instant, everything before Lin Xiu’s eyes turned white.

Darn it!

“Go to hell!!!” The middle-aged man screamed and the saber in his hand had already cut Lin Xiu’s body!

Boom–

The sound of the blade slashing through the air was already loud but at this moment, the sound was even louder, it was deafening!

The saber was full of terrifying power and it exploded over!

Boom——

Lin Xiu’s body couldn’t react fast enough and was directly hit!

“Here!!!” But after the middle-aged man blasted ‘Lin Xiu’ into pieces, he didn’t stop his movements and attacked the other side!

He noticed!?

Lin Xiu, who had already appeared on the other side at this time, had a change in expression.

That’s right, he used ‘Mirror Image’ to avoid this attack.

Because with Lin Xiu’s current strength, there was no way he could use his normal reaction speed to avoid the attacks of these warriors who were two ranks higher than him.

But what Lin Xiu didn’t expect was that the middle-aged man actually noticed when he used the ‘Mirror Clone’!

Swish——

At this moment, Lin Xiu only saw a black shadow flying towards him and he saw the man directly waving his saber in his hand and cutting it down to his body!

“Didn’t expect it, huh! I’ve already seen through this trick of yours!”

The middle-aged man yelled and the saber in his hand was about to chop Lin Xiu’s head off!!!

Swish——

At this very moment, Lin Xiu saw a white flame rushing from another direction!

Bang–

The white flame hit the saber directly!

The saber was about to cut Lin Xiu’s body but froze all of a sudden under the impact of the white flame.
