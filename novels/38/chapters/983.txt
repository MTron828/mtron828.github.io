Chapter 984: Grand Prize, Grand Prize Again!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

With a flash of light, a beast emperor-level Odd crystal appeared in front of Lin Xiu.

After exiting the system interface and returning to reality, Lin Xiu was a little helpless when he saw this odd crystal appearing in front of him.

Now that he had reached the Sage warrior level, it was simply too difficult to level up.

Unless it was an Odd crystal of the beast saint level, this type of Odd crystal will not have much effect on Lin Xiu.

As soon as his thoughts were triggered, Lin Xiu directly put the beast emperor-level Odd crystal into his expansion space.

There were two more chances.

Lin Xiu entered the system interface again.

As Lin Xiu clicked to start, the turntable turned again.

“Give me a prize!”

Lin Xiu stared at the turntable with wide eyes.

As the turntable turned frantically, Lin Xiu immediately called to stop when he saw the pointer go past the grand prize.

At this time, the speed of the turntable has gradually slowed down from the original speed.

It’s almost at the ‘Grand Prize’!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu was excited.

It’s been a long time since he won a grand prize and every time he got a grand prize, it was something good.

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu became even more excited.

The turntable was getting slower and slower and it was about to stop at the ‘Grand Prize’ slot!

“Give me the grand prize!”

Just when Lin Xiu shouted excitedly, the turntable slid slightly and it slid to the slot next to ‘Grand Prize’.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations, Master, for getting the ‘Holy Light Battle Suit’!”

“Darn it!”

Hearing the system’s prompt, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened and he couldn’t help but cursed.

This was too annoying. He thought it was a grand prize, but it turned out to be a battle suit.

Lin Xiu was speechless.

As a white light flickered in front of Lin Xiu, the battle suit appeared in the air.

The battle suit was white with a pale gold pattern on it.

It does look very nice.

Take a closer look at the attributes of this Holy Light suit:

Holy Light suit

Grade: S grade.

Additional skills: ‘Holy Light’: Can shine in the eyes of the enemy.

“Hehehe…”

Lin Xiu looked at the introduction and the corners of his mouth twitched, black lines all over his head.

To be able to shine the eyes of the enemy, what kind of lame skill!

But this battle suit was actually S-class, which was beyond Lin Xiu’s expectations.

Now the battle suits and weapons obtained from the system were divided into grades and the worst was C grade.

The suits and boots that he obtained before were all A-level, but he didn’t expect that this time he got an S-level suit.

S-rank suits were one level higher than A-rank suits!

Without thinking much, Lin Xiu directly changed into this Holy Light battle suit.

As soon as the battle suit was put on, Lin Xiu felt very light and bright.

And this battle suit was very thin, he couldn’t really feel any weight when he put it on.

“Comfortable.”

Lin Xiu said.

This battle suit, although the accompanying skills were a bit funny, but it was much more comfortable to wear than the battle suits he had worn before.

As his level continues to improve, the quality of things were also much better.

When he won the ‘Grand Prize’ previously, he got a ‘Star-Moon God Armor’, but compared to the current battle suit, it was lousier.

There was one last chance to draw a lottery.

Lin Xiu thought about it, hesitated for a while and decided to use it.

He went on to click the lottery button in the middle of the carousel.

This time, Lin Xiu’s goal was to get a pair of skill cards or combat boots.

Please don’t give me an odd crystal.

Lin Xiu knew that unless there was a grand prize, the Odd Crystal won could not be a Beast Saint-level Odd Crystal.

If it wasn’t a Beast Saint-level odd crystal, it wouldn’t have much effect on him at all.

Except for an Odd crystal, anything will do!

As the turntable turned frantically for a while, Lin Xiu clenched his hands excitedly.

“Stop! Stop! Stop!!!”

As soon as Lin Xiu’s words came out, the speed of the turntable, which was turning frantically, began to slow down in the next moment.

Soon, the pointer pointed to the square of the odd crystal.

“F***!”

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, he couldn’t help but uttered a vulgarity.

The more you don’t want something, the more it’ll come to you!

Lin Xiu was extremely depressed. In the three lottery chances, he didn’t get anything he wanted.

But just when Lin Xiu was extremely depressed, the turntable didn’t seem to stop completely.

“Eh?”

Lin Xiu also found that there was no system prompt in his mind.

At this time, he continued to look at the turntable and it was still turning slightly.

At the next moment, the pointer on the turntable slowly pointed to the smallest grid.

“Congratulations to the master for winning the ‘Grand Prize’!!!”

A very pleasant voice sounded.

The grand prize, I really won the grand prize!

“Congratulations, Master, for winning the ‘Grand Prize’ – Assign a skill!”

“You can choose any type of skill!”

“Spear art, can I choose spear art!?” Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

At this time, Lin Xiu suppressed his excitement and said.

“Yes.”

The electronically synthesized sound of the system came over again.

“Spear art, I want spear art!”

Lin Xiu hurriedly continued speaking.

With a flash of light, in front of Lin Xiu’s eyes, a skill card slowly appeared.

Holy level!!!

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide, looking at the dazzling skill card, his eyes widened.

Although he knew that the grand prize would definitely be the best, he didn’t expect that it would be a holy level card!

You must know that a holy-level skill, even the sage warriors on this planet, were constantly vying for it!

Lin Xiu stretched out his hand and held this skill card.

Taking a closer look, it was indeed a skill card of the spear art type.

‘Destiny Spear Art’!

Just by looking at the name, Lin Xiu felt that this spear art had terrifying feeling.

Without the slightest hesitation, Lin Xiu sat down with his legs crossed and placed the skill card on his forehead.

After mobilizing the source strength of his body and communicating with the skill card, all the spear art information contained in the skill card was transmitted to Lin Xiu’s mind.

Spear art was the foundation of using a spear.

As for spear art skill, it was equivalent to a skill. The use of skill requires source strength, while spear art sometimes requires source strength, but it was far less than skill.

With the continuous flow of information on spear art into Lin Xiu’s mind, a sense of pain struck.

But still within the tolerable range.

Not long after that, when Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, the spear art and skill card fell from his forehead.

Because the skill information inside has been completely absorbed by Lin Xiu, so now it looks like it is just an ordinary skill card.

“Let’s try it…”

Picking up the Dark Edge spear that fell on the ground, Lin Xiu waved it!
