Chapter 202: Gathering Of Warriors

After stabbing a zombie’s head, he turned to Luo Yue, who was killing the incoming evolved beasts and zombies and exclaimed.

Luo Yue heard him and looked over before nodding.

They would exhaust themselves if they stayed and continued to fight.

There were so many zombies and evolved beasts that it was illogical to continue staying.

“Awe of the Phoenix!!!” Lin Xiu swung his spear out and unleashed many blazing birds that formed a blazing tornado. The two took the opportunity and leaped forward before rushing ahead!

The blazing tornado obstructed the evolved beasts and zombies and the two were able to arrive at the other side smoothly.

Roar-

The evolved beasts and zombies thought of pouncing towards Lin Xiu and Luo Yue but were unable to due to the height.

“Whew.” Lin Xiu sat down and heaved a sigh of relief. As he leaned to the side and looked down, he was able to see many evolved beasts and zombies gathering.

At this moment, the zombies and evolved beasts were fighting each other and felt like a dogfight.

“That Ice crystal white bird seems to be infuriated, all those warriors will die.” Luo Yue looked into the distance.

All the buildings in the center of the city had been sealed by ice, and the core region had turned into an ice city.

“I wonder how Zhang Yin and the others are doing.” Lin Xiu muttered.

Lin Xiu was still unclear why everyone got separated. He knew it was not only because of the mist.

Rumble rumble-

Right at that moment, Lin Xiu looked up to see multiple strange flying devices soaring over.

“Who are they?” Lin Xiu was surprised.

“They should be here to hunt the Ice crystal white bird.” Luo Yue’s eyes turned cold.

The Ice crystal white bird was a rare creature, adding that it was rank 8, its odd crystal and its entire body were good materials.

If anyone were to discover such evolved beasts, it would attract powerful warriors to hunt them. This was nothing strange.

Bang-

Right at that moment, figures descended and all of them landed at the top of a few high-rise buildings.

“Oh? There are two youngsters here.” A man slowly descended with the help of his flying device to where Lin Xiu was situated.

He looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue with a faint hint of surprise.

Lin Xiu looked at him with Analytic Eyes.

‘Unable to analyze!’

‘He is at least rank 7?!’

Upon thinking about this, Lin Xiu became cautious, while Luo Yue glared at him coldly as well.

“Don’t need to be so hostile with me, I have no interest in you little brats.” The middle-aged man shrugged helplessly and said.

“You’re here to hunt this evolved beast?” Lin Xiu frowned and pointed at the Ice crystal white bird that was in the air and asked.

“That’s right.” The man smiled.

“I wanted to ask, how long has the Ice crystal white bird appeared, has anyone fought with it yet?” Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

His aura suddenly became strong as he looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

“It was sleeping well but someone seemed to have attacked it and awoken it.” Lin Xiu held onto Dark Edge tightly and replied indifferently.

Lin Xiu was able to sense the immense power from the man and knew that he was too powerful.

“En, alright.” The man nodded his head and pressed a button behind him. The flying device on his back quickly turned and he flew away.

“Rank 7 warrior.” Luo Yue looked at the man and said.

Lin Xiu nodded his head and looked ahead. There were many warriors that relied on various flying devices to come over.

Some came in groups, some came alone.

Their goal was simple, to hunt and kill the peak rank 8 Ice crystal white bird

“Damn, there are too many zombies and evolved beasts here, we have no way to leave…” Zhang Yin and the others kept on running and ran into a building.

They looked outside and could see the dense mass of zombies and evolved beasts through the glass window.

The frequent roars would cause their scalp to turn numb.

All of the evolved beasts and zombies were rank 4 and above. Dealing with just a few was terrible enough, much less the horde of them outside.

“Looks like all the evolved beasts and zombies in the center had escaped here because of that terrifying evolved beast. It’s going to be troublesome to leave now.” Jiang Li had an ugly expression as he commented.

They had used up a lot of their nourishment liquid and had dropped the remaining. All of the vials had broken and the liquid had dropped onto the ground.

After finishing the remaining nourishment liquid, they had none left.

If the evolved beasts did not leave, they would starve to death!

“If only Class Monitor is here…” Li Ping sighed and said.

“Wait, don’t you think he looks like Lin Xiu…?!” Zhang Yin stood at the window and stared at a figure, as though he had spotted two familiar figures.

“Yes, it is! Lin Xiu and Luo Yue!!!” Li Ping was ecstatic.

They were situated at a higher spot. Although they could not see clearly, the group could make out their weapons and clothes. It was without a doubt Lin Xiu and Luo Yue!!!

“Let’s go up!” Jiang Li clenched his fists and said.

Just as they were about to head up, the ground trembled as though a powerful earthquake had started!

Rumble-

Lin Xiu looked into the distance, the Ice crystal white bird unleashed the terrifying cold breath, and the tall structures around started to break and fall like ice cubes.

The Ice crystal white bird noticed many warriors flying over and it became even more furious.

It started to fly angrily and shrieked in the air.

The shriek from its mouth had caused the earthquake!
