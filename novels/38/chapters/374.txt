Chapter 375: Punishment

Zhang Liangqian felt the tremendous force from the fist and was a little surprised at this moment.

He didn’t expect that Lin Xiu’s strength was actually pretty good and he was not evenly matched with his fist.

“It seems that you’re quite strong.” Zhang Liangqian looked at Lin Xiu, then said with a sneer.

As soon as he spoke, he waved his fist and attacked Lin Xiu again!

Swish swish swish——

As he waved his fist, there were loud ‘swishes’ in the air.

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes constricted and when his fist swung over, his body dodged at an extremely fast speed.

At this time, there were already many warriors around, looking at Lin Xiu and Zhang Liang who were fighting in the middle.

“Although your reaction speed is quite fast, your warrior ranking is not high.” Zhang Liangqian said coldly while fighting with Lin Xiu.

At this time, he had already clearly felt Lin Xiu’s strength, which should be lower than his.

With this thought, he suddenly became more confident.

As long as Lin Xiu is knocked down to the ground and embarrassed, the beautiful girl would probably have a bad impression of him, right?

Thinking like this, Zhang Liangqian’s speed also became faster.

Bang——

At the next moment, he seized the chance when Lin Xiu was dodging and threw a punch!

Taking a closer look, his fist has a large amount of source strength gathered around it and the air around the fist seemed to have become distorted.

This punch was very powerful!

Crackling——

Originally, he thought Lin Xiu would dodge but he was surprised to find that Lin Xiu waved his fist to attack him.

“Courting death!!!”

Seeing this, his eyes widened.

A low-ranking warrior still wanted to counterattack even when it was so obvious that all his power was gathered on his fist.

Lin Xiu was basically challenging him!

And at this time he heard a strange ‘crackling’ sound.

In the next moment, just when his fist was about to hit Lin Xiu, he saw a blue light spread over him.

What is this!?

While he was still surprised, he saw Lin Xiu’s fist full of lightning coming towards him!

“This is the ‘Lightning Punch’?”

Seeing this, some warriors were a little surprised.

“This is a low-ranking skill. Although it has high requirements from the user like having to withstand electricity but what is the use…”

Some warriors were talking amongst themselves.

“Who said this is ‘Lightning Fist’.”

Lin Xiu had a great hearing and heard the comments. He raised his brows, then shouted, “This is ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’!!!”

As Lin Xiu yelled, the lightning on his fist became more terrifying, filled with bursts of sounds like fried beans. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The air around the fist seemed to be scorched.

“Go to hell!!!”

Looking at Lin Xiu’s fist, Zhang Liangqian roared, his fist collided with Lin Xiu’s fist again!

He was a master in close combat, how could he be frightened by Lin Xiu’s so-called ‘Silver Thunderbolt Rupturing Fist’!

Bang——

As the two fists collided, there was a sound that was even more terrifying than before.

All the heavy glass tables around were sent flying!

Only the glass table that Luo Yue was at did not have any movement.

When the two fists collided, the lightning passed directly to Zhang Liangqian’s body.

“Ddd…damn…”

Zhang Liangqian thought that Lin Xiu’s skill was just the “Lightning Fist” and the voltage generated by “Lightning Fist” was not high. He had some training to resist electric current so it was not a problem at all.

But it was only when the fists collided that he found out that the voltage of the lightning from Lin Xiu’s fists was so terrifying.

And at this moment, he clearly felt that because of this terrifying lightning, his body felt paralyzed.

Lin Xiu didn’t delay and continued attacking with another fist that was also full of current!

“Stop it!”

At this moment, there was a sharp shriek from the other side.

Lin Xiu’s expression changed when he heard the voice. He was about to slam his fist but at this time he couldn’t move it at all.

Bang–

At the next moment, the bodies of the two were separated and moved to the left and right.

Lin Xiu turned abruptly and saw an old man wearing a white uniform of the Sacred Region Academy walking over.

Seeing this, Lin Xiu’s gaze changed slightly.

“Have you two memorized the school rules before? I wonder if fighting on the spacecraft of the Sacred Region Academy is a serious violation of the Academy!” The old man looked at Lin Xiu and Zhang Liangqian, then shouted sharply.

“He started it.” Lin Xiu said, raising his hands.

“Bullshit!” Zhang Liangqian’s face became nasty when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

“Both of you don’t have to say anything. Put these tables and chairs back nicely, then bring your student IDs to me.” The old man looked at Lin Xiu and Zhang Liangqian, then said sharply.

Lin Xiu had a headache at this time. He couldn’t analyze this old man’s strength with his Analytical Eye – he must be very strong.

At this time, Lin Xiu had no choice but to arrange the glass tables and chairs neatly.

Zhang Liangqian gritted his teeth, then moved the tables and chairs as well.

“Go back and wait for your punishment.”

The old man said as Lin Xiu and Zhang Liangqian gave the old man their cards to take down their information

Punishment?!

“Hehe, kid, you are in trouble. The Sacred Region Academy’s punishment is not any ordinary punishment. When the time comes, you’re going to suffer.” As the old man walked away, a warrior passed by Lin Xiu and spoke with a gleeful smile.

Zhang Liangqian’s eyes were filled with annoyance. At this time, he glared at Lin Xiu and walked to the other side.

“This is good for you.”

Luo Yue, who has been looking at the phone, turned off her phone at this moment, then said indifferently.

“Good? Being punished is good?!” Lin Xiu heard Luo Yue’s words and was speechless.
