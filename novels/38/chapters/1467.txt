1468 Level 75!

The Flame of Chaos is so powerful!

His hand holding the long sword was instantly burnt to a bloody mess, and even the bones of his hand could be seen!

“You only have this bit of strength huh?”

Lin Xiu said in a cold voice at this time.

In the next moment, the body bounced straight up!

The fist of the right hand swung directly at his head!

No!!! 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Looking at this scene, Ling Tianxi, who was already seriously injured, had no way to dodge.

At this moment, he let out a roar, and just formed a ‘Sphere’ to forcibly block Lin Xiu’s blow.

Lin Xiu’s fist with Flame of Chaos had already bombarded Ling Tianxi’s head directly!

The ‘Sphere’ he had unfolded was directly blown away at this moment.

There was blood flowing from the corner of his mouth.

Before she could react, he continued to punch his head with the fist of Flame of Chaos.

‘Destroy the Sky’!

Boom——

This punch erupted with a loud sound.

“Hoo hoo…”

Lin Xiu was out of breath immediately after punching out this punch.

Now that his body is already very weak, it is not easy to kill Ling Tianxi at this time.

As Ling Tianxi’s body fell directly to the ground, his body suddenly burst into purple light.

“Where are you fleeing to?”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

At this time, a black source mark appeared on his forehead.

As the power of the source mark appeared, a matrix suddenly bloomed.

Directly framed Ling Tianxi’s soul power that was trying to escape.

“Hm?”

Huangfu Yuanshen, who was in the sky, looked at the scene below, and the look in his eyes changed slightly.

This kid is not dead yet.

The child killed Ling Tianxi.

“Your soul power is mine.”

Huangfu Yuanshen snorted coldly and pointed his right hand at Lin Xiu below.

At this moment, a large amount of energy gathered.

With the gathering of these energies, soon, an incomparably huge force was formed.

Facing Lin Xiu below, he directly charged over!

Whoosh—

This huge energy group hit down very fast, and in a short moment, it reached Lin Xiu’s side.

It hit Lin Xiu’s body in an instant.

Boom——

At this moment, a loud sound erupted from the entire ground.

“die.”

Huangfu Yuanshen looked at this scene, and immediately let out a sneer.

His current strength is not comparable to that of ordinary god kings. He has already surpassed all god kings!!!

As the thick smoke below dissipated, Huangfu Yuanshen’s eyes changed slightly.

Because he clearly saw that Lin Xiu’s figure was still below!

He is not dead!

How can this be!

Even the mighty God King’s physical strength couldn’t resist the blow just now!

At this time, Lin Xiu’s body obviously had a large number of wounds, and blood continued to flow down.

Just at that moment, Lin Xiu used the ‘Golden Body Immortality’ skill.

If it wasn’t for using this skill to resist the most terrifying moment, he could really die.

At this time, Lin Xiu grabbed Ling Tianxi’s soul power and swallowed it directly.

Yes, I’m upgrading!!!

“Ding! Congratulations to the master for successfully upgrading, the current level is seventy-five!”

“…”
