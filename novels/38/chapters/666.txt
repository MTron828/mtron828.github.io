“Huh?”

After hearing what Ye Kai was saying, Lin Xiu frowned. Since when can those from the Sky City kill him as they liked?

“They were saying that you had purposely killed both the elders from the Jiang and Zhuo family. The Federation Government have been hunting for you.”

Ye Kai explained to him.

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered as he thought of Nan Huang’s grandfather after hearing what Ye Ka said.

The culprit itself trying to capture him?

Looks like these men were really trying their best to get rid of him.

“[ should bring you out of the city now. Otherwise, we would be in great trouble.”

Ye Kai continued saying.

‘There were too many warriors here in Sky City. Plus, the Federation Government is involved now and they have already sentenced Lin Xiu guilty of murder. Lin Xiu was now in a dangerous situation.

With his current abilities, it would be impossible for him to fight all of the warriors in Sky Clty.

“Uncle Ye, could you bring me to one place first?”

Lin Xiu kept quiet for a moment before asking Ye Kai.

At the same time, back in Luo Yue’s house, Lun Yan was walking back and forth, looking anxious.

“Bring her there.”

Then, a beautiful young woman walked out of the room, carrying Luo Yue in her arms as she spoke to Luo Yan.

“We have no other choice?”

Luo Yan looked at the woman who was carrying Luo Yue. There was not much blood on her clothes now but Luo Yan could feel that Luo Yue’s vitals were deteriorating; it felt as if she would die anytime soon.

The woman shook her head, “Her injuries are too severe.”

“Bring her to the planet. I have already made the arrangements there.”

“alright.”

Luo Yan didn’t think too much about it. She carried Luo Yue in her arms and walked out the door.

“Is this the best decision?”

The woman looked at Luo Yan, who was leaving, and she mumbled to herself.

As soon as she finished her sentence, a man walked out of the room.

This man was Luo Zhen, Luo Yue’s father.

“We have no other choice. On that planet, they have skills that are much more powerful than others. They are still part of the Luo family afterall, they should be able to help us treat Yue’er.”

Luo Yan said to the woman.

“En”

The woman nodded her head.

“Who is it?!”

It wasn’t long when Luo Zhen suddenly felt something moving towards them. He frowned before reaching out his hand.

Xiu–

As he moved his right hand, there was an aura that was released in a crescent shape that headed in the direction where he felt someone coming. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Boom —

‘The trees in the same direction were chopped into halves.

‘There were two men, covered in a black cape, that appeared before their eyes.

Luo Zhen and the woman next to him, who was his wife, were prepared to fight.

Just as they were about to move, they heard Lin Xiu’s voice, “It’s me.”

Lin Xiu removed the black mask that he had put on so that Luo Zhen could see his face clearly.

“That’s him?”

When Luo Zhen saw Lin Xiu, he asked out loud.

“That’s him.”

Luo Zhen’s wife turned towards him and Luo Zhen immediately pointed out who Lin Xiu was.

“Uncle, Aunty… where’s Luo Yue? Is she alright?”

Lin Xiu immediately asked them.

It was obvious that Lin Xiu was extremely nervous and worried that something might have happened to her.

Luo Zhen remained quiet and he looked angry.

Lin Xiu was the reason why his daughter got injured.

“You must be Lin Xiu.”

Luo Zhen’s face looked at the young man standing before them. She sighed before putting on a slight smile on her face.

“En”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“Now, she must be with Luo Yan, leaving the Earth.”

“Leaving Earth?!”

Lin Xiu was shocked when he heard what the woman had told him.

“Her injuries are worse than what we can treat. Otherwise, we would have to change her into a cyborg.”

Luo Yue’s wife looked a little helpless as she mentioned it.

If there were other options, no one would like to be changed into a cyborg.

Being a cyborg would be just like a robot with a human mind.

“Could you tell me which planet she would be on?”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath as he tried to calm himself down.

“With your abilities now, you would die on that planet.”

“Plus, the entire Sky City is looking for you. How dare you come here?!”

Luo Zhen spoke to Lin Xiu in a cold tone.

This was because Luo Yue’s injuries were partly caused by Lin Xiu and now, he was extremely unhappy with him.

“Uncle, please tell me.”

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Zhen sincerely, hoping to know where Luo Yue was.

‘The same scene kept popping up in Lin Xiu’s mind where Luo Yue got hit by the laser beams through her chest. Lin Xiu felt as if it was his heat that was shot. It hurts like hell.”

He clenched onto his fist with his nails digging into his palm.

‘When Luo Yue’s wife looked at Lin Xiu, she sighed again before saying, “Marqi Planet.”

Margi Planet…

Although Lin Xiu had no idea where it was, he still had an idea of where Luo Yue was.

“Thank you.”

Lin Xiu said to Luo Yue’s parents.

“Uncle Ye, please send me to that planet.”

Lin Xiu said towards Ye Kai.

Ye Kai was also wearing a black cape with a mask. His face was completely covered except for his eyes.

He nodded his head after hearing Lin Xiu’s request.

Luo Yue’s parents were surprised to find Ye Kai as they could clearly feel that this man was extremely powerful.

“Thank you. I shall leave now.”

After getting what he needed, he turned around and left the house.

He was now a captive of the Sky City. If anyone found him here, the Nan family, who already hated the Luo family, would hold this against the Luo family.

“You’re too weak. If you can’t protect her, leave her alone.”

As he watched Lin Xiu leave, Luo Zhen couldn’t help but remind Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was an enemy to many people here. As a father of a young girl, it would be extremely dangerous for Luo Yue to be with him.

Just like this time.

Luo Zhen’s wife gently tugged his sleeve, asking him to stop talking as she was worried that Lin Xiu couldn’t take it.

This was the man that their daughter had chosen.

Lin Xiu suddenly stopped.

“[will protect her.”

“When I retum, I will definitely be above all of the warriors in Sky City.”

Lin Xiu turned around and smiled at Luo Yue’s parents. He looked determined as he promised them.

He would never allow her to be injured ever again!
