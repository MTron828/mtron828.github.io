Chapter 94: Black Sea City!

‘Damn!’

Lin Xiu cursed. He was like a broken kite as he flew out and knocked against the tree behind.

“You’re trying to kill me.” Lin Xiu was in a little pain as he got up and retorted angrily.

“Don’t you think your defense has grown stronger?” Baili Haoling smiled and asked.

Hearing his words, Lin Xiu then realized that after being hit by such a strong impact, he should be hurt, but he didn’t expect that he only felt a slight pain from knocking against the tree.

“That’s what the source strength does. You can wrap it around the weapon, and of course, you can envelop your body with it too,” Baili Haoling said.

“Your source strength is still very weak now, you can see it when you cover your eyes with source strength. Your source strength is like white gas, right?”

Lin Xiu nodded. It was like he was a super Saiyan and it made him sweaty.

“As the source strength in your body gets stronger, the source strength of warriors rank 3 and above would appear green, and blue for those rank 6 and above. But I don’t know what color would a rank 9 warrior’s source strength be,” Baili Haoling said.

Lin Xiu nodded. It was a little easier to distinguish a warrior’s rank this way.

“Alright, tonight’s training is… to get beaten!”

‘Get beaten!?’

Before Lin Xiu could react, Baili Haoling’s fist went over!

Time went by quickly and it was the next morning. With a pair of panda eyes, Lin Xiu glared at Baili Haoling who was walking in front.

*Cough cough* “This was an accident.” Baili Haoling looked straight ahead and said softly.

“Okay, let’s get back to training! Tonight, our goal is to reach Black Sea City!” In order to change the subject, Baili Haoling stood on top of the android wolf with his left hand on his waist, and right hand pointing to the front.

If this guy tied his hair in pigtails, he would look like tsundere lolita. But the thought of him being gay gave Lin Xiu the chills.

Previously, Lin Xiu did think about whether Baili Haoling could be a woman, but it was quite unlikely, after all, his chest was too flat…

Xing Yao City.

“Mubai is dead… Mubai is dead…!?” At this moment, an old man who looked very capable sat on a chair and said with a look of disbelief.

“Yes, the lord’s body and the bodies of several members of the family were found outside the Xing Yao City. I think it’s that boy named Lin Xiu…” A middle-aged man stood respectfully on the side and said, his forehead was covered in cold sweat.

He knew that Tang Mubai was going to ambush Lin Xiu, but did not think that Tang Mubai and everyone else would die!

“Lin Xiu…!”Hearing this name, the old man’s eyes revealed a murderous intent and he crushed the teacup completely. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Do you know where he is?” The old man took a deep breath and looked at the middle-aged man.

The middle-aged man felt the old man’s murderous intent and kept trembling. At this moment, he quickly said, “If he went out in that direction, he should be at Black Sea City. Also, the warrior test is coming up within these few days, he must have gone there.”

“Black Sea City, huh…” The old man’s eyes narrowed like that of a snakewhich made the middle-aged man feel a chill down his spine.

“I have an old friend at Black Sea City, and this time, I want Lin Xiu to meet a tragic end!!!”

The Black Sea City was a city more prosperous than Xing Yao City and was named after an ocean called the ‘Black Sea’.

“Finally… we’ve finally arrived.” Lin Xiu looked at the tall, eerie wall in front of him that was made with special metal and gasped.

From the morning to now, he didn’t even know how many kilometers he had run, and he had to constantly kill evolved beasts along the way to train. He was extremely worn out.

After the two men had passed a virus-detecting scan in front, they went in.

Probably because the warrior qualification exam was to be held here, Black Sea City became exceptionally lively.

There were lights all around making the whole city particularly eye-catching.

And there were a lot of people, the place was bustling and very lively.

Compared with Xing Yao City, Black Sea City covered a much larger area and they were more prosperous.

“I haven’t been here in more than a decade.” At this moment, Baili Haoling stretched lazily and looked around happily.

“More than a decade? You were born here?” Lin Xiu was stunned and asked.

“Take a guess.” Baili Haoling glanced at Lin Xiu and smirked.

“Tsk, forget it, then.” Lin Xiu curled his lips.

When Lin Xiu came over, many people looked at him.

They paid attention not to Lin Xiu, but to the android wolf next to him.

Many people cast covetous eyes on it.

“Let’s go over there and take a look.” Baili Haoling looked at the shop at the corner and his eyes lit up, then he ran inside.

Lin Xiu looked up at the store called: “Hidden Treasures Pavilion”

The three words were in bold cursive calligraphy and it looked very grand.

But he wasn’t sure if there were really treasures inside?

“Welcome to the Hidden Treasures Pavilion!” The moment Lin Xiu entered, a man with small mustache hurried over with glistening eyes.

The shop covered a large area, and there were a lot of warriors inside who seemed to be buying something.

Next to the glass cabinets around the place, there were many cards.

“We have a lot of skill cards in the Hidden Treasures Pavilion, Odd Crystals, weapons, and even combat uniforms. May I know what do you require…” The little mustache man looked at Lin Xiu and said.

“I’ll take a look around.” Lin Xiu shook his head and said.

It felt like he was in a supermarket and the attendant kept following him around, it made him very uncomfortable.

The mustache man also seemed to know what Lin Xiu was thinking and didn’t bother him anymore.

“Why are they all silver skill cards?” Looking at these skill cards, Baili Haoling curled his lips in displeasure.

“Young man, the cultivation of silver skills is very difficult and I’m afraid you still can’t cultivate gold skills at your level.” An attendant laughed as he looked at Baili Haoling.

“Do you have any diamond skills?” Instead of paying heed to his words, Baili Haoling asked loudly.

“Diamond skill?” The attendant was taken aback, then shook his head and smiled. “There might not be that type of skill card in the whole of Black Sea City.”

If anything, it would probably be regarded as the treasure of the shop, right?
