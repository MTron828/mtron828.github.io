Chapter 591: The Final Test

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“So tired.”

Lin Xiu stretched, touched his mouth and found that he had already grown a stubble.

Lin Xiu smiled bitterly.

He wasn’t sure how long he had stayed at this Tower of trial and had actually read all the books already.

The Analytic Eye was called the Analytic Eye not only because it was able to find out the rank of an evolved beast or warrior, but it was also very helpful for reading and understanding.

Now, Lin Xiu could say with no hesitation that he had already input all the information from the books he read into his own mind.

“Senior, I have already read all the books here!” Lin Xiu looked around.

“‘Sword Quotation’ What is on the 23rd page?”

At this time, a voice came over.

“Basic sword-play – stab, mainly talking about stabbing and...”

Lin Xiu heard this question and replied.

The facts mentioned tally to every detail and he didn’t pause at all.

“What is the fifth row, 11th book of ‘knife’?”

“Knife theory.”

...

That voice continued posing questions and each time he asked, Lin Xiu could accurately answer.

After dozens of times, that person stopped asking.

Just when Lin Xiu’s looked over, he found that the guy wearing a cloak just now appeared in front of him.

“How did you do it?”

He looked at Lin Xiu, full of disbelief.

These books could not be printed on the skill cards then imprinted on a person’s mind.

One had to rely on memory to remember all the content.

“I just memorize them.” Lin Xiu smiled.

Actually, it was the ability of Analytic Eye that Lin Xiu could remember all the contents.

Now Lin Xiu could be said to be a mobile library.

“Very good.” The man suddenly laughed at this time.

“So can I leave now?”

Lin Xiu said at this time. To be honest, although the information here was precious, Lin Xiu was still a bit disappointed.

Because what he needed now was strength, the strength to become a rank 8 warrior quickly!

He originally thought that there was a way to get his strength quickly, there wasn’t.

However, this was also fortunate, all the knowledge here could be said to be very useful for his cultivation path ahead.

“You can go at first, but now, no.”

The man stopped smiling, then glanced at Lin Xiu.

“Why?” Lin Xiu brows wrinkled, then he asked.

Although he had the Analytic Eye and could memorize and understand all these books here faster than the average person, there were too many books here and Lin Xiu was also practicing with various weapons while memorizing.

He wasn’t very good at using other weapons right now but he was still proficient.

“You can go to the top.” The man looked at Lin Xiu with a fanatical look on his face.

“The top?”

“Didn’t you say that this is the top level?”

Lin Xiu was a little bit confused.

“Come with me.”

The man said quietly, then walked over to the front. Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

There was a staircase that led to the top, but Lin Xiu had tried to go to this staircase while he was there and found that the staircase seemed to have a layer of invisible barrier, so Lin Xiu couldn’t go up at all.

Following the man, Lin Xiu found that the transparent barrier disappeared and he had access to go up!

“This is...”

After walking up and opening a door above, Lin Xiu saw a glaring shine.

“Come over.”

This middle-aged man went in and said faintly.

Although his tone was flat, Lin Xiu was still able to hear the excitement hidden in his speech.

What happened to him?

However, Lin Xiu did not think further, directly went in and glanced around.

The surroundings were white and the white light was very glaring and Lin Xiu saw something.

When he came to this middle-aged man, he saw that in the middle of this place, there was a big silver column.

There was a very large glass ball and there something floating inside that gave off a white glow.

What is this?

Lin Xiu looked at this thing and his eyes widened.

“Do you want strength?”

The man turned around and looked at Lin Xiu, then said.

Lin Xiu of course wanted strength, but he always had a weird feeling about this man.

“What’s this?”

Lin Xiu did not answer his question, but looked at the thing in this glass.

Just standing here, Lin Xiu could feel the power of this ball.

Standing here, he felt a sort of suppression by this energy.

This was very surprising.

“Founder.” The man’s eyes looked at the white light, then said a little excited.

Founder?

Lin Xiu brows wrinkled and didn’t know what he said.

“Baili Tao and those old guys came here before but they have not completed the final test.”

The man said at this time.

“But I think you can.”

Test?

Lin Xiu raised his brows, then carefully thought about it. According to what he said before, could it be that this Tower of Trial appeared just for people who had passed the test?

“What do I have to do?”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, then said to him.

Now he needed strength.

“Very good, put your hands here.” The middle-aged man nodded, then got Lin Xiu to extend his hands and put them on the glass sphere.

Lin Xiu thought about it. It didn’t feel dangerous so he stretched out his hands and placed it directly on the glass ball.

The moment he placed them on it, , Lin Xiu felt a stinging sensation.

Lin Xiu wanted to retract his hands instinctively but found that his hand couldn’t be taken back and they were sucked in.

This situation was too weird.

“Don’t be nervous, use your mind to communicate.” The man looked at him.

Hearing the man’s voice, Lin Xiu took a deep breath and closed his eyes.

Communicate, how to communicate?
