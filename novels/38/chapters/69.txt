Chapter 70: New Skill – Adjudicate!!!

Gift Pack! Gift Pack had appeared!

Lin Xiu immediately became ecstatic when he saw that. The last time, the quick growth gift pack had bestowed him a lot of benefits, who knew what would be in this gift pack now?

Lin Xiu held his breath, and with a thought, he hit the draw prize button in the center. The lottery wheel immediately started to spin!

Three gift packs section, three skill cards, three weapons, and a grand prize.

The chance of obtaining a gift pack was 30%, which was quite high.

‘Come to me, Gift Pack!!!’

As the needle turned slower and slower, Lin Xiu clenched his teeth.

His luck was great this time and the needle turned to the Gift Pack!

“Awesome!” Lin Xiu stood up in excitement.

Fortunately, he was the only one in the resting area, otherwise, people who saw him would think that he was crazy.

“Congratulations Master, you have obtained a ‘skill card’ Gift Pack!

As Lin Xiu touched on the prize, a gigantic gift bag appeared in front of him. It was the same as the last time.

Skill card gift pack?

Lin Xiu searched inside the red gift pack and three shiny skill cards appeared in front of him.

Two of them were silver cards, one was a spear skill called Rainbow Pierces the Sun, a saber skill called Yin Yang Slash, and a bronze sword skill Tidal Frost Strike.

“Rainbow Pierces the Sun?” Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up when he saw the spear skill. After scrutinizing it, he realized that this single strike could greatly raise his own speed and unleash a powerful strike.

Lin Xiu frowned, this skill looked good, but it was inferior to Torrential storm of rose flowers.

He could not use the sword or saber skill, but did he want the spear skill?

Lin Xiu suddenly had an idea as he recalled the Synthesis System.

‘Should I… give it a try?’

Upon thinking about it, Lin Xiu immediately moved to the Synthesis System in his mind and took out the silver skill card from before and the two new silver skill cards.

The three silver skill cards floated in the air.

“Please choose your skill card type.”

A notification rang out in his head, and the system immediately revealed various skill selections.

Lin Xiu chose Spear without hesitation.

“Confirm to proceed?”

“Confirm!”

Lin Xiu hit the confirmation button and a ray of light immediately engulfed him and the cards as the three silver cards merged together.

A piercing light aura came out and caused Lin Xiu to squint.

In the next moment, the three silver skill cards transformed into 1 silver skill card.

“Congratulations Master for the success of merging skill cards!”

Lin Xiu immediately took the floating skill card.

The silver skill card had a black figure on the surface. This figure was tall and built and held a spear, as though he was able to strike out of the card, he was filled with threat and might.

The silver skill card had a large golden word at the center – Adjudicate!

“This name sounds rather powerful…” Lin Xiu gulped down saliva and muttered to himself. Although it was a silver skill card, it looked rather powerful.

Since he still had the time, Lin Xiu placed the card at his head, and a large amount of information started to flow in.

As he absorbed the information from the skill card, the surface of the card became extremely ordinary.

Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up. This skill was as it sounded, it seemed extremely powerful!!! Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Time passed quickly and noon came. The school had already implemented disciplinary actions regarding Ye Gulin’s action of harming people.

Although it was just a disciplinary action, it meant that the five great schools would no longer accept this student. This became the most unbearable punishment for Ye Gulin.

The new round of competitions had begun, 25 out of 50 would move on!

“Lin Xiu, quickly, the competition is about to begin!” Right then, Luo Li waved his hands at Lin Xiu.

“Hmm.” Lin Xiu nodded his head and headed towards the competition platform.

Many students had gathered towards Lin Xiu’s competition grounds as news of him defeating Ye Gulin had spread.

He had definitely become a legendary figure, from the school’s rock bottom to winning the 4th ranker of the school, who would dare question his abilities now?

In this round, Lin Xiu was faced off against a girl who used two rings as weapons.

“Both parties, get ready! Let the competition… begin!”

The referee gave the order, but both parties stood still.

Lin Xiu became suspicious, the girl continued to stare at him but did not do anything, and he could not feel any battle intent from her.

“Lin Xiu?!” The girl’s eyes lit up as she looked at him.

Lin Xiu nodded his head. Right at this moment, The girl charged forward.

‘So it has begun?’

Lin Xiu held onto his spear tightly and was prepared to attack when he realized the girl hugged him, then planted a kiss on his face, and laughed. “My idol! I admit defeat!”

With that said, she jumped down the stage with a flushed face.

Lin Xiu was stunned but started to laugh out loud. ‘What was that all about?!’

All the student spectators below started to create a disturbance.

Lin Xiu did not know that after his experiences were listed in the forums, he became extremely popular, especially the fact that he was good-looking earned him many female fans in the school.

“Lin Xiu… wins!” The referee’s mouth was twitching as he announced the winner. He looked at Lin Xiu in envy.

“Hehe, Lin Xiu, how was the taste of that?” Right at this time, Yang Tian gave him a cheeky smile as Lin Xiu walked down.

“Scram!” Lin Xiu glared at the cheeky guy and replied.

He had initially wanted a fight and did not expect the situation to turn out as such.

He rubbed his own cheek that was still slightly warm.

But he could not think about it. The Lin Xiu that had transmigrated never felt safe.

‘I have to be strong, I have to keep getting stronger!’

Very quickly, the round ended and they started drawing lots again.

The next round would determine 12 out of the 25. As there was an additional person, a group would have one winner out of three participants.

“Haha, the lots have been drawn. Lin Xiu, if you’re up against a quasi-warrior, you’ll definitely win!” Yang Tian looked at the 3D image and became excited.

As the lots ended, Luo Li’s eyes became big.

“Jiang Tao, Zhu Jun?!”
