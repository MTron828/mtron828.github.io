Chapter 51: The Age of Machines

“Your arms are injured, and although the powder is applied, it will take at least a day for it to recover.” Xu Wen handed him a bowl of broth.

Although the drugs in the current world were much more advanced than in the former world, it wasn’t so easy for an injury like Lin Xiu’s to recover.

“Thank you.” Lin Xiu took the bowl of broth cooked with evolved beast’s flesh and couldn’t help but to gnaw on the meat and swallow the broth in one gulp.

The sweet soup and tender meat made Lin Xiu lick his lips, looking as if he wanted more.

A while later, after everyone rested, they decided to go on a ‘clean-up’ mission again.

“Your injury…” Li Yi said worriedly as he looked at Lin Xiu picking up his Silver Immortal Soul spear again.

“It won’t get in the way.” Lin Xiu shook his head. His wound had almost healed, and as long as he didn’t do any vigorous exercise, the wound would not break open.

And he didn’t want to be a burden to the team.

“Okay.” Xu Wen nodded. It would take too long if they waited for Lin Xiu’s wound to recover. Upon seeing that Lin Xiu appeared fine, they continued on their journey forward.

They had cleared almost all the zombies around the area and were probably left with the zombies in the corner.

“If you throw a nuclear bomb down, the monsters here would be wiped out, right? Then we wouldn’t have to spend so much time cleaning up,” Li Yi said with a wry smile.

After a night’s rest, they had to face these monsters again. Thinking about those sinister faces really gave them goosebumps.

“Did you think that a nuclear bomb wasn’t used to clean up this place before?” Lin Xiu stood in the middle and laughed.

“What do you mean?” The rest of the soldiers looked curiously at Lin Xiu.

They really didn’t know that a nuclear bomb was used to clean up District A20 before.

“Deep in District A20, the federal army used a nuclear bomb to ‘clean up’ before, which turned the city into ruins. However, the monsters didn’t die completely and many of the remaining monsters became even scarier because of the nuclear contamination.”

“We’re only at the border now and the places that the instructors went should be deeper inside.”

Although the textbooks did not mention District A20, Lin Xiu still managed to gain a lot of knowledge in this area from other places.

Although the former Lin Xiu was useless, he was really knowledgeable and was a walking encyclopedia.

“I see…” Li Yi felt fearful after listening to Lin Xiu. Monsters that couldn’t even be killed by nuclear bombs – just how strong were they?

Just thinking about it made him fearful.

As they continued walking ahead, the surrounding architectural style seemed to have changed in an instant, it was completely different.

The houses here had a lot of gears and had a strong mechanical style.

There were also a large number of flattened or rusty machines around.

Up ahead, there was a long railroad track and even had broken sections of steam trains.

“My goodness...” Li Yi’s eyes widened in surprise when he saw this scene.

“In the year 2701, during the war with the alien invaders, there was a special era of vintage steam machines that uses Odd Crystals as a new source of energy to make all kinds of machines.” The information came to Lin Xiu’s mind as he looked at this scene.

“I see.” Xu Wen nodded, and then looked around curiously.

Stepping on the ground, there were a lot of clacking sounds made by the pieces of scrap metals before they broke into pieces.

“It should be quite some time ago.” Lin Xiu mumbled to himself as he looked around.

There were still some weapons left behind like long swords, machetes, and more, but the bodies of those weapons seemed to be made up of gears that looked strange.

When Li Yu picked up a long sword, he saw dents above the handle of the sword.

“What kind of sword is this?” Li Yi looked at a large number of gears on this sword; there were small and large ones, they also had a strange machine structure like it was a mechanical sword.

Looking at this strange weapon, he couldn’t help but stare closely.

“Do you have an Odd Crystal?” Lin Xiu asked.

“Yes.” Xu Wen did not think much and directly tossed an Odd Crystal to him. This was hunted in the morning before Lin Xiu had woken up.

Lin Xiu took that Odd Crystal and it felt cold to the touch. This Odd Crystal wasn’t large but it was heavy.

Lin Xiu pondered for a moment, then placed the Odd Crystal into the groove above the handle of that mechanical sword.

The size was actually perfect.

Everyone around him looked closely at this scene. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

Click——

At the back of the mechanical sword, there was a button that could be pressed. As Lin Xiu pressed the button, the gears on the body of the sword began to turn slowly, making a sound that made people clench their teeth.

“It’s moving! It’s moving!” Li Yi exclaimed.

Soon, the gear seemed to turn faster and faster, and in the next second, it emitted a bright white light and enveloped the mechanical sword blade.

“This... What is it?” A soldier called out, his mouth wide open in surprise.

It was simply amazing.

“Weapons that use Odd Crystals as energy.” Lin Xiu said indifferently, then slashed the sword gently toward a metal block at the side.

Ss ss——

A strange sound rang out at this moment, and at the same time, that mechanical sword sent out wisps of white smoke, leaving a deep crack.

“It’s quite sharp.” Xu Wen was a little surprised. The sharpness of this mechanical sword could already block off weapons made with high-grade materials.

Even his own saber probably couldn’t cause a crack on this metal block so easily.

It was like slicing a piece of tofu.

“Click”, as Lin Xiu pressed the button again, the mechanical sword stopped rotating in an instant.

The light that came out disappeared in that instant.

“It’s powerful, but it consumes too many Odd Crystals, and this kind of mechanical sword had already been phased out a hundred years ago.” Lin Xiu looked at the Odd Crystal in the groove that was apparently smaller and shook his head.

This steam period was only a special period that came up during the battle against the aliens, and it was eventually eliminated.

However, according to historical records, during that period, there had also been a lot of very combative mechanical giants; if you could find a complete product like that, you would have found treasure.
