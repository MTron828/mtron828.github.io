Chapter 688 I Will Be Participating

“Hmm? Was I hallucinating…?

As Lin Xiu looked at the moon that was far far away, he could suddenly see Luo Yue.

It seemed as if she was lying on a bed.

Lin Xiu shook his head and saw the moons that were outside his room and realised that he was still on Marqi Planet.

“How long would it take for me to reach Fengyun City….?”

The warriors in Fengyun City were indeed much more powerful than the ones that he had met.

“Respected warriors huh? Interesting.”

After getting a good night’s rest, Lin Xiu woke up early the next day. There were two suns in the sky that were shining brightly. The rays shone through his window and landed on Lin Xiu’s body.

It caused Lin Xiu to feel warm.

“It’s already 7.”

Lin Xiu looked at the clock and saw that it was 7 in the morning.

It’s about time. The Warrior Competition will be held today.

“Brother Lin, you’re awake?”

As soon as he walked out of his room, he saw Chen Lan and the rest in the lobby.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and asked, “Where’s Lei Chong?”

“I think he’s still in bed…”

Chen Lan looked around and could not find Lei Chong anywhere in the lobby. “I’m so sleepy….”

Before he could finish her sentence, Lei Chong walked into the lobby while stretching his back.

“Morning.”

Lei Choong looked at the others gathered around the table and laughed.

“Come. Let’s have something to eat.”

Chen Lan got the waiter to prepare food for them when he saw Lei Chong walking towards them.

Lei Chong, what are your plans?”

Lin Xiu was tearing into a special bun made on the Marqi Planet as he asked.

The bun was soft but once placed into his mouth, Lin Xiu thought that it tasted weird, something that he couldn’t enjoy.

“Plans….. I don’t know yet.”

When Lei Chong heard Lin Xiu’s question, he was stunned for a moment before he looked down and shook his head.

He initially came to the Marqi Planet in hopes to find his young son but he didn’t think that those on this planet would discriminate against earthlings in such a horrible manner.

The worse thing was how the warriors on this planet were much stronger.

The warriors in this small city, known as Tianlong City, were already so strong that they were comparable to those in Sky City.

Forget about those in the bigger cities.

“Oh right, Brother Lin, brother Lei, why did you both decide to come to Marqi planet?”

Chen Lan asked all of a sudden.

“I’m sorry. I was just curious.” Chen Lan noticed that he was being rude and quickly apologised. “We’re here to look for someone.” Lei Chong did not hide their intentions and told the truth.

“Who are you trying to look for? I might be able to help since I get news from time to time.”

Chen Lan continued asking

Since Lin Xiu was the one who saved them yesterday, he felt that he should at least help if he could.

“Have you heard of the Galaxy Smugglers?” Lei Chong asked with a solemn look on his face.

“The galaxy smugglers?” Chen Lan was stunned and the look on his face changed as he seemed to have thought of something. “I’ve heard of them before. This group of smugglers are a huge corporation all over the galaxy. Not only would they look for treasures from all over the galaxy, they would also kidnap children.” “That’s right.”

“My son. They took my son.” As Lei Chong spoke about it, he clenched onto his fist and dug his nails into his palm.

It was obvious that he was now fuming mad.

“I don’t think I can help with that.” Chen Lai sympathised with Lei Chong but there was nothing that he could do.

“I understand.”

Lei Chong didn’t have much hope in regards to this issue since the Galaxy Smugglers were a huge, sneaky group. They were well hidden and there weren’t many people who could find them.

He had only received news that they were here which is why they got to Marqi Planet.

“I’ll take my time.”

He smiled and picked up a teacup, finishing the drink in one go.

The tea tasted bitter.

“What about Brother Lin?” Chen Lan looked over at Lin Xiu before asking hesitantly.

“I know where the person is.” Lin Xiu said calmly. “Where?”

Chen Lan as well as Zhang Hu and Su Qiang were curious as well.

Lin Xiu was such a young man and a warrior that was extremely powerful. He should be someone powerful back on earth as well, a man with a strong family background. Why did he come all the way here to Marqi Planet looking for someone?

Chen Lan glared at the both of them and the both of them noticed that they may have asked too much.

“It’s alright.”

Lin Xiu drank some tea before answering.

“The person that I’m looking for is in Fengyun City.” “Fengyun City?!”

As soon as Lin Xiu answered, all three of them were extremely shocked.

“Why do all of you look so surprised? Fengyun City? Where’s that?”

Lei Chong asked out of curiousity.

He had just got here and didn’t know much about the places here.

“Fengyus City is the biggest City here in Marqi Planet. The King is in that city.”

Chen Lan gulped as he started feeling nervous.

“The King is the strongest Respecter Warrior on this planet?”

Lei Chong continued asking.

“That’s right! According to what I know, the King could even break air into two with his sword.”

Chen Lan’s eyes were filled with admiration as he spoke about it.

In the warrior’s world, they would always respect the stronger ones and admired those who were strongest. This was something natural.

“Also, the Fengyun City is where all the strongest warriors would gather together. It is not compared to Tianlong City.” Chen Lan explained.

“Right… Brother Lin, when are you planning to go there?”

Chen Lan thought of something and asked Lin Xiu.

“In a few days.”

Lin Xiu thought for a moment before answering him. “I don’t think it will be possible for the next few days.”

Chen Lan told Lin Xiu.

“Because of the Warrior Competition that would be held, the King will be choosing the best warriors to enter the city so that he can train them and polish them. So, most of the routes to Fengyun City have been blocked.”

“I know but isn’t there another way?”

Lin Xiu nodded his head and asked. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“You’re talking about…”

“I will be participating in the warrior competition.”

Lin Xiu stood up, picked up his spear and looked outside the window.

From what he can see, the Tianlong City was filled with warriors.

It looked like there was a huge crowd.
