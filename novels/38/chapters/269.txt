Chapter 270: Killing The Chicken To Warn The Monkey

“Dimensional items.” Guo Ling’s eyes changed as she commented.

According to the information they had gathered, these things could fall to earth as well.

They were also filled with a lot of energy.

And the energy could be absorbed using special methods.

According to historical text, there was an extremely powerful warrior that absorbed a lotus fire that was ice white.

This warrior became extremely powerful and even tempered his flesh body.

“A 100 million for this!?” Qiu Li immediately inhaled a breath of cold air when he heard the news.

100 million was not a small amount.

One could only imagine how precious the item was for someone to be willing to fork out so much money.

It was no wonder that so many warriors would gather here.

Even a fool would know that they were here for this item.

“We have to be careful this time.” Guo Ling was silent for a moment before speaking out.

The more warriors that came, the more dangerous it was for them.

Not every warrior was righteous, there were some that were scheming and evil and would steal and rob others.

This made things even more dangerous.

“En.” Qiu Li and the others were aware of the situation and nodded their heads earnestly.

The group carried on ahead on their Android Battle Tigers and quickly left the town.

Right at this time, Lin Xiu was able to see a black region in the distance.

It was a densely packed black forest!

Even the ground seemed to be slightly black.

“Is that Dark Forest?”

Lin Xiu saw and asked in surprise.

Ahead of them was a boundless and vast ocean of densely packed trees, as though they were standing at a beach and staring out at black waters.

“That’s right, we are already in the Dark Forest region from here on out. Everyone, let’s be careful.” Guo Ling nodded her head and replied with a serious look on her face.

Rollie crawled out of Lin Xiu’s bag, having seemed to have sensed something. It revealed its ball body and looked around carefully.

“Hahaha, kids, you guys are heading into the Dark Forest too? Be careful and don’t die inside!”

A group of warriors walked over towards Lin Xiu’s group and started laughing out loud when they saw how young they were.

Qiu Li and the others frowned at their words, as though they were unhappy.

Guo Ling looked at Qiu Li and the others. They immediately understood her thoughts and nodded their heads.

They were venturing into Dark Forest to look for Snow silkworms. It was not wise for them to act up against the others.

“I think that you guys will die first.” Lin Xiu glanced at the middle-aged man who laughed at them and replied indifferently.

The warriors that were laughing immediately had changes in expressions when they heard his words.

The middle-aged man that laughed out the loudest felt as though he had been embarrassed. He walked right in front of Lin Xiu and opened his eyes wide, “Brat, you want to die?!”

He was infuriated at the fact that the brat dared to refute him.

Guo Ling and the others stopped moving and looked at Lin Xiu. Before they could even react, Lin Xiu made his move.

Sou-

Before he could react, a cold aura flashed past his eyes.

He felt a piercing pain on his head and realized that a black spear was laying on his forehead.

As long as Lin Xiu exerted a bit of force, his brain would have been pierced through.

“You…”

The middle-aged man trembled, he did not think that Lin Xiu would use his spear right off the bat without even retorting.

The even more terrifying fact was Lin Xiu’s spear was too fast.

His forehead had been pricked by Lin Xiu’s spear before he could even react. If Lin Xiu accidentally exerted a bit of strength, the sharp spear tip would break into his head!

“Another word and I’ll kill you. Look at me, I’ll kill you. Move a slight inch, I’ll kill you.” Lin Xiu’s eyes revealed a cold intent as he spoke up indifferently.

Large beads of perspiration started to trickle down the middle-aged man’s forehead when he heard Lin Xiu’s words.

He did not dare move an inch.

He knew that Lin Xiu was not bragging and would kill him if he disobeyed his words.

His companions were equally shocked by the sudden change of events.

Lin Xiu’s spear had been too fast and not a single one of them would have been able to dodge it! 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Terrifying, he was too terrifying.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu suddenly retracted his spear and spoke to Guo Ling and the others.

It was only then did they regain their senses.

They nodded their heads in agreement.

Lin Xiu’s movement had shocked them.

Lin Xiu kept his spear and rode on his Android Battle Tiger to the other side.

The middle-aged man stood in his original position until Lin Xiu’s group left before falling straight to the ground from his weak legs.

“Let…us go…”

The man recalled his near-death experience and immediately felt a shadow in his heart. He no longer dared to enter Dark Forest.

There were many warriors and they witnessed the scene. They no longer dared to look down on Lin Xiu’s group.

“Rest easy, my actions have lessened the number of people with ill intent on us.” Lin Xiu looked at Goo Ling and the others and said.

They finally understood what Lin Xiu meant.

They looked around and noticed that none of the people around them dared to look towards their directions any longer.

“They really think we’re that easy to provoke!” Qiu Li clenched his fists and said.

There were many cases of warriors killing others to rob and steal.

Lin Xiu had intentionally caused a ruckus to set an example for the others.

“Here we are, Dark Forest.”

As they continued to move ahead, Guo Ling suddenly spoke up when they saw the black trees nearby.
