Chapter 816: The Contestant Is... Luo Yue!

Qian Jin’s eyes widened, but at this time, it seemed that there was no way to dodge it!

boom–

With his slashing, Qian Jin’s arm was chopped off immediately!

“I surrender!!!”

At this moment, Qian Jin shouted loudly.

Qian Lin ignored Qian Jin’s words and continued to wave his sword.

Qian Jin’s body was about to be chopped in half!

Dang–

But at this moment, the referee slapped his sword away and said coldly, “According to the rules, the opponent has conceded and the game is over.”

“Humph! Good luck to you.”

Qian Lin said a little unwillingly.

Qian Jin’s face was pale at this time, he took his severed arm and followed the medical staff to treat him.

“Don’t let me see you.”

Qian Lin looked at Lin Xiu below, raised his head at this time and said coldly.

Lin Xiu looked at him and narrowed his eyes.

He was a little angry.

The competition is still going on, Qian Jin has already been eliminated and now in this venue, only Lin Xiu was a contestant from Tianlong City.

Most of the rank 9 warriors were eliminated and the rest were almost all warriors at the master warrior level.

“Next, picking 9 warriors out of 18 warriors.”

“The first group, No. 18 Lin Xiu, against No. 6 Qian Lin!”

As the referee’s voice came over, the corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth curled up.

Qian Lin’s eyes also showed a vicious look and sure enough, he really encountered Lin Xiu.

“Can the two contestants come on stage please!”

At this time, as the referee’s voice came over again, Lin Xiu jumped directly onto the competition stage.

“Hehe, this time, you won’t be as lucky as your friend. I’ll give you no chance to admit defeat.” Qian Lin stared at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

“Similarly, I will give you this sentence as well.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“Humph!”

Qian Lin snorted coldly and the whole body’s source strength was mobilized.

“Match begins!”

swoosh—

As the referee’s words just fell, at this moment, Lin Xiu and Qian Lin moved at the same time, holding the weapons in their hands and attacking.

Because of Lin Xiu’s powerful strength just now, many spectators were watching this game with fixated eyes.

Why is a man with black eyes so strong!?

Dang dang-

The spear in Lin Xiu’s hand stabbed out and Qian Lin kept resisting with the blade of the sword.

This Qian Lin’s strength is really good and he can fight against Lin Xiu with ease.

“Humph! You only have this strength?

When Qian Lin resisted Lin Xiu’s attack again, he turned around and slashed at Lin Xiu’s body.

But he was dodged by Lin Xiu who responded quickly.

“Bluegrass field!”

Qian Lin looked at Lin Xiu, who had dodged his attack and roared and a blue light burst out from his body, then covered the ground.

Soon, a large amount of bluegrass grew on the ground.

These grasses were very long and thick and they all stabbed towards Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu raised his brows, his body moved and his movement became active and he kept dodging.

“Source mark power – ‘Immortal Lock up’!

Qian Lin didn’t stop moving and continued to release the source mark power.

He wanted to kill Lin Xiu directly!

As his words just fell, a purple light appeared on his forehead.

And at this moment, this purple light burst out and directly impacted Lin Xiu, turning into many long, purple energy bodies.

What kind of source mark power is this!?

Lin Xiu’s expression changed slightly when he felt the scene.

These strip-shaped energy bodies rushed over in an instant.

Lin Xiu wanted to dodge, but soon, he was bound by this light.

His body couldn’t move!

“Go!!!”

Moreover, all the terrifying bluegrass that grew flew towards Lin Xiu.

In an instant, Lin Xiu was wrapped around him like a dumpling.

“Hng, that’s all huh.”

Seeing this scene, Qian Lin couldn’t help but sneer.

Then he stretched out his right hand and squeezed it suddenly, “Die!”

The bluegrass that wrapped around Lin Xiu’s body immediately spun frantically.

It was like twisted in an instant!

The people inside must have been totally twisted!

“I thought he’s so powerful and he just died like this?”

“Hahaha, pariahs are just pariahs after all!”

...

When the audience saw this scene, they immediately laughed.

“Referee, announce the result.”

At this time, Qian Lin looked at the referee over there and said lightly.

Now Lin Xiu was definitely twisted.

Boom—

But at this moment, a huge sound rang out and the bluegrass burst directly.

A figure appeared again.

The bluegrass created by his domain force and source mark power seemed to have all been destroyed by Lin Xiu.

“You...”

Qian Lin watched this scene, his eyes widened and his eyes were filled with incomparable shock.

How could it be, how could he not die!

“Just this level of power huh.”

Lin Xiu patted his clothes, then said lightly.

The surrounding audience was also dumbfounded at this time.

“Courting death!”

Qian Lin roared angrily, then holding the long sword in his hand, he directly charged over!

swoosh—

Before he could rush to Lin Xiu’s side, Lin Xiu’s figure instantly turned into a black shadow, then he rushed over.

In an instant, Lin Xiu appeared behind him.

And Qian Lin’s body suddenly seemed to be frozen in place, his eyes widened.

In the next moment, the body exploded directly.

There was an uproar in the audience!

Lin Xiu, advance to the top nine!

“Are you alright?”

After the game, Lin Xiu went to the medical room and saw Qian Jin.

“It’s nothing.”

Qian Jin shook his head and said.

His arm has been attached and now he only needs to recover from the injury.

Jiang Jun also seemed to know about Qian Jin’s injury, so he also came here at this time.

“I didn’t expect that our Tianlong City, except for Lin Xiu, would be wiped out.”

Jiang Jun also sighed at this time.

“Tomorrow’s competition will be all on you.”

Jiang Jun looked at Lin Xiu and continued.

“En.”

Soon, it was the next day.

The final top 36 had finally arrived!

This time, the competition venue is Feixian stage in Fengyun City.

This place was very huge and it was suspended in the air.

The surrounding auditoriums were also full of spectators and there were no empty seats.

“Fatty, I didn’t expect that you would also advance to the top 36.”

In the waiting area for the competition, while watching the opening ceremony, he said to Liu Pan who came.

“Hehe, by a fluke, by a fluke.”

Taking a closer look at this time, in this competition area, it seems that there are still some warriors who have not come.

Lin Xiu looked at it, but he still didn’t see the figure of the person he wanted to see.

Was he wrong? Did she not compete?

Or, is she not in Fengyun City at all?

“Alright, for the first match, please come on the field, Lin Xiu, a player from Tianlong City!”

“Brother Lin, it’s you in the first match.” Liu Pan also said in surprise at this time.

Lin Xiu nodded slightly, then stood on the field.

“All the best!” Liu Pan waved his fist and said.

The top 36 should be stronger than the previous ones. Lin Xiu took a deep breath and prepared to take it seriously.

“The player he is going to face is from Xuanfeng Academy...”

“Luo Yue!!!”
