Chapter 483: I Chopped It

Some of those who got off the spacecraft looked at the zombie limbs all over the floor and said in surprise.

“According to intel, these zombies are all high-ranking zombies around rank 5 and they were transformed by those powerful soldiers who were infected in the previous century. How could it be…”

“Are they just ordinary rank 1 zombies?” Those people were puzzled at this time.

If they were rank 5 zombies, a dozen students may be required to kill just one.

But judging from the current situation, there wasn’t any student injured.

“These are rank 5 zombies.” Teacher Zhang hesitated for a moment and said aloud.

“Really rank 5 zombies?” Those people were shocked at this time.

“How did you kill them?” Director Qian looked at Teacher Zhang, then questioned.

“They saved us.” Teacher Zhang pointed to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue and said.

“They?” Hearing Teacher Zhang’s words, Director Qian and the others looked at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, and they were stunned.

Because Lin Xiu and Luo Yue both appeared to be very young, they were about the same age as these high school students.

To say that these zombies and evolved beasts were all dealt with by Lin Xiu and Luo Yue, they really couldn’t believe it for a while.

How could this be!

To be able to kill rank 5 zombies, they must be at least rank 4, right? But killing so many rank 5 zombies is impossible even for rank 5 warriors. Are they… rank 6 warriors?!

It’s impossible even if a warrior started training in his mother’s womb!

“Teacher. Zhang, are you joking?” Director Qian laughed out loud at this time, he didn’t believe what he said.

“What Teacher Zhang said is true – they saved us.” At this time, one student said aloud and the other students began to agree.

Now their eyes were full of admiration towards Lin Xiu and Luo Yue.

At this age, who hadn’t imagined being a hero and killing all those damn zombies by themselves?

They couldn’t do it, but Lin Xiu and Luo Yue did it. In their eyes, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were heroes.

“Which school are you from?” Director Qian revealed a look of surprise at this time, then walked to Lin Xiu and asked.

He seemed to be this arrogant usually and even though he was talking to Lin Xiu, a high-ranking warrior, he still had that arrogant look.

His tone didn’t seem to be asking Lin Xiu, but questioning him.

“This has nothing to do with you, right?” Lin Xiu said with a smile.

Director Qian who originally wanted to say something, choked and glared at Lin Xiu.

“Qian… Director Qian…” At this moment, a familiar voice made Director Qian turn around and he saw Zhao Xia, who was originally on the ground, struggling to stand up.

“Zhao Xia, what happened to you?” Director Qian saw Zhao Xia so battered and quickly asked.

Zhao Xia’s background was not simple, if something unexpected happens to him, it will be troublesome.

“Were you attacked by zombies?” Director Qian saw that his finger seemed to be chopped off, with traces of blood dripping down.

While observing whether Zhao Xia was infected, he kept a distance from him.

“What are you guys doing! How could you let Zhao Xia get hurt! And you two, who sent you guys? You guys only cared about killing the zombies and not saving people?” Director Qian said loudly as he sized Luo Yue and Lin Xiu up.

“I chopped it down.” Luo Yue said indifferently.

Director Qian was taken aback for a moment, then shouted loudly, “Do you know who Zhao Xia is! Do you dare to treat him like this!!!”

Director Qian could no longer care that much at this time because the Zhao family had told him to take special care of Zhao Xia. If they knew that Zhao Xia was injured, he would be in trouble.

He might not even be able to continue being the director of Bei Dou Academy.

“I’ll find your boss and lodge a complaint! Just you wait!” Director Qian roared at Luo Yue.

He thought that Lin Xiu and Luo Yue must be the elite soldiers that were sent by the Federal Government to rescue them.

As long as he complained, they were finished!

Swish——

But just as he said that, the tip of a spear appeared in front of his forehead in an instant.

“Yell at her again.” Lin Xiu had appeared in front of him and the tip of the spear was about to pierce through his forehead.

Lin Xiu just had to use a small amount of force and he could pierce through his head directly.

And even if the tip of the spear pierced his skin a little, he would be doomed.

Because the spearhead still had a lot of zombie blood, the virus concentration in the blood was very high.

“You…you…” Director Qian looked at the tip of the Dark Edge spear and his whole body trembled.

His face turned pale.

He saw the dark red blood on the spear head now.

Those are the blood of zombies, even if Lin Xiu didn’t directly stab his head with a spear, but if the sharp point of the spear scratched his forehead, he might be infected!

This kind of virus, even now, was incurable!

“Keep your mouth shut.” Ye Shuang’er was at the side and Lin Xiu wasn’t rash. Ye Shuang’er had to get along with these classmates in the future. If he went too far, these students will probably be afraid of her in the future and she wouldn’t have any friends.

Seeing Lin Linxiu move the spear away, Director Qian was relieved as his legs went limp and he fell on the ground.

Zhao Xia lowered his head, held his broken finger, his eyes were full of viciousness, but now he was silent.

Obviously, he also knew that it was impossible to deal with Lin Xiu and Luo Yue now.

Bai Di City, they will definitely go to Baidi City, when the time comes, he will kill them himself!!!

Thinking of this, Zhao Xia’s heart was filled with anger.

“Everyone, let’s leave this place now, there are still some zombies below, I don’t know if they will rush up.” Teacher Zhang saw that the atmosphere now became a little weird and stood up and said aloud at this time.

“En, everyone, get on the spacecraft first. The federal government will send someone to deal with this. After that, we’ll be fine.” The people who just got off the spacecraft also agreed at this time.
