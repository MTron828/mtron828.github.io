Chapter 707 All-out Effort!

And if he sensed carefully, all the swords that came over were focused at one point. No wonder his ‘Sphere’ was cracked.

Seeing that his ‘Sphere’ was about to be continuously impacted, and a hole was about to be broken, Lin Xiu thought about it for a while, and immediately retracted his ‘Sphere’.

“Courting death!!!” Seeing that Lin Xiu even removed the ‘Sphere’ directly, facing his skill directly, he could imagine that in the next second, Lin Xiu would be penetrated by a large number of swords. He is dead meat!

Sure enough, just as he imagined, in the next moment, a large number of swords penetrated his body.

“Hahaha!”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s body filled with a lot of swords, the old man couldn’t help laughing.

Dead! He is dead! “A mere earthling, how dare you go wild in my Tianlong City!”

But just after he was complacent for a while, he found that Lin Xiu, who had been pierced through with his sword, turned into a cloud of smoke and disappeared!

How can that be!?

The old man’s laughter stopped abruptly, replaced by a look of disbelief on his face. How could this be possible? His body was completely pierced by the sword transformed by his own skill. But why, why is he gone now! Not good! And at this time, he seemed to feel something, the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly, and the body suspended in the air wanted to dodge instinctively.

Boom–

Although his reaction speed was fast enough, at this moment, he felt a tingling pain in his shoulder, and when he looked closely, he was actually pierced by a long spear.

“Get lost.”

The old man slapped the palm directly to the back, and it happened to hit Lin Xiu’s chest.

Boom–

Lin Xiu was slapped by this palm, and his whole body fell from the air, and the Dark Edge spear was also drawn from the old man’s shoulder.

Damn…

Lin Xiu, who fell from the air to the ground, felt a sharp pain in his chest at this time.

After all, it was a blow from a Master warrior-level warrior, and Lin Xiu didn’t feel well when he was hit.

His throat was sweet and a mouthful of blood flowed out from his lips.

“Damn…”

And the old man looked at the blood-stained shoulder, accompanied by a severe tingling sensation, and the expression on his face became extremely nasty at this time.

If it wasn’t for his quick reaction just now, it wouldn’t be his shoulder that was penetrated, but his head.

Thinking of this, he couldn’t help but feel a chill down his spine.

The strength of this kid was really too terrifying

Logically speaking, when he fought Wu Changkong today, he consumed a lot of power. How could it be possible that he has returned to his peak state now?

“Die!”

The more the old man fought now, the more he felt that Lin Xiu’s strength was strange, and the tingling sensation in his shoulder made him want to kill Lin Xiu more quickly. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

NO

With a wave of his right hand, the sword flew directly back into his hand.

In the air, he directly swooped down with this sword and charged towards Lin Xiu!

Swoosh

His speed was very fast and he appeared in front of Lin Xiu in an instant.

With the sword in his hand, he slashed directly and chopped off Lin Xiu’s head!

It’s fake again!?

There was no feeling of slashing human flesh and blood, and the old man reacted quickly.

The powerful perception ability made him clearly feel where Lin Xiu was at.

His body seemed to teleport and instantly appeared on the other side.

Dang–

In the next moment, the weapons in the hands of the two collided, accompanied by a sound of metal collision and a large amount of sparks.

“What kind of skill is this?”

The old man gritted his teeth and said. His sword collided with Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear, and he actually felt Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge spear still emitting a terrifying force.

Moreover, the Dark Edge spear that Lin Xiu was holding was covered with lightning and flames.

Just the weapons colliding like this, he felt a little uncomfortable.

“Why? Want to learn?” Lin Xiu said with a sneer.

“However, with your IQ, you probably wouldn’t be able to.”

“Courting death!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s mocking words, the old man became even more furious, and the blue veins on his face surfaced.

At this time, holding the sword, he frantically attacked Lin Xiu’s body.

But Lin Xiu was not to be outdone at all, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he constantly resisted.

Although he has been promoted to a rank 9 warrior and leveled up but in a state of no fury, his strength was actually not strong.

Not to mention dealing with a warrior at the level of a master warrior. Although this old man was slightly weaker than Wu Zhangkong, this old man had too much experience in actual combat, and it made Lin Xiu feel a bit exhausted.

“Good chance!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu kept retreating when he was attacked by the old man, Lu Jian and the others, who had just been hiding on the downhill road, seemed to have seized an opportunity and attacked!

The old man also clearly noticed this scene. At this time, all the strength of the whole body was mobilized, his attack speed became faster and his strength became stronger.

Lin Xiu had no chance of counterattacking and could only keep parrying and retreating.

Go to hell!

Lu Jian saw Lin Xiu kept retreating and approaching them, his face turned sinister. In the next moment, the strength of his whole body was mobilized, his body moved, and he directly released his most powerful skill without hesitation, attacking from behind Lin Xiu!

And the same goes for the warriors beside him.

“Die!!!”

The old man who was holding the sword and kept attacking Lin Xiu, at this time, the sword in his hand also burst out with golden light.

That’s because all the source strength was concentrated on the sword.

This blow brought together the source strength of his entire body and he wanted to kill with one blow! If Lin Xiu didn’t die, he would be in a dangerous situation. If he hadn’t had the confidence to kill him, he wouldn’t have used his source strength like this. And the warriors at the back also released terrifying skills to attack Lin Xiu!

Boom

At this moment, the terrifying skills of these warriors all impacted Lin Xiu’s body.

With so many warriors using terrifying skills, the entire mountain seemed to tremble.

If it was a normal situation, Lin Xiu would definitely die.

But at this moment, they saw Lin Xiu’s body, which seemed to emit a golden light.

Lin Xiu’s whole person seems to have turned into a golden statue at this moment!
