Chapter 336: I Didn’t Know You Know How To Joke

Luo Yue gradually opened her eyes.

“You’re awake?” Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue and exclaimed happily.

“Hmm…” Luo Yue nodded gently and started to sit up.

Lin Xiu immediately supported her.

“Zhang Jie’s dead?” Luo Yue sat upright and felt the pain from her wound and frowned.

“Yea.” Lin Xiu nodded. Luo Yue’s attack had sliced Zhang Jie’s head off her body. It was impossible for Zhang Jie to remain alive after that.

Luo Yue nodded her head and looked at her own shoulder and saw that her clothes had been ripped and handled professionally.

“You did this?” Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

“Yea… you were losing too much blood.” Lin Xiu replied awkwardly.

Luo Yue’s wound was very near her chest, although Lin Xiu had no ill thoughts, now that they were talking about it, it made him embarrassed.

“Thank you.” Luo Yue did not seem bothered by it and replied.

“It’s fine.” Lin Xiu smiled but seemed to have pulled on his wound, and his smile froze.

Although his recovery was powerful and he was no longer losing blood, Lin Xiu could still feel the pain.

“How’s your wound, are you ok?” Luo Yue looked at him and asked after hesitating for a moment.

“I’m fine, it’s almost healed.” Lin Xiu shook his head.

What surprised Lin Xiu was that Luo Yue was usually ice cold, since when did she know how to care for others?

Right at this moment, a sound rang out from the side. Lin Xiu and Luo Yue who maintained their vigilance immediately turned towards the sound and were surprised.

“Roll… Rollie?” Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide in disbelief.

Because Rollie had appeared before them with many Odd Crystals all stuck on its body.

And by relying on his senses, Lin Xiu could tell that they were all rank 6 Odd Crystals!!!

Where did it get all of them from!?

“Gugu”

Rollie ran to Lin Xiu and shook its body. At this time, all the Odd Crystals dropped to the floor.

There were more than a dozen! Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Rollie picked one up and shook at Lin Xiu as though showing off its achievements.

“Powerful… Rollie.” Lin Xiu’s mouth was wide open as he commented.

Lin Xiu suddenly recalled that he had called Rollie to look for Odd Crystals. It was a casual remark and he did not expect Rollie to find so many of them.

They were even of extremely good quality.

“This thing is really mystical.” Luo Yue looked at Rollie and commented.

She extended her finger and touched Rollie.

Rollie immediately leaped onto Lin Xiu’s arm after being touched by Luo Yue, as though frightened of her.

Lin Xiu laughed, “It thinks that you want to dissect him.”

“I really want to study it.” Luo Yue nodded her head and replied.

Rollie immediately carried an Odd Crystals and jumped into Lin Xiu’s bag.

As though it was truly afraid of being dissected.

“I didn’t know that you know how to joke.” Lin Xiu chuckled.

Luo Yue’s eyes changed and regained her coldness, she then replied to him, “Recover your strength.”

“Hmm, after absorbing all these Odd Crystals, we should leave tomorrow morning.” Lin Xiu nodded. They had to regain their strength as they did not know when other warriors would come.

Lin Xiu took the rank 6 Odd Crystals and closed his eyes to absorb the energy.

Luo Yue did the same.

Seconds passed as the duo absorbed all the Odd Crystals’ energy and recovered their strength.

Their wounds also started to heal.

Early next morning, Lin Xiu stretched himself and opened his eyes to see the glaring sunlight.

The weather was good and sunlight had penetrated the canopy, a rather rare scene in the Dark Forest.

Lin Xiu was able to see that all the rank 6 Odd Crystals had turned to stone.

They had undoubtedly absorbed all the energy within.

“Awake?”

Lin Xiu heard a gentle voice from behind him.

“You’re up so early?” Lin Xiu was startled and saw Luo Yue holding onto a gold fruit as she walked towards him.

“For you.” Luo Yue handed the fruit to him.

“This is a unique berry from Dark Forest, try it.” Luo Yue handed it to him and said.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded his head and took the gold berry and placed it into his mouth without hesitation.

A gentle bite caused the juice to erupt from within. A burst of sour taste came out but it was extremely appetizing.

Lin Xiu felt warmth in his body after consuming the fruit.

“Let’s go.” Luo Yue took her thin sword and picked up the Dark Edge Spear and handed it over to Lin Xiu.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded and carried his bag over.

Lin Xiu was completely healed without an ounce of pain.

This surprised him.

After unlocking the second Gene Lock, his body had evolved, and no warriors could compare to him!
