Chapter 1014: Godly Weapon?

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“Well, luckily nothing else is broken and you can still be fixed.”

As the old man spoke, his body floated into the air.

He landed on top of the angel’s shoulder.

As the old man swung his right hand, there was a hammer that appeared in his hand.

An energy source materialisation?

Lin Xiu was surprised when he saw the hammer.

With that skill, they would be able to turn into whatever shape they wanted to with merely a fixed amount of energy.

This was something incredibly difficult.

It would be difficult for Lin Xiu as well.

Most importantly, Lin Xiu wasn’t able to analyze the old man standing right in front of him even when he had already activated the Analytic Eye!

There was only one possibility. This meant that this old man was much more powerful than him.

Could he possibly be a warrior god?

Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank uncontrollably when he thought about it.

But, this felt a little impossible. The warriors from the Divine Domain were able to use the skill ‘God Descend’, some of these warriors god would be able to transfer their energy onto another warrior.

However, this planet seemed to have a special seal that made it impossible for warrior gods to enter this space.

It’s weird…

Clang clang clang – –

With the knocking happening, the old man managed to fix all of the broken parts on the angel.

“Hmmm….almost done.”

The old man stretched his back. The hammer in his hand disappeared as he turned towards Lin Xiu.

“Young man, have you been waiting for a long time?”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

For him, the time that he spent waiting was nothing.

“You are definitely the first one to be able to collect all 5 energy source stones ever since this space has been opened.”

The old man was gently stroking his beard as he spoke to Lin Xiu.

He slowly landed on the ground as well as he was previously still floating in the air.

When he got on the ground, he slowly walked towards Lin Xiu.

Just when he got close to Lin Xiu, he reached out his hand and nodded his head.

Suddenly, there was a wave of water rippling in the space.

Lin Xiu then noticed that there was a bright light coming from his watch. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

Soon, all five of the energy source stones flew out of the watch.

Boom – –

As they got into the air, there was a muffled sound that appeared in the air and all of the stones were crushed into the ashes before disappearing.

“This…”

After seeing what happened, the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed.

“These….aren’t the real energy source stones.”

The old man stroked his beard once again before informing Lin Xiu.

These aren’t the real stones?!

After hearing what the old man said, Lin Xiu was caught off guard.

“Hmm…..let me think about where it is.”

The old man scratched his head in confusion. He was cracking his head to figure out where he was until he suddenly slapped his own head.

“Found it!”

He moved his right hand and suddenly, an opening was formed in the air next to him.

He stuck his hand into the opening and started scavenging around before grabbing onto a necklace with his hand.

“Hmm….this is your reward.”

The old man moved his hand and the necklace flew towards Lin Xiu.

Slap – –

Lin Xiu caught onto the necklace subconsciously and realized that the necklace was made out of 5 invincible crystal balls.

In each crystal ball, there was something different inside it.

In one of them, there was a tiny flame in the middle of the crystal ball and it was burning continuously.

The other crystal ball had a balck mist in the middle of it while the remaining three each had a droplet of water, a piece of rock and a lightning inside them.

There was overpowering energy inside each crystal ball.

These energies were much stronger than those that came from the energy source stone.

Such powerful energy!

Plus, all of them were compressed and compacted into the crystal balls which were why they could be made into a necklace.

“Put it on then. It should be helpful for you.”

The old man said lightly to Lin Xiu.

“Thank you.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

This was definitely something considered as a godly weapon as it was too powerful.

“You would be able to control them in the future.”

The old man continued speaking to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded his head obediently and put on the necklace as he was told.

But, as soon as he put it on, there was a sharp pain that came from his neck.

It felt like the necklace suddenly had a needle that had been pierced into his skin.

“Don’t get nervous. It’s recognising its owner.”

The old man explained it to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu nodded his head, allowing the shape needle to be pierced into his skin. After taking a few droplets of blood from him, the entire necklace turned blood red in color.

Soon, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that he had a special connection with the necklace.

It felt as if this necklace was already a part of his body.

“Hmm….I wanted to give you energy as well so that you can reach another level but you are already a sage warrior.”

The old man muttered to himself as he looked at Lin Xiu.

“What’s your name?”

The old man paused for a moment before asking.

“Lin Xiu.”

“How should I address you?”

Lin Xiu asked respectfully.

The old man was different from all the other warriors that he knew.

This old man gave a peculiar feeling to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu would feel that this old man was much more powerful than he looked.

The aura coming from the old man was overpowering. If he were to fight this old man, he would have no odds in defeating him.

“Me? My name…”

The old man was shocked. He patted his head and said, “I forgot.”

After hearing what the old man said, Lin Xiu pursed his lips as he was confused as well.

This old man forgot his name?

Is this a joke?

“All of them call me the gatekeeper.”

The old man said to Lin Xiu.

“Oh! I think….My family’s name is Ye!”

The old man thought hard as if he was trying to remember something that had happened a century ago.

“You’re from the Ye family?”

After hearing what he said, Lin Xiu’s pupil shrank.

On the Namir planet, there weren’t many warriors that came from the Ye family.

Especially those who were incredibly powerful.

“The Ye family…The Ye family….”

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, he tried to think of the connections.

But, as Lin Xiu stared at him with hope, the old man shook his head.

“I have no idea.”

“What about this?”

Lin Xiu was not in a rush as well. He slowly took out the Imperial Order from his expansion space.

“Hmm?”

When Lin Xiu took out the Imperial order, the old man immediately took it away from his hand and started playing with it.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes when he saw what the old man was doing.

Looks like things were going as what he had expected. This old man was definitely related to the Ye family.

“This…”
