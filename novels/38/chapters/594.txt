Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“If one day, your strength can reach the peak, help me and destroy the Bai family.”

When the old man said this, there was still a trace of hatred in his eyes.

They traveled for so long and reached the earth. In the end, all the clansmen died.

“Of course, if your strength is not enough, then just act like you don’t know about this matter.” The old man sighed.

As soon as he finished speaking, the whole person began to slowly become blurry. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“What’s happening to you?”

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu said quickly.

“Goodbye, Earthling.”

The old man smiled at this time and his body slowly dispersed and disappeared like gravel.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu didn’t know why and immediately felt a little uncomfortable.

But at the same time, all the surrounding white light seemed to flood into Lin Xiu’s mind in an instant.

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide and felt a splitting headache. The intense pain was as if his head had been split in two.

In the next moment, Lin Xiu fell into a coma.

He didn’t know how much time has passed. When Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, he found that his hands were still on the glass ball.

But the white light inside has disappeared.

Everything just now seemed to be real yet it seemed to be an illusion too.

“Master.” At this moment, the middle-aged man just now knelt down on the ground and said excitedly.

“Get up quickly.”

Lin Xiu was startled when he saw this scene, then quickly helped him up.

“You know, just now, you have accepted the power he left behind.” The middle-aged man looked at Lin Xiu with an excited look on his face.

In addition to being excited, there was also a hint of loneliness in his eyes.

After Lin Xiu absorbed his power, now ‘he’ has completely disappeared.

“According to the agreement, whoever accepts his power, he is my new master.”

The middle-aged man said respectfully to Lin Xiu at this time.

“No, you’d better call me Lin Xiu, or Xiao Lin.” Seeing this middle-aged man calling him that, Lin Xiu felt a little weird

“Master, my name is Ye Kai and my surname was given to me by him.” The middle-aged man said this with a proud look on his face.

He should be proud, this old man was equivalent to the ancestor of the warriors on earth...

Did he really give me his power?

Lin Xiu didn’t hear the system’s upgrade prompt in his head, nor did he gain experience, but he closed his eyes and felt it carefully. At this moment, that white light appeared in his heart, as if it was protecting his heart.

This power was very strong, but Lin Xiu felt that his current strength could not be mobilized.

“Now, you can leave here.”

Lin Xiu looked around. After the light in the glass ball was transferred to his body, the lights around him seemed to be dimmed.

“Come here.”

Ye Kai shook his head at this time, then walked to the silver pillar in the middle and after moving the glass ball away, he could clearly see that there were still hints of light blooming on the pillar.

The silver beads on the surface also fell off at a speed visible to the naked eye at this time and all became bright.

“The power source of the Tower of Trials is also an odd crystal.”

“Odd crystal?”

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide and looked at this pillar with white light, his eyes were full of disbelief.

Is this really an odd crystal?!

“But as time goes by, it doesn’t have much power left.” Ye Kai sighed, then seemed to be caught in some kind of memory.

“Put your hand on it, run the ‘Cultivation Technique’ and absorb all its power.”

Ye Kai looked at Lin Xiu and said seriously.

Lin Xiu hesitated for a moment, then nodded as well, walked to the pillar that Ye Kai called ‘Odd Crystal’ and put his hands on it.

As soon as the ‘Cultivation technique’ started running, Lin Xiu felt a powerful force pouring into his body instantly!

And it was not like it was absorbed by the ‘Cultivation Technique’, but it was like the energy of this pillar, actively pouring into his body!

The cells of the whole body seemed to be filled with this energy at this time!

Lin Xiu’s body quickly became full of light.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations master on the successful upgrade...”

The upgrades continued to sound in his head. Lin Xiu didn’t have time to look at them. He could feel the power that was constantly being transmitted and it seemed like his body was about to explode!

Ye Kai said that there was very little left, but for Lin Xiu, it was still too powerful and now Lin Xiu felt as if he was going to be very full.

Fortunately, he had the ‘Engulf’ skill at this time, which helped Lin Xiu quickly consume that energy.

Minutes and seconds passed and when Lin Xiu opened his eyes again, he found that the whole world seemed to be different.

Human senses had become unusually sensitive.

Taking a closer look, it seemed that even the dust could be seen clearly.

“Phew, is it over…”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath at this time, looked at the pillar in front of him and found that it had turned into transparent glass.

Entering the system in his mind, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but be shocked.

I have... upgraded!

Moreover, he skipped levels directly and reached level 41!

“Congratulations to the master for becoming a rank 8 warrior!”

Taking a closer look at his panel attributes, Lin Xiu found that all his panel attributes were greatly enhanced:

“Young Master, let’s go.”

Ye Kai saw Lin Xiu open his eyes at this time, as if he had absorbed all the power. Although he was surprised that Lin Xiu could absorb these powers so easily, he didn’t say anything.

The stronger Lin Xiu is, the happier he is.

“Ok.”

Lin Xiu nodded and when the two walked to the library outside, the surroundings began to vibrate violently.

“What is happening!?”

The students under the Tower of Trials looked at the Tower of Trials in disbelief at this time.

The vibration this time was stronger than every previous one!
