Chapter 61: Beginning Of End-Of-Term Matches!

“Damn, the written exams are over and the end-of-term matches are about to begin. Why isn’t Lin Xiu here yet?” Inside Class 29, Luo Li frowned and wondered.

Could he truly have… sacrificed himself?

Upon thinking of this possibility, Luo Li could not help but become anxious.

“Luo Li, the end-of-term matches are about to begin, quickly bring your people to the field.” The teacher in charge of Class 2, Liu Bai, looked at Luo Li and sneered.

Tang Tian was back and his strength had improved greatly. This time, Class 2 would most probably have someone entering the top 10 rankings. Upon thinking about that, Liu bai could not help but rejoice.

Having such students under his wing brought him face.

Finally, they could finally sweep away the humiliation of being defeated by Class 29 students.

“Teacher Luo, is Lin Xiu not back yet?” Yang Tian asked anxiously.

He did not know where Lin Xiu was, while Luo Li had only given a vague answer that Lin Xiu had gone to a dangerous region to temper himself for a month or so.

“Let us wait a bit longer…” Luo Li gritted his teeth and replied.

The official battles had yet to begin and Lin Xiu’s number was at the back and not needed in the first round.

Today was the day that the federal soldiers were returning. He only hoped that he could return alive…

20 stages were set up at the large field.

Many leaders were seated at the front while 20 teachers acted as referees for each stage.

The end-of-term competition was a special segment where 1st to 3rd year students were able to battle it out.

Every student was assigned a number and the fights were decided by drawing lots. Losing meant being eliminated and the winners would advance. Every student would keep on battling until the winner was decided.

It was said that the top 10 of the end-of-term battles would obtain recommendation qualifications to the top universities.

Aside from the 5 great universities, what else could be held as the top universities?

It was extremely difficult to get into the 5 great universities and every student was excited to do their best.

Although the majority knew that their chance of getting into the top 10 was slim, it could not extinguish their excitement.

“The first match of the competition will officially begin…”

Right at this time, the principal, who was seated at the stands, shouted out loud and the entire field seemed to be able to hear his deep voice.

Students were called out according to their numbers and would head towards their designated stages where they would battle it out.

“Mr. Ye, there are many students that have raised their strength for this end-of-term match.” Principal Guo Junding whispered to Mr. Ye.

His tone towards Mr. Ye was of utmost respect.

“Indeed.” Mr. Ye nodded his head and glanced over at Class 29 with a bit of pity, “But it seems that the student with good potential isn’t here.”

‘Student with good potential?’ The Principal was startled and turned towards the direction of Mr. Ye’s gaze.

Aside from the first 10 classes of students that had strong participants, the students from other classes were lacking.

Principal Guo Junding shook his head and reckoned that the student with good potential was not from there. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

The competition started orderly.

Bang-

Not long into the competition, a warrior was flung out from one of the stages and fell to the ground with blood all over.

“Medic, medic!”

Many medics arrived promptly and carried the warrior out.

“Winner, Participant 208, Tang Tian!”

“Tang Tian? He actually beat Lightning Tiger, Lei Liang, who is ranked 98th?” Yang Tian looked over in surprise.

And he was beaten to the extent that his entire body was covered in blood and had fainted.

It seemed that Tang Tian had grown much stronger…

“I heard that Tang Tian came back from the Path of death.”

Zhang Yi spoke gravely.

Yang Tian was shocked, no wonder Tang Tian suddenly emitted a powerful aura.

If that was the case, the current Tang Tian was very much stronger than the old Tang Tian that fought against Lin Xiu.

“Next, Participant 1024, Lin Xiu!”

Not much time had passed and the referee from Stage 15 called out for Lin Xiu.

“It’s Lin Xiu’s turn already?” Yang Tian was shocked and cried out in alarm.

The end-of-term match weighed as heavily as the written examination, and if a student did not score in any of the two.

He would be expelled!

Lin Xiu already missed the written examination, and if he failed to participate in the actual combat, it would be the worst outcome.

“Hmph, I want to see how strong the black horse that defeated Tang Tian is, who would have thought that he would not dare to turn up!” Chen Xiao laughed out loud on the stage.

Chen Xiao, ranked 150th, was well known for his saber techniques.

“Haha, he is really trash.” Seeing that Lin Xiu had yet to appear, he started to mock him.

The referee turned and looked around before shouting, “Participant 1024, Lin Xiu, are you here!”

“If you are not here by the count of 10, I will deem it as a forfeit!”

“10…9…8…”

“Damn it, it’s over.” Yang Tian could not help but become anxious.

As for Luo Li, his complexion was extremely bad.?No way, did Lin Xiu really sacrifice himself there?

“2…!”

“I’m here!” As he was about to shout out the last second, a loud voice came out from the other side.

Luo Li was shocked and turned to look as his eyes were immediately filled with joy.

“Lin Xiu!!!” Yang Tian shouted out in joy.

Bang bang bang-

Everyone’s eyes turned towards the heavy footsteps.

Their eyes were filled with surprise.

It was a handsome youth that rode on an android wolf that ran extremely quickly.

Tang Tian’s eyes became extremely cold.

He didn’t die, he actually didn’t die. Very well, this time, I will definitely… kill him!

Only by doing so can I clear away the humiliation!

Right as he was about to reach the stage, Lin Xiu exerted a force and flew up!

Lin Xiu was dressed in camouflage battle robes and carried a large black box on his back. Matched with his determined face and pitch-black eyes, he was brimming with mystery.

If anyone said that Lin Xiu was trash a month ago, no one would ever believe that!
