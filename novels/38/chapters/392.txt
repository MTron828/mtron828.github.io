Chapter 393: Special Skill Card! (Part 1)

It seemed that it didn’t change much…

And the reward looked a bit ordinary, there weren’t those ‘?’ rewards anymore.

Lin Xiu curled his lips and clicked on the draw.

The moment Lin Xiu clicked, the lottery wheel spun frantically.

“Stop!”

As Lin Xiu yelled, the pointer of the dial slowly stopped.

“Congratulations Master for obtaining an Odd crystal!”

“Damn it!” Lin Xiu couldn’t help cursing inwardly when he heard the system prompt.

Although the rewards on the lottery wheel this time were a bit rubbish, getting a skill card was also not too bad, there may be something suitable for him or a diamond skill card. Lin Xiu did not expect that he actually got an Odd crystal – something that he really didn’t need at all right now.

Crash——

After Lin Xiu cursed, a bright light flashed in the air and numerous odd crystals fell.

“So many?” Lin Xiu was stunned when he saw this scene because the number of these Odd crystals obviously exceeded Lin Xiu’s imagination.

It was like coins falling and soon there was a small pile of Odd crystals on the ground.

“All of them are rank 3 ah…” Although there were many of these Odd crystals, they were just rank 3 and weren’t very valuable

“Squeak!”

Just when Lin Xiu wanted to absorb all the energy in these Odd crystals with ‘Cultivation Technique’, then throw them away, the little Ice crystal white bird in the refrigeration box squeaked like it saw something.

The refrigeration box was transparent and relatively high. Also, the small ice crystal white bird couldn’t fly so it shook its small wings at this time, but could not fly out.

“Huh?” Lin Xiu saw that the little ice crystal white bird in the refrigeration box seemed anxious to get out. Lin Xiu couldn’t help but freeze for a moment, then looked at the pile of Odd crystals in the palm of his hand. Then, he asked, “Do you want this?”

“Squeak!”

Lin Xiu got curious when he saw that the little ice crystal white bird seemed to be responding to him.

He carefully took a piece of light blue Odd crystal and threw it into the refrigeration box.

The little ice crystal white bird saw the Odd crystal that was thrown in and grabbed it with its small paws, then opened its mouth and bit it.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu was surprised.

Because this ice crystal white bird just broke its shell that day, he didn’t expect that its mouth was so sharp that it could even bite Odd crystals into pieces.

“I’ll give them all to you, eat slowly.” Lin Xiu smiled, then put the small pile of Odd crystals into the refrigerator.

The little ice crystal white bird ignored the Odd crystals that Lin Xiu continued to throw in and continued gnawing happily on the first piece.

Lin Xiu entered the system interface again.

There were two more draws and he decided to use them up.

As Lin Xiu clicked ‘start’, the lottery wheel spun again.

This time it was almost at the ‘Grand Prize’, but in the end, it passed it and Lin Xiu was extremely upset.

For the last chance to draw a lottery, Lin Xiu didn’t have any expectations, but this time, the items on the lottery wheel have changed!

And Lin Xiu saw that there were three grids that were ‘? ‘.

After going through the previous lottery draws, Lin Xiu knew that those with ‘?’ had awesome items inside!

“Give it to me!”

He wasn’t sure if it was due to the bad luck from the previous two draws, but this time, Lin Xiu actually got the ‘?’ grid!

What is it!?

Lin Xiu saw the pointer stopping on one of the ‘?’ grids and he held his breath as he waited for the system prompt.

“Congratulations Master for obtaining the special skill card!”

Special skill card!?

What’s that?

Lin Xiu was taken aback. He had heard of skills cards from bronze to diamond, as well as a rare skill card, but he had never heard of this so-called special skill card!

What the hell is this?

Before Lin Xiu had time to think about it, a bright light flashed and a skill card flew towards Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu caught the skill card instinctively only to see ‘Up’ written in the middle of the card.

“What the hell is this!?” Lin Xiu’s eyes widened in disbelief.

And at this time, Lin Xiu also saw that on the skill card, there was ‘Clean Sweep’ written on it!

Moreover, the martial arts card hasn’t stated exactly what weapon it was used for, which made Lin Xiu a little depressed.

“Why don’t he… give it a try?”

With this thought, Lin Xiu put the skill card on his forehead.

But unlike ordinary skill cards, Lin Xiu didn’t notice any information in the skill card entering his mind.

It was like… this was not a real skill card.

“Wait, there is an ‘Up’ logo on this, could it be that this kind of skill card could only be used after he collects a set!?

The more Lin Xiu thought about it, the more he felt that this was the case. If that was true, this skill card was pretty useless. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

And he still had a diamond body skill card that he got after winning Yu Yi in the arena, but he couldn’t use it. So in total, he had two skill cards that he couldn’t use.

No, it should be four. At the time in the tavern, he also obtained two more!

Especially this ‘Clean Sweep’, he didn’t know what skill card it was.

Forget it, he didn’t want to think so much.

Lin Xiu thought about it at this time, then took out the things that he had exchanged using the Unicorn terror beast’s ** at the tavern in the small town near the dark forest.

Looking at this quaint-looking box, the corners of Lin Xiu’s mouth rose up.

They treated this as rubbish, but only Lin Xiu knew that there was something in it.

In the last century, skill cards that enable people to easily master various information about the skill and greatly increase the speed of learning the skill had appeared.

But the more advanced the card, the more difficult it was to make and some people were unwilling to impart the skill.

Just like in ancient China; many skills were lost because they were only passed on to men and not women or only to family members or apprentices.

Some warriors who were unwilling to simply hand over their skill cards were left without a choice before they died and had to hide them somewhere.

Looking at the pattern of this kind of simple box, it was clear that it was made of a special kind of wood and there were usually things hidden in it.

But as Lin Xiu opened the wooden box, the inside was empty.
