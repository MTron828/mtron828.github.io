1192 Fu Tianyuan

Soon, it was already the next day.

Manhuang City was busier than ever.

This was because the city lord has invited all the city lords in the warrior god realm in order to watch the sealing of the divine mark.

“Stop there!”

Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling were walking through the tall and wide entrance.

Just as they were about to step inside, the warriors who were guarding the gates stopped the both of them.

“Only city lords who were being invited would be allowed inside.”

One of the warriors glared at Lin Xiu coldly.

“I am.”

Lin Xiunodded his head. He stretched out his hand and the invitation appeared in his palm.

Then, he passed it to the guards.

The guards took a look at it and said, “You…are allowed inside.”

“But not her!”

“Why can’t I go inside?!”

Baili Haoling’s eyes were stretched wide open.

She finally got the chance to witness something fun but she was getting stopped here. It was depressing!

“We…are both the city lords of Lingxian City.”

Lin Xiu answered calmly.

There were no names written on the invitation and it only says that the city lord of Lingxian City.

But, who was it that states that there can’t be two city lords?

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, he was stunned.

It was obvious that he didn’t know what to do now.

“It’s fine. Just head inside.”

Another warrior stepped out and allowed them inside.

“Let’s go.”

Lin Xiu walked in without looking at the guards.

Little Bai and Rollie were sitting on Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

Due to how they could control the size of their bodies, they were now in a fairly tiny size while sitting on Lin Xiu’s shoulder. They looked quite cute. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling walked into the place and noticed that there were already a large number of warriors who were inside.

“Are all of these city lords of the other cities?”

Baili Haoling looked around with curiosity.

It hasn’t been that long since she arrived at the warrior god realm and she didn’t know much about this place.

“The city lord of Lingxian City? This way please.”

As the both of them were lost and were wandering around, one of the staff stepped forward and respectfully greeted the both of them.

“En.”

Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling looked at each other before nodding their heads.

There were other tables that were in the same hall and most of them were already seated.

Lin Xiu’s seat was at the corner.

As he looked to the centre of the hall, there was a huge battlestage.

“Will there be a tournament happening here?”

Baili Haoling muttered to herself out of curiosity.

It was a square table and there were four of them who were seated together.

“Don’t you know that after the banquet, the young men from all cities would be participating in tournaments?”

The middle-aged man seated opposite Lin Xiu smiled as he introduced himself.

“Let me introduce myself. Sun Ruo, the city lord of Qingkong City.”

The man seated next to him smiled as well. “I am Ling Yu from Lingtian City.”

The second man who spoke was much younger than the first one.

“Lingxian City, Lin Xiu.”

“Baili Haoling.”

They introduced themselves as well.

“Both of you are from Lingxian City?”

Ling Yu and Sun Ruo were getting curious.

Usually, there would only be one city lord in every city.

How was it that Lingxian City had two?

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

When they saw how Lin Xiu did not explain himself, they didn’t continue asking as well.

Soon, most of the seats were getting occupied and there was a middle-aged man dressed in a combat suit with a unique mark on it that led a group of men that walked into the room.

The man looked tall and muscular. With every step he took, Lin Xiu could feel the energy that was coming from his body.

He was strong.

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and subconsciously activated his analytical eye.

However, even with that activated, Lin Xiu didn’t get any information from it.

Suddenly, the middle-aged man frowned. He turned and looked at Lin Xiu.

The look on Lin Xiu’s face changed drastically as well.

Such a strong sense of perception!

Lin Xiu quickly recovered from the shock. As he drank his tea, he continued looking at the centre of the stage as if nothing had happened.

The man had a confused look on his face.

This was because he could clearly feel that someone was staring at him.

But, it disappeared very quickly.

Perhaps he was being too sensitive?

When he stepped onto the stage, the warriors who followed him into the room, stood obediently behind him.

“Welcome everyone to Manhuang City.”

“I am the city lord, Fu Tianyuan.”

The middle-aged name glanced at the other warriors who were in the room and introduced himself.

“Fu Tianyuan? What a weird name?”

Baili Haoling mumbled under her breath.

Lin Xiu was still shocked.

This man was one of the strongest warriors that he has ever met since he got to warrior god realm.

He was indeed someone powerful.

Clap clap clap —-

The rest of the warriors applauded after hearing what Fu Tianyuan said.

He waved his hands and continued, “I will not be wasting anymore time. I hope that everyone would enjoy the delicacy of Manhuang City.”

Then, he clapped his hands.

With that, the rest of the waiters started serving them.

“It smells good.”

When Baili Haoling saw the dishes on the table, she took a huge sniff before commenting about the food.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

It was undeniable that the food being served was high quality food.

The ingredients used seemed to be of very good quality.

“These are yours.”

Lin Xiu took two new bowls and placed some food on it for Little Bai and Rollie.

Seeing how close these two were with Lin Xiu, Baili Haoling pursed her lips, “I have been taking care of both of you for so long but you have never been so close with me.”

“These are my pets.”

Lin Xiu answered with pride.

“This is an ice crystal white bird? It is so rare to see one growing to such size.”

Ling Yu smiled as he commented on Little Bai.

Sun Ruo was staring at Rollie instead.

He felt that this evolved beast was a little different.

“Brother Lin, what evolved beast is this?”

He could clearly sense that there was a peculiar energy that was coming from Rollie.

It was different from the other evolved beasts.

“I’m not sure as well.”

Lin Xiu was a little stunned but he shook his head.

He was telling the truth. This was because he found Rollie in the body of another beast.

He had no idea what Rollie was.

“I can feel that this pet of yours is different.”
