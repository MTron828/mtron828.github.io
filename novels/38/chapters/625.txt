Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Huang Zhen frowned when he saw the list of the top sixteen.

“Sky Academy and Star Academy have respectively won the championships of the two competitions held by the Warrior Alliance, so they are qualified to send two sub-teams for this Warrior Competition.”

Baili Haoling said lightly.

“And they are seeded teams and directly advance to the top sixteen.”

“It doesn’t matter, the champion, we’ve got it.”

Lin Xiu spread out his hands, and then said lightly, with a confident look in his words.

“The home teams of Sky Academy and Interstellar Academy are not so easy to deal with.”

Ouyang Hang shook his head at this time. He, who was full of self-confidence, seemed to be a little discouraged at this time.

“With me here, the champion can’t go away.” Baili Haoling said confidently.

And at this time, the top of the screen has already displayed the top management of the Warrior Alliance, who are broadcasting the random selection of tomorrow’s competition teams.

“Sky Academy vs Smack Academy...”

“Star Academy vs. Moon Picking Academy...”

“Huh, thankfully it wasn’t us.”

Seeing this scene, Ouyang Hang finally breathed a sigh of relief.

Because after the round of sixteen, it will be a knockout round, and if you lose, you will be eliminated directly.

At the beginning, if you face these strong teams, of course, it will be very stressful.

“Huh? We’re dealing with the Sky Academy team?”

Lin Xiu also looked at the screen at this time. When he saw the result of the battle on the screen, Lin Xiu’s brows suddenly raised.

“It seems that your enemy is going to seek revenge on you.” Baili Haoling also said meaningfully at this time.

“Casual.”

Lin Xiu spread his hands helplessly and said.

“Who are you talking about?”

Ouyang Hang and others didn’t see Zhuo Qixing’s match because they went out to buy weapons, so they said out of curiosity.

“You’ll know tomorrow.”

“Che, it’s mysterious.” Ouyang Hang said with a cold snort.

“By the way, I heard that a team was killed by everyone. Which team did it? It’s too terrifying.” Huang Zhen seemed to have thought of something, and said aloud at this time.

“It’s them.”

Lin Xiu pointed to the team introduction displayed on the screen, which happened to be introduced to the Sky City team.

“Zhuo Qixing?”

At this time, Ouyang Hang saw Zhuo Qixing’s figure displayed at the top of the screen, and the expression in his eyes changed greatly.

“Is this guy all right now?”

Ouyang Hang clearly remembered that when Zhuo Qixing was in Sanctuary Academy, he was beaten by Lin Xiu and was seriously injured and almost died.

“Well, now his strength should be at the eighth rank.”

Lin Xiu nodded, then said meaningfully.

“Transformed into a cyborg!?”

Ouyang Hang responded quickly and said aloud.

Otherwise, it is impossible for a person’s strength to improve so quickly.

“The Zhuo family does have this kind of strength. The materials he uses should be the best in the world.”

“It’s a bit difficult to do now...”

Ouyang Hang wrinkled every day at this time, and then started talking to himself.

“there is always a solution to a problem.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

At this time, looking at the team of Sky City, Lin Xiu vaguely felt whether Luo Yue would appear on the team of Sky City.

Because before, Luo Yue went to Sky City High School.

The time soon arrived on the second day.

On this day, the game site was still empty, and tens of thousands of temporary seats were added, and more people were watching.

After all, compared to the previous rematch, this is the beginning of the real final!

And it’s still a direct elimination system!

The first game was Sky Academy against Smack Academy.

When Lin Xiu was sitting on the special seat of the competition members, he saw a familiar figure standing on the rooftop!

The white figure was still the same as before.

Luo Yue!

At this time, Luo Yue was holding a long sword and stood on the sky platform, her eyes did not change, her expression was still cold, and she could not see any fluctuations in her expression.

The rest of the team members, Lin Xiu, also know each other. One of them is Yu Muchen, and the other is Nanhuang who wants to kill Lin Xiu in the Valley of Thunder!

Seeing this person, Lin Xiu’s eyes burst into a killing intent.

“Yu Muchen, I heard that your engagement with Luo Yue was cancelled?”

Standing in front of the audience of more than 200,000 people, Nan Huang did not show any nervousness at all, as if he was used to it, he said to Yu Muchen.

“I take Luo Yue as my sister.” Yu Muchen said with a smile, but there seemed to be a bit of bitterness hidden in this smile.

After all, Luo Yue didn’t like him at all.

“Hahaha, it seems that I can be your brother-in-law.” Nan Huang said with a smile at this time.

“What do you mean?”

Yu Muchen frowned, then looked at him and said aloud.

“Nothing, our Nan family is going to propose marriage to their Luo family.”

Nan Huang stared at Yu Muchen and said.

“Hmph, do you think Luo Yue will fall in love with you?”

Yu Muchen said coldly.

“It’s up to him, otherwise, can their Luo family continue to exist in Sky City?”

Nan Huang looked at Yu Muchen, as if he meant something.

swoosh—

But at this moment, Luo Yue’s long sword stabbed towards Nan Huang, but was easily blocked by Nan Huang’s long sword.

When the two long swords collided, sparks suddenly burst out.

“Why, are you still thinking about your little lover? Let me tell you, your Luo family, this time, it was not so easy to escape this disaster.”

Nan Huang stared at Luo Yue and said coldly.

Luo Yue seemed to have thought of something, and the look in her eyes changed slightly.

boom–

At this time, Nan Huang used his right hand to push Luo Yue’s long sword aside, and said in a faint voice, “The game has begun.”

“The much-anticipated top sixteen competition has begun!”

“The first match is our Sky Academy against Smack Academy!”

“Sky Academy!”

“Sky Academy!” Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

As soon as the host’s voice fell, the voice of the Sky Academy instantly reached its highest point.

That aura was so powerful that the faces of the people at Smack Academy were a little ugly.

This time, they were suppressed by this powerful momentum, which was a huge blow to their morale.

“Go down by yourself, or let us kill.”

After watching the people from Smack Academy stand up, Nan Huang looked at these people, and then said lightly.

“Sky Academy, don’t be too arrogant!”

Hearing Nan Huang’s words, the expressions of these people suddenly changed.

They held the weapons in their hands tightly, as if forcibly suppressing the anger in their hearts.

“Why are you so angry?”

“To deal with opponents like you, I alone is enough.”

Nan Huang had a cruel look in his eyes, and then said with a smile.

“Game start!”

As soon as the host’s voice fell, the people from Smack Academy couldn’t hold back the anger in their bodies, so they rushed towards Nanhuang, and they were about to kill him!

Whoosh whoosh—

There was a sound of breaking through the air, and before many of the surrounding audience could understand it, they found that blood spattered all over the ground!
