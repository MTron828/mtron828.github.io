Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“I always thought that there weren’t many people who would choose the spear but I guess yours is much rarer than mine. You’re the only person that I’ve met using a double broadsword.” Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“I’m sure that Baili used a sword...”

Lin Xiu mumbled to himself as he was deep in thoughts.

“That’s because my ancestors used these double broadswords.”

Baili Haoling said it with pride.

“When the virus hit the world, she killed thousands of zombies with her double broadsword. Back at those times, there were no warriors around yet.”

“I’m curious who your ancestors were.” Lin Xiu said subconsciously.

“Hehe....I have a picture of her. I’ll show it to you next time.”

Baili Haoling said to him.

The both of them continued walking around the room and soon found the collection for the spears.

All of them were of diamond skills level. Although there weren’t many skills for the spears, the warrior skills card still filled up the entire wall.

“There are quite a large number of varieties...”

Lin Xiu took a good look at the wall and he was surprised.

There were a lot of these warrior skill cards that he has never seen before in the other stores.

“Stay here. I’ll take a look over there.”

Baoli Haoli informed Lin Xiu before walking away.

“Alright.”

Lin Xiu took a closer look at those warrior skills cards. The spear might not be as popular as the other weapons but there were still a lot of skill cards here that were available.

However, he hasn’t found one that was suitable for him.

“Eh?”

At the corner of the wall, Lin Xiu suddenly noticed that there was a warrior skills card that looked unique.

” ‘Tiger on the Ground’.”

According to its description, ‘Tiger on the Ground’ was a very demanding skill of the spear. The strength of the person using it would have to be very strong. Otherwise, the energy released from the skill would not be contained in the human body and not only would it affect the others, it would cause the owner’s body to explode as well.

The warrior skill cards were graded for the strength of the skills and the danger from it. This particular hard had 5 stars on both factors.

“Bro, are you thinking about getting this one?”

When Lin Xiu was still checking out the card, there was a voice that appeared next to him.

Lin Xiu turned around and noticed that there was a muscular man in his thirties who was standing next to him, smiling at Lin Xiu.

“En. I was thinking about it.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“I’ve heard that there were a large number of people who tried and most of them were warriors as well. They ended up dead.”

The man warned Lin Xiu with a stern face.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head while taking up his phone and swiped it across the card.

Beep beep beep – –

Then, there was a notification on the phone that showed that there had been a transaction.

It seems as if no one else was interested in this card which was why the price had been kept extremely low. Lin Xiu’s account that had been linked to his phone had just the right amount for him to purchase the card.

Then, the small glass cupboard popped up as well.

Lin Xiu gently picked up the diamond warrior skill card from the glass cupboard.

Diamond Warrior Skills Card – ‘Tiger on the Ground’.

“You really bought the card...”

When the man saw Lin Xiu picking up the card, he was shocked.

“It’s no big deal. I just wanted to try it for fun.”

Lin Xiu chuckled before heading towards Ouyang Hang.

The man shook his head. He was trying to be nice and reminded the young boy but it seemed like his kind motion wasn’t appreciated.

What he didn’t know was, these cultivations may be hard for the other but for someone like Lin Xiu, it was exactly what he wanted.

“I WANT THIS ONE!”

As Lin Xiu was walking towards Ouyang Hang, Lin Xiu heard their voices.

Huang Zhen had his eyes on one of the diamond warrior skills cards and he was about to take out his phone to purchase the card.

“Move aside. I want this one.”

Right at that moment, a man walked towards them and immediately pushed Huang Zhen out of the way. Then, he took out his phone and was about to scan on the warriors skills card.

“What do you think you’re doing?”

Huang Zhen wasn’t someone who was easily bullied. When he was pushed, he immediately frowned and glared at the man who pushed him.

The man looked like he was in their twenties, dressed in a luxurious combat suit.

“I said...I want this one. Don’t you understand?”

The man sneered and replied arrogantly towards Huang Zhen.

“You son of a ...” Huang Zhen was triggered as well as he held a held and was aiming towards the other person’s head.

“This is Sky City!”

When the man saw what was happening, he did not panic and screamed out loud instead.

After being screamed at, Huang Zhen was stunned.

“I am an aborigin of Sky City. If you dare to touch me, the federation police will arrest you.”

The man said with pride.

“So what?”

Then, a voice came from behind the arrogant man.

Lin Xiu was walking towards them when he found this man arguing with Huang Zhen.

When he heard what the man said, Lin Xiu frowned.

“So what? All of you are outsiders here in Sky City so sit your ass down! This belongs to me!”

The man roared at Lin Xiu.

“That’s load of rubbish coming out of your mouth.”

“You brat!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was acting more conceited than he was, he was about to punch Lin Xiu in the stomach!

Just as his fist was about to reach Lin Xiu, Lin Xiu reached out his left hand and caught the other person’s fist.

Then, with a small pressure.

Crack crack – –

A small crack came from the other person’s fist.

“AHHHHHH!!!”

The man felt as if his fist was being caught in a trap. The strong grip that Lin Xiu had on his fist caused him to feel as if his bones were about to be crushed into pieces. The stinging pain that he felt in his hand caused him to scream out loud.

“Let go of me! You’re a dead piece of meat...!”

The man who was feeling the severe pain on his hand had a twisted look on his face. He gritted his teeth as he screamed out loud.

“Hmmmm?”

After hearing what he said, Lin Xiu raised his eyebrows and increased the strength in his hands that was grabbing the other person’s fist.

“Ahhhhh! Let go of me! Let go!”

When the person felt the grip around his fist that was getting tighter, he could feel the stinging pain all over his body. He was in so much pain that he immediately fell onto the ground!”

“Leave.”

As Lin Xiu ordered him to leave, the man was thrown aside and landed on the walls behind them.

Due to the collision with the wall, there was blood coming out of the corners of the man’s lips.

“Damn it...”

He glared at Lin Xiu with an evil look in his eyes.

“What’s the matter?”

Then, Ouyang Hang and Qian Yao, who noticed that something had happened, quickly rushed towards them.
