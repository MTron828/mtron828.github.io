Chapter 1013: The Ultimate Reward

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Lin Xiu slowly got back onto the ground.

He looked at the two energy source stones that were still in the air and then logged onto his watch.

As the projection appeared, Lin Xiu clicked onto the ‘collect’ button.

Then, the Source Stone of Darkness, Electricity and Fire shone brightly before disappearing into the watch.

Lin Xiu reached out to the Source Stone of Earth and he could feel a strong energy coming from it.

One of his arms suddenly turned into rocks.

These rocks were slowly growing upwards on his arm!

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered and with a small shake, all of the rocks that were formed on his hands turned into ash as they fell onto the ground.

The Source Stone of Earth glowed brightly and it immediately entered into the watch.

Lin Xiu had four energy source stones now.

“Now for the last one.”

He looked at the energy source stone that was bright blue in colour. He reached out for it and the Source Stone of Water immediately glowed brightly in blue colour.

Water droplets started appearing on Lin Xiu’s arm!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

These tiny droplets immediately penetrated through Lin Xiu’s arms and there were holes formed in his arm.

Just when blood was about to come out of the holes, the wounds had already healed on their own.

“It does hurt a little…”

Lin Xiu gasped a little.

But, Lin Xiu’s body now was much stronger than before and his wounds were able to recover within seconds.

When he touched the Source Stone of Water with his fingers once again, the stone shone brightly and it disappeared as it entered into the watch.

The watch was still projecting the collection and there were 5 windows in it.

There were also 5 stones in each window.

“Master!!”

At the same time, Wang Qiang came running towards Lin Xiu.

“Master, are you alright?”

Wang Qiang was panting as he spoke to Lin Xiu.

When Lin Xiu looked at him, there were wounds all over Wang Qiang’s body.

“I should be the one asking you that.”

Lin Xiu smiled as he looked at Wang Qiang.

After hearing what Lin Xiu said, Wang Qiang felt a little awkward as he answered…

“It’s minor…”

“Thank you.”

Duan Zheyan walked towards them as well as he thanked Lin Xiu gratefully.

He looked at Lin Xiu and noticed that there were numerous rings on it.

They were all shining with an eye-piercing glow.

82 rings in total.

Lin Xiu looked at his arm and thought of something. Suddenly, Wang Qiang had 30 rings on his arm and Duan Zheyan had an additional 10 rings.

“This…”

Wang Qiang and Duan Zheyan were both shocked.

They didn’t think that Lin Xiu would give them so many rings.

“This…..it’s useless even if I have lots of it.”

Lin Xiu said calmly.

It was unquestionable that he was one the first.

Boom – –

Suddenly, the entire ground started shaking.

There’s someone coming?!

When they felt the shake, Wang Qiang and Duan Zheyan started getting cautious.

“Looks like it’s coming.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes.

Then, he noticed that there was a bright light coming from his watch.

All the energy source stones that he had collected started coming together.

Soon, all five of them were combined together into the shape of a handprint.

Should he be pressing it?

Lin Xiu was stunned when he saw what happened.

He hesitated a little before pressing on it.

Boom – –

As Lin Xiu placed his hands on it, there was a bright sound that came from the ground causing the ground to shake even more vigorously!

“Look!”

Wang Qiang seemed to have realised something as he pointed to the sky.

Lin Xiu looked up as well and there was a huge city that appeared in the air and was slowly headed towards the ground.

What on earth is happening?

Lin Xiu was shocked as well when he saw what was happening in front of him.

“What…..what is this?”

Wu Mei as well as the remaining warriors were surprised as well as they looked at the mechanical city that appeared in the sky.

The city that was floating in the air started glowing brightly.

The glow was directly pointed towards Lin Xiu.

Hmm?

Lin Xiu subconsciously wanted to release his ‘sphere’.

But then, he realised that this bright light was warm and gentle when it touched his body.

Soon, his figure disappeared into thin air.

“Master…”

When he saw what happened, Wang Qiang couldn’t help but call for Lin Xiu.

“He should be up there now.”

Duan Zheyan looked at Lin Xiu, who had just disappeared and the mechanical city above them disappeared as well.

“Would he be in danger?”

Wang Qiang got a little worried.

“No.”

Duan Zheyan shook his head.

“He should be receiving the ultimate reward.”

Duan Zheyan told Wang Qiang with an envious look in his eyes.

Crackling – –

At the same time, the Angel that was on the ground previously seemed to have been summoned as it started moving as well.

Her eyes suddenly lit up brightly and the wings behind her back gave a white glow.

Soon, she flapped her wings and headed into the sky!

This…

Lin Xiu felt a blinding light coming from in front of him and he soon realised that he was in an open space.

There were lots of weird machinery travelling around him. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

They did not have any armour on and he could see the gear wheels that were spinning inside them.

It had a very antique vibe.

Then, there was a huge piece of machinery that suddenly appeared in the air above him.

Boom – –

The entire ceiling that was above him was torn into two pieces.

The Angel then came down from the sky.

It landed on the ground and got on one knee.

Lin Xiu frowned when he saw the angel. He doesn’t recall summoning this angel.

How did she suddenly come up here?

Just when Lin Xiu was still confused with what was happening, another man appeared from the other side.

“Hmm? Your armour is dented so badly. These people really…”

Lin Xiu took a good look at the man who came out of nowhere. It was an old man dressed in a long robe. As he appeared, he walked next to the angel, shook his head as he muttered to himself.
