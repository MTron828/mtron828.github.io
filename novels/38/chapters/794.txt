Chapter 795: Master Warrior Is Worse Than A Dog

These warriors looked at Lin Xiu at this time, they didn’t waste any time and they rushed to Lin Xiu!

The man who leaped over first, the long sword in his hand, swung directly into the air!

swoosh—

A gigantic crescent-shaped sword aura charged over in an instant!

Lin Xiu snorted coldly when he saw this scene.

The spear in his hand slashed horizontally and the terrifying sword aura was directly dissipated.

boom boom boom —

And at this time, Lin Xiu frantically waved his Dark Edge spear.

One after another, terrifying flaming birds burst out directly, then flew towards those warriors who were coming!

Those warriors who leaped up and wanted to kill Lin Xiu had a change of expression, then quickly unfolded the ‘Sphere’ to protect from the flaming birds released by Lin Xiu.

All of them were at the master warrior level.

But it was not a top-level existence in the warrior world. For the current Lin Xiu, there is no pressure.

Before they could attack, Lin Xiu charged directly below.

As the source strength was transmitted under the Dark Edge spear, in the next moment, the Dark Edge spear instantly turned into amethyst glass.

“Go to hell!”

When a man saw that Lin Xiu dared to rush over, he immediately roared, holding the weapon in his hand and attacked Lin Xiu’s body!

Dang–

Lin Xiu did not resist in the slightest and directly attacked him head-on.

And at this moment, the man felt an extremely strong force coming and the weapon in his hand suddenly came out of his hand!

Lin Xiu snorted coldly and the spear continued to stab like a dragon.

bang bang bang-

A dull sound came out continuously and the man kept retreating.

And the rest of the warriors were now surrounding him.

“Get lost!”

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes shrank and with a roar, the spear drew a huge arc.

‘Clean sweep’!!!

boom boom boom —

At the next moment, all the warriors who came from the surrounding area were swept away by this attack!

Especially the warrior who was just hit by Lin Xiu. At this time, the ‘Sphere’ on his body was broken and his whole body flew out instantly.

It hit the dark blue flames heavily.

“Ah!!!”

A wailing scream came out instantly.

The man didn’t seem to be protected by ‘Sphere’. After his body directly hit the flames, the cooling suit on his entire body was instantly burnt away.

Soon, his whole body was filled with flames.

At this moment, he frantically wanted to put out the flames on his body, but to no avail.

At this time, as he fell and rolled on the ground, a more painful wail came out.

The temperature of the rocks on the ground was also very high!

Soon, all the flesh and blood of this person has burned away and there was only a skeleton left.

“What!!!”

And at the same time, some people who were hit by Lin Xiu’s ‘Clean sweep’ flew out because their bodies hit the surrounding rocks and the terrifying temperature burnt their hands.

The rest of the warriors couldn’t help trembling when they saw this scene.

In a short period of time, not only did they not manage to kill Lin Xiu, but they lost so many people!

They now didn’t have the murderous intent they had just now in their eyes, but instead they were filled with fear.

Lin Xiu ignored the thoughts of these people. Now, in his eyes, he saw that these people came to give him experience!

boom boom boom —

The spear was swung and at this moment, a large number of flaming birds rushed towards the warriors.

Those warriors had no choice but to continue to unfold their ‘Sphere’ for protection.

With the flames of these flaming birds covering their ‘Sphere’, all they can see in their field of vision are flames all over their bodies.

bang bang bang-

And Lin Xiu had already attacked with a Dark Edge spear.

Every shot was full of domineering power.

These seemingly powerful master warrior-level warriors did not even have time to use the source mark power and their bodies were directly hit by the powerful force and flew out.

They hit some dark blue flames heavily.

These so-called ‘hellfires’ were indeed too terrifying. Even if these people unfolded the ‘Sphere’, it seemed to be distorted under the touch of those flames and a hole was directly burned by the flames! Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“What!!!”

Wailings and screamings kept coming.

“Ding!”

“Congratulations to the master for killing a master warrior-level warrior, you will gain experience...”

And at this time, there was a constant ringing of system prompts in his mind.

But after looking at the experience progress bar, it only increased by less than 1%...

This made Lin Xiu speechless.

This was a master warrior-level warrior and he has killed so many in a row but he had gained so little experience.

Sure enough, with the increase of the level, the speed of the upgrade is getting slower and slower.

Unless you can kill a warrior of a level way higher than yourself, for example, a king warrior level...

With this thought, Yan Yongxin’s figure appeared in Lin Xiu’s mind.

Although he is a King warrior, he is not the kind of very powerful King warrior.

With his strength and the use of ‘Fury’ and ‘Power of the Stars’, it is not impossible to fight.

“What...”

He glanced to the front and saw that there was another warrior. At this time, he struggled to stand up and looked like he wanted to escape.

“Where are you going?”

But at this moment, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared in front of him.

When the man saw Lin Xiu’s figure, his eyes were full of fear.

“Who sent you guys here.”

Lin Xiu held the long spear in his hand, pointed at his forehead and said indifferently.

“Hehehe...”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, he showed a hideous smile.

“The King will come after a while and you will surely die miserably!”

“One last time, who sent you here.”

Lin Xiu said lightly.

“You will surely die...”

boom–

Just before he finished speaking, the spearhead had already penetrated his head.

There was also a clear sound in his mind.

It was the sound of the system prompts that he gained experience.

King?

Lin Xiu frowned slightly when he thought of the man’s words just now and quickly reacted.

Isn’t Yan Yongxin’s nickname the Lightning King?

Seems like it is very likely that it is someone sent by Sun Zi.

Moreover, to be able to dispatch so many master warrior-level warriors, apart from the forces of the Sun Family in Cangqiong City, there is no other possibility.

And just before the battle, Lin Xiu also noticed that someone had sent a flare.

Don’t think they would come so soon right?

The bodies of the warriors on the ground fell to the ground and soon the hot rocks made a ‘Zizzi’ sound.

It was like teppanyaki and it made one’s hair stand on its ends.

Lin Xiu thought for a while, then continued to walk up the mountain.
