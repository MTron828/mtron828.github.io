Chapter 1131: The Ruins Appear

“There are quite a lot of people…”

Lin Xiu saw this scene and said to himself.

The ruins seem to be in the middle of a giant mountain below.

So at this time, Lin Xiu flew down from the sky.

!!

He looked ahead and saw that there were a large number of warriors standing there.

They seem to be watching something.

“These ruins only appear around six o’clock every evening, so please wait.”

At this time, Lin Xiu, who had a good ear, could clearly hear the voices of the warriors in front of him.

“It is said that this ruin is related to the Ye family and I don’t know if there will be anything left behind by the Ye family in it.”

“Isn’t the Ye family’s most powerful skill those three holy-level skills? I have a hunch that they will appear inside.”

“Hehe, that rubbish Ye family was invincible back then yet it was still destroyed by the Bai family. Now the Bai family is the most powerful family.”

The warriors’ discussion made Lin Xiu frown slightly.

Looking at the front side, a warrior in a white battle uniform said arrogantly there.

Lin Xiu just glanced over there, then found a place to sit cross-legged.

Then started to cultivate.

If those warriors were right just now, it should be open only around six o’clock in the evening. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

It’s still early.

In Lin Xiu’s current state, his grasp of power became stronger and stronger.

At this time, Lin Xiu seemed to be one with the surrounding environment.

This strange feeling is very comfortable.

At this time, the surrounding energy was constantly pouring towards Lin Xiu’s body.

Some warriors at the Sage warrior level also seem to have noticed this.

All eyes turned to Lin Xiu over there.

Originally, they all thought that a powerful warrior came here, but after seeing Lin Xiu’s figure, they frowned.

Because they clearly felt that Lin Xiu seemed to be a warrior who had just entered the Respected warrior level.

Not a powerful warrior.

But the speed at which he absorbs energy is too terrifying, right?

It seems that the energy around him is constantly pouring into his body.

boom boom boom —

After some time.

The entire ground seemed to be shaking.

“coming!”

Some warriors felt the vibration and became excited at this time.

Lin Xiu, who was cultivating originally, opened his eyes at this time.

At this time, he could clearly see that there were more warriors around than when he arrived at first.

The surroundings seemed to be crowded with people.

And the towering mountain, on the bottom side, seems to be slowly cracking open.

A ray of light slowly bloomed.

“The ruins have appeared!”

In that mountain peak, a huge hole suddenly cracked open.

Originally, it was evening and everything around became a little dark.

But at this time, because of the appearance of the light, the surrounding environment became extremely bright.

Is this a relic…

At this moment, Lin Xiu, who stood up, also looked forward.

Some warriors couldn’t bear it anymore and rushed towards the entrance of the hole!

“what!!!”

But at this time, there was a wailing scream.

Some warriors in the front can clearly see that some warriors just wanted to rush into the cave, but they were burned by the dazzling light until their flesh and blood disappeared and their bones were exposed.

When the people around saw this scene, the expressions in their eyes changed slightly.

Those warriors who were thinking of rushing in, all stopped at this moment.

This… what kind of light are these?

“Humph! These useless bums still thinking of entering the ruins!”

Some of the more powerful Sage warrior-level warriors released their body’s source strength at this time.

Forming a thin film that covered their bodies.

They walked directly into the ruins.

Because of their powerful strength, those rays of burning energy did not cause any harm to them.

They got in directly.

The Respected warrior-level warriors also wanted to use their method to enter, but they found that those terrifying rays of light quickly burned and melted their bodies.

Seeing this scene, these warriors did not dare to move forward at all.

Although the allure of the ruins is great, the threat of death made them not dare to act.

At this time, Lin Xiu had already reached the door here.

This huge cave door is filled with a lot of dazzling light.

From here, it was impossible to see what was inside.

“Boy, don’t go in and court death.”

Some warriors standing here saw that Lin Xiu wanted to go in and couldn’t help but sneer.

Because in their opinion, Lin Xiu is just an ordinary warrior.

If you want to go in, you would turn into a skeleton like those warriors just now!

Lin Xiu ignored the man’s words and walked in directly.

“Hmph, go to hell!”

Seeing that Lin Xiu ignored his words, the warrior said with a gloomy expression.

But then, something that shocked him happened.

Lin Xiu didn’t seem to use the source strength to protect his body at all and he just walked in.

Those white lights didn’t seem to have any effect on Lin Xiu at all.

“What’s going on here!”

Seeing this scene, he exclaimed in surprise.

Could it be that those rays of light are no longer lethal?

Thinking of this, he subconsciously reached out and touched those rays of light.

“Ah!!!”

But the moment he reached out and touched the past, he let out a scream.

His hand was corroded by those white rays of light. ,

At this time, he could clearly see his fingers, which turned into bones.

This heart-wrenching pain made him roll on the ground.

But Lin Xiu didn’t pay attention to this matter, he had already walked inside at this time.

As soon as he walked in, he found that the dazzling light had disappeared.

That layer of light seemed to be tightly covering the entrance of the hole.

On the ground inside, there are a large number of corpses lying there.

It seemed that the warriors who had just rushed in were of low strength and had all died.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu shook his head.

“Hm?”

But at this time, Lin Xiu noticed that the light at the entrance of the hole seemed to be a little weird.

What is happening?

Lin Xiu was startled, then walked over, reaching out to touch some of the light at the entrance of the hole.

This light, as if touched from here, materialized!

“what?”

Lin Xiu, who felt all this, had a look of surprise in his eyes.
