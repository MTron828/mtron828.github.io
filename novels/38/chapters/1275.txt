1276 To the City of God!

Rollie can speak.

This was a pleasant surprise for Lin Xiu and Baili Haoling.

But what makes Lin Xiu sad was that Rollie seems to only know how to call him by his name.

“This is considered an evolution, right?”

!!

Lin Xiu looked at Rollie who still liked to stand on his shoulder and said to himself.

Although Rollie can control his body size at will, Lin Xiu felt that the small Rollie was still quite heavy.

While Lin Xiu was talking to himself, Xiao Bai made a loud noise and flew over, hovering beside Lin Xiu, playing with Rollie.

These two evolved beasts had been together for so long and they had developed a certain relationship like playmates since childhood.

“The city lord is going to leave tomorrow?”

Sitting at a tea table in the courtyard of the City Lord’s Mansion at this time, Mr. Pang hesitated for a moment, but said aloud.

“En, it’s almost time. In another week, the Multi-city contest will be starting.”

Lin Xiu sipped his tea, then nodded slightly.

“This Lingxian City, I will leave it to you, Mr. Pang, to take care of it.”

According to the guide Pang Tong, as long as he gets a good ranking in the competition, he will have the opportunity to be canonized directly as a Noble god.

Then he wouldn’t need the so-called ‘three years’ to be qualified to go to other cities.

Otherwise, if he let go of Lingxian City and go to other cities without authorization, he will not only be punished, but he will also have no identity certificate and will have no way to enter other cities.

Unless he was attacking the city, like Changqing City and Shachang City previously.

“I will do my best.”

Mr. Pang nodded and spoke very seriously.

“I’ll go and take a look too.”

Baili Haoling said suddenly at this moment.

“But I only have one entry card…”

Lin Xiu was startled when he heard Baili Haoling’s words, then said helplessly.

And this entry card was given to him by the guide Pang Tong.

Lin Xiu could clearly feel that it was not easy to obtain this kind of entry card.

After all, the continent he was on was so vast and there were so many cities. Not all cities have quotas. 𝒂ll new st𝒐ries at n0ve/lbi/𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“I’ve checked and the city lord of each city can bring up to three people into the City of God.”

“I can stay out of the competition.”

Baili Haoling looked at Lin Xiu and the corner of her mouth curled up.

When Lin Xiu heard her words, the corner of his mouth twitched.

This woman actually knew.

Lin Xiu originally knew that he could bring his entourage there, but in order to avoid any situation, Lin Xiu originally decided to go alone.

“Anyway, I’m going to go with you.”

Baili Haoling said with a rascal look.

Thinking that there might be more powerful fighters in the City of God and that they could fight against the strong ones, the blood red color in Baili Haoling’s eyes flashed.

“Ok…”

Lin Xiu said helplessly.

“City lord, can you take me with you?”

And at this moment, Lei Tong gritted his teeth like he had made up his mind.

“You should stay in Lingxian City.”

Lin Xiu was taken aback for a moment, then said subconsciously.

During this period of time, although Lei Tong’s strength has improved rapidly, he was still a warrior of the Sage warrior level.

In the City of God where there were plenty of strong warriors, there were even more Sage warriors, all over the place.

Whether it’s fighting or going to practice, it’s not a good place to go.

“I’ve checked – there are people from the galaxy smugglers in City of God.”

At this moment, Lei Tong clenched his hands tightly, his body trembling slightly.

“Galaxy smugglers?”

Hearing these words, Lin Xiu was slightly taken aback, but he quickly realized it.

A long time ago, when he met Lei Tong for the first time, he was going to planet Marqi to find the so-called Galaxy smugglers.

Because this smuggling gang kidnapped and sold his son.

“You want to find…your son?”

Lin Xiu paused for a moment, then said.

“That’s right, I must find him!”

Lei Tong nodded, clenched his hands tightly, suppressing the excitement in his heart.

...

If it weren’t for this obsession, Lei Tong felt that he wouldn’t be alive today.

All he has to do is to survive, find and rescue his son.

“Are you sure, there are people from the Galaxy Smugglers in City of God?”

Lin Xiu looked at him.

“Yes.”

“Even if there’s a 1% chance, I’m going to look for them!”

Lei Tong nodded seriously.

“Please, I’m begging you to take me there.”

Lei Tong said while kneeling directly on the ground.

“Get up, I’ll take you there.”

Lin Xiu rubbed his forehead helplessly and said.

...

Lei Tong helped him rebuild Lingxian City and he also repaired so many buildings.

It is not difficult to take him to the City of God.

“When you get to City of God, you can’t mess around without me.”

Lin Xiu instructed.

Lei Tong’s strength was indeed not enough. If he gets mad and does something, it will be very difficult for Lin Xiu to save him.

“I will obey the words of the city lord.”

Lei Tong said seriously.

“Alright then, get ready tonight and set off tomorrow!”

This night, Baili Haoling and Lei Tong all went to bed early in order to set off for City of God tomorrow.

Lin Xiu, on the other hand, was lying on the tiles of his roof, staring at the crescent moon in the sky and the sky full of stars, in a daze.

The jade pendant around his neck gave Lin Xiu a faint chill.

In this muggy night, Lin Xiu felt comfortable.

“When will I be able to find you…”

Lin Xiu looked at the jade pendant in his hand and couldn’t help but sighed.

It has been a while since he came to the God warrior Realm, but this God warrior Realm was obviously a bit different from what he imagined.

Not only was the territory vast, but there were also countless powerful warriors.

How was he going to find Luo Yue?

“still not strong enough.”

At this time, Lin Xiu stood up and clenched his fists. Under the starlight, his fists continued to dance.

Become stronger!

Be strong enough to surpass everyone!

The location of City of God was south of Lingxian City.

The journey was extremely long.

Even if Xiaobai flies non-stop, he doesn’t know how long it will take.

Moreover, the area near the City of God has power of rules. Even if you know the coordinates, you can’t simply go there.

“It’s really troublesome.”

Lin Xiu, who was standing at the gate of the city this morning, said a little speechlessly.

“There is a space teleportation array inside the card. Use it directly to reach the nearest area of the City of God.”

“Entering the City of God requires an identity scan.”

At this moment, Pang Tong’s figure suddenly appeared in front of Lin Xiu.
