1466 Huge Gap

Lin Xiu was directly sent flying by his attack.

Lin Xiu, who flew out, spun around in the air, and quickly stabilized his figure.

Damn, how could this guy be so powerful!?

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth at this moment.

Looking at the mountains not far away, Luo Yue should be fine.

!!

“Why, you don’t recognize me?”

At this time, the figure of Huangfu Yuanshen continued to appear in front of Lin Xiu, revealing a strange smile.

Wait, this voice…

Huangfu yuanshen!?

“I remembered?”

“It’s really comfortable to have obtained the power of so many god kings.”

He said while showing a weird smile.

Now that he has integrated the power of other god kings, his character seems to have been affected as well.

He became very weird.

At this time, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes also became ugly.

This guy actually fused the power of several other god kings!?

No wonder, his power now was really too strong!

At this time, Lin Xiu continued to hold the Dark edged spear tightly in his hand, and directly stabbed at Huangfu Yuanshen!

“Hng!”

Huangfu Yuanshen seemed to sense something at this time, and immediately snorted coldly.

At the next moment, with a movement of his body, he rushed directly towards Lin Xiu!

The moment the spear in Lin Xiu’s hand stabbed out, he used his right hand to directly grab the tip of the Dark edged spear!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu’s expression changed slightly. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Boom——

Following the appearance of the Flame of chaos, a huge sound erupted immediately.

“A mere Flame of chaos…”

Huangfu Yuanshen grinned grimly at this moment, thinking that his own strength could withstand the impact of the Flame of chaos.

But in the next moment, his expression became extremely ugly.

Because he found that his right hand holding the tip of the Dark edge spear felt extremely painful.

This is really too painful.

At this time, he grabbed the right hand of the Dark edge spear and let go of it.

At this moment, the body dodged to the other side.

“Damn…”

At this moment, he took a closer look at his right hand, and he could clearly see that his right hand had become scorched black.

This Flame of chaos is really terrifying.

Even if he has integrated the power of the four god kings, he will still be injured if he directly touches the flame of chaos with his hands.

He looked at Lin Xiu. At this moment, with a wave of his left hand, the two long swords and two sabers below flew up at the same time.

These four weapons were all weapons used by those god kings.

It is also a weapon second only to divine weapons.

With a wave of his right hand, at this moment, these weapons also rushed towards Lin Xiu in an instant!

Whoosh whoosh——

This time, the weapons that charged over suddenly made a loud sound of piercing through the air.

Looking at this scene, Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted.

At this moment, the spear also started to dance.

Dangdangdang——

With the dancing of the Dark edge spear, those weapons that hit were immediately sent flying by Lin Xiu!

At the same time that Lin Xiu had hit the last attacking weapon, Huangfu Yuanshen also stabbed towards him with a long sword!

“die!”

Huangfu Yuanshen’s face also became grim at this time.

However, Lin Xiu still reacted quickly and blocked his attack with the spear in his hand.

The impact of this sword was too powerful.

Lin Xiu’s spear was crushed by his long sword.

Huangfu Yuanshen sneered, and with a swipe of his long sword, he stabbed Lin Xiu in the chest!

“Hm!?”

At the moment when his long sword pierced through Lin Xiu’s chest, he clearly felt something, and the pupils in his eyes shrank slightly.

Here!

He looked back in a blink of an eye, and saw huge flaming birds attacking him.

“Small tricks!!!”

Huangfu Yuanshen roared, and he directly broke through the space and entered it.

Those flaming birds directly charged into the sky.

And at the next moment, Huangfu Yuanshen broke through the space on the other side again, and the whole person flew out from the crack in the space again.

Holding the long sword in his hand, he instantly beheaded Lin Xiu!

Just as Lin Xiu’s body was beheaded, Lin Xiu’s figure appeared on the other side.

“Hng!”

Huangfu Yuanshen snorted coldly, held the long sword in his hand, and continued to kill the past.

Soon, all the clones formed by Lin Xiu’s cloning skills were killed by Huangfu Yuanshen.

How could there be such a strong force!?

Lin Xiu, whose main body appeared on the other side, opened his eyes wide.

After this Huangfu yuanshen has fused the power of other god kings, those powers don’t look like 1+1+1 increase…

Instead, it directly increased in multiples!

“His strength has almost reached the realm of a true god.”

At this time, the phantom of Zhulong also appeared next to Lin Xiu.

“Can you kill him?”

Lin Xiu held the spear tightly in his right hand and said.

“You can’t kill him.”

As soon as Zhulong finished speaking, his entire figure was once again hidden in the spear.

At this time, the spear emitted a more dazzling light.

It seems that it was brought about by the power of Zhu Long.

At this moment, Lin Xiu gritted his teeth as he watched Huangfu Yuanshen continue to fly over, and rushed towards him without waiting for him to come over!

“Courting death.”

Seeing that Lin Xiu still wanted to attack him, Huangfu Yuanshen suddenly showed a sneer.

Dangdangdang——

In the next moment, he held the long sword in his hand and collided with Lin Xiu’s spear.

The two frantically used their weapons to attack each other.

The current strength of Huangfu Yuanshen is constantly becoming extremely strong, and the speed is also extremely fast.

Lin Xiu’s attack was almost impossible to attack Zhonghuangfu Yuanshen’s body.

But Huangfu Yuanshen’s long sword did inflict many wounds on Lin Xiu’s body.

The sword energy on his long sword seemed to be formed by a special force, and it was able to break through Lin Xiu’s battle uniform!

At this moment, Lin Xiu could already clearly feel a sharp tingling pain coming from his body.

Although Lin Xiu not only used the Flame of chaos, but wanted to hit Huangfu Yuanshen’s body, but the reaction speed of Huangfu Yuanshen was too fast, and all the Flame of chaos released by Lin Xiu were missed!

“Garbage!”

At this time, Huangfu Yuanshen shouted angrily, and directly slashed down with the long sword he was holding!
