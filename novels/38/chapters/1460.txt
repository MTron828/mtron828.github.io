1461 The Grand Prize! The True God Armour!

What was going on?!

Pang Tong looked around and subconsciously took a few steps backwards.

As he looked, he soon noticed that even the ground was patching up.

All of the buildings have been restored to their original form.

As for those who were killed, all of their wounds were recovering as well!

The entire city was slowly returning to how it was before!

“Such terrifying strength…”

Pang Tong was in shock.

This energy could even reverse time!

Everything around him actually reverts back to its original form!

“Didn’t I…. die?”

Lei Chong raised up his hands and he was shocked.

“This…”

Mr Pang got up as well and he was confused.

“Your spirits are still here which is why I can still save you.”

Lin Xiu let out a breath of relief as well.

For warriors of higher level, the divine energy will only disappear after some time.

This was the only reason why by using the time control skill, Lin Xiu was still able to save them.

Pfft – –

However, such skills require a large amount of energy which was why there was blood coming out from the corner of Lin Xiu’s mouth.

Lin Xiu wiped off the blood on the corner of his lips and flew to the other end.

Then, he sat cross legged on a huge rock.

“We’ll rest for a day before returning to earth.”

Lin Xiu had been completely exhausted because of how he had used the ‘time control’.

It was impossible for him to use the Spatial Cube now.

Along with how the energy back on earth was sparse, it would take a long time for him to recover.

“Alright.”

Luo Yue nodded her head.

Then, she started cultivating as well next to Lin Xiu.

She had also exhausted a large amount of energy while she was on the Dark Planet.

“Lin Xiu, aren’t you going back to Lingxian City?”

Pang Tong hesitated for a minute before asking.

“No.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

“Alright. You guys continue. I will no longer disturb you.”

Pang Tong nodded his head and left.

Lin Xiu then took a deep breath and wanted to continue cultivating.

However, after thinking about it, he subconsciously entered his system instead.

He had accumulated a total of 21 draws on his lucky draw!

“There’s so much of it!”

Lin Xiu was surprised to see how many he had.

He hesitated a little before deciding to do the lucky draw.

He decided to do it 21 times in a row!

Plus, there were some things that were different on the roulette.

As he took a closer look, there were quite a few differences.

The diamond warrior skills card has disappeared.

God-level warrior skills cards have replaced it instead.

“Wow! All of the warrior skill cards are god-level and above!”

As for the other slots, there were still potential pills and some filled with a question mark. Lin Xiu had no idea what it was.

As for the grand prize, it was still there.

“But….none of these are useful to me now…”

The combat suit may still be suitable.

Afterall, it was a god-level combat suit.

Plus, the combat suits that he has gotten from the system works a little differently as they usually come with additional skills.

As for the warrior skills cards, none of them seem to interest Lin Xiu.

Then, the roulette started spinning.

Lin Xiu was still a little excited to be doing the lucky draw after such a long time.

The roulette spun and since he had 21 continuous draws, there were automated pauses in between.

After every pause, it would continue spinning.

“Ding! Congratulations master for gaining a large number of warrior skills cards!”

“Ding! Congratulations master for gaining a large number of concentrate pills!”

“Ding! Congratulations master for gaining a large number of warrior skills cards!”

“Ding! Congratulations master for gaining a large number of concentrate pills!”

“Ding! Congratulations master for gaining a large number of concentrate pills!”

“Ding! Congratulations master for gaining the godly combat suit!”

“Ding! Congratulations master for gaining a large number of potential pills!”

“Ding! Congratulations master! You have gotten the grand prize!”

Lin Xiu then heard a series of notifications from the lucky draw.

Damn!

Lin Xiu did not have much expectations about it but when he heard one of them carefully, he was surprised.

The grand prize! He was getting the grand prize!

Lin Xiu had already forgotten when was the last time that he had gotten something similar.

It has been a long time since he did this.

He didn’t think that he would be able to get the main prize this time!

Then, there was a bright light that appeared and there were countless items on the ground.

“The True God Combat Armour!”

Lin Xiu was beyond surprised when he saw the reward.

[True God Combat Shirt] : Made of the best material in the whole universe. Has the best defense system!

[True God Combat Pants] : Made of the best material in the whole universe. Has the best defense system!

[True God Combat Wrist Guards] : Made of the best material in the whole universe. Able to tremendously improve strength!

[True God Combat Talisman] : Made of the best material in the whole universe. Able to block three deadly attacks!

[True God Combat Boots] : Made of the best material in the whole universe. Able to walk thousands of miles in a day!

“Damn… looks like I got something great.”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were wide open when he saw the items.

He always thought that the grand prize would be something mundane.

Afterall, there were lesser good rewards with his current level.

However, this was a jackpot!

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and wore the True God Combat Suit.

After wearing them, Lin Xiu had a strong feeling that he was much stronger now.

It felt comfortable as well. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

The entire suit was white in color with golden brims.

It was low profile but extravagant as well.

“Concentrate pills could help with a faster recovery.”

“There’s about a hundred of them.”

Lin Xiu was surprised to see a huge bottle of it.

Then, as he ate one of them, Lin Xiu could feel that the energy in his body was quickly replenishing!

It was at a terrifyingly quick speed!

It was even faster than having to use the cultivation technique on his own.

Plus, there were also lots of warrior skills cards.

All of them were god-level cards.

“Sword Glory of Nine Zhous!”

“Spear Breaks the Sky!”

There were both sword and spear type warrior skills cards!

“This should be suitable for Luo Yue.”

Lin Xiu looked over at Luo Yue and noticed that she was focused on her cultivation.

Once she started her cultivation, she would usually be very focused.

She would not come out of it unless she felt danger.

“Right! There’s something else that I have to check.”

Lin Xiu suddenly thought of something.
