Chapter 459: Strange Energy Body

It was really exhausting to use skills in the sea.

The resistance and pressure of the seawater had a big impact on Lin Xiu.

But when Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief, he realized that the water was going into his diving suit due to the damage.

Feeling that his whole body was in contact with the cold seawater, the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

In this situation, he could no longer stay here and because he has just hit the seamount a few times, Lin Xiu found that his transparent hood has begun to crack!

If the hood breaks, it would be difficult to breathe, and then it will be over!

He looked at the ground, picked up the dagger, and inserted it into the scabbard. Lin Xiu was about to swim up.

Now Lin Xiu couldn’t care less, although he was still very curious about the artificial intelligence robot and the energy body.

But if he stayed any longer in this situation, it would be fatal.

He didn’t want to lay down his life for such a mission.

But when Lin Xiu was about to swim up, he was surprised to find that the surface was covered by evolved beasts!

The entire ocean seemed to be covered by evolved beasts. In this situation, there was no way to swim out of the water!

Boom–

And at this moment, some evolved beasts seemed to have spotted Lin Xiu and they rushed directly toward him!

Lin Xiu, who had just swum up, was hit at this moment, and suddenly began to sink again.

And this is not over yet, many of those evolutionary beasts that seem to be frantically rioting have rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Damn it!

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu cursed and he became a little angry, then he waved his fist and attacked the evolved beasts that smashed into his body!

Bang bang bang——

One after another evolved beasts died in Lin Xiu’s hands.

But these evolved beasts were endless, they couldn’t be killed at all, and fighting in the sea was also a bit difficult for Lin Xiu.

Had it not been for frequent gravity training, Lin Xiu would not be able to deal with these things at this time.

After Lin Xiu killed several evolved beasts, his entire body was hit and he fell to the bottom of the seabed.

As there was a lot of silt at the bottom of the seabed, Lin Xiu did not feel much pain at this time.

When Lin Xiu fell to the bottom of the sea, the rioting evolved beasts did not follow him.

Snapped–

But at this time Lin Xiu’s expression changed because he could feel that after the collision, his hood seemed to be cracking.

Lin Xiu hands were squeezed into fists and when he was about to gather the power from his whole body and rush out of the sea, more cracks suddenly appeared on the hood, and in the next moment, it cracked completely!

His eyes, nose, ears were in direct contact with the sea.

It’s over for him!

Without the supply of oxygen, he wouldn’t be able to last long even with the lung capacity of a warrior at the bottom of the sea.

But Lin Xiu thought it was strange that when his hood had broken off, but Lin Xiu didn’t have any difficulty in breathing.

And Lin Xiu still felt that in this state, it seemed to be more comfortable in the sea.

It was as if his skin had a breathing function.

What exactly is going on!?

Lin Xiu opened his eyes wide, his face was in disbelief.

Wait, could it be…

At this time, Lin Xiu recalled that he had unlocked the changes brought about by the rank 2 gene lock!

Some changes had taken place in his body structure. His organs were clearly stronger than ordinary people, and what was even more terrifying was that he seemed to have the ability to survive in the sea as if he originally lived in the water.

Lin Xiu was pleasantly surprised. This way, he would be able to move freely in the bottom of the sea, and he could also look for the intelligent robot and energy body.

Looking at the other side, not far away, it seemed like a bloody slaughterhouse. The rank 8 furious black whale was biting a large number of evolved beasts, and those evolved beasts were not afraid at all as they rushed over there like a moth to a fire.

Lin Xiu was surprised when he saw this scene, but he didn’t pay too much attention to the situation there. The most important thing now was to find the energy body quickly.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate anymore, he took out a radar from the pocket of the damaged diving suit, and took a closer look. The energy dot seemed to flash at the side and then disappeared.

What happened!?

Lin Xiu was taken aback. Just now, it was obvious that the intelligent robot was hit to the other side, and the energy body in his hand also fell to the bottom of the sea.

According to reason, it should be in a state of neglect now – why couldn’t he find it anymore?

However, Lin Xiu’s memory was very good. After judging where this energy body might be, Lin Xiu continued to swim there.

While swimming, Lin Xiu felt that this diving suit was simply in the way and due to the tight-fitting fit, it prevented his body from moving.

And now the diving suit was already torn, it wasn’t of much use.

Lin Xiu directly tore off the diving suit and put the dagger and radar in the pocket of his battle suit.

What are these?

Soon, Lin Xiu got to the side where he was tied up by the seaweed just now. He just wanted to see what the faint white light was underneath, but because of the collision of the evolved beast, Lin Xiu didn’t look at it.

At this time, slowly approaching over there, Lin Xiu could clearly see the white light.

This group of finger-sized objects emitting white light were floating on the bottom of the sea like an energy body.

Lin Xiu stretched out his hand and touched it, and found that these white energy bodies began to disappear in his hands.

A very comfortable sensation instantly spread from his fingers to his whole body.

This…they were not disappearing, it appeared to be absorbed by him!?

Lin Xiu was taken aback. Upon closer inspection, he found that the ‘Swallow’ skill in his system seemed to have activated automatically, absorbing energy!

He took a closer look and found that his experience bar had increased a lot!

Damn!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.
