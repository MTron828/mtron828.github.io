Chapter 294: Strange

Boom——

After Lin Xiu’s flaming Dark Edge Spear penetrated the body of the Scavenger Crow, there was a loud bang and the body of the Scavenger Crow went up in flames in an instant.

They seemed to be like those Black Tooth Spiders and their bodies were easily burned.

“Ding! Congratulations Master on killing a rank 6 Scavenger Crow and gaining 2 million experience!”

Only two million experience points, huh…

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but curl his mouth when he heard the system prompt in his mind. Compared with the five million experience of the Black Tooth Spider, this two million experience was really quite little.

At this moment, the Scavenger Crows made another sharp noise and madly rushed towards Lin Xiu.

Although these Scavenger Crows usually feed on corpses, once someone provokes them, they would also become crazy.

Their beaks were very sharp and the sunlight that shone through the towering trees next to them seemed to reflect the cold light.

Dang dang dang——

Lin Xiu was shocked when he saw this scene. He waved his Dark Edge Spear with both hands and attacked the Scavenger Crows again.

The spear did not pierce their bodies this time but hit their beaks and it sounded like metals colliding.

Lin Xiu frowned, these darn things seemed quite strong.

At this moment, the Scavenger Crows all rushed towards Lin Xiu and there was an increasing number of them.

Lin Xiu frowned when he saw this scene. There seemed to be too many of these things and they were charging towards him crazily.

They weren’t afraid of the flames he had just cast.

“Damn it!”

Lin Xiu’s right hand got pecked by a Scavenger Crow accidentally. Although he was now wearing a battle suit, he still felt a sharp pain.

Lin Xiu was also a little annoyed now. He held the Dark Edge Spear tightly with both hands and waved it harshly!

‘Awe of the Phoenix’!!!

Boom boom——

Phoenixes burst out from Lin Xiu’s Dark Edge Spear in an instant.

When the Scavenger Crows saw these phoenixes, they wanted to rush to attack Lin Xiu, but they dodged very cleverly at this moment.

While avoiding those phoenixes, they continued to attack Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was stunned when he saw this. Aren’t these Scavenger Crows a little too smart?

But at this moment, Lin Xiu had no time to waste. These Scavenger Crows were so vicious, one of them even wanted to pierce his eyes with its extremely sharp beak.

It wanted to peck his eyes out. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

Lin Xiu’s whole body tensed up. After all, this was not as easy to deal with as the Black Tooth Spider. These darn things react very quickly and would avoid his phoenixes.

“‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flowers’!!!”

When Lin Xiu watched the Scavenger Crows around him avoiding the phoenixes, he rushed towards him again, Lin Xiu snorted coldly and stabbed him again with his spear!

Although these Scavenger Crows were clever, they still didn’t know what weapon Lin Xiu would use. At this time, as Lin Xiu used the ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’, they instantly penetrated the bodies of the several Scavenger Crows that rushed over!

“Go to hell!” After slaying the Scavenger Crows that charged over, Lin Xiu turned around and continued to use ‘Torrential storm of rose flowers’. Then, he continued to kill all of the Scavenger Crows!

The system prompts continued ringing in his mind, which made Lin Xiu feel really good.

After all, no matter how few mosquito legs there were, they were still meat and the experience gained from killing these Scavenger Crows wasn’t little. One was worth 2 million and ten of them would be 20 million. As long as he killed a hundred of them, he could gain another 200 million experience!

But after Lin Xiu killed dozens of Scavenger Crows, the remaining Scavenger Crows seemed to know that Lin Xiu was so good. At this time, they all flew around and never attacked Lin Xiu.

Seeing this scene, Lin Xiu became gloomy. He initially wanted to gain a wave of experience, but if the situation was like that, there was no chance.

He shook his head and held his Dark Edge Spear, then continued to walk forward.

He should be at the front part of the Dark Forest at the moment.

It would probably take a lot of time to get to the central region.

Lin Xiu walked to the front and saw the Black Tooth Spiders on the ground that were burned by his flames.

Seeing this scene during the day, Lin Xiu was a little surprised. Now he knew that he actually killed so many Black Tooth Spiders yesterday.

He continued to walk forward, stepping on the corpses of the Black Tooth Spiders and walked to the edge of the huge crack in front.

Looking down, he could see everything below clearly because of the sunlight.

In the middle of the crack below was covered in white spider webs.

And there were a lot of spider eggs around and some small Black Tooth Spiders were still climbing up.

Those slightly larger Black Tooth Spiders had all been killed by Lin Xiu and the others. Those below now were all Black Tooth Spiders the size of a cockroach.

Their ranks were probably still very low.

Lin Xiu shook his head. Not only would he gain little experience from killing these little Black Tooth Spiders, but he would also be wasting his strength.

He looked at the other side of the crack and there were a lot of black trees in the front.

He wondered what would appear if he continued forward.

Lin Xiu hesitated for a while, then retreated a certain distance. At this moment, his body leaned forward and his legs exploded with a powerful force, rushing directly to the opposite side!

When Lin Xiu was about to reach the crack, his legs burst forth with strength and he leaped high, leaping over to the opposite side.

Boom–

Lin Xiu reached the opposite side at this time and fell heavily to the ground.

“Phew.” He slowly got up from squatting and patted the dust off his body, then continued to walk to the front.

Lin Xiu was now watching his surroundings more warily.

Because he had a feeling that it would become even more dangerous from this area onwards!

While walking forward cautiously, Lin Xiu paid attention to the scene at noon.

These black trees towered into the clouds. As Lin Xiu kept walking forward, the surrounding area became increasingly gloomy.

The sun in the sky has been completely obscured by the trees that look like umbrellas.

Lin Xiu stared at the ground, then observed that all the weeds on the ground showed signs of being trampled on.

Seems like there were many people here before.

And it was not a small number.

Lin Xiu looked at the Dark Edge Spear in his hand at this moment and squeezed it tightly.

Once there was something off, he would use the Dark Edge Spear to kill anything that threatens him.

But he continued walking for quite some time and it was eerily quiet. There wasn’t a single person and the place was completely silent.

Lin Xiu also slowly began to relax.

“Strange, there is no one here…”

Lin Xiu looked around and said to himself.

It was indeed too strange. Logically speaking, there should be many warriors here. It should be easy to encounter one. However, he didn’t see any warriors around since morning which made him more and more puzzled.

And because the tall trees here had blocked the sun, the place looked very sinister now and there was a gloomy atmosphere which made him shudder.

Swish swish swish——

Just as Lin Xiu continued to move forward aimlessly, a strange sound suddenly came into Lin Xiu’s ears.

“Who’s there!?”

The pupils in Lin Xiu’s eyes suddenly constricted and he clenched the Dark Edge Spear in his hand tightly as he quickly scanned the surroundings.

But at this time, he still didn’t see anyone appear.

This strange incident made Lin Xiu frown at this moment.

‘What exactly is going on! ? I don’t see anyone around and this voice…’

Swish swish swish——

Just when Lin Xiu felt that the surroundings were becoming weirder and weirder, that strange sound became louder and louder.

At this moment, when he looked up, a black shadow fell from above!

Lin Xiu’s eyes widened instantly and the Dark Edge Spear in his hand pierced at it directly!

Bang–

With a dull sound, Lin Xiu found that the tip of his Dark Edge Spear had penetrated a person’s body.

Lin Xiu stared at this scene and was taken aback.

Upon closer inspection, he found that his spear had pierced through a middle-aged man.

There was blood on his body at this time, not because of his spear, but because of the large number of wounds on his body.

His eyes were still wide open as if he had seen something terrifying and looked like he died with a grievance.

“He has been dead for about two days already.” Lin Xiu pulled his Dark Edge Spear out of the man’s corpse and after a closer look, he could roughly tell the time of his death.

Why would a warrior be dead here?

And he even fell from above. Lin Xiu thought that an evolved beast was coming to attack him, so he instinctively stabbed him with his spear.

Lin Xiu looked up and saw that there were dense black leaves, but still couldn’t find a reason for the man’s death.

Lin Xiu frowned. He looked at the man’s corpse, then at his surroundings before continuing to walk forward.

As Lin Xiu kept walking forward, he looked around and found that there were corpses again.

There were corpses everywhere.

The corpses of some warriors were hanging on some trees and their deaths looked very miserable.

Lin Xiu walked over and looked around carefully, but there were only corpses all around and no living person.

‘What exactly is going on?’

Could it be that these people were trying to fight over the Ice Lotus Fire?

Lin Xiu walked forward slowly and when he walked to the front, he suddenly felt that something was pulling his heel forcefully!

When Lin Xiu felt this, his expression changed and he turned around. He was about to thrust the Dark Edge Spear out when he realized that it was actually a corpse lying on the ground!

“Help…help…”

At this moment, this warrior wasn’t completely dead yet. He was lying on the ground and there were many wounds on his body.

Blood continued to seep out of his wounds.

The man was injured to this extent yet he wasn’t completely dead yet, his willpower was considered very strong.

“You are not dead yet?” Lin Xiu said to him in surprise at this time.

“Hurry up…Save me…” The warrior’s eyes were filled with horror at this time as he said to Lin Xiu with all his strength.

But as soon as he finished talking, his body twitched and he laid on the ground, his eyes still wide open, but there was no breath anymore.

“Don’t die, tell me what is going on here!” Lin Xiu shouted when he saw this.

But this warrior did not respond. He was clearly dead.

“Damn it!”

Seeing this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but hit a tree next to him.

What happened here? There were corpses everywhere in the previous area and it’s the same thing in this place.

Lin Xiu continued to look around and still didn’t find any useful information. He shook his head and continued to walk forward.

He had a feeling that if he continued to go forward, he would find an answer.

There were weapons everywhere on the ground. These weapons were all made of precious metals and weren’t ordinary weapons. These warriors were also not ordinary rank 6 warriors and there were also quite a number of rank 7 warriors.

There were even so many rank 7 warriors dead, which was really weird.

Lin Xiu thought to himself as he walked.

After walking for some time, Lin Xiu’s expression suddenly changed when he was about to walk through this area full of corpses.

Because he seemed to have seen something familiar ahead.

“This can’t be…: When Lin Xiu noticed the thing in front of him, he quickly increased his speed and rushed forward.
