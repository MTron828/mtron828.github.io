Chapter 1070: The Use of the Power of Rule

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

As he started using the energy from his source mark, there was a large amount of energy being released from his entire body.

These energies that were released from the source mark soon gathered together to form a huge evolved beast.

When another beast appeared, Lin Xiu let out a cold laugh.

“Did you really think that I don’t know how to make these things?”

With Lin Xiu laughing, there was a huge opening that appeared in the sky.

What was that?!

Bai Qiong’s eyes were stretched wide when he saw what happened.

Soon, from the space that was sliced open in the air, there was a huge evolved beast that jumped out of it.

When they took a closer look, this evolved beast that appeared from the third space looked like a huge tiger.

Roar – –

As it ran out of the opening, he let out a loud roar.

Due to the loud roar, Bai Qiong subconsciously covered his ear.

The voice of that animal was so loud that it was about to burst his eardrums.

Saint beast!

This was definitely a huge saint beast that came from another space!

How was he able to summon such a thing?

He was still looking at Lin Xiu with disbelief.

“Go!”

With the calm words coming from Lin Xiu, the evolved beast then headed straight towards the evolved beast that was formed by the energy from Bai Qiong.

As for Lin Xiu, he headed directly for Bai Qiong.

“You’re asking for it!”

Bai Qiong had a different look in his eyes as he stared at the young man coming closer to him. With the control of his mind, the sword that was tucked behind his back, flew out from behind and appeared in his hands.

Clang – –

Seeing how Lin Xiu had suddenly appeared right in front of him, Bai Qiong subconsciously pulled out his long sword, trying to block Lin Xiu’s attack!

Destiny Spear Art!

Lin Xiu was holding onto the spear and was swinging it around smoothly.

That’s when Bai Qiong saw rays of white, cold light appearing before his eyes.

He was moving his sword around as quickly as possible but he couldn’t fight Lin Xiu. All he was capable of doing was block Lin Xiu’s attack from harming him.

‘Sphere’!

Seeing how Lin Xiu’s attacks were getting sharper each time, Bai Qiong started feeling that he might not be able to withstand it any longer.

However, he had no other choice. He could only gather his energy to build his spear in order to block Lin Xiu’s attacks.

Lin Xiu’s spear landed on his ‘sphere’ as soon as it was complete.

Boom – –

With the huge explosion, Bai Qiong, who was protected by his ‘sphere’, felt a huge impact coming from the attack.

His entire body was thrown into the air.

Then, he landed heavily onto the array right behind him.

Pfft – –

Although the ‘sphere’ did not break, the huge impact coming from the attack was enough for him to vomit out blood.

Bai Chuan was still trying his best to break open the array. When he saw how Bai Qiong was being thrown far into the distance, he was in shock.

“If we don’t kill him, both of us will end up dead!”

Bai Qiong was enraged as he screamed at Bai Chuan!

Bai Chuan’s body shivered. When he realised that he would not be able to break the array, there was a sourcemark that appeared over his forehead.

He was trying to use his sourcemark to escape from this place!

But, when he tried using the energy from his source mark, he soon realised that he couldn’t use them anymore!

This….this was impossible!

When he felt that something wasn’t right, his face was filled with horror.

It felt like there was some sort of power of rule here that prevented him from using his spacial source mark.

“What’s wrong? You can’t leave?”

Then, Lin Xiu’s voice came from behind.

“What did you do?!”

After hearing Lin Xiu’s voice, he turned around and glared at Lin Xiu as he questioned him.

Not being able to use the energy from his source mark was definitely a huge defeat to him.

This meant that he wouldn’t be able to escape from this place!

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes and did not answer his question.

He was experimenting a while ago.

The Power of the Rule.

With the control of his mind, within the rage that was under his control, he would be able to set up a rule of his own.

This was something that he came up with earlier when he was at the prison.

He didn’t think that he would be able to use such a skill while being inside the array. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This rule was similar to what happened inside the prison. As long as they are inside this space, the warriors will not be able to use their spacial abilities.

“Why are you still standing there? Do you want to die together?!”

Bai Qiong started shouting at Bai Chuan.

Damn it!

Bai Chuan cursed underneath his breath. He held onto his sword as he stared at Lin Xiu.

“I’m coming for you!”

Since he couldn’t leave at all, he might as well give everything that he’s got.

As he ran towards Lin Xiu, he quickly released his ‘sphere’ as well.

Bai Qiong, on the other hand, wiped off the blood hanging from the corner of his mouth and released all of his energy.

He was aware that if Lin Xiu didn’t die, they would be the one who ended up being dead.

They had no other choice now!

Lin Xiuj stared at both of them and sneered. With both hands on his long spear, he started attacking both the men who were coming at him.

Both the men have released the maximum amount of energy from their bodies and the swords in their hands were glowing brightly as well.

Clang clang clang – –

Lin Xiu sneered once again before moving his long spear in the air.

As their weapons collided with each other, it was followed by a loud, crisp sound.

As he was using the Destiny Spear Art, Lin Xiu didn’t find it difficult even when he was fighting two men at one time.

Koong loong – –

At the same time, there were large amounts of flames that were being released.

These dark blue flaming birds directly went for the ‘spheres’ of both the men!

Koong loong – –

As the dark blue flaming birds attacked their ‘spheres’, they could feel an intense heat surrounding them.

It felt as if their bodies were getting burnt as well.

They were covered in sweat and even their combat suits were completely drenched.

Their bodies seemed to be melting away.

“Break it!”

Lin Xiu continued swinging his long spear.

Then, he aimed it first at Bai Chuan’s ‘sphere’!

Boom – –

With one loud explosion, Bai Chuan’s ‘sphere’ immediately exploded.

Pfft – –

As his ‘sphere’ got destroyed, he spat out another mouthful of blood.

As he looked up, he noticed that there was a bright ray that appeared before his eyes.

It’s over now!

Boom – –

With a soft groan, there was blood splattered everywhere.

The tip of the black spear had just pierced through his head.

He’s dead?!

As for Bai Qiong, he had just witnessed such a terrifying scene after meeting with the flaming birds.

At the same time, the evolved beast that Lin Xiu summoned through the opening managed to kill the beast that he had formed with his energy!
