Chapter 1060: Level Up! Level 67!

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

“What was this?!”

When Elder Lin and the right guardian saw what was happening, the look in their eyes changed drastically.

What on earth was that?!

Soon, with the bright blue light that was released, all of the green energy slowly disappeared.

As for the water droplets that gathered in the air, all of them rushed into Lin Xiu’s direction.

!!

Soon, they could all clearly see the water droplets going onto Lin Xiu’s body.

Lin Xiu’s entire body was initially covered in blood but then, all of the wounds started healing on their own.

Soon, all of the wounds on his body completely disappeared!

It was as good as new.

“Your strength is indeed a little peculiar.”

Lin Xiu looked at Elder Lin who wasn’t far away from him and commented.

“You…”

“How many elements do you have?”

Elder Lin’s lips started trembling as he looked at Lin Xiu and asked.

From when the battle just started, Lin Xiu has already released fire, electricity and ice.

He even had the water element!

It was incredible for someone to be able to control only one element.

But Lin Xiu was able to control so many of them!

The right guardian started trembling as well.

He thought that Elder Lin could have killed Lin Xiu.

However, he didn’t think that things would go on in this manner.

This man…..how could he be so strong?!

“From now on, it’s my turn.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and in an instant, he was able to move the energy inside his body.

As he gathered the energy, his body started glowing brightly.

This was the glow coming from the energy that was being gathered inside him.

Then, all of the energy was then pushed onto Lin Xiu’s long spear.

“He is about to use his warrior skill! Quick! Run!”

Elder Lin seemed to have felt something and he quickly screamed!

As soon as he finished, the right guardian had an awful look on his face as well.

Both of their bodies were floating in the air and were trying to find a way to dodge it.

But, they were still being trapped by the arrays around them!

They wanted to run but they had no place to go!

“You’re dead!”

Lin Xiu screamed as he looked at the men before him.

With that, Lin Xiu held onto his black spear with both hands and then swung it toward him!

Boom – –

There was a crescent being drawn in the air by the long spear and at that moment, the entire space seemed to be shaken.

Elder Lin and the right guardian were both trying their best to break the array but then, they couldn’t do so!

They turned around and looked. Then, they noticed that there was a bright light that appeared before their eyes.

Damn!

Boom – –

Their body was then instantly hit by the bright light.

Although Elder Lin had quick reflexes and released his ‘sphere’, Lin Xiu’s attacks were so powerful that he didn’t get to dodge it. The ‘sphere’ that he had released instantly exploded as well.

His body as well as the right guardian’s body instantly tore into multiple pieces!

“Ding! Congratulations Master for reaching another level. You are now at level 67!”

Then, Lin Xiu heard the notification coming from the system. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

He finally killed them.

After hearing the notification from the system, Lin Xiu finally felt relieved.

The skill that he had used earlier was naturally ‘Heaven Breaking Strike’.

This may be a powerful skill but the amount of energy needed was large.

At that very moment, he had already exhausted all of the energy in his body.

So, without being 100% sure that he could hit them, Lin Xiu would never use such skills.

He took a good look around him. The confined space that he had created with his array had been sliced open by the warrior skills used.

Lin Xiu took a deep breath and dived into the system.

Rage build-up: 0/100

Level 67!!!

Lin Xiu looked at the system interface and he was looking excited.

At such a high level, it was an extremely difficult thing to get to another level.

There were only 3 levels left till he got to level 70.

That when he could truly be a warrior god!

Then, he would be more confident to travel to the palace known as ‘warrior god realm’.

As he thought of it, Lin Xiu clenched his fist together.

“Ding! Congratulations master for upgrading! You have been rewarded with one lucky draw!”

“Ding! Congratulations master for getting the monthly lucky draw!”

As he heard the notifications from the system, Lin Xiu was a little surprised.

He had two lucky draw chances now.

But, two chances were still too few for Lin Xiu.

He would have to accumulate a little more in order to get something better.

As he returned to reality after quitting the interface, he gathered his thoughts and all of the arrays disappeared.

Lin Xiu looked onto the ground and noticed that Ji Mei and the rest had already gotten rid of Tang Qi and the other warriors.

All of the people from the Tang Pavilion, except for Bai Chuan, have been killed.

“Are you guys alright?”

Lin Xiu’s body flew back to the ground and checked on Ji Mei, who wasn’t far away.

“I’m fine.”

Ji Mei shook her head.

“This time…..I’ll have to thank you again.” Ji Mei smiled as she thanked Lin Xiu.

“Thank you.”

Bingbing and Lanlan walked closer to him and thanked him in a solemn tone as well.

If it wasn’t because of Lin Xiu, they would have all died by now.

“It’s no big deal.”

Lin Xiu shook his head.

In fact, all of these were really nothing for Lin Xiu. He even gained extra EXP and levelled up because of this.

“Where will you be going next?”

Ji Mei looked at Lin Xiu and paused for a while before asking.

“I’ll be going around, hoping to find some intel.”

Lin Xiu thought about it before answering her.

The Bai Di City was huge and he still had no idea where the Bai family was.

“Intel? Why don’t you come with us to Hao Yue Sect? We have a strong intel team at the Hao Yue Sect!”
