Translator: Dragon Boat TranslationEditor: Dragon Boat Translation

The old man of Zhuo’s family frowned, and when the sword in his hand was about to slash at Lin Xiu’s body, he saw one after another of flaming birds charging towards him!

“Insignificant skill!”

‘When the old man saw this scene, the expression in his eyes changed slightly. In the next moment, he also directly unfolded the ‘Sphere’ and directly blocked the flaming birds.

Dang–

‘Watching the old man stab him with a long sword, Lin Xiu used the Dark Edge spear to resist.

‘Heavenly Array’!

Lin Xiu roared, and a white ray of light on his body bloomed directly, and then covered the surrounding ground.

“Old guy, die!”

After Lin Xiu resisted the old man’s attack, he directly held his Dark EDge spear and continued to stab!

‘Profound intent Torrential storm of rose flowers’!

This shot was stabbed out, and instantly turned into hundreds of shots, each shot bursting with cold light.

The expression of the old man of Zhuo’s family changed slightly at this time because he could clearly feel the power of Lin Xiu’s skills.

Dang dang-

At this time, he couldn’t continue to attack for a while, and he could only hold the long sword in his hand and keep resisting.

With the sound of metal collisions, Zhuo Jia’s old man actually felt that there was a burst of numbness on his arm holding the weapon.

How can this kid’s power be so strong!

Originally, he thought that Lin Xiu’s strength was around the eighth rank, but now Lin Xiu has clearly burst into the ninth rank!

“You want to block me?”

At the same time, Nan Huang’s grandfather also wanted to rush to Lin Xiu’s side and kill Lin Xiu directly.

But when he rushed over, he found that Luo Yue appeared in front of him.

And at this time, Luo Yue looked at him with terrifying killing intent.

But no matter how strong her killing intent was, it would not pose any threat to Nan Huang’s grandfather.

The gap between a rank 8 warrior and a rank 9 warrior can be said to be an insurmountable gap.

“Die.”

Although she knew that the other party was a ninth-order warrior, Luo Yue didn’t have any fear at this time. She pointed her sword at Nan Huang’s grandfather, and said lightly.

“Joke, you dare to block me huh!”

Nan Huang’s grandfather suddenly became angry, and with a wave of his right hand, a long sword flew into his hand!

Under the moonlight, he held the long sword in his hand, which burst out with cold light, and charged directly!

Dang–

‘When the long sword slashed towards Luo Yue’s body, Luo Yue reacted quickly and used the long sword in her hand to resist it.

But even this time of resistance, Luo Yue felt her hand go numb, and the long sword in her hand almost flew out!

Luo Yue didn’t have any hesitation at this time, and directly unfolded the ‘Sphere’.

“Get out of the way, or I’ll kill you directly!”

Nan Huang’s grandfather looked at Luo Yue’s “Sphere” and it seemed that Luo Yue wanted to continue fighting with him so he said in anger.

As if Luo Yue didn’t hear his words, she held the long sword in her hand and attacked the old man!

“Boy, go to hell!”

At the same time, under Lin Xiu’s constant attacks, the old man of Zhuo’s family finally couldn’t stand it anymore. At this time, he shouted, and the light of the long sword in his hand bloomed. In an instant, the phantoms of the long swords all rushed towards Lin Xiu!

Lin Xiu raised his brows. The long spear in his hand was about to resist the phantoms of these white, translucent long swords.

But when the long spear just collided with these long sword phantoms, he found that they were like some kind of special energy body, and they actually penetrated his weapon directly, and then rushed through his body. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Just as these long sword phantoms rushed past his body, Lin Xiu suddenly felt a sharp pain in his body.

Pff—

In the next moment, a mouthful of blood spat out from Lin Xiu’s mouth.

“You can’t resist my “Deadly heart sword’ at all!”

The old man of the Zhuo family roared, and at this time, he continued to charge towards Lin Xiu!

Moreover, out of the corner of Lin Xiu’s eyes, he saw an old man with a small war hammer rushing over from his side, as if he wanted to take the opportunity to sneak attack on him.

Swoosh—

And at this moment, the old man of Zhuo’s family appeared in front of Lin Xiu as soon as he started to use his body skill!

In the same way, the old Jiang family waved the warhammer in his hand from behind Lin Xiu, and was about to smash Lin Xiu’s head directly!

Seeing this scene, the expression in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed greatly.

And just now, in order to reduce the loss of source strength, Lin Xiu retracted the ‘Sphere’.

Boom–

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t seem to have reacted at all. The long sword of the old man from the Zhuo family penetrated Lin Xiu’s chest, and the small warhammer of the old man from the Luo family directly smashed Lin Xiu’s head.

“Not him?”

These two rank 9 warriors were both cunning figures. They thought they had killed Lin Xiu, but when they attacked Lin Xiu, they clearly felt that this was just a shell!

Boom—

Just when they were surprised, a loud noise came.

Looking up, they saw that Lin Xiu’s body had appeared in the sky at some point.

And if you look closely, you can see that a sea of fire suddenly appeared in the sky. When Lin Xiu’s spear swung down in the air, the sea of fire suddenly turned into huge flame balls, and Lin Xiu charged down together.

‘Fire Refining Starlit Sky”!

“Go to hell!”

Nan Huang’s grandfather was blocked by Luo Yue at this time, so he didn’t rush to Lin Xiu’s side to kill Lin Xiu directly. At this time, he also burst out with murderous intent and wanted to kill Luo Yue.

But at this moment, he clearly felt something, and when he turned around suddenly, he saw a huge flame ball, like a meteor falling from the sky, impacting him!

The terrifying energy contained in this fireball made him also feel the sense of danger of death. At this time, he did not continue to attack Luo Yue, but spread out his body skills, and then dodged in an instant!

Boom boom boom —

The fireball hit the ground, making a loud noise, and the whole ground seemed to be shaking.

Luo Yue also reacted at this time, and quickly jumped to the other side.

“Break!!!”

At this time, Lin Xiu held the Dark Edge spear in his hand, and the spear emitted a large amount of black energy, which turned into a huge black dragon. Along with those huge flame balls, together with Lin Xiu, they went to the two below. The old man rushed over!!!

The old man of Zhuo’s family, and the old man of Jiang’s family, saw this scene in both eyes, and the expressions in their eyes changed greatly.

They could clearly feel the terrifying power contained in this skill!
