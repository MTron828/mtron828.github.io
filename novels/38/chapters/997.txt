Chapter 998: Breaking the Energy Barrier

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

As Lin Xiu roared in rage, the energy in his body was pushed onto his ‘sphere’ where the Angel’s pike was still at.

The impact of it forced the Angel to move back.

“Hmph!”

Lin Xiu sneered as he tightened his grip on the appear and started attacking the Angel that was taking a few steps back.

Boom boom boom – –

As Lin Xiu moved his spear, there were multiple dark blue flaming birds that flew out of his spear.

The flaming birds that were released flew aimlessly in the air.

They didn’t head towards the Angel and instead, gathered together.

Then, they slowly transformed into a huge flaming phoenix!

“What…..what on earth is that?!”

Gao Lin looked at the huge flaming phoenix that was right above his head, he was completely filled with shock.

How much energy would it require to be able to release such horrifying warrior skills?!

Plus, with the laming phoenix in the air, they couldn’t help but feel as if they were placed inside a huge oven.

Their entire body was covered with sweat.

Lin Xiu continued moving his sphere and the flaming phoenix rushed towards the Angel that was standing much taller than them.

“This thing….will it cause the Angel’s Tears…”

Gao Lin wiped off the sweat on his forehead as he asked his brother.

“It wouldn’t.”

Gao Chong shook his head.

“The Angel’s Tears wouldn’t be evaporated because of these flames.” Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

At the same time, the flaming phoenix was getting close to the Angel’s body and it was about to hit it any minute.

Boom – –

But, before the flaming phoenix could reach her body, there was a semi-transparent sphere that appeared around her body.

The Angel managed to block the flaming phoenix!

What the hell?!

Lin Xiu was completely shocked.

He would have never expected this artificially built angel to have something like a ‘sphere’!

The flaming Phoenix was still trying to attack the Angel’s body.

But, even so, it still couldn’t break through the Angel’s defence.

Damn!

Lin Xiu cursed silently and continued moving his spear.

‘Thousand Thunders!’

With the spear moving, there were thousands of lightning and thunder that appeared in the air!

Crackling – –

The thick currants that were coming from the lightning landed on the Angel’s body!

As soon as the phoenix disappeared, it was followed by thousands of lightning.

The Angel could also detect the strength of Lin Xiu’s attack and raised its shield above her head, trying to protect herself.

Her body continued moving backwards because of the strong currents but Lin Xiu still couldn’t break the barrier around her.

Damn! If he can’t break the energy barrier, there would be no damage done to her.

He had to continue!

Lin Xiu then chose the Heart of Frost.

The atmosphere around them that was as hot as an oven suddenly turned freezing cold.

“It’s so cold…”

Ji Mei, who was pushed aside by Lin Xiu earlier, had to hug herself.

She could feel that the atmosphere around her now was in negative degrees.

Crack crack – –

There were crackling sounds all around them as the building and the ground was now completely covered with a layer of frost.

The Angel was frozen as well!

Lin Xiu let out a sigh of relief when he saw the Angel becoming a popsicle.

It was just as he had expected, the barrier could no longer take another attack.

The only thing that he had to do now was give it a good kick and the body of the angel would turn into crumbles!

Crack Crack — –

Suddenly, Lin Xiu could hear the sound of something cracking.

Lin Xiu’s pupils shrank uncontrollably.

There were cracks that slowly appeared on the ice that was around the Angel, who had turned into an ice sculpture!

The Angel was completely unharmed as he raised the pike and attacked Lin Xiu!

Xiu xiu – –

The entire place was filled with explosions as the Angel attacked Lin Xiu.

It sounded as if the entire space was about to explode.

Her body might be huge but she was moving quickly.

The attack was too sudden and it hit Lin Xiu.

Although it didn’t pierce through Lin Xiu, he was still so badly hit that he was thrown into the distance.

His body then landed on the hard wall behind him.

Lin Xiu was completely buried into the wall because of how hard the impact was.

“Damn! The guy’s dead! Big brother, what should we do now?!”

Gao Lin asked Gao Chong what they should do next.

Gao Chong was still trying to figure it out as he sulked.

They had all assumed that Lin Xiu would be able to defeat the Angel since the skills that he had shown earlier were too powerful.

But, they didn’t think that Lin Xiu would lose to the Angel!

“Damn it!”

Gao Chong was about to tell his brothers to leave when Lin Xiu’s body suddenly appeared and was flying towards the Angel!

He’s not dead?!

Ji Mei was surprised when she saw Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was still in the air as he glared at the Angel and focused all of his energy onto the sphere that he was holding onto.

At that moment, Lin Xiu had to use his ‘Golden Body of Immunity’ to protect himself.

This Angel was much scarier than he had imagined.

But, Lin Xiu had already figured out a way to defeat her.

“Break this shit!!!”

Lin Xiu screamed in rage and the markings on the sphere lit up once again.

There was a large amount of energy that rushed into the spear that it started shaking vigorously.

There was a ringing sound coming from it as well.

‘Heaven breaking strike!!!’

The Angel seemed to be able to detect how scary the next attack from Lin Xiu would be and the energy barrier lit up around it once again.

But, the energy barrier had already taken a lot of attacks from Lin Xiu since the start of the fight and it was not as strong as it was before.

Xiu – –

As Lin Xiu flew towards the Angel , he swung his spear downwards and tried to cut open the barrier.

With the large amount of energy that the spear had, there was an opening that was sliced open in the air!

Snip!!

At the same time, the energy barrier couldn’t take it anymore and there was a huge opening on it as well!

Lin Xiu’s body rushed into the opening found on the protective barrier and sat behind the neck of the Angel.

There was a bright glow behind the Angel’s neck.

Lin Xiu did not hesitate and placed his hand on it!

Suddenly, a large amount of energy entered into the Angel’s brain through Lin Xiu’s arm.

“Analysing…”

Lin Xiu immediately activated the ‘Analytic Eyes’ and ‘Engulf’.

He wants to hack into the Angel to control it!
