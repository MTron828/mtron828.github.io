Chapter 490: I’m Here To Inform You

Because this was the only hospital in Bai Di City.

In the future world, colds and fevers rarely happened and even if people got them, they could be cured by just buying medicine at the pharmacy.

And the medicine for most of the diseases could be bought in pharmacies, only people with some very serious illnesses would go to the hospital.

This People’s Hospital was the largest hospital in Bai Di City and the only hospital.

“Hng! This is my hospital.” Liao Yi has come to his senses and said to Lin Xiu with a snarl.

“If I ask you guys to get lost, all of you have to go!”

“I’m just here to inform you.” Lin Xiu ignored his words and said lightly.

“Ridiculous!” Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Liao Yi was irritated. At this time, he balled up his hands and the blue veins on his arms protruded.

In the next moment, he jumped over the table and rushed towards Lin Xiu!

He must teach Lin Xiu a lesson!

Lin Xiu watched as he waved his fist toward him like he wanted to smash him to the ground and remained calm, then Lin Xiu threw his right fist out and collided with his fist!

Boom–

With a dull sound, the pupils in Liao Yi’s eyes constricted suddenly, and he felt the tremendous strength from Lin Xiu’s fist.

But he had no time to react. In the next moment, his body flew directly to the back like a kite with a broken string, slamming on the wall behind.

Damn… Liao Yi opened his eyes wide, relying on his left hand to support his body, and slowly got up.

At this time, he already felt an intense pain in his right hand.

Pain, very painful.

How could this be! ? How could he have such a powerful force!?

You must know that Liao Yi himself was a rank 3 warrior. Although rank 3 warriors could no longer be considered masters in second-tier cities like Bai DiCity, they were still overwhelmingly victorious against ordinary young warriors.

“Who exactly are you?” Liao Yi said aloud while looking at Lin Xiu.

A warrior who could push him back definitely meant that his rank was higher – could he be a rank 4 warrior!?

This is impossible, this guy looks so young, yet he has reached rank 4?

Liao Yi was puzzled but he became more afraid of Lin Xiu.

“Tell Zhao Xia, if he still wants to cause trouble, he should be mentally prepared to suffer the consequences.” Lin Xiu didn’t answer his question directly. After speaking, he opened the door of the room and left.

“It’s really painful…” Liao Yi watched Lin Xiu leave and sat on the chair at this time. He touched his right fist with his left hand and felt a tingling pain.

He took out an instrument and took a photo, and he could clearly see that there were some signs of cracking in his bones.

His eyes widened, and he was in disbelief.

He actually broke his bones from a fight like this!?

When Lin Xiu returned to the ward, he found that outside the ward, there were already many Federal soldiers in camouflage uniforms and they were blocking the way on the 15th floor.

All of these federal soldiers are armed with heavy laser guns, and they looked extremely well-equipped.

Lin Xiu’s face changed when he saw this scene.

“it’s him!!!”

A man seemed to see Lin Xiu returning and suddenly shouted.

Taking a closer look, there were still some scars on the man’s face.

Lin Xiu remembered clearly this he was one of Chen Jin’s lackeys.

At this moment, all the fully armed Federal soldiers were aiming their laser guns at Lin Xiu.

“He is the person who intentionally hurt people. Hurry up, bring him back. I suspect he is on the Federal Government Wanted List.” Although the man was kicked out by Lin Xiu just now, it was obvious that his skin was really thick and he was still speaking arrogantly.

“Follow us back to the Federal Police Department.” A middle-aged man in a federal police uniform stood among the soldiers at this time, looking at Lin Xiu indifferently.

“Villain accusing the victim! It was you who beat my father up first!” Ye Shuang’er’s voice also came from the ward at this time.

Luo Yue walked out of the ward directly at this time, then looked at Lin Xiu who had many laser guns pointed at him, and said, “Do you want to kill them?”

As she spoke, she pulled out the long sword wrapped in a special white cloth from behind her and said faintly.

Watching her pull out the long sword, the look in their eyes changed.

The laser guns held by most of the soldiers all pointed to Luo Yue.

“I hate it the most when someone is pointing something like this at me.”

Luo Yue showed a murderous intent in her eyes.

“Kill her!!!” Chen Jinqian called out.

Those soldiers who were holding laser guns at Luo Yue must pull the trigger directly!

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, the expression in his eyes could not help but change. When he was about to move, Luo Yue had already taken the lead!

Swish swish swish——

Those soldiers who were pointing laser guns at Luo Yue were just about to pull the trigger when they saw a lot of cold light in front of them.

When they came back to their senses, they realized that the laser gun in their hands had been cut in half!

Seeing this scene, they suddenly felt a chill on their backs.

If Luo Yue wanted to do something to them just now, their heads would probably be cut off directly!?

Thinking of this made them fearful.

“Do you know what is the consequence of fighting against federal soldiers?” The federal policeman said while looking at Luo Yue.

Although the strength that Luo Yue demonstrated just now was indeed too terrifying, the psychological quality of the Federal Police was very good and he didn’t seem to panic.

Hearing his words, Luo Yue’s face was icier with no change in expression at all, “I only know that if you guys continue pointing this thing at me, all of you will die.”

“Outrageous!!!” Hearing Luo Yue’s words, the federal police suddenly became extremely annoyed.

“I want to ask, are federal soldiers simply entitled to point laser guns at our heads?” At this moment, Lin Xiu also walked up and stood next to Luo Yue, his eyes scanned the people.

“You… you assaulted a good citizen and caused him to become disabled. According to federal law, you must be detained!”
