1380 The True Hellfire

“Oh? You know about this too?”

Lin Xiu looked at Zhang Laoshan as he spoke casually.

The Hellfire was not absorbed in the Warrior God Realm.

Although it was a powerful one, not a lot of them knew what it was.

“Of course I do.”

Zhang Laosan let out a cold laugh as he reached his hand forward. Then, there was a similar dark blue flame that appeared in his palm.

But, his dark blue flames were much darker than the ones that Lin Xiu had.

The temperature of it seemed to be higher as well.

The air around it was bending due to how hot it was.

“This is the true Hellfire.”

“The ones that you have should be some of it that fell to the other planet and that you found it by chance.”

“It’s too weak.”

Zhang Laosan spoke as he moved his left hand. He went straight for Lin Xiu without any hesitation.

When Lin Xiu saw what was happening, the look in his eyes changed.

He immediately carried Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng’s body over to the other side.

His body also disappeared with a flash.

Boom —-

The spot where they were standing earlier had been destroyed by the huge Hellfire and there was a loud explosion that followed.

As for the flaming birds that were released by Lin Xiu from his spear, all of them were dissipated because of Zhang Laosan.

The rest of the warriors felt relieved.

If the flaming birds did attack them earlier, the burning sensation was still too much even with their ‘sphere’ released.

They felt as if they were about to melt.

“Lin Xiu, run! We’re heavily injured now. We can’t fight them.”

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng tried convincing Lin Xiu.

The man known as Zhang Laosan was too powerful.

Plus, the flames that he had were an ill-match for Lin Xiu.

“We don’t have to leave.”

Lin Xiu gave a calm reply.

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng were both severely injured. Even if he used the healing skill from the water element stone, they still wouldn’t be healed within such a short period of time.

“Both of you just stay here and wait.”

With that said, a black sourcemark appeared on Lin Xiu’s forehead.

The next moment, Lin Xiu controlled it with his mind and a semi-transparent array appeared around them.

What was this?!

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng were both shocked to see what was happening.

At the same time, there were countless Hellfire that were headed at Lin Xiu!

He narrowed his eyes and dodged all of them.

Then, he appeared right in front of the old man.

Lin Xiu thrusted the golden spear forward without any hesitation. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

‘Torrential Storm of Rose Flower!!!’

XIU XIU XIU —

With the spear, there were multiple loud and huge explosions that happened in the air.

Zhang Laosan didn’t even bother running from it. He immediately released his ‘sphere’!

Compared to the others, Zhang Laosan had a different sphere as he was surrounded by a dark blue flame.

As Lin Xiu continued his attack, he could clearly feel that the spear was getting hotter.

It was obvious that his attacks were useless toward Zhang Laosan!

All of them were stopped by his ‘sphere’.

At the same time, the rest of the warriors decided to attack Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng while Lin Xiu was busy fighting Zhang Laosan.

This was because they each had three marks on their foreheads.

By killing them, there were at least two of them who would be able to leave the Misty Forest!

Crap!

Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng also noticed the warriors coming at them and looked worried

Boom boom boom – –

However, as they attacked, Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng were both shocked.

This was because as they were inside the array, nothing happened to them!

...

All of the attacks have been stopped by the array.

Plus, there seems to be no damage seen on the array.

“Just heal yourself first.”

Xiao Qingchen did not think much about it and sat cross-legged on the ground.

As for Yuan Zheng, he looked at the warriors outside the array who were still trying to kill them before clenching his teeth.

He then decided to ignore them.

“Sh*T!”

Seeing how Xiao Qingchen and Yuan Zheng were both sitting crossed legged on the ground, disregarding them, all of them were furious.

They continued attacking the array with the weapons that they had.

However, no matter how hard they tried, nothing happened to the array!

“That’s useless. You’re too weak.”

...

Zhang Laosan looked arrogant as he noticed how Lin Xiu was still trying to kill him with the golden spear.

“Once I absorb yours, mine will be perfect.”

Then, as Lin Xiu thrusted it forward once again, the Hellfire in Zhang Laosan’s hands turned into a sword!

CLANG – –

As the long spear and the sword collided with each other, there was a loud explosion that followed.

Lin Xiu felt his hands turned numb as he took a few steps backwards.

“You’re actually quite good…”

Lin Xiu quickly steadied himself as he mumbled under his breath.

Although Zhang Laosan was powerful, Lin Xiu was not afraid of him.

Instead, Lin Xiu looked excited.

His progress now was close to 80%.

But, it was still too slow.

He was now getting to level 74 and god knows when he could reach level 75?!

With such powerful warriors showing himself, Lin Xiu obviously had to make use of the opportunity!

Zhang Laosan did not allow Lin Xiu any chances to react. His figure flashed across the forest and appeared right in front of Lin Xiu. He raised the sword in his arm and aimed it at Lin Xiu!

Turning source energy into a weapon required a lot of skills from the warrior.

This was because the warrior has to continue releasing his source energy to keep the shape of the weapon.

However, the sharpness of the sword that comes from it would be much superior than any weapons found.

Lin Xiu tried blocking the attack with his golden spear.

Boom – –

Right at that moment, there was a dark blue flame that was released from the spear!

“Dirty tricks…”

Zhang Laosan thought that Lin Xiu was still trying to release his Hellfire and laughed instead.

However, he had a shocking look on his face!

He….even looked frightened.
