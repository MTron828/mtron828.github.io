Chapter 250: Deep Blue City

With Guo Ling leading, Lin Xiu and the rest followed and walked towards the gate of the academy.

There was a separate building next to the gate. A middle-aged man in uniform was typing on the keyboard in front of the machine inside.

“Which mission?” The middle-aged man saw Lin Xiu and the others approaching, and asked indifferently.

He was probably used to having people coming here.

“S39.” Guo Ling answered.

Hearing that, the middle-aged man frowned slightly, then looked at Guo Ling and the others and began to tap on the keyboard.

“Guo Ling, Lin Xiu, Qiu Li, Chen Jin, Wan Qianshui. Qian Lin.”

While looking at the information on the screen, he glanced at Lin Xiu and the others. After confirming that it was them, he nodded.

“Set off now?”

“Yes.” Guo Ling replied.

“Sure, take your own information card and board the airship at the gate of the academy in five minutes.” After a while, the middle-aged man seemed to have completed all the processing and said to Lin Xiu and the others.

It should be the same as before, taking the airship to fly out.

Lin Xiu thought to himself at this moment.

But where exactly is this Sacred Region Academy located? Lin Xiu didn’t really understand why it had to be so concealed.

When Guo Ling and the others walked to the gate, the guards verified their information and let them proceed.

After walking out of the huge gate, they could see the scenery outside.

Across them was an endless sea with no boundary in sight.

Boom boom——

After a while, an airship slowly landed here.

This airship looked much smaller compared to the previous airship that went to the G17 Ruin.

“Are you the students of the S39 mission?” Then, an old man who had white hair and a ruddy complexion walked down and smiled at Lin Xiu and the others.

“Yes.”

Guo Ling walked over, nodded, and said aloud.

“En, I need to verify your information. Please take your information card out.” The old man nodded and said to Guo Ling and the others with a special machine in his hand.

Guo Ling took out her information card and as she swiped it on the machine, her information was shown on the machine.

The old man nodded, then looked at Lin Xiu and the others behind.

Although it was a bit cumbersome, Lin Xiu walked up with his information card and swiped it on the machine.

“Freshman?” Seeing Lin Xiu’s information, the old man was surprised.

Then he sized Lin Xiu up.

According to the data, Lin Xiu was a freshman. Although he has the strength of a rank 5 warrior, if he goes to the Dark Forest, it was almost akin to death.

“Yeah.” Lin Xiu nodded.

“Good luck to you.” The old man smiled and said to Lin Xiu.

This made Lin Xiu a little unhappy. He didn’t say it out, but it was as if Lin Xiu would be doomed there.

Soon, everyone stepped onto the airship.

There was a spacious hall on the airship, which was very well decorated, just like a cafe.

“Okay, let me brief you guys first.” When the old man finally got on the airship, the airship shook a bit and began to take off.

“Your mission location is the Dark Forest, but the Sacred Region Academy doesn’t have a station there, so we’ll stop at the nearby Deep Blue City which is closest to the Dark Forest.”

Lin Xiu nodded. He has checked all the information and was not surprised to hear this now.

But Lin Xiu’s eyelids were twitching a little at this moment.

As the saying goes, when the right eye twitches, there is going to be a disaster – could it be that something was about to happen?

But Lin Xiu shook his head quickly, he was over-thinking.

Even if there were any evolved beasts, he’ll just kill them all!

As it was a long journey to go to the Deep Blue City, everyone closed their eyes to rest and continued to improve their bodies through the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

They also absorbed the energy of the surrounding air, ensuring their source strength was at the fullest at any time.

After some time, the airship shook slightly and they heard a machine announcement:

“Arrived at destination, arrived at destination…”

Hearing this, Lin Xiu opened his eyes.

“We’re here.” The old man smiled and said aloud as he pressed a button next to him with his right hand. Then, the airship’s door opened and formed a staircase down.

Dazzling sunlight shone in from outside.

“Let’s go!”

Guo Ling stood up and said to Lin Xiu and the others.

The other four second-year students seem to be familiar with each other and were walked in front together.

Lin Xiu followed behind, looking a bit lonely.

But Lin Xiu didn’t really care about these things, anyway, he went to the Dark Forest this time not only to complete this so-called mission to earn points.

He wanted to kill evolved beasts to level up and also to see if he would meet Luo Yue.

After all, Luo Yue was only a rank 5 warrior and it was indeed very dangerous here.

The moment they walked out, they realized that they were on the roof of a tall building.

There were some signs of the Sacred Region Academy around.

Looking around from this rooftop, there were tall buildings everywhere and the main color of the city was mainly blue with white to complement.

Blue and white together just like the sky.

“I navigated and there is no private car from the Deep Blue City to the Dark Forest. We can buy a mechanical mount now and head to the Dark Forest.” Guo Ling said aloud as he walked down the roof.

“You guys have no objection, right?”

“Of course.” The rest of them nodded and said without hesitation.

“Lin Xiu, what about you?” Guo Ling looked over and asked.

Lin Xiu nodded in agreement.

It was mountain roads throughout the journey from Deep Blue City to the Dark Forest, it was more troublesome to travel by car.

Driving a mini airplane wouldn’t work as well because the fog in the sky was very thick and it has a strong magnetic field, which can cause the airplane to lose control.

This was also one of the reasons why the airship couldn’t land there directly.

The mechanical mount has artificial intelligence, it could also be operated manually and the speed was very fast.

It was indeed a very convenient means of transportation for warriors. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Walking down this building, Lin Xiu could see that there were a lot of people in Deep Blue city.

There were also many warriors walking around with weapons on their backs.

“Let’s go and take a look over there.” Guo Ling’s eyes lit up as he looked to the front.
