Chapter 518: Forces From Every Direction

On their way there, Lin Xiu noticed that there were a lot of warriors who were in groups that were headed towards the same destination.

It was obvious that their destination was also the Thunder Valley.

He also noticed that most of these warriors were rank 5 warriors and there were also a large number of them who were rank 6 warriors.

It seemed that this space crack that appeared in the Thunder Valley was very attractive to these warriors.

“Hey … .are both of you headed for the space crack?” Just as Lin Xiu and Luo Yue continued traveling, a middle-aged man with a beard and a smile on his face walked over and blocked Lin Xiu and Luo Yue in their path.

“Both of you aren’t strong enough to do so. You should leave.”

Luo Yue and Lin Xiu looked at each other and decided to ignore him as they continued walking forward.

“Boss! That fella just ignored you!” The subordinates of the middle-aged man frowned and said in a cold tone.

“Hmph! Forget it then. I wanted to take them in but it looks like they have no idea about the dangers of the Thunder Valley.” The middle-aged man snorted.

As his eyes landed on Luo Yue, there was a greedy look in his eyes.

“Looks like these people think that we’re here for the space crack.” Lin Xiu said helplessly.

This was the first time that they’ve been in the Thunder Valley and the most important thing that they were here for was to train his body with the strong lightning that the Thunder Valley created.

Well, who knew that it would coincide with the space crack that suddenly appeared?

“We can look for it too.” Luo Yue replied in a blunt manner.

Although they have heard that the space crack was in Thunder Valley, no one actually knew where it was located.

Plus, there was a lot of terrifying lightning that would appear in the sky above the Thunder Valley which was why most of the electronics would be destroyed as soon as they got close to the valley.

Therefore, they would only be able to find the location of the space crack with luck.

Koong Loong – Koong Loong –

As they continued moving forward, Lin Xiu heard a loud thunder.

“Look! Over there!”

There were a few warriors around who screamed in shock.

As he turned towards where the thunder was coming from, he saw the valleys that were mentioned and there were several thick lightning that came from the sky. It looked incredibly scary.

“Why are you making such a big fuss out of it? The Thunder Valley has always been this way.” After hearing how some of them were overreacting, some of the warriors who were already used to it ridiculed the rest of them.

Lin Xiu was shocked as well when he saw the lightning that appeared in Thunder Valley.

The lightning here was indeed terrifying. If an ordinary person was struck by this lightning, he would probably be wiped out in smoke.

But for Lin Xiu, this lightning has no effect at all on him.

Well… other than strengthening his body. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

It didn’t take long for them to notice the huge stone gate that appeared right before their eyes.

There were two huge words that were engraved onto it:

‘Thunder Valley’

The massive stone gate looked solemn and must have been around for quite some time.

Plus, there were a large number of warriors gathered by the entrance of the valley.

There were also a lot of vendors who had stalls that were selling odd crystals, combat suits, and weapons.

“We are from the Purple Power League. If there’s anyone who found the location of the space crack, please let us know and you would be rewarded greatly.”

At that moment, there was a muscular middle-aged man that appeared by the entrance. After taking a good look at the scene before him, he glanced at the warriors that were gathered and said with his fist held against his chest.

“That’s Elder Bai from the Purple Power League, a rank 7 warrior. Can’t believe he’s here as well.”

When one of the warriors heard what he said, the warrior then turned towards his comrade.

“He is a rank 7 warrior?”

Some of them were shocked as well when they heard what the man said earlier.

Most of them here were mostly rank 5 or rank 6 warriors. When they heard that there was a space crack in the Thunder Valley, most of them were just here to try their luck. They didn’t think that there would be a rank 7 warrior here.

Plus, this was a man from the Purple Power League. They were an extremely powerful league amongst the warriors!

“Hmph! Elder Bai, you’re way too confident in yourself.” Just then, there was another group of people who walked through the stone gate.

The man leading them was a huge man who looked fierce.

He was entirely covered with a murderous aura and he seemed like a dangerous person to be with.

“Wan Lu from the Gymnasium! He is a rank 7 warrior as well!”

When they saw him, all of them exclaimed in shock as well.

“Hmph!” Elder Bai from the Purple Power League sneered when he saw the man.

“I have already announced that the space crack belonged to the gymnasium. If there’s anyone who doesn’t report to us about it, you would be responsible for the consequences.” Wan Lu glared at the warriors that were around and warned them out loud.

When the rest of the warriors heard his arrogant words, there were a few of them who were triggered as well as Wan Lu was being too full of himself.

“It’s yours just because you said so?” Then, there was a middle-aged man who stood up and screamed at Wan Lu.

“Are you challenging me?” Wan Lu saw the man who stood up and chuckled as he asked the man.

As he laughed, his cheeks shook.

“Hmph…did you think that you are the only rank 7 warrior here?” The man who stood up held onto his sword and sneered at Wan Lu.

This man had a strong murderous aura as well and with one look, it was obvious that he wasn’t a friendly man as well.

“He’s about to die.” Luo Yue looked at the scene before them and said to Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was stunned and he continued watching the scene unfold before his eyes. Then he noticed that the young man with the sword was already dashing towards Wan Lu!

“You should know that there is a difference between warriors who have just entered rank 7 and those who are of the best amongst the rank 7 warriors.” Wan Lu looked at the man dashing towards him and gave a close laugh.

“Hmph!” The man with the sword sneered as he activated his ‘yuan’.

At the same time, he pierced his long sword towards Wan Lu’s body!

But then, Wan Lu remained on his spot and did not move at all.

“Go to hell!” The man noticed how Wan Lu wasn’t even dodging and even showed a provocative smile. He immediately got angry and roared as he thrust his sword with the overwhelming murderous aura towards Wan Lu!

Boom – –

At that very moment, Wan Lu moved and he caught the man’s sword with his bare hands!

How was this possible?!

The crowd watching the fight was surprised as well.

“Hehe…. Let me show you what a true rank 7 warrior is like.” Wan Lu sneered as he clenched his fist and threw it onto the man’s ‘yuan’!
