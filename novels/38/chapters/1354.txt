1355 Evolved Beast Black Shadow (Part 1)

Please enter the translation

The roar was so loud that Lin Xiu felt his head hurting from the shock.

Damn, what kind of monster is this?

Lin Xiu’s complexion also became ugly.

!!

After experiencing the chaos just now, the warriors around began to dodge the attacks of those vines and at the same time began to fight back.

Bang bang bang——

A large number of vines were cut or destroyed at this time.

These warriors have discovered that as long as they are not entangled by those vines, then it would not be a problem.

After about ten minutes, these vines had completely disappeared.

“Finally gone?”

Sun Wei watched this scene and immediately wiped the hot sweat from his forehead.

There were too many vines just now and once they were entangled in them, they would be in danger.

“I don’t know what kind of monster it is, so be careful.”

Lu Guangyue also heaved a sigh of relief at this time.

Looking around, he found that those vines just now hadn’t returned.

Boom, boom, boom——

But before everyone could breathe a sigh of relief, the entire ground began to vibrate again!

What is happening!?

Feeling the vibration of the ground, everyone’s expressions changed drastically.

Could it be that the monster with a large number of vine-like tentacles is coming over!

While everyone looked around, a huge black shadow rushed out instantly.

boom–

Before a warrior had time to react, he flew out directly.

His body exploded from the middle and was directly divided into two halves. It looked extremely terrifying!

“This… what is this…”

Sun Wei’s body trembled and his eyes were full of fear.

Now there were only sixteen warriors left.

Lu Guangyue’s complexion also became uglier and uglier.

It seemed that he felt something. At this moment, his right hand holding the saber also trembled slightly.

“What’s wrong?”

Lin Xiu glanced at him.

The sight of the huge black shadow just now was too fast and he didn’t see clearly what happened.

“The Netherworld unicorn is out.”

Lu Guangyue firmly held the saber in his hand.

Staring at the front side.

Netherworld unicorn!

As soon as Lu Guangyue spoke, the warriors around were shocked.

They also never expected that the Netherworld unicorn actually appeared at this time.

Dealing with those terrifying vines just now consumed a lot of their strength.

Before he could catch his breath, the Netherworld unicorn appeared again.

“Be careful! If you run now, you will die!”

Lu Guangyue spoke to everyone at this time.

After hearing Lu Guangyue’s words, everyone clenched their weapons tightly and did not dare to run away.

At this time, Lin Xiu also looked around.

But that huge black shadow had already disappeared at this moment.

He released his perception ability, but he couldn’t perceive any evolved beasts around him at all.

“Interesting.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly at this moment.

Originally, he wanted to come to this Netherworld Forest to find the Netherworld Flame, but now it seems that he needs to get rid of this so-called Netherworld Unicorn first.

“Behind!”

At this moment, Lu Guangyue seemed to think of something and immediately growled.

As soon as he called out, at this moment, everyone looked behind at the same time.

A huge black shadow charged over from behind!

At this time, Lin Xiu also saw clearly that it was a huge black shadow.

...

This black shadow looks like the outline of a huge evolved beast.

The crowd didn’t try to intercept the approaching black shadow and directly dodged in all directions.

But at the same time that everyone dodged, there was another huge black shadow that was exactly the same rushing over.

No, there was more than one!

Lin Xiu looked around and he found that these black shadows were charging from all directions.

They are all attacking everywhere!

“ah!!!”

A God warrior looked at the huge black shadows that charged toward him and his expression changed drastically.

He has no way to dodge!

At this moment, he let out a huge roar and in the next moment, he unfolded the ‘Sphere’!!!

Bang bang bang——

...

Three huge silhouettes of evolved beasts rushed over from three directions.

The ‘Sphere’ he unfolded was hit by these black shadows and a large number of cracks appeared immediately.

Poof——

He vomited out a mouthful of blood.

But those dark shadows also disappeared at this time.

The man was about to show a smile after being saved, but at the next moment, another huge black shadow rushed over.

This black shadow was becoming more and more visual now, like a giant running beast.

boom–

As it charged from behind, the man’s ‘Sphere’, which was already filled with a lot of cracks, exploded in the next moment!

At this moment, his body was directly split into two halves by the impact!

Another warrior died!!!

“ah!!!”

These terrifying black shadows are still coming from all directions and some warriors have been driven a little crazy.

They directly released an incomparably large number of skills with large-scale attacks.

Boom, boom, boom—— Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

At this moment, the entire ground vibrated crazily.

A large amount of attribute energy continuously erupted around and the extremely tough trees around were all destroyed in this instant.

A large number of potholes appeared on the entire ground.

But no matter how they attack, there was no way to cause any damage to those huge black shadows.

Conversely, if they were hit by those black shadows, it would be a very strong blow even for a God warrior.

One would be seriously injured!

“Damn…”

At this time, Lu Guangyue’s face became ugly and the saber in his hand slashed fiercely, hitting those black shadows, but it seemed like it hit the air.

At this time, Lin Xiu’s body also flew into the sky.

Because a large number of tall trees were destroyed, Lin Xiu, who was flying in the air, could clearly see that there are a large number of black shadows below, constantly charging toward Lu Guangyue and others.

These dark shadows should have been made by the Netherworld unicorn.

But Lin Xiu still couldn’t find where the Netherworld unicorn was.

“What kind of ability is this…”

Lin Xiu has never seen an evolved beast that can release such a powerful ability.

No wonder Lu Guangyue wanted so many people to come and hunt them together.

Just as Lin Xiu was searching for the figure of this monster in the sky, he seemed to suddenly feel something.

Lin Xiu turned around abruptly.

Then he saw a bloody mouth appearing in front of his eyes!
