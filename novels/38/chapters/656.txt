“Oh? It seems that Junior Lin Xiu has something going on.”

Huang Zhen also joked at this time.

“By the way, I heard that when you were in the academy, you were with someone all the time? Who is that…”

Qian Yao also seemed to have thought of something at this time, and then said aloud.

After spending time together for a while, everyone has gotten along very well. At this time, there was no embarrassment when making fun of each other.

“You guys go have a big meal, don’t make fun of me.”

Lin Xiu spread his hands helplessly and said.

“Okay, since Lin Xiu has something to do, don’t make it difficult for him.”

Bai Litao touched his beard and said with a smile.

It could be seen that Bai Li Tao was in high spirits, with an undisguised look of joy on his cheeks.

“By the way, Lin Xiu, come here, I have something to tell you.”

But at this moment, Bai Litao seemed to have thought of something, then waved at Lin Xiu and said aloud.

Lin Xiu was startled, then nodded, then stood up.

The after-effects of ‘Fury’ didn’t last long. At this time, Lin Xiu felt that the strength of his body was already recovering.

At this moment, he stood up and followed Ouyang Hang to the front.

“Although you defeated Sky Academy this time and killed Nan Huang, I don’t want to congratulate you.”

At this moment, Bai Litao said with a serious expression on his face.

“How should I put it.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes, Bai Litao seemed to have something to say to Lin Xiu.

“Because from now on, your situation is very dangerous.” “You killed Zhuo Qixing of the Zhuo family, Jiang Feng of the Jiang family, and Nan Huang of the Nan family.”

“The people of the four major families in Sky City, except for Yu Muchen, you have already killed the young generation with the most potential of these three families.”

When Bai Litao said this, his head started aching.

He would have reminded Lin Xiu earlier on if he had known. Now that Lin Xiu had offended three of the four major families at once on someone else’s territory in Sky City, this was simply courting death. The background of these four major families was very strong, and even Bai Litao himself did not dare to directly confront them.

“I’ll kill them then.”

Lin Xiu said lightly. These people, Lin Xiu must kill. Because even if Lin Xiu didn’t kill them, they would still want his life!

Thinking of this, Lin Xiu also revealed a killing intent in his eyes. “But there’s nothing you can do now. You should leave here quickly.”

Bai Litao thought for a while, then said to Lin Xiu.

“En, can I do it tomorrow?”

Lin Xiu nodded. Thinking of the terrifying rank 9 warriors like Nan Huang’s grandfather today, Lin Xiu also agreed after weighing the pros and cons.

He was not a stubborn person. On the contrary, Lin Xiu was very rational.

With his current strength, even if he used all the system skills, he couldn’t be a match of that old guy.

Because this guy should have reached the peak of a rank 9 warrior already. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Well, I’ll make arrangements, just contact me tomorrow morning.”

Bai Litao patted Lin Xiu on the shoulder and said. “If there’s nothing else, I’ll go first.”

Lin Xiu nodded.

“Well, be careful. It’s best you come back and stay with our Sacred Region Academy tonight.”

Bai Litao warned.

“Sure.”

After experiencing the assassination time in the lounge, Lin Xiu also knew that these guys might not give up so easily, and someone might assassinate him again.

So it was safer to go back to the branch building of the Sacred Region Academy in Sky City at night.

“Oh yes, the reward for this finals.” At this moment, Bai Litao seemed to have thought of something, and then took out a box and handed it to Lin Xiu.

“You wouldn’t be there for the post-match interview, right?”

“Not going.”

Lin Xiu shook his head and took the box.

This box looked very delicate. The material was a special kind of wood, which exuded a faint fragrance.

What is this?

Lin Xiu was a little curious, and opened it directly.

As soon as it was opened, Lin Xiu felt a faint white light.

A pendant.

This pendant was like purple jade, in the shape of a peculiar water drop, which looked very transparent. At this time, as the surrounding light shone, the purple jade seemed to turn into a water drop. But as soon as there was no light, that peculiar feeling disappeared.

“This is the most precious Purple imperial star jade from another planet. Wearing it will greatly increase the speed at which the energy in the air gathers.”

At this time, Bai Litao said with a smile.

“There is only one reward for this, Ouyang Hang and the others agreed to give it to you.”

“Haoling…”

“She doesn’t need it.” Bai Litao shook his head and said.

“Then I’ll take it, thank you.”

Lin Xiu closed the wooden box directly, and said to Bai Li Tao.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Bai Litao smiled and said, “Go ahead.”

Lin Xiu also smiled and left immediately.

Holding the box at this time, Lin Xiu picked up his Dark Edge spear and went to the other side.

After walking over to the front, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the surrounding environment seemed to be a lot calmer than the lively scene on the platform.

He looked to the front, and under a tree, Lin Xiu could see a familiar white figure.

“You’re here?”

Lin Xiu stepped forward and smiled at her.

“En.”

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu in front of her and saw that Lin Xiu didn’t seem to be injured. For some reason, she was relieved in her heart.

“Why? Are you going to fulfill your promise?”

Lin Xiu seemed to think of Lin Xiu at this time, then looked at Luo Yue, and said deliberately.

“What.”

Luo Yue was startled, then said subconsciously.

“I won.”

Lin Xiu didn’t say it directly, but smiled.

Luo Yue, who was still a little stunned and didn’t respond, suddenly turned red.

Under the faint illumination of the surrounding street lamps, she looked beautiful.

Lin Xiu looked at Luo Yue at this time, and suddenly felt that his heart seemed to be beating a little faster.

At this time, Lin Xiu didn’t know where the eagerness came from, then reached out and held Luo Yue’s hand, then looked into her eyes and said, “Be my girlfriend.”

Luo Yue looked at Lin Xiu at this time, feeling the temperature in Lin Xiu’s hands, her face seemed to turn even redder.

At this moment, she dodged Lin Xiu’s eyes, but she didn’t draw her hand out. She replied in a small mosquito-like voice, “En…” “Really!?”

Lin Xiu was extremely surprised at this time.

Luo Yue glared at Lin Xiu at this moment. Seeing Lin Xiu’s smile, she couldn’t help but chuckle.

Her chuckle was indeed very charming..
