Chapter 373: Star Warrior

“Eh?”

Lin Xiu seemed to sense something while he was cultivating with his eyes closed and opened his eyes immediately.

Then he saw a white light shining through his pocket.

“What is going on?!” Lin Xiu subconsciously took out the jade-like ore from his pocket.

At this time, the ore seems to be emitting white light.

And Lin Xiu also felt that the jade seemed to have a very warm and gentle feeling.

But as Lin Xiu took out the jade, the light on the jade seemed to slowly weaken again.

What exactly is going on!?

“When you were running the ‘Cultivation Technique’, this ore probably reacted.” Luo Yue, who was next to Lin Xiu, looked at this alien ore and said aloud.

“When you’re cultivating, did you feel anything?”

Hearing Luo Yue’s words, Lin Xiu was taken aback, then subconsciously started the ‘cultivation technique’ again.

Soon, as Lin Xiu’s body was absorbing the energy in the air, Lin Xiu was able to clearly feel as if his cultivation speed seemed to have strengthened slightly!?

This…

Lin Xiu was surprised at this time and when he took a closer look, the light from the alien ore seemed to have become a little stronger.

“This thing seems to be helpful for cultivation.” Lin Xiu looked at the alien ore in his hand, then said aloud.

“But how do you forge this ore together with the Dark Edge Spear?”

Lin Xiu looked at the Dark Edge Spear next to him and mumbled to himself.

The old man said that this thing was an excellent forging material and with his status, he shouldn’t be lying to him.

But Lin Xiu was not familiar with this aspect of forging and Lin Xiu was a little worried if he let someone else forge it for him.

After all, this ore was very precious and it was the kind that can only be discovered and not sought.

Otherwise, these people in the Deep Blue City would not make such a big fuss and want to take it back.

“There will be a way.” Luo Yue said with a meaningful smile at this time.

Seeing this, Lin Xiu wanted to say something when he saw Luo Yue was already sitting on the ground with her eyes closed and was practicing the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but curled his lips when he saw this scene and also closed his eyes to practice.

They were no longer sleepy in the middle of the night.

Soon, it was the next morning. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

As soon as Lin Xiu opened his eyes, he felt a faint light shining on his eyes.

“So early?”

He opened his eyes and saw that Luo Yue had stood up, then sat next to the computer not far away, typing on the keyboard quickly, as if she was looking for something.

“Yeah.” Luo Yue nodded and said while looking at the computer screen, “It’s almost time, let’s go down first.”

Lin Xiu looked at the clock on the wall. It was 7 o’clock in the morning.

According to what the old man said, around 8 o’clock this morning, they would be able to take the spacecraft and leave.

“Sure.”

Lin Xiu stretched, then stood up.

After washing up, he carried his backpack and held the Dark Edge Spear, then left the place with Luo Yue who was already prepared.

They took the elevator and quickly reached the first floor.

At this time, at the front desk over the hall, there were already staff members in uniforms.

“Eh? What about the old man?” Lin Xiu was a little confused, then walked over to the front desk.

This old man seemed to have disappeared today?

A staff member at the front desk stared at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue who came by at this time, took a closer look, then seemed to know who they were, then said aloud, “Are you Mr. Lin and Miss Luo?”

Although Lin Xiu was a little surprised at how she recognized him and Luo Yue, their information was already keyed in when they checked in this place so it wasn’t strange.

“Yeah.”

Lin Xiu nodded and when he was about to say something, the woman in the Sacred Region Academy’s work uniform continued to say, “Dean Xia has made arrangements for you. You may go to the waiting hall at the top level.”

“Where did he go?” Lin Xiu asked.

The woman froze for a moment, then showed a standard smile and said, “We don’t know where the dean is.”

With the woman leading, Lin Xiu and Luo Yue quickly reached the roof.

Not far from the roof of the building, there were some staff members who were repairing some buildings on the side.

These buildings must have been destroyed last night.

“By the way, the dean asked me to give this to you.”

As Lin Xiu and Luo Yue were sitting on the chairs waiting for the spacecraft to take off, the staff member just took out two folded cards from her pockets and handed them to Lin Xiu and Luo Yue respectively.

What is this?

Lin Xiu was taken aback but still took the folded red card.

“I’ll make a move first.” The woman smiled at this moment, then left.

Lin Xiu looked at the folded card in his hand, only to see the red card with the LOGO of the Warrior Union, which looked very domineering.

What is this?

Lin Xiu was a little curious, then unfolded the card.

“Invitation card?”

Taking a closer look, this turned out to be an invitation letter to participate in the warrior assessment.

“Warrior assessment, I remember I have already participated in it…” Lin Xiu said to himself.

“No.”

But at this moment, Luo Yue suddenly shook her head.

“This is the star warrior assessment.”

“Star warrior assessment!? Could it be…”

Lin Xiu was still a little stunned, but in the next moment, Lin Xiu suddenly realized.

In addition to the warrior qualification assessment, there was also a star warrior assessment next!

The different star ratings have different statuses in the Warrior Union and the high-star Warriors could participate in some meetings of the Warrior Union. This would play an important role in running for important positions in the Warrior Union in the future.

Basically, as long as you participate in the star warrior assessment, you could successfully become a star warrior, even if you are a one-star warrior, it is very awesome.

Taking a closer look, there was a time at the bottom of this invitation letter.

“February next year!?”
