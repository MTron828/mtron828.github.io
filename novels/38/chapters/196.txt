Chapter 197: Broken Arm

Lin Xiu charged at Cheng Fan and swung Dark Edge.

The spear was like an extension of Lin Xiu’s body as he attacked Cheng Fan endlessly.

Cheng Fan gritted his teeth and stared at Lin Xiu as he waved his own weapon.

Lin Xiu’s momentum was too strong and he was able to feel the pain in his hands whenever he blocked an attack.

‘Impossible, how is he suddenly growing stronger!’

‘He must have eaten some forbidden medicine. As long as I can tide over his attacks, it’ll be my turn soon!’

Lin Xiu frowned. Cheng Fan was focusing on avoiding his attacks and would only defend instead of attacking.

He clearly wanted to waste time.

‘Cheng Fan thinks I’ve consumed some forbidden medicine and wants to drag until it wears off.’

‘But Fury will render me weak for 10 minutes after it ends. If it comes to that, I’m done for!’

‘No, I need to kill him now!!!’

Clank clank clank

As Lin Xiu unleashed Torrential storm of rose flowers, his spear transformed into multiple black shadows!

But Cheng Fan’s reaction was too fast, he was able to use his broad saber and block all of Lin Xiu’s attacks!

‘Damn!’

Lin Xiu frowned, his opponent was completely guarded and did not find any opportunities to attack him.

This meant he had a harder time looking for flaws to deal with a fatal strike.

Cheng Fan’s mouth curved upwards, he could sense Lin Xiu’s anxiety.

‘Seems like I’m right, as long as I can hold on for a few more minutes, Lin Xiu will be spent!’

“Go and die!!!” Lin Xiu’s pupils constricted as his speartip unleashed flames right onto Cheng Fan!

“It’s useless!” Cheng Fan bellowed and exerted force as he blocked the attack with his weapon.

But a strange thing occurred.

The flames on Lin Xiu’s spear suddenly spread onto his palms when their weapons collided!

‘What is going on?!’

Cheng Fan’s eyes opened wide when he looked at the flames.

“Ahh!!!” His hand was actually charred black by the flames!

Immense pain could be felt from all 10 fingers as Cheng Fan howled in anguish.

This was the Red Lotus FIre unleashed with his source strength!

Although it exhausted a lot of source strength to unleash the flames, the might of the flames was extremely dangerous!

Chance!!!

Lin Xiu immediately followed up with Dark Edge and stabbed Cheng Fan’s chest!

Cheng Fan had not lost his rationality even while in pain. He moved his body to the side as an attempt to dodge!

Bang-

But his reaction had dropped and the spear went right through his arm!

Cheng Fan’s eyes bulged open as he ripped his right arm off with his left without hesitation!

Blood sprayed everywhere.

After ripping his own arm off, he charged into the mist and scurried away.

“Where do you think you’re going!!!” Lin Xiu charged forward when he saw Cheng Fan escaping. His body flickered as he thrusted his spear towards Cheng Fan’s back, when his entire body froze.

A sense of weakness spread over his entire body!

‘Oh crap!’

Lin Xiu lost focus and his entire body fell to the ground.

He no longer had an ounce of strength in him.

‘Damn it, just a bit more. Just a bit more and I would have killed him, how can I lose strength now!’

Clank clank clank-

On the other hand, Luo Yue was still fighting the other two warriors.

The two rank 5 warriors were under a great deal of pressure. Although they were using their skills to attack Luo Yue, her skills were too terrifying and she was able to avoid their attacks with ease.

But they were both rank 5 warriors! And they were rank 5 warriors with an abundance of fighting experience!

They were actually using so much effort against a young lady, and were almost killed by her!

“Zhao Long, kill that brat!” One of the rank 5 warriors blocked Luo Yue’s attack and his eyes darted to see Lin Xiu lying on the ground. He immediately roared out loud to his comrade!

Zhao Long immediately turned his gaze to see Lin Xiu lying on the ground. His eyes were filled with killing intent as he turned and charged towards him!

Luo Yue’s pupils constricted at the sight of this. She erupted with power and flickered in front of him.

“Seeking death!” Luo Yue’s gaze turned cold. The sword in her right hand turned into frost as she slashed towards him!

The man froze with opened eyes, he did not expect Luo Yue’s speed to increase even further.

They were barely resisting against her two against one, but Luo Yue had suddenly appeared before him with speed and power surpassing that of before. He could not even react!

Bang-

Blood splattered everywhere as his entire body was cleaved into two!!!

Even his robes could not withstand the attack.

The other guy turned pale when he witnessed the death of his comrade.

Although they had killed many before and used even more brutal methods.

The thought of dying scared him even further.

‘Run, I need to run!’

That was his only thought.

But would Luo Yue watch him run away? The answer was definitely no.

“Where’re you going?” Just as he was about to dive deeper into the mist, Luo Yue leaped upwards and blocked his escape. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“I am from the Moon Wings Corps! If you dare kill me, you’re dead!!!” The man trembled but found the strength to shout.

Any ordinary person would not dare provoke their unit.

But he was mistaken about one thing.

Luo Yue was no ordinary person.

“Then go and die.” Luo Yue ignored his words and slashed at him!

Without hesitation.

Bang-

Her sword was too fast that the fearful man was not even able to react.

In a split second, his body was cleaved into two!
