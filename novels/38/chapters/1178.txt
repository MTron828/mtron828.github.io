1179 Heading for Manhuang City

After hearing what Mr Pang said, Lin Xiu nodded his head in satisfaction.

Always kill the leaders first. Looks like most of the warriors who had bad intentions would not have the guts to enter Lingxian City.

“Get me all the information about Manhuang City. I’ll be leaving soon.”

Lin Xiu quickly stood up and told Mr Pang.

!!

“Of course!”

Mr Pang nodded his head.

Lin Xiu walked away as well.

WIthin three days, the part of City Lord Mansion that was destroyed had been completely redone.

It was impossible for anyone to see that it had been destroyed.

“There shouldn’t be anyone else who would come here now…”

Lin Xiu looked up at the sky and muttered to himself.

However, there were a large number of warriors that died that day. There was a possibility where others would come forth to investigate what had happened.

This included those from the Murder Shrine and Luanxuan Palace.

“City Lord, the information is ready.”

Mr Pang had gathered all the information about Manhuang City and all of them have been downloaded onto a smart watch before passing them to Lin Xiu.

“En.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head before wearing the watch.

He looked at the invitation that he had received earlier and placed it in his expansion space.

“For the next few days, you will be in charge of looking after Lingxian City.”

After making all the necessary preparations, Lin Xiu gave his orders to Mr Pang.

“Of course.”

Mr Pang quickly nodded his head.

Then, Lin Xiu walked out of the City lord mansion and got on the streets.

“Greetings, City lord!”

Most of the warriors who were on the street greeted Lin Xiu when they saw him.

With how Lin Xiu has modified the city in the past few days, Lingxian City is now completely different from before.

It no longer looked like an abandoned city and the whole place looked fresh.

The warriors of Lingxian City truly respected Lin Xiu from the bottom of their hearts.

When Lin Xiu walked out of the city, he looked at the map that was found on the smart watch.

“This way?”

As he read the map that was being projected from the watch, he frowned.

This was because it would be a long journey from here to Manhuang City.

Ever since Lin Xiu got to the warrior god realm, he hasn’t visited anywhere else.

He wasn’t familiar with the areas and could only continue travelling with the directions given from the smart watch.

There were still 3 days before the meet.

That would be more than enough.

Lin Xiu continued travelling and he was amazed by the scenes of the warrior god realm.

The greeneries here were entirely different from those on the other planets that Lin Xiu has been on.

All of the plants here were incredibly big. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

Most of the trees were so tall that they went into the sky.

After walking for 2 days, Lin Xiu finally reached the foot of a mountain.

Hei Wu Mountain.

According to the map, once he passed this mountain and continued forward, he would arrive at Manhuang City.

But, this mountain was different from the rest as it was extremely dangerous here.

Roar– –

Lin Xiu had just arrived when he heard a loud roar.

Lin Xiu didn’t even have the time to react and that’s when a dark shadow came onto him!

His pupils shrunk uncontrollably and out of habit, he quickly shifted aside.

The black shadow then landed on where Lin Xiu was standing before.

Boom – –

As it landed, there was a huge explosion and the entire ground started shaking.

Lin Xiu, who dodged the attack, looked at the black shadow and he could see that it was a huge beast. It was standing where Lin Xiu was earlier.

Due to how the beast had landed on the ground heavily, there were dents all over it.

By using the Analytical Eyes, Lin Xiu could clearly see that this was a Black Soul Beast. Its power was similar to a beast god.

When the beast realised how it had failed to hit Lin Xiu, it started roaring loudly.

The beast glared at Lin Xiu and the beast could feel that there was a strong energy coming from Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was prepared to kill this beast that revealed itself to him but the beast turned around…..and left!

“It ran away?!”

Lin Xiu’s eyes were wide open when he saw what happened and he didn’t know if he should be laughing.

The beast looked fierce, the kind where it will fight till its death. Lin Xiu didn’t expect it to just run away.

The birds that were on the branches of the tree above Lin Xiu flew away as well.

Huh?

Lin Xiu was surprised to see what was happening.

Why were all these beasts running away?

Did something happen on the mountain?

In order to get to Manhuang City, he had to walk past this mountain. Although Lin Xiu could guess that something wasn’t right, he still had to continue moving forward.

Boom boom boom – –

As Lin Xiu continued walking up the mountain, he could clearly hear the noises of a fight with his good hearing.

It was obvious that this was not a fight between men and beast.

There were warriors fighting on top of the mountain?

Lin Xiu hesitated a little before continuing forward.

“Tsktsk! You came all the way here so you will have to leave everything behind!”

On a flat piece of land before him, there was a muscular, tall warrior who was holding onto a huge axe on his shoulder.

There were twenty warriors who were surrounding another group of warriors in the centre.

There were also bodies found all over the ground.

It looked like these men had just been killed.

“Teng Yuan! We can give you whatever you want!”

One of the men who was being surrounded, held onto a longsword, sat close to his comrade as he screamed at the muscular warrior before him.

There was blood dripping from the corner of his mouth and it was obvious that he was severely injured as well.

“What I want….?”

Teng Yuan smirked as he said, “I want your lives.”

All of the other warriors were shocked to hear what the man wanted.

“We were invited to join the meet at Manhuang City! Aren’t you afraid that you will be questioned for what you have done today?!”

One of the warriors gritted his teeth as he asked.

Teng Yuan was incredibly powerful and his men were the same as well.

They have already lost a lot of lives during the fight earlier. If they continued to do so, it wouldn’t be beneficial towards them.

There was a chance where they would end up being killed.

“Hehe! The city lord of Manhuang City? Do you really think that he’ll find out about this?”

Teng Yuan was bothered with what the man said and he let out a cold laugh.
