Chapter 1067: Escape

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Each time the long spear was swung in the air, it would be followed along with a large splash of blood.

With the fresh blood being splattered all over the wall, the warriors from the Bai family fell onto the ground one by one.

Within a short period of time, all of the warriors were dead on the ground.

There was only one left.

He was the captain of the team.

“You…”

The captain noticed that Lin Xiu was staring at him and his body started shaking uncontrollably.

He wouldn’t have expected that Lin Xiu was someone so powerful.

He managed to kill all of the warriors on his team within such a short period of time.

Even if they were fighting a sage warrior, his team wouldn’t have been annihilated so quickly.

This man behind the mask. Who was he?!

Then, there were cold sweats that soon appeared on his forehead. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Well, you would be next.”

Lin Xiu held onto the long spear that was now covered in fresh blood as he walked toward the captain.

“Stay there! Don’t come here!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was already moving, his eyes were filled with fear.

His body then slowly moved backwards.

This was because Lin Xiu had shown that he was an extremely powerful man while he was killing the other warriors.

Plus, the energy from his domain was completely suppressed by Lin Xiu and he could no longer use them.

“Move!!!!!”

Seeing how Lin Xiu was still coming towards him, he screamed in rage and there was a purple sourcemark that appeared on his forehead.

With the bright source mark that appeared, there was a thick, purple lightning bolt that was targeting Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu did not release his ‘sphere’. Instead, he allowed the purple lightning bolt to touch his body.

Sizzling – –

When the purple lightning got into contact with Lin Xiu’s body, there was a loud explosion that followed.

The ground around Lin Xiu was completely toasted as well when lightning struck.

However, the man that got struck by the lightning remained unharmed.

“You…”

The man’s eyes were filled with fear.

Previously, he had thought that Lin Xiu would not make it in time to release his ‘sphere’ and he assumed that he would be able to kill Lin Xiu with the lightning bolt.

However, he didn’t think that Lin Xiu wasn’t afraid of lightning.

This made him even more devastated.

The lightning bolt that he was most proud of did not cause any harm to Lin Xiu. Was there any other way where he would be able to kill Lin Xiu?

“Please. I beg you. Please let me go!”

Just as Lin Xiu was standing right in front of him, there was a loud ‘thud’ as he fell onto his knees.

He was looking extremely frightened.

He didn’t want to die!

“The warriors of the Bai family turned out to be such cowards.”

Lin Xiu mumbled to himself.

Then, there was a large amount of purple lightning bolt that appeared all over Lin Xiu’s body.

Sizzling – –

As the lightning was released, all of them headed toward the warrior!

Noooooo!!!!!!

The man might have resistance toward electric current but the lightning bolts that were being released by Lin Xiu were much more powerful than his.

The currents were coming at him very quickly and he didn’t even have the time to release his ‘sphere’. Before he knew it, the electric current completely covered his entire body!

As he was being attacked by the current, the warrior’s body started trembling uncontrollably.

His skin was also quickly turning black and it was extremely obvious to the naked eyes.

There was also white smoke in the air.

In the end, the man’s body turned into ash.

“Ding! Congratulations master for killing a respected warrior. The EXP rewarded…”

Then, there was a notification that appeared in his mind.

However, killing a respected warrior was bringing EXP that was way too low for Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu didn’t even bother looking at it.

“Uncle Ye, are you alright?”

Lin Xiu went back to Uncle Ye and asked in concern.

“I’m fine now.”

Ye Kai was able to stand on his feet.

The injuries all over his body have slowly recovered.

Plus, he could also clearly feel that his body was now filled with energy.

“Young master, your abilities have improved tremendously!”

Ye Kai was also feeling excited.

As Lin Xiu got stronger, the chances of reviving the Ye family would be higher.

“Let’s talk after leaving here.”

Lin Xiu nodded his head.

“We should bring them along…”

Ye Kai nodded his head and suddenly paused as he thought of something.

Before he could finish, there was a swift sound that came from the other side.

When they looked at where the sound was coming from, they saw the bodies of the other men that were brought along with Ye Kai being chopped into pieces.

It was a gruesome scene.

Ye Kai looked at it with his eyes open wide.

The person who did that was filled with rage and he was coming at them.

“We have to go.”

Then, Lin Xiu quickly grabbed onto Ye Kai.

This was because he could clearly feel that there are other sage warriors that have appeared.

Just like what Bai Zhanfei had mentioned earlier, the Bai family has hundreds of sage warriors in the family.

Although he had no idea if this was the truth, it would definitely be a problem for them if all of the sage warriors were coming together.

It was already difficult for Lin Xiu to deal with five sage warriors together.

If he had to fight a hundred of them? It would be a joke.

As soon as Lin Xiu grabbed onto Ye Kai, he leaped and quickly activated ‘Flashing Souls’.

Xiu – –

With a blink of an eye, Lin Xiu and Ye Kai disappeared into thin air.

“Where are they?!”

At that instant, there was a huge group of warriors dressed in a white combat suit that arrived at the scene.

When they saw the floor that was filled with bodies, the warriors looked mad.

“Hunt for them! Find me the man that breached into this place! Find them!!!”

Just when the Bai family was in chaos, Lin Xiu had already brought Ye Kai to an abandoned factory that was on the other side of the city.

Since this area was not developed yet, the entire area was in a mess and there was wild grass growing everywhere.

“Those warriors were from the smaller families that were willing to be allies of the Ye family when I went exploring.”

“Initially, we were supposed to look for help from the Chen family but we didn’t think that they would have already forgotten their promise. They welcomed us to their house and then betrayed us by informing the Bai family to come and capture us.”

As he was telling the story, Ye Kai clenched onto his fist and his nails were dug deep into his palm.

It was obvious that Ye Kai was now frustrated.

Especially when he thought of the warriors who have been innocently killed by the Bai family, his eyes turned red as well.

“The Chen family is in Bai Di City as well?”
