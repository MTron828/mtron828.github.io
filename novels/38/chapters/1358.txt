1359 Can’t Get Close!

What are you doing!

When Lu Guangyue looked towards Lin Xiu, she realized that Lin Xiu had already flown towards the Netherworld Unicorn.

It seems that he still wants to fight the Netherworld Unicorn!

Lin Xiu ignored his words and continued to rush toward the Netherworld Unicorn.

If the Netherworld Unicorn is good at other abilities, he probably still needs to prepare countermeasures.

But what it is planning to release now was obviously an electrical attribute ability.

Lin Xiu, who was extremely resistant to electrical attributes, was not afraid at all.

“Courting death.”

Lu Guangyue looked at this scene, thought about it, and still dodged to the other side.

Looks like this plan will fail again.

At this time, as Lin Xiu rushed towards the Netherworld Unicorn, many powerful electric currents gathered on its horn.

At the same time that Lin Xiu was about to rush in front of him, those incomparably powerful electric currents burst out directly and rushed toward Lin Xiu!

Crackling——

At this moment, these terrifying electric currents seemed to be like a huge power grid, trying to cover Lin Xiu completely.

There was a burnt smell in the surrounding air.

Lu Guangyue had already dodged to a nearby location and looked at the terrifying electric current, with an expression of tremendous shock in his eyes.

From his point of view, Lin Xiu was doomed to die.

However, the scene where Lin Xiu would be electrocuted until his whole body was scorched black did not appear.

At this time, Lin Xiu let those terrifying electric currents surround his body and rushed directly in front of the Netherworld Unicorn.

At this moment, he waved his hands directly.

‘True Fire Fist’!!!

With Lin Xiu’s fist swing, two huge Fire fists suddenly appeared and following Lin Xiu’s movements, they continuously bombarded the Netherworld Unicorn’s head.

Boom, boom, boom——

The Netherworld Unicorn didn’t seem to have thought that Lin Xiu was not afraid of those electric currents at all. At this time, Lin Xiu’s True Fire Fist directly blasted its head.

This Netherworld Unicorn was originally at the end of its strength and the last strength did not cause any harm to Lin Xiu.

At this moment, it could only endure Lin Xiu’s attacks unilaterally.

Following loud noises, the body of this netherworld beast began to crumble again.

Soon, its head was blown apart by the huge fire fists.

A lot of blood spattered out continuously.

Boom——

Its huge body finally fell to the ground in the next moment.

Ding!

“Congratulations, Master, for killing the Netherworld Unicorn and gaining experience 6494456487…”

At this time, there was also a system prompt that he gained experience.

Dead.

This Netherworld Unicorn, this time, was really dead.

“Hu, I’m so tired.”

Lin Xiu was sitting on the ground at this moment and couldn’t help but take a deep breath.

This Netherworld Unicorn was really too powerful. If he didn’t use the ‘Fury’ skill, he couldn’t deal with it by himself.

After resting for a while, Lin Xiu stood up.

Looking at the corpse of the Netherworld Unicorn, with a move of his right hand, the sword that fell on the ground flew directly into Lin Xiu’s hand.

Walking to the front of the Netherworld Unicorn’s head, with the sword in his hand, he slashed down!

boom–

With a dull sound, the head of the Netherworld Unicorn was split in two.

Some red and purple things sputtered out immediately.

Lin Xiu unfolded the ‘Sphere’ to directly block the splashed white and purple objects.

“Huh? This odd crystal…”

After its head was split open, a dazzling light appeared.

If you take a closer look, you can clearly see that an odd crystal emitting white light.

This odd crystal was different from what he imagined, it was a small odd crystal.

“so small…”

Lin Xiu muttered to himself at this moment.

Originally thought that such a powerful evolved beast must have very large crystals.

Unexpectedly, it turned out to be such a small one, only the size of a baby’s palm.

...

After taking the odd crystal into his expansion space, Lin Xiu took the sword in his hand and chopped off the Netherworld Unicorn’s horn.

The horn of this Netherworld Unicorn was very weird. Not only was it extremely heavy, but it also seems to contain extremely powerful energy.

The weird prints on it flickered like breathing lamps.

“interesting…”

When Lin Xiu saw this scene, his eyes were full of surprise.

“De… Dead?”

At this moment, Lu Guangyue also rushed over from the other side.

He saw from a distance that Lin Xiu seemed to knock down the Netherworld Unicorn. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Taking a closer look at this moment, Lin Xiu had chopped off the head of the Netherworld Unicorn.

“En, it’s been dealt with.”

Lin Xiu nodded slightly.

...

“Now that they are all dead, do all the remaining rewards belong to me?”

Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something at this time, staring at Lu Guangyue and said.

“Each person only has one…”

Lu Guangyue was startled and said subconsciously.

“Forget it then.”

With a thought, the horn of the Netherworld Unicorn disappeared in Lin Xiu’s hand in an instant.

“Disappeared?!”

Seeing this scene, Lu Guangyue had a change of expression.

Could it be that he has space storage props?

At this moment, Lin Xiu didn’t pay any attention to him and made a gesture to leave.

“Wait!”

Just when Lin Xiu was about to leave, Lu Guangyue hurriedly said.

“Okay, I’ll give you all of their share! As long as you give me the Netherworld Unicorn’s horn and its Odd crystal!”

Lu Guangyue hurriedly said.

Because these things are really important to him!

“Well, when we go back and you give me the things, then I’ll give them to you.”

Lin Xiu smiled slightly.

“But…”

Lu Guangyue was shocked and looked as if he wanted to say something else.

“This thing is useless to me, don’t worry, I will come to the Blackwater Mansion to look for you again.”

Lin Xiu seemed to have guessed what he was going to say and said lightly.

“Are you not going back yet?”

Lu Guangyue said subconsciously.

“Yeah, I don’t want to go back yet.”

“There is still something I need to do.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly at this moment.

Netherworld Flame, he must find the Netherworld Flame.

Oh right, this guy should know about it, right?

vDo you know where there is Netherworld Flame?”

Lin Xiu asked at this time.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Lu Guangyue, who was about to ask Lin Xiu what he wanted to do in Netherworld, was startled.

“You can’t get close to that kind of flame!”

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, Lu Guangyue immediately said.

“This is the most terrifying flame in the Netherworld. Once you get close…”

Lu Guangyue’s face was full of horror like he recalled something.
