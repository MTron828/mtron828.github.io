Chapter 928: Beast Saint

With the help of the analytic eyes, Lin Xiu could clearly see the statistic of the fire scaly dragon;

Name: Flooded Fire dragon

Level: Beast Saint

Specialty: A dragon flooded in flames with an incredibly strong physique and terrifying destruction abilities.

Although the information from the analysis was little, Lin Xiu was still shocked when he read about it.

A Beast Saint!

This was the first time that Lin Xiu had met such a high ranking evolved beast!

“Hahahahah! I never thought that beast saint still existed!”

At the same time, there were voices coming from another side of the room.

There was someone else here!

The look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed completely.

He wouldn’t have expected that there were others here and he didn’t even notice them earlier.

He looked up and saw one of them floating in the air. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

There was also a large amount of energy coming from the man.

“Those from the Divine Domain do move quickly.”

At the same time, there were three other people who appeared in the room.

All of them were floating in the air!

Lin Xiu took a closer look at them and noticed that all of them were surrounded by large amounts of energy.

Sage warriors?!

Lin Xiu swept through all of them with his analytic eyes and noticed that all four of them that were in the room were sage warriors!

This was the first time that Lin Xiu has met any sage warrior that was still alive and he has to be more cautious about it.

These sage warriors were not on the same level as the respected warriors.

They were much stronger!

Lin Xiu knew that with his current strength now, he wouldn’t be able to fight them.

“The White Troops, The Black Troops and the Zhao family would have never thought that the three of you from different gangs would be here together.”

The sage warriors from the Divine Domain sneered as he saw the three men who had just entered the room.

Sage warriors from the White and Black Troops?

Lin Xiu thought about it for a moment and realised that these two must be the founders of the White and Black Troops.

Roar!!

The Flooded Fire dragon suddenly roared out of control.

As he opened his mouth, there was a terrifying golden flame that came out of its mouth!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

All the sage warriors moved and managed to dodge the attack.

“Let’s forget about the grudges between us. Let’s kill it first?”

The sage warrior from the Divine Domain moved to another corner and asked the other three sage warriors who were with him.

After asking, the other three warriors hesitated for a moment as they were suspicious.

However, when they saw how the flooded fire dragon was pouncing on them, one of the sage warriors nodded his head.

“Sure.”

The sage warrior from the White Troops and the Black Troops seemed angry at each other but they still nodded their heads in agreement.

This was a beast saint Flooded Fire Dragon and they would not be able to defeat it alone.

Crack – –

There were loud explosive sounds that rang continuously as the four sage warriors started fighting the flooded fire dragon.

As for Lin Xiu, he was hiding in the back and was watching the battle with a glistening look in his eyes.

This was an eye opening experience! It was incredible!

These sage warriors were able to use their warrior skills as they pleased.

Although some of them looked simple, the effect of it was huge.

It looked just like Gods playing with their powers.

Lin Xiu said on the ground with his legs crossed and activated his ‘Cultivation Technique’, trying to absorb all of the energy around him while watching the battle.

This flooded fire dragon was extremely powerful!

As it continued to attack, the entire space started shaking violently.

However, the four sage warriors were skilled as well.

As they were fighting the beast saint, they still had the consideration to not destroy this palace.

Although the flooded fire dragon was tough, it still wasn’t a match for the four sage warriors.

Lin Xiu stared at the flames that were coming out of the mouth of the flooded fire dragon and he narrowed his eyes.

This beast saint would definitely have odd crystals that were different from the other evolved beast.

If he could absorb the odd crystal, the strength of his flames would increase tremendously!

As he thought about it, the look in Lin Xiu’s eyes changed.

The fight continued for a moment and with the combined effort of all four sage warriors, the beast saint soon fell onto the ground.

Koong Loong – –

As the Flooded Fire Dragon fell on to the ground, the entire ground shook.

“It’s dead?”

Lin Xiu stood up immediately.

It has taken them an entire day to kill this flooded fire dragon!

Suddenly, Lin Xiu heard footsteps coming from behind them.

He took a closer look and noticed a large number of warriors coming from the entrance.

Hmm?

With the Flooded Fire Dragon dead, the power in the path seemed to have been dismantled.

“What is this?!”

When the warriors stepped into the room, they could see that there was a huge flooded fire dragon on the ground before them.

The huge, flaming red body of the Flooded Fire Dragon surprised them.

“Black Dragon! I will finish you off today!”

The sage warrior who was dressed in completely white turned towards the sage warrior who was dressed in black.

“Haha...White Dragon! It has been so many years but how come you never learn? If you could kill me, you would have been able to do so years ago!”

The man known as the Black Dragon laughed.

“Let’s put it to the test then.”

There as a murderous look that appeared in White Dragon’s eyes.

“If you are not worried about how this place might be ruined and we will all die here, you can continue with your battle.”

The sage warrior from the Divine Domain and the Zhao family suddenly said simultaneously.

After hearing what the others said, they paused.

“This place was left behind by the strongest sage warrior, Di Feng. We may all be sage warriors but we are nothing compared to him.”

This Secret Realm was different from the others. If their battle got out of hand, it would destroy the entire place.

By then, they would all be dead even if they were sage warriors!

Plus, they already had a tough battle with the Flooded Fire Dragon and this place was no longer stable.

“We came here for the treasure, didn’t we?”

“Since we already found it, let’s divide it amongst each of us and leave.”

“You can think of your grudges and fight after we leave here. What do you think?”

The sage warriors from the Divine Domain and the Zhao family suggested to them.

The White Dragon and Black Dragon stared at each other before slowly letting go of the thought of killing each other.

“How should we divide these treasures?”
