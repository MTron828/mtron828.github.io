Chapter 259: Rank 6 vs Rank 7

“Is this guy really just a rank 5 warrior?” Qiu Li clenched the sword in his hand, looked at the terrifying flames released by Lin Xiu, and was startled.

Lin Xiu’s strength really exceeded his expectations.

Strong, too strong.

“Not bad, pretty good.”

Just as everyone thought that Zhou Wenhao got hit by the huge fireball and was about to be burned, a voice suddenly came out from the sea of fire.

Hearing this, Lin Xiu’s eyes widened.

Still not dead yet?!

Boom——

A deafening sound rang out and the flame tornado dissipated in an instant.

Zhou Wenhao’s figure could be seen in it.

At this moment, Zhou Wenhao looked a little battered because of the flame; his hair was burned and there were black marks on his combat suit.

There was a ‘sphere’ formed using source strength around his body.

Obviously, because of this “sphere”, most of the damage he suffered was completely ward off.

“You’re strong but you’re very wrong if you think that Zhou Wenhao’s strength is simply just that!” Zhou Wenhao’s expression became savage and his gaze was bloodthirsty because he got hit by Lin Xiu.

He no longer looked indifferent like before.

As he spoke, he dashed towards Lin Xiu with the giant sword in his hand!

He no longer treated this like a game and saw Lin Xiu as an opponent of the same level.

At this moment, his speed has reached the extreme and appeared in front of Lin Xiu like a shadow.

With the huge sword in one hand, he slashed at Lin Xiu’s body abruptly!

Dang dang dang——

Lin Xiu originally wanted to fight back, but when the Dark Edge spear in his hand collided with Zhou Wenhao’s huge sword, there was a loud noise.

Lin Xiu was holding the Dark Edge spear with both hands. At this time, he felt a throbbing pain, and there was a faint tingling sensation in his hand.

Moreover, there were many sword auras bursting out of Zhou Wenhao’s giant sword.

Just blocking the attacks, the sword auras hit Lin Xiu’s arm, giving him a tingling sensation.

“Go and help!”

Guo Ling looked at this scene and said suddenly.

As Lin Xiu rushed out to fight Zhou Wenhao just now, they had time to recover. At this moment, as Guo Ling spoke, she sprinted over with her long sword!

Qiu Li and the others looked at each other, nodded, and rushed over as well!

Zhou Wenhao originally wanted to use his full strength to swing his giant sword, killing Lin Xiu directly.

However, he seemed to sense something and looked around. Suddenly, he saw Guo Ling and the rest coming from all directions!

“Damn it!” The expressions of the people in the protective shield changed when they saw this scene.

Zhou Wenhao, who had been injured slightly by Lin Xiu’s fireball, now had to face these rank 6 warriors again – can he still win?!

And at the same time, there was Lin Xiu, a warrior who constantly used weird skills.

“Let’s stay in here.” Some warriors saw this scene and wanted to rush out to help, but they were stopped by the young man who led them.

“They are no match for the vice president’s strength!” The young man clenched his fists and said in a low voice.

He was also a little afraid at this time. If they rushed out, they would probably be killed by those rank 6 warriors.

This was the first time he felt so helpless.

They were rank 5 warriors!

“You guys are from the Sacred Region Academy!?” Zhou Wenhao looked at Guo Ling and the others who were attacking at this time and immediately stopped attacking Lin Xiu as he turned around and blocked Guo Ling’s sword that was stabbing over.

He saw the Sacred Region Academy’s logo on Guo Ling’s combat suit and immediately asked.

Guo Ling did not answer and continued to attack him.

Qiu Li and the others also attacked Zhou Wenhao once again!

The five rank 6 warriors headed by Guo Ling held their weapons and used their powerful skills.

Boom boom——

Suddenly, loud noises rang again and again.

The whole ground seemed to shake at this time.

At this time, Zhou Wenhao had no way of attacking Lin Xiu again because of Guo Ling and the rest. Lin Xiu heaved a sigh of relief.

The strength of this rank 7 warrior was strong indeed. When he first fought with him, Lin Xiu almost couldn’t keep up with his movements.

But Lin Xiu still has one more skill.

His ‘Fury’ skill had not been used yet.

Either he doesn’t use this skill at all or if he used it, he must kill Zhou Wenhao with one blow as the aftereffects were quite severe.

Guo Ling and the others were still fighting Zhou Wenhao over there.

After being sent flying by Zhou Wenhao’s skill, Guo Ling and the others were now using their skills without any reservation.

Suddenly, these five people appeared to be equal in strength with Zhou Wenhao.

Lin Xiu looked at the people inside the protective shield and his eyes turned gloomy.

Holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he walked over there.

“Hehe, you think you can do anything to me?” The young man in the protective shield suddenly sneered as he watched Lin Xiu walking towards them with the Dark Edge spear in one hand.

The defensive ability of this kind of protective shield was very strong, it was impossible for Lin Xiu to break this protective shield and rush in.

“Is that so?” Lin Xiu stared at him and said faintly.

At the next moment, Lin Xiu clenched the Dark Edge spear with both hands and stabbed at the protective shield!

Bang bang bang——

The tip of the Dark Edge spear hit the protective shield and it suddenly shook.

The young man was shocked when he witnessed this.

He was in the protective shield and still took two steps back.

His eyes were full of shock when he looked at the Dark Edge spear that was constantly piercing the shield at an extremely fast speed.

But this protective shield was indeed very scary. No matter how hard Lin Xiu stabbed it, there was no way to pierce through this thing.

“Hahaha! This is the latest scientific and technological achievement. As long as the protective shield is unfolded, even missiles might not be able to break it!” The young man suddenly laughed loudly when he saw this.

He was relaxed as Lin Xiu didn’t look like he could break the shield. This allowed him to heave a sigh of relief.
