Chapter 723 Inheritance

“Sure enough…this…this passage is not the right one.”

The man wiped the cold sweat from his forehead and said.

And the rest of the men who were about to enter the passage separately heaved a sigh of relief.

Because for them, if Lin Xiu chose the wrong one, then there was one less wrong passage. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

“He died…”

When the other warriors on the Tianjiao list saw this scene, their faces turned slightly pale.

Although they wanted to let Lin Xiu go just now, they were a little scared when they saw that Lin Xiu died like this.

They were afraid that the same would happen to them.

Qian Jin looked at the first passage and still couldn’t believe that Lin Xiu just died like that.

But in that terrifying flame, even if a warrior unfolded a ‘Sphere’, that terrifying temperature would still melt the warrior, right?

At the same time, the rest of the people also entered into other passages one after another.

But in every passage, other terrifying things appeared, some were terrifying electric currents, some were magma, and so on.

Each one was different.

“All of them… is a road to disaster?”

Zhang Zhiheng frowned as he watched everyone in each passage die.

“Impossible…” Huangji also frowned at this time.

Logically speaking, there must be a way to survive these passages.

But the current situation was that all the passages were disastrous!

The surrounding warriors fell silent.

Many warriors already wanted to leave this place and go back to take the dazzling purple stone weapons. After all, there was absolutely no way to get through this place.

“I know!”

At this moment, Zhang Zhiheng’s expression changed suddenly, as if he suddenly realized.

“We were tricked by that damn boy!”

“God’s Punishment Guild, come over!”

Zhang Zhiheng shouted loudly, then walked directly to the first passage.

The surrounding warriors were still standing at the same spot and they didn’t understand what was going on. Zhang Zhiheng, is he not afraid of death?

The leader of the God’s Punishment Guild had already gone over directly, and the rest of their guild was not afraid as they followed Zhang Zhiheng to the first passage.

“It seems that they are still deceived.”

At the same time, Lin Xiu had already walked from this passage to the front.

The Analytic Eye was really useful. Lin Xiu easily found out that the first passage was the correct passage.

The old man Huangji wanted to kill Lin Xiu yet he probably didn’t expect that he was giving Lin Xiu an opportunity.

However, this passage was way too long. At this time, Lin Xiu kept walking forward, but he still didn’t seem to reach the end.

Whoosh whoosh

But at this moment, Lin Xiu, who has a good ear, vaguely seemed to hear the sound coming from this passage.

Without the slightest hesitation, Lin Xiu directly unfolded his ‘Sphere’!

om

Dang dangThe next moment, a large number of steel needles flew over from the front, all impacting Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’. The powerful impact made Lin Xiu’s footsteps retreat.

But the ‘Sphere’ still resisted these steel needles.

Continuing to walk forward, flames, frost, and various mechanisms appear in this passage from time to time.

Lin Xiu used the Analytic Eye throughout the whole process, and all the mechanisms of this passage were destroyed by Lin Xiu.

After some time, Lin Xiu finally saw a dazzling light in front.

Is it an exit?

Seeing the light ahead, Lin Xiu’s eyes lit up.

Those people should have come to their senses by now, and he should hurry up and get to the front first.

If there was really something good, he could grab it directly.

“It seems that we guessed right. This kid has long known that this is the right way.”

Son

Zhang Zhiheng was walking in the back at this time, looking at the destroyed organs on the ground, he said coldly. And Huangji and others quickly followed behind and entered the passage.

Now his face was so gloomy, he didn’t expect that Lin Xiu would trick him instead.

Qian Jin was a bit dumbfounded, but now he finally knew why Lin Xiu was so relaxed just

now.

But if Lin Xiu did this, wouldn’t he be afraid that these people would deal with him later?

“Hey, is this the main hall…”

After walking out of this passage, Lin Xiu suddenly saw the extremely glow inside the hall.

Gold coins, spar, and various skills were piled up like hills around.

Looking at this, Lin Xiu couldn’t help but be surprised.

This King warrior has a lot of wealth…

In the middle of the hall, there was a skeleton, and the skeleton was still wearing a crystal clear battle uniform.

Although it was just a skeleton, Lin Xiu felt the terrifying aura from this skeleton.

Even if it was dead, it still had such great power…

Lin Xiu didn’t look at the mountains around him, but walked over to the middle of the hall.

He didn’t know what this hall was made of, but it also looked crystal clear.

As soon as Lin Xiu walked up, he felt that there was an unusually strong energy gathering around him.

Stepping on this stone staircase made of unknown materials, Lin Xiu seemed to have thought of something.

“These… are they all made of odd crystals?”

Lin Xiu reached out and touched the stone ladder, and then he felt a powerful wave of power.

It really is! How did they do this?

Lin Xiu’s eyes were full of shock.

Absorb, quickly absorb!

Lin Xiu did not hesitate at all, and immediately started the ‘Cultivation Technique’.

A steady stream of source strength rushed towards Lin Xiu’s body frantically at this time, and soon, Lin Xiu’s body felt full of the majestic source strength!

To absorb all the energy of this palace, just this little time was simply not enough.

But now those people should have reacted and rushed to their side.

He couldn’t absorb the source strength like this any longer.

Although Lin Xiu felt a little sad, he still recovered from the state of cultivation.

He headed to the middle of the hall.

Looking at it up close, Lin Xiu was surprised to find that this skeleton sitting in the middle of the hall, was different from the bones of ordinary people, and it was turned into jade.

The battle uniform he was wearing was not ordinary, and he was holding a long sword on his hand bone.

Although there was dust on the long sword, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that the long sword was also a divine weapon.

“Is this the last treasure…”

Lin Xiu was a little disappointed, this long sword was not suitable for him, and Lin Xiu didn’t want his battle uniform.

Apart from this palace made of odd crystals and Lin Xiu wanted to absorb its power, there was nothing else to look at.

“You…are you my inheritor…”

But just at this moment, an old voice came from this skeleton!
