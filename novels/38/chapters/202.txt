Chapter 203: Return

The shriek was so loud that it jolted pain in Lin Xiu’s eardrums.

“Lin Xiu!!!” Right at this time, Lin Xiu heard a familiar voice that came from nearby.

He turned and looked at the building next to his and saw Zhang Yin and the others at a window on the middle floors.

They were waving at him.

“Why did you guys come here?” Lin Xiu asked.

‘Seems like they’re not injured.’

Pa-

Li Ping used his saber and broke the windows.

“We’re jumping across!”

Zhang Yin and Jiang Li saw that the buildings were not too far apart. They could perform the leap by relying on their warrior’s physique.

Lin Xiu immediately knew what they wanted to do and retreated.

Once he retreated, the trio ran and performed a jump across.

The three quickly arrived at Lin Xiu and Luo Yue’s building.

“Whew.” Zhang Yin and the others saw the street full of evolved beasts and their hearts palpitated.

After all, there were too many evolved beasts and zombies. If they fell accidentally, it would be to their deaths.

“We looked for you guys for so long, who would have thought that we would meet here.” Li Ping gasped and said.

“Lin Xiu, what do we do now? Are we returning?” Zhang Yin looked at the evolved beast in the distance and hesitated for a moment before asking Lin Xiu.

After all, the evolved beast was too terrifying and not something their current selves could fight against.

And they had to deal with the large numbers of evolved beasts if they wanted to fight against it.

“The other Sacred Region Academy students should have left.” Lin Xiu pondered for a moment and said.

In such a situation, it was best to leave as soon as possible. Otherwise, they would truly be in danger.

But his gaze turned to the Ice crystal white bird in the distance. If I could obtain the odd crystal…

“You guys go back first, he and I will stay here.” Luo Yue looked at Zhang Yin and the others and said.

Lin Xiu was startled, he was about to speak up when she continued, “That odd crystal is beneficial for you. Think of a way to snatch it.”

The odd crystal of the Ice crystal white bird had ice properties. If he absorbed the energy inside, it would mediate the Red Lotus Fire in his body.

It would be extremely beneficial for Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu knew that, but it was too terrifying, how could they deal with it?

“We will be the fishermen to snatch everything once they finish fighting over it.” Luo Yue glanced at him and said indifferently.

‘To go, or not to go?’

Lin Xiu thought about it and clenched his teeth. Riches lie in the depths of danger, to hell with it!

‘And she’s not afraid, I can’t let her look down on me, right?’

“I just saw there were rank 7 warriors here…” Zhang Yin could not help but advise when he heard their conversation.

And there was more than one rank 7 warrior. It would not be easy to be a fisherman.

A few warriors with ill intent might even attack them if they stayed around. At that time, it would become even more troublesome.

“En.” Lin Xiu nodded his head and turned to them, “You guys head back first, it’s more dangerous there.”

He was speaking the truth.

Zhang Yin and the others were still at rank 3. If they followed along, they would not be able to help and even risk their own lives.

“Alright.” Zhang Yin and the others hesitated for a moment but nodded in agreement.

They were aware as well and decided to retreat.

“We will return to the edge of G17 ruin. Come and find us when you guys return.’ Zhang Yin thought for a bit and said.

It was not the end of the time limit yet and there were lesser evolved beasts and zombies at the edge for them to train.

“Alright!”

While returning back, Lin Xiu and the others killed many more evolved beasts and zombies.

It might be difficult for Zhang Yin and the others, but it was extremely enjoyable for Lin Xiu.

Experience points!

Experience points all the way!

Lin Xiu felt extremely excited when he saw the experience points bar growing endlessly.

And whenever he killed evolved beasts, Rollie would grab their odd crystals and gather them up.

There were too many of the monsters but they finally killed their way out.

“You guys are back?” In the city at the edge of G17 ruin, they saw countless Sacred Region Academy students.

There were students from the north and south campuses, almost the majority of students had returned.

After all, it was too dangerous inside.

“En.” Seeing the people from the south campus’ Class 8 greeting them, Lin Xiu nodded.

“So you guys didn’t die.” The people from north campus Class 2 were around as well and looked at Lin Xiu unkindly.

They wanted to snatch the Red Lotus Fire but failed to do so and even lost a member of the creature.

The class monitor of the north campus’ Class 2, Sha Qiu, looked at Lin Xiu with killing intent in his eyes.

“Of course we’re fine, but a pity your teammate died.” Lin Xiu glanced at him and replied indifferently.

“Seeking death!!!” Sha Qiu’s expression changed.

He did not know how Lin Xiu’s team had escaped from the attack of the horrifying dimensional creature.

But his eyes were filled with murderous intent as he stared at Lin Xiu.

The students of the north campus’ Class 2 surrounded Lin Xiu.

The other students of Sacred Region Academy started laughing.

They all watched Lin Xiu with interest. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

Students of the north campus’ Class 2 were strong, how could someone from the south campus’ Class 10 compare!?

Only a few were aware of the two freshmen from south campus Class 10 that were on the Tower of Tournament’s freshmen ranking board.

One was rank 1, the other was rank 4.

“Everyone’s from Sacred Region Academy, we can talk about it.” A bright youth walked over and smiled at everyone.

“Deng Wuji, this is none of your business, you better not bother.” Sha Qiu snorted when he saw the guy walk over.

He then turned back to Lin Qiu and spoke with a sinister face, “Brat, where did you place that ball of fire energy?”
