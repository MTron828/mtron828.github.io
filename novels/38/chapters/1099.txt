Chapter 1100: It’s My Turn Next

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

When Elder Bai saw what happened, his eyes widened in shock.

“Hmph!”

He sneered and tried to push the sword deeper into Lin Xiu’s shoulder.

However, Lin Xiu’s body was too tough.

The sword that he had was unable to pierce through Lin Xiu’s body!

!!

“Did you think that you’ll be able to hurt me like this?”

Lin Xiu stared at Elder Bai while asking him the question.

Elder Bai’s face turned pale when he heard what Lin Xiu said.

Crackling – –

Suddenly, with his mind controlling it, there were large, horrifying lightning bolts that appeared on the sword.

Then, he pierced Lin Xiu’s body once again with his sword.

This time, there were large amounts of lightning bolts that travelled around Lin Xiu’s body.

Elder Bao let out a cold smile but soon, the smile on his face froze.

This was because they could see that even when Lin Xiu’s body was completely wrapped with the lightning bolt, his body was not injured at all!

How was this possible?! How could he have such a tough body?!

These lightning bolts had no effect on Lin Xiu.

Lin Xiu was still struggling to set himself free from the energy ropes.

Damn it!

Lin Xiu cursed under his breath.

At this point, there was only one skill left for him to try.

“Give me the Imperial order!!!!!!”

Elder Bai was in rage. He held onto the sword with both hands and was trying to thrust it into Lin Xiu’s body.

The Imperial Order was still in Lin Xiu’s hands earlier but how did it suddenly disappear?!

This brat must have done some special technique to hide it.

Lin Xiu didn’t care what Elder Bai was doing.

His body has been through a lot of tough training and with the regeneration from before, Lin Xiu’s body strength was already at a very high level.

It wouldn’t be that easy to pierce the sword through Lin Xiu’s body.

“Leave him alone!!!”

Ye Kai was screaming at Elder Bai when he saw what was happening.

But, he didn’t have the strength to stop him.

Plus, at this point, the four sage warriors standing at each corner were gathering their energies as well. Then, all of the energy left their bodies and headed toward Lin Xiu!

The sage warriors had a different look in their eyes when they saw what was happening.

But, they were now using a combined source mark and none of them were allowed to move.

‘Source Strength Control’!

The cooling time for this skill was about one month long.

But, when Lin Xiu got the ‘Gods Blessings’ from earlier when he got to a new level, the cooling time for it got reset.

This was why Lin Xiu was able to use it now.

Just as Lin Xiu had assumed, the energy ropes around him were formed by source energy.

By using the ‘Source Strength Control’, Lin Xiu could clearly feel that he was in control of all the source energy around him.

This included the source energy from these ropes, the energy from the four warriors as well as …..any living things around him including plants and animals who have source energy.

“Go to hell!!!!”

Elder Bai was still unable to thrust the sword through Lin Xiu’s body and he was getting even angrier.

But, he did not realise that all of the ropes that were formed by the source energy were slowly disappearing.

All of them were slowly turning into source energy and it was getting absorbed by Lin Xiu.

“Is that enough?”

Elder Bai was still putting his best effort into trying to pierce Lin Xiu with his sword.

That’s when he suddenly heard Lin Xiu’s voice.

Then, there was a hand that grabbed onto his sword.

Elder Bai’s pupil shrunk when he saw what happened.

He finally looked up and realised that all of the ropes that were entangled around Lin Xiu’s body had completely disappeared!

“You…”

As he looked around, he could clearly see that the energy coming from all four of the warriors at each corner were slowly getting weaker.

It looked as if the energy in their body was being absorbed by something else.

Clang – –

At the same time, there was a crisp sound that ran through the room. Elder Bai then realised that the sword that he was holding onto had been broken into two!

He looked at it carefully and noticed that it was Lin Xiu who broke it with his hands.

At the same time, all of the energy ropes around Lin Xiu’s body have completely disappeared.

Elder Bai had a drastic change of expression. Just as he wanted to escape, Lin Xiu had already swung a huge punch onto his body!

There was also a bright light that appeared around the fist.

‘Explosive Strike’!

Boom – –

As the punch landed on Elder Bai’s body, there was a loud explosion that followed.

Then, his body was like a kite that got cut off from its string; uncontrollably flying across the room.

In the end, he landed heavily on one of the huge rocks.

Pfft – – Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

There was bright-red blood that came out of his mouth.

Elder Bai’s eyes were opened wide and he could feel that all of his ribs had broken.

The intense pain that he was feeling at this moment prevented him from moving.

“Kill…..him…”

Elder Bai spoke with great difficulty.

All four of the warriors in each corners turned and looked at Lin Xiu.

Everything that had happened was getting more and more peculiar and it felt as if all the energy in their body was getting absorbed by Lin Xiu.

When they took a good look at Lin Xiu’s body, it looked as if his entire body was filled with a bright, white light due to the large energy absorbed. It was looking incredibly odd.

As for the plants around it, all of those who had energy in them were getting absorbed by Lin Xiu.

All of the plants wilted.

The warriors quickly released their ‘sphere’s before attacking Lin Xiu!

Xiu xiu xiu – –

Although most of the energy in their body has been absorbed by Lin Xiu, they still have quite a large reserve in them.

Lin Xiu sneered when he looked at them.

The long spear that was on the ground soon returned to Lin Xiu’s hands.

As soon as he held onto the long spear, Lin Xiu swung it in the air around him.

The sage warriors, who held onto their weapons about to attack Lin Xiu, were pushed far away by one simple attack from Lin Xiu’s spear. It sent them flying in the air!

Boom boom boom – –

Then, their bodies immediately fell onto the ground.

There was also fresh blood that came out from the corners of their mouth.

“Well, it’s my turn next.”

Lin Xiu sneered and he gripped onto his long spear with his body that was full of energy.

All of the energy in his body was transferred onto his long spear!

This horrifying energy caused all of the sage warriors who were on the ground to feel frightened as their pupils shrunk.
