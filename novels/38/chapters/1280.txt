1281 Collecting Protection Fees?

“You guys don’t want anything else?”

Arriving at the payment area on the first floor, Lin Xiu couldn’t help saying aloud after watching Baili Haoling and Lei Tong just choose a set of battle suits.

Although the payment method in the God warrior Realm was energy stones, Lin Xiu really has no shortage of energy stones.

Not to mention that he had an ore vein in Lingxian City, he didn’t even know how much he raked in Shachang City and Changqing City.

“No need.”

Both Lei Tong and Baili Haoling shook their heads.

As far as weapons are concerned, there was no need to change them and the skill cards didn’t seem suitable for Baili Haoling.

There were plenty of skills that were quite suitable for him, but he was not strong enough now. Good weapons were extremely heavy and good skill cards were useless if he was not of a certain strength.

“Then I’ll settle the bill. How much is it?”

Lin Xiu walked directly to the cashier and said.

“A total of 153 million.”

The cashier said with a smile after looking at it.

“so much?”

Lei Tong was surprised when he heard the cashier’s words.

“not much.”

Baili Haoling shook her head.

Generally speaking, this represents the number of ordinary power stones.

But among the energy stones, there were also high-level energy stones or super energy stones.

A high-level energy stone was equivalent to one hundred ordinary energy stones, while the super energy stone was equivalent to ten thousand ordinary energy stones.

And the White Moon spear that Lin Xiu bought, Baili Haoling also looked at it and it was indeed not an ordinary weapon.

If it wasn’t too heavy, it would have been bought long ago.

“Cards from major banks can be swiped and online payments can also be made…”

The cashier said aloud at this moment.

“Uh… I can pass you the energy stones itself, right?”

At this time, Lin Xiu said a little embarrassedly.

Energy stones were difficult to carry. Generally speaking, energy stones were deposited in major banks, then paid by credit card.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words at this time, the cashier was startled, as if she was deceived.

More than 100 million energy stones, who can take out so many energy stones directly?

This is simply a joke…

Some staff almost thought that Lin Xiu had come to make trouble. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“These should be enough.”

Lin Xiu triggered his mind and his right hand waved, then a large number of energy stones appeared on the ground in front of him.

Looking at the super energy stones all over the floor, the cashier was instantly dumbfounded.

Looking at the quality of these energy stones, they were all super energy stones!

Counting carefully, there were more than ten thousand!

“Let’s calculate now.”

The surrounding staff couldn’t help but gasped when they saw this scene.

This person carried so many super energy stones with him?

But… how could he carry so many ah!

Lei Tong and Baili Haoling were no strangers to it.

Lin Xiu stored some items before, but they just didn’t know where.

Now they all think that Lin Xiu has a special space storage device.

Soon, with those staff counting, there were enough energy stones.

And some were even returned to Lin Xiu.

“Let’s go.”

After shopping, it was already late at night.

At this time, although the streets still had a lot of light like daytime, the number of warriors on the road was obviously much less.

It looked a little deserted.

Plop, plop——

At this moment, the three of them were walking on the street when they heard strange noises.

“Who is it?”

Lin Xiu also stopped at this moment and said immediately.

At this time, Baili Haoling put both hands on the long sword on her waist and Lei Tong also looked around warily.

Just now, they also clearly heard the sounds coming from around them.

...

And he also felt the feeling of being watched.

This feeling was very uncomfortable.

“Jie Jie—”

At this moment, strange laughter came from not far behind.

This laughter sounded very weird, making one’s scalp tingle.

Lin Xiu turned around and looked back and he could clearly see two black figures walking out from behind a big tree.

The two were wearing black cloaks, with strange expressions on their faces.

Their eyes stared at Lin Xiu and the others, making Lin Xiu and the others feel very uncomfortable.

“First time you’ve come to the City of God huh.”

One of the warriors, who looked taller, stared at Lin Xiu and the others and said.

“I saw it just now. You guys bought a lot of things.”

...

Another warrior also showed a sinister smile at this time.

“Come to rob?”

Seeing this scene, Baili Haoling said subconsciously.

Lin Xiu also found it a little funny. This city of gods is a city with god kings. In this city, people want to rob in broad daylight?

It’s just funny.

“Borrow.”

“We want to borrow some energy stones.”

The taller black-clothed warrior said with a smile.

This smile is a bit weird and makes people feel uncomfortable.

“Don’t worry, my name is Xiao Ren and he is my brother Xiao Jian. We are all well-known in this area. If you lend it to us, we will return it to you.”

The tall warrior continued to laugh and said.

Baili Haoling looked at these two people as if she was looking at two mentally handicapped people.

Borrow energy stone? This is simply funny.

“And I know that you guys are being watched.”

Xiao Ren said suddenly at this moment.

Being watched?

Hearing his words, the expressions of Lin Xiu and the others changed slightly.

Because when they were at the Warrior Hotel, they were obviously impacted by a strange force.

And Baili Haoling and Lei Tong felt that someone was knocking on the door.

“I’m telling you, warriors like you come to the city of God and you won’t even know how you die.”

At this time, Xiao Jian also spoke in a negative way.

“If you lend us hundreds of millions of energy stones, we can protect you for a while.”

“A protection fee?”

Lin Xiu was really happy now.

Unexpectedly, in this city of God, someone came to collect protection money.

And they were still two teasers who were mentally retarded.

“No, no, this is a loan. We can write an IOU.”

Xiao Ren said with a very serious face.

“That’s right! We brothers will never renege on debts.”

Xiao Jian also echoed.

“Stop talking nonsense, get the hell out of here.”

Baili Haoling said impatiently at this time.

“Brother! She actually told us to get out!”

Xiao Jian’s eyes widened at this time and he pointed at Baili Haoling and said, looking extremely excited.

“Hmph! If that’s the case, don’t blame us for being rude!”

Xiao Ren snorted coldly, the two looked at each other and rushed towards Lin Xiu and the others!

Although these two people look a bit alike, it is undeniable that at this time, the speed displayed by these two people is breakneck!
