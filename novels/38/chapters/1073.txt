Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

Boom—

A loud noise sounded at this moment.

The phantom shadow of that huge sword instantly hit Lin Xiu’s side.

But Lin Xiu reacted quickly and unfolded his ‘Sphere’.

Even so, the powerful impact still caused Lin Xiu’s legs to sink into the ice and snow. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

!!

Damn it!

Seeing Lin Xiu react so quickly and unfold his ‘Sphere’, he couldn’t help but cursed in his heart.

But at this time, he still reacted quickly and slashed with the sword in his hand!

boom boom boom —

As his sword slashed over, huge blade-shaped phantoms appeared one after another, slashing on Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’ and there were loud noises.

Lin Xiu’s expression remained the same and he continued to maintain his “Sphere”.

Step by step, he walked towards Lin Xiu.

Zhou Ba saw this scene, his eyes widened, his eyes filled with disbelief.

How is it possible, even if there is a ‘Sphere’ protecting him, this is impossible.

His own skills had no impact on Lin Xiu at all!

“That’s all you’ve got?”

Lin Xiu looked at him and said lightly.

At this time, as the source strength was transferred to the Dark Edge spear in his hand, the entire spear suddenly changed from the original dark state to like crystal glass.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s mocking words, the faces around him became even uglier.

At this time, with both hands firmly holding the sword in his hand, he just attacked Lin Xiu.

“Break!!!”

He growled loudly.

But there was still no way for his sword to break through Lin Xiu’s ‘Sphere’.

At this time, Lin Xiu had already rushed in front of him as soon as he moved.

Holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he directly attacked him.

Zhou Ba watched Lin Xiu stab with the spear in his hand, the pupils in his eyes shrank immediately and he subconsciously held the sword in his hand to resist it.

Dang dang-

As the spear collided with his sword, there was a loud noise after another.

Zhou Ba’s body was constantly retreating because of the incomparably powerful impact.

When the surrounding warriors saw this situation, they were surprised.

The strength that Lin Xiu showed was truly astonishing.

Zhou Ba seems to have no power to fight back now and has been retreating continuously.

“go!”

And in the next moment, with the strong swing of the Dark Edge spear in Lin Xiu’s hands, Zhou Ba, who was still trying to resist Lin Xiu’s attack, was sent flying away.

And at the same time that he flew out, one after another flaming birds continued to burst out of the spear.

They charged towards Zhou Ba.

Originally, the surroundings were extremely cold, but at this time, the surrounding environment seemed to be scorching hot.

The frost on the ground also melted instantly.

what is this!?

When Zhou Ba saw this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank suddenly.

His body began dodging.

boom boom boom —

The flaming birds hit the ground, making a loud noise after another.

There were too many flaming birds and in the next moment, they directly hit Zhou Ba’s body.

Although Zhou Ba reacted quickly and unfolded the ‘Sphere’, the scorching temperature that the flames generated caused Zhou Ba’s expression to change greatly.

The burning sensation instantly caused a lot of sweat to come out of his body.

What made him feel even more terrifying was that his ‘Sphere’ seemed to be slowly melting away at this time!

swoosh—

And at this moment, Lin Xiu’s body leaped up, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, attacking from the sky.

And at this time, Lin Xiu’s body had a lot of source strength bursting out.

Transformed into the shape of a huge tiger.

[Tiger descends the mountain]!!!

Roar–

The gigantic tiger, as if roaring with its mouth open, charged towards Zhou Ba below!

“Get lost!!!”

At this time, Zhou Ba was tortured enough by the high temperature of the flame.

As soon as the flame brought by the flaming bird disappeared, he looked up and saw Lin Xiu who was rushing down from the air.

On Lin Xiu’s body, there is a giant tiger formed by the gathering of source strength.

He rushed down directly towards him!

At the same time as Zhou Ba was roaring loudly at this time, the source strength of his whole body gathered together, his hands clenched the sword and he was about to slash at the tiger!

As he slashed hard with both hands, a terrifying sword aura burst out.

He slashed directly at Lin Xiu, who had come down!

“Humph!”

Lin Xiu snorted coldly, not dodging at all.

Zhou Ba’s sword aura impacted Lin Xiu’s body and did not cause any damage to Lin Xiu at all!

Just when Zhou Ba opened his eyes wide with an unbelievable look in his eyes, Lin Xiu had already pounced down like a fierce tiger!

Boom—

As a dazzling light burst out, a huge sound suddenly erupted from the surrounding ground.

There seem to be more cracks in the ice within a radius of ten miles.

Those warriors who watched this battle were all shocked at this time.

They never thought that Lin Xiu would have such terrifying strength.

As the light dissipated, Zhou Ba’s body fell to the ground and a large number of cracks appeared in the surrounding ground.

Lin Xiu stood on the ground and pointed a spear at Zhou Ba’s forehead.

At this time, Zhou Ba had a lot of blood on his body and he was in a very bad state.

“Da… damn…”

He opened his eyes wide, looked at Lin Xiu and spat out a mouthful of blood.

He never imagined that Lin Xiu’s strength would be so powerful.

“I’ve told you, you’re very weak.”

Lin Xiu looked at Zhou Ba who was lying on the ground and said lightly.

In the next moment, he will take the Dark Edge spear in his hand and stab at his body!

“Stop!”

But at this moment, a voice came over.

He looked back and saw a few Sage warriors approaching from behind.

“Young man, isn’t this a little too much?”

One of the Sage warriors looked at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

“It’s just sparring, do you have to kill.”

Another warrior also said aloud.

“What a joke, when he wanted to kill me, why didn’t you stand up for me?”

Lin Xiu didn’t give them any face at all and said coldly at this time.

Hearing Lin Xiu’s words, their brows were all wrinkled.

“I want you, let him go.”

The leading Sage warrior, stared at Lin Xiu and he didn’t sound like he was going to allow refusal.

“Do you think it’s possible?”

Lin Xiu sneered.

“Are you sure you want to fight against me?”

That Sage warrior stared at Lin Xiu and said coldly.

There was already killing intent in his eyes.

Lin Xiu showed a sneer and at the next moment, holding the Dark Edge spear in his hand, he stabbed directly at Zhou Ba who was lying on the ground!
