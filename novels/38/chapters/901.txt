Chapter 902: Expansion Space

A bright light flashed before his eyes and the boots fell onto the ground.

Well, Lin Xiu was still a little disgusted by the name of the boots.

“Meteorite Boots: Speed +100. Additional Skills: Pegasus Meteorite.”

“Pegasus Meteorite: Able to use extreme speed for 10 seconds. Cooling time: seven days.”

This looked interesting.

Lin Xiu thought about it for a moment before putting on the boots.

There was also a huge bottle of potential pills, about 2 hundred of them.

With all of them together, there would be 2 hundred potential points.

“Concentrate pills….would increase the speed of healing.”

These pills seemed to be more useful than the ones before.

However, he didn’t know how much these pills would actually help with the healing.

He swallowed all 200 potential pills and Lin Xiu felt a warm feeling coming from his chest.

Potential Points:200

Lin Xiu took a good look at his stats. He was already at level 61 now and his stats were now much stronger than before.

His physique and strength were almost on the same level which pleased Lin Xiu.

Without much thought, Lin Xiu added his potential points onto his strength.

Then, Lin Xiu immediately felt his own body entirely filled with strength

Oh, the main prize!

Lin Xiu almost forgot about it.

As he returned to his system, there was a large treasure chest that was shaking vigorously.

He selected the treasure chest and it slowly opened up.

“Ding! Congratulations Master on getting ‘Expansion Space’!”

Expansion space? What on earth?

Lin Xiu was utterly confused with the prize that he got.

When he took a closer look, he saw that there was a button on the top left corner of the interface and saw that it was a picture of a treasure chest.

What’s that?

Lin Xiu clicked onto it and he was brought into another interface.

This space was huge.

“Current space: 60 cubic metres.”

What was this space for?

Can he actually put things into this space?

Lin Xiu wondered about it. He quickly left the system and took out his black spear.

He was holding onto his black spear and developed the thought of having the back spear placed into space. Suddenly, the black spear that was in his hand disappeared!

Damn!

Lin Xiu was shocked after seeing what had happened.

When he went back into the system, Lin Xiu noticed that his black spear was sitting inside that empty space!

How do I take it out then?

With that thought, the black spear once again appeared in Lin Xiu’s hands!

“Oh!!!! This is an inventory space!”

Lin Xiu couldn’t help but laugh.

For him, this was definitely the best prize.

With this space expansion, he would be able to carry everything with him and he no longer have to carry his long spear!

Lin Xiu got excited as he thought about how useful the space would be.

He looked at the warrior skills card in his hands and wanted to place them into the space.

However, Lin Xiu thought about something else.

The Synthesis System!

Long ago, Lin Xiu had already discovered the Synthesis System.

He tried it a few times but he never got any good warrior skills cards from it.

He had so many of them now and it wouldn’t be helpful for him.

Why not just try it out then?

As he thought about it, Lin Xiu entered into the Synthesis System.

“In order to make a purple gold card, you need 5 diamond rank warrior skills cards. The chances of success would only be 25%.”

As he read the introduction to the system, Lin Xiu frowned.

There was only half the chance of success and it needed 5 diamond rank warrior skills cards.

He thought about it for a minute and placed 5 of them into the system.

Then, he clicked onto the ‘start’ button.

Koong Loong – –

Soon, all the five cards gathered together and they were glowing brightly.

Does this mean that it worked?!

Lin Xiu held his breath.

“Synthesis Failed!”

Then, 2 bold words appeared before his eyes.

“F**k!”

When he saw the results, Lin Xiu cursed.

There was still an exclamation mark after the two words.

Lin Xiu immediately experienced how evil the system could be.

“Again!”

Lin Xiu didn’t want to believe his luck. He took out another five diamond skills cards and started the synthesis process.

Soon, the same process happened again.

It was the exact same situation that happened before. The bright light appeared and two words appeared before him.

“Synthesis Failed!”

“You played me!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Lin Xiu glared at the system.

He had a headache after failing twice in the synthesis system.

There was a 25% chance of success and that was considered high.

Such bad luck...

Plus, only the warrior skills cards given by the system that can be used for the synthesis system.

Otherwise, Lin Xiu could have played with the synthesis system with all the other cards that he had.

“Last five.”

Lin Xiu looked at the five remaining diamond rank warrior skills cards that he had in his hands and continued the synthesis system.

He placed them onto the system and the five of them gathered together like before. Then, the bright light appeared once again.

Crap!

When he saw how everything was repeating itself, Lin Xiu thought that it would fail once again.

However, the next moment, 2 other words appeared – ‘Synthesis Success’!

“It worked?!”

Lin Xiu took a good look at it and saw a purple gold warrior skills card.

“Wind God’s Hell.”

This was a warrior skill of the wind element which meant that it could be used by any weapon.

“This seems fun.”

Lin Xiu mumbled to himself as he looked at the warrior skills card.

He did not waste his time. Lin Xiu sat on the ground and placed the card on top of his head.

Then, with his consciousness controlling it, a bright golden light appeared from the card.

Soon, there was a large amount of messages that entered Lin Xiu’s mind!
