1366 The Strength of the Netherworld Flames!

“He’s dead?”

The bald man stared at the Saint Warrior that was lying on the ground. He couldn’t help but furrow his brows.

Huuuuu —

Lin Xui slowly released another deep breath as well.

!!

Due to how he has used ‘Soul Eater’ from before, he may not have moved much but it had exhausted most of his energy.

Although ‘Soul Eater’ could kill others instantly, the energy used in exchange was incredibly high.

It wouldn’t be that easy for him to kill warriors that were stronger than this man.

“Boss! Let’s just kill that kid! Useless City Lord!”

The other warriors got infuriated.

Although they had no idea how Lin Xiu killed their comrades, they didn’t care much about it anymore.

“Kill him.”

The bald man had a murderous intention in his eyes as he gave his commands.

With that said, all ten saint warriors started attacking Lin Xiu!

The rest of the warrior gods decided to step aside and watch the battle.

Seeing how the warriors were coming at him from different directions, Lin Xiu sneered. He gathered all of his energy onto his fist.

As soon as they got close, Lin Xiu moved.

‘Sonic Star’!!!

Boom boom boom – –

At that instant, Lin Xiu had released a thousand punches in the air.

All of the warriors that attacked him were thrown into the distance!

Each of them landed on the ground with a loud thud.

There were deep dents that appeared on their chests and heads.

Some even had their heads blasted off.

“Tsk…. only 0.1% of progress.”

After killing about a dozen of saint warriors, Lin Xiu shook his head.

They were giving him so less EXP that it seemed difficult for him to break through to another level.

The bald man was shocked as well.

All of his saint warriors were dead?

“That guy is a warrior god.”

He quickly warned the rest of his men.

The rest of the god warriors, who were prepared to fight, had a solemn look on their faces.

They were all 2-3 metres tall and looked muscular.

To them, Lin Xiu was a midget.

But, it was this midget that killed the saint warriors with one punch!

Even if they were warrior gods, they wouldn;t be able to do it.

“Two years ago, I attacked another city and also met someone as powerful as you but it was unfortunate that in the end, he died in my arms.” The bald man mocked Lin Xiu.

He may look careful but he wasn’t afraid.

He has met many powerful warriors but he has always been victorious.

Plus, this man was only a city lord of a small city. Even if he might be powerful, how powerful could he be?!

“Well, those that you’ve met were weak.”

Lin Xiu gave a simple reply.

“Kill him.”

The bald man ignored Lin Xiu and signalled his men.

The warrior gods that headed straight for Lin Xiu!

Boom – –

Just as they were about to get close to Lin Xiu, there was a loud explosion. Lin Xiu had just released a dark blue flame from all over his body!

The warriors were attacked by the flames and were instantly thrown far into the distance!

The flame covered entirely over their bodies.

“Ahhhhhhh!!!!”

Cries of sorrow and pain filled the air.

Some of the warrior gods started rolling on the ground like mad but it was useless.

They were suffering from intense pain. As they screamed, they tried to tear off the clothes from their body.

They even tore their flesh off their bodies.

Soon, all of them were dead and it was deadly quiet.

...

The bald man and the remaining warrior gods were shocked.

All of their eyes were filled with disbelief!

How is that even possible?!

Everything happened within a blink of an eye. There wasn’t even a fight but all four warriors died!

That flame! What was that?! How could it be so terrifying?!

“Netherworld Flame! Could it be the Netherworld Flame?!” Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

One of the warrior gods suddenly noticed the blue flames released and his body started trembling.

The Netherworld Flame was something incredibly scary and famous as well.

“That is impossible!”

The bald man roared in rage.

That was an incredibly powerful flame. Forget about cultivating it. Just by touching the flame itself would have killed them!

...

“Hmm….I’m still not used to not having a spear.”

Lin Xiu looked at his fist and then threw a punch at the bald man who was in the air!

‘True Fire Fist’!

As his punch headed into the air, the entire fist turned into a huge fireball that went straight for the bald man.

The bald man’s pupil shrunk uncontrollably and he blocked the fireball with his machete.

Boom – –

However, the fire fist was incredibly powerful and his entire body was thrown into the far distance.

He landed heavily onto the energy barrier and spat out a mouthful of blood.

“Get him!!!”

He ignored the blood coming out of his mouth and roared.

“It looks like….the City Lord is back?!”

Lei Chong looked far into the distance and his eyes were opened wide.

He was only muttering it to himself but he didn’t think that Lin Xiu would be back!

“Let’s go!”

Baili Haoling also noticed Lin Xiu who had returned and quickly rushed forward!

Lei Chong ran behind Baili Haoling.

At the same time, Rollie was sitting on Little Bai and Little Bai flew over to where Lin Xiu was at.

“Do it together then.”

Lin Xiu looked at the warriors around him and scoffed. Suddenly, his entire body was covered with Netherworld Flame!

These flames did not affect Lin Xiu but all of the warriors around him could feel the drop in the temperature.

But, as they got close, they could feel the temperature rising.

It was indeed something weird.

“Don’t come any closer!”

Those who wanted to attack Lin Xiu up close suddenly saw the blue flames that came from Lin Xiu’s body and instantly backed up.

With the examples shown before, they didn’t want to be in contact with these flames.

“Well, it’s a pity that I don’t have Dark Edge with me…”

If he had his spear with him, he could have killed all these warrior gods.

He had no other choice now. Lin Xiu started moving his fist and was starting to attack the warriors gods with his ‘True Fire Fist’!
