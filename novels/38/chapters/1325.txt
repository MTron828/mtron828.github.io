1326 Black Level, Black Panther!

“Small tricks!”

Seeing Lin Xiu’s attack, Yuan Zhen also became angry.

With a roar, the incomparably large amount of source strength in his body burst out directly.

Then it was passed to the double hammers!

!!

Boom——

At this moment, the war hammers made a violent sound.

The entire Warhammers actually emitted a purple light.

‘Flury Hammer Technique’!!!

At this moment, Yuan Zhen let out a roar in his heart, and holding the war hammers that were bursting with purple light in both hands, he rushed over directly!

He didn’t dodge Lin Xiu’s blow at all.

“die!”

Lin Xiu looked at this scene and roared angrily.

The dark attribute energy ball on the neck also burst out with power.

Coupled with the dark energy that Lin Xiu had absorbed before, the black dragon became even bigger.

With all its teeth and claws, it attacked Yuan Zhen who was rushing over!

But Yuan Zhen didn’t have any fear at all. He directly held the war hammers in his hands and crazily attacked the black dragon that charged over first!

The warhammers hit the black dragon’s body and instantly the black energy was dissipated by them.

But the dark matter scattered by the hammers quickly gathered together again.

When Yuan Zhen noticed this scene, the pupils in his eyes shrank involuntarily.

He obviously underestimated the power of these dark energies.

Soon, those dark energies won’t dissipate because of his attack.

And at this time, the black dragon had already opened its mouth and bit his body!

Biting his body directly, he crashed to the ground!

Boom——

With a loud sound, his body hit the battle platform so hard that it was dented.

Poof——

Blood spit out directly from his mouth.

“What a powerful force…”

The middle-aged man also opened his eyes wide at this time.

The black dragon bit Yuan Zhen and slammed into the ground, even the ground was sunken by the impact.

This power and healing are really terrifying. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

And what’s even more frightening is that Yuan Zhen’s body was not directly smashed into pieces.

“Damn it!!!”

Yuan Zhen, who was hit to the ground and only bitten by the black dragon, let out a roar.

But no matter how hard he struggled, he couldn’t break free at this moment.

And at this time, Lin Xiu had already stabbed over with the White Moon spear in his hand!

The tip of White Moon’s spear burst out with purple light.

This shot will directly hit his forehead!

Seeing this scene, Yuan Zhen’s pupils shrank slightly.

And he clearly felt that under the shackles of the black dragon, his body couldn’t mobilize the source strength to unfold the ‘Sphere’!!!

At this moment, his face became extremely cold.

Roar–

Just as Lin Xiu’s spear was about to stab him, a loud roar came out immediately.

Lin Xiu could clearly see the black shadow of a huge creature appearing in his eyes!

boom–

Lin Xiu, who stabbed over with a long spear, clearly felt an extremely powerful force attacking him.

At this moment, the whole person was directly thrown out by the collision!

He fell heavily on the ground not far away.

“Hoo hoo..”.

The black dragon that restrained Yuan Zhen was also shaken away at this moment!

Yuan Zhen got up and was out of breath for a while.

Taking a closer look at this moment, you can clearly see a huge black creature on Yuan Zhen’s body.

It looks like a black cheetah.

“This is Yuan Zhen’s Divine soul!?”

...

Wan Gan on the other side of the rostrum opened his eyes wide.

And this soul seems to be… of the black level!

“The soul of the black level is interesting.”

Noble God Riyan saw this scene and immediately became interested.

This black-level soul was a very rare existence.

And Yuan Zhen’s black-level soul was like a panther, it seemed quite strong.

At this moment, he looked toward Lin Xiu.

Will he show even more surprising strength?

“Hmph, you actually forced me to use the power of the black panther divine soul, not bad.”

Yuan Zhen looked at Lin Xiu who was directly sent flying out because of the appearance of the black panther spirit and said coldly.

At this time, with the appearance of his black panther divine soul, the muscles of his body swelled up.

...

Not just his muscles, but his height has increased too.

The whole body is full of strength!

“It’s interesting, black-level soul…”

Lin Xiu also slowly got up at this time, there was no trace of fear in his eyes.

At this time, following Lin Xiu’s thoughts, some black matter slowly surged out of Lin Xiu’s body.

Hm?

Looking at this scene, Yuan Zhen obviously felt that something was wrong and his brows frowned slightly.

Because he could clearly feel that the black matter gushing out of Lin Xiu’s body does not seem like dark energy.

On the contrary, it looks like the divine soul power!

No, it’s impossible, how could this guy also have a black-level soul!

You must know that it is very difficult for ordinary warriors to comprehend the power of the divine soul.

Stronger warriors, although possessing divine souls, are all of ordinary quality. It’s rare to see red-level ones, let alone black-level ones!

But at this moment, the dark matter emerging from Lin Xiu’s body directly gathered into a little black dragon!

Yuan Zhen’s eyes widened instantly.

“Black… black-level divine soul!?”

The middle-aged man on the seat to the left of Baili Haoling also stood up directly at this time.

His body trembled slightly.

Is the black-level soul so worthless now?

In this battle, there were actually two people with black-level divine soul!

“Hehe, you’re really inexperienced.”

Baili Haoling looked at this scene and said proudly.

This old guy always thought that Lin Xiu would lose just now and it made her very upset.

“It seems that I underestimated the strength of your city lord.”

“Seems like the chances of your city lord winning are not small.”

At this moment, after the middle-aged man came back to his senses, he smiled wryly.

He already regretted that he bet on Yuan Zhen to win.

If he’d bet on Lin Xiu, maybe…

“You actually have a black-level divine soul.”

Yuan Zhen looked at Lin Xiu on the opposite side and the little black dragon hovering beside Lin Xiu and said in a deep voice.

With this, he can’t guarantee that he will win.

“You’re not worse off yourself.”

Lin Xiu narrowed his eyes slightly.

Now he can clearly feel that Yuan Zhen’s soul has brought him a strong sense of oppression.

This Yuan Zhen’s soul power is no weaker than that of the little black dragon.

The little black dragon is like a growable soul. Although it is stronger than before, it is still not enough.

“Hu.”

Lin Xiu took a deep breath, and without the slightest hesitation at this time, he directly activated ‘Fury’!!!

As soon as the skill ‘Fury’ was used, Lin Xiu’s entire body exploded with a powerful aura!!!
