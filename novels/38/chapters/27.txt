Chapter 28: Rupturing Fist

Translator: Dragon Boat Translation Editor: Dragon Boat Translation

As for Lin Xiu’s decision to fight with Tang Tian in the martial arts battle, Lin Xiu thought about it carefully and it wasn’t a rash decision.

His Fury skill would have cooled down and with the completion of his Rapid Growth progress, it was very likely that Lin Xiu could defeat Tang Tian.

Although that medicine was amazing and allowed his broken bones to heal very quickly, Lin Xiu still decided not to cultivate the spear techniques today and took out the ‘Rapid Growth Enlightenment Card’ instead.

“Are you sure you want to use the Rapid Growth Enlightenment Card?”

After taking this card out, Lin Xiu received a system notification in his head.

“Yes!”

“Remaining time: 23:59:59”

The system began the countdown immediately.

At this moment, Lin Xiu felt that his mind was clear and felt as if he could figure out many things that he couldn’t before.

Lin Xiu sat cross-legged on the bed and began to use the ‘cultivation technique’.

Source energy, source energy!

Although Lin Xiu carried out each step in accordance with the instruction, he still could not feel the so-called source energy.

Lin Xiu frowned. The difficulty level was really for official warriors, was it really so difficult to cultivate?

Lin Xiu gritted his teeth and thought about how even Tang Tian, a quasi-warrior, had cultivated the source energy; it was impossible that Lin Xiu couldn’t!

With that thought, Lin Xiu continued.

He relaxed his body and used his heart to feel it.

Very soon, as Lin Xiu put aside all other thoughts and focused on the cultivation technique, he began to feel like there was something being absorbed into his pores.

There was a warm sensation that made Lin Xiu feel so comfortable that his knitted brows relaxed.

“Success!” Lin Xiu stood up and punched the air excitedly. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

With the first success, when Lin Xiu tried to use the cultivation technique again, the source energy began to be continuously absorbed into every muscle, bone, and cell in his body.

The source energy may be very little now, but with continuous practice, his body would become stronger and be able to absorb more source energy.

Other than allowing his body to be stronger, the source energy could also be stored in his body and through the release of source energy when he used high-level skills, it would allow the skills to be even more powerful.

Lin Xiu felt that it was very likely that his success in using the cultivation technique was due to the use of the Rapid Growth Enlightenment Card.

Also, Lin Xiu realized that with his continuous absorption of the source energy, his experience seemed to be slowly increasing.

Although it was very slow and it merely increased by over a hundred per hour, but after cultivating for one night, it would be over a thousand!

“Big news, big news! Loser Lin Xiu is going to the martial arts battle against Tang Tian!” This news appeared on the 3D projection television in class.

“Lin Xiu, he would be beaten to death!”

“Hahaha, I would like to see how Tang Tian beats him to death during the duel.”

“Useless Lin Xiu, what a joke.”

“...”

Other than Class 29, the students from other classes also found this piece of news hilarious.

Many people saw how Lin Xiu defeated Xu Jun, but most of them still felt that it was just an accident.

As it wasn’t the end of the term yet, the combat strength ranking wasn’t refreshed, so Lin Xiu was still at the bottom.

“Why would Lin Xiu fight with Tang Tian?” Yang Tian mumbled as he looked towards Lin Xiu’s seat.

As Lin Xiu requested a leave of absence, he wasn’t in class.

However, his theory results were great so the teacher didn’t make things hard for him.

“Big Brother, you must kill him! No, don’t kill him, break all his limbs!” Tang Ping said to Tang Tian.

Although his right arm had gone through treatment immediately, it would still need over ten days for it to fully recover.

“Don’t worry, I will help you take revenge. He’s simply courting death for provoking our Tang family.” Tang Tian nodded and said.

He took a sip of his tea and not long after, a man walked in.

“Young Master, Lin Xiu has been running in the training ground from morning till night these two days and didn’t do anything else.” The man said respectfully to Tang Tian.

“Running?” Tang Tian furrowed his brows. Ever since the fight that day, he knew that Lin Xiu was not really useless and even had a bit of combat strength. Otherwise, Lin Xiu wouldn’t be able to break Tang Ping’s wrist.

Initially, Tang Tian thought that Lin Xiu had a way of defeating him, but it seemed like he was just thinking too much.

——————————-

“Bronze skill- ‘Rupturing Fist’, as its name implies, it could cause an explosion in the air and it was said to be the most ferocious punch in close combat.”

Lin Xiu waved his fist to practice while mumbling to himself.

This Rupturing Fist might be a bronze skill, but its destructive power was comparable to that of a silver skill.

Lin Xiu found this skill card in the library and it was placed at the corner, covered in dust.

At first, Lin Xiu thought it was quite strange. Why didn’t anyone want to cultivate such a powerful skill? After careful questioning, he found out that this Rupturing Fist had a name called: Hurt self before hurting others.

The explosion caused by this Rupturing Fist would also shock the user’s body. If the user wasn’t strong enough, they would become disabled before successfully cultivating this skill.

There were quite a number of students who tried cultivating this skill before; after all, for quasi-warriors or rank 1 warriors, it was great to possess a bronze skill with the strength of a silver skill.

However, after these students cultivated the skill, they suffered from light internal bleeding and their bones broke.

Lin Xiu wasn’t rash when he chose to cultivate this skill. But he realized that the bottle of ointment in the Growth Gift Pack was simply too amazing; other than healing external injuries, it could be taken orally which would treat internal injuries. Also, the effects were fast and almost immediate.

The danger of the Rupturing Fist was at the beginning stage and once the user was proficient with the skill, the explosion would no longer cause any harm to the user.

Lin Xiu would run in the day and continuously wave his fist against a giant rock on the mountain behind the academy.

Under the moonlight, Lin Xiu was covered in sweat.

Also, Lin Xiu realized that other than the increase in running speed, the Rapid Growth had also improved the practice and use of skills.

“Bang, bang, bang.” The pounding went on continuously and many loose stones kept falling off the surface of that rock.

But Lin Xiu knew that this wasn’t enough. It was said that the true Rupturing Fist would cause damage to the enemy from inside out and just a single punch would damage the enemy’s internal organs.

Lin Xiu’s current state was still only causing damage externally and not internally.

At midnight, Lin Xiu would practice his spear art and the Awe of the phoenix skill.

He must say that the ‘Rapid Growth Enlightenment Card’ was really helpful. He was already skilled at spear art which actually required quite a long time to practice and the Awe of the Phoenix card had already turned into a silver skill. Near the early hours of the morning, Lin Xiu continued to sit cross-legged and absorb the source energy.

A warm sensation came to his originally tired body.

“Ding~~ Congratulations Master on leveling up. You’re currently at level 11!”
