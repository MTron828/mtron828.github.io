Chapter 5167: Waiting For The Immortal’s Return

“I’m just worried that you won’t be able to keep it.” Li Qiye said.

“There is nothing I, Crimson Dragon Monarch, can’t handle.” The monarch laughed.

“He’s telling the truth.” The saintess interjected.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“I can easily subdue a million-year blood ginseng. Junior, don’t waste time.” The monarch didn’t buy it.

“Fine, take it.” Li Qiye smiled and flicked the ginseng.

It immediately lunged at the monarch.

“Come!” The monarch reached for it, looking confident.

However, it dodged the grasp and coiled around him before stopping on top of his head, catching him off guard. The roots turned into a palm and pressed down on his head as it opened its green eyes.

“Buzz.” Since the monarch’s head was being held in place, he had no choice but to look at the green eyes.

He misjudged the ginseng from the start and thought that it would be easy. Thus, he was caught off guard and became mesmerized by its special ability.

Roots began drilling into his body and grew at an insane rate, piercing into each inch of flesh. However, there was no sensation of pain.

Nonetheless, he understood how dangerous this was and broke free from the spell: “Activate!”

His two sacred fruits immediately attempted to halt the overgrowth within him. Alas, the eyes of the ginseng became larger and brighter. Its light invaded the monarch’s eyes.

The monarch lost control of his body and reverted to his original form - a gigantic glowing snake.

The saintess shuddered after seeing the ginseng’s frightening eyes. This was her first time seeing it in person; this made her realize how weak she was. It definitely didn’t need the eyes to kill her a while ago.

“Zzz…” The roots began sucking the monarch’s blood. This process happened so quickly that the radiant dragon turned thinner at a visible rate.

“Ahh!” During his last seconds, the monarch woke up and tried to resist. Alas, his blood had been fully drained while he was still under the ginseng’s spell.

“Crack!” Finally, the two sacred fruits were also devoured and cracked into pieces.

Just like that, a dragon lord had been killed due to carelessness. The ginseng gained a ruby glow after absorbing the monarch.

After seeing this, one would gain a new understanding of its value as an alchemy ingredient. As for the saintess, she thought that it was more frightening than the descriptions from the scrolls.

They only depicted its value and medicinal effects, not its hunger and offensive potential.

Once it had a full meal, the ginseng glanced back at Li Qiye for a second before drilling into the ground, not wanting to be around him for another second.

“Everyone wants to eat ginseng, but the opposite is also true.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

She paused for a moment after hearing this and saw him walking away. She caught up and said: “Young Noble, are you here for the immortal medicine?”

“Immortal medicine?” Li Qiye stopped and stared at her.

“You haven’t heard the rumors? It’s due to the special phenomena accompanying its appearance.” She said.

“You’re an alchemy from a reputable sect, tell me your opinion on it.” He asked.

His tone made her feel as if she was being tested by a senior from the sect.

“When we discuss immortal medicine, we are often referring to alchemy ingredients above the imperial level. Everything above falls into this general classification.” For some reason, she decided to answer earnestly.

“However, our ancestor taught that there is no true immortal medicine in our world. If they do exist, it means that immortality is possible. Since no one has obtained immortality, we can conclude that immortal medicines also do not exist.” She continued.

“Sounds about right. Good answer.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Young Noble, are you related to our sect?” She couldn’t help but ask.

He only smiled and didn’t answer.

“But, our ancestral scroll does have a different explanation for Immortal’s Peak.” She continued.

“Oh?” He became interested.

“There is indeed a heaven-defying ingredient here.” She said calmly: “But our ancestor says that this isn’t the important point but rather, the peak’s origin. In the past, there were fairies who observe the sky here.”

“Fairies?” He smiled.

“Yes, they were waiting for an immortal.” She nodded.

“Sounds like a tale, nothing more.” Li Qiye said.

“I don’t believe in rumors but this came from our ancestor. It states that one day, an immortal will return. The fairy isn’t the only one who is waiting, others are as well.” She shook her head.

“Waiting for the immortal.” Li Qiye paused for a bit before sighing: “Immortals don’t exist.”

“Our ancestor was sure of it.” She said with confidence: “The two fairies made this place their home after a long search for the immortal. Eventually, they kept on waiting and waiting before turning into the peak, hence its name.”
