Chapter 5492: Undying Loyalty

“You have your own path.” He said.

“Yes, it is unfortunate. One day when I reach the ultimate, I will offer you my undying loyalty.” She bowed.

“Go now.” He waved his hand.

“I wonder when we will meet again since it’s time for me to leave Celestial Court.” She added, realizing that Celestial Court’s judgment day drew near.

“It depends on how far you can go. If you do reach that state, the path will be before you. As long as you keep on walking, you’ll meet me again.” He said.

“Thank you, Sir.” She got on her knees and kowtowed. Although Li Qiye didn’t give her anything, he guided her to the right path but most importantly, he spared her life despite the potential consequences.

He also didn’t seal her, giving her a lifetime of freedom. This was no different from being another parent granting her life to this world.

After finishing the rite, she disappeared from the horizon. He moved on deeper into the region; the repulsive aura intensified as a result.

At this point, mighty dao lords and emperors could no longer restrain their hatred and rage. This was usually when people would give up before puking and being drowned by negative emotions.

They were unstoppable like a tsunami. In fact, lingering excessively would rob them of happiness, causing them to hate their own life as well. This could eventually cause them to produce their own auras of repulsion.

This was why the area became a no-man-land after the emperor’s death. No one wanted to take the risk.

Eventually, Li Qiye made it to the corpse of the emperor. Normally, even a barren land devoid of life still had death energy or other nefarious creatures of this affinity.

In this case, if death had legs, it would start running away as well. Nothing but hatred and repulsion were left behind. The most repulsive abomination in the world would still not want to stay here for a second.

Only a pool could be seen but to be more exact, it was more like a puddle of water. It didn’t look dirty and there was nothing disgusting about it.

Nonetheless, none could stand it. A dirty puddle of water was still essentially water. This thing was absolute disgust. It infiltrated the deepest recesses of the soul and unleashed disgust.

To what extent was this repulsion? One would prefer to fall to the eighteen levels of hell and be subjected to torment and suffering than stay here.

“Even I would like to spit and leave, this is unbearable indeed.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but let out a sigh while staring at the puddle.

However, he sat down near the puddle instead and stared at the corpse beneath. No one else could stare at it for long outside of Li Qiye.

The corpse suddenly sat up but this wouldn’t frighten anyone. Hatred was stronger than fear in this particular case.

He wore a gray robe with white patches - a sign of being washed numerous times. Nonetheless, it was torn and stained with dirt.

He didn’t have too many wrinkles but his complexion was yellow; his hands were tanned from potentially poor living conditions - working hard year-round and suffering from malnutrition. His hair was sparse and white, a disheveled mess now.

He had only a few teeth here and teeth, stained black and yellow with cavities. Such an old man should evoke sympathy instead of disgust.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The imprint of a palm could be seen on his chest - shattering everything and leaving him to die here. It should be noted that even his killer tried their best not to physically touch him, resorting to a spatial palm strike instead. The wound caused hatred to ooze out and engulfed the battlefield.

This hatred of life and all else was a primal force, as pure as could be.

“I’m still so repulsive after death?” The old man looked down at the wound and said.

“I myself don’t want to be infected by your aura either.” Li Qiye said.

“Yet here you are.” The old man said, seemingly a bit happy to see Li Qiye. This rare expression of joy wasn’t as repulsive.

“Who else could take care of your corpse but me? I can’t just let it rot here forever.” Li Qiye smiled.
