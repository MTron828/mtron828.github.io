Chapter 5133: Plucking Tea Leaves?

Li Qiye took his time sensing the auras of this world, the invisible dao rhythms that have been accumulating for eras.

It became obvious to him that this Peace Goddess did more than just teach the dao here. She also imprinted a foundation into the land - in the soil, the rocks, the trees…

He wasn’t in a hurry to find his target and enjoyed seeing the villagers. He saw children playing and grandpas lazing around. Some villagers were cultivating and creating treasures…

All of this seemed so natural and didn’t conflict with one another. Worries and sadness took a back seat.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” He saw one cultivator soaring through the air while ringing a gong and announcing: “Attention, please! True Bear Mountain has been destroyed by Heavenly Sword. Heaven Alliance seems to be on the offensive against Dao Alliance, please be on guard for potential trouble.”

This caused quite a stir among the villagers.

“Will Heaven Alliance attack us?” The peaceful atmosphere was broken.

“What’s there to be afraid of? It’s not a new thing, Immemorial, Skysplitter, Grand Dao, so many wars already yet our villages are still here.” One villager lay back down and relaxed.

“I guess so.” The others agreed because Peace didn’t care for the struggle between Celestial Court and Immortal Dao City.

“Let Windchaser Hall deal with it.” Another said: “Heaven Alliance will start there first, not our villages.”

The cultivator who warned them earlier came from this sect.

“Windchaser Conqueror will have to stop the first wave.” They began talking about the potential war.

“The conqueror might not be there right now.” An older villager shook his head.

They were very familiar with this conqueror since he came from Peace. According to the rumors, he came across a special fortune at a young age, allowing him to obtain a dao fruit.

He then started a sect right outside of the village - Windchaser Hall. Afterward, he occasionally visited the village since it was his home.

Many ancestors from there came to the village to teach the dao as well. There was a friendly relationship between the two sides.

Recently, the conqueror rarely appeared. Some believed that he had left Windchaser to join Dao Alliance.

“Leave this matter alone for a bit. Let the brats in the village prepare for the incoming teapluck festival and test their luck.” A few old men said.

A towering peak existed in Peace - as enormous as a colossal giant. All the villages seemed to be built around it.

Since it was surrounded by clouds and fog, its whole appearance couldn’t be viewed. Paths could be seen leading to the elusive pinnacle. Up there was a tea tree with branches looking like dragons.

It seemed tiny compared to the peak but its aura was second to none - like a dragon ready to soar. It was rather famous throughout the two continents - its dao tea could be considered the best.

Rumor has it that this was the abode of Peace Goddess. Some went further to say that she eventually transformed into this peak.

These rumors couldn’t be verified but no one doubted the effectiveness of the tea. The goddess herself planted the tree.

After drinking the tea, one would be connected with the chaos and the dao. Cultivation speed and comprehension soared subsequently.

Thus, whenever the leaves were ready to be plucked, children from the village would climb up to test their luck. This included outsiders as well.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye was at the base of Peace Mountain since he saw a large gathering including villagers and outsiders.

They stood before the stone path leading up to the pinnacle. A wooden arched door awaited and welcomed them.

“Everyone’s here for some tea leaves?” He got closer and conversed with them.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“The clouds and fog are still there, we have to wait.” A villager enthusiastically said: “It’s too dangerous otherwise and even afterward, only the fateful can get up there.”

“Yes, only a few can make it.” An older villager joined in: “I think this is true for many eras now.”

“Windchaser Conqueror made it up there.” Another said: “That’s what reason why he was able to become a conqueror.”

The crowd started talking about the conqueror right away since they recognized him.

Suddenly, a youth and his entourage boisterously interrupted their conversation. He had the aura of a sovereign who was quite impressive given his age.

Many villagers staggered backward, unable to handle the pressure.

“The tea leaves are available now?” He looked at them and asked.

“Only the fateful can get the tea leaves.” A villager snorted.

“For now, that is. True Bear is gone and this land will become a part of Heaven Alliance soon enough. This peak will be under our jurisdiction then.” The youth uttered coldly.

“Save those words for the future. Windchaser Hall is still around.” Another genius stepped forward and rebutted.
