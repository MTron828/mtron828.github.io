Chapter 3772: Xu Cuimei’s Thoughts

Sun rays illuminated the gurgling creek with a golden hue. As the water rippled, it appeared as golden powders were floating along the currents.

“Splash!” A carp leaped out of the water and shared the same glow.

Li Qiye sat on a boulder, asleep and looking like a statue. Minor Sacred Mountain was quiet without anyone coming to disturb him from his zen state.

The young cultivators in the holy ground and even the older experts have left to observe Righteous Scion. Thus, serenity returned to the mountain.

After seeing the fall of Smoke-fire Fortress, numerous experts and big shots were on the move.

This had nothing to do with stopping the scion. They merely wanted to watch all the battles possible in order to see his power and benefit from it. The fortress event made it clear that they wouldn’t be able to stop him.

In reality, very few older experts could beat him in battle. Thus, the young ones would only be asking for humiliation by challenging him.

The scion traveled across the land in a haughty manner. He flew above numerous sects without hiding his aura. This didn’t change as he crossed ancestral grounds either.

This naturally infuriated the members of these clans and sects. It was nothing short of blatant provocation.

Not only that, he even visited the well-known sites of the holy ground. These places contained vestiges and memorials of the old sages. He seemed to be purposely provoking his opponents by doing so.

Nonetheless, not a single soul dared to fight him. Most great powers didn’t have the strength to put up a real fight. The only way was to go all-out and this wasn’t worth the price.

This feeling was vexing but the scion’s notoriety was at an all-time high. Some even thought that only the four grandmasters would be able to beat him.

Li Qiye didn’t care about the rumors and stories spreading across the land. He simply focused on fishing at the creek.

Today, he had an uninvited guest. He opened his eyes and took a look - a beauty stood before him.

She was none other than Xu Cuimei of Righteous Sect. However, Thunderblade and Cloudwhip weren’t with her today. She walked closer and bowed deeply.

“Where are your lackeys today?” He smiled.

She sat down next to him on the boulder and smiled back: “It’s troublesome bringing them around, you wouldn’t like it either, Young Master.”

“Smart, Righteous will prosper with a disciple like you around.” He praised.

“I’m elated to hear this even though I am unworthy.” She shook her head: “Our sect can’t do anything while you are present at the holy ground. Offending you will result in being trampled on the ground.”

“I don’t represent the holy ground. A passerby like me will leave sooner or later.” He chuckled.

“But I’m sure you will pick a successor, Young Master.” She rested her chin on both palms and stared at him.

“That’s possible.” He didn’t answer directly.

“The holy ground is so lucky to have a talent such as yourself, no one else can compare.” She said quietly.

“You’re going to make me smug praising me like this.” He joked.

“As if mere praises can please you, that would be a miracle.” Her eyebrows were perfectly shaped like crescent moons, looking both pretty and cute.

“Given your attitude, it looks like I’ll have to take it easy on you later.” He smiled.

“Thank you ahead of time, Young Master.” She responded.

“Let’s see here. Hmm, you have the potential to prove your dao and become a dao lord.” He stated.

“Perhaps, but Eight Desolaces is vaster than our imagination with too many geniuses to count. Nothing is certain in the future.” She tilted her head in contemplation.

“That’s the right mindset.” He nodded. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Unfortunately, with Young Master around, we’re just fireflies trying to compete with the moon.” She shook her head.

“Are you here today to just flatter me?” He asked.

“No, I’m here to gather information.” Her lips pursed up slightly into a faint smile.

“Oh? Regarding what?” He didn’t mind.

“I’m curious about your merit laws that are capable of breaking our seven chapters. It doesn’t look like you have cultivated anything from the holy ground due to a lack of Buddhist affinity.” Her shimmering eyes brimmed with curiosity.

She didn’t try to hide her intention so she met his gaze directly.

“Train and practice, practice and train. I’ve gradually forgotten many things during this process. Maybe chalk it up to old age and a bad memory.” He casually answered.

“Forgotten?” She didn’t expect this answer and took her time analyzing it.

This wasn’t plausible since a cultivator would never forget their merit laws. Moreover, he emphasized the “training” part. As one trained more, they would have a deeper impression of their merit laws, not the opposite.

Nonetheless, she was intelligent and knowledgeable enough to read the deeper meanings.

“Grand Dao Oblivion or Grand Dao Immaculation... These only belong in the legends, I haven’t heard of anyone obtaining these states...” She murmured. [1]

He chuckled and didn’t answer.

“Young Master, you seem to be shrouded in fog, as inscrutable as can be yet I can’t help but want to learn more.” She touched her chin and ruminated for a while before looking up to tell him.

“Knowing too much isn’t always a good thing. It might be a source of fear and will affect your cultivation in the future.” He said.

“I see, I will keep this in mind.” She nodded.

“What are you trying to do?” He asked.

She narrowed her eyes. Though she looked lovable with a smile, there were secrets hidden deep in her eyes along with wisdom.

“I’m not at fault, I was only playing around before wholeheartedly focusing on my goal. That’s why the world misunderstood, I’m sure.” She shrugged in response.

“Most can’t do this. They care too much about fame and honor, unable to be at peace.” He replied.

“There have been plenty of sages in history. Though there are plenty of worthless cultivators too, my achievements are nothing compared to the great ones.” She said.

“You have a good way of thinking. This makes you inferior to no one.” He nodded.

“And you, Young Master? Fame and honor aren’t your pursuits either. What is it that you seek?” She smiled at him, wanting to satiate her curiosity.

A brief silence ensued. He eventually said: “An answer.”

“An answer?” This wasn’t the expected response but she didn’t pry any further.

1. Oblivion here means to forget everything else and seek the dao alone. Immaculation means a perfect dao, shapeless and all-encompassing.
