Chapter 4540: Yin Wheel

Calamity was a mysterious dao lord with numerous legends. A consensus was that he came from a secret realm and was certainly a demon.

To be exact, his original form was a snail. Before becoming a dao lord, he took advantage of this and used his shell as a weapon versed in both offense and defense.

The strongest weapon had a hard time scratching this shell, let alone breaking it. Because of this, ever since his debut, he rarely suffered an injury.

Of course, possessing one of the toughest things in existence only played one part. His own power was just as impressive.

One snail, one shell, unbeatable. This phrase was often used to describe Calamity Dao Lord.

Amusingly enough, the most memorable thing about the dao lord was not his unbreakable shell but rather - something known as Elucidation Calamities.

This knowledge came from the previous epoch. No one currently could possibly research or fathom this truth. It was completely different from the current cultivation system, hence the impossibility.

Most importantly, after cultivating this art to the highest level, one would be able to call down calamities relating to the Heaven’s Will or the mysteries of the world.

Therefore, calamities could descend from several sources - the whim of the dao lord or negative comments about him.

A weaker calamity would result in one death; a more serious one would destroy a clan or a kingdom. Therefore, no one dared to say a thing about the dao lord during his era.

Though countless years have passed, he was still considered a taboo existence.

“How did Calamity Dao Lord enter?” Jian Ming’s curiosity made him courageous.

“It is said that when the crossing opened and the Yin Wheel activated, the dao lord forced his way in under the protection of his shell.” WIse Ancestor glanced at the wheel.

“Did he enter the cycle?” Jian Ming immediately asked.

“No one knew but he came back alive, albeit with serious injuries. Even his renowned shell was heavily damaged.” Wise shook his head.

“That’s something to brag about, the only one to return alive.” Jian Ming murmured.

“He wasn’t the only famous cultivator to try. Unbeatable ancestors from Pursun or True Immortal have done so. Unfortunately, they were reduced to ashes..” The daoist said.

“Do you think that this strange place is the key to reincarnation?” Jian Ming couldn’t help but ask.

“There has to be a reason for all of this, the emissary and the crossing. We don’t know whether rebirth is real but most believe in it.” The daoist said.

“Hehe, so have your clan done any research on this? Did you try to calculate the secrets here?” Jian Ming went on.

“No.” The daoist didn’t elaborate, this seemed to be a sensitive topic for their clan.

“Why not? Maybe you’ll be able to understand the mysteries of Yin Yang Crossing, enough to reach the other shore.” Jian Ming didn’t give up.

“Mortals aren’t meant to understand the cycle of life and birth.” The daoist snorted.

Meanwhile, more groups continued to arrive. Even a few reclusive masters started showing their faces once more. The atmosphere became rather intimidating.

‘Why are they here? They’re scheming against the dead?” Jian Ming stared at the big shots and asked.

“Something’s off. Normally, only juniors or those without background would come here, wanting to steal from the graves or meet their ancestors. Great powers care too much about their reputation to do this but look, many reclusive masters are here.” Wise observed for a bit before whispering.

“Even a few ancient clans from the east are here.” The daoist added.

“Let me go ask around.” Jian Ming immediately ran over and acted familiar with a random crowd member.

“Brother, you here to get rich?” He smiled and said: “You got an ancestor coming out for this crossing with an heirloom?”

He went around and asked sensitive questions. The actual answers didn’t matter; he was merely reading their expression.

“Everyone’s here for Seer Monarch’s divinatory trigram.” After a while, someone gave him useful information.

“Oh? I see, I see.” He said before running around again.

He returned to the group and said: “They’re here because of a famous big shot buried in the cemetery. Seer Monarch calculated that this being would come out this time to enter the cycle.”

Having said that, he stared at the daoist and smirked: “Seer Monarch is very famous in Sky Border. Heh, is he related to your clan?”

“Hmph, only an inadequate side branch.” The daoist snorted with contempt.

So it turned out that the ancestor of this Seer Monarch was indeed from his clan. However, he left and started his own lineage.

“What’s with the contempt? Seer Monarch’s skill is world-renowned. So many great powers come to ask him for help while you is only known as a swindler despite being from such a prestigious clan.” Jian Ming teased.

“Divining and calculating are to understand the heaven’s machination, not for vain fame.” The daoist retorted.

“In my opinion, your skill is far inferior. Seer Monarch is rumored to instantly know the future after one reading.” Jian Ming didn’t give him any face.

“Nonsense.” The daoist snorted: “False advertisement with trumpets and drums. Not to mention our forefather, he probably can’t even compare to the Grand Seer of Seer Watch in West King.” VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Sounds like you’re the one falsely advertising about your clan.” Jian Ming remained skeptical.

“His abilities came from our clan and his ancestor was only an outer disciple. You tell me whether I’m lying or not.” The daoist said with pride.

“I see, my mistake.” Jian Ming continued: “Then can you calculate which big shot everyone is here for?”

The daoist couldn’t help but touch his seering shell after hearing this. Alas, he eventually shook his head: “We do not spy on the dead.”

“Fine.” Jian Ming scowled and said: “I was only testing you, I’m sure that it’s an ancient ancestor from a famous sect given the circumstances.”

“It’s Everlasting Monarch from True immortal.” A random youth nearby suddenly interjected.
