Chapter 4289: New Sect Master

The other four elders contemplated after hearing their leader.

“I support letting Young Noble Li become the next sect master.” Elder Hu stated his stance as well.

Only three were left. Of course, the first elder’s decision was rather influential since he was the strongest with the most authority and prestige.

This meant that many other disciples would also support Li Qiye.

“Count my vote too.” The second elder also supported Li Qiye, leaving the fourth and fifth elder.

In other words, their choice didn’t actually matter at all.

“Since everyone has decided, let him be the sect master.” The fifth elder said. Refusing was meaningless. Plus, he had no ill-will towards Li Qiye and believed that the previous sect master must have had a reason.

“I support as well, it is decided then.” The fourth elder was the last.

Therefore, it was a unanimous decision to support Li Qiye to become their sect master. This was a favorable development for the sect since the five were in solidarity. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Little Diamond might be small now but as long as their members had this level of comradery, flourishing was inevitable. This was a minor consolation after losing their leader.

“Let’s prepare for the ceremony then.” The first elder said.

“Should we invite guests?” The fourth elder asked.

Despite being a small sect, they still had friends and allies nearby. Thus, the succession ceremony was important enough to invite them.

However, they needed to keep the death of the previous sect master a secret.

“No, keep it low-key.” The first elder decided.

“Yes, these are special circumstances. We’ll inform them when the time is right.” The second elder agreed that this wasn’t the right time for fanfare.

“Very well, Brother Hu, you’ll be responsible for talking with Young Noble Li regarding this matter.” The others decided and Elder Hu agreed.

Elder Hu then personally came to visit Li Qiye about this matter. The latter was looking at the blue sky.

After a while, he stared at the elder and said: “I see.”

Of course, this position didn’t tempt him in the slightest.

“We five elders all agreed that you would be perfect as the next sect master, Young Noble Li.” Elder Hu said.

“That’s fine, but what makes you think I’m interested?” Li Qiye smiled.

“...” Elder Hu hasn’t thought of this yet. They didn’t discuss this possibility in detail. It’s not as if they could force him.

“Please think about it, Young Noble.” Elder Gu smiled wryly: “Our sect sincerely awaits your leadership.”

They trusted their previous sect master to know what he was doing. Elder Hu himself believed that Li Qiye could bring a change to their sect.

The elders knew that if Li Qiye were to refuse, the first elder would become the sect master. Alas, they were also aware that nothing would come from this.

He was already old and could be stuck at the minor level of the Yin Yang realm. Thus, he was weaker than the previous sect master, meaning that their sect had suffered an overall weakening. This didn’t bode well for the future.

They were already a minor sect. A continual decline meant potential destruction during their generation. That would be their worst nightmare.

Therefore, they were hopeful of Li Qiye. The sect might be able to develop better with this stranger leading them.

“Fine, let’s chalk this up to fate. I have time anyway and will grant you all a fortune.” Li Qiye said.

“Great!” The elder became excited because of Li Qiye’s attitude. He felt as if his sect had just come across a treasure.

Putting Little Diamond’s humble state aside, an experienced youth should be ecstatic to become a sect master. However, Li Qiye sounded as if he was doing them a favor.

He became more confident that Li Qiye could change the direction of their sect. He left and reported this to his peers before arranging a quiet ceremony.

The process was rather simple. All of the sect’s disciples were recalled for the funeral of the previous sect master first. On the second day was Li Qiye’s coronation. No outside guests were invited to the event.

The fellow disciples witnessed Li Qiye on the front stage. The majority was very surprised and stared intensely at Li Qiye.

They were aware that he wasn’t a member of their sect, and that the previous sect master was the one who made this decision.

They also wondered why the five elders agreed to it. Nonetheless, since it was a unanimous decision, they also accepted this without a fight - something not seen in the larger sects.

Li Qiye also observed the crowd as they stared at him.
