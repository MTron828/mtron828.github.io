Chapter 5712: Death’s Horn

“Rumble!” A new world opened and figures appeared amidst the vast ocean of Imperial Field, culminating into an endless legion of specters made from death energy or remnant intents.

“A legion of death? Where the hell did it come from?!” Defenders were terrified to see the sheer number.

“Can’t you see, they’re the fallen from Grand Dao War, both sides...” An ancient ancestor shuddered.

“They’re all summoned...” An emperor took a deep breath after seeing the horn summoning the dead.

“Wuuu-” The horn sounded again, seemingly giving the order to march.

Sure enough, the legion rushed toward Imperial Field and Immortal Emperor Slaughtering Formation.

“Kill them!” The defenders had no choice but to shift their focus onto the legion of death. This gave the armies of Celestial Court a chance to breathe.

The horn never stopped echoing. Its enigmatic light reached the bottom of the ocean to call out stronger existences. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The seabed could be seen after a massive blast. Deep cracks appeared and out came majestic figures. Imperial auras instantly swept through the realm.

These figures possessed two auras - imperial and death.

“Even the fallen emperors are out now...” All spectators gasped at this sight.

“Benevolence Conqueror, Palatial Divine Emperor, Lunar Cassia Ancient God...” A timeworn ancestor recognized many of these figures.

The blood of the strongest combatants from both sides stained the ocean after death. Some sank to the bottom; others were buried in the bellies of fish. Others had their corpses taken away...

However, they were summoned by the horn today.

“They’re returning from hell?” A young expert murmured.

“Not hell.” An ancient ancestor said: “This is death energy, they didn’t give up even after dying in battle.”

“Boom!” These cultivators rushed forward and launched a mighty assault.

“Merge!” Demon gave the order since the slaughter formation could no longer cover the entire Imperial Field.

Halo, Starflash, Brightleaf, and other leaders had no choice but to pull back their primordial trees, contracting the radius of the formation. This resulted in abandoned islands.

With the radius lowered, the arrows became even stronger and obliterated the first waves of specters. Not even imperial-level specters survived.

However, the wailing horn simply summoned them again. This started a cycle of killing and resummoning. The undead legion couldn’t be completely eradicated despite the formation’s potency.

“We have to destroy that horn or this will end with us running out of energy and vitality.” Someone noted something crucial - the horn must be destroyed or they would lose despite possessing the ultimate formation.

“Boom!” An emperor from The People who has been watching in the shadows suddenly took action.

He appeared out of nowhere and unleashed a devastating attack, crushing a radius of ten thousand miles around the horn.

Unfortunately, the horn simply flickered and appeared in another location.

“An illusion? Or instantaneous teleportation?” The ambusher was puzzled after the failed attack.

“Wu-” The sound of the horn became increasingly resounding.

Monstrous waves surged from the ocean as enormous creatures emerged from the depths. Their immense size sent shivers down one’s spine, not to mention the variety.

A gigantic crab with claws capable of crushing islands, one dragon with a frightening amount of draconic energy, an alligator who could devour the stars in one gulp...

“Monsters from time immemorial...” Their appearance was enough to make anyone scream.

Long, long ago, these extraordinary monsters dominated this ocean. Their demise came from the hands of cultivators or old age but now, the horn had brought them back.

“Rumble!” They charged ferociously toward Imperial Field, stirring up tsunamis along the way.
