Chapter 5062: Meeting

As the youths took a deep breath, they felt an infantile life force from all the entities present. This seemed to be the start of a pristine world, still untouched by humans. The winds in the air carried traces of grass and beasts.

“What a comforting serenity.” Ming Shi took a deep breath and said while feeling the urge to roll on the green field to forget about the competitive ways and worries of life.

She couldn’t help reverting back to her original form - a rabbit. She started running in the field as fast as she could and this made Li Qiye smile.

Tendril King, on the other hand, lacked the same innocence and youthful spark. She was the leader of Untethered, bound with immense responsibilities. Ming Shi was sheltered from all of this.

She took a deep breath before reflecting sentimentally: “This place makes it hard to leave.”

Her original form was a vine so she had the urge to take root in this paradise.

“This place is indeed beneficial to you.” Li Qiye smiled.

It took her a while to become accustomed to the area. She then bowed and said: “I apologize, this is my first time feeling such a pure and pristine life force.”

“It’s good that you can sense it, meaning that it is fate of sorts and will be great for your future.” He said.

“I can’t express my gratitude enough.” She bowed her head.

The three of them traveled across this joyous land; Ming Shi was still in her rabbit form and laughed happily.

Tendril King, on the other hand, enjoyed this atmosphere and tried to learn its dao. Each step was a learning process and it brought joy to the heart and mind. This was how cultivation should be.

“I didn’t know that such a paradise exist in this world.” She said while harmonizing with the grand dao.

“It doesn’t.” Li Qiye glanced upward and smiled.

“What do you mean, Young Noble?” She asked.

“As long as there is life, there is karma, and with karma, there are emotions, both positive and negative.” Li Qiye said.

“True.” She agreed that this was a part of life.

“So-called paradises require protection and self-restraint. Will you practice either on your path?” Li Qiye asked.

“Protection and self-restraint.” She contemplated.

“You are a dragon lord and one day, you might be able to reach this realm.” Li Qiye said while staring at her: “A choice must be made at the apex.”

“A choice must be made?” She asked for further elaboration.

“Yes, you had an original aspiration for embarking on the path of cultivation. If you reach the apex one day, will you look back and reflect to see if the goal is still the same?” Li Qiye said: “This conviction determines how far you go and the choice you will make.”

“I see.” She then understood what he meant by protection and self-restraint.

“An endless path, to be trodden alone.” Li Qiye recited with a touch of poetic grace.

“An eternal path, freed from ego and shackles.” Another voice answered, one with a unique cadence. This gave the impression that the speaker was one of few words. His delivery was slow with an ancient style but this only added to the charm.

“Ah!” On the other side, Ming Shi suddenly screamed and ran to the foot of a towering hill.

“Rumble!” A strange scene occurred - large creatures made of numerous circular bone fragments showed up, looking like worms.

They were also startled by her voice and all looked up. This scared her even more because they only had a hole where the head should be. Inside the hole were numerous rotating wheels capable of grinding anything to dust.

Fortunately, it seemed that they were gentle herbivores, just spending their time feeding on the verdant grass.

When Ming Shi came a little closer, they escaped by drilling into the ground.

“Vast the dao is yet I still meet you. Must be fate.” The ancient voice sounded again.

Ming Shi finally saw the speaker - a divine tiger climbing down the mountain.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

It was majestic with an overwhelming presence. Its sheer aura alone was suffocating and regal but the true master was an old monkey sitting on its back. Its fur was clean and neat.

Its aura couldn’t compare to the ferocious tiger yet it had no problem riding the creature. This combination seemed as natural as the sun rising from the east.

The monkey also exuded a daoist presence just like an immortal. The skeletal worms earlier came out again and squirmed around the monkey, looking happy like dogs playing with their master.

“Who are you?” Ming Shi was surprised to see such a strange scene. The worms didn’t look scary anymore.

“Ming Shi, be respectful. I am a member of Untethered Lineage, it is a pleasure to meet you, Senior.” Tendril King ran over and bowed.

“Be at ease, this is just the wilderness.” The monkey’s voice remained simple as if he hasn’t spoken human language in a very long time.

“You look familiar…” Ming Shi said but couldn’t recall the details.

“He created the tiger deity branch.” Li Qiye came over and answered.

“Oh, that’s what it is! No wonder why, so you were being worshipped by the rooster in the city.” Ming Shi exclaimed.
