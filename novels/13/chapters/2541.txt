Li Qiye smiled in response: “Who says I will die in here? I’m afraid only your group will.”

“You can actually leave?” Poison Phoenix Lady blurted in disbelief.

“Nothing’s hard about it.” He chuckled: “I mean, I can’t be tired of living enough to come here and die? All of you were thrown here but I came on my own volition.”

The group was shaken. The brief exchange earlier clearly demonstrated his might.

They were captured and thrown here by Lucidity King but this wasn’t the case for him. Someone as powerful as him shouldn’t be insane.

Clearly knowing that there was no escape yet still coming inside?

It should indicate that he could leave, or at the very least, he knew different methods to leave. That’s why he took a great risk in coming. It wasn’t quite suicidal.

“Impossible!” Golden Dragon shouted: “This is a prison of death, there’s no way out!”

Skepticism was warranted since they have been stuck here for so long despite trying every method possible. Moreover, the rest of the prisoners were dead as well, so how could he believe Li Qiye’s claim?

“That’s on you for not having a firm enough dao heart.” He smiled.

“Hmm...” The group wavered in their belief, albeit not completely.

There was no door or exit here, only a land of death. Perhaps an exit didn’t exist in the first place since they have been searching for so long.

“You all can believe whatever you want.” Li Qiye added.

The strongest among them, Ill Lord, became interested: “According to the records of Nine Secrets, no one has been able to leave the prison, death or alive.”

He was a great genius from War Saint and had read all the records pertinent to the prison, even those from the older eras of his kingdom.

“That’s your problem. I won’t kill you since you’ll die here anyway.” Li Qiye answered before turning to leave.

The group glanced at each other, not knowing what to do. Their experiments in the last generation have failed so they could only wait for death.

Because of this, their mental state was actually quite good. If death was inescapable, then struggling was futile, so why bother worrying about it?

But now, Li Qiye has broken this peace of mind. They could no longer stay calm after hearing that he had a way out. Even an ant wanted to live, let alone a person.

These great beings wanted to leave this place in order to see the sun again, a chance for a second life.

“Hey, wait, wait a bit.” The scholar couldn’t help but call out.

Li Qiye stopped and looked back: “What now? I’m in a hurry.”

The group hesitated for a moment. In the end, the scholar was the one to speak: “You can actually leave?”

“Why should I lie to people whom I can crush easily like ants?” Li Qiye chuckled.

The five froze and held their breath, still in awe that monstrous existences like them were considered as ants by Li Qiye. Alas, they had to admit that the guy wouldn’t have any difficulty in killing them. The disparity was too great.

“How about taking us out too?” The scholar implored.

Begging wasn’t their forte, not something they have ever done before due to pride but Li Qiye was their only hope right now.

“There is no free lunch in this world, what’s in it for me?” He rubbed his chin and asked.

The five naturally understood this logic from their own experiences in life. Li Qiye didn’t know them so he wouldn’t save them for no reason.

“What do you want?” The lady asked.

He shook his head and smiled: “I’m afraid you can’t give me what I want.”

“Not necessarily.” The hot-headed Wild Bull slapped his chest and said: “I still have a secret treasury outside. My clan has several amazing items that will be yours if you take me out.”

He shook his head again: “I’m not looking down on anyone here, but the truth is, your items won’t fit my requirements. Even progenitorial items might not.”

The group became frozen but they accepted this harsh truth since they have seen his abilities.

Just how strong was this person? They started speculating - perhaps at the bare minimum, he would be at the level of a progenitor. Moreover, not at the myriad level. No, not even at the imperial level. This person must be at least as strong as an immortal-level progenitor.

Such a being would reign supreme, standing at the very apex, and wouldn’t care about their items. What they considered to be divine artifacts would be nothing more than scrap metals in the eyes of the true masters.

“What are your conditions? We’ll agree as long as we can do them.” Golden Dragon blurted out.

Nothing was more tempting than leaving this hell hole for them right now, akin to a thirsty man trapped in a desert - he would do anything for a sip of water. Everything was on the table.

“You’re making this difficult for me since I don’t really want anything for you.” Li Qiye rubbed his chin, contemplating. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The arrogant group became silent, still not used to being treated this way. They were still imperious in front of Lucidity King, especially Ill Lord who was even a level above.

However, keeping their head high was an issue in front of Li Qiye. The things they took pride in were insignificant to him.

“But it’s within the realm of possibility.” He added after a moment of rumination.

The group’s eyes lit up for the fire of hope in their mind has been kindled.

“Really?” Wild Bull eagerly asked.

Li Qiye responded: “Your treasures might be useless to me, but I can use a few lackeys and servants. I will leave positions open for you all, if you agree.”

The group glanced at each other, slightly jolted and confused by this role reversal. After all, Eternals like them viewed everyone else as weaklings. They were ancestors or big shots of their clans and sects, enjoying the worship and respect of the descendants in Imperial. Now, they needed to be his errand boys?
