Chapter 5601: Den Of Swindlers

The emperor’s declaration lit a spark in his allies. He might be the oldest among them - a member of the previous epoch. His true age couldn’t be calculated accurately at this point.

He survived numerous events and wars, witnessing the changes of the world and The People’s tenacity.

“You’re right, no one lives forever. Dying in battle isn’t a bad way to go at all.” Luminous laughed and said.

“Emperors of The People shall never beg for mercy from Celestial Court.” Six-finger and the others mentally prepared themselves.

“Gentlemen, if all of you harbor such grand aspirations, we shall indulge you.” War Ancient God said: “It’s a shame you won’t be able to see Celestial Court’s dominion over the six continents in the future.”

“Hahaha, nonsense, if it were possible, it would have done so long ago.” Immortal Emperor Yao Guang laughed.

“It does not have a chance as long as The People are still around.” Luminous shook his head.

“I’m afraid you two don’t understand.” War said: “Times are changing, now is the era of Celestial Court. Immortal Dao City is closed and Imperial Field can’t amount to much alone. Their emperors have disappeared among the river of time, who will stop us now?”

Luminous and the others exchanged glances, finding it hard to refute this argument.

No one understood why Immortal Dao City was closed off from the rest of the world. If this continued in the future, The People would lose its strongest support.

As for Imperial Field, it had been silent after the last great war as well. Although most still believed that their strongest members were still around, there were too many questions left unanswered.

“The rise of Celestial Court will open a new world and an entirely new epoch. All living beings will be subjects of Celestial Court henceforth, its light will be eternal.” War said matter-of-factly.

This was not a passionate speech filled with romantic ideologies. He seemed to truly believe this.

Listeners were stirred by his delivery. Has Celestial Court recuperated enough to start a new war?

“The next epoch shall be Celestial Court’s, its momentum cannot be stopped. The only choice is to submit. Gentlemen, rethink your decision.” War continued.

“What’s going on here? Celestial Court became a den for deceivers and swindlers? It thinks it can turn a new page and start a new epoch? Dogs grow more courageous each passing day.” A person walked out of Momentous Frontier and said leisurely.

“Dao Brother!” Luminous and the others were ecstatic to see him.

“Who are you?! Nothing but an ant beneath the might of Celestial Court.” Sanctity Conqueror glared at Li Qiye and shouted.

“I can already see Celestial Court beneath the sole of my foot.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Such impudence, let’s see what you can do then!” Sanctity unleashed a palm strike.

“Boom!” A sacred palm with a holy affinity and countless imperial laws descended, crushing everything in its path.

“Scram.” Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye and waved his hand, easily pulverizing the sacred palm.

“Crack!” Blood and flesh splashed everywhere as the conqueror’s head exploded.

“Ahh!” He was sent flying through one peak after another, eventually forming a crater on the landing zone.

He barely made it back to the surface and dropped to the ground, on the verge of death.

This left both sides breathless and astounded. Sanctity, albeit not unbeatable, was still a famous and dominating conqueror. Alas, just one hand wave pulverized his head.

“It’s you!” War finally recognized Li Qiye and staggered backward in fear.

He had lived longer than Immortal Emperor Yao Guang and as a member of the three races in the tenth continent, he was a part of the dark crow’s legendary exploits.

“Surprise?” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“You were gone from the mortal world. Rumor has it that you perished with the heaven.” War said.

“Has the heaven perished?” Li Qiye pointed upward.

Celestial Court had been searching for the dark crow after the war during the previous epoch. They never stopped, not during the grand calamity or all the subsequent wars.

The elusive dark crow was nowhere to be found when even the most mysterious Purewood Divine Emperor finally showed up.

Those aware of the dark crow’s existence thought that he was gone at last - either destroyed during the great calamity or was in an unreachable world… Thus, Celestial Court stopped the search.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

Now, War had the displeasure of meeting the familiar figure whom Celestial Court despised and feared the most, always wishing for his demise.

“Who is he?” Younger conquerors and dragon lords weren’t exposed to the legends of the dark crow. After all, he was a taboo figure from the previous epoch.

“The legend himself.” Immortal Emperor Yao Guang murmured.

His era was filled with the dark crow’s exploits. The whispers only stopped after the new epoch.

Now, the legend was back in their world.

“Back again…” War murmured - this was a terrible development for Celestial Court.

Previously, the dark crow had brought nothing but trouble for Celestial Court. Was this going to be a repeat?

“Indeed, it seems that I am back.” Li Qiye touched his nose and smirked.
