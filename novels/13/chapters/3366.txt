“Junior, come accept your death!” The demon king looked down at Li Qiye as if he was untouchable.

“A bit interesting.” Li Qiye smiled and raised his hand.

“Buzz.” Life force immediately oozed out from his palm like the return of spring.

The land became filled with billowing life force. The flowers and grass had a verdant glow. All of Divine Black turned into an ocean of blue and green.

“What is this?” The disciples took a deep breath and felt an immense life force entering their lungs.

“Pop!” A bud drilled out of the mud beneath him and immediately grew into a tree. Branches and leaves came next.

The endless life force seemed to be coming from this tiny tree, enough to spread all over Eight Desolaces. The sheer amount was simply unfathomable.

It continued to grow more and more, becoming a sky-blotting tree in no time at all. It looked like an umbrella covering Li Qiye.

The leaves and branches poured down green particles, turning Li Qiye into the messenger of life. He became the harbinger of hope and possibilities.

The disciples watched this magical development in awe; their eyes wide open with disbelief.

“Another of the Nine Primeval Laws, Immortal Cassia.” The bodhi king said with admiration.

This was his main focus in the nine laws. He had trained it for more than a thousand years but Li Qiye had such an easy time.

The cassia tree came out of the mud and manifested into physical reality. This was something he couldn’t do.

“Die!” The demon king roared and crossed his hands together before forming a mudra by moving his fingers: “World Devouring Tiger!”

“Raa!” The divine tiger emerged and heralded darkness, opening its jaw. It seemed eager to devour everything.

The sun and moon lost their light. Even space itself started decaying. Why? Because in this split second, the tiger god was devouring spirit energy, essences, and life.

Meanwhile, the cassia tree still continued to grow upward, moving straight for the tiger god.

“Rumble!” The devouring tiger seemed unstoppable. Numerous branches broke down right away. The verdant branches and leaves filled with life immediately withered after being touched.

It wouldn’t be long until the entire tree went down at this rate.

Everyone took a deep breath. This power was too powerful. Maybe only Ping Suoweng could stop this move.

The elders trembled as well, thinking that the demon king might really be a match for the sect master.

A second after the initial destruction, the cassia’s green radiance erupted. The tree seemed to be on fire but instead of flames, it was this green affinity.

The green affinity incinerated the sky like an unstoppable flood. It pierced through the devouring force of the tiger god. The tree continued to grow in size and was bigger than all of Divine Black now. It was strong enough to stop the devouring technique of the demon king.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye has been standing leisurely beneath the tree as if he wasn’t a part of this battle, only here to sightsee. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The spectators had no words for this. Could there be an easier battle?

“Why is this a thing?” The disciples couldn’t fathom how Li Qiye had all of these abilities.

“Break!” The demon king saw that the devouring force wasn’t enough to stop the storm of green energy. He grabbed his cauldron and roared: “Myriad Beasts’ Arrival!”

“Boom!” A white tiger emerged from the cauldron. It opened its mouth and roared, breaking space and establishing a dao portal.

“Rumble!” Countless beasts came out of the portal in no time at all.

True dragons, phoenixes, Black Tortoises, Kui... They soared forward in an unstoppable manner, crushing space in the process.

Their frightening aura struck the crowd and made them frozen with fear.

“Mama...” So many disciples dropped down on their butt, unable to get up.

“Are they real?” Some turned pale due to the sheer number of divine beasts.

“The strongest move of that cauldron.” The bodhi king said with a serious expression.

The target of the beasts was the Immortal Cassia. The great tree had a hard time against so many beasts.

The branches were being crushed and stomped, resulting in numerous broken sections.

Finally, the only thing left was its body around thirty feet high. It exuded a green light, still protecting Li Qiye.

“Boom! Boom!” The beasts surrounded Li Qiye, wanting to turn him into a meat paste.

“He’s done.” A frightened disciple murmured. No one could stop the waves of divine beasts.

“Clank!” A sword hymn suddenly came from South Conch Peak. All the other swords nearby released a hymn in response as well.

The disciples noticed their own sword shaking, seemingly wanting to answer a summon.

“What’s going on this time?” They immediately grabbed the hilt since these swords felt eager to fly away.
