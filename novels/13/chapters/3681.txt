Chapter 3682: All Involved Parties Are Here

Zhang Yunzhi’s appearance was surprising to the crowd, not his aggression.

They understood why he wanted to kill Li Qiye. The previous event was just too humiliating, being forced to strip in public. That was definitely the most disgraceful moment in his life. That’s why he wanted nothing more than to cut Li Qiye to pieces. This hatred ran bone-deep.

Thus, some members of the crowd were ready to watch the show, ready to gloat on the losing side.

“Oh? Aren’t you the classmate with the stripping fetish?” Li Qiye smirked in response to the aggressive glare.

Some couldn’t help but burst out in laughter since they had a first-hand experience with it. They thought that this was unsuitable and had to stop, resulting in an awkward expression.

“You!” Zhang Yunzhi turned red with rage and embarrassment; his teeth chattered loudly. At this bone, “bone-deep” wasn’t enough to describe his enmity. He would pay any price to have revenge.

“Li! I swear that I will cut you to pieces today or I’ll cease to be a human!” He bellowed.

Everyone could hear the rage embedded in his voice and chattering teeth.

“I’m waiting.” Li Qiye casually waved his hand.

“You’re not leaving this place today. It doesn’t matter who your backer is, no one can save you.” Li Xiangquan chillingly added.

His feud with Li Qiye was far from being as serious as Zhang Yunzhi’s. Nonetheless, he clearly wanted to kill Li Qiye.

“The Li and the Zhang are working together?” Some were surprised at this unlikely alliance.

“It’s just temporary to deal with Li Qiye.” An older cultivator replied.

Zhang Yunzhi and Li Xiangquan were both students of Duality and part of the five heroes. They grew up in Metropolis and have known each other since their youth. However, they were certainly not friends.

They didn’t have notable conflicts back at the academy but certainly disagreed on many issues.

After all, their two clans have been competing all this time. Both were ancient clans of the holy ground and have served Vajra for generations.

The Zhang had considerable influence over the civil court while the Li had the military under control. To a certain extent, these two clans could decide the direction of Vajra.

Though they both worked for Vajra, they never stopped competing for political influence. This was the same case for their young generation.

Today, this became a rare moment since they considered Li Qiye a thorn on their side. Thus, it became imperative to work together and take his dog head.

“I’ve heard this so many times yet I’m still standing here while nothing is left of them but bones.” Li Qiye lazily said.

“You can drop that idea today.” Zhang Yunzhi threatened: “It doesn’t matter how many ace cards you have up your sleeves, you’re not leaving this place.”

“Your head is mine!” Li Xiangquan showed his determination.

This new alliance caused the crowd to ponder.

“Li Qiye is in trouble this time.” A youth gloated and laughed: “He definitely has a chance of leaving this place but it won’t be easy for him afterward after offending both the Li and the Zhang. This is akin to offending the dynasty. He’ll need to live with his tail tucked between his legs or like a fleeing rat. He’ll have to hide forever in his shell.”

“The brat is really playing with fire this time.” An older expert nodded in agreement.

These comments were reasonable. The two clans were as strong as individual countries and sects. Their influence could be seen all over the holy ground, not just limited to Vajra.

“We’ll see about that.” Someone disagreed: “He had killed so many people with his trickeries before back in the mountain range. Isn’t he still perfectly fine right now?”

“That’s true.” Others voiced their agreement. Li Qiye had plenty of enemies for what he had done yet he was still alive right now.

“Just watch, we’ll find out soon enough.” A member of the last generation remained patient.

At this point, the duo had a hard time holding back from attacking Li Qiye.

“Let’s get started.” Li Qiye smiled at his foes and said: “One at a time or together?”

They naturally didn’t appreciate the disdain shown. As for the crowd, some were surprised; the students from Duality became offended.

Li Xiangquan and Zhang Yunzhi were two of the top students at the academy. So, to a certain extent, they represented the power of the student body.

That’s why if Li Qiye looked down on these two, he was looking down on all students from Duality.

“This Li Qiye is too arrogant, does he not see how powerful the two seniors are?” One student angrily said: “How is he going to take on both of them at the same time?!”

“Let him try, he’ll find that he’s messing with the wrong people soon enough.” Another student snorted: “He must think that he’s invincible.”

“Senior Brother Li, teach him a lesson!” Because of this, certain students started shouting.

“Senior Brother Zhang, cut off his dog head and show everyone our academy’s prestige!”

The neutral spectators didn’t have such a strong reaction. They only frowned after hearing his challenge.

“Can he do this? There’s a big realm difference. Zhang Yunzhi and Li Xiangquan should be in the myriad-form realm. Li Qiye should be an Enlightened Being. Hell, even if he’s in the samadhi realm, he still has no chance.” An older expert analyzed.

“I still believe in Li Qiye. The things happening around him are too strange, he might have a heaven-defying means to change the tides.” An elder shook his head.

One big shot pondered for a bit before replying: “Well, he has a chance if it’s one-on-one. But in this scenario? Those kids are no slouches. They’re the future successor of their clan.”

Everyone started debating with different opinions. Most thought that Li Qiye was overestimating himself by suggesting a one-on-two scenario.

Zhang Yunzhi and Li Xiangquan were famous prodigies; their fame wasn’t empty.

“Do you really think you can defeat the two of us?” Zhang Yunzhi’s eyes were fierce. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Obviously.” Li Qiye stretched and said: “Forget it, just come together to save time.”
