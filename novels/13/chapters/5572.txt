Chapter 5573: Blood-stained Immortal Weapon

“Bam!” The group finally made it to the bottom after an unknown length of time due to its height.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

They found themselves in an independent domain - an empty void with floating continents. The one they landed on wasn’t that large in size.

A particular weapon in the distance commanded their attention. It didn’t look conspicuous like something capable of slaying immortals.

It lacked radiance and dao laws. The chilling slashes they had seen previously weren’t present either. It looked more like a toy from a child - a throwing star that would return to the thrower.

It floated in space with one side pointed down and two up, looking like a still image. Upon closer inspection, it had rust spots and even tiny cracks everywhere. It gave the impression that a slight touch might cause it to break down.

After spending more time looking at it, one would find that it wasn’t rust on the weapon but rather, blood. Since so much time had passed, the dried blood had a darkened shade.

There was actually a half-drop of blood hanging on one end of the throwing star. It hadn’t dried up completely; part of it still had a relatively fresh color.

This reminded Baifeng and Niu Fen of the blood drop Li Qiye had refined not long ago. They clearly shared the same source.

An unknown power seemed to be illuminating it - a gestation process to revert the drying process.

“Momentous Dao.” Niu Fen murmured, realizing that the blood was regaining freshness due to Momentous Dao.

This dao had been nourishing all the dried blood on the weapon. After who knows how long, the half-drop of blood was the result. With ample time, it would be liquified enough to drip off the weapon.

Perhaps this was the origin of the first drop of blood. It fell from the weapon and entered Momentous Dao.

The violent gusts came from the cracks of the weapon - mere remnant strands of its power. When the strands came in contact with dried blood, it would assume a gray color.

Despite the vastness of this area, Niu Fen and Baifeng felt as if the triangular weapon’s elusive aura had filled it up entirely.

Niu Fen took a deep breath, realizing that he couldn’t grasp and control it. If he were to try, it would instantly decapitate him without any difficulty.

It noticed Li Qiye’s presence and woke up immediately.

“Buzz.” It released rays that could cut down three thousand worlds despite their current feebleness, invoking a scream out of Baifeng.

Li Qiye blocked the rays and saved everyone from being decapitated.

“Buzz.” In theory, the weapon should kill uninvited visitors, akin to a dragon being awakened in its lair. Its first reaction should be to devour the intruders.

In this case, the weapon wanted to run right away after seeing Li Qiye, wanting to reach a secret domain.

Alas, Li Qiye reacted faster with a hand reach capable of reversing time. Nothing in this world could keep up with him. Billions of years flowed backward as he caught the fleeing star.

“Boom!” It erupted in a blinding manner, scaring the soul out of Niu Fen and Baifeng.
