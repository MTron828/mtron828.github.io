Chapter 5910: Won’t Meet Again

“The highest probability is still Heavenrealm. It is the path that must be walked before fighting the heaven.” The pleasant voice said.

“Yes, the final battle requires entering Heavenrealm.” Li Qiye said.

“You could wait for him there.” The deep voice said.

“He’s most likely already waiting for you.” The eye added.

“I hope so, that removes a lot of the difficulties.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hibernation is problematic in and of itself.” The pleasant voice said: “Will you hibernate too?”

“I appreciate you hitting all the key topics.” Li Qiye responded.

“What if he doesn’t need to? As I’ve said, just focus on the heavenly path, he is either waiting there or is one step ahead.” The deep voice said.

“You three have lived long enough.” Li Qiye suddenly changed the topic.

They exchanged glances and understood his point.

“It was long overdue for us to take action.” The eye said.

“Why didn’t you do it?” Li Qiye asked again.

“We didn’t have absolute confidence because there was only one chance. Losing? That’s the end of it all.” The pleasant voice said. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Yes, it’s not certain that one can rise again after defeat.” Li Qiye smiled.

“What is his probability of success?” The deep voice asked.

“Hard to say, based on the previous impression, low. But such a long time has passed and he might have changed completely.” The eye said.

“Not more than eighty or he would have tried already.” The deep voice said.

“Not intervening is another option, but is that the right move?” Li Qiye smiled: “This is the problem with having such a good background, it becomes a hindrance and causes stagnation.”

“Not necessarily.” The deep voice didn’t appreciate the criticism.

“If it weren’t for this, you three wouldn’t be here. I, with my humble background, am ready to roll in the mud.” Li Qiye said.

“It’s because we’re old. We have the will, not the strength.” The eye sighed in response.

“Fine, then enjoy your retirement, there’s nothing wrong with living out the rest of your natural life in peace.” Li Qiye said.

“You just need to kill the brat.” The deep voice said.

“The request shall be carried out, it won’t be difficult.” Li Qiye smiled: “Although it won’t feel as good as personally doing it, at least your wish will be fulfilled.”

“Do it, there is no need to keep him around.” The eye said.

“Yes.” The pleasant voice gave permission.

The deep voice scowled as if still unwilling to accept this development. Nevertheless, he consented: “Doesn’t matter whether his corpse is intact or not, just eliminate him.”

“I can only imagine the effort put in to nurture him.” Li Qiye could sense their emotion and imagine their ugly expression.

“Knowing that it’s a taboo yet still doing it, the only time when you three actually cared about someone in these endless years.” Li Qiye continued.

“No need to dwell on the past.” The eye said.

They, supreme terrors, became emotionless with time and power. Nevertheless, feelings returned after finding a capable successor. What should have ended as a beautiful tale became their downfall.

They became exposed and had no choice but to leave Three Immortals World. Their rage and losses couldn’t be described in words.

“It’s a shame we cannot help you in the future, given our current state.” The eye said.

“Just live well, it’s not a bad end, not falling into the darkness or being killed after reaching the apex. Can’t ask for more in life, it’s perfect.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You sure know how to comfort people.” The eye couldn’t help but smile wryly: “As if we have another choice outside of this perfect life.”

“Well, can you come up with a better alternative?” Li Qiye asked.

“I suppose that’s true. When the time comes, whether it be us or the others, or even the villainous heaven, we should accept it. Living for too long will only turn us to calamities.” The eye nodded.

“I should start planning my retirement years and death too, so that I don’t end up becoming one of the calamities you mentioned.” Li Qiye joked.

“Just don’t become the type you hate.” The eye said.

“I’ve been all types of people in the past, but it won’t be easy for me to turn into the type I hate.” Li Qiye said.

“We owe you one this time.” The deep voice said.

“Too early to say that since I haven’t even begun.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You can definitely get it done.” The pleasant voice said without any hesitation.

“Of course.” Li Qiye nodded.

“The problem is that we won’t be able to repay the favor since you won’t be returning.” The eye said.

“He doesn’t need us to.” The pleasant voice said.

“Well, what do you want us to do? We don’t like owing favors.” The deep voice said.

“Your old bones will break if you have to move just a little bit, just enjoy your retirement.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Let it be as you say then.” The eye understood.

“Goodbye, old bones.” Li Qiye stared at them and said.

“Goodbye, I’m afraid we won’t meet again.” The eye sighed.

“Perhaps.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Go on your way and fight to the end, may you fulfill your pursuit.” The pleasant voice wished the best for Li Qiye.

“My fight will put an end to all of this.” Li Qiye smiled and turned to leave.

“Brat! Your place shall be above the high heaven.” As he was leaving, the deep voice also bid farewell.
