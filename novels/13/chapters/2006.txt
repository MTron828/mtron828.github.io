On the next days, Li Qiye didn’t teach the group anything. In his opinion, a teacher’s job was to show the students the way and they needed to do the rest themselves.

Outside of training himself, he spent more time focusing on Samsara’s bag of skin. He carefully analyzed it while checking it with the other summit.

The skin’s purpose was very simple - a defense capable of stopping the strongest assault in the world. Alas, this wasn’t Li Qiye’s goal.

He wanted to link the skin with that summit in order to find a clue and open a new portal to a world that does not exist! It was a place unreachable even for the twelve-will emperors. He needed to find it because he required certain things there.

This has been a thorn in his heart for a long time now. He spent generations without finding any breakthrough until now. This skin was a way for him to find the portal.

After numerous speculations, he finally found the connection between the summit and the skin.

“Buzz.” He laid out the skin and it emitted a faint luster. This glow was special; one would be hard pressed to see a similar radiance in this world.

It looked like an immortal glow from a jade, extremely wondrous. Anyone would be attracted instantly with their soul wavering into ascension.

It was truly too beautiful as it flowed across the surface of the skin just like runes or blood vessels. Li Qiye held his breath since he was also affected by its splendor. Moreover, he memorized the lines because of the secret hidden within.

After a long time, all of the flowing lines have emerged on the skin. They suddenly came together to form a figure.

This figure was too faint and unrecognizable. Who knows if this was a man or a woman. It was only the size of a fist but its appearance made the skin as vast as a world. This figure was only one of the living beings there.

Li Qiye’s eyes became profound and seemingly traveling on the river of time across the epochs.

Finally, he stopped at one epoch. In this split second, he was able to see this figure’s real form.

The figure on the skin suddenly woke up and looked back at Li Qiye. Their gazes were not limited by temporal restraints so they stared at each other.

Alas, the figure moved on towards a faraway place. Li Qiye focused on remembering each step. He was experiencing the fortune of a lifetime.

Eventually, the figure finished its path and became tired. It has been walking for too long and too far to reach the deeps of this world. It was time to rest now.

Because of this, the light became to disperse, same with the figure, until everything went away.

The skin became the same again as if nothing had happened.

“So it’s like that, I see!” Li Qiye clapped and burst out in laughter.

He looked up and saw the sunny rays before smiling. Everything became so beautiful in his eyes now: “In this generation, people have asked me how confident I am about the incoming battle? Ask me again today and I shall answer, I will escape unscathed regardless of how tough it will be in the future.”

Next, Li Qiye came out of the room and saw the three students waiting outside.

“Teacher.” All bowed respectfully, even the hidden master - Liu Jinsheng.

“Is something the matter?” He glanced at them and asked.

They exchanged glances. Minxue was afraid so she lowered her head while Goldloop was only smiling. Jinsheng had to be the one speaking up.

“The semester has just started and there is a tea party at the Literature Citadel. We also want to join the fun, please give us permission, Teacher.” Jinsheng inquired.

“Calmness can’t last for long.” Li Qiye chuckled: “Very well, cultivation and learning aren’t always done behind closed doors. It’s fine to take a trip outside, plus, I’m free anyway so I’ll go with you three.”

“Really?!” Xinxue excitedly looked up and shouted but she felt that this was strange so she quickly lowered her head again.

“Let’s go, it’ll be good. Let’s show those geniuses from Emperor Mansion and Sacred Institution that we from Study Room aren’t just bookworms.” Li Qiye declared.

“Those two classrooms have countless geniuses. The most famous three among them should be much stronger than old students like us.” Goldloop scratched his head and said. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Xinxue, on the other hand, wasn’t thinking too much. She only wanted to go out and have fun.

“Just geniuses, can’t reach the apex. You just need to work hard and you’ll surpass those geniuses one day. They’re not the only unbeatable ones in history.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

Of course, he was aiming this message at Xinxue and Goldloop. One was his student while the other was a descendant of a friend so Li Qiye wanted to take care of them.

Jinsheng was not like these two. He was already extremely powerful so those geniuses would be better off not provoking him.

Xinxue didn’t say anything but she kept his words in mind. She always enjoyed memorizing and basking in his comments. They were as precious as gold to her.

Goldloop only laughed while rubbing his head.

“Let’s go, I also want to see some people.” Li Qiye told the group.

In this vast academy were many grottos and individual schools taking up massive space. There were also multiple old cities.

Literature was one of these cities. It was located in the center of the five classrooms so there were always students hanging out.

Before reaching this city, one could see two gigantic statues by the entrance. When people got closer, they would find that the statues were unreasonably large.

They felt like ants and there was no way of seeing the head of the statues since it was surrounded by clouds. The statues looked like guardians protecting Literature.

Upon careful inspection, one would find that one statue was male and the other female. The man was heroic and powerful while the woman beautiful. The former propped his hands on a saber while the latter had a divine sword, ready to defend Literature whenever.

They didn’t look to be expertly crafted but there was an aura surpassing the ages. No one dared to act arrogance before them.

“So large, who are they?” Goldloop murmured: “Are these the ancestors of the academy?”

Li Qiye gave them a quick glance and said: “They’re Yang Zhenwei and Guo Xinyue.”

“Who?” Goldloop has never heard of these two names: “Which seniors are they?”

Xinxue who was versed in this subject responded: “They are Harmony Immortal Monarchs, the only husband-and-wife pairing among the emperors. These two graduated from our academy.”
