Chapter 4831: Invincible Slash

The cycles of an epoch were unleashed upon Li Qiye, intending on sealing him.

“Boom!” In the next moment, the abyssal lord gathered all the waters in the world and condensed it into a single brick, sending it straight at the enemy.

This brick contained an immeasurable amount of weight despite its size. Within the brick were countless stars and living beings - the might of an entire epoch.

Both time and space were buried by its weight along with the myriad laws. The abysmal lord wasn’t happy with just this and rushed for Li Qiye as well, wanting to devour him.

His abyssal form was immense and had an all-trapping ability. Those caught would never be able to see sunlight again.

This single offense contained three separate points of attack. The abyssal lord showed why he was able to dominate a whole epoch.

Li Qiye narrowed his eyes after seeing this. He sent out two grand dao swords but in reality, they were one - Flamedao.

Flame represented the fire affinity while the dao counterpart represented extreme cold. Two extremities together made this dao exceptional.

“Zzz…” The latter instantly froze everything - even the laws that made up the world. This included the epoch cycles, water brick, and even the abyss. The smallest particles became immobilized as a result.

Next came the fire affinity reaching the limit of heat. This grand dao could burn everything down, even the sun above. The instantaneous rotation between cold and heat made survival an impossibility.

The abysmal lord’s attack was swiftly repelled but Li Qiye had to worry about Dead Immortal. The latter sent all nine swords to attack him at the same time.

Terra possessed insurmountable weight and immensity, capable of true devastation.

Abyss knew nothing of limits and could swallow three thousand worlds.

Vastsea, as boundless as can be. The slash was neverending in intensity…

The combination of all nine swords stirred spectators in disbelief. The other overlords thought that Dead Immortal has somehow duplicated the techniques successfully. This dao didn’t belong to Dead Immortal yet the result could deter them.

“Clank!” Li Qiye raised Terra into the air and combined it with the equivalent sword dao. This single majestic technique was enough to protect the ages.

“Rumble!” All nine slashes from Dead Immortal were stopped by Li Qiye’s Terra alone.

In the end, Dead Immortal’s attack was impressive but it still didn’t possess the actual treasure and scripture, only relying on a secret technique from its epoch.

“Boom!” The immovable Terra continued onward for a slash after the successful parry.

“Rumble!” Dead Immortal defended with its nine swords and dao but one crumbled after another.

All three overlords suffered serious damage after a loud explosion.

Undying Lord became Hallowed’s victim. His armor was cut through along with his body nearly being severed.

Lord of the Deeps couldn’t withstand the change in temperature. Half of his skull was gone and his body writhed in pain. It appeared smooth after the shifts.

Dead Immortal’s lightning bolts have been extinguished. Its body was capable of transforming into anything but now, it was flattened like a piece of paper.

The three overlords together couldn’t kill Li Qiye and suffered grievous damage.

Li Qiye had the advantage of being the current epoch lord. The flow of time was on his side, hence his domination. Other overlords were mere guests at an unfamiliar playground. Moreover, Li Qiye was also in his prime. The same couldn’t be said about the rest.

Spectating overlords shuddered in horror. If Li Qiye wanted to deal with them, then they would need to abandon everything and hide. This included sealing their thoughts and powers. Otherwise, he would be able to find them eventually.Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

They regretted waking up during this commotion. Slumbering would have been the right choice because that would have kept their location a secret.

Unfortunately, they couldn’t contain their greed and decided to join the fun. Now, it was too late to run because they were most likely detected by him.

The three combatants turned pale and thought that they have still underestimated Li Qiye.

They have fought other epochs before. Although they couldn’t destroy all of them, they could still come out unscathed or with a considerable harvest.

Now, regardless of their opinion on the matter, they realized that it was time to flee. Their speed was unimaginable, crossing through one chaotic dimension after another which made tracing rather difficult.

Unfortunately, Triune Immortal and the others instantly sealed their location and prevented them from performing another dimensional shift.

They became trapped like birds in a cage.

“Leaving so soon? I don’t think so.” Li Qiye smiled.

The three’s expression soured. Undying Lord stared at Silly Da and said: “Brother Da, what are you waiting for?”

Alas, Silly Da still lay on the ground, seemingly asleep.
