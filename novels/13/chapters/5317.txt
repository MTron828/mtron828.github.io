Chapter 5318: Hot Blood, Wild Heart

Peacock Dao Lord came from Eight Desolaces - a heaven-defying dao lord who was rumored to have a divine bloodline.

In reality, he wasn’t a peacock or anything like that. Some believed that he was the reincarnation of a tree ancestor. Of course, this concept wasn’t widely accepted so others said that he was only a descendant of a tree ancestor.

Regardless of his background, he eventually became a powerful dao lord. Today, he resembled a wild bird more than anything - choosing to hunt other creatures.

His original form was an old man in a feathery robe with a beastly yet sanctified aura - the king of all birds. It was not surprising for others to think that he possesses a divine bloodline.

Meanwhile, he couldn’t believe that he was beaten down by a single smack. In the six continents, he didn’t need to join any alliance or pick a side between The Race and the People.

He roamed the world freely and no one dared to provoke him. Those who could beat him included apex cultivators such as All-things and Swordsea. However, they couldn’t smack him down from the sky that easily.

He felt like an ant during that battle. When he looked up to take a good look at the assailant, he couldn’t believe his own eyes.

He prostrated on the ground and said respectfully: “I deserve death for not knowing of your arrival and disrespecting you, Sir.”

He kowtowed repeatedly afterward.

“You know me?” Li Qiye asked.

“Sir, you may not recognize a junior like me but during the nine worlds epoch, you once saved our lineage. Peacock Forest remembers your kindness and virtue, we are eternally grateful.” He elaborated.

“Oh? It’s all in the past.” Li Qiye chuckled.

After finishing a full rite of kowtow, the dao lord finally stood up.

“Dao Lord, why are you hunting beasts here?” Li Zhitian asked.

The dao lord waved his hand and the tiger-like creatures finally ran back to the plain. They seemed happy, no longer remembering the fate of their unlucky friends.

“When I met these little tigers, they were on the verge of extinction. I dug out a fire vein and built a nest so that they can repopulate. When I’m a little hungry, I eat a few or so, just an occasional indulgence.” The dao lord responded.

Li Zhitian thought about it and didn’t have a big problem.

The dao lord took care of these “little tigers” and even granted them protection. Although he ate a thousand or so in one bite, this didn’t mean much to the overall population. They would have been extinct without his help.

After thinking about it, it appeared that there wasn’t an actual issue. Nonetheless, Zhitian still felt that this wasn’t right.

Alas, this happened every day in the world. In fact, he wasn’t above this either. His clan cultivated alchemy materials for refinement and he ate the pills. This was fundamentally the same as what the dao lord did.

“Fellow Daoist, you have a compassionate heart.” Peacock Dao Lord smiled and said: “You’re still young to have these feelings. This is just the way it is in the world.”

“I apologize if I acted pretentiously.” Zhitian shook his head and smiled wryly. He realized that his own moral high ground was limited. His actions and the clan’s conducts weren’t much nobler at all.

“It’s fine, I was the same way during my youth. In fact, this is a virtue of the young, filled with fervor and still holding onto a sense of justice toward the affairs of heaven and earth.” The dao lord said.

“We live alongside heaven and earth. Although our innocent hearts are tempered by time, there are things to not be forgotten. One should never willingly descend into degradation with the excuse of numbness or just following the natural order.” Li Qiye chuckled and said.

“I shall engrave your advice to my heart, Sir.” Peacock Dao Lord bowed again.

“You both are speaking the truth. I’ve been thinking too highly of myself, acting so self-righteous.” Zhitian said.

“Stay this way for as long as you can. I was even more reckless and less inclined to self-reflect. I always charged ahead without thinking twice. Whenever I think back now, I realize how many foolish things I’ve done but I have no regrets. Youth is wonderful, hot blood and wild heart.” The dao lord said.

“Hot blood, wild heart.” Zhitian murmured.

“Today, everything under the heaven operates under laws and cycles, cause and effect. I didn’t accept this when I was younger and only listened to my heart. It will come with time.” The dao lord said sentimentally.

“Thank you for your guidance, Dao Lord.” Zhitian said.

Although they weren’t from the same side, Peacock still conversed normally with him and gave him insight into the dao.

The dao lord then cupped his fist toward the old servant and said: “It has been a long time since our last meeting. Your brilliant presence remains, Dao Brother.”

“Old now.” The old servant returned the gesture.

Zhitian was surprised to see this. Although he had some guesses about the old servant’s identity, he didn’t know the exact answer.

The dao lord, on the other hand, recognized him right away. It appeared the dao lord was actually stronger than expected.

“Sir, how can I be of service?” The dao lord bowed toward Li Qiye.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“I am here for primal darkness, just looking for it right now.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Primal darkness?” This was the dao lord’s first time hearing this title.

“There are statues in Evil Reborn, Heaven’s Allure’s statues, to be exact. There is one in the magma beneath the lair that you built, did you know about it?” Li Qiye didn’t elaborate.

“Heaven’s Allure? Statues of her here?” The dao lord was surprised.

“No idea why.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“How strange. Her beauty is peerless, enough to sway the souls.” The dao lord chuckled.

“You’ve seen her before, Dao Lord?” Zhitian asked.

“Yes, but fortunately, I’ve heard of her reputation and protected my mind before the meeting or I would have fallen. So many people in this world, confident and in their ability and power, think that they can resist. How wrong they are.” The dao lord said.

“I see.” Zhitian could tell that Peacock Dao Lord was immensely powerful yet he was still afraid of Heaven’s Allure?
