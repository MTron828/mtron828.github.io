Chapter 5721: Broken

“Boom!” Crimson vectors replaced ion-blue ones and boiled the ocean with their scorching heat.

“They’re burning true blood now.” Spectators became emotional after seeing the apex cultivators extracting every drop of power.

Imperial-level characters’ longevity was due to their plentiful true blood. This blood continuously replenished their lifespan to delay aging.

Thus, burning the true blood equated to being tired of living. Of course, Resolute and the others no longer gave a damn, preferring to give this a shot instead.

They couldn’t give up despite knowing the might of an overlord and wanted to show Li Qiye their unbending fangs.

The vectors surrounded and burned Li Qiye’s surroundings, turning space into glass. The change happened too quickly for the naked eye to perceive.

The suppressive pressure engulfed the battlefield, forcing even emperors down to the ground.

“Boom!” One machine appeared after another in the refined zone, shocking the spectators.

The temporal loop appeared again but on a larger scale, drowning out Li Qiye. One machine came from the past, another from the future. One was made of karma, another from the reincarnation cycle...

A total of nine machines appeared and released the same crimson vectors, burning through the river of time. This disrupted the regular timeline, cutting off the past and the future.

With them disconnected, memories and hope fell into a pit of despair. This pit was the only thing that could keep Li Qiye contained.

Even if he possessed an indestructible body, the special refinement would wear him down with time.

“How terrifying.” The domain of despair caused spectators to bellow in horror as if they were the ones subjected to the torment. Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Break!” Li Qiye chanted a mantra, causing his primordial light to erupt with enough force to return an epoch to the origin.

“Boom!” This easily shattered the domain of despair along with the nine machines. Hope and light returned to the battlefield.

The machine in the present couldn’t handle the mantric eruption either and was obliterated.

“Rumble!” The members making up the formation arrays were sent flying and smashed the seabed, staining it with their blood. Their body broke down like eggs hitting the ground, pulverized beyond recognition.

The crowd had no idea that this wasn’t Li Qiye’s full power. If he were to display his actual strength, it would blow their mind.

“Boom!” A majestic figure appeared deep in space and controlled the heavenly beams.

They descended and instantly teleported Resolute, War, Zhuo Huo, and Fu Mo away, leaving behind Just-once, Nine-wheel, and Armament.

The latter three relied on their personal rays, wanting to escape back to Celestial Court.

“Bam!” Li Qiye raised his finger and destroyed the rays, preventing them from leaving.

“Not so equal, are you?” Li Qiye smirked.

Spectators exchanged glances, wondering about the identity of the rescuer. It could have been Light-dragon or Heaven Burial Conqueror who borrowed the power of Celestial Court.

They couldn’t save the dao lords because lingering for a bit longer would result in death for all. The split-second decision made the distinction clear among Celestial Court’s members.

Resolute and War came from Celestial Court so they had priority. The emperors had joined since Immemorial Epoch War, proving themselves with meritorious feats in battle so they were next in line.

The dao lords, on the other hand, came from Eight Desolaces and joined later. Thus, they were abandoned.
