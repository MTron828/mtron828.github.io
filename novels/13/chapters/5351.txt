Chapter 5352: Innocence

“Buzz.” Li Qiye exited the dream realm. Although he didn’t forcefully leave, the dream itself receded like the tides.

As he had said, Dream Abyss might be unfathomable but it couldn’t accommodate his dreams. It wouldn’t be an issue of him being unable to wake up - the entire thing would collapse beforehand.

His dreams have surpassed the limits of Dream Abyss. Thus, he started falling naturally like a feather without using any movement merit law.

He wasn’t the only one capable of this simple descent. Top cultivators utilized their power and strong dao heart to wake up from their dreams.

The weaker cultivators, especially the juniors, continued to be engulfed by the dreams. They would need external help from their fellow sect members to regain their sanity.

“Ahhh!” Screams could be heard as some cultivators smashed the ground, only waking up at the very last second to let out one last cry.

“Bam!” Some dead victims were fortunate enough to not wake up at all - still drowning in their beautiful dreams before death. This wasn’t a bad end at all since they got to experience their desires without awareness of the grim reality.

As Li Qiye floated downward, he matched his speed with Xiao Hu and took a look at the youth.

At first, Xiao Hu had a smile on his face, clearly enjoying the beautiful dreams. Nonetheless, as the beloved disciple of a dao lord who trained him meticulously, he eventually realized that it was time to leave the dreams.

His expression became conflicted as he clenched his teeth; his body writhed back and forth. Alas, the dream didn’t want to let him go.

Beads of sweat formed on his forehead and his complexion became red. He looked as if he was shouldering a million mountains.

“Ahh!” Eventually, he didn’t let down his master and returned to reality.

“Am I still dreaming?” The youth still drenched in sweat stared at Li Qiye in disbelief.

“Congratulations, you have passed the trial and will have a bright future if you can keep this up.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Great, that’s great…” He was ecstatic to hear this. The struggle to wake up was far from easy - it felt as if he had crossed through an entire ocean and climbed countless peaks. One couldn’t imagine the pain without having experienced it.

During their descent, they saw more victims being pulverized from the fall and heard screams everywhere.

Once they landed, Li Qiye asked Xiao Hu: “What did you see in your dreams?”

Xiao Hu was embarrassed but still told the truth: “I saw a lot, like living numerous lifetimes. I followed my master and he managed to break through to find anima. Our journey was endless and we were so happy. I was with him when he became an immortal.”

“I see.” Li Qiye said.

“Well, I traveled a lot when I was younger to look for food but after I met Master, I’ve never left his side.” Xiao Hu said.

“Don’t you want to embark on a journey to become a conqueror?” Li Qiye asked.

“I’m content just being with Master.” Xiao Hu scratched his head and said.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

“Such childlike innocence is rare.” Li Qiye patted his shoulder and said: “But haven’t you thought about how your master will become stronger and you won’t be able to catch up? He can’t stop and wait for you forever, you’ll become a burden at that point.”

Xiao Hu froze since he hadn’t thought that deeply regarding the future. A light started flashing in his mind as he realized this predicament - being too weak compared to his master.

This had already happened since he was too weak to accompany his master in his quest to kill Supreme. His master worried about his well-being and entrusted him to Timewatcher Conqueror.

The enlightened youth took a deep breath and bowed toward Li Qiye: “Young Noble, thank you for letting me know what I must do. I will try my best to not hinder Master’s pace in the future.”

Li Qiye smiled approvingly and didn’t say anything else.

In fact, it would be amazing for him to be able to follow Hallowed Dao Lord. After all, although the latter wasn’t the strongest cultivator right now, he still had an illustrious past in Eight Desolaces.

The two made it to a large river that blocked everyone’s path. There was no end in sight, only fog and mist obscuring visibility.

The water surged violently and was turbid, looking like that of the yellow river. There seemed to be countless wailing specters being dragged by the currents toward the unknown. The wails naturally frightened first-timers.

Of course, some big shots didn’t worry because they were confident in their own abilities and flying treasures.
