Chapter 3848: Strange Image

Three Slashes was afraid of ominous signs despite wanting to see his future, hence his hesitation prior while everyone else tested their luck.

Nonetheless, he had no choice but to do it due to the circumstances. He took a deep breath and placed his hand on the crystal ball. It exuded crystallized rays that chase the chaos away.

The spectators were ready to see the signs and images in the crystal ball. This had serious implications on the future of their region as well as their own sect or clan.

“Buzz.” A saber hymn could be heard as sharp flashes emanated from the young lord. The saber flashes looked happy and harmonized with the hymn prior.

The crowd found this special because this didn’t happen before to anyone else. This wasn’t the end of it. Even the saber hanging by his waist started hymning as well, looking quite happy.

“Clank!” He himself issued the same hymn, resembling an unsheathed saber capable of splitting the sky apart.

His saber energy diffused across the area, freezing those nearby. They didn’t dare to move lest falling victim to the sharp energy slashes.

Some gasped and shouted: “Such a powerful saber energy.”

“Clank-” After a pronounced hymn, his flash became resplendent until he virtually disappeared, becoming one with the saber dao.

People saw an image of a heavenly saber slashing vertically, capable of severing the cycles of reality. Everyone was horrified to see this, the ancestors included.

No one knew what he was seeing in the crystal ball. Nonetheless, his grand dao has been activated. It seemed that the images must have been amazing - a testament to his future potential.

“This phenomenon is unmatched. Even his personal saber is resonating.” A youth exclaimed.

“That saber has an incredible background. It came from Black Tides, definitely an ancient weapon on the same level as a dao lord weapon.” Another nodded in agreement.

“Don’t tell me, Young Lord Biandu is the so-called heavenly genius?” One more took advantage of this to flatter Three Slashes.

The crowd exchanged glances as a result after hearing this. Initially, the purpose of the divination ceremony was to search for the heavenly genius. However, the Grand Seer changed his mind during.

All the youths here wanted to be the lucky one. They knew that the chance was slim but if it had to be someone from Black Wood, it should be none other than Three Slashes.

Others weren’t qualified because they were inferior compared to him. Plus, others wouldn’t be convinced anyway. Only Three Slashes fit the requirements.

“Young Lord Biandu is the very best in the holy ground, no, in all of West King. It has to be him.” A genius who has a good relationship with him immediately remarked.

“Absolutely. As if that Li guy would be the chosen one.” Others voiced their agreement.

The crowd could only see the visual manifestation on the young lord, not the images in the crystal ball. Nonetheless, the majority thought that he was the one. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Li Qiye or Young Lord Biandu? This was an easy choice for them, no need to think twice.

Three Slashes finally removed his palms from the crystal ball during heated discussions. The visual phenomena on him disappeared and a chaotic expanse returned to the crystal ball.

Everyone waited for him to tell them what he saw. From his expression, they could see excitement or even joy.

He took a deep breath and bowed towards the Grand Seer: “Senior, I saw the image of a divine saber descending from the heaven. It possessed a divinity that should be unbeatable in the entire world...”

“?!”

“A divine saber from above with an invincible divinity?!” The crowd clamored.

“The sign of a future dao lord?” Another youth said with admiration.

“That’s possible.” Someone from the last generation solemnly said: “Who else can see this image outside of a future dao lord?”

“Yes, only the saber of a dao lord would possess an unbeatable divinity.” Many sided with this opinion.

“Remember, his divine saber came from Black Tides, maybe the high heaven gifted it to him since he’s the chosen one.” A genius shouted.

“So he’s the one from the Grand Seer’s prophecy.” Many truly wanted this outcome.

“I have many questions regarding the celestial images, please guide me, Senior.” Three Slashes asked after the recollection.

Everyone waited for the Grand Seer’s answer. No one thought that Three Slashes was lying about what he saw.

Of course, they wanted to hear him being appointed as the heavenly genius or that he would become the future dao lord. This had happened before with Eight Stallion Dao Lord.

The members of the Biandu wanted this more than anyone. Having a dao lord in their clan would propel them to the next level. Perhaps they would be able to extend their reach into the holy ground and replace Sacred Mountain.

This was a lofty and virtually impossible goal. Nonetheless, ruling for several generations would be good enough.

Three Slashes himself nervously awaited the answer. He naturally wanted to hear the good news more than anyone else.

The Grand Seer rarely calculated for others. Having an auspicious prophecy from him would solidify Three Slashes’ future.

The Grand Seer’s expression remained indifferent. He glanced at Three Slashes and calmly said: “Sabers are dangerous weapons.”

He then closed his eyes and stopped caring about Three Slashes.
