Chapter 4106: He Came

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“The brat abandoned everything and ran for his life after finding out. As for me, I’m stuck in this crappy place and have no idea where he went.” The voice reminisced. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Seems unnecessary. Sure, his wealth was considered exceptional to regular people but it wouldn’t be able to attract one glance from that individual.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“As I’ve said, he had a guilty conscience. He inherited a few things that shouldn’t see daylight, that’s why he fled right away.” The voice chuckled.

Tang Ben had a special and mysterious background. His wealth was indeed exceptional too. That’s why he became one of the richest in Eight Desolaces despite being an outsider.

However, certain things about him were better forgotten and left hidden. Otherwise, he wouldn’t only be one of the richest in Eight Desolaces but rather, the richest of all time.

“It has been long enough for the past to be the past. Otherwise, he wouldn’t have been able to get away with it. The various issues would have been settled before the great battle in Three Immortals.” Li Qiye said.

He knew about Tang Ben’s past and background. It’s just that he didn’t care about it since it wasn’t any of his business.

“Three Immortals are no longer the same, that’s why the brat dragged me down here with him.” The voice said.

Despite not being as strong as its master, this greed intent was still a supreme being and knew many things.

“Then what about you? Why are you here?” Li Qiye smiled and asked.

Tang Ben’s persuasion was one thing but this supreme being naturally had other reasons for coming to Eight Desolaces.

“Hmm…” The voice smiled wryly before answering: “The new world has changed beyond recognition, so I decided to take advantage of the rare circumstances to take a look down here.”

Going from Three Immortals to Eight Desolaces was easier said than done. However, the destruction stemming from Li Qiye’s battle affected the various worlds.

He and Tang Ben took advantage of this and successfully descended. Of course, they still paid a heavy price.

“No longer the same, I see.” Li Qiye repeated and had a good guess about the changes.

“Sigh, as ephemeral as smoke. People and things have disappeared from Three Immortals. It’s a different place now.” The voice sentimentally said.

“It was inevitable.” Li Qiye calmly stated.

“Just too early.” The voice said.

“When then? Peace can’t last forever. No one can escape when the time comes.” Li Qiye paused for a bit and continued: “Some thought that they had made a choice and picked a side. They had no idea that it was meaningless since none had a chance of getting away.”

“Yes, all worlds will be subjected to this eventually.” The voice agreed.

“That’s why he came.” Li Qiye’s eyes suddenly turned profound.

“To be honest, he shouldn’t have.” The voice said.

“Why not?” Li Qiye asked.

“Since he had disappeared for a long time and never reacted to the big events, no one had an idea about his location. Why did he show up again?” The voice mused.

Few knew of this person’s existence. Those who did eventually lost track of his location and goals. All in all, he simply vanished.

This period of disappearance was unimaginably long. For example, the epoch known as the Nine Worlds was quite short in comparison.

Wondrous and shocking events happened during this period. However, he never showed up once. That’s why his sudden appearance back then caught people off guard.

“There’s certainly a reason, the right timing.” Li Qiye said.

“Can it be that he really became a true immortal?” The voice speculated.

“Didn’t he arrive?” Li Qiye asked.

“Yes, but I never got to take a look. The brat ran fast enough to lose his shoes while I kept hiding in this minor world. I didn’t dare to come out.” This was a rather embarrassing thing to admit but the being didn't hide it.

This was rather understandable. Li Qiye’s battle ended with the death and disappearance of many top beings. This made him even more unstoppable.

He could crush the greed intent with a single finger. Thus, it was wise to stay away.

“You made the right move.” Li Qiye nodded instead of teasing.

“Sigh, the past is gone.” The voice said wistfully. It used to be so arrogant and never needed to hide.

“There’s an end to everything.” Li Qiye said.

The being breathed in and changed the topic: “Dao Brother, do you wish to fight?”

“Perhaps.” Li Qiye didn’t deny it.

“Dao Brother, what if he is a true immortal now? Are you still confident?” The voice asked.

“Who knows? Who had fought with a true immortal before? Have to fight to know the answer.” Li Qiye smiled.

In the distant ages, some monstrous lords have fought him before. Alas, too many years had passed and he was no longer the same. Even existences like them couldn’t come up with a reasonable analysis.

“Hmm, let’s assume that he is a true immortal, shouldn’t he visit the final battlefield?” The voice contemplated a bit before asking.

“Challenging the villainous heaven.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Yes, that should have been the logical course of action but instead, he remained passive and then suddenly appeared in Eight Desolaces.” The voice said.

“It’s interesting indeed.” Li Qiye smiled: “He is always seeking perfection but if everything is perfect, this perfectness will be a fatal weakness.”

“Being perfect is a fatal weakness.” The voice mused this comment.
