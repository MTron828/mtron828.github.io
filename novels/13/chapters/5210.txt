Chapter 5211: Answer Our Call, Conqueror

Although Impetuous lost the competition against Supreme, how many had managed to win throughout the long years?

Thus, this experienced dragon lord could still rampage uncontested in the modern day.

“A perfect dragon lord? Or does he have an immortal shell now?” Other dragon lords speculated.

For regular cultivators, twelve sacred fruits meant something incredible. However, this was still only the beginning.

The twelve fruits were required to create an immortal shell and with that, the sacred anima tree. This was a path longer than the previous with each step harder than the previous.

The rewards were everlasting life and then immortality. However, even the founders - Space Dragon Emperor and Dragon-ox Ancestor - might not have reached the final level.

Since Impetuous has had twelve sacred fruits for a long time now, others wondered if he had created an immortal shell.

He was more valuable as a reference point than Supreme. The latter was brilliant and legendary, making his cultivation impossible to duplicate.

The floating Impetuous looked rather prideful and arrogant as he laughed and said: “I apologize but I must take Alchemy Dao’s spot since I am here for Heaven Reckon.”

He clearly didn’t give a damn about Resplendent Monarch who only had ten sacred fruits. The difference between the two of them was immense.

He didn’t apologize to Qilin Manor or Iron Tree either, only Alchemy Dao. This was because he might require certain medicines in the future - something true for virtually everyone in the upper continents.

“Don’t even think about it!” Resplendent Monarch didn’t relent because their alliance must obtain the Dream Immortal Order. He was ready to risk his life for it.

“It’s not up to you.” Impetuous laughed and raised his foot again for another stomp.

“Boom!” The power of the stars and three thousand worlds gathered beneath his foot. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“Frenzy Cosmo!” The sky turned dark as a result as inhabitants looked upward and saw countless stars.

Resplendent Monarch was trapped in this newly-created galaxy, looking like an insect.

“Qilin Art!” Resplendent Monarch changed to a divine qilin.

It spewed out flames and incinerated the galaxy. At the same time, its huge frame caused considerable damage to the stars.

“That’s not enough.” Impetuous laughed and activated his twelve sacred fruits, sending a palm seal into the galaxy.

This was enough to send the gigantic beast flying for countless miles. Spectators took a deep breath after seeing this.

“Nothing can make up the gap of two fruits.” One of them said.

“Bam!” The seal suppressed and changed the qilin back to humanoid form. He vomited blood, unable to break free from the seal.

“Imperial Attendant will lose the throne.” Another spectator said.

Everyone could see that this alliance was the weakest of the thirteen participants. Their strongest ancient ancestor, Resplendent Monarch, only had ten sacred fruits. Impetuous wasn’t strong enough to take a spot from anyone else, so this was the obvious target.

“It’s not too late to hand it over.” Impetuous shouted.

“Never!” Resplendent Monarch gritted his teeth, preferring death instead of giving up.

Li Qiye, who had just entered Imperial Gate, glanced upward and frowned. Nonetheless, he still didn’t take action.

“Boom!” Back in Alchemy Dao, a unique rune encompassed in flames manifested into reality. Although it wasn’t overly bright, it still reached all the lands in the upper continents including the deepest crevices.

“Answer our call, Immortal Pagoda Conqueror!” A loud cry came from Alchemy Dao.

“Immortal Pagoda Conqueror?” This surprised neutral listeners since this cultivator was not affiliated with Alchemy Dao.

He was once the guardian of Heaven Alliance but gave up his position to focus on cultivation. If it wasn’t for his deliberate abdication, Supreme would not be in charge right now.

“Boom!” The sky vault suddenly cracked into two halves. The crack was large enough to take in the entire city.

A pagoda appeared from the crack and poured down chaos laws and runes. Hymns praising the wonders of the world could be heard everywhere.

“The pagoda!” Even conquerors shuddered after seeing this.
