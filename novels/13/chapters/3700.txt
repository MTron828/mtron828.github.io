Chapter 3701: Onslaught

Just one punch was all it took to destroy the vanguard - this shocked all the spectators.

Their dazed eyes were focused on both the statue with its missing arm along with Li Qiye’s bronze arm.

A while ago, they assumed that Li Qiye would smash or throw the statue towards the regiment. After all, that seemed to be the only way to use the massive entity.

No one expected that the right arm could actually peel off and empower Li Qiye instead.

“What is that thing?” Many stared at the statue, astounded.

In fact, most assumed that it was only a work of art displayed inside the main store of Wish Ward. This no longer seemed the case.

“Amitabha.” The monk was the only one who understood everything. He found himself enlightened as a result, able to understand the mysteries of the statue. This was a unique weapon; its power couldn’t be gauged by conventional wisdom.

As for the general of Abyss Dragon Regiment, he instinctively staggered backward after seeing this.

His men were battle-hardened. Not to mention a conqueror-level junior, even a myriad-form expert wouldn’t be able to beat them with one move.

Alas, his vanguards have been wiped out by one punch. He felt suffocated while staring at the statue. He tried to analyze it to no avail.

At this point, Li Qiye strolled into Black Robe Alley’s western street.

“Clank!” The remaining soldiers unsheathed and readied their weapons.

“Stand in my path and die. This place shall fall today.” Li Qiye nonchalantly declared.

No one doubted his ability at this point.

“What’s that thing?” An ancestor inside the mansion of the Grand Chancellor asked.

Unfortunately, the Grand Chancellor and his ancestors had no idea despite their vast knowledge.

“The thing has always been in the courtyard of Wish Ward. They never moved it before.” Another ancestor said. Their group has visited Wish Ward and saw the statue plenty of time before. They didn’t pay any attention to it previously.

As Li Qiye walked forward, the regiment matched his pace in retreating. They waited for an order, not daring to attack without permission.

“Center, march!” The general finally gave the order.

Battalions that were part of the center unit consisting of tens of thousand troops instantly surrounded Li Qiye.

“Go!” An officer shouted and leaped into the sky. Celestials appeared beneath his feet as he summoned a cauldron. He chanted and chaos true energy oozed out. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

The fate palaces of this officer opened. The flames of life oozed out from the cauldron of life, fully engulfing the airspace.

“Clank!” A sonorous clank could be heard as the runes of the officer came together to create a fiery cauldron.

The other soldiers also disappeared and became one with this massive cauldron. Terrible heat waves emanated from the mouth.

The spectators in the distance had to back off. The entire street was in danger of melting from the heat.

“Poof!” More and more billowed from the mouth like a volcanic eruption. Inside the cauldron was more lava, ready to rush out and show the world their destructive nature.

A few drops actually leaked from the cauldron and melted the ground, resulting in deep pits.

Some shuddered at this sight. A full-scale attack from the cauldron would immediately turn someone into liquid, turning them into a part of the lava.

“Die!” The cauldron mouth aimed at Li Qiye before shooting up a torrent of lava wrapped in flames.

“Zzz...” Some buildings nearby were reduced to ashes.

“He’s gonna turn into roast meat, no, evaporate from this!” One spectator shouted.

In the next moment, loud clunks could be heard as the entire statue disassembled into millions of pieces. They fully surrounded and latched onto Li Qiye’s body.

In just a split second, the statue disappeared and Li Qiye was adorned in a full set of armor.

“Boom!” The lava torrent slammed on him but he was completely untouched thanks to the armor plates.

The regiment couldn’t believe this result. This wasn’t their first time using the great cauldron. They once destroyed another army using this one move. Alas, it was completely ineffective this time.

Of course, everyone could tell that this was due to the armor, not Li Qiye’s power.

“What the hell is that thing?!” One spectator loudly shouted.

“Too weak.” Li Qiye patted his chest to wipe off the dirt. That move earlier couldn’t even scratch an itch.

“My turn.” He smiled and blue fiery particles emerged around him.

“Boom!” The particles twisted together and created a frightening pulse. It shot forward and blinded the audience, instantly piercing the cauldron and reducing it to nothingness.

“Ahh!” Miserable cries sounded. The tens of thousand soldiers of the center battalion suffered the same fate. They didn’t put up much of a fight against the pulse.

“This doesn’t make any sense...” The spectators shuddered - this pulse was insanely strong.

“Amitabha.” The monk chanted but his expression wasn’t one of mercy and pity. He looked quite excited from understanding the weapon more and more.
