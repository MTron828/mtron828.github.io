Chapter 3802: Having Fun?

Nothing else should result from this attack outside of certain demise. The ground cracked and exploded from the impact.

Li Qiye’s spot was replaced by a crater with debris showering to all sides. Once vision returned, they saw the crater being filled with rocks and dirt.

Li Qiye and the tree were nowhere to be found. He might be buried beneath the mess or was blown into bloody mist scattering to the wind.

The spectators remained dazed while looking at the crater and thinking about the sure-kill move earlier. The top ancestors thought that they would have died to it as well.

“What an attack, it’s definitely fatal.” One high elder became emotional.

“Right, it blocked the grand dao so the opponent became helpless.” Another big shot added.

The seal created by Hu Ben’s treasure was nothing short of impressive. The ancestors didn’t have a solution for it. Anyone would become helpless and die to Phantom’s spear afterward.

“He gotta be dead, right?” A youth murmured.

Others exchanged glances, thinking that this should be the case. They saw how Li Qiye’s power was primarily from the holy ground. Thus, once this source was severed, he had no chance of surviving the fatal attack.

“Yes.” One ancestor agreed with a touch of reluctance.

The lack of confidence was due to Li Qiye who had performed numerous miracles before. There was a chance that he could be completely unscathed. Why? Because he was Li Qiye.

Phantom and Hu Ben remained nervous. They obviously wanted Li Qiye to be dead. But what if the guy managed to survive? They didn’t dare to think about this possibility.

“A mighty move indeed.” The scion nodded approvingly. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

To earn his praise showed the might of the combination attack earlier. However, he thought that Li Qiye was still alive.

As for Xu Cuimei, she chuckled and wasn’t too interested. The result was obvious to her.

In her eyes, these two unwisely overestimated themselves and were suicidal. The two sides weren’t on the same level in the slightest. The strongest weapons and merit laws couldn’t make up this gap.

Even for someone as powerful as her, she thought that she wouldn’t be able to block half a technique if he truly wanted to slay her.

“We got him.” After a long wait, Hu Ben and Phantom heaved a sigh of relief.

The other spectators thought the same since there was no commotion around the crater.

The youths who were fans of Phantom and Hu Ben became excited. One shouted: “The temporal diagram and Lightning Fiend are invincible weapons. No one in this world can stop them.”

“Damn right, Phantom Sacred Child and Hu Ben of Vajra’s combination attack is unstoppable. Li Qiye stood no chance in the first place.” Another fan chimed in.

“I can stop it.” A domineering voice interjected. It was none other than Righteous Scion.

The youths turned red and didn’t dare to respond. He had earned the right to be haughty.

Nonetheless, they felt as if he had just slapped them - a truly frustrating feeling.

Suddenly, a loud blast sent the debris flying and interrupted the tense atmosphere. Buddhist light pulsed once more, resulting in earthquakes.

Next, a figure soared to the sky.

“Li Qiye!” Everyone recognized him right away.

He floated in the air with the Buddhist tree next to him. Beneath the tree was an undamaged landmass.

He then landed on the landmass, looking calm and indifferent. The Buddhist light emanating from the tree remained comforting.

Most importantly, he was undoubtedly uninjured.

“Impossible!” Both Hu Ben and Phantom staggered backward in astonishment.

Killing Li Qiye might be pushing it but they were still confident in inflicting some damage. This didn’t seem to be the case at all.

“What the hell? I thought the diagram severed Li Qiye’s connection with the holy ground.” One spectator was perplexed.

Due to the severing, Li Qiye shouldn’t have been able to withstand the attack. Now, not even one strand of hair looked to be missing.

“Having fun?” Li Qiye patted the dirt off his shoulders with a smile before the speechless crowd.

“Buzz.” The tree’s roots then connected with the land again just like tentacles. This scene was quite bizarre.

“Rumble!” The dirt and rocks outside suddenly returned to the crater as if time was reversing.

Li Qiye was no longer in the air. He stood in the same spot as before with the tree next to him.

People looked down at the ground and couldn’t find a single crack. They felt as if this was nothing more than a dream.

The suppression and fatal blow along with the crater might as well didn’t happened, or that they were just part of a dream. But now, everyone has woken up.

“How did he do it?” One youth felt his legs trembling.

A high monk placed his palms together and chanted: “Amitabha, Amitabha. This is the reconstruction power of Buddhism. Benefactor, you have obtained the samadhi. I am in the presence of a wise monk.”

He became quite confused because Li Qiye wasn’t a Buddhist. How could he turn himself into a venerable user of Buddhism in no time at all? The whole thing didn’t make sense.
