Chapter 4837: Grand Dao Journey

Contrary to the previous old men, a youth with halos circling around him walked closer. Each halo also had an accompanying totem. They pulsed with a purple glow. He also had ten purple suns behind him that commanded respect and awe.

Others would immediately think that he was a supreme genius given his aura and appearance. In reality, he was far from being young.

“What’s my name, First Brother?” He came over with a beaming smile.

He appeared excited and eager to gloat with a hint of currying favors. His demeanor was a stark contrast to his impressive cultivation and appearance.

“My foot has the urge to greet your butt.” Li Qiye smiled after seeing him. The guy seemed to be younger with time on top of becoming happier.

“Please don’t.” The youth apologized: “How long has it been since we last met? First Brother, you are the lighthouse guiding my life. The me of today wouldn’t exist without you, that’s why I’m so excited to see you again. My love for you is as boundless as the coursing river…”

Few in Eight Desolaces acted in this manner after knowing Li Qiye’s identity and power. Nan Huairen was one of them.

Of course, he was only a sycophant to Li Qiye and acted properly like a grand Godking before the juniors.

Moreover, he was actually speaking the truth. Everything he had today was thanks to Li Qiye’s grace. Otherwise, he would have returned to the earth instead of being alive and well.

“Look at how confident and haughty you are now. You must have stolen a fortune from the divine tree.” Li Qiye said.

Nan Huairen smiled awkwardly and said: “I merely learned from the tree, stealing is a strong word. Plus, it wasn’t hard cultivating after receiving your help.”

The other gods from Cleansing Incense shook their head. Zhang Yu was the strongest among them but in terms of living a happy life, Nan Huairen had that on lockdown.

“Go away.” Li Qiye said playfully while waving his hand.

Nan Huairen smiled but shamelessly stood behind Li Qiye. The latter didn’t mind and focus on the bronze legion.

From a distance, they looked like a tsunami made of steel, capable of incredible destruction. No other legion possessed the same battle prowess.

“Clank!” The commander of the legion raised his spear once before prostrating on the ground.

“Clank!” The members of the legion got on their knees. Their battle intent swept through the myriad realms. Being the leader of such a legion was something to be proud of - a life worth living.

“Glory, yours. The world, yours. The future, also yours.” Li Qiye placed his palm on his heart and said: “As long as I exist, so will you all. We shall be eternal.”

“Buzz.” His primordial light illuminated the entire legion. Dao runes appeared around them as they gained the power and essence of the primordial dao. They became holier and seemed unbeatable.

The stronger cultivators could feel the legion’s battle intent being infused with a primordial aura. The great tree spread its branches and sent down halos. Each soldier gained a halo and finally, the halos lifted them up and pulled them back into the tree, disappearing from sight.

“Peace has come.” Li Qiye then looked at the world and concluded.

“It is time for you to rest, Young Master.” Tantai Ruonan spoke softly.

He nodded and entered the secret dimension.

***

After this battle, living beings realized how feeble their lives were. They witnessed apocalyptic forces so now, they gained a new appreciation of life and home.

The world has also changed. Spirit energy became immensely dense. The invasive overlords have destroyed a corner of the world. Nonetheless, their death made their energy and vitality become a part of Eight Desolaces.

Since cultivation became easier, living beings tried even harder to train in preparation for the incoming golden age.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

As for Li Qiye, he strolled beneath the divine tree and basked in its light. Each step of his harmonized with three thousand worlds.

Triune Immortal kept him company. The light made her indescribably beautiful. The duo seemed to be a pair made in heaven - one capable of walking together on this endless path.

“Do you still have any attachment to the mortal world?” Li Qiye asked as they walked while holding hands.

Something changed about her once-empty eyes. There were flashing rays deep in there now.

“The dao is only an obsession.” She spoke softly: “Only the heart matters.”

“Your heart needs to be warmed in order to stay the same.” He responded.

“By who?” She stared at him, seemingly rather pleased with her companion.

“Let the heart remember.” Li Qiye closed his eyes and channeled his grand dao.

She also closed her eyes and let the grand dao flow. The two grand dao communicated and twisted together. They breathed together in unison during this immaculate harmony.

This type of dao romance had no need for words. They attempted to reach the most profound apex of the dao together.

Warmthness coursed through their heart. This was a place without space and time, only the heartbeat and the mystical grand dao.

After a long while, feelings that couldn’t be described by words surfaced. They walked hand-in-hand across the galaxy.

“I require your help.” Li Qiye said.

“Very well, I shall ready my weapon and armor.” She understood without needing elaboration.

“The time will come.” He said.

“Leave it to me.” She nodded. Though her tone was gentle, it also contained an indelible determination.

“It won’t be easy there, the ravenous hunters are always watching.” He said.

“I will be with the Primordial Tree and fuse our dao.” She knew what to do.

“There is a long way to go, it’s better to be prudent.” He nodded.

“We shall be fine.” She held his hand and said seriously.

He looked up at the distant space. There seemed to be something slumbering there.

“Not waking up at all, it’s rather problematic.” He said: “There might be a devious plan amidst.”

“Leave the flank to me.” She said as their fingers intertwined.

He pondered in silence for a bit before adding: “We require a flawless strategy, wasting the opportunity is unacceptable.”

She only held his hand and didn’t respond.
