Chapter 5831: What The Hell Are These Things?

“Living a long time is not a virtue or skill, turtles live long too but they don’t reign over the ocean. What have you all done? Fight the heaven? No, too afraid to even attempt after a few tribulations. Proud of your intelligence? The villainous heaven can create life so you attempted as well, but what did you accomplish? Your so-called creation attempts were outrageous copulations with everything, fiends, corpses, whatever you can get your hands on. Now, you’re reduced to an unsightly abomination, who gave you the audacity to insult Trinity Ancestor?” Li Qiye went on a sharp rant, aiming at Derivation’s weak points.

“Brat, I will kill you!” Derivation shouted.

Li Qiye shook his head and smiled: “The rage of an ugly monster, not an overlord with unmatched wisdom. I was giving you too much credit calling you a madman, you’re nothing but a clown.”

“You!” For all the intelligence he possessed, his insecurities and rage rendered him speechless and unable to utter all the curses on his mind.

Listeners were astounded. If throwing insults was a type of cultivation, Li Qiye would be a verbal-jab epoch lord.

“Boom!” Derivation had enough and spewed out endless miasma.

“Shit!” The founder and the three immortals had a swift escape route since this was their territory.

Profound, Sword, Nether, and Hao Hai immediately ran over to the four remaining statues.

Other unfortunate souls were caught by the miasma except those who had secretly retreated during Li Qiye’s insults.

The former group chose to stay due to their confidence in the overlords. Now, the miasma turned out to be a transportation method for cells.

The loyalists including Light-dragon, Heaven Burial, War, and many more bellowed in astonishment. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

They activated their auras and defensive laws only to find that the cells bypassed everything. This was an unprecedented attack.

“Ahhh!” Screams echoed from the victims as they failed to escape from the pollen-like cells.

Their body became blurred and lost any distinctive features, melting into a pile of mud.

“Plop! Plop!” Tentacles sprouted from the piles and swung wildly in the air.

“Nooo!” Light-dragon and his peers lasted a bit longer than the others. Eventually, the cells invaded and they became piles of flesh as well.

They screamed with indignation as tentacles took over, changing them into terrifying existences. In this last second, they regretted their choice of fighting to the end for Celestial Court’s sake. They didn’t fear dying but turning into abominations was a different story.

They were legends respected by all once but now, they became even more vile than Lord of Derivation due to the numerous tentacles. They preferred being reduced to ashes by Li Qiye’s punch than turning into these creatures.

The lucky survivors heeded Li Qiye’s warning and left fast enough. When they looked back, they became horrified by the takeover.

Profound, Sword, Nether, and Hao Hai turned pale. The miasma also reached them and the four statues.

“We are the ancestors’ vessels!” Nether shouted a reminder.

Nether had Primal Ancestor, Profound had Dao Ancestor, Sword Emperor had Imperial Progenitor, and Hao Hai had Stonesplitter Patriarch. They were chosen to be the overlords’ vessels when necessary.

Thus, the miasma and the cells stopped attacking them.

“What the hell are these things?” Demon and the others took a deep breath while watching through the mirror.

They had listened to Li Qiye and left Celestial Court a while back. Otherwise, they would share the same fate as Light-dragon’s group.

“Parasitic.” World Emperor sighed and said: “The ancient ming possessed a similar ability back then.”

“They were monstrous.” An Immortal Emperor said.

The younger ones could only imagine the past, being lucky enough to not have experienced those dark times.

***

The founder sighed after seeing the death of Light-dragon’s group. Summoning a god was easy, but asking one to leave was difficult. This was the reason why they were always hesitant with these summonings. The price was too high.

The three immortals turned pale; they spent most of their lives inviting emperors and monarchs to Celestial Court. Now, Lord of Derivation put an end to this in no time at all.
