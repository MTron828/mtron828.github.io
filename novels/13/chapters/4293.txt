Chapter 4294: Teaching

Weiqiao had no inferiority complex since he has come to terms with reality. It’s just that he couldn’t understand the logic behind Li Qiye’s decision.

By this point, the entire sect understood Li Qiye’s potential and ability. They knew that following him would end with nothing but good results.

Many would love to become his disciples but he only had eyes for Weiqiao.

“I, I have to kneel?” Weiqiao didn’t know if this was a joke or not.

“Yes.” Li Qiye nodded.

Weiqiao took a deep breath and got on his knees then bowed. His head touched the ground as he spoke: “Honored Master, please accept my worship.”

He then prostrated two more times and hit his head on the ground a total of nine times.

Li Qiye stood there nonchalantly and accepted the grand gesture.

Finally, Elder Hu helped him up and happily said: “Congratulations, Brother Wang, this will be a new chapter for you.”

He considered it an honor to become Li Qiye’s disciple. Though he felt the same confusion as Weiqiao, he was still happy for him.

“Congratulations, Sect Master, I’m sure your new disciple will contribute greatly to the sect.” He then turned towards Li Qiye, not aware of how true his words would be.

“Elder, don’t flatter me now. I would be content with not embarrassing the sect.” Weiqiao chuckled awkwardly.

Given his abilities, he wasn’t worthy of being Li Qiye’s disciple, let alone revitalizing the sect.

“I will bestow you the way, whether you can learn it or not is up to you.” Li Qiye said.

“Which merit law will you teach me, Master?” Weiqiao became anxious.

“Chaos Mantra.” Li Qiye responded.

“Chaos?” Both old men blurted out at the same time.

Weiqiao was already learning Chaos. Wouldn’t this be unnecessary?

“I’m already training with Chaos, Master.” Weiqiao respectfully said.

“Do you think you’ve done a good job?” Li Qiye gave him the side-eye.

“You’re right, Master. Chaos might not be a supreme mantra but I’ve let it down.” Weiqiao admitted.

He was aware of rumors regarding this mantra in the past eras, how it used to produce top cultivators. It didn’t have the same negative reputation as it did now.

Moreover, other disciples had better results with Chaos after a similar period of time. Thus, he clearly didn’t do a good job.

“We have an ancient immortal physique in the sect now, Brother Wang should learn that instead since he is your disciple now, Sect Master.” Elder Hu tried to smooth things over.

Normally, Weiqiao shouldn’t attempt to learn something so difficult but since Li Qiye was the one who brought the scroll back to the sect, he had the right to do so.

“You’ve misunderstood. Are you sure you have cultivated the right Chaos Mantra?” Li Qiye asked.

“Well…” Weiqiao had no response.

“The Chaos Mantra in the sect right now is only a copy that can be bought from street vendors. This version has lost its original profundities and fundamentals. Thus, the fault isn’t on you. It doesn’t matter how hard you try, it’s a fruitless endeavor in the first place.” Li Qiye elaborated.

The two old men contemplated carefully and agreed. The seven starting mantras have been around since the start of the epoch. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

After so many eras, they must have been changed and modified, no longer the same as before. The particular version in the sect was as cheap as can be. Little Diamond bought them back then only to fill up their treasury.

“Please guide me, Master.” Weiqiao bowed.

“I will first teach you how to chop wood with three movements.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Chopping wood?” The two were surprised again.

Elder Hu assumed that Li Qiye would start by teaching Weiqiao the best possible merit laws that were available. This didn’t seem to be the case.

“Is there a need to learn how to chop?” Weiqiao asked.

“Do you think you have mastered this then?” Li Qiye answered with a question.

Weiqiao didn’t respond. In reality, he was quite good with this task and Li Qiye had praised him before. But, he didn’t know Li Qiye’s perceived ceiling.

“You don’t want to teach him something else, Sect Master?” Elder Hu thought that this was a great opportunity for Weiqiao. Becoming the sect master’s disciple availed him to excellent merit laws.

Alas, Li Qiye wanted to teach him how to chop wood? This seemed rather ridiculous. Moreover, Weiqiao was trustworthy and had toiled for decades. He deserved better merit laws.

“I think stronger merit laws might be more suitable.” He hurriedly added.

“Stronger merit laws? No merit laws are invincible, only the users.” Li Qiye stared at the elder.

“I see…” Weiqiao became emotional and started fantasizing.

“Do you know any true invincible masters that rely on someone else’s merit law?” Li Qiye asked.

The duo exchanged glances and in terms of merit laws, the top dao lords didn’t use pre-existing ones and created their own grand dao.

“I await your guidance, Master.” Weiqiao said.

“Watch carefully, we’ll see if you can learn it.” Li Qiye ordered before grabbing Weiqiao’s hatchet.

Weiqiao immediately focused up and tried to observe all the little details in Li Qiye’s movement.

Li Qiye raised the hatchet, swung downward, and split the piece of wood. His action seemed slow and nonchalant as if it was in tune with the rhythm of heaven and earth, moving along the trajectory of a grand dao.

It appeared simple just like a mortal chopping wood. Others would laugh at him and paid no mind.

However, Weiqiao saw something different as he replayed the action in his mind repeatedly. He could sense a dao harmonization happening.

Having finished the demonstration, Li Qiye handed the hatchet back to Weiqiao.

“Master, what is the name of this move?” Weiqiao became curious.

“It’s just a casual swing.” Li Qiye responded.
