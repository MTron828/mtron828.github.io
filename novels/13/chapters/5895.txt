Chapter 5895: Jiao Heng’s Story

The list contained three more names - Twilight Hunter, the darkness buried in Eight Desolaces, and Trinity Ancestor. They turned into essences to nourish the epoch.

“The battle is finally over, it stretched several hundred thousand years.” Stonesplitter, a main combatant, commented.

He was the only one spared at the start of the battle and thought it was over. A golden age came next but in reality, it took a longer period for the conclusion.

Li Qiye carried out his promise and swept away the darkness from his epoch. Now, it was completely under his control. No one else lurked in the shadows, awaiting the right time to strike. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Sacred Teacher.” Stonesplitter put down his shield and spear, prostrating before Li Qiye.

All cultivators submitted to the epoch lord and his world. After all, he clearly displayed a power beyond their imagination.

Li Qiye’s plan finally came to fruition with the help of World, Sword, Hao Hai, and many others.

Nevertheless, others weren’t bothered by his supremacy because this epoch had the potential to be the brightest of them all.

The lords of the forbidden ground and the dead existences understood that as long as Li Qiye was around, this epoch couldn’t be touched. Dividing it was impossible since it belonged to the people now.

The foundation established by Li Qiye was immovable and he had also made examples of violators. The epoch enjoyed more resources than before with the addition of three mighty overlords.

Li Qiye didn’t leave for Heavenrealm right away, choosing to visit a courtyard in Celestial Court.

An old man awaited him, looking like the keeper in charge of cleaning and other duties.

“Sacred Teacher.” The old man lowered his head upon seeing Li Qiye to show respect.

“Still here, I see.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I wouldn’t dare to leave without your permission. I am awaiting my punishment.” The old man said.

He was none other than the founder of Celestial Court. Alas, he had visibly aged and no longer looked as awe-inspiring as before. However, his eyes told a different story - he remained as powerful as ever.

Of course, he still felt like an ant while standing before Li Qiye.

Li Qiye didn’t kill him nor give him any instructions after the battle. Thus, he waited patiently in Celestial Court.

“Is that all, waiting for my punishment?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Of course, Sacred Teacher, I have no secrets to speak of before you, but if you need me as a guide, I will do my best.” He said respectfully.

“Lead the way then.” Li Qiye gave the order.

He immediately led Li Qiye through the long and dark hallways.

“Would you guide anyone else?” Li Qiye asked while walking shoulder to shoulder.

“You’re the second outsider who knows this place.” He smiled wryly.

“The first is Jiao Heng.” Li Qiye was not surprised.

“Yes, Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng had only one condition to join Celestial Court, and that was to take a look. I obliged.” He nodded.

“You didn’t tell him everything.” Li Qiye said.

“Probably couldn’t hide it from him, he just wasn’t sure.” He responded.

“The two of you reached an implicit understanding back then, you knew his goal and vice versa.” Li Qiye said.

“We didn’t have a conflict of interest, that’s all.” He said.

“That is true, which is why you were generous enough to give him the mecha.” Li Qiye smiled.

“There’s something I don’t understand.” He said: “In my humble opinion, Jiao Heng didn’t need it because he could break through. I observed him for a while and saw no problems, why didn’t he do it?”

“Because you don’t truly know him.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Please elaborate, Sacred Teacher.” He bowed and asked again.

“It’s no secret, he merely left behind a contingency by cutting down a part of himself and sealing it.” Li Qiye said.

“A contingency...” He murmured.

“There are advantages and disadvantages. A complete destruction would potentially be better for him, but leaving this contingency behind leaves room for the future, avoiding a dead end.” Li Qiye said while looking straight at the founder: “I’m sure you are no stranger to this. Having a contingency binds you. Unless you can fully surpass it, you’ll always be stuck in the old way.”

He understood and trembled slightly, inadvertently clenching his fists.

“You’re right, Sacred Teacher.” He sighed and said: “It was my fault for having a weak dao heart, I was the cause of this.”

“You thought you could maintain a balance between the overlords and acquiesced, this only worsened your situation. Pain and regrets haunted you all this time.” Li Qiye continued.

“Yes.” He took a deep breath: “I didn’t do what I should have, I chose concession instead.”

“Although you managed to hide and save some of the hundred races, the fallen ones never forgave.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I... I was afraid, Sacred Teacher.” The founder smiled bitterly: “I am still haunted by the death of Divine Ancestor and the sacrificed ones.”

“It’s a shame that Trinity Ancestor couldn’t save you and would have pulled you into the abyss.” Li Qiye said.

This was another painful disappointment. After making concessions, he awaited the return of his master - Trinity Ancestor.

He recalled the moment of departure - how majestic and mighty his master was. Therefore, he held on to hope during the darkest moment, awaiting his master’s triumphant return.

This sliver of hope helped him live through the dark years. Alas, when he finally met his master again, his disappointment couldn’t be overstated.
