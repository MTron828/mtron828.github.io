Chapter 4819: Vessel Of Life

“Creating new epochs and lives is our ultimate pursuit.” The abyssal lord took pride in his creation.

Many supreme overlords could start a new epoch but to create life? This was rather exceptional.

Of course, his sea dwellers didn’t come from nothing since he relied on the bloodline of the divine beasts to create them. Nonetheless, this was still an exceptional feat so he didn’t mind the jeerings.

He turned his attention to Tantai Ruonan and said: “Little girl, since we are connected by fate and it is rare for me to show up, join me and I shall teach you the way of the epoch lord. You shall rule this one.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

The overlords rarely took in disciples but now, the abyssal lord became interested.

Spectators have seen his power just now. To obtain his dao legacy was something unimaginable. It might be the creation of a new supreme overlord.

“Leave when there is still time. Otherwise, I will kill you.” Tantai Ruonan refused.

“I see.” The abyssal lord didn’t waste time: “If that’s the case, I shall devour you first and then the World Tree. No one will be able to stop me then.”

He gazed at the towering tree beyond the Void Zone and salivated.

“This minor world is extremely nutritious.” In reality, Triune Alligator Lord and Dead Immortal paid attention to the Void Zone as well, wanting to devour not just the World Tree but everything there. 

This was one of the nine Heavenly Treasures. It might not be on par with Li Qiye’s flesh but shouldn’t be that far off.

“Let’s see if he has anything else.” Dead Immortal paid attention.

All three overlords found themselves wanting more than just Li Qiye. Triune Immortal, the Supreme Monarch, Taitai Ruonan, and the Void Zone were all delicious feasts.

This was akin to catching one fish after another. They would never cry about having too many.

“Buzz.” Tantai Ruonan didn’t waste time and channeled her vitality. Waves of energy rushed out like a tsunami and assaulted Eight Desolaces.

“Such formidable vitality.” Cultivators felt the land shaking violently. They have never felt something like this before from a single cultivator.

“Impressive.” The abyssal lord praised. The more powerful she was, the more nutritious.

He raised his hand and the maelstrom came together. This was akin to the most frightening implosion - the cataclysmic maelstrom was reduced into a single drop of water.

Unfortunately, this didn’t calm the spectators down and only worried them even more. The fabrics of reality couldn’t contain this single drop as it came down for Tantai Ruonan.

Time stagnated and everyone saw the water drop clearly. In the mortal world, it would appear to be a harmless raindrop.

In this case, this single drop could pierce through Eight Desolaces and cause untold destruction.

Space and time crumbled, being pulled inward by the sheer immensity of the water drop. Everyone could hear a sinking noise due to the destruction.

As for Tantai Ruonan, her activated vitality was being pushed down, unable to offer any resistance.

“To the other shore.” She chanted and a boat manifested above her.

“Boom!” Her vitality suddenly intensified and could flip over Eight Desolaces.

“Vessel of Life.” She ordered. 

The true gods behind her roared. One of them shouted: “Descend!” 

They sent out their strongest dao laws while the World Tree became resplendent and brimmed with life force. The true gods served as channeling points to direct the power of the tree to her.

This tree was one of the Nine Heavenly Treasures. It pushed up the firmaments and contained the forces of three thousand worlds.

“Boom!” The various affinities fused together in harmony with her acting as its vessel. This allowed her to stop the terrible drop of water.

Cultivators suffered terrible anxiety and fear. They were forced to the ground and had no choice but to pray for the best outcome.

“This epoch’s foundation is rather strong.” One supreme overlord commented.

The situation has escalated beyond Li Qiye. The potential rewards included Triune Immortal and the Void Zone. 

Of course, those on the sideline didn’t mind waiting a little longer. Perhaps if the combatants were to be exhausted enough, they could consume the alligator lord, Dead Immortal, and the abyssal lord as well.

Suddenly, an unexpected bang came from Li Qiye and affected all the realms. It scared the hell out of everyone including the overlords.

Everyone immediately glanced over at Li Qiye and saw a lightning bolt from a tribulation flashing. Fortunately, it was contained within his body. He seemed to be trying to expel it to no avail.

“It’s real, the tribulation is in his soul, this is a grievous injury.” One overlord concluded.

“He’s still trying.” Another became emotional.

It became abundantly clear that Li Qiye has reached a frightening level. He wanted to expel the tribulation out of his body and soul. This would leave him fully healed.

The overlords had this experience before and knew its significance.

“There’s not much time, he might actually be able to recover.” Someone in space communicated with his peers.

“We must work together now.” Dead Immortal suggested to the alligator and the abyssal lord.
