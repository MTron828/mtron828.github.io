Chapter 5500: Cotton Candy

The adorable cloud possessed enough power to send an apex dao lord flying - something truly unbelievable.

“Brat, don’t make me eat you!” Niu Fen gritted his teeth and threatened.

The cloud made a face at him again and didn’t care at all.

“It won’t answer so don’t bother.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Am I not handsome and charismatic?” Niu Fen said with indignation.

“Because your heart has murderous intent.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“What? You certainly have more than me in this regard, Young Master.” Niu Fen protested.

Li Qiye’s murderous intent was second to none; his seemed like a speck of dust in comparison.

“It’s not like that.” Li Qiye smiled and gently tapped the white cloud: “Want me to come with you, right?”

It nodded and spun around repeatedly, clearly willing to communicate with Li Qiye but not Niu Fen.

“Very well, let’s go.” Li Qiye said.

The cloud expanded and became larger with ripples emanating outward. Eventually, it turned into a tunnel of sorts - a gateway to a different location.

“Wait here.” Li Qiye told Niu Fen before entering the tunnel.

“Young Master, I have to come with you!” Niu Fen shamelessly tried to follow him.

“Bam!” Alas, the cloud blocked him and disappeared from sight.

Nothing was left of the two, leaving Niu Fen all alone with the chilling breezes.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Fuck.” Niu Fen cursed: “Damn you little cloud, how dare you look down on someone as great as me? I’ll eat you like cotton candy next time.”

Unfortunately, there was nothing he could do because their destination was unknown.

After crossing through the cloud tunnel, Li Qiye found himself in an ancient tower. Each brick, tile, and wooden piece had aged considerably. The beams of the building were blackened from time.

This seemed to be a temple due to the presence of incense thuribles. Candles flickered and cast the hall in a dim light.

The smell of incense sticks and candles wafted in the air - a legacy of countless generations coming here to pay respect. They have engrained themselves into the building by this point.

Statues in front of the hall commanded attention. They were incredibly lifelike and exuded a peerless presence.

As they stood there, they could safeguard this world despite being inanimate objects. Most depicted beautiful and graceful women; only a few were male.

Whoever they were, they must have been the most gorgeous of their generation on top of being emperors and monarchs.

His eyes fell upon the three central statues. Two of them had the aura of the Grand Emperor realm.

“Sunset Glow Valley.” Li Qiye recognized them and murmured.

This was a powerful lineage in the previous epoch with mainly female cultivators. They were devils with pure bloodline, granting them an amazing advantage for cultivation. Their progenitor - Sunset Glow Devil Emperor - preferred an isolated approach for the sect.

Nonetheless, outsiders took pride in marrying any member of Sunset Glow. Their bloodline was wonderful, resulting in mighty offspring.

This sect wasn’t significant to Li Qiye in the grand scheme of things. After all, there was no lack of two-emperor lineages during the thirteen continents’ prime. It had nothing that could interest him.

Thus, he stared at the third statue in the very center. In theory, the status of their progenitor should have been in the center but this was not the case. Her statue was situated to the side along with the other Grand Emperor of Sunset Glow.

The pivotal position belonged to another female statue. It looked vivid and animated as if it was alive.

The outfit was simple and could be seen worn by a village girl. Her hair was tied up with a wooden hairpin. No makeup was depicted either.

Nonetheless, her plain style didn’t conceal her beauty and immaculate figure. She exuded an indescribable charm that was as refreshing as a clear autumn stream. Her spirited and unyielding nature could be seen from the subtle curl of her lips.

“Oh?” Li Qiye was surprised to see this statue.

In terms of appearance alone, it was definitely inferior compared to the two Grand Emperors nearby. The latter two could be described as kingdom-toppling while possessing immaculate auras.

Her status looked relatively ordinary. However, it was clearly more important since it took the central position.

As he stared at the statue, forgotten memories resurfaced in his mind.
