Chapter 5104: Imperious

Listeners appreciated the conquerors for showing patience. At the very least, they gave Li Qiye a chance to defend himself.

Nonetheless, they knew that this was useless. How could he justify destroying three powerful lineages from Deity?

Moreover, plenty of witnesses saw him destroy Heaven Burial as well, not to mention Conceal Conqueror…

“Maybe it’s time to draw a line between us and The People.” One expert became worried: “A judgment from Celestial Court will be serious.”

Many shared this sentiment, not wanting to be dragged into this mess. They recalled the historical judgment from Celestial Court.

Numerous kingdoms and emperors were killed in one night. If this were to happen again, The People might be wiped out from the lower continents.

“We need to be one right now, more than ever.” A dragon lord from the People had a different opinion: “We survived the Immemorial Epoch War and Skysplitter and shall not yield now. Our conquerors and dao lords won’t abandon us.”

Ancestors began gathering in preparation for the worst.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

“Let me give you a piece of advice. Return from whence you came or you will be buried here. Of course, being buried in your homeland isn’t a bad idea either.” Li Qiye responded.

He didn’t hold back at all and shocked the listeners. Did he want to fight the conquerors?

“Hmph, there is no way he can beat them.” An expert from The Race disagreed.

“I can’t believe he is still so confident.” An ancient ancestor from The People became excited after hearing this.

Yes, the other side might have four conquerors but this was Li Qiye. They fantasized about Li Qiye winning and that the lower continents would be theirs.

“Since you choose to be antagonistic, don’t blame us for being rude.” Greenmountain Conqueror seemed furious.

“Give him a chance to defend himself first.” Vessel Conqueror said.

“His crimes are as clear as day.” Six-pot Conqueror said: “Admit your crimes and there might be room for negotiation.”

“Just pick a date and decide this with force.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“Very well!” Greenmountain coldly uttered: “We shall wait at Mountain of the Ages. A battle it is.”

“So be it.” Ascension agreed.

“There we go, a one-on-four will be fine.” Li Qiye stated the condition.

The conquerors were livid since he spoke with such disdain. They were dominant during their generation and haven’t been disrespected before.

“Three days later then.” Vessel said: “I will not hold back if you are indeed the culprit.”

“In three days.” Li Qiye agreed.

***

Inhabitants of the lower continents required a long time to digest this development - a battle between Li Qiye and four conquerors at the Mountain of the Ages. This could very well decide the future of their land.

“What if Li Qiye loses?” An ancient ancestor said with a solemn expression and didn’t dare to finish this thought.

In this case, the order of authority would completely shift toward The Race. Even if the four conquerors were to not start a massacre, the lineages of The People would be suppressed and treated as second-class inhabitants.

“But if Li Qiye wins, our golden age will come.” An expert remained optimistic.

Both sides believed in their own chances of victory.

“No one can stop four conquerors with eight fruits.” Someone from The Race asserted.

All in all, most couldn’t wait for the battle. Powerful ancient ancestors and dragon lords came to the mountain in order to watch.

Putting the implications aside, just observing the battle would be immensely beneficial for their dao.

Three days - a period that wasn’t too long or too short. Nonetheless, it took everyone’s breath away.

The only exception was Li Qiye who was relaxing in Eight-stallion. Alas, his peace was interrupted by someone who insisted on seeing him.

Li Qiye himself was surprised by the visitor - the current lord of Reincarnation, Qing Songke.

Li Qiye killed his father but also saved him twice. In reality, he had forgotten about the boy since he couldn’t remember all the people with grievances against him.
