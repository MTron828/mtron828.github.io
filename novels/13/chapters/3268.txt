“No need, I’m fine with Society Mantra.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

Daowei naturally didn’t know that South Fence couldn’t compare to the seven laws, at least the original versions that Li Qiye wanted.

He wouldn’t be the only one confused by this choice. Virtually everyone wanted the best mantras and merit laws possible.

Even a fool would know to pick South Fence over Society, the former being a high-level yellow mantra created by South Conch Dao Lord for beginners.

“Don’t you have the immortal laws?” Daowei pondered before suggesting: “You might not be able to cultivate them now but you can still exchange them for other merit laws, definitely some really strong ones.”

He was referring to the Nine Primeval Laws. The sect allowed for exchanges if one couldn’t cultivate something they already had.

“It’s fine.” Li Qiye shook his head.

Others needed to take it step-by-step, going from low to a high level for the merit laws. This didn’t affect Li Qiye.

“Oh, the famed cultivator of our sect is here?” A sarcastic voice suddenly interrupted them.

It was no other than Yang Si who had tried to cause trouble for Li Qiye previously. His posse also laughed right away.

They clearly came ill-intentioned, evident by the sneer on Yang Si’s face - an obvious showing of contempt.

Li QIye ignored them and picked out several books meant for light reading.

“Society?” Yang Si raised his brows before mocking: “Our sect’s genius can’t be picking this trash, right?”

His group naturally burst out in laughter afterward.

In reality, the two of them didn’t have a feud at the start. Yang Si was just annoyed at Li Qiye’s attitude during the recruitment process. This made him want to humiliate Li Qiye.

It was a bit different now since Yang Si was under orders to supervise Li Qiye. He took advantage of this and got closer.

Li Qiye’s brows slightly furrowed; his lips curled into a smile.

“He’s with Senior Brother Zhan Hu and got chosen by Furious Tiger.” Daowei quietly reminded Li Qiye. He didn’t want to mess with Yang Si.

Yang Si had a humble background but his talents weren’t bad. Zhan Hu taught him a bit after he joined the sect. Later on, he was recruited by Furious Tiger as well. This elevated his status in Jade Bird.

First, Zhan Hu was one of the most gifted cultivators of the present generation on top of having a noble background. Yang Si was his follower.

The other four peaks didn’t pick recruits from the outside. They would normally pick the descendants of their disciples then get the rest from Jade Bird. In a way, the other four peaks were one level higher than Jade Bird. The latter was the weakest on top of being the starting point for new recruits. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

On the other hand, Furious Tiger was once the strongest branch in Divine Black - old and had plenty of resources.

Li Qiye ignored the taunts but Yang Si purposely sought trouble.

“Don’t you have the amazing Nine Primeval Laws? Why are you picking Society Mantra now? Seems idiotic.” Yang Si pushed the issue.

“Senior Brother, he can’t cultivate the nine laws anyway given his shallow cultivation. He has to start from the basics.” A disciple nearby smiled: “So what else can he use but Society? Only a trashy mantra of this level is suitable for him.”

“Right, the nine laws are no different from waste paper in his possession.” Another snorted: “He’ll never be able to cultivate them.”

“Stop talking about our genius like that.” Yang Si laughed: “Maybe enlightenment will dawn on him one day and he’ll have supreme talents, able to learn the nine laws in one night. He’ll dazzle you guys then.”

“Haha, we’ll be eagerly waiting for that day...”

Of course, there were some spectators on the sideline as well. These students only wanted to watch out of spite and jealousy towards Li Qiye.

Daowei blinked at Li Qiye, gesturing for him to leave soon. It wasn’t wise for Li Qiye to clash with Yang Si right now due to their cultivation gap.

“Indeed, your dog eyes will go blind.” Li Qiye smiled and commented.

The smile and laughter stopped. They were clearly stronger than Li Qiye on top of having the number advantage. They were sure that he would stand there and take it instead of retorting.

Plus, his nonchalant attitude indicated his disdain for them. They naturally didn’t like it.

“Do you actually think you can cultivate the nine laws? You got lucky once but it won’t happen again. Maybe only in your dream, trash.” Yang Si barked back.

“Idiot.” Li Qiye wasn’t angry at all. Yang Si was no different than a speck of dust in his eyes.

Yang Si turned red after being called an idiot by Li Qiye whom he deemed inferior before his friends.

Everyone quieted down and stared at Li Qiye. The majority of disciples in Jade Bird were wary of Yang Si. They might not like him but wouldn’t dare to publicly call him an idiot.

The situation forced Yang Si to push the issue.

“Ignorant fool with no respect for your senior, I’ll teach you a lesson on how to be a proper disciple today.” Yang Si’s eyes flashed with murderous intent.

Daowei tugged on Li Qiye’s sleeve, once again telling him to leave lest something unfortunate were to happen.

“You’re finished. Come outside.” Li Qiye started leaving without looking at Yang Si.

Jaws dropped to the ground. People exchanged glances of bewilderment.

“You heard that, right? Is he insane?” One disciple asked.

Everyone could see that Li Qiye was a Mortal Shell while Yang Si was at Silver Carapace.

To put it bluntly, Yang Si could destroy Li Qiye with one hand. The two weren’t on the same level at all. That’s why Li Qiye’s claim seemed so ridiculous.

Daowei was stunned as well. This was a difference between two full realms - a gap akin to heaven and earth. How could Li Qiye ever take down Yang Si?
