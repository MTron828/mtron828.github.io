“Rawr!” One could hear the cries of beasts everywhere in this area, not just from the newcomers but also the skeletons crawling out of the ground.

They came with all shapes and sizes. Some were massive while other delicate. But this didn’t imply weakness for the latter. A few tiny ones were powerful enough to topple the large coinbeasts down and slay them.

“Rumble!” The miserable sounds of battle became inevitable along with screamings.

These skeletons began hunting the coinbeasts and intruders.

“Are these the remains of the coinbeasts?” Experts noticed something after seeing enough skeletons. A few pursuers looked just like the ones they’re riding.

“Looks that way.” Another added: “They’re not weaker than when they were alive at all. So strange.”

People didn’t know how these beasts have died. Was it from the last event or from a distant era?

“Why are they coming back to life?” Some were afraid because the eye sockets of these skeletons had a fiery glow, just like the fire of a soul.

“Hmm, is this a rebirth or are they mere puppets?” One old expert wondered.

The lack of answers frightened the crowd, especially the fact that these skeletons kept their power. A particularly terrible one killed more than twenty beasts and cultivators with a single slap.

Of course, some living coinbeasts were strong enough to slam the skeletons into pieces. They didn’t consider themselves to be the same species at al and conflicts waged on.

“The problem might be the land itself.” One ancestor elaborated: “Rumor has it that this place has something to do with eternal life, so the coinbeasts have a chance to live again. Of course, no one knows the validity of this statement but as we can see, these dead creatures are rising again.”

“Really...” Many ancestors felt their heart thumping faster.

After reaching a certain level and old age, these cultivators stopped caring about power. Eternal life became a fatal attraction instead. Thus, how could they not be interested in this land right now? Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Why are we here?” The ancestor smiled: “Obviously for the beast springs, same as all the beasts here. Maybe this has something to do with eternal life.”

However, this particular statement wasn’t wholly accurate. Not all beasts came for eternal life.

“Raa!” One creature let out a moving and tragic howl after finding the desired spot - a cliff. It then lowered its head and lay down.

After a long time, people became brave enough to come closer and tested its pulse.

“It’s dead.” They found that it died peacefully, resting its head on its paws just like a nap.

In fact, this wasn’t uncommon. Numerous beasts came to find a suitable place before passing away in this manner.

The cultivators naturally became surprised and perplexed.

“They came so far just to die?” One sect master murmured.

“So this is how the remains come to be? Maybe they die here for a chance of rebirth in this incredible land?” One expert recalled what an ancestor said earlier.

Perhaps reanimation as a skeleton was a different method to live again. Albeit, it would cease to be its former self.

This only excited the crowd even more after seeing a glimpse of immortality. A few took a risk and got down from their mounts in order to do more research.

One more objective of these beasts became clear to the crowd. They all heard a loud roar.

Another beast climbed up a precipice and made its way into a cave. A while later, the cave emitted a blinding light.

The brave came closer and saw a nest made out of straws with eggs in the center. They were as precious as gems, coveted by all.

“Beast eggs!” Someone shouted.

The beast earlier got inside and got on its stomach, ready to lay some eggs.

“It has to come here to give birth.” The beast’s goal became obvious to the crowd.

Some spectators lost patience and rushed in before the cave could close in order to seize the eggs.

“Boom!” The moment they got there, a massive claw came from above. A massive beast materialized in the sky and made mincemeat out of them, not giving them a chance to scream.

So it turned out that some beasts came to lay eggs while others were here to protect them.

Before the crowd could calm down, a creaking noise came as the cave began to close.

Some came specifically for these eggs, so to specifically see the process only made them more excited.

“The legend about Elucidation True Emperor is real, he really got a divine beast egg from this place.” People started believing this legend about the emperor and his Bi’an, the beast protector of Resting Bull.

“There’s a nest up on that mountain shrouded by clouds, three eggs in there too.” A short time later, someone found something new.

It didn’t take long before experts started gunning for the mountain.

“Boom!” Unfortunately, the guardian here was a skeletal beast. It slapped all of them into fleshy bits.

Nevertheless, the remaining cultivators didn’t give up and began a massive assault on this skeleton.

“Poof!” The beast spewed out waves of lava, queuing the wails of torment.

Events like this happened all over the land. People found eggs and others tried to seize it. However, the eggs were protected by both the living and dead beasts. Fewer than few managed to sneak off with their prize.
