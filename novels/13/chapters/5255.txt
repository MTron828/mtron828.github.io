Chapter 5256: Do Whatever You Want

The smash could instantly pulverize a five-fruit conqueror or ten-fruit dragon lord. Spectators still trembled despite being outside of Suppression Conqueror’s domain.

It had enough force to put an end to Imperial Attendant City without its defensive barriers activated.

“Boom!” The shockwaves flattened everything outside of the main impact point.

Alas, Li Qiye raised his hand and the gauntlet’s rays automatically stopped the staff. It didn’t leave a single mark on the gauntlet.

“Die!” Suppression’s expression darkened but he didn’t stop there. He raised the staff again and unleashed a flurry of swings. The staff became the source of a tornado.

However, within the violence were impressive techniques and variations. Each thrust and swing were deliberate with signs of reaching the apogee. The focus of energy varied unpredictably from a single point to a larger radius.

“Chaos Flurry!” Those outside of Imperial Attendant City felt the gales hitting all regions.

Weaker cultivators and mortals felt as if this was the end of the world. If the conqueror were to miss his mark and accidentally hit the domain barrier, it could result in immense destruction to the outside world.

He was rightfully proud of this technique because even twelve-fruit dragon lords were lost in amazement. Few could actually block all the strikes from beginning to end.

Resplendent Monarch and the others understood that they would have been powerless. The best of them could only last a few strikes before being reduced to a mist of blood.

Unfortunately, his opponent still didn’t move an inch. Just raising the gauntlet was enough to stop the tempestuous attack.

Eventually, Suppression finished all three thousand variations while going all out. He was a bit out of breath after expending a considerable amount of energy.

On the other hand, Li Qiye only raised his hand and didn’t put in any effort. Not a single bead of sweat could be found on him.

Suppression leaped backward and realized that his famous technique had done more harm to him than his opponent.

In the past, few adversaries were worthy of seeing the full variations. Twelve-fruit conquerors or dao lords would need to use their supreme merit laws and energy in order to block the entire sequence. This wasn’t the case here.

This made him wonder if a baby could have done the same as Li Qiye while wearing this magnificent gauntlet.

“This doesn’t make any sense.” Spectators murmured.

How could a weapon alone block the ultimate technique of a top conqueror? Alas, they witnessed it just now.

“I’ve never seen anything like it before.” Another added.

The top cultivators felt the same way with gleams of astonishment in their eyes.

“This is despair, right?” An expert asked.

A dragon lord revealed a bitter smile as he said: “I felt it twice just now, once when Suppression uses his Chaos Flurry, I knew that I would have been pulverized by it. Then after seeing Li Qiye just standing there, despair struck even harder the second time.”

They wondered if they had wasted their whole life trying to learn the strongest offense and the best defense.

“No wonder why everyone wants those giants.” A big shot commented after seeing the might of the combined gauntlet and metal giants.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“I don’t understand. What is this sorcery?” Suppression said with confusion.
