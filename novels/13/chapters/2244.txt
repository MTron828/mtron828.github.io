A brief lull passed by and Miaozhen stared at Li Qiye with a sincere look: “What if, and just what if something happens to the master, you won’t just sit there and watch, right?”

She sounded quite hesitant when asking this. Though she desired for the master to be fine, she needed to prepare for the worst. Someone needed to take over the position and in seniority, the next successor would be the First Disciple, or Li Qiye.

“Don’t worry, she’ll be just fine.” He consoled with a smile.

“I’m just hypothetically asking.” She took a deep breath and spoke earnestly. She was different than her two sisters in this regard, needing to think a lot more for the sect.

“Well, even hypothetically speaking, it won’t be my turn.” Li Qiye didn’t yearn after this position.

“But what if you can?” She stared at him without blinking.

“Little girl, your idea isn’t necessarily a good thing. I won’t be staying at your sect for long so don’t place your hope in me. You might just find yourself giving the sect to a devil, letting it fall into damnation.” He pinched her nose and said.

“Everything is possible, but I trust in Master’s vision, and you. I’m sure of it.” She calmly said.

He smiled at her sincerity and responded: “Don’t worry, I guess I will participate because a massacre is always fun.”

This was a type of promise to her. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“That’s good.” She tensed up into an enchanting smile.

Despite his current role right now, something told her that he didn’t care at all. He was just a guest that could leave at any moment. But now, with his promise of his, everything became different. She could count on him at this point.

“In a few days will be the conference meant for ceremonial worship. This has always been our sect’s responsibility with Master in charge. However, she can’t preside over it right now so it’ll be up to us. We sisters will take care of the minor things, but you need to watch over the whole thing and make decisions.” She happily said.

“So much time wasted just to get me to be the cannon fodder.” He slapped her buttocks and said: “Try this again with me and it won’t end as well as this time.”

“Pervert!” She leaped back, blushed, while giving him a mean glare.

“The ancestors can’t leave the valley right now. Normally, we and the elders can probably take care of this, but I don’t think Everlasting will take this sitting down, so that’s why we need you.” She added.

“I understand.” He leisurely said: “If we’re going to go all out, then we just need to be direct and destroy their nest.”

He was speaking as if he was only going to take down an ant colony, not the strongest sect under a system.

Nevertheless, his fierce attitude gave her peace of mind and more confidence, no longer worrying about Everlasting causing trouble.

The day of the ceremony came quickly. The three sisters and Li Qiye embarked towards this place called Alchemy Hut.

Miaozhen carried a great burden since it was up to the young generation. Because of animosity and schemes from Everlasting, the remaining ancestors couldn’t leave for the conference since it would leave the valley vulnerable to attack.

It was too much of a coincidence for the sect master to be ambushed right before this particular event.

This event was of utmost importance in the system with the majority of sects and clans participating. Though it was meant to worship the ancestors, it was also a way for Longevity Valley to remind everyone else of their position and control. Thus, only the orthodox branch could preside over the ceremony, openly telling everyone else that they are still in charge.

Due to the ambush, one particular development could have been Everlasting interfering with the ceremony due to the absence of the valley lord.

If Longevity Valley failed to maintain control, Everlasting would take over and no one else would dare to oppose this due to their current power. At that point, they would be one step closer towards seizing the reign of the system. Replacing Longevity Valley would only be a matter of time. This was why Miaozhen thought that someone was behind all of this. The timing of the ambush was too much of a coincidence.

Alchemy Hut was a sacred ground of the system, a place of pilgrimage. In a sense, it didn’t belong to anyone alone, not even Longevity Valley.

Thus, some considered it their ancestral ground. Many cultivators and alchemists journeyed to reach this place.

Of course, it was no hut. The place consisted of numerous mountain ranges, verdant hills, and waterfalls. Of course, one couldn’t forget about the trees and flowers.

Deeper inside were magnificent mountains floating in the sky, hidden behind the clouds. They had stone steps leading to the sky.

The largest one was in the very center and pierced straight up above just like a heavenly pillar. The sun and moon floated around it. One could see it from a thousand miles away.

Some believed that these floating mountains, especially the largest one, were the core of Alchemy Hut.

There was a peculiar poem about this location - A young apprentice was asked, where does your teacher find his herbs? The boy answered, in this mountain, somewhere among the clouds.

The mountain mentioned here was the one in the center. Rumor has it that Alchemy Immortal had cultivated, found herbs, and refined pills here. Some True Emperors and progenitors descended from Immortal Lineage just to ask him for medicine.

Of course, inferior beings came in droves as well. More often than not, Alchemy Immortal would avoid them by telling his followers to use the excuse that he was away finding more herbs.

Thus, this poem was famous during his generation. Everyone who wanted to ask for medicines thought about it.

As time passed by, the glory days didn’t return. Without Alchemy Immortal, the top beings no longer visited. Alchemy Hut became desolate unlike before.

Nevertheless, the cultivators in the system still considered this as their ancestral ground. Many alchemists would travel here at least once in their life. They all respected Alchemy Immortal, thinking that he had few peers in all of history.

The conference was about to begin and this added some life to the area. Many disciples from various powers have arrived early.

Longevity Valley prepared ahead of time. Their disciples were already here to greet people from all over the world.

When Miaozhen’s group showed up, many tasks have been carried out. This wasn’t their first time taking charge of this event so they were quite good at it.
