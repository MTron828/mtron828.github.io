Chapter 3767: Peerless Defense

The transcending youth walked out of the collapsed space, completely unharmed. Not even his robe was damaged; his hair was still perfectly tidied. He didn’t bother to block the previous move yet still nullified it.

The members of the holy ground became frightened. Even the ancestors took a deep breath.

The scion was sealed earlier by the chains before the barrage of arrows. This should have done something to him.

“It’s tough enough breaking down the draconic defense, let alone defeating him.” One ancestor solemnly said.

“Who in the holy ground can actually stop this monster?” An experienced big shot shuddered.

Not to mention the young generation, even some ancestors thought that they wouldn’t have been able to escape unscathed just now from Hu Ben’s plan.

“No wonder why there was a rumor of him beating Righteous Sect Master.” An expert murmured.

The sect master of Righteous was obviously powerful - the ruler of the land with great authority. Nonetheless, this youth bested him.

“Hu Ben has no chance.” This became apparent to the crowd.

In reality, this was obvious before the start of the fight. Hu Ben couldn’t match up with the scion in terms of power and cultivation.

Nonetheless, they remained relatively optimistic and clung to a sliver of hope. After all, Hu Ben was a famous genius and a capable commander who should have been able to last up to several hundred moves.

Unfortunately, they realized that the gap was too great after the start of the battle.

“Righteous Scion is untouchable in the young generation.” Others had no choice but to put their pride away and accept this reality.

“Not just the young generation, few in the previous generation can take him down.” One ancestor shook his head.

Silence and pessimism permeated the air. The youths of the holy ground felt as if there was something heavy pressing down on them.

The previous statement meant that the scion was at another level. If he could take another step forward, he would be similar to the four grandmasters.

Hu Ben pondered quietly while being stuck in this predicament. He had underestimated the scion’s power by a considerable margin.

He knew that defeat was inevitable. Alas, it was hard to get off a tiger. Giving up wasn’t an option now since he represented Vajra. This must go all the way.

“That was a decent attempt.” The scion floated up in the air, looking domineering: “But if that’s all you can do, I’m truly disappointed.”

He stared straight at Hu Ben but the rest of the crowd was affected as well. None thought that he was being arrogant at this point. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“I hope the other geniuses of the holy ground can have better plans.” He stated in a matter-of-fact manner, perhaps with no intention of insulting his opponent.

Alas, others construed it as disdain. Hu Ben was one of the four geniuses of the holy ground yet still didn’t earn any respect. This meant that other youths couldn’t get into the scion’s sight. They assumed that he was mocking them for being incapable.

Hu Ben’s expression soured. He has never been treated in this manner before.

Of course, the frustrated youths couldn’t do a thing since the scion’s power far exceeded theirs.

“Don’t worry, our fight is not finished.” Hu Ben said seriously: “The holy ground has plenty of capable cultivators. It’s just that I am lacking.”

Others approved of this message from Hu Ben and gave him a thumbs-up.

“I hope so.” The scion laughed: “Let us continue then, do you dare to accept one move from me?”

This froze the listeners, especially Hu Ben. From start to finish, the scion hasn’t done a thing. He assumed a passive state and merely let Hu Ben do whatever he wanted.

What would happen once he started attacking? Would Hu Ben be able to handle it?

Hu Ben felt his scalp tingling. He wanted to give up but the situation didn’t permit.

He took a deep breath and said: “We are ready to accept your attack.” He pointed out that it would be both him and his army working together.

“That’s fine, you can do as you please.” The scion said.

“We’re ready then.” Hu Ben felt better because they had the defensive advantage with the fortress around.

“Clank!” The scion immediately summoned a lance after Hu Ben finished speaking. It had a silver glow akin to the shine of bones. There was a tinge of gold as well.

The spectators became intimidated by its sharpness. They even heard a roar as if a White Tiger was in front of them.

“This lance’s name is White Tiger, it’s not a supreme weapon or anything but still presentable.” The scion introduced.

“How is this just presentable? It’s close to being a dao lord weapon. The third dao lord of Righteous created this for his disciple.” One ancestor blurted out.

“It belonged to a top sect master from Righteous once.” Another expert knew the history and power of this lance.
