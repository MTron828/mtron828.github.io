Chapter 5450: Ancient Princess

The monks accompanied by hallowed hymns were a sight to behold. They seemed to be leading Buddha back to the mortal world to deliver peace and salvation.

“Pure Land is joining this as well?” A dao lord understood that these were the greatest monks from that region. Regular monks didn’t possess these visual phenomena.

Pure Land was one of the seven great powers in the upper continents, perhaps the oldest.

The four alliances were relatively young and their history was known. As for Pure Land, it was rumored to have been around before the six continents. Some said that it dates back to the previous epoch.

Thus, little was known about its history and origin. Its power was also incalculable as well since it focused on salvation and spreading Buddhism. It didn’t participate in the struggle between The People and The Race since everyone was considered equal.

Because of this neutral stance, it had never displayed its true power and resources before. Nonetheless, most historians considered Pure Land to be stronger than any single alliance. Therefore, apex cultivators exercised restraint whenever they visited Pure Land.

In fact, Pure Land remained standing even during the perilous eras when Celestial Court reigned unchecked. The latter never provoked Pure Land previously - a testament to its power.

Legend told the tales of wondrous cultivators of Buddhism living there. They possessed powers and abilities beyond imagination.

Some went as far as saying that if Pure Land wanted to be in the immortal continent, it would be equal to Celestial Court, Immortal Dao City, and Imperial Field.

The magnificent spectacle resulted in the entrance of an otherworldly woman. She wore a Buddhist robe and an ancient crown while possessing a noble aura accentuated by the Buddhist affinity. This was a rare combination but it manifested flawlessly around her.

With just one glance, one would think of her as a supreme ruler in charge of countless beings. Of course, this wasn’t a rare sight because conquerors and dao lords would have something similar.

However, her Buddhist light and halos made her look like a natural-born Buddhist, destined to be enlightened. Who knows if this aura was innate or fostered by her profound knowledge of Buddhism? Either way, as she walked across the bridge, the two different affinities existed in harmony and caused others to gasp in astonishment.

An emperor reigned in the mortal world while a Buddhist transcended the mortal coil. These two paths typically ran counter to each other yet she managed to achieve something remarkable.

“Jilin Buddhist Emperor!” Someone immediately recognized her. [1]

“A truly timeworn existence.” Another commented while appreciating her beauty. The Buddhist robe didn’t hinder her physical attractiveness and only made her more unique.

Some said that one would be hard-pressed to find an older being than her in the upper continents. She was a peerless princess in the last epoch who chose to cultivate Buddhism.

Few had the pleasure to meet her in person but everyone knew about her legends. The most powerful being who had roamed the world from Pure Land was Meru Buddhist Emperor whom many believed to be Jilin Buddhist Emperor’s disciple. [2]

There were accounts of Blessed Dao Lord himself visiting Pure Land to ask Jilin Buddhist Emperor about the path of Buddhism.

All these tales told the world how unfathomable Pure Land and Jilin Buddhist Emperor were.

No one expected her to show up - a being older and more powerful than All-things Dao Lord and his peers. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

She didn’t show up during the previous Emperors War or during the signing of the Pact of Blessed.

“Which side will they be on?” A dragon lord murmured.

“The Imperial Clan and the Lu might be able to decide this battle but Pure Land will decide the entire war.” A powerful spectator believed that Pure Land alone outmatched the two clans.

After arriving, Jilin Buddhist Emperor simply observed the contest between the tower and the wall. Her stance remained unclear. The monks behind her closed their eyes, seemingly entering a state of meditation.

“Wait, if they do not interfere, I have no idea what the outcome will be.” Another commented after seeing the three powers merely spectating.

Meanwhile, the stalemate continued despite both sides’ full efforts in empowering their artifact.

“Boom!” Something suddenly exploded in the territory of Divine Alliance.
