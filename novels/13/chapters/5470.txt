Chapter 5471: Celestial Court’s Three Immortals

“I’m rather curious, who is your master in Celestial Court?” Li Qiye smirked while asking.

None expected him to shift the conversation. Strangely enough, his closest allies didn’t know the answer either.

His background was a mystery. Some believed that he came from Celestial Court but his allies didn’t think so. He was born in the upper continents as far as they knew. The journey remained unknown but he eventually made it to Celestial Court a a young age.

Another popular speculation included his being born in Celestial Court but was sent down to the upper continents for training.

Li Qiye’s question piqued everyone’s interest. Who was his master?

“I am just a junior fortunate enough to earn the love of the seniors in Celestial Court.” Supreme humbly answered.

Li Qiye shook his head and said: “You’re not fooling anyone. Nether Emperor and the likes are not worthy to be your master. His disciple wouldn’t be as trusted, in fact, he himself wouldn’t be given True Bones and this supreme momentum.”

“Senior Nether was once the Lord of Celestial Court, a true paragon.” Supreme didn’t answer directly.

Nether Emperor was an unfamiliar name now, only the oldest emperors and monarchs knew of him.

The current lord was Sword Emperor; Nether was his predecessor. Sword Emperor was a rising star and contributed greatly during Immemorial Epoch War. Nether abdicated afterward and gave his role to Sword.

Sword’s success also incited criticism and ridicule in secrecy. The reason was rather simple - his background.

Back during Time Immemorial, the Qian were branded as sinners by Celestial Court. Thus, they retaliated and led The People against the oppressors. Among their nine Heavenly Emperors, they had the unbeatable World Emperor and the brilliant Sword Emperor.

Unfortunately, Sword decided to join Celestial Court, going as far as destroying his own clan as the commander of the opposing side. His peerless contributions during the war paved the way for his ascension as the next lord.

Nonetheless, whispers of derision could be heard in the background regarding his traitorous behavior.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Of course, a few emperors and monarchs had no problem with this. After reaching a certain level, their originating sect and clan no longer mattered.

This happened rather often whenever someone ascended from the nine worlds or Eight Desolaces. Their ancestors could stand with The People but they chose to join The Race instead, resulting in an inevitable battle.

Now, everyone believed that Supreme’s master was either Sword or Nether Emperor. The former had an unmatched sword dao so he could teach Supreme the way of the sword. However, Li Qiye didn’t seem to think so.

“You have a different guess, Sir?” Supreme asked.

“Among the old monsters in Celestial Court, only four or so of them can actually show themselves. So one of the three immortals or that old man.” Li QIye said: “So tell me, which of the four is your master?”

Listeners became emotional after hearing this. In reality, outsiders didn’t know much about Celestial Court.

They were aware of supreme cultivators there such as Crimson, Nether, Heaven Burial, Light-dragon, and Sword. Anyone older was a mystery to them.

“Your words always hit the mark, Sir.” Supreme sighed and said: “I shouldn’t be opposing you but alas, I am bound by duty.”

He admitted that Li Qiye was correct. Unfortunately, listeners didn’t know anything about these four existences.

“The three immortals of Celestial Court.” Jilin Buddhist Emperor murmured, seemingly aware of these beings.

“I’ve heard of them.” All-things Dao Lord said with a hushed tone: “They were awakened when the duck egg buyer led the coalition all the way to Celestial Court.”

“Did they fight?” Hallowed Dao Lord asked with a serious expression.

All-things shook his head, unaware of the answer since he wasn’t involved in the war back then.

“The old geezer has legends too, but I think only two people have seen him before.” Swordsea Dao Lord joined in.

“Who are the two?” Ye Fantian asked curiously.

“Jiao Heng and Duality Master. Jiao Heng’s visit was too long ago for the details to be known, but Duality Master had visited, rumor has it they even shared a drink together.” Swordsea said.

“How strong is this cultivator?” Ye Fantian asked again.

“I do not know. From pieces here and there, there is a chance that he was the founder of Celestial Court. Of course, I have no solid evidence.”

“The founder of Celestial Court.” Ye Fantian was shaken since one could imagine his power after hearing this. How could he still be alive?

“Is this duty or just being a cannon fodder?” Li Qiye smiled while staring at Supreme.

“A great favor must be repaid by loyalty.” Supreme said: “Sir, you must step over my body first if you wish to destroy Celestial Court. My bones shall be the first step of your path.”

“You have good self-awareness among many other things, all valuable characteristics.” Li Qiye clapped and said: “Fine, put down True Bones and you may leave this place unscathed.”

Everyone took a deep breath. Someone of Li Qiye’s level didn’t need to bluster. Was he confident in defeating True Bones and killing Supreme?

They glanced at Supreme. Would he continue in spite of the odds?

“I am grateful for your affection, Sir. But, my devotion isn’t mere empty words.” Supreme shook his head.
