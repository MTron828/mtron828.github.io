Chapter 5451: Trembling In Horror

“Buzz.” Sharp rays pierced the sky around Divine Alliance, slightly resembling blades with a hook attached at the end. They could cut down anything, even time itself or the karmic cycle.

“It’s finally appearing.” Principle Conqueror sighed after seeing this.

“Ancestor, what are they?” A dragon lord of the Lu asked.

“Celestial Hook, an artifact secretly crafted by Divine Alliance with the help of Celestial Court.” Principle responded.

“Is it as strong as Celestial Tower?” The dragon lord became surprised.

“Each is useful in its own way. I’m afraid Dao and Imperial Alliance will be unable to stop this with the bulwark alone.” Principle concluded.

“They’re too close to Celestial Court now.” A conqueror said.

The majority of the Lu was once part of Divine Alliance. Under Principle’s leadership, Divine Alliance focused on peace and prosperity with The People.

Alas, older members of the alliance hailed from the three great races. Because of this, they naturally gravitated towards Celestial Court and Heaven Alliance.

This caused a rift between the Lu and them. In order to avoid needless bloodshed and remain neutral, Principle Conqueror abdicated. Swordsea Dao Lord, his successor, walked a different path than this and changed the direction of Divine Alliance.

This was a fair and legitimate succession so they didn’t face any opposition. With that, they were able to obtain Celestial Court’s help in creating a new artifact.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

It required special natural treasures and metals on top of blessings from top cultivators, capable of slaying emperors and conquerors. Principle had known of its existence and didn’t wish for his men to die fighting it.

“Boom!” The momentum in Divine Alliance finally gathered in one place and took the shape of a gigantic hook.

It pulsed with a frightening light. Each strand could cut down the stars. This was the highest culmination of sharpness.

Just looking at the hook alone caused spectators to feel a sharp pain in their eyes. This wasn’t due to the brightness of the rays but rather, the sharp affinity they exuded.

“What is this thing?” They lacked information on this artifact. Although they had seen sharp blades before, those weapons were dull and blunt in comparison.

“Be ready!” All-things shouted. His allies’ expressions soured as well.

The hook immediately latched onto the wall after manifesting into reality but didn’t activate its power just yet.

Haven Bulwark was known for being unbreakable by external force. The only thing in the upper continents capable of damaging it was Celestial Tower.

Both were made from priceless materials and augmented by the best of the best. They were equally matched, resulting in a delicate balance. Alas, there was an unprecedented development today.

A strange hum came from the hook, sounding ominous and chilling. This was akin to a sharp object grinding against a sheet of metal.

The hook’s sharpness couldn’t be bested. Nonetheless, it still couldn’t cut down the wall in a short time.

Nonetheless, the inexhaustible force behind the hook began to make an incision on the wall while leaving a piercing grind.

This was an unfavorable development for The People because after all this time, the tower couldn’t visibly damage the wall. Now, it seemed that a breakthrough was only a matter of time.

“Rumble!” The tower focused its power on the deep mark, striking it with the utmost force in order to help the hook.

The world trembled incessantly before their onslaught. Living beings in the upper continents suffered under the weight of the tower, feeling as if they were being struck as well. Some vomited blood, unable to endure for much longer.

“No more… no more…” They trembled in horror, not wanting to perish in this manner.
