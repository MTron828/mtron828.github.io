Chapter 5629: I Will Go With You

Li Qiye and Demon Conqueror entered Empress Star to see a unique sight.2

The heavenly rays pulsed continuously, making them feel like this was a different world. Looking back down would show them how far they had left Thousand Emperor Island. This star seemed to be hanging as high as possible, infinitely close to the high heaven.0

Demon carefully sensed the suppressive power of the star. She had done so several times in the past but there was a distinct difference.0

Before this, she could sense a supreme existence looming above them. Now, standing inside added a new facet to this power - a heavenly might.0

She understood why it was so difficult to overcome the suppressive aura. It seemed to come from heaven itself.0

“The empress’ cultivation is different from ours.” She commented.0

“Not different, just a metamorphosis. She had walked on the same path as you all but after entering heaven, she gained a new power and brought it back.” Li Qiye shook his head.2

“Heaven… Your Excellency, do you mean?” She trembled after hearing this.0

She had heard stories about this before when she was younger. The storyteller was none other than Li Qiye.0

Due to her age and lack of knowledge, she didn’t quite understand the stories and their significance.0

After reaching the apex of the grand dao and obtaining dao fruits, she gained a different perspective.0

After all, she had never forgotten a single word that came from him. They were her dearest memories, not to mention the implications hidden within.0

“So the empress went up there and came back.” She said.4

“She has always been amazing and determined.” He sighed at first before revealing a smile.0

Those who knew Li Qiye rarely saw him smile like this - a smile of pride.6

“No wonder.” She understood the suppressive force at this point and asked: “Your Excellency, do you wish to go too?” 0

“Yes, it’s just a necessary stop, not the final destination.” He glanced upward and nodded.0

“I will go with you, Your Excellency.” She said with hopeful eyes, looking more like a little girl in Li Qiye’s presence than a feared apex conqueror.0

The pair of wings covered and protected her. Its warmth allowed her to sleep in peace. Without him, even if she had somehow survived the onslaught, the traumatic events would have haunted and drove her insane.0

“It’s a tough road.” He caressed her cheek and shook his head: “We will face darkness one day and might be overwhelmed.” 0

“I understand, Your Excellency, but I am willing to face it.” She said with a determined gaze.0

He smiled wryly and said: “I don’t hope for you to go down this path because the current you right now is perfect enough. This perfection might be shattered when they show up and fear might envelop your mind again if you follow me.” 0

She shuddered after hearing this, recalling the gruesome battlefield and the near-death experiences.0

“I endured countless hardships during my cultivation because I wish to confront my fear and the darkness. This was the lesson you imparted to me, Your Excellency.” She said.0

“You don’t need to endure further suffering. You’re doing well now.” He sighed.0

“Your Excellency, you have never been one to retreat, so why do you advise me against progressing forward? I have not walked far enough on this path, please do not discourage me.” She looked at him.0

He stared at her face and recalled the weeping child surrounded by corpses and blood. She was so fragile and scared with a deathly pale complexion - a heart-wrenching sight.0

“Because you didn’t have to go through any of this.” He said.’0

“But it happened already. I know you want the best outcome for me, not wanting me to face pain and trauma again. Nonetheless, you brought me to the light and I wish to follow you, Your Excellency.” She held his hand.0

He patted her face and said: “I will always be moving forward. You might not be able to see me as you walk and that’s when the darkness will come.” 0Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“I know all of this, Your Excellency. Even if I can’t see your figure on this endless road, I know that you are ahead so I just need to follow your footsteps and I’ll be able to see you again. You will always be there.” She nodded solemnly.
