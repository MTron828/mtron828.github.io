Chapter 5374: Dao Process

“Buzz.” Chaos true energy surged under the blue sky, seemingly drawn toward the same place.

A power was ignited but this was only the start. This ignition process repeated several times, causing violent influxes of energy waves. Doing so required commendable determination.Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

This cultivation attempt alerted others. Ancestors, lords, and even dragon lords and conquerors became interested.

They saw a girl meditating with her hair draping downward, looking like a villager. Her physical appearance wasn’t exceptional compared to her immaculate aura. As she sat there, she seemed to be the center of the universe. Everyone had no choice but to pay attention to her.

“Ye Fantian!” Most recognized her instantly.

Chaos light flashed around her but disappeared immediately - the sign of an ignition process. At first glance, she seemed to be failing but powerful cultivators could sense the fluctuation in the world.

The energy all around them was rushing in her direction and entering her body. Eventually, cultivators even felt their internal energy being dragged out of their body.

Fortunately, since the ignition was failing, their energy returned. They heaved a sigh of relief as a result.

“What is she doing?” Some didn’t understand her motive.

“She’s trying to prove her dao right now.” An ancestor said with a serious expression.

“This is it, she’s finally embarking on the journey.” No one was surprised to hear this.

The Three Tians of the upper continents were wonderful geniuses who were talented enough to surpass the previous generation.

No one doubted Ye Fantian’s talent. They were just confused regarding her stagnation compared to her peers. Xiao Qingtian and Li Zhitian both had twelve sacred fruits already.

“I know what she is doing, she’s trying to obtain twelve fruits in one go.” A conqueror saw the hints after seeing the ignitions.

This astounded listeners. They could tell that this ignition process was challenging and of course, becoming a conqueror wasn’t that simple. However, she was trying to obtain twelve dao fruits in one go.

“Just like Light-dragon Conqueror back then?” Everyone became emotional.

Their upper continents had produced numerous brilliant cultivators previously, one of which started an unprecedented path - Light-dragon obtaining twelve dao fruits in one go.

He was Heaven Alliance’s founder and Celestial Court’s favorite. His success during his ascension shocked the entire world. From then on, people understood that at the very limit of cultivation, finishing the fruits in one go was possible.

“Back in Time Immemorial, we had Light-dragon Conqueror and his twelve fruits then Genesis Conqueror needing just one fruit, two new paths for future generations.” A dragon lord sentimentally reflected.

“Who has left the greater legacy between the two?” A genius asked.

Light-dragon and Genesis Conqueror were two pillars of the upper continents. Their legacy became tablets for others to study.

Genesis Conqueror was not inferior to the great Light-dragon. She founded Imperial Alliance and some believed that she had served as the protector of Imperial Field as well.

Everyone during Time Immemorial knew that a conqueror or dragon lord could possess twelve fruits. They could either take their time or obtain all twelve in one go. The latter was virtually impossible due to its difficulty.

Several eras later, Genesis Conqueror did something entirely different - just creating a single dao fruit.

This broke the pre-existing paradigm of the more fruits, the more power - if one didn’t have twelve fruits, they wouldn’t be able to obtain an immortal shell to reach anima.

Genesis Conqueror with her one dao fruit did all of that and became one of the strongest conquerors in the world. Her choice astounded everyone and created a new path.

Of course, this was a rather difficult one and still hasn’t been fully duplicated. 

Other notable users of only one fruit included Puresun Dao Lord, Luminous Conqueror, Immortal Pagoda Conqueror, and Nightmoon Conqueror.

However, this wasn’t because they purposely chose one fruit but rather - they had one primordial fruit.

This was more than enough because these fruits were unsurpassable. There was no need to obtain more afterward.

Thus, Genesis Conqueror was rather unique in her success. She focused on refining the single fruit and eventually obtained anima.
