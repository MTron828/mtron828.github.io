Chapter 5237: Eat This

Once the visual phenomenon dissipated, the tree looked the same as before. Only top conquerors and dao lords could sense its indiscernible aura.

The only difference was people’s perception - everyone wanted it now. In fact, the moment the tree was activated, numerous eyes opened to take a look, whether they be out in space or deep in the abyss…

They were horrifying and could change the physical fabric of the world. Alas, no one made a move due to various reasons.

Perhaps some thought that the tree couldn’t be repaired while others might be hesitating because of something else entirely.

Boss Tang successfully captivated the crowd by showing the tree’s potential. Despite its flaws, the values were still immeasurable with everlasting life as a potential goal.

“Okay, let’s start the bidding.” Boss Tang was rather pleased with himself as he announced: “If you can tempt me with your treasure, it will be yours. Otherwise, I’ll just keep it.”

The apex cultivators thought that their treasures might not be enough to make it an even trade. Tempting the boss this time might be virtually impossible.

Among the buyers were the strongest lineages and alliances in the upper continents. If they couldn’t do it, no one else could.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The question was - what do they have to offer him right now?

“What do you want?” Jue Xian’er coldly uttered - asking the question that was on everyone’s mind.

“It would be nice if I know the answer.” Boss Tang stroked his chin and said: “It depends on what you all have to show me.”

“Boss Tang, here is the deal. You say the words, Heaven Alliance will carry it out.” Li Zhitian said.

He couldn’t come up with an equivalent treasure to match the tree so he decided to go another route. Of course, this wasn’t a joke since it represented an unbreakable promise from Heaven Alliance.

“Hah, no need for that.” Boss Tang waved his hand and said: “I’m afraid I will outlast your alliance.”

Those from Heaven Alliance changed their expression since this was a bad omen. However, Boss Tang didn’t have a problem offending anyone.

“I see.” Li Zhitian didn’t become angry.

The other participants could see that Boss Tang only wanted to do an exchange, not needing any promises.

“Okay, the auction ends here.” Suddenly, their contemplation was interrupted by someone.

An ordinary youth appeared among the thrones; no one saw how he got there. Who else could it be but Li Qiye?

The three geniuses recognized him but didn’t know what he was up to. Boss Tang couldn’t believe his own eyes after seeing the newcomer.

“!” Omniscient Dao Lord got out of his throne in disbelief.

Skysword Dao Lord was surprised as well. As for the others, they couldn’t believe someone was audacious enough to interrupt Boss Tang’s auction.

“Who are you?!” Suppression Conqueror’s eyes exuded an intimidating light.

Li Qiye chuckled and grabbed Boss Tang’s warship, pointing it in the direction of Suppression as if it was a cannon.

“Boom!” He somehow successfully ordered it to fire.

Everyone had seen its power previously. Thus, Suppression immediately leaped into a different dimension while his throne was blown into smithereens.

“I warned you to leave.” Li Qiye released the ship and patted the dirt off his hands.

“So it’s you.” Suppression’s voice echoed back, causing weaker cultivators to drop down to their knees.

As for Boss Tang, he jumped back on the ship and it leaped into the air, ready for a spatial jump.

“That’s it for the auction, friends.” He said while escaping.

“Where are you going?” Li Qiye smiled and took one step forward, disappearing from sight.

Those left behind stood there in a daze. There was no chance of them catching up to Boss Tang so the dream of obtaining the immortal tree was over.

“What the hell just happened?” Everyone became confused at the abrupt end.

“Gentlemen, let’s take a break? Allow me to play the part of a good host.” Suppression Conqueror calmed down and invited the others.

“I appreciate your invitation but I have important matters to take care of.” The others seemed interested in sticking around but Omniscient Dao Lord - clearly shaken by something - cupped his fist and left with haste.
