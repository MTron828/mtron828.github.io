Chapter 5708: Full Force

“March!” An order was given and so the horns of war began.

Legions marched to various islands, preparing to separate Imperial Field.

“To arms!” Defenders prepared amply and activated imperial defense. The group included Divine Luan, Sindragon, Thousand-hand, Halo, and many others... [1]

“Rumble!” The momentum of Imperial Field was ready. The defenders’ auras surged into the air and became one with it, building barriers to prevent the invaders from landing.

Imperial Field revealed its superior power compared to Dao City which fell quickly before the armies of Celestial Court.

Imperial weapons and artifacts danced in the air as both sides launched the fiercest assault. Tsunamis and hurricanes could be seen everywhere. Absolute devastation was imminent to the region.

Screams and corpses filled the region, and blood stained the ocean red. The carnage had no end in sight.

However, it seemed that the barriers of Imperial Field couldn’t be broken after many waves of attack - a repeat of Grand Dao War.

“Full Force!” Resolute Conqueror ordered after seeing the unbreakable momentum.

“Rumble!” A resplendent heavenly beam empowered him.

His armor radiated magnificently as he turned into an armored giant several times stronger than before.

“To formation!” Just-once, Nine-wheel, War, and Armament appeared behind him.

“I’m coming!” Immortal Emperor Fu Mo stopped trying to defeat Calamity Dao Lord. His relentless offense with the anima staff was useless against this ultimate defense. This was akin to a ferocious beast unable to harm a turtle once it had retracted inside its shell.

“Boom!” His hellish world of refinement imbued a totemic marking onto Resolute’s armor.

“Initiate!” The apex cultivators roared and activated their power. Their lights became a part of the armor first before a complete fusion.

With this, the various blessings of Celestial Court consolidated into a single being seamlessly.

“On my way!” Immortal Emperor Zhuo Huo also turned into an imperial flame and joined the formation.

“Rumble!” Just like that, a mechanical giant of incomprehensible size appeared.

The vast ocean only reached its ankles and the islands of Imperial Field looked as tiny as tangerines in comparison. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Boom!” A unique imperial flame gushed forth from its engines, issuing thunderous detonations causing space to tremble.

The ignition caused the machine to illuminate with a celestial glow and imperial flames - a combination of endless power.

Members of Imperial Field looked up in awe. They didn’t expect the opponents to imbue Celestial Court’s blessings with the help of Immortal Emperor Fu Mo’s refinement ability into a single being. Next, the flames of Immortal Emperor Zhuo Huo served as fuel for the engines, continuously giving it more power.

“Isn’t this the machine from Imperial Attendant?” Niu Fen murmured before shouting: “Hey, you thieves! Did you get this from Imperial Attendant?”

“No, this is a secret art passed down by our lord.” Resolute answered thunderously.

“You did not have this during the last war.” Demon said.

“That’s why I said that times are changing.” Immortal Emperor Zhuo Huo responded.

“So the old geezers are involved this time.” Niu Fen’s expression soured.

Demon and the other apex cultivators had a serious expression. They knew that Celestial Court had frightening cultivators, either hiding or slumbering.

These beings did not participate during the last war but it seemed different this time.

Niu Fen had spent time in Imperial Attendant and knew the origin of the giants - an epoch known as Machine.

However, this epoch was long gone. According to Li Qiye, it fell to a being known as Epoch’s End. He thought that this was a lost art to all except for Li Qiye.

Now, it became obvious that Resolute’s group was taught this method after the last war.
