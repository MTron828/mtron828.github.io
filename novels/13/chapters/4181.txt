Chapter 4182: Courting Death

Void Ancestor felt as if something had just struck his chest. He roared and entered a defensive stance, being shrouded by a radiance.

“Even Earthraiser Vajra wouldn’t dare to say this about Daoist Sword Ground.” Tie Jian suddenly calmed down and said.

Void Ancestor and the members of Nine-wheel became frightened because Tie Jian was just too strong. Just his glare alone was suppressive, meaning that his cultivation was at least one full realm above them.

Earthraiser Vajra was their stronger ancestor, a member of the Five Overlords. Few dared to call out his title in a casual manner. Most would refer to him as “senior” and show nothing but reverence. Tie Jian, on the other hand, spoke as if they were on the same level.

Void Ancestor thought about the possibilities. Those daring to talk about the Five Overlords like this could be counted with one’s fingers. Unfortunately, he didn’t have an answer for Tie Jian’s identity.

Chen Cangsheng shared the same difficulty. He knew that Tie Jian was somehow related to his sect. However, the only match should be their strongest ancestor - War God. Alas, he was certain that Tie Jian was not War God.

“Boom!” Debris flew everywhere as the princess got out of the pit. She looked to be in a sorry state with her dress torn and bloodied in multiple places. She suffered internal injuries as well, no longer appearing as beautiful and noble as before.

“Allow me to announce the victor of this fight, Chen Cangsheng.” Li Qiye calmly said.

“Shut up!” The embarrassed princess angrily bellowed.

Losing to Chen Cangsheng was humiliating for someone as prideful and conceited as her. Though he was a member of the Ten Sword Prodigies, she previously believed that only the top-ranking members such as Abyss Scion could be her match. After all, she has access to the Void Wheel - a secret from a heavenly scripture.

Today, he defeated her using the sword dao of Just-once Dao Lord, not the War God Sword Dao.

Therefore, she had the upper hand in merit law yet she still lost. This was adding insult to injury. Now, Li Qiye poured salt on her wounds by announcing the victor.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

“Can’t accept a loss?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Li, shut your mouth if you want to live a little longer. Our sect can end your dog life whenever we want!” She gritted her teeth.

“Your comment just now has guaranteed your demise.” Li Qiye smiled instead of becoming angry.

“You’re the one courting death!” She immediately attacked due to her agitated state.

“Buzz.” She manipulated space and the wheel artifact appeared in front of Li Qiye.

“Ugh…” Unfortunately, it stopped spinning right before decapitating him. Somehow, Li Qiye managed to grab her throat and immobilize her. She couldn’t channel her energy and vitality to control the wheel any longer.

Her eyes were wide open in disbelief, unable to see how Li Qiye managed to evade her attack and went on the counteroffensive.

“Stop!” Void Ancestor roared after seeing his beloved disciple captured.

Li Qiye ignored him and smirked at the princess: “I spared you once yet you’re still foolish enough to court death. No one can save you today.”

“If, if-if you dare to touch a hair of mine, Nine-wheel Citadel will exterminate your clan!” She turned red and had trouble speaking.

“I like it when people say that, it makes me feel like I actually have a clan. Unfortunately for you, I’m always the one doing the extermination.” Li Qiye said then added strength to his fingers.

“Crack!” Her neck bones started breaking.

“Mas-master, save me!” She no longer possessed the same courage as before and pissed her pants.

“Brat, release her!” Void Ancestor created countless wheels flying towards Li Qiye.

“Clank!” A slash made the nine firmaments tremble. Tie Jian easily destroyed the incoming wheels.

Void Ancestor rapidly retreated but blood still spilled from his chest. It wasn’t fatal but his bones became visible.

“Don’t interfere with our young noble’s business.” Tie Jian uttered coldly.

“Crack!” The princess’ neck broke completely. Her eyes rolled around before uttering one last cry.

He loosened his grip and released her corpse: “It’s astonishing how blind confidence kills.”

The princess never expected to be killed in this manner. She was aware of his numerous methods and that she alone stood no chance. She thought that her sect’s prestige would be enough to deter him from killing her. Unfortunately, her assessment was proven to be incorrect.

“You!” Void Ancestor and the other experts glared at Li Qiye. This was a blatant declaration of war.

Li Qiye chuckled and waved at them.

“Leave, don’t overestimate yourself.” Tie Jian told them.

“Very well, we will not forget the transgression today. We will have our retribution one day.” Void Ancestor gritted his teeth and stomped on the ground before picking up her corpse.

He naturally wanted to avenge his fallen disciple. However, Tie Jian was just too strong. Nonetheless, there were other ancestors from their sect tagging along this trip. It wouldn’t be too late to try a different time.

Chen Cangsheng smiled wryly after seeing this. He was one of the first to know Li Qiye; his first impression was that this guy was rather easy to get along with. Alas, after the action started, Li Qiye wasn’t one to show mercy. This was truly frightening.

He then remembered something else and got on his knees: “Your disciple, Chen Cangsheng, greets you, Ancestor.”

The previous bow was to show his appreciation for Tie Jian’s guidance. This time was to show respect as a junior.

“Ling Jian has done a terrible job at teaching you, hindering your progress.” Tie Jian said flatly.

Ling Jian was Cangsheng’s master and one of the Six Sect Masters.

“It is all due to my lack of intelligence, unable to learn more than ten percent of what Master had taught me.” Chen Cangsheng hurriedly defended his master.

“Don’t defend him.” Tie Jian said, basically admitting that he was a member of Daoist Sword Ground by continuing the conversation.

“Hmm…” Snowcloud Princess has been quietly watching to the side. Her love for learning resulted in her possessing more knowledge than the majority of last-gen cultivators.

A light flashed in her head as she thought of someone.
