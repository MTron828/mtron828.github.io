Chapter 5635: Power Of The Curse


“Why did Lightning Realm appear?” Sindragon was still traumatized by the experience.

He had entered forbidden zones and other perilous locations previously. Although he didn’t sweep through them, he still left unscathed. 

He never expected Lightning Realm to be so dangerous. His fate would have been worse than death - becoming a puppet dragon forever.

“It wasn’t formed at one time, several circumstances and fortunes culminated into this dangerous ground.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Is it really blood?” Sindragon glanced at the ocean and asked, thinking that it wasn’t the case: “Blood shouldn’t be like this, not even the blood of an emperor or true immortal.”

“Yes, it has the power of a curse, a bloodline that shouldn’t exist.” Li Qiye sighed softly.

“Sacred Teacher, are you referring to the legends? Then there is more than just one bloodline.” Sindragon shuddered.

“Yes, this particular one flourished once in the nine worlds and Eight Desolaces. After a period of decline is a resurgence.” Li Qiye smiled and gazed into the distance.

“Are you referring to a human bloodline?” Sindragon recalled the past and pursed his lips, murmuring: “The flavor is similar.”

“Sounds like you have eaten many humans.” Li Qiye gave him the side eye.

“Well, it was a mistake. I did some ridiculous things when I was younger and am truly ashamed. If it wasn’t for my master changing my way, I would have been killed long ago in infamy.” Sindragon had an awkward expression as he responded.

As an evil dragon, he had done plenty of heinous crimes before. Eating humans was naturally one of them.

Li Qiye didn’t chastise him because villains or dao lords, both had done more than their fair share of killing before. It wasn’t uncommon for a dao lord to destroy an entire kingdom once or twice.

“This is a unique scent, rumor has it that its source is evil.” Sindragon said.

“Not just a human bloodline but also the blood.” Li Qiye said: “Someone performed a grand experiment that wasn’t permitted by the high heaven.”

“Mixing bloodlines, right? It must have been a wicked method to be forbidden.” Sindragon said.

Normally, mixing bloodlines was not a problem. The simplest method was copulation between the two races to produce mixed offspring.

“One is a traceback to Blood Forefather and the other is Human-monarch. The research gave birth to a different bloodline.” Li Qiye said.

“One of the four immortal bloodlines? It was said to be a gift from the high heaven, extremely pure.” Sindragon took a deep breath.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

The four immortal bloodlines only appeared on the thirteen continents. The nine worlds and Eight Desolaces weren’t qualified to have them.

Human-monarch, Heaven-authority, Devil-bestowment, and Divine-eternal were still known in the current six continents.

“Does that mean Human-monarch had appeared in the nine worlds long ago?” Sindragon speculated.

“It’s an interesting matter. Heaven-authority, Devil-bestowment, and Divine-eternal are derivations of one bloodline, Human-monarch stands alone.” Li Qiye said.

“Did someone try to combine Human-monarch and Blood, casting it down to the nine worlds?” Sindragon said quietly.

The lineage of the Blood Race was an ominous one, rumored to have started from evil creatures.

“Many are bold and believe they can be creators. One starts and others follow, seeking to emulate the path even with the Human-monarch bloodline.” Li Qiye said.

“I heard legends regarding the origin of the Blood Race, but I’m sure you possess the most knowledge about it, Sacred Teacher. Did it actually appear?” Sindragon asked.

“Yes, others wanted to duplicate Lord of Derivation’s success, another experiment with hidden bloodsuckers.” Li Qiye said.

“Them again.” Sindragon smiled wryly.

The Blood Race was the creation of Lord of Derivation - the offspring between the overlords and the unknown creatures hidden in the darkness.

Others attempted to copy him, this time using the Human-monarch bloodline. These evil bloodsuckers were rather unlucky to be used twice for creation experiments.

“Putting the mysteries and secrets aside, the second bloodline isn’t as perfect as the Blood Race. There are lingering side effects but it still became a branch of the Blood Race later on.” Li Qiye sighed softly.

Sindragon listened attentively and felt that there was something amiss.

“The bloodsuckers should only be in the six continents or the old thirteen continents, the same for Human-monarch. Why did this experiment appear in the nine worlds?” He asked.

“The truth is that it was born in Celestial Court.” Li Qiye said.

“Celestial Court?!” Sindragon was shocked to hear this: “How did they get the Human-monarch bloodline?”

“You don’t know this but Celestial Court was the first to have someone with the Human-monarch bloodline.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“...” The powerful dao lord became emotional and said: “I thought the first was the legendary Six-dao Human Monarch.”

Rumor has it that this blessed bloodline manifested into Six-dao Human Monarch, allowing him to become virtually unbeatable.

“That’s later, and the world comes to know of it. The bloodline appeared far earlier than that.” Li Qiye said.
