Chapter 5491: Bind Me

“But this is the best-case scenario, are you privy to the history of this matter?” He asked.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“I only know a little bit, Sir.” She took a deep breath.

“Perhaps you know about the possibilities but never saw it happening.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Are you referring to the ancient ming?” She put on a serious expression.

“Although you may be considered an utter failure like a pile of mud, you should know that the ancient ming’s final form is modeled after you.” Li Qiye nodded.

“I have perused many ancient texts and delved into their history.” Her serious demeanor was just as captivating as her smile.

“The scrolls contain little information.” Li Qiye said.

“Sir, you believe I possess characteristics of the ancient ming?” She asked.

“I know that you do but I can see that you have been diligently purifying what needs to be purified. Now, your form is far more brilliant.” He said.

“So is there anything else you’re still worrying about?” Her eyes shimmered with radiance as she stared at him.

“I suppose I do not when it comes to you. If your pursuit is self-improvement, I don’t have a problem with you continuing this dao path.” Li Qiye said.

“I appreciate your sparing my life, Sir.” She bowed.

“It is due to your own effort and what you deserve. If you had kept any of the cleansed characteristics, I wouldn’t have shown mercy.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I understand, I will definitely try my best to reach the ultimate state and not let you down, Sir.” She said.

“The current issue is not about whether you can reach this state. From what I can see, it is only a matter of time due to your mindset.” Li Qiye said.

“The procreation issue.” She sighed and said: “That is the source of your concern.”

“I can deal with it by stripping that bone from you, won’t be difficult at all.” He smiled while continuing to walk forward.

She shuddered but eventually calmed down and gritted her teeth: “Sir, I am willing to let you take it.”

Her eyes were filled with resolution and sincerity, ready to accept the consequences.

“If I had wanted to, I wouldn’t wait until now. I hope you don’t think you can survive a single move of mine.” Li Qiye said.

“Please excuse my ignorance.” She thought carefully and realized that Li Qiye was right. She would have been reduced to ashes without having a chance to even see the attack.

“Then you must have a method to bind me and the bone, being the true immortal that you are.” She said.

“Yes, there are methods but doing so will prevent you from reaching the ultimate state.” He nodded.

“And that is perfectly fine with me, I am willing to be bound even if it is for eternity.” She said solemnly. Perhaps this was her destiny; there was no escaping it.

Alas, Li Qiye kept on walking, prompting her to catch up eventually.

“Sir?” She didn’t understand.

“Humans are different from animals, we possess intelligence and wisdom like no others and most importantly, self-awareness.” He said.

“Self-awareness and a desire to return to the true self?” She asked.

“Yes, so if that happens for you, there won’t be any problem. All dao lead to the same path so you just have to find the proper way to do so. Sealing you doesn’t solve the root issues, letting you attempt to reach your true self does. At that point, it will solve the seduction affinity on top of the procreation issue.” He said.

“I will not let you down, Sir.” She bowed and said.

“Don’t worry about what I want, just focus on how you will perfect yourself. Nothing else matters, it is a personal journey.” He said.

“I am clear on what I need to do now, Sir.” She said. There was a flashing light in her mind, guiding her to the next path.

“Although I can just raise my hand and end this, I will not bind you. Reach your ultimate state and cleanse this procreation gift. I do have to let you know that if I ever see you wavering, I will…”

“Sir, you can reduce me to ashes and leave no traces of me in this world then.” She interrupted.

“I’m glad we are clear on this.” He nodded.

“I will not forget my goal.” She said with determination, reminding herself and promising Li Qiye.

“I hope so.” He smiled and dropped the issue, wanting to give this woman a chance to solve the problems.

Of course, this was far from simple and required an unyielding dao heart. Any wavering could cause her to become a true calamity to the world.

He could kill her right now and rid himself of a potential problem. Nonetheless, he chose to give her a chance and she knew this.

“There is another matter outside of my problems, Sir.” She said.

Li Qiye stopped and she handed him an item: “I heard that when you last were around, you had many followers. Back when Celestial Court was infiltrated, I saw an injured lady being sent flying into a river.”

“Bai Jianzhen.” He knew who it was right away.

“I am far from being the strongest in Celestial Court. Because the other emperors were nearby, all I could do was force her into a deep hibernation.” She elaborated: “I cannot bring her out without being detected, so if you take this to Celestial Court, you’ll be able to save her.”

“Your action is appreciated.” He accepted the item and smiled.

She saved Bai Jianzhen’s life by putting her into a slumber, feigning her death in the process. Otherwise, she wouldn’t have survived the onslaught of the emperors and monarchs in Celestial Court.

“I am willing to offer my service, Sir, although I’m worried that I’m too weak to be of use to you.” She added.
