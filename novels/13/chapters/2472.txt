“If there is really a fortune happening at the lakes this time, we aren’t really qualified to compete against Miss Qin.” Someone sighed sentimentally after seeing her.

Some were naturally happy to see Qin Jianyao but others felt great pressure instead. If she came specifically for the color-changing lakes, then no one could really match her.

It wasn’t because they were unduly humble but she was just that strong. To be more specific, Calm Lotus Monastery’s strength exceeded people’s imagination.

On the surface, it was one of the five great powers and should have similar power. This wasn’t the case.

The older experts knew that Calm Lotus was far above the rest. Both the Bingchi and Myriad Formation Kingdom, even Waterfront Pavilion - all far inferior.

Remember, outside of War Saint Dynasty, Calm Lotus was the only other lineage with two secret words. Their foundation and real capabilities were no joke.

Before Lucidity King, the previous rulers of the system were related to Calm Lotus in one way or another. Though this sect rarely grasped the central authority or took the throne, it had helped many previous rulers. In this manner, it also controlled the overarching direction of the system.

This continued on for a very long period of time until Lucidity King. Calm Lotus’ influence gradually lessened before disappearing altogether.

Nevertheless, they were still very powerful and might have been the only lineage capable of fighting against War Saint Dynasty during its golden age.

“A new king is in order.” An old cultivator sighed after seeing Qin Jianyao.

Given their past history, Calm Lotus would, sooner or later, groom another ruler. So now, when the reclusive Qin Jianyao is traveling the world, perhaps she was looking for a new royal successor.

Her destination was Great Desolate Mountain this time.

“Why is she heading to Great Desolate?” People were surprised because the current king was staying there.

“Are you forgetting that she is engaged with the king?” Another whispered.

The crowd didn’t expect this. Those who have a crush on her were devastated upon hearing this. People have forgotten about this matter until now.

“Hmph, that guy has lost his kingdom so the marriage pacts are no longer in effect.” A genius who likes her scowled.

“Not necessarily.” An instigator took advantage of the situation: “Waterfront Princess is also staying with the king. A famous beauty, beloved by so many prodigies, yet she’s still serving the king. A marriage pact is always effective unless purposely nullified.”

The instigator successfully annoyed the youths.

“Hmph, a fool like the king wants to marry Fairy Qin? Maybe in his dreams.” One genius said with disdain.

The instigator leisurely said: “Are you sure? What if Calm Lotus wants to support the king again? After all, he’s the legitimate heir of the orthodox branch. If Miss Qin were to marry him, she’ll be the queen in the future - able to give orders to the rest of the world.”

“Stop spouting nonsense!” The geniuses barked back.

Geniuses were always arrogant and proud. Though they knew being with Qin Jianyao was virtually impossible, they still wanted to fantasize about it.

Plus, they all considered the king to be a useless and immoral wretch that couldn’t be fixed! They had nothing but utter contempt for the king.

If Jianyao were to marry such a piece of trash, how could they ever let this go?

Thus, they put on a non-caring appearance about the issue, contrary to their actual nervous thoughts since she was now climbing up the peak.

“Disciple of Calm Lotus Monastery, Qin Jianyao, wishes to have an audience.” She stood outside the stone hall and asked. Just listening to her pleasant voice was quite enjoyable.

Everyone held their breath while watching. Eventually, the door creaked and opened. She bowed before entering.

The crowd didn’t leave since they wanted to know the result of this.

Inside the hall, Li Qiye sat there, seemingly asleep. Liu Chuqing quietly told him when Jianyao got closer: “Your Majesty, Fairy Qin is here.”

Li Qiye finally opened his eyes. His nonchalant and invasive gaze fell upon her.

It was as if there were a pair of invisible hands gently caressing her body, and this vexed her.

“Calm Lotus’ Qin Jianyao, greetings, Your Majesty.” She slightly bowed with no intention of kneeling.

“Are you here to carry out the marriage? Will you stay to serve me?” Li Qiye smiled while half-lying down, a very improper posture when speaking with a guest.

“I come bearing the good-wills of my ancestors to see how you are doing, Your Majesty.” She diverted the topic while looking transcending and attractive.

“So you have no intention of fulfilling the marriage pact?” He smiled, not worrying too much about his manner.

Any other men, geniuses and prodigies, would want to act elegant and graceful in front of her - showing her their best side. This wasn’t the case for Li Qiye.

“The marriage was decided by the ancestors so I do not dare to make a decision on my own, please ask them yourself, Your Majesty.” She responded.

This was a good response - not admitting or denying the marriage pact. She remained elegant with a good sense of propriety - nearly perfect.

The difference between her and Splendorous Saintess was as clear as day.

“And here I am, leaving a spot for you.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “Looks like you do not value it. Very well, next time when you wish to try again, you can be Liu Chuqing’s maid instead. That’s already very generous of me.”

“Thank you, Your Majesty.” Of course she was unhappy about this distasteful comment but not to the point of being angry.

“You should be thankful indeed. If I were to destroy your sect, you wouldn’t be qualified as a maid at that point, only a bed-warmer at best and only if I’m in a good mood.” Li Qiye leisurely added.

“Your Majesty likes to joke.” Jianyao remained courteous but her tone grew colder after hearing such harsh words.

“Alright, scram now.” Li Qiye grew disinterested and waved his hand: “I will remember your Calm Lotus Monastery’s false courtesy. When I mobilize, I will think about sparing your sect’s old men. At the very least, they know how to put up a proper act.”

Jianyao’s annoyance intensified but she didn’t express it. She bowed once more and said: “I’ll be taking my leave.” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Have you decided on the next successor?” He asked as she was leaving.

“I’m only an ordinary disciple and do not dare to participate in such an important matter.” She responded.

“Then remember this for me - Nine Secrets is still under my control, your sect is nothing but a bunch of ants. Be smart and kneel before me to beg for forgiveness when the time comes. Otherwise, you will be a part of the eventual destruction.” Li Qiye reminded.

Jianyao didn’t respond this time and left, floating in the air.
