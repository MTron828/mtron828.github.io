Chapter 5314: I Have No Idea Either

With the invitation came his chances to meet its upper echelon. For the world, this included the wise sages and ancient emperors - Nether, Sword, Heaven Burial, Light-dragon…

Older beings in the past included Crimson and World Emperor. These unbeatable cultivators were the reason for Celestial Court’s dominance.

As he conversed with these beings, he had come to realize that it wasn’t so simple. Alas, since he didn’t join Celestial Court, he failed to see the truth.

Now, he understood why Crimson Emperor and the others had no choice but to obey. There was someone far more frightening behind Celestial Court.

“Perish has Imperial Progenitor refining the dao back to the void. Redflood was melted by Stonesplitter Patriarch.” Zhitian regained his wits and looked at the evil land: “What about Reborn and Ultimate? Can you tell us, Young Noble?”

At this point, Li Qiye’s vast knowledge regarding these secrets was known to everyone.

“Lord of Derivation.” Li Qiye said, once again waking up a supreme existence who chose to not react.

After all, this was no longer Trinity and their world. The slightest action would be caught by the current epoch lord - Li Qiye.

“Lord of Derivation.” Zhitian murmured, feeling more afraid of this particular being compared to the other two.

“Is this the person who copulated with the blood-suckers and corpses?” He asked.

Li Qiye smirked at him in response: “I hope you know that if this were the previous epoch, you would be suffering a terrible death right now daring to make this comment. This is a taboo topic, only disasters await.”

“I didn’t say anything.” He shuddered before shrugging and acting innocent. Nonetheless, he was still thinking that this Lord of Chaos was a true pervert.

After a while, he thought about something else and asked: “Why do we get to see anima now?”

The path of the dragon lords was slightly different since they didn’t have dao fruits. Nonetheless, they could see reach their version of anima, unlike the emperors in the past.

The path was laid out before them; the issue was whether they could actually journey far enough to reach the end.

“The era of the nine worlds and thirteen continents is no more. We are now in an entirely new epoch with eight desolaces and six continents.” The old servant answered instead.

“A new epoch? Does, does that mean we have a new founder? So Trinity had characters such as Stonesplitter Patriarch and Imperial Progenitor. Who is our progenitor?” Zhitian asked curiously.

“Don’t know.” The servant said.

“What do you think, Young Noble?” He asked Li Qiye who seems to know all the answers including the secrets of the previous epoch.

“I have no idea either.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head: “Let’s continue looking.”

True Bear and the old servant followed right behind him while Zhitian stood there in a daze, feeling that Li Qiye just didn’t want to reveal more.

“What is the incomplete product we’re looking for?” He caught up and asked.

“An experiment before the ancient ming. It was relatively successful yet still abandoned.” Li Qiye said.

“Here in Evil Reborn? Is it dreadful?” Zhitian took a deep breath.

“It depends on your own definition of dreadful. If you think a devil is dreadful, then this thing might be beyond your imagination.” Li Qiye said.

“I see.” He murmured and glanced over at the old servant for more information. The latter didn’t respond.

The group crossed through mountains and valleys, witnessing bizarre creatures along the way.

In a blood pond, they saw a lump of rotten flesh swimming slowly. However, something else drew near and bony outgrowths protruded from the flesh to kill the victim. The flesh then coiled around it for the slow devouring process.

On a plain, they saw one-legged monsters as thin as a bamboo tree, living a borrowed life since they could only find grass for consumption here.

“What are these things?” Zhitian found that their very existence meant prolonged torture.

“More failed experiments. The ghost and blood race didn’t appear overnight.” Li Qiye said.

“So many experiments then.” He murmured.

“Due to the heavenly tribulations for attempting to create life, these experiments are doomed at the start. They can only live here, if you can call it living.” Li Qiye said.

“I feel sorry for them.” Zhitian said softly: “So they came before the blood and the ghost race.”Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“Yes, the difference being that they were created while in the other case, it’s just reproduction.” Li Qiye said.

“It’s no different from laying with a goat, how disgusting.” He responded.

“Watch yourself again. In the previous epoch, your ancestors and Celestial Court would have punished you for saying something like this.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh.
