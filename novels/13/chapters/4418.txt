Chapter 4419: One Shot

“Boom!” Celestial Tiger summoned a treasure that immediately release immense dao lord power.

A crystal eye appeared above him, seemingly alive. Its presence felt the same as if a dao lord was here in person.

“A dao lord weapon!” One ancestor shouted.

Its aura swept people off their feet or forced them down on their knees. They trembled and couldn’t look straight at the eye.

“Pa-” The eye suddenly opened and froze everyone. They could see a dao lord standing there in the void and looking down at everyone.

It could see the outlines of everything in existence. Nothing could hide from its all-seeing gaze.

“Omniscient God Eye!” An ancestor from a different sect couldn’t believe it.

An expert from Dragon whispered: “Looks like Tiger Pond truly values Celestial Tiger as its successor.”

This was a supreme treasure left behind by Myriad-eye Dao Lord. He created it by using his unique ocular merit law.

The ancestors of Tiger Pond were in charge of it but now, it was in Celestial Tiger’s possession.

This was decided ever since he lost to Jian Qingzhu. They worried about his safety and wanted to boost his power.

After all, he had done a great job learning the Omniscient Eye. With this treasure, he became a tiger with wings.

“Boom!” The rays and beam coming from his chest suddenly disappeared. Now, the eye shot out a ray only as thick as a thumb.

However, it had a crystal form and looked to be tangible. All spectators felt themselves being penetrated despite not being its target.

“Ahh!” They bellowed due to a sharp pain in their eyes. Weaker cultivators’ eyes started bleeding profusely.

“Go!” Shenfan Tianjie was astounded to see the crystallized ray. He immediately channeled all of his power into the ancestral banner.

Its power reached the limit and poured down divine flames. Gods and ancestors appeared to protect him with the mysteries of the dao.

Alas. this dao barrier was still not enough to stop the crystallized ray. After all, the ray consisted of the power of a dao lord on top of Celestial Tiger’s special eye technique.

The astonished crowd thought that this move was unstoppable. Only death awaited the target.

“Boom!” It became obvious that the dao barrier wouldn’t be able to stop this attack.

“Be careful!” An ancestor from the east bellowed.

Those from Dragon felt the same way. Peacock Monarch shouted: “Hold back!”

Unfortunately, it was already too late.

“Damn!” Shenfan Tianjie felt the threat of death and used his best evasive maneuver, soaring away like the wind.

His swift reaction and speed weren’t rewarded this time. “Pop!” The ray pierced through his chest, causing blood to splash everywhere.

“No!!!” He bellowed in horror and screamed while his body fell to the ground.

“Bam!” The corpse smashed to the ground; its blood stained the soil red.

Silene took over the scene as people stared at the bloody hole on the corpse’s chest.

The victor was obvious - Celestial Tiger. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“He couldn’t stop the dao lord weapon.” One ancestor quietly commented.

In terms of power and cultivation, perhaps even talents, the two were rather even. Both were two-dao sovereigns.

Shenfan Tiejian had the upper hand when he used his clan’s techniques. Even a dao lord secret law couldn’t defeat him.

This all changed the moment Celestial Tiger took out his dao lord weapon and decisively settled the match.

The Shenfan’s peerless banners and merit laws were still inferior to a dao lord weapon.

The crystal eye and Celestial Tiger’s innate gift made the attack similar to one of a dao lord. It would be strange if Shenfan Tianjie could actually survive.

“It’s a matter of ace cards. Dragon is still above a regular clan.” One high elder commented.

“We shouldn’t underestimate Dragon.” A big shot from the east told his fellow members.

In fact, Celestial Tiger didn’t have access to all of Dragon’s resources, only Tiger Pond’s. If he could become the next sect master, he would turn considerably more powerful.

“He’s dead, this is a bad development.” Someone from Dragon whispered.

Death occasionally happened during duels. The loser could only blame themselves for lacking skills.

However, this circumstance was different. Shenfan Tiejian was considered an esteemed guest. This might negatively impact the relationship between Dragon and the east.

“Five-sun School and the alliance have lost face.” An elder from Dragon shuddered and became worried.

The atmosphere reflected this. The ex-sect master of Five-sun and the other ancestors’ expression darkened.
