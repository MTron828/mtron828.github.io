“Die!” They rushed forward together; one with a saber while the other used an iron chain. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Clank!” The saber issued its hymn and came horizontally in the form of endless waves, wanting to drown Li Qiye.

“Clank.” The iron chain was thrown towards him with enough power to imprison a nebula. The entire area was instantly sealed.

The two men chose to use their strongest attack, no longer giving a damn about anything else.

If they were facing anyone else, perhaps this combo would be able to buy valuable time for Bingchi Hanyu to start running.

Unfortunately, they were facing Li Qiye so their frightening combo looked insignificant. He didn’t bat an eye and casually raised a finger.

“Boom!” The long saber crumbled, the same with the iron chains.

“Poof! Poof!” The two old men didn’t have a chance to run and instantly turned to bloody mists scattering to the wind.

The crowd still hasn’t gotten used to his power. These old men were relatively famous in the Bingchi as experts but they couldn’t handle a single finger strike from him.

Of course, they have expected this result. Nevertheless, expecting and actually witnessing were two different things. This still shocked them all the same.

When he took down Ma Mingchun with one kick, they were also astonished. However, for the majority of the crowd, an Eternal was too far above them. Strangely enough, it didn’t have the same effect because they couldn’t relate to the power level.

These two old men were different. They were similar and evenly-matched to some of the ancestors or the masters of the geniuses present.

This meant that his one finger strike could also easily crush them to oblivion. This painted a better picture for their mind so they trembled with fear.

Just imagining a being so far superior left some ancestors horrified. This feeling of helplessness and vulnerability permeated the spectators.

They didn’t dare to do anything but watch the bloody mists being blown away by the winds.

“No one can save you, they’ll only be coming to their death.” Li Qiye chuckled and reached for Hanyu.

One could see the fear deep in her eyes but she didn’t try to run. Losing meant accepting the responsibility and running was useless anyway. She knew this full well. She didn’t try to stop his grasp so she stood still, accepting her fate.

“Clank!” The moment they made contact, a sword hymn resounded. Its glint flashed as the slash crossed through the myriad realms.

This vast edge could cut through the stars and the six dao, sweeping through all obstacles with a grand momentum and cutting out a new chaos.

The aura of a True Emperor surged like a flood with continuous detonations, more than enough to crush the gods and devils in all worlds. This imperial divinity was imperious, causing living beings to tremble with fear.

“A True Emperor!” Someone shouted in horror and gazed at the incoming slash.

“Eight Formation True Emperor!” The last came from the distant Myriad Formation Kingdom and instantly made it here.

Only one emperor was around in that kingdom right now - Eight Formation.

It’s clear that he wanted to save Bingchi Hanyu. The slash was still mighty despite the long travel. This emperor’s slash was brilliant since it contained a massive sword momentum.

It aimed straight for Li Qiye’s neck, wanting to decapitate him.

However, Li Qiye casually retaliated with a regular simple punch.

“Boom!” It looked ordinary enough yet it carried an apocalyptic force.

The slash instantly shattered into bright particles and scattered all over the sky, resulting in a rain of sword energy. The imperial aura was also taken down, unable to withstand the invincible punch.

Eight Formation True Emperor’s slash seemed feeble versus Li Qiye’s punch.

“He’s invincible.” Though people expected this result, they didn’t think Li Qiye would dominate the first exchange so thoroughly.

All eyes turned towards Myriad Formation Kingdom, wondering if the emperor will come out to save Bingchi Hanyu since their status has been confirmed.

“Looks like he does care about you. Unfortunately, nothing will come of it.” Li Qiye smiled and gazed towards Myriad Formation Kingdom: “I welcome all challenges. I’ll be waiting at Great Desolate Mountain, come out and fight.”

With that, he turned and left, while the crowd shuddered from this declaration of war. Alas, the emperor was still in a cultivation session.

Of course, no one was surprised at this declaration. Eight Formation True Emperor had sieged the imperial city before, chasing the king away from his throne. At the same time, he also took the king’s fiancee.

For both personal and political reasons, the king and the emperor will have a fight to the death!

The reticent crowd heaved a sigh of relief after Li Qiye was gone. They felt much better since with him around, they didn’t dare to open their mouth - always in a state of nervousness.

“The outcome is settled, everyone needs to start praying.” Qin Jianyao sighed, knowing that even though she was a special girl, she still wouldn’t be able to enter Li Qiye’s sight after missing her chance. Earning his favor now was harder than reaching for the heavens.

What she needed to do now was carefully report to her ancestors about everything that had happened here, hoping that they could make a rational decision. Otherwise, even a sect as powerful as theirs could turn to ashes.

“No one can stop him now.” The saber saint smiled wryly. Among the five great powers, Waterfront Pavilion was the luckiest thanks to Liu Chuqing. Otherwise, they would be in the same shoes as the Bingchi Clan.

He shook his head and left. It was time for them to back off. They have earned Li Qiye’s grace so it was time to be smart.

The anxious crowd didn’t know what to do or where to go. There was a competition for the throne previously, but now, the king had soared to the sky. The entire system trembled before him; its inhabitants were at a complete loss.
