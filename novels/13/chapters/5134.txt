Chapter 5135: The Distant Years

Utensils were meticulously arranged on the spotless table. The teapot was made from novenary violet golden clay wit the help of ice-fire dao. The cups were made from celestial ice crystals, warm but never hot, and capable of collecting heavenly essences automatically. There was no doubt that only those standing at the apex had access to these tea utensils.

Li Qiye read the characters and smiled: “Not bad at all, capable of seeing this already.”

He sat down and gazed at Peace Village beneath. From here, he saw a supreme grand dao engulfing all the villages and gained the feeling of being one with the land.

He then focused on the dao tree instead. The barks looked like dragon scales at this point. It seemed that it was only a matter of time before a complete transformation.

He sighed and knocked three times on the stone table, each in tune with the grand dao. The tree resonated with his calling and dao runes appeared, creating a temporal passage.

“Buzz.” A figure walked out of the tree with a pleasant fragrance.

Li Qiye’s memories resurfaced after seeing her. She was only around sixteen or so, not breathtakingly beautiful by any means, just pleasing to the eyes.

Her oval face was fair and delicate. Her eyes were clear and dazzling like autumn water. She wore no makeup nor an expensive dress; her hair was tied loosely behind her back. This simplicity was elegant and youthful.

Time didn’t leave a mark on her; she remained the same in the past and would be the same in the future.

Li Qiye stood up and their eyes met, sending them back in time.

“So long ago.” Li Qiye gently patted her face but it was only an ethereal image with no heat or flesh.

“I’m glad that you were able to go on the path you wanted.” He said softly.

The image bowed deeply and gestured for him to sit down again. He did so and she waved her hand - the finest tea leaf on the tree fell into the pot.

She added the boiled water to the leaf and the sounds of a dragon could be heard. It seemed to be teaching the path of the true dragon - a way of transforming into the majestic creature.

Li Qiye slowly took a sip. The moment the tea entered his body, he became resplendent as if he was empowered by a draconic beast.

He took his time with each sip while gazing at the villages. She continued to pour his cup whenever he finished.

“Peace is not a bad outcome for many, it’s rather rare too.” His voice could reach the past where a girl sat before the tree, waiting for his message.

“A single wish fulfilled through the dao, how enviable.” He added while she only listened: “Your effort and vigilance seem to have been rewarded.”

The image nodded.

The two did so until the teapot was empty.

“We’re out of tea, the same for fate and life.” He put down the cup and said.

She stood up and bowed again before dispersing into little particles. They fell down and scattered throughout the entire villages, completely undetected by the villagers.

“Goodbye.” He sighed after seeing this and glanced at the tree. It appeared the same as before but a hint of dao has been lost.

With that, he scanned the villages again and finally noticed a house built on a peculiar ridge. Only those strong enough would be able to see that it was special. He smiled and headed there.

The house was built with old tiles and bricks, still not collapsing after all this time. It had a total of three small buildings, a study, and a separate bedroom. The large windows made them seem rather inviting and easy to live in.

In the courtyard was an osmanthus tree that has barks as hard as iron. Its flowers blossomed and filled the place with its enchanting fragrance. Sun rays seeped through the cracks of the tree and warmed the person breathing below.

Reading in the shade of this tree was perfect since multiple senses were being stimulated at once. One could forget about the flow of time while enjoying themselves here.

This was the case for the middle-aged man wearing a clean robe. Not a single speck of dust could be seen.

Given his composure and elegance, he resembled a famous scholar instead of just a villager enjoying a hobby.

The courtyard blocked out the rest of the world. Not a single distraction could affect him but today was different. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

He looked up and saw Li Qiye standing there looking at the osmanthus tree. He got up and bowed deeply: “Seeing you is a supreme honor, Sir.”

“This tree isn’t from this world.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I’ve heard that it is from a legendary world with immortals, I don’t know how true it is since I came across it in a nightmarish realm.” The man said.

“Seems like you have been waiting for me.” Li Qiye said.

“I, Landu, do not dare to display my slight skill before an expert since I only have a minor understanding of divination. Two days ago, I calculated and prepared water for you up there.”

“Jun Landu.” Li Qiye sat down and said.

“Just a nobody.” He humbly said.

“You might be a nobody in the six continents but in my opinion, you are one of the most brilliant souls.” Li Qiye praised.
