Chapter 4285: Wounded

“Crack!” The cracks took over the entire statue. It seemed to be on the verge of crumbling.

“No need for formalities.” Li Qiye reached forward and touched it in this crucial moment.

Water-like rays flowed into the statue through the cracks. The gaps began closing since they were filled by the rays.

Once he pulled his hand back, the statue became the same as before. It was as if the whole thing was just an illusion.

He sighed and said: “You have done a commendable job, a reward is inevitable.”

The statue didn’t speak but there was an internal fluctuation only sensed by Li Qiye. This conversation seemingly dated back to millions of years ago. In fact, even a conversation was unnecessary between these two.

He glanced back at the tablet and said: “The only thing to do now is to wait for that day. I’ll personally come to take it then.”

The statue seemed to understand him since they had a secret relationship. Any true master present would be able to see the statue nodding; regular cultivators wouldn’t be able to discern anything.

“Monumental changes are coming.” He concluded and the statue agreed.

He never told the statue about the reason why. Nonetheless, it shouldered a serious mission and didn’t need to know the reasons. It had accepted the task and just needed to protect this place.

“I’ll be back again, be patient and keep on waiting.” He added.

The statue nodded, ready to perform the task regardless of the endless years. This mission wouldn’t end until Li Qiye said otherwise.

“Though things are continuously changing.” He thought about something else: “But where I am should be the safest spot. It’s best to stay in this world.”

“There is still hope in the future. This might actually be the best plan.” He then shifted his focus to the garden one last time before leaving.

The statue clandestinely watched him leave. The other visitors had no idea about its movement, thinking that it was just a regular statue.

They also thought the garden served as a memorial for Medicine Bodhisattva. Little did they know, there was a shocking secret underground that would astound even dao lords.

After leaving the garden, Li Qiye didn’t enter his astral state again. He traveled and stopped on top of a peak for a panoramic view of the scenery ahead.

It gave him a feeling of peace to see the mountains and forests. He smiled and said: “Things come and go but the land remains.”

Though the place in front of him appeared ordinary now, it used to be the home of a mighty sect - completely unstoppable. Alas, time destroyed everything, even the strongest foundation and mightiest bloodline. People tried to fight this inevitable truth only to fail.

“Immortal.” Li Qiye chuckled: “How silly, everyone wishes to become one.”

The character “immortal” was special in the cultivation world. It would make people fantasize instantly, even top characters like dao lords and emperors.

What did the character represent? Invincibility? Everlasting life? ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

All in all, this was the end goal for numerous cultivators. They all yearned for it despite being aware of the impossibility.

Only a few knew that nothing good might come from being involved with this character. One would most likely become an abomination first before an immortal.

“If immortals exist, there would be no need for the villainous heaven.” He looked up above.

There were white clouds and blue sky, at least in the eyes of regular people. As for Li Qiye, when he gazed above, the heaven also gazed back at him. However, the heaven never responded.

“I’m coming, I’ll change the heaven.” He uttered with absolute confidence. Each word carried enough power to split the world open and destroy the ages despite being spoken so casually.

The world had no idea the potential consequences resulting from carrying out his mission.

Li Qiye then sat down and rested his chin on his knees, enjoying himself.

This didn’t last long before loud and urgent footsteps came from behind. A person got closer to Li Qiye, clearly wounded judging by his lousy movement.

“Clank!” This person thought that Li Qiye was an enemy blocking their path and unsheathed a sword.

It was an old man wearing a simple yet masterfully crafted robe - a sign of his status.

Alas, he was covered in blood and wounds, some of which were deep enough to see bones. The worst one was on his chest - a full penetration by an unknown weapon.

He was barely hanging on after making it this far. He stared intensely at Li Qiye, feeling dizzy from losing too much blood. Beads of sweat streamed down his pale face.

Li Qiye only gave him a passing glance and didn’t ask questions.

He realized that Li Qiye wasn’t an enemy and heaved a sigh of relief. Alas, the momentary lapse in focus made him fall to the ground.

“Your injuries are serious.” Li Qiye helped him up and said.

“I-I don’t have much longer.” He coughed out a mouthful of blood and struggled to breathe.

“Indeed, your true fate is broken. You’ll be a cripple even if you somehow survive.” Li Qiye assessed the wounds.
