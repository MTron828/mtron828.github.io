Chapter 5692: Temporal Serum

“Poof!” The deities focused the power of the momentum on the conqueror’s true fate, sparking it back to a vigorous level.

They heaved a sigh of relief since if they were just a bit late, the true fate would have extinguished and made this exceedingly harder.

However, it flickered again, losing its stability.

“Stabilize! This must be due to the existing injuries, it can’t handle the influx of power!” Immortal Emperor Di Yu shouted.

Although the power of the deities granted life back to the true fate, other existing injuries resurfaced. This made the power connection unstable. If this continued, the influx would tear the true fate apart, aggravating its condition.

“Buzz.” Momentous Dao pulsed brightly and sent a majestic and pure life force into the true fate, gestating it like the spring of life. This greatly accelerated its recovery.

After all, this power of life was the culmination of the life forces from all the mortals since the start of its foundation. It had been stored in the dao itself, hence its boundlessness and purity.

It was the best medicine available, capable of healing even a shattered true fate. Seeing the favorable development calmed the deities down.

“Keep it up.” They continued to send the power of Momentous Frontier to recraft the true fate.

This was enough to recraft both the true fate and the body of Luminous, allowing him to reach his peak and potentially escape from Celestial Court.

Once stability was reached, the true fate became connected to the primordial dao fruit. The connection resulted in a blinding radiance - a sign of rebirth for Luminous Conqueror.

This would make the next step far easier for the deities.

“Buzz.” An abundance of life force combined with the power of Momentous Dao reshaped Luminous’ conqueror, giving him his true blood and body back.

Given his obliterated state, just prolonging his life was virtually impossible. This required the use of a valuable “immortal” medicine and a long period.

However, Momentous Dao’s resources and foundation were second to none, having been accumulating all this time after the calamity. Its effectiveness and potency exceeded any medicine found in the mortal world.

“Won’t take long now.” One deity said, seeing the formation of Luminous’ body.

Deities, time is up, may I know your decision?” War’s voice echoed again: “If you will not hand over West Bank Prime Emperor and Luminous Conqueror, we will have no choice but to consider your stance of neutrality ineffective.” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

This final message made everyone shudder. The deities themselves had a serious expression.

“Crack!” Suddenly, the bright true fate of Luminous cracked again.

“Damn, what’s going on?!” The deities were caught off guard by this development.

Luminous Conqueror should have returned to his prime state, what was going on with this true fate?!

“Stabilize again! They poured more power and life force into this true fate.

Something red seemed to be leaking out of the cracked true fate in this split second.

“?!” The deities saw this and had an ominous feeling.

“Temporal Serum!” Space Dragon Emperor recognized it.

Alas, everything was too late. West Bank Prime Emperor suddenly got up and released a light illuminating the source of Momentous Dao.

Time came to a halt first and this light engulfed the deities as well, removing them of their dao, power, and even physical location.

“Ancient Immortal Seal!” Bones couldn’t believe it.

None of them had the chance to escape the effect of the light. They were preoccupied with healing Luminous Conqueror, completely distracted.

Moreover, their powers were in full connection. To break it off and run was easier said than done.

This was naturally a trap but what could they do now? All have been sealed at the end of the day.
