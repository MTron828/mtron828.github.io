Chapter 5701: I Don’t Need You To Gift Me The Path

West Bank Prime Emperor had a chance to enter Immortal Dao City. Alas, a single lapse of judgment made him conspire with Luminous Conqueror.

“The crime is beyond redemption!” An ancestor’s hatred toward the two was bone deep.

Regardless of the reason, their sin was unforgivable. They led wolves back home and buried everyone else along the way.

“Death is the only way to console the dead!” West Bank’s members cursed their own progenitor.

Weaker cultivators aside, they lost four emperors and twenty-two dragon lords. The casualties were innumerable. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

These men were willing to fight to defend their land. Unfortunately, they would never find out the actual cause of their death, serving as bricks for the duo’s ambition. Some even viewed their progenitor as the last hope, hoping that he would be able to rebuild the clan and save The People. Thus, the actual outcome was ironic and tragic - to be sacrificed without any remorse by their revered hero.

The curses from the survivors fell upon deaf ears. Luminous and West Bank didn’t give a damn, only focusing on Genesis Conqueror.

“I see, whether it was a test or abandonment, that doesn’t matter. My path does not need to be gifted by you all. If you close the gate, we shall open it, this is not unreasonable.” West Bank said.

The past no longer mattered. Now, they had a chance to enter Immortal Dao City to embark on the next journey. They didn’t need permission from the Immortal Emperors now. They became the masters of their fate. Nothing else mattered.

“Look at what you two have become.” Genesis uttered coldly.

“Hahaha, honor and shame are as insignifcant as the passing breezes. All are insects while we will become overlords, why would we care about their death?” Luminous laughed.

This was actually an uncommon sentiment among top cultivators but few stated it so directly. Luminous didn’t care about his allies who had fought alongside him, whom he had addressed as brothers. The dao limit path was the only thing on his mind.

“You deserve death.” Genesis said before drawing her sword.

Her longsword was forged from imperial metal and had divine runes from the treasure itself. Its glow was unique to Immortal Dao City.

“Clank!” She raised it in the air and a beam penetrated the sky.

“She can control Immortal Dao City.” Her opponents understood that she was trusted by the emperors who passed the torch to her.

“Perish!” She delivered a vertical slash empowered by the city.

It could split the world back to the primordial chaos, instilling fear into the heart of her enemies. No emperor alone could survive it; their anima tree and dao fruits would be cut down in the blink of an eye.

“Activate!” Luminous utilized Momentous Dao, controlling the star to fly in front of him and parrying the slash.

“Bam!” The colossal collision swept across heaven and earth, overturning vast stretches and shattering landscapes.

“Creak...” The gate that was pried open started closing just a little bit due to Luminous being distracted.

“Stop her!” Luminous roared.

“Very well, hurry up!” War and the others exchanged glances before flying toward Immortal Dao City.

Just-once, Nine-wheel, Resolute, Armament, and many others landed in front of the gate, aiming to stop Genesis Conqueror.

“Boom!” They combined their powers and sent the waves straight at her.

A regular apex cultivator stood no chance due to the number disadvantage. However, Genesis was surrounded by the heavenly treasure’s runes. They created a sky curtain and prevented the waves from reaching her.
