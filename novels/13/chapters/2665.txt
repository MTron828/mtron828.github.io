“Ah!” Li Qiye’s palm crushed the legion down to a pulp; many members exploded into blood after screaming.

Some spectators didn’t see the fight between Li Qiye and the four masters so they trembled while thinking that Fiercest lived up to his fame.

“Die!” A flash appeared before the battle cry, inches away from Li Qiye’s throat.

This sword thrust was extremely fast, far exceeding the quick draw from Lightning Sword God.

It had precision with plenty of force and sharpness on top of its swiftness, allowing it to penetrate even the stars in the sky or any other hard object.

“Clank!” However, time came to a stop and the tip of the sword seemed to be sealed and held by two fingers from Li Qiye before it could prick the skin.

The assailant was Sun Lengying. As the founder of the legion, he couldn’t bear to watch the annihilation earlier so he decided to join the fight.

Unfortunately, his sword wasn’t as fast as Li Qiye and unable to pierce through the guy’s neck before being caught.

“Pop!” Time started flowing again as Li Qiye pushed down and finished the rest of the legion. Only bloody mists were left.

This impressive and intimidating legions with numerous battle achievements couldn’t withstand a single blow before Li Qiye’s total invincibility. The gap between them was overwhelming.

“Clank!” He shook his fingers and broke Lengying’s sword.

The latter instantly retreated by more than ten thousand miles in the blink of an eye but it was still too late.

“Whoosh!” Blood spattered because Li Qiye casually threw the broken blade and got Lengying on the chest despite the latter’s best effort to escape.

“Clank!” It pinned him on the ground.

“Lengying!” Lucidity King’s expression soured as he shouted.

“Run!” This wasn’t enough to kill Lengying but he knew death was coming so he told the king to run since the Mu was so near.

His first priority was always the king regardless of the circumstance. Protecting Lucidity was his responsibility and ultimate mission even with only one breath remaining.

“Stop right there!” Lucidity King didn’t listen and formed a mudra.

“You view the world as a chessboard but in my eyes, you’re just an ant. This is your just deserts for provoking me.” Li Qiye looked at him and said.

“Let’s go then!” Lucidity King didn’t waste needless words and wanted to buy time for Sun Lengying despite being aware of the futility.

“Boom!” Royal energy surged out of him like a tsunami engulfing the world. It materialized into a flame capable of refining everything.

He looked like an unstoppable king, capable of delivering sentences on everyone else.

As an existence reigning for three generations, he had more than his fair share of conquests. The world had nothing but fear for him. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Many once again realized the power of these two Eternals even though they were running away from Li Qiye like dogs right now.

His pitiful state right now wasn’t due to weakness but because Li Qiye was too strong. Any opponent of his would suffer this humiliation.

“Boom!” Lucidity King raised one hand and the flame poured down while destroying the dao laws in its path.

“Lucidity Flame!” Someone shouted in horror.

This type of flame was tyrannical yet didn’t carry a scorching temperature. On the contrary, it felt like a gentle breeze that could burn an Eternal.

The massive flame took the shape of a cauldron with Li Qiye’s area at the center and surrounded him.

“Lucidity Cauldron World!” The king roared and the cauldron erupted with blazing fire.

“Rumble!” It seemed that numerous worlds were exploding or volcanos erupting. The individual explosions shot towards Li Qiye, wanting to refine him.

The crowd was in awe at the eruption within the cauldron as the world tremble.

“This is the strongest move from the Lucidity Pill Scripture!” One ancestor took a deep breath after seeing this dominating technique. [1]

This particular scripture was created by Nine Secrets’ most amazing emperor, Zheng. This particular text was praised to be on the same level as the nine secrets.

Lucidity King became the strongest user of this scripture after Emperor Zheng, hence his title. He managed to defeat the various secret words in Nine Secrets using the arts within. That’s why everyone in this system was afraid of him.

This Lucidity Cauldron World was the strongest move from this scripture, capable of refining three thousand worlds and the innate momentum of each - a truly horrifying spectacle to behold.

However, Li Qiye ho was trapped in the cauldron was doing just fine despite being assaulted by the flames.

“Break.” Li Qiye uttered while swinging his hand.

“Boom!” The cauldron capable of burning the firmaments instantly collapsed. The explosive Lucidity FLame also extinguished like a candle in the wind.

“Bam!” The slap continued and struck Lucidity King as well.

The king was smashed into the ground, destroying the area around him. The slap disfigured his face into fleshy bits, rendering him bloodied and unrecognizable.

1. I once questioned about the pill part of this scripture due to a lack of context but it makes sense now
