Chapter 4101: Disaster Arrives

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The maelstrom made from black clouds appeared creepy and frightening just like a primal monster wanting to devour Armament Mountain.

The sect was under a state of alert; its members became nervous.

“Call the sect master.” One elder panicked since the maelstrom was moving downward.

Currently, their sect master was in isolated cultivation while their first elder has died in battle. Their ancestors were slumbering so there was no one in charge.

“But the sect master is still…” The disciple hesitated.

“What’s more important than dealing with this potential disaster? Call her.” The elder was decisive. The sect desperately needed Shi Yingxue’s leadership right now.

The disciples on guard continued staring at the maelstrom. Alarm gongs still echoed. They wondered if enemies were attacking.

Nearly sects were notified of this phenomenon as well and became startled.

“Enemies are at the gate?” One expert wondered.

“No, not enemies. I do not see any cultivators in hiding, this is most likely an ominous sign.” An ancestor activated his heavenly gaze.

“Where is it coming from… what the hell is it?” Others were frightened.

If this maelstrom were to devour Armament Mountain, other tributaries nearby might succumb to the same fate as well.

Numerous ancestors have used their heavenly gaze at this point but only saw black clouds, nothing more. Of course, none of them thought that it was so simple.

“Can Armament handle this?” They hoped that Armament could stop this disaster.

Nonetheless, there were a few powers hoping for Armament’s fall, thinking that they could take advantage of it.

“What is it? Seems like an invasion.” Ning Zhu was surprised as well.

“The show is starting.” Li Qiye, on the other hand, showed no sign of curiosity or shock. This was within expectation.

Meanwhile, the rays from the ancestral peak continued trying to stop the maelstrom from descending. They were bright enough to stop spectators from watching closely.

“Rumble!” Alas, its wide-reaching intensity still couldn’t stop the descent. By this point, the maelstrom was right above and ready to crush the peak.

“Armament Mountain is in danger!” External cultivators shouted while watching from a distance.

“Activate the formation!” A dignified command sounded. It was none other than Armament Sect Master, Shi Yingxue. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Clank!” The weapons in the sect hymned and clanked in response.

Even weapons outside of the main branch resonated with her command as well. This development frightened their masters.

“Rumble!” Rays from all over the sect shot towards the sky.

They came from the various peaks situated around the mountain range. Next, they turned into divine weapons. One looked like a sword pointing at the sky; another resembled a massive hammer, then an earth-splitting saber…

This resembled a dam breaking down due to an unstoppable flood. These weapons had the aura of a dao lord and could suppress the firmaments.

The calamitous attack ravaged the region. Cultivators were forced down on their knees, unable to get up.

“A grand dao lord formation!” Pale spectators bellowed after seeing the attack.

Shi Yingxue personally took charge of controlling the grand formation. This was the final defensive line of Armament Mountain.

“Boom!” Once the blast struck the maelstrom, the remnant shockwaves sent people flying and vomiting blood.

Unfortunately, the maelstrom only quaked once and didn’t break down.

The ancestral peak didn’t give up and sent out more rays. The other peaks also did the same. Their rays coiled together to form a pulsing beam. Its target was the center of the maelstrom.

Alas, this still wasn’t enough to take down the dark maelstrom.

“What the hell is this thing? A direct attack from a grand dao lord formation still can’t take it down?” Spectators gasped after seeing this.

“Switch to defense!” Shi Yingxue shuddered and realized how frightening the maelstrom was. She decided to change the strategy.

Dao laws from the peaks connected them together. All the peaks became one as a result. The weapons then pinned themselves into the ground and formed an indomitable domain.
