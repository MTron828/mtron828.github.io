Chapter 3677: Boot-licker

Yang Ling was uncomfortable and restless due to the greedy gazes. She also had treasures herself and could become a target as well. This made her move closer to Li Qiye.

If she were alone right now, she would have been trembling with fear or run away instantly.

On the contrary, Li Qiye still leisurely sauntered through the street as if unaware of the gazes.

“Congratulations, Brother Li.” A young cultivator enthusiastically came closer to the group.

He was handsome with a touch of elegance. His cultivation was exceptional and his robe made it clear that he was from Duality. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

Li Qiye glanced at this enthusiastic youth acting too familiar.

“Do we know you?” Yang Ling asked, perplexed.

“You don’t remember me, Senior Sister Yang? I am Lil’ Lin, we’ve met many times before.” The student had a bright smile, acting as if they were close friends.

Yang Ling thought about it and found him familiar. However, there were too many students in Duality. They might have met but she wouldn’t be able to remember anyway.

“Brother Li, you’re truly the heaven’s favorite and the son of miracles. How enviable.” The student loudly said: “It is the academy’s honor to have a student like yourself, we are blessed to be your fellow classmates...”

He unleashed a deluge of praises at Li Qiye. The cultivators on the street found this quite strange. Other students from Duality found it nauseating.

“I’m not a student of Duality.” Li Qiye stopped the youth.

“Uhh...” The interruption made it awkward. He quickly put on a smile and continued: “Regardless, you’re definitely the true dragon with peerless talents in this era, a miracle of the holy ground, the idol of all of us. I have nothing but endless admiration for you...”

The flattery didn’t stop while the crowd exchanged glances, thinking that this student was too shameless.

“This is unbearable.” Yang Ling got goosebumps all over. She didn’t know when Duality had such a thick-skinned student.

Li Qiye only smiled and let the guy keep going this time.

“Your feats are majestic, from the hammer at the top of Myriad Cauldron to the golden spring and the wooden house.” The torrent of words continued: “Now, even the hug mouse gave you an ultimate treasure.”

People suddenly became interested in the conversation. Their ears seemingly became pointier because they wanted to hear the answer.

“And?” Li Qiye chuckled, still keeping a natural expression.

It was tough for the youth because Li Qiye’s responses were so unexpected, not a part of the planned script.

“Brother Li, could you broaden everyone’s horizon by showing us the supreme treasure that you got from the mouse? We have never seen an item of this level before.” The youth said.

Everyone was on board with this shameless youth now. First, this would confirm whether Li Qiye had it or not and they wanted to take a look anyway.

“Just a few things, not worth the time.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

This casual response carried serious weight because Li Qiye had just confirmed that he got some items from the hug mouse.

“It’s true.” A skeptical listener finally believed the rumors.

“Goddamn, he’s so lucky.” Another cursed and became jealous of Li Qiye’s luck.

The eyes focused on Li Qiye became redder with greed.

“A majestic man such as yourself must be on a mission given by the heaven.” The student went on: “It blessed you with such fortune in order for you to spread its generosity to everyone else. You mustn’t forget this goal.”

“How do I spread its generosity?” Li Qiye smirked.

“Since you have so many treasures and fortunes, you should give a few of them to everyone. They’ll be affected by your auspiciousness and overwhelmed by the generosity of the heaven.” The youth spoke without turning red in the slightest.

“Why should the young master share his items?” Yang Ling couldn’t help joining in.

“Because he is absolutely blessed. His existence means that others’ fortunes are taken away from them. That’s why, surely, his mission has to be sharing this luck with everyone else.” The youth responded.

Not to mention Yang Ling, the rest of the crowd couldn’t believe the audacity of this youth, thinking that he was too shameless.

One needed to share their luck with everyone else? How ridiculous.

“There’s no such thing!” Yang Ling responded.

The youth actually raised his voice and said: “Gentlemen, let’s be honest. We’re all poor and miserable, struggling for insignificant resources in order to cultivate, losing blood over the tiniest treasure. What about Brother Li? He doesn’t need to lift a single finger and is still blessed by the heaven, able to obtain the best treasures in the world. Isn’t that unfair? Since he has that many treasures, shouldn’t he share a bit with us? The heaven’s will is to bestow happiness to all living beings. Unfortunately, something went wrong in the process and all the luck fell on Brother Li, that’s why he should share a bit with us and can’t monopolize everything. Am I right or wrong?”

He spoke with such conviction as if justice was on his side, demanding payments from Li Qiye.

Yang Ling trembled with indignation after hearing this but couldn’t come up with a response because the whole premise was nonsense.

Everyone exchanged glances. They realized that it was bullshit but this was still a great opportunity.

“I think he’s right, Li Qiye can’t monopolize everything.” One youth was persuaded.

“Yes, he has all the luck in this world right now, he can’t keep everything for himself.” Another expert played dumb and repeated this notion.

“He should share the treasures with us, it’s the least he can do after stealing all of our luck.” The crowd clamored.

“What do you think, Brother Li?” The student looked quite pleased with himself after the successful rally.

“I’ve never thought of it this way.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Of course, this is the will of the heaven. You know what to do.” The youth smiled back.
