Chapter 4292: Wang Weiqiao

Li Qiye, the new sect master of Little Diamond, began preaching the dao and answering questions.

This lifestyle didn’t have a negative impact on Li Qiye. In fact, it made him recall the past.

This was far from his first time doing this. He had taught numerous Immortal Emperors and top masters before. Many famous sects in history originated from his teachings.

His days in Little Diamond harked back to the halcyon days. Of course, there was a clear distinction.

Previously, he taught the emperors and created invincible sects for several main reasons - to oppose the Ancient Ming and to build up a mighty alliance. In the present, he did it because he felt like it. He had no intention of making Little Diamond unstoppable.

He considered this as an amusing pastime brought to him by fate. The future success of Little Diamond relied on their own efforts and luck. He didn’t wish to force the issue.

Therefore, his days here were carefree and comfortable, making him feel like an old immortal in the tales from the mortal world.

If he truly wanted to, he could make Little Diamond into a behemoth. Alas, this seemed meaningless to him, just repeating the past in creating another Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect or Black Dragon Citadel.

He chose a free approach in educating the disciples this time, letting them explore it on their own for the most part.

Due to a lack of rigorous expectation, the sect members actually became more enthusiastic and studious, whether it be the elders or just regular disciples.

Initially, this small sect lacked profound knowledge on cultivation. They all shared the same few merit laws and the result became rather similar. The top and weakest cultivators were cast from the same mold.

But due to Li Qiye’s interference, all of them saw the door to an entirely new world. He casually answered their question regarding the dao, making the path seem so simple and easy.

Some of them spent days researching to no avail. On the other hand, just one sentence from him could enlighten with lucidity in no time at all. The clouds receded and they could see the bright sun.

Many also realized that they have embarked on the wrong path in the past and misunderstood the profundities of certain merit laws. It became clear that listening to Li Qiye was better than years of isolated training.

Therefore, each of his dao lectures was packed with disciples. The field was always filled to the limit.

The older seniors and even the elders seemingly became young again, putting everything they got into cultivating.

These elders lost hope before and thought that they have reached the limit. Deep in their heart, they had abandoned the pursuit of the grand dao. Li Qiye was the one who told them otherwise; spring returned and rekindled their ambition.

Their diligence was noted among the student body and the young ones didn’t want to fall behind. Healthy and productive competitions permeated Little Diamond.

They also relied on themselves without using pills and alchemy. Well, they didn’t have access to any in the first place.

Since most disciples were always cultivating, the sect became peaceful and quiet.

Today, Li Qiye took a stroll to kill time. When he came to the base of the sect where the workers lived, he saw an old man splitting firewood.

Despite having gray hair, his body was rather muscular. Each swing was powerful and smooth, easily cutting the wood apart.

There was no unnecessary movement - only raise then swing in a single motion.

Li Qiye silently observed without saying anything. The muscular old man didn’t notice Li Qiye since he was lost in his own world.

It seemed as if splitting firewood was something immensely enjoyable for him. It was rare to see an old man in such good shape.

He eventually finished with all of them and laughed happily despite being drenched in sweat.

“You did a good job.” Li Qiye praised.

“Greetings, Sect Master.” He finally saw Li Qiye and bowed respectfully.

“You’re a disciple of Little Diamond? This is our first meeting.” Li Qiye replied.

“I am only a worker in the sect and stood very far away during your coronation.” He said.

“You have cultivated for a long time now.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, Sect Master. I joined at the same time as the previous sect master but it’s quite embarrassing. I’m the weakest in the sect.” He said.

“I see.” Li Qiye seemed interested in him.

“Ah, you two are together?” Elder Hu happened to pass by and joined the duo.

“Sect Master, Brother Wang is the oldest member of our sect, he joined a few days earlier than the previous sect master. He’s been working here in recent years.” Elder Hu introduced.

“Elder Hu, a sect shouldn’t have idle members. The sect has fed me so although I am incapable, I know how to use an axe well enough to do hard labor, this gives the youths more time for training.”

It turned out that in terms of time alone, the old man named Wang Weiqiao would have the highest seniority in the sect. Strangely enough, he was the weakest, not even stronger than new recruits.

When he first joined the sect, he also had the ambition of learning how to fly along with other impressive abilities. Unfortunately, his innate talent must have been lacking.

After one hundred years, his peer who joined only a few days later became the sect master while he was still stuck in the same spot.

Such failure could ruin someone and make them leave the sect in order to avoid embarrassment. This didn’t apply to Wang Weiqiao.

He never gave up despite not seeing any improvement. He treated cultivation as a part of life. As long as he was breathing, he would continue to cultivate. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Nonetheless, he didn’t want to use the sect’s resources needlessly either. Thus, though he couldn’t do anything important, he chose to do menial labor in order to contribute.
