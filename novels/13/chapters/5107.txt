Chapter 5108: Destroying Celestial Court, Not Hard At All

“The sentiment is correct but allow me to elaborate. I am not declaring war on Celestial Court…” Li Qiye smirked and paused for a second before finishing: “But rather, I shall destroy it. This generation shall be its last.”

Listeners couldn’t believe their own ears and felt as if a thousand suns were exploding at the same time. Both sides became speechless.

Many brilliant conquerors had tried before - Luminous, Demon, Nightmoon… Even the monstrous Maddened couldn’t do so.

Putting individual efforts aside, Celestial Court survived several great wars. The full force of The People couldn’t take down Celestial Court.Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

During Skysplitter, Immortal Emperor Zhan, and the duck egg buyer led a coalition to the very gates of Celestial Court. Alas, after grievous casualties on both sides, they had no choice but to withdraw.

It was one thing to talk about killing a certain conqueror or emperor. As for destroying Celestial Court? Impossible.

“Ridiculous. He might be unbeatable here but is still just an insect before the might of the court.” An ancestor from The Race snorted.

“He’ll be dead if Celestial Court wishes so.” Another was furious.

Celestial Court was the supreme pillar of glory for The Race. Spewing such arrogance meant becoming the enemy of its members. Those from The Race found this ludicrous despite Li Qiye’s power.

Of course, The People didn’t say anything because they firmly supported Li Qiye.

The conquerors exchanged glances after hearing this. They had met incredible masters in the upper continents who didn’t dare to say so.

Their expression became serious as they channeled their power. Space instantly crumbled into dust but Li Qiye was completely unaffected.

Something became rather obvious - their foe was a frightening one. Meanwhile, the majority of the inhabitants in the lower continents trembled in fear.

This was the might of Celestial Court - just four conquerors from there alone could dominate the lower region.

“You seem confident in your ability.” Vessel Conqueror said.

“Destroying Celestial Court is no difficult task.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

Ascension couldn’t help but laugh: “I’ve traveled the world and this is my first time hearing this declaration. All-things Dao Lord and Demon Conqueror didn’t have this level of arrogance.”

“So is that why you joined Celestial Court?” Li Qiye smirked at him.

All eyes were on Ascension Conqueror, especially from the members of Primal. They had a hard time accepting the change in allegiance.

Of course, this didn’t matter because Ascension was a conqueror and they were nothing in his eyes now.

The issue was that the ancestors of Primal paid with sweat and blood while fighting against The Race. Now, one of its conquerors chose to join Celestial Court instead.

Ascension paused for a moment before answering with a hearty smile: “I am far from being the only one in history to join Celestial Court. As the saying goes, a smart bird chooses the right tree to roost in.”

“That’s a clever way of this putting this, and sure, it  is rather common in history.” Li Qiye applauded.

“Every individual makes their own choice while embarking toward the dao.” Ascension didn’t seem awkward at all.

The ancestors of Primal had nothing to say. They didn’t know what he had experienced in the upper continents.

“We are digressing from the topic. Today, our mission is to execute him.” Greenmountain said.

“Looks like a compromise is impossible.” Vessel gazed at Li Qiye.

“Don’t worry about compromising. I am right here, come kill me since that is your wish. It’s time to kill the chicken in order to warn the monkey.” Li Qiye said.

The four paid a heavy price to descend to the lower continents. Though they were compensated by the alliances, it was still a tough choice.

It was time to perform a full sweep - removing all obstacles. This would serve to remind everyone of Deity’s authority, and Li Qiye was a prime target.
