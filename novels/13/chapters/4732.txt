Chapter 4733: Supreme Geniuses

Both the world’s bowl and Soaring Immortal Slash failed to injure Li Qiye who stood there like the toughest statue.

He stopped both attacks without performing any technique or requiring the dao - something unfathomable.

Since an ancient ancestor told them about the pure power around him, everyone understood the reason why.

“Boom!” The bowl released torrents of light. Its power surged again after being empowered by Five-sun King.

The young emperor tried again and the slash became as bright as planets exploding, wanting to obliterate the region. He thrust his sword forward, resulting in an incalculable force heading for Li Qiye’s neck.

Their empowerment boosted the power of the bowl and the sword. Alas, their opponent still didn’t move. His natural strength alone became an unpassable moat.

“What is his cultivation..?” The ancient ancestors including the river demon and the monarchs couldn’t see through Li Qiye’s cultivation.

“Scram.” Li Qiye slightly raised his voice.

“Boom!” The pure force around him suddenly expanded and seemingly flipped the sky vault over.

Both the young emperor and Five-sun King’s defensive maneuvers weren’t enough so they were blown flying.

Li Qiye raised one leg and kicked down to unleash a destructive attack. Both opponents roared after seeing this.

The king used his bowl as a shield, turning it into a majestic mountain. The young emperor raised his sword horizontally, one hand holding the hilt and one hand pressing against the blade’s surface. This created a dao wall made of swords. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Boom!” The collision issued a blast that ruptured eardrums and made them bleedd profusely.

The kick struck the bowl and the sword, sending their owners flying like shooting stars. They smashed into the ground and created two huge pits.

“Crack!” Bones broke and their blood stained the dirt.

The scene became silent. These supreme geniuses could fight ancient ancestors evenly but they failed to match Li Qiye, suffering grievous injuries from a single kick.

The big shots became alarmed. They understood how strong these two geniuses were, meaning that the kick was virtually unstoppable. They wouldn’t have fared any better against Li Qiye.

All of them had the same thought in unison - this man must die. Leaving him alive would be disastrous for the future.

“Bam!” Both of the geniuses leaped out of the pits and blew debris everywhere. They were bloody with numerous broken bones.

“Screech!” The image of a heavenly eagle appeared in a golden radiance. Five-sun King’s muscles grew bigger and tougher as if he was possessed by this divine beast. It granted him primal strength and swift recovery power. Both his open wounds and broken bones healed in no time at all.

“Buzz.” As for the young emperor, he released chaos lights from his primal fate palaces. It only took a second for him to return to his peak condition.

Only their robe and hair were a mess. Otherwise, they were exactly the same as before.

The crowd naturally became jealous after seeing their innate gifts. Those wounds could have left them bedridden for an entire year. In fact, some might not be able to fully heal for the rest of their lives, always carrying the dao injuries or internal physical injuries. This didn’t apply to the two geniuses.

Of course, they weren’t in the mood to appreciate their fortune. Before fighting Li Qiye, they had already prepared mentally to lose. Alas, his power far exceeded their imagination, resulting in a swift defeat. This was their most frightening opponent since their dao debut.

They were aware of terrifying existences looming in this world. However, these existences normally didn’t show up. Moreover, they could take these beings on after becoming a dao lord.

Li Qiye was a different story. Despite being a youth, he was at a whole other level.

“Anything else? Or is it time to rely on your sect?” Li Qiye said.

Normally, they were the ones saying this line. Now, they have been pushed to the very edge.

“We had a dao discussion and came up with a particular technique.” Five-sun King responded: “Would you like to see it, Dao Brother?”

“One move to decide everything.” The young emperor seemed eager to test it out.
