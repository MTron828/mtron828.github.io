Chen Cangsheng was surprised to see Li Qiye. He smiled and said: “We meet again, Brother.”

“Indeed.” Li Qiye nodded and smiled back.

Cangsheng took a closer look at Li Qiye and became curious: “Brother, may I ask why you’re here in Ancient Crimson?”

He had no ulterior motive in prying. This was only out of curiosity. He then realized that he might have been too intrusive and apologized: “I apologize for being nosy.”

“I’m just passing by, that’s all.” Li Qiye told the truth. His friends were long gone now; only memories remained.

“I see, as for me, I’m searching for the traces of a senior who visited before.” Cangsheng revealed while pointing at the ocean: “He fought in this place before.”

The two sides of Ancient Crimson were dramatically different. One side had calm waves while the other had dangers everywhere.

There were actually other islands in front of them. They weren’t as large as Ancient Crimson but still had rolling mountains and hills.

However, they have been destroyed. Only one-half of one island remained. Another was pierced completely and seawater gushed from the hole. One more was cut into two halves. There were rubbles and boulders everywhere - most likely remnants of destroyed islands.

Moreover, the waves weren’t calm either. They saw a tsunami raging from a distance, towering at a thousand meters. There were massive whirlpools as well.

This place wasn’t overly dangerous for cultivators as long as they kept a distance. Getting too close would result in being dragged inside by an unknown force. Waves of energy were still emanating from the center.

This power originated from the previous battle. Though many years have passed, the remnant energies remained in a dangerous manner.

“This is the battlefield of the overlords.” Cangsheng told Li Qiye.

“Overlords?” Li Qiye glanced at it.

“Ten thousand years ago, the overlords fought here and destroyed this ocean. It shocked the entire world.” Cangsheng elaborated.

“Who are the overlords?” Li Qiye chuckled, not really paying it any mind.

“You don’t know the five overlords of Sword Continent?” Cangsheng found this surprising.

“No.” Li Qiye said.

Normally, whenever the five overlords were brought up in Sword Continent, the crowd would show their respect and awe. All cultivators knew about the five regardless of their background.

They were mountains towering over everyone else. People had no choice but to look up to them. The five represented the highest echelon of power in the continent.

Some believed that only dao lords could compete against them, no one else.

“You really haven’t heard of them? Are you a new cultivator, Brother?” Cangsheng inquired because Li Qiye didn’t look like a new cultivator.

“I’m just a passerby who doesn’t know much about this region.” Li Qiye smiled.

“The five overlords are the strongest characters in our continent. Only the dao lords can take them on.” Cangsheng said: “They fought in this area before, completely changing the landscape. No one can get close even now.”

“Why did they fight?” Li Qiye smiled.

“The details were unclear. Rumor has it that it had something to do with the Myriad Era Dao Sword.” Cangsheng said.

“I see.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Do you know about it? It is one of the nine grand sword dao, matchless in history.” Cangsheng went on.

“Not too clear.” Li Qiye said.

Cangsheng found this astonishing as well and stared at Li Qiye as if he was a monster.

The sword was everything in this continent. Its inhabitants have been connected with this sword dao since birth. They lived and died for the sword. Thus, this continent was unique in both its power and purity.

People in this continent haven’t heard about many things. However, all knew about the nine grand swords.

This was another name for the nine paths of Finality Sword, one of the nine Heavenly Scriptures. It encompassed nine heavenly swords and nine sword dao.

Each dao had a sword counterpart. Thus, they were the strongest when used together. The combination could allow anyone to dominate regardless of their cultivation.

Moreover, a myth said that Sword Continent actually came from this scripture. This was the reason why its inhabitants were so obsessed with the sword.

They grew up hearing stories about the scripture and the nine dao. However, Li Qiye said he wasn’t too clear on this issue. Was he still a member of Sword Continent?

Cangsheng ignored this and went on: “It’ll take more than three days and three nights for me to go on about the nine swords. The most mysterious is the one we brought up earlier, Myriad Era.”

“Most mysterious?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Ever since these swords started appearing, people obtained and lost them across the eras. But, no one has seen Myriad Era yet.” Cangsheng elaborated.

Everyone was curious about this sword since its peers have shown up before. One sword god said that its appearance was inevitable.

Perhaps it had shown up before, people just didn’t know about it. In this case, its master should have become famous or started a powerful sect.

This never occurred. Therefore, this sword remained a puzzle.
