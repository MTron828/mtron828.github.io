Chapter 549: Change Of Mind

At this point, Long Zuntian went back to the Phoenix Maiden’s side and said in a serious tone: “Young Miss, it is not too late if you want to leave now. I will escort you out.”

His sudden words caused the maiden’s heart to sink. She asked: “What is Senior trying to say?”

Long Zuntian didn’t look at her but rather stared intensely at Li Qiye and said: “I am old and wish to live in seclusion. I’m afraid I won’t be able to help Virtuous Nephew Di Zuo any longer. But before leaving, I can escort you safely away from here.”

Long Zuntian was extremely cautious of Li Qiye. After the exchange, he immediately knew he had met a terrifying opponent because he couldn’t tell which physique Li Qiye had.

Long Zuntian retreating caused the maiden to change her expression. She quickly tried to retain him: “Senior Long is too humble, you are a supreme genius of a generation...”

Long Zuntian hastily interrupted her and said: “Young Miss, you should leave.”

His attitude perplexed many. The victor had yet to be decided between him and Li Qiye. Many were more optimistic about him and felt that he would surely defeat Li Qiye.

But now, Long Zuntian chose to withdraw. He no longer showed his usual proud attitude, causing everyone to feel that something was amiss. No one thought that he was afraid of Li Qiye. In the past, he had even declined the Myriad Bones Throne right away. A proud person like Long Zuntian would not be afraid of Li Qiye. Moreover, he had a great advantage by having a higher cultivation than Li Qiye.

However, to the astonishment of others, he still wanted to pull out. This was akin to lowering his own prestige and leaving a stain on his illustrious reputation.

Why was he determined to leave despite the marring on his reputation? No one understood why, not even the Phoenix Maiden. He was Di Zuo’s dao mentor and she knew that he was not afraid of anyone, but now he wanted to leave.

She took a deep breath and shook her head in response: “Senior Long, if you want to leave, then I won’t hold you back, but I will not retreat. No matter how strong this human might be, I will not let the human race’s scheme come into fruition. I will not let Li Qiye massacre our young ones not just because I am from the Myriad Bones Throne, but also for the sake of the ghost race!”

Long Zuntian shook his head as he listened to her righteous words. He understood what she was trying to do. He sighed in response and repeated the same phrase: “I am old... This is the world of the young people now. What admirable courage.”

No one knew what he was lamenting about; was it her courage or something else? He then left behind his last words: “Take care, Young Miss.” He then flew away and disappeared into the horizon in an instant.

A lot of the crowd couldn’t help themselves from becoming dumbstruck as they watched him fly away. From start to finish, no one understood why he left. He was absolutely not weaker than Li Qiye so he couldn’t be afraid of him.

Then for what reason did he leave? All were lost at the reason why, including the maiden.

In fact, it was a thought at the spur of the moment, resulting in him no longer being optimistic about Di Zuo! He was a peerless talent of his own generation. When he was young, he was not much weaker than Di Zuo or Tian Lunhui.

He agreed to leave his seclusion to help Di Zuo because he valued Di Zuo’s talents. Seeing Di Zuo’s confidence reminded him of his past self.

He regretted the fact that he was born during the Difficult Dao Era where one couldn’t become an Immortal Emperor, so he placed his hopes on Di Zuo. When facing an opponent like Tian Lunhui or Chan Yang, he trusted that Di Zuo would come out victorious all the way until he reached the imperial throne.

But today, his trust was shaken, especially after his one blow with Li Qiye. He understood one thing immediately — Li Qiye was more terrifying than he imagined. Although he couldn’t discern Li Qiye’s physique at that moment, his intuition told him that it was more than just a simple Immortal Physique.

He felt an illusion as if Li Qiye had two Immortal Physiques, but anyone with a sliver of common sense knew that this was impossible. Nevertheless, this striking intuition resonated powerfully in his mind.

What if Li Qiye had two Immortal Physiques? Long Zuntian didn’t dare to think about this any longer. Li Qiye was already heaven-defying enough to the point where he could compete against any of the three heroes. However, what if his ace card was not the nine stars and ten palaces, not an invincible merit law, but something else?

For example, an impossible thing like one body with two Immortal Physiques? He began to believe that this was the most plausible explanation, and he knew that Di Zuo would suffer a terrible defeat, thus resulting in his retreat. He didn’t want to see the moment of Di Zuo’s utter defeat!

After he left, Li Qiye looked straight at the Phoenix Maiden and said: “Now, who else is willing to fight for you?”

“Even if I am alone, I will neither retreat nor compromise!” The maiden took a deep breath and spoke in a dignified manner: “Even if my own power is insignificant, I will still stand before you to stop your evil plan from stretching its cruel grasp towards the ghost race! If my death can wake up the ghost race... then my death is a cheap price to pay!”

The maiden spoke with dignity. She slowly uttered each word with a heroic attitude that resonated with the crowd.

She spoke as if Li Qiye was an unpardonable and sinful devil and her current actions won the admiration and support of many spectators!

Li Qiye shook his head while looking at her dignified appearance and smilingly said: “To tell the truth, I do admire your courage a little bit. You know that it is impossible yet you still try... Truly excellent.”

“For the ghost race, my own life is nothing.” The maiden proudly proclaimed: “Even if I have to sacrifice my life, I will never let you get away with...”

Li Qiye interrupted her and said: “Yes, I know, I am the most heinous villain. Whether it is for Di Zuo or the ghost race, I will give you a meaningful death.”

The maiden watched Li Qiye approach. She took a deep breath and showed no signs of escaping before dryly speaking: “I know you are very strong, but I will still try despite my weakness! Let the rise of the ghost race start with me!”

Many ghost cultivators watched this scene. Once Li Qiye got even closer, many people couldn’t help but take a step forward. One ghost cultivator with his blood boiling exclaimed with emotion: “Li! If you want to touch even a hair of the maiden, you will have to walk over our corpses first!”

“The disciples of the ghost race will not let you kill as you please!” Many royal lords and sect masters were moved and wanted to group up to kill Li Qiye.

At this point, two men suddenly descended from the sky and went in front of the maiden to shield her. Their blood energies were like divine tsunamis, much stronger than the group of ghost cultivators who were in front of her just now.

Although the sect masters and royal lords were moved, none of them, at this moment, wanted to step out. On the other hand, the younger cultivators were standing by her side.

These two men from the sky, with their surging energies, were like two young True Gods. They were the Titanic Crescent Saint Child and Ghost Insect Evil Child. Although the Saint Child’s stature was humble, with his spewing blood energy, he appeared incredibly tall and powerful.

“We are all responsible for the rise and fall of the ghost race. As a man, how could we let a weak girl take the vanguard?” The Saint Child spoke with gravity: “Li Qiye, don’t think that you can display your brutality here!”

Li Qiye looked at the Saint Child and Evil Child and laughed: “Oh? The two of you still haven’t left? Does the Titanic Crescent Sacred Ground and Insect King Lineage want to renege on the deal?”

These two imperial lineages still hadn’t left; they were like tigers eyeing their prey, wishing to push Li Qiye to his demise. However, because of the deal, these lineages had yet to make a move. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“The deal is one thing.” The Evil Child smiled with a dark shade and continued: “We will not touch the treasures at this place and can leave at any moment. However, if anyone wishes to kill ghost disciples and the seeds of the ghosts, then I, as a member of the ghost race, and the Insect King Lineage, as a great power of the ghost race, have the responsibility to protect the ghost race’s safety!”

The Titanic Crescent Saint Child also spoke in an awe-inspiring manner: “Our Titanic Crescent Sacred Ground will also not let anyone harm the ghost race! The Divine Spark Phoenix Maiden is a woman with a heroic heart. She doesn’t even mind sacrificing herself for the sake of the ghost race! Men like us should contribute to the ghost race. In my eyes, the honor of oneself is a trivial matter, the well-being of the ghost race is a much bigger matter!”

“Li Qiye, you wish to harm the ghost disciples. Although we had a deal, so what if I lose my own honor for the ghost race? For the ghost race’s safety, I will not leave this place and allow you to massacre more ghost disciples! I will stop your brutality!” The Saint Child continued on in a resounding manner: “You can say that I have reneged my promise, and the world can curse me for going back on the deal. I am willing to bear this eternal infamy all to kill you today to rid the ghost race of your evil and bring back peace!”
