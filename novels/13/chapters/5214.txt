Chapter 5215: Tiny Divine Alliance

“Are you serious?” Li Qiye asked with a smile.

“With your permission, I will propose for you to become an esteemed guest adviser of Divine Alliance. If you don’t think this is enough, we can negotiate further.” Ye Fantian added with confidence.

This was a bold move given her status as a junior and current cultivation.

“Divine Alliance is too puny to catch my interest.” Li Qiye shook his head.

Her eyes involuntarily narrowed as she tried to see through him after hearing this.

The comment would be considered excessively arrogant when uttered by anyone, including emperors and dao lords.

Ever since its founding, Divine Alliance has been a behemoth in the upper continents, surviving one great war after another. One apex conqueror alone was not enough to take it down, not even All-things Dao Lord or Sword Queen.

She had met mighty cultivators before but none displayed the same level of arrogance.

“I see, looks like our small temple cannot accommodate a grand god such as yourself, Young Noble.” She bowed and said.

“That’s right.” He nodded in response.

“I apologize for bothering you, Young Noble. Goodbye.” She didn’t waste time and left decisively - something many big shots couldn’t do.

He chuckled and continued to observe the various statues. There were many familiar faces - Heavenly Sage Yuan, Immortal Emperor Qilin, Peerless Monarch, Adamantine God Monarch…

These wise sages didn’t belong to Imperial Gate but contributed greatly. They founded QIlin Manor, Alchemy Dao, and Iron Tree in the nearby regions. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

There were those he didn’t recognize at all. They were after his time and joined the alliance afterward. Today, none of them were still around.

After scanning the entire field, Li Qiye let out a sigh. Many waited for his return but alas, time didn’t permit.

He shook his head and continued to enter Imperial Gate.

“Young Noble!” Suddenly, someone shouted with excitement and rushed towards him.

“I didn’t expect to see you again!” The person couldn’t contain her excitement and panted heavily, whether it be from running too fast or being overwhelmed with emotions.

It was none other than the successor of Alchemy Dao - Saintess Shao Yao.

“Well, here I am.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

She blushed after realizing her folly, thinking that she was being too obvious. It’s just that she couldn’t control herself just now.

“Why are you here?” He asked.

“I am visiting the ancestors of Imperial Gate under the order of Senior Uncle regarding the auction.” She lowered her head so much that her head was nearly buried in her chest as she said softly.

“You want the treasures too.” Li Qiye didn’t find this surprising.

“We want the immortal order.” She had no problem revealing information to Li Qiye.

“For what?” Li Qiye said.

She stole glances at him and answered: “I don’t know the details, but the monarchs said something about Calamity Dao Lord.”

“Calamity?” Li Qiye didn’t expect this.

“Why are you here, Young Noble?” She nodded before asking.

“Just reminiscing a bit, time flies by so quickly that I’m on the verge of forgetting a few things. This is to prevent that.” Li Qiye sighed in response.

“Forget?” She found this puzzling because cultivators had nearly flawless memories.

“Let’s go inside.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“I already tried but couldn’t see them.” She said.

“They won’t meet you?” Li Qiye asked.

“No, I didn’t have permission to see them. The truth is that Hundred Dao has taken control of Imperial Gate. The ancestors are staying way back, the majority of the outskirts are under the jurisdiction of Hundred Dao. They say it is for safety reasons.” She said.

“The reason is to subdue Imperial Gate.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Yes.” She lowered her voice: “That’s why I have to go report to the senior uncle now.”

“We’re moving ahead first.” Li Qiye smirked.

She nodded repeatedly like a chicken eating grain. She didn’t want to return to Alchemy Dao either, preferring to stick with Li Qiye as long as possible. Her heart fluttered with joy due to this opportunity.

The two were greeted with towering cliffs. On the walls were infamous ancient murals that have survived for eras now.

In the middle were the imperial steps - a bridge leading straight up into the sect. Many geniuses considered this a challenge.

It was rather new, only started by Suppression Conqueror recently. Only by crossing this bridge would one be able to reach the renowned eighteen statues of the dragon lords.

Prior to this, only members of Imperial Gate and those with permission were eligible to see them. Now, it became open to the public.

“Hundred Dao is in charge of this area too.” Shao Yao whispered.

“It’s a good plan.” Li Qiye said before looking at the large murals.

They were skillfully engraved into the side cliffs, depicting old stories in a vague manner. One only had a few lines to show a standing figure. Another depicted a great tree or the scene of a skirmish…
