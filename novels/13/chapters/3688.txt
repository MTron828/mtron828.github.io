Chapter 3689: Horrified

Li Xiangquan and Zhang Yunzhi felt as if they were seeing a ghost. Nothing was stranger than the events today.

Li Qiye’s cultivation was far inferior compared to them. They knew that Li Qiye had heaven-defying methods and insane luck. However, this shouldn’t be enough to make up the gap.

Their cultivation was several realms higher than him. Moreover, they had powerful treasures and weapons as well.

That should have been more than enough to deal with Li Qiye or even kill him. Alas, reality showed that he only needed two moves to break them down.

Fear began to overwhelm them, causing their knees to buckle.

“One last move. Your lives are mine.” Li Qiye smiled and pointed his saber at the paled duo.

Li Qiye’s casual stance and smile looked like that of a grim reaper now. Those who laughed at him before were shuddering with fear.

They felt as if the saber was pointing at their heart and could easily pierce through it. A chill coursed down their spine.

Worst of all, dodging was impossible. This meant that their lives were in his grasp.

“The last move....” One cultivator said.

The tone of Li Qiye’s voice was nonchalant as well, lacking any pressure and threat. Nonetheless, the listeners still became frozen. A hush took over the area since no one doubted his ability at this point.

Everyone thought that he would be able to do so. Li Xiangquan and Zhang Yunzhi’s struggle was futile.

“That’s why he said they were dead men from the start.” One expert murmured, realizing that Li Qiye was telling the truth.

The duo’s clenched fists were shaking. A while ago, such a comment would make them livid and murderous. Now, the only thing left was fear.

They instinctively stared at his saber and felt a prick in their heart. The piercing was inevitable. The shadow of death has engulfed them.

“Buzz!” They immediately turned and fled towards the horizon.

They didn’t dare to participate in the last move and chose to run instead. This surprised some people at first but then again, it was understandable.

Even insects wanted to live, let alone nobles like them who were used to luxury.

Unfortunately, it was improper for clan members like them to run. Some would rather die in battle than flee.

The latter meant never being able to raise their head again on top of shaming their clan. In this case, they were the successor of their respective clan, representing its honor and glory. This made the situation even worse.

Nonetheless, the crowd remained silent. They wouldn’t have fared any better against someone as devilish as Li Qiye. Perhaps they would have run after the first move as well.

“Leaving so soon?” They didn’t make it far before someone appeared before them. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

People saw that it was none other than Li Qiye. He somehow caught up to them.

The two immediately stopped and staggered backward, afraid of being too close.

“I said three moves to take your lives, so it’ll happen.” Li Qiye smiled while playing with his saber.

“Brother Li, we sincerely accept our defeat. You’re a great man so please, show benevolence and excuse our transgression.” Zhang Yunzhi cupped his fist.

“We’re inferior to a talent like you, please don’t stoop down to our level.” Li Xiangquan did the same.

The two accepted their defeat but everyone knew that they were begging for mercy without being overly blatant.

It was already difficult enough to accept defeat given their status.

“But I’m a man of my words.” Li Qiye replied.

The two staggered backward again after hearing this.

“Brother Li, it’s pointless killing me, please show mercy.” Li Xiangquan gritted his teeth and finally begged.

“Please spare us.” Zhang Yunzhi hurriedly added.

The crowd stared at Li Qiye to see if he would actually spare the two. After all, a few would choose against escalating the issue.

“Would I have the chance to beg if I had lost?” Li Qiye smiled and said.

The duo had no response, the same with the crowd. Everyone knew the answer right away.

These two would have not shown mercy to Li Qiye regardless of his begging. They would have subjected him to a fate worse than death.

“Bro-brother Li, it’s not like that.” Zhang Yunzhi had a forced smile that was uglier than if he were crying: “We won’t let you be empty-handed. You can name any condition as long as you drop this problem.”

“We will do our best to satisfy your demands.” Li Xiangquan jumped in.

They only wanted to survive; pride no longer mattered. A borrowed life was still better than death.

The crowd thought that this was a tempting offer because the Li and the Zhang were rich, definitely two fat lambs.

“I don’t want anything but your heads.” Li Qiye remained unmoved.

The duo turned red after hearing this.

“Li, don’t push it!” Li Xiangquan roared furiously.

They gave up and begged in public. This was humiliating enough since they threw away their reputation and glory.

Now, this guy still won’t spare them? Embarrassment and shame swiftly turned to rage.
