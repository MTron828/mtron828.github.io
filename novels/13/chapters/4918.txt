Chapter 4919: Immemorial Epoch War

“Boom!” The teacup in Bai Shaojin’s hand fell to the ground and broke to pieces as he stared at Li Qiye in a daze.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, still enjoyed his tea with a smirk.

“Brother Bai, here you go.” Yunyun handed him another cup.

“I’m sorry.” He apologized to her after calming down: “I’ve made a fool out of myself.”

Yunyun only smiled and sat down, ready to listen.

“Young Noble, you seem to know everything.” Shaojin said with admiration.

“This shouldn’t be surprising. Anyone who knows about that period has heard of it before.” Li Qiye smiled.

“So what is this vessel?” Yunyun asked.

Li Qiye simply smiled and blew on the steaming liquid before taking a sip.

“It’s something left behind by an ancient emperor, an exceptional one at that.” Shaojin elaborated.

“You said something about a residence?” Yunyun recalled a particular legend about a mysterious faction.

“Yes, this faction included Immortal Emperor Ba Zhen and Immortal Emperor Can Long along with countless other emperors. They fought against Celestial Court and became a pillar of The People, always contending against the court’s main armies.” Yunyun brought this up.

“I heard similar things but who can really know the truth and details of the immemorial war.” Shaojin said.

Yunyun nodded in agreement. Nonetheless, that distant war still affected the current landscape.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

According to several accounts, the calamity descended and Celestial Court illuminated the world with their gods returning.

For some reason, it started an expedition against those they deemed as sinners. This became a war between the hundred races versus devils, heaveners, and diviners. The classification known as The People and The Race didn’t exist back then.

This was a large-scale maneuver. Celestial Court ambushed, captured, and massacred entire populations. Even those protecting the sinners were branded.

Initially, only a few sects were involved in this matter. Later on, virtually all powers from both sides joined the fight.

Since Celestial Court had contributed to saving the world from calamity, they were respected and garnered great support.

Their momentum seemed unstoppable as they declared war against the hundred races, going as far as hunting emperors.

On the opposing side, Immortal Emperor Can Long and Immortal Emperor Hao Hai struggled against them. Celestial Court simply had a superior number of Grand Emperors and Immortal Monarchs.

Immortal Emperor Ba Zhen joined them subsequently and the situation escalated. None could escape the destruction, not even behemoths such as the Qian Clan.

This particular clan was once the leader of the three races. Alas, Celestial Court somehow branded them as sinners as well, resulting in their destruction.

The war lasted for ten thousand years, burying countless sects and kingdoms in the process. Graves of emperors and monarchs became more common than ever before. It was estimated that more than a hundred fell.

Finally, Celestial Court condemned everyone who was not on its side as sinners. The latter naturally would not accept this.

From then on, they called themselves The People and Celestial Court’s allies were known as The Race.

“I just know that the casualties were immense on both sides, billions and billions of people died.” Bai Shaojin sighed and whispered.

“The Race deserves it for supporting Celestial Court.” Yunyun naturally stood on the side of The People.

“You can’t say that when not all of the three races are on Celestial Court’s side. Some hundred races’ members defected as well.” Shaojin said.

“... You’re right, my comment was too extreme.” Yunyun admitted: “The Qian was condemned as sinners as well, then we have the War Monarch Clan opposing Celestial Court subsequently.”

“Indeed, the monarch clan stood on the side of the Qian and was wiped out by Celestial Court.” Shaojin added.

The Qian’s influence couldn’t be overstated once as the leader of the three races. Alas, as the immemorial war went on, few wanted to support them against Celestial Court. One exception was the War Monarch Clan.

Rumor has it that they were close friends. The monarch clan’s descendants were protected by the invincible World Emperor of the Qian. Thus, they didn’t forget the love and sided with the Qian later on.

“So why are you here, Brother Bai?” Yunyun realized that the conversation has steered in a different path.

“Just to ask the young noble a few things about the past to satiate my curiosity.” Shaojin smiled.

He then asked Li Qiye: “I believe the faction started by the benevolent emperor was destroyed in the war as well. Its name was Immemorial Palace, right?”

“Yes. Go on.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmm…” Shaojin hesitated for a bit before continuing: “There is a particular legend.”

He then looked around first as if this was something that shouldn’t be said.

“What legend?” Yunyun played along.

“It says that as Immemorial Palace was on the verge of destruction, Feather Immortal Monarch sealed everything from the palace into a vessel known as Benevolence. I heard this when I was younger, have you heard something similar?” Shaojin asked. [1]

“I’m afraid my knowledge is insufficient, I haven’t heard this before.” Yunyun shook her head.

“I see…” Shaojin was disappointed and then asked Li Qiye: “What about you, Young Noble?”

Li Qiye sipped the tea again before smiling at him: “There’s something you don’t realize.”

“Huh?” Shaojin was confused.

“Do you know why you’re still able to stand before me, alive?” Li Qiye answered with a question.

“!” Shaojin was no fool and reacted: “Why do you want to kill me?”

Though he wasn’t a supreme genius, he wasn’t weak and had incredible resources. Another youth would find it impossible to kill him.

“Don’t doubt the truth, one finger of mine is more than enough to kill you.” Li Qiye read the youth’s thoughts.

Shaojin turned red after hearing the blatant disdain. Nonetheless, he took a deep breath and slightly bowed: “Young Noble, why haven’t you?”

1. I tried to find this particular monarch but didn’t see anyone. The characters are Yu + Qian, Yu Qianxuan was a character in the tenth world arc, not sure if this is her. ☜
