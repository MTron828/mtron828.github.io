Chapter 4633: Women Can Fight Too

“Grand Gate is ready to fight!” A genius in the crowd became excited and shouted.

“Our eighteen brothers from Skycall will take you on!” A great power stated its number advantage.

Since Golden Gate didn’t state any restrictions, it meant that a sect could have unlimited participants. Taking advantage of this was the right call, especially against certain geniuses.

“Number doesn’t matter.” A genius from a sacred ground snorted: “All eighteen of you can come together. I, Water Dragon Saint Child, alone am enough.”

“If you’re as amazing as you claim to be, challenge True Immortal Spirit instead of us.” The opponent immediately retorted.

This shut the genius up right away. Although he was strong, he was certainly not a match for True Immortal Spirit.

“He’s not invincible beneath the five conquerors at all. Someone else will take him down.” Another sneered.

“That’s right, there are still Jadedragon Monarch and Paramount Scion. True Immortal Spirit isn’t the clear favorite here.” One more nodded in agreement.

“If that’s the case, show me what you all can do.” A flood of power suddenly erupted in all directions.

“True Immortal Spirit!” Everyone followed the voice and saw True Immortal Spirit jumping up onto the battle stage.

His eyes pulsed brightly, intimidating everyone nearby. His haters didn’t dare to say more, aware that they couldn’t beat him in a one-on-one fight.

“Wait a minute, there’s something different about his aura. There is a hint of a dao lord aura.” An ancestor became emotional after noticing something peculiar.

“A dao lord aura?!” Those nearby shuddered after hearing this.

“You’re right.” A high elder confirmed while feeling surprised.

The crowd exchanged glances in confusion but the big shots knew what was going on.

“Ancestors, you are correct.” True Immortal Spirit noticed the gazes and revealed: “Since I am incapable, I am here with a dao lord weapon, ready to fight the heroes of the world.”

This made the crowd take a deep breath. Just his cultivation alone was virtually unbeatable but he had a dao lord weapon too? This meant that even Jadedragon Monarch and Paramount Scion might not be able to win.

With the help of a dao lord weapon, his claim about taking on everyone became increasingly legitimate.

“Who will fight me?” He looked around and asked. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

None of the geniuses here wanted to be the first to test the dao lord weapon. Sending one after another to fatigue him wouldn’t work either. Being struck once by the weapon meant death.

Though some wanted to become famous, they still feared the weapon. Death meant the end of everything and the risk was considerably high.

“Bam!” Suddenly, a person landed and made the whole stage tremble.

The newcomer was none other than a girl in armor, looking as fierce as can be.

“Godwhip Princess!” Many recognized her and found this astonishing.

Of course, this wasn’t due to her reputation being overwhelming but the fact that she was a woman.

The battle stage was a way for Golden Gate to find a groom for its golden daughter. Therefore, her involvement was rather perplexing.

“I’m here to fight.” Her voice was both powerful and pleasing.

“Is this okay?” A young cultivator murmured.

True Immortal Spirit himself was surprised. He responded: “Your Highness, this is a martial competition to find a groom.”

“There’s no rule forbidding women from fighting.” She proudly said.

With that, everyone turned toward Golden Mad Fist, True Immortal Spirit included.

Mad Fist was surprised as well. The rules didn’t specifically state the sex but this should have been obvious.

“Ahem.” He said: “There are no rules about it indeed. Feel free to deliberate and state your opinion.”

“If women can fight too, it’ll be a bit chaotic.” One youth said.

“I don’t think there’s a problem since there is a hole in the rules.” An expert added.

“Yes, why can’t we fight too?” One female cultivator sided with Godwhip Princess.

“Your Highness, we support you, see how long you’ll be able to stand on stage!” The others shouted.

“You can do it!” She garnered the support of the fairer sex.

“Senior Mad Fist, if a woman were to win, would Miss Ye have to marry her?” Someone boldly asked.

“Golden Gate will keep our promises.” Mad Fist had to respond.

“Then there is no problem with my fighting.” Godwhip Princess said.

True Immortal Spirit didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. He said: “Princess, do you wish to marry Miss Ye?”

The crowd started loudly talking about this possibility.
