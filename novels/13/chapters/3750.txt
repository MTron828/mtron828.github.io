Chapter 3751: Scarlet Moon Seal

“Wow, a dao lord weapon.” Others shuddered and some even felt the urge to prostrate while staring at the seal.

Even Hu Ben and Phantom Sacred Child stared carefully at this artifact.

“How many can just take out a dao lord weapon like her?” An expert murmured.

“Senior Sister Xiaoyue actually has, has a dao lord weapon...” One student from Duality couldn’t believe it.

The crowd simply didn’t expect her coffer to be so deep.

“That’s a descendant of a dao lord for you.” Some students took a deep breath.

Someone close to her said: “I’ve heard rumors that she’s from an ancient clan with a dao lord. Seems like it’s true.”

“She has to be the strongest out of the five heroes.” An older student commented.

Chi Xiaoyue has always kept a low profile and rarely fought anyone. In terms of authority and fame, she was far inferior compared to Li Xiangquan and Zhang Yunzhi. In fact, even Lin Hao was more popular.

In reality, she always kept a distance from most events and matters. That’s why even her stepping up today came as a surprise.

Because of this, most didn’t remember her. Zhang Yunzhi and Li Xiangquan were too bright in comparison.

It seemed that they should have been paying more attention to her because she actually had the most resources out of the five heroes.

The other two certainly had a prestigious background. However, they definitely didn’t have a dao lord weapon on them.

“Duality Academy has some hidden dragons and crouching tigers.” The experts here had this thought.

Hu Ben and Phantom who were far more famous might not have a weapon of this level either, unlike Chi Xiaoyue.

Only Dugu Lan had a calm expression as if this was expected.

“Scarlet Moon Seal from Scarlet Moon Dao Lord.” Liu Huaishi recognized the weapon.

“It’s only an incomplete treasure, not comparable to a real one.” Xiaoyue wasn’t complacent.

“Is that the genius dao lord whose fate is unknown?” One ancestor talked among his peers.

This dao lord had limited influence since he disappeared right after becoming one. He didn’t leave behind legendary tales and contributions. [1]

During his youth, some actually considered him as the number one genius in Eight Desolaces. His fate was truly tragic and people forgot about him.

He died too early and didn’t finish refining this seal. It couldn’t be considered a complete dao lord weapon.

Nonetheless, Liu Huaishi still had a serious expression.

“Looks like there’s hope.” Excitement returned to the students of Duality.

“She’ll definitely be able to pull out a win now with that thing.” Another student said. There was no doubt that her chance of victory was far higher now.

“So that’s why she accepted the challenge, she came prepared.” One genius who was worried at the start concluded. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Let’s get started again. Eight Celestial Dragons!” Huaishi roared and swung the whip.

“Boom!” Sixteen dragons came down from above, swinging their claws at Chi Xiaoyue.

“Break.” She was undeterred by this special move and leaped into the sky with her seal in front.

The power of the seal contained the might of a dao lord. Even the strongest beings would be reduced to ashes.

This was naturally the case for the dragons. Liu Huaishi groaned from the impact and was blown away; his whip disintegrated.

“Yes!!” The spectators from the holy ground applauded.

“Well done!” Another shouted excitedly, looking joyous.

“You’re the light of our academy!” One student loudly shouted.

It became a tie now so everyone could breathe easily. The atmosphere prior was just too much to take. At least it looked like an even fight between Buddha and Righteous now.

“So strong...” Liu Huaishi had blood streaming out of his mouth as he said.

“Brother Liu, you haven’t gone all out yet. It’s time now.” Xiaoyue calmly said without a hint of arrogance after the successful blow.

“I have to if I want to leave alive.” Liu Huaishi smiled wryly.

The crowd couldn’t believe it. Huaishi’s power earlier was enough to deter all the geniuses here. He was still holding back?

Anxiety returned to the geniuses after hearing this.

“Don’t worry, Senior Sister Xiaoyue has a dao lord weapon.” One student said. Who knows if it was to cheer for Xiaoyue or just to convince himself about the chances?

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Huaishi’s hand started shaking before another whip appeared.

This whip was different from the one prior. It looked like a thick chain consisting of golden links.

Gales started blowing away the clouds above after he held it. It emitted the power of a supreme. He seemed rather unstoppable after summoning this weapon.
