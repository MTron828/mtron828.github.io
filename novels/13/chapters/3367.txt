The protectors and elders were surprised and stared towards the direction of South Conch Peak. They saw the incoming sword light and their eyes narrowed, aware of the frightening implication.

The peak lords in the clouds also did the same. Though they expected this to happen, the unraveling reality still shook them to the core.

Ping Suoweng had a complicated expression. He had spent thousands of years and couldn’t reach this level. Li Qiye had claimed another victim by easily activating the sword.

Iron Whip Demon King also understood what was going on since he was a peak lord.

“Die!” The demon king roared while his red radiance oozed out. The cauldron was resplendent as well and the tiger god’s demonic power erupted in an endless manner.

He fully went all out while burning his own true blood. The next attack would be his ultimate blow. This was his last chance and he must win as fast as possible or face the consequences.

“Rumble!” The myriad beasts also went crazy after this boost in power. They ravaged the land and destroyed the laws nearby. The ground around Li Qiye was being crushed.

“Clank!” The sword hymn could be heard again. Finally, a ray flew out of South Conch and immediately reigned over their head.

The sword intent released its might and drowned out the world. No evil could ever survive before its onslaught.

All became insignificant, whether it be other sacred cultivators or those standing at the apex. Divine beasts were no exception.

The spectators still had a hard time catching up with its speed. They didn’t realize Li Qiye already wielded a sword and casually swung it. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

He tore apart the world and released primordial chaos from the scar. From destruction came stillness and peace. The yin and yang and the karma cycle have been annihilated. The world returned to its origin.

Everyone shuddered with fear, including the older experts. They lost their courage and were completely suppressed by the slash.

Little did they know that the sword user was even more impressive than the sword itself. Just a casual swing from him was enough to take down Grand Dao Sacred Physique cultivators. Such power was not worth mentioning.

“Raaa! Aaaa!” It decapitated the myriad beasts. The heads were tossed into the air; the bodies dropped to the ground.

This magnificent scene was unreal and hellish. The powerful divine beasts fell victim to the slash. A stench of blood took over the area.

Not to mention the regular disciples, even someone like the chief elder fell down on his butt.

The peak lords instinctively touched their own neck to see if it was still there. They felt as if they had been decapitated too.

The slash cut through the demon king’s neck with unreal speed. He himself didn’t feel a thing.

In fact, no one really saw the glint of the blade. Only the top masters here sensed the slash coming for him.

Time came to a stop. Everything became infinitely slow. Once it started flowing again, blood flowed from a tiny wound in his neck in the form of a thin stream.

In this split second, the demon king finally realized what had just transpired. He knew that he was dead and that he had been decapitated. He instinctively grabbed his neck on the spot, trying to stop more blood from flowing outward.

It was too late. “Gush!” His head rolled off and blood gushed up high like the spring before spreading out like a blossoming flower.

“Noo!” He managed to scream once. The word stopped abruptly halfway. His severed head was pale with the mouth agape.

He most likely saw everything happening, the blood gushing from his eyes and the ground as the head rolled off. To see one’s own death from another angle was truly frightening.

“Boom!” His massive body finally fell down, causing debris to fly everywhere.

He was still alive and wanted to scream. Alas, no sound would come out. His eyes eventually closed.

He was as dead as can be. This was the start of his journey down to the Yellow River.

The slash also struck the cauldron and cut through the shell, separating the cauldron into two pieces. It instantly fled and disappeared from sight.

The aftermath was one of silence and dread.

A single slash ended the demon king and grievously damaged the Tiger God Cauldron. Everyone thought about it and could only come up with a single word - unbeatable! No other word could describe the current Li Qiye.

Putting the others aside, even the strongest Ping Suoweng trembled with fear - aware that he wouldn’t fare any better if he were in the demon king’s shoes.

One thing became abundantly clear to all. He was no longer the number one expert in Divine Black.

He took a deep breath and started thinking. He thought that he was very lucky for believing his own intuition. Li Qiye was immensely powerful and could easily destroy the sect.

His hands started shaking because if he had made one wrong move, only ashes would be left of the sect right now.
