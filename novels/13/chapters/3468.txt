The raving flames reached the sky and created a terrible storm seemingly hellbent on annihilating everything that got close enough. No force could withstand the heat, becoming insignificant in comparison.

Everyone outside the domain watched with bated breath; their eyes wide open. They wanted to see how he would face that terrible flame.

Even Skylight Dao Lord had to give up in the end. How could a junior at the Silver Carapace realm do better?

“Will there be a phoenix nest within that flame?” Someone boldly speculated. The rest felt the same way.

Li Qiye had a smile on his face while standing at the border of the fiery tempest.

Remember, no other places in the domain had visible fires. It was strange because this tempest ravaged everything yet it didn’t spread beyond this point. It seemed that it was content to stay in this place, performing its responsibility as a protector.

Perhaps this wasn’t a regular flame that came into being the normal way. Perhaps the phoenix itself created it for a purpose.

“He’s going into that inferno!” One spectator shouted after keeping a keen eye on Li Qiye.

Li Qiye took the first step and everyone thought that he could be annihilated by the inferno, either torn to shreds or reduced to ashes.

This was based on the fact that the invincible Skylight Dao Lord chose against trying to enter this place.

However, a miracle occurred since nothing happened to Li Qiye. The flames erupted but it didn’t rush towards him.

A gap emerged at the bottom of the inferno, akin to an entrance or a giant spreading its hands, wanting to embrace Li Qiye.

“How can this be?!” Everyone became astounded, unable to trust their own eyes.

Alas, this was reality. Li Qiye then disappeared into the ravaging flames. Its merciless destruction didn’t affect him at all. Not even a hair of his was hurt in the process.

“I believe everything now, this has to be a phoenix’s nest and he has the right bloodline.” Someone said with absolute confidence.

This speculation seemed to be all but confirmed.

“What a noble and rare bloodline, even the thinnest type will still let him have boundless potential.” Other geniuses became jealous.

Phoenixes being ancient divine beasts was a well-known fact. They existed in a time beyond tracing. Someone with this bloodline was meant for greatness, regardless of the quality of their blood.

“The first prince and the others got really unlucky. Li Qiye is invincible here, fighting him in this place was unwise.” Another couldn’t help but comment.

“Yes, they should have waited until he left this place and tried to kill him.” Another added with hindsight.

Li Qiye most likely had the power to control the inferno. This would allow him to be unbeatable in the domain.

Li Qiye calmly observed the area inside the inferno. The internal region didn’t have the same destructive affinity and the scorching heat. It was warm like a child sleeping in their mother’s embrace.

The flames served as the walls and the roof but they were as pleasant and comfortable as can be.

No existence and powers could enter this place. The barrier was perfect in separating the external world from this one.

This was indeed a phoenix’s nest, true to everyone’s expectation. It was created in an exquisite and meticulous manner. The entire place could be considered a grand dao.

The materials consisted of the precious phoenix-roost wood beams. Each was carefully placed in a particular order. Their length, age, and grains were unique. This allowed them to culminate into a supreme grand dao. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

When people look at it, they would think that it was the dao of a phoenix, not its nest.

“The final masterpiece during the last moment of a phoenix’s innate gift - rebirth.” Li Qiye sighed and praised.

This was their innate grand dao, completely unique. Li Qiye was one of the few who could actually understand it.

He had seen one again back in Stone Medicine World. Its corpse emerged again and Li Qiye let it fly towards the horizon.

The nest had a feather with a divine glow, as beautiful as can be. Once the faint, embedded runes on it were combined, the ancient character with the meaning of “virtue” came to be. This was the phoenix’s most precious feather.

Moreover, the center had an egg around the size of a large bowl, too magnificent to be described by words.

It looked as if it was made from snow-white jade, also pulsing with various runes depicting space, time, and the myriad ages.

It was surrounded by a gentle flame as if its mother was caressing it. Millions of years have passed but the incubation process still hasn’t been completed.
