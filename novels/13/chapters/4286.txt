Chapter 4287: Little Diamond Gate

“Well…” Elder Hu hesitated while all eyes were on him and Li Qiye.

Even a fool could tell how important this merit law was. That’s why their sect master risked and lost his life for it.

Elder Hu knew more about the value of this scroll than the others. The sect master had revealed his mission to the elders before departing.

“Sir, since the sect master had given it to you, please keep it.” After a long lull and internal struggle, he gave the scroll back to Li Qiye.

This prompted Li Qiye to smile and accept the scroll without saying anything.

“Elder, what is our next course of action?” One brilliant disciple asked while maintaining alert, vigilant of any incoming enemies.

“We’re bringing the sect master’s remains back to the sect. Summon everyone back as well, be swift and discreet.” Elder Hu ordered.

The juniors respectfully picked up their sect master’s corpse and were ready to retreat. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Sir, please come back to Little Diamond Gate with me.” Elder Hu bowed earnestly during the request.

“Little Diamond Gate?” Li Qiye repeated.

“Our sect master has passed on his position to you, Sir. This is a pivotal event and I do not dare to make a decision on my own. Please come back to our sect first if that is okay with you.” Elder Hu said.

They respected their sect master’s decision but this was still an utterly ridiculous command - letting an outsider take over.

He didn’t know whether Li Qiye wanted to be their sect master but either way, he must bring Li Qiye back to the sect first. They would then deliberate and come up with a decision.

He was sincere because putting the sect master position aside, Li Qiye would still be an esteemed guest.

‘How commendable.’ Li Qiye thought to himself while glancing at the corpse and Elder Hu.

“Very well, I’ll take a trip there.” He then agreed.

Of course, he didn’t give a damn about becoming a sect master. It’s just that a few things at play here amused him enough to pique his interest.

“After you, Sir.” Elder Hu heaved a sigh of relief and gestured.

They then moved at a rapid pace through obscured roads in order to avoid the powerful enemies.

Along the way, Li Qiye saw that the sect was weak indeed. The disciples were just average cultivators. A single branch from any large sect could annihilate Little Diamond.

However, their comradery from top to bottom was excellent. This might be due to the fact that it was a small sect so the members were closer and weren’t blinded by greed and competition.

They returned to the case of the sect. Li Qiye looked up and saw a notable aura, albeit tiny. The sect occupied a mountain range and a territory of a hundred miles or so. There weren’t many impressive architectures.

It was located in a tiny corner of Southern Desolace. Normally, a weak sect in this region would have a few hundred thousand to a million members.

Thus, Little Diamond was laughably weak in the grand scheme of things. A single expert from the larger sect could wipe them out.

Interestingly enough, this insignificant sect had an unbelievably deep history. Its founding was traced back to the previous epoch.

Alas, too much time had passed and the older members didn’t have concrete information regarding its history. All in all, they only knew that their sect was older than many behemoths in the present day.

The entrance had an arched gate with a plaque in the center - Little Diamond Gate. In reality, no current members could read these characters without knowing beforehand.

The plaque was far older than the entrance. The characters were impeccably written, clearly the work of a mighty master.

“Our sect has endured time itself, I don’t think there are many other sects as old as ours.” Elder Hu introduced Li Qiye to the sect.

“We might be small but we have survived for eras.” He added with pride, and rightfully so.

For example, that gate in front of them must have been rebuilt numerous times. Only the plaque was untouched.

“Right.” Li Qiye smiled because the characters were indeed from the nine worlds.

In other words, this validated the long history of Little Diamond.

Its existence was miraculous because not to mention such a weak sect, even some dominating behemoths have been reduced to ashes and disappeared.

“Patriarch Long lived in the ancient era and was a world-renowned cultivator who taught numerous geniuses. He had the title of “Diamond” so when he created our sect, he named it Little Diamond Gate.”

“Diamond?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, rumor has it that our patriarch cultivated an immortal physique known as Indestructible Diamond. He reached grand completion during his later days and became untouchable.” Elder Hu spoke with pride: “It is said that during his grand completion ceremony, even the Immortal Emperor came to congratulate him. Thus, we used to be the lord of an entire region.”

There was a lack of records regarding their patriarch since it was too long ago. Nonetheless, the members of the sect took pride in their glorious history. After all, they were nothing right now but at least they had this going for them.

Moreover, they could also say that they have outlasted virtually all other sects from the same period. Few could match them in this regard, one exception being Lion’s Roar Kingdom.

Elder Hu brought Li Qiye into the sect and prepared the highest accommodations possible. He then convened an emergency meeting with the other elders.

Losing their sect master was a heavy blow. Keep in mind that he was the strongest cultivator in the sect at the grand Yin Yang realm. They lost a stalwart pillar as a result.

Moreover, he died competing for a merit law. This wasn’t something that should be publicized so they silently buried him.

Now, they were lost regarding their newly-chosen sect master, Li Qiye. This was an unprecedented case for a small sect like them.
