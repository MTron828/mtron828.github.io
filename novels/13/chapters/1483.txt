“Clank!” After entering the valley, the general thrust his spear straight at Li Qiye.

The weapon carried a bright glimmer just like a shooting star crossing through the sky. The attack was ferocious and contained a force that could penetrate all things. Experts and deities would tremble before this attack from an Apex Godking.

Even though the spectators outside knew that this attack was aiming for Li Qiye and not them, they still felt a chill by their throats as if it was trying to pierce through them. They wanted to gasp, but there was no air. This was a very uncomfortable feeling.

The weaker cultivators fell down to the ground because this strike had enveloped this area. They couldn’t withstand this pressure and saw a vision of death.

“Clank!” Sparks went flying. This spear was indeed incredible, but Li Qiye stopped it with a saber in his left hand. The Benevolent Saber emitted a brilliance that jumped around on its blade, making it seem alive.

This immortal light made the edge as bright as snow. It looked just like a moon illuminating the entire area.

There was a majestic figure within the immortal light. It stood there as if it was ushering in a new age. It could sever the past and reach the future. No darkness in this world could hide from this figure. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Immortal Emperor Min Ren!” A knowledgeable paragon from the previous generation murmured and recognized the background of Li Qiye’s saber.

The smart experts gasped after seeing the true treasure seemingly coming back to life. Anyone could wield a true treasure, but unleashing its imperial power was a different story. The weaker ones would be completely depleted after attacking with the weapon once or twice.

Only experts who were sufficiently strong could wield these true treasures. However, this saber in Li Qiye’s hand was full of life as its imperial aura engulfed the world in just a moment. Without a doubt, this saber under his control could easily unleash an invincible imperial attack!

Keep in mind that even Godkings might not be able to wake these weapons because their awakening also meant gaining their recognition to a certain extent.

This awakened state meant that the weapon was at its strongest level. A peak-condition true treasure unleashing an imperial attack was much different from an attack of a dormant true treasure.

“Rumble!” The white general’s blood energy soared to the sky without holding anything back. It surged like a flood that spread across the world. His spear became even stronger and emitted a torrential light. With his support, the spear tried to suppress Li Qiye with an unstoppable force.

There was no doubt that the white general deserved his fame. As an Apex Godking, he could use his own power to stop a true treasure.

“Boom!” The saber erupted during the first exchange. Boundless immortal light shot to the sky. The imperial power within frantically exploded as if an emperor had awakened and arrived at the scene.

“Boom!” The erupting saber didn’t only blow the general and his spear away, it also destroyed all the ice chains on Li Qiye’s body.

At the same time, the ice entrapping Yonghuang shattered, allowing her to escape.

“Die!” The general rose up again after being blown away. His spear unleashed a torrential barrage with loud blasts.

It looked as if comets were falling down from the sky. Each thrust could wreck a mountain.

“Clank!” The hymn of a saber echoed across the realms. The Benevolent Saber in the sky made everything else seem dark in comparison. With one slash, the only thing that remained was its white-as-snow brilliance.

There was nowhere in the world to hide from this attack. All darkness instantly vanished into smoke.

This was the first slash of three, Pacifistic Brilliance. This blade alone illuminated the nine heavens and ten earths. The world needed nothing more than just this slash.

The saber itself had peerless strength, not to mention it was in its peak form. This attack seemed as if the emperor himself was performing the slash and could definitely decapitate a Godking.

“Boom!” The white general was blown away.

“Eat another one!” Li Qiye soared to the sky and gave chase while unleashing another blade straight at the general.

This particular slash had no variations and profundities, it only had the will of Immortal Emperor Min Ren. Under his will, no existence in this world could resist.

Merciful Wisdom — the second slash from the Benevolent Saber. This slash contained the emperor’s will. Everything became extraordinary and supreme.

This one slash had turned into a peerless grand dao. At this moment, everything disappeared in this saber dao, leaving only the emperor’s will behind.

His will was unquestionable and could order the world. Because of this, many cultivators outside the valley couldn’t stand straight and kneeled on the ground.

The white general didn’t back down. He crazily roared and revealed his Godking’s rings. They came out and formed their own world. Each halo carried an Apex Dao. At this moment, he was standing at the pinnacle of the dao and even broke through its limits.

Dragon roars continuously resounded. In this split second, his spear looked just like a true dragon coiling in the sky. Its draconic aura surged with the formation of a domain. Draconic runes as large as mountains floated within this domain.

At this moment, his spear had opened its draconic domain for protection against the emperor’s will.

This was one of his strongest attacks. He wouldn’t resort to it unless there was no other choice.

“A bit interesting, have another.” Li Qiye laughed.

“Boom!” His vitality erupted. The saber let out a long hymn and seemed to be transforming. It was no longer a simple weapon as it has gained its own life force!

“Clank!” The world became clear after this slash came out. Everything became brilliant yet ethereal.

Benevolent Lucidity — the final slash.

Under its power, all questions in the nine worlds ceased to exist. No profundity in myriad realms was worth discussing. The mysteries and secrets of the grand dao were done for. Even ancient rumors were easily understood. All became obvious before the might of this slash.

This was not just a slash but an answer to the grand dao of the world. Even the white general’s defensive technique turned vulnerable.

At this moment, it seemed as if the Benevolent Saber was grasped by the emperor’s left hand instead of Li Qiye’s.

Just imagine the power of this strike from an emperor himself. An Apex Godking was nothing before its might!

“Retreat!” Even Zhentian was shocked by this saber’s power. He instantly entered the valley with incomparable speed. He grasped the universe and took control of the grand dao.

With a loud bang, an extremely long path appeared between Li Qiye and the white general. It seemed to be crossing through the realms and time.

The world was frozen. More ice chains came down to suppress Li Qiye again.

“Bang!” Despite Zhentian’s effort, the emperor’s saber still cut through this long path and continued towards the general.

He was blown away by the slash. His spear was cut in half and his body was merely skirted by the blade, yet it still left an extremely deep wound. His blood dyed his robe red.

If Zhentian was a split second late, the general would have been split in half just like his spear.
