Chapter 5223: Sacrifice To The Dao Source

“How did he get there?” Experts exchanged glances. This wasn’t crossing through the images; he merely slumbered in that dao ocean.

“He most likely reduced himself down into little specks before infusing with the dao ocean, wanting to use the dao source to gestate his sacred fruits.” Ye Fantian observed carefully and saw the clues.

“That’s insane.” Xiao Qingtian took a deep breath after hearing the bold act.

However, Sanctified Bones benefited from this and eventually gained the twelfth sacred fruit.

“One can craft the immortal shell with the help of the path, right?” Dragon lords exchanged glances.

“Who are you?” The colossal skeleton looked down at Li Qiye and spoke with a thunderous tone. The eyes exuded golden flames.

He had two reasons for being here. First, improving his cultivation and second, guarding the dao source for Hundred Dao. If he could somehow fuse completely with the dao source, then Imperial Gate would only exist in name.

“Your killer.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Junior! We’ll see about that!” Sanctified Bones walked forward and started a tsunami, nearly flipping the eighteen images over. If it wasn’t for them stabilizing the independent domain, the land of Imperial Gate would have been decimated.

“Seems like he has fused with the dao ocean and can borrow a bit of the eighteen images’ power.” Ye Fantian said with a serious expression. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Xiao Qingtian was startled. Sanctified Bones was far from being the strongest dragon lord but if he could actually fuse with the images or control the dao source, he might actually be able to defeat Supreme.

“Boom!” He released a torrent of golden flames toward Li Qiye, wanting to engulf and incinerate him.

Space and the dao were reduced to ashes; the terrifying temperature made others tremble.

“Be careful!” Saintess Shao Yao shouted.

This attack was imbued with the power of the eighteen images - enough to kill another eleven-fruit dragon lord.

“Boom!” Li Qiye waved his hand just a second before he was surrounded by the flame.

The eighteen images suddenly shook violently with the momentum of shooting stars.

“Bam!” Sanctified Bones had no time to react before they pressed against him. The massive bones crumbled and fell back down to the ocean.

Remember, the eighteen images’ true power was beyond the control of any dragon lord. However, Li Qiye forced them to move just by waving his hand.

“Did, did you see that?” The crowd became slack-jawed.

It was amazing enough for Sanctified Bones to borrow a portion of this power. In this case, Li Qiye was forcefully pushing the images despite the existing barriers and seals.

“What the hell?” Xiao Qingtian lost his calm and cursed. Even with all of his might, he wouldn’t still have been able to push any of the images.

“He has either derived the dragon lord’s path to the limit or is in control of the dao source.” Ye Fantian said with uncertainty, unable to comprehend the act.

“Rumble!” The bones came together again to form the massive skeleton. There was no visible damage.

“You can control the eighteen images?!” He said with astonishment. After being buried here for tens of thousands of years, he had only seen the door to this dao.

Now, this guy was capable of using the images - something that should only be available to the founders.

“Your sacred fruits shall be my offerings to the dao source today.” Li Qiye smirked.

Sanctified Bones was horrified after hearing this after realizing the gravity of the situation. He immediately leaped into the air, wanting to break apart space and flee to a different dimension.

Li Qiye simply waved his hand again and the eighteen images rushed to the sky as well, slamming the skeleton once more.

“Activate!” Sanctified Bones activated all of his dao laws but this was useless against the eighteen images.

“Crack!” They crushed his golden bones and made spectators feel as if they were being crushed as well.

It didn’t take long before the gigantic skeleton was reduced to dust.
