Chapter 2291: Measuring This World

Entering the portal wasn’t a suffocating ordeal, only met with a dark expanse that could cloud even heavenly gazes.

The timid and weak would certainly be afraid, but fortunately for them, this process didn’t last long.

A light eventually came about with a pop. The black boats successfully traveled through the portal to reach Moneyfall.

“Poof!” The paper boats ignited and turned to ashes.

There were people as far as the eye can see. They have left their boats and stay in this place called the crossing.

This area had around ten thousand cultivators now from systems all over Myriad Lineage.

Even the famous sect leaders or the lords of systems were here too. Some have never met each other before until now. After all, Myriad Lineage was too vast, true to its name of having “ten thousand lineages”.

But many of these masters were here today just for Waterfall.

“Brother Madsky, it has been five thousand years since our last meeting at War Shore. I didn’t think I could see you again.” One ancestor was excited to see a friend.

“Yes, I thought I would only see you at my funeral, Brother Treasurevoid.” His friend, an ancestor as well, heartily laughed.

Though many came for the treasures, seeing friends after several thousand years was also a great occasion.

“Schoolmaster Soaring Crane, your reputation precedes you, I heard that your Crane Dance is supreme.” People tried to make friends as well.

“Your reputation also precedes you, Sectmaster Roaming Dragon. Your sword has slain numerous villains, I’m a big fan.”

These social exchanges and reminiscence went on for quite a bit. As long as there was no conflict in interest, the atmosphere remained friendly.

“Alright, let’s go find a true ground.” There were those who couldn’t wait any longer.

This was a vast land with majestic mountains and rivers. Even a pinnacle of a single mountain was as massive as a regular plain at any other place. The geography here wasn’t much different from Myriad Lineage.

“Let’s go!” People started trying to find their own places.

“We don’t need to travel on foot.” Someone reminded and pointed over yonder: “Can we use the Ascension Platform to take us there? Maybe the first stop will be a treasure ground.”

Everyone followed this direction and saw a place resembling an altar with many engraved runes.

“Where can it take you?” Someone had to ask. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“Luck-based, but the more money you give it, the farther it will take you. Some ancestors believe the quality of the location is proportional to the offering amount too. I don’t know if this is true or not.” An older cultivator said.

“I’m off then!” Someone got up there and threw true coins up there. They disappeared once they touched the ground.

“Boom!” This person was shot out like a cannon and disappeared into the horizon.

“Kids, get on there so we don’t have to walk.” A senior and his juniors offered the coins and were blown flying as well.

In a short time, everyone wanted to save time and climbed up the platform to reach the other locations. Rumor has it that the farthest place in this land had the best treasure grounds.

“Well, we’ll walk.” The cultivators from the smaller sects didn’t have as much money to use the altar and needed to spend them wisely. Thus, their seniors started leading the way.

“Come, I know a place.” One ancestor had records from his ancestors and didn’t need to use the platform.

Li Qiye was also too lazy to walk and got on the platform. He casually threw one coin down and was shot up like the rest, no different from a shooting star.

“Boom!” Li Qiye finally fell down on a towering peak. He looked around and it certainly didn’t look like a treasure ground.

His luck was rotten so he was taken to a bad location. Of course, he didn’t mind at all since he just wanted a quiet place.

He looked around and noticed that he was the first here. He smiled and took out Heaven Reckon. It dazzled like the gathering of a million stars.

This brightness only intensified with time as if more stars were gathering. The flowing runes became richer and more diverse as if they were relaying some information.

Heaven Reckon could measure everything in existence, including the future or the will of the heavens. This land was its target at this moment. This ability was the reason why the ruler was so magical and precious.

Li Qiye seemed to be one with the ruler, accepting the ocean of information transmitted to him.

“Extraordinary, this place can’t be measured in entirety. Those things...” Li Qiye became slightly emotional.

Keep in mind that the ruler was a heaven-defying item, one of the greatest treasures in the Buddhist epoch. One epoch was so long and prosperous so it produced plenty of treasures.

A treasure from a Grand Emperor wasn’t that exceptional in the grand scheme of things, no match for Heaven Reckon. Even if it wasn’t on the same level as a Paragon Artifact, its abilities were actually on the same level.

But now, there were things here that the ruler can’t gauge completely. This was quite frightening.

“Now it’s interesting.” Li Qiye chuckled: “The burial grounds seemed less colorful in comparison.”

“Buzz.” The ruler became even brighter. It was just a concentration of light, no longer possessing a physical form. This ray looked like an edge sharp enough to cut through everything.

“Time to see what thing is stopping my will.” Li Qiye pinned the ray into the ground.

The thick ground seemed as thin as paper and was instantly penetrated. The ray penetrated the underground mantle completely.

Li Qiye sat down in the meditative pose and turned into a supreme grand dao. It quietly flowed like time and became one with everything else. This allowed for Li Qiye to become one with Moneyfall.

The world lost all sounds. The purposely-obscured locations in this area became brighter. Somethings were moving a bit too.

Though no other cultivators could detect this minuscule change, a monster seemed to be coming back to life in the depths of Moneyfall.
