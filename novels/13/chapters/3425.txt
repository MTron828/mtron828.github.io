Colorful Balloons Take Flight

The air became a bit awkward after Li Qiye’s self-critique. For millions of years, people had a different perspective on Li Qiye.

Some considered him the savior, others thought that he was the dark hand behind the curtain, some also thought that he was a butcher...

The old man didn’t expect to be lucky enough to witness this mythical character. Only two outcomes would be the result of such a meeting - either extreme fortune or untold misfortune.

It seemed that he wasn’t part of the latter today.

“It is an honor to have you visiting our humble abode, a blessing accumulated from three lifetimes.” The old man bowed towards Li Qiye to show respect.

“I’m only here to drink duck soup. It’s a shame that I couldn’t get the real old one.” Li Qiye smiled.

The old man chuckled, naturally aware of Li Qiye’s joke. If he actually wanted it, he wouldn’t be sitting here right now.

“I’ve never expected you to show up again, Customer.” The old man said with reverence.

The words came from the heart because Li Qiye has been gone for too long. He disappeared during the previous epoch. Some said that he came to a different world, one that was far stronger. Others believed that he had ascended and became a true immortal. A few said that he died to the heavenly execution...

Only those who knew him thought that he was definitely alive, just not in this world.

The most shocking thing was his ability to return to the nine worlds. Now, the old man was lucky enough to see him. His life wasn’t wasted after witnessing this miracle.

In history, many characters have left without returning. For example, the emperors and dao lords. None could travel freely like this existence, leaving and returning, then repeating this unbelievable process.

“It’s an unlucky life. Struggling to reach the top only to fall back down, half-death. There’s no choice but to try again.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You’re the only one who can even climb it.” The old man praised.

Li Qiye’s comment sounded as if he lived a tough and unsuccessful life. Alas, the old man knew that the mountain here was accessible only to the Dark Crow. The other top supremes might not be eligible to embark on this path.

“Such praises make me feel as if I’m walking on air.” Li Qiye joked.

“This little one has a few questions. May I ask you about them?” The old man didn’t want to waste this opportunity. He didn’t want treasures and miracles either, only some answers.

Li Qiye glanced at him and waved his hand.

Qing Shi didn’t know what they wanted to talk about but Li Qiye’s intention was clear - for him to leave. Though he really wanted to stay despite being confused, he didn’t dare to go against Li Qiye and left the restaurant.

“Your golem race has a few talents.” Li Qiye said.

The old man glanced towards the door and said: “To earn your good graces is her fortune, a lifetime of benefits.”

“It’s nothing like that, just a coincidence.” Li Qiye smiled.

Of course, the old man didn’t think so. Those able to stay near Li Qiye all enjoyed a great fortune. He has heard plenty of legends like this. For example, the ancestor of the Shi. That’s why he thought that Qing Shi was very lucky to follow Li Qiye.

“Ask your questions. I might not be able to answer though.” Li Qiye said.

The old man took a deep breath and carefully took his time. Getting an answer from Li Qiye would be extremely beneficial. They could seek this for a lifetime and get nothing out of it.

“Are the great disasters real? When is the next one coming?” He asked.

“A bit crafty, that’s multiple questions in one.” Li Qiye smiled and turned towards the statue behind the counter: “Why are you living in this manner? For the golems or yourself?”

The old man sighed and said: “I’m doing my best so that I don’t let myself down and have peace of mind.”

“A noble goal. The world needs sages like you.” Li Qiye tapped his thigh and laughed.

“Thank you, Sir.” The old man bowed without feeling conceited.

Li Qiye stared outside and didn’t answer. The old man stood with both hands straight down, waiting patiently.

“They’re real, one hundred percent.” Li Qiye answered after a while.

The old man became startled despite mentally preparing himself long ago. This answer confirmed it.

Previously, whenever he got the same answer, he would still question it because they were speculations or just hearsay. Now, he got one from the most credible source.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that Li Qiye’s answer was equal to a mantra from the high heaven, as accurate as could be.

He took a deep breath and needed a little bit to calm down.

“From a certain angle, your race chose the right choice. This is not a bad idea for avoidance, worthy of further research.” Li Qiye added.

“So there is still hope in the future?” The old man became happy.

“None.” Li Qiye replied with absolute certainty.

“None...?” The old man was shaken. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Well, as I said, this is a decent idea when dealing with a lower level of disaster. When the real thing comes, nothing will be effective. A toppled nest will not have any whole egg.” Li Qiye smiled.

“In older epochs were majestic and brilliant beings. Some races could be considered heaven’s favorites and divine at birth, but none of them were lucky enough to escape. One person might be able to fend for themselves but there’s no chance for an entire race.” Li Qiye added.

There was no questioning Li Qiye’s authority on this topic since he had gone further than anyone. Other emperors and dao lords were just taking the first step.

“There’s no chance for you either.” Li Qiye finished with this in a nonchalant tone.

The old man smiled wryly and nodded: “I know, I’ve lived long enough anyway. Any extra day is good enough, no point in regretting.”

“Satisfaction is happiness, at least you’ll be able to face death with peace. Death itself isn’t that scary. One could consider it a beautiful ending where people can close their eyes and rest.” Li Qiye replied.

“Your experiences are out of reach for us, as unimaginable as can be.” The old man could sympathize: “When will it come?”

“You’re asking the wrong person.” Li Qiye shook his head: “I can’t give you an answer. You need to be asking him.” He pointed towards the sky.

The old man looked up and chuckled.

“But, maybe you’ll live long enough to see that day.” Li Qiye joked: “But you should hope for the opposite and die in a peaceful manner. Everyone eventually dies anyway.”
