Chapter 4964: The Eye Of Oblivion

The dragon lords have tried and realized that they alone could not touch the dao controller. The only option left to team up, hoping that Li Qiye’s weak personal cultivation would allow them to win.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Alas, they were prestigious ancient ancestors who have dominated for generations. They had never worked together before, let alone doing so against a junior. This wasn’t a flattering story in the slightest.

“Is it still time to care about reputation?” Maddened God didn’t care for this issue: “If we don’t team up now, there is no chance of seizing the dao controller. We have to kill the brat right away before his wings are grown.”

“There is no need to wait that long, I assure you.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Brat, don’t be so sure.” Reincarnation City Lord snorted: “You’re not doing a damn thing to five dragon lords.”

“No need to come up with an excuse, just come together so I can save time not chasing each worm.” Li Qiye said.

The taunt infuriated the dragon gods. Teaming up against a junior was shameful indeed. Nonetheless, he was giving them the perfect opportunity.

“Don’t blame us for this since you’re feeling suicidal.” Oblivion Monarch stepped forward and blocked Li Qiye’s escape route.

“You will pay for your audacity.” Stone Lion God said.

“My arrow shall send you to hell.” Arrow Saint was ready to fire another shot.

“Hahaha, I can’t believe how shameless all of you are, so eager to pull this off.” Maddened God laughed and then said: “Don’t be angry now, I don’t mind at all. We villains need to learn from you in this aspect.”

He turned toward Li Qiye and said: “Brat, you have given up a great opportunity, I’m afraid today will be your last day alive.”

“Make your move first so that it won’t be an utter loss to my dao controller.” Li Qiye shook his head.

His opponents were livid but still managed to keep their composure.

“How can we face the world if we don’t kill you today?” Oblivion Monarch said.

“Come, come.” Li Qiye waved his hand, not taking this seriously at all.

Students were at a loss for words since no other youth in the lower continents would dare to do something like this. Thus, it didn’t matter whether he had the power to back it up; they respected his domineering attitude.

After all, they would be cowering in fear while facing five dragon lords, let alone being able to act haughtily.

The group of four didn’t take long before reaching an understanding without needing to talk.

“I’ll go first, watch my back.” Stone Lion God roared.

“Raa!” The world trembled before him as he gathered the stars. His dao of his four fruits intertwined together to create a radiant cosmic seal. Countless starlights poured down on the battlefield.

“Boom!” A lion eventually manifested into reality and embraced the cosmic seal.

“Cosmic Lion Seal!” A student from Deity had heard of this technique before: “That’s the technique he used to prove his dao!”

“Activate!” Maddened God utilized his heavenly eye and forced a crack to appear in space. Out came a gigantic mouth with four fiery sacred fruits inside.

“Maddened Flames of Calamity!” He roared and sent it down. A single ember could turn a region. If the entire thing came down, ten million miles of land would be reduced to an ocean of lava.

“Buzz.” Arrow Saint activated his three dao fruits and imbued them with a blood affinity.

He whispered an unknown curse and frightened the students. They felt as if there were maggots squirming inside their bones.

The curse combined with the power of the fruits culminated into an ominous arrow.

“Bloodcurse Shot!” Students cried out the name of the technique.

Before he even shot out, everything in its future trajectory began to be devoured by its cursed nature. According to the rumor, it had a massive range capability and would follow the target until death.

“Reincarnation Dao!” Though his allies have shown their cards, the first to attack was actually Reincarnation City lord.

His heavenly disk appeared above Li Qiye and served as an immobilizer. Time started reversing around Li Qiye.

The goal was to prevent Li Qiye from using the dao controller, hoping to wrest it out of his hand.

“Buzz.” The second in line was Oblivion Monarch who revealed a third eye. This was akin to an abyss capable of pulling everyone within.

“The Eye of Oblivion!” He bellowed and tried to suck Li Qiye into the abyss.

“Ahhh!” Some students stared at the eye for too long and were incinerated by its power.

“Protect your mind.” The old schoolmaster appeared in order to protect the students.

Two different affinities were at work - reincarnation and oblivion. Geniuses or even dragon lords would find it impossible to escape once trapped inside.
