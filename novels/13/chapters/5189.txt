Chapter 5190: Seeing The Nine Worlds Again

“So be it, no harm can come from this.” Resplendent took a deep breath and nodded.

With that, he took out a tree still with fertile soil stuck to the roots.

“Do you know this divine tree, Young Noble?” Resplendent asked.

What it lacked in size, it made up in grace. The trunk and the thick barks resembled a scaled dragon. The leaves were green and brimmed with life. As they swayed, they seemed to be bringing spring back.

Some of the leaves were longer than the body and actually touched the ground. It gave the illusion that they were drilling into the ground and could continue to grow, capable of reaching the core of the ground.

“The Tree of Tranquility.” Li Qiye said: “Calling it a sacred tree is fine but using the word divine is far-fetched. Divine trees are beyond your capability to transplant.”

This was an offensive statement, especially when he was speaking to a dragon lord with ten sacred fruits.

“So which ones are divine trees in your opinion?” Resplendent didn’t take it in stride.

This tree was the best from their Qilin Manor, planted by their progenitor - Peerless Monarch. Sure, it wasn’t as precious as Alchemy Dao’s exalted lotus plant but didn’t deserve the disdainful comment.

“A so-called divine tree should rule over heaven and earth, grasp the sun and moon, rotate the celestials, and encompass three thousand worlds.” Li Qiye said: “Your tree might be able to conceal a region and safeguard it from a disaster on top of providing solutions to dao mysteries, but this is not comparable to a true divine tree.”

The group exchanged glances.

“I don’t think such a tree exists in the six continents.” Gourdkeeper took a deep breath.

“That makes it worthy of being a divine tree but nowadays, people use this adjective all the time.” Li Qiye responded.

The two old men chuckled awkwardly but Li Qiye didn’t actually have any intention of calling them out specifically.

After reaching this level, they knew that they were far from being unbeatable.

“Young Noble, allow me to show you something.” Resplendent finally made up his mind because there was no other option.

He took out something resembling a go board. Upon closer inspection, there were mountains and rivers within along with grand veins - looking just like an entire world sealed within.

Anyone could tell at first glance at this was an ultimate treasure.

“Behold, Resplendent Array of Qi…” Resplendent Monarch introduced.

Alas, he was interrupted by Li Qiye who grabbed the board from him. He took a look and said: “The nine worlds, should change its name to Nine Worlds Array instead.”

He only took a split second to understand the entire board and all of its minute transformations. The basis of this treasure was none other than the nine worlds, utilizing its terrains to duplicate the momentum and flows.

“You know about the nine worlds?!” Both Gourdkeeper and Resplendent became startled.

This went double for Resplendent because the array was their secret. Only ancient ancestors had access to the board. Ordinary disciples never got the chance to take a look or didn’t even know what it was.

“This is not Immortal Emperor Qilin’s technique.” Li Qiye commented: “He follows the path of the ancient beasts.”

“Yes.” Resplendent became excited: “Our other progenitor created it.”

“Peerless Monarch.” Gourdkeeper said.Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“Yes, this array managed to stop conquerors and monarchs from entering our city.” Resplendent smiled wryly: “It is still here but unfortunately, I cannot activate its true power. The flaws and openings were taken advantage of, hence my defeat to Suppression.”

He saw hope in Li Qiye so he revealed everything.

“Activate!” Li Qiye formed a mudra and chanted.

“Buzz.” The array released an ocean of light, completely engulfing the manor.

The group was taken inside the array afterward. They looked around and saw an unfamiliar world.

Only Li Qiye found this place familiar, whether it be the majestic mountain range and draconic earth veins. Even the boundless galaxy above took him back to the past.

“The nine worlds.” He sighed and still remembered. These memories were buried deep in his mind.

This place had changed completely and turned into the current Eight Desolaces. Nonetheless, someone else in the six continents was still in love with this world, deciding to take advantage of their peerless wisdom to imprint these memories into an array.

Li Qiye became sentimental since he didn’t expect to see the nine worlds again.
