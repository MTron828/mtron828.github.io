Chapter 4625: Worldraiser Scripture

“Be ready!” True Immortal Spirit’s chilling aura became unbearable as if he was a continental glacier.

He came from a great sect so despite his rage, he still acted in an acceptable manner. Killing Li Qiye still required a process - a fair duel.

He raised his right hand and made a half-fist. “Buzz.” He became radiant with ancient rays from an older period.

They gave the impression that he was a god from the primordial times, capable of constructing worlds out of nothingness. The power of creation was also destructive, enough to murder anyone here. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“What an aura.” A last-gen cultivator shuddered, thinking that she wouldn’t be able to beat the genius.

“Clank!” Suddenly, everyone felt as if his hand has turned into a hatchet capable of killing gods and devils.

“Worldraiser Hack.” An ancestor recognized the move after seeing the initial variation.

“Die!” The genius roared and swung his hand downward.

Though there was no actual weapon, the crowd was still horrified by the impressive attack. It left behind a deep scar on its path and even affected others outside of Li Qiye. They felt their grand dao being split into two halves. Some fell to the ground and twitched with pain despite suffering zero external injuries.

“Be careful!” Ye Tingrong herself shouted, not knowing whether Li Qiye would be able to stop it.

Once it struck the ground, dust flew everywhere and a chasm was left behind. It nearly severed the entrance area into two pieces.

This was just a casual swing from the genius. He certainly didn’t go all out.

Once the debris settled, they couldn’t find Li Qiye anywhere.

“Where is Li Qiye?!” Someone shouted.

“Did he die?” One youth murmured, thinking that not even a bone was left.

“I didn’t see it clearly but that shouldn’t be the case.” An ancestor shook his head.

“If he’s actually dead after one move, that would be rather amusing, the proper end for his arrogance.” A younger cultivator sneered.

True Immortal Spirit scanned the chasm after the first move. However, unlike the rest of the crowd, he had a bad feeling about this.

“Too slow.” He heard a voice right behind him.

The mightier ancestors also noted this right away. They saw Li Qiye standing behind True Immortal Spirit in the same pose. It was as if he was there in the beginning and didn’t move an inch.

This wasn’t an issue of speed. The top masters got a strange sense that space and everything else shifted around Li Qiye. This would be a frightening thought because it showed immaculate spatial manipulation.

The alarmed genius reacted quickly by shifting away from his original position. His speed was commendable indeed for someone his age.

However, it didn’t matter how fast he was. Li Qiye always kept up as if he was his shadow.

Li Qiye then raised his hand for a gentle tap. It didn’t release any light or divinity, more like a tap on a good friend’s shoulder.

Nonetheless, the genius became aghast since he felt a tsunami of power coming for him.

“Worldraiser Sphere!” He intertwined his fingers with incredible speed and created a dao barrier.

Alas, this wasn’t enough to stop Li Qiye’s hand. The barrier collapsed and he fell down like a meteor.

“Boom!” He smashed into the ground and started a dust storm.

As for the spectators, they had no idea what was going on. They only saw Li Qiye pressing his hand forward without using any merit law. How did this break the genius’ dao defense?

“Impossible!” Some wiped their eyes in disbelief due to how illogical it was.

True Immortal Spirit was strong enough to beat some ancestors now yet he lost to a single move, looking as feeble as a speck of dust. The outcome was the opposite of their expectation.
