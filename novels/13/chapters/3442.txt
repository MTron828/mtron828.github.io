Feathersword was still alive but couldn’t move.

The attacker turned out to be Ye Lingyao. Her actions had a perfect flow, from the breaking of his sword to the throw.

The crowd took a deep breath after seeing this. She seemed determined enough to antagonize Yin Yang Gate all for Li Qiye’s sake. This could even lead to war between the valley and Yin Yang.

The young ones still cared enough about romance to become jealous instead of thinking about the big picture. They felt a bone-deep hatred towards Li Qiye.

“Maiden! You, you want to declare war?!” Feathersword cried out in pain before shouting.

All eyes were on her right now. A war between two sects was a serious matter even for the sect master or ancestor, not to mention a future successor like her.

After all, Yin Yang’s power was as real as can be, more than enough to deter the others in the north. Even if a sect could win, they would need to pay an unimaginable price.

“Miss Ye, please reconsider. Think of the big picture.” The first prince of Skylight persuaded.

Everyone here thought that going to war against Yin Yang was not worth it over Li Qiye.

However, she ignored them and stared at Feathersword to say: “If your sect wishes to fight, bring it.”

She spoke without any hesitation and left no room for negotiation, clearly undeterred.

This froze the spectators. After a while, one of them said: “Is he worth it? It’s insane.”

They found this decision to be careless second to none.

The first prince would never go to war against Yin Yang over a woman. He would be throwing his kingship away then the entire country.

Qing Shi was surprised as well, not expecting Lingyao to be so determined.

Only Li Qiye remained calm as if this was a trivial matter. He slowly sauntered towards Feathersword.

“How are you going to kill me now? Got anything else up your sleeve?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Do as you please, I will never beg for mercy.” He shouted, far tougher than the prince from Wu.

“How do you want to die then?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Whatever, I’ll never beg! Yin Yang will avenge me one day, your head will be offered to me.” The guy continued.

“You’re this confident?” Li Qiye was amused at the youth’s courage.

“There will be no place for you in the northern West King! My sect will hunt you to the end of the world, no one will be able to protect you since we’ll kill them...”

“Crack!” He couldn’t finish because Li Qiye stomped down on his head and made brains go everywhere.

“Your courage is rewarded with a swift death.” Li Qiye pulled his foot back up and said.

People stared at the corpse in silence. Just a while ago, Feathersword was in high spirit with an army behind him. A bright future awaited this youth. Now, nothing was left of him and his crew.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye turned and left.

Ye Lingyao followed him without thinking. Qing Shi and Shi Wawa weren’t as quick.

The former didn’t need to ask because this was on point with the stories she had heard about this legendary figure. Those who messed with his followers all suffered a terrible fate. That’s why she knew that this group was dead the moment they injured Shi Wawa. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

The crowd still stood there in a daze after the group was gone. They needed some time to digest this event.

Li Qiye wasn’t in a hurry because Wawa still needed time to heal. They eventually found an inn.

“Young Master.” Ye Lingyao came to speak with him.

“What is it?” Li Qiye had a carving knife. He used it to carve runes into the stone egg. Each cut was meticulous.

“Our forefather will come out soon.” She quietly said.

“I know.” Li Qiye said: “Go, tell him to come to find me after he’s out."

“Yes.” She immediately bowed and carried out his order.

Meanwhile, Qing Shi had free time and snuck out of the inn after organizing rooms for the others. He wanted some answers so he returned to the alley to find the chicken soup restaurant.

Li Qiye was an unfathomable mystery so he needed more information. In fact, he knew that Ye Lingyao was privy to a few things but she wouldn’t tell him. That’s why he had no choice but to find the old man.

The route contained numerous alleys and complicated turns. However, he had memorized it as he was leaving.

He returned to the right spot and only saw an old house, no restaurant. He didn’t give up and tried to leave and come back again - still no restaurant.

“No, this is definitely right.” He was sure of it while looking around. The restaurant should indeed be here.

“A dream? Or an illusion?” His confidence wavered.

“Come in.” An old voice suddenly sounded behind him.

He became startled and turned around only to see the restaurant again along with its salivating aroma. The door was open.

He realized that if the owner of the restaurant didn’t want to be found, no one would be able to see it. The old man was a true hidden master.

He took a deep breath and tied his outfit then maintained a respectful expression before entering.

The restaurant was still the same, not a single guest. The only difference was that the old man was sitting behind the counter, fully covering his hands with his sleeves as if afraid of the cold.

His eyes were close, seemingly asleep.

“You’re abandoning what’s close to search for the distant.” The old man said: “You shouldn’t have come here.”

Qing Shi respectfully bowed towards the old man and said: “Some questions have been haunting my mind so I couldn’t help coming here seeking answers.”
