Chapter 4619: Dragon Diagram of Destruction

The whip combined with the Fire Dragon Mantra impressed the crowd with its power.

Voidburn couldn’t compare to the five conquerors but the attack just now nearly justified his arrogance and pride.

“Geniuses from the great powers are always capable.” Someone who disliked him commented and recognized his ability.

“Hmm, can the brat do anything about it?” Another thought that Jian Ming was going to die for sure.

“Voidburn didn’t go all out from the start. The battle seems over now.” One clan member added.

The sentiment shifted from an even fight to Jian Ming being dead for sure after just one technique.

Voidburn became complacent and opened his ears wide to listen to the praises. He thought that he was finally able to show Ye Tingrong his power. It was time for him to finish Jian Ming.

“Brat, I shall desecrate your corpse, this is what you get for running your mouth!” He loudly threatened.

“Godchild, make him unable to ever speak again!” One clan member who hated Jian Ming shouted.

“Right, off with his tongue!” Another had a cruel smile.

By this point, Jian Ming has stabilized his inner energy and glared at Voidburn Godchild, looking like a true descendant of a prestigious clan.

“You think too highly of yourself, I will show you my true ability now.” Jian Ming declared.

“Boom!” He released enough vitality and energy to create a floating expanse.

“This brat is this strong?” A big shot became startled.

“He was hiding his power.” A master from an old sect found this surprising.

“Raa!” A rather quiet draconic cry could be heard. Despite its humble volume, it made listeners go weak and want to submit.

Even the gigantic fire dragon trembled after hearing it.

“This is…” Not to mention the young cultivators, even veterans were caught unaware by this special cry.

At first, the empowered fire dragon felt so real and made them think that an actual dragon was here. Now, it paled in comparison to whatever made this recent sound.

If say, the fire dragon’s roar was authentic, then the sound just now was the roar of the king of dragons. All other draconic creatures would have to become subservient and afraid.

“Is this a true dragon bloodline…” Paramount Scion took a deep breath, shocked.

“It is exceedingly noble.” Ye Tingrong’s expression changed.

This was certainly not a draconic bloodline. Nonetheless, the dragon’s cry in his vitality implied the nobility in his bloodline.

“Clank!” The cry was still audible while a divine sword slowly floated up above his head. It had an ancient style with many scars, clearly from the olden days.

The atmosphere turned cold, no longer affected by the fire dragon. Murderous energy permeated from the sword’s deathly aura and made people shudder.

Jian Ming turned into a god of death, looking emotionless and prone to massacring. This tangible energy of death gathered into the form of a true dragon. The faint image of the dragon represented a cataclysm - the end of all things.

“What the hell is this?” Crowd members became confused.

This murderous aura didn’t seem to be made from energy or divinity. It felt natural as part of the cultivation process, meaning that the merit law was meant for murder.

“This brat hides stuff so well.” The daoist said: “It’s a good thing I didn’t drive him crazy recently…”

“Hmm, this resembles the sword art from an ancient sacred ground, murderous and emotionless.” Paramount Scion analyzed the aura.

Many were doing the same thing, hoping to realize the origin of the technique.

“Dragon Diagram of Destruction!” Each word he shouted stabbed the heart.

“Clank!” The true dragon roared again and the expanse of energy turned into an ocean of blood.

“Fire Dragon Bulwark!” Voidburn Godchild no longer held back after seeing this. His vitality turned into flames.

The gigantic dragon breathed in the affinities around it and created a boundless wall, seemingly impregnable. Everyone looked up and saw the wall splitting the region in half.

“This is the strongest defense of that mantra.” An ancestor said.

“Boom!” The first technique of the murderous move came slashing down and rendered the wall ineffective.

The front half instantly crumbled in a magnificent spectacle akin to the end of a heavenly kingdom. Voidburn gritted his teeth while blood gushed out of his mouth. His full focus on defense wasn’t enough to stop the slash. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“He’s going to die.” An ancestor understood that Voidburn had nothing left.

“Don’t be afraid, Godchild!” A shout came from Golden Peak during this crucial moment. An old man sent out true flames from his forehead despite being immensely far away. “Skyburn Divine Flame!” Its target was Voidburn, not the slash.
