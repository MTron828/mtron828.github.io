Chapter 5028: I Have Created A Dao

The four couldn’t do anything because they seemed helpless against Li Qiye. His strength exerted immense pressure and suffocated them. This was a new experience compared to their previous domination.

They were the ones intimidating others, not the other way around. Today, they couldn’t see his true power in the slightest and had no confidence in winning.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Not long ago, they believed in their talents even against stronger foes, that it was only a matter of time.

Now, they felt despair because their best techniques couldn’t even force him to use a single merit law. They had no estimation of the cultivation required to beat him.

They exchanged glances, unable to get down from the tiger. Should they surrender? Or just run away?

No, their pride prevented them from doing so. Plus, would he let them go either way?

Only Wild Dragon had no problem with running away. On the other hand, Jun Cuican and Radiant Monarch couldn’t do so. They would never be able to look anyone in the eyes again afterward.

“I have created a dao, just a prototype. Do you dare to block it?” Jun Cuican chose a different option. Due to his age, he preferred death over humiliation.

“You must be confident in it.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I named it, My Brilliance. It can rival any conqueror’s dao and will amaze the world. It is worthy of my effort.” He couldn’t hide his pride when talking about it.

“My Brilliance? Very well, I will give you a chance.” Li Qiye said.

“If you block my dao directly, you will surely die.” Cuican said.

“No need for this psychological tactic, I’ve agreed already.” Li Qiye chuckled and gestured provocatively: “Show me if your dao is as brilliant as you claim.”

Everyone became eager because Jun Cuican’s talent was well documented. Some believed that only Phenomena Conqueror in recent eras had a similar gift.

“My Briliance.” He formed a mudra with both hands while chanting.

His dao seemed to be born from primordial chaos and wielded the most ancient power. Thus, it could fuse into anything else.

“Try this!” He sent it at Li Qiye.

“I won’t be dodging.” Li Qiye smiled and let it hit him.

“Boom!” However, instead of attempting to injure him, it merely seeped into his body. It didn’t have the same flashiness as the more destructive attacks.

Spectators became surprised because it didn’t have the style of a peerless dao. Jun Cuican spoke with so much pride earlier but his dao didn’t harm a single hair of Li Qiye.

On the other hand, Li Qiye felt the dao flowing inside him.

“Rather clever and profound.” Li Qiye said: “Unfortunately, you have not perfected it so it lacks speed, unable to seal the opponent in the blink of an eye.”

“You are something else.” Cuican initially hated Li Qiye but now, he respected the guy for instantly recognizing the deficiencies in his dao.

As the greatest genius of the generation, he felt lonely while standing at the top. After all, even Radiant Monarch and Tendril King weren’t as talented as him.

This made him prideful and look down on others for their foolishness and inability to understand his greatness. Today, he finally met someone capable of recognizing his true worth.

“This dao seals the target’s power, true blood, and grand dao. If you try to activate your power, it will bind and increase consumption. The strongest you are, the more effective it is.” He willingly shared information.

“Let’s see how good it is then.” Li Qiye smiled and began channeling his power.

“Boom!” He became resplendent with dao flames and the life of life emerging.

Just the first second made him look like a supreme giant feared by all. However, Jun Cuican’s dao immediately exerted its grip.

“Clank!” Divine chains wrapped around him, both outside and inside. It caused his chaos true energy and dao power to become chaotic, no longer in harmony.

They started burning and injuring him. The more he channeled his power, the stronger the internal combustion. He turned into a fiery tornado as his own powers clashed with each other.
