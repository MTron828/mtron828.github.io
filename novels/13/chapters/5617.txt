Chapter 5618: The Strategist

“Where is she now? Where is she?!” She said aggressively.

He stared at her and felt melancholic while answering: “I cannot provide you an answer on this matter.”

“You are responsible for her death.” Her eyes flashed with a piercing light.

“I do not regret what I did. She was not a flower to be trapped and protected in your clan. She was happier being free in the outside world. Otherwise, she would have died from sadness.” He said.

“Mere sophistry.” She said: “Everything started with you.” 

“It’s not wrong because many things started with me in this world. I have many karmic ties but in the end, I am not always at fault. Your clan’s fortune would have fared better without me? And hers?” He smiled and said.

She didn’t respond this time.

After a while, she asked: “What about Lil’ Jian?”

Li Qiye’s expression didn’t change but his eyes narrowed. He smiled and shook his head: “How do I know? The human heart is so unpredictable.”Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

“Is that so?” She stared deep into his eyes, wanting to see his true thoughts.

However, this didn’t affect his demeanor at all.

“Is there more to this? Are you hiding something?” She asked.

“What do I have to hide? Don’t you remember how your old geezer chased and tried to kill me across three thousand worlds?” He responded.

“This is all you have to say after the torment that I’ve been through?” Her coldness made others shudder.

He sighed and came over to gently caress her face. The two sisters were too similar.

“Bam!” She slapped his hand away and said: “Either tell the truth or…”

“Or what?” He shook his head and said: “What else can we do but wait until the time is right? You will see it for yourself soon enough. You must understand that I alone cannot give you the answer. The disasters are nothing more than karma planted in the distant past, still hidden as of now. I’m sorry for the suffering you’ve endured, but it is not only limited to you. Many have lost their lives because of it and some endured worse, still carrying unimaginable burdens. Their bitterness and pain are more than you can imagine.”

“You dare underestimate what I’ve been through?” She coldly uttered.

“I’m well aware of the difficulties and pain during the rebuilding process. Your dao and body as a Grand Emperor were destroyed, starting anew consisting of blood and tears after having flesh torn from bones. I’ve been through it before as well, just know that this didn’t happen because of me and won’t disappear because of me. It was predetermined long ago.” He said.

“When have people like us ever believed in destiny?” She sneered.

“It depends on if you can break free. If you can’t, then it’s destiny.” He said: “If you disagree, then you must confront it. You did just that, look at where you stand right now after resisting. The experiences made you more powerful and extraordinary, far beyond what you were as a Grand Emperor.”

“And far more traumatized.” She said sarcastically.

“The path we walk signifies suffering, there’s nothing easy about it. It’s often unavoidable as well.” He shrugged.

“Where were you then?” She asked.

“When hardship is destined to arrive, it will come regardless. My presence could only delay the inevitable or change its intensity. For you to be in this transformed state required suffering.” He said.

“Tell me one thing then, was this all part of your plan?” She peered into his eyes.

“I am only an outsider whose decision matters little. You know who to look for if you want the answer.” He shook his head.

Her gaze remained intense.

“You already know the truth given your intelligence. You knew when I left back then.” He comforted her face again.

She didn’t respond, seemingly recalling old memories.

“Poor girl, you couldn’t face it back then despite already being a Grand Emperor.” He sighed and said.

“Because I’m not as cruel, you all knew the outcome.” She coldly uttered.

“That’s just how the world is.” He sighed: “I truly sympathize with your feelings.” 

“You treated lives as chess pieces, including me!” She said.

“At the very least, your clan had a chance of being placed on the board. Others didn’t realize what was going on before being reduced to ashes.” He shook his head.

“That happened to the majority of my clan.” She sneered.

“As I’ve said previously, you know who made the choice but I don’t mind being the target of your frustration and venting.” He shook his head.

“You were the strategist.” She sneered.

“That I do not deny.” He smiled and said: “You can think that your clan and loved ones were buried because of me, that my hands are stained with their blood. But, your clan was doomed from the start, this was a different method, choosing death to somehow survive. At least there was a chance.”

He paused and stared at her: “It was inevitable, no place to hide despite how vast the world is.”

She fell into silence.

“Unless you all became hounds willingly.” Li Qiye said: “You didn’t grasp Celestial Court’s true power back then but your old man did. The others might have agreed but not him, he was a great man who was ready to pay the ultimate price.”

Her oppressive aura gradually weakened. The coldness in her eyes dissipated.

She sat down on the bed and seemed to be lost in thoughts. He got up and sat next to her.

“The answer has always been buried in your heart, you only wanted proof but didn’t want to believe any of them. You needed to place the blame on someone and I was the perfect villain.” He said.
