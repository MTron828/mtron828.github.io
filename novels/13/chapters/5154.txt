Chapter 5155: Lost

“Heavenly Sword School came prepared.” The man became serious.

“Heaven Alliance came prepared. Will you fight on their territory and break the pact?” Jun Landu smiled.

“As long as the two conquerors say the word.” The man said.

“Who doesn’t know that asking for help is the same as joining Dao Alliance, meaning that the alliance must defend its members? This is no different than Heaven Alliance, albeit with a different form.” Landu said with a smile.

“Do you have a better idea, Lord Landu?” The man bowed.

“None, the troubles of the world have nothing to do with an idle man such as myself.” Landu shook his head.

The man had no response after hearing this.

“It’s inevitable as long as Celestial Court is around, the conflict between The Race and The People.” Li Qiye made another move and caused Landu to grimace.

“True, but the opportunity isn’t here. Dao Alliance can’t clap with just one hand.” The man smiled wryly. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“Drag the others in, Imperial Alliance, Pure land, Lesser Firmament, and Azure Peak.” Landu took a deep breath, having a terrible time with the match.

“I’ve worn out many pairs of shoes at this point, it’s no use.” The man complained.

“What can I say, the Pact of Blessed has pros and cons. The pros are obvious, everyone has more freedom and time. On the other hand, it prevents an alliance between certain powers.” Landu said.

“Right, Brother All-things can’t break the pact.” The man said helplessly.

In terms of relationship, All-things was Blessed’s descendants so he had more qualms about breaking his ancestor’s pact for it would be unfilial.

“Your Dao Alliance needs to be more serious about this.” Landu made a move and could relax for a second.

“It would be easy if supreme existences such as Lord Landu and Sir join the fray. Everything will be simple then.” The man shamelessly said.

Landu acted as if he was about to fall off his chair: “No thank you, I am useless but of course, if you can get Sir to help, then it will be simple indeed. Heaven Alliance will crumble.”

“You’ve lost.” Li Qiye made his move and finished the match with a smile.

Landu’s expression soured because this was the end for him.

“Sigh, I kept talking and got distracted.” Landu said: “But I suppose it didn’t really matter if you got serious.”

“Sir, would you like to visit Dao Alliance now?” The man asked again.

“No.” Li Qiye refused.

“He’ll go if you can beat him in a match.” Landu suggested.

The man had been watching and knew that he stood no chance. He smiled awkwardly and said: “Having self-awareness is a virtue, I know that my meager abilities can’t handle a go match with Sir.”

“I see, you’re implying that I have zero self-awareness.” Landu chuckled.

“Of course not.” The man said: “Lord Landu has escaped the mortal coil and fears nothing, not even a match of this level.”

“It does feel good to hear despite being mere flattery.” Landu said: “No wonder why everyone praises your eloquence, saying that you can reach the dao with it alone. Seems to be the truth.” [1]

“I’m just an errand boy.” The man shook his head.

Back in Windchaser Hall, the battle had reached its climax.

“Clank!” Heavenly Sword Godmonarch’s swing cut through the sky and could make the gods tremble.

It sliced Windchaser Conqueror’s chest but couldn’t kill him due to his impregnable dao fruits.

With that, Windchaser retaliated by punching and crushing the godmonarch’s sword barrier. The seven sacred fruits blossomed beautifully but couldn’t stop him either.

They crumbled into pieces and it was too late for the godmonarch’s true fate to escape.

“Ahh!” Windchaser managed to punch a hole through his opponent’s chest and delivered him from this world.

“Bam!” The corpse fell to the ground.

Windchaser also fell to the ground but he eventually stood up. He vomited blood but still stood there proudly after taking down a mighty rival.

“Raa!” Meanwhile, True Bear swallowed the ocean of swords and tried to bite Soaring Sword Monarch.

Windchaser Lord also unleashed a lightning thrust infused with golden energy against him.

The latter was fatigued from defending against two powerful foes. He thrust his sword and pierced True Bear’s mouth but unfortunately, Windchaser Lord penetrated his defense and his chest.

Because of this damage, he lost focus and True Bear drew closer, biting his head off. His six sacred fruits flew away with the true fate in the center.

Alas, True Bear and Windchaser Lord gave chase, eventually destroying all six fruits and the true fate.

True Bear’s injuries and instability were piling up. He let out a loud roar before disappearing into the horizon.

Losing two leaders left Heavenly Sword in disarray. Thunderspear took advantage of this for a counteroffensive. Their morale surged after seeing so many fellow sect members killed.

Their opponents started running for their lives. Unfortunately, no mercy was shown as Windchaser Hall pursued and killed as many as they could, adding more corpses to nourish their soil.

“Windchaser Hall won.” A spectator commented.

“Yes, but at what cost?” Others shuddered.

“Heavenly Sword School is way stronger than this. Sacred Sword Monarch and Heavenly Sword Conqueror didn’t show up or it would have been one-sided.”

Windchaser Conqueror nearly fell in battle and they only won because of True Bear Conqueror. Otherwise, Soaring Sword Monarch would have killed Windchaser Lord and that would be the end for Windchaser Conqueror as well. He wouldn’t have been able to fight against two top dragon lords alone.

1. Landu calls him Jian Cang, meaning Sword Azure, but I am unsure whether it is a title or a proper name so omitting it for now until the narrative makes it clearer ?
