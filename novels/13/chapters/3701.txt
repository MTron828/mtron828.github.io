Chapter 3702: Unstoppable

No one expected the elite soldiers to go down without putting up a fight.

“That thing is insane!” The crowd was horrified by the statue.

“I’ve never seen anything like it before.” An erudite ancestor shook his head.

“Monk, what is this thing?” A regular customer at Wish Ward was familiar with Untethered Monk and shouted at him.

“Buddha says to not divulge.” The monk placed his palms together with a wide smile.

“This is your store’s statue, right? I’ve never seen you use it before, since when is it such a capable weapon?” Another big shot asked.

“Amitabha, merciful Buddha, Amitabha.” The monk blabbered on without answering.

“Sure, Buddha might be merciful but not a meat-eating monk like you.” Those nearby gritted their teeth since the monk was acting so annoying. A dog couldn’t spit out ivory indeed. [1]

Despite the monk’s silence, everyone could tell that Wish Ward might not have been able to use it in the past. Otherwise, it wouldn’t have been treated as decoration in the courtyard.

Meanwhile, the general standing near the altar turned pale. His regiment has fought from south to north, never having tasted defeat.

Today, it seemed that his clan had messed with the wrong person. Li Qiye alone massacred his pride - the regiment.

As Li Qiye strolled through the street, the place turned dark. His shadow seemed to be engulfing the area and overwhelming everyone’s heart.

“Whoosh!” Bright lights flashed as numerous weapons soared towards him, forming an inescapable net.

These were the experts from the Grand Chancellor’s faction hiding in ambush - a total of eighteen. Their sword resembled the fangs of serpents aiming for his weak spots.

“The assassination group from the regiment!” One spectator shouted.

This group was quite famous and normally followed the regiment. Their mission usually involved killing the enemy’s commanders and generals for morale purposes. This was usually effective so their contribution was notable.

Li Qiye didn’t bother to move against the incoming sword thrusts.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Fiery sparks splashed everywhere. The swords aimed at his weakest spots but this was useless. They couldn’t leave a mark on the bronze plates, let alone penetrating the armor.

“It’s so tough!” The spectators couldn’t believe it.

The assassins immediately retreated after the failed attack. They knew better than to linger around.

“Stay and play.” Li Qiye chuckled and waved his hand, unleashing fiery particles.

The eighteen assassins couldn’t get out in time and took out their strongest treasures. This was still futile.

“Ah!!” They and their treasures were reduced to ashes. Once the particles dispersed, the ashes finally fell to the ground.

These assassins were mighty cultivators capable of killing commanders on the battlefield but had no chance resisting the blue flames.

“Leaders of a dynasty? Not that impressive.” Li Qiye chuckled while looking down on the Zhang.

Alas, no spectators dared to criticize his arrogant words.

“What do you want?!” The general shouted as his foe drew closer, frightened.

“I’m obviously going to destroy these two mansions.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Stop him!” The general roared again.

The remaining soldiers of the regiment had to go forward and formed a shield, separating themselves from Li Qiye.

“We need help, ask the Grand Commander.” The general ordered.

Being a general from the Zhang, asking the Li for help was quite humiliating. They believed that their regiment was not inferior to anything from the Li. Alas, they had no other choice and sounded the horn.

The Golden Regiment on the eastern front hesitated. Normally, it would be best to watch this massacre since the Grand Chancellor was their opponent.

However, they were on the same boat now. If Abyss Dragon were to go down, they would become the next target.

“Fortify the defenses!” Meanwhile, the general ordered. The remaining troops released all of their energy and vitality onto the shields.

A great golden wall erected in front of Li Qiye, seemingly impregnable.

Li Qiye smiled in response: “We’ll see how useful it is.” Having said that, he slightly shook his body.

“Clank!” The armors immediately assembled into a new form before the bewildered crowd - a massive ball.

“Rumble!” As it started rolling, the world seemed unable to withstand its weight. The tiles on the street instantly cracked and crumbled.

It kept on spinning with an unbelievable speed and weight, aiming for the great golden wall of Abyss Dragon. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Boom!” The thick wall didn’t last a second before being destroyed. The next victims were the members of the regiment. Their bones shattered and another rain of blood started.

Enough blood had spilled to form streams on the street - akin to an aftermath of a hurricane. The place became hellish to say the least.

Once people calmed down, they saw Li Qiye standing there, still dressed in full armor. The ball was nowhere to be found. It felt like an illusion if it wasn’t for the blood streams on the street.

“The smell... Ugh...” A young cultivator vomited.

“This treasure is unstoppable.” An expert took a deep breath. In their opinion, that ball’s weight alone shouldn’t have been this powerful. However, it easily smashed that fortified wall.

“That weapon can transform into anything?” An ancestor murmured.

This was their first time seeing such a versatile weapon.
