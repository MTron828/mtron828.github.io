Chapter 4816: Primordial Tree

“Her Majesty is still okay!” Only top cultivators could observe this fight. Weaker ones have already fainted or lost their wits.

She gave everyone hope again after breaking Dead Immortal’s soul-stealing technique. Thus, if she were to lose, then no one would be left to protect Eight Desolaces.

The supreme overlords paid attention to her capabilities as well. They had a good idea of her potential after seeing her in action during the end of the Nine Worlds Epoch. She also used the same spear to fight against the Ancient Ming.

Afterward, she focused on learning through the dao source and never showed up outside again. This effort was rewarded since she became far stronger than before.

In their eyes, only a few people have reached the apex of this world through cultivation. She was one of them - someone capable of contending against overlords.

“Incredible attachment with the dao source, to the point of mutual existence.” Dead Immortal said: “Rather impressive given that you’re not the epoch creator.”

Having said that, a different type of lightning appeared on its body. This was different from the ones in the mortal world. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Normally, the lightning bolts traveled quickly and only lasted for a moment. Now, they could see the bolts clearly and even the arrays of particles. It had something capable of subduing this affinity and exerting its true potential.

No cultivator could come up with this, only the paramount art of someone who had created a cultivation system. It then perfected this system and derived it to perfection, eventually culminating in a primordial understanding of the grand dao.

“Still lacking though.” Dead Immortal said. In its eyes, even reaching the limit of the grand dao to the point of having a connection with the dao source was not comparable to being a true dao creator.

“Dao Source - Primordial Tree!” She ignored his comment and roared.

“Buzz.” A tree gradually manifested into reality and emitted primordial laws and energy. This was the affinity at the start of time before the birth of living creatures and physical planes.

This was the dao source of Eight Desolaces - the pinnacle of power.

“Rumble!” The moment the tree appeared, cultivators and regular living beings felt themselves harmonizing with the world around them.

This was especially true for cultivators. They felt their grand dao resonating and giving them more power.

Some supreme overlords saw the tree and glanced at Li Qiye. They knew that he was the epoch creator, meaning that this dao source and the current cultivation system were also his. However, the Supreme Monarch was the one using it. Li Qiye had never resorted to using the tree previously.

“So that’s the dao source of our world…” Many became emotional.

The Primordial Tree was a mythical entity but today, they had the fortune to see it in person.

“To see it again in my lifetime, what a blessing.” An eternal existence was moved to tears.

He had seen it before during the great calamity. It protected Eight Desolaces but never showed up again just like the Supreme Monarch.

“Just a corner.” Dead Immortal’s tone became serious.

It was right. This wasn’t the entire tree, only one part of it. Nonetheless, it was still equal to one part of Li Qiye’s dao source. Since this was its epoch, it contained an incredible amount of power.

A previous epoch might have been more prosperous and peerless but ultimately, the present time still had the greatest advantage.

“Activate.” She whispered.

“Whoosh!” The energies of the tree blossomed like flowers and coiled around Dead Immortal.

Keep in mind that due to its lightning affinity, Dead Immortal possessed unmatched speed. Alas, it still couldn’t evade in time and was dragged into the primordial.

“Boom!” The Supreme Monarch gathered the power of the tree into her spear and unleashed an apocalyptic thrust.

“Limitless Lighting!” Dead Immortal didn’t dare to underestimate the enemy. An ancient lightning bolt stretched through an entire epoch, wielding all of its potentials. Her spear must travel through its entire path before getting to its destination.

This was akin to a fight between two supreme overlords. Alas, it was taking place in the primordial. Strongest cultivators with their heavenly gaze could only see two shadows moving about.

Nonetheless, their blows still caused violent quakes all over Eight Desolaces.

“Is this it?” Fear and anxiety overwhelmed all living beings.

The strongest cultivators have realized that they were mere ants in comparison. A supreme overlord had the ability to destroy the world and everything in it; there was nothing they could do to fight back.

They prayed, hoping that a second great calamity won’t occur again. Living as ants was still better than dying.

“Heed my arrival, mortal world.” Suddenly, they heard an ancient language not from this epoch.

However, they still understood the intent without a problem. It seemed to be coming from the deepest abyss under the ocean.

“Boom!” Somewhere in Eight Desolaces, water rushed into the air and formed a terrible maelstrom.

“Rumble!” The maelstrom’s rotation continually increased in speed, and so did its size.

It didn’t take long before it became visible from nearly everywhere.

This caused panic among the praying inhabitants. They screamed and tried to run but unfortunately, the maelstrom was gigantic enough to end the epoch.

“The old geezer is out to play.” The supreme overlords knew who it was.
