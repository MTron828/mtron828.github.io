Chapter 5878: Farewell

“Creak.” Li Qiye easily opened the gateway leading to another world.

If the overlords were still alive, they would be shocked because opening this gateway required perfect circumstances. In this case, Li Qiye was able to summon and open it at this random location.

Heavenly rays oozed in from the other side. Cultivators carefully sensed it and felt the presence of the high heaven. It was as if they could reach up and touch this mysterious entity.

They looked through the gateway and saw the world beyond. It seemed to be right behind the doors but in reality, traveling there required an immense length of time.

They saw figures in charge of the six dao and the reincarnation cycle. A hum could be heard, not on belonging to a phoenix or dragon but the harmonization of the grand dao.

This place made it easy to cultivate, seemingly the source of the dao. A genius would be able to reach a height unavailable in other worlds. Within the heavenly rays were secrets to the immortal dao - a way to reach everlasting life.

Li Qiye stood before the portal, only one step away from the next journey.

“This is the legendary Heavenrealm?” An ancient god couldn’t help but ask.

“I believe this is the destination for the expeditions.” Another murmured.

Long ago, people have embarked on expeditions. As far as variable history could go, there had been six expeditions - Origin, Deep South, Fei, Min Ren, and Gu Chun among others.

They didn’t go alone, choosing to form powerful alliances. Alas, none had returned after entering the mirror-like gateway.

Why did they go? Various theories came afterward - a fight against the heaven, a journey to the other shore, and many more...

Another popular one was the group being stuck at the imperial level, needing to go to another world to break through.

Another stated that the expedition was a way to avoid tribulations. The world already had too many emperors. If they stuck around, they would drain all the dao and essences.

Speculations aside, none had a true idea of Heavenrealm. After all, the adventurers never returned to tell the tale.

Were they still alive? In that case, perhaps they didn’t have a reason to return any longer.

“He’s going alone on this expedition.” An ancient god murmured.

The mightiest cultivators came to the gateway to bid farewell to Li Qiye.

“Sacred Teacher.” World and the others kneeled respectfully, aware of his goal.

“Goodbye everyone, I’m not sure if we will meet again.” Li Qiye waved at them.

“Let us follow you, Sacred Teacher.” Profound and his friends said.

“No need, this is my journey and I must walk it alone. If you all wish to enter Heavenrealm, you must rely on yourselves.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I will meet you there then.” Hao Hai said.

Alas, everyone knew how hard it was to meet him again. Not all would be strong enough to enter Heavenrealm; they required more time before attempting. By that point, he might no longer be there.

“Goodbye, everyone.” Li Qiye waved again and entered the gateway. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Farewell, Sacred Teacher.” Demon, Nightmoon, Fan Chen, and many others waved back. Some had tears in their eyes.

“Buzz.” He disappeared and the gateway dissipated.

“One day, one day we will embark as well.” A monarch said softly.

“I wonder what awaits us.” An emperor asked curiously.

“We are only starting, there is so much preparation to do.” Profound answered him.

He and the apex emperors understood the difficulty of entry but the true challenge was surviving. They would become minor characters in Heavenrealm, prey to the monsters there.

Two options were available - rushing entry to take advantage of the cultivation speed or taking their time to become stronger here.

“The cultivation system is different there, right?” A monarch asked.

“Even then, it’s negligible.” Hao Hai said since he had listened to Li Qiye’s hints before.

It was possible to break the limit easily in Heavenrealm. Because of this, it had numerous overlords.

Just the seven in Trinity were virtually unstoppable. The overlords in Heavenrealm were even stronger, how could they ever hope to contend?

“This is why he said the imperial realm is only the beginning.” Immortal Emperor Fan Chen said sentimentally.
