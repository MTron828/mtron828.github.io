Chapter 4665: Dao Lord Attack

Horns of war and detonations sounded over the mountains. Celestial lights and banners fluttered with the start of a grand formation.

True Immortal, Three Thousand Dao, Divine Dragon, and Five-sun controlled this formation to barricade the targeted mountain.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Gigantic shields appeared and lined up like walls. Cries of dragons and other beasts could be heard as divine runes appeared.

Next came countless swords descending from the air and rotating endlessly. The sword intent turned into an oceanic sword dao. It didn’t take long before this mountain was unapproachable.

“They want to stop the dynasty’s offense.” Spectators understood with haste.

“Look at that legion, the dynasty must have the gemstone too.” Someone else said since their king was here in person.

After all, this gemstone might be left behind by the immortal from Worldbreaker. Therefore, no sects from Worldbreaker would want it to fall to the hand of outsiders. Thus, they mobilized against the behemoths.

“So the alliance isn’t meant for other powers, only to face Worldbreaker and the dynasty.” A few realized something.

A while ago, many assumed that the alliance was meant to stop everyone else from participating in the competition. They didn’t realize that even the dynasty would get involved.

“They don’t need an alliance to deal with us. Just True Immortal alone is enough.” A big shot shook his head.

This was hard to hear but no one could refute this. Only the behemoths themselves could face True Immortal. Other great powers lacked the firepower to compete so an alliance was simply unnecessary.

Only a monster such as the dynasty warranted this extreme measure.

“Boom!” The dynasty launched an offense against the alliance. Experts in the legion released their howling fist dao in the form of energy dragons.

They smashed into the barriers and walls, causing constant shaking.

“They’re so strong…” Even an experienced cultivator gasped.

An armored figure landed on the battlefield. It was none other than Godwhip Princess. Two groups of cavalries galloped from behind her.

“Kill them!” She led the way for a counter-offensive.

“She’s truly battle-hardened.” The crowd was impressed since she showed no fear against the mighty dynasty.

“Demon Rampage!” Jadedragon Monarch also showed up with his fellow demons. They barricaded themselves in front of the mountain.

On the ridge, Paramount Scion blew a war horn and summoned his sect members in preparation for the war.

“Brothers and sisters, Sword Formation!” True Immortal Saintess also prepared a sword formation on the frontline. A rain of swords poured down against the attackers.

“Rumble!” The two mighty forces collided. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The young geniuses from the alliance didn’t back down and had the style of capable generals. Each of them could lead an army effectively.

“They are truly superior to their peers, the behemoths know how to train.” One ancestor commented.

For many great powers, their best disciples’ ceiling was Godwhip Princess’ group. This was a disparity between regular sects and the behemoths.

The geniuses were fierce and capable, the same for their fellow sect members. Alas, they lacked years of training to deal with the dynasty.

Thus, in just a short time, their forces were being pushed back.

“Try this!” A shout resembling the roar of a dragon or the screech of a phoenix interrupted the battle.

“Boom!” Eight majestic stallions appeared along with dao lord laws. This was an attack of a dao lord, virtually unstoppable.

Numerous fist slaves were sent flying, their top combatants included.

“A dao lord attack already?” Countless spectators were forced to the ground from the pressure despite maintaining a safe distance.

Performing a dao lord attack required being recognized by the weapon itself. With that, the user would be able to use the weapon’s true power.

Some believed that such an attack was equivalent to seventy to eighty percent of an actual attack from the respective dao lord.

It immediately stopped the march from the dynasty’s soldiers. Sky Border itself shook violently.

Big shots outside of Worldbreaker felt the power of the attack and trembled in fear.

“Who used a dao lord attack just now?” An ancestor took a deep breath.

Many geniuses had access to a dao lord weapon; only a few could use them effectively.

“Senior Brother!” Godwhip Princess looked up and saw a magnificent man. Her eyes were filled with adoration.

Others also looked up and saw an unreasonably handsome man, perhaps the most handsome in the world.

“His appearance is unmatched.” Female cultivators became enamored.
