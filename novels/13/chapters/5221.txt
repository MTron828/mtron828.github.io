Chapter 5222: Duality Master’s Son?

“How can this be?!” Xiao Qingtian lost his cool since he had personally experienced the pressure of the thirteenth image.

Given his power and determination, he still walked at a snail’s pace through it. Each step made his bones creak in pain, on the verge of crumbling down. The pain coursed through his nerves and tested his limit. Just relaxing a bit meant losing.

“The fourteenth!” The crowd shouted again once Li Qiye surpassed Xiao Qingtian’s record while still maintaining the same pace.

“How is he doing this…” Xiao Qingtian felt his ego deflating like a balloon. He exerted all of his strength to lift his foot, unable to actually touch the ground inside the fourteenth image.

Thus, this dealt a great blow to him. Was he wrong to be confident due to his talent and perseverance?

While he was overwhelmed with self-doubt, Ye Fantian continued to observe Li Qiye’s movements while muttering: “There’s something to this, is this the path of the dragon lord, as long as one walks on this path, they’ll be able to traverse the images?”

Xiao Qingtian heard this and regained his wits. He started observing the first step again.

He thought about how there was an invisible path beneath Li Qiye’s feet during the stroll.

“This is what the founders want to leave behind?!” He clapped and shouted.

The mighty dragon lords heard this and recalled Li Qiye’s steps again to the exact detail, the particular distances between each one. There really seemed to be a path that was indiscernible to them.

“Did Duality Master walk on this path as well?” Ye Fantian had a sharp intuition.

“That’s plausible. Wait, so is he a descendant of Duality Master and has been given this secret?” Xiao Qingtian said. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Duality Master was rumored to be a mortal. This Li Qiye had the same inconspicuous appearance. Could the two be related? This would explain everything going on right now.

“The seventeenth!” Cultivators continued to count.

“Pop!” He finally entered the last one before the dao source.

“...He did it, he did it!” After he entered the last one, people froze for a bit before shouting in disbelief.

“The second to ever do it after Duality Master!” The crowd clamored.

Reclusive ancestors from Imperial Gate appeared as well. Not many have been able to attempt ever since the bridge was created by Suppression Conqueror.

Today, one youth had made it through the thirteenth image and now, this person actually made it to the dao source.

Moreover, he did it without requiring any effort.

“How do I enter the path?” Xiao Qingtian became curious about the process. He believed that if he could do so, he would be able to enter the apex of the path and perhaps catch up to the founders one day.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye stared at the dao source. All of its mysteries and dao were clear to him after one glance.

“I wonder how he is related to Duality Master.” Ye Fantian’s intuition told her that there was a connection between Li Qiye and Duality Master. Could Li Qiye actually be his son?

“You’ve been laying in this ocean for generations now, do I have to drag you out?” Li Qiye suddenly spoke.

The crowd became confused. Who was he speaking to?

“Rumble!” The ocean of phenomena suddenly became violent with waves and bubbles. Something large was climbing out - colossal bones at first with a golden color.

“What is that?!” The crowd shouted.

“Boom!” A golden skeleton appeared before them; its reflection was blindingly bright.

“Sanctified Bones!” Some recognized this figure - the junior brother of Suppression Conqueror. Rumor has it that he was a descendant of Bones Dao Lord.

“An eleven-fruit dragon lord, wait, he has twelve now!” Another spotted the change.
