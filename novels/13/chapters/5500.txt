Chapter 5501: Uninvited Guest

He recognized her - someone who has been missing for eras now. When they first met in the nine worlds, she gave him the impression of being persistent and spirited, strong yet serene, unambitious but capable…

She was an unpolished gem so he taught her the scripture known as Sunset Glow. He believed that given her dao heart, she could accomplish great things.

During Eight Desolaces, those fortunate enough to be taught by Li Qiye soared and became dominant figures - dao lords or renowned “immortals”.

She didn’t appear during Eight Desolaces; he didn’t come across her lineage or legacy either. It was as if she had disappeared in the river of time.

Of course, Li Qiye didn’t find this surprising since not all seeds could go far on the dao path. Many eventually stopped and became mediocre and unremarkable, blending in with the masses and fading into obscurity.

He didn’t pursue her absence during his visit to Eight Desolaces. Thus, seeing her statue on the six continents was somewhat surprising. Moreover, this was the immortal continent and she was clearly the most important figure in this temple.

It seemed that she didn’t become an Immortal Emperor or a dao lord. Nonetheless, she had made a name for herself in Sunset Glow Valley.

Ultimately, her silent ascension to the six continents matched her personality - calm and unyielding, strong but not domineering.

His astonishment only grew after seeing the base of the statue - a tablet engraved with profound runes from an untraceable period.

It was incomplete, seemingly taken from a larger piece to this place.

“Hmm…” Li Qiye knew that there was only one place where these runes could be found. He sat down on a woven mat and took his time analyzing the runes.

After an unknown period of time, he had an answer for the tablet’s true origin.

“Immortal Dao City, I see, it is indeed different from the other eight.” He murmured.

At this moment, an old face suddenly appeared out of nowhere. This could startle or terrify anyone due to the dark lighting of the temple.

The wrinkly old woman had an oil lamp in her hand. She came to light the incense burners and candles.

She wore a tattered dress that looked too small for her current size. The fabrics might have shrunken over the years.

Her hair was gray and thinning; she was missing many teeth as well. She resembled the flickering candles in the temple, on the verge of death at any moment.

“Sir, where did you come from?” She only approached to take a look before resuming her task.

Her movement was deliberate and meticulously, carefully shielding the flame with her hand as if afraid of it being extinguished by winds.

“From a distant place.” He smiled.

“I see.” She glanced at Li Qiye before staring outside and commenting: “It’s been many years since we’ve received visitors, not that we get many either way.”

“I came uninvited.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s alright.” She nodded and said: “Well, we don’t invite outsiders so all visitors are uninvited.”

“Why did you stop?” Li Qiye asked with a faint smile.

“The world is no longer the same. Our valley has been reclusive for years now after the departure of Cloudsweep Fairy. The disciples focus on cultivation, no longer participating in worldly affairs.” She sighed before looking at the statue in front of Li Qiye: “That’s Cloudsweep Fairy, our legend for heralding a new age of prosperity.”

“Oh? I’m curious about this legend.” Li Qiye smiled.

She glanced at the oil lamp in her hand and said: “My memory is hazy due to my age and plus, this is ancient history. Even the fairy had passed away long ago.”ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Yet she is still remembered and celebrated?” Li Qiye asked.

“Yes, if it wasn’t for her, the sect would not be around right now. We must pay our respect for as long as we exist.” She nodded.

“I can see that.” Li Qiye glanced at the statue and nodded. They placed her in the central position even over their own progenitor.

“According to the legends, she was not a member of Sunset Glow. She most likely came from below.” The woman continued.

“Eight Desolaces.” Li Qiye said softly.

“Yes, the place known as Eight Desolaces.” She looked up and stared at Li Qiye: “Have you been there before, Sir?”

“I’ve been to many places.” Li Qiye smiled.

“A true master indeed.” She said: “I spent the majority of my life in Sunset Glow and have only heard of Eight Desolaces, a land of many heroes and talents.”

Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t respond.

“I believe that the fairy was neither a dao lord nor a conqueror when she first arrived. She came to our sect by chance during a ruinous period after the devastation of the great war. We only had a few disciples left and this place was on the verge of being abandoned.” She said.

Although Sunset Glow was a relatively powerful sect in the previous epoch, Immortal Epoch War wiped out even the behemoths. It was fortunate to have survived, partly due to its isolation policies. They only had five or so disciples left when Cloudsweep Fairy arrived.

“She still chose your sect.” Li Qiye said.

“Right, I heard she said that because she likes our name, Sunset Glow, that these words are connected to her by fate.” She nodded.
