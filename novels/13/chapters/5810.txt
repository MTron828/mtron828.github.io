Chapter 5810: Dark Crow, Enough!

Li Qiye shook his head at the pale emperor and said: “A pillar of Celestial Court, huh? Not that loyal. The old geezers viewed you as a main branch, that’s why they made you the lord, haha, looks like you have no wish to sacrifice yourself for Celestial Court.”

Having said that, he stared at the Hao Hai and the others: “Keke, outsiders are more loyal, I wonder what the old geezers are thinking after seeing this.”

“You! When the intent is to accuse, one can say anything!” Nether angrily exclaimed.

Others lost confidence in him despite knowing that this was the rational choice against Li Qiye. Nevertheless, this reflected terribly on him as a leader and killed the morale.

“Do we leave now?” A few began forming alliances in secrecy since the situation grew dire.

“We must protect Celestial Court even without the Ancestors, I will die for this cause!” Sword Emperor shouted.

“Haven’t we lived long enough? Dying in battle is a great way to go.” Hao Hai laughed and said.

“Assemble our power to empower the treasure.” Profound readied himself for one last attempt to stop Li Qiye.

They had to rely on the heavenly treasure - mustering all of their strength to use it.

“This should work.” Sword Emperor stepped forward and ordered the others.

“Fine, count me in.” Light-dragon shouted.

“Gather all of our vitality and strength.” Heaven Burial released his power, being the first to channel his powers and heavenly blessing outward.

“I agree!” War Ancient God did the same.

“Profound, please take charge.” Those wanting to fight placed their hope on Profound Emperor and channeled everything into him.

If he could control the treasure enough, perhaps this could slow Li Qiye down. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

However, not all were willing to do so since losing meant certain death. Without their vitality and blessings, their wills or fruits would be reduced to ashes.

Characters such as Immortal Emperor Fu Mo and Zhuo Huo hesitated, still thinking about Nether’s indecisiveness.

“How admirable, looks like the great Celestial Court still needs defeated cultivators to shoulder the burden since the old geezers are scared witless and cowering in their shell.” Li Qiye laughed.

Having said that, he told the group: “You all dare to face death with equanimity so I will let you die swiftly and with dignity. After all, heroes deserve respect, the same can’t be said about the old geezers.”

“Hmph!” A thunderous scowl shook everyone’s heart and mind.

“Dark Crow, enough!” A voice came from deep within Celestial Palace.

Everyone felt a surge of energy despite not knowing who spoke. Nevertheless, it was certainly one of the Ancestors.

“Ancestors!” Nether rejoiced.

“Creak.” The gate of Celestial Palace slowly opened and attracted everyone’s attention.

There’s hope - many thought to themselves.

The Ancestors might not be enough to defeat Li Qiye but the overlords were there as well.

Three figures came out of the palace and surrounded Li Qiye. Each had a unique aura to them, definitely not at the imperial level.

“Heavener, diviner, and devil.” Their race was obvious to the crowd.

“The three immortals.” Someone said.

They were clearly Ancestors and have been in this realm for a long time now. Previous speculations proved to be correct. World, Profound, and Jiao Heng made it to this realm while these three were older and had the resources of Celestial Court.

The former’s primal anima aura could only be sensed when they activated their power. However, these three’s auras seemed to be radiating from their bones and flesh, giving off an innate and natural sense.
