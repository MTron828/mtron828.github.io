Chapter 5757: What Is He Like?

“They’re real.” Li Qiye smiled.

“That’s amazing.” Ling’er revealed a smile as beautiful as flowers.

The star and the cloud circled her briefly before returning to Li Qiye. Both stared at him and seemed to have determined something.

Li Qiye patted them and said: “Looks like we’ve found the right place and person.”

“Are you an immortal?” Ling’er couldn’t help but ask - her eyes brimmed with anticipation and innocence.

“Why is that?” He smiled.

“Only an immortal can befriend clouds and stars.” She said.

“I’m not one, and immortals do not exist.” He shook his head.

She remained skeptical and stared at the duo: “Then how come these two are following you?”

“Fate.” He smiled.

“What kind of fate? How do I do the same?” She asked curiously. Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

“Perhaps you already have it.” He revealed a mysterious smile.

“I already have it?” She didn’t understand but still remembered to ask him to sit down and prepare tea for him.

He sat down and took a sip.

Her curiosity didn’t die down as she asked: “Young Noble, what are you if not an immortal?”

“Just like you, a regular person.” He said.

The star and cloud gave him the side eye for lying.

“I see.” She stared at him, finding that this would be true if it weren't for the two strange friends.

“I don’t think that’s the case at all, Young Noble.” She eventually concluded after a brief moment of contemplation.

“Why is that? I don’t have three heads and six arms.” He answered before blowing his tea to cool it down.

“Well, I can’t explain it, just my intuition.” She shook her head.

“What about you then?” He asked.

“Of course I’m just a regular person.” She blurted.

“Regular in what ways?” He continued.

She touched her chin as she answered: “I was adopted by my parents as a baby and never left this place, I’ve been living here all this time.”

“How come you haven’t left?” He asked.

“I have a weak constitution.” She felt relaxed while talking to him as if they were good friends.

“Have you thought about traveling?” He asked.

“Hmm...” She took her time before replying: “I feel like I’ve traveled far and been to many places already.”

“What makes you say that?” He smiled.

She tapped her temple, seemingly feeling troubled: “I don’t know, it just feels like I’ve been to many places in my dreams, but they feel too real to be just dreams.”

“More like memories buried deep within.” He said: “They occasionally resurface.”

“Yes, exactly like that!” She felt as if she had found a kindred spirit after hearing this: “They were very real, not like illusions or dreams. It’s just that I can’t seem to remember anything.”

“Crossing space and time.” He said.

“Space and time?” This comment confused her since she was just a mortal.

“It’s like experiencing several lifetimes, reincarnation.” He smiled.

She nodded several times and said: “I told my parents this and they said that I was just dreaming.”

“Perhaps some of your experiences were from your past lives.” He responded.

She stood there in a daze because reincarnation was just a belief in the mortal world, nothing more.

“Reincarnation is real?” She asked with uncertainty.

“Reincarnation might not be real, but certain things can be passed down.” He said with a serious expression.

“What do you mean?” She became curious.

“For example, a seal.” He stared at her for a bit before averting his gaze.

“I am unfamiliar with it.” She said.

“You have read stories of immortals? They can conjure seals capable of lasting through endless cycles, they have various other effects.” He elaborated.

“I see...” She listened with a mixture of understanding and confusion. It sounded like a surreal tale from the legends.

“You might feel that you have gone to many places, but it’s unlikely that you have done so.” He continued.

She stood there in silence, thinking about her experiences. It was understandable that no one would believe her.

After a long while, she thought about something: “There is someone who has been with me to these places.”

“Who is it?” He smiled.

“...” The moment she tried to remember, she felt as if her head had just been struck by a hammer. She couldn’t help holding her head in pain.

“You don’t have to remember.” He gently touched her forehead and secretly channeled primordial light.

This made her feel better, allowing her to try and remember. A while later, she said: “An older man, he was my companion.”

“What is he like?” He stared into her eyes, seemingly wanting to illuminate her mind.

“I don’t know, I just know that he took me to so many places, one of them was filled with stars.” She shook her head.
