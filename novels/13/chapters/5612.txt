Chapter 5613: Magnificent Blade

“I won’t be around forever.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Aren’t you occasionally tempted to stay, Your Excellency?” The man crouched down and picked up a shell. After seeing that it wasn’t pretty enough, he placed it back down and continued the search.

“Tell me, what do you think will happen if I stay?” Li Qiye asked.

“Hmm...” This required the man to ponder.

“Just like a tiger hanging around a flock of sheep.” Li Qiye answered his own question.

‘You’re funny, Your Excellency.” The man shook his head and smiled.

“I’m not joking, if I were to stop, it means that there is a reason for me to do so. However, nothing lasts forever. When this reason is gone, it’ll be a fierce beast released from its cage, and who will be able to restrain it? I am not an exception to this.”

“The mortal world isn’t worthy of your stay.” The man said softly.

“It’s not like that. A different way to put it is that everything is ephemeral while my dao is endless.” Li Qiye said.

“Shallow waters cannot retain a true dragon.” The man remarked.

“Yes, and that’s good for the fish and shrimps. If the true dragons stick around and do not eat fish and shrimp, what will they eat? If they devour everything else, the fish and shrimps will starve to death anyway.” Li Qiye said.

“If you put it like that, Your Excellency, maybe it’s best for true masters to leave.” The man smiled.

“Either that or slay the dragons and make a big feast for everyone else.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Unfortunately, fish and shrimps can’t slay dragons.” The man shook his head.

“Don’t be so sure, some might get confident after growing big enough, thinking about how delicious a dragon can be. Not only will they become full, the pond and their descendants will feast for generations to come.” Li Qiye said.

“The dragon can devour everything in one go, it doesn’t seem competitive.” The man said. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Remember, there are other evil dragons around. They’re all hungry and probably won’t mind teaming up against one. The fish and shrimps can get some cold soups afterward.” Li Qiye said.

“Now that’s an idea.” The man said: “The problem is that it’s easy to invite guests to the house but harder getting them to leave. Who can guarantee that the other dragons won’t start eating smaller creatures?”

“Oh, it’s a certainty, not a possibility.” Li Qiye said: “It’s just a matter of waiting for the right time to feast.”

“Evil dragons aren’t born naturally.” The man sighed.

Li Qiye picked up another shell and handed it to the man who was pleased with its patterns. He then put it inside his pocket.

“Yes, they used to be fish and shrimps that got bigger and smarter, or maybe just lucky with fortunes.” Li Qiye said.

“Only to eat their own kind.” The man murmured.

“Not surprising at all. I was one of the shrimps, if I stay long enough, I might start eating shrimps.” Li Qiye said.

“I don’t think you would ever do that, Your Excellency.” The man smiled wryly.

“When I can let go of my dao heart, it won’t be a problem to open my mouth and devour all else. I won’t feel bad or find it improper, just another meal.” Li Qiye said.

“You’re right, Your Excellency. I can’t catch up to your height and can only stay here.” The man sighed.

“No, your pursuit is with the mortal world regardless of the changes around you, a reversion to the origin. That’s why the sword is with you.” Li Qiye smiled.

“It’s only because you and Brother Min Ren entrusted it to me.” The man said.

“Ultimately, a good sword deserves a good master, and it’s about time for it to get on stage.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, I suppose I’ll find out how weak I am after getting on stage.” The man said.

“That depends on who you’re comparing yourself with. Anyone else in this mortal world? Easy, but as the old geezers from Celestial Court? You have a way to go since you’re a big fish in this pond while they’re close to becoming dragons.” Li Qiye said.

“In the end, we still have to rely on you, Your Excellency.” The man said: “Our power has always been limited. We would have been wiped out during Grand Dao War if it wasn’t for the empress and the others.”

“There will always be unexpected developments, just do your best with a clear conscience and no regrets.” Li Qiye said.

“I will not let you down, Your Excellency. I am ready to serve.” The man said.

“I don’t have much for you to do, I’m just here to tell you that the war drums are sounding, it’s finally time for war.” Li Qiye shook his head and smiled.

“Your Excellency, is this generation the last for Celestial Court? We have been waiting for a long time now.”

“We need the perfect opportunity because flattening Celestial Court alone is pointless.” Li Qiye smiled: “Killing Sword, Nether, and Hao Hai doesn't do anything outside of temporarily deflating their spirits. A new Celestial Court will rise and others will come under its banner in the future.”

“Can we actually destroy a heavenly treasure? Does such a force exist in the mortal world?” The man asked.

“Easier said than done, nearly impossible.” Li Qiye said: “But we can catch the enormous fish and shrimps, there are rules and limits to Celestial Court and places where it can’t go.”

“Do you wish to take control of it, Your Excellency?” The man found another worthy shell and put it away.

“There’s a secret to this and I do not have the key. Plus, it’s a picturesque place, taking it away will spoil the scenery.” Li Qiye said.

“I’m sure you know this secret now and will be able to grasp it.” The man said.

“The truth is that the answer was always in my mind, it’s just that I didn’t understand until a certain step. Now, everything is within reach.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Your victory is all but assured, Your Excellency.” The man said.

“We’ll be pulling the net soon to end everything. Of course, even rabbits will bite when pushed to the edge, let alone Celestial Court.” Li Qiye said.

“And we shall take care of them for you, Your Excellency.” The man bowed.

“A sword must be used or even the finest will rust.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Our stage is at Celestial Court, we will mobilize.” The man said without any hesitation.

Attacking Celestial Court was an earth-shattering matter yet it was decided after just a few sentences.
