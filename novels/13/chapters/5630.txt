Chapter 5631: Demon Nightspear


The figure stared at him since it had been too long since their last meeting.

He spread his arms and said: “Come, I didn’t give you a hug during our parting last time.”Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Her eyes brightened and all else became irrelevant. This was all she ever wanted - the reason for her sacrifice.

She threw herself into his open arms, prompting him to sigh and tighten his embrace.

She buried her head in his chest, inadvertently wetting his robe with tears. Her happiness made the world incredibly beautiful at this moment.

“I miss you so much.” She finally said the words that had been on her mind for so long.

“I never gave up on you, so I’m happy to see this.” He said.

“I know, that’s why I didn’t walk astray.” She said softly, smiling instead of crying.

The embrace lasted for a long time. She didn’t want to let go as if he might disperse afterward. Eventually, she looked up to take a close look at his face.

“Will we meet again?” She asked.

He sighed first before nodding: “You won’t give up and neither will I. If that’s the case, why can’t we meet again?”

Having said that, he reached into the primordial will and took out a strand of the purest primordial light. Its value was incalculable.

“Buzz.” He imprinted it into her forehead. Karmic ties and everything else relating to the strand became permanent. Time and heavenly might wouldn’t be able to crush it. As long as the strand was around, everything could start again from the beginning.

“Go, bring it with you.” He said softly.

“Very well.” She nodded in agreement. Her dao heart had always been unyielding and unshakable. 

She stared at him and was filled with reluctance, not wanting to avert her gaze. Nonetheless, time must flow and the cycles continue; this parting was only temporary.

“You have a part in the future and I’ll be there as well.” He gently patted her head.

“Buzz.” Despite her unwillingness to leave, her figure slowly dispersed into bright particles. They latched onto the primordial strand and wove together into a supreme law. The strand then carried everything into the air.

“Boom!” It managed to pierce a tiny hole through the curtain of the sky. From there, one could catch a glimpse of a special location - the ever-unchanging High Heaven Aegis.

“Pop!” The opening quickly closed after the strand made it through.

“High Heaven Aegis.” Li Qiye murmured, aware of this area. He walked out of the palace and left the star with Demon Conqueror. 

Back in Thousand Emperor Island, he gazed forlornly into the ocean and let out a sigh.

“Your Excellency, is it time to mobilize?” Demon gave him some time before asking.

“I have to visit High Heaven Aegis first.” He said with a smile.

“We have to cross the ancient battlefield to get there, I’ll accompany you, Your Excellency.” She said.

“No, stay here, a storm is coming.” He said while glancing in a particular direction.

“Very well, I will guard this place.” She understood without needing elaboration.

“The spear in your possession is incredible. Your knowledge is commendable but not enough, I will lend you a hand.” He said before touching her forehead with one finger.

“Boom!” A spear appeared inside of her mind, causing waves to pulse outward.

This weapon was entirely black and made from unknown materials. There were no signs of polishment from the tip to the shaft; the two were seamlessly together as one piece. This made it look naturally formed - a creation of heaven and earth blessed with their power.

It looked unimpressive at first glance but when holding it, the user understood that it could pierce through anything.

Upon closer inspection, one would find that this was more like a world of darkness capable of devouring souls. Inside contained terrifying ghosts and fiends…

The spear sensed Li Qiye and wanted to fly out. He scowled and gripped it, not allowing an escape.

“Rumble!” It struggled to no avail.

Demon’s twelve dao fruits and anima tree manifested into reality along with the four symbols of the fate palace.

He utilized her various power sources as a temporary cauldron, sending his dao flame to refine the spear.

The process caused the spear to emit wisps of black smoke. The dao flame instantly incinerated them upon sight.

“Rumble!” This cycle continued until the spear’s appearance changed. A unique seal belonging to Demon embedded itself into the weapon. The harmonization was completed and it became her ultimate weapon. The two seemed to be one.

A shimmering green light coursed through the spear. The ray strands alone were fatal.

Li Qiye took a good look at it and said: “It used to be Terra Damnation but from today henceforth, it’ll be Demon Nightspear, yours alone.”

Anyone else would have been crushed by the refinement process going on inside their sea of consciousness.

Fortunately, Demon was an apex conqueror who could endure the repeated forging. Of course, this didn’t feel good either.

She was completely drained and if it wasn’t for Li Qiye’s support, she would have collapsed on the ground.

“Demon Nightspear…” She felt an unprecedented sense of familiarity with the unique spear.
