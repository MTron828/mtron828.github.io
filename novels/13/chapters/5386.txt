Chapter 5387: The Lonely Dao

The end of the battle caused unrest among top cultivators who were aware that a storm was coming.

Moreover, the insightful ones understood that a fight between All-things Dao Lord and Illumination Conqueror was inevitable.

Those from The People thought about who they should support. The ones from Eight Desolaces had an easy answer. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Thus, not just in the illusory realms but the entire upper continents were in a furor. Plans were concocted in secrecy.

Of course, none of this mattered to Li Qiye. The so-called “apex” cultivators in this world have yet to reach the apex in his eyes.

He continued to delve deeper into Dream Abyss with his followers. The path became increasingly beautiful and seemingly less dangerous. The notion of the abyss was no longer present.

After all, this was a dream world and it should be beautiful. The sky above was full of stars and auroras while the ground had fields of flowers.

As they crossed through the field, they saw a peak with a single tree on top. Flowers blossomed on the branches as if spring was in full bloom.

“Sir, could I have a moment of your time?” A person beneath the tree bowed in Li Qiye’s direction.

Li Qiye glanced at him and smiled.

The middle-aged man dressed neatly; not a single speck of dust could be seen on his white robe. He had longer bangs, seemingly covering part of his vision and making him appear somewhat melancholic.

His aura was one of stability and righteousness - a reflection of his upright personality. He could be trusted by both friends and enemies. One wouldn’t find it surprising to see him chatting with a noble or a beggar.

“Darkfrost.” Ferocity and Li Xian’er had a serious expression after seeing another apex cultivator.

“What is it?” Li Qiye asked with a smile.

“I have something on my mind so I specifically waited here for you, Sir. Please have a seat.” Darkfrost lowered his head and said.

“Very well.” Li Qiye agreed.

“Brat, we’re leaving.” Ferocity patted Xiao Hu’s shoulder and pulled him away without permission again.

Li Xian’er also left in another direction.

Darkfrost prepared a pot of tea and excellent pastry for Li Qiye as they sat beneath the tree.

“Flowers bloom and fall in their own time but cultivators have no time to rest.” Darkfrost caught a petal and said.

Li Qiye chuckled and took a sip without responding.

“Sir, why do we seek the dao?” Darkfrost sincerely asked.

“That is a question only you can answer.” Li Qiye said.

“I do not know why I bother at times.” Darkfrost gazed into the distance and let out a sigh.

He was known for his benevolent and compassionate nature. Rumor has it that one could rest in peace after entrusting Darkfrost Dao Lord with anything.

Three Truth Dao Lord did just that - entrusting his daughter to him. He arranged a safe place for her in the lower continents, allowing her to become a conqueror without facing constant threats.

“Thinking of your wife?” Li Qiye said.

“You can see right through me, Sir.” Darkfrost took a deep breath.

He came from Dao Institution of Eight Desolaces - a perpetual alliance with Flame Valley.

He obtained one of the nine heavenly swords at a young age - Flamedao. With that, he became a dao lord - no longer restrained by the marriage pact between Dao Institution and Flame Valley.

He could have chosen anyone he fancied in that generation. However, he still obeyed the long-lasting tradition and picked an ordinary female disciple from Flame Valley - something rather unexpected.

Any random saintess or princess would have been stronger than his choice. Nonetheless, he married her and taught her the sword dao, treating her as an equal.

Under his guidance, she eventually learned his Flamedao and slowly caught up to him.

Of course, there was still a considerable gap between the two but she could be his partner in battle. Their combined might in battle exceeded his own.

Her journey from being an ordinary disciple to a cultivator worthy of being the wife of a dao lord was known to all. Their romance didn’t wane with time so they were always seen together.

Alas, she was not a dao lord so death from old age came knocking eventually. She had to leave her husband, albeit unwillingly.

With that, Darkfrost chose to ascend to the six continents and became an apex cultivator.

“The dao is a lonely path.” Li Qiye responded.

He had said this numerous times but not all listeners have experienced this. Darkfrost was one exception.

“Does it have to be?” He asked.

“Then you must meet someone else who can make the same journey.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s the hard part.” He paused for a moment before responding.

“This is another test for your dao heart, once you surpass it, you will be able to travel far and beyond. However, once you do, you will no longer need anyone else to walk with you.” Li Qiye said.

“I see.” The dao lord murmured.
