Chapter 4295: Arrival

Not bothering to name the technique astounded Elder Hu and Wang Weiqiao. Li Qiye didn’t bother teaching his new disciple a new merit law, only a casual swing.

Could this even be considered a technique? Why didn’t he change Chaos to something else or just a superior version?

To be perfectly blunt, did Li Qiye really teach Weiqiao anything?

“Try your best now.” Li Qiye said: “Don’t bite more than one can chew. No need to cultivate multiple merit laws or refine invincible treasures. The key is to possess an eternal dao heart, that’s the most important prerequisite.”

“I shall obey, Master.” Though Weiqiao was still confused, he still remembered Li Qiye’s movement earlier.

“Ask me if you have questions.” Li Qiye wasn’t a hands-on teacher and left afterward, letting Weiqiao figure it out on his own.

Weiqiao bowed to show respect while thinking that this felt like a bizarre dream.

Nonetheless, his resolute nature remained. It didn’t matter what Li Qiye taught him, he would still do his best one step at a time without uttering a single word of grievance.

The majority of those who joined their sect master’s tutelage hoped to have access to the best and most exclusive merit laws possible. That’s a primary reason for becoming a sect master’s disciple. However, Weiqiao didn’t harbor this thought; he was content with just learning whatever Li Qiye taught him.

Cultivation itself was part of his life. He had never given up in the past and this was still the case in the present.

Normally, most would have given up in this hopeless situation. They knew that death was coming so what was the point of training any further for no improvement? It wouldn’t change anything.

People in his case would return to the mortal world and live the rest of their lives in luxury and riches. Even the weakest cultivator could enjoy such a life in the mortal world.

Weiqiao’s pursuit was the process of cultivation itself. He didn’t view it as a means for another goal.

He stayed true to his path and trained diligently. Whenever he had a question, he immediately went to ask Li Qiye.

Though he didn’t understand all of the teachings at first, he took his time learning in a meticulous manner. In the past, no one was there to guide him from his errors. Now, with Li Qiye’s help, his path was brighter than ever before. This motivated him even further.

Li Qiye wasn’t a demanding master either, never telling the old man to reach a particular realm. Nonetheless, Weiqiao was still ambitious and spirited despite his age. His body was old, not his mind.

This might be one of the reasons why Li Qiye picked him as a disciple. Few had this privilege in history.

***

A tiny sect such as Little Diamond rarely had serious matters to deal with, only minor issues. The latter didn’t need Li Qiye’s attention since the five elders could take care of it. Li Qiye had no intention of taking charge either. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Sect Master, Young Noble Du Weiwu insists on meeting you.” Today, there was a matter that the first elder couldn’t deal with.

“A young master of a noble clan. The clan itself isn’t a big deal but his first uncle is the master of Eight Demons Gate, his uncle-in-law is a member of Dragon Sect.” The first elder elaborated.

Eight Demons Gate was just a small sect in this region, only slightly stronger than Little Diamond and its neighbors.

This wasn’t the case for Dragon Sect. It was considered the strongest demon branch in Southern Desolace. Many believed that it was only second to Lion’s Roar Kingdom.

Thus, Dragon was definitely a behemoth compared to Little Diamond - an unreachable true dragon. Just any expert from this sect could annihilate Little Diamond.

Therefore, this Du Weiwu was nothing himself but he had some strong backers. This was the reason why the first elder exercised caution.

“Not interested.” Li Qiye replied.

“Sect Master, I think he is aiming for our ancient immortal physique after having heard some rumors like a shark smelling blood. He won’t leave without meeting you.” The elder said.

In reality, the guy has been in Little Diamond for several days now.

Initially, the elders wanted to politely send him away via gifts because he shouldn’t be offended. Alas, he was hellbent on meeting their sect master.

“A shark smelling blood?” Li Qiye smirked after hearing this: “Fine, let’s go take a look at this shark.”

The first elder shuddered after seeing his smile despite not being aware of its implication.

It didn’t take long before Du Weiduwas granted an audience with Li Qiye.

He was around twenty years of age - a young deer demon with a small antler. He was rather handsome and wore an extravaganly-embroidered robe, looking a bit haughty.

He was only an average cultivator at best but in this region, he considered himself to be a top dog. This was understandable due to having an uncle in Dragon Sect. Just the name, Dragon, would intimate everyone.

He indeed had heard some rumors and came to seek out more information, akin to an eagle not giving up after spotting a rabbit.

“My name is Du Weidu, the firstborn of the Du. Nice to meet you, Sect Master.” He bowed towards Li Qiye.

The Du was only nobility in the mortal realm and barely had any reach in the cultivation world. Thus, he should be prostrating, not just bowing.

Li Qiye didn’t mind and nodded in response.

Weiducarefully scanned Li Qiye. He knew about the death of Little Diamond’s previous sect master but didn’t expect the successor to be so young and ordinary.

“I’m here to congratulate…” Du Weiduput on a happy appearance.

“Don’t hold your fart now, state your true intention.” Li Qiye waved his hand dismissively.
