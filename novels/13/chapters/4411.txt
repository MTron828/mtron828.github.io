Chapter 4412: My Son Has The Disposition Of A Dao Lord

The dao lecture was wonderful beyond words, evident by the accompanying visual phenomena and dao harmony.

Peacock Monarch himself praised the king repeatedly, and so did the other ancestors and high elders. The embedded profundities truly benefited the listeners.

It seemed that the myriad laws of the world were summoned during the speech as well. People thought that he was certainly worthy of being one of the five conquerors of Sky Border.

He won the crowd over and made them realize the reason why he became the leader of Eastern Desolace at a young age. The people of his continent believed that he has a high chance of becoming the next dao lord.

Not far from there was Demon Realm Palace. It started changing during the dao lecture as well and issued bright rays.

Whenever he got to a profound part, the rays would intensify. This was truly a magical combination.

Those from Dragon nodded approvingly, realizing that the king’s understanding of the dao has been approved by the palace.

Eventually, he finished yet everyone was still drowning in the mysteries of the dao, unable to calm down.

“Buzz.” Halos expanded from the palace and made it look even more mysterious than before.

“Creak.” The thick and heavy gate slowly opened. Inside was a bright expanse. Crossing it meant entering a different dimension.

All the spectators naturally wanted to rush there. The members of Dragon took a deep breath.

“Fellow Daoist Five-sun, you may come in to learn.” An ancient voice came from the palace.

“He got permission!” The crowd became stirred right away.

Even those from Dragon couldn’t enter the palace but now, it opened its gate for him.

“I apologize for my hasty departure.” Five-sun King nodded and told the crowd. He then flew up and disappeared into the gate.

“Creak…” The gate closed again.

“That’s Five-sun King for you, always an exception to the rule.” One expert said.

“He’s a deity.” A prideful disciple of Dragon admitted.

Few outsiders in the history of Dragon had the privilege of being invited into Demon Realm Palace.

“Let’s not make a big deal out of this. He’s a future dao lord anyway so it makes sense.” One Dragon member said.

“I’m sure he’ll learn something amazing in there.” Another added.

“You’re right, Senior Sister Qingzhu obtained a dao bone, he should get something like a supreme law or dao.” One fan said. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Thus, although the lecture was over, people still stuck around in order to see his harvest.

On another side, people came to congratulate his father who was happily smiling.

“Fellow Daoist, I’m sure Virtuous Nephew will do great in there.” An ancestor from Dragon said.

“Thank you, my son does have the disposition of a dao lord. He will find the last mystery of Demon Realm Palace.” The ex-sect master looked quite pleased with himself.

None could refute this because his son was indeed talented. His comment wasn’t unreasonable since his son was an heir - a true competitor to the future competition.

“Buzz…” The palace exuded halos and phenomena during the king’s visit.

“Screech!” People saw the various divine beasts - phoenix, dragons, kun pengs… There were grand images of the cosmo as well…

The crowd was in awe and had a hard time keeping their eyes open.

“He is learning something special.” One Dragon ancestor said.

“These phenomena exceed the demon god’s back then.” One expert quietly whispered. He was referring to Nine-tailed God.

“Yes, he might be able to learn the last mystery of the palace.” An ancestor from the east added.

“Boom!” Eventually, the gate opened and released wondrous rays again.

People saw Five-sun King walking out. This time around, he was brimming with chaos energy and countless dao laws. It seemed that he had learned a grand do from the primordial.

“I shall be entering isolated cultivation.” He said and took one step forward, disappearing into the horizon in the blink of an eye.

Meanwhile, the crowd stood there in a daze, not expecting him to leave so quickly. They had no idea what he obtained from there.

Nonetheless, they still remembered the visual phenomena earlier.

“Did his grand dao reach the next level? He wants to try and become a dao lord now?” Someone blurted out and made the ones nearby gasp in astonishment.

“No.” One ancestor saw it clearly and shook his head: “But it should be a great harvest. His form looked like the beginning of the grand dao, a shocking state. He must have seen an ancient grand dao in there.”

“Congratulations.” A Dragon Ancestor told the ex-sect master of Five-sun.

The latter returned the gesture and said: “Thank you for your support. Dragon and Five-sun should forge an alliance.”

“No need to be so reserved with our speech, we’re on the same side now.” Peacock Monarch laughed.

“Since you’ve put it that way, Monarch, may I shamelessly suggest an engagement?” The ex-sect master asked with a smile.

“That’s fine, please speak.” Peacock didn’t find this surprising.

“Your sect’s saintess is the jewel of the south, a perfect match for my son. I, in my son’s stead, ask your sect for permission.” The ex-sect master said.

Everyone became startled and stared at Jian Qingzhu.
