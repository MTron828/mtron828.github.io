Colorful Balloons Take Flight

More people have arrived at this moment. Many ancestors knew Moneyfall well enough to reach this place after getting off their beasts. They wanted to test their luck and find some eggs because rumor has it that Elucidation found his Bi’an here.

They quickly noticed this stalemate and became interested, watching from afar.

“A fight, maybe?” The experts saw the numerous ancestors from Coiling Dragon System so they quietly talked.

Everyone knew that Coiling Dragon Young Noble and Sword Sovereign wouldn’t let this go. Finding reinforcement was only a matter of time, so the presence of these ancestors confirmed the start of an inevitable battle.

Myriad-armed was naturally unhappy with Bingning’s aggressive tone. He scowled: “Miss Wu, you are way out of line here.”

The king had the same status as Windchaser and their power level was most likely similar. Thus, Bingning was showing disrespect towards a senior.

“King, I have been plenty reasonable. Otherwise, I would be pushing for you to repay your debt to me!” She pushed on.

Though she wasn’t being overly explicit, the intimidation tone was obvious.

Myriad-armed’s expression changed. He indeed owed her a debt after the alliance became prisoners to Insane Court. Li Qiye wanted to kill them but with the help of Bright Ancestor and Pill Kill, Li Qiye decided to take Wu Bingning as a hostage instead.

It wouldn’t be outrageous to say that all of these ancestors owed her a debt. Plus, it wasn’t flattering for people to know that grown men like them left behind a girl to be a hostage.

Because of this, he didn’t wish to dwell on this topic or they would become the laughingstock of the system.

“Very well.” Myriad-armed replied: “Then I won’t bother you any longer, but you will not be able to stop this matter.”

“Thank you, King.” She plainly responded.

The king retreated to the back, still glaring at Li Qiye. Though he gave up on pursuing Bingning’s matter, he would still maneuver against Li Qiye when an opportunity arises.

As the conversation came to a halt, a flashing edge aimed straight for Li Qiye’s throat.

Ximo couldn’t react in time, unlike Bingning who used her sword to stop the thrust, resulting in sparks splattering everywhere.

The ambusher showed himself - Saber Devil Crown Prince.

The spectators grew startled. Ximo, on the other hand, became intimidated. She tried to block before Li Qiye even more.

She knew that she was unable to stop someone at this level, so she was preparing to use her body as a shield.

“Martial goddess, no one can stop me from reaching my target.” He declared.

“Is that so?” Bingning replied before disappearing from sight.

The crown prince was an ambushing expert so his stealth techniques were flawless. However, he failed to spot her.

“Whoosh!” A matchless ray aimed straight for his chest.

“Buzz.” The crown prince disappeared as well but was forced back into the open by another thrust hitting the space where he hid.

He shuddered and used the same technique. Alas, the formula repeated.

“Die!” Unable to stealth, he decided to let his saber roam free - sealing the entire area.

Bingning was nowhere to be found inside the vicinity of his attack. In this split second, the cold glint of a sword emerged right in front of his throat. He guessed her position and focused on offense instead of defense. Alas, the sword disappeared once more.

This repeated several times before the prince was carelessly struck. The wound was shallow in a non-fatal position, but this was still a great blow to his morale.

She appeared again next to Li Qiye after the successful exchange.

“So fast!” An expert commented.

“Not just fast, her stealth is impeccable too.” One ancestor said. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“World-concealing Grass!” The prince’s expression became unsightly; his stare fixated on her.

He has always taken pride in his ambushing techniques. This allowed him to kill stronger foes. He had heard of stories about her grass of invisibility but didn’t pay it any mind, even holding it in contempt. In his mind, using an external item for stealth was no big deal, until today.

In terms of cultivation, she was not necessarily stronger than him. But with the grass, she definitely had the advantage when it came to subterfuge combat.

“Crown Prince, you’re not the only one well-versed in ambushing techniques in Myriad. The rest of us just don’t care enough.” She verbally attacked, staying true to her title.

“That grass is incredible.” One ancestor murmured.

Everyone knew that Vermillion was famous for its peerless martial arts, needless to say about its successor. However, this made people forget about her particular treasure and her assassination abilities. It was just that she preferred not to use them when possible.

“Not bad.” The prince uttered: “Martial goddess, I’m not here alone, that Li guy won’t be able to escape today!”

With that, another group showed up with murderous intent. The leader was an ancestor holding a saber flashing with a bloody glow. One could faintly hear the stench of blood from a distance as if this saber had reaped numerous victims in the past.

“Blade-reaper True God and so many ancestors from Heavenstart System.” The spectators noted with fear.

The name of this eighth-level True God was Chen Baojiang; his title, Blade-reaper.

This ferocious man massacred numerous enemies during youth, not sparing their clans and families either. The blood of his fallen foes stained the blade of his saber and their indignant spirits lingered there, hence his title.

Plenty of people wanted to kill him for revenge but he came from Heavenstart, a powerful system. Others couldn’t do anything about it.

His arrival today meant that his system was going all out.

“Is it just a coincidence?” Someone murmured.

Coiling Dragon, Sword Grave, and Heaven Start went all in with their ancestors. Everyone felt that it was a premeditated assault on Li Qiye.

“I heard Young Lord Mu had given out an order - bring Li Qiye’s head for a great reward.” A knowledgeable expert quietly revealed.

“I see.” People understood right away.

No wonder why so many ancestors came. So Young Lord Mu had given a prize for Li Qiye’s head. It was no longer about personal grievances.
