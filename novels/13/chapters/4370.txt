Chapter 4371: Courting Death

Little Diamond’s members have been surrounded by sword rays. Though Wang Weiqiao and Elder Hu tried their best, the young ones couldn’t handle the intensity and felt sharp pain as if there were thousands of holes in their body.

“Back!” Wang Weiqiao roared again and swung his hatchet, hoping to make an escape path back to the room. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“You’re not going anywhere.” The disciples from Phoenix Ground easily repelled them.

Thus, they had no choice but to suffer the sword rays again. It was obvious that the enemies weren’t trying to kill them. They couldn’t push it too far or it would be hard to answer Goldbird Monarch.

There were other spectators not far from there. Some were laughing and loudly instigating. A few seniors occasionally came over and observed from a distance without stopping.

In their eyes, these men were as insignificant as worms. The monarch had made an exception to let them come into Phoenix Ground, let alone commanding disciples to serve them.

Therefore, the spectators were pleased to see this and became less annoyed. As for the seniors, it wasn’t a big deal for the juniors to play with them.

What could they do in retaliation? They had no power to speak of. In fact, these big shots wouldn’t even find sect destruction a big deal.

“What are you doing?” Li Qiye walked out and gazed at the battle.

“That’s the sect master of Little Diamond!” Someone shouted and all eyes fell on Li Qiye.

“Really?” Most were surprised and even felt disappointed.

They thought that he would be slightly imposing and dignified. Alas, he looked as average as can be.

“He’s trying to oppose us?” Another snorted with disdain.

“Ignorant fool, he’s not leaving Phoenix Ground alive.” One more uttered coldly.

“He killed the young lord and our members, we need to avenge them.” An older disciple’s eyes turned cold.

Quite a few who knew about the event started shouting unfriendly words. Capturing Li Qiye served two purposes - avenging their fallen brethren and pleasing their sect master.

Most importantly, this should be easy. A sect master like Li Qiye posed no threat.

“You’re Little Diamond Sect Master, Li Qiye, right?” Sky Eagle’s eyes turned brighter as he spoke.

“And?” To which Li Qiye responded.

“Good, then come save your sect members then, show us what you can do but don’t blame me for being merciless if you’re too weak.” Sky Eagle laughed.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The sword rays suddenly intensified and poured down like waterfalls.

“Ahh!” A few youths from Little Diamond bellowed in pain.

Sky Eagle attempted to forcefully humiliate these youths and put Li Qiye in a tough situation.

“Come save them already before it’s too late.” The crowd started shouting.

“Senior Brother Sky Eagle is holding back or they would all be dead already. Let’s see how he’s going to save them.” Another said.

“Senior Brother is a top genius. He might not be on the same level as the lady but few can compare to him. Hmph, that guy can’t even protect himself, let alone his sect members.” An older one added.

“Senior Brother, show him the power of Phoenix Ground!” A spectator roared.

“Senior Brother, teach him a lesson first then take him to Dragon Citadel so that the sect master can deliver judgment! Our young lord and fallen brothers shall be avenged!”

“Death to all transgressors! Take him to the capital, let the sect master deal with him!” The crowd seemed eager to watch Sky Eagle teach Li Qiye a lesson.

Thus, Sky Eagle became lost in the heated atmosphere. His blood boiled as he fantasized about the possibilities.

Though Phoenix Ground was under the Jian’s jurisdiction, both were still beneath Dragon. Contributing Dragon might result in a brighter future than staying in Phoenix Ground.

“How can you watch your fellow members suffer as the sect master?!” He roared.

Little Diamond’s members might be esteemed guests right now but the crowd disagreed. They thought that these nobodies weren’t qualified for the current privileges.

“Seems like someone wants to die a little sooner. Fine, I’ll help out.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Insignificant fool, you have no clue what you’re doing. Know your place!” A crowd member shouted.

“I alone am enough to destroy your ‘Diamond’ sect.” Another glared at Li Qiye.

None of them paid this sect master any respect.

“Since you boasted so shamelessly, let’s see what you can do then. Come out!” Sky Eagle shouted, wanting to use this opportunity to kill Li Qiye.
