Chapter 4906: Missing People

“I do not know, and I don’t think anyone else does. The only person who might have a clue is my grandma. Unfortunately, she is no longer around.” Yunyun shook her head.

Bringing this up made her sad. She respected the empress dowager for being the protector of the Alliance. Alas, she loved Black-dress Lady far more. The empress dowager was more of a legend.

“She’s missing too?” Bloodsea murmured. Another six-fruit dragon lord was missing?

Such a prestigious character rarely just disappeared from thin air. They normally either went into isolated cultivation or still presided over their sect.

“I wonder who else is missing.” Yunyun said.

Bloodsea paused for a moment before adding: “There is another.”

“Who is it?” She asked.

“Zhuo Yijian.” Bloodsea said.

“Sword Lord! Isn’t he in isolated cultivation?” Yunyun was surprised.

She had heard of this person before since he was also from the academy, serving as a protector. He had great mastery over the sword art along with five sacred fruits. Phenomena himself had nothing but praises for his expertise.

When she was there, she heard that he lived in isolation and didn’t want to see guests. However, Bloodsea was a very trustworthy source since they were fellow students during the same period.

Most importantly, he spoke with conviction and surely had gathered evidence.

“Interesting if all of them disappeared at the same time.” Li Qiye smiled.

Bloodsea’s expression became serious while Yunyun was stirred emotionally.

“Hmm, it is a possibility.” Bloodsea said.

“No way.” Yunyun didn’t think so.

All three were top masters in the lower continents. Phenomena had four fruits, the empress dowager had six, and Sword Lord had five.

What in the world could be strong enough to potentially make all three “disappear”?

“If this is indeed the case, things bode ill for them.” Li Qiye said.

“Who is strong enough to do so? Conceal-” Yunyun said before abruptly stopping.

There was no proof and if anyone from Deity were to hear this, she would be punished for spreading false rumors regarding their conqueror.

“It’s not Conceal.” Bloodsea said.

She carefully pondered and agreed. Though Conceal Conqueror had seven dao fruits and enough power to do so, the timeline didn’t match.

She had only obtained the last fruit recently while the trio has been missing for a long time. The exact time of the incident was unknown but Conceal certainly couldn’t be strong enough back then to do so in a secretive manner.

Remember, it was quite a commotion when she ambushed and killed Heavenpeak Conqueror. Everyone found out about it in no time at all.

“I can’t think of anyone.” Yunyun said.

As for Bloodsea, he knew that this was an earth-shattering event. How did no one in the lower continents know about it?

“It’s simple, the assailant is far, far stronger than them and wanted to keep this a secret.” Li Qiye said.

This was Bloodsea’s conclusion as well.

“There’s no one like that in the lower continents.” She shuddered: “Wait, the Ten Mountains!” Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

She thought about the mysterious and most dangerous area belonging to Demon Lineage. They might have the power to capture the trio. Alas, the problem was that this would still result in a conspicuous battle.

“It should be a mighty cultivator that no one knows about, lurking in the shadow.” Li Qiye smiled.

Bloodsea’s eyes flashed brightly and his saber intent surged, fully immobilizing Yunyun.

“It’s someone from above, no?” She speculated.

For example, a conqueror or dao lord with eight dao fruits or a dragon lord with ten sacred fruits. That should be enough to kidnap them.

“The five alliances of the two upper continents won’t let anyone come down without communication or fanfare.” Bloodsea said.

She also agreed. A mighty character from the upper continents should belong to these five factions. They would then report any guests to their subsidiaries below.

“How amusing. I wonder if we will find out.” Li Qiye said.

Bloodsea was sure that something terrifying was going on in the background. He stood up, ready to leave.

“Are you returning to Eight-stallion?” He asked Li Qiye.

Yunyun became nervous again, not wanting him to find out about the kidnapping.

“No point in returning to that shoddy dynasty.” Li Qiye shrugged: “What is your relationship with Eight-stallion Dao Lord?”

“I owe him a favor.” Bloodsea coldly responded.

“I see, he must have saved you from pursuers.” Li Qiye smiled.

Bloodsea didn’t respond.

“A drop of water should be repaid with a gushing spring, let alone a life-saving favor.” Li Qiye understood why Bloodsea tried hard to escort the coffin back to the dynasty.
