Chapter 4263: Pyrrhic Attempt

The crowd exchanged glances. Li Qiye’s defeat wouldn’t have ended with his death. There might have been torture before a cruel demise.

Moreover, those who sided with him would be massacred by the two behemoths as well.

In reality, this was their plan in the first place, hence the need to use the sword formation and halos. They wouldn’t have let anyone leave alive, not even Everlasting Sword God and the two saints. Next, they would mobilize against Sword Temple, Virtuous School, and many others.

Such a thing was not unprecedented in history. They have destroyed plenty of enemies previously.

Therefore, although the two old men looked pitiful in their current state, it wasn’t out of line for Li Qiye to press the issue. Sympathy didn’t cloud the crowd’s judgment.

“Do you intend on destroying my kingdom?!” Vastsea Venerable bellowed.

Listeners shuddered because this was an actual possibility.

“Why not?” Li Qiye said.

The crowd shuddered because Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel have been around for eras. What would be the consequences of their demise? Nonetheless, this might actually happen today because Li Qiye had the ability to do so.

The duo’s expression was as ugly as can be. They naturally didn’t want to see their sect being dragged down as well. Unfortunately, the cards were stacked against them.

“D-don’t be so unreasonable!” The vajra turned red. He was ready to do anything to stop Li Qiye from destroying Nine-wheel.

“On the contrary, I’ve been reasonable the entire time and gave you all plenty of chances. Your stupidity has buried you and your sect.”

“You!” The vajra was too livid to speak.

The crowd thought about it and Li Qiye seemed to have given them multiple chances to back off. Alas, the duo was confident in winning and didn’t yield. One misstep resulted in losing everything. Such was life, they thought.

“Enough talking, time to end this.” Li Qiye said.

The duo was at their wits’ end. What else could they do now outside of trying one more time? Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Li, if you insist on being stubborn, we will take you down with us!” The venerable roared.

“Seems like you won’t cry until you see the coffin.” Li Qiye replied.

“Hahaha, fine, we’ll all die then!” The vajra let out a sorrowful smile.

“Boom!” The true flames of life erupted from him. He activated his palaces and released his true fate, deciding to burn everything.

“Boom!” The venerable did the same and ignited his true fate and longevity blood.

“Ahh!” They screamed in agony; their face contorted due to the pain of being burned alive.

Nonetheless, they endured the unbearable pain and started chanting: “My ancestor, my lord, the source of the dao…”

Each word echoed into the horizon. “Rumble!” Billowing flames suddenly appeared over Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel Citadel. They incinerated the sky and left behind black holes.

The members of the two sects started chanting as well. They have answered the call of their ancient ancestors and ignited the foundation of the sect.

“Fuck!” The heat waves were unbearable for the neutral spectators. Numerous were burned while some were reduced to ashes.

They felt their blood and true fate sizzling, wanting to ignite as well. This scared the hell out of them.

“Why is this happening?!” A youth felt a sharp pain coming from her true fate and screamed.

“They want to perish together with Li Qiye.” Her ancient ancestor shielded her and explained: “Those two overlords are burning their life while chanting a mantra serving to ignite their sect’s foundation as well. This is a spell capable of burning their opponent’s life until death. Unfortunately, they will also turn to ashes. As for their sect, the best-case scenario would be maintaining thirty to forty percent of its power.”

“How scary…” She retreated.

Others weren’t as lucky as her to have a protector. They screamed due to internal pain.

“Seal your senses, don’t try to resist because it’s futile. Two overlords and the foundations are burning.” A king told his fellow disciples.

This advice was heeded. They stopped actively trying to resist and sealed off their senses instead.
