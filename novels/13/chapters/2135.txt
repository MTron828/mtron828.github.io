Being chosen by Li Qiye came too sudden for the rest of the group and Sijing herself. She didn’t know how to handle this pleasant surprise.

“I...I...” She couldn’t finish a complete sentence after a long time.

“Sijing, go pack up and follow the ancestor.” Zhu Qi tried to wake her up from the daze.

She quickly went to get her stuff and returned to Li Qiye’s side.

Zhu Qi warned her again: “Do a good job of serving him, the sect relies on you.”

Having said that, he handed a few precious treasures to her and whispered: “If you run out of money at the court, go pawn them to keep up a good appearance.”

He was quite hopeful about her because if Li Qiye was indeed a founding ancestor, then he would definitely have authority at the court in the future. If she could be highly regarded later by staying with him, then their sect’s future became more promising.

Thus, he went all out and gave some of his most precious items to Sijing. Their sect still needed to maintain a good appearance at the court.

The group was at the entrance right now.

“Ancestor, we are at a remote region with no dao portal, so I especially called for a carriage from Arrogance Enterprise.” Shengping quickly told Li Qiye.

A sect at this level naturally couldn’t have a portal. Even if they could build the platform, they wouldn’t be able to keep up with the cost.

“Ahem.” A sound came from a carriage instantly appearing in front of them.

“Gentleman, you called for a ride?” An old man asked with a pair of radiant eyes, clearly an expert.

Eight dragon-horses were pulling this old yet stately carriage. Normally, Yang Shengping would be too frugal to call for something like this but he decided to spend big just for Li Qiye.

“Ancestor, please.” He told Li Qiye.

The guy didn’t board right away for he was looking at the insignia on the carriage. It wasn’t that big - in the shape of an axe or an ingot decoration on a piece of earing. Below carved the word, Arrogance.

Shengping was quite nervous, afraid that Li Qiye was thinking that the carriage and the reception party weren’t extravagant enough.

Alas, how could Shengping go all out? Li Qiye’s identity wasn’t confirmed so they couldn’t go to the court with great fanfare. He finally heaved a sigh of relief after seeing the guy getting on the carriage.

“Gentlemen, we’ll be at the royal court in three days!” The driver shouted and set off.

The carriage sped towards the horizon with lightning speed, far exceeding the traveling speed of a True Champion like Shengping. This made it worth the high price.

Li Qiye looked at the flying dragon-horses and smile: “Arrogance, huh? A bit interesting.”

“Ancestor, you may not know this but this is the best carriage in Three Immortals. As long as one can pay up, they can go anywhere with these carriages, even to the Immortal and Imperial World. This is probably the only company with this capability.” [1]

“Sounds quite capable.” Li Qiye smiled. In Three Immortals, one wouldn’t be able to cross through the dao systems if they weren’t connected. However, Arrogance Enterprise could go anywhere. One could easily imagine how mighty they were.

“It’s the richest lineage in Three Immortals, but it’s not quite a dao system, only a business entity of sorts. These carriages are a very small part of it.” Shengping added.

“The enterprise is new, right?” Li Qiye smiled, understanding what was going on.

“Right, it is much younger compared to many dao lineages in Three Immortals.” Shengping said: “Approximately 1,000,000,000 years ago, a youth around twelve or thirteen years old made a bold declaration - to be the richest in the world. In the beginning, everyone thought that he was joking, an ignorant calf. However, no one expected for him to actually succeed and create the biggest enterprise in Three Immortals, connecting all the locations. This allowed him to have stores in any dao system.” [2]

Shengping was excited talking about this because there were many legends about Arrogance Enterprise, more than enough to compile a book.

“There is a saying in Three Immortals, only buyers lack money; Arrogance never lacks merchandises. As long as you can pay the price, they can satisfy all the demands. Even a few treasures from Immortal Lineage could be bought!” He continued on.

After hearing this, Li Qiye smiled and asked the driver: “Your enterprise has everything for sale?”

“Sir, as long as you can pay the price, we can get you anything. That saying is completely accurate.” The driver proudly declared.

“That’s great to hear.” Li Qiye smirked: “Then, tell your shop that I want to buy a True Immortal. Money isn’t a problem, I don’t lack money, only a True Immortal!”

“Uh...” The driver choked up after hearing this, not knowing how to respond despite being a seasoned professional. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

Shengping was surprised too. Where was one going to buy a True Immortal in this world? These were mythical existences that have never been seen before.

“You’re quite funny.” The driver coughed. They indeed didn’t know where to find one if Li Qiye could muster up the payment.

“I’m not joking at all.” Li Qiye calmly said: “Tell your boss that I want to buy one, money is no problem! I’ll be waiting at Insane Court.”

His expression seemed quite serious so the driver became silent.

Normally, the driver would assume that only a madman would boast about having enough money to buy something non-existent. The problem was that Li Qiye didn’t look like one at all.

Shengping didn’t say anything either, sharing the same sentiment as the driver. Alas, this guy was supposedly their ancestor and shouldn’t be crazy. He didn’t feel like Li Qiye was messing with Arrogance Enterprise either. Not many would dare to do something like this, knowing the power of this particular group.

The carriage continued swiftly across the sky as Li Qiye basked in the sceneries below.

Appearance wise, the geography beneath wasn’t that different from the nine and tenth worlds. Yet, at a certain power level, one would feel that each inch of this blessed land was filled with the power of the dao.

The entire system was refined by Insane Ancestor. The land had become a boundary for the dao origin. After numerous years of accumulation, the land remained incredible despite its swift decline.

“Imagine back then, this dao system was like the stars in the sky, spanning on and on endlessly. Now, only this little world is left.” Li Qiye looked at the boundaries and said.

Shengping felt sentimental. He had never seen the land when it was at the immortal level but he had heard about how unfathomably large it was. Alas, it was only a Myriad Lineage right now.

1. I don’t know who said this, probably Shengping

2. 1,000 + 100 + 10,000. I just added up the zeroes. It’s so hard because sometimes, the author just throw out these random numbers to mean a long time ago. I’m not sure whether it is exact or not, but one billion it is. The regular usage for one billion
