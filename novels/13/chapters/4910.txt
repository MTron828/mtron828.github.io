Chapter 4911: The Academy

“Lil Bro, we’re at your destination.” After some time, A’jiao jumped off the carriage and told Li Qiye.

Li Qiye climbed down and so did Jian Yunyun.

“When will we meet again?” A’jiao stared at him with her moist eyes, seemingly going to miss him.

Alas, she only tried to paint this image. In reality, they flared out and looked rather scary like a lion ready to devour its prey. Yunyun didn’t dare to keep on looking.

“It’s best to never meet again.” Li Qiye waved dismissively.

“Don’t be so mean, when?” She insisted.

“I don’t want to see you again.” He didn’t hold back.

“Even if you don’t want to meet me, you’ll have to return to the village eventually. We’ll see each other again unless you never return.” She said.

“Whatever.” He knew she was right.

“I’ll eagerly await your return.” She seemed happy afterward and put on a wide smile, showing all her teeth.

“Whoosh!” She got up the carriage and it sped away, disappearing with an unreal speed.

“Who was that?” Yunyun was awfully curious.

According to their conversation, A’jiao could have been Li Qiye’s fiancee. She had searched for him for a long time now - truly something romantic. Of course, this didn’t seem to be the case.

“Just a passerby, the same as me.” Li Qiye said.

It was clear to her that he didn’t wish to answer so she stopped inquiring.

She looked around and saw that they have been brought to the highest peak outside the academy, granting them a full view of the region.

“The academy is right ahead.” She said.

Li Qiye closed his eyes and took a deep breath: “The academy, what an ancient existence.”

It survived the test of time in the lower three continents, still maintaining a strong influence. Though Deity was considered the strongest currently, there were periods of total declination. For example, it had been destroyed by Luminous Conqueror before. 

The current one was rebuilt by Heaven Alliance and Divine Alliance from the upper continents. The same couldn’t be said for the academy.

It had never been destroyed and only became stronger as time passed. Numerous top masters have studied here previously.

It was considered the leader of Hundred Races. However, it maintained its focus on academics instead of trying to be a sect.

It accepted students of all races and backgrounds, never discriminating. This earned it the respect of virtually all cultivators.

Some believed that it had numerous hidden dragons and crouching tigers. Any random teacher was a sovereign or dragon lord. In fact, the number of teachers and ancient ancestors was unknown to the public.

The most popular topic among the student body was none other than the conflict between their school and Celestial Court.

After the immemorial epoch war, peace returned to the six continents. Years later, Celestial Court thought that the academy had produced too many experts for The People. Thus, they commanded the academy to surrender and only train those from The Race.

Celestial Court sent three emperors and monarchs to attack the academy. Alas, none of them managed to get past the gate.

It then sent five more and finally pushed through the initial defense. When everyone thought that it was over for the academy, a terrifying aura erupted along with a massive palm. It crushed five emperors in the blink of an eye while three managed to escape.

From then on, Celestial Court never provoked the academy again, let alone talked about taking over. This firmly established the academy as the leader of Hundred Races. It gained more students afterward. Some chose to stay for life.

Being in Chaos didn’t matter at all. No villains ever tried to be haughty near the academy.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Li Qiye and Jian Yunyun saw a magnificent land capable of accommodating thousands of sects. However, the academy was the only power here.

Smoke could be seen from the stoves in the villages. Farther away was an old city, looking to be a place for mortals.

Cultivators were seen above - flying or riding their special accommodation - mounts, ships, and carriages…

“That’s Book City.” She pointed at the city packed with buildings and pavilions.

“It is one of the largest cities in Chaos. Students like to stay there, and the same for other sects. They usually have a foothold already.” She elaborated.

“What a lively city.” He said.

“Right, merchants and cultivators come here to trade.” She said: “That’s the border. Once we’re in there, we’re officially inside the academy.”

That direction had a beautiful mountain range with towering peaks and lush trees. Bottomless valleys and heavenly waterfalls could be spotted…

It was filled with life, evident by the cries and roars of birds and beasts. It looked like a pristine world.

At the base of a particular peak, divine light suddenly flashed as if a treasure was appearing. In another gully, a clam breathed worldly essences into its pearl, on the verge of becoming a demon. Far over yonder consisted of pavilions and radiant libraries. 

“Those are the main divisions. It is divided into Hundred Halls and Study Hall. Hundred Halls will accept anyone. When they are satisfied with their learnings, they will leave. As for Study Hall, it consists of students who want to stay at the academy in order to become disciples or teachers, maybe even ancestors in the future.”
