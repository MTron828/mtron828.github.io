“Princess Zhou!” Someone recognized her right away.

“A princess of Cloudcrossing System.” She attracted many gazes.

She wore a tassel dress with a red shade of the evening, seemingly no different from a fairy floating amidst the clouds. The gem on her forehead made her even more conspicuous and beautiful beyond words. The youths here fell in love with her right away.

Zhao Xiaoai was also a famous talent, not as acclaimed as the martial goddess, but she had no lack of suitors in Myriad.

“The princess is siding with Young Lord Mu.” Some were surprised.

“Don’t you know?” A knowledgeable expert revealed: “This princess is already the young lord’s woman, long, long ago. He was a guest at their system.”

“I thought he wanted to marry the martial goddess?”

The potential marriage alliance between the Mu and the martial court was no secret.

“It’s normal for a man to have multiple wives, plus, someone of his status has no lack of women. So many princesses and noble daughters want to be with him.” The man continued: “It’s just that the martial court is a better system than Cloudcrossing and wants their successor to be the first wife.”

“That’s the young lord for you.” People became jealous.

So many youths became smitten with the martial goddess and Cloudcrossing Princess at first sight but this guy was about to marry both of them.

The princess’ announcement caused quite a stir due to the power of her system.

Nevertheless, many others chose to watch on the sideline. The princess was still a junior with weak influence in the grand scheme of things.

“Screech!” Suddenly, the cry of a falcon was heard.

People shuddered in response. The fish and birds became paralyzed.

“The heretics are back to haunt Myriad, so how can I ignore this! Everyone has the responsibility to get rid of evil, Cloudcrossing System will do our part, hoping that everyone else will join in!” An ancient voice resounded.

The tone was illusory yet clear, erupting in the mind of all and lingered.

The sky turned dark due to a massive falcon flying above. It possessed an incredible divinity, red eyes, and golden claws. Its two wings blotted out the sun along with an aggressive aura.

“A divine falcon!” Someone shouted.

“Cloudcrossing Falcon God!” Some knew who it was right away after seeing this bird.

“He’s an Eternal. Wow, a being of this level is actually here?” An ancestor took a deep breath.

“Looks like this won’t be simple.” Astonishment pervaded the crowd since an Eternal was virtually unbeatable.

“Cloudcrossing is really going all out to support Young Lord Mu.” People realized that the princess’ announcement wasn’t a personal choice.

The news of Cloudcrossing choosing to support the young lord went beyond Moneyfall. All of Myriad soon learned about it.

Though many other systems still had Eternals left for protection instead of ascending to Imperial, these characters wouldn’t come out so easily due to the adverse effect on their lifespan.

The majority of them used worldly essences and treasures to seal themselves, bidding for more time so they can protect their systems even longer.

Thus, the falcon god’s appearance was quite shocking.

“He must really value the young lord.” One ancestor murmured.

This system had no feud against Li Qiye since they had no prior conflict. But now, the first to side with the young lord wasn’t Vermillion or Coiling Dragon, the systems that had fought against Li Qiye in the past.

“Everyone should join in so that Myriad can enjoy the sunlight.” The falcon god spoke again. This time around, his voice echoed across Moneyfall. It seemed that he himself had made it here.

A divide appeared. People started wondering whether they should join him or just watch on the sideline. Most systems had no problem with Li Qiye.

“Down with the evil heretics.” An ancestor from Coiling Dragon in Moneyfall announced: “Coiling Dragon will never rest when the heretical sects are still around.”

People took a deep breath. Back then, the alliance had signed a truce with Insane Court. Now, Coiling Dragon was declaring war.

“Sword Grave will never rest when the heretical sects are still around!” A member of Sword Grave chimed in.

A third power appeared; an ancestor from Heavenstart declared: “Heavenstart will not allow the heretics to rampage in Myriad!”

This wasn’t too surprising because Li Qiye had killed so many ancestors from these three systems.

“The disruptor of peace must be annihilated.” A calm voice was next.

The tone was one of justice and gentleness yet still piercing across the entire world.

“Dracoform Martial God!” The older experts recognized this voice and gasped in response.

Other Eternals trembled after hearing this title. The number one of Myriad truly threatened everyone.

“Can Li Qiye survive this?” A high elder wondered.

Nevertheless, this was within expectations. Li Qiye had defeated Windchaser Matron on top of kidnapping their successor. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

Dracoform had numerous reasons, whether it be personal or business, to take care of Li Qiye.

Suddenly, some systems that had no feud with Li Qiye declared war towards him. A member of Pureyang System declared: “Everyone is responsible for getting rid of evil, count us in.”

“Us too!” The hesitating ones earlier finally made up their mind after Dracoform showed up, wishing to put an end to Fiercest.
