Chapter 5149: Can We Skip The Line?

“We’re here because we respect the conqueror, you’re not the only one who has heard of her reputation.” An expert said.

They heard about how she was a lady working at the tea shop. Her disciples also trained here, hence the irresistible mystique.

“I knew about her first, will I get special treatment?” An older cultivator remarked sarcastically.

“Hey, I even met her before, let me skip the line.” A dragon lord joked.

“Enough, the line exists for a reason.” One big shot became annoyed.

The young lady chuckled after hearing Landu and shook her head: “I’m afraid you will have to stand in line even if you know our…”

She suddenly stopped with her mouth wide open. She saw a woman with a longlasting beauty. Her aura resembled that of the falling rain and refreshed the crowd.

Everyone could’t help but glance up at the sky and the everfalling rain. She felt as if the woman shared the same aura as the town itself, that the rain was falling for her sake.

“Conqueror!” The young lady regained her wits and kneeled to the ground.

“Harkrain Conqueror!” Those waiting in line were surprised and bowed in her direction.

Most of them never had the chance to see a conqueror, let alone being so close to one.

Harkrain came to the front of Jun Landu and Li Qiye and bowed deeply: “Young Noble, Lord Landu, I did not know of your visit. I apologize for the lack of reception.”

This left everyone slack-jawed since they laughed at Jun Landu for saying that he knew the conqueror.

Now, she actually came before them and showed respect - something reserved for a selected few in the entire world.

The young lady working at the pavilion still couldn’t believe it and broke out in cold sweat. Dragon lords stared at the two and had no idea who they were.

“He wants to experience the tea at Night-rain Pavilion after hearing about how amazing it is.” Landu smiled and said.

“I have not worked for a long time now but if you don’t mind, I can make the tea for you.” The conqueror suggested and stunned the crowd again.

Everyone knew that she was once a worker at the pavilion but that was during her youth. After becoming a conqueror, she spent her time traveling around the world and was rarely seen back in the sect.

She had never made tea for the public before. Plus, who would dare to accept this honor from a four-fruit conqueror?

While they were still thinking about this matter, Li Qiye and Landu have entered the pavilion without waiting in line.

“Who are they?” Someone quietly asked: “These is some special privileges.”

“Let me see who are qualified, Supreme, All-things Dao Lord, Immortal Pagoda Conqueror…” A big shot murmured.

“That’s not them, I’ve seen Supreme before.” A dragon lord shook his head. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

These beings were intimidatingly dignified while Li Qiye and Jun Landu appeared ordinary.

“I don’t think she would do it even for them. I don’t get it.” A wise cultivator said.

No one disagreed with this. Although these beings stood at the top of their continent, Harkrain was still a conqueror. They were of the same status; only their strength varied.

“I can’t come up with anyone. Who are they?” Someone asked the young lady from Night-rain.

She looked at her fellow disciples and none of them had any idea. This was their first time seeing the duo as well.

“They are clearly influential figures, why don’t we know them?” Another wondered.

Li Qiye and Jun Landu sat by the window and looked outside. Rain drizzled down the smoky mountains and roaring rivers - a scene often found in paintings.

“Welcome to Night-rain Pavilion.” Jun Landu said with a smile.

“I apologize for the rowdiness outside earlier, Young Noble.” Harkrain said.

“It’s fine, I’m satisfied with this view and a cup of tea.” Li Qiye answered.

“Did you hear that?” Landu said.

Harkrain bowed and said humbly: “I hope to not disappoint you, Young Noble. My meager skill can’t compare to the noodle shop.”

“Uncle Xiao Zhi’s skill is superb but your pavilion’s art is on the same level.” Landu said.

If anyone else were here, they would find it amazing that these two were commenting on her skill instead of just basking in the moment.

“I will try my best.” Harkrain nodded and told younger disciples to bring up the required utensils.
