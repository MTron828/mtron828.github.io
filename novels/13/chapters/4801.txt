Chapter 4802: Devil Nightsmoke

This wasn’t a case of an eternal being sacrificing a lineage he created long ago and had no attachments with.

In Three Thousand Dao, the individual sects were all related to Dao Sanqian since they were started by his direct disciples or family members and their descendants.

Some ancient ancestors have been with Dao Sanqian for eras. These relationships were tangible, not distant. Alas, he still chose to sacrifice all of them.

The victims suffered an immense psychological betrayal. They worshipped and trusted their supreme progenitor the most, having prospered under his protection. Now, this man suddenly wanted to offer them and all of their loved ones for the sake of a ceremony.

The crowd members shuddered and had cold sweat all over. They thought about their own situation and whether their strongest ancient ancestors might do the same to them in the future.

“The path of the dao is emotionless.” An ancient existence said, albeit still didn’t have the heart to replicate this task.

“This is pure evil.” A high ancestor from an ancient clan said: “It goes beyond lacking emotion or attachment.”

The mightiest ancient ancestors despised Dao Sanqian for doing this since they had love for their sects and descendants.

This was the reason why they always stood up for fellow sect members despite the juniors not always being in the right. Tales of vengeance and revenge stemmed from this emotional attachment.

“Activate!” Enveloping used his Golden Cycle of Death to survive the attacks from the three avatars.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

He bypassed them and reached the true body.

“Heaven Destroyer!” He vomited blood and pieces of his internal organ despite using his ultimate defensive technique. His only focus was killing Dao Sanqian in order to stop the ceremony.

He gathered all of his power, vitality, and true blood to deliver the best offensive result. It created a black hole around Dao Sanqian, crushing everything within.

“What a virtuous man, he’s not even from Three Thousand Dao.” Some spectators were moved to tears from seeing Enveloping’s love for the sect.

The progenitor wanted to sacrifice his lineage while Enveloping tried to do the opposite - a contrast between evil and justice.

Enveloping could have ignored this since he was an outsider. The destruction of Three Thousand Dao didn’t have anything to do with him.

People stared at his battered body with nothing but reverence.

“Zzz…” Dao Sanqian stopped the powerful thrust and swung his hand, releasing black smoke of a nefarious nature.

The black smoke somehow managed to corrode the entire defensive halo of the monarch.

“Devil Nightsmoke!” Enveloping couldn’t believe this and shouted: “You spent all these years collecting my weakness?!”

The Golden Cycle of Death always shielded him from death. However, it did have a weakness - this particular evil smoke capable of corroding it. Nonetheless, it was extremely rare and required eras of accumulation.

Since they were best friends, he had mentioned this to Dao Sanqian before. He never expected that his most-trusted friend has been collecting this through the eras in order to kill him.

“Brother, may we meet again in the next life.” Dao Sanqian sighed and said.

“Boom!” The three avatars crushed what was left of the halo and struck the monarch directly.

“Ahh!” The latter body was pierced in three different places. His eyes were wide open as he took his last breath.

The crowd shuddered after witnessing his death. The two’s friendship has been praised as the defining example of brotherhood. Now, it ended with betrayal and death.

Dao Sanqian must have been gathering the smoke right after gaining this knowledge. There was no honor here.

Enveloping was ready to die to help him fight Li Qiye only to be rewarded with an indignant end.
