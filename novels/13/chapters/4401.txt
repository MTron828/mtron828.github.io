Chapter 4402: Phoenix’s Innate Gift

This battle had more significance than just deciding the number one genius of Dragon. Jian Qingzhu seemingly obtained a phoenix bloodline - something with unmatched potential.

If she could cultivate this bloodline to the apex, she could absolutely become a demon god.

This made many think about the strongest existence of Dragon - Nine-tailed god.

For many eras now since his appearance, Dragon hasn’t produced a similar being. Even if Jian Qingzhu wasn’t going to become a dao lord, it still didn’t diminish her importance to Dragon. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

Moreover, Nine-tailed God was missing as well. Who knows if he was still alive?

If Qingzhu could become a demon god in the future, she would be able to fill the vacancy and make Dragon stronger.

Thus, although many of them criticized her action before, they didn’t dare to say anything now. Even the top demon seniors couldn’t speak up.

“If her bloodline is truly phoenix, what will happen once it reaches grand completion?” An outsider asked.

“Isn’t that what Sacred Luan had? His bloodline evolved and reached the phoenix level, I’m not quite sure on the grand completion part.” An ancestor responded.

Sacred Luan was the Jian’s peerless ancestor who was competitive against the dao lords despite not being one. The Jian rose under his leadership and gained an everlasting foundation. It became the strongest clan in Dragon and was in control for a long period of time.

In the present, it still had an influential position on top of being in control of Phoenix Ground. This was mainly due to Sacred Luan’s legacy.

One thing to note was that his bloodline evolution came after a lifetime of effort. As for Jian Qingzhu, she had gained it during her youth. Thus, it wouldn’t be impossible for her to surpass the ancestor.

The rivalry between Dragon and Lion’s Roar was no secret. However, most thought that Dragon was still missing something. The appearance of a new demon god might shorten the gap.

“Dragon has to keep a disciple like her around.” A high elder from another clan said softly.

In reality, the demon experts felt the same way about Jian Qingzhu.

In everyone’s opinion, unless she has committed an unforgivable sin, they should do everything to salvage the situation. A future demon god could take Dragon to the next height.

As for Jian Qingzhu, she and Li Qiye entered the village since no one else tried to stop them.

As the crowd thinned out, she bowed deeply and said: “Young Noble, my life is yours. I would jump into a boiling cauldron if you wish me to.”

The gift was truly priceless and changed her fate entirely, hence her deep gratitude. Most importantly, she had enough sense to understand the implication - Li Qiye was able to casually give away this fate-changing opportunity.

The crowd assumed that she was close to an evolution already. They didn’t get to witness the internal process at all.

However, she knew exactly what happened inside her body. His gift was something their clan pursued for eras now. Only one ancestor was successful - Sacred Luan.

His ability to do so was more astonishing than the incredible gift itself.

“My gift is one thing but how far you go is up to you.” Li Qiye said: “No one else can help you on this path.”

“I understand, I will train without complacency and bring this bloodline to grand completion.” She said respectfully.

“If that’s all you’ll do, it’s rather unambitious.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“...” She was surprised to hear this and asked: “Could you elaborate, Young Noble?”

From her point of view, becoming a great demon similar to her ancestor was amazing enough. In the past, she was a top genius of Dragon but her talent wasn’t considered supreme. She didn’t have a chance of becoming a demon god.

There have been plenty of geniuses like her in the long history of Dragon. However, with her new bloodline, becoming a demon god wasn’t particularly difficult. This made her a supreme genius, not an ordinary one.

Thus, her next goal was to perfect this bloodline and become an apex existence. Strangely enough, this didn’t seem to be enough for Li Qiye.

“What did I give you?” Li Qiye stared at her.

She answered right away: “You gave me a bloodline evolution, from an azure luan to a phoenix bloodline.”

“The bloodline evolution is supplementary.” He smiled: “For example, learning the arts and techniques of Buddhism is supplementary to Buddhist cultivation, merely byproducts of the process.”

“Only a byproduct?” She became stunned again. The bloodline evolution would probably be her crowning achievement - the defining legacy of her life.

Now, it was only a byproduct in his opinion?

“You-young Noble, what did you gift me then? Please excuse my foolishness and guide me.” She broke out in cold sweat since she found her assessment to be inaccurate. She didn’t understand the true meaning of the gift.

“What I gave you is the innate gift of the phoenix.” He explained.

“What would that be, I have never heard of it before, Young Noble.” She inquired again.

“It’s not your fault, the world has never seen a phoenix before, let alone knowing more about it.” He chuckled.
