This woman was sexy enough to sway the mind. Spectators kept stealing glances at her; some started drooling unwittingly.

Jianyao was also a peerless beauty but in a completely different manner. She was a serene, ink-wash painting with few, exquisite strokes - so remote and transcending; exceptional like a lotus flower deep in the valley - visually incredible.

On the other hand, this woman was a colorful oil painting, seemingly done by a splashing style - very eye-catching and gorgeous.

One would instantly admire and adore Qin Jianyao, treating her as a goddess in their mind.

As for the other woman, they would be tempted into taking her as their own for she was insanely seductive.

“Princess Hanyu, your presence honors our party.” Qin Jianyao personally came to greet the woman.

“That’s Princess Hanyu of the Bingchi?” People still stared greedily, not wanting to avert their eyes.

Evil and possessive desires stemming from Hanyu’s sexiness permeated the area but no one dared to act on it.

Remember, she was the golden daughter of the Bingchi; her power far exceeded Bingchi Yingjian on top of having incredible weapons. Her fury could take down the gods, so who would want to provoke her?

Moreover, she was Eight Formation True Emperor’s fiancee at the moment. Having thoughts about her was the same as courting death. There would be no place to go in Nine Secrets after provoking them.

“I’ve only recently arrived and heard that you were having a party, so I’m here to take a look.” Hanyu revealed a smile like a blossoming rose, causing others to gulp.

Jianyao and Hanyu were acquaintances so they were relatively familiar with each other. Tang Hexiang and Ma Jinming came over as well. Needless to say about Yang Bofan, he greeted her while assuming the role of a junior despite not being that much younger.

However, the Bingchi and Myriad Formation were allies now so she would become his mistress in the future.

“How is Tianzhi doing?” Hanyu asked.

Tianzi was Eight Formation True Emperor’s real name. It was fine for her to address him as such.

“Thank you for asking, Your Highness, Master is doing well. He is in isolated cultivation to study the Immortal Slaying Ancient Formation.” Bofan answered earnestly.

“His talents are far above mine. I’m sure that when he comes out, he’ll have full comprehension of the formation.” Hanyu nodded and said.

Though the marriage was decided by her clan’s ancestors, she actually had no problem with it and was quite satisfied.

After all, the two powers were evenly matched and the emperor had great achievements. They have met each other before and she had a good impression of him. The proposal went smoothly and she would become the queen of Myriad Formation Kingdom in the future.

This was different from her last marriage proposal. The king was a useless idler so she strongly opposed it.

Unfortunately, Lucidity was still around so her opposition didn’t amount to anything.

After the crown prince became the new king, Hanyu still felt the same way. Though marrying into the imperial palace was an honor, she thought that the pervert wasn’t worthy of her. It was nauseating just thinking about that piece of trash. Thus, their clan decided to replace her with a fallen princess, Bingchi Yingjian.

“I’m certain of it too.” Bofan replied.

Hanyu continued: “He will shock the world and I believe the time is near. I shall prepare for his coming to Nine-linked Mountains.”

The spectators nearby couldn’t calm their heart rate, feeling lust, envy, and jealousy. Unfortunately, this beautiful woman wasn’t meant for them.

She seemed to be virtuous as well, already thinking for the emperor before the official marriage.

“Since you’re here already, why not have a seat?” Jianyao invited.

“Thank you, Fairy Qin, but Tianzhi should be coming soon and I need to make preparations, unable to hang around. Here, a toast to everyone, may this party never ends until everyone is satisfied.” Hanyu raised her cup for a toast before drinking it in full.

When the corner of her lips was moistened by the wine, she looked even more seductive.

“A toast to you too, Your Highness, and the True Emperor.” Everyone else quickly returned the gesture. Many emptied their cup while still having thoughts about the beautiful and classy woman.

“This place looks so fun, seems like I’ve been missing out.” Suddenly, a leisure voice interrupted the heightened atmosphere.

Everyone turned around to look at the newcomer. They saw Li Qiye slowly entering the stone forest with Liu Chuqing holding his arm like a shy wife.

“It’s him!” The crowd glanced at each other in astonishment.

The ones here have seen him before so they recognized him. Nevertheless, they had no idea why he came.

After all, he wasn’t invited. Was he here to cause trouble?

Qin Jianyao’s brows raised ever so slightly. She had a strange feeling but couldn’t quite explain it.

Ma Jinming’s expression darkened. He scowled and coldly uttered: “Li, why are you here uninvited? You’re not qualified to join this party!” 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“I have no need of joining such a crappy party.” Li Qiye didn’t bother looking at him and went forward towards the throne.

“Who is that?” Hanyu has never seen Li Qiye before.

“Your Highness, that’s the king.” Yang Bofan quietly said.

Hanyu grimaced and took a look at Li Qiye. Her expression became one of distaste. She had heard of his ridiculousness before. After losing his kingdom, this guy still didn’t know how to keep a low-profile. What an ignorant fool.

Li Qiye stood on the steps and stared at the raised platform, not caring about anyone else.

“May, may I ask what you are here for, Sir?” Jianyao had stopped calling him “His Majesty” but she felt that “Young Noble Li” wasn’t appropriate either.

“Do I need to report to you before coming here? The world is beneath my feet and I shall go wherever I want.” Li Qiye didn’t look at her either.

Jianyao knew that she wasn’t liked so she backed off to the side, no longer speaking.

“How arrogant!” Tang Hexiang snorted. He liked Jianyao and if Calm Lotus were to support him, Jianyao might be his queen in the future.

Moreover, after obtaining the throne, he must eliminate this person.

“This world is no longer yours.” Hexiang coldly uttered.

Li Qiye finally turned back and lazily stared at Hexiang: “Aren’t you General Tang? If it’s not mine, don’t tell me it is yours?”

“The world belongs to the people, let the virtuous...” Hexiang replied.

“Okay, no need to be a scholar.” Li Qiye waved his sleeve: “Just say it if you want to become the king. You’re only now daring to speak before me with a straight back. When I was on the throne, you kneeled in the golden hall, trembling with fear, not even daring to fart. Just one order of mine and your head would have rolled on the floor. Now, you dare to act haughty?”

“You!” Hexiang turned red and couldn’t retort.

He was indeed there during the coronation. However, Silver Secret Legion occupied the capital along with Sun Lengying. Though the new king’s prestige couldn’t compare to Lucidity, he was still above the rest.

Who would dare to betray him then? Not to mention the six legions, even the five supreme ancestors obediently participated in the ceremony.

The king was indeed standing at the apex of authority at that point. The Northern General, the commander of a legion, opposed the king during the ceremony and his head instantly rolled on the ground.

He was one of the seven commanders yet the king could still order his death before even stabilizing his reign.

As the commander of the Imperial Guards, Tang Hexiang had great authority but he could only kneel in the golden hall. Like Li Qiye had said, he didn’t dare to utter a single word then.

Now, his name was known across the world as an imperial candidate. Being taunted by Li Qiye before the geniuses left him in a difficult state.

“This is no longer the past.” Hanyu jumped in and saved him while staring insipidly at Li Qiye: “This kingdom is no longer yours. Be smart and keep a low-profile, doing so will save your life.”
