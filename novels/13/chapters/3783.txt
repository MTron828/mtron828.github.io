Chapter 3784: To The Target

Various emotions filled the heart of the holy ground’s members. Golden Cicada Buddhist Child thoroughly showed his worth and abilities.

Though he lost, he gained honor in the process instead of criticism. His power was as clear as day. Not to mention the young generation, even some powerful ancestors felt inferior.

Alas, he still lost in the end because the scion was insanely strong.

“I enjoyed the battle, World Crossing is unique indeed, truly worthy of admiration.” The scion happily smiled in great spirits.

This compliment showed ample respect to both Golden Cicada and World Crossing. He mentioned nothing about the seven chapters being stronger.

“You’re unbeatable, I merely took advantage of the land.” Golden Cicada reflected.

“Don’t be humble now, World Crossing is peerless. The problem is your cultivation. If we were in the same realm, I wouldn’t have fared so well even if you didn’t have the empowerment of the land.”

His frankness earned him some respect as well, even from those who didn’t like him. He was both capable and straightforward.

His attitude during the challenge to the holy ground was overbearing but all in all, it matched his power.

“Amitabha, I’ll be leaving now.” Golden Cicada chanted before smiling: “Gonna go home and make some beef stew.”

He salivated just thinking about the dish and had to wipe it off his mouth. He waved his sleeve and left coolly.

The audience exchanged glances after seeing his departure. Earlier, he became a star due to his holiness despite his age, looking just like an enlightened monk.

Now, he returned to his original form - a happy-go-lucky monk with a love for food, not caring about worldly conventions.

This was akin to a divine emperor falling off his throne, becoming a beggar later on. The stark contrast caught the crowd off guard again.

Some realized that the monk has always been the same. He didn’t change in the slightest; only their perception of him had.

“The untethered freedom.” One ancestor commented: “That’s the favorite disciple of the Monk of Wisdom, the successor of Heavenly Dragon Temple. His future will be glorious.”

The scion didn’t linger around after the departure of his foe. He stared towards the direction of Minor Sacred Mountain and laughed: “What an interesting trip so far, I hope the battle with Fairy Dugu will be just as outstanding.”

With that, he got back on his chariot and continued on his trip.

“He’s going towards Minor Sacred Mountain now.” Everyone knew his goal - the destination where Dugu Lan was waiting.

“This will be the final battle, no one else can stop him.” One expert said.

The group started thinking and sure enough, they couldn’t come up with another cultivator capable of stopping the scion.

Hu Ben and Golden Cicada have lost. The latter was rather impressive but still came up short. There was no other genius in the holy ground outside of Dugu Lan.

“What about Phantom Sacred Child?” Someone thought about the pride of the Divine Ghost Division.

“Phantom is strong but I don’t think he’s above Golden Cicada Buddhist Child in his empowered state. That’s not enough to stop Righteous Scion.” An expert mused.

“I heard he tried to borrow an invincible weapon, I wonder if he got it or not.” One youth wondered.

“He did but it isn’t enough. He should team up with Fairy Dugu instead. That’s the only way to have any hope.” Someone knowledgeable from the previous generation nodded. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“Will Fairy Dugu keep up with the scion?” Another questioned to which no one had a response.

Of course, they hoped that she would win or at least tie. However, judging by the circumstances, Righteous Scion was absolutely untouchable among the young generation. Dugu Lan was no exception.

This was a particularly cruel truth for the young members of the holy ground. Their land had waves of talents and hidden experts. Unfortunately, none could stand up to the scion - something quite unbearable and embarrassing.

“I think Fairy Dugu can do it. A teacher told me that she has managed to learn a supreme sword dao by herself.” An alumnus from Duality revealed: “It’s an ancient sword dao rumored to be connected to a peerless existence in history.”

“A peerless existence?” One cultivator remained skeptical: “No matter how peerless this existence is, the merit laws and sword dao stemming from this person can’t compare to a heavenly scripture.”

“Hard to say. Remember, the seven chapters are only a derivation, not actual techniques from the scripture.” The alumnus said: “Moreover, this peerless existence has no equal, the supreme sword dao left behind might actually be able to suppress a heavenly scripture.”

“Are you being serious right now?” A cultivator nearby said: “Such a being would overshadow all dao lords, how come I haven’t heard of someone like this?”

The alumnus’ mouth opened, wanting to speak. However, his expression suddenly changed after thinking about something and refrained.

“Regardless, this battle is inevitable. I just hope that Fairy Dugu can guard Minor Sacred Mountain.” A genius concluded.

“I just hope it won’t be an ugly defeat.” Another youth murmured: “If Fairy Dugu can last long enough, it won’t be as bad.”

These comments were terrible for morale. Alas, they had to face reality. The scion has repeatedly proved his might.

The proud geniuses of the holy ground lost their arrogance and could only swallow their indignation. There was no chance of defeating the scion. A good loss would be an honor - a true display of skill.

This was their expectation and hope for Fairy Dugu, that her battle would be more brilliant than Golden Cicada’s.

They didn’t have that much hope in her being able to defend Minor Sacred Mountain.

By this point, it became abundantly clear that she was the last stand. Thus, no one stopped the scion as he entered Metropolis Division.
