Chapter 3679: Impossible To Stop Halfway

The student had no idea that this would be the result. The crowd certainly had his back earlier, seemingly ready to take down Li Qiye.

That’s why he gloated and thought that just a little scheme was enough to take down Li Qiye, no need to put in any effort. Just a few words of his could lead the crowd by the nose, certainly a successful clarion call.

Unfortunately, when it was time for action, the scene became silent right away - a stark contrast to the loudness prior.

Since most chastised Li Qiye so blatantly, they should have maneuvered against Li Qiye - or so this student thought. He had an illusion of being in total control.

“Gentlemen! Li Qiye is arrogant and views everyone with contempt, even the seniors present.” The student had no choice but to keep on speaking: “Seniors, please teach this brat a lesson for insulting you!”

“Young man, you spoke on the side of justice earlier, taking it as your responsibility. It’s time for you to go up the stage and shine. Take the treasures away from Li Qiye.” An older cultivator smiled.

“Indeed, your words were admirable earlier. Do it, we have your back.” Another said.

In reality, only a few hot-headed youths were actually motivated by this student. Other experts, especially the older ones, were only playing along.

They didn’t want to actually be the first to take action. That would only turn them into prime targets.

“Hmph, I hope your ability is as amazing as your tongue.” One expert actually didn’t hold back.

At the start, the student flattered Li Qiye continuously. Then, he changed his tune completely, wanting to turn the crowd against him. Some considered this wretched and despicable.

“Young friend, go first, we’ll support you.” Another smiled.

The student became nervous since he was pushed to the front now. Maybe he could defeat Li Qiye and take the treasures. However, he would become the next target right away. He might lose his life before being able to enjoy the treasures and resources.

“Seniors, please don’t joke around.” The student smiled wryly and said: “I’m just a nobody with no cultivation to speak of, no different from an ant. I am incapable of pushing the tides. This responsibility and justice require powerful masters such as yourselves to uphold...”

He shamelessly flattered the seniors and asked them to take action instead.

“So thick-skinned.” Yang Ling said with disdain: “You’re throwing away the reputation of Duality. What a tragedy to have a student like you.”

Others from Duality actually agreed with this statement and glared at him. Their disdainful expression said it all.

Some of these students actually didn’t like Li Qiye; others had an ongoing feud with him. However, they had more self-respect than to act in this manner.

The guy turned red after noticing the stares. He was stuck in a tough position.

“Seems like it’s up to you.” Li Qiye smiled: “The treasures are right here, come get it if you can.”

The spectators’ eyes lit up after hearing this. Even the student felt the same greed. Nonetheless, he knew that he wouldn’t leave this place alive after obtaining the treasures.

“Brother Li, that’s not my intention at all.” He put on a bright smile, changing his stance faster than the flip of a page.

He started with “Brother Li” then swapped to “Li Qiye” before switching back to “Brother Li” again.

“That doesn’t matter. You’re not leaving this place after provoking me. Make your move.” Li Qiye chuckled.

The student’s expression soured as he took one step backward.

“Do it already, be a role model for all of us. Hell, we might avenge you after Li Qiye kills you.” An older cultivator started laughing.

“Yes, you were the one who started this. Make your move!” Many wanted to break the impasse, hoping for more chaos.

“Gentlemen, please stop joking now.” The student had a forced smile.

“It’s too late for that. But, I’ll entertain you. If you can block one move from me, I’ll give you a treasure.” Li Qiye said.

“Really?!” The student blurted out in astonishment. Alas, he thought that this could go wrong but it was too late to change his words.

“Yes, I’m a man of my words.” Li Qiye smiled.

A few members of the audience actually wanted to give it a shot after hearing this.

“One move, one treasure? For real?” One cultivator felt his heart beating faster.

“Get ready.” Li Qiye egged the guy. VịSit no(v)3lb/!n(.)c𝒐m for new 𝒏ov𝒆l𝒔

“I...” The student was certainly tempted. He thought that he would be able to stop one move. The problem was - how to leave this place with the treasure?

“You were so enthusiastic earlier, don’t be a coward now. It’s just one move.” Yang Ling sneered.

“A student of Duality has more courage than this. You’re a disgrace.” A different student uttered coldly.

“Hurry up, we want to see what treasure you’ll get!” The crowd started being rowdy again.

Earlier, this student tried to force Li Qiye to hand over a treasure. Now, he was the one being forced to fight.

“You’re not lying? One move, one treasure?” The student gritted his teeth and shouted.

“That’s right, but I’m afraid you won’t be able to survive.” Li Qiye answered.

“You’re only a conqueror, don’t think so highly of yourself!” The student finally lost his cool and retorted: “I, a student of Duality, am absolutely stronger than you..”

“Yeah yeah, a student of Duality. Not special at all, one move is enough.” Li Qiye interrupted him.

“Hmph!” Other students became dissatisfied with him after hearing this.

“Very well, I want to see how you’ll defeat me with one move!” The student doubted this, believing in his own abilities. It was time for him to teach Li Qiye a lesson!
