Chapter 4941: Arrow Saint

After a loud explosion, the treasures combined together to form a colossal totem. His two sacred fruits soared in the air and released their dao power into the totem.

This was his empowered form, looking like the central pillar of three thousand worlds.

Meanwhile, Four-faced Venerable’s head started spinning again, releasing pulsing runes up into the air. His two sacred fruits maintained a strong grip on the pulse as if he was holding a heavenly sword.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

“Go!” They immediately unleashed their strongest attack.

“Celestial Totem!” Three-armed Monarch roared and engulfed the academy with the totem. Many buildings actually crumbled despite being reinforced with blessings.

“Omnislash!” The pulsing sword also slashed downward with enough intensity to split open a new age.

Students bellowed in horror, wanting to run away from Abroad. However, they were still immobilized by the various auras of these top combatants. They tried their best but couldn’t move an inch.

During this crucial moment, Bloodsea became serious and released his saber intent.

“Clank!” Another bloody glint appeared.

“Blood Sea Splitter!” He roared and released waves of blood capable of taking down the stars in the sky.

Living beings trembled before the actual slash manifested into reality. They felt themselves being buried in this ocean of blood; their own blood would eventually become a part of this massive ocean.

They shuddered as they smelled the stench of blood. This fear far exceeded the one dished out by the other two dragon lords.

“Boom!” The two attacks caused the waves to go even higher, turning into a tsunami. They aimed on pushing the ocean back.

However, the bloody slash finally showed up and divided the ocean into two halves along with the two techniques.

The dragon lords couldn’t believe it and decided to use their best movement steps to run. Alas, the slash had secured its targets.

“Enough!” A deafening shout interrupted the battlefield.

A man entered the battlefield; his cloak billowing behind him in the wind, dark hair flowing in its wake.

Everyone felt the power of the stars and the myriad dao gathering around him.

“Pop!” After a bright flash, an arrow soared through space itself with enough force to shoot down the sun.

“Arrow Saint!” Yue Shanjian knew who it was right away as the arrow flew toward Bloodsea’s throat in order to save the two dragon lords.

He retaliated by flipping his saber back and unleashing another slash. This one left a deep gash on the ground; its sharpness was incomprehensible.

It successfully stopped the arrow while the remnant of the first slash still struck the two dragon lords.

“Ahh!” It decapitated their head and destroyed their sacred fruits. The toughness of the fruits couldn’t block the slash. This made it impossible for them to come back to life.

During their last moment, they couldn’t help thinking about how fast and mighty the slash was.

Students stood there in a daze since they could never catch up to these dragon lords. Alas, both were killed by a single slash. They also gained an understanding of Bloodsea’s title. So this was his titular move; it left a deep impression on spectators.

“I see, blade and blood…” Some dropped down on their knees.

Others stared at the decapitated heads on the ground. For example, Swordgrasp and those from Deity were overwhelmed because their ancestors have met their demise.

“Arrow Saint? Even Godchaser is joining in.” A student calmed down and stared at the person floating in the air.

“Ancestor.” Radiant Young Monarch bowed at the bow user with three sacred fruits.

Godchaser was currently the strongest sect in Deity due to Conceal Conqueror and Radiant Monarch. The presence of its ancestor showed that all of Deity was taking this seriously.
