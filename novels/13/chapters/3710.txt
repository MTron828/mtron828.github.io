Chapter 3711: Evilbreaker Vajra

“Evilbreaker Vajra, one of the top ten dao lord weapons.” A frightened spectator said.

This particular weapon far exceeded its peers. It might be the dao lord’s strongest weapon.

At first, the weapon was simply known as Vajra since this was the simple name chosen by the dao lord.

Later on, he entered the forbidden zones to fight evil creatures. During that generation, the “evilbreaker” part was added to its name. It served as a symbol of his crafting prowess.

That’s why everyone became afraid to see it right now. This was a treasure capable of dominating a forbidden zone.

No wonder why people always talked about the last defensive lines at the capital. Once the walls fell, this one was enough to stop the enemies from invading.

“No, this isn’t the real thing.” A mighty ancestor carefully observed instead of being astounded: “It’s only a seal left behind by the weapon. The dao lord probably did it himself. It contains some of the weapon’s power.”

The astonished crowd stopped talking and focused on looking at the floating vajra. Sure enough, it became clear that it was only a seal. The ancestor was right.

“Correct.” Another ancestor privy to the inner stories elaborated: “Archaic Sun did everything they could and used different connections and fate in order to earn the favor of Vajra Dao Lord. He then left behind this seal.”

The dao lord came from the royal clan of Archaic Sun. Of course, he was far from being part of the main branch, only a prince from a side branch.

Archaic Sun didn’t care about a distant prince like him. Alas, he became an unbeatable dao lord later on. Thus, the court had no choice but to cling to this thin relationship. It wasn’t easy for them to eventually earn this seal.

“A seal, yes, but it still has a top-ten weapon’s power. This tiny portion should still be frightening.” One high elder had a serious expression.

No one disagreed with this statement. It would be foolish to look down on this seal. It should be enough to instantly reduce a sovereign to ashes.

“Can Li Qiye withstand it?” Cultivators shuddered while sensing the suppressive aura of the vajra.

All eyes were on Li Qiye. This was an apex weapon in Eight Desolaces.

“Hard to say, anything else and he would be perfectly fine. The problem is that he’s dealing with the famous vajra. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that its target will either die or be grievously wounded.” An ancestor who thought highly of Li Qiye remained skeptical.

“You chose hell instead of heaven.” The Grand Commander floated up high and looked down at Li Qiye: “That’s why today will be your last day!”

His eyes were decisive and murderous. His weak and helpless appearance earlier was nowhere to be found.

“I’ll cut you to pieces!” The Grand Chancellor gritted his teeth.

They lost their son to Li Qiye along with their mansion. That’s why they no longer gave a damn about anything else and wanted to settle the score with Li Qiye.

“Look at your confidence swelling up.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “It’s just one seal. I’m rather disappointed if this is your ace card. It should have been the real thing at the very least.”

“It’s more than enough to kill you.” The commander uttered.

They have suffered heavy losses today. Even clans as resourceful as theirs would have a hard time recuperating.

“Don’t be so sure. What if it can’t kill me? Do you think Vajra will be on your side? There’s a huge hole in your plan.” Li Qiye asked.

The two grimaced upon hearing this. They have committed a serious offense by activating the defense without permission. Vajra might actually maneuver against their clan.

They needed to win or this might be the start of their clans’ downfall.

“You don’t need to worry about that, just be ready for death! Let’s go!” The commander didn’t want to waste time.

“Start!” The chancellor ordered.

With this, the two temples became brighter and released more lights and flames. The seal of the vajra unleashed a boundless divinity, enough to crush everything in the realm.

People got a full taste of a top-ten weapon. Just one seal alone was dreadful. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Boom!” The vajra made its move. Dao laws as thick as mountain ranges manifested and descended.

The celestials lost their brilliance; all cultivators became as insignificant as worms.

“Goddamn!” One cultivator screamed in horror after seeing this.

In this key moment, Li Qiye’s armor had blue particles oozing out. They erupted like a thousand volcanos - a scene no less magnificent than the vajra’s attack.

The blue flames condensed together into a thick shield.

“Boom!” The dao laws struck the shield. Li Qiye’s location crumbled and became an abyss in the next moment. Debris was blown away and blinded the spectators.

“!!!” The spectators were overwhelmed with shock.

The high elders and ancestors couldn’t believe it. They thought that they wouldn’t be able to block that attack earlier.

Just the seal alone was destructive enough. They didn’t dare to imagine the real weapon in action.

“How is it looking for Li Qiye?” One spectator asked.

“Either death or serious injuries.” An expert murmured.

The guy had nothing against Li Qiye. The attack was just too strong. The majority thought that he wasn’t able to block it.
