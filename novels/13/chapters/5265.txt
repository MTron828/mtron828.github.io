Chapter 5266: Li, Accept Your Beating

“How is it my fault that I was born with this last name?” Li Zhitian said indignantly.

“That’s the most serious offense, am I right, Miss?” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“Damn right.” She finished another jar before calling for another.

She then poured a full bowl and told Li Zhitian: “Little Li, drink this and then accept the beating.”

“Ugh…” Li Zhitian held the bowl, not knowing if he should drink or not.

“Drink, you’re getting a beating either way. At least you get a free drink like this.” Li Qiye said.

“I guess so, Sir.” Li Zhitian finished the bowl in one gulp.

“Perfect.” Li Qiye said: “Miss, commence the beating now?”

“Little Li, come out now.” She came out of the tavern.

“What is going on?” Li Zhitian thought that he didn’t do anything wrong to deserve this treatment.

Li Qiye came over and tapped his shoulder: “It’s alright, this won’t last too long. Put on a good show for us, okay?”

“I agree.” The old servant suddenly spoke, seemingly enjoying Li Zhitian’s misery.

“This is not the time to be sad, come.” Li Qiye smiled and walked out the door.

Li Zhitian’s expression looked as if he was at a funeral, thinking that he shouldn’t have left the house today. Nonetheless, he accepted his fate and left the tavern.

The woman posed with her hands on her waist as she demanded: “Little Li, don’t hold back now. Show me what you can do before I make you bedridden for a long while.”

His helpless expression changed as a battle was about to start.

“Are you sure you wish to fight, Miss?” He didn’t think that she could take him down. After all, his talent was impeccable.

He could learn and solve any technique with a single glance, not to mention his current cultivation.

“Obviously, do you think this is a date or something? A frail-looking boy like you isn’t my type.” She said.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Miss, as you wish then.” Li Zhitian took a deep breath; his competitive nature has been sparked by her repeated challenges.

“Take this seriously, your meager skills aren’t enough, go all out.” Li Qiye shook his head and warned him.

Li Zhitian became startled. He had witnessed Li Qiye’s ability before and finally understood that this woman was extremely strong.

“Buzz.” He first took out a shield only the size of a bowl. However, it shot out immortal rays and looked unbreakable.

“Not bad, Void Shield of the imperial clan.” The old servant commented.

Li Zhitian hesitated, thinking that this was still not enough. He summoned all twelve sacred fruits.

They floated above him and poured down dao laws, creating a barrier capable of separating worlds.

Next, he combined all twelve together and started a dao harmonization. This made him one with the world, connecting with the core of the earth and the heaven above.

“Mmm, decent talent.” Li Qiye nodded approvingly.

Li Zhitian was satisfied with his defenses and said: “Miss, this is my grand dao, One with the World.”

“Good, get ready now.” She glared at him.

He shuddered and focused, entering a state of zen. He wanted to start with this unbreakable defense first before coming up with an offensive plan.

“Bam!” However, he was suddenly smashed into the ground.

During the fall, he clearly saw her rushing toward him. She grabbed him and performed a leg sweep, instantly destroying his defensive stance.

He was proud of his grand dao and thought that it could stop an attack from an apex conqueror.

“Ah…” He groaned due to the agony coursing through his entire body. He could tell that there was zero actual damage but it felt as if all of his bones have been broken.

He tried to get up but couldn’t, eventually deciding to just lay there.

“Another Li who can’t handle a single move.” She looked down at him and shook her head.

He could only smile wryly and stop himself from groaning audibly.

“Incredible technique.” The old servant said. This was his first time seeing something like this.

“It’s definitely beyond this mortal world. Go try.” Li Qiye smiled and pushed him forward.

“I… but my last name isn’t Li.” The old servant didn’t expect this.

“It’s fine, just give it a shot. Experiencing this technique is beneficial for you.” Li Qiye smirked.

The old man felt as if he was being presented as a sacrificial lamb. Alas, it wasn’t up to him.

“You’re not a Li.” She stared at him and said.

“My master says I’m a Li, so I’m a Li.” He said.

“Fine then, show me what you can do, Conqueror.” She didn’t mind another fight.

“Treasures are useless before you, Miss. I have one defensive dao that might be able to block your technique.” The old servant said.

“Hurry up already.” She waved her hand as if she was swatting a fly, not interested in someone whose last name wasn’t Li.

The old servant raised his hands slowly while partially squatting down. He still looked the same but became a different being - one capable of traversing the eternal realm of time and space.

Meanwhile, Li Zhitian tried to endure the pain and observed the old servant. This particular stance reminded him of someone.

Though the stance looked simple, it included all of his attainment in the dao - the culmination of his lifelong cultivation.

“Oh? Now this is more interesting, not a bad style at all.” The woman was surprised and finally said something nice.
