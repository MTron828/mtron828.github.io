Chapter 4451: Crow

The demon god was captivated by the simple diagram of a crow flapping its wings. Normally, crows were ominous - a sign of bad luck. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

They were nothing compared to phoenixes - the kings of birds. He had even experienced the dignified aura of this bloodline before.

Alas, he felt as if the crow depicted in the tablet was actually more magnificent than divine beasts including phoenixes and true dragons.

The world knew that the divine beasts were the noblest and strongest of all creatures due to their inborn advantages. However, this crow was a clear exception in the demon’s mind.

“What… is this?” He became emotional and wracked his brains to no avail. He had a good grasp of the various demons but still knew nothing about this crow.

“No records at all…” He then realized that he might be seeing something that he shouldn’t.

“A taboo subject?” He shuddered and didn’t dare to pry any further.

Certain things in history were considered taboos. Talking about it might result in death and clan destruction.

He wasn’t scared of them but still needed to exercise caution for the sake of Dragon.

“Sir, this is the opportunity for immortality?” He asked because the crow diagram was the only hint here.

“You can put it that way.” Li Qiye smiled. In his current state, a single thought of his was connected to the myriad dao.

He then activated his aura and became resplendent, shocking the demon god for only a split moment because he suddenly dispersed into particles.

This wasn’t because of an external force destroying his body. It turned into countless runes; his body resembled a world of grand dao.

Runes came together to form tiny dao laws; each containing wondrous mysteries. Just one strand would require a lifetime of research.

“Buzz.” The tiny laws started flowing towards the slab with the crow. The latter became resplendent as well, seemingly coming back alive.

The laws then entered the crow. This diagram could contain everything, even the profound dao laws stemming from Li Qiye.

“Pop!” The crow eventually became bright enough to force the demon god several steps backward. He had no choice but to close his eyes.

This brilliance only lasted for a split second. Once the demon opened his eyes, Li Qiye and the crow were nowhere to be found. The slab was still there, albeit devoid of content once more.

“They’re gone… So that’s the chance for immortality.” He immediately realized something.

So it turned out that the slab was the door. Entry allowed one to see the true opportunity. Otherwise, it would be impossible to gain access.

He was naturally curious and wanted to enter as well. He took a deep breath and copied Li Qiye, gently rubbing the slab.

His talent was exceptional so he imitated Li Qiye’s rhythm in order to feel the secrets of the slab. He attempted to summon the crow - this must be the key.

Unfortunately, although his action was identical, the diagram didn’t appear for him. He tried several times and eventually gave up.

“It’s not meant to be.” He understood.

Li Qiye had entered another different dimension, one unaffected by time and disturbance.

It seemed to be boundless. Perhaps this was the reason why it gave off an unchanging impression - a sense of being eternal.

However, those at the right level could tell the difference between being eternal and unchanging. Being eternal meant still flowing in the river of time instead of this stagnation.

He reached forward and suddenly, a tree branch emerged. It wasn’t big and had smaller offshoots with few leaves.

Nonetheless, the right experts would be astounded to see it. The branch was golden due to it being created from primordial energy and dao. They contained the very source of the dao within the runes and veins.

In other words, this tiny branch contained everything about numerous grand dao. Of course, it didn’t represent all grand dao, only the sources of certain affinities.

If one could somehow obtain and comprehend these sources, it meant being able to create an eternal lineage. Capable successors, whether tied by blood or not, would always be produced.

As for the few leaves, they contained merit laws far stronger than dao-lord-level ones.
