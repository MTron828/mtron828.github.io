Chapter 5923: Find Out Soon

Others might think that these stories were nonsense or mere legends, especially those in the mortal world. As for cultivators, they would never come here, let alone listen to these rambling mortals.

Chu Zhu, on the other hand, thought about the calamity after hearing mentions of the flood.

“What are your ancestors’ names?” She couldn’t help but ask.

The older villagers exchanged glances and couldn’t answer.

“We don’t know outside of Elder Songhao.” The village chief answered honestly: “He was the oldest among our ancestors, an immortal capable of refining pills that can turn a chicken into a phoenix.”

“Using the fire insect, right?” Chu Zhu asked while other cultivators would have snorted.

“According to the legends, yes.” The village chief said: “The insect can spill out immortal pills.”

They didn’t know the cultivation world and used the word “immortal” excessively. Of course, in their eyes, a cultivator living ten thousand years or so was immortal. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Then where are they now?” Chu Zhu asked.

“The final story spoke of the sea monsters from the flood. Our ancestors sacrificed themselves to save this world, so they’re not around anymore.” The village chief answered.

“There’s more to it.” Another old man said: “What happened was the last survivor, Elder Songhao, brought all of the descendants to this place to save them. He succumbed to injuries later.”

“That’s why we only remember Elder Songhao’s name, everyone else died in battle.” An old woman agreed.

Chu Zhu didn’t think they were fabricating stories to elevate their ancestors’ prestige. There seemed to be a hint of truth behind this.

Li Qiye didn’t respond and raised their shrine.

“Wait, stop!” The village chief became anxious: “This is an ancestral item left behind by Elder Songhao, it is our heirloom passed down from generation to generation, don’t touch it.”

It didn’t seem to be worth much but it held immense sentimental value to them.

“Do you know what it is?” Li Qiye stared at him.

The village chief couldn’t help but stare at the oldest villager who shook his head afterward.

“How can this be the heirloom when you don’t know what it is?” Li Qiye said.

“Because it is the only thing left behind by the ancestor, we cherish it to honor him.” The village chief said.

“Do you want to know what it is?” Li Qiye smiled.

The village chief looked around again but none knew what to do outside of staring at Li Qiye. There was nothing wrong with worshipping the final item of their ancestor. Of course, they also wanted to know what it was.

“You know?” The village chief asked with skepticism.

“We’ll find out soon.” Li Qiye smiled and left the house with it.

Everyone became startled and the men immediately chased after him with their spears ready. They had no choice but to attack him if he were to flee with their heirloom.

However, Li Qiye brought it to the center of the village and twisted it with both hands.

“Crack!” The shrine rotated as if it had gears.

The villagers watched in astonishment as if turned and shifted, the components arranged themselves with repetitive clicks and clacks. Even now, Chu Zhu still didn’t know the purpose of this transforming shrine.

Li Qiye casually tossed it on the ground and it began to grow taller and taller.

“What’s going on?!” The mortals had never witnessed such a miraculous phenomenon in this barren land before.

The men gripped their spear tightly while slowly retreating, still gazing at the unknown item. Everyone else ran back to their house, only peeking out to watch the transformation.

“A treasure indeed...” Chu Zhu murmured.

The shrine eventually engulfed the stone mound at the center, looking like an unbreakable prison.

“Ah, a hidden ace card after all.” Li Qiye smiled and patted the wall of the palace.

Dao laws emerged in resonation, releasing waves of power capable of crushing heaven and earth.

Mortals couldn’t resist and were pinned to the ground, unable to move.

“How formidable!” Chu Zhu found this shocking.

The palace started spreading into a majestic pass with figures standing above. Two particularly stood out - two supreme beauties.

One was clad in gleaming armor, looking like a venerable god standing above all despite her petite figure. Her sword radiated Buddhist light, capable of summoning a kingdom to bring peace and slay evil.

“She is...” Chu Zhu immediately thought about a legend, not expecting to see this figure with her own eyes.
