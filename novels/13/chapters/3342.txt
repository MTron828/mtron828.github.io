“You can do it...” The former quietly prayed for her victory. They wanted to help but were powerless to do so.

The power disparity was too great. All of them including Huang Jie’s group still wouldn’t be able to do anything. In fact, they would only get in her way.

She became serious after stabilizing her energy. She admitted that these two brothers were quite special when working together. Their power rose several times.

Her heaven laws gave her the upper hand but they have made it quite even now. There was a limit to how much these merit laws could do versus more powerful foes, cultivation-wise.

“Clank!” The truncheon and moon fork touched again. The brothers showed no sign of complacency after the first successful exchange.

After all, there was nothing to be proud of. They were older on top of having higher cultivation yet in a one-on-one fight, she would definitely be able to kill them.

“The devil form is worthy of its reputation.” Qianyue remained fierce and confident, not afraid in the slightest.

“Your inborn true fate is worthy of admiration as well.” Jinqiao said with a cold glare: “We have no intention of fighting you till the death. We only have two demands to let you go, first, leave the blood ginseng. Second, leave him too.” He pointed at Li Qiye.

All eyes turned towards Li Qiye. The ones from Divine Black had a strange expression on their face.

Jinqiao was telling the truth. He purposely antagonized Divine Black but had no intention of fighting Qianyue to the death.

First, it was dangerous to go all-out against someone with an inborn true fate. Most importantly, she was also the disciple of Ping Suoweng. Her death might start a storm.

When Su Xu died back then, the next battles between their sects became brutal with rivers of blood.

Thus, they weren’t in a position to do something so reckless. This was above their station.

Now, he demanded Li Qiye for two reasons - the guy was annoyingly haughty; plus, he wanted to see Divine Black’s reaction.

“In your dream. Since I am here, scram out of our territory or actually manage to kill me.” She strongly replied.

“So pessimistic. Just kill them.” Li Qiye shook his head, not liking her message.

“Fool!” Yaoyao bellowed.

“Miss Gong, the choice is yours and don’t make the wrong one. You will lose against the two of us.” Jinqiao glared at Li Qiye before telling Qianyue.

His confidence intimidated the disciples of Divine Black. It seemed that they could really kill Gong Qianyue after the boost in power by working together.

Qianyue’s eyes turned cold; her sword emitted fierce flashes.

“Miss Gong, this is not an empty threat. Feel free to try but you won’t be able to do anything to us. Think about your peers too, not just yourself.” Yaoyao joined in.

He wanted Qianyue to give up. Ultimately, he wasn’t actually sure of victory once Qianyue showed all of her ace cards.

“Are you forgetting about Feather?” Li Qiye casually reminded her.

Qianyue stared blankly for a moment before following his order. She put away her current sword and summoned Feather.

“Buzz.” The new sword emitted the will of a dao lord.

Everyone became frozen as if there was a dao lord present. They found it impossible to breathe. Some had trouble standing because of their shaking knees.

“A dao lord weapon!” The two brothers became aghast, the same with the members of Three Truths.

“Feather!” Those from Divine Black shouted with excitement.

An ultimate move from this weapon might be enough to kill the two brothers. This sword had swept through Eight Desolaces with South Conch Dao Lord.

Just its aura alone while sheathed was already dreadful. What about an actual slash?

The two brothers stared at the sword. The question became - could she really use it?

Jinqiao took a deep breath and made up his mind: “A dao lord sword is mighty indeed but you can’t scare us. I doubt you can use its power.”

“You have an inborn true fate, not an inborn dao physique.” Yaoyao added.

Though their words were strong, they actually felt fear inside. If she could use its power, she would definitely slaughter them in one move. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

Qianyue didn’t say anything, only holding the sword in her hand.

The atmosphere became tense for both the fighters and spectators. The latter didn’t know if Qianyue could use Feather. After all, she had only gotten it recently.

Moreover, she was only in the samadhi realm. In order to control a high-level heaven weapon like this one, one must at least be at the myriad-form realm. The exception were those who had an inborn dao physique.

Thus, the outcome of this battle relied on her ability to use the sword. If she couldn’t do so, then it wouldn’t be good for Divine Black.

“Miss Gong, looks like this is out of your hand.” The two brothers heaved a sigh of relief after seeing Qianyue’s inaction. They believed that she couldn’t control it.

There was no reason to be afraid anymore.

“As if controlling a dao lord weapon is that difficult.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Buzz.” Sword rays emanated from his palm, eventually culminating in the form of a sword seal.

“It’s that seal!” The disciples from Divine Back knew about this seal left behind by South Conch Dao Lord.

“Clank!” Li Qiye tossed the seal towards Qianyue. It entered her body.

All of a sudden, the aura of a dao lord erupted around her. It was as if she has been possessed by one.
