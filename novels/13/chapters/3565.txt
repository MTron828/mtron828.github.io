Chapter 3566: A Single Smash

All of the chaos primal beasts were lost in the misty formation, unable to find a way out. Meanwhile, Zhui Xueyun has integrated himself into the formation.

“Is he about to do it?” Many experts murmured since the beasts had no idea where he was. Success meant that he would be able to grab the fruits - an extreme harvest for his tribe.

The spectators became greedy just thinking about the fruits. Some started scheming in the background.

The ones from Duality Academy watched with bated breath. Teacher Du stared at the misty formation and finally glanced at the ape.

Ever since the Nightwalkers got here with their formation, the ape hasn’t moved at all. It seemed to be sleeping, unaware of the development with the sealed area.

“Not necessarily, they’re underestimating the dichromatic ape. This formation shouldn’t be enough.” Teacher Du shook his head.

He wasn’t the only one with this belief. A few ancestors felt the same way thinking that the Nightwalkers were thinking too highly of their formation versus a high heaven-level beast.

Of course, the elders of this tribe were nervous as well. They were controlling the formation so they could spot Zhui Xueyun. He was extremely close to the tree now.

In reality, they knew that this formation alone wasn’t enough to trap the ape. It was certainly mighty but the ape was a true monster.

For example, they wouldn’t be able to trap Eight-tribulation Blood King with the formation. Nonetheless, they hoped that the formation plus the blood eyes would be able to slow the ape down a bit.

They didn’t want all the fruits, just three or five would have been more than enough.

“Get ready to back off.” They exchanged glances and made preparation.

“It’s about to happen.” The other ancestors saw this and knew that Xueyun was close to the tree.

The beasts such as the serpent, leopard, and others were still stuck in the formation. They didn’t know that there was an intruder either.

“This is the key moment.” Teacher Du stared intensely ahead.

The students became anxious as well. They wanted to know if Xueyun would actually be able to do it.

“Is it over? How many fruits did he get?” One student grasped their sleeves tightly and sweated for Xueyun. Trying to steal the fruits from a dichromatic ape was quite audacious.

“Raa!” Just when everyone thought that success was imminent, the ape sleeping by leaning on the tree suddenly opened its eyes.

“It knows!” Everyone became startled right away.

“Boom!” The ape stood up and a terrible chaos energy shot out. The mist of the formation was instantly separated.

“Withdraw!” The elders of the Nightwalker became aghast and made a fast decision.

“Rumble!” The thick pillars flew out of the ground and headed straight for the ape just like thrown spears.

“Buzz.” A faint mist of blood could be seen below the tree. Zhui Xueyun didn’t get greedy and stopped his mission. He channeled his eyes and shot out of the formation like a bloody arrow.

“Boom!” The ape smashed downward with one hand, carrying the destructive immensity of heaven.

The penetrating pillars weren’t effective in the slightest and crumbled beneath its palm strike, piece by piece.

Xueyun was a split second away from getting out of the formation. Alas, the shockwaves of that palm strike still struck him. He was forced out of his mist form and got sent flying, bloodied.

“Go!” The elders weren’t afraid and rushed towards Xueyun. They caught him and carried him towards safety before stopping.

Meanwhile, the entire formation finally collapsed from the ape’s one move in a loud manner. Once the dust settled, the tree appeared before everyone again. The leaves were still fluttering to the wind; the fruits still had the same tempting luster.

“Raa!” The ape roared again, causing all the spectators to tremble. After seeing that a point was made, it went back to sleep beneath the tree.

“Shit, that ape is so strong!” The students from Duality were still shuddering with fear.

That powerful formation, Mist Sealing Eight Firmaments, couldn’t withstand one move from the ape.

“That’s a high heaven level beast for you. Cultivators in the same realm still can’t touch it.” Teacher Du didn’t find this surprising.

“He’s already lucky to be alive.” Everyone saw Xueyun being healed in the distance and thought that he was fortunate.

His condition was stabilized thanks to the effort of the elders.

“Even that formation doesn’t work.” An expert shook his head with regrets.

“A little bit more, just a little bit more...”Xueyun got up and stared at the fruits on the tree with an ugly expression. He acted haughtily earlier, not expecting failure.

With this development, the crowd thought that no one could take down the ape’s defense.

“Don’t mess around, the mighty ancestors need to come themselves or no one will be able to get the fruits.” A pessimistic air of helplessness permeated the area. F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“Who’s the first to understand the grand dao, no one else but me...” A relaxed voice suddenly sounded.

Everyone saw a young man slowly sauntered over. He wore a shabby robe and had a woodcutter hanging by his waist. He carried a shoulder pole with timber on it.

“Why is there a woodchopper here?” The cultivators became surprised. Why would there be one here in Myriad Beast Mountains?

“Hi, Young Noble Li.” Yang Ling came over to greet him.

This woodchopper with a calm expression was none other than Li Qiye.

He smiled and nodded at her.

“You’re looking for firewood here?” Yang Ling and her two friends asked.

“No.” Li Qiye shook his head: “The area is still several peaks ahead. I’m just thirsty and will be grabbing some fruits.”
