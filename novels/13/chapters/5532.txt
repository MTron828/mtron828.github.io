Chapter 5533: Exception

The old beggar took his time before responding: “Perhaps this is merely the process, not the final outcome.”

“Do you know what the final outcome is?” Li Qiye said.

“It seems like you know it very well, Mister Li.” The old beggar said.

“The truth is that the one who knows it best is him, not me.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Him?” The old beggar’s eyes shifted to the side after hearing this.

“To repeat once more, he had lived the longest among us, so what is the difference between him and the villainous heaven?” Li Qiye asked.

“Virtually identical.” The old beggar said.

“Not quite.” Li Qiye chuckled and said: “If they were completely identical, he would have become the new heaven, and you all would have zero opportunity.”

“That makes sense as well.” The old beggar agreed.

“Then why the wait across the epochs?” Li Qiye asked.

“Hmm…” The old beggar glanced upward in rumination while Li Qiye enjoyed the high breeze with a relaxed expression.

After a long while, the old beggar asked: “What is your explanation for this, Mister Li?”

“In a sense, the fundamentals are too similar. Why would he and all of you be able to surpass the villainous heaven? While you’re all trying to obtain immortality, the villainous heaven has transcended life and death. How can you compete?” Li Qiye smiled.

“How can one truly know without being in that position?” The old beggar said.

“No need because this is a law of the world, everything is predetermined including your disadvantages. This applies to him as well, so it’s hopeless.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I suppose you think you are different.” The old beggar said.

“Indeed, I’m the exception.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I see.” The old beggar stared at Li Qiye with his blind eyes.

“That is why the villainous heaven didn’t come to you and the others. You all aren’t qualified.” Li Qiye tapped his shoulder and said.

“I can’t say I agree, Mister Li.” The old beggar said.

“Then tell me, what are you all protecting now?” Li Qiye asked.

“The villainous heaven had destroyed plenty in the past.” The old beggar said.

“He upholds the rules of heaven and earth, carrying out destruction and creation. Have you ever seen him devour an epoch or a world? No, only destroying the form, not the essence. The end of an epoch means the start of another. Living beings can rise again and enjoy the returned essence. Your bunch, on the other hand, are the real villains who have fallen into darkness.” Li Qiye said.

He continued while smiling at the beggar: “This is why he had never done such a thing before. He has more knowledge and understands that if he were to do so, he would immediately lose his qualification so in that regard, you were right that he was the most qualified. Of course, this is limited to your group.”

“You don't deny his probability of success.” The beggar said.

“Can his limit surpass the villainous heaven’s limit? When they are relatively similar, how can he win?” Li Qiye said.

“What is your limit then, Mister Li? What do you protect?” The beggar asked.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“A limit might not be necessary since I’m the exception. As for what I protect? It’s not this world but rather, myself and my dao heart.” Li Qiye said: “You all fell to the darkness because you couldn’t even protect yourself, let alone others. No protectors at all but more like, shepherds who ultimately only want to consume sheep.”

“Sheep are nutritious.” The beggar said sentimentally.

“Yes, so in the end, you will only be a shepherd, nothing more.” Li Qiye said.

The beggar didn’t respond.

“Take care of business now, death isn’t a bad option.” Li Qiye remarked.

“Mister Li, there will be a gap during the descent, isn’t that a great opportunity?” The beggar said.

“That’s a self-comforting angle, mere wishful thinking.” Li Qiye responded.

“Mister Li, perhaps you haven’t seen it with your own eyes, but it’s not something one can anticipate. This will be a prolonged war due to ample preparations.” The beggar said.

“I know, this is your chance to take down the villainous heaven, the pits are ready for his demise.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s the idea.” The beggar nodded.

“How confident are you in this plan succeeding?” Li Qiye said casually.

The beggar fell into silence again.

“If you were confident, you wouldn’t be here asking me for food. That is why you snuck down here, unless, you have a similar purpose like that unknown guest.” Li Qiye said.

“I do not.” The beggar said.

“You’re fully aware that it won’t work, hence taking the initiative in planning an escape route with me.” Li Qiye said.

“So will you spare some food, Mister Li?” The beggar asked.

“That depends on your choice and the path beneath your feet. You know this.” Li Qiye said.

The beggar gazed into the distance and eventually murmured: “To let go…”

“There’s no shame in this, not that you haven't done your fair share of shameful deeds in the past.” Li Qiye said.

The beggar let out an echoing sigh, seemingly recalling a distant epoch before agreeing: “Yes…”

“Only when one truly reaches a dead end will they seek repentance. This type of repentance is cheap.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Say what you want, Mister Li, I suppose I must walk away from the path laid out before me.” The beggar said.

“Of course, there is no free lunch.” Li Qiye smiled.

“What do you want, Mister Li?” It seemed that the beggar had finally made up his mind. In reality, he had already made this choice once he came here.

“I don’t need to ask you for treasures, just a few tasks. Instead of just repenting, it is time to contribute.” Li Qiye said.

“Very well.” The beggar didn’t hesitate for a second: “Mister Li, for what reason do you trust me?”

“No reason, I’m merely taking a chance.” Li Qiye stood up, patted his hands, and walked away.
