Chapter 4730: Casual Throw

The spear throw exceeded all imagination and logic, breaking through everything along the way.

The astounded emperor didn’t understand. Sagacity was the first dao lord weapon he mastered. The two had a mutual understanding; it became an extension of his hands.

As its master, he somehow couldn’t stop the spear from heading straight at him, fully activated. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Come, Bowl!” Five-sun King shouted during this crucial moment after seeing the confused young emperor.

He summoned the Bowl of the World. It released a five-colored radiance and became as huge as a mountain, blocking in front of the emperor to stop Sagacity.

“Boom!” Fiery sparks splashed everywhere as the tip of the spear struck the bowl. The shock waves sent spectators flying despite already being at a safe distance.

The sparks then pierced through peaks and the ground, horrifying spectators.

Five-sun King was a wonderful cultivator, sending his bowl through a long distance to save the young emperor.

Alas, the immovable bowl couldn’t stop it fully. He staggered backward and felt his internal organs shaking violently, causing him to vomit blood.

The loud bang was unbearable for listeners. It took a while before they could breathe again through the pain.

They then saw Li Qiye standing there calmly while the two geniuses stared intensely at him.

“Still no chance.” Everyone reached the same conclusion.

Many already had this guess before but now, it became abundantly clear. Four conquerors have fought Li Qiye, only to be proven inadequate. The only one left was Firmament Mortal King but the result should still be similar.

The duo had a solemn expression, aware that a fierce battle was inevitable. In reality, they already suspected this beforehand.

However, as supreme geniuses, they didn’t wish to give up before actually exchanging blows.

Now, the young emperor knew that in a one-on-one fight, he would have been absolutely crushed. The only way to win was to team up and rely on their sect’s power.

“Let us witness his wondrous techniques together?” Five-sun King straightforwardly suggested.

Soloing Li Qiye was idiotic at this point. However, they could team up and at least see Li Qiye’s supreme techniques. Not seeing his power would leave them with regrets.

“Come, today is your last chance.” Li Qiye smiled.

The two exchanged glances and lacked confidence. They still had no idea of his true power and how much they needed to take him down.

The start of this competition was a shot arrow, meaning that there was no taking back. They had to eliminate Li Qiye or there would be no chance of them becoming a dao lord.

“We shall see the truth today.” Five-sun King said with conviction.

“I’m afraid you will only see death.” Li Qiye smiled.

Everyone became nervous yet excited. There was no delaying the inevitable now. This would be a fight to the death. Due to the gravity of the matter, the five conquerors had been delaying the competition until now.

“This is the start?” One youth asked.

“Seems that way, the battle today will decide the candidates. The winner might not become the dao lord but the losers will be eliminated for sure.” An ancestor nodded.

Others nodded silently.

“To death then.” The young emperor also spoke with conviction.

“Now’s your chance to show your top merit laws before I kill you both. It would be a shame to not show the world your dao culmination.” Li Qiye said with a smile, not taking the two of them seriously.

Keep in mind that by this point, not all ancient ancestors could keep up with them.

“This is too much, we’re talking about True Immortal and the eastern alliance here.” One big shot said.

“Right, I still think the outcome is unclear.” Another ancestor said.

Though everyone felt that Li Qiye was being arrogant, no one criticized him due to his strength.

“You can see the future, Dao Brother?” Five-sun King retorted.

“This isn’t a difficult task.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“This is not just a battle between us three, don’t you know?” The young emperor’s expression soured. He made it clear that it wouldn’t be just the two of them.
