Chapter 4842: Duel At Skybreak Cliff

Eight-stallion Dao Lord of Chaos and Conceal Conqueror of White Stone - these were the two strongest cultivators in the lower continents.

The dao lord represented the People while Conceal represented the Race. The latter had seven dao fruits yet she didn’t travel to the other continents. [1]

The two had an existing feud and fought before. In terms of power, Conceal was most likely stronger. However, Eight-stallion had the immortal shield so he couldn’t be defeated in battle.

Now, the story of the missing shield changed the landscape of the three lower continents, doubly so for Chaos. Everyone had their own agenda.

Of course, this didn’t mean that the dao lord was helpless. A being with six dao fruits was still formidable. Both Ten Fierces and Twelve Unmatched Lineages couldn’t touch him.

Normally, dao lords and conquerors would enter the upper continents after obtaining three or four dao fruits. The lucky ones would travel straight to the immortal continent. It was historically rare for cultivators to stick around.

Unfortunately for the dao lord, the inevitable always came knocking.

“Conceal Conqueror challenges Eight-stallion Dao Lord to a duel at Skybreak Cliff!” Another piece of news interrupted everyone as they were debating the topic of the missing shield.

In just one night, villains gathered in Chaos after hearing this news.

“How fast.” Cultivators and ancestors became emotional.

This battle between the two strongest masters could change everything on the three continents.

“Chaos will become chaotic again.” A big shot murmured.

“This is the end of Eight-stallion Dynasty.” one expert said.

“The tragedy of Heavenpeak Conqueror is repeating again.” An ancestor told his junior members.

Heavenpeak Conqueror represented Primal Trinity and The People, creating a sect with the same name.

His rise should have changed Chaos and propelled Primal Trinity’s prestige and authority. However, Conceal who has just become a conqueror actually dared to ambush a two-fruit conqueror.

Surprisingly enough, she was successful and killed him. Of course, she paid a heavy price - lasting injuries.

Next came Eight-stallion Dao Lord who has just ascended. With one dao fruit, he fought and defeated everyone on the lower continents. Conceal lost to him due to her injuries and was saved by the ancestors of Deity.

This was the start of their feud. In the last thousand years, the two have fought repeatedly while improving their cultivation - from one dao fruit to six.

Finally, Eight-stallion gained the immortal shield while Conceal earned the seventh fruit. This temporarily stopped their competition until the duel request today.

“Eight-stallion Dao Lord accepted.” More information came subsequently and stirred the realms.

“What is going to happen…?” Most worried for their future.

“The dao lord should just leave.” Those from The People didn’t want him to risk fighting due to his contributions to Chaos. He could simply leave for the upper continents instead.

“If he enters Immortal City, no one can do a damn thing to him.” An ancestor said: “Not even Celestial Court, let alone Conceal Conqueror or The Race.”

In the past, rumor has it that Eight-stallion Dao Lord was well-liked by a supreme Immortal Emperor. This granted him entry to Immortal City located on the highest continent.

Alas, he chose to fight instead of seeking asylum.

“That’s a dao lord for you, still domineering and preferring to die in battle.” Cultivators respected his choice.

Many anxious souls started fleeing Chaos, especially the weaker sects. They abandoned their ancestral ground in order to travel faster.

Top lineages such as Primal Trinity and Hundred Races felt the same way. With unrest came those who would love to take advantage of it. Unceasing wars could be the result.

***

Skybreak Cliff, an ancient battlefield, was packed with cultivators from all three lower continents. Ancestors from the twelve lineages also showed up to watch the fight.

It consisted of floating cliffs suffering various damages. Some were severed by sword slashes, others only had the base left…

Wreckage and remains were abundant as well - fractured ships, gigantic beast skeletons, broken weapons…

Big shots seemed to enjoy fighting on this battlefield. Their duel usually took place here, whether it be sovereigns, dragon lords, dao lords, conquerors…

The reason was that the battlefield allowed them to go all-out. The shockwaves were contained here without damaging the continents.VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Immortal Altar, Heaven Burial, Deity…” The villains present didn’t dare to breathe loudly after seeing the big shots from the top lineages.

Twelve lineages represented the prime fighting forces of the three lower continents, each representing a single dao. Countless sects spawned off them.

New conquerors and recently-arrived dao lords would still be within their jurisdiction.

For example, Conceal Conqueror represented Deity while Eight-stallion represented Hundred Races despite having formed his own dynasty.

1. People and Race don’t have English equivalence. The characters for people include “early” and “people”. The characters for Race include “ancient” and “race/tribe”. The two are similar and can almost be used interchangeably without distinguishing context. My choice of treating them as proper nouns might change later but I don’t foresee a better choice, at least for now ☜
