Chapter 4150: Wandao Jian

“You’re too kind, Your Highness. My meager ability is not worth mentioning.” Goldflow shook his head.

He was not a competitive person and this only made people like him more. Geniuses from large sects were normally imperious; he was a rare exception.

The princess didn’t say anything else. The competition between the Ten Sword Prodigies has always been there. Albeit, they rarely fought each other so an actual ranking couldn’t be determined. More battles were required for anything concrete.

Well, to be exact, only eight were left after the death of Hundred-blade Noble and Starshooter Prince. The top candidates were currently Abyss Scion and Goldflow Young Noble.

Therefore, Ning Zhu left many in shock since her potential could eventually surpass these other two.

“She’s so strong, this is enough to let her run rampant right now in the world.” One youth whispered.

However, Li Qiye wasn’t as impressed as the rest. He yawned and said: “All of this back and forth is a waste of time. Finish this.”

Lu Qi obeyed and stepped forward, flicking one finger.

“Boom!” The scion seemed to be struck by lightning and staggered backward, nearly dropping his sword due to a sharp pain in his palm.

The crowd gasped after seeing this. The scion was now strong enough to threaten big shots from the last generation.

However, one finger strike from this woman alone pushed him back.

“Who is she?” All eyes were on Lu Qi. Alas, they couldn’t see anything due to her veil and stealth technique.

None recognized her despite being aware that she must be a famous cultivator.

“An ancestor from a big sect, no, a dao lord-lineage like Nine-wheel Citadel or Sea Emperor.” A regional lord concluded.

“Why does Li Qiye have so many masters under his banner? Being rich is so nice.” One youth became jealous.

Li Qiye had two members of the ten on his side. No other youth had such a grand style when traveling. Now, this mysterious woman was incredible as well. This was before mentioning Tie Jian in action a while back.

Thus, Li Qiye clearly had numerous masters under him. It might not be difficult for him to summon ten Heavenly Sovereigns to this place right now, meaning that his faction alone was comparable to a great power.

“It might not have anything to do with money. Money can’t be this omnipotent.” An old ancestor commented.

This made his peers think. Sure, Crimsondeath Monarch or Pendant Sword Maiden could be recruited with money. However, this mysterious woman was at the next level.

Why would this powerful existence work for Li Qiye if money wasn’t a factor?

Unfortunately, their heavenly gazes didn’t work so they had no idea who she was.

Terra Sword Saint stared at Lu Qi for a bit before stopping; his expression looked a little strange.

“Our young noble has grown tired of this, leave.” Lu Qi said flatly.

“The audacity to give a command to our Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom. We have never been afraid of a fight before.” An old man helped support Abyss Scion and uttered coldly.

He then activated his torrential vitality. A terrible aura engulfed the region and froze the crowd.

“A Myriad Sovereign?” One expert shouted.

“Yes, the minister of Sea Emperor, Wandao Jian.” An expert recognized him and said: “He’s also its chief elder.” [1]

“That’s the elder known for being able to obliterate a kingdom with one slash?” The youths have heard of this top master before.

“That’s him. Few are stronger than him in Sea Emperor when not counting the ancient ancestors.” An expert nodded.

“Of course, the chief elder of Sea Emperor can’t be weak.” His friend agreed.

Normally, ancient ancestors slumbered and didn’t care for mundane and worldly affairs. Thus, younger masters such as Wandao Jian stood at the peak.

“I don’t know who you are but if you wish to fight, we are ready.” Wandao Jian glared at Lu Qi while lightning coursed in his eyes.

This wasn’t an empty threat because Sea Emperor was afraid of no one in this region. Others would be intimidated and give up with haste.

“Wandao Jian, you’re no match for me, tell Jialun to come.” Lu Qi responded with an indifferent tone.

“Who is Jialun?” A young listener asked.

An ancestor took a deep breath and said: “Ancestor Jialun, Wandao Jian’s master.”

“... Wo-wouldn’tn’t that make him an ancient ancestor?” The youth stammered.

Wandao Jian was already the chief elder of Sea Emperor and its minister. Thus, his master had to be an ancient ancestor.Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Indeed, rumor has it that Ancestor Jialun is only second to Vastsea Paragon.” The ancestor replied.

“Only second to Vastsea Paragon?!” Those nearby gasped after hearing this.

1. This is a 50/50. Myriad Dao Sword might be the title but it could just be the guy's name. Using the pinyin here can't hurt unless the author throws out his real name later. Wandao Jian flows better so going with that for now
