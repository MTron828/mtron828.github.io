Chapter 5649: Female Blacksmith

“Clank!” The woman struck the piece of metal repeatedly during the refinement process.

Unlike mortal blacksmithing, the piece of metal was engulfed in numerous sword dao laws. She also imbued the hammer with power from her anima tree.

Thus, each smash utilized anima to imprint her sword dao into the forming blade.

This served two purposes - creating a blade on top of honing her dao and cultivation. She did so tirelessly, completely immersed in the process.

Li Qiye sat down and didn’t disturb her rhythmic dao training. She paid no attention to him and continued to hammer away - becoming one with her sword dao and anima in a zen state.

Top cultivators could tell that this went beyond blacksmithing. It seamlessly integrated cultivation and blacksmithing, killing two birds with one stone.

“Clank!” The crafting finished in time and the woman tempered the blade. It possessed a chilling sword aura before being sharpened, capable of decapitating anyone.

She carefully traced the blade with her fingers before sighing in disappointment. This didn’t reach her desired level.

“Insufficient.” She tossed the sword away. It turned into a ray and flew into the previous valley.

She then turned to take a look at the visitor. The moment her eyes fell upon Li Qiye, they exuded a blinding imperial light. Just her gaze alone could kill anyone from ten million miles away.

She became emotional and came over to bow: “Sacred Teacher, I apologize for the late greetings.”

“You recognize me?” Li Qiye smiled and came closer.

“I heard Senior South Emperor mention you and your supreme appearance before, I have nothing but admiration for you, Sacred Teacher.” She responded; her eyes reflected her words.

“South Emperor, I see. You must be Violet Abyss Dao Lord.” Li Qiye smiled. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“It is a pleasure to meet you, Sacred Teacher.” She bowed again.

She came from Eight Desolaces, the third dao lord of Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom and a user of Abyss Sword Dao.

According to the legends, she was born in a small village in Sea Emperor and was engaged to another boy.

However, the boy was chosen by the kingdom due to his innate gift, eventually becoming its successor.

The successor of this behemoth had limitless potential and could become the next dao lord. On the other hand, she was only a villager with no future to speak of. The best she could hope for was to own her farm.

Therefore, the youth returned to break off the engagement. This infuriated the girl so she ran away from home, traveling the world seeking capable masters.

However, her efforts were in vain because she mastered nothing. This continued even after she entered her forties.

Alas, she didn’t give up and tirelessly sought dao guidance, going as far as venturing into perilous realms.

She was rewarded by obtaining one of the nine heavenly sword dao, Abyss. Moreover, she found the actual sword as well.

With the sword and its dao together, she obtained an incredible power and returned to Sea Emperor.

At this point, her ex-fiance had become the ruler of Sea Emperor, possessing both authority and a matchless sword dao.

She challenged him to a duel, ending with his defeat. She then broke off the engagement and forced him to abdicate.

Henceforth, Sea Emperor had a new ruler who would go on to become its third dao lord - Violet Abyss.

She now stood before Li Qiye who came closer to observe the cauldron. The flame came from the ground and seemingly possessed a corporeal property.

“Zzz...” He reached forward, not feeling any high heat. Upon contact, it managed to burn his hand.

A primordial light appeared and healed his wound. He pulled back and commented: “This flame is special.”

“You are incredible, Sacred Teacher. How many can withstand this flame?” She was in awe to see Li Qiye being so reckless.

Her hand would have been reduced to ashes, leaving a potentially permanent injury.

“Inborn Trinity Primal Trueflame, only one person has this flame in the mortal world.” Li Qiye commented sentimentally.

“I came to this place under the guidance of Senior South Emperor.” She responded: “I’ve been looking for a good flame all this time to forge the sword I envision. This didn’t go so well until after I came to this battlefield. The senior mentioned a trueflame falling in this place and I was lucky enough to find it, so I settled here. It’s the best I’ve ever seen.”

“Of course it is, it is one of a kind.” Li Qiye smiled and shook his head.

“Unfortunately, I still can’t craft my weapon with it.” She sighed and lamented.

“You were inspired by the old man in Sword Burial Zone, wanting to forge a sword to merge with your dao.” Li Qiye said.

“I’m shocked that you know this, Sacred Teacher.” She couldn’t help but tremble.

“It’s evident at a glance that you’ve only grasped the bare surface.” Li Qiye said.

“Your insight is impeccable, Sacred Teacher.” She took a deep breath and bowed respectfully: “The truth is that I saw a vision during a near-death encounter. It guided me to the two parts of Abyss.”

According to the legend, the dao lord couldn’t grasp the dao despite her best efforts and made a last-ditch attempt to enter Sword Burial Zone. The world didn’t know that not only did she obtain these artifacts, but she also saw an immortal training with the sword. This memory remained etched in her memory.

Because of this, she wanted to craft her own blade, hence her journey across the immortal continent to find the right flame.

“The heavenly sword is a limit.” Li Qiye said.

She felt slightly embarrassed and nodded: “Yes, Sacred Teacher, but it is still not my own. I wish to be able to craft a blade of this level eventually.”

She didn’t need to forge a blade at all since she already had Abyss. This was the limit of the mortal world, exceeding imperial and divine blades.

However, this was still not her sword. Many others who had obtained the heavenly swords felt the same way and didn’t necessarily keep them around.
