Chapter 5732: Uncrossable Celestial River

Those who had been here before remained calm, but newcomers couldn’t help but be in awe at the sheer scale of Celestial Court.

For many of them, Imperial Field was already massive enough with its oceanic geography. However, there was no end to the number of stars and palaces found here.

The islands of Imperial Field had no lack of splendors yet still paled before this expanse.

“One of the nine indeed.” An experienced monarch commented.

“Yes, just like Immortal Dao City.” Another emperor said sentimentally.

Immortal Dao City had numerous phenomena capable of leading to another world. Each represented a peerless grand dao. Celestial Court’s stars were not inferior in the slightest.

Elder Galaxy was its true name but the world only knew of it as Celestial Court.

As one of the nine, it was on the same level as Immortal Dao City and Void Gate. Unlike the latter two, Celestial Court had a master for a long period, perhaps ever since the start of Trinity Epoch.

The mysteries and powers of Elder Galaxy have been extracted for the benefit of Celestial Court’s members.

For example, it could teleport armies anywhere on the immortal continents. Its light also boosted offensive and defensive capabilities. Most importantly, it could also bring back near-death combatants.

The effectiveness of the blessings varied between users due to the rules and limitations in place.

If someone could enjoy all of its blessings alone, they would be able to obliterate any imperial-level character. Unfortunately, drawing out its full potential was virtually impossible.

Doing so required a formation by many cultivators. Resolute had done so before with the help of War and the others.

Being tied up to Celestial Court was a good thing. Who didn’t want improved battle prowess on top of a cheat-death ability? Imperial-level characters alone were difficult to kill, let alone when they had this ace card.

Of course, the price meant becoming a member of Celestial Court permanently for they were stuck with Elder Galaxy.

This was the reason why some chose to join Celestial Court but refused the blessings. They preferred freedom over the various pros.

However, they would never be admitted to the upper echelons of Celestial Court regardless of their power. These emperors and monarchs were usually sent to the upper or even the lower continents. Only the trusted ones who have been connected to Elder Galaxy were eligible to wield actual authority in the future.

As the armies marched forward, they didn’t see anyone coming out of the palaces. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“To the river.” Demon ordered.

Deeper into this expanse was a winding river separating it into two halves. The other side of the river looked more enigmatic with grander palaces worthy of immortals. It shimmered and sparkled with a silvery light as if numerous stars were part of its unending current.

Crossing this river seemed impossible. The result would be sinking to the bottom, never to come out again. This included imperial-level characters.

Previously, the duck egg buyer, Immortal Emperor Fei Yang, and Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan crushed the armies of Celestial Court, forcing them to flee back to the river.

However, they didn’t have the method of crossing and had no choice but to retreat. Only a few could do so with their cultivation. Their firepower would have been reduced dramatically, unable to contend against the remaining forces of Celestial Court.
