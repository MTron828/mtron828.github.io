Chapter 5007: Raging Maddened Flames

The fiery being was filled with rage and madness, viewing the entire world as the enemy.

“Ahh!” His roar echoed through the dimension while black holes were formed from the sheer destruction.

If this power were to escape the current dimension, it would burn all the lower continents into nothingness. Sovereigns and dragon lords were not worth mentioning. This applied to conquerors and dao lords as well.

In spite of this, Li Qiye stood by his side and let the flames hit him while chanting: “... As long as they are imperishable, so will the grand dao…”

In fact, he seemed relaxed as if he was soaking in a hot spring and enjoying the mild heat.

His words and laws became the only things left in this dimension. They kept the dimensional fabrics together or it would spread to the lower continents.

Li Qiye’s mantra served to polish and lead the raging flames. After a considerable length of time, the flames started calming down. He stared at the fiery youth as if this was a masterpiece.

The lower three continents enjoyed relative peace and sunshine today until a loud explosion occurred in Maddened Lineage.

Its source consisted of an inferno left behind by their progenitor. Because of this, its members didn’t need a master to learn the dao.

As long as one was willing to worship the maddened flame, they would be able to cultivate this supreme grand dao and become unbeatable. Some notable figures included Coldflame Conqueror and Maddened Conqueror.

Capable flame users went on to create their own sect, hence the start of the great lineage.

Today, the entire region was shaking violently. A similar phenomenon occurred during the ascension of their great conquerors.

Next came the emergence of a great shadow in the sky. It could be seen from all three continents, not just Maddened.

A frenzied inferno rushed into the air and pierced the sky vault just like a great fist, fully devouring the figure.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

All members of Maddened, whether they be regular disciples or ancient ancestors, got on their knees before the might of the inferno. This applied to others in the three continents as well.

Conquerors from the other lineages couldn’t believe it. This inferno was simply unstoppable.

In Godchaser Palace, the supreme Conceal Conqueror also opened her eyes. She gazed into the distance and saw a figure bathing in the inferno; her expression changed drastically as a result.

This phenomenon also reached the massive territories of Demon. The great beasts and demon monarchs saw how the sky was being incinerated by the maddened flames.

“Look…” Goldcrest trembled in astonishment. They exchanged glances and knew that this had something to do with Flame-eater Child.

Fortunately for everyone, this power came out of nowhere and dispersed just as fast.

The ancient ancestors from Maddened were lost and frightened. They came closer to the source but couldn’t get inside. They suspected that the figure earlier was using their source to grow stronger. Despite using this dao, they knew that forcefully entering the inferno was suicidal. In the end, they chose to do nothing because this was the only option.

Back in Demon, space rippled a bit and Li Qiye came out in the same position - with his feet swaying in the water. However, Flame-eater Child was nowhere to be found.

“Young Noble, where is Flame-eater?” Ming Shi asked.

Li Qiye got out of the water and Yunyun helped him put his shoes back on.

“Back to where he came from.” Li Qiye said.

“What was that flame earlier?” Goldcrest asked.

He answered with a smile, nothing else. The group couldn’t believe it because that inferno earlier could destroy the world.

“Let’s go, I don’t know if Shadowrider is still in Demon. I’m a little more interested now.” Li Qiye said, getting back to the original goal.

Prior to this, Li Qiye was able to pinpoint Shadowrider’s direction. Now, traces have been lost.

They traveled to the last known place of Shadowrider’s location - a mountain range with the appearance of a coiling dragon.

“Not here, interesting.” Li Qiye said while standing at the highest point.

“The clues are gone now?” The youths were surprised since Li Qiye had always been in control.

“A stench of blood is concealing everything. Quite thick too, seems to be a deity.” Li Qiye said before moving toward the cliff.

The group followed him and saw a magnificent scene. The two girls became emotional since this was their first time visiting this place.

“Where is this place?” Ming Shi asked.
