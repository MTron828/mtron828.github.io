Chapter 4905: Looking For Someone

Bloodsea traveled the world as a lone wolf - no friends and families as companions. He didn’t have a home yet the entire world was his home.

“Looks like you have been complacent recently with training.” Li Qiye glanced at him and said.

This startled Jian Yunyun so she winked repeatedly at him. After all, the guy could become angry and chop both of them down in this wilderness.

Most importantly, Bloodsea clearly focused on his cultivation - nothing else. Therefore, Li Qiye’s comment was a slap to the face.

The old man stared at Li Qiye in a serious manner. Though he didn’t show any anger, Yunyun felt a biting chill. The temperature around them became colder.

She winked at him more, implying that he should apologize right away or praise the old man.

Alas, Li Qiye ignored her and continued playing with the bonfire. This drove her angry and nervous since she didn’t want to die in such a silly manner.

“I’ve been busy looking for someone.” Bloodsea eventually looked away and the chill dispersed.

“Who is it?” Yunyun heaved a sigh of relief and curiosity got the best of her.

“Phenomena Conqueror.” The old man answered.

“Phenomena? He’s even more talented than Conceal Conqueror.” Yunyun blurted out.

Phenomena was one generation before Conceal. In terms of actual timeline, he was from the same generation as Heavenpeak Conqueror who was eventually killed by Conceal.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Keep in mind that Conceal was always praised for her superb talent. Alas, everyone agreed that Phenomena was superior in this regard.

He came from Lunar Lineage and had access to one of the Nine Heavenly Scriptures - Hallowed Three Forms. He trained with the mortal version.

As his cultivation improved, Lunar also enjoyed immense prosperity. Everyone believed that it would one day rival Untethered and Deity.

This was not unprecedented in its long history. Its progenitor, Nightmoon Conqueror, was strong enough to roam all six continents.

She oppressed Deity and the upper alliances. In her rage, she attacked Celestial Court and its Sword Emperor didn’t dare to fight her.

Heaven Burial Conqueror had to step up instead. The battle affected the landscape of all continents. In the end, Celestial Court activated its formations yet she still managed to leave. From then on, no one dared to provoke her.

Unfortunately, Lunar declined for many eras afterward. This all changed with the appearance of Phenomena Conqueror. 

Due to his talent, they thought that they could return to the golden age. Alas, this didn’t go as planned.

“I heard that he had left long ago since he had four dao fruits, he should be in the upper continents now.” Yunyun said softly.

Her speculation was reasonable since conquerors and dao lords didn’t want to stay here after possessing three to four dao fruits. Conceal and Eight-stallion were rare exceptions.

“He didn’t.” Bloodsea responded.

“You are quite sure of this. Moreover, you think that something had happened to him, and that’s why you’re trying to find him. If he’s dead, you must at least see the corpse, right?” Li Qiye said.

Bloodsea nodded after a moment of silence.

“Impossible, he had four dao fruits before Conceal made her debut. Heavenpeak only had one fruit as well. The only conqueror who can fight him back then was Truth Conqueror, but this being should be in isolated cultivation.” Yunyun couldn’t believe it.

“So it’s a dragon lord.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmm… not many dragon lords can kill a conqueror with four dao fruits.” Yunyun said: “Untethered’s Stone Ox is one.”

Alas, she didn’t want to speak on this matter anymore. Stone Ox was a supreme ancestor of Untethered, the only person in the lower continents with seven sacred fruits.

For some reason, he didn’t leave the lower continents, not even Untethered. According to conventional wisdom, even a six-fruit dragon lord would have a hard time killing Phenomena Conqueror. It had to be someone stronger.

For example, Divine Empress Dowager, Wild Dragon, and Stompheaven from Heaven Burial all had six sacred fruits. Nonetheless, they wouldn’t be able to kill Phenomena Conqueror.

“It’s not Stone Ox.” Bloodsea said with absolute certainty and convinced her.

“Why are you so sure that he is still here, Senior?” Yunyun asked.

“We are good friends.” Bloodsea said, catching the girl off guard.

This didn’t make sense because Phenomena was a prestigious conqueror while Bloodsea was a heinous villain. Moreover, Phenomena should be considerably older.

On the other hand, if they were good friends, Phenomena should have said something before leaving the lower continents. Thus, Bloodsea had a reason for doubt.

“Those from Lunar don’t know either?” She asked while looking at the bonfire: “Our empress dowager is missing as well.”

“When?” Bloodsea gazed at her.

Her neck hurt a little as if a white blade was inches away.
