Chapter 4895: Coronation

All eyes were on Li Qiye. The members of the dynasty didn’t know how to feel either.

At first, disappointment and anxiety overwhelmed them after the dao lord was replaced by an unknown junior. None of them was convinced of Li Qiye’s ability to reign. They believed that declination and even a total collapse were inevitable. Who knows if they could even survive?

As for the guests, they felt frightened and astounded. Some came to be polite but most were here to watch the show. They thought that Eight-stallion was a slanting pagoda on the verge of collapse, perhaps the coronation would trigger the fall.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Alas, this new king somehow managed to kill four monsters in one go and injured Wild Dragon. Most importantly, he didn’t reveal an unstoppable cultivation or special technique.

He was neither a dao lord nor a dragon lord, just an ordinary person. He utilized a pair of tongs to pick up a piece of barely-heated charcoal.

However, it was strong enough to burn dragon lords. Calling it an immortal stone or the greatest of the fire affinity wouldn’t be an exaggeration.

The crowd and dynasty members stole glances at the brazier, wanting to see the charcoal inside.

Many recalled Eight-stallion Dao Lord’s unique and unbreakable immortal shield. Now, the dynasty also had this brazier. Was its treasury this frightening? Just one brazier was enough to take on the whole world.

Of course, the members of the dynasty knew that it didn’t belong to them. In fact, they were livid at Li Qiye for wanting to destroy the imperial palace. Who would have thought that this would end up saving them?

“Chaos will have stability henceforth.” A knowledgeable big shot sighed and said. Most of the active villains in Chaos have been slain in action.

This was something Eight-stallion Dao Lord couldn’t do. The villains were scattered and the dynasty didn’t have enough forces to deal with them all at the same time. Moreover, Wild Dynasty was always lurking as well.

However, the coronation attracted many of them. They came hoping to share a piece of the pie and to see the fall of Eight-stallion. This ended up being the end of them since they couldn’t get away from Soaring Stallions and their commanders.

In the past, Venerable Dragon God had led Soaring Stallions on punitive expeditions before. Alas, it was impossible to cover all of Chaos.

Li Qiye relied on the coronation to kill the big shots in one go. This feat made everyone think differently of him.

They waited patiently until he opened his eyes and pulled back his feet from Demoness’ soft pillows.

She then put his shoes back on his feet. No one said anything during this process.

“This servant wishes to contribute to your cause, your Majesty. Warship is ready for any order.” She kneeled before him, speaking in a soft yet enchanting manner - always inciting the lust in men.

She referred to herself as a “servant” and offered the service of her ship as well. Keep in mind that she didn’t do this back during the previous administration. Her pact with Eight-stallion Dao Lord was personal and didn’t involve Warship.

“Not all can read the situation and be flexible.” He praised with a smile.

“I am but an insect before you, please show mercy.” She said.

“Very well, I have taken certain things into consideration and will pardon you.” He glanced at the ship in the sky and waved his hand.

“Your Majesty’s benevolence has no bounds. I will forever remember this and toil for you.” She said.

Many looked down on her for this. After all, she was one of the Ten Monsters but now, look at how subservient she was. This didn’t befit the qualities of a cultivator.

The other monsters who were burning didn’t beg for mercy as much as she did. As for her, it looked as if she considered being stepped on by him the greatest honor.

“Rise.” He smiled.

She kowtowed again before slowly getting up and standing next to him. No one could connect this new woman to her previous self.

Members of the dynasty were vexed as well. She didn’t do this for their dao lord nor lowered her status purposely in the past. They found this rather shameful.

“Alright, let bygones be bygones. Everything ends here.” Li Qiye chuckled and suddenly took off his imperial seal, placing it on A’zhui’s neck instead.

He then carried her to the throne and let her down. He patted her small face and said: “What a joyous occasion, the coronation of the next king.”

The young girl woke up from being moved around, completely confused by the situation. She was now sitting on the throne and her father’s seal was hanging around her neck.

“Your Majesty!” Northern Monarch and Venerable Dragon God shouted.

Everyone else felt the same astonishment. The coronation was supposed to be Li Qiye’s but now, A’zhui became the main character.

“She’s your new king now.” Li Qiye smiled and walked away.

Firerage instinctively followed him but he smiled: “Guard Commander, your mission is finished. You should be protecting the new king, not following me.”

Firerage stopped in his tracks, not knowing what to do.
