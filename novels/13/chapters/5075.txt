Chapter 5076: You Rule

This galaxy remained relatively untouched. Alas, the massive cosmic dragon was now laying beneath Li Qiye’s foot.

The punch obliterated its flames and showed that resistance was futile. It had enough power to obliterate the dragon on top of the entire fragmented epoch.

At this point, Ming Shi also stood on top of the dragon. She was smaller than a speck of dust compared to this colossal creature.

She finally got to see a divine beast and not just any divine beast - a cosmic dragon.

“You may enter a pact with it.” Li Qiye told her.

“W-what?” Ming Shi didn’t understand.

“You and this cosmic dragon, and all the other divine beasts too, will co-exist together.” Li Qiye smiled.

In other words, she’ll be in charge of this remnant epoch.

“I… I can’t, I’m just an insignificant speck of dust.” It took her awhile before she could answer.

Her reaction was understandable. She was only a regular disciple from Untethered.

Although she was a genius, she came to understand just how insignificant she was after seeing so many top masters recently. The difference between her and them was insurmountable.

In order to be considered an insect, one should at least be as strong as her Senior Aunt. She herself believed that she was only the level of a speck of dust.

Now, he wanted her to control this peerless cosmic dragon? This was more absurd than putting Goldcrest Young Noble in charge of a deity branch.

“I am not worthy.” She concluded.

He tapped her shoulder and said: “You are virtuous, and that is the only requirement. I could have found someone strong but they wouldn’t have a heart like yours. Your kindness paves the way for peaceful coexistence.”

“I can’t! I’m just a little rabbit, no, we can’t do this. Even if I cultivate for another trillion years, I still won’t be as strong as this ancestral dragon.” She became afraid.

“Trust me, if I say you can do it, you can.” He smiled and stared at her.

She calmed down after looking into his eyes and began to think.

“Can I refuse?” She eventually asked.

“No.” He shook his head.

Ming Shi understood Li Qiye by this point and that his words were final.

She grabbed his hand and complained: “If I had known about this, I would have agreed to roam the plains with the old monkey, or maybe taking care of the unicorns wouldn’t be so bad either. Do you know how much responsibility you are placing on me?”

“If you had chosen either of the first fortunes, you would have ended up here eventually, the same with taking up this responsibility.” He argued.

“Why was I born to suffer this heavy burden?” She was dissatisfied.

“It’s because of your heart, that’s why you will accept it. You could have been a free rabbit or a shepherd and eventually, you still have sought me out in the future.”

“Why would I try to find you?” She grumbled.

“Because this is destined. If the result is the same, then why not take a shortcut and avoid having you beg me for help later?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmph.” She snorted and her nose twitched.

Li Qiye then turned toward Golden Dragon and Tyrant Tiger: “This girl will live with you henceforth. You might consider this as a shackle on the divine beasts’ bloodline but I have made my intention clear. She will absolutely treat them well.”

The two stared at Ming Shi and realized that the situation has been decided. Plus, designating Ming Shi was a much better outcome than their expectation. After all, they were not going to be enslaved.

In reality, no one would miss having such a powerful force but Li Qiye gave them freedom.

“Thank you, Young Noble.” The dragon bowed sincerely. Li Qiye had indeed given them a more-than-fair deal.

The tiger who was annoyed with Li Qiye also bowed.

“I am done here, so I’ll be leaving.” Li Qiye said.

Ming Shi stared at him, feeling reluctant to part. Alas, this was inevitable.

The battle between Conceal Conqueror and Li Qiye was known by everyone on the lower continents.

Conceal Conqueror showing up again was surprising enough but this time, it was another challenge.

Her opponent was renowned for his previous feats in battle. At first, those who didn’t know him wondered who he was to be worthy of this challenge.

Alas, after hearing about his exploits, they gasped and thought that it would be an amazing battle.

“Is he really this strong?” A listener remained skeptical.

His friend who had seen Li Qiye in action said: “Yes, he killed dragon lords and demon gods like nothing. I think he might even kill Conceal Conqueror.”

“She managed to kill Eight-stallion Dao Lord last time, who will come out ahead now?” People started speculating on the outcome.

The might of Conceal Conqueror had permeated the heart of the inhabitants in the lower continents. Most thought that she would once again be the victor. However, those who had seen Li Qiye in action before completely disagreed.

As for the ancient ancestors, they wondered about her goal. She fought Eight-stallion Dao Lord for something. It seemed to be the same case for this next challenge.

Anyone could tell that she was willing to pay any price necessary for it. Curiosity aside, they had enough awareness to not interfere because this was most likely the command of Celestial Court. None wanted to mess with a hungry tiger’s food.

Next full moon, Heaven Summit - this was the time and place of the battle.

Numerous cultivators and ancestors have arrived before the chosen date. Some have traveled a considerable distance to get here. Everyone knew to keep a safe distance from the peak itself.

In fact, the crowd seemed far bigger than during her previous battle with Eight-stallion Dao Lord.
