Chapter 4773: Skylight

Li Qiye crossed through perilous natural forces, dao seals, and numerous barriers before reaching a forbidden zone.

Here existed a faint shadow of a great tree. When in full bloom, it could blot out the entire world. Its illusory nature was due to its physical body not being in the current dimension. 

Nonetheless, he could still sense the mightiest power brimming from it, capable of reducing space into dust. Ancient ancestors and top monarchs wouldn’t be able to withstand the pressure.

Alas, putting its frightening nature aside, no one would be able to escape the temptation of getting closer.

Plus, those aware of what it was would be overwhelmed with emotions, especially greed. This was none other than the primordial tree.

Of course, it was only an illusory reflection in spite of its suppressive nature. Thus, one could only imagine the power contained in the real tree.

According to the legends, those capable of climbing up the tree would be granted a great fortune. For example, Puresun Dao Lord and the duck egg buyer both won a dao fruit, eventually turning into immortal figures in history.

Thus, despite it being a mere reflection, others still wouldn’t give up the chance of climbing it regardless of the danger.

On the other hand, Li Qiye was not here for the tree. Each step took him through one dimension. He flashed back and forth from one plane to another.

This lasted for an unknown amount of time before he reached his destination - a zone devoid of anything else.

Cultivators would lose their power because the grand dao and laws didn’t exist here. Only a single sphere of light with incredible intensity could be spotted.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

The sphere didn’t look special at all, only resembling a spatial point connecting one dimension to another.

The thing of note was when standing in this area and looking up to note the “skylight”. This wasn’t a skylight found in a building but rather, a passage that could reach the nine firmaments - a path to the high heaven.

Li Qiye stood in front of the spatial point and looked upward to peer at the deepest crevices of the sky.

This action would instill fear into peerless existences and make them feel as if everything belonging to them was taken away; a pair of eyes seemed to be looking down at them as well. This naturally creeped them out.

In fact, the feeling Li Qiye got was that it was viewing him as an ant just like everyone else. An air of domination manifested - that whatever this being was could erase everything in the blink of an eye.

Li Qiye maintained his gaze toward the unknown. Although the looming power could strike at any moment, he persevered despite facing a real risk.

“Hey, bastard heaven.” He said.

No response came from above and the suppression stopped. The terrible feeling and the faint power also disappeared.

Li Qiye has successfully opened a skylight without facing any consequences, not something the overlords from the forbidden zones and burial grounds could do.

Standing here was foolish since a heavenly tribulation could drop at any moment. They feared this the most - the one thing likely to destroy them.

This was no longer their epoch. Being exposed to the high heaven was akin to courting death. The mightiest tribulation would descend and deliver them from life.

Li Qiye only smiled after sensing the dispersion. Amusingly enough, he might be on top of the list to be slain by the high heaven, above the dark overlords as well.

Nonetheless, he didn’t wonder why and continued his task. He touched the light sphere with his finger, prompting it to glow brighter.

A dao law flew out of his forehead and entered the sphere. This seemed to be a key.

“Buzz.” He was instantly teleported to a dimension unreachable by others.

He then looked up and saw a massive item.
