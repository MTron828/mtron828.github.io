Chapter 4798: Kick Him While He’s Down

“Now!” Dao Sanqian became resplendent with light gushing from his body.

“Bam!” He took one step forward and caused the world to shake as if he was just as heavy.

“What is he doing?!” Many blurted in astonishment.

“Buzz.” Cosmic Lord gathered his power as well. Each strand of golden light oozing from him contained boundless weight and dao. They turned into golden swords.

“They want to attack Li Qiye for the heavenly treasure!” This was obvious to all spectators.

They turned toward Li Qiye and saw that he was still meditating and didn’t move an inch. He seemed to have entered a zen state and knew nothing about the outside world.

From start to finish, these men didn’t give up hope. They knew Li Qiye was immensely powerful but still had plans to kill him for the treasure and the gemstone.

“No wonder why Cosmic Lord wanted to leave True Immortal.” A few people understood this right away.

Cosmic Lord coveted the treasures. All would be well in the case of success. However, if they were to fail, he might drag True Immortal down with him. If Li Qiye’s wrath extended further, he might destroy the entire sect.

Cosmic Lord knew full well what he was doing along with the consequences, hence the need to leave True Immortal.

“I doubt that it is just a whim, they must have planned this a while ago.” A high elder whispered.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

By this three, they believed that the two of them have planned to attack Li Qiye even before his injuries despite knowing his power. Obtaining those artifacts would make them peerless even from a historical perspective.

“Senior Brother!” Enveloping Monarch didn’t expect this.

The other ancient ancestors felt the same, aware that they were nothing more than ants before Li Qiye. Though he had heavenly injuries on him right now, no one knew his current fighting prowess. Perhaps he could still crush them without any problem.

Because of this, Enveloping Monarch had given up despite their previous feud. He considered this suicidal and didn’t want to bring his sect down as well.

In fact, he was ready to let Li Qiye kill him because resistance was futile. He found this pre-meditated plan to be an awful decision.

“This is the only opportunity to become immortalized in history!” Dao Sanqian said: “Brother, lend me your strength.”

Enveloping hesitated for a while before gritting his teeth: “Very well.”

The two of them have been best friends for eras now and were ready to die for each other regardless of the situation. Though Enveloping thought that this was hopeless, he still agreed to help. He pointed his spear at Li Qiye, ready to die for a friend.

“My three thousand dao!” Dao Sanqian roared and an explosion erupted, releasing bright particles all over the battlefield.

They became the main focus as three thousand grand dao emerged in a magnificent manner. They connected the realms and supported the stars, capable of deriving various entities and gaining their power.

“Rumble!” Spectators and mortals from far away became frightened by this manifestation of power.

“He lives up to his fame.” One ancestor trembled.

Though all were ants before Li Qiye including Dao Sanqian, his power was still enough to crush regular cultivators.

“With three thousand dao he is an immortal.” Someone repeated a popular phrase regarding Dao Sanqian.

“Dao Spear!” Cosmic Lord roared and raised his hand. Lightning bolts obeyed his summon and rained down. He gathered and turned them into a lightning spear.

“Crackling!” Lighting coursed around him. Even his eyes brimmed with this affinity. He turned into a god of lightning and used its power as a spear, something resembling a heavenly tribulation.

“Immovable Spear!” Enveloping threw caution to the winds and raised his spear up in the air, seemingly wanting to piece the sky vault.

It immediately grew larger and looked like a world pillar. After loud explosions, it split into countless divine spears with pulsing runes. The heavy energy spears could sink this continent without any issue.

“They’re using their best techniques.” One spectator said.

“Can Li Qiye handle this given his current injuries?” Another expert wondered.

Everyone else felt the same way. A healthy Li Qiye would obliterate these three but now, they wondered if he had enough strength to retaliate.
