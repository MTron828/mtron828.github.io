Chapter 5246: Let Me Handle This

“Imperial Attendant City doesn’t use ‘emperor’ as a title, right?” A youth whispered.

A senior shook her head in response: “No, Imperial Gate was usually in charge and the leaders were known as city lords.”

“The current leader is Suppression Conqueror, this is nonsense.” One crowd member snorted.

Outsiders had no problem with Suppression Conqueror being in charge. After all, he had eleven dao fruits and was rather capable.

Moreover, Hundred Dao was a part of Imperial Attendant. They followed the ancestral rules and took control as a result. No one else was more qualified than Suppression Conqueror.T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Under his leadership, there was a chance of Imperial Attendant becoming the leader of Imperial Alliance - a return to its golden age.

Some preferred to see the city flourishing under his reign than declining for the sake of legitimacy.

“I’ve heard of something like this regarding the very title of the city. Imperial Attendant, the word imperial implies an emperor. Rumor has it that City Lord Zi Yan and the others were waiting for someone.” An ancient ancestor said.

“It’s just a legend that is most likely fabricated by future descendants.” Another disagreed because this so-called emperor didn’t appear during the previous eras.

Hundred Dao and Suppression Conqueror didn’t recognize this legend and mission either, only the powers in the main branches such as Alchemy Dao. 

“Suppression, kneel before it is too late!” Resplendent Monarch shouted again.

Listeners thought that this was impossible. Although an eleven-fruit conqueror was not the strongest in the upper continents, he was still one of the best. Telling him to kneel before someone was an idiotic demand.

Suppression became annoyed and focused his gaze. The frightening aura became concentrated and forced weaker cultivators to the ground.

Resplendent Monarch and the other ancient ancestors couldn’t handle the sudden increase and staggered backward.

“Hmph.” Li Qiye’s old servant took one step forward and became a divine mountain capable of protecting the world for ages to come. The imperial aura couldn’t move him an inch, only enough to make his robe flutter.

“Who may you be, Fellow Daoist?” Suppression became serious after seeing this. He couldn’t believe that this old servant was able to stop his pressure so easily.

“Just a servant.” To which the old man responded.

Listeners couldn’t believe it. They took a closer look and could tell that he was frightening, just not the ceiling of his power. Why would he be a servant?

Suppression had never experienced this situation before. He met numerous powerful conquerors and dao lords on top of seeing the apex ones. However, none of them had such a powerful servant.

“It’s alright, let me handle this.” Li Qiye gently patted the old man’s shoulder.

The latter bowed and respectfully retreated to the back, closing his eyes and not saying anything else.

Powerful existences could offer their service and allegiance but never in this manner. For example, the alliances had twelve-fruit conquerors working for them. However, they remained imperious and never needed to call themselves ‘servants’.

Nonetheless, the crowd didn’t have time to think and quietly observed Li Qiye.

“He’s the one who changed the eighteen images of the dragon lords.” Someone recognized him.

“How the hell did he do it?” A big shot found this astonishing.

“I heard a rumor of him being Duality Master’s descendant or even son.” A third joined in.

“Duality Master…” This title alone instilled awe into listeners.

He was a man who didn’t cultivate yet could stand on the same level as apex beings. He remained neutral in the conflict and could have a drink at either Heaven or Imperial Alliance.

In fact, tales of him traveling to Celestial Court have been passed down as well. He had a dao discussion with the emperors there and this happened in Immortal Dao City as well. 

“In one ear and out the other, I was going to let you off easily but now, seems like I have to kick you off that throne.” Li Qiye yawned and said.

Suppression naturally didn’t take the comment in stride. His eyes flashed menacingly to the horror of the audience, but Li Qiye remained unaffected.

Some who had seen Li Qiye before didn’t understand. How did he always remain calm and aloof regardless of the situation? This was so similar to Duality Master.

“Who are you?” Suppression was frustrated because he couldn’t see through Li Qiye. For one second, the guy seemed like an unfathomable master but in the next, he was just another passersby on the street.
