Chapter 5243: Imperial Attendant Awaits The Emperor’s Return

The duel between Jadecure Conqueror and Darkflame Cauldron Emperor would decide the next ruler of Imperial Attendant City.

If the former were to win, Suppression Conqueror would have to return the dominion back to Imperial Gate. On the other hand, his success would allow him to slowly change the system and guidelines, allowing Hundred Dao to be in charge legitimately in the future.

“Rumble!” A lightning tribulation seemed to be forming above the city.

Waves of vines and leaves came together to form a barrier to stop any lightning bolt.

“An alchemy tribulation is forming.” An expert said: “Seems like a cauldron of Time-honed Longevity Pills. It’s about to be refined one hundred times now.”

“Her fire mastery is superb, can she catch up to Heavenly Master Yuan in the future?” Another alchemist commented.

Everyone understood that the presence of a tribulation indicated greatness - the finest grade of pills.

“If it’s really at the finest grade, then just three to five pills are enough to last for a very long time.” An ancient ancestor felt his heart beating faster.

Ancient ancestors wanted nothing more than longevity medicines, and the pills before them were the best of the best. Of course, Darkflame’s pills were effective as well, albeit carrying considerable side effects.

If cultivators had a choice, they would certainly pick Jadecure Conqueror’s longevity pills before Darkflame’s.

“Boom!” Jadecure Conqueror’s green inferno rushed above Darkflame’s cauldron and prevented further refinement.

“Looks like the victor is decided.” A few alchemists commented.

“Imperial Gate shall be in charge again.” The inhabitants of the city preferred this development - authority returning to the orthodox branch.

However, the imperial aura within the evil inferno intensified and made it stronger. Everyone became frozen since Darkflame seemed to be taken over by a conqueror. His inferno became more than ten times stronger.Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Boom!” It broke through the clouds and tore apart the conqueror’s fiery blockade, seizing the upper hand in the blink of an eye.

Jadecure’s cauldron released a fire dragon in retaliation. Alas, the dark inferno had become overwhelming.

“Why?!” Everyone became surprised by the sudden reversal.

“The cauldron emperor has been blessed by an extremely powerful conqueror.” An ancient ancestor said: “It must be Suppression Conqueror.”

“Cheaters!” Those on the side of Alchemy Dao shouted, feeling that the other side was cheating.

“Not quite.” A big shot familiar with the rules shook his head and said: “Jadecure Conqueror could have found someone to empower her as well, it’s just that her allies are weaker. Resplendent Monarch is the strongest but he can’t compete with Suppression Conqueror. This has been the case since the passing of Armor Conqueror.”

“I think Jadecure Conqueror will lose.” Spectators said while feeling sorry for her. It seemed like Suppression Conqueror was about to win again.

Back in the courtyard, Li Qiye observed the duel but he noticed something and got up to open the door.

He then saw a group of people who immediately kneeled in his presence - Resplendent Monarch, Gourdkeeper Monarch, Panacea Monarch, Hallowedsteel Monarch, Saintess Shao Yao, the ancestors of Imperial Gate…

“What is it?” Li Qiye’s brows furrowed.

Saintess Shao Yao looked up and said: “Young Noble, you are the lord of Imperial Attendant. Your servants await your return.”

“Please return to the palace and reign again, Young Noble.” Resplendent Monarch added respectfully.

“I’m afraid you got the wrong person.” Li Qiye shook his head, not interested in taking over Imperial Attendant.

“Our founder, City Lord Zi Yan, drew your portrait, Young Noble.” An ancestor from Imperial Gate presented a treasure box with both hands. He opened the box and presented the scroll to Li Qiye.

He sighed and opened the scroll to see a vivid picture of himself and Zi Yan’s signature.

At the bottom was another line - waiting for your return, Young Master.

“Buzz.” The signature started moving and exuding a violet light. This energy rushed out and turned into an ethereal woman possessing a graceful appearance with a mature charm.

She appeared solemn and dignified, seemingly capable of commanding an army with a simple gesture.

She started this city along with the wise sages to wait for their emperors. Alas, her time ran out during Grand Dao War. After seeing Li Qiye, the ethereal image kneeled before him.

He sighed and gently touched her cheek: “An oath lasting an eternity, was it worth it?’

“Young Master.” The image said softly. She outlasted tribulations and calamities due to a single belief - that the young master would return one day to rule again. Imperial Attendant City was meant for him alone.
