Chapter 5536: Taking Credit

Li Qiye radiated the primordial light while forming a mudra and uttering a mantra: “The dao returns to nothingness, nothingness returns to silence, depart from this world…”

The footprints became brighter and illuminated every inch of the land. The rays emanating from them intertwined and harmonized with one another. His mantra also echoed and turned the footprints into primordial runes.

The culminating chapter came from the start of the world. It included the various affinities that shape reality - yin and yang, reincarnation, and anything that could derive life…

Majestic figures slowly emerged amidst the intensifying primordial light. Some were swinging their swords while others roared, shattering the myriad realms…

During this fleeting moment, they ceased their attacks and sheathed their weapons…

The figures included Crimson Emperor, Immortal Emperor Can Long, Immortal Emperor Ba Zhen, Immortal Emperor Hu Yue, Nether Heaven Emperor, and many more…

Time started reversing and the damages caused by these top cultivators ceased to exist. All eyes were on Li Qiye.

The devastating storms gradually stopped and became normal again. Laws and orders returned and the broken fabrics of reality were mended.

“Return from whence we came, let it all go…” Li Qiye chanted and primordial light surged around him.

“Boom!” Eventually, a seal descended and stabilized the region, heralding an everlasting tranquility.

Everything fell into the proper place again. The majestic figures slowly dissipated and became countless particles.

The mighty techniques with world-shattering potential - whether it be dao flames or light curse - were reduced to particles as well. They scattered on the ground and assisted the healing process.

Their energy turned into soil, mountains, and valleys. With the region reformed, seeds sprouted and turned into vegetation and trees.

Water started streaming through the cracks and formed streams. They came together to form rivers and eventually, the low-lying areas turned into oceans…

Life came next with birds and fish, replacing the destruction. The primordial power gestated all living beings. One could see dao runes with a faint light among the leaves, trees, and all else.

“It’s a paradise now…” Niu Fen murmured after seeing the drastic shift.

The rage and various emotions of the fallen combatants couldn’t be dispelled in the past. They never found peace until now with Li Qiye’s arrival.

They were able to move on while the devastation left behind was fixed by Li Qiye. New lifeforms sprouted and the land flourished. In the near future, many will be able to call this their home.

Niu Fen became sentimental because this was beyond the force of a single cultivator. He and the other ancient cultivators wouldn’t be able to duplicate this task.

Li Qiye finally stopped to take a look at the new land. He thought that it could become a paradise in the future.

“We’re leaving.” He patted his hands after finishing the task. Now, this area no longer had anything to do with the previous battles.

“Okay!” Niu Fen was happy to see this development and carried Li Qiye away.

The cloud, on the other hand, took its time since it was curious about this new creation.

“Buzz.” It suddenly released runes that seep into the ground, becoming one with the land. Most wouldn’t be able to detect this change.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

With that, it caught up to Li Qiye and Niu Fen. Li Qiye shook his head and smiled: “Want to take credit by planting that seed? You want that to be your world?”

The cloud stared at Li Qiye before looking back at the new world, seemingly rather satisfied.

Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t mind in the slightest.
