Chapter 3768: White Tiger Lance

The lance was infinitely close to being a dao lord weapo. It has been blessed and refined by a dao lord so to a certain extent, it contained one’s power.

The third dao lord of Righteous had the title of Lightgrasp. His disciple was the sect master of Righteous during that generation, a white tiger demon.

This demon was extremely powerful at peak Heavenly Sovereign. He took off one of his fangs and used it to create a weapon using a top true fire. Unfortunately, this weapon couldn’t reach perfection despite numerous refinements.

His master could no longer watch and decided to help fix the flaws of the weapon.

At the moment of completion, the grand dao resonated with the roar of a tiger. This became the famous White Tiger Lance of Righteous. Its origin and history resulted in a mighty weapon.

It wasn’t the strongest weapon in the sect but the generational sect masters kept it around. Therefore, it was a symbol of authority.

When the scion wielded this weapon, his aura became increasingly impressive. There seemed to be a divine tiger with claws and fangs capable of tearing the world and the grand dao apart.

Its bestial aura was dreadful and shiver-inducing. The spectators’ throat felt itchy as they became overwhelmed with an image of a tiger ripping their throat.

The spectators and Hu Ben took a deep breath after seeing the armed scion.

“Show me the majestic defense of Smoke-fire Fortress.” The scion smiled.

By this point, most realized that the rumor of him defeating his sect master was true. This lance was usually kept by the sect master. Now, since he had it, the implication was obvious.

“Start the fire walls.” Hu Ben roared.

“Rumble!” The ground shook violently. Next, pillars floated up from the walls but upon closer inspection, they also resembled square-shaped cauldrons.

“Poof! Poof! Poof!” The pillars became ablaze just like kindled cauldrons.

The flames rushed to the sky, seemingly intending on incinerating everything with its scorching heat.

The fortress resembled an erupting volcano with lava oozing out in an endless and all-devouring manner.

The crowd also saw the members of Vigorous Tiger channeling all of their grand dao power and vitality onto a runic platform carved with chaos stones.

Next came dao runes appearing on the walls of the fortress. They connected together to form dao chains enveloping the fortress.

As the crowd tried to digest the new development, the runic walls increased in size continuously, enough to stop all enemies from invading. This in combination with the dao chains created what seems to be the most fortified wall in existence.

The flames from the pillars earlier gathered in front of the physical wall and manifested into a fiery shield. As more flames joined the mix, the shield also became gigantic with countless layers.

This divine wall empowered by the dao pierced the clouds, ready to withstand all offenses.

“I didn’t know the fortress has something like this.” Many experts were amazed to see this in person.

Peace has made people forget about what this fortress was capable of. Minor skirmishes didn’t warrant activating this level of defense.

“Smoke-fire Divine Wall, we’re lucky to see it in person.” An expert from a large sect said.

“It doesn’t have a problem stopping multiple armies.” One youth sighed and said.

“One move should be fine.” Another genius nodded.

Hu Ben felt better after seeing the fortress’ most powerful defense - the wall and barrier. They have been blessed by numerous Heavenly Sovereigns and were currently empowered by the soldiers. It should be able to withstand any attack, at least for a period. He thought that it shouldn’t have a problem with one move from the scion.

“Not bad. Okay, try this.” The scion smiled and said.

“Buzz.” His lance became resplendent in the next second. Bright pulses continuously spread, seemingly reaching the deeper dimensions.

The current spatial dimension was being overwhelmed by the pulses. Once there was enough light, ten suns manifested into reality.

“Ten suns?!” Someone blurted out.

The world became dried from their unbearable heat. People had a hard time keeping their eyes open from their radiance. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

“Ten-sun Grasp, Skygrasp Dao Lord’s technique!” An old cultivator shouted.

The young ones exchanged glances after hearing this and shuddered.

Everyone knew about the scion’s expertise with the Evil Devourer Seven Chapters. Now, he also used Heaven Devourer Dragon Guard and Ten-sun Grasp. This meant that he knew the arts of three dao lords.

Just learning one was amazing, enough to prove that one was a great genius. But the scion knew three separate merit laws?

“A supreme genius.” The most prideful youths in the audience felt inadequate.

“Completely peerless.” An ancestor sighed.

They completely understood how he managed to defeat the sect master of Righteous.

“Break!” The scion made his move and threw his lance forward, causing the suns to move as well. The suns were the focus of the technique, not the lance.
