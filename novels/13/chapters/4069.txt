Chapter 4070: Mysterious Cellar

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

With Li Qiye’s guidance and time, Ning Zhu and the servants finally cleaned up the plain. The place didn’t return to its golden age but its buried foundation could finally be seen.

It resembled an ancient diagram with numerous intersecting lines and fortresses - this was the work of a godly creator.

One could say that this appeared to be a universe being engraved onto the ground. The lines were too confusing and obscured, enough to make spectators dizzy.

With this task finished, Li Qiye entered a hidden cellar inside the mansion. The descendants of the Tang didn’t have a clue about this cellar.

Perhaps the early generations had an idea about this cellar. As time passed, the method to open the cellar became lost.

To be exact, this cellar wasn’t a part of the mansion but rather, it was a part of the entire plain. Its very existence was created by a supreme power, not from physical digging.

From an architectural viewpoint, this cellar was the central hub, the very nucleus of the plain. All the lines and fortresses were built around and from this cellar.

“Crack!” When Li Qiye activated the door, the bricks on the ground started shifting into different spots - a process looking like a paper fan spreading.

“What is this place?” Ning Zhu didn’t notice the existence of this cellar at all.

Given her cultivation, her divine intents could have scanned the mansion countless times. A secret cellar wouldn’t have been able to escape her scout.

This meant that the creator must have used a powerful shielding method to hide the cellar. Their power far exceeded Ning Zhu.

“It’s a secret purposely guarded even from the descendants.” Li Qiye smiled and entered the cellar with Ning Zhu right behind him.

She was surprised to see the content, or rather, the lack of anything. The entire cellar was empty.

Since someone put in the effort to hide it, it should have contained a wondrous treasury of manuals and artifacts. This was not the case and she didn’t even spot a single coin on the ground. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“There’s nothing here.” She said. Of course, she wasn’t dumb enough to actually believe this and continued scouting the area.

She eventually noticed thousands of tiny holes on the walls, ceiling, and floor. They all had the same size and a square shape - clearly purposely added. The only thing disorderly were their positions. It was tough to pinpoint a pattern.

“What are they for?” She asked, unable to see the meaning behind the numerous holes.

The creator must have hid a great secret here. It’s just that she couldn’t see it right now.

“To store money.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hmm?” She didn’t get it right away.

Li Qiye took out a square-shaped refined jade that was rather small in size. Chaos energy erupted right away. It exuded rays of light as if the jade contained a galaxy. The power greeting her was of the dao lord level.

“Dao Lord Refined Jades.” Ning Zhu had seen it before but was still surprised every time.

Not to mention regular cultivators, these jades were special and expensive even for her and her kingdom.

“Click.” Li Qiye inserted the square jade into a hole on the wall - a perfect match.

“I see, they’re used to store refined jades.” Ning Zhu understood right away.

Li Qiye then took out a bunch of square-shaped refined jades and told her: “Insert all of them.”

She followed his order and couldn’t wait to see the secret hidden in this cellar. By the time she nearly finished, she found that there were more than ten thousand holes.

It became obvious why the Tang eventually lost access to this cellar. They stopped viewing it with importance because ultimately, they didn’t have enough jades to fulfill this requirement.

Many cultivators tried their entire life and still wouldn’t be able to touch one Dao Lord Refined Jade, let alone ten thousand.

Only someone like Li Qiye would carry so many with him at a time. As for Wooden Sword, this sum would be guarded in their safest treasury.

“Buzz.” Once the last one was inserted, the refined jades in the holes became resplendent. The rays actually looked tangibly substantive and filled up the cellar from different angles. They began crossing and intertwining.
