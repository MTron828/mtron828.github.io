Chapter 4057: Eight-armed Prince

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The prince felt stifled by the ridiculous bid.

“One hundred million…” Everyone gasped and exchanged glances.

Everyone knew that ten million was an illogical price already, hence its availability until now.

The clan master himself knew that his terrible plain wouldn’t sell for ten million, let alone one hundred million.

“Does he really want to buy that crappy plain?” A spectator had no idea of Li Qiye’s wealth.

“Don’t you know he’s the richest in the world? He has billions of Dao Lord Refined Jades, this amount is nothing to him, akin to a grain of sand in the desert.” Someone else smiled wryly.

The clan master was trembling with excitement. He didn’t care about his image and loudly asked: “One hundred million, really?”

This was the same as having a pie fall down from the sky and knocking him unconscious. He started seeing stars from this crazy development.

“That depends. He might go even higher.” Li Qiye smiled.

The clan master calmed down and asked Starshooter Prince: “Your Highness, Young Noble Li bid one hundred million. Do you wish to continue?”

The prince was livid and unlike the clan master, he trembled with rage while feeling suffocated. He simply wanted to cause trouble for Li Qiye and the princess without thinking it through.

There was no chance of retaliation. Anyone else might be going overboard and wouldn’t be able to produce one hundred million.

The problem was Li Qiye had no problem in doing so. It was him who had difficulties.

A few million was fine with him. He could grit his teeth and afford it since he was still the prince of Starshooter.

As for one hundred million, if he risked everything in order to vent and buy this crappy plain, the royal ancestors would be the first to punish him.

“Sigh, don’t try to be a hero when you’re broke.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Take a look in the mirror first and realize how poor you and your country are. Stop wasting my time.”

“You… You…” The prince nearly vomited blood from anger but couldn’t come up with a retort.

As for the observers, they thought that Li Qiye was being too arrogant. Unfortunately, he had enough money to smash people to death. No one could do a thing to take him down a notch.

“Young Noble Li, is your bid still effective?” The clan master stopped paying attention to the prince and asked Li Qiye.

Normally, he would try to curry favor with the prestigious prince. This was no longer the case since a sky-high bid was waiting for him. It was best to make Li Qiye happy first.

“I’m a man of my words.” Li Qiye smiled: “It’s just one hundred million, if anyone else wants to play, let’s do it.”

“You’re right, Young Noble. Your words are worth more than gold and jade.” The clan master was more than willing to be Li Qiye’s grandson at this point. Nothing was more tempting than money.

“Gentlemen, would anyone else want to bid?” He still hoped that someone would want to play against Li Qiye.

However, he was disappointed since only silence answered him. No one wanted to take a risk of Li Qiye suddenly quitting because this plain was worthless. Most importantly, the majority didn’t have this much money in the first place.

“Young Noble Li, since no one else is bidding, the estates of the Tang belong to you. From now on, it is the Li’s Plain. I will go prepare the transfer paperwork right now.” His smile was as bright as a blooming flower.

This was akin to a dream manifesting into reality for him, hence his unrestrained jubilation.

“How can a territory in Armament Mountain be sold to an outsider?” However, a youthful voice interrupted his celebration. This newcomer had an ape head while everything else was normal. He wore a golden armor made out of silk and had eight arms, looking majestic and gallant like a hardened warrior. Each of his steps carried great momentum.

“Eight-armed Prince!” Someone shouted after seeing him.

“THe prince of Armament Mountain!” Other youths were in awe to see him.

Thus, the members of the tributaries came to greet him.

“That’s a main branch's member.” One of them commented from a distance.

A senior nodded in response: “Yes, he’s from God Ape Kingdom which is definitely part of the main branch. He’s a descendant of God Ape Dao Lord too, that bloodline is prestigious.”

“I think he’ll become the next successor since he has many elders and ancestors supporting him.” Another expert from the sect gossiped.

Currently, God Ape Kingdom was the leader of the demon branch in Armament Mountain. It had immense influence and authority there.

On the other hand, the current sect master was from another main branch belonging to Armament Dao Lord.

The former enjoyed great support from the seniors. Thus, the consensus was that he would become the next successor.

“He cultivates God Ape Dao Lord’s invincible merit law, Eight Treasures Splitting The Heaven. It’s understandable for him to inherit the sect.” One more cultivator commented.

This merit law was one of the top techniques in Armament Mountain so he would be a worthy successor.

“Your Highness.” The clan master of the Tang calmed down and bowed towards the prince.

“Sect Master Tang, this transaction is not allowed because the Tang’s plain is under the jurisdiction of Armament Mountain.” The prince said seriously. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Your Highness, my impression is that there is no such law in Armament Mountain. If it does exist, please show me which ancestral teaching it is from.” The clan master was unwilling to give up.

The prince’s expression soured after hearing this. This clan master dared to go against him?

Of course, the clan master didn’t care at this point. No one else would buy his plain at such a ridiculous price. He would die trying to get this deal finished, let alone offending the prince. Moreover, he wasn’t violating any rule either.

They might have been under the jurisdiction of Armament Mountain but this didn’t mean that they were actual members.

At the very worst, they would just move to another place and start over again with their newly-acquired wealth. They had no deep attachment to Armament Mountain anyway. Hallowed City was one potential destination.

“There’s no law but it pertains to public safety. You alone can’t make this decision.” The prince retorted.
