Chapter 5269: I’ve Seen You Before

She had a transcending fragrance rarely seen in the mortal world and soft curves where needed.

Their eyes were intertwined, allowing them to peer into the depths of each other’s souls. Everything was there but she seemed to be hiding it - a kin to a girl changing her hairstyle and forgetting about past worries.

“How strange.” Li Qiye said.

“What?” She asked.

“I feel like I have met you before.” He smiled.

Previous existence and memories were merely under wrap. However, he only had a faint impression of this woman.

“It’s because you’ve seen too many women.” She suddenly attacked with her knee. However, he also did the same and stopped her.

She raised her hands but he was even faster, intertwining his fingers with hers. This looked like two lovers flirting with each other but in reality, she attempted potentially fatal moves.

“I don’t deny that, but I don’t quite remember you.” Li Qiye said.

“Then we haven’t met.” She said, performing a vision attack. Rays from her eyes wanted to reduce him to ashes.

However, they somehow didn’t affect him at all. Even the explosion of the cosmo couldn’t affect him.

“Can you stop being so murderous? It’s fortunate that I can defend myself or I would be dead right now. Who cares about last names nowadays? I can change mine to Wang, okay?” Li Qiye joked.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Still annoying whether you’re a Li or a Wang!” She clenched her fists with enough power to refine the grand dao and the reincarnation cycle, wanting to crush Li Qiye’s fingers.

However, his fingers became soft and moldable, seemingly turning incorporeal. They slipped through her grip and bypassed her chest to reach her heart.

“All the Lis are scoundrels?” She released an eternal seal from her eyes at his dao foundation, wanting to destroy his dao heart.

Unsurprisingly, this was still not enough to take down his indomitable dao heart.

“What are you trying to hide from me?” He was surprised.

“Take a look all you want.” She suddenly changed her tone and embraced him, using a special dao of temptation.

“No.” He activated his dao heart to prevent being seduced.

Love whispers echoed in his ears - a touch of gentleness beneath the starry sky asking him to stay here forever and let go of all burdens.

Too often a man had given up everything to answer the call for love. A great general could abandon his armor and return home to the village to be with his love.

“Incredible, I was one step away from losing control.” Li Qiye maintained mental stability and praised her.

“This is still too low level.” Her brows furrowed as she changed again - channeling a valorous aura through him and painting a scene of a lover adorning him in armor and handing him a spear and shield. She, in full battle regalia, would fight alongside him fearlessly in perfect sync. As long as he was around, so would she. The endless path toward the grand dao couldn’t separate them.

“Even better, it seems like you do know me.” Li Qiye had to stabilize his dao heart again.

“I only know that I want to beat you up.” She glared fiercely at him but within her eyes was an indescribable feeling. The two aspects co-existed without any contradiction.

“Where did we meet?” He asked again because she had hidden everything.

“You don’t remember?” She said softly and her gaze became gentler.

However, when Li Qiye tried to peer into her mind, the gaze instantly entrapped him and attempted to destroy him.

With a single thought, he became eternal and indestructible.

“You can’t do it, my resolution can’t be melted by your softness.” He said while watching beads of sweat forming on her forehead.

“You’re the incapable one, otherwise, you would have descendants running all over.” She retorted.

“Having a lot of descendants doesn’t mean anything, they can be the neighbor’s children.” He smiled.

“The neighbor is in trouble as well, he has no time to be playing around.” She added more power to her gaze, turning it into a sharp blade.

“Wait, let me see.” He suddenly spotted something.

“See what? Should I undress myself or do you want to take them off?” She said aggressively.

“Either way works.” He smiled and finally became serious, gazing deep into her eyes with an unstoppable power.

It carried enough firepower to destroy three thousand worlds in a split second. This prompted her to utilize evasive techniques instead, becoming ethereal while still trapped beneath him.

“Do you dare to come?” Her voice came from a distance, ready to destroy both of them if he were to continue.

“Sigh, you’re putting me in a difficult situation. I can’t be so merciless toward a fair flower.” He sighed and stopped his gaze.

“Then stop thinking about unraveling it.” She appeared again, still as untamed and domineering as before.

Despite her stubbornness and clear annoyance toward him, he still enjoyed looking into her eyes.
