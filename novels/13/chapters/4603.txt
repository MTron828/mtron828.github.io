Chapter 4604: Engagement Bestowed

Golden Divine Fist was once the lord of Golden. However, he joined Worldbreaker and turned into a fist slave, eventually starting one of the great sects there.

Later on, Golden Fist Emperor also came to Worldbreaker in order to learn the fist dao. He came up with his own and also started another sect. The moment they started their sect, they essentially left Golden City as members. They also didn’t use any merit law or technique from Golden so the connection was no longer there.

It seemed that these great geniuses from Golden City were drawn to Worldbreaker for some reason.

Therefore, Golden City was not obligated to help Golden Gate. First, it has been reclusive for so long. Its members rarely showed up in the outside world.

The chance of success for this option was not high. Nonetheless, there was still a sliver of hope. On one hand, Golden Divine Fist was the city lord - truly a prestigious status while his descendant was a top genius. Most importantly, both never betrayed Golden City and merely chose to branch out.

There was no conflict of interest and if the current leaders of Golden cared enough about past sentiments, they might actually help.

“I think if Golden Fist Emperor personally asks for help, the city might come.” Jian Ming suggested.

Ye Tingrong nodded in agreement. She didn’t have enough clout to ask Golden City since she was only a junior. On the other hand, if her ancestor were to go himself, he could meet the old ancestors there whom he had great ties with in the past.

The chance of success here was up to eighty or nine percent, or so Jian Ming thought.

A while ago, Tingrong was at a loss but due to Li Qiye’s advice, there was still a fighting chance.

“Well, there is an even more direct and simple method, getting it done in the blink of an eye.” Li Qiye smiled.

“May I ask what it is?” She asked.

“Accept this brat as your companion and everything will be resolved with your wedding.” Li Qiye pointed at Jian Ming.

“Wedding?” She stared at Jian Ming, confused. She didn’t know why this would be a solution.

“No, Young Noble, this doesn’t sound right.” Jian Ming panicked and waved his hand repeatedly.

“That’s a good idea.” Xiao Xuan became excited. Her eyes flashed brightly as she said: “Brat, do it. If anyone is blind enough to interfere, I’ll beat them up for you.”

She started warming up after saying this, seemingly wanting nothing more than to fight the ancestors from True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao.

“Lady, please, love just doesn’t appear out of thin air.” Jian Ming turned red like a persimmon.

“You’re not satisfied with my arrangement? Why? Do you feel Miss Ye is unworthy or is there another reason? Speak.” Li Qiye said.

The blushing Jian Ming immediately explained himself: “Miss Ye, I don’t think you are unworthy at all, please don’t misunderstand.”

“Look at you now, it doesn’t feel wrong. Don’t try to understand fate, it can be wonderful and abrupt.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Young Noble…” The youth put on a pained expression and asked for mercy.

Tingrong, on the other hand, seemed far calmer. She nodded and said: “This is all happening too quickly, I am not offended at all, Fellow Daoist.”

She then asked for elaboration: “I don’t see why this is a solution though.”

“Our young noble will be your protector then. No one can stop a marriage bestowed by him.” Jian Ming had no choice but to explain.

Having said that, he also added: “But please, don’t get us wrong, we’re not trying to take advantage of the situation.”

“I see…” She stared at Li Qiye again, not spotting anything given her current vision. Would he really be able to protect them from the behemoths?

In her opinion, this was not possible. He alone couldn’t protect Golden Gate from True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao.

“So what if we’re taking advantage of the situation?” Xiao Xuan unhappily said: “If you don’t do it, there’s no hope for this girl. She will either be killed or at best, marry some random from a great power while her sect goes up in flames. If you fancy her, marry her and at least she won’t be a tool since there are feelings involved. Plus, there is nothing to worry about with the young noble and me taking action. All you two need to do are try your best and make some healthy babies.” FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Tingrong was surprised. This little girl spoke as if she was a supreme existence while others were only juniors or worms before her.

“Lady, can you spare me just once?” Jian Ming smiled wryly.

“What’s better for her? Marrying you or marrying someone from True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao?” Xiao Xuan didn’t relent.

“Well…” Jian Ming couldn’t answer.

The daoist elbowed him and smiled: “I can calculate for you and pick an auspicious date for the wedding. Of course, I can also choose an auspicious name for your baby later on.”

“Go away!” Jian Ming angrily shouted.

“It’s not a bad idea.” The scion had finished thinking about it and quietly added. This would be the best outcome for Tingrong if she didn’t hate Jian Ming.

In the other scenario, she wouldn’t know who her future husband would be. Plus, the person might mistreat her given the circumstances since she was just a tool to be used. The worst outcome would be the behemoths blatantly robbing and massacring all of Golden Gate, Tingrong included.

The question for him was - would Li Qiye be able to stop the behemoths? Tingrong wondered the same thing.
