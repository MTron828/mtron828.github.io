Chapter 4640: Tian Feng

“Who are you?” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

“Blood for blood, your life for his.” Her gaze made others feel a sharp prick in their chest.

“I’ve killed too many, state your name.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

Others exchanged glances after seeing this development.

“This brat has offended so many people, this seems to be his calling in life.” One expert murmured.

“Right, he offended True Immortal, Three Thousand Dao, and now Divine Dragon Valley.” A friend responded.

“Is he afraid of not having enough enemies?” A clan disciple said: “This case doesn’t matter though since this is a blood feud. There is no going back from this.”

“I wonder how he’ll leave this place alive.” A big shot became curious.

The saintess’ hatred only grew after she saw his attitude. The air suddenly became cold - a sign of her special fire technique. Some had to retreat because this was too much to take.

“I will cut you to pieces today.” She threatened.

“You and many others.” Li Qiye smiled, showing complete contempt toward the opponent.

She became livid and wanted to obliterate him right away to avenge her fallen brother. Moreover, he deserved death for his attitude alone.

Though she wasn’t on the same level as the five conquerors, she was still famous. Most importantly, she was Tian Feng’s fiancee. Any of her statuses was enough to intimidate others and command respect.

“Li, your dog life is mine. Anyone who tries to stop me will become the enemies of Voidburn Temple and Divine Dragon Valley.” She uttered.

This strong statement showed just how much she hated him. Of course, the crowd had no intention of stopping her.

Nonetheless, they thought that she was being too imperious because True Immortal Young Emperor and Speargrasp were here too. Of course, she was blinded by hatred and didn’t consider the implications.

Some started smirking, thinking that it was finally time for Li Qiye to go away for good.

“Bam!” A figure landed from above and caused a violent quake, ending with a large pit.

A torrential battle intent spread everywhere and struck crowd members hard like a hammer smash. Weaker cultivators were sent flying while vomiting blood.

These were only remnant battle intents, not a purposely-activated one. They could start a war and incite violence. This horrified the crowd members.

They took a good look and saw a tall, muscular youth. Despite his large frame, he didn’t give the impression of being brutish, only one of strength and domination.

He wore a tattered gray robe. It was damaged due to battles, not time. His hair was messy and draped downward. The winds had their way with his hair.

He lacked an air of nobility and regality. The only thing on him was a rampaging battle intent.

Those who had never seen him before would all have the same thought - that this man was obsessed with fighting. As a result, an instinctive fear overwhelmed them. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

True Immortal Young Emperor and Speargrasp were both top geniuses. Their appearance also intimidated the crowd.

However, their royal and indomitable auras felt righteous and proper. Though being suppressed was still frightening, they could still see the beauty of the dao.

This didn’t apply to this newcomer. Crowd members found themselves to be dragged into an inferno of war. This hellish world had nothing but fighting and death. The sky became dark and filled with despair.

“Tian Feng!” Many turned pale as they shouted his name.

“Tian Feng…” Some felt a chill coursing down their spine.

The battle stage suddenly became quiet. A while back, an air of excitement was there with the appearance of the other two geniuses since people were relatively welcoming.
