Chapter 4734: World Primordial Sword

“Go for it, show me what you have come up with together.” Li Qiye accepted. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

“Very well.” The two exchanged glances and made up their mind.

Despite not being a dao lord, these two were talented enough to create a historically-great merit law.

Moreover, they worked together on its creation and were about to use it together. This should be nothing short of brilliance.

“Buzz.” Five-sun King’s bowl became resplendent. The rays weren’t only coming from the opening this time but the entire thing. This illuminated the entire region. The bowl seemed to be containing three thousand worlds and an endless cosmo.

Spectators had nothing but kind words about this. His bowl might not be weaker than a dao lord weapon even though he wasn’t one yet.

The shining bowl was placed on the ground but it didn’t damage anything. Suddenly, everyone felt as if the world itself has been turned into a gigantic bowl.

All living beings and laws were contained within and could be refined at any moment. Runic lines then appeared everywhere and the ground became bright as well.

The real world suddenly retreated and was replaced by a version ruled by the bowl.

“Buzz.” With this, the three combatants disappeared from sight, entering the new world of the bowl.

Inside this new dimension, they saw the bowl in an enlarged form floating in the sky. Five-sun King was the ruler; his blood served as the energy for this world.

“Clank!” Imperial swords slowly appeared and took over as well. The stars up high also turned into swords.

Eventually, an ocean of blades could be seen. It started twisting into a maelstrom capable of devouring anything.

Each had the power and will of a great king. These intents were mighty and fully obeyed the young emperor. This was akin to him leading an army of elite warriors to fight Li Qiye.

“Screech!” The image of a heavenly eagle also appeared. It then fused with the new dimension, serving as space and time and then becoming omnipotent.

The suppressive aura of a heavenly eagle took over, acting as the highest god.

This still wasn’t the end of the preparation. The mystic true fate released the secrets of the grand dao to empower the heavenly eagle.

Suddenly, the creature from the primordial time actually manifested into reality. It had golden claws and red eyes, adorned with magnificent feathers. It spread its wings and started a terrible spatial storm.

“The mystic true fate is empowering the eagle bloodline.” Spectators could still watch the fight unraveling in this new dimension.

Gods were nothing more than delicious meals to this heavenly eagle. It was made from time and space of the dimension. Anything standing within its boundary was helpless before its will.

When empowered by a mystic true fate, a merit law could become dozens of times stronger. This was common knowledge. However, none expected him to use it on his eagle bloodline.

“Clank!” The imperial swords became the foundation for a supreme sword dao.

The power of both the bowl and the eagle also empowered True Immortal Young Emperor.

“Boom!” His primal fate palaces exuded immortal light. The four phenomena appeared to help him.

A radiance pulsed intensely around him. A supreme grand dao melted into his body and caused his eyes to flash with dao light. One was yin and the other was yang, granting him the ability to derive life and death.

The various empowerments returned him back to the purest state - a process similar to atavism. He gained the ability to control the primordial forces.

“What an incredible boost of power from the four phenomena.” One spectator said.

He also enjoyed the power of Five-sun King and reached an unprecedented height.

“Clank!” His imperial sword became the only thing worthy of the character, “sword”.

He traced his finger down the blade and illuminated this dimension. The ground had a layer of reflection as if it was made from jade.

“World Primordial Sword!” The young emperor shouted.

This was a slash created by the duo. They used the king’s bowl as the root, the heavenly eagle and mystic true fate as the base along with the young emperor’s four phenomena. This resulted in an unstoppable attack.

The crowd could sense its immense destruction right away and started shuddering. They all turned pale while imagining the swing.
