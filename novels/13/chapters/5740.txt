Chapter 5741: Only I Can Navigate

Nightmoon Conqueror and Immortal Emperor Ren Xian’s appearance instantly shifted the tides by injuring Light-dragon and Heaven Burial.

“Kill them!” The People’s surging morale fueled them for another push.

“Retreat!” Sword Emperor decisively gave the order and a heavenly beam teleported him away.

“We’re leaving!” The other commanders from Celestial Court roared and disappeared.

It just took a second for all of their soldiers to do the same, reciting the proper incantation.

“Hahaha!” Calamity laughed boisterously after winning the first battle: “Damn, that felt good! Push forward, I’m sure those old turtles will crawl out eventually.”

The legions regrouped in front of the celestial river and prepared for another march.

“How should we cross it?” The same problem persisted.

“Just have to force our way through.” An ancient god gritted her teeth in response.

“We can’t afford to since not everyone can cross. We’ve tried before and lost a dozen emperors and monarchs.” A monarch shook his head.

This moat was perilous even for imperial-level characters. The last coalition found this out the hard way.

Its incalculable size and surging water could drag someone down, never to be seen again. Of course, powerful characters such as the duck egg buyer could still cross it.

“Who can cross?” Immortal Emperor Chi Ye asked.

Everyone exchanged glances and wondered about the odds.

“I might be able to.” Immortal Emperor Ren Xian nodded confidently while gazing at the river.

“I can.” Demon said.

“It won’t be a problem.” Nightmoon Conqueror knew this for a fact since she had done so before.

“It’s worth a shot.” Calamity said, albeit not a hundred percent confident.

“Same for me.” Chi Ye said.

Silence ensued since only a few among them could cross with certainty.

“We cannot take this risk.” Demon shook her head.

As the grand commander, she was responsible for their fate. Taking the first step meant embarking on the journey without a chance to change their mind. Losing a dozen or so was unacceptable.

“Is Sacred Teacher here?” Ren Xian asked.

“He is at Immortal Dao City right now.” Demon said.

“When can he get here?” Ren Xian asked.

“I do not know, we cannot speculate his movement.” Demon responded.

“Then we should camp here, stay alert for any counterattack.” Ren Xian said.

“Very well, rest and wait for Sacred Teacher before launching another assault.” Demon took a moment before coming up with a decision.

Everyone found this logical because their chance of winning would rise dramatically with Li Qiye’s help. Celestial Court stood no chance in that case.

Suddenly, they heard someone singing. The voice came from the river itself: “The river, vast and grand, only I can navigate, to the end.”

They saw a tiny boat approaching and were surprised. It traveled as if this was just another river, not the perilous region that had put emperors to rest before.

Members of Celestial Court could cross it due to being empowered by the light. Others didn’t have the same privilege.

“Over here, ferryman.” Sindragon Dao Lord waved.

The ferryman seemingly heard him and waved back: “Coming, coming.” Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

He started singing the song again and after a while, the boat reached the shore.

“Gentlemen.” He bowed at the alliance, not disturbed by their mighty auras.

They got a good look at him - an old man dressed plainly in a cloak. His face was covered in wrinkles and his hands, calluses. Weather and age have gotten the best of him; he looked just like a fisherman in the mortal world.

The emperors exchanged glances. They have traveled the world but had no impression of him.

“Mister, how should we address you?” A monarch found this strange.

“Just a ferryman for the fateful.” The old man smiled.

“No.” Demon gazed at him before shooting her nature aura straight at his eyes.

“Pop!” The moment it nearly pierced his eyes, a Buddhist light erupted, revealing a majestic kingdom.

Some emperors felt suppressed while being illuminated by the Buddhist light.

“Amitabha.” The old man shook his head and placed his palms together.

“Meru Buddhist Emperor.” Demon recognized him.

“Benefactor, you are truly incredible.” The old man bowed slightly at Demon.

“Meru Buddhist Emperor?” Everyone was surprised to hear his title. Alas, they couldn’t see how this old man was the renowned Buddhist.

“Emperor, when we last met, your avatar stretched across three thousand worlds, always ready to enlighten and grant salvation.” Thousand-hand Dao Lord commented.

“That is in the past.” The old man shook his head.

Just like that, they met another apex cultivator.
