The million-strong army of Three Truths has surrounded Divine Black. Of course, this was a little exaggerated but virtually their strongest elites have gathered here.

Most third-party cultivators found this surprising. Even those aware of the reason thought that it hasn’t reached this level yet.

Losing a protector and an elder was a big deal, but far from enough to cause a full-scale invasion.

Judging by the current circumstances, it seemed that Three Truths wanted a fight to the death. This simply didn’t make sense to the spectators.

Their ongoing conflict in the past resulted in numerous skirmishes and heavy casualties. Both sides faced periods of deterioration. However, none really tried to destroy the other due to the innate risks. Thus, Three Truths’ current forces were unprecedented.

“Boom!” Three large figures finally came out of the portal. All three rode a strange beast.

One had a gigantic elephant with legs as big as stone pillars. It could easily carry a mountain on its back. Instead, there was a pavilion there with an old daoist meditating inside - looking quite transcending.

Another was an old woman riding a hallowed bird. It wasn’t as big as the elephant but its long tail was covered in terrible flames, looking similar to the truefire of a phoenix.

She had a cold expression and sharp eyes - a sword user evident by the glowing sword hanging on her back. It seemed prime for a massacre. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

The final was a beardless man with a white complexion. He rode a flood-dragon around eighty meters tall with two sharp horns. They looked like two unsheathed sabers ready to strike.

He had a treasure pagoda - an artifact that could devour many beings and demons. The latter couldn’t help feeling afraid when staring at it.

“The seven Dao Child of Three Truths.” The spectators became startled after seeing them.

“Three are here now, they are really going all out.” The experts from Divine Black murmured.

Dao Child was their old title from long ago. Most called them the seven Dao Elder of Three Truths now. They were the strongest cultivators in their sect including the sect master.

They were equivalent to the peak lords of Divine Black but certainly stronger than Zhang Yue.

“Is the strongest of the seven here?” One expert in the distance wondered.

“The seventh!” Many have heard of the famous seventh elder of this group.

“Lu Yiling, a potential Grand Dao Sacred Physique cultivator.” Many got chills thinking about it.

The seven Dao Elders were naturally famous in this region. However, the most renowned wasn’t Three Truths’ sect master but rather, the seventh elder.

He was the sect master’s Junior Brother, a great genius - the youngest but also the strongest.

“Lu Yiling!” Even a stop master like Ping Suoweng became serious, let alone the other peak lords.

“Leaving him aside, just these three are strong enough.” One spectator commented while looking at the three Dao Elders standing before the army.

The man riding the elephant was the third elder; the one with the flood dragon was the fourth; the old woman was fifth in line.

“Boom!” Another figure came out of the portal. He left behind footprints in the sky as he walked. They remained there for a long time without dispersing.

This old man’s three-colored robe fluttered to the wind, the same with his long beard. When he stroke it, a glint could be seen from the individual hair.

He stood there looking like a divine mountain - uncrossable and demanded respect.

“The leader of the seven and the sect master of Three Truths!” Many became astonished.

This person was as famous as Ping Suoweng in the northern West King.

This made the members of Divine Black even more nervous. More signs pointed to a relentless war.

“This won’t end well.” The spectating experts took a deep breath and talked among themselves.

“Brother Suoweng, we demand an explanation.” Three Truths Sect Master spoke.

His voice was as sharp as a blade. Each word carved into the air and made those from Divine Black very uncomfortable. It felt as if they were being carved.

“Long time no see, Fellow Daoist.” Ping Suoweng floated above South Conch Peak and still had a friendly expression: “May I ask the reason for this mobilization?”

The two had a stark contrast in appearance. Suoweng looked like a friendly grandpa right now.

Nonetheless, those in the know were aware that this external appearance was a lie. The real Suoweng was ruthless and decisive when need be.

“You already know. Your sect killed our disciples, the chief protector, and Elder Fu, resulting in the deepest animosity. You have broken the pact and declared war on us!” The sect master responded.

“Incorrect.” Suoweng replied: “Your men attacked first and destroyed our gate, trying to break into Jade Bird Peak. We were acting in self-defense. They can only blame themselves for being unskilled.”

Suoweng didn’t try to watch his words since he knew that it was a waste of time. The enemy had already mobilized to this level. This could only end with a battle.

Three Truths was trying to gain the moral high ground with an excuse for attacking Divine Black. Suoweng simply wanted to correct the narrative to the public.

The spectators exchanged glances. Many of them didn’t know about the little details.

In reality, the death of Liu Menglong’s group wasn’t made public yet the army of Three Truths was already here.

This meant that Three Truths have prepared to mobilize long ago. They would have come even if that group had survived.

“Self-defense?” The sect master’s eyes pulsed with aggression: “This is your answer? Your justification for breaking the pact?”

“Dao Brother, we both know what’s going on, stop wasting time. Your army is already outside, what’s the point of talking about the pact now? But if you actually care about peace, then withdraw your army first and we can have a real discussion.” Suoweng retorted.

By this point, even a fool could tell that the bowstring has been drawn to the limit with the arrow readied. Stopping it from shooting out was impossible.
