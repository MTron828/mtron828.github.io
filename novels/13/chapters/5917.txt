Chapter 5917: Poye’s Death

“Thank you for granting me a clean death, Sacred Teacher. I will kill you when I’m alive again.” Present communicated before dying.

Li Qiye’s sword returned to its sheath while the two empty shells fell into Three Immortals.

“I’m afraid the outcome will still be the same.” Li Qiye said with a smile: “But that time will be a true death, not just a clean death.”

With that, he entered the world.

“Rumble!” Something monstrous fell into Three Immortals.

“What is that?!” Emperors and Ancestors became alarmed.

A heavenly being instantly stood up and gazed at the falling entity, taking a deep breath before speaking: “How can this be? Poye is dead...”

“Who’s the killer?” A supreme terror in a deep and still place opened their eyes and found this unbelievable.

“Can only be one, it’s starting, it’s finally starting.” Another terror’s expression changed after speculating.

“It’s time to prepare.” A third terror in hiding had a serious expression.

The death of Poye swept over Three Immortals, shocking all listeners.

“Poye can’t die, he’s everlasting.” In an area full of riches, a king sat on his throne and couldn’t believe the messenger.

“Did he die naturally or was he killed?” This became the main topic in their world. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“He was invincible already, this is impossible.” A big shot murmured.

“Right, no one can kill him.” One emperor found this unfathomable.

Most listeners believed that it had to be a natural death or part of Poye’s plan.

“It could be Lord of Life and Death, Lord of Calamities, and Supreme Black Ancestor’s doings?” This became a popular rumor in Three Immortals. [1]

“No, that would have been a devastating fight known to everyone. Poye wouldn’t have gone down without a fight.” An amazing cultivator shook her head and disagreed: “Don’t you remember Night Watch, the long earth-shattering war? The participants were the same.”

“They couldn’t kill him back then.” An Emperor knew the result of Night Watch and thought the killer was someone else.

Surviving that war made Poye the undisputed master of their world. Therefore, the culprit couldn’t be Lord of Life and Death’s group.

“Desolate Ancestor’s group, perhaps? The ancestor was the reason for Dingtian’s passing.” A powerful Ancestor speculated another probability, albeit a low one.

Alas, they have not heard any news regarding Desolate Ancestor. Rumors of the ancestor’s passing surfaced.

“Dingtian’s dead but surely his opponents couldn’t have fared better during Heavenslay.” An Ancestor aware of more information said.

“Then what the hell happened to Poye?” Everyone felt confused.

“Someone has arrived.” A cultivator beyond the Ancestor stage pondered.

Poye’s death caused quite a stir in Three Immortals, changing the direction of many kingdoms and sects.

“War might be coming.” Big shots were worried due to future uncertainties.

“Find it now!” Meanwhile, lineages with ties to Poye such as Immortal Suppression Dynasty sent out their emperors and Ancestors.

It could be Poye’s corpse or some peerless treasures left behind.

“Two things fell from the sky, but where to?” This became the next exciting piece of information.

None could sit still due to the temptation.

“We might be able to find Poye’s legacy, an incredible fortune.”

Poye was the ultimate being in Three Immortals. Lord of Life and Death, Lord of Calamities, Xian Chengtian, Primal Yin Immortal Ghost, and many more... None could defeat him.

Poye’s radiance was unparalleled and unshakable. If anyone could obtain his legacy, they could become the lord of Three Immortals.

“We cannot let it fall to outsiders!” His followers did everything they could to find his legacy, whether it be the lineage he created or those who have followed him.

Cultivation potential aside, his remnant items and legacy represented the highest authority.

“Maybe it’s the chance to fight back.” A mysterious figure plotted in a secret conference: “The world has forgotten our existence.”

“This is a great opportunity. We need to wake everyone up and wipe all traces of Moshi, Dingtian, and Poye.” Another said.

“Is Poye truly dead?” Someone aware of the intricacies asked: “Perhaps this is just another cycle or a way to bait the snakes out.”

“Moshi was destroyed, Dingtian passed way, and now Poye, it could be another cycle.” Someone who had participated in a war sharing the same title as their world said.

“If this is another cycle, what we need to do now is to find his reincarnation and kill him before he grows stronger.” One more added.

“Where will he show up?” A hidden overlord started calculating the possibilities.

This continued for a while before someone else shook their head: “Can’t calculate the location, Poye might have expected this and prepared a place safe from divination.”

“What will he be in the fourth cycle?” An existence wondered.

“The younger ones have no idea and think that Poye is just Poye. If there is another, we must kill him.” One cultivator said and initiated a search for the next reincarnation.

1. I’m not too happy with Lord of Life and Death since it is too long. Life-death Lord is inferior, while Lifelord or picking just one to focus on is inaccurate, albeit the master of life is also the master of death since they’re two sides of the same coin. I’m not sure if there’s a shortened version I can use like many titles either. ☜
