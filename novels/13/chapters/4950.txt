Chapter 4951: Skyquake Dao Controller

While Li Qiye and the old man were debating the dao, the grand ceremony has started.

In the deepest space of the academy with the bright radiance came a loud bang. The radiance suddenly intensified and illuminated the region.

“Look!” This attracted everyone’s attention.

“Rumble!” Something akin to a meteor fell down from above.

“What is happening?!” Students became startled due to the shadow of this large entity.

However, the experienced ones didn’t worry at all and became excited: “The ceremony is starting!”

Others calmed down and followed the shadow. Once it landed, violent quakes ensued.

The schoolmaster appeared and announced: “The ceremony commences now, everyone takes advantage of this, do not waste this opportunity.”

“Why is it so far from the academy this time?” One student wondered.

Nonetheless, everyone sped in that direction. The first ones saw a mountain majestic in size, not appearance. It was barren and devoid of verdant and lush trees - a drastic difference compared to the surrounding.

Holes could be seen everywhere as if people have excavated this place before. Tinier spots were present as well, perhaps from the weathering of time.

Thus, the mountain itself was inconspicuous but this didn’t matter to the students. They were captivated by the numerous artifacts and rare weapons pinned on the surface. Their auras pulsed outward and could be sensed from ten million miles away.

It included divine sabers with rampaging rays. The gleams o swords could be seen everywhere. One pagoda contained a rotation of the sun and moon. A few weapons were unrecognizable. Some were made from extremely rare metals…

Students felt that other treasuries pale in comparison. They have never seen anything like this before.

“Mystic Pagoda, Soaring Immortal Stone, Sun-moon Sword…” One of them had enough knowledge to recognize some of the treasures.

A few stood out among the rest. One resembled a jade hairpin releasing delicate dao laws with immeasurable profundity. Its existence led to dao harmonization and seemed to be above all the other treasures - a phoenix leading all other birds for that was its birthright.

“Do you see that?” Even unaware students could tell that this was special. Conqueror treasures were clearly inferior.

“Skyquake Dao Controller.” A student who has been around for a long time answered.

Most have never heard this name before.

“It’s understandable that you haven’t heard of it since it never left the academy. The venerable Jun Landu gifted it to the academy.” The knowledgeable student elaborated.

This was another unfamiliar name to the listeners.

“A really strong cultivator?” Another asked, thinking that given the treasure’s value, this person should be a top conqueror or dragon lord.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“No, I heard that he was only a student but was lucky enough to win it off the deer pawnshop. He left it here instead.” The knowledgeable student shook his head.

All the treasures on this mountain were given by alumni. Some gave them during this ceremony in the past while others returned after reaching the peak, wanting to show gratitude. These top masters might even leave their favorite treasures here.

“What happened afterward? Did he become someone great?” Another asked.

“Nothing happened.” The student went on: “He left the academy and was never heard from again.”

“It’s because he gave away his fortune, the rest of his life was spent in obscurity.” A few students sighed and lamented.

This “dao controller” was clearly special and could help a cultivator achieve incredible things. Alas, Jun Landu gave it away and didn’t become famous. Many students wondered about this choice.

Some thought that if they had gained something from the deer pawnshop, they would keep it for themselves. Repaying the academy could wait after their ascension in the future.

“How about that treasure over there?” Other students were attracted by something else - looking like a jade cane. It exuded green lights filled with life energy. Though this mountain was barren, the treasure made the surroundings feel like a primal world with divine beasts and birds.

“Immortal Beasts, left behind by Demon Conqueror.” The knowledgeable student said.

“Demon Conqueror!” Listeners became emotional.
