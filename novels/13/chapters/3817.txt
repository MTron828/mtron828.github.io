Chapter 3818: Where Do You Think You’re Going?

A while ago, Righteous Scion appeared domineering and looked disdainfully at everyone out of the corner of his eye. Now, he actually fled from a battle.

Due to his previous display of might, he might not actually lose to Sword Hero. The two have only exchanged one move and he wasn’t at a great disadvantage.

This choice didn’t match his personality in the slightest. He wasn’t one to run away from a battle in fear. If he was a coward, he wouldn’t have chosen to challenge the holy ground by himself.

Thus, this development could only be described as astonishing and illogical.

“What the hell? The fight has only just started.” One spectator blurted.

“Is it a different scheme?” Even the big shots had no clue why Xu Cuimei pulled him away.

“Fleeing? I’ll still teach you a lesson even if you make it back to Righteous.” Sword Hero laughed boisterously.

His aura was quite fierce right now like an unsheathed sword, ready to inflict damages. He followed the scion in a leisure manner, akin to a relaxed fisherman.

“Wait, they’re heading for Duality Academy.” Eventually, people noticed the duo’s destination.

Why would he pick Duality Academy instead of Righteous Sect?

“Maybe they panicked and got lost?” A confused soul guessed.

“Don’t tell me they’re seeking protection from Five-colored Sacred Sovereign?” One youth speculated.

This was rather plausible because a grandmaster should be able to stop Sword Hero.

“Why would the sovereign help them?” A student from Duality questioned.

“Hmm, I heard that the sovereign traveled the world and spent some time at RIghteous Sect. He had a good relationship with the prodigies there, I’m sure these friendships still remain.” A big shot said. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Well, what are we waiting for? Let’s go watch!” A spectator grew impatient and suggested.

“Right, let’s see how this ends.” Everyone else agreed. Thus, the crowd rushed from the capital to Duality Academy.

A while later, the students at the academy were so confused to see the experts entering their turf.

Xu Cuimei and the scion chose Myriad Cauldron Peak as their hiding place. Others caught wind of this and went there as well.

As for Sword Hero, he didn’t worry about his preys escaping so he took his time. The scion could go to the edge of the world and still wouldn’t be able to get away.

Normally, Myriad Cauldron Peak would be filled with students trying to craft treasures and weapons.

This wasn’t the case today because the majority of the student body came to watch the fight between Dugu Lan and the scion.

Furthermore, there was something off about the peak - all the cauldrons were extinguished.

“Wait, what happened to the flames?” Some became startled after noticing this.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” They then heard metallic clunks from the pinnacle.

The pinnacle never had flames because the cauldron there has been dormant for a long time. That’s why the clangings surprised the listeners. Once they regained their wits, they started the climb.

The peak was different from before, looking a lot shorter. It resembled the mouth of a volcano now.

One could hear splashing and flowing noises akin to that of surging lava. Of course, this liquid consisted of various molten metals.

The center had a cauldron with a powerful flame - the reason why these metals were melting. This was the true appearance of the peak.

In the past, numerous masters came to create unreasonably mighty weapons and artifacts here. Because of this, the flame experienced wear and tear.

Moreover, each creation left behind a large amount of smelted dregs. As they cooled, they became layers of rocks. The stacking process continued for eras and cut off the flame in the center.

The students in that generation had no choice but to dig out new holes for new cauldrons by the cliff sides.

One solution was to revert the process by removing the waste layers. However, remember that these metals were still top materials gathered by dao lords and sovereigns.

Therefore, these layers were extremely tough. Future descendants found removing them impossible, at least until today.

Under Li Qiye’s order, the old servant mustered everything he got to break the top layers. This allowed Li Qiye to activate the flame again to melt the rest of the dregs. They started to flow back into the cauldron’s mouth, hence the current situation.

Some teachers didn’t bother going to watch the fight between Dugu Lan and the scion. They preferred to stay and watch Li Qiye’s blacksmithing skill.

Seeing the melted metals again left them speechless.

“The primary cauldron finally sees the sunlight again.” An older one became sentimental. He had personally witnessed the amazing creations in the past and now, he got to see the famous cauldron once more.

“Why is he refining the liquid dregs?” Another found this strange.

Li Qiye kept on pulling out the larger pieces that haven’t fully melted and tempered them with the legendary forging hammer. He then threw them back into the cauldron again.
