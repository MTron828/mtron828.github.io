Chapter 5126: Undying Seal

He crossed through the expanse to reach another phenomenon - a world torn asunder and its dao buried. There was no beginning nor end in sight. Perhaps above the deepest location was the high heaven itself.

Li Qiye suddenly saw something - a skeleton that has been twisted. He looked at the ribcage and saw a unique seal made from ancient runes with the shape of a crow. It was essentially golden but time had painted it gray.

Nonetheless, it still had a feeble glow - a representation of life itself. As long as there was a single particle left, life still flowed even in the weakest of states.

“This…” His expression changed since he knew who it was.

He raised the skeleton to take a closer look: “But why here?”

This shouldn’t be possible because she was no longer in this world. Yet here she was, dead. Something drastic and unexpected must have occurred without his knowledge.

“Undying Seal.” He sighed and said.

He recognized it because he was the one who imprinted the seal in the first place.

“What happened?” He touched the seal and said softly.

Unfortunately, skeletons couldn’t speak to answer him.

“Can’t be undying forever, I suppose.” He didn’t expect this development during this epoch.

“Villainous heaven, watch me take this life back!” He then glanced upward and became serious.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Boom!” He raised his hands and stole the fortunes of the heaven, delving deeper into the mysteries above.

“Rumble!” Tribulation lightning bolts descended and struck him.

These heavenly bolts were immensely thick. Just a single one could obliterate an Immortal Emperor or conqueror. An entire ocean was unstoppable regardless of the defensive method employed.

“Go!” Li Qiye roared and relied on his dao heart to close the eyes of the heaven. Though the barrage of lightning bolts struck him, his dao heart remained indomitable.

“Pop!” He eventually lasted long enough to obtain a few drops of life water from the high heaven.

He dripped them on top of the skeleton and they were immediately absorbed. The dead skeleton started showing signs of life again like a withered tree enjoying a strong rain.

“Buzz.” The Undying Seal exuded golden rays once more.

A true rebirth was impossible. In this case, there was still life left in the seal and the skeleton. Thus, he used a heaven-defying method for the revival purpose.

Of course, the heavy price required him to meditate. The light of his dao source and primordial energy flowed around him, using the purest form of healing possible to mend the wounds.

In spite of his current ability and being the strongest cultivator in the mortal world, the tribulation still left serious injuries.

After a long while, he opened his eyes and observed the corpse. Flesh could be seen on some parts but this process required time.

He reached forward and used his dao source to create ultimate laws.

“Clank!” He sent laws capable of healing coursing through the skeletons, creating the veins and muscles again. Everything moved at a snail’s pace on top of requiring a tremendous amount of primordial energy.

A conqueror with an anima tree couldn’t support the process. Only existences with a dao source such as Li Qiye had this capability.

He heard thunderous explosions from above as if something monstrous was cursing Li Qiye for doing this.

“This is life prolongment, she is still alive so this isn’t a rebirth, don’t be so mad.” Li Qiye glanced up and said.

A tribulation still loomed above but didn’t descend. The bolts earlier were merely punishment.

“Now!” After creating the external frames, he used his anima power and pointed at the skull.

“Pop!” This was the ultimate truth of the epoch and now, it was embedded into the skeleton.

Using this truth required total comprehension from the start of time to the future. It required a perfect memory and Li Qiye still couldn’t keep up with the reconstruction.

“Boom!” An apocalyptic force erupted and sent him flying.

His expression soured as he got up to take a look at the skeleton. There was no sign of the soul returning even though life was flowing.

“More time.” He knew that gathering the soul was arduous: “More accumulation too.”

The skeleton has turned into a corpse with life. Now, it became a matter of time despite Li Qiye’s anima.

The corpse had suffered terrible destruction and was nearly reduced to ashes. However, the Undying Seal prevented this.

During the last moment, a feeble life force was placed into the seal, avoiding a complete death. Otherwise, not even Li Qiye could do anything about it.

This became a matter of gestation and accumulation. Some immortal items might be required as well.

“Why risk it all coming here?” Li Qiye said softly.

The death was one thing but her presence here surprised Li Qiye more.
