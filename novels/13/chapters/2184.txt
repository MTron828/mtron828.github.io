If the late emperor indeed cultivated this heretical art, it would be a sky-piercing event.

No one wanted to talk about the dark days of the system back then, especially the taboo merit law. The ruling authority had burned everything related to this law.

When Asura Heavenbattler took down Virtue True God, he established an iron order forbidding anyone from cultivating it or it would be considered treason - a crime punishable by death.

If this was the case, it would be a great blow to the Wang. People would begin to question the legitimacy of their rule.

“Cultivating that heretical art wouldn’t result in qi deviation. Was it the Wang Clan doing it or you personally, Your Highness. Either way, this is regicide!” Mighty Mountain laughed.

The crowd gasped in response. At this moment, they were questioning the emperor’s death. If the heretical art wouldn’t result in qi deviation, then he must have been killed. The circumstances behind this remained a mystery.

“You know this heretical art so well, don’t tell me that you also cultivate it, or someone in Upper Faction?” Wang Han wasn’t affected at all and retorted.

“Don’t accuse us of such a thing, you need to be responsible for your words.” Mighty Mountain’s expression shifted as he gravely answered.

“Mighty Mountain, I’m responsible for my words.” Wang Han said: “If you don’t cultivate it or have no access to this merit law, how do you know qi deviation wouldn’t come of it?”

“Hmph, I’ve read an ancient scroll about it from my sect.” Mighty Mountain snorted.

“So you’re telling me that Upper Faction still hasn’t given up on it.” Wang Han pushed on: “Back in those years, many top experts from your sect were Virtue True God’s followers. As an ancestor, you should know that the god refined blood in this very abyss. Do you dare to swear that you’re innocent in this place?”

Many in the crowd weren’t aware that Virtue True God refined blood for cultivation in this abyss. The older ones knew that this was called a blood seed.

The true god captured people and took their blood, refining it into his own true blood. In order to reach the apex of this merit law, he had refined tens of thousands of people.

Few here right now knew that this used to be a sacrificial pit for this merit law.

“Your Highness, you’re pushing it. This darkness is ladened with dust, we don’t wish to talk about it yet you’re bring it up again.” Thunderstorm attacked.

“You’re also pushing it.” Wang Han didn’t relent: “Everyone knows about His Majesty’s death, but now, you’re ruining his good reputation with nefarious intents!”

The two gods initially wanted to use the late emperor’s death as a way to lower Wang Han’s credibility. They didn’t expect for her to fiercely bite back. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Ultimately, no evidence, we won’t accept this thing about a reborn ancestor.” Mighty Mountain changed the topic.

“Mighty Mountain, you also need to shut your mouth without any evidence. I’ll be the first to slash you if I hear you talk about the late emperor’s death again.” Fierceblade God shouted.

Others wouldn’t be courageous enough to say this but Mighty Mountain actually relented this time around.

He was imperious against others but had no courage against Fierceblade. This was someone who had defeated him before, there was nothing he could do.

“Are all of you done?” Li Qiye leisurely said after the quarrel.

He had his eyes closed, resting on the throne earlier but now, he opened his eyes and joined in.

Everyone looked over at him, nearly forgotten about his existence just a bit ago.

He looked at the crowd and smiled: “I need recognition from foolish dogs like you? Just my name alone, Li Qiye, is enough! I don’t care for your approval or refusal and will do things my way.”

He paused for a bit: “If you are willing to follow me, I welcome it. If not, that’s fine too, but block my path and be ready to face death. Now, I have said my piece. Where do you stand? Obey me or oppose me? I’m ready to listen.”

“My Wang Clan is ready to follow you, ancestor!” Wang Han spoke without hesitation.

“My Chu Camp will follow suit!” Chu Qingling also represented her faction. There was no doubt that this power had come to an agreement prior or she wouldn’t dare to say this right now, regardless of her status.

Now, the focus was on the seven gods. Before the four great powers showed their attitude, it would be useless for the rest to make their choice. They needed to wait before picking a side.

“Boom!” Suddenly, an explosion echoed across the entire system.

Boundless light oozed out from the source of the explosion, illuminating the entire sky starting with the royal court.

Laws shot out from the large mansion of the Peng. A portal was activated with a majestic aura and energy as abundant as the sea.

When a clan showed their portal like this, it was certainly a declaration of war.

“The Peng!” People immediately recognized this portal.

Who were they declaring war against?

“Boom!” The aura of a True God permeated the area and crazily surged. Someone was purposely doing so in order to intimidate the world.

“Hmph, rebirth? How baseless.” A majestic figure with the sky above his head and the ground touching his feet appeared. Waves of energy pulsed from his very being. His eyes were as bright as two suns.

“The Peng’s Sacred Ancestor! Its strongest backing.” An ancestor was startled to see this.

“Our clan will not recognize anything about a reborn ancestor and will show no mercy for those who scheme against the system! I’m sure Upper Faction will also not allow for a fake to become the next emperor! Any member of the system can and should kill such a deceiver!” His voice echoed.

This was indeed a decisive declaration of war against Li Qiye while refusing his identity!

If Li Qiye didn’t do anything now, people would lose faith in him.

“That’s right, the Sacred Ancestor is right. We will not allow for a deceiver to rule!” Mighty Mountain also laughed and showed his support.
