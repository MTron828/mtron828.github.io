Majestic Desert Splendor

The system seemed to have a slumbering progenitor due to having a permeating majestic grand dao power.

Lucidity King and Sun Lengying ran to the clan like two dogs that have just lost their master.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye took his time chasing, seemingly enjoying the recreational hunt.

“Start!” Sun Lengying shouted after entering the clan.

“Are we doing it?” The experts hesitated and asked their ancestors.

One ancestor made up his mind and gave the order: “Do it, this is our last stance!”

He knew that this was their only opportunity.

After seeing Lucidity King alive, he instantly realized that these two have been scheming against everyone. The duo wanted to use the Mu like a sword but what else could they do right now?

They have already prepared a trap for Fiercest to come. The string and arrow have been pulled back, ready to go.

Moreover, Solar Daoist was inside their clan and has agreed to kill Fiercest. They wouldn’t be able to invite a character of his level again in the future.

“Ready-” The troops chanted.

The land of the system glowed with surging dao power flowing towards the residence of the Mu.

“Buzz.” Numerous battle fortresses rose into place. Each of them had a great ballista with the base made out of metal and progenitorial laws for the strings.

“Creak...” Massive arrows were loaded on each ballista with a gray color. They were made from special metals refined from ice phoenixes and dark dragons, extremely sharp and heavy.

They were personally refined by a progenitor with incredible destructive potential, capable of piercing through multiple defensive barriers.

“Aim... fire!” Commands could be heard from the clan.

“Whoosh! Whoosh! Whoosh!” Multiple arrows broke through the void and directly appeared before Li Qiye in an unstoppable manner.

“Imperial arrows of the Mu!” People shouted after seeing the barrage of arrows aiming for his throat, chest, and head, all the fatal spots.

The dao power of the system served as the bowstrings so the arrows had both speed and power. One ballista alone had killed Eternals before, let alone so many firing at the same time.

“Boom!” The arrows have appeared before Li Qiye before the wind-breaking sounds. Space collapsed around him, unable to withstand this terrible force.

Li Qiye didn’t try to dodge or repel the arrows since he had a glowing barrier ready.

The arrows seemingly struck the toughest thing in existence and started breaking down.

He was completely unharmed to the astonishment of the crowd. Those seeing him in action for the first time shuddered in horror.

“The Mu shall be no more after today.” Li Qiye insipidly said.

This declaration made everyone feel cold as if a basin of water has just been dropped on their head, causing them to shiver.

The few words and the insipid tone sounded like a death sentence for the Mu. Everyone could see the images of a massacre already.

“Boom!” Li Qiye instantly punched the ground. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Rumble!” Laws were uprooted and chaotically pushed out like waves from the pressure.

The system was ravaged by these gigantic laws whipping back and forth violently. They shattered numerous pavilions, gates, and formations.

“Ah!” Numerous experts guarding these positions were crushed, dismembered, or exploded into blood mists.

The spectators were horrified. Normally, the experts of the Mu would use the laws of their system to fight against the enemy. But now, these laws were out of control and attacking them instead.

“Rumble!” The forced vibration emanating from the punch showed no signs of stopping. The laws danced like serpents, swinging up then down.

Numerous locations have been destroyed. Peaks and temples collapsed among the wails of agony.

People could see that if the Mu didn’t have some real tricks up their sleeves, Fiercest was going to annihilate them.

“So brutal.” One spectator murmured.

Jade-break True Emperor has made her way into this system for a massacre in the past. However, it took an arduous fight to do so and she had the help of her ancestor, Gu Yifei.

Today, Li Qiye’s one single punch destroyed the clan’s grand formations and terrains. This damage far exceeded the emperor’s invasion.

Of course, her conquest was still impressive in its own rights but this event was at an entirely different level.

“Ancestors, please activate the grand momentum.” The ancestor in charge instantly shouted, realizing the dire circumstances.

‘Boom!” Bright participles shot upward and illuminated the sky in a blinding manner. The clan turned into a supreme holy ground.

The actual residence of the clan turned into a lake of light with bright waves. The continuous currents lifted the clan, giving it a sacred appearance as if a progenitor was resting inside and looking down on the rest of the world.

“Creak!” Loud moving noises resounded. Divine peaks slowly emerged around the system; each had a unique appearance.

Some towered in the clouds among the nine firmaments. One was tiny yet full of spirituality and immortal presence. Another looked like a grand dao soaring through the myriad realms...

They shared one thing in common - the powerful figures appearing on them. These figures had mighty auras belonging to emperors and Everlastings...

These figures could crush the heavens and take over the universe.
