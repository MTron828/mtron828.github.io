Chapter 5563: Momentous Dao

At the start, Space Dragon Emperor and Ox-dragon Ancestor - protectors of the tablet - believed that they could suppress the gray aura given their mighty cultivation. Unfortunately, they sorely underestimated the power of the gray aura.

Next, the other deities arrived to help and did everything they could to control Momentous Dao and eliminate the unknown force from the tablet.

As time passed, the aura only grew and infected large areas of Momentous Dao, changing the laws and profundities. It started pushing back against the deities as well.

Remember that these deities could become one of the strongest alliances in the immortal continent if they cared about competition and such. Their failure was a testament to the gray aura’s power.

Bones Dao Lord, who possessed an ancestral body, was the first to be infected. A gray heart appeared in his chest and flesh started growing next.

He had no choice but to leave this place before a complete takeover. His presence would have only negatively impacted his allies. The worst-case scenario was him turning into a puppet and attacking the others.

He fled back to his grotto, sealing himself and hoping to expel the power from his body. He was not optimistic but at the very least, he wouldn’t be dragging down his allies. This turned out to be the correct choice since he caught Li Qiye’s attention.

Qin Baifeng was amazed to see the incredible force contained within the tablet. It resembled an ocean and a momentum capable of shouldering time itself. She understood why the deities were able to protect the living inhabitants of Momentous Frontier without needing to show themselves.

Everything started from this tablet and its dao - creating an overarching connection between all entities involved. As long as the mortals showed reverence and prayed sincerely, this dao would grow stronger - culminating in harmony and prosperity for all.

“Amazing that these geezers are willing to do this.” Niu Fen stared at the tablet and said.Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

By this point, the deities finally noticed the newcomers and were surprised - how did they get through the barriers?

Moreover, if these intruders harbored malice, there was nothing they could do since they were preoccupied with the tablet.

However, once they saw Li Qiye, anxiety turned into astonishment and excitement, especially for Space Dragon Emperor and Ox-dragon Ancestor.

Everyone became confident right away - this problem was going to be solved. They wanted to stand up and bow but the precarious situation prevented any distraction.

Li Qiye nodded and gestured for them to keep going.

“Back to your spot.” He told Bones Dao Lord.

Bones Dao Lord obeyed and sat down in his original position while Li Qiye approached the tablet.

“Buzz.” The moment he placed his palm on the surface, all the runes appeared and released a golden radiance.

The gray aura sensed danger but instead of fleeing, it gathered together and flew toward Li Qiye, wanting to engulf him.

His primordial light protected him but the aura still surged forward, wanting to break it down. He became encapsulated in a creepy cocoon of gray. Tiny strands squirmed like worms around him.

Of course, this was proven ineffective since they couldn’t penetrate his primordial light. He continued to derive the ancient runes on the tablet. Each became as resplendent as a star.

Eventually, they formed a connection and turned into a supreme chapter capable of containing the cosmos.

“Buzz.” The runes were stacked into layers around the chapter and revealed a supreme dao. This dao could last as long as time itself.

“Momentous Dao.” Niu Fen and the others murmured.

As for the deities, they became overwhelmed emotionally. His Momentous Dao was perfect - a version superior to any of their iterations.
