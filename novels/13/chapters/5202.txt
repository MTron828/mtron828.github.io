Chapter 5203: I Want Them All

“The fourth is at the immortal level, the best, and shall be saved for last. The price will be sky high so prepare well.” Boss Tang’s voice came from the ship again.

Everyone already knew that all of his treasures were special. Ordinary imperial treasures were meaningless in his eyes.

Just the first three treasures were shockingly tempting to top cultivators. However, the last one seemed to be on an entirely different level.

“An immortal treasure in this world?” A dragon lord questioned the statement.

“Even though there are no immortals, it can still be considered to be at the immortal level.” Boss Tang said confidently and left no room for question.

“What exactly is it?” A domineering voice came from Imperial Attendant City, sounding as if it could be coming from a true dragon.

“Suppression Conqueror!” Many recognized this voice.

“An immortal treasure.” Boss Tang responded without adding any new information.

“Even if it’s not one, it’s still incredible.” Everyone understood how special it was after hearing the firm response. They all speculated about what it could be.

“Divine Alliance shall participate!” A sword soared across the air and pinned down one of the thrones, not allowing anyone to get close. Sword Sea Dao Lord himself had taken action.

“Imperial Alliance shall participate!” A rune crossed through the dimension and imprinted the word “Imperial” on a different throne.

“Heaven Alliance!” Next came a devastating lightning bolt to mark another throne. Its power was oppressive and intimidating.

“So will Dao Alliance!” This voice had a draconic affinity. A vast, auspicious dao billowed and added the symbol of Dao Alliance to the fourth throne.

“The four alliances are in.” No one dared to compete with these four powers.

“I should be a good host. Count me in.” The domineering voice from Imperial Attendant City resounded.

“Boom!” A rune with the character “Suppression” took the fifth spot. Vissit n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for 𝒏ew 𝒏ovels

“I shall join as well.” The sky suddenly turned dark and nether gales took over, creating dust storms everywhere. The city beneath became assaulted by a ghastly energy.

Countless black skulls manifested into reality and scared the hell out of everyone. They thought that another powerful cultivator was coming to claim one of the thrones.

However, a black banner coiled around the gigantic ship.

“I’ll take all the treasures!” A mighty dual-horned ghost appeared and wanted to drag the ship away.

“Ghost Tyrant Banner!” He was a notorious dragon lord that had refined a kingdom into his banner, turning the victims into a specter army.

This cultivator believed in his power and wanted to capture the entire ship. However, sharp rays came from within and cut through the banner.

“Shit!” The ghost became alarmed. His banner had been refined and empowered by countless souls, capable of refining anything trapped within. Alas, it was easily cut through by the rays.

This prompted him to flee right away, abandoning the disintegrating banner.

“Creak.” As he was running, a cannon on the ship aimed in his direction and shot out a blinding beam.

It pierced through space and time, making escaping an impossibility. The ghost knew this so he turned around, summoning all of his treasures and utilizing his merit laws.

A ghost domain emerged, wanting to block the beam.

“Boom!” The mighty domain exploded into nothingness while the beam pierced through his chest, causing him to fall from the sky.

“Leave!” He roared during the crisis and made his sacred fruits leave with his true fate.

In the next moment, a second beam obliterated his head and a third beam destroyed the fruits along with the true fate.

“Ahh!” He let out his last cry before the corpse hit the ground.

The crowd became silent as they watched a powerful dragon lord being taken down after three shots.

“No wonder why people didn’t try to rob Tang’s Emporium in the past.” One expert shuddered.

“I welcome these attempts since it’s been a while since I’ve last killed. I do miss it.” Boss Tang spoke, not afraid of anyone in the upper continents.
