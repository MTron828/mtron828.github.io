Chapter 4924: First Brother

Goldcrest and Swordgrasp’s aura filled the area and made students gasp.

The former’s demonic energy resembled an all-devouring tsunami. Swordgrasp’s sword energy was extremely sharp and made those nearby feel a bone-deep pain.

They were some of the strongest geniuses in Abroad. The crowd wisely backed off in order to avoid needless injuries.

Some capable students whispered among themselves. Those from The Race sided with Swordgrasp and vice versa.

“Boom!” Suddenly, a figure appeared, landing with a powerful impact that created a deep pit and cracked the surrounding ground.

He stood there and released a rampaging aura far surpassing the two geniuses.

“A dragon lord!” Everyone felt something different. This power froze both Supreme and Immortal Sovereigns, seizing the audience by their throat.

All eyes were on this newcomer - a youth shrouded in radiance. Each strand of light looked sacred as if he was a god and a representative of the light.

His eyes were stern and imposing as he released powerful waves of energy to dissipate the demonic and sword energy.

This sent some students flying up into the air. The stronger geniuses tumbled backward.

“Radiant Young Monarch!” Both regular and brilliant students shouted his title.

Those from The People shuddered, no longer cheering Goldcrest Young Noble.

“So this is a peerless genius.” They were afraid to see him.

On the other hand, those from The Race had nothing but admiration since they believed in his supremacy.

His title was well-known throughout the lower continents. He hailed from Godchaser Palace, a great power comparable to Eight-stallion Dynasty when its dao lord was still around.

Whenever this sect was brought up, people would think of a particular being - Conceal Conqueror.

However, it had another supreme genius - Radiant Monarch. Conceal Conqueror was considered the number one cultivator while Radiant Monarch stood at the peak of the young generation.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

Conceal Conqueror was half a generation older than Radiant Monarch. Some speculated that if they were from the same generation, Radiant Monarch might not be weaker at all.

Even Conceal couldn’t fully overshadow the monarch - a testament to the monarch’s abilities.

Radiant Young Monarch was a direct disciple. He didn’t let down his master by also reigning over his peers, already possessing one sacred fruit at such a young age.

The crowd didn’t dare to meet his gaze. Their confidence crumbled before this superior cultivator.

“Brother Radiant.” The arrogant Swordgrasp and Halo Scion greeted him.

“Thieves have stolen a supreme item from Deity. It must be returned so I would appreciate your cooperation. There will be consequences otherwise.” The young monarch asserted.

The Race’s members became haughty right away, knowing that their opponents must yield.

“How awe-inspiring, Young Monarch.” Ming Shi sneered: “But you have no jurisdiction over us here.”

“Your Highness, excuse me then.” The young monarch focused his aura straight on the princess.

She couldn’t deal with it so Yunyun used her tree technique to create a separate barrier.

Alas, he had no problem pushing the barrier down.

“Damn it!” Goldcrest Young Noble shouted and wanted to help.

“Boom!” However, another cultivator appeared and raised his sword, easily dispelling the young monarch’s pressure.

“Young Monarch, this stops here.” He spoke in a calm and measured tone, his gray robe flowing around him as he commanded attention with his majestic presence.

“First Brother!” Students from both sides lowered their head once to show respect.

“First Brother.” The young monarch became serious.

He was the student in charge of Abroad Hall - Yue Shanjian. Zhuo Yijian, the Sword Lord, was his master.

In the last millennium, he presided over the matters in Abroad. Everyone who came in would address him as “First Brother”.

He was strong enough to deserve their respect, being a one-fruit dragon lord.
