Chapter 5795: Nothing To Do With Me

The light of the dao heart reduced darkness and karma to ashes, sending the gigantic mech through one star after another before breaking the domain.

“What is this power?!” Everyone felt this unique presence and became slack-jawed.

The list included World and Profound Emperor. It felt so pure and didn’t need dao derivation and activation of laws.

This exceeded cultivators’ comprehension because the world didn’t have anything similar. Before this, apex cultivators were aware of the path toward the ancestral realm and beyond. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

This required pursuing the ultimate profundity of the grand dao where immortality awaited. Perhaps after becoming an overlord, one could utilize the so-called immortal power.

However, they haven’t tried to research this aspect of the dao heart before. Its might was utterly dreadful.

After taking down the opponent, Li Qiye stood there like a mortal. Nonetheless, some knew that he was unstoppable - the true lord of this epoch.

“Sacred Teacher, what was that power?!” Profound couldn’t help shouting.

“The might of an immovable dao heart.” Li Qiye responded.

Everyone paused for a second before exchanging glances.

“The dao heart can be used in combat?” World Emperor asked.

“An immovable and eternal dao heart has this potential.” Li Qiye stared at the crowd and initiated a lesson.

“How challenging for a mortal to obtain such a dao heart for they endure countless tribulations and afflictions of the feeble flesh. Cultivating the dao heart is a problem, and using it as a power is virtually impossible.” He didn’t discriminate between The People and The Race.

“Therefore, it is essential to strengthen the body while cultivating the dao heart. The stronger the cultivation, the more steadfast the dao heart. If one’s cultivation becomes too strong while the dao heart can’t keep up, it’s tantamount to self-destruction, welcoming the darkness...”

Everyone forgot about their battle and listened attentively, wanting to learn more about the grand dao.

The participants included the most talented existence in the mortal world. Their comprehension and talent left no room for doubt. Thus, they could listen and enter a state of zen.

After a long while, Li Qiye finally stopped and they regained their wits. Both his allies and foes lowered their head in respect.

“Boom!” Three Thousand World Mech finally stood up and appeared before Li Qiye.

It had cracks all over - having been damaged despite being a paragon artifact. Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng would have exploded if it wasn’t for the mech protecting him.

“I’ve seen this power once on someone.” Jiao Heng said: “So it originated from you, Sacred Teacher. It is an honor to see it again.”

“Since all the experts from this epoch are here, why not let them witness the heavenly power in advance?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I’m benefiting from their presence. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have displayed this power.” Jiao Heng laughed.

“How does it compare to the power of the high heaven?” Li Qiye smirked.

“I can’t answer your question, you’ll have to find out yourself.” Jiao Heng shook his head.

“I wouldn’t need to ask you because once I find out, everything will be over.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I wonder if I will have the privilege of witnessing that day.” Jiao Heng said sentimentally.

“You can find out today.” Li Qiye attempted again.

“It’s all gone now, Sacred Teacher, the only thing left is this mortal shell which I will use to fight you.” Jiao Heng said.

“Fine, then one more move to end this.” Li Qiye stopped forcing the issue.

Jiao Heng looked down at the mech and said: “The strongest of weapons still can’t compare to the might of men. The latter is still the key.”

“It makes the sin even worse, destroying three thousand worlds to forge nothing more than an inanimate object.” Li Qiye said.

“I wholeheartedly agree.” Jiao Heng laughed: “This isn’t the only method to craft a paragon weapon. The moment it is used, the outcome is already predetermined, a fine example of causality.”

“Yes, it is useless to be powerful while hiding in the darkness, still can’t overcome the shadow of the high heaven.” Li Qiye said.

“This is a bit harsh, you’re painting the high heaven as a villain.” Jiao Heng chuckled.

“Villainous is the right word but it is necessary. Those in the darkness should tremble in fear.” Li Qiye said.

“I’m afraid people don’t see it that way, especially the dark existences. They believe they are strong enough.” Jiao Heng said.

“There is karma with the shadow, and you’re not exempt from it either.” Li Qiye said.

“That has nothing to do with me, Sacred Teacher.” Jiao Heng said confidently.

“Is that so?” Li Qiye smiled faintly as he said: “From the start of history, countless epochs have come and gone. Where did these karmic strings come from and where should they end?”
