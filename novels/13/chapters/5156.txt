Chapter 5157: Together In Life And Death

This was far from an even fight. No one could ever overcome the difference of two dao fruits.Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“What is she going to do?” A big shot worried.

“Heavenly Sword is being ridiculous.” An ancestor became angry: “Night-rain has no feud with Heavenly Sword, why are they doing this to their own?”

“Could be due to the failed marriage proposal.” Someone said innocently.

“No, that was only for show.” A dragon lord shook her head and explained: “It’s not Heavenly Sword Conqueror’s idea, Supreme is the one behind this.”

“Right, this is a pivotal moment. By provoking Windchaser Conqueror, Heaven Alliance is able to push the issue to the next step. If both are on the brink of death, will Dao Alliance finally take action to save them?”

“Supreme wishes to tear down the Pact of Blessed, this is a way to get Dao Alliance to take action first.” An ancestor understood the intricacies of the situation.

“I believe Heaven and Divine Alliance have come to an agreement. That’s the only reason behind this move, they are ready.” A big shot from The Race murmured.

The majority of The Race didn’t wish for this to happen either due to a lack of benefits and potential casualties. Alas, no one could stop the new coalition.

“If only Principle Conqueror is still in charge.” Someone lamented because the new leader of Divine, Sword Sea Conqueror, seemed to be singing the same tunes as Supreme.

“Why do they want to break the pact now?” A big shot wondered.

“I don’t know, I wonder how Blessed Dao Lord will react.” A dragon lord responded.

The upper continents still had no idea about Blessed Dao Lord’s precarious situation.

Windchaser Conqueror noticed the battle and immediately stood up.

“You’re going?” Jun Landu asked.

“Harkrain can’t win, I shall fight together with her.” Windchaser leaped into the air without looking back, ready to die if necessary.

“Fellow Daoist, say the words and Dao Alliance will offer our support.” The middle-aged man said.

“Still recruiting even now?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“The teeth feel cold without the lips, we have no other choice because Supreme is pushing it.” The man answered.

“He’s waiting for you to make a move, a declaration of war, and his alliance is ready.” Jun Landu said.

“I know, but we shall act if Fellow Daoist Windchaser asks for help.” The man sighed.

Jun Landu didn’t answer while Li Qiye glanced at the battle and said: “The show is starting.”

“Boom!” Windchaser Conqueror broke through the sword domain with his tornados, quite a flashy entrance.

“Heavenly Sword, if you want to fight, we shall entertain you!” He laughed and said while holding Harkrain’s hand.

They exchanged glances, telling each other that not even death can separate them.

“Windchaser Conqueror’s here!” Spectators were amazed at the speed of his recovery.

“Where is that wound?” The big shots clearly saw his chest being pierced earlier.

“Their love is true.” Most became jealous.

“This is how dao companions should be, in life and death.” A dragon lord commented, aware that they have been together since youth.

Dragon lords saw them holding hands and thought that this was rather rare. How many had the fortune of finding a love like this?

This was especially hard for cultivators because not everyone had the same talent with the dao. Some once had a similar love only for one to die far earlier.

As for the conquerors, they were gifted enough to not worry about this. Now, they had the chance of dying together.

“You’re here just in time, Fellow Daoist Windchaser. Come with Fellow Daoist Harkrain to Heaven Alliance, we welcome you two with open arms.”

“Enough wishful thinking, we know of your treachery. Today, either we kill you or die in battle.” Windchaser uttered coldly.

“That puts us in a difficult position. We prefer that you two join us, unscathed.” Someone else suddenly spoke up.

“!” Windchaser and Harkrain’s eyes shimmered after hearing this new voice.

“Someone else is here too?” The crowd shuddered after hearing this.

“Join Heaven Alliance and let bygones be bygones.” The speaker was shrouded in a blinding radiance.

He possessed a heavenly mark just like Heavenly Sword Conqueror. Heaveners felt their own bloodline being crushed and had to show subservience.

“Sacred Sword Monarch!” Many shouted.

“An equal of Heavenly Sword Conqueror.” A big shot took a deep breath.

“Nine sacred fruits.” All eyes were on him.

He was the strongest ancient ancestor of Heavenly Sword School and possessed an ancient bloodline. Thus, he was actually stronger than those at the same cultivation level.

“Now this is the real fighting force of Heavenly Sword. Supreme is the only one who can command them to do so since there is no existing feud.” A crowd member commented.

“This looks to be the end of the road for Windchaser and Harkrain Conqueror, either death or submission.” Everyone understood that the two had no chance of winning.
