Chapter 4172: Suicide

Everything else became insignificant and illusory. Only apex existences like them were eternal at this moment.

While their eyes were fixed on each other, the previous epochs popped up within a flashing primordial light. Deities, geniuses, golden eras = all beautiful but ephemeral in the grand scheme of things. This included ancient emperors and dao lords.

Only a few selected existences were lucky enough to withstand the test of time.

The spectators didn't notice this phenomenon and only cared about a potential contest between these two cultivators.

Eventually, Li Qiye averted his gaze; the same with the middle-aged man. This only lasted a second yet epochs have passed. The rise and fall of eras happened before their eyes.

“Come, let me try.” Li Qiye smiled and raised his hand, gesturing for a broken piece.

He seemed eager to test his luck with the abyss.

“It’s starting.” Everyone opened their eyes wide in anticipation.

Earlier, the man did something unfathomable. They wondered if Li Qiye could somehow duplicate this feat and gain some divine swords. Or, could he even do better and surpass the man somehow?

Alas, it didn’t develop the way they wanted. The man suddenly turned around and jumped into the abyss.

“No!!!” Some blurted out after seeing this.

“What the hell?!” They roared in astonishment and could only watch as he disappeared into the darkness.

Initially, they thought that it would be a great show regardless of the victor. Why did that man commit suicide after being challenged by Li Qiye?

The mysterious man was clearly a wondrous cultivator. This shouldn’t have been his end. Confusion took over right away.

“Why-why did he do that?” Someone calmed down and asked.

“I don’t get it either, no need to commit suicide even if he thinks he’ll lose to Li Qiye.” A knowledgeable ancestor didn’t know where to start.

Such pessimism and narrow-mindedness weren’t fitting for someone as capable as him.

“How stingy, I was just playing around.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“You killed him and still called him stingy?” One crowd member quietly complained.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“This brat is just on another level, forcing the enemy to commit suicide after one sentence.” An ancestor murmured.

“True, no one else is as devilish as him.” Others smiled wryly.

Not long ago, they were wholeheartedly impressed by the middle-aged man. Now, it seemed that Li Qiye was still the most bizarre - a comet of trouble wherever he went.

“What happened to him?” Snowcloud Princess quietly asked Li Qiye, knowing that there were other reasons behind the scene.

Li Qiye didn’t answer her. He looked down at the abyss and said: “Whoa, this place has so many crappy swords.”

This naturally offended everyone because they spent so much effort here for the divine swords below. However, they learned by this point not to mess with Li Qiye.

“Clank!” Suddenly, a sword hymn and a bright ray manifested in the burial ground.

A magnificent visual phenomenon emerged on the horizon - a monarch’s sword soaring above the firmaments, a heavy sword crushing the river of time, an eternal sword never losing its edge…

“?!” Spectators became alarmed right away. Their swords and the ones in the burial ground started resonating loudly.

“It has to be the immortal sword appearing.” One expert calmed down and shouted.

“Really?” Others clamored.

“Boom!” In another region, myriad swords rushed to the sky and turned into an ocean. A man was at the center and stepped on the swords to head for the source of this phenomenon.

“Peace Ocean Sword King!” Someone recognized him right away.

“That’s Peace Ocean Sword King?” His friend gasped while staring at the figure’s majestic back.

“He has been here all along, it’s just that he’s showing up now because of the immortal sword.” A well-informed cultivator told the rest.

“The number one of the young generation.” Many were moved to finally see such a famous figure.

“Buzz.” Pentagram-shaped void zones materialized and widened in that general direction. A youth shrouded in flames crossed through the void zones to travel faster.

“Hmm?!” Spectators were stunned to see the spatial leaps.

“Void Saint Child!” One expert shouted: “Peace Ocean Sword King’s rival.”

“Looks like the top members of the young generation are here.” Another added while watching him entering the inner region.

Void Saint Child was one of the Six Kings, a top genius acting as the leader of Nine-wheel Citadel.
