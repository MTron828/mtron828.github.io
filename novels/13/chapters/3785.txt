Chapter 3786: Grievous Crime

Numerous experts gathered beneath Minor Sacred Mountain; their jaw nearly dropped to the ground.

They saw something massive being carried down the steps. What else could it be but the statue of Dhyana Dao Lord? The two culprits? Li Qiye and Xu Cuimei.

The statue still emitted the aura of a dao lord but this didn’t stop the two from carrying it down.

It represented the highest authority and prestige in the holy ground, hence everyone’s astonishment and indignation.

After a while, the crowd regained their wits. One person asked: “How, how did they get up there?”

The difficulty in reaching the pinnacle was common knowledge. Numerous top masters have tried and couldn’t break through the pressure instilled by the dao lord auras.

On the other hand, Li Qiye and Xu Cuimei did even more than that. This simply didn’t make sense.

“It might be earlier when our holy ground lost its power. The force protecting Minor Sacred Mountain probably disappeared as well so they took advantage of it.” A big shot pondered for a bit before answering.

“That sounds about right.” Others agreed with this explanation.

A while ago, everyone paid attention to the scion only instead of Li Qiye. Thus, they thought that the duo took advantage of the blackout to climb up the peak.

“Why are they moving Dhyana Dao Lord’s statue? What’s their goal?” A youth took a deep breath.

This statue was an object of worship. To be disrespectful was sacrilegious and becoming public enemy number one. This was a crime worthy of full clan extermination.

Moreover, Li Qiye served as the current saber messenger of Vajra. This added betrayal to his list of offenses. Worst of all, he was working with a disciple from Righteous Sect - Xu Cuimei. What else could this be but colluding with the enemy? Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“This is too much, traitorous and blasphemous. There’s no excuse for this.” One youth shouted.

“Right, a crime worthy of clan extermination.” Another chimed in.

The youths of the holy ground have been vexed because of the scion’s pressure. Now, they had a target to vent - Li Qiye.

They couldn’t do a damn thing to the scion but Li Qiye was a different story. Furthermore, they were fully justified in doing so to rid the holy ground of a traitor.

“He deserves death, we can’t let this go!” Another youth bellowed.

As for the big shots from the previous generation, they remained cautious. After all, Li Qiye was still the saber messenger. They weren’t the ones in charge, not qualified to brand him as a traitor or to punish him for his action. This was Vajra Dynasty’s responsibility.

To make a mistake here could lead to serious consequences. Li Qiye had immense status in Vajra.

The only one among the crowd who had a different opinion was Wei Qianqing. She was astonished just like the rest, albeit for a different reason since she witnessed the entire thing.

She knew that these two didn’t utilize the downtime of the holy ground at all. In fact, they had already made it up before the sudden disappearance of the Buddhist affinity.

They started carrying the statue down Minor Sacred Mountain before others got here. She was the only one privy to this detail, hence her bewilderment and speechlessness.

Fewer than few could successfully make this arduous journey yet Li Qiye brought someone else with him. He pushed down the statue without any resistance as well.

The duo brought the statue down to the base. Li Qiye put it down and patted his palms.

The spectators finally noticed how large the statue was. Everyone had to raise their head to get a good look.

“Li, what are you doing?! How dare you take the statue away and disrespect the ancestors?!” One bold youth shouted at Li Qiye.

“This is more than that, he’s colluding with the enemy to steal the ancestral statue, a crime worthy of death.” An expert who hated Li Qiye added.

“Death? He needs to be flayed for days and have his clan exterminated.” Others started chiming in.

The crowd nearby furiously criticized him but he didn’t give a damn. He stretched lazily and glanced at them before smiling: “So many here to play. If you want to kill me, come then, show me what you can do.”

He exerted his dominance and showed his disdain towards them without trying to defend himself.

Wei Qianqing smiled wryly after hearing this, not knowing what to say. She initially wanted to speak on his behalf but he had just offended everyone.

Given this situation, even if she were to say anything, their saliva would drown her out anyway.

His response silenced the crowd for a bit. He was being too direct so it caught them off guard. They expected him to at least have an excuse.

“We’re all busy people.” Li Qiye continued amidst the silence: “I don’t have time so just attack me. Your intent doesn’t matter, just come so we can end this fast.”

The crowd exchanged glances. Everyone knew that he was weak, only an Enlightened Being or so. Anyone here could actually defeat him.

Nonetheless, his previous battle exploits still deterred them so no one wanted to take the risk.

“Rumble!” A cavalry arrived in a boisterous manner and interrupted their rumination.
