Chapter 5546: Momentous Frontier’s Secrets

Niu Fen looked first before touching the gray aura, causing it to ignite in response. It possessed the same edge as a legendary divine blade, capable of cutting the stars.

He reacted quickly and erected a barrier. Nonetheless, blood still streamed from his finger.

“What the hell?” He became startled since a single flash managed to injure him.

Remember, he was famous among the apex cultivators for possessing absolute defense. Few things in this world could actually injure him.

“This thing is…” Li Qiye took his time analyzing the mysterious aura.

“Do you recognize it, Young Master?” Niu Fen was awfully curious.

“Quite similar, but nothing certain.” Li Qiye shook his head: “In theory, this shouldn’t be possible.”

Having said that, he pinched harder and destroyed the strand of aura. His dao flame left nothing behind.

“Now let’s look for the technique.” Li Qiye said before channeling chaos true energy.

His pulsing dao summoned dao laws that gathered together into the form of a chapter. They were everywhere in this region - perhaps making up the very fabrics of reality.

“This is Momentous Dao.” Niu Fen commented.

“Clank! Clank!” The dao laws twisted together for a final derivation, taking the form of a divine stalk.

“It’s back!” The clan master of the Qin was jubilated.

“Too early for celebration.” Li Qiye shook his head.

The recently created stalk withered and lost its divinity. Leaves scattered to the ground.

“Hmm, didn’t you destroy the evil aura just now, Young Noble?” Baifeng didn’t expect this.

“The problem is at the source.” Li Qiye said: “Momentous Dao is still around along with its chapter and runes. However, your Deity of Harvest’s dao source, the thing used to store your prayers, seems to be weakened.”

“Yes, the stalks are just physical manifestations, I do say that it’s a good symbol.” Niu Fen said.

“So the source or in this case, the roots are weakened?” Baifeng asked.

“Yes, just not as serious as this particular temple. The deterioration makes it so that the divinity can’t reach all temples, that’s why you have lost the blessing.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Do you know why this is happening? Something is wrong with the deity?” She took a deep breath.

“Hard to say, few can actually suppress the old geezer…” Niu Fen shook his head: “Moreover, there are more deities in this region. Their strength alone is incredible, let alone this united front in your land. Fighting one deity means fighting all of them.”

By this point, the selfless cultivators have derived Momentous Dao to the limit, culminating in the formation of an incredible tablet as the foundation for this land. They became one after taking the form of deities - capable of fighting together.

Although this land was meant for mortals and didn’t compete with the rest of the continent, this didn’t mean that it was weak.

If someone had schemed against the Deity of Harvest, this could start a war capable of affecting the entire continent. This didn’t seem to be the case.

“Let’s go look at the root to see the problem.” Li Qiye said.

“Haha, if we can find the root, the old geezer will be there too, we can just ask him then.” Niu Fen laughed.

“Then you lead the way?” Li Qiye stared at him.

“Young Master, please don’t embarrass me.” Niu Fen smiled awkwardly: “I have a tiny bit of knowledge of their dao but we’ve lost contact after their transformation. They don’t want to divulge their secrets to an outsider such as myself. Finding the actual root will take some time but it’s different for you, Young Master. You just need to calculate a little bit and will learn all of Momentous Dao, the old geezer won’t be able to hide.”

“Getting rather cheeky now, aren’t you?” Li Qiye playfully smacked the back of Niu Fen’s head.

If others knew of his status as an apex dao lord, they would be astounded while watching him being treated like a junior.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

Nonetheless, Niu Fen took pride in this. Others weren’t qualified to be this close to Li Qiye.

“We’re going.” Li Qiye smiled and left the temple.

He took one step forward and derived the mysteries of Momentous Dao. Laws appeared on the ground beneath his path.

“Amazing, they must have tried so hard. Every inch of land and space has been blessed and refined with their power and dao. No wonder why it’s so effective.” Niu Fen stared at the exquisite runes in astonishment.

The deities didn’t trick the inhabitants of the land. They merely used the power of faith to continue protecting the land.
