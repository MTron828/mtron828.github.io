“Boom!” The arrival of this figure was akin to a meteor smashing the earth.

Everyone thought that it was Five-sun King. Alas, a battle intent surged and engulfed the region. It even caused Li Qiye’s robe to flutter intensely.

“Tian Feng!” Everyone knew who it was without seeing him due to this unique battle intent.

No one else had such a violent battle intent, only Tian Feng. His mere presence alone caused others to shudder. Anyone with the slightest bit of sense would stay away from this madman.

They found his involvement to be surprising. Five-sun King should have been the one to appear since Wild Paragon was his follower and sworn brother.

This didn’t make sense because Five-sun King was one of Tian Feng’s rivals. Why would he help Wild Paragon?

“Hahaha, your opponent is me, Tian Feng!” Tian Feng laughed and declared.

“You want to die this badly?” Li Qiye stared at him and smiled.

This rather common statement was fine when directed at someone else. However, this was Tian Feng, a feared combatant with an exemplary battle record.

Moreover, those who have said that to him were now dead while he was still enjoying life. Provoking him meant gaining an enemy who didn’t know when to quit.

Nonetheless, spectators didn’t criticize Li Qiye for saying this because he had just shut everyone up by beating Wild Paragon. He could say anything right now without sounding arrogant and ignorant.

“No, I simply wish to fight you.” Tian Feng excitedly said: “Of course, feel free to kill me if you can.”

His eyes lit up as if he was seeing something particularly interesting - akin to a thief seeing a pile of gold.

Many couldn’t understand his excitement because the risk of death was rather real in this case. On the contrary, Tian Feng found joy in fighting a potentially fatal battle.

“Very well.” Li Qiye accepted the challenge right away.

“Haha, you are far more interesting than those other conquerors. No need for pleasantries then, witness my true form!” Tian Feng laughed.

“Boom!” He spun around and reverted back to his original form. His sheer weight created a pit.

He turned into a gigantic frog. Of course, he looked different from regular ones. [1]

He was the size of a hill and brimmed with strength. His skin was rather thick as well despite looking soft. As he crouched on the down, it drooped down and looked moldable.

Another thing separating him from other frogs was the battle intent. It turned into an inferno, no longer as formless as before. Vegetation started burning and lakes boiled.

Instead of being a red flame, it had a gray color and caused the area to turn dark. Everyone felt that there was an invisible hand gripping their neck.

His battle intent was already dreadful but after reverting to his true form, it intensified and became several times stronger.

“Mad frog!” Some shouted.

This was a rare demon race with a precious and powerful bloodline. They loved fighting and this was the case even before they became demons - capable of fighting venomous snakes, centipedes, scorpions, and other dangerous creatures…

After becoming demons, this race would want to fight even more. Tian Feng managed to relatively restrain his natural instinct but still became famous for it.

He was strong enough to fight using a human form. He only reverted back to his original form against truly mighty opponents. This revealed how highly he regarded Li Qiye.

“I’m starting, eat this!” Tian Feng shouted and leaped into the air, crushing the ground beneath him.

He didn’t resort to using any technique or merit law, only his body as a weapon.

Li Qiye’s fist became resplendent again as he used the Golden Fist Dao.

“Bam!” He struck Tian Feng’s chin and knocked the frog back, causing it to roll into and smash several mountains.

“Just one punch again?” Spectators became slack-jawed.

If he could defeat a conqueror with just one punch, then maybe only characters such as Dao Sanqian would be able to fight him.

“Bam!” Tian Feng jumped up and got back on its feet.

“Whoosh!” Suddenly, his body seemed to be inflating and growing larger again, from a hill to a mountain. ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“What’s happening?” A spectator asked.

An influential demon among them said: “If you can’t kill a mad frog in one move, it’ll just become stronger and bigger after receiving attacks. It is tenacious.”

1. We finally know what he is now. The original word included too many different animals to pick without context so I used demon ?
