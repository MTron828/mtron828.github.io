Chapter 4361: Who Needs Who?

“When you actually want to do business, come find me then.” Li Qiye wanted to finish the conversation.

A’jiao contemplated for a bit before answering: “You’re putting us in a tough position, this is straight robbery.”

“No, it is a fair transaction.” He smiled and said: “Tell me, has anything like this happened before in history?”

Her lips slightly parted but no words came out.

“No, it is unprecedented.” He said: “Its serious nature and consequences are beyond imagination. Is he himself fully aware? No, he does not, hence you being here.”

“Can’t argue with that.” She conceded due to his logic.

He chuckled and continued: “That’s why this is a fair transaction. In fact, it can’t be any fairer, not a robbery in the slightest.”

She sighed then stared at him to say: “But have you imagined when that day comes? What will you get out of it? What will the world get out of it? It’ll be a mess more than your imagination as well along with the destruction.”

“That’s one possibility.” He nodded: “And it might be worse than what you are describing as well. I also do not have a clear conclusion.”

He paused a bit before continuing: “Nonetheless, this isn’t a reason for me to help him. I am not affected by the outcome.”

“Is that so?” She asked: “Even if you don’t care about yourself, what about this world? You can consider this an experiment, a self-challenge for your power and dao heart. Sure, you’ll survive, but nothing will be left even if you can return triumphant one day. Everything here will be long gone. There must be a better compromise to keep this place going.”

“Let’s say that you have a better method, how can you be sure that this world will continue to exist after everything is over?” He disagreed: “No one else including him can change the result. The only thing different is the path. Everything will return to ashes in the end because this is an eternal law. We’re all but mere bubbles in the great maelstrom of time.”

“I…” She hesitated from responding because she was only the representative and couldn’t make all the decisions.

“Nothing has changed in history, he won’t be able to do so this time either. There is a clear line that can’t be broken even if one breaks the sky vault and becomes the new dao.” He continued.

She couldn’t respond because he was indeed telling the truth. She understood the intricacies and secrets at play here. Nonetheless, she still wanted to convince him because there was still a glimmer of hope with him on their side.

“Go back from whence you came.” He waved his hand.

As she was about to leave, she couldn’t help but ask: “You don’t want to know the secret behind all of this?”

“It would be a lie to say no.” He said: “But as long as I’m alive, I’m sure I’ll see it. Mortal shells can’t reach it but I’m an exception.”

“It’ll be too late then.” She said.

“Still doesn’t change anything. If I do participate, I might be the one going down and the result will still be the same for this world. This case applies to him dying as well.” He said: “That’s why if you want my participation, give me what I want.”

“You believe that if your demand is met, you’ll win?” She stared intensely at Li Qiye.

“No one can answer your question.” He smiled.

“Think about it carefully. If you make a decision one day, just say the word, I’ll be around.” She pondered for a bit longer before giving up.

“I will agree whenever you meet my demand.” He said.

She sighed because she knew that words alone couldn’t convince Li Qiye. She cupped her fist and turned around before disappearing from sight.

“A master.” The disciples standing far away caught a glimpse of her ability during her departure. Of course, they couldn’t possibly imagine her true power.

After she was gone, the disciples came over. One of them half-jokingly asked: “Sect Master, was that our mistress just now?”

Despite her appearance, she had garnered their respect due to her perceived power.

“I’ll throw you to the wolves if you keep gossiping.” Li Qiye gave them the side-eye.

“I’m just playing…” The one asking gulped and smiled wryly.

The group entered the City of Demons but they couldn’t find a place to stay before being stopped for the third time.

It was a middle-aged serpent demon with other experts wearing a similar uniform.

He towered at three meters and had a human head with a snake body. His tail was long, the same for his tongue. It seemed that he could open his mouth and swallow the young ones from Little Diamond.

The group behind him were various demons - bull, tiger, treants… They were obviously powerful.

The youths trembled with fear after seeing the mighty demons. Any of these demons could wipe them out with a single hand wave, hence their trepidation.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Sir, are you Young Noble Li?” The serpent demon cupped his fist towards Li Qiye.

The youths heaved a sigh of relief. These demons didn’t seem to be aggressive.

“What is it?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I represent Dragon in welcoming you, Young Noble Li. Please stay at our sect.” The serpent demon explained.

At first, the youths were frightened after hearing that the demons were from Dragon. Alas, this seemed to be a friendly invitation.

“They must be Miss Jian’s clan members?” One of them whispered because Jian Qingzhu had invited them to the City of Demons before. This could be the men she ordered to welcome them.

“What an enthusiastic welcome from Dragon. How unexpected.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You’re too kind, Young Noble Li. Our master has prepared a feast for you in Dragon Platform to wash away the weariness from the long trip.” The serpent demon added.

Unlike the young ones, Wang Weiqiao noticed something and quietly told Li Qiye: “Master, the saintess is from Phoenix Ground.”

The young ones heard this and became startled. They thought that this group might not be under the saintess’ faction at all.
