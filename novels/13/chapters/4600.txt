Chapter 4601: Teasing

“Miss, what do you think about our brother here?” The daoist took advantage of this: “He’s from the Jian, a clan with untraceable roots and has contributed greatly to the world. He is their young lord, the sole successor, a hero among men with flawless bearing…”

“Enough!” Jian Ming interrupted him and looked embarrassed: “Nobody is asking you, Swindler.”

She stared at Jian Ming and said earnestly: “Fellow Daoist, if that is your wish, come to the sect and ask, we’ve been receiving many requests recently so you can try as well.”

“Of course not.” He smiled wryly: “Regular cultivators like us aren’t worthy of being a companion to such a beautiful lady such as yourself.”

It was rare to see the shameless youth being stuck in an awkward situation. He was actually blushing.

“Oh? And here I thought your skin was too thick to turn red.” Xiao Xuan laughed and said.

“Lady, please don’t tease me…” This only made it worse for Jian Ming. He was normally the one teasing people.

Ye Tingrong was rather curious about the group due to their weird social dynamic. It seemed that Li Qiye was the leader but on the surface, he was the weakest of the group.

“It’s a good idea.” Li Qiye nodded: “The brat has a sharp mind. Though he won’t travel that far on the dao path, his future is filled with good fortunes and happiness. Miss, if you are interested, do pursue.”

Jian Ming’s face turned even redder and hotter - the same shade as a persimmon.

“Young Noble, please don’t tease me too. I might have thick skin but the lady doesn’t.” He said.

“Face is important but so is life.” Li Qiye smiled: “Perhaps the two of you being together can help her get through tough times.”

The embarrassed Jian Ming immediately told Tingrong: “Our young noble is just kidding, don’t pay it any mind.”

The conversation took a weird turn for her but nonetheless, she nodded and said: “I will not stop you from going to Golden Gate to ask for marriage. Let heaven decides.”

“That’s what I like to hear.” Li Qiye smiled: “Let’s see who is heaven in this case.”

“Yes, a match decided by heaven will be blessed…” The daoist realized something and came up with an idea.

At this point, all Jian Ming could do was smile awkwardly. He never thought about marrying Ye Tingrong before but the situation got out of control.

It seemed that she herself was more composed than him.

“One can’t get a better start in marriage than this.” Xiao Xuan clapped and decided to join the fun.

“Please…” He only came near to talk to her. Now, it seemed like he has become a potential suitor.

“I think this is a great development.” The daoist elbowed him and said: “Since fate has brought you two together, I will prepare you a gift that I know you’ll love.”

He seemed supportive of Jian Ming for once, eager to be an errand boy if need be for the sake of this union.

“Mind your own business! Stop messing around!” Jian Ming couldn’t bark back at Li Qiye and Xiao Xuan. However, the daoist was a different story.

“Sigh, can’t even tell that I’m being helpful.” The daoist said: “Let me read your and the lady’s romantic fortune…”

“Okay, okay, you don’t need to prove anything. I know your fortune-telling is real, stop bothering me.” Jian Ming interrupted.

A fortune-telling session scared him. He didn’t want to see his future regarding romance.

“Fellow Daoist, just keep in mind that something as important as marriage is not up for juniors like us to decide.” She said while keeping an open mind.

Unfortunately, she also revealed her helplessness. A noble like her couldn’t decide who to marry. Given the current situation, this seemed to be absolutely the case. In fact, it might not even be up to her sect.

“I don’t think there’s a problem if Xiao Jian is interested, the young noble will take care of it.” Xiao Xuan was ready to drink the celebratory wine at the wedding. She happily joined in: “If the young noble goes there to ask for the engagement, then that will be a match decided by heaven. Hmph, who dares to say no and stop me from participating in the wedding banquet? I’ll destroy him.”

She looked like a cute kitten suddenly displaying its fierce side and raising its claws. Nonetheless, her aura was as intimidating as can be.

The youths thought that she had turned into a primal beast. This caused them to tremble in fear.

“Lady, please spare me…” Jian Ming begged for forgiveness.

Ye Tingrong observed the group again. She thought that Xiao Xuan was just a little girl but this might not be correct. Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎

At this point, another guest entered and became surprised to see everyone.

“Young Noble, Fellow Daoists. You’re here too, Miss Ye?” He came over and greeted Li Qiye, looking a bit awkward as well.

“Why are you here, Scion?” Jian Ming heaved a sigh of relief, thinking that this was enough distraction to save him.

The guest was none other than Paramount Scion. They met again after just a short time.

He bowed toward Li Qiye and then sat down next to Ye Tingrong. He ordered some snacks from Puresword.

“You’re acquaintances, Scion?” She found it strange that he showed so much respect to Li Qiye.

“Yes, the young noble has taught me before.” The scion honestly answered: “I thought that you would be home right now.”

“I need a distraction.” She slightly frowned.

“So you went to Golden Gate too?” Jian Ming asked.

“Yes, I just came from there.” The scion answered.

“I see, your Paramount Gate wants a marriage alliance for you?” Jian Ming winked.

“It wasn’t my idea, our ancestors wanted it.” The scion found it embarrassing.
