Chapter 4724: Borrowed Saber

A saber as bright as snow; its glow reached the far depths of space. This was a heavenly saber capable of delivering judgments.

Living beings didn’t have a chance to fight. The moment the blade came down, so would their heads. Thus, even the big shots felt a sharp pain in their neck and experienced the mere seconds before death.

This prompted spectators to be overwhelmed with fear. They wanted to scream and opened their mouth wide. Alas, no sound came out as if their head has already been separated from the rest.

“Boom!” Shen Juntian seemingly entered the dao lord realm and unleashed another strike encompassing the forces of heaven and earth.

The sheer destruction of this move gave birth to primordial chaos along the way. This move was clearly several levels above the previous one.

However, the blade surpassed everything found in the mortal realms including dao lords. The slash settled everything.

There was only one word in everyone’s mind - death. No exception could be made, unfortunately for Shen Juntian.

“Boom!” In this crucial moment, a deafening blast destroyed a mountain range nearby. This was from Speargrasp suddenly exploding.

The explosion blinded everyone so they couldn’t see clearly. It was as if a galaxy has just detonated.

The massive blast condensed into a single point and formed a spear made from countless grand dao.

“Daofall Worldrender!” A timeworn ancestor saw this and took a deep breath.

This was Speargrasp’s ultimate move, capable of reverting time and destroying the myriad dao. Alas, it required an exchange. In this case, he offered his grand dao and life.

The thrust traveled through time itself and appeared before the snow-white saber. All offenses were unlikely to break the spear. Gods, devils, and Buddhas? They weren’t getting through but the heavenly saber was a different story.

It cut through the spar and continued to fly for Shen Juntian while shooting out thick dao laws.

Li Qiye stopped his swing there and pulled his saber back. Nonetheless, the remnant rays were still coming.

“Stop!” A tyrannical roar interrupted the battle.

Two top existences attacked Li Qiye at the same time from a distance.

“Tyrant and Skybreak Monarch!” An ancient ancestor shouted.

The two could watch no longer and had to save Shen Juntian, terrifying the crowd with their destructive move.

“Boom!” However, a woman with a dragon and phoenix aura also landed and repelled both attacks.

On the other side, the remnant rays finally struck Shen Juntian. Though the world served as his armor, he still got cut and became bloodied, falling straight down.

As for Li Qiye, he staggered several steps backward. This wasn’t due to Shen Juntian or Speargrasp’s attack.

It was just that he decided to pull the heavenly saber back in order to spare Shen Juntian. Borrowing the heaven’s power by himself was frightening enough, let alone pulling it back. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Senior Brother!” Everyone then saw the bloodied Shen Juntian run over and held Speargrasp whose chest had a bloody hole.

This had nothing to do with Li Qiye. His saber merely defeated Speargrasp’s technique. Unfortunately, he was finished because he chose to explode his own grand dao for an ultimate thrust.

It would have beaten any of the conquerors since he put so much on the line. Few cultivators in the world could have repelled it without suffering injuries.

Speargrasp gained some strength back during his last moments and said: “Go, you, you are… destined to be… a dao lord…”

With that, his eyes closed and he passed away.

“Senior Brother!” Shen Juntian cried out.

Although Li Qiye showed mercy, Shen Juntian might still have died if it wasn’t for “Daofall Worldrender” blocking most of the slash.

Spectators became sentimental after seeing the sacrifice.

“A commendable soul.” An ancient ancestor said wistfully: “One can’t ask for a better senior brother.”

Strong emotions struck the crowd and moistened the eyes of the most hardened cultivators.

Speargrasp paid the ultimate price in order to save Shen Juntian. This wasn’t only because Juntian was his junior brother. Juntian possessed the style and bearing of a dao lord so he wanted to help him achieve this in the future.

“Leave.” Li Qiye had no intention of killing him.

Juntian still held Speargrasp’s corpse and responded: “The competition is brutal. I don’t need to live a borrowed life. Dao Brother, let me go out with a bang.”

“Heroic, albeit too stubborn.” Li Qiye chuckled while shaking his head.

Back on the other side, Tyrant Monarch became angry but after seeing the woman, trepidation surfaced as well.

“Will this be a two one one?” She stared at the two monarchs.

“Paramount, you wish to oppose Three Thousand Dao?” Skybreak uttered coldly.
