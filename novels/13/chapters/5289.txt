Chapter 5290: Firmament Godchild

Of course, this world didn’t have immortals so he only had the appearance and aura of one.

If one had to be picky, his only flaw would be the arrogance in his eyes. He kept his eyes upward as if all living beings were unworthy of being in his sight, that nothing in the world was worthy of his attention. He had no interest in anything outside of gazing at the sky.

“This youth is something else.” The old servant said with admiration.

“Firmament Godchild.” Li Zhitian became startled and recognized this legendary figure.

The three Tians were famous as the supreme geniuses of the upper continents. They didn’t let down everyone’s expectations either and excelled at cultivation.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

However, Li Zhitian knew that there was someone else looming above them - Firmament Godchild.

Strangely enough, this person didn’t care about cultivation, preferring to observe the sky. Others found this to be a waste of time and a misuse of his innate talent. He didn’t give a damn.

At this time, a fat merchant came closer and requested a fortune reading.

“Practice good deeds and accumulate virtues, do not damage your ancestors’ grace any further.” The godchild said without bothering to look at him.

“This lowly one engages in good deeds every day and has not committed any wrongdoings.” The merchant hurriedly replied.

“I’m sure you perform plenty of good deeds with Widow Liu to the south of the city.” The youth responded.

“Preposterous!” The merchant’s expressions soured.

“What did you just do on her bed before coming here? Get lost, you won’t live past fifty if you keep this up.” The godchild didn’t hold back.

The merchant turned red and put down some money before scurrying away.

“Immortal, this humble woman wishes prosperity and wealth for my son, please show me the way.” An old woman who dressed plainly and poor offered her savings.

The godchild didn’t bother to look at the woman either. He said: “If you’re seeking wealth, go out and turn left to find the god of wealth’s temple. Why care about money, just hope that your son is filial and treats you with kindness, leave.”

Despite being scolded, the woman still kneeled and hit the ground with her head several times before leaving.

An ancestor from a famous sect also performed a similar gesture of respect before asking: “I wish to find our ancestral heart mantra to the south but do not know the way. Please guide me, Immortal.”

“Rubbish.” The youth said: “Your mind is chaotic and full of unnecessary thoughts. Even if I lead you to the scripture, it will only end up causing qi deviation. Focus on cultivating your heart and nurturing your character, the scripture will be within you.”

The normally imperious ancestor still left behind treasures despite the harsh critique. He kowtowed repeatedly before leaving.

In fact, a king from a neighboring country came for advice. He approached and bowed his head before inquiring: “I seek the proper art of governing…”

“Don’t bother since you’re surrounded by tigers and jackals. You’re not governing anything, only inflicting suffering on your people.” The youth interrupted.

The king could only bow and thank him for his guidance. He left behind a payment before leaving with a dejected look.

Someone else came forward but couldn’t say anything before receiving a comment from the youth: “Your future is boundless, cherish it and avoid arrogance. Off you go.”

The majority of visitors weren’t lucky enough to receive kind words; some were even scolded. Nonetheless, they paid respect and left behind treasures before leaving.

“He’s accurate.” Li Zhitian whispered to the group.

The godchild’s astounding accuracy caused both mortals and cultivators to seek his advice eagerly. Despite knowing that the response might be unfavorable and harsh, they still thought that the trip would be beneficial.

Therefore, whenever he appeared in public, people always flocked to him for his golden mouth and iron verdict.

He treated everyone with the same disdain, whether it be a poor mortal or a brilliant conqueror. Most importantly, they needed to obediently listen as well, aware of his accuracy.

Li Qiye played nice this time and waited in line. It took a long time before it was finally his turn.

This time around, the godchild finally averted his gaze from the sky to stare at the smiling Li Qiye.

“Okay, this is it today, leave now.” He waved his hand and told his worshippers to leave, not caring bout their long wait thus far.

It didn’t take long before only Li Qiye’s group was left. Li Qiye took out a few bronze coins and tossed them in front of the godchild’s chair: “Give me a divination.”

The godchild’s expression immediately turned sour as he retorted: “You gave my worthless second brother a mountain of silver and this is what I get?”

“Mere external possessions, the bronze coins and silver ingots are the same for only the sky exists in your eyes.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Pfft.” The godchild scoffed and said: “What sky can I look at when you’re blotting it out?”

“Just look at me then.” Li Qiye replied.

“The only thing I see right now is an ugly face deserving a beating.” The godchild said.

“I don’t mind if that is your wish. I’m afraid it might be a little difficult though.” Li Qiye patted his face.

“Li, your arrogance knows no bounds!” The godchild clenched his fists, itching to beat Li Qiye up.

“I’m just speaking the truth. You can’t lay a finger on me with your tiny frame. You three brothers must merge together again.” Li Qiye said.

“Get lost, I’m not falling as your trick. And afterward, stay as far away from me as humanly possible.” The godchild sneered.

“Sigh, my kindness is misunderstood.” Li Qiye said: “So what if you can peer into the heaven? You’re still just a fortune-teller, unable to grasp the future.”

“Those who still trust you have something wrong in their brains, haven’t you caused enough misery already?” The godchild said.

“Indeed, it wasn’t a good outcome. I’m sorry.” Li Qiye sighed and said.

“A cat shedding tears for a mouse. I don’t need your fake kindness. Leave if you actually feel bad about it for nothing good comes from your visits.” The godchild said.

“Not necessarily, I think my helping you three merge together again is a good idea.” Li Qiye said.

“I’m living a great life right now with my insight into the heaven and the world. Why should we merge?” The godchild didn’t buy it.

“Then you can only play the role of an observer, nothing more.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“I’d be foolish to listen to you, I rather be an observer than to be controlled by you.” The godchild said.

"You underestimate the goodwill in my heart." Li Qiye responded with a smile.
