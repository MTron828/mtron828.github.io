Chapter 5561: Bestowment

Li Qiye gestured for Qin Baifeng to come over and she obliged.

“For you.” He raised his hand to show her the ruby blood. Its radiance was mystical as if it had three thousand worlds within it.

“Pop!” She couldn’t respond due to astonishment before he pointed at her forehead, creating something akin to a lake rippling after having a stone thrown in. Energy pulsed outward as he embedded the drop of blood into her ocean of awareness.

“Boom!” The ripples turned into a tsunami at the moment of impact.

As a six-fruit dragon lord, her mind was formidable and vast. Alas, it couldn’t contain a single drop of blood.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

She felt as if a colossal monster was rampaging in her head or a meteor had just smashed into the ocean, causing a devastating tsunami.

Her mind was dealing with the immensity of three thousand worlds, on the verge of crumbling down.

It demanded all of her vitality and true blood. All of her powers and essences surged toward the blood beyond her control.

This frightened the soul out of her. She sealed all six senses and activated her dao fruits. They released dao laws to stabilize her vitality, preventing the blood from sucking all of it.

Furthermore, the laws entered her mind and stabilized her ocean of awareness to endure the influx of power.

“Rumble!” A calamity occurred within as the blood crushed her dao laws. She mustered all of her strength and effort to protect her body.

Alas, even her fruits were creaking as if they were being pushed to the brink by a single drop of blood.

“Crack!” Cracks appeared all over her body, allowing a bloody light to leak out.

The blood merely entered her mind and didn’t activate its power. Unfortunately, this was still more than she could endure. It was only a matter of time before a total collapse of her fruits and grand dao.

Li Qiye interfered by releasing strands of primordial light to wrap around her body. Despite their thin nature, they acted as iron chains to support her.

With his seal, her mind and body became tough. Each inch of flesh received infinite molding, turning them into unbreakable walls.

The tsunami and detonations within her mind subsided. The collapsed dao laws and injured shell stabilized. Her dao fruits became brighter and could finally withstand the drop of blood.

Eventually, the drop sank into the deepest part of her mind, still looking like the most precious ruby in existence.

She finally regained her wits after an unforgettable experience. She thought that she had been rolled like noodles, pushed and stretched to the limit.

“Try your best to understand it. Once you do, it will fuse with your grand dao and vitality.” Li Qiye said.

“Thank you for the gift, Young Noble.” She prostrated to show her gratitude.

Although she didn’t fully grasp the significance of the blood, she understood that it could have reduced her to ashes. Fusing with it would benefit her for a lifetime.

“It’s incredible.” Niu Fen and Bones were in awe.

The latter had a taste of the blood’s actual power previously. Moreover, it was infected then, not in a perfect state. Nonetheless, it still seemed capable of creating a new body for him - its dao potential was virtually endless.

“We can go now.” Li Qiye told Bones.

“Yes, please remove it from the tablet, Sacred Teacher.” Bones became excited after hearing this.

They only managed to slow down the unknown power. Furthermore, they were on the losing side as well. If this trend continued, they would lose control over Momentous Frontier.

The unknown power would take over the entire region and destroy their ambitious plan. The worst-case scenario was that it would turn them into puppets. However, Li Qiye’s appearance gave Bones hope so he immediately led the way to the tablet.

This once belonged to Li Qiye, taken from Desolate Wasteland. He refined and added a supreme grand dao to it.

Later on, it fell into this land and became the foundation for the emperors and dao lords’ benevolent plan.

The deity and prayer system was made possible through the tablet and its dao. This granted mortals a paradise for numerous eras.
