Chapter 5628: Seven-night Physique

Everything was because of the immortal bone. It was why she couldn’t banish Li Qiye from her dream even after becoming an apex cultivator.0

The only way to prevent him from showing up was to remove the bone from her body. Normally, removing dao bones had serious consequences but cultivators could still reshape another.0

In her case, she had no idea the consequences of removing something so powerful.0

“Fate…” She understood why he had brought up fate earlier. Did her immortal bone originate from Li Qiye?0

This seemed a little ridiculous. He was not an ancestor of her clan and they shared no bloodline. She then thought about her birth and little details were known of why the bone was there at the start.0ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

He sighed while looking at the bone. He had refined it in the past and thought that it had been reduced to ashes after the battle back then.1

However, it fell to the mortal world and became a part of Titanic Conqueror, returning to life with her.0

She had both a primordial dao fruit and this immortal bone - this was definitely the workings of fate.0

“Is this the ultimate power of the immortal bone?” She murmured.0

“No, this is not its final form.” Li Qiye responded.0

“What is its final form then?” She took a deep breath.0

Just the twelve images appearing together was something she couldn’t reach. According to her speculation, if she could summon six at the same time, she would be able to fight anyone in this world. How could this not be the final form of her immortal bone?0

“Seven-night Physique, Seven-night Immortal Bone.” He said. [1]4

“Seven-night…” She shuddered before becoming frozen.0

The ordinary youth standing before her had the same name. She came up with an explanation instantly - she was not dreaming about Li Qiye but rather, her immortal bone.0

Whenever she cultivated the immortal bone to a certain level, she would dream about its final form. Perhaps once she reached the actual limit of the bone, she would be able to summon the “Li Qiye” in her dream.1

Her rich experiences as an apex conqueror didn’t prepare her for this. She had a “Li Qiye” inside of her? This sounded ridiculous but it was indeed the truth.9

“Keep working hard. If you ever finish it, the result will be unimaginable.” Li Qiye said before pulling back his hand.2

“Buzz.” The twelve gods and devils disappeared from the sky, leaving Titanic alone to contemplate her future with the immortal bone.0

Li Qiye left the astounded crowd and headed for Empress Star. Demon Conqueror hurried to catch up to him.0

He held her hand as they entered the outskirts of Empress Star. Strangely enough, the supreme suppression of the star didn’t affect him in the slightest.0

In fact, the mysterious power seemed to be sweeping the dust and weariness away from him, welcoming his return.0

The crowd saw how the duo entered the star without any hindrance and became momentarily stunned.0

“What is going on? The suppression had no effect.” A big shot muttered in confusion.0

“He just withstood it so easily, right?” An ancestor said.0

“No, Duality Master strolled in just like this.” A peerless cultivator shook her head.1

Two previous visitors had a different experience with the trip. Lunargrasp Immortal Monarch required the help of Immortal Dao City while Duality Master faced zero resistance.0

Rumor has it that Duality Master had never cultivated so he was a mortal. Nonetheless, he traveled freely everywhere and was even an esteemed guest of Celestial Court’s true lord.0

“The legend is true.” An emperor from the nine worlds murmured.2

Those from the thirteen continents and the subsequent worlds have not heard of this particular legend regarding the empress’ background.1

Back in the nine worlds, two figures were always compared to each other - Empress Hong Tian and Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng.1

Jiao Heng was blessed by heaven with immense talent. The same couldn’t be said about the empress. 0

Her journey included countless trials and hardships before achieving invincibility. Her unwavering determination allowed her to dominate in due time.0

There was always a shadowy figure accompanying her during her ascension - the dark crow.0

Immortal Emperors in future generations respected her willpower and strength. Nonetheless, they believed that the dark crow was the essential element for her success. Of course, there was no way of proving this.0

The duo never publicized their ties but their contemporaries knew of the relationship.0

Today, the surviving Immortal Emperors living on Thousand Emperor Island witnessed Li Qiye’s entry to Empress Star and understood that the legends were true.0

“His Excellency will unite the world, this is the end for Celestial Court.” They became emotional because an unprecedented era was coming to the six continents.5

An attack on Celestial Court was only a matter of time.
