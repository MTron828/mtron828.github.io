Chapter 5912: Everlasting

Li Qiye crossed through the ocean of lightning to Three Immortals without much difficulty. His primordial light nullified the countless lightning bolts, even the most destructive tribulations.

Eventually, a tribulation rain descended. Bolts were replaced by raindrops, becoming more potent than before.

The first drop exploded above Li Qiye, erupting with the power of time. A billion years attempted to wither his mind and lifespan.

Alas, his primordial light pulsed and time returned to the beginning. This affinity had limitless potential and could last for eternity. Therefore, the temporal drops couldn’t affect the mortal Li Qiye.

The next wave of drops was different and carried a karmic cycle. It pushed Li Qiye back to his weakest period - when he was just a newborn.

How could a newborn endure the power of the other destructive tribulations? Li Qiye started chanting: “Where I stand is karma, you have no power here.” Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

Li Qiye left the reincarnation and karmic cycle, forming an independent sphere to stop the karmic drops. They landed on his shoulders and did zero damage.

The sky didn’t give up. Tiny laws descended and coiled around him, attempting to curse and destroy his grand dao.

This curse-like wave dealt with special powers. Even a mortal had physical force - giving them room to infiltrate and destroy.

They assaulted the body, true fate, and lifespan. This was known as the curse tribulation; all existences were as fragile as bubbles once infiltrated.

Li Qiye didn’t bother dodging, so the curse entered him and reduced him to nothingness. However, his dao heart activated and proved to be indomitable across the ages.

This unbeatable power dominated the curse, destroying it inch by inch. The curse attempted to escape from his true fate and lifespan to no avail. It only took a short time before he eradicated this curse tribulation.

The incessant rain turned the remaining bolts into liquid form. Alas, their destructive nature couldn’t break through Li Qiye’s primordial shell.

He resembled a primordial egg - the origin of all things. The waves failed to slow his pace entirely.

Not to mention emperors, overlords, and even supreme terrors couldn’t withstand these unceasing tribulations. Just one drop could put an end to an emperor regardless of their talent and power.

As for terrors, they could last many waves but ultimately, demise was inevitable.

“Coming in person soon?” Li Qiye became the center of the storm.

Nevertheless, he smiled and said: “The heart is willing but not the flesh. Sweeping might have taken up too much strength.”

The tribulations continued, enough to destroy an epoch.

“What a shame, no true form.” After a while, he eventually sighed and said.
