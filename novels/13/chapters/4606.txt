Chapter 4607: Sworn Brothers?

“I wonder how much you can offer.” Li Qiye smiled. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Wondrous delicacies, supreme treasures, authority, any treasures and beauties, I will do everything to satisfy your demand.” Five-sun King spoke with conviction. Each word harmonized with the dao to show sincerity. This was not an empty promise, something that didn’t make sense since Li Qiye was his father’s killer.

Some might think that he has become insane, promising the best for his enemy.

“He wants to recruit the young noble.” Jian Ming understood what the king wanted to do, either entice Li Qiye to join him or vice versa.

“The other four can’t match him in this regard.” Paramount Scion joined the conversation.

It required both wisdom and incredible self-control. No one else could do the same.

“No wonder why he got the ancient clans’ support at such a young age.” The daoist added.

Five-sun King's success in the east wasn't only due to his power, talent, and noble bloodline. After all, the ancient clans there had seen plenty of supreme geniuses and masters before. These cultivators were merely transitory and inconsequential in the grand scheme of things.

Therefore, the king showed that he had a way of winning people over with his charisma and charm.

"So that's Five-sun King." Puresword told his group.

They have heard about the king's tales previously but not anything regarding his personality. Today, they thought that he was different from others. This allowed him to be successful.

The other conquerors also had ample support but this was more due to their own sect. Others had no choice but to follow them. The same couldn't be said about Five-sun King.

"This sounds like a recruitment." Li Qiye smiled.

"Fellow Daoist, I wish to team up with you and build an eternal glory." The king put on a serious expression: "You are a dragon among men. The two of us shall be unstoppable."

He directly stated his goal and revealed his high evaluation of Li Qiye.

"Should I feel overwhelmed and blessed for being so loved?" Li Qiye joked.

"Fellow Daoist, the truth is that you are special and will have supreme achievements in the future. Nonetheless, you are alone on your path. Why not team up with me, it is not easy to find a true friend in this life." The king said.

The listeners exchanged glances. It seemed that the king was ready to let go of everything for the sake of success.

"As long as you agree, everything that is mine shall be yours." He continued.

Listeners took a deep breath. This was indeed a tempting offer.

Five-sun School was currently a monstrous power in the east. Of course, its foundation couldn't compare to the behemoths. Nonetheless, due to the king's effort, it has been on a meteoric rise. Plenty of kingdoms and sects served as tributaries.

Moreover, he had absolute authority in Five-sun as well. His words would become the truth. Therefore, Li Qiye would indeed have all the treasures, authority, and beauties if he so desired.

It would be difficult to find a more tempting proposal. Anyone would feel their heart beating faster.

"I'm afraid you will be disappointed." Li Qiye shook his head: "I will not work for anyone since none is qualified."

The king froze for a split second before replying: "If you do not wish to be beneath anyone, then join me as an equal. I wish to be your sworn brother."

This was no longer a recruitment. Five-sun King has shown the highest sincerity. Becoming a sworn brother with him was beyond someone's wildest dream. This was akin to sharing the world together.

Remember, he had a chance of becoming the future dao lord. In the case of success, Li Qiye would stand at the peak as well. Who would be able to refuse?

The ones in the room stared at Li Qiye with bated breath.

Ye Tingrong became emotional after witnessing this shocking development. Who was this man? Why was he worthy of Five-sun King's offer to rule the world together?

As for the Improper Four, they finally understood why Five-sun King was able to garner support from so many ancient clans in such a short time. His method was direct and effective but most importantly, his vision and insight were also exemplary.
