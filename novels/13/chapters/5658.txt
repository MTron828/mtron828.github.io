Chapter 5659: A Heart

“Pop!” Li Qiye’s hand entered the kelp man’s body, seemingly melting it.

He grabbed the heart and caused the man to bellow and twitch in agony, akin to a mortal subjected to having his tendons and bone marrow removed.

Li Qiye pulled something out of him. It resembled a heart and was still beating. However, it was mechanical and appeared to be evil due to the tentacles growing from it.

They wrapped around Li Qiye’s wrist like armor plates, spreading throughout his arm as if wanting to cover him in armor. Black grass grew from them, the same ones that grew on the man before.

Everyone understood his appearance after seeing this; it all started from the heart.

Alas, the thing couldn’t invade Li Qiye’s successfully due to the primordial rays emanating from his hand. This was a power that existed since the start of time, the purest type available without any affiliation with light or darkness.

The light engulfed the heart and caused it to feel threatened, intending to escape. However, Li Qiye had a strong grip and continued to let his rays seep inward.

“Buzz...” The penetrating rays took root within the heart. As they multiplied, they seemed to be dissecting the heart, removing all the pieces of flesh and darkness. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

The banished darkness flowed out of the gap like blood. Once the process finished, the primordial rays melted into a liquid and replaced the lost “blood”.

The heart’s beating became stronger and orderly, resembling the veins of heaven and earth. It had gained the primordial affinity and all other powers.

With the impurities gone, one could see that this was not a heart in the conventional sense, but one made from countless mysterious dao laws intricately woven together. The enigmatic laws appeared gray as if they had been polished. Each exhibited a colorful gleam and seemed to be as heavy as a galaxy.

With each pulse, this mechanical heart released an unimaginable empowerment. It could be placed in any entity and serve as the driving force of life. Holding the heart felt akin to cradling life itself in one’s palm.

After the purification, Li Qiye placed the strange heart back into the man’s chest. Initially, he resisted the process but stopped moving after the heart was removed.

“Zzz...” Primordial rays activated once the heart was put in place. They traveled throughout his body and started the purification process.

The kelp-like strands gradually fell off the surface. He had been invaded entirely, seemingly possessing countless holes in his body. Every inch of flesh was stained with darkness.

Once the heart fused with him, the strands of darkness within him became purified.

He woke up and heaved a sigh of relief; his sanity returned. His heart became stronger and exuded primordial affinity, making him look sacred and transcending.

He took a look at his situation and was ecstatic. He prostrated before Li Qiye and said: “Thank you for saving me and granting me this fortune, Sacred Teacher. How can I ever repay you?”

With the strange exterior grass removed, he regained his former appearance - a young man possessing an ancient aura proportional to his actual age.

His carefree demeanor reflected his whimsical conduct. As he stood there, he seemed to be an insurmountable pillar of the heavens. His tremendous aura was second to none regardless of who they were.

Now, with the newly added primordial light, he looked like the son of creation itself - born from the chaos.

He was none other than South Emperor - one of the ten greatest geniuses in the history of the nine worlds. He became an Immortal Monarch after ascending to the thirteen continents and after the long years, he found anima as well.

“Look at what greed has done to you. Once you go fully berserk, that is absolute damnation.” Li Qiye commented.

“How shameful. I thought that I could contain such dark power with my dao heart.” He felt ashamed while replying: “Just a moment of negligence and it seized the opportunity to invade me. I almost became darkness.”
