Chapter 5260: Technology And Cultivation

Explosions detonated all around Li Qiye but didn’t deliver any damage. Li Qiye then sent out rays in retaliation.

The rays from both sides collided and dispersed into nothingness while leaving permanent scars on the fabrics of reality.

“Rumble!” The domain once again saved the upper continents from devastating fallout.

This appeared to be an even contest and lasted for a long while.

“Boom!” Eventually, Suppression decided to open all the scales and gaps among the assembled plates. At the same time, he sent more dao laws into Redflood to increase the absorption rate.

The armor suit turned into a fiery god; its rays received a considerable boost.

“Die!” The empowered conqueror’s rays obtained a physical form and surrounded Li Qiye.

Alas, this was still not enough to break the gauntlet’s defense. Meanwhile, in Redflood, the liquid there surged violently as if a devil was about to emerge.

Now, Suppression gained the actual liquid as well. His armor suit shot out torrents of this scorching liquid on top of the rays.

The liquid was the remnants of incredible treasures after a refinement process. They could congeal upon contact and burn anything beneath.

This bypassed Li Qiye’s defensive rays and fully surrounded his suit of armor. It only took a second before Li Qiye was replaced by a huge lump of metal.

“He actually did it?” One spectator said, thinking that Li Qiye was now ashes within.

Suppression didn’t know either. He had gone all out just now and understood how frightening this liquid was - enough to reduce a conqueror to nothingness.

“That move can’t be beaten.” Another observer said.

“Crack!” Their conversation was interrupted by cracks appearing all over the lump of metal.

“!” Suppression realized that the job was not finished. He channeled all the rays and liquid to hit the lump again.

“Boom!” Alas, it was too late and the lump exploded into pieces.

Everyone saw Li Qiye again. However, the armor suit was gone and he only had the gauntlet now.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It seemed to be fully activated with resplendent rays stopping all the onslaught.

“Unfortunately, it falls just a bit short, not what I'm waiting for. Let’s end this.” Li Qiye shook his head before raising his hand.

This time, all the metal giants outside the palace were disassembled into smaller pieces and summoned by Li Qiye.

The process was too swift for Suppression Conqueror to interrupt. It didn’t take long before a new suit of armor surrounded Li Qiye.

Its main frame had the shape of an enormous metal can - perfectly round and heavy as if three thousand worlds were condensed into its shell. Crushing stars and blocking all offenses shouldn’t be a problem with it.

The simple suit exuded immortal rays, causing others to think that this was the ruler of all six continents.

Spectators no longer dared to breathe loudly before this wondrous creation. Just one immortal ray could wipe out numerous kingdoms.

“Looks like a metal giant that has been blessed with the force of cultivation.” Apex conquerors and dao lords found themselves inferior.

“So this is the fully activated version?” Someone else said.

By this point, it became obvious to everyone why Suppression Conqueror coveted the throne of the city.
