Chapter 4509: Fire Dragon Pills

Most knew about the pills in this auction. Alas, ten bottles exceeded their expectation and truly tempted them.

These pills were coveted by the world, albeit extremely difficult to obtain. Most importantly, they were concocted by Fire Dragon Enlightened Being - an alchemist praised to be on the same level as Alchemy Emperor.

In terms of alchemy, he wasn’t a top existence from a historical scope. However, when strictly talking about fire dragon pills, he walked alone at the top. In fact, even the creator of the pills was one or two levels below him.

“Need I say more about these magical pills? I’m sure everyone knows that they can replenish and cultivate the source. Most importantly, they prevent qi deviation or in the worst case, spark the dao again from the afflicted and give them a chance to cultivate once more. The grade of these pills is superior to anything found in Divine Dragon Valley and inferior to none found in the rest of the world.”

“Why are these bottles placed above a dao lord sword art and the void jade?” One junior couldn’t help but ask.

The other youths agreed with this question too. The value of a dao lord sword art couldn’t be understated. The void jade could help someone become a dao lord on top of being connected to the mysterious Void Zone.

On the other hand, these pills didn’t seem like they were above the first two auctions in terms of value. There were also other pills with similar effects.

“Your skepticism is warranted from a particular perspective.” The auctioneer answered: “However, the demand for these pills is high, whether it be young geniuses or ancestors from the previous generations. Even dao lords might need fire dragon pills, especially the very best of them. Their grade and medicinal efficiency are unmatched.”

The crowd exchanged glances and agreed with this statement. This type of pill had a consolidation effect but most importantly, it helped profoundly with qi deviation and could mend the damages resulting from it.

No cultivator was spared from the risk of qi deviation. Even invincible dao lords could suffer this effect after a touch of carelessness.

Therefore, having ten bottles of fire dragon pills was akin to having a protective talisman against this risk. It guaranteed a smooth road for a long period of time. Therein lay the true value of these pills.

“You could argue that as long as Divine Dragon Valley still has the formula, their alchemists can still make more fire dragon pills. The circulation on the market won’t stop. However, is there a second Fire Dragon Enlightened Being? These are the last of their kind. Once the ten bottles are used up, they are no more.” The auctioneer elaborated.

“These ten bottles are also on consignment. Their starting price is relatively special as well, hence its third position.” He coughed and said.

“What is the starting price?” One big shot became curious.

“1,000,000,000 Heavenly Sovereign Refined Jades.” The auctioneer revealed.

The youths in the audience gasped after hearing the monstrous sum.

“I don’t need to say more about the effects of these last pills in existence. This is only the beginning level of sovereign jades so it is not an unreasonable sum.” A top expert from a great power agreed with the starting bid.

The auctioneer coughed and said: “The seller only asks for entry-level jades, nothing else, not even the higher-level jades. Moreover, they need to be of the highest quality, flawless, just like this one.” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Having said that, he took out a Heavenly Sovereign Refined Jade for the big shots to take a look.

They took a closer look and found that the stored chaos energy, external shell, and craftsmanship were immaculate.

“This is not a regular first-level refined jade.” One big shot said: “It must have been made by someone at the myriad level.”

Others agreed with this assessment. The starting bid wasn’t a problem for them. However, this wasn’t the case due to the quality requirement. They would need to spend a monstrous sum to procure these perfect jades. Therefore, the actual value far exceeded 1,000,000,000 Heavenly Sovereign Refined Jades.

“How strange, why not use the dao lord or golden level?” One big shot wondered: “Why does the seller only desire these low-level jades?”

Dao lord-level jades were always highly coveted and accepted as a form of currency. Therefore, the demand was rather puzzling and illogical. Virtually all qualified buyers would prefer the transaction to be with dao lord jades, not entry-level jades regardless of their quality.

“We do not know and did not ask.” The auctioneer said.

“What is the valley doing?” Wise Ancestor murmured: “They don’t need money given their wealth. Moreover, the remaining pills from Fire Dragon Enlightened Being have symbolic sentiments as well.”
