Chapter 4266: Destruction

The avatars destroyed Vastsea Venerable and Earthraiser Vajra instead of saving them. This result was too much of a blow for the survivors.

They were ready to die in order to kill Li Qiye. Alas, all plans have failed at this point and they lost all hope.

“Why, why, this can’t be real…” One ancestor murmured. Why did the dao lords kill their own descendants?

Without the protection of their dao lords and top ancient ancestors, they seemed rather weak at this point against a monster like Li Qiye despite their domination over Sword Continent.

“Why did this happen?” The neutral spectators looked confused without an answer.

“The foundation and spirit avatars are meant to protect future descendants, this is so strange.” A sect master from a dao lord power commented.

If it was one dao lord deciding to do this, it would be a different story. However, all nine chose to do the killing.

Remember, they weren’t from the same era and had different perspectives on matters. Today, they came to a consensus of needing to eliminate Vastsea Venerable and Earthraiser Vajra.

“Maybe they weren’t content with how their descendants turned out.” One expert boldly speculated.

Others thought that at least it was one explanation. Another big shot said: “It does make sense. Just think about it, the two overlords were furious enough to drag the sect down with them, igniting the foundation as well. The dao lords were most likely unsatisfied with their destructive nature.”

“True.” The crowd agreed since no one else offered a second opinion. Nonetheless, their skepticism remained.

As they were assessing the situation, the supreme avatars disappeared one by one...

As for Li Qiye, he captured Vastsea and Abyss then took a closer look. No one dared to say a thing about these heavenly swords.

Currently, he had a total of three - Myriad Era, Vastsea, and Abyss. This was unprecedented yet no one dared to be greedy.

To oppose Li Qiye was akin to committing suicide on top of bringing their sect down with them. Anyone with this idea would be swiftly dealt with by their seniors.

“Will he gather all nine?” Someone else asked.

“Just how invincible will he be? The next dao lord?” An ancestor became emotional.

Li Qiye already had Finality and its sword dao. If he were to obtain the nine heavenly swords, he would be able to utilize them with the corresponding dao. That would result in a frightening power.

“No dao lord has ever done this before. He would become the greatest in that case.” An ancient ancestor from a prestigious clan added.

Sword Sea Dao Lord only had access to one sword and one dao, the same for Violet Abyss Dao Lord. This was still enough for them to dominate their era.

“If he gets all of them, he’ll be something greater than a dao lord even if he doesn’t become one.” An old master joined in.

Of course, there were mere speculations. No one had an estimation of the power resulting from obtaining all the heavenly swords and dao.

“Go now.” Li Qiye suddenly released the two swords.

“Rumble!” The two swords flew towards the horizon like two meteors with a flashy trail behind them. Their targets turned out to be Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel.

“Shit!” An ancestor in Sea Emperor shouted. Alarms could be heard across the kingdom.

A similar scene occurred in Nine-wheel as well.

“The heavenly swords are attacking!” The disciples of the two sects looked up in astonishment. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

For the members of Sea Emperor, these swords used to be their defining treasures and had always protected them. Today, they heralded an apocalypse.

The ancestors at home knew that they had no chance of stopping the sword. Thus, they tried to take away as many disciples as possible.

“Rumble!” Floating palaces crumbled in Nine-wheel Citadel.

On the other side of the ocean, sacred palaces and shrines exploded from the might of the heavenly sword. The ground seemed to be fully penetrated.

It didn’t take long before their ancestral ground was completely annihilated.

Spectators, regardless of how strong they were, became stricken with fear after seeing the devastation.
