Chapter 4998: Who Can Stop Him?

Heaven Wheel was a technique believed to be superior to merit laws created by dao lords and conquerors.

Heaven Burial Conqueror trained in the two wheels and managed to become the second conqueror.

This conqueror was already brilliant at a young age and eventually earned the protection of Celestial Court.

This recognition was naturally due to his talent but some also believed that it was because of the heavenly scripture. With these advantages, he was able to defeat Immortal Emperors before becoming a conqueror. 

Nonetheless, there existed a rumor about a conqueror before him. No one talked about this due to the nature of the story itself - that he might have killed the conqueror right before him.Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This made this conqueror unknown to everyone. Scrolls containing depictions of this conqueror were widely considered to be fabrications and hearsays.

His title was Martial Conqueror - an owner of a primordial dao fruit. Unfortunately, he was born in the same generation as Heaven Burial Conqueror who had the support of Celestial Court.

The young Heaven Burial and his allies captured Martial, eventually killing him. The story went on to say that Heaven Burial obtained Martial’s primordial fruit and became a conqueror afterward. These were indeed sensitive depictions of the past, hence their lack of popularity.

Heaven Burial went on to create a lineage in the lower continents. Its possession of a heavenly scripture propelled it to untold prosperity.

Thus, Halo Monarch was virtually unbeatable at the same cultivation level since Heaven Wheel was the ultimate technique.

However, this was easily beaten by Li Qiye to the dismay of the other dragon lords.

That wheel was empowered by five sacred fruits, meaning that even imperial weapons couldn’t break it. Alas, Li Qiye did it with his bare hand.

“Ahh!” The next scene shook them to the core - Li Qiye breaking the sacred fruits with his bare hand once again.

Sacred fruits were virtually indestructible, only second to the dao fruits. Li Qiye somehow destroyed this notion.

“Goodbye now.” Li Qiye took one step forward.

“Fellow Daoist, no need to go so far. Choose mercy when possible.” Golden Cicada was the only one who dared to stop Li Qiye.

“That’s not a word in my dictionary.” Li Qiye smiled and waved his hand, pushing Golden Cicada away while stomping down.

“Boom!” Halo Monarch burned his own true fate to release more dao power but this was not enough.

The dao inferno was instantly extinguished by Li Qiye’s foot, prompting him to scream before being reduced to a bloody mist. A gust of wind came and took what was left of him away.

Teeth could be heard chattering among the crowd, adding to an otherwise silent ambiance.

Jun Cuican and Swordgrasp Venerable who wanted to fight Li Qiye earlier trembled in fear. They appreciated Halo Monarch’s sacrifice, preventing them from doing anything idiotic.

Ming Shi and Goldcrest were left speechless. They knew that Li Qiye was strong but now, they found that he was untouchable on top of being ruthless.

Li Qiye glanced at the god source in his hand before asking the crowd: “Anyone else wants this thing?”

None dared to answer, not the demon monarchs or ancient ancestors from the outside world.

Though that god source was tempting, they didn’t wish to die so soon.

“It is meant for you, Young Noble.” Tendril King stated her stance.

Others remained silent, even those initially antagonistic against him.

“Everyone, as I’ve said before, there is a banquet at our place. The commanding god will be there as well, would you like to come?” Golden Cicada broke the silence.

The other dragon lords agreed.

“Would you like to join us, Young Noble Li?” Golden Cicada extended his invitation.

“Not interested.” Li Qiye said.

This time around, no one had a problem with his blunt tone. Golden Cicada only smiled awkwardly and didn’t press the issue.

“I’ll be going first.” Tendril King bowed slightly toward everyone before leaving via the vine.

The others started leaving as well, not wanting to linger near Li Qiye.

However, the thing surprising everyone was Lil’ Freckle. She climbed on top of Chillglare Hawk and sat on its back.

This was a demon only second to Peacock Monarch in Feather, hence everyone’s astonishment.
