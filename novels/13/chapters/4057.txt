Chapter 4058: Want To Sell

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

The clan master’s expression soured in a similar manner. As the saying goes - stopping someone from making money is akin to killing their parents.

Plus, to be perfectly frank, the prince couldn’t decide for them either. It had to be the sect master of Armament.

Meanwhile, the spectators started talking about this development.

“I don’t think such a law exists either.” Someone from another sect said.

Armament Mountain had ten million miles or so of territories under their jurisdiction. This consisted of thousands and thousands of sects - both strong and weak.

This didn’t mean that these sects belonged to Armament Mountain. To a certain extent, they were allies with less status.

Armament Mountain didn’t directly interfere with their affairs. They were free to do whatever they wanted with their properties. Thus, the prince was being unreasonable in this case.

“I think there’s more to it.” An expert murmured.

“If you think selling to an outsider can be a security threat, there’s one way to solve this. Armament Mountain just needs to pay the agreed sum. We have no problem with that, Your Highness.” The clan master retorted.

Under other circumstances, he might act subservient and pitiful towards this prince. This wasn't the case right now. There was substantial wealth to be had, enough for them to live extremely well for generations.

The prince naturally couldn’t muster one hundred million to buy the plain. Even if he could, he wouldn’t do so anyway. They had offered the plain to the sect for a much smaller amount yet the sect still refused. To do so now might make him look crazy to others.

However, he didn’t like the clan master’s attitude. The Tang had fallen and this clan master was no different than a worm in his eyes.

These tributaries normally treated Armament Mountain with respect. After all, Armament Mountain protected them and gave them peace.

As for him, he was part of the main branch and wielded considerable authority. Some even considered him the future successor. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Many gave him gifts and treated him with the utmost respect. Now, this sect master dared to talk back to him in public?

He scowled and said: “Clan Master, this matter is serious and you need to think carefully about your action.”

The clan master had no intention of backing down. The succulent meal was ready to be served so he was willing to do anything to keep the deal.

“Your Highness, are you representing Armament Mountain or just yourself?” He said: “If you wish to represent Armament Mountain, then show me a resolution decided by the elders or a rule written in the ancestral scrolls. I will then follow their decision and stop selling the estate. However, if it’s just your own decision, I appreciate that you’re trying to keep Armament Mountain safe. However, the plain belongs to the Tang, not Armament Mountain. We can do whatever we please with it without needing to explain to anyone.”

The crowd thought that the response was logical and neither supercilious nor obsequious.

“I agree, we should be able to have control over our properties.” Another expert said.

After all, smaller sects didn’t want Armament Mountain to mess with their things. This would be a terrible precedent.

“Yes, as long as it doesn’t violate any ancestral teachings.” An elder spoke.

This put the prince in a tough position. He was being humiliated in front of many sects despite being known as the future successor?

Alas, there was nothing he could do to the clan master. He didn’t have total authority in Armament Mountain yet.

“Young Noble, this is all the paperwork.” The clan master didn’t want to waste time. He had offended the prince already so might as well end it. He would just need to move afterward.

“After you pay, Young Noble, all the estates will belong to you along with the servants in the ancestral home.” He added.

“Good, I like decisive people.” Li Qiye smiled and paid right away.

The clan master became happy again and said: “You deserve to be the richest man in the world, so generous too. I don’t think anyone can compare to you or your wealth…”

He wasn’t stingy with his praises after receiving the large sum from Li Qiye. This was akin to winning the lottery. He wouldn’t mind calling Li Qiye “daddy” right now.

“I hope you will find more success with business in the future and always be the richest.” He continued on.

Those nearby were envious and jealous of him. There was one exception - the prince.

He glared at Li Qiye and said: “I don’t care which land you buy, it’ll be under Armament Mountain’s territory…”

“Enough of your drivel.” Li Qiye interrupted him with a hand wave: “I will buy whatever the hell I want. A poor brat like you should know your places, don’t speak unless spoken to.”

“You!” The prince turned red, livid. He wanted to warn Li Qiye by bringing up Armament Mountain, not expecting to be insulted instead.

Li Qiye thought that he wasn’t qualified to speak? He was the future successor of Armament Mountain, the prince of God Ape Kingdom, and one of the four Weapon Heroes. This made him tremble with rage.
