Colorful Balloons Take Flight

“Boom!” The figures exuded powerful forces to deal with the intruder.

They instantly surrounded Li Qiye while forming a great formation. All had a shining glow of an Eternal, especially the five merchants. Their radiance was brighter than the others as if they were sanctified, seemingly made of gold.

‘Buzz.” Pillars of light from above descended on the figures inside the kingdom. With this infusion of power, it seemed that these beings were actually here in person.

“Kill!” These figures began to rotate in a circle with increasing speed until they became mere shadows.

This torrential movement caused nonstop explosions. Weapons and treasures, incredible laws and techniques; all of these aimed for Li Qiye at the same time.

The five merchants and the rest disappeared and turned into a god with countless hands. Each hand had a different treasure and used a different technique with great profundity.

Li Qiye fell into this trap. All of his weak points became targets while his movements were sealed.

Moreover, it wasn’t a random attack either. Each hand was perfectly coordinated and left no openings. It sealed all of his escape paths while aiming for the fatal meridians.

This was an ultimate blow resembling a tornado surrounding Li Qiye.

The spectators gasped in horror. No one could stop this barrage. Even ancestors would turn to ashes.

“All angles and coordinates are under siege. If Fiercest makes a move, he’ll expose himself even more and the torrential forces will take advantage of this situation, turning him into a sieve. He needs to stay still.” One ancestor knew that he couldn’t stop this move.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye remained motionless. A golden glow emerged around him.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The hands didn’t wait and struck him at the same time. The entire dimension started trembling chaotically.

The unbelievable happened. All the moves and weapons connected but Li Qiye remained unharmed.

The sharp swords, heavy axes, and domineering punches... everything failed to harm his seemingly-cast-from-gold body. It was akin to a thousand eggs being thrown at a man adorned in full iron plates.

Li Qiye didn’t vomit blood; his chest wasn’t penetrated. He stood there, relaxed. Not even a strand of hair went missing. Moreover, the onslaught didn’t manage to move him by an inch.

“How, how can this be?” The crowd became slack-jawed at his display of might again.

“Is this the mythical indestructible diamond form?” Some couldn’t believe their own eyes.

Indestructible diamond form was a well-known belief yet impossible to obtain. Even the toughest beings could be hurt when meeting a stronger foe.

But now, Li Qiye was truly displaying this notion against the onslaught.

“My turn.” He smiled and moved his palms together, gathering a blinding light.

There seemed to be a million suns within his palms, culminating into the most dazzling brilliance.

“Boom!” The suns exploded at the same time and emitted a destructive shockwave.

“Rumble!” Cracks began to appear in this kingdom of the gods from the impact.

When people could see the inside of the kingdom, they saw figures being turned to scattering specks of dust.

The five merchants were blown flying with blood gushing everywhere. The shockwave nearly turned them into bloody mists.

“That’s insane.” The crowd trembled with fear.

“That move can easily destroy a sect, or even pierce through an entire system.” One ancestor turned pale.

“Ants have no great moves to speak of. Your attempt was futile.” Li Qiye patted the dust off his robe in a casual manner.

The merchants had nothing but fear and shock on their face. They didn’t expect to lose so fast in their independent dimension, and in such an utter manner as well.

“Damn it all!” They roared and started risking their lives.

“Buzz.” A mirror appeared inside the kingdom. It looked like the surface of a lake, only filled with blood instead of water.

Lost souls hovered around this mirror and wouldn’t dissipate. Thus, the mirror carried immense grudge and hatred, enough to tear the world apart.

”What is that?” Many shuddered before this terrible mirror.

“So many lives must have been refined to create this monstrous, no, forbidden weapon.” An ancestor saw the hint; his expression darkened.

“Your Trade Federation deserves death just for creating this mirror.” Li Qiye coldly uttered.

“We’ll see if you can survive to say that again!” Green-robed Heavenly Merchant roared.

Their vitality materialized into arcs streaming straight into the mirror. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Zzz...” Their vitality naturally depleted, resulting in their body drying up. The mirror seemed to be sucking them dry.

“The merchants are using their lifespan now, gathering their longevity blood into the mirror. Looks like they won’t live for long even if they manage to defeat Fiercest.” An older master murmured.

This group was determined to take Li Qiye down with them.
