Chapter 4963: Can’t Even Handle One Move

Everyone felt as if they were standing next to a volcano’s mouth - one on the verge of erupting and turning them into ashes.

“Maddened God is here too.” Some students commented and expected this.

The villain gazed intensely at Li Qiye’s dao controller, not hiding the greed in his eyes in the slightest.

“I’ve heard of this artifact long ago and finally got to see its power today.” Maddened God sneered at the other dragon gods: “All of you consider yourselves to be righteous and have to come up with excuses. Pathetic hypocrites, just be frank about desiring the treasure instead of spewing this crap about revenge.”

The four snorted after hearing this. Arrow Saint and Reincarnation City Lord were weaker so they couldn’t do anything. As for Stone Lion God and Oblivion Monarch, they would have barked back any other day.

Alas, they were focusing on the dao controller and didn’t want to stir any trouble. Provoking this madman would only be more of a headache.

Maddened God felt the same way, only caring about the artifact in Li Qiye’s hand.

“Brat, give that to me and I will make you my disciple and teach you the way of the maddened flames.”

Li Qiye laughed in response and said: “Are you an idiot? I have the dao controller and who knows who will win in the end?”

“Brat, you are the idiot here.” Maddened God acted seriously for once: “With our flames, you have a chance of becoming a dragon lord and in the future when I die, all of my possession shall be yours as well. Thus, you will be a dragon lord with the dao controller, who will be able to stop you then? Not to mention these three continents, you can even roam untethered in the upper continents. Your current cultivation can’t exert the treasure to its full potential.”

Students exchanged glances and actually agreed with him. The dao controller was strong so if Li Qiye could become a dragon lord, he could use it far better. This would only be amplified by the number of his sacred fruits.

For example, if Maddened God were to have the dao controller, no one would be able to stop him here.

“This makes a lot of sense. Think back to Eight-stallion Dao Lord and his immortal shield, he could have done anything he wanted in the upper continents too.” A student from Chaos murmured.

“Sounds enticing but the first thing you’ll do after receiving it is killing me.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Brat! I am a murderer, not a liar like these hypocrites.” Maddened God shouted back: “If I take you in as a disciple, I will pass everything down to you and help you become a dragon lord. I shall conquer the land with the dao controller and they shall be yours after my death. I am a man of my word.”

Students thought about it and agreed. Though he was a brutal murderer, he had never lied before.

“Maddened, watch your words.” Stone Lion God uttered coldly.

“Why should I? The world calls me a madman but at least I am not like you all, spewing flowery words while brewing poison inside.” Maddened God laughed.

The dragon gods were infuriated but remained calm, not wanting to deal with another enemy.

“Brat, as I’ve said, handing the dao controller to me is the best path for you.” Maddned God said.

“I shall return a piece of sound advice to you, run far away and live a reclusive life, never show yourself again and you may live.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hahaha!” Maddened God looked up into the air and let out a boisterous burst of laughter: “Impressive, you are the first to say these words to me, not even Eight-stallion Dao Lord had the audacity. Fine, I assure you that you are not unbeatable with the dao controller.”

“Enough to kill you.” Li Qiye said.

“Brat, take this then!” Maddened God became furious and summoned meteors.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

When the crowd realized what was going on, the meteors already landed around Li Qiye.

They embedded themselves into the fabric of space and fully surrounded him.

“Obliteration!” Maddened God roared.

“Boom!” The meteors suddenly exploded at the same time with the sole target being Li Qiye. No power was being wasted in terms of radius - this was a concentrated barrage.

This was akin to trapping him into an unbreakable fortress and throwing a thousand suns at him, not relenting until not a single piece was left.

The area around him should have been obliterated, whether it be space and time or any cycles of reality. Even someone with an indestructible body would die from this attack.

Alas, the same effect happened. Only countless ripples happened around Li Qiye due to the controller’s effect. The eruption of a thousand suns was instantly nullified.

“Boom!” At the same time, Maddened God became subjected to its quaking property and rolled on the ground.

“How can this be?!” He got up, astounded.

He was confident in his own power, believing that not even Eight-stallion Dao Lord could defeat or make him roll on the ground.

“You won’t be leaving this place alive.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

Maddened God’s expression changed continuously, becoming afraid of the dao controller.

“You alone cannot handle the dao controller.” Oblivion Monarch concluded.
