Chapter 4950: You Alone Shall Master It

Images of the past made him sigh wistfully. When he stopped reminiscing, he suddenly realized something and turned around, shouting: “Who?!”

He then saw Li Qiye standing not far from there, looking calm and relaxed as if he has been there the entire time.

The old man was startled because few cultivators in the world could get that close to him undetected. He took one step backward and gazed intensely at Li Qiye.

“An old friend, I see.” Li Qiye smiled.

The old man couldn’t respond right away since this was a polite way of putting it. They were more enemies in the past but since it has been so long, feuds have turned into smoke.

They could have fought each other to the death but did it matter anymore? It was rare to see someone from that era right now. Perhaps “old friend” was the right way of putting it.

“It is fine to call me Young Noble.” Li Qiye continued.

The old man took a deep breath. His mind became calm again, aware that the feud was no more. Fate has brought them together again and this trumped everything else.

“Young Noble, the journey must have been long. How about a cup of tea?” He cupped his fist.

“A cup of tea isn’t enough for a meeting after an entire epoch.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Right, I need to brew a few pots then.” The old man smiled back.

Under an old tree was a stone table with a go board prepared. The old man prepared a steaming pot of tea made from special leaves. The result was transcending.

Li Qiye made his move while the old man poured him a full cup. Li Qiye sipped it once before finishing the entire cup: “Amazing, this tea can wash away all worries.”

“Plucked from the highest peak after bathing in the dew of the nine worlds. Unfortunately, it is extinct now after the calamity.” The old man said.

“Good tea and good stories.” Li Qiye said: “I did not expect to see you stay at the academy.”

“I’ve had my share of life experiences elsewhere but there must be an end. Everything else is gone with the exception of the academy. Perhaps this is the closest thing to home.” He said sentimentally.

By life experiences, he meant reaching the apex of the world. He had a sect with numerous descendants and recruited members.

Alas, this greatest prosperity still came to an end. Everyone eventually disappeared until he was the only one left. He came to find that authority and power were meaningless. The world now had nothing to do with him.

He was still as strong as ever but due to a lack of attachment, he became attached to the academy. He could recall his past and see his root.

Although the academy was no longer the same as before, it still accepted everyone - a true holy ground for learning. This was an acceptable home to him.

From then on, the academy gained a new member - an old man who specialized in sweeping leaves.

The “king” of the young generation eventually found his pursuit in life - home. This mattered to him more than anything the vast world had to offer. This was a bittersweet end for a mighty cultivator.

“It’s nice to have a home, the mind and heart can be at ease.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Where is your home, Young Noble?” The old man asked.

“Home is where my heart and dao lead me, my final destination.” Li Qiye sighed and said.

The old man couldn’t help but say: “I am but a regular cultivator, my dao heart isn’t as immovable as yours.”

“A regular cultivator isn’t considered ‘king’ at such a young age.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Please don’t make fun of me, I was but an arrogant youth back then. You were already the ruler of the world while I didn’t know my own limit. This traumatized me during my escape and left my dao in stagnation. It took a long time before I finally overcame this heart demon.” The old man said.

“That is another amazing feat. Many supreme geniuses never get up again after falling.” Li Qiye praised.

“I suppose I didn’t waste my long years.” The old man seemed happy to converse with someone aware of the past: “Young Noble, I haven’t heard about you at all.”

“Yes, I was far away from this world.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I see, so that’s why you didn’t participate in the immemorial war. Otherwise, our world might be even more brilliant.” The old man said.

“If I was around, it might have not started in the first place.” Li Qiye said.

The old man paused for a moment before laughing: “You’re right, you’re on a whole different level than us.”

“I was not here so there are things I do not know.” Li Qiye said.

“Of course.” The old man said: “There were numerous incredible battles. Casualties were immense for emperors and dao lords… Geniuses fell like flies…”DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

He told Li Qiye about the events in the six continents, which emperors and dao lords died in battle along with major changes...

Regular cultivators only knew the general outline, some of which were far from reality. On the other hand, he had experienced it himself so his version was far more accurate than the popular legends.

The two “old friends” enjoyed their time reminiscing about the past. This conversation lasted for who knows how long.

“I was so confident once that I would be able to perfect anima and finish my grand dao. It turned out that this was a mere illusion.” The old man eventually said.

“Yes, anima and the truths to reach everlasting life and become a true immortal.” Li Qiye smiled: “You are only one step away from anima.”

“And I’m sure it has nothing to do with my talent, it is more of a dao heart issue. I thought I had grasped anima during my youth. Now, I realize that in order to see these truths, my dao heart needs to be polished first.” The old man said.

“The dao will polish your heart. You still have a chance.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Please give me pointers, Young Noble.” The old man cupped his fist.

Li Qiye knocked once and said: “The world is like this go board, you alone shall master it.”

The old man looked down at the stone board and became immersed. A dao enlightenment process was initiated.

Li Qiye chuckled and walked away while he was still meditating. From then on, the academy never saw him again for he was busy with dao comprehension beneath this tree.
