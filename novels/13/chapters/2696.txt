Three Immortals have always existed strictly in the legends.

Some said that the name Three Immortals World came from the three separate realms. Everyone wanted to become an immortal and ascend, hence the names.

However, another faction believed that the name serves to remember the three immortals because they were the founders, hence the names.

Most didn’t know the exact details about the three immortals.

Some believed that they were the most ancient and powerful grand emperors known as Emperor Sui, Emperor Xi, and Emperor Nong.

This particular speculation was archaic and couldn’t be taken as facts.

All in all, most considered the tales of the three immortals to be legends, a topic for the tea houses.

However, after reaching a certain level, especially the realm of progenitors, cultivators would start to research more about this legend.

For progenitors, was the immortal level the final stop or was there something even stronger? This was a question only the immortal-level progenitors could research.

Of course, the most obvious possible answer would be the three immortals!

Immortal-level progenitors always wondered about this distant legend, questioning its validity.

The legends said that all the cultivation systems of this world came from the three immortals. However, their era was too old and beyond traceability. No records remained of them.

This was a timeline shrouded by mist. Though it still belonged to the river of time, no one could see its real appearance.

The search has never stopped for the progenitors. It wasn’t only about finding the three great existences. The most important thing for them was wanting to find the source of cultivation.

Only by understanding these systems would they be able to jump out of it, escaping the shackles of the systems to reach a higher level.

Thus, these immortal-level progenitors took on the arduous tasks and didn’t mind paying the price.

That’s why True Emperor Jiu Ning had a respectful expression right now, not only for the three immortals but also for the sages of past who have embarked on this unending journey.

Maybe after becoming an immortal-level progenitor, she would also walk on the same path to reach the source of cultivation.

“Truth becomes fiction when the fiction’s true; real becomes not-real where the unreal’s real.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “You will understand when that day comes, but at that point, true and false will no longer be important. After all, you’ll be at the apex with a newfound understanding.” [1]

The emperor carefully listened before nodding her head. She then changed the topic: “Dao Brother, may I ask you something?”

“Speak.” Li Qiye chuckled, still looking at the sky.

She didn’t try to hide her curious eyes at all: “In my humble opinion, you are not from the same line as us. It makes me think of a particular adage - there is always a higher sky, maybe I ask if you come from such a place?”

He turned towards her and the two made eye contact without any awkwardness.

“That’s not important.” He didn’t answer her directly: “As you have said, I’m just a traveler. This will always be the case regardless of the world, always moving forward without resting.”

The emperor carefully digested the statement. A traveler that has walked through numerous world and ages from the past to the present and even during future days.

The shadow of this person stretched endlessly in the river of time, leaving behind his loved ones and those who love him along with the prosperity of the worlds.

He continued onward alone on this path. Perhaps he had friends and companions once. Some left him; others chose to stop or died. In the end, the trek had no one but him. This would never change.

“Have you gone weary of this, Dao Brother?” She gently rubbed his forehead and wondered.

“Didn’t you say this earlier, difficulties are ingrained on the path of the dao. And weariness will go away eventually since you’ll grow numb.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I’ve heard a wise sage said that after so many years, one either becomes a saint or a devil. What do you think about this line?” She quietly asked.

Li Qiye flicked her forehead in response and shook his head: “No need to pry, becoming either one only requires a single thought of mine. So insignificant.”

“I’ve underestimated you then. Your depth is beyond my abilities to fathom.” She apologized.

She then looked at the sky and reflected: “Everyone wants to reach the apex but how many knows the loneliness and adversity of the dao?”

“To gain something is to also lose something.” Li Qiye said: “A frog under the well has its own happiness, a Kun Peng soaring in the sky has its own problems. Only one with an immovable dao heart will be able to keep on smiling through the ages.”

“Thank you for your beneficial advice. I’ll remember it.” The emperor emotionally said.

The two stopped talking and quietly lay there to enjoy the beautiful, cloudless blue sky.

The gentle breeze accompanied by the fragrance of flowers made people drowsy.

The emperor eventually broke the long silence: “Dao Brother, I’m about to depart, what about you?”

She returned to Imperial for her father. Now that everything was over, it was time to leave. There was nothing left in Nine Secrets or Imperial for her to worry about. Perhaps this would be her last time here. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

She became slightly emotional after realizing this. After all, she grew up here so to leave it forever left a sentimental taste.

“We’ll go together. It’s time for me to come to Immortal Lineage too.” Li Qiye has also finished all of his businesses in Imperial Lineage.

“Perhaps one day you will also depart Immortal like you are leaving Imperial.” The emperor said.

She knew that he didn’t belong to this world, so it was only a matter of time before he leaves. Maybe he didn’t have a world he belongs to- this eternal traveler.

“I suppose.” He closed his eyes and smiled.

“Well, if you ever see the three immortals, I hope you will come back to tell me the stories.” She revealed a peaceful smile: “Intuition tells me that you have the highest chance out of anyone to see them.”

He chuckled in amusement and didn’t respond.
