Chapter 3763: Smoke-fire Fortress

Smoke-fire Fortress was an important stronghold near the border, completely surrounded by mountains with only one entrance.

It looked like a cage from a distance, easy to defend and impossible to attack. Inside was a valley prepped to make easy work out of invaders.

Vigorous Tiger Legion hid among the walls and cliffs, always ready for long-range attack. Moreover, each mountain and every inch of the land have been refined and blessed by the sages of Buddha Holy Ground. They brimmed with grand dao power, seemingly unbreakable.

It has successfully stopped attackers numerous times in history. Righteous Sect itself has lost numerous troops trying to take over this pivotal stronghold.

Due to the peace recently, the borders were open for members of both sides. Thus, the entrance was still open despite the match between the scion and Hu Ben. This was only a contest, not a declaration of war or an invasion.

Under these circumstances, closing the entrance would show weakness and fear. Vice versa, leaving it open displayed confidence in spite of the scion’s power.

Numerous experts from the holy ground were already here. The majority consisted of the young generation of the holy ground. Some cultivators from Righteous Sect came to watch the show. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

The latter wouldn’t want to miss such a good opportunity to see their scion in action.

Therefore, it didn’t take long before the stronghold was filled with people, whether it be the walls and cliffs or the sky.

As for the members of Vigorous Tiger Legion, they looked different today. Each member wore golden armor and had surging vitality. Not one soul was weak.

It became abundantly clear that only the elites were chosen today. The regular guards have been sent away. They knew how to fight and had great teamwork through rigorous training and ample battle experience.

Hu Ben came prepared today. They naturally didn’t want to lose so they went all out.

“Is it possible to stop him?” One youth wondered after seeing the impressive soldiers.

No one doubted the legion’s might. Alas, the older experts were still pessimistic. One of them shook his head: “Their opponent is the scion, a wondrous existence. This legion alone can’t stop him.”

Nonetheless, the youths still believed in Hu Ben and his army, that they would put up a good fight.

The sun slowly rose while the fortress was the center of attention.

“The scion is here!” The appearance of the scion caused quite a stir.

“The battle will start soon!” Another shouted.

Waves of commotion resounded. Some spectators became serious while staring at the scion.

He came alone, wearing a natural expression despite entering a heavily guarded fortress. Despite his relaxed demeanor, others didn’t have a good time.

This was because he didn’t hide his aura in the slightest. His grand dao power ravaged the area like a deity from above.

It swept through the crowd; the weaker members had a hard time breathing.

In reality, the scion wasn’t purposely aiming his aura at anyone in particular or trying to increase its oppressiveness. He merely let it roam free. Alas, he was just too strong so it became unbearable. Some had no choice but to retreat in order to be at a safe distance.

He didn’t say a word or mock anyone while sauntering forward. Nonetheless, just this style of his was dominating enough. He resembled an apex existence looking down on everyone else.

They felt like insects in comparison and shuddered.

Those who have never seen him before found this a grand event. His aura was beyond words. No wonder why he was the chosen successor of Righteous Supreme.

The most arrogant geniuses found themselves inadequate after seeing him in person.

“The number one genius indeed.” One youth realized the gap without needing to fight him.

Prior to this, a few still weren’t convinced of his superiority. Now, they kept their mouth shut.

“A natural stronghold, hard to attack.” The scion scouted the area. Those who met his gaze had a hard time standing straight.

“I hope that the holy ground has enough experts to let me go all out and not return in disappointment.” The scion’s next comment was overbearing.

Despite not insulting the holy ground, he made it sound as if no one else could enter his sight.

The geniuses from the holy ground became vexed but they were helpless, too weak to stand up to him. If anyone were to call him out on his arrogance yet fail to back it up, they would be throwing away the holy ground’s reputation. That would be awfully unwise.

“I apologize for the lack of reception since we are armed, Scion.” A calm voice came from the high wall.

Everyone looked over and saw that it was Hu Ben. He looked gallant like a great general - clearly someone adept at commanding a great army.
