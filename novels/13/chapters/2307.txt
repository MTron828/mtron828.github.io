The sword robbed the world of sounds and seized the power of time. Everything became frozen.

In this split second, so many enemies were stopped in action - some were leaping forward; others jumped up for a better advantage point; some raised their sword to parry...

True Gods felt a chill and instinctively realized the incoming danger. Alas, it was all too late. Instinct could yell at them all it wants, but the slash has already been unleashed to determine everything.

Fastest in the world - rendering time to be moving at a snail’s pace.

“Clank!” Heads started rolling on the ground.

The slash had decapitated more than a thousand enemies. Though they have lost their head, the victims still couldn’t feel anything. The bodies were still continuing on the previous trajectory. They got a third-person view of their body as their head was falling to the ground.

Next was blood gushing out like a spring from the severed necks, a thousand of them - quite a shocking scene.

“No...” They wanted to scream but no sound would come out of their agape mouth.

“Thump! Thump! Thump!” The heads finally made contact with the ground. Their blood stained the ground and gathered into a massive, shallow pool of water.

Everything happened so quickly. No one saw the slash at all. This bamboo sword was able to take down experts from Sword Grave, Five-saints, and even the masters from the various sect supporting Zhou Zhikun.

True Kings, True Saints, and even True Gods all faltered before this single slash.

The most terrifying fact was that he didn’t use a supreme artifact such as an ancestral treasure. The sword was made of bamboo.

When people regained their wits, they naturally trembled with fear. Some couldn’t help but vomit after smelling the stench of blood.

“Boom!” On the other side, Conqueror managed to take down numerous experts from Five-saints then nearly subduing its royal lord.

“Clank!” His bamboo sword became luminous and turned into a divine sword with a stately aura.

The royal lord roared and created a sacred barrier in order to stop the attack. Alas, this proved to be futile.

“Boom!” The sword thrust through the barrier and pierced the lord’s throat.

Blood didn’t come out until Conqueror pulled back his sword. The royal lord finally fell to the floor with his eyes wide open.

“Not good, I’m still under.” Conqueror looked back and saw Li Qiye’s slash just now. He was completely amazed because his sword formation failed to do the same damage.

He roared and unleashed another sword arc towards Regional Princess Xia.

Though she ordered her experts to fight, she was the farthest away from the battlefield.

“Retreat!” Her guards wanted to stop him.

Conqueror simply laughed and swept his bamboo sword again, causing the formation to strike once more.

“Ah!” These experts couldn’t stop him and only threw their lives away as his swords pierced their throat.

The princess quickly fled while calling for help: “Senior Brother, save me!”

“Clank!” Sword Sovereign finally took action with a billowing aura of sword energy even before his sword left its sheath. It turned into a heavenly sword and crossed through the plain, aiming straight for Conqueror.

“Sword Sovereign, let’s see what you can do.” Conqueror still had a smile on and tapped on his bag.

More than several hundred bamboo swords flew out.

“Grandheaven Sword Purification.” The bamboo swords made a circular formation. They spun and engulfed the entire area, stopping the sword energy of Sword Sovereign just now.

The resulting shockwaves devastated the area. At the same time, he successfully pierced the princess’ chest. She couldn’t believe that even her Senior Brother failed to save her.

Don’t be fooled by Conqueror’s bright and friendly smile. This was someone who would never hold back in battle.

“Conqueror, what have you done?!” Sword Sovereign furiously shouted. A sword-like flame erupted above the sky and removed the clouds.

This torrential sword intent terrorized the whole place. All the spectators retreated in horror.

“So what? Fight and show me that you are worthy of your fame!” Conqueror pointed with his bamboo sword.

His strong response left everyone wanting for a fight. This was a contest between a young noble and one of the two weapon masters. They wanted to see which group was stronger.

“So be it!” Sword Sovereign shouted and unsheathed his sword. The snow-white rays stopped others from keeping their eyes open.

“Time to fight then!” Conqueror’s bamboo sword suddenly dispersed back into dao runes. He was now holding a dao sword.

“Boom!” The two leaped for the sky and had a direct confrontation - sword against sword. Sparks exploded at a planetary level.

Li Qiye didn’t care too much about this fight. He gently blew away the drops of blood on his bamboo sword and started walking towards Zhikun with a smile on his face.

Zhikun was naturally scared out of his mind, having never seen such a monstrous slash before and almost pissed his pants.

The pale fella walked backward while screaming: “What, what do you want?!”

For many experts here, Zhikun was completely insignificant. Only his backing was dreadful, and one of them was here - the servant of Young Lord Mu - Fan Guixing.

“Not much.” Li Qiye walked at a normal pace and smiled: “I’m just thinking about flaying you to let you know how cruel I can be.” Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

“Don’t, don’t get crazy now, Elder Fan is here!” Zhikun continued to scream while retreating.

“It’s useless. No one will be able to save you.” Li Qiye smirked.

Zhikun ran straight for the elder with all of his might: “Elder Fan, please, please save me, kill this devil!”

In fact, Elder Fan has been watching the entire time; his cold eyes fixated on Li Qiye.

He became the center of attention. Compared to a measly messenger, he was actually closely related to Young Lord Mu. He descended along with the guy. As a servant of the Mu, he was still a True God.

Thus, his status far exceeded Zhikun. He could even represent the young lord, to a certain extent.

Others might look down on a Zhikun, a little fox exploiting the tiger’s might, but not Fan Guixing. He was truly someone from above, part of the Mu Clan.
