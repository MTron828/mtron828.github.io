Chapter 5460: Total Sweep

A primordial presence engulfed the world in a suppressive fashion. It worked differently than the aura of a twelve-fruit dao lord or conqueror.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

The latter made everyone feel as if there was a great mountain pressing down on them. As for the primordial fruit, this pressure stemmed from their own blood, talent, origin, and cultivation.

This pressure couldn’t be resisted. After all, one could push up or shoulder a mountain. In this case, resistance seemed futile since it came from the source. A twelve-fruit cultivator might not be able to stop this pressure by activating their own power.

Dao lords and conquerors took a deep breath, understanding that a primordial fruit was truly matchless. Just its aura alone reigned superior to their own.

“Boom!” An immortal pagoda appeared and shouldered the primordial fruit. This artifact didn’t belong in the mortal world, seemingly originating from a higher realm and possessing untold destructive potential. It became the ruler of space - the deliverer of death.

“Beyond Immortal!” He sent the pagoda towards Li Qiye using his strongest technique.

The pagoda wielded his supreme primordial dao. Its power erupted and could erase all the sources of life during their infancy.

“Beyond Immortal” was a testament to its effectiveness. After all, an immortal was a mortal baby once - not something difficult to destroy.

“Boom!” The crowd became aghast because they still felt the tower striking their very source.

Although the others were suppressed, Li Qiye simply raised his hand akin to someone raising a cup of tea in a graceful manner.

His sleeve blotted out the sky and sealed all directions, preventing any forces from getting close to him. This included the primordial-boosted pagoda from the conqueror.

Only Calamity Dao Lord could have stopped this attack but Li Qiye did so with his sleeve alone.

He then swung his hand for he needed nothing more to deal with these apex cultivators. They were no different than ants compared to his current self.

He still seemed to be carefree despite facing attacks capable of destroying the upper continents if left unchecked.

“Boom!” His sleeve sent out a devastating blast wave capable of flipping the world over.

Every living being was swept off the ground; the birds and fish included. This emanated across all six continents.

Everyone sensed this frightening instability. Naturally, Swordsea, Supreme, Eternal, and Immortal Pagoda were sent flying as well.

It took them tens of thousands of miles before stabilizing. Alas, their vitality and internal organs shook violently, causing them to vomit blood.

Just a hand wave from Li Qiye alone dispelled their attacks and forced them back.
