Chapter 4750: Imperial

The black liquid engulfed and tried to seep into his body.

“Ah!” Li Qiye shouted but couldn’t reverse the trend, completely disappearing from sight. RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

“What the hell is this?” Both the weak and strong spectators shuddered and became drenched in cold sweats after seeing this.

The particular attack was unconventional - not relying on power and just happening out of nowhere. This was akin to having maggots in the bones.

This curse bypassed power and evasive ability. Once caught, bad things would start happening.

“It appears the two demons have worked on creating this evil technique. It is a curse, not a merit law.” A paragon from the east turned pale and said: “The nefarious ocean and specters turn into an ominous phenomenon once fused, it is impossible to escape after being hit.”

This instilled fear into cultivators because merit laws and techniques could be blocked. The same couldn’t be said about the mysterious curses.

“Boom!” Titanic Monarch didn’t rely on the curse and worked together with Skybreak Monarch.

They created a new firmament to empower the latter with boundless heavenly power.

It didn’t stop there. Pagoda Monarch turned his gigantic pagoda into the myriad dao, also boosting Skybreak’s power,

The infusion created a bright maelstrom in front of his chest. It spread around him and turned into an armor, increasing his size exponentially.

Resonance chanted continuously and sent her dao to Skybreak as well. After loud clankings, Skybreak’s halberd seemed to be a true dragon waking up from its slumber.

It roared magnificently after receiving an unprecedented level of power and released divine flames. It was as big as a star, capable of sweeping through the realms.

Tyrant Monarch, on the other hand, focused his empowerment through a dao avatar. The dao avatar then posed behind Skybreak Monarch and made him look like a godfiend. His power increased with no end in sight.

Skybreak gained a gigantic form, magnificent armor, the blessing of a godfiend, and the power of the high heaven.

He resembled a true god from a distant epoch. His halberd’s destructive potential was apocalyptic.

“Skybreaker!” Paramount Goddess’ eyes narrowed after seeing the five monarchs working together.

This was an ultimate technique created by the five. The other four focused on empowering Skybreak to deliver a devastating blow.

“Go!” True Immortal Young Emperor, Five-sun King, and Tian Feng also did their own thing, using their supreme talent to come up with a combination attack fueled by the energy and vitality of their followers.

“Buzz.” Tian Feng’s gemstone on his forehead turned him into a giant with bulging muscles. Each vein resembled a gigantic dragon. They roared to show incredible strength.

“Clank!” The young emperor chose to use his sword dao, confident that it would be enough to make him a true emperor.

Myriad sword dao came together to form a single sword. The moment Tian Feng held this imperial sword, only one sword dao remained in this world - the only one that mattered.

Five-sun King used his bowl to imprint a seal on this imperial sword. Next, the essences and power of the world gathered into Tian Feng’s forehead.

“Boom!” An explosion shook the world as Tian Feng became shrouded in flames. His power reached its height after gaining the help of the imperial sword, the bowl, and his own gemstone. This was in addition to the energy and true blood of more than ten Heavenly Sovereigns.

“Imperial Azure Slash!” Tian Feng roared and raised his sword into the air.

“Die!” Meanwhile, Skybreak also delivered a resplendent strike. Its dao laws nearly ruptured the world while gathering on the halberd.

“Boom!” He tossed it toward Li Qiye and eradicated everything back to the primordial chaos.

The slash from the young geniuses also came at the exact same time. Its brilliance blinded the crowd. Nonetheless, they imagined Li Qiye being cut into two halves.

Li Qiye’s position had nothing left. All of the affinities playing a part in the physical fabrics were destroyed by the two attacks.

“Shit…” Though the attacks happened within the cosmic formation, remnant waves still made powerful cultivators vomit blood.

In fact, some standing closest to the battlefield screamed before being reduced to a pile of blood.

“This is it…” Everyone thought that Li Qiye was dead while staring at the void zone where he used to be.
