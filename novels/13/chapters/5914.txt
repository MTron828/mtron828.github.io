Chapter 5914: Third life, Night Breaker

After the cliff was a world filled with immortal energy and freed from perils. While standing here, everything else became tiny in comparison and one felt that they were in total control of the presence.

The past and the future were intangible because the past had passed and no longer existed. One couldn’t reach out to touch the past.

The future, on the other hand, had yet to happen - just mere imaginations and speculations. It is full of possibilities but in a sense, also the void.

If life were to stop suddenly, then the future would be no more. Imaginations and speculations became nothing more than dreams.

Therefore, only the present was under control. It gave a sense of being alive and authority - the most valuable of the temporal trinity.

“Looks like you’ve waited for a long time.” Li Qiye smiled while looking at this present.

“For your arrival, Sacred teacher.” A voice representing the present answered him.

Li Qiye closed his eyes and sensed the present before answering: “So this is your true form, a reversion to the origin.”

“Yes, I am Present who humbly await your guidance, Sacred Teacher.” The voice answered.

“Injured, I see.” Li Qiye commented.

“Just a flesh wound, thanks to your blessing, Sacred Teacher.” Present spoke calmly.

“You are only the third life, not the true Present.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, Sacred Teacher. I am only preserving the present. All my three lives are complete.” Present responded.

“Is that so? That is not how I see it.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Sacred Teacher, I was Moshi in my first life, immortal slayer.” Present spoke calmly but the experiences of this life were anything but peaceful. A world was destroyed, an immortal-like being was decapitated, and living beings wailed in lamentation.

“Dingtian in the second, standing atop the heaven and forever seeking the dao.” Present continued.

“Therefore, even Heavenly Sin couldn’t bear it.” Li Qiye smiled. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Just one of many. Although I died from old age, I had done ample dao seeking.” Present responded.

“And the third life should be me, right?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Third life, Poye, night breaker.” Present said: “I have yet to finish this path but since you are here, I can only be Present.”

“Night breaker.” Li Qiye smiled: “You aren’t close to breaking me, how can you be the present?” [1]

“Sacred Teacher, breaking the night is more than just facing you, it is a long process of refinement. Being Poye alone is not enough, I must be Present.” Present said.

“You’re not perfect yet.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“I am not but I must be, Sacred Teacher. You surely understand, I must be Present to break through, so please fulfill my wish.” Present said.

“This is due to the imperfections of your previous lives.” Li Qiye commented.

Present nodded and said: “They were indeed unsightly deaths. The first one ended with ungraceful destruction while the other during meditation, not a thorough enough death.”

“So you picked me for the third.” Li Qiye understood.

“I pondered extensively and only you can deliver me a thorough death without any imperfection. Only from a true death will Present rise.” Present said.

“Not just death, your goal is still to break the night.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, I wish to kill you, Sacred Teacher, but if I stay alive, I cannot break the night and kill you.” Present said.

“Your ambition is admirable.” Li Qiye said: “To know that something impossible yet still try, how courageous and determined. I wonder if your dao heart can always remain steadfast.”

“Sacred Teacher, the truth is that no one can shake my dao heart outside of two people, you or my master. The one thing I do not know is whether my dao heart will stay the same after killing you.” Present said.

“Perhaps it doesn’t need to be because I will kill you first.” Li Qiye smiled.

“It would be a death without regrets.” Present laughed: “Ever since the beginning of my dao, my first ambitious goal has been to kill you.”

“If there’s a first, there’s a second and more.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes, I have three.” Present nodded: “The first is to kill you, the second is to kill Master, and the third is to kill the high heaven.

“Wow, impressive and audacious.” Li Qiye clapped and said: “Worthy of being his disciple.”

“I can’t help feeling proud to be praised by you, Sacred Teacher.” Present said: “Master laughed and said that although it is good to have ambition, don’t forget to take it one step at a time.”

“Your master is right, and that’s why you’ve lived for three lives.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, and I always end with a massacre in each. If I can’t finish the epoch, how can I possibly hope to take you down, Sacred Teacher?” Present spoke calmly but painted a gruesome picture. The lives of both mortals and masters would end as a result.

“It’s fine that you want to kill me but I’m a little sad that I’m first on the list.” Li Qiye said.

“Given your magnanimous personality, you won’t hold it against me, Sacred Teacher.” Present smiled: “Initially, I thought about putting my master first but felt that would be wrong, that I was too arrogant. That’s not to say you’re not equal to my master. It’s just that he taught me the dao and knows me too well. I must not be myself first to kill him, but the prerequisite to breaking myself is breaking you, hence your position.”

“True, I am to blame for creating the epoch and blocking your way.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Thank you for being understanding.” Present said: “So as you can see, I must break the night but one life alone can’t take this down. As they say, you can’t eat a fat man in just one bite. I know the present me cannot kill you, so please kill me, you’re the only one who can do a flawless job.”

“Right, it’s not easy to find a capable candidate for this task.” Li Qiye nodded: “But your master can do it too.”

“Master left after teaching me, I haven’t seen him during my three lives, I’m afraid he is no longer in this world, so only you, Sacred Teacher.” Present shook his head.
