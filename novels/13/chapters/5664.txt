Chapter 5665: One Thought, One Epoch

The inactive palaces and trinity still suffocated South Emperor. The former allowed its owner to leap out of the constraints of the world and suppress all laws. The yin and yang and the reincarnation cycle were beneath its dominion.

As for the inborn trinity, they looked immaculate and natural - being the beginning and the end of all things.

The fortune of witnessing them would benefit someone for a lifetime.

“Thirteen palaces and inborn trinity.” South Emperor had known about the thirteen palaces but this was his first time seeing the wonders of the inborn trinity.

The duo entered the first palace. Its size and marvelous appearance would make visitors feel as if they were specks of dust.

They observed the four symbols within. The pillar of life towered upward with numerous embedded runes.

The ancient runes were inscrutable but the emperor could tell that with enough time, he would be able to connect with the grand dao through them.

They depicted the earliest form of cultivation - such simplicity instead of becoming complicated like modern merit laws.

“Such simplicity.” South Emperor sighed and said: “The myriad laws and arts seem to be contained within them.”

“Cultivation is more mental than anything. An unbreakable will is a path to the other shore of the dao without getting lost.” Li Qiye smiled.

“But how many can reach that stage?” South Emperor said sentimentally.

“He did.” Li Qiye smiled: “During the primeval period, living beings lived wildly and devoured each other. He, on the other hand, observed the world and felt the connection between heaven and man. This created a method to ascend and cultivate.”

“His will started an epoch?” South Emperor couldn’t believe this and said: “Sounds like an immortal.”

“Yes, when the grand dao was just beginning. Although he didn’t start a complete cultivation system, he pioneered the way for Trinity Epoch to have endless possibilities, the first to seek the dao.” Li Qiye said.

“With a heart so resolute that he tried to seek the other shore.” South Emperor couldn’t help but caress the ancient runes on the pillar of life.

“Still fell to the darkness in time, this was a common occurrence for many epochs, nothing is harder than persevering to the end.” Li Qiye said.

“Is it inevitable?” South Emperor murmured.

“What you have seen is not the apex, there is always something higher and brighter, crossing through one epoch after another. Yet in the end, they still became what they despised the most.” Li Qiye smiled.

South Emperor thought about the numerous epochs in the past. They gave birth to so many supreme existences and epoch lords. A monarch such as himself was only an ant in comparison.

These beings could start expeditions or protect their epoch. They were born destined for greatness - to become guardians and benevolent rulers.

Some did that for a long time, staying true to their initial aspiration. However, at some point during the final moment of an epoch or the culmination of their grand dao, these supreme existences would suddenly change their way and fall into corruption. They became the instigators of their own epoch’s downfall.

The greatest cultivators with astonishing talents and willpower still failed to uphold their principles along the vast journey of the grand dao.

“Already at the top, why fall then?” South Emperor murmured.

“Why did you falter?” Li Qiye asked.

He thought about his situation and realized that he harbored no malice, only wanting to break through. He believed that he could protect his dao heart from the darkness.

In the eyes of common cultivators, there was no difference between a monarch such as himself and the supreme existences he gazed up to. Their actions were fundamentally similar as well.

“I will always be vigilant, Sacred Teacher.” He became more attentive to his own dao heart, emphasizing this aspect above all else.

When one enjoyed so much success with cultivation, they often forgot about this key aspect. They attributed their cultivation to their talent. As long as they had this gift, they could eventually reach the pinnacle.

“Two sides, proactively and reactively. The proactive ones schemed for the eternal game, willing to sacrifice everything to defeat the high heaven. They either devoured or refined their epoch to catch a glimpse of eternal life. No price was too high.” Li Qiye said.

“I see, to sacrifice everything, how heartless.” South Emperor remarked.

“Of course, what did they really sacrifice? Certainly not themselves, only their epoch. Would they have agreed to sacrifice themselves?” Li Qiye smiled.

“That’s true.” South Emperor agreed.

Overlords often talked about sacrifice and the price paid to reach the high heaven. In reality, their way was paid with their sacrificial lambs.

“And then there are those who suffered a momentary lapse of judgment or insanity.” Li Qiye said.

“Oh?” South Emperor said.

“This type considered themselves to be saviors, breaking through limits for the people, reaching the apex for the people, ascending to fight for the people. They used all means for this goal but one day, they found themselves to have changed completely and became the most detestable existence. Do you think others were grateful and acknowledged their sacrifice?” Li Qiye said.

South Emperor couldn’t help but think about the dark crow first.

“Just like you, Sacred Teacher?” He said softly.

“The situation is similar but I didn’t do it for the people. On the other hand, those who did would go crazy, unable to restrain their inner demon. In a momentary lapse of judgment or rage, they devoured or refined their epoch. Not uncommon either.” Li Qiye said. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

“I see.” South Emperor empathized after hearing this. The cause was different but the result was similar enough.
