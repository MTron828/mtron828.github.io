The training and ferocious battles didn’t stop along the way. The seven continued to grow and mature with better teamwork and solidarity thanks to the hardship.

In the beginning, Li Qiye tested them nonstop but the frequency decreased later on. It became more of a sightseeing tour.

They were closer and closer to Reincarnation Mountain City and met more people during the trips.

Some were from Immortal Demon System but there were outsiders too, even members from non-human races. This broadened the group’s horizon.

This was their first time on a long trip. They saw many strange things and a diverse group of people.

Today, heavy rain came without warning. Of course, even a storm didn’t matter to cultivators.

However, they didn’t want Li Qiye in his wheelchair to be wet. Fortunately, there was a pavilion by the road so Weizheng told the group to come in.

The rain showed no signs of stopping, seemingly would last the entire day. As the group wondered about just moving on instead of wasting time here, someone else came in to avoid the rain.

He had an umbrella made of oilpaper and wasn’t in a hurry at all. He looked quite old but still in good spirits. His steps were stable, indicating his robustness.

He wore a slightly-dated robe that was exquisitely made and kept clean. He clearly came from riches or nobility.

He didn’t have the aura of a cultivator or any true energy, more like a mortal coming from a scholarly lineage - perhaps a private teacher for a village or an academic.

It wasn’t strange for him to be here at all and the youths considered him to be just a normal old man escaping the rain.

However, Weizheng was much more knowledgeable. He noticed that the heavy downpour and the mud didn’t stain the old men’s cloth shoes at all.

This told him that the old man was a great master. He winked at the youth and signaled them to give the old man a spot.

“Grandpa, come sit over here.” Li Jiankun gave up his spot while the old man was putting away his umbrella.

“Ah, it’s rare to see such a polite young man nowadays.” The old man laughed and sat down.

Weizheng held his breath, thinking that this was too much of a coincidence while not daring to pry any further.

“This young man is a true talent, a true talent.” The old man’s eyes fell on Li Qiye as he praised.

Jiankun and the others became confused. They naturally knew just how incredible their ancestor was.

However, his current appearance didn’t look that impressive at all. Unaware spectators would think that he was only a cripple. That’s why they found the praise to be very confusing.

On the other hand, Weizheng was afraid of trouble since this old man clearly came for the ancestor.

Alas, Li Qiye seemed to be in an eternal slumber and didn’t hear the old man.

“I’ve been studying the trinity and fortune-telling since youth, I can see that you have an extraordinary appearance.” The old man didn’t mind the lack of response.

“Grandpa, our ancestor is asleep and can’t hear you.” The young and kind Ruoxi told the old man.

“It’s fine, it’s fine, we’re just chatting. I’m sure the young man can hear me.” The old man revealed a friendly smile.

Ruoxi wanted to say something else but was pulled to the side by Weizheng. She was confused and saw the school master shaking his head and telling her not to speak.

“I can see that you are destined for riches and greatness.” The old man spoke as if he was talking to an old friend that he hadn’t seen in a long time, not caring if Li Qiye was actually listening or not.

“In my opinion, you’ll live for a long time to come too. So many auspicious signs together. Someone with your appearance will have plenty of descendants living in extravagance.” The old man laughed. nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Weizheng couldn’t stay calm. The old man clearly came for their ancestors. Who knows if this meeting was out of malice or goodwill?

Ruoxi didn’t see anything wrong, thinking that the old man was lonely and wanted someone to chat.

“Speaking of longevity and having a lot of descendants, young man, our little girl has a similar fate to you.” The old man said: “Why don’t I read your palm to see if you and the little girl are a good match, how about it?”

He looked over at Li Qiye and didn’t see a response.

“I see, I’ll take that as a yes. Alright, I’m taking a look.” The old man laughed and grabbed Li Qiye’s hand.

Weizheng nearly joined the fray but managed to restrain himself. Even Jiankun noticed that the old man was acting weird by this point. The rest became nervous the moment the old man touched Li Qiye.

The old man ignored the tension and looked at Li Qiye’s palm. Next, he took out a pair of glasses meant to alleviate farsightedness from his pouch before resuming the task.

“So how is our ancestor’s palm?” The innocent Ruoxi watched curiously while resting her chin on both hands.

Weizheng didn’t know whether to laugh or cry. This little girl was too naive to know that there was something odd about the old man.

“Incredible, truly incredible.” The old man took off his glasses and sighed emotionally.

“What do you mean?” Ruoxi was as curious as a baby.

“His palm shows that he’s a perfect match for our little girl. They’re meant to be husband and wife, a match made in heaven and confirmed by the earth.” The old man smiled profoundly.

“That sounds a little exaggerated.” She found it unbelievable.

The old man excited said: “But it is indeed the truth. Young man, looks like you are a good match for our little girl, so how about it? I’m sure you will like her and she’ll like you back too.”

“Grandpa, I’m afraid there’s a misunderstanding. Our ancestor is a great master...” Ruoxi happily shook her head and said before being pulled back by Weizheng again.
