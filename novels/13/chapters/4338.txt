Chapter 4339: Ghost Soldiers

“It could be a treasure.” Someone else interjected.

“Who knows?” An older cultivator said: “Rumor has it that this place was known as Heavenguard Mountain, it didn’t become Myriad Sect Mountain until later. This sect known as Heavenguard was really strong.”

“How strong are we talking about here?” One youth remained skeptical.

“They should have been quite mighty. I don’t need to tell you about how terrifying the great calamity was. The darkness descended, one beyond our imagination. What we saw earlier was nothing in comparison. However, Heavenguard still managed to take it down, albeit they also fell in battle.” An expert from the last generation chimed in.

Hearts beat faster after this revelation.

“I see… a mighty lineage perished together with the darkness… Wait, there should still be things left behind, right?” One listener suggested.

The crowd exchanged glances as they contemplated the matter. There might still be treasures left among the ruins.

“Should we take a look?” Some became impatient.

The young lord of Dragon was one of them. He uttered coldly: “I will go take a look to see what treachery he is up to.”

Having said that, he headed in Li Qiye’s direction. He realized that the transpired event might not have anything to do with the darkness at all. It might just be a remnant or relic of the past.

Whenever something like this happened in ruins, it meant that a hidden treasure might resurface. After all, Heavenguard was destroyed overnight. Certain heaven-defying treasures might be left behind.

He would never let Li Qiye who he deemed inferior get these treasures.

“We’re going, don’t let the brat get ahead of us.” An expert from a great power understood the young lord’s intention. He didn’t want to fall behind.

The young lord was a prestigious character but this meant nothing when it came to treasures. Moreover, the treasures here should be on another level.

Thus, more risk was warranted. The great powers were willing to compete and go against him.

“Let’s go.” The majority of great powers headed for the mountain range. Everyone wanted to be the first to get there and obtain the treasures.

“We should go too.” The smaller sects became interested as well.

“Let’s go, we might be the chosen one but if not, at least we’ll broaden our horizon.” One sect master told his fellow members.

Of course, a few were afraid of death. One of them shook their head and said: “We’re staying at the ward. If a heaven-defying treasure is really emerging, it’ll be a bloody battle. We’ll all die a terrible death before even touching it.”

As for Chi Jinlin, he wasn’t in a rush. He took his time while heading outside the barrier.

Jian Qingzhu tagged along and asked: “Your Highness, may you share with me your brilliant opinion on this matter?” [1]

“You’re too kind, Miss Jian. I have nothing of that sort.” He shook his head.

“Do you think that there is a treasure?” She asked.

“If there is, it belongs to the virtuous. Sir Li will get it, not us.” He smiled.

“Your Highness, how do you know Young Noble Li?” She said softly, aware that Jinlin was absolutely a fierce character. Only a capable person could become the heir of Lion’s Roar. Moreover, he was renowned in the past for his special gifts and innate talent. This made her quite curious about his high respect for Li Qiye.

He only smiled and said: “I know that you invited him into a heavenly room. Thus, you probably know more than I do.”

Jinlin was no slouch and knew what was going on during the conference.

“Your Highness, the truth is that I was asked to do so.” Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

“Oh?” He didn’t expect this answer. He started thinking about who had enough influence to ask her for this favor. Moreover, the young lord of Dragon clearly hated Li Qiye yet she still helped him.

“You know this person too, Your Highness.” She said.

Since Qingzhu kept it vague, he stopped thinking and nodded: “Miss Jian, be careful since there might be complications. Don’t worry, I will do my best to help you.”

“I appreciate it, Your Highness.” She understood and cupped her fist: “Though I’m a member of Dragon, this doesn’t mean I need to obey my fellow sect members.”

“I’m sure someone as intelligent as yourself will do just fine.” He praised. Plus, she wasn’t a weak cultivator either.

Crystal Dragon Young Lord wasn’t the master of Dragon and didn’t have absolute control. His father might be Peacock Monarch but Qingzhu’s branch was quite strong and influential.

Even if a conflict arose between the two of them, the young lord might not be able to do anything to her.

By this point, the two of them have reached the inner region of the mountain range.

They saw the broken peaks and a large lake with clear water. Other cultivators were already here.

“How strange, I’ve visited this place before but the water was turbid then.” One cultivator murmured.

“Look ahead, it’s even stranger.” An expert replied.

They looked farther and saw numerous battalions ahead. The auras of the soldiers were incredible.

They didn’t shout or unsheath their weapons yet their battle intent still pierced the sky. Alas, they were made of pulsing light, looking illusory and on the verge of extinguishing like candles.

Nonetheless, spectators still found them immensely powerful and intimidating.

“Uh… are they ghost soldiers?” A member of a large sect trembled.

“No, they are remnant battle intents that won’t disperse.” A clan expert answered.

Everyone sensed their surging battle intent, ready to obliterate their enemies.
