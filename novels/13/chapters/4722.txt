Chapter 4723: Dao Lord Seed

The crowd watched with bated breath, wondering if Shen Juntian still had anything left in his sleeve.

Earlier, he had resorted to using his dao lord attack and wowed them all. Now, he wanted to experience Li Qiye’s offensive potential?

“Does he have anything left?” Someone asked.

They weren’t looking down on Shen Juntian. It’s just that he has shown such an impressive move prior that they couldn’t imagine something stronger. That attack might have been at the apex of the young generation, the very limit.

Why would he continue to challenge Li Qiye? Did he have something even greater?

“Hard to say, given his status, he might still have an invincible technique or treasure.” One ancestor responded.

The knowledgeable ancestors knew that the dao lord attack earlier was still weaker than a true dao lord’s attack. It had a way before being considered apex.

“So be it.” Li Qiye smiled: “I’ll borrow a saber from the heaven then but just know that I won’t hold back.”

“Good.” Juntian laughed heartily and said: “Men do not fear death. I am eager to see your borrowed saber, thank you for entertaining my wish.”

His burst of laughter seemed heroic and fearless as he maintained his conviction.

“Just one slash, I see..” A spectator said.

“I think it’ll decapitate Shen Juntian.” A big shot became worried.

“The son of a dao lord can’t be killed that easily.” One youth whispered.

To which her ancestor responded: “Li Qiye has never shown his true power before. A full-power move might be terrifying beyond imagination. It’s not hard for him to kill Shen Juntian.”

This prompted the youth to shout: “Dao Prince, just let it go, you have achieved more than enough!”

The female cultivators present didn’t have to be heartbroken by witnessing his death.

“You are the number one in our heart, no need to fight to the death!” Their eyes became wet as they tried to stop him.

Of course, he didn’t hear them since he was focusing on the next move.

“Boom!” His supreme grand dao released endless chaos true energy. Dao laws wove together to form a majestic character.

“Buzz.” An ancient light exuded from his forehead - one that could be found at the start of the worlds.

His aura and divinity suddenly changed into that of a dao lord, meaning that it contained a dense amount of primordial power.

Earlier, his dao lord aura was due to his mastery over his bloodline, capable of entering a blessed state and borrowing his father’s power.

Now, everyone felt as if a new dao lord was being born before their very eyes. His aura, albeit still in a fledgling state, belonged to him alone. This was naturally formed, not a borrowed power. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Is he breaking through? What the hell?” Many blurted out in astonishment.

“Did he just learn something from this battle and has one foot in the door?” A last-gen cultivator wondered.

“You are a good seed.” Li Qiye said: “Unfortunately, you were born in the wrong generation since I am here now. It would have been your time.”

As for Speargrasp, he became alarmed to see how seriously Shen Juntian was taking this and gripped his spear tightly.

He quietly gathered the power of the stars into his spear, resulting in hushed crackles. No one noticed this because they were fixated on Juntian. He was simply getting ready for the last moment, ready to lend Juntian a hand.

“Dao Brother, let us do this!” Juntian roared and released his dao lord aura, prompting the crowd to bellow in astonishment.

His very movement crushed space as he leaped into the air for the attack.

“Boom!” The grand dao emanating from his forehead engulfed the sky. The ascension of a dao lord was most likely no different from this.

His supreme grand dao supplanted the heaven and earth. Everyone became insignificant subjects under him.

The myriad dao immediately submitted to his dao. In fact, cultivators were dragged down to the ground by their own dao.

“A dao lord’s dao.” An ancient ancestor from a distance became startled.

“He is so close now.” Another commented.

Shen Juntian became the heaven and earth, extremely close to becoming a dao lord. He unleashed this dao toward Li Qiye, wanting to obliterate him.

“Saber, come.” Li Qiye Li Qiye raised his hand and summoned a saber from the sky’s crevices.

“Clank!” A heavenly saber obeyed his call. Its snowy glint illuminated the myriad realms.

People suddenly had the feeling that Juntian’s world dao might not be enough to stop this heavenly saber.
