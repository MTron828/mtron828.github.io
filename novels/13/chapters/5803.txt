Chapter 5803: Follow The Heart

“Beast Epoch Slash!” Hao Hai wasted no time to swing his blade.

The power of an epoch manifested into reality and made spectators tremble. It could cut through imperial-level weapons like tofu.

Light-dragon thought that he would be instantly killed despite possessing incredible armor and the blessings of Celestial Palace.

“Boom!” Celestial Court seemed to be divided into two halves, on the verge of breaking down.

Power aside, it also contained the temporal accumulation and the karmic cycles of an epoch. Another emperor near the ancestral level wouldn’t be able to stop it without a similar weapon.

“I’ll show you a divine beast grand dao then.” Li Qiye smiled before punching forward.

A kun peng of unimaginable size rose into the air with a dao causing everyone to feel as if they were returning to the origin.

They lost control of their body and were dragged into its dao - a boundless expanse just like the primordial chaos.

This was the start of time, before the creation of the world and living beings - an unexcavated epoch.

Since all of these aspects were contained in the punch, it created a primordial kun peng - born with the power of an entire epoch.

Each flap of its wings transformed the creature through countless ages and barriers. After ninety-nine flaps, it reached full maturity and became virtually unkillable.

“Bam!” The slash lost its power eventually after the impact but the kun peng’s force traveled forward, pressing Divine Beast against Hao Hai’s chest.

“Crack!” The shockwaves obliterated his ribcages, staining his robe red.

He flew through several colossal palaces before stopping and lying in a pool of blood. It took a long time before he could get up, revealing the gruesome injuries. Just one touch and he would crumble like glass.

“Pluff!” He vomited blood the moment he got on his feet, unable to maintain stability. Fortunately, another emperor came and helped him.

“Buzz.” Heavenly rays from the palace descended to heal his wounds.

Li Qiye had shown mercy by not killing him with a single blow out of respect for his courage and audacity. Divine Beast couldn’t slow him down. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Remember, Immortal Emperor Jiao Heng had obtained a primal anima and piloted a grand-completion paragon artifact. His personal cultivation and weapon far surpassed Hao Hai yet he still suffered utter defeat.

Hao Hai knew this but still wanted to give it a shot, winning the crowd’s respect.

“Anyone else? If not, then move, it is time for Celestial Court to have a new master.” Li Qiye gazed at them.

“Sacred Teacher.” Sword Emperor pointed his blade at Li Qiye and said: “I don’t think anyone can beat you in a direct fight. Nevertheless, I have cultivated the sword dao for eras and would like to receive pointers.”

The current lord of Celestial Court stepped forward for a challenge despite insurmountable odds.

“Want to see more of the sword dao?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes, I want to challenge your sword dao since I know you have mastered all dao. It is an honor to be a witness.” Sword said.

Everyone knew Sword’s obsession and attainment with the sword dao. This was a rare opportunity for him.

“Is this sincere?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Of course, you surely have a supreme sword dao given your achievements. I wish to see it since it is my lifelong goal.” Sword said.

“Very well, I will show you then.” Li Qiye summoned a random sword and swung it once, summoning a sword dao.

Sword observed intensely but couldn’t see the mysteries behind it just yet.

“What is the name of this sword dao, Sacred Teacher?” He asked.

“Follow The Heart.” Li Qiye responded.

“Follow The Heart.” Sword murmured.

Everyone could see no momentum and sword energy within his movement. This sword dao was barely discernible but they knew something special was incoming.
