Chapter 5448: The Winner?

“What if the bulwark can’t stop it?” A dragon lord from The People was worried about the situation.

According to the legends, this wall was built by countless top masters who contributed divine metals. Some believed that it was meant to stop the tower of Celestial Court.

During Emperors War, both sides had activated their tower and wall. However, they didn’t get a chance to use it due to Puresun Dao Lord’s interference.

“This is the pivotal moment.” An ancient ancestor trembled while watching the fight from afar.

The initial skirmish had evolved into both sides using actual strategies prepared for eras now. The wall and the tower could decide everything.

“I don’t care who wins, just end this already.” Someone said, not caring about either side.

The majority of inhabitants didn’t care for the divide when their survival was on the line.

“Rumble!” The tower finally made contact with the wall. The former pulsed brightly and controlled the power of the celestial bodies, wanting to push through.

The wall also became resplendent and colorful, activating its fullest potential. The metals harmonized; their individual powers were stacked up into layers and became far more effective. Great figures appeared - the remnant forces of those who had blessed the wall in the past.

Both focused the full brunt of their power on the battlefield. Alas, due to their size, everyone in the upper continents could see the fight clearly.

The apex cultivators halted their individual fight and retreated to their camp, channeling their power into the respective artifact.

Strands of power leaked into the upper continents; a single one could take down a kingdom. The top cultivators were already destructive on their own. Once together, the devastation multiplied and reached a different scale.

Some of these cultivators had no problem unleashing devastation upon the rest of the world. They found that casualties were just a part of war even when they numbered in the billions.

“Rumble!” Both sides didn’t hold back and gave everything they had to power the artifacts. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

It seemed to be a stalemate - the tower couldn’t take down the wall in just a short time.

“Buzz.” Another portal appeared on the battlefield - a group of cultivators wearing regal outfits and possessing impressive auras.

They were led by a dazzling youth who would always be at the center of attention due to his presence. He seemed capable of stopping time itself and gave people a sense of security.

“The Imperial Clan.” Neutral spectators became serious after seeing them.

Only the mightiest dragon lords and conquerors could stand close enough to watch. Regular cultivators and ancestors were stuck in the upper continents, completely frozen from the pressure.

“Li Zhitian and his clan.” Someone murmured.

The progenitor of the clan was none other than the renowned Crimson Emperor. They were a pillar of Heaven Alliance; their absence was certainly noticed in the war until now.

“Reinforcement for Heaven Alliance.” A dragon lord commented.

“Buzz.” Another portal appeared near the battlefield, allowing a different group to come out. They lacked the Imperial Clan’s regal aura but seemed to be even stronger.
