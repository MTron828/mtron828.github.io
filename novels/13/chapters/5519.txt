Chapter 5520: I Do Not Agree

“Senior Sister, you were one step ahead of me so you are more qualified to lead Sunset Glow Valley, and it’s time for me to go outside as well.” Qin Baifeng said.

“The one step doesn’t matter since neither of us was approved by the immortal artifact. We are not qualified.” Sunset Glow Goddess shook her head.

“It’s a failure this time.” The matron announced: “Keep working hard and perhaps success will come next time.”

“It’ll be difficult.” Qin Baifeng smiled wryly. As a six-fruit dragon lord, she didn’t even come close to reaching the end of the valley, let alone being approved.

In fact, she thought that having twelve fruits might still not be enough to trek through the radiance. Anima and reaching the true self might be the requirement.

“Next time.” The matron consoled everyone. In reality, they had a long path before them.

“Matron, no need for next time.” The goddess pulled Li Qiye out of the crowd.

He smiled and obliged.ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“I am sure the young noble can reach the immortal artifact.” She held his hand, looking rather intimate.

“First Sister is so bold while being in a relationship.” One disciple said with admiration.

“Is it time for picking the Emperor Consort? Will he be the first outsider chosen?” Another became surprised.

“From an outsider to Emperor Consort, that would be a beautiful tale.” One more said.

“Outsider? Didn’t you see his control over the true scripture? No outsider can do that.” A different disciple disagreed.

“Yes, he is one of us, born to become our Emperor Consort.” Many nodded in agreement.

“You’re right, that’s why First Sister kept on bringing fate up, he was born to become our Emperor Consort.” A female disciple said with a smile.

Their impression of Li Qiye had only improved after witnessing his mastery of the scripture.

“Young Noble, do you wish to try?” The matron stared at Li Qiye.

“Coincidentally enough, I am here for the artifact.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Then we’ve come to an agreement.” The goddess happily said.

Qin Baifeng had no problem with this suggestion, the same for the matron. Since the trio was the strongest in the valley, who would challenge their decision?

“I do not agree!” Mu Shaoyun stepped forward and shouted.

“Senior Brother, what do you have to say?” The goddess frowned.

“He is an outsider, unqualified to take the test.” He asserted.

“Senior Sister can pick him as her Emperor Consort.” Qin Baifeng interjected.

“According to our ancient tradition, Junior Sister would need to be the valley lord first before picking an Emperor Consort, that is not the case right now.” He responded: “Since he is neither a disciple nor our Emperor Consort, he is not eligible to participate. We can’t just change the rules as we please.”

The matron’s expression soured after hearing this but she didn’t get involved. Other disciples exchanged glances and somewhat agreed with his logic despite supporting the blooming romance.

“I believe I am more qualified than anyone in the sect regarding this matter. I trained hard for a century as a member of Sunset Glow and became a dragon lord, the strongest among the outer disciples. Is it fair that I’m being brushed aside?” He continued.

Others contemplated the matter. Shaoyun was the fourth strongest in the sect and most importantly, he was an official member of Sunset Glow.

Moreover, they knew about his crush on the goddess. Most thought that they were going to be together. Alas, Li Qiye came out of nowhere and it was clear that she had feelings for him.

Nonetheless, they couldn’t quite tell Shaoyun to stop because in a sense, he was the victim here.

“Senior Brother Mu, an outer disciple does not have decision-making authority.” Sunset Glow Goddess said: “The matron, Senior Sister Qin, and I will decide this matter. Please stand aside.”

Though she was not the valley lord, her words carried immense authority. Although Qin Baifeng was stern and dignified, most considered the goddess to be the pillar of the sect.

She was also right in that regardless of Shaoyun’s strength, he was still an outer disciple. Although the sect didn’t hold back on its resources in grooming him, he still didn’t have actual authority.

“Junior Sister, I speak for the prosperity and legacy of our sect.” Shaoyun didn’t relent.

“This is the reason why you couldn’t become an inner disciple. You are a seed of discord.” The matron suddenly spoke and silence ensued.

Disciples thought about it and some had sensed his ambition before. Moreover, they also trusted the matron’s judgment.

Her words alone decided Shaoyun’s fate - forever to be an outer disciple.

“Ancestor, I must voice my grievance with that statement. My Sunset Glow dao is at grand completion. Although I have no authority, I should be more qualified than an outsider.” Shaoyun protested.

“What do you want then?” Qin Baifeng’s expression darkened, clearly having a more aggressive style than her senior sister.

“Nothing, I just want to find out more about this outsider, his background and such. Thus, I want to challenge him, to see if he’s qualified.” Shaoyun said.
