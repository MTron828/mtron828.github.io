Chapter 4996: A Single Smash

“Come, brat.” Halo Monarch stepped forward, shooting out intimidating rays from his eyes.

Weaker beings felt the urge to prostrate, not daring to stare straight at this magnificent ruler.

“Boom!” He released his endless vitality and covered all of Demon.

“So this is a five-fruit dragon lord.” Both men and demons became alarmed at this display of power.

“Make your move before it’s too late.” Li Qiye smiled, astounding the crowd with his reckless arrogance.

“Very well, let’s see what you can do then.” Halo was livid.

His sacred fruits appeared and exuded an immense amount of dao energy. Each fruit represented a supreme dao.

“Boom!” The dao came together to form five rings intertwining together. This created a domain trapping everything.

“Heavenseal Penta-loops!” He roared.

“Already?!” Jun Cuican didn’t expect this at all because Halo immediately used his ultimate technique.

The area around Li Qiye was sealed and he couldn’t see anything beyond the five rings.

“Rumble!” The crowd saw the rings multiply and become increasingly stronger.

Some of them belonged to the fire affinity. Another group turned into blades capable of severing the cycles of reality. The third served as shackles, attaching themselves to Li Qiye…

It appeared as if he was stuck in a machine with countless sharp cogs. They started to turn, wanting to reduce them to bits.

There was no place to hide since the dao rings have firmly locked around Li Qiye like numerous immortal ropes.

“Not good!” Tendril King could see through the domain and shouted.

“Either death or grievous injuries.” Jun Cuican’s eyes narrowed, able to tell that he was one level weaker than Halo Monarch currently.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

Chillglare Hawk and Golden Cicada King watched attentively as well. They didn’t think that there was a favorable outcome for Li Qiye.

“Child’s play.” Li Qiye simply raised his arms without activating any grand dao.

“Boom!” The rings locking him instantly crumbled. 

He then waved his hand casually and obliterated all the other rings in the blink of an eye.

The myriad dao exploded and everyone saw the vision of a great palm smashing them into smithereens. All the dragon lords and demon monarchs were horrified.

“Ugh…” Halo Monarch was the only one actually struck by the palm, causing him to slam into the ground. He quickly got back up and vomited a mouthful of blood.

This left everyone speechless since he was a supreme genius with five sacred fruits. He was absolutely a top dog in the lower continents.

Alas, Li Qiye smashed him down so easily, leaving behind serious injuries. Nonetheless, they witnessed it with their own eyes.

Ming Shi and Goldcrest saw Li Qiye do something similar in the past. However, he had the dao controller then. Now, he was using his own power.

Yunyun was the only one unaffected because she saw how he dealt with Shadowrider that night.

The astounded dragon lords thought that the only other person capable of doing this in the lower continents was Conceal Conqueror. This simply didn’t make any sense.

She was famous; her exploits were known to all. On the other hand, Li Qiye had only shown up recently. How could he be so strong already?

“I’ll send you on your way now.” Li Qiye walked toward the monarch.

Halo’s expression darkened. He had never experienced anything like this during his long years as a cultivator. He thought that he could last ten moves against Conceal Conqueror.

This made him think that he was merely dreaming - to lose in the first exchange against a junior.
