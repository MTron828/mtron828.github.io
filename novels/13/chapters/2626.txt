Venerable Deer Merchant’s attitude took the crowd like a storm. Who in Imperial was worthy of this polite act from him? They racked their brains and couldn’t come up with anything.

“Senior, the ancestor is doing well. He has been relaxing at home and teaching us after leaving his isolated cultivation.” Lu Weijun smiled.

His expression became smugger as he arched out his chest after bringing up his ancestor.

“Hundred-days? Last name Lu...” An old Eternal carefully pondered and finally recalled something: “It can’t be? Hundred-days Daoist?”

He was alarmed because this was a legendary character.

“Hundred-days Daoist? Who?” It was surprising to see this old Eternal acting so shocked. In fact, this title was unfamiliar to everyone.

“He’s from several generations ago.” The Eternal put on a solemn expression: “When he was around, if we were to pick the strongest person in Imperial, it wouldn’t be Gu Yifei. Hundred-days Daoist was invincible back then. The current Gu Yifei might not be his match either.” Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“That strong?” This gave the crowd a jolt.

“Very, he was an Epoch Eternal back then and swept through Imperial, unmatched.” The Eternal said: “Several True Emperors working together from Nine Secrets still lost to him.”

He was from that period so he became emotional while digging through his memories.

“An Epoch Eternal from that long ago?” The crowd was amazed since not many of them were around in Imperial. Gu Yifei was one of these rare beings.

“Later on, his lifespan came to an end so he sealed himself for a final cultivation, wishing to break through the limit to reach the apex. Alas, no news came later, everyone thought that he died in this attempt. But for him to come out now? Did he come back to life?” The old Eternal elaborated.

“We have nothing but admiration for Senior Hundred-days’ achievement.” A distant voice came from the Gold Gourd.

This caught the crowd off guard. Everyone thought that it was only a treasure but it turned out that there were people inside.

“His becoming an Everlasting is wondrous, far beyond what we can do. It’s a shame we couldn’t congratulate him back then.” The voice continued.

“You’re too kind, Esteemed King, we welcome you as a guest at any time.” Lu Weizheng laughed.

“What?!” Both the normal cultivators and invincible Eternals got chills.

“Everlasting?! The daoist has become an Everlasting Eternal!” One old man acted like a cat with its tail stepped on: “He has successfully broken through the death tribulation and became an Everlasting!”

“Everlasting... an existence capable of fighting against a progenitor...” Gasps and wows could be heard.

This news shook the crowd to the core. An Everlasting was a being comparable to a progenitor. This was the apex of all True Gods, the ultimate goal.

“Since when does Imperial Lineage have an Everlasting? The last time an Everlasting left Imperial was several generations ago.” One ancestor murmured.

Imperial Lineage had no lack of brilliant Eternals in its history. However, after reaching a certain power level, they would leave for Immortal Lineage since it was far easier to become an Everlasting there.

Plus, staying behind would create a huge burden for their sects. That’s why all Everlastings in Imperial Lineage were heaven-defying for being able to stay behind.

“A real Everlasting, this position has been empty for so long in our world...” An Eternal regained his wits and said.

It didn’t take long before people found out that Lu Weijun was Hundred-days Daoist’s distant descendant. His bloodline was the same as the daoist so he was considered to be part of the orthodox branch.

As the descendant of an Everlasting and the successor of the Lu, Weijun obviously had an important and prestigious position.

People understood why the deer merchant and the four kings acted politely towards this junior. It was all due to Hundred-days Daoist. As the adage goes - one can ignore the monks but be mindful of Buddha.

Needless to say, no one would want to offend Weijun because of his ancestor.

“The number one expert of Imperial is no longer Gu Yifei, it’s the daoist again.” Someone commented.

Gu Yifei wasn’t a match for the daoist who had successfully become an Everlasting through his final cultivation attempt.

The former was undoubtedly strong but the gap between an Eternal and an Everlasting was impossible to cross. The power disparity couldn’t be overcome.

The area outside the city became lively. Everyone wanted to make connections with him.

Of course, the guy was too arrogant. Even tributes and gifts were looked down upon. Nevertheless, his ship was as busy as a marketplace with visitors coming nonstop.

Remember, befriending or making connections with an Everlasting was very important for any individual or sect. It would greatly affect their future.

“Buzz.” A boundless imperial aura rushed out of the Mu’ camp and illuminated the sky.

“Rumble!” A True Emperor has arrived, evident by the surge of majestic power.

“Puresword True Emperor is here!” Someone shouted.

All eyes turned towards the camp. Though they couldn’t see him, they knew he was there.

“An emperor is finally about to show his stuff.” Another commenter said.

Everyone knew the famous emperor since he was a brilliant genius. They couldn’t wait to see him in action.

“Who’s stronger between the emperor and Fiercest?” Someone said softly.

The crowd pondered. Fiercest came to their mind first because he was simply unfathomable even now.

However, the famous emperor wasn’t a weakling either. No one could be sure.

“Boom!” Violet radiance emitted from the gourd. This artifact seemingly wanted to suppress the firmaments.

“Are the four Esteemed Kings joining too?” People shuddered at the gourd’s destructive power.

The deer merchant’s forest also started glowing green like an endless ocean. Waves of green light drowned the world after loud explosions.

“Same with Venerable Deer Merchant.” Another became startled.

“Rumble!” The Adamantine Tree’s branches swayed back and forth, sending out a resonating force.

“Mingluo City belongs to the world, any attempt at monopoly will be swiftly met with retribution.” Lu Weijun announced, clearly aiming at Li Qiye. His stance represented the intent of Hundred-days Daoist.

Everyone stared nervously at Mingluo, waiting for Fiercest to show himself.
