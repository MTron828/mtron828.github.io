Chapter 4836: Old Friends

Li Qiye then raised his hand and summoned a dao crest from the Primordial Tree. This artifact poured down primordial dao laws, clearly having been gestated by this wondrous energy force.

Wearing the crest was the same as controlling the primordial and becoming the ruler of this epoch - the apex of the dao.

He placed it on Primeval Old Ghost’s head and spoke: “The karmic ties continue in the endless cycle.”

Primeval accepted the crest and slightly lowered his head toward Li Qiye. The primordial light washed and made him return to the start of time, allowing him to see the birth of an epoch and blessing him with its accumulation.

Li Qiye then glanced around and said: “The sky will not fall and the earth will not shatter. May we walk down this path, hand in hand.”

The overlords - whether it be those hiding underground or among the stars - lowered their head before disappearing from sight. Primeval also returned to his abode.

“Boom!” Silly Da shouted something before turning back into a star and returning to the galaxy.

Peace returned to Eight Desolaces with the overlords gone. Winds blew and rivers ran their course like before.

This was the start of something new for Eight Desolaces - an unprecedented golden age.

At this point, the Supreme Monarch, Seven Martial Goddess, Tantai Ruonan, and others landed nearby.

“Young Master.” Tantai Ruonan was closest to Li Qiye given their precious time together. She had spent the most time with him out of the group. Their relationship was rather special and her sentiments for him remained after all these years.

Today, he became an untouchable epoch lord. Though they were exceptional cultivators, they still felt insignificant before this great being.

However, Li Qiye hid his aura and assumed his normal state. He gave Tantai Ruonan a deep hug.

“You’ve accomplished your life-long goal.” He spoke softly.

She embraced him back. Eras have gone like the blink of an eye along with many people. Nonetheless, she was still here, the same for Li Qiye. Moreover, the shadow haunting her was finally gone.

“You still look the same as before, Young Master.” She said.

“That’s my life.” He responded as she leaned her head into his chest.

This was a rare moment of joy in their life, feeling the warmth of others. Otherwise, if they were to lose this warmth and no longer appreciate it, the world would be meaningless to them.

“Keep on living.” He let go and gently caressed her face.

“I shall.” She stared straight into his eyes and his soul before standing to the side, trying her best to remember this moment forever.

Next was Seven Martial Goddess. She bowed deeply and he accepted her grand gesture. He touched her forehead and bestowed the power of the primordial on her.

The Supreme Monarch also approached. She was none other than Nightyearn Butterfly Monarch - Chi Xiaodie. [1]

She stared at Li Qiye without blinking once. Memories of the distant era played in her mind, still as beautiful and worth remembering as ever.

The past was long gone yet the aftertaste was unforgettable.

“An eternal dao heart. You look the same as before.” Li Qiye said.

It was a miracle that she was still alive compared to the others. She possessed an indomitable will despite lacking cultivation talent and bloodline.

Her pursuit was to survive in order to wait and protect, never wavering even for a moment.

“Same to you, Young Noble.” She said and thought that all of her efforts was worth it for this meeting.

He touched her hair gently without being intrusive. The wind carried her sweet fragrance and made him take a deep breath.

“I still remember your young self. Youth is such a happy time.” He said sentimentally.

She grabbed his hand tightly, closed her eyes, and placed it on her heart. As she felt his warmth permeating to her heart and mind, she found that the world was still full of possibilities and happiness. It seemed that her watch was still not over.

“As long as you’re around, so will I.” She concluded.

He couldn’t help but smile. She stared at his smile in a daze. Upon their first meeting, she found him annoying but now, she simply wanted to remember his appearance.

“Yes.” He said.

She nodded and thought that his warmth made the previous eras all worth it.

With that, he floated up in the air to meet the gods by the Void Zone. He was still the same while they have grown old.

They were once foolish and prideful teenagers. The past seemed so close yet so distant.

Li Qiye’s eyes fell upon an old man wearing a gray robe. He had an ancient aura resembling one of an old statue.

“Zhang Yu.” Li Qiye smiled and recalled his name.

“First Brother!” The old man got on his knees and bowed. Tears streamed down his cheeks since Li Qiye still remembered him.

He was only a regular disciple of Cleansing Incense but due to the first brother’s help, he eventually became a true god.

“It’s alright, don’t get all sentimental on me now.” Li Qiye helped him up and patted his shoulder.

“First Brother.” A different old man came over and bowed. He had a steady temperament and carried a special plate with vivid images of carps and dragons.

“Daoli.” Li Qiye recognized him as well.

He was Qu Daoli, another member of Cleansing Incense who managed to live this long.

“What about me, First Brother?” Another old god joined the conversation. He looked noble and imposing.L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Remember when I beat you down with the serpent stick?” Li Qiye smirked.

“Of course, I think about it all the time.” Luo Fenghua had an expression of yearning. He was savagely beaten by Li Qiye before during many lessons. Now, he was a peerless ancient ancestor of Cleansing Incense.

Li Qiye then turned his sight toward another old man. Unfortunately, this one was on the verge of death with depleted vitality.

“First Brother.” He prostrated and greeted.

“Look at you, even older than me.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I owe it all to you, First Brother.” Tu Buyu said.
