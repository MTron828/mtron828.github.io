Chapter 4341: Treasures

The surface of the lake became shiny with numerous colors after the buzzes.

“What is happening?” The waves of light indicated that something was floating beneath, most likely a treasure.

“So there is really a peerless treasure underground?” A disciple from a large sect shouted.

“Don’t you mean at the bottom of a lake?” A friend interjected.

The atmosphere became tense right away. Groups exchanged glances; some became eager to give it a shot.

“Impossible. This place has been visited by countless people. They came and searched the entire mountain range, this included dao lords as well. Any treasure would have been taken away long ago.” An old cultivator disagreed.

“Hard to say.” A clan expert politely responded: “It’s been a long time yet these souls still remain until today. Why didn’t the top masters who visited ferry them away?”

Others didn’t disagree with this point of view.

The light from the lake became brighter and brighter. Pillars of light of different colors manifested into reality.

“It really does look like a top artifact.” Someone else said.

“I wonder what it is.” Some began gripping their weapon, ready to compete for this treasure.

They all knew that fierce competition was inevitable and it’ll get bloody too.

Visual phenomena started showing themselves amidst the radiance - an eagle soaring in the air with wings large enough to blot out the sun.

“Raa!” A wolf of unimaginable size howled at heaven. Its tail was as long as a mountain range.

Many more phenomena shocked the crowd.

“I’m absolutely sure that there is a divine treasure down there!” Someone shouted.

Even a fool could tell that the thing down there must be incredible.

“Splash! Splash!” The surface of the lake had violent waves and bubbles, further tempting the crowd.

Many immediately dived into the water and swam for the bottom.

“Activate!” One activated his heavenly gaze. His eyes shot out two rays in order to see through the water.

“Get ready for the treasure.” One group standing on the shore watched with their weapons drawn.

In reality, it didn’t matter who got the treasure first. The one who could leave this place with it would be the true winner.

“There’s nothing!” A diver got out and shouted.

Many more left the water and had the same conclusion.

As for Li Qiye, he seemed amused by their enthusiasm and raised his hand.

“Boom!” The next light pillar eclipsed all the previous, seemingly piercing the firmament itself. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

A tsunami was started in the lake and blew all the divers out. They fell to the shore, looking confused like fish out of the water.

“Clank!” The treasure they have been waiting for finally showed up. There were five gates with unique totems. To the center was an ancient lamp.

The gates looked ancient and made of a material resembling bronze. They must have been underground for a long time now.

The totems consisted of various mythical creatures - giant eagle, divine bird, god mouse… They looked vivid and animated, seemingly ready to fly out of the gates.

The lamp was even older than the gates. It had green rust everywhere from being submerged in water for so long. There was nothing to light up inside; only the shell was left.

There was a clear difference between the lamp and the gates. All of them were old but due to the visual phenomena and radiance on the gates, they were clearly special treasures. The same couldn’t be said for the old lamp.

“This is it…” Spectators became emotional and immediately summoned their weapons.

As for Li Qiye, he was the closest and reached for the lamp and the five-sided gate.

“Leave it alone!” The golden daughter of Soaring Feather was the first to attack. She swung her sword without showing any mercy, wanting to kill Li Qiye.

She had no qualm against killing him for this divine artifact. Many others felt the same way. For example, the young lord of Flow joined as well.

“They’re mine!” The whip in his hand soared forward, wanting to coil around the five gates in order to pull them back.

Li Qiye simply waved his hand and one of the gates turned into an impregnable wall.

“Boom!” It easily blocked both the sword slash and the whip.

Other experts from the great powers initiated their attack as well. Li Qiye became surrounded in no time at all.

“Stay back.” Not everyone joined the first wave. Some remained patient and observed the situation.

As the saying goes - the mantis stalks the cicada, unaware of the oriole in waiting.

“Back off for now and wait for an opportunity.” An elder from a small sect ordered his fellow members to make some distance.

He knew that they had no chance in an outright battle. They would be slaughtered in the blink of an eye. However, there might be a chance if they waited outside the battlefield.

The atmosphere became extremely tense as Li Qiye was surrounded with nowhere to go.

The combatants glared at Li Qiye while remaining vigilant of those around them. There were no friends here, only enemies.
