Chapter 4541: Everlasting Monarch

“Everlasting Monarch.” Wise Ancestor took a deep breath, shaken.

“That old monster? Can’t believe he is still around.” Jian Ming shuddered.

“Yes, it is rather unexpected. His everlasting dao isn’t enough, now he wants reincarnation or rebirth too.” The daoist added.

Those nearby heard this and became emotional. They then realized the reason why such a large crowd was forming in Yin Yang Crossing.

“True Immortal will not ignore this.” One expert murmured.

A junior who wasn’t familiar with this title asked her senior: “Who is this Everlasting Monarch? Why does everyone know him?”

It was obvious judging by everyone’s reaction that he was a renowned big shot.

“How should I explain this?” A senior smiled wryly and shook his head: “Let me put it this way, he is Blessed Dao Lord’s junior brother.”

“!!!” The juniors gasped in astonishment after hearing this.

Some believed that Blessed was the greatest dao lord in history. Of course, this was debatable, albeit highly supported. His achievements were virtually peerless. His power, fortune, and everything else were among the top three.

He represented true invincibility for many cultivators. Thus, his junior brother couldn’t be that far off.

“Everlasting Monarch isn’t just the dao lord’s junior brother. He is the longest-living existence from True Immortal, starting from the era of Blessed all the way to the final dao lord of True Immortal - Heaven Wheel.” The senior went on.

“How many generations is that…?” One junior took a deep breath.

“At least six or seven generations.” The senior calculated and said: “Putting aside the dark period of the arrogant woman, Everlasting Monarch was around for all of these othe generations.”

“That’s frightening.” The older cultivators shuddered despite having heard this title before.

This was a being whose fame and power are on the same level as a dao lord. Starting in the generation of Blessed, he lived through Worldraiser, All-things, Heaven Wheel…

Therefore, he wasn’t famous just because he was Blessed Dao Lord’s junior brother. Most importantly, he actually lived through those generations, unlike other ancient ancestors who buried themselves in hibernation.

This meant he had actually lived through seven generations, being far older than those ancient ancestors.

He stopped appearing after Heaven Wheel Dao Lord’s generation. That was when Emperor Ye appeared out of nowhere and defeated True Immortal, ending the Era of the Blessed.

Two popular theories attempted to explain this. The first stated that his lifespan ended after helping Heaven Wheel Dao Lord reach the apex by being his dao protector. The second said that Emperor Ye assaulted True Immortal and killed their big shots, Everlasting Monarch included.

Of course, these were mere speculations. There was no record or proof of a battle between Emperor Ye and Everlasting Monarch. The only thing for certain was that he stopped appearing after Emperor Ye’s generation.

All in all, these mysteries couldn’t be verified. Now, it turned out that he was buried in the Yang Cemetery. His resting place could have been the supreme ancestral cemetery of True Immortal yet he chose this place instead.

This monarch was a central figure behind every dao lord of True Immortal. He had either taught or protected them. In the end, this supreme being still passed away.

Perhaps he thought that he hasn’t lived enough and wanted to obtain rebirth via Yin Yang Crossing.

“Everlasting Monarch might have countless treasures with him, maybe even those belonging to Blessed Dao Lord once.” Someone murmured.

Jian Ming’s big ears heard this and his eyes turned bright with greed: “Shit, should we try to steal from this monarch?”

“True Immortal will be there too.” The daoist shook his head.

“They will be here, and many big shots too. They’re just waiting outside since it’s not the right time.” The speaker earlier smiled.

Jian Ming and the daoist were villains at heart. Their nose was as sensitive as a dog’s nose, so they could sense something else from these words.

They looked over at the youth and saw that the guy wore a simple black robe with a fit figure. It wasn’t overly muscular with bulging muscles. Nonetheless, he gave the impression that he was made of steel, not flesh.

He had an unforced smile, looking rather amicable and easygoing.

“Brother, where are you from?” Jian Ming thought that he could trick the guy and smiled. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

The youth didn’t seem to notice Jian Ming’s wretched smile. He immediately replied: “I’m from a very distant place. I and three more companions came to get to know the world. Here, let me introduce them.”

He didn’t come alone. His friends included two males and one female.

“We are known as the Improper Four, members of the same mind and heart. I am Puresword.” The youth smiled.

“Improper Four?” Jian Ming exchanged glances with the daoist, thinking that this title was terrible indeed.

“Not a very good title but your name doesn’t match at all. Puresword?” Jian Ming laughed.

“Hehe, don’t tease me, Brother.” Puresword didn’t mind.

“Call me A’han.” One of the four, a middle-aged man, spoke with a thunderous voice.
