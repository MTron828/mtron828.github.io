Chapter 5080: Crooked Thrust

This thrust seemed to have nothing to do with assassination since even a three-year-old could perform it.

It shouldn’t ever be muttered in the same breath as Conceal Conqueror’s Seven-step Death.

Ordinary cultivators and ancestors noticed nothing peculiar. Only those at the upper echelon such as Thousand-faced Sovereign reacted properly.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

First came astonishment, then they took a deep breath and still couldn’t calm down.

As for Conceal herself, she immediately entered a parry posture. She understood that the thrust itself didn’t matter, only the killing intent.

His was incomparably sharp and overwhelming - capable of piercing through time and the domains of the immortals…

“Clank!” She created three thousand worlds and a myriad dao with her sword while continuing to retreat.

This was enough to survive any attack from a conqueror but unfortunately, Li Qiye’s murderous intent didn’t care for any of this.

“Boom!” The branch pierced through her defensive lines and reached her.

Blood spilled to the ground; spectators’ jaw nearly dropped to the ground. A dried branch managing to injure Conceal Conqueror?

Even the top masters couldn’t speak at the moment because they felt a sharp pain in their throat. How could that simple thrust be so effective?

“Killing with the dao heart…” Conceal gasped before murmuring.

“Exceptional talent indeed, a great seed to be an assassin.” Li Qiye had to praise her.

The majority of the crowd only saw the simplicity of the thrust. Only Conceal noticed right away that the thrust represented his dao heart.

Of course, regular people didn’t know the mysteries and profundity behind using the dao heart offensively. Nonetheless, they understood that it was rather frightening.

Truth and Thousand-faced wondered about stopping that attack earlier. It seemed impossible because Li Qiye’s dao heart had reached an immeasurable state.

Conceal stared intensely at Li Qiye in order to find some clues. Alas, he didn’t look like a practitioner of the assassination dao.

“No need to look, I haven’t cultivated that dao.” Li Qiye shrugged and said: “I only wanted to show you what it can be since you have the talent for it.”

She had no time to be pleased by the compliment. If he didn’t cultivate this dao, how did he perform the dao-heart kill so easily? She herself wasn’t close to this level.

From her perspective, attacking with the dao heart was the highest level of the murderous dao. Everything originated from the dao heart.

“Still want to play? It’s rare to see a genius nowadays.” Li Qiye smiled.

The crowd exchanged glances in astonishment. He made it sound as if he was a teacher talking to his student, not a dangerous opponent.

Who in the lower continents was qualified to educate Conceal Conqueror? Li Qiye could be the only exception.

“Again.” She uttered coldly. Just her voice alone instilled an indelible fear into the listeners.

“She’s going all out.” Venerable Dragon God commented.

“I don’t think any of us has a chance against her, only Li Qiye.” Another ancestor murmured, feeling fully intimidated and unable to channel any power.

“Come.” Li QIye pointed his branch at her.

Just this alone prevented her from doing anything. She thought that any of her moves would be instantly nullified by his branch.

“Buzz.” Nonetheless, she didn’t relent and utilized something else.

A Buddhist light enveloped her - one that has been refined by countless tribulations and polishment. Her power and divinity infused themselves into this light.

An avatar with an identical appearance appeared behind her but had the glow of a sacred Buddha.

This was her golden avatar - something only available to the conquerors. It exuded bright halos pulsing outward and made everyone think that this was the culmination of her cultivation.

It was too much for the lower continents to take. Something this powerful shouldn’t exist here. The ground started sinking downward to everyone’s horror.

“Buddhist Sever!” Thousand-faced Sovereign shouted the name of the technique.
