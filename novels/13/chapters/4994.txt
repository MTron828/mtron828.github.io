Chapter 4995: The Peculiar Golden Cicada King

He didn’t appear luxurious or flashy despite his meticulous fashion choices. The careful arrangement made him look noble regardless of his bloodline or aura.

Every stitch and thread was done with the highest level of attention to detail. The main fabric was made from silk spun by blue-winged heavenly silkworms. The edges were made from strings refined by cold-river golden sand.

His boots came from the belly skin of an earthsplitter beast and were adorned with greenmountain copper ingots. This was an ancient style no longer seen recently.

The materials were famous and none of these items had been worn by big shots previously. They were all made specifically for him, making him look like an immortal traveling and enjoying the springs of the mortal world.

“Golden Cicada King.” Everyone bowed in his direction. This included Swordgrasp venerable and Jun Cuican.

“Is he a big shot?” Ming Shi asked after seeing Tendril King greet him.

“He’s one of the most famous from Demon and has friends everywhere, this includes your Untethered as well.” Yunyun said.

“Really?” Ming Shi hasn’t heard of this before.

“The Ten Great Mountains have many powerful cultivators, for example, the six commanding gods. However, we rarely mingle with the outside world. There are two exceptions, Wild Dragon and Golden Cicada King.” Goldcrest said.

“So why is he famous?” Ming Shi asked.

“He’s different from Wild Dragon in that he is righteous and follows the orthodox path.” Goldcrest said.

“I see, so he got friends everywhere.” Ming Shi could tell after seeing the aggressive dragon lords being cordial toward Golden Cicada.

He was a unique existence among the diverse demons found in this region. Some preferred to roam as wild beasts, always ready to devour any living being. Others lived in caves and acted similarly to dao hermits.

Either way, there was a clear difference between demons and cultivators from the outside world. The latter had more societal customs and cultures while even the strongest demons still had violent tendencies within them.

Golden Cicada King, on the other hand, imitated the way of the human cultivators. He learned the teachings of the dao lineages, hence his unique and noble temperament.

Afterward, he recruited disciples and proliferated his dao. His faction in Demon resembled that of a great kingdom.

Visiting his place would leave others in awe. They would think that they were somewhere else on the continent, not Demon. Though he couldn’t leave this place, he was still good friends with the upper echelons from the outside world. Halo Monarch who was furious still didn’t forget to greet him.

Putting human cultivators aside, the demon monarchs also respected him and always gave him face.

Even the fierce Chillglare Hawk nodded at him after their eyes met.

“He’s also very strong. Rumor has it that he is like a brother to a commanding god.” Goldcrest whispered.

“Wow, no wonder why even the hawk is playing nice.” Yunyun whispered back.

“You must be Fellow Daoist Li.” Golden Cicada didn’t forget Li Qiye and bowed slightly.

Li Qiye smiled in response.

“As the saying goes, it is better to make a friend than an enemy.” He said.

“Cicada King, I must have his head.” Halo Monarch uttered coldly.

“Let’s not be hotheaded, Monarch. I have prepared a feast back in my palace, let’s have a drink first then talk later. It won’t be too late then.” Golden Cicada suggested.

Halo Monarch thought about it and sure, his enemy wasn’t going anywhere. This fight could wait after the feast and his restraint would be showing enough respect to Golden Cicada.

After all, it wasn’t wise to offend demons such as Golden Cicada and Chillglare Hawk. This was especially true for Golden Cicada who was influential even in the outside world.

“No need, a feud should be dealt with as soon as possible.” Li Qiye disagreed and waved at Halo Monarch: “I have an even better offering for your son than my head, you. He won’t be lonely when you’re with him.”

This was akin to not giving Golden Cicada any face. This made Chillglare Hawk take another look at him. After all, few in the three continents would find this wise.

“Hahaha, don’t blame me for being merciless today since you’re suicidal.” Halo Monarch burst out in laughter. There was no need for him to hold back now.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Sigh, fighting and killing, when will it stop?” Golden Cicada sighed.
