Chapter 5808: Where Did Vine Go?

“Immortal Among The Firmaments!” Profound shouted and a hand descended from above.

This was a manifestation of the heavenly scriptures, seemingly coming from an immortal realm.

Spectators’ dao power became utterly suppressed and immobilized. They couldn’t activate a single strand of dao afterward, meaning that resistance was futile.

“Immortal? Not in this world.” Li Qiye chuckled in response before delivering an upward palm strike.

His primordial palm sent the descending one back into the air, crushing the nine firmaments. The shroud couldn’t protect Profound from the impact; his blood stained both his robe and the weapon.

It took a while before he could get back up. Alas, this only lasted a second before he dropped back to his knees. He needed to hold the shroud tightly with both hands to get up again.

Other emperors came and gave him their celestial rays, initiating the recovery process.

“I’ve lost, Sacred Teacher.” He no longer had the power to fight. The heart was willing, not the flesh.

This Ancestor empowered by a heavenly treasure couldn’t stand a chance against Li Qiye. The gap was still too wide.

“Anyone else?” Li Qiye asked, causing the crowd to retreat. Fighting him was obviously suicidal.

The only person standing in his way was Nether Emperor.

“You wish to fight?” Li Qiye smirked. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

Nether’s expression soured as he staggered backward. He had the Trinity Origination Disk given to him by Primal Ancestor, but the odds were heavily stacked against him.

He was closer to Sword and Hao Hai than Profound, and his disk was weaker than Jiao Heng’s mech. Alas, as the previous lord of Celestial Court, he couldn’t concede.

Each of Li Qiye’s steps caused him to take one step back toward Celestial Palace. No one else interfered because at this point, they could only place their hope on the founder and the three immortals.

“We have to ask the Ancestors for help.” One Grand Emperor murmured.

A peer responded: “Can they actually keep up?”

Some of them had joined for several reasons. First, Celestial Court looked prime to unite the world. The second reason was that the founder and the three immortals had found a way to break the limit, and they wished to learn.

“Damn, I never got to see them.” Someone else regretted the decision to join Celestial Court.

Of course, they benefitted from it such as having resources and gaining the blessing of Celestial Palace.

“I didn’t need to join.” A dao lord complained.

“World Emperor obtained a primal anima without joining.” A conqueror agreed.

“Not just World Emperor, Purewood Divine Emperor who went to Immortal Dao City, Inconcealable Ancient God, Immortal Monarch Yi Ye, and then the duck egg buyer’s group later, they all probably had primal anima.” An Immortal Monarch said.

“I agree about the duck egg buyer. He opened the path of the dao lord back in Eight Desolaces but damn, he left so fast for Immortal Dao City without leaving anything behind.” A dao lord angrily said.

“Speaking of leaving quickly, Vine left so fast too after making it possible for conquerors to appear. Who knows where he is now?” A heavener conqueror added.

The duck egg buyer was considered to be the pioneer for the dao lord path and Vine was rumored to have started the conqueror path.

The former left after participating in Skyspitter while Vine disappeared out of nowhere. All eyes fell upon Heaven Burial - the oldest conqueror.

Of course, Martial Conqueror was the first but his dao fruit was taken by Heaven Burial.

“How do I know?” Heaven Burial shrugged in response.
