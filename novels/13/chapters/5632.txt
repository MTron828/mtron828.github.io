Chapter 5633: Blood Worm Dragon


Li Qiye ignored the lightning bolts due to his primordial barrier. The unceasing barrages couldn’t touch him.

Lightning Realm was massive and seemed to be cursed as well. Strange phenomena occurred around intruders.

Hands made of a black liquid reached out of the bloody ocean beneath, wanting to grab ankles.

“Zzz…” They latched onto the victims like an evil entity, spreading from the feet to the head. This seemed to be an attempt to take over the body.

Of course, the black liquid couldn’t get through Li Qiye’s barrier. An explosion caused them to splash outward. Rays then shot out and reduced them to ashes.

This was just one of the many perils looming in the domain. Emperors and gods could die here, let alone regular cultivators.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

In reality, the top masters of Imperial Field had journeyed into Lightning Realm. They didn’t get far before backing off due to these ominous phenomena.

As Li Qiye delved deeper into the expanse, the lightning bolts became increasingly weaker and the waves disappeared.

Nonetheless, this calm area was creepier. Instead of water stained with blood, the ocean was filled with coagulated blood.

Li Qiye noticed a gigantic dragon half-submerged in this thick liquid. It didn’t resemble the regular mythical dragon with a golden aura but an earth dragon with rocky scales. They were weathered down by time, looking even coarser.

Its massive body prevented it from being fully submerged by the ocean. Its frame and draconic aura aside, the most frightening thing about the dragon was that is served as the source of the blood-stained lightning bolts.

The bolts looked like worms burrowing in and out between the dragon’s scales, seemingly wriggling down to absorb the blood from the ocean - a truly nauseating sight.

Li Qiye understood what was going on - the dragon had been subdued by the blood bolts. “Invincible” would be the word used to describe this creature by other cultivators in the mortal world.

Alas, once enough blood bolts entered its body, its willpower and strength were inadequate.

The parasitic bolts paralyzed the dragon while continuing to absorb more blood from the ocean. It wanted to fully take over the dragon, turning it into a puppet.

Li Qiye’s presence alarmed the dragon, causing it to open its eyes. They were just as red as the ocean below and unfortunately, also infected by the blood bolts. The latter squirmed around the eyes, looking like worms.

“Splash!” The dragon stood up and caused the water to surge in all directions. It was tall enough to push up the sky.

“Raa!” It roared at Li Qiye and activated its draconic aura, sending it straight at Li Qiye.

It became a combination attack - the destructive draconic aura together with a torrent of blood spewed by the dragon.

“Whoosh!” The torrent that came from inside its mouth was thicker than anything else.

The blood bolts still had the form of lightning while the torrent seemed to be made of countless blood worms.

The moment they surrounded Li Qiye and blotted out the sky, his primordial barrier erupted with rays piercing through them.

“Boom!” The dreadful blood worms were decimated in the blink of an eye.

The dragon saw the failed attack and opened its eyes wide. The blood bolts in there gathered and shot out a single beam carrying a curse.

“Zzz…” The cursed beam caused everything in its path to wither and decay. Li Qiye merely raised his hand to block it first before twisting it to nothingness.

“Raa!” The dragon opened its mouth wide, sucking everything inside.

The sky darkened as it was about to swallow Li Qiye whole. Alas, this mighty dragon became an insect in Li Qiye’s presence.

“Bang!” He easily suppressed it just by pressing his palm downward, pushing it down to the ocean, and causing monstrous waves.
