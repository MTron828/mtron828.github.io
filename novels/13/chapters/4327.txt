Chapter 4328: Opposition

“Who are you?” The young lord’s eyes turned cold and flashed intimidatingly. His aura came crashing down with the force of a tsunami.

It smashed Weiqiao with the force of a million pounds, intending on forcing him into submission.

Weiqiao trembled due to his weak cultivation. Alas, he was still someone chosen by Li Qiye so the pressure couldn’t take him down. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

His bones started creaking, on the verge of crumbling. Death seemed imminent. The only thing that remained calm was his heart and unwavering gaze.

He was not afraid at all despite waves of intense pain flowing through him. He stood proudly with his spine unbent, arching his chest to meet the aura directly. Getting down on his knees was unacceptable. His unshakable dao heart was the thing propping up his faltering body.

“Wang Weiqiao of Little Diamond Gate.” He enunciated properly in spite of the pain.

“Hmph.” The young lord uttered coldly: “State your intention.” His aura then intensified.

Weiqiao staggered backward as a result, feeling as if there were a thousand mountains pushing down on him. It nearly broke his spine and forced him to bend forward.

Such power was unbearable for someone of his shallow cultivation. He felt as if his internal organs and bones were being crushed.

Beads of sweat dripped down his forehead and moistened his robe. Nonetheless, the only thing on his mind was to stand proudly, never yielding regardless of the outcome. His face turned red then purple as a result.

Members of the small sects gasped, wondering if they could withstand this aura. The young lord alone could destroy their sect with a single hand wave.

However, everyone was utterly impressed with Weiqiao for not getting down on his knees. The guy was nothing more than an insect compared to the stronger cultivators in the crowd.

They thought that he would give up right away instead of lasting this long. Some even wanted to cheer for him for accomplishing something so extraordinary.

Alas, they didn’t dare to vocalize their support lest they offend the young lord.

“We can’t activate the divine altar.” Weiqiao uttered each word.

“This is not your place to speak, impudent fool. Kick him out!” Deer King roared, not wanting this nobody to ruin the atmosphere.

It also showed their inability to maintain the order of their own territory. This would ruin the young lord’s favorable impression of him or worse, he might even be considered responsible.

“Leave.” Gao Qixin stood up and ordered.

Weiqiao continued onward: “The conference allows everyone to participate, I am an invited participant, you can’t expel me.”

“Hmph!” The young lord’s expression soured. Everything was going according to plan until now.

Deer King and Gao Qixin could tell that he was annoyed. They had to do something soon.

“So you prefer the hard way instead!” Gao Qixin roared: “Babbling nonsense and disrupting order, kicking you out isn’t enough.”

Members of the small sect found him detestable. Not long ago, he wanted to befriend Li Qiye. Now, he climbed on the branch of the young lord, looking like a sycophant.

“The correct punishment is death.” Deer King said, wanting to finish this as fast as possible.

“Very well.” Gao Qixin became murderous and said: “Death is the punishment for your impudence.”

Having said that, he reached for Weiqiao.

The smaller sects didn’t try to stop this due to the risk of offending the young lord and Dragon.

The great powers didn’t do so either. Their experts thought that Weiqiao was only an insect. No need to make the young lord unhappy over such an insignificant being.

Qixin nearly reached the target but in this split second, ripples appeared in space. His hand was repelled and the force made him stagger backward.

This development caught everyone off guard. Who stopped Gao Qixin and went against the young lord?

“Who?!” Both Gao Qixin and Deer King couldn’t believe it.

"Why not let this fellow daoist speak?” A pleasant voice answered them. The one who saved Weiqiao was none other than Jian Qingzhu who was sitting on the top platform.
