"Ultimately, this third trial is very simple.” The one in charge of this trial was Zhang Yue. He said: “Just try to comprehend the dao bones. If they show any reaction, that’s ten points. If you can activate them, twenty points.”

“It’s limited to one? What if we can activate two bones or more?” One relatively talented genius said with confidence. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“If you can activate two, then outside of one merit law reward from the trial, you’ll get the merit law derived from the bone too or an equivalent one.” Zhang Yue said.

Many were moved with excitement, especially the ones who were here for the first time.

“I must activate two!” One gifted disciple excitedly said.

Any cultivator would want to have more merit laws, especially the higher-level ones.

However, Divine Black was strict with giving out merit laws. Ordinary disciples didn’t have access to the high-level ones.

Thus, getting a potential reward here would be extremely beneficial for many of them.

“You can smile proudly by activating one dao bone.” An older disciple splashed water over these ambitious ones: “Thinking about two? Very few among the third generation can do it.”

The excited disciples instantly froze; their spirited flame extinguished.

“What’s the reward for fully deriving a merit law out of them?” A voice suddenly sounded.

People looked back and saw that the speaker was none other than Li Qiye.

“A complete derivation? Do you think you have an inborn fate palace or something? Three mortal aptitudes wanting to derive a merit law, haha!” Many began laughing at him.

“Only a cultivator at the sacred level can do so.” An older disciple uttered coldly: “So in our entire sect, the sect master is the only one who can derive them. As for you? Stop dreaming.”

The animosity towards Li Qiye had only increased by this point. Thus, they all seized this opportunity to attack him.

“Hmph, just pick a suitable dao bone for you, that’s the wisest move instead of daydreaming.” Huang Ning coldly uttered.

“Not necessarily, what if the son of miracles can create another one? Maybe he’ll be able to derive merit laws from ten bones or something.” Another sarcastically added.

“Hmm, is there a time limit? After one or ten million years, maybe.” One more joined in.

Li Qiye ignored them. He smiled and rubbed his chin while staring at Zhang Yue: “Why not? What’s the reward for deriving ten bones?”

Zhang Yue carefully stared at him and felt a little afraid after seeing the smile: “The sect master and the others will decide, that is if you can do it.”

“Ten dao bones?” Zhan Hu said: “It would be amazing if you can activate one. As for derivation, that’s an unlikely miracle.”

“He won’t even get one! If he does, I’ll eat that entire bone.” One more showed his skepticism and snorted.

“Me too, if such a miracle occurs, I’ll even eat mud.” A demon laughed.

Unlike the skeptical crowd, Qianyue didn’t say anything and tilted her head in contemplation while looking at Li Qiye.

Their rude comments were reasonable due to Li Qiye’s current power. In fact, the sect master was the only one capable of this right now.

The elders and the kings would find this prohibitive as well. Only someone at the sacred level had this ability - creating a grand dao and deriving perfect merit laws. Also, the mythical geniuses.

Li Qiye had nothing of the sorts - neither talents nor cultivation.

“Nothing difficult about this.” He nonchalantly said.

“I see.” Zhan Hu found his attitude an eyesore. The guy always seemed to have everything under control and this was exasperating. He snorted: “Hmph, no need for ten, if you can do one, I don’t know how the sect will reward you but I will let you pick any of my treasures!”

“Your treasures are rubbish but that’s ok, I suppose I can be nice once.” Li Qiye smiled at him.

“And if you can’t do it? I’ll go easy on you, you just need to get on all four and bark like a dog.” Zhan Hu had an aggressive glare.

“That’s not a bad idea, I’ll bet one of my treasures too.” Many chimed in.

“Same with me, remember, if you can’t do it, you have to bark. Do you dare to accept the bet?!” It became rowdy all of a sudden.

Li Qiye’s enemies found a way to release their anger towards him. Just watching him humiliate himself was more than enough because they couldn’t do anything to him otherwise.

“I’m betting my best treasure, are you doing it or not?” They began taking out their treasures.

They simply didn’t believe that he could succeed in this task. No one in the sect could do so outside of the sect master, not even the peak lords and Gong Qianyue.

That’s why they were so confident in winning. If he were to bark like a dog in front of Qianyue, he would never be able to look at her again.

“Wow, so much trash.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile: “Fine, I’ll be generous this time. It’s on.”

“Hmph, we’re waiting for you to bark.” They snorted, ready to gloat on his misfortune. They could already imagine him barking like a dog at this point since his defeat was inevitable.

“No more wasting time, let’s start. Pick a suitable dao bone, everyone.” Zhang Yue and the elders didn’t interfere with the bet and even gave tacit approval.

The disciples became busy and searched for the right dao bone.

“I pick this one.” One disciple picked a dao bone that was on fire and said: “Low-level yellow, maybe I can activate it. Plus, fire affinity is perfect.”

“This one for me, low-level yellow too.” A different disciple picked another easy stone.

For some of them, it was better to play it safe by picking an equivalent bone to their current abilities. It should be easier to comprehend.

“This, high-level black.” On the other hand, the talented and powerful ones chose better dao bones because they were ambitious and desired a high-level merit law.

“Start.” Zhang Yue and the elders began making their rounds.

The ones that have chosen a bone sat in front of it and opened their fate palace.

“Buzz.” The four symbols appeared. The pillar of life stood vertically; its surface runes started to move.

They came together to form tiny dao tentacles that move towards the bone. These runes touched the bones and coiled around it for observation.
