Chapter 5851: Any More Help?

The unprecedented technique left everyone in awe. They had never seen this type of attack or this power before.

It didn’t come from the grand dao or bloodline but rather, the will of living beings whom cultivators looked down upon.

After all, it wasn’t difficult for an average cultivator to destroy a city or an emperor to end a kingdom. As for some overlords, devouring an epoch was part of the process. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

Therefore, no one thought that this was a potential path of research of cultivation. The grand dao was always the focus.

Li Qiye somehow mustered something unique that didn’t stem from his grand dao or cultivation. The result was potent - a blade capable of piercing overlords.

“Living beings or world’s judgment, whatever. As long as you’re dead, they will become nothing more than food.” Primal’s eyes gleamed murderously.

Spectators behind the mirror felt their spine becoming cold. They knew that if Li Qiye were to lose, they would become prime targets for meals. After all, big fish were always more desirable than the small ones in a pond.

They reflected on how they once thought they stood at the top of the world. Now, it seemed that they were still only food in the overlords’ eyes.

The founder of Celestial Court let out a sigh, recalling the previous devouring processes. Long ago during a time when the strongest weren’t known as emperors and cultivators, they lived under the leadership of the five overlords.

Their names and titles were forgotten. No traces of them remained in the world because they were the first to be devoured by their leaders. After eating them, the overlords still went on to devour half the epoch.

The founder understood the consequences of Li Qiye’s defeat. Top cultivators would be next; the classification of emperors, monarchs, dao lords, and conquerors would cease to exist. This history would be purposely erased.

Therefore, he watched Li Qiye with both nervousness and anticipation.

“Killing me is impossible for the likes of you.” Li Qiye smiled and said: “Death is inevitable but worry not for I am merciful. I will listen to your last words and give you enough time to commit suicide with dignity.”

The overlords’ expression became unsightly upon hearing this. They have reigned Trinity Epoch since the very start.

Although they rarely appeared after the last full-scale devouring, their imperious arrogance remained.

“Hahaha, you’re too funny, Dark Crow.” Derivation laughed in response: “Trinity Ancestor during his prime couldn’t dare to make this claim.”

“Who won the last exchange? It’s not the time to hide your ace cards, this is your last chance.” Li Qiye said.

They couldn’t refute because Li Qiye’s technique was unblockable. They still had no idea of his power ceiling.

“Feel free to call for more help too.” Li Qiye smirked.

The group exchanged glances.

“Should we?” They initiated a telepathic channel among themselves.

“Brother Dao?” All eyes were on Dao Ancestor.

He shook his head and said: “I can’t. Don’t you two still keep in contact?”

The spotlight fell on Primal. No one cared about Derivation, the unpredictable madman.

“In the past, yes, but not anymore.” Primal shook his head since they had cut off contact after ambushing Divine Ancestor.

Imperial Progenitor had a serious expression as he asked Stonesplitter: “Brother Stonesplitter, you have the best chance.”

“Hah, I don’t know about that. It’s been too long, not to mention the price.” Stonesplitter seemed hesitant.

“What price is too high when death is before us?” Primal complained.

“Then you do it, use your communication method. If I do it, I’ll become the weakest and the first to die.” Stonesplitter said.

He was already the weakest in combat out of the five. Making the exchange meant being the first to die - a truly foolish move.

Thus, everyone stared at Primal.

“Fine, I will try.” Primal gritted his teeth and made up his mind regarding the risky endeavor.

He formed a madura and blood flames appeared on his fingers. They pulsed brightly and entered space, searching for certain coordinates.

He wanted to summon helpers - the same as how Derivation summoned them.

“Poof!” The blood flames extinguished without any response.

“Nothing.” Primal shook his head in disappointment - the answer was clear.
