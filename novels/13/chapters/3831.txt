Chapter 3832: The Biandu

Some spectators naturally became annoyed at the unexpected interruption. The outsiders were particularly vexed because they had traveled so far to get to Black Wood. Moreover, no one weak would be able to make this journey.

Thus, these prideful cultivators didn’t want to acquiesce without a fight.

Nonetheless, the locals immediately saw the insignia on the soldiers and played nice.

“What is the Biandu doing?” One of them asked. [1]

The leader explained: “Our clan isn’t trying to be unreasonable here, it’s just that our young lord wishes to watch the tides for his dao session. In order to be absolutely safe, we have no choice but to do this. Please excuse us and we’ll make it up to you in the future, Fellow Daoists.”

“Your young lord is out of his isolated cultivation?” The locals were surprised.

The leader nodded: “Yes, he felt a resonance with Black Tides so he wants to observe the water.”

With that, many started leaving for two reasons. One, they were intimidated by the Biandu’s power. Second, they respected this young lord. Plus, this clan’s attitude wasn’t bad either.

Biandu was a prestigious clan in this region. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that they were at the top.

From Black Wood City to the shores, the scattered villages to the mountains and forests - these places were under the Biandu’s jurisdiction.

Thus, the locals were rather apprehensive when dealing with this clan. As for the outsiders, one guy was bold enough to protest: “I don’t see your name written on this platform, why are you kicking us out?”

The leader didn’t become angry but his tone became colder: “Once again, our clan apologizes for this offense. Our young lord wants to watch the tides for the greater good and here, we are also responsible for maintaining the peace. This is official business.”

He was stern enough to let the outsiders know that this decision was final.

“Let’s go.” The outsiders were annoyed but have heard about this clan before. This wasn’t their home court so it was best to avoid a direct confrontation.

The majority just complained and mumbled before leaving.

“The Biandu, hmm, the famous clan that has served the dao lords for generations?” Yang Ling was listening.

“Yes.” The old man nodded: “The one and only Biandu in the holy ground. They’re the lords of this region.”

“I see.” She murmured: “They’re quite prestigious then, being affiliated with the dao lords.”

Though Black Wood Cliff was far removed from the core of the holy ground, the Biandu was still quite famous. Yang Ling, who has never visited Black Wood, still heard of them before.

This clan was ancient, older than most clans and even Vajra Dynasty. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Rumor has it that their progenitor used to be a top general under Buddha Dao Lord. He had commendable services during battles across Eight Desolaces.

During the dao lord’s expedition against Black Tides, this progenitor also showed his worth. Afterward, he and his followers occupied Black Wood Cliff to watch over the black ocean. From then on, the Biandu Clan became the leader of the region.

“Serving the dao lords for generations is a bit much to describe the circumstances.” The old man smiled: “But yes, whenever the dao lords attacked Black Tides, the Biandu always served as the vanguard. They know Black Tides very well.”

Thus, due to their contribution, even Vajra had no jurisdiction over them despite being the current representative of Sacred Mountain. They could refuse any direct order from Vajra. Only Sacred Mountain in all of the holy ground could command them.

By this point, the experts from this clan made it to Li Qiye’s group. The leader cupped his fist and sternly said: “Ladies and gentlemen, please come back another day. Our young lord will be watching the tides for a dao session.”

Those who refused the polite request have been forcefully removed. The Biandu was strong enough to do so because of their rich history and roots in the land.

Yang Ling frowned slightly. She wasn’t afraid because Li Qiye was around. As long as he gave the command, she would oppose them too.

“Let’s go.” Li Qiye smiled and left. The group hurriedly followed him.

“Thank you for your cooperation.” The leader expressed his gratitude as the group was leaving.

“I heard that Senior Sister Wei Qianqing’s legion is right here. So who is actually in charge?” Yang Ling asked after they got far enough away.

“Vajra’s legion is only here to keep an eye out for Black Tides. It doesn’t interfere with Black Wood Cliff.” The old man said.

Yang Ling understood right away since she was familiar with the court and politics. Vajra might have troops here but the Biandu was still in charge of everything.

Of course, Vajra coveted this position for several reasons. Unfortunately, the Biandu was just too prestigious and had an unshakable foundation at Black Wood Cliff.

Most importantly, they focused on one mission - protecting the cliff. Thus, Vajra had no reason to oppose them.

The group headed for the main city after leaving the observation platform. Black Wood City wasn’t inferior to the great cities found in Buddha Emperor Plateau.

The walls reached the clouds; one could feel a wondrous militaristic aura from a distance.

Inside were countless pavilions and buildings along with large streets. The area was lively with a high population. At night time, the lamps brightly lit the street, creating a never-rest city. People and carriages packed the area.

Its prosperity seemed out of place since this was located at the border. A visitor would start wondering if they had gotten lost somehow.

One could see cultivators from all over the world too, even the rare barbarians from the east.

These men rarely showed themselves in Buddha Emperor Plateau but came here quite often. Some came for business, others wanted to broaden their horizon.

“I can’t believe how bustling it is.” Yang Ling was amazed after entering. She assumed that it would just be a small town by the border.

“Black Wood Cliff City spans for ten million miles, reaching the eastern kingdoms as well. The only problem here is Black Tides but it doesn’t come too often. That’s why the citizens enjoy peace and prosperity. Biandu has done a commendable job governing the city.” The old man explained.
