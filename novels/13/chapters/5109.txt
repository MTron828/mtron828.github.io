Chapter 5110: Can’t Win With Force, Negotiate Instead

On the other hand, the experts from The Race felt their heart sinking into the abyss. They thought that the four conquerors would propel them to the next height - unifying the lower continents.

Prior to this, they were hopeful of Conceal Conqueror as well but she was utterly crushed during the battle. The only thing they could do was pray for Li Qiye’s death.

The four conquerors’ expression changed dramatically. The opponent was far stronger than them.

They didn’t understand - how could the lower continents have such a powerful cultivator?

“Sir, where did you come from?” Vessel Conqueror asked. 

“From where I should.” Li Qiye smiled.

“The lower continents do not have such a powerful existence.” Ascension Conqueror shook his head.

“Even Eight-stallion with the immortal shield isn’t this strong.” Six-pot Conqueror said.

They had ample knowledge of the lower continents - the two strongest conquerors were Eight-stallion and Conceal.

If there was someone else notable, Heaven and Divine Alliance would have found out from Conceal. They knew that she was under a mission from Celestial Court, the only reason why she stuck around for so long.

“You are from Eight Desolaces.” Vessel concluded. [1]ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

Since the lower continents couldn’t possibly give birth to such a monster, he must be from Eight Desolaces.

This was not unprecedented in history - the duck egg buyer, Immortal Emperor Zhan, Blessed Dao Lord…

They didn’t expect to be in the presence of another right now. After all, Eight Desolaces’ natural resources and energy were nothing compared to the lower continents, let alone the upper realms.

“Correct.” Li Qiye admitted.

“Why do you stay here instead of ascending?” Six-pot found this strange.

In fact, those from Eight Desolaces didn’t need to follow the order of the continents. These top masters chose to arrive at the immortal continent instantly in order to fight Celestial Court.

Now, Li Qiye was clearly above the eight-dao-fruit level so he could have skipped the lower continents.

“What is your plan here? I see, that’s why you killed Conceal Conqueror.” Greenmountain said.

The others immediately understood right away.

“So you have it right now.” Vessel stared intensely at Li Qiye. Her delicate voice could pierce the heart.

Celestial Court has been looking for a particular item. The upper echelons believed that Eight-stallion Dao Lord was in possession of it.

Now, it seemed like they weren’t the only ones looking for it. Perhaps Immortal Dao City and Imperial Field were doing the same.

It was known that Eight-stallion Dao Lord represented Immortal Dao City. Li Qiye was obviously not a part of Celestial Court. Was he with Imperial Field?

Regardless of the circumstances, they knew that he had it right now.

“Talking about that drop of ancestral blood?” Li Qiye smiled.

They became emotional after hearing the confirmation. As for the listeners, this was their first time hearing of it. What was this ancestral blood?

“Do you know what it is for?” Ascension asked.

“Asking the wrong person, you should be asking Celestial Court this.” Li Qiye said.

The group exchanged glances and Vessel answered: “The ancestral bone.” [2]

Listeners knew about this particular legend. It started a war with massive casualties but the lower continents weren’t affected by it. 

The war started on the immortal continent and spread to the upper two continents. Their realm was spared from bloodshed until now. Some thought that this could get far worse for them.

“How could you possibly obtain the ancestral bone?” Li Qiye chuckled.

The group didn’t say anything since this was a rather serious topic. Even if they were to come across it, they would still need to share it with Celestial Court.

“Hand it over and everything will be forgiven.” Vessel suggested.

The crowd couldn’t believe it, especially those from The Race. Alas, they didn’t dare to interrupt the conversation.

“We mustn’t!” Greenmountain disagreed.

“No, this is fine. We will drop this matter and leave right away if you cooperate.” Six-pot agreed as well.

“Celestial Court will no longer pursue this matter.” Ascension nodded.

Three eight-fruit conquerors have given their word on this matter. Greenmountain kept quiet as well because in reality, Celestial Court would agree with this decision.

This frustrated half of the audience because Li Qiye had destroyed Heaven Burial. Its members wanted nothing more than vengeance on top of the conquerors’ help in rebuilding their homes. This was the case for the members of Deity as well. 

Remember, Six-pot and Vessel came from Immortal Pagoda and Swordgrasp yet they were still willing to drop this feud.

“I thought I’d made myself clear already.” Li Qiye shook his head: “I am not afraid of Celestial Court. In fact, I’ll be visiting soon to destroy it.”

He paused for a second and smirked at them: “But most importantly, you four are grossly misunderstanding the situation. You four are not qualified to negotiate with me and won’t be leaving this place alive today.”

The conquerors became alarmed; their eyes flashed with murderous intent instantly.
