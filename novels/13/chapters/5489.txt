Chapter 5490: Do I Deserve To Die, Sir?

“Thank you, Sir. You have the vision of an immortal.” She bowed gracefully and made people forget about the nauseating aura.

“You didn’t wait here only to praise me, right?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I wish to go on a walk with you, would that be alright?” She revealed a kingdom-toppling smile while her eyes flashed with a hopeful glimmer, making it difficult for anyone to refuse.

Her penetrating yet tender gaze could easily ensnare anyone. Accepting her request was the only possible outcome.

“Why not?” He smiled and started walking.

She followed him with elegant steps, keeping the perfect distance for the situation. She was accompanied by a comforting scent emanating from her body. Just one sniff and one would find life to be so beautiful - having the privilege of walking side by side with her.

“Sir, do I deserve to die?” She asked along the way.

“You tell me.” He stared at her in response.

She met his gaze with composure and ease, not putting on an act but her innate charm still oozed out. It rippled in her eyes like water, resonating with the heart.

“I don’t think I do. If we were to use emperors and conquerors as the standard, I would consider myself to be rather innocent.” She said.

He gazed in the distance and said: “Don’t dwell only on the present and past, think about the future as well.”

“So will I deserve to die in the future then?” She asked straightforwardly, ready for any answer.

“You are the only person who knows the answer.” He said.

“Sir, I don’t have any ambition nor do I demand perfection.” She tilted her head in rumination before answering.

“Good, some use ambition as an excuse before falling into the darkness, becoming the thing they hated the most.” Li Qiye smiled.

“That is why I’m more than content to move forward alone.” She said with determination.

“Do you know your origin?” He asked.

“I do, and I know the need to cleanse my impurities and address my flaws.” She said.

“Good.” Li Qiye nodded: “Having ample self-awareness is rare. But, due to your nature, everything can come easy to you. Many things are within reach.”

“Seduction is my intrinsic nature but I wish to sever and transform into my own self.” She said earnestly: “I do not deny that I possess, but that is no fault of my own.”

“That is true, you didn’t ask to be born with these physical characteristics, merely created in this manner.” He said.

“Thank you for understanding, Sir.” She bowed and appreciated his insight.

“However, you do have a gift that cannot be changed.” He continued.

“The marvel of procreation. I am aware, Sir.” She sighed and said.

Her disheartened sigh could instill deep sorrow into anyone. They would be willing to do anything to see her smile.

“That’s why it is not your fault, this was decided during your creation, the meaning of your existence.” He said.

“But that is not what I am.” She said begrudgingly.

“Yes, you are an unsuccessful product who is purposely limiting your seduction and having a different agenda.” He said.

“I only wish to be normal.” She agreed.

“What you are can’t be changed, but you can decide who you are.” He said: “You are a living, sentient creature who is free to pursue your goal, whatever it may be.”

“I wish to be free, hence my continuing attempt to transform.” She eventually answered after a brief pause.

“And this insistence only adds to your charm.” Li Qiye smiled: “Without this strive for perfection, you wouldn’t possess your current charm capable of driving others crazy. It’s a matter of Buddhism and mystical techniques. When you strive for Buddhism, you will naturally gain techniques despite your wish. So in your case, do not think twice about the seduction that is innate in your flesh and bones. Your charm will diminish as a result.”

“Sounds like a paradox.” She said.

“It is definitely counter-intuitive, but one version is potentially cataclysmic. The other might be fine.” Li Qiye said.

“Please elaborate on what I should do, Sir.” She bowed again.UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“Your path is self-perfection but your innate body determines your gifts and abilities. The stronger you become in order to shed it, the greater your charm.” He repeated.

“But what else can I do?” She furrowed her brows.

“In spite of the paradox, once you reach the ultimate state, you will revert to the origin and be able to hide the seduction.” He explained.

“Ultimate state as in the path of the emperors and conquerors?” She asked.

“It is different.” He said: “If you are able to return to your true self, you will be able to go even farther due to your innate advantages, a foundation not found in any other.”

“Listening to you, Sir, is more beneficial than a hundred thousand years of cultivation.” She expressed her gratitude.
