Chapter 4413: Engagement

The ex-sect master of Five-sun has officially asked for an engagement between his son and their saintess.

Jian Qingzhu became the center of attention right away. Though her status was inferior to Five-sun King, her future was awfully bright.

“This is a match made in heaven.” An outsider commented.

Someone from the east whispered: “You’re right but putting the two aside, it’s a great development for both Dragon and Five-sun.”

Many agreed. The alliance wasn’t looking bad at all because it would create a bridge between the east and the south.

As for Dragon, it has been wanting to replace Lion’s Roar. A marriage alliance here would make it seem as if Dragon was the representative of the south. Its new allies would boost its power and influence.

None could come up with an argument to oppose this alliance.

“The combination of two divine bloodlines should be enough to guarantee Five-sun’s future in the east.” One expert said.

Currently, Five-sun King was doing an amazing job. Many ancient clans have decided to support him so Five-sun was on the way to being the leader of the continent.

Alas, regardless of its meteoric rise, its starting point was far inferior compared to the ancient lineages. Thus, an offspring between these two would become an ace card. This nobler bloodline would pave a stronger foundation for the sect.

“I can’t fathom how incredible the child will be.” Some started speculating on the form and power of the combined bloodline.

Thus, eyes shifted between Qingzhu and Peacock Monarch, wondering about the decision. For Dragon’s sake, it would be foolish to refuse because the marriage was absolutely advantageous.

“Didn’t someone say that there is already a candidate for the queen position?” One cultivator asked.

“Yes, but given Five-sun King’s status, it’s fine for him to have more than one wife.” An eastern cultivator said.

“The saintess is the jewel of Dragon, how can she be a concubine?” One Dragon disciple didn’t appreciate this.

Sure, the marriage alliance carried numerous benefits. However, Qingzhu was Dragon’s saintess and had an impeccable background.

They naturally didn't want her to be a concubine. That queen position should be hers.

Peacock Monarch coughed once and said: “I appreciate your enthusiasm, Sect Master. We feel honored as well.”

He didn’t refuse and answered cordially.

“So it is decided, Sect Master?” The ex-sect master pushed the issue, wanting to confirm it right now.

“The pair is undoubtedly a good match but we do need to deliberate and also ask our saintess for her opinion.” Peacock smiled.

The crowd opinion thought that Dragon should just agree. Numerous princesses and saintesses wanted to marry a talented cultivator like Five-sun King.

Now, his father was here asking himself. Nothing could be better.

“An excellent match indeed. This is fine.” An ancient voice sounded.

The crowd noticed an emaciated treant sitting nearby since who knows when? His eyes had a frightening murderous intent, seemingly capable of draining people dry.

“The ancient ancestor from Dragon Platform.” An audience member revealed.

“Ancient Ancestor.” The members of Dragon kneeled.

“Ancient Treant, he’s here too?” Outsiders found this surprising.

“So the engagement is decided?” Another whispered.

One of the three ancient demons had spoken about this matter. It seemed rather inevitable at this point.

“Thank you for your approval, Senior. This is great news for our sect.” The ex-sect master became ecstatic since he cared about Qingzhu’s bloodline, not just Dragon’s power.

Who would dare to go against an ancient ancestor?

“Very well, I also agree, Ancient Ancestor.” Peacock Monarch nodded happily.

On one hand, it might be better for Dragon to keep her in the sect due to her bloodline. But for him and Dragon Platform, it was best to send her away.

He was young and could rule for two or three eras. However, if Qingzhu were to stick around, she might challenge his status eventually due to her bloodline and potential. Therefore, marrying her off to Five-sun School was killing two birds with one stone.

“I refuse.” A confident voice interrupted them.

The happy atmosphere suddenly became frozen and intense. The opposer was none other than Jian Qingzhu herself.

Normally, this type of engagement wasn’t rare. Even saintesses and princesses needed to contribute to the sect when necessary. A marriage alliance was one way to do so.
