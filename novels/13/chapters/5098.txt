Chapter 5099: What The Hell Is This Thing?

Li Qiye let out a sigh while turning his focus back on the box. He spread his fingers and created a supreme dao law.

It seemed rather special while wiggling around as if it was alive. If people were here to look at it, each individual would see something different. Li Qiye was the only one who could see its real form.

“Young Noble, why do you have our badge of authority? When did you get it?” She became startled because the badge should be in Primal.

“Look again.” He smiled and touched her forehead.

It lit up and her eyes became as clear as can be. Things she normally wouldn’t catch became obvious; she could see the minute changes in the world as well.

Now, he was clearly holding a dao law, not a badge.

“Buzz.” He pulled back and her eyes became normal, no longer possessing a supreme heavenly gaze.

The law became the badge again in her eyes.

“Why is this happening?” She wondered.

“What you’re looking at is your wish, that’s why you cannot see its true form unless your mind is clear and without any desire." Li Qiye said.

She wondered who could actually do this. Not even the conquerors had the ability to do so.

Li Qiye smiled and released the dao law. It swam forward like a spirit snake and coiled around the box.

“Buzz.” The ancient seal appeared on the box. Only a selected few that have been exposed to heavenly scriptures could recognize the seal.Th.ê most uptodat𝓮 n𝒐vels are published on n(0)velbj)n(.)co/m

It indeed originated from a heavenly scripture. Li Qiye’s dao law was a perfect match and entered the seal like a key inserted into the hole or a snake entering its cave.

A bright phenomenon occurred. Yunyun saw a majestic land - her home known as Primal.

In reality, this was the same as before - everyone saw something different.

“Click.” The seal was unlocked to her astonishment.

Her lineage had tried for eras to no avail. This included Eternal Conqueror who utilized numerous laws and dao. Alas, Li Qiye did it in just a few seconds.

“What is it?” She inched closer, wanting to see the content. After all, the box has been passed down all this time but no one had a clue.

She was the first member lucky enough to be here right now and became rather nervous.

Li Qiye opened the box and the content pulsed with a dark light. Yunyun finally got to take a look and didn’t expect this at all.

Previously, she had imagined the potential answers - a supreme treasure? Something of the immortal level? A heavenly scripture?

“A skull? This is our heirloom?” She stood there in a daze.

It seemed to be infected by something and was as black as ink from top to bottom, nearly being fused by endless darkness.

One wouldn’t even notice the skull amidst the darkness. The question was - did the darkness envelop the skull or was the skull the thing devouring all light?

At the very least, she could tell that this wasn’t a human skull. The shape was rather strange and gave a creepy feeling. Suddenly, she felt something deep in her heart being affected.

No ancestors and disciples would believe her about this issue - their heirloom being a creepy skull.

“Buzz.” A bloody ray erupted from Li Qiye’s forehead. Something seemed eager to break out.

This was none other than the drop of blood given to him by Eight-stallion Dao Lord.

The skull released dark rays after seeing this, especially from the eye sockets. The rays were capable of refining any affinity.

“What the hell is this?!” She became startled.

“Seal!” Li Qiye shouted and suppressed the skull with a single finger.

The drop of blood and the skull immediately halted, not daring to try again.

Yunyun heaved a sigh of relief because that sudden eruption scared the hell out of her.
