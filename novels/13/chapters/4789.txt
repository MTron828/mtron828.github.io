Chapter 4790: My Dao

Cultivators trembled in fear while looking at the ocean of lightning bolts gathering in the sky vault.

Everyone could tell that this wasn’t a part of Li Qiye’s technique.

“The power of the high heaven…” Ancient ancestors, monarchs, and eternal existences shuddered.

This power was beyond their reach. The only time it manifested was during the tribulation of a mighty cultivator, and they all knew how deadly it was.

A being could have dominated for an era just to be killed during a cultivation tribulation. As far as they knew, this was only a strand of intent from the high heaven. A full punishment would be on the next level, something beyond the endurance of epoch overlords.

Due to this helplessness, the overlords had no choice but to hide in their secretive abode for epochs to come.

Those who were interested in this battle immediately returned to their concealment. Some of them have been punished by the tribulation before. Being exposed again might spell demise.

“Just initiating this punch is heralding a heavenly tribulation.” One spectator said with trepidation.

How could the act of making a fist have this effect on the high heaven? They have never heard of such a thing before since tribulations only came during a realm breakthrough. For example, the making of a dao lord. Rumor has it that it didn’t happen every time either. Only a few dao lords had to face this test.

“How could it not be angry? This is the heaven-sealing punch.” A hidden existence whispered.

The heaven showed its wrath due to Li Qiye’s impudence even though the punch wasn’t directed at it.

“This is it!” Tian Tu’s eyes flashed brightly and fiery. He became engulfed in flames as he gathered energy.

“Boom!” His fist energy erupted, flattening the mountains and making oceans evaporate.

Spectators were forced to the ground despite having kept a safe distance from the battle. 

“So strong.” Six-dao Monarch trembled and had to muster all of his power to stand still.

“It is something else.” Dao Sanqian praised and couldn’t come up with another cultivator capable of stopping this with the exception of Li Qiye.

“Truth Variation, My Dao!” Tian Tu attacked, releasing a rain of golden radiance.

All of Li Qiye’s grand dao suddenly relaxed so he became full of openings.

“Boom!” His fate palaces and true fate also appeared on the path of the punch.

It was common knowledge that the grand dao, fate palaces, and true fate could only be summoned by their owner. Forcefully opening it required the enemy to be a hundred time stronger. The owner would also die in the process.Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

It seemed that this punch bypassed that and targeted the defenseless true fate. Direct contact would mean death.

“Boom!” It struck Li Qiye’s true fate at its weakest point.

The punch itself had a cataclysmic power with perfect speed and power. Moreover, the true fate wasn’t protected by the fate palaces right now.

Spectators felt a sharp pain as if their own true fate was being hit and bellowed in horror - this was the calling of death.

Therefore, it made them question Li Qiye’s well-being once more despite his unbeatable status.

“How can anyone survive this?” Many shared this thought. No true fate, regardless of how powerful it is, could withstand this direct attack.

“It’s impossible to stop this punch.” Dao Sanqian was astounded.

This move was specifically crafted to defeat someone far stronger. Surviving might be possible due to the power gap but the price would be heavy.

My Dao was the apogee of Tian Tu’s lifelong obsession with the fist dao. He never used it before since there was no need.

“You deserve to witness my attack.” As the punch struck the true fate, Li Qiye’s voice echoed in everyone’s ears.

“Boom!” The retaliation came with a punch with a sealing affinity capable of destroying the greatest gods, devils, and immortals.

In fact, even the high heaven would shudder before this technique. Supreme overlords became as meaningless as specks of dust.

Dao SAnqian, Six-dao Monarch, and Specter Monarch instantly felt their power being taken away by the punch.

“The greatest punch in existence!” Six-dao blurted.

The fist dao was also his primary focus. Alas, he felt like a horrified mayfly trying to weather a storm. Everyone else shared the same sentiment.
