Chapter 5172: All Because Of Vengeance

“I do not agree with your view, Sir.” The old man eventually said.

“I need neither your endorsement nor opposition.” Li Qiye smiled.

The old man wasn’t used to being spoken to in this manner. He swallowed his words and became slightly annoyed.

He took a deep breath and said: “Let us not dwell on the grand dao or ambition. Sir, you have an ancestral item that Celestial Court must have. Once they know, they will send their full forces against you.”

“So what? I’ll be seeking them out anyway.” Li Qiye yawned.

Li Qiye’s indifferent attitude made it difficult for the old man. He patiently said: “Sir, do you know about its other use?”

“What is it?” Li Qiye asked.

“It can trace a bloodline back to the source.” He became serious.

“What does that have to do with me?” Li Qiye said.

“Sir, you probably heard about the three races sharing the same origin.” He said.

“Yes, and then?” Li Qiye nodded.

He ignored Li Qiye’s arrogant attitude and continued: “There is a method to…”

“You want to destroy them.” Li Qiye interrupted with a cold tone.

He shuddered and hesitated for a moment before replying: “Yes, it will bring peace for eras to come, no more trouble.”

“Wow, so ambitious, destroying The Race for the sake of peace.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“War and chaos start from their side.” His eyes flashed with murderous intent, albeit only for a split second. Nonetheless, it was enough to cause a global-scale bloodbath if he wished for it.

“Have you started a sect before?” Li Qiye asked.

“Yes.” He didn’t know where this was going.

“Let’s assume a world without The Race. Would your descendants and sect members live in harmony forever? No, they will also start conflicts among themselves.” Li Qiye said.

“That’s just competition.” He responded.

“The main point is the intent.” Li Qiye said: “Do you think of your goal as being noble, that you’re carrying out justice? Did you become a cultivator for this?”

Li Qiye got up and stretched: “Massacres are common, cultivators at the apex have all done so before, but let’s not twist it now. Don’t pretend to be a savior for your own personal gain, you are treading a thin line. Once you cross over it, you’ll fall.”

“My heart and goal are unchanging.” He said firmly.

“I can see that you are hellbent on vengeance. Call it what it is, it is not justice that you are trying to obtain.” Li Qiye glared at him once before descending again.

He stared in the direction of Li Qiye; his eyes pulsed brightly continuously. He clenched his fists but after a long while, he slowly unclenched.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

‘Not an idiot after all, otherwise, this place would be your grave.’ Li Qiye’s voice echoed in his mind.

He took a deep breath after hearing this and stood there, pondering. Eventually, he picked up the bundle of firewood and left.

“Boom!” A massive attack left a huge palm print on the ground.

The crown prince of Iron Tree was sent flying. His armor plates were broken from the attack.

As for his men, they were now corpses scattering all over the ground.

“Raa!” A colossal bear roared in a frenzy.

This was none other than True Bear Conqueror. His appearance had changed completely with bones protruding out of the flesh. His fangs were longer as well, looking like blades.

He tried his best to control his rage but this was to no avail. It turned out that because of his desire for revenge made him recklessly break through.

His two dao fruits were unstable and could collapse at any second. Nonetheless, he still joined the battle.

Although he got his wish, the injuries worsened his dao, hence his swift exit away from Windchaser Hall.

His destination was Immortal’s Peak, hoping to find a king medicine capable of suppressing his violent thoughts. Alas, he couldn’t find any and his mind became increasingly unstable.

“Raa!” He grabbed numerous plants and pills and hurriedly ate them.

“Run!” Saintess Shao Yao shouted at the crown prince, wanting to run.

She stuck around because she came across a precious plant. However, True Bear Conqueror appeared out of nowhere.

Of course, they didn’t know that this wild bear was actually a conqueror. He grabbed the plant and ate it right away.

The crown prince and his men surrounded the conqueror, wanting to earn points with the saintess.

Alas, they were no match for the conqueror despite his best attempt to not kill them. Just one smash ended up killing virtually everyone.

As the saintess turned to run, she saw an incoming smash from the conqueror.

“Ahh!” She screamed after seeing this, believing that this was her last moment.

However, this didn’t happen so she opened her eyes and saw someone blocking it

Who else could it be but Li Qiye?

He stared at the conqueror and sighed: “Impatient and reckless only to suffer backlash. Your cultivation is finished, you are now a wild beast.”

He shook his head disapprovingly before raising one hand and creating a dao needle. He sent it through the bear’s forehead without any difficulty.

True Bear seemed to be struck by lightning afterward. He trembled and lightning crackles could be seen everywhere. On the other hand, his madness was being subdued. The bony overgrowths slowly shrank back into the body. His gigantic frame was reduced to that of a regular bear.
