Chapter 4715: Challenge

Shen Juntian put virtually everyone else in the same generation to shame. All of his statuses commanded attention and respect.

Many girls screamed after seeing him. Though the majority thought that he was no match for Li Qiye, this didn’t diminish his popularity.

He seemed to be the heaven’s favorite and had unique advantages unavailable to others. Their lifelong achievements were only comparable to his starting point - an unfair disparity.

A hush fell over the scene. Both were the apex existences of the young generation, standing at the top of the dao path. A battle between them would be epic indeed.

“You want the immortal gemstone as well?” Li Qiye smiled and asked.

Shen Juntian smiled before answering, causing men to admire him while women became enamored with him with hearts in their eyes.

“The immortal gemstone is one and only but it is yours now and I have no intention of taking it.” His voice was pleasant and charming - a perfect match for his immaculate appearance.

“Interesting.” The older experts said. They came running after seeing the immortal beam since no one could resist the temptation.

If Shen Juntian was telling the truth, then he had far more self-control than they did.

“He has never put his father’s name to shame.” An ancestor said.

“He’s wonderful both inside and out, a real man.” One girl found her love for him rising.

“Then why are you here?” Li Qiye asked.

Juntian sincerely responded: “Dao Brother, your dao has reached an incredible height, far ahead of all the competitors including myself. You are the most likely to become the next dao lord.”

His humility earned him more points with the crowd. To have such self-awareness and humility was rare for someone of his background and success.

“And?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Despite being outmatched, I wish to fight you and am ready to die for it.” Juntian said earnestly and stirred the crowd.

“Don’t!” One girl shouted, wanting to stop him.

The word “die” made them feel something ominous. None wanted to see him fall in battle but were powerless to stop it.

“This is the definition of being suicidal.” Li Qiye said.

“The dao path is full of perils, especially when one wants to become the dao lord. You are the number one rival right now and I can’t yield without fighting. If I miss the chance today, I may not be able to fight you again since you might have taken the next step. I would regret this for the rest of my life.” Juntian responded.

“Good, not giving up in the face of danger, a dao lord’s son indeed.” Li Qiye clapped and seemed amused.

“You’re too kind.” Juntian said.

The older crowd members thought that this was an impressive mentality while the girls wanted to fight in his place. They believed that he was the most perfect man in the world; some even fell to tears.

“Please give me pointers, let my outcome be up to fate.” Juntian said.

“As you wish then.” Li Qiye smiled: “Come, show me what you can do.”

“I am only a beginning with a bit of comprehension in the dao. Allow me to show you my dao.” Juntian said.

“So be it. Start.” Li Qiye smiled.

Shen Juntian laughed after getting what he came for. Meanwhile, the crowd watched with bated breath.

“Does he have a chance to overcome Li Qiye?” Someone whispered.

“His chance of winning is minuscule even if he’s the strongest among the five.” One ancestor responded. The big shots in the crowd felt the same way.

“Judging by what we saw in his fight with Tian Feng, he won without using all of his strength. Juntian can’t be much stronger, even if he’s one level above Tian Feng, he’ll still lose.” Another ancestor said.

The battle with Tian Feng shocked all spectators - defeating the physical innate gift with his bare hands. This should have been impossible.

“Who knows, his dao lord bloodline is thick and blesses him.” A golden daughter said.

“His regality can be considered an innate gift.” A lord replied: “It’s akin to having a dao lord possess his body. It should be terrifying to see.”

“There’s still a difference between empowerment and a dao lord being here in person. I wonder how close he’ll get to his father’s true power.” A big shot said: “If it’s fifty to sixty percent, that’s enough to beat anyone including Li Qiye. Twenty to thirty percent? I don’t think so.”

It seemed that Juntian had more fans in the crowd hoping for his victory than Li Qiye.Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com
