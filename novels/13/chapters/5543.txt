Chapter 5544: I Want To Be An Immortal

“Young Noble, Senior, thank you and I will not forget your warning.” She heeded their warnings and took a deep breath, bowing her head in response.

She was merely sentimental about her diminishing feelings toward her own clan. The excitement and anticipation were no longer there.

After a hundred thousand years, this place would mean nothing to her - only that she was once born here. If she were fortunate enough to stand at the apex, she would become isolated from the mortal realm, severing all ties.

This process had both positive and negative aspects. The good allowed her to walk further, not stopping for anything. The negative was that her heart would grow cold and emotionless.

This happened to countless emperors and monarchs along with the legendary overlords. Due to their lifespan, even their sects and cultivator descendants became meaningless, let alone mortals.

A million years was only a short time for the overlords while the world would undergo drastic changes. Sects and kingdoms rose and fell within that period.

Once their last loved ones succumbed to old age, they would no longer have any connection to the world. When their dao heart became unstable, they would fall into the darkness and devour everything else including their homeland.

Qin Baifeng’s journey had only started. As she became stronger, she would lose connection to the Qin and Sunset Glow Valley. Eventually, this applied to the entire continent and more…

“Young Master, how did you keep moving forward?” Niu Fen couldn’t help but ask while on this topic.

This particular matter reminded him of his past, starting from the nine worlds to Eight Desolaces and finally, the immortal continent. He had experienced numerous goodbyes - a test for his dao heart each time.

Today, he had the qualification to ask about the future.

“It’s a personal adventure. To put it bluntly, one might be a dog but that’s not a reason to eat shit.” Li Qiye said.

“How vulgar.” Niu Fen didn’t know whether to laugh or cry while Baifeng turned slightly red.

The cloud, on the other hand, looked as if it was stroking its chin in ponderance.

As the group walked deeper into the clan, they saw beautiful decorations. The clan members immediately prostrated upon seeing them.

“Immortal Aunt.” One child said respectfully.

“Immortals.” Many prostrated and said.

“I kinda like the mortal world, this atmosphere.” Niu Fen enjoyed the moment.

“It’s not like you haven’t been worshipped before.” Li Qiye smiled.

“It’s different. If a cultivator kneels before me, the guy definitely has ulterior motives, wanting a merit law or a gift. If a dao lord or conqueror bows to me, they want to talk about my cultivation experience or want to team up to kill someone for a treasure, just an example.” Niu Fen laughed and said: “Mortals, on the other hand, worship earnestly without anything else in mind since they view us as immortals.”

“Makes sense. Then why don’t you stay here like the other emperors?” Li Qiye said.

“No way.” Niu Fen shook his head: “That’s really boring, the same as putting on shackles and being stuck here forever.”

“That’s why they’re amazing. They know all of this yet are still willing to stay as protectors.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Not for me, I prefer being a dao lord. These gods are almost slaves.” Niu Fen shook his head.

Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t dwell on this matter. There was nothing wrong with Niu Fen’s hesitation.

Powerful cultivators roamed the world untethered. Everything was within grasp and they could do whatever they wanted - at least in the eyes of the mortals.

Nonetheless, Space Dragon Emperor and the others willingly sacrificed their freedom for a noble goal.

The clan master visited the group to pay respect - a middle-aged man versed in martial arts and a hint of cultivation. He could be considered an expert in the mortal world. Baifeng had abdicated her position previously since it didn’t matter to her.

“Aunt Baifeng.” In terms of seniority, he was considered her nephew: “We had a poor harvest this year, the yield is half of last year.”

Although he had done a commendable job at managing the clan, he still showed respect by reporting this to his immortal aunt. It was rare for her to come back and she was the reason for their prosperity.

“A weak harvest is a common occurrence, next year will be better.” She casually remarked, not having an interest in such a trivial matter.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Aunt Baifeng, something else is going on here, I’ve been wanting to report this to you.” He said.

“What is it?” She asked.

“The Deity of Harvest ensures a smooth cultivation and bountiful harvest so that everyone can have enough to eat.” He said.

“Right.” Baifeng agreed that this deity rewarded his worshippers in terms of weather and harvest.

“This has not been the case in the past two years, crops often wither and the harvest is increasingly poor. I’m afraid life would have been hard without our surplus storage.” He explained.

Baifeng frowned after hearing this and said: “Could it be that your offerings and prayers are without sincerity?”

“Aunt Baifeng, we did the same every year, always with respect and sincerity. I just get the feeling that the blessings of the deity have not been as widespread.” He explained.

“Impossible.” Niu Fen shook his head: “I can sense that the old geezers are still protecting Momentous Frontier.”

“How is the deity’s temple?” Baifeng asked.

“We offer daily and monthly ceremonies at the temple, always with the most devoted descendants. Nonetheless, I think there is some fading going on at the temple, not to mention another serious matter.” He answered.

“What is it?” She asked with a serious tone.

He hesitated, unable to find the words.

“Speak.” Her voice became stern enough to intimidate anyone.

The clan master naturally couldn’t handle the pressure emanating from a dragon lord.
