Chapter 1193: Zhuo Jianshi

In the end, Zhuo Jianshi was still someone who had experienced countless waves. She took a deep breath and answered with an elegant smile on her face: “I do not deny your claim. Many lineages in the Heaven Spirit World desire an imperial bloodline like yours. It has always been a custom for sects to pay attention to these bloodlines. The sect masters all have a responsibility to find excellent bloodlines for their sects.”

“You are very eloquent.” Li Qiye smiled and asked: “The old geezer from Void Imperfection wants me to stay and now you do as well. Aren’t your three schools afraid of an inner conflict?”

She smiled, her mature and noble appearance made people palpitate from excitement: “Young Noble, you are misunderstanding something. Our three schools are one and the same. The Void Imperfection Schoolmaster wants to keep you behind, as do we. This is only giving Young Noble more choices, it is not a competition.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Li Qiye chuckled with his eyes closed: “If you have talked with the old geezer, you should know that I am not interested in this matter.”

“We want you to stay, but this doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to become our groom. You can just stay at our schools for a while if you like.” Her demeanor was calm and gentle: “Maybe we should approach this differently. In my eyes, your inner physique is quite powerful, so our schools are the best choice for you. We will have a suitable physique law for you to choose.”

Zhuo Jianshi was not just boasting. In the Heaven Spirit World or even all of the nine worlds, no other lineage had as many physique laws as the three schools since they had three different Immortal Physiques.

“Physique laws?” Li Qiye opened his eyes to look at her and smiled: “You have good eyesight, but as for physique laws...”

He burst out into laughter at this point.

She didn’t become angry for elegance exuded from her core. She spoke softly: “May I ask for the reason behind your laughter?”

Of course, she wasn’t aware that no one had more physique laws than Li Qiye in this world. He simply had them all.

“Nothing.” Li Qiye replied with a grin: “Your three schools have many physique laws. Not to mention the others, just the three Immortal Physique laws alone are truly precious. The Void Imperfection Windchase Law, the Evil Devourer Graceful Law, and the Surging Golden Spring Law... these three laws can be considered peerless in this world...”

With a brief pause, he continued: “Outside of the physique laws created by Immortal Emperors, your three laws are quite rare. This is especially true for the Void Imperfection Windchase Law; it is infinitely close to perfection. This level of physique law is very rare. For example, the physique law from the Soaring Immortal Sect of Immortal Emperor Fei could be considered another.”

It was truly difficult to receive such high praise from Li Qiye. After all, he had the Physique Scripture that contained all the perfect and profound laws in existence.

In fact, for cultivators, creating a physique law was even more difficult than creating an emperor law. This was one of the reasons why grand completion Immortal Physique users could assail Immortal Emperors.

The scale of difficulty soared when it came to Immortal Physique laws. There were quite a few wonderful masters who were able to create these laws, but they had defects and were incomplete. There weren’t that many at a level that could be considered complete, let alone perfect.

The physique laws of the three schools were considered complete. Of course, there was still a large way to go before true perfection.

“It is thanks to our predecessors’ achievements, we descendants have not been able to do anything so we need to work even harder.” She answered in a demure manner without pride.

Li Qiye looked at her and smiled: “Your eyesight is not bad since it can see that my inner physique is powerful. The temptation of physique laws might work for everyone else in this world, but it is nothing to me.”

For cultivators with powerful inner physiques, to be able to cultivate an Immortal Physique would be their greatest pursuit in life. They would find it impossible to refuse such a temptation.

However, he promptly added: “However, your Void Imperfection Three Schools does have something that tempts me.”

“What might that be?” She became curious as well. Since Li Qiye wasn’t interested in Immortal Physique laws, was there anything else in this world that was even more precious to pique his interest?

He emphatically replied: “Your Immortal Emperor Wu Gou’s creation, the Windchase Break!”

Despite her normal calm demeanor, his answer shocked her: “The Windchase Break! One of the Immortal Physique Strikes!”

Immortal Physique Strikes were mysterious techniques that very few people had seen.

Legend states that only grand completion Immortal Physique emperors were able to create these attacks. Without reaching grand completion, even an Immortal Emperor wouldn’t be able to do so. Conversely, grand completion users wouldn’t be able to create them without having the Heaven’s Will.

Because of these strict requirements, these attacks were extremely rare. Furthermore, future generations speculated that there was an additional requirement, that the emperor’s physique law must be self-made. Only those who had created their own physique laws to become an emperor with a grand completion Immortal Physique would be able to develop these attacks.

There were many stories about these attacks themselves. Some said that they were more powerful than Heaven’s Will Secret Laws. However, the opposition stated that these attacks couldn’t oppose a secret law if its user had the Heaven’s Will.

Another group speculated that a grand completion user training in these attacks could definitely ambush an Immortal Emperor. They could even contend against the emperor’s secret law!

Alas, these were all guesses because there were too few Immortal Physique laws in this world and even fewer Immortal Physique Strikes. A grand completion user with these attacks was a hundred times rarer than an Immortal Emperor!

As such, no one was able to witness such a duel, especially those from the younger generations.

Zhuo Jianshi was trembling after hearing this. After all, the Windchase Strike was once the most powerful and frightening technique from her three schools. A Void Imperfection user with the Windchase Strike held unimaginable power!

“However, you lot have lost the Windchase Strike!” Li Qiye insipidly stated: “This is very regrettable and is also the reason why the Void Imperfection Three Schools lost some of its deterring influence.”

Zhuo Jianshi pondered in silence for a moment. Across the generations, this had been a truly regrettable matter for their school. In fact, they had tried to look for it all this time to no avail...

She eventually calmed down and took a deep breath to look at Li Qiye: “Our schools have many disciples training in different types of physiques, including Saint and Immortal Physiques—”

“I know what you are trying to say.” Li Qiye smiled and interrupted her: “An imperial bloodline combining with an Immortal Physique bloodline would make a perfect combination. If the offspring could inherit both legacies, then they might be able to surpass the old Immortal Emperor Yan Shi if they were to become an Immortal Emperor...”

“This is a great temptation for any lineage.” Li Qiye continued: “However, I have never thought about spreading my bloodline to the nine worlds. Even if I were to do so, the woman must be worthy of my entrustment!”

“May I ask what kind of woman would be worthy of Young Noble Li’s entrustment?” She looked at him with eyes as soft as water and directly met his gaze.

Li Qiye was still lying on the sea. He laughed and answered: “If you come have some intimate fun with me for a while, I may consider.”

Such words changed her expression. They were direct and assailed her with obscenity. It was no longer teasing, this was the most straightforward call for sex!

Ultimately, she was still a schoolmaster. This direct invitation to mate was provocative to the point of being humiliating.

“Young Noble Li must be joking.” She regained her composure and demure appearance to say: “I am a married woman, your request is too much of an imposition.”

“I know.” Li Qiye looked at her and said: “I understand the meaning of the white flower on your chest. I didn’t really want to reveal your scar, but I can let you know that I don’t mind you being a widow. Plus, you are still a maiden.”

The lady, despite her experience, couldn’t stay calm while handling this type of provocative conversation. After all, the topic was too much.

“Forget it, I was just kidding.” Li Qiye flatly added: “But remember, in order to get something, one must pay for it. Without an ace, you better think carefully before doing anything. Are you all worthy of my favor?”

Such words were quite domineering. If it was someone else, they would want nothing more than to be the groom of the three schools.

Zhuo Jianshi turned quiet again in the face of this dilemma. Her schools could indeed propose some very tempting conditions. However, Li Qiye was dismissive of them all.
