Mu Shaochen’s arrival caused quite a stir in Moneyfall. More importantly, numerous systems have formed an alliance to put an end to the evil that is Li Qiye. It didn’t take long before he became a vile villain that needs to be eradicated so that others can have peace.

“Rumble!” Explosions discharged in the horizon. A divine flame blotted out the sky.

At this moment, a carriage with a black glow visible from the distance came over. Its majestic aura indicated its status.

“Screech!” Eight green birds led the way, looking quite beautiful with a jade-luster on their features. They pulled the carriage, leaving destruction in its path.

A banner with the word “Mu” was located at the top. It had weathered the ages, but clearly one meant for battle. The word still emitted a ferocious bloodlust so people shuddered and made way for this carriage.

“Young Lord Mu is here.” A sect master immediately got off his own carriage and prepared a greeting.

The carriage drew closer and closer. People could see four old men - all Ascenders! Not the strongest but still quite frightening.

This ostentatious showing made everyone gasp, including the ancestors. Only someone like Dracoform could have Ascenders accompanying him like this. Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

People could see inside the carriage now - a young male wearing a golden robe that seems perfect for him.

The handsome youth was clearly pampered from a noble upbringing. His eyes were bright like starry gems, capable of seeing through everything.

The youth resembled a ruler with his gestures and temperament without acting fierce. Nevertheless, his arrogance and general contempt for others were as clear as day.

Two supreme beauties sat to his left and right. One dressed in red, clearly from a prestigious clan. The other chose green, alluring like a flower in the valley.

The youth embraced the two of them as they fed him wine and peeled then fed him fruits. He would occasionally kiss them just like a king.

“Princess of Jewelbanner and daughter of the Ouyang!” Who knows the complicated feelings the youths were having after seeing this.

Jewelbanner Princess He Yutang and Ouyang Shiqi, quite famous among the young generation. Of course, they were far from being the same level as Wu Binging in terms of fame, but plenty of youths still liked them.

“I thought Young Lord Mu wanted to marry the martial goddess and Cloudcrossing Princess was going to be his concubine?” One young cultivator said with indignation: “Why is Jewelbanner Princess with him right now?”

“Silly guy, a powerful man always has plenty of women.” A senior shook his head: “Just being from the Mu alone is enough of a draw. So many people want to go to Imperial yet can’t, but with the help of the Mu, it will be possible. Plus, he is also a great genius. When he visited Jewelbanner, he defeated the proud princess so she is willing to follow him despite not obtaining an official title.”

“What about the lady of the Ouyang?” A different youth jumped in: “This clan is much stronger than Jewelbanner Sect, she’s the successor too. Why would she agree? I’m sure there are other reasons.”

The senior laughed in response: “You’re overthinking it. The talented young lord went to visit the Ouyang and comprehended their ancestral tablet with a single glance. Thus, the clan treated him with the highest respect. He also helped Shiqi and she benefited greatly as a result, able to cultivate her clan’s supreme arts. That’s why she is following him.” [1]

“Hmph! I’m sure her ancestors are forcing her to do so, just like the martial goddess.” This young man had a crush on Shiqi and wouldn’t accept it.

“You’re too young.” The senior said flatly: “Still too optimistic and naive. This Young Lord Mu is not simple at all. I heard he could even see through the twelve variations of the Martial Ancestor, that’s why Dracoform Martial God holds him with such high regard. Otherwise, he wouldn’t be receiving the same treatment just because he’s from the Mu...”

“... I can go on and on about this. His gifts are famous in Imperial since he can understand anything after a single glance, so plenty of systems wants to suck up to him. So, a man like him with a strong and noble background, talented as well? Girls naturally will flock to him.”

Having said that, the senior gave the youth a look of pity: “Ouyang Shiqi is in love with the young lord, don’t find this surprising. Just give up; trying to compete with him will only end with disgrace.”

The youth clenched his fists in anger but he eventually lowered his head and let out a sigh in dejection. Despite his unwillingness, what was he going to do? The young lord surpassed him in all aspects.

Having a love rival like the young lord made him drown with despair. Plus, continuing on this path could be suicidal on top of implicating his own sect, if he were to provoke the young lord.

The fans could only watch the young lord play around with their goddesses in the departing carriage.

After coming to Moneyfall, Mu Shaochen announced: “I might be an outsider, but I view Myriad as a second home so I pray for peace. There is a murderous villain on the loose, so I wish to offer my strength to destroy him and his heretic ways! I hope everyone can assist me in doing so!”

“The young lord is right, we need to band together to kill Li Qiye!” Many systems answered his call.

“Coiling Dragon System will not share the same sky as that monster! We will obey your orders, Young Lord Mu!” Coiling Dragon showed the most support.

After all, they suffered heavy casualties to Li Qiye. There was no way they would let this go before his death.

Rallying cries echoed across Moneyfall. Numerous systems declared their allegiance.

Suddenly, a leisure voice interrupted the wave of support: “If anyone wishes to trouble a disciple of our Longevity System, come out and face us.”

1. Sounds like a second Li Qiye
