Chapter 5698: Dao City’s Destruction?

“Boom!” Luminous Conqueror roared, channeling more power than ever. Temporal Serum flowed from him to Momentous Frontier, fusing the two as one.

“Clank!” This allowed him to wield Momentous Star.

The all-reaping rays emanating from the weapon could pierce anyone in the crowd, elevating Luminous to the next level. It seemed that even overlords could become his victims.

The star’s light was the most brilliant and dazzling in existence. Although it didn’t illuminate the entire continent, everything seemed to revolve around it. Its blooming radiance made everything else pale in comparison. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

The other apex cultivators weren’t worth mentioning in his presence now.

“Break!” He swung the star, releasing a slash cutting through ten million miles.

Under normal circumstances, he didn’t have enough vitality and power to carry the weapon, let alone use it. Just one strand of its power could cause him to implode.

But now, he was connected to Momentous Dao and Momentous Frontier. Thus, he could use them to control the star to attack Immortal Dao City.

“Boom!” Not to mention Dao Domain, the entire continent shifted from the attack. An energy tsunami engulfed the continent; everyone could sense the strike.

Living beings dropped to the ground and trembled in fear. This included villagers in remote places or merchants in a large city. The beasts and birds in the wild felt the same fear.

“Bam!” Fiery sparks the size of planets erupted from the impact point.

It couldn’t destroy the gate but left large craters and chasms outside. Dao Domain became a tiny boat amidst a torrential storm. The waves could lift everything into the air; the sheer impact robbed the survivors of their voices.

Runes appeared around the city after the first blow. Immortal Dao City seemed to be entering a defensive state.

“Break!” Luminous went wild, channeling all energy sources from Momentous Frontier.

The accumulation from eras was finally let loose, breaking down all proverbial dams.

He slashed repeatedly; each swing could destroy the immortal continent if it wasn’t focused perfectly on the gate.

“Shit!” Emperors and monarchs were in awe after seeing the immortal slashes. No one had a chance in hell of stopping a single one.

“Boom!” Immortal Dao City felt an actual threat and more runes and rays manifested into reality.

Luminous entered a frenzied state and didn’t stop slashing, pushing the weapon to the limit.

Since there was no controller, Immortal Dao City couldn’t muster its true power. Its runes faltered before the unceasing offense.

The treasure itself withstood the slashes but not the area around it. All of Dao Domain suffered grievous destruction to its inhabitants’ dismay. There was a chance that the ground would crumble before the destruction of the gate.

“Is this the end of Dao City?!” Spectators were scared out of their mind.
