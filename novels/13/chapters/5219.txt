Chapter 5220: The Fourteenth Phenomenon

“Bam!” The dragon couldn’t claw through the azure.

This bought enough time for the genius to enter the second image - a bright expanse with countless galaxies and stars.

He roared again and activated his myriad dao, creating a cosmo of dao not inferior in the slightest.

The galaxies descended but still couldn’t break through his dao.

“Rumble!” Celestial barriers were erected and kept him safe.

He moved on to the third phenomenon - an abyss resembling the jaws of a colossal beast. Instead of falling into the darkness, he chanted and created a timeless dao path beneath his feet, capable of crossing through the reincarnation cycle…

“He’s unreal!” Spectators were amazed by his masterful display.

This genius with twelve sacred fruits dealt with the offenses thrown at him sublimely. Even the big shots couldn’t help but feel admiration.

In reality, the majority of dragon lords would never reach his level. Most stopped at around four or five fruits but this was more than enough to dominate a region.

As for Xiao Qingtian, he obtained twelve at a young age, meaning that his future was still limitless. Others couldn’t help but feel both envy and jealousy while watching him in action.

Loud detonations reverberated as he crossed through the phenomena. However, he showed signs of fatigue at the tenth phenomenon.

“He won’t be able to get through the fourteenth.” Ye Fantian assessed the situation.

“Boom!” Xiao Qingtian released all of his energies. If it wasn’t for him being inside a phenomenon, his aura would crush all the weaker cultivators into dust.

“Go!” His twelve sacred fruits became resplendent, granting him enough power to make it through the eleventh image.

“Eleven!” The crowd applauded after seeing this - a youth capable of withstanding dao images left behind by two supreme cultivators.

“He’s still going!” Xiao Qingtian entered the twelfth image, completely drenched in sweat.

He had no choice but to maintain his peak state. His twelve fruits released boundless chaos true energy in order to fuel an azure barrier.

“Boom!” Everything exploded but he still made it to the thirteenth.

Unfortunately, the azure was no longer there. His barrier was now limited to the immediate vicinity.

He barely had the strength to stand. The mere pressure nearly bent his spine but he kept on walking forward.

Meanwhile, spectators watched with bated breath. They were now more impressed by his determination and willpower than his cultivation.

His grand dao and sacred fruits pulsed with instability. Nonetheless, they still didn’t extinguish. He seemed to be carrying a cosmo while inching forward, relying on willpower alone. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

He sweated profusely as his face turned red. His muscles tensed to the limit; his bones creaked loudly.

His effort earned him the love of the crowd. They quietly cheered for his success.

He didn’t care for his image at all. The only thing on his mind was to take another step forward. His current success wasn’t only due to his unrivaled talent but also his extraordinary determination. Nothing could bring him down and force him to yield.

“Pop!” He finally made it through the thirteenth image and collapsed.

Nonetheless, he got up once more and tried to enter the fourteenth image.

“Boom!” An immense pressure overwhelmed him, robbing him of control over his own body. He couldn’t even let out a battle roar. His foot never touched the ground before he was sent flying, vomiting blood.

Everyone saw his tenacity - still persevering despite nearly being crushed to pieces. This virtue was rather rare.

Those possessing the same level of strength as him might have given up long ago, not wanting to even attempt the fourteenth image. As for him, that last step squeezed out every last bit of his strength.

As he lay on the ground, he took out a pill and ate it while lamenting: “Damn it, just one more step.”

“Young Noble Xiao, you’re already the best.” One dragon lord sincerely praised.

“Yes, you are number one for making it to the fourteenth image.” The others weren’t stingy with their evaluation, thinking that he was worthy of being one of the Three Tians.
