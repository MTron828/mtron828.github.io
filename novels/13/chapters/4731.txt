Chapter 4732: Soaring Immortal Slash

“Dao Brother, try this!” Five-sun King laughed and leaped into the air.

He instantly appeared above Li Qiye and pushed his bowl downward with lightning speed.

The five-colored radiance poured down and left no room to escape, immediately sealing Li Qiye. Next came the bowl capturing him.

While inside, he faced the force of heaven and earth crumbling down around him for total suppression.

“Boom!” The ground sank down by thirty feet and cultivators lost stability for a moment.

The crowd gasped after feeling the weight of the world. Their bones started cracking, unable to handle this pressure.

“Boom!” Mountains and rivers lost their shape and became flat fields.

Cracks appeared beneath Li Qiye’s feet and spread to all eight directions. He sank to the ground, inch by inch. It wouldn’t be long before a complete burial. Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“This weight is immense.” Spectators from a million miles away were sinking down as well.

If they were the targets of the bowl, they would have been reduced to fleshy bits and blood in the blink of an eye.

“That’s why it is called Bowl of the World. The whole weight of the world pushes down during an attack.” An eastern ancestor elaborated: “It can obliterate a sect in just a second.”

Listeners gasped after hearing this. No single man could withstand this weight.

The suppressive process continued before the committed viewers. They found Li Qiye impressive once again by not dying instantly.

He held the entire world up with his shoulders. Alas, this fully immobilized him.

“Die!” The young emperor made his move.

His sword soared through the air with blinding rays. Those standing a million miles away screamed as blood streamed down their eyes. They combined together and formed a slash faster than time itself.

No one saw how fast it was, not even ancient ancestors who activated their heavenly gaze.

Due to its speed, time seemed to be reversing and everyone saw countless images within a single second before being blinded by their own blood.

“Ahh!” They grabbed their eyes and bellowed in pain.

“Soaring Immortal Slash!” Only the mightiest ancient ancestors and true monsters escaped the devastating effect of the temporal reversal. Nonetheless, they were still moved by this youth’s ability since they needed to use their strongest weapons and top defensive technique in order to stop it.

A detonation occurred and brought the timeline back to normal. The result was still a point for Li Qiye - a successful stop.

In reality, he was simply standing still due to the bowl’s suppression. The tip of the sword stopped three inches before piercing his throat. It was as if there was the hardest yet invisible substance protecting Li Qiye.

“!!!” Spectators bellowed in astonishment.

The sword technique has reached the temporal level - capable of affecting time and bypassing defenses.

They lost control of their own body due to the temporal fluctuation, unable to see the attack - let alone block it.

How did Li Qiye manage to stop the sword from moving forward in his current state?

“How is he doing this?” An expert became slack-jawed.

“Power, pure power.” An ancient ancestor saw the hints: “It is brimming around him and serving as a barrier.”

“How could pure power stop that slash? Just imagine the raw force required.” An undying cultivator took a deep breath.

Naturally, both his opponents became alarmed.
