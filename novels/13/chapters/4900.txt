Chapter 4901: Regal Sky Dragon

“Virtuous Nephew, you’re overthinking it. Can the current Alliance do anything right now? The empress dowager is no longer around, Black-dress Lady is dead. It requires protection or outsiders will destroy it. We’re from the same lineage, this alliance is just right.” Ascension Sacred Lord smiled and shook his head.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“How shameless.” Jian Yunyun coldly remarked.

“That’s fine, I won’t force the issue. Hand the key over, out of consideration that we’re from the same branch, I will leave afterward.” He suggested again.

“And if I refuse?” She said.

“You already know the answer.” He waved his hand and said: “I must have this key, no, we must have this key. If you choose to be stubborn, you will share the same fate as Black-dress Lady.”

“All of you are traitors, this will not be forgotten.” She gritted her fists after hearing this.

“You’ve said this already.” Ascension said: “She obstinately stuck to her course and faced the consequences. Most importantly, the Alliance no longer has the power to keep the key. Reason and force are not on your side.”

“So Ascension should hold the key instead? That is not part of the rules stated by the ancestors.” She retorted.

“Not the alliance either. According to the ancestral creed, Heavenpeak should be in charge of it but unfortunately, they have been destroyed.” Ascension sighed in response.

The loss of Heavenpeak Conqueror and his sect was a serious blow to Primal Lineage.

“Since the order was disrupted, the Alliance stepped in.” She said.

“As I’ve said, just invite the empress dowager and exchange the other item for it.” Ascension shook his head.

Of course, if she was still around, this conversation wouldn’t be happening in the first place. The Alliance didn’t have a single dragon lord left, hence her having to shoulder this burden.

“Words are meaningless at this point. Give me the key, now!” He glared at her.

“Over my dead body.” She didn’t relent.

“Then I will have to kill you. What a shame, dying at such a young age.” He chillingly said.

“Clank!” A saber hummed and the intents surrounding her erupted into the air. They formed a heavenly saber for a direct slash.

Just his will alone was majestic and endless - capable of splitting the sky. This was the power of a dragon lord with one sacred fruit.

She was not in this realm so the saber intents alone suppressed and immobilized her. The power disparity seemed impossible to overcome.

“Boom!” In this crucial moment, a greenish-black aura emanating from her expanded for a thousand miles. The roars of dragons could be heard inside this illusory paradise and a greenish-black tree appeared to block the saber intent.

“Not bad, Regal Sky Dragon!” Ascension shouted in response: “So this is a secret technique from a progenitor but Virtuous Niece, this is still not enough to stop my blade!”

The technique was among the best in Primal Dao. However, only the Alliance had access to it.

Its mystical nature allowed her to stop the saber intents despite being grossly weaker.

“Clank!” Ascension finally raised his saber. The glint from it was incomparably sharp and could kill mighty cultivators.

“Ugh.” She vomited a mouthful of blood. Her secret technique was not enough to stop it.

In reality, a youth capable of defending against a dao lord was already impressive enough. There was no way she could handle the actual slash.

In this crucial moment, her robe became illusory and teleported her next to Li Qiye. She then carried him and disappeared from sight.

“Clank!” The slash finally came. Ascension did not hold back and knew that she might try to escape. This slash was enough to catch her no matter what.

Alas, Blacksmoke Regalia was indeed special, capable of saving her and Li Qiye from the strike. Anyone else beneath the dragon lord realm would have been decapitated.

The robe brought the two of them deep into the mountain, traveling ten thousand miles in the blink of an eye.

She was still coughing out blood along the way. The power of that slash earlier still grievously injured her. She was only alive thanks to the robe.

“Your injuries are serious.” Li Qiye shook his head.

She channeled her energy and spat more blood out before sitting down and taking a pill.

“You need to leave now.” She said: “Ascension Sacred Lord is coming soon, you have nothing to do with this.”

She only wanted to ask him questions, not involve him in this internal conflict. Ascension was not merciful and would kill him too.

“What about you?” He sat down and smiled.

“What else can I do?” She smiled bitterly while channeling her merit law: “The Alliance has nothing left, a pagoda lacking stability will slant eventually.”

“You can just hand over what they want?” He made another bonfire and said.

“Grandma died protecting the key, I will not let her death be in vain. Her spirit will not rest if I were to yield.” She bit her lower lip and said with determination.

Black-dress Lady took care of her since youth. Letting her down was unacceptable.
