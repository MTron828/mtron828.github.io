Chapter 4072: Shocking Everyone

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Others naturally noticed this phenomenon unraveling at the plain. Numerous sects sent experts there to scout.

The beams were as bright as countless suns and startled everyone. This was doubly true for those in Armament Mountain.

“What is going on?” The disciples didn’t know whether this was auspicious or ominous.

Recently, only bad things have been happening to their sect - the mysterious disappearances and the quaking at the ancestral peak. Thus, another big commotion left them nervous. Outsiders had no idea but they had a tough time recently.

“What is this a sign of?” Another murmured.

“Looks like it’s coming from the Tang’s plain, isn’t that an abandoned area?” A powerful disciple activated his vision.

“Hmm, maybe a treasure is appearing?” A friend speculated.

This excited the crowd. “Really? That desolate land actually has treasures?”

Those from Armament thought nothing of the plain.

“Who knows?” Someone versed in history said: “That clan had big shots before.”

“What do you mean by big shots? Like a dao lord? I haven’t heard of any dao lord with this last name.” Others hurriedly asked.

“No, their ancestor was a tycoon, extremely wealthy…” The first disciple responded.

“Still just a country bumpkin then.” The others said.

Members of the cultivation world didn’t hold a high opinion of money. Most only cared about power and the fists.

“Not quite.” He explained: “He was special and created a method called money fall, it’s magical. Plus, he was rich enough to stand out in all of Eight Desolaces.”

“Hmm, in that case, maybe he really did leave behind a treasury.” Someone else speculated.

“Then what the hell are we waiting for? Let’s go check it out.” The group wanted to travel to the plain.

However, one guy hesitated and said: “I don’t think we can go outside right now. The elders aren’t letting us leave our post.”

“I don’t get it, we didn’t even panic this much during the disappearances.” His friend said.

They started talking about the issue privately.

The disappearance scared them at first but all the victims returned after losing their belongings. This wasn’t a big deal and it didn’t kill the spirit of the sect. However, something else happened recently.

The rules became strict and numerous defensive lines were put up. Disciples weren’t allowed to travel freely. Since the order came from above, they didn’t dare to question it.

The chief elder, one of the strongest elders here, also gazed at the plain.

“What is going on there?” He found this astonishing.

“We haven’t heard of any peculiarities recently.” A disciple next to him reported.Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

“Go ask the Tang, see what’s happening.” He ordered.

Armament Mountain allowed sects within its jurisdiction to deal with their own internal problems. The elder also followed this rule.

The disciple went to gather information and came back to report: “Elder, the plain has a new master now. The members of the Tang are leaving as well.”

“New master? Who bought it?” He slightly frowned, wondering who would buy the crappy piece of land.

“A guy named Li Qiye, everyone says that he’s the richest in the world.” The disciple had a strange expression.

“Li Qiye, the brat that won the Preeminent Legacy?” He frowned again.

“Yes.” The disciple answered.

“Which sect is he from?” He asked.

“I’m not sure, he’s definitely not one of us though.” The disciple answered.

“He came to buy land under our jurisdiction?” He said.

The sect never cared who the Tang sold the plain to before. However, they thought that since it was so close to their sect, no outsiders would purchase it. Thus, he had a bad feeling about this unknown brat.

“I heard that First Brother tried to stop it but Clan Master Tang insisted. That Li Qiye guy paid one hundred million, he couldn’t keep up.” This disciple had access to new information.

“Hmph, trying to act tough with dirty money here?” He snorted. It seemed that Li Qiye, a new-rich, was trying to provoke their sect by flaunting his wealth.

“Tell your First Brother to be in charge and get to the bottom of this.” He ordered with a serious tone.

“I understand. But, Li Qiye is not under our jurisdiction…” The disciple bowed and hesitated.

“He’s in our territory right now and will have to obey.” He paused for a bit before continuing: “It doesn’t matter how rich he is. If he’s a dragon, he’ll coil for me, a tiger? He better crouch down. Otherwise, hmph, I’ll teach him a lesson.”

“Affirmative.” The disciple said before pondering for a bit: “Should we report this to the sect master?”

“No need, she has something more important to take care of so she’s in isolated cultivation. Just report back to me.” He waved his hand.

The disciple obeyed. However, he found it quite strange because their sect master hasn’t shown up for administrative duties for a while now. Their sect master had always worked hard and never slacked off before.

He wasn’t the only one thinking this either. Other sect members shared the same sentiment.
