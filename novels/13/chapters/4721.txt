Chapter 4722: Brotherly Love

Two martial brothers lost to Li Qiye in just a moment.

Speargrasp was a direct disciple of Enveloping Monarch. His talent and power far exceeded his peers. In reality, he was on the same level as the five conquerors. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

If he had chosen the dao lord path, there would be six conquerors or one of the current five would be removed from the list. His current power surpassed some ancient ancestors. Alas, his aerial thrust was swiftly defeated by Li Qiye.

“The five conquerors must work together.” Someone murmured.

“No, it is time for them to use their resources. The monarchs have to take action.” An ancestor disagreed.

The big shots nearby exchanged glances. Though Li Qiye made quick work of the young generation, this didn’t mean that he was immune to Three Thousand Dao.

Currently, there were at least two monarchs among the six present - Tyrant and Skybreak. As for the others, it wouldn’t take long for them to arrive at the Primordial Union.

Most important, Dao Sanqian could be a part of the equation as well. If Three Thousand Dao wanted Shen Juntian to become the dao lord, it might have to mobilize all of its forces against Li Qiye

Therefore, the big shots here wondered if they would start mobilizing first. This applied to the other behemoths as well. Now was the time to work together and kill Li Qiye.

“Rumble!” Both Shen Juntian and Speargrasp got out of the rubble and appeared to be seriously injured.

Injuries were rare due to their excellent battle ability. Moreover, those capable of wounding them would need several hundred rounds, not just a single move like Li Qiye.

“Clank!” Speargrasp’s weapon was known as Celestial. It didn’t give up just yet and still pulsed with a ringing and chilling aura. Though he wasn’t a match for Li Qiye, his aura still suffocated the crowd.

“Leave, I will fight him.” His spear resembled an unsurpassable evil mountain as he stood in front of Shen Juntian, ready to stop an army for his junior brother.

The crowd understood that he was trying to save Shen Juntian. Despite the insurmountable odds, he still showed no sign of fear.

“No need for this, Senior Brother.” Juntian refused.

Speargrasp gazed intensely at Li Qiye while answering: “Losing is a part of fighting, this ends here.”

Juntian has lost so there was no reason to stick around. Moreover, as long as he was alive, there would always be hope for the future. Death would end everything.

“He’s a good senior brother.” An ancestor became emotional.

Both were supreme geniuses from the same sect but they weren’t jealous of each other. Speargrasp, in this case, was ready to die for Juntian.

“One can’t ask for more in life.” Youths felt their eyes moistening and their blood becoming hot.

How many cultivators actually had someone willing to die for them?

“Heroic and brave.” An ancient ancestor who has lived for many years still found this moving.

“Senior Brother, the path of the dao lord requires fighting instead of hiding.” Juntian said: “I cannot abandon the pure competitive spirit.”

“Fine, as you wish.” Speargrasp glanced at him and sighed. With that, he stepped aside but was still holding his spear and being on high alert. He seemed ready to block a fatal move for Juntian if necessary.

Juntian stepped forward to face Li Qiye again, completely unafraid of this unbeatable foe.

“The dao lord sired a fine son.” Many gave him a thumbs-up.

Supreme geniuses didn’t want to die early before realizing their potential. Moreover, their sect had plenty of backers as well. When they chanced upon a perilous situation, they had methods of escaping alive. As for Juntian, he was meeting this opponent head-on.

“I still haven’t given up, Dao Brother. I’m aware that I am weaker than you but I wish to keep on fighting.” Juntian said.

“Commendable, but try not to lose your life.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Cultivation is defying the heaven itself.” Juntian said: “From peril comes enlightenment. If I avoid danger, I will never be able to see the truths of the grand dao and will not be qualified to stay on the path. Death can’t be a deterrence.”

“Well said.” Li Qiye praised again: “Come, show me your enlightenment when you’re at the end of your rope.”

“Dao Brother, you have yet to go all out. I wish to see an actual move of yours, and with a weapon. Would that be alright?” Juntian took a deep breath, challenging Li Qiye’s full power.

He wished to see the truths of the dao along with Li Qiye’s foundation.

Speargrasp’s expression soured. This challenge was both foolish and ominous in nature.
