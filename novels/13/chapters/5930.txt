Chapter 5930: The Original Pursuit

“Hmm, indeed.” Li Qiye smiled.

She still didn’t get any clue from the relaxing man this time.

“I heard Poye is dead now, have you received the same information?” She asked.

“And?” Li Qiye shrugged.

She became disappointed because she failed to read his expression. Although she had suspicions, pushing her luck was rather unwise.

“Are you just visiting places, Young Noble?” She changed the conversation.

“I should be asking you this, why are you walking in the mortal world?” Li Qiye smirked while staring at her.

“I wish to revisit the path I’ve taken and the road I’ve traveled since I might not be able to do so in the future.” She replied sincerely.

“Seeking a breakthrough?” He inquired. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“To be honest with you, Young Noble, I haven’t made up my mind yet. I might go to visit Old World or enter my final secluded session soon, so I’m taking advantage of the opportunity.” She shook her head, flipping her ponytail freely again.

“After reaching a certain level, people always look back. It is not clinging to the past but rather saying goodbye to it, goodbye to the old self as well to begin a metamorphosis.” He said.

His words struck a chord in her heart as she said: “Right, it’s been so long.”

“And how does it feel to see them again?” He asked.

She looked at the yellow sand and recalled the past years - her young self crossing mountains and rivers and surpassing trials and tribulations, step by step.

“Looking back makes me appreciate how wonderful it was.” She said: “Although I had access to cultivation at home, I looked up and didn’t want to be limited in such a small world, so I traveled hoping for endless possibilities.”

“Hope and aspiration kept you going, wanting to reach the land of your dreams and the answers to all the questions in your heart.” Li Qiye nodded.

“You felt this way too, Young Noble?” She asked with a hint of surprise.

He smiled and looked outside before answering: “Good times and bad, hardship and easy passages, all of them brought you happiness and hope.”

He then sighed and stared at her: “But if one walks for too long and too far, they grow numb without knowing it and forget about their original pursuit. The world becomes less colorful and brilliant then. What was once a beautiful thing became insignificant and distant.”

“Yes, Young Noble, what you say is true.” She trembled because she had felt this previously: “I was enthusiastic during my return journey at first but hesitation arose later.”

“It is the price of growing stronger. When you were weak, a blade of grass could bring you joy and excitement, a vermillion fruit in the mountains or a sip of sweet spring water in the desert made you feel how alive this world is. Now, since you’re strong, you don’t bother giving the same things a second glance. The stronger you are, the harder it is to capture the same happiness and satisfaction.” He sighed.

“Nothing is as satisfying as before.” She tilted her head in rumination before answering.

“Greed is insatiable.” He nodded: “Perhaps an item from an overlord can interest you right now but what happens when you become stronger? Only everlasting life and indestructibility.”

She couldn’t help gazing at the sky after hearing the last line. Although she was strong, everlasting life was not within her reach.

“What awaits at that point?” She asked.

“What does one have to do now to obtain an overlord’s item?” He asked.

“Fight all challengers.” She answered.

“Yes, defeating everyone and seizing it.” He said.

She agreed because such an item was valuable enough to warrant the risk.

“So when you stand at the apex and seek everlasting life, what are you willing to do?” He asked.

She had no response for this scenario.

“Would you refine the whole world if it can grant your wish?” He smiled.

She shuddered before blurting out: “I don’t know.”

“Let’s say there is an ant nest right there and the item you’re looking for is underneath, will you dig up the ant nest to take it?” He pointed outside.

“Yes.” She nodded.

“You’re not strong enough right now to truly grasp the previous question. You are saying goodbye to the past and once you’re at the apex, you will say goodbye to the world again, it no longer has anything to do with you and is no different from an ant nest. Therefore, would you refine it to obtain everlasting life?” He elaborated.

She took a deep breath and calmed her dao heart, staring at him and asking: “What about you, Young Noble? Do you view the world as an ant nest at that point too?”

“I am just a mortal, I do not forget my original pursuit.” He smiled.

“Just a mortal... do not forget my origination pursuit.” She repeated softly before remarking: “Cannot forget the path traveled then.”

“Remember or forget, it’s not that simple.” Li Qiye said: “Power makes everything else seem like dust in comparison. When you start forgetting the path traveled, you become a passerby to the world and that is the time to leave while keeping in mind the original pursuit.”

“The right time to leave.” She mumbled.
