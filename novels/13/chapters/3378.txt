However, those who knew this man became emotional.

“Heavenly Saber Master, Xu Nan.” An elder took a deep breath and murmured.

“Where is he from?” A junior nearby quietly asked.

“A guest member of Yin Yang Gate!” The elder stared at the old man and revealed.

“Yin Yang Gate!” Many were shaken after hearing this sect’s name. The guest part didn’t matter as much. T/his chapter is updat𝓮d by n𝒐v(ê(l)biin.co/m

Anyone would have a serious expression while talking about Yin Yang Gate.

They might not know about Xu Nan but this sect alone was enough to make them shudder.

It was the strongest sect of the northern region, standing at the peak.

There was a particular phrase - northern Yin Yang, southern Buddha. Yin Yang referred to Yin Yang Gate and Buddha referred to Buddha Holy Ground.

Most believed that the holy ground was superior but when just talking about the northern region, Yin Yang Gate was certainly the strongest.

The two were separated by a massive wilderness, virtually uncrossable. That’s why no one could touch Yin Yang’s dominion.

Suoweng naturally recognized Xu Nan. His expression darkened since he had a bad feeling about this.

Xu Nan wasn’t an actual disciple from Yin Yang nor was he an elder. Being a guest cultivator in Yin Yang was indicative of his power.

Most importantly, his appearance here also mirrored Yin Yang’s stance on the matter, more or less.

Divine Black wasn’t weak but still not enough when compared to Yin Yang Gate. According to the rumors, the latter still had some heavenly sovereigns alive.

Just one being of this level could destroy all of Divine Black. They were feared by all.

Therefore, the paradigm had shifted and everyone waited to see Suoweng’s response.

“Elder Xu, are you representing Yin Yang Gate or just yourself?” Suoweng said with a solemn expression.

The other members of his sect became nervous. After all, no one could stay calm before a behemoth like Yin Yang Gate.

“Does it matter? Fellow Daoist, how long do you think you can guard this place? Maybe today but what about tomorrow? This is nothing but a disaster for your sect.” Xu Nan cleared his throat and answered.

He implied that he also knew about the secret of the treasury, hence his choice to back Three Truths. So what if Divine Black could stop this siege?

Once their secret was out, the rest of the world would come running. Strong they might be, they still had no chance of stopping everyone.

Suoweng became tense since this was indeed his biggest fear. He has been worrying about this issue all along.

Their ancestral peak was connected to a grand vein. This was enough to incite greed regardless of the existence of Immortal Emperor Zhan’s treasury.

Suoweng was now responsible for the survival of Divine Black. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that this next choice of his might determine everything.

“Yin Yang Gate wants this territory?” A spectator quietly wondered.

It was still quite far from this region, separated by landmasses consisting of numerous powers.

In the case of expansion, Yin Yang still shouldn’t start with Divine Black. Why was Xu Nan here? The crowd started to speculate.

Some became afraid because if this was the case, the neighbors nearby wouldn’t be lucky either.

“Suoweng, this is quite a predicament but both sides should take a step back. Three Truths is willing to let go of the feud and only wants to see the ancestral peak.” Xu Nan spoke up during the silence: “Be flexible and think about the future of Divine Black.”

Eventually, Suoweng took a deep breath and said: “I appreciate your goodwill, Elder Xu. However, the ancestral peak is our sacred ground, no outsiders are allowed to get up there unless it is over my dead body!”

His voice remained calm but the content was as powerful and unyielding as can be.

“We’ll defend the ancestral peak with our lives! To death!” He successfully rallied the members of Divine Black, causing them to shout.

The spectators didn’t say anything. This was a fine choice since most sects would also do the same. They would rather die in battle instead of letting their sacred grounds be defiled.

“I’ve tried.” Xu Nan shook his head: “I apologize then. You’ve made the wrong choice.”

“So you are conspiring with Three Truths?” Suoweng stared at him.

“That’s a strong word.” Xu Nan shook his head: “You might have heard of this story before but Three Truths and I are connected by fate, the same with Yin Yang Gate. That’s why I’ll have to try my best here.”

Suoweng’s eyes turned cold. He had heard of this particular rumor before pertaining to Lu Yiling. It seemed to be the truth.

“What is he talking about?” One curious spectator asked.

“I heard their genius, Lu Yiling, had visited and trained at Yin Yang Gate before. That’s the connection.” An elder from a sect nearby said.

Many found this to be terrible news. It might not be good for the region if Three Truths had a connection with Yin Yang Gate.

“I’m afraid Divine Black will lose today, it might be erased.” One expert guessed.

This situation became plausible. There were three sacred-level cultivators on Three Truths’ side, enough to crush Divine Black.

“Don’t blame us for being impolite because of your stubbornness.” The sect master of Three Truths declared.

“We don’t provoke anyone but that doesn’t mean we’re easily bullied! It’s not too late to withdraw or it’ll be a fight to the bitter end.” Suoweng sternly said.

He was ready to go all out because he still had one ace card up his sleeve - Li Qiye!

“To the death! To the death!” The Divine Black disciples’ cries echoed across the area. Morale was at an all-time high.

“Fine, begin!” Three Truths Sect Master shouted.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Large, heavy pieces of metal fell to the ground. It didn’t take long before they were assembled into a strange altar with the aura of a dao lord.

Thousands of experts from Three Truths climbed up the altar. Runic lines emerged and intertwined together, resulting in blinding radiance.

“Activate!” These experts poured their energy into the altar.
