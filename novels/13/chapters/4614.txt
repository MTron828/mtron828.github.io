Chapter 4615: Chicken

Gossips started with Ye Tingrong’s return with Li Qiye. They speculated that she might want an engagement with him.

He alone wouldn’t be a big deal. The power of one couldn’t match the behemoths but they heard about his involvement with Lion’s Roar and Ancestral Divine Temple. This would give him enough power to contend against his enemies.

“Miss Ye, you’re finally back.” A happy voice came as a man walked quickly over. He was radiant and shrouded in divine flames.

“Voidburn Godchild.” Many recognized him right away.

“Looks like his Highness is here for the engagement as well.” Another stated.

“Voidburn Pavilion is not competitive. Not to mention the behemoths, it can’t compare to the Sima or Eight-hundred Li Court.” An expert shook his head.

“His backer is Divine Dragon Valley, maybe he’s their representative.” A clan member murmured.

“We meet again, Godchild.” Ye Tingrong politely nodded. Golden Gate didn’t wish to offend anyone right now due to its precarious situation.

Voidburn was glad to see her. His sect wanted this engagement and he himself fancied her. In this case, he represented Divine Dragon Valley.

First, she was beautiful and elegant. He fell in love at first sight. In the case of success with the marriage, he might be able to gain good things from the fist emperor. The absolute best case scenario would be to obtain the peerless treasure. That would grant their sect an alliance with Divine Dragon Valley for eras to come.

Therefore, he came with ambition and aspiration. Although he knew his chance was rather low, he still desired a favorable outcome and hoped for a miracle. What if she were to like and wish to marry him?

“Our elder is drinking tea with Senior Mad Fist.” Voidburn stared intensely at her, seemingly wanting to engrave her face into his heart.

Mad Fist was the current clan master of Golden Gate and Ye Tingrong’s grandfather.

“Thank you for letting me know. Enjoy your time here at our sect and if you need anything, just let our members know.” She said.

Her polite yet distant response made it difficult. As a godchild, he was always pampered back in his sect. The female disciples there loved him so he didn’t know how to flirt.

He glanced at Li Qiye’s group and said: “Who might they be?”

He had met them back in Yin Yang Crossing but didn’t know who they were.

“Young Noble Li and his friends.” Ye Tingrong introduced them.

He slightly frowned and said: “I see, a bunch of nobodies like you wants to propose too?”

He wanted to show off his cool side and power in front of her, hence his antagonizing comment. This time around, his sect had powerful masters here. Plus, Li Qiye wouldn’t dare to cause trouble here.”

“Do I hear a chicken running its mouth? Looks like it doesn’t know what the hell it’s saying since its butt is on fire.” Jian Ming answered instead of Li Qiye.

“Who are you calling a chicken?!” Voidburn’s expression soured.

Some in the crowd started laughing. One of them said: “Sounds about right, he is a fire chicken.”

Voidburn Godchild was a demon - his true form was a fire cloud fowl.

“Who is laughing?!” He glared at the crowd but some didn’t stop laughing.

Though he was relatively famous and strong, everyone here came from great powers. They weren’t afraid of him. Only the behemoths could make them back off.

Voidchild’s embarrassment turned into anger. He glared at Jian Ming and threatened: “Brat, you must be tired of living.”

“The brat is annoying indeed but he has a higher chance of winning the engagement than you. Stand aside, little chicken.” The daoist added.

“Stop it.” Jian Ming glared at the daoist.

Voidburn focused his enmity toward Jian Ming after learning that he was a suitor as well. The members from the behemoths were one thing but he had no problem dealing with Jian Ming.

“Who the hell do you think you are?” Voidburn said with disdain: “Just a member of a declining clan, take a look in the mirror first and know your place!”

Jian Ming had thick skin regarding himself but didn’t appreciate anyone talking down on his clan.

“Little chicken, I hope you can back your words up!” He turned red and shouted back. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Haha, he’s angry now.” The daoist laughed. Jian Ming seemed to be more tempestuous and easily flustered when it came to Ye Tingrong.

“You will fight me? Bring it.” Voidburn sneered.

“Very well.” Jian Ming’s eyes flashed with murderous intent.

“He’s getting serious now.” The daoist could tell.

“Gentlemen, why don’t we all take one step back?” Ye Tingrong said, not wanting trouble near her sect.

“Miss Ye, please don’t stop me. I will teach this ignorant loser a lesson.” Voidburn declared.

“That’s my line, little chicken.” Jian Ming stepped forward.

“A lesson is too lenient, kill him.” Li Qiye ordered.

Everyone exchanged glances. Paramount Scion smiled while Ye Tingrong let out a sigh.

“The death sentence is given.” The daoist said.

“Our young noble has called for your death.” Jian Ming confidently pointed at Voidchild and said: “Your time to be arrogant is over.”
