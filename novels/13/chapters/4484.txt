Chapter 4485: I Was Not Me

“I see, you have asked for a reading in the past.” The daoist blurted out.

“Yes, your ancestor talked about being able to reach the heaven and calculate anything. Did it work?” Li Qiye smiled.

The daoist became emotional because he recalled a legend from his clan, or rather, the last words and ancestral guidance.

Their forefather left behind this teaching after paying a great price. As a descendant, he didn’t know the details because it was too long ago. Their clan had changed dramatically and experienced ups and downs.

Nonetheless, the ancestral guidance was successfully passed down.

“I was not me and can’t be selfless.” He murmured. [1]

Having said that, he asked Li Qiye: “I have many things I don’t understand due to the time constraint. However, that’s the phrase left behind by our forefather, his last words. The clan recorded and passed it down for eras now. We do not dare to forget or speculate. Now, since you have brought up the reading in the past, could this be your fortune, Great Immortal?”

“I was not me and can’t be selfless.” Li Qiye said softly. A while later, he nodded and said: “Your forefather has tried his best.”

“Rumor has it that the forefather paid a great price during the previous epoch. He wished to seer the heaven itself but suffered a tribulation. He was fortunate to survive but ended up being on his last leg.” The daoist took a deep breath.

In their historical records, their forefather was a heaven-defying cultivator known for his fortune-telling. Even the ancient emperors found his reading to be extremely accurate.

Peerless masters and monstrous existences viewed him with respect. They came to ask about their future. Thus, this was the apex of divining. No descendants have ever reached this height again.

Once he became older and at the prime of his art, he once performed a serious ceremony. The reason for this session remained unknown.

It was just that the forefather saw something forbidden, resulting in his death not long after. He left behind the cryptic phrase - I was not me and can’t be selfless.

The descendants researched this phrase for the possible meaning. This went on for generations but they couldn’t understand it. Thus, they decided to pass it down.

In time, their clan managed to produce another top diviner. This person said that the phrase was meant for a customer and had nothing to do with their clan.

Today, the daoist met Li Qiye and tried to give him a reading. What he saw in the river of time made him think that Li Qiye might be this customer. In other words, the fated one.

“The prophecy has indeed reached the heaven itself. But, your forefather didn’t have enough power to suppress the heaven, so a tribulation was expected. The will of the heaven isn’t to be known.” Li Qiye aid.

The daoist bowed deeply and became curious: “Great Immortal, may I ask for the meaning of this phrase?”

His curiosity was understandable. After all, this has been the greatest puzzle of their clan. Given Li Qiye’s comment, the guy might actually know the answer.

Li Qiye looked up at the sky with a profound gaze. Time came to a halt as he peered through time and space. His target was the farthest reach of the azure.

After a while, he told the daoist: “Fine, since your forefather paid the price, it is alright to tell you. At the very end, he saw a figure and only part of the whole thing. Unfortunately, this reading was too late.”

Back in the previous epoch, this reading would have been meaningful to Li Qiye. Now, it was meaningless since Li Qiye already had a vivid idea of all the details and answers.

“A figure?” The daoist murmured. This only made him more confused. Nonetheless, his forefather must have seen something shocking. It might have been the greatest fortune-telling in history.

However, why did seeing the figure cause a tribulation? Was it taboo just to look at the existence?

“So who is it?” The daoist couldn’t help but ask.

“That’s not something for you to know, it is above your reach right now. If I were to reveal, ominous things will happen to you. A tribulation, for one.” Li Qiye said.

This made him shudder. He absolutely couldn’t handle the tribulation or the price suffered by his forefather, not his clan either.

“I understand.” The daoist bowed.

At this time, Jian Ming who went to look for information ran back and excitedly told LI Qiye: “I got it! I know where those thieves went, come, let’s go teach them a lesson!”

“That’s great.” Wise heaved a sigh of relief: “And watch your mouth, we’re not teaching anyone a lesson. We are to take back our dao stone, that’s all.”

Wise was open-minded about this and could see the Yu not wanting to give back the dao stone. He didn’t want to escalate the issue and made it more combative.

“Young Noble, are we going right now?” Wise asked for Li Qiye’s instruction.

“Yes, let’s take it back as soon as possible to avoid needless complication.” Li Qiye said.

As the group was leaving, the daoist hesitated for a moment and then decided to call out: “Great Immortal!”

“Oh, don’t want our young noble to leave? I’m sure you want to offer your service now. That’s fine, we do need an errand boy.” Jian Ming said.

The daoist ignored him and said: “Great Immortal, Grotto Courtyard might have something fatefully connected to you.”

“What is it? An immortal artifact or something left behind by an ancient emperor?!” Jian Ming answered before Li Qiye. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“A girl.” The daoist’s expression became serious.

‘A girl?” This piqued Li Qiye’s interest.

“Grotto Courtyard bought her from an external source. She was excavated from a dangerous location, encapsulated in a boulder yet still looking animated. They want to auction her.” The daoist said.

“So like a fossil.” Jian Ming became invested.

“I don’t think so. I believe she is still alive.” The daoist shook his head.
