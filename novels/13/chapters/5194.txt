Chapter 5195: Explosion

“Rumble!” A towering tree appeared inside Resplendent Array. The branches and leaves spread out to connect with the momentum of the nine worlds in a blinding spectacle.

This caused the momentum to appear again. Resplendent Monarch and the others found themselves traveling to the previous epoch.

Previously, they could tell that they were in an illusory world. Now, the dao laws of the nine worlds became stable and palpable. They felt that escaping was even harder while being enveloped by light.

After a long while, the light subsided and they saw themselves standing in the original courtyard.

Li Qiye raised the board with his palm and took one last look at it before tossing it back to Resplendent Monarch: “Train hard with it.”

“Thank you, Young Noble, we will do our best to harmonize with the array again.” Resplendent prostrated and was overwhelmed with emotion.

Li Qiye’s identity no longer mattered; the only thing the monarch knew was that their array has been improved.

“You will need more time, I don’t think we can take advantage of it now.” Gourdkeeper said.

“I’m leaving right now to train.” Resplendent didn’t dare to waste time and bowed toward Li Qiye again before leaving.ALL new 𝒄hapters 𝒐n n𝒐v(𝒆)lbin(.)com

“Young Noble, you are simply incredible. It looks like I have to try my best too in order to get you our lotus.” Gourdkeeper calmed down and said.

Prior to this, he only wanted to send the message and kept his effort at a minimum. Now, he felt inclined to try harder.

Li Qiye only smiled in response since it didn’t matter to him. The end was the same; only the process varied.

“Boom!” Suddenly, something erupted in Alchemy Dao, causing the ground to shake violently.

Disciples became alarmed and looked up at the sky. They saw flames rushing upward like a fire dragon over yonder.

“Shit, Big Bro is failing again!” Gourdkeeper ran toward the flames without saying goodbye.

“Looks like a cauldron is out of control.” Li Qiye said.

“First Uncle has been trying to finish an ancestral cauldron.” Saintess Shao Yao became worried.

“Your ancestral cauldron is connected to the earth veins. If it explodes, half of this place will disappear.” Li Qiye said.

“It’s possible.” She turned pale and understood why Gourdkeeper panicked.

“Let’s come take a look before it’s too late.” Li Qiye shook his head.

He wouldn’t give a damn if this was another lineage. Alas, Alchemy Dao had deep ties with him.

“Really?” She didn’t know why she felt so much confidence in him, that he would be able to solve any crisis.

She immediately led him to the source of the flames without saying anything else.

This place was heavily guarded and unavailable to most disciples. As she led the way, she saw many disciples evacuating.

The atmosphere became tense since they were alchemists and could tell that the cauldron was becoming unstable.

Pill Valley was the name of the location. It contained their ancestral cauldron - Purification - that was created by Heavenly Sage Yuan, capable of refining Nine-form Imperial Remedies and Time-honed Longevity Pills.

Recently, Panacea Monarch has been using it to create some top-level pills. Alas, something seemed to be going wrong.

Purification Cauldron was connected to the earth veins beneath. Thus, a cauldron explosion could destroy half of Alchemy Dao, hence the evacuation.

When the group made it to the valley, they saw the six grand elders of the sect. The saintess then realized the gravity of the situation.

Panacea Monarch’s direct disciple, Miracle Saint Child, was also present.

“No outsiders.” He scowled and didn’t let them in.

“Senior Brother, now is not the time for you to be stubborn. I will take responsibility for this.” She retorted strongly.

They then focused on the great cauldron in the middle of the valley. It had nine levels rotating at different paces and directions.

On the walls of the levels were one hundred fire eyes spewing out true flames. One surged like a rapid while another was as gentle as a stream.

The very nature of the flames varied as well. One was tinged with red and yellow, looking like the infernal fire of hell. Another had a golden hue - the imperial style. A different one had a dark glow of the demonic affinity…

Now, the flames were in disarray and didn’t just aim for the alchemy ingredients inside the cauldron.

A purple-robed old man tried to control the cauldron. He had a violet glow and looked as tough as a lingzhi root. He had a medicinal fragrance on his body since he was always around plants and pills.

He was known as Panacea - the best maker of Nine-form Imperial Remedy. Unfortunately, he had lost control and the chaotic flames oozed out to form a maelstrom, trying to suck him in.

Gouldkeeper was there to assist. The two martial brothers worked together but ended up being trapped by their own concoction.

They gritted their teeth while being drenched in sweat, using their impressive cultivation in an attempt to seal the cauldron. Alas, the flames pulled them in so they were stuck in their own seal.

They could only try their best to survive but time was running out.
