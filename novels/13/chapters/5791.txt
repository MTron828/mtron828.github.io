Chapter 5792: Can Fight The Heaven

“Boom!” The seemingly alive mech brimmed with boundless power. The living beings and the myriad dao within the three thousand destroyed worlds returned to life.

The full power of an epoch coursed through the mech - a truly terrifying sight to behold. The shockwaves made it hard for emperors and conquerors to stand straight. Some dragon lords and ancient gods were blown away despite staying at a safe distance.

“So this is the might of a true paragon artifact.” A spectator said.

They viewed the mech as an epoch lord, capable of crushing both the six continents and Eight Desolaces with one blow.

“Sacred Teacher, here I come!” Jiao Heng excitedly piloted the mech: “Take this!”

He utilized a smash again, far stronger than the previous ones.

“Boom!” This escaped the containment of Celestial Court, causing others to feel its power and faint from horror.

Li Qiye clenched his fist before the incoming apocalyptic smash.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Barely discernible vibrations came three times from his clenched fist.

This somehow separated time, space, and the grand dao. The three separate affinities coiled around his fist as he punched forward.

Separation of these aspects was impossible for emperors, especially in such a short time. Nevertheless, Li Qiye manipulated the length, space, and myriad dao of an epoch into his punch - resulting in a force not inferior to the mech’s destructive capability.

“What a technique!” Jiao Heng saw through the profundity of the punch and shouted in amazement.

“Just a casual punch.” Li Qiye chuckled and said: “Spatio-temporal Dao Fist!” Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Boom!” The two forces collided and eons seemed to have shattered.

A terrifying force surged forward after the initial blast, sweeping and overturning Celestial Court. Stars were pushed millions of feet upward while emperors were sent flying.

Celestial Court would have been reduced to ashes if it wasn’t for the internal suppression of Elder Galaxy.

The invincible mech couldn’t handle the impact and fell backward into space, crushing countless stars along the way akin to a man falling and crushing ants.

“Bang!” It spurted something out of its mouth - essences instead of blood.

Once it got up, everyone saw cracks everywhere on its arms. Jiao Heng inside the mech also had blood streaming down the corner of his mouth.

“Insanity.” Light-dragon’s group gasped in astonishment.

Jiao Heng’s smash could have killed the majority of their group. In fact, not even the combination of immortal armaments could have stopped it.

Jiao Heng’s ability left no room for doubt. However, the more crucial aspect was the mech itself - a weapon far surpassing the previously seen prototypes.

The only thing seen by the public that stood a chance against this grand-completion paragon artifact was the immortal star of Momentous Frontier.

Of course, Elder Galaxy could also compete with it. The problem was that it had turned into an independent world; none could muster and focus its power into battle.

Despite this, Li Qiye’s punch still crushed the encounter.

“So this is the true power of an epoch lord?” An emperor murmured, speaking the thing that was on everyone’s mind.

“Impeccable, Sacred Teacher, looks like you can fight the heaven in this generation.” Jiao Heng praised with a smile.

“That I do not know, but feel free to give me an answer.” Li Qiye glanced at his fist and said.

Jiao Heng laughed and said: “I’m afraid a mortal such as myself cannot satisfy your demand but you can satisfy mine, being able to withstand the power of this mech.”

“Have any other tricks up your sleeve, mortal?” Li Qiye smiled.

Listeners grew increasingly frustrated - why did the two keep on referring to themselves as mortals when they stood at the apex as cultivators?
