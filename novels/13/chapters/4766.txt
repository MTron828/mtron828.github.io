Chapter 4767: Going Fishing

Fortunes were common in the cultivation world, especially for the bold. Alas, high-level ones meant for Liu Ruyan and Zhuo Jianshi were once in an era.

“Perhaps we should visit the maelstrom again.” Liu Ruyan suggested.

“Was polishing your physique the reason why you went there?” Li Qiye chuckled.

“No.” The two girls shook their head at the same time.

“There was a strange phenomenon requiring investigation. We went and couldn’t get out. Nonetheless, we didn’t give up and continued to search for the dao.” Jianshi elaborated.

Back then, Sky-devourer Grand Immortal represented the apex during that period. As long as they were around, their sect could continue to dominate.

However, they suddenly disappeared one day. Their closest friends and ancestors had no idea where they went. Due to their significance, their sect searched for them one era after another.

This was just a coincidence. They saw something new at the maelstrom and decided to forcefully enter.

Few places had the ability to trap them but the great maelstrom was an exception. Of course, they weren’t at risk of dying.

They abandoned unnecessary thoughts and continued to meditate inside for eras. The lack of distraction allowed them to reach their current perfect state. This, in turn, gave them the boost to leave the maelstrom.

Now, they wanted to take another step forward. Alas, what was better than perfect?

“Opportunities are encountered, not forced.” Li Qiye shook his head: “There’s no point in returning to the maelstrom.”

Li Qiye was right because that place no longer had the power to imprison them like before.

“It is still rather powerful. Our combined might can’t destroy it.” Ruyan said.

“Yes, but you still have the freedom to leave.” Li Qiye smiled.

The two agreed with this and gave up on this idea.

“Why is this devilish thing still around?” Wo Longxuan interjected.

“No one can take it down just like the burial grounds or now, the forbidden zones.” Jianshi explained: “It requires an expedition and even then…”

The three of them would still need to gather other top masters and assault these locations constantly. There was a chance of success but the price stopped them from doing so.

Furthermore, there were a number of these locations. It was impossible to conquer them all. Nonetheless, if there was someone in the world who could do so, it would be the man standing before them. Thus, they stared at Li Qiye.

They recalled the palm strike that day and remembered the feeling of being weak once more.

“Young Noble, your attack is invincible. You can conquer them.” Jianshi praised.

“Invincible? No, that was only a move from one of my enemies. I killed ten of that level before in one battle.” Li Qiye revealed.

This astounded the three women and caused them to gasp. Jianshi meant “invincible” in the truest sense of the word when she praised him just now. This was still not enough to fit that definition?

They took a deep breath and calmed down. It didn’t matter that there were ten cultivators capable of unleashing that level of technique because they had Li Qiye on their side.

The supreme overlords and monstrous cultivators might view them as ants. However, he could still massacre them. He was a symbol of hope in their mind, wiping away all despair.

“The apex of the dao is unimaginable.” Jianshi said softly: “We figured out how strong the maelstrom was after the imprisonment. I can’t believe there are still stronger things looming in the darkness.”

“Right. The maelstrom is not the strongest thing in Eight Desolaces. There are several things just as strong.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Which one is the strongest?” Wo Longxuan asked.

“A monster that has been slumbering for epochs. It might have regained most of its strength.” Li Qiye’s eyes narrowed.

“So you’re here to kill it, Young Noble?” Jianshi and Ruyan exchanged glances.Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Unfortunately, it won’t fall for my trick. I purposely used the palm strike to provoke some of them but they exercised prudence.” He said.

“If you wish to start an expedition, we shall serve as your vanguard, Young Noble.” Ruyan smiled charmingly.

“Knocking on their door one by one is too troublesome.” Li Qiye said: “Plus, we’ll be alarming the others after the first visit, it won’t be easy to find them afterward.”

“Do you have a plan in mind?” Jianshi asked.

“There will always be something tempting enough to make a move. The time is right as well.” Li Qiye said.

“The time is right?” Wo Longxuan asked.

“The old villainous heaven won’t appear in this generation so no tribulations. The time of the harvest is here.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“What thing can tempt these monsters?” Jianshi wondered because she herself didn’t care for mundane treasures of the dao lord level.

“A wondrous artifact on top of my flesh and blood. Quite nutritious.” Li Qiye smirked.

“So you’re fishing with baits, Young Noble.” The two understood. Li Qiye’s current targets this time were the hidden monsters.

“Yes, they should be dealt with.” Li Qiye said.
