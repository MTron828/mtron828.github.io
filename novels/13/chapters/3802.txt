Chapter 3803: Eternity Bulwark

People had no words to describe the scene ahead. The high monk of Heavenly Dragon Temple was the only commenter.

However, it was hard to look at Li Qiye and think that he was an enlightened monk. Nonetheless, all evidence pointed at him being able to use Buddhist arts originating from the holy ground.

This made them think that he had obtained an art left behind by Dhyana Dao Lord.

“Is Buddhism this easy to learn? One can switch halfway and still have this result?” One cultivator wondered.

Some thought about potential shortcuts existing for Buddhism. Could it be easier to learn versus cultivating the grand dao?

“I don’t think so.” One big shot disagreed with Li Qiye changing into a great monk versed in the samadhi in such a short time. He mused for a bit before continuing: “This still has to be the power of holy ground. I think the severing process earlier was incomplete so Li Qiye managed to borrow some power.”

Many agreed with his assessment. They also saw how the roots of the tree drilled into the ground like tentacles. This resembled a connecting process.

Ultimately, it should be impossible for Li Qiye to learn Buddhism in such a short time. Many monks spent their whole life trying to understand their religion yet this might not be enough to reach Li Qiye’s height.

“That wasn’t a bad attempt. Unfortunately, it is insignificant before me, doesn’t even tickle.” Li Qiye smiled.

The domineering statement made people smile wryly. That move earlier was nothing short of terrifying yet Li Qiye thought nothing of it.

Alas, the crowd knew to keep their mouth shut at this point lest they want further embarrassment.

As for Hu Ben and Phantom, they had an ugly expression due to a total failure of their prized techniques. His lack of injury dealt a heavy blow to their confidence.

“It’s a shame that you’re not as strong as the rumors.” Li Qiye continued: “There are no more chances, the next move will end you.”

Some became frozen after hearing this. An invisible hand seemed to be grasping their throat and causing everything to go black.

This casual declaration was a death sentence for both Hu Ben and Phantom. They thought that the moment Li Qiye uttered these words, the two became dead men walking. This oppressive pressure caused them to shudder in fear.

“I’m about to start. Get ready to accept your fate.” Li Qiye smiled and continued.

The two frightened opponents retreated several steps backward, intimidated.

In this blink of an eye, they felt the god of death approaching closer and closer. They now stood before the gate of hell while Li Qiye was raising his scythe with a twisted grimace.

They have experienced plenty of battles in their life, some brought them close to death. Alas, this was an unprecedented dread, their first time fearing death since it was so close.

“Activate!” Hu Ben shouted and used his temporal diagram again.

The three gates returned to him and inserted themselves into the ground, creating a starry formation.

“Rumble!” They created a fortress the size of a mountain, looking like a pyramid reaching the clouds. It seemed to be cast from precious metal with immense toughness.

Under the empowerment of the formation, runes and halos materialized to create the perfect blockade.

“Eternity Bulwark!” An ancestor took a deep breath and explained: “A famous defense of Vajra Dynasty. A forefather there relied on it to protect his citizens for three months from a relentless assault. The enemies eventually gave up.”

Hu Ben was inside the fortress with 3,800 halos rotating outside. This should be enough to stop the most terrifying attack. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

He refused to accept death thus he channeled his vitality to use this ultimate defensive technique.

As for Phantom, he could get extremely far away with his Phantom Skyshift. However, he didn’t think he would be able to get away from Li Qiye. Plus, he would rather fight to the death instead of running away.

He channeled his vitality as well. “Boom!” A violet aura manifested around him with loud crackles.

The sky turned dark and an oceanic maelstrom appeared above. Countless lightning bolts swam with the currents.

They looked like gigantic dragons assaulting the sky. The spectators shuddered in fear.

These bolts raised their claws, seemingly launching an offense. However, they swam towards Lighting Fiend instead of Li Qiye.

“Rumble!” With that, Phantom lit up and became connected to the lightning maelstrom. Lightning currents flowed around him.

The remnant bolts and beams destroyed everything nearby as he transformed into a true god of lighting.

“Lightning God Possession!” One spectator shouted: “The invincible move from an ancient emperor! Hmm, when one isn’t in the proper cultivation realm, forcefully using it will result in being crippled.”

This technique was left behind by a great emperor of Myriad-blood Sect and required Lighting Fiend to set up. However, the consequences were grave for weaker cultivators.

Alas, Phantom had no other choice. He would rather try and take Li Qiye down along with him.

“A bit interesting but it won’t end in mutual destruction.” Li Qiye was amused by their effort. He continued: “Get ready to witness the original Buddhist art of the holy ground.”

Having said that, he formed a mudra and started chanting. This caused him to be engulfed in a bright radiance, achieving the dao and becoming a holy Buddha.
