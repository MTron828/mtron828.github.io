Chapter 5245: Come Greet The Emperor Already!

As the group waited outside the main hall, a group of armored cultivators walked out with a menacing aura.

They pointed their spears and arrows at Li Qiye and the others.Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Rumble!” Figures landed from above and assumed formation to stop the group. Their bloodthirst was palpable - clearly veterans that had slain numerous enemies on the battlefields.

“Suppression Legion.” Resplendent Monarch’s eyes narrowed after seeing this.

A general with lightning flashing in his eyes came out of the palace and glared at the unwelcome visitors.

“Ladies and gentlemen, today is the alchemy duel, please leave.” He uttered coldly.

“Tell Suppression to come here to welcome our emperor’s return!” Hallowedsteel Ancestor shouted in response.

“Ancient Ancestor, choose your words carefully. My lord is the leader of Imperial Attendant, he needs not greet anyone.” The general barked back.

“No need to waste words!” Resplendent Monarch roared and took one step forward.

“Kill them!” The general ordered.  

The archers immediately released a barrage of arrows that blot out the sun.

“Scram!” Hallowedsteel waved his sleeve and the arrows exploded while still in the air.

Although the legion was impressive, they were facing mighty dragon lords and stood no chance.

Resplendent Monarch also attacked, sending a thousand legionnaires blocking the way flying.

“Such impudence!” More armored generals landed in the courtyard.

“Back off, you all are outmatched here.” A dignified voice released waves of imperial auras.

Even Resplendent Monarch and the others became frozen after sensing this tyrannical presence. All of them combined couldn’t beat Suppression Conqueror. 

“Creak.” The gate of the palace opened, revealing Suppression Conqueror sitting on the throne.

Below were generals and dragon lords sitting down along with guests from all over the world. Xiao Qingtian and Li Zhitian were also present. Some conquerors were in the audience as well.

All of them were watching an alchemy duel in the main hall - Jadecure Conqueror versus Darkflame Cauldron Emperor.

Jadecure had two dao fruits so her cultivation was only average among her peers. However, she was still young and had room for growth. Most importantly, her alchemy was exceptional, especially with regard to longevity pills.

She wore a green dress embroidered with simple flowers and vines - tall and slender with beautiful features.

Her eyes brimmed with spirituality, seemingly capable of cultivating alchemy plants. Her weak imperial aura was made up by a gentle medicinal fragrance.

The fragrance granted a comforting feeling. Anyone would feel as if they were gaining more lifespan and would be more than happy to stick hear her.

Her opponent was an old man with a fiery aura of an evil affinity, enough to cause others to tremble in fear. Just one spark from him would reduce anyone to ashes; resistance was futile.

An imperial talisman hovered above him and continuously added him strength - the reason for the immense strength of his evil inferno.

In terms of alchemy alone, he was one step weaker than Jadecure Conqueror. Alas, his empowered state certainly had the upper hand so it was only a matter of time.

“What is the meaning of this intrusion, gentlemen?” Suppression Conqueror’s throne was surrounded by clouds as he looked down on everyone. His dao laws were as suffocating as ever.

“The emperor has returned. Pay respect, Suppression.” Resplendent Monarch raised his voice.

This caused the guests and neutral spectators to exchange glances. They had a good understanding of the current political climate in Imperial Attendant City.

Some big shots were from the grand alliances, wanting to see if Suppression could further legitimize his claim over the city.

“The cauldron emperor shall win and I remain in charge, meaning that I am the lord of Imperial Attendant. There is no other emperor.” Suppression said calmly.

“It is not too late to kneel before the emperor.” Resplendent Monarch respectfully invited Li Qiye to step forward.

He became the center of the spotlight instantly. Whispers could be heard among the crowd.

Xiao Qingtian and Li Zhitian were awfully curious. They had seen Li Qiye in action before and didn’t know what to say. Why was he the lord of Imperial Attendant City now?
