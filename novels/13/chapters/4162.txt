Chapter 4163: Poplar Paragon

Some believed that the disappeared sword had returned to Sword Burial Zone. Others said that they could be hidden anywhere in Eight Desolaces, waiting for the right moment to appear. A third camp said that these swords would disperse into nothingness…

Meanwhile, the onslaught continued. Swords from the air continued raining down and killed those within the affected radius.

Cultivators became smarter and no longer dared to be reckless. It would be foolish to die before even making it inside the zone.

Occasionally, divine swords would also descend. Alas, the majority could only watch due to the danger of the sword rain. Being turned into a sieve wasn’t a pleasant way to depart.

“Where did all of these words come from?” One cultivator became curious.

“This is only a tiny portion.” An ancestor who has been there before shook his head: “You’ll the real ocean after entering Sword Burial.”

“What about the divine swords? Where are they from?” The cultivator still had many questions.

The ancestor couldn’t answer this question.

In history, numerous dao lords had attacked Sword Burial before but the mysteries still remained. No one knew where the swords came from.

“Clank!” Another blinding divine ray crossed through the air.

“Another one!” The crowd was stirred again after seeing the ray descending. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

Numerous ancestors and sect masters rushed forward, trying to evade the flying swords obstructing their path.

They took out their treasures in an attempt to break through. Fiery sparks splashed everywhere and the swords still won in the end.

“Ah!!!” Some died from this attempt; their heart being pierced numerous times.

A few sect masters and ancestors managed to stop the onslaught. Alas, they couldn’t move one step forward.

The divine sword was awfully close to the ground at this point. “Whoosh!” Suddenly, a poplar tree emerged and its branches shot out like an arrow barrage.

The branches contested against the rain of arrows. In this split second, one of them managed to coil around the descending divine sword.

An old man suddenly appeared out of nowhere and grabbed the sword. It let out a long hymn and pulsed violently.

He had a white beard, looking heroic and formidable. This was clearly an existence that has lived for many eras.

The youths weren’t familiar with him, unlike their ancestors.

“Poplar Paragon!” One ancestor gasped after seeing him.

“He’s still alive.” Another became startled.

“I’ve never heard of this title before.” A junior asked his senior.

“The strongest ancestor of Wooden Sword, he’s older than the Five Overlords.” A senior answered: “Since he stopped showing up in public, everyone assumed he was dead. This is rather unexpected.”

In fact, even the disciples from Wooden Sword didn’t know that they still had such a powerful ancestor around.

“Pineleaf Sword Lord was killed by Ninth so they need a mighty ancestor to preside over things.” An expert said.

All in all, his appearance surprised the crowd. They attributed it to various reasons - Pineleaf Sword Lord’s death or perhaps the emergence of Sword Burial Zone.

Nonetheless, they were impressed since he successfully obtained a divine sword.

“I believe that he won’t be the only one. Hallowed City Lord and the Five Overlords might come here too.” A big shot said.

Others took a deep breath. If that were to happen, then many legions would come to this area.

“We need to get inside before it’s too late.” A cultivator became anxious since time was of the essence.

Once the true masters came, it would be too late for others to join the fun.

Eventually, the rain of swords gradually subsided and the ocean disappeared.

“Rumble!” The ground shook violently as a colossal shadow appeared above.

“It’s here!” A top cultivator shouted.

The shadow turned out to be a mountain. It smashed onto the ground and had enough force to turn the strongest cultivator into mincemeat.

Once the dust settled, the spectators got a better perspective on its sheer size. It pierced magnificently upward just like an ultimate sword. However, there was a vertical crack right down the center, serving as an entrance of sorts.

“This is Sword Burial Zone?” A youth was slightly disappointed to see the mountain.

“No, this is just the entrance.” His ancestor shook his head: “The real thing is inside.” Having said that, they headed for the gate.

“We’re going, but be careful.” Another clan master led his men up the mountain.

“Go, we can’t miss this opportunity!” Others hurriedly crossed through the portal.

“Heavenly swords, you’re all mine!” More ambitious souls couldn’t wait any longer.

Thousands of cultivators leaped into the gate, wanting to be the first to obtain the legendary fortunes there.

The news of its opening spread across the continent. Other powers immediately headed for the Dragon War Plains, the behemoths included.
