Chapter 5669: Plowing

“Bam!” The vajra staff crushed the stars while wielding the wrath of the colossal Buddha.

First was enlightenment. When enlightenment didn’t work, force became the next resort. The combination of soft and hard was balanced perfectly - a display of harmony in Buddhism.

Unfortunately, their opponent was none other than Li Qiye. The flawless integration was entirely useless.

“Boom!” Li Qiye didn’t bother to block the incoming vajra and let it strike his body.

This could have pulverized the head of an emperor or a devil. The attack was blessed by the grand dao, capable of slaying anyone on the same level.

However, it failed to leave visible damage on the opponent to the Buddha’s astonishment. He naturally understood the power of his attack just now and thought that he was just seeing things.

“Buzz.” Li Qiye raised his hand and removed the concept of weight from the world.

Normally, such a move meant nothing to the youth and the colossal Buddha but somehow, this made them fall uncontrollably like mortals.

They roared, utilizing their mantra and vajra again for another devastating attack. Unfortunately, they found that their techniques and laws no longer worked.

This was Li Qiye’s absolute domain capable of reducing those affected into mere insects. Apex cultivators couldn’t escape its effect.

Their descent suddenly stopped as if invisible hands were grabbing them by the neck.

Their dao laws and Buddhist radiance dissipated, unable to protect them from this unknown force.

Li Qiye stared at them and released his grasp, causing them to slam into the ground.

“Bam!” They couldn’t get up in time before his pressure immobilized them with the force of innumerable mountains and oceans.

They had dominated in the past, fighting both emperors and entering forbidden zones. Unfortunately, their lifelong cultivation achievements became useless before Li Qiye.

They couldn’t move an inch, let alone attempt to resist or escape.

“Just like the legends! Sacred Teacher.” The young monk gave up and couldn’t help but exclaim with a smile.

“And here I thought I was the master of suppression.” The colossal Buddha smiled wryly, acknowledging defeat.

They have met powerful masters previously; some stronger than them. Nonetheless, they believed that they could surpass these beings with time.

Alas, fighting Li Qiye today showed them the limit of the dao along with the feeling of despair. The disparity was insurmountable. This was the gap between heaven and earth; they had no chance of ever crossing.

Li Qiye smiled and released his pressure: “Peerless Buddhist art and power, it’s a remarkable combination.”

“I made a fool of myself before you, Sacred Teacher. My dao is a firefly compared to your masterful transformation.” The young monk’s title was Dhyana Dao Lord.

“I am in awe. I once thought that I could smash everything under heaven with this vajra, how wrong I am. Amitabha.” Vajra Dao Lord laughed heartily.

The former was a former saint child of Buddha Holy Ground who came across a chapter of the Supreme Four Truths, Buddhamization. His Buddhist techniques and laws allowed him to spread this dao throughout Eight Desolaces.

Vajra Dao Lord also came from Buddha Holy Ground but instead of using Buddhist arts, he relied on physical strength gained from Buddhism. His weapon heralded the demise of many evil cultivators and nefarious creatures.

They were a perfect team, possessing both finesse and power. Alas, this couldn’t defeat Li Qiye’s absolute domain.

“Are there more trials before I can enter the village?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Of course not.” Dhyana shook his head and said: “We have nothing but admiration for you, Sacred Teacher, and couldn’t resist the itch to test our skills after seeing you. Seems like we have been overestimating ourselves.”

“Sacred Teacher.” The two of them deeply bowed and disappeared with lightning speed.

Li Qiye smiled and entered the village where tranquility and harmony prevailed.

Along the way, he heard the sounds of roosters crowing and dogs barking. Smoke could be seen rising from the houses, indicating that people were cooking. The aroma of freshly cooked rice prompted deep breaths from visitors.

It felt like home - a wanderer finally returning to their hometown and swallowing a mouthful of saliva, thinking that their mother had already prepared a delicious meal while their father was waiting at the doorstep. This would make anyone quicken their pace, even throwing away their bags.

The scent of earth lingered between the recently plowed fields, hinting that it was planting season. Nothing was more valuable than the peacefulness found here. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

Li Qiye walked further and saw a middle-aged man plowing the field. His pants were rolled up as he diligently tilled the field with a wooden plow.

An old ox pulled the plow through the thick mud. The man performed the task with great dedication as if every inch of land was hard-earned and worth cherishing.

Upon closer inspection, Li Qiye saw a subtle visual phenomenon near the old man - an azure sky. He seemed so carefree and natural as if he was working on cultivating the dao instead of the field.
