Chapter 4979: Large Rooster

Putting the danger of demons and beasts aside, just the disorienting landscape alone could make people lost.

However, Li Qiye knew where Shadowrider ran off to so he had a clear destination in mind. He wanted to find a few things and was patient enough to take his time.

“Rumble!” They heard loud explosions from a fierce battle along the way.

In reality, this was not a rare sight. The creatures here competed over territory repeatedly, fighting to the death.

They once witnessed a serpent monarch fighting against a bull monarch, destroying the land in the process.

Today, the combatants included a group of demon cultivators. They became demons through cultivation, not with the natural pathway from heaven and earth. Many of them have taken humanoid forms.

“Kill them!” This was a brutal carnage.

One side primarily consisted of birds while the other had land roamers such as tigers and leopards.  If they were in the lower continents, they would be added to the list of first-rate powers.

“Rumble!” The avian alliance was swift and precise with their movements, darting in and out of the battlefield. The land walkers relied on power and destruction instead.

Shockwaves crushed one peak after another. Frightening demonic energies surged into the air.

"Boom!" A majestic figure descended from the sky and unleashed a devastating blow. It was a colossal tiger demon, standing the size of a mountain, with four razor-sharp blade wings that could slice through anything.

The sight of the demonic tiger caused terror to grip the avian soldiers. The non-demon birds were grounded, unable to move.

But then, its formidable opponent arrived - a magnificent phoenix-like bird with pure white feathers that dwarfed the tiger monarch in size. Its wings could blot out the sun, and it radiated a bright, awe-inspiring white light.

The two started battling in the air before falling to the ground. As the battle raged on, blood began to rain down.

Soldiers stopped fighting and merely watched the battle between the two monarchs.

“Such power, they are comparable to dragon lords.” Yunyun trembled while sensing the demonic shockwaves.

In the end, it became clear that the bird monarch was no match for the tiger monarch, and the bird was sent crashing to the ground, creating a deep pit upon impact right in front of Li Qiye and Yunyun.

The bloodied bird made the two look like ants in comparison.

“Boom!” The tiger monarch landed and stomped on the bird, causing more blood to spill.

“Brat, hand over the god source or I will kill you and flatten your city.” The monarch said menacingly.

“In your dream!” The white bird shouted.

“Young Noble, isn’t this voice familiar?” Yunyun was surprised to hear this.

“Indeed.” Li Qiye nodded in agreement.

The two beast monarchs finally noticed the two humans. The bird couldn't believe its own eyes and shouted: “Miss Jian, Young Noble Li!”

This was enough to let Yunyun know who he was - Goldcrest Young Noble.

However, he looked like a large rooster back in Abroad, not this majestic creature. Connecting the two was impossible. If Princess Ming Shi were here, she would start laughing due to the ridiculous discrepancy.Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

He didn’t expect to see the two in Demon, especially not when he was being beaten down.

Nonetheless, he put on a smile in front of his crush and said: “Friends, why are you two here?”

“I am tagging along with the young noble.” Yunyun said.

“I apologize for the lack of reception, I hope you will understand from seeing my circumstances.” He was still polite despite the situation.

“Worms, stand aside.” The tiger monarch said. Though Yunyun was a sovereign, the tiger was comparable to a dragon lord.

“Bladewing Tiger, this is only between you and me!” Goldcrest shouted.

“Hehehe, just hand over the god source and everything will be easy. Otherwise, I’ll kill you and eat your friends. No one can stop me now that the old man is dead.” The tiger laughed.

“Leave, my friends, I cannot even protect myself right now.” Goldcrest smiled wryly and told the two.

“It’s too late for that. Although this is not much of a meal, I suppose you two will be an okay appetizer.” The tiger stared at the two humans and reached for them with his sharp claw.

“Watch it!” Goldcrest bellowed.

“Boom!” Li Qiye easily stopped it.

The scene looked like an ant somehow managing to stop the claw of a dragon.
