Chapter 5409: Sent Flying

This was an unprecedented scene - blocking the immortal pagoda with one’s bare hand.

Everyone understood the consequences of doing so - being obliterated. Moreover, Li Qiye was doing it just like a mortal trying to raise something.

If an apex conqueror were to be so reckless, they would still be exerting their dao and vitality in order to stop the primordial force. As for Li Qiye, he seemed to be holding up a chicken egg devoid of any threat.

“How is he doing this?” A top conqueror murmured in disbelief, aware of the pagoda’s power and the conqueror’s primordial fruit.

“Boom!” The portal became resplendent with a jade-like glow encompassing a gentle power. Out came a flood of primordial power to engulf the battlefield.

This was even worse than the pressure instilled by the pagoda. Everyone felt their knees buckling violently. The fabrics of reality creaked, on the verge of breaking down.

“Damn!” Ancient ancestors and lords couldn’t keep their head up, unable to lift a single finger.

They saw an illusory hand grabbing the pagoda - clearly belonging to a man yet the fingers were long and slender. Not a single blemish could be seen while possessing infinite strength. When closed, they could hold dominion over myriad realms and grasp the lives of all beings.

The pagoda activated with a dazzling radiance. Its power gushed out like a flood after it broke down a dam. The force of countless dragons rushed toward Li Qiye, wanting to tear him to pieces.

All affinities seemed feeble before the primordial might. Time and space collapsed down to the particles.

“Immortal Pagoda Conqueror!” Spectators shouted after seeing the conqueror in action.

Only Li Qiye was unaffected by the primordial force. He slapped the pagoda and sent it back to the portal.

The grotto on the other side couldn’t be seen very clearly. Nonetheless, everyone saw blood splashing from an ethereal figure. Li Qiye had sent the pagoda back with enough speed to injure its master.

With the portal gone and the grotto filled with explosions, the primordial force receded like the tides. Spectators were left slack-jawed.

First, Li Qiye had sent back a world-renowned treasure. Its master had used it to take down numerous mighty foes. Now, Li Qiye easily turned it against its master.

Blocking the pagoda was difficult enough, let alone pulling this off. There was no sign of the conqueror after the destruction of the portal.

“He can’t be human…” An ancient ancestor stood there in a daze as if he had just been slapped unexpectedly. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

What kind of being could do this to an apex conqueror? This scene could only be seen in the wildest dreams. Nonetheless, all of them couldn’t be dreaming the same ridiculous dream.
