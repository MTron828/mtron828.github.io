Colorful Balloons Take Flight

Alas, the activated dao foundation of Longevity couldn’t do anything. After loud detonations, the wheel increased its rotational speed; same with the primal black hole.

“Boom!” A sound akin to a flood breaking the dam came about. Longevity’s power near Everlasting started being sucked in towards the darkness like raging streams.

The black hole absorbed this power and became stronger and stronger, like a beast filling its stomach with a feast.

“How can this be?!” The spectators were scared out of their mind.

Keep in mind that Everlasting was only a kingdom in the system. Its foundation was built upon the foundation of the system. More importantly, its merit laws were based there too, so it was a side-branch of sorts.

In theory, it couldn’t challenge the system because it wasn’t on the same level at all. Even if their True Emperors could create some heaven-defying merit laws, they wouldn’t be able to surpass the Longevity Scripture. After all, Alchemy Immortal was a progenitor. Everlasting would need to produce someone at the same level as well.

Of course, they didn’t have such abilities. Thus, this current development came as a surprise.

“This is not a merit law from Everlasting.” The Untethered’s expression changed as she coldly uttered: “It has exceeded the level of a progenitor in Myriad Lineage, this is at least Imperial Lineage and up.”

People felt a chill after hearing this. There were naturally levels to being a progenitor as well. One from Imperial was certainly stronger than one from Myriad.

Most systems here were created by a home-grown progenitor. Fallen systems like Insane Court were exceptions.

Now, Everlasting had come up with something greater to create this gigantic wheel. One could easily tell that something else was going on behind the curtains.

“Rumble!” Meanwhile, the adsorption process continued.

“Junior, get ready to die along with your valley.” The elder lord spoke.

“Boom!” The rotating black hole shot out a beam of light consisting of black rays twisting together. These rays looked just like drills, capable of destroying everything in front of them.

“Rumble!” At the start of the offense, a monstrous chasm appeared. It was as if Longevity System was being torn apart. All the mountains and valleys in front of the beam turned to ashes, replaced with fissures.

Looking from above, it started from Everlasting and headed straight for Alchemy Hut, leaving an unhealable scar on the ground.

The unlucky sects in its path were destroyed as well without a chance to defend themselves. Not to mention a small sect, even great kingdoms wouldn’t be able to last for long with their barriers.

At this moment, no one doubted this power’s ability to destroy Longevity Valley.

“My god, Everlasting is trying to steal Longevity System’s power.” An ancestor was horrified.

The initiation of the momentum and the attacking of the beam all happened within the blink of an eye.

“Boom!” The beam was aiming straight for Li Qiye.

Numerous mountains outside of Alchemy Hut instantly exploded. This world-destroying power made many ancestors flee in horror.

“It’s here!” The people on the altar naturally felt the most fear. Even the supporters of Everlasting dropped to the ground and turned pale. It looked like Everlasting not only wanted to kill Li Qiye but also to destroy the entire area.

“Now it’s a bit amusing.” Li Qiye was completely nonchalant just like before.

“Boom!” The beam hasn’t arrived yet but its frontal shockwave blew all the stones and sand within a thousand miles flying.

“Come!” Li Qiye shouted and became resplendent. His dao fruit exuded a faint flame. Now it looked as if there was an eternal fire seed within him.

He turned into a fire god, shrouded in this scorching affinity. Before people could react, a shield dropped from the sky to block the incoming beam.

It looked like gold at the start, but it was actually made from fire with ancient runes. These runes encompassed a world of fire all into the shield, making it as tough and shiny as gold.

“Boom!” This fiery shield managed to stop the beam. Of course, it was still being pushed back inch by inch but it was a successful defense.

“What is that?” Mouths dropped to the ground in disbelief.

“Fire God’s Primal Shield!” Even Everlasting Elder Lord stated at the shield in disbelief.

“What?!” Many were shocked to hear this, especially the big shots from the fire race. They immediately stepped forward for a better look.

One firekin ancestor from a powerful system blurted in astonishment: “How, how could he summon this? This is an obscured art of our race!”

The important firekins were in disbelief due to the shield’s significance.

“He’s definitely a human!” One thought he was simply seeing things.

This symbolic power of their race could only be summoned once a firekin reached the apex comprehension of fire.

Alchemy Immortal had done it so far but this wasn’t too surprising since he was a firekin. As a progenitor, it was natural that he could summon the true profundity of his race.

However, the problem here was that a human was doing it. This was simply insane, a disruption of order; common sense didn’t apply to him.

“I see, the progenitor also used the profundity dao of the fire race to refine the system, not only things from Longevity Scripture. Since you have the system’s power, no wonder why you can summon the shield.” The elder lord thought that this was the only plausible possibility. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

The big shots from the fire race felt much better. If a human could summon the ultimate meaning of their race, then there was nothing else to say. It would be a great embarrassment.

“A foolish know-it-all.” Li Qiye only smiled.

Though the shield was being pushed back, he didn’t mind at all.

The truth was that the elder lord guessed wrong. Alchemy Immortal never imprinted his race’s mysteries into his dao land. The reason why Li Qiye could summon the shield was very simple - he had the Myriad Flame.
