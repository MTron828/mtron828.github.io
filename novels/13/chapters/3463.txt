Wu Zhongtian’s current cultivation was expected. Nonetheless, seeing in action was still startling.

After all, Zhongtian was still quite young. Many ancestors in their old age were still in this realm. Thus, his achievements far exceeded his peers. Even the older cultivators paled in comparison.

Nonetheless, he cultivated before Bai Jianchan but the guy was at the sacred level right now. From this, one could see just how incredible Bai Jianchan was - a genius among geniuses.

“Clank!” He actually put away his sword and summoned two different weapons, one in each hand.

They looked quite unique, resembling two long translucent needles. They had indelible dao runes distinguishing them as artifacts or weapons. Otherwise, one might mistake them for being two crystal needles.

The faint, flashing glow coming from them added an ethereal nature. They seemed to be pulsing in and out of existence.

They lacked murderous intent and powerful dao force. However, everyone could tell that they could take their opponents’ lives in the blink of an eye.

“Shadowless Divine Needles.” An ancestor recognized them.

“Those mythical weapons from Yin Yang?” Others took a deep breath.

“Yes, according to the rumors, they’re created from the dao bone of a Shadowless Divine Bee by Ancient Zen Dao Lord, the best at assassination.” Another older expert said.

This dao lord once met a bee lord, an extremely powerful chaos primal beast. The dao lord pursued it several times yet still couldn’t kill it. Later on, Heavenly Sovereign Chan Yang came to help and they were able to slay it at last.

The doa lord used its dao bones to create these two needles - a perfect tool for killing, virtually impossible to escape.

“Rumble!” Wu Zhongtian channeled his yin yang energy into the needles. Their glow pulsed at an increasing pace.

Once they left his hands, they would deliver the fatal blow to the enemy’s chest in the blink of an eye. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Let’s get started.” Li Qiye looked relaxed despite being surrounded by three cultivators, fully showing his contempt.

“Boom!” The lava surged out again and roared like a dragon to the horror of the crowd; its target was Li Qiye.

Anyone else would be reduced to ashes in no time at all due to the temperature. Alas, Li Qiye was unaffected.

The lava immediately condensed on him, forming a thick layer of armor with flames on the surface with the image of a phoenix. One could hear a faint screech as well.

“He really does have a phoenix bloodline.” The experts thought that their prior suspicion was correct.

The other spectators felt the same way.

“Kill him!” The godchild and the first prince didn’t give Li Qiye time to prepare after seeing the lava armor. They leaped towards him like tigers descending from the mountain.

“Raa!” A massive lynx blotted out the sky and tore out space with its unstoppable claws. Its mouth could devour all living beings.

“That’s terrifying.” The spectators felt as if their souls were being targeted by this black lynx, on the verge of being swallowed at any moment.

“Boom!” The first prince sent down his kingdom, crushing everything in its path. He resembled a god in charge of his own domain.

Everything crumbled before the might of the lynx and the kingdom, especially the spatial area around Li Qiye.

“It’s a sure kill!” One spectator said while his legs buckled.

“Break.” Li Qiye laughed before commanding. His armor lava exuded a harrowing torrent of flames, akin to the eruption of a million volcanoes.

Everything started shaking as a result. At this exact moment, Wu Zhongtian made his move. The two needles disappeared from sight before emerging right in front of Li Qiye’s forehead, ready to drill through his skull.

The crowd didn’t have time to gasp, thinking that he was finished.

However, all three attacks still couldn’t contend against the eruption of the lava armor.

“Boom!” A deafening explosion blinded everyone. Once they could see again, they saw the trio being blown away.

The domain broke down; the sword was sent to the horizon.

“Look at the needles! It’s just like the legend, so deadly!” Meanwhile, some were focused on the needles.

“No.” A keen observer noticed that the lava still managed to stop the needles from penetrating Li Qiye’s forehead.

The heat from the lava could burn anything. The needles actually melted into liquid dripping into the ground.

“How can artifacts refined by a dao lord be melted... this has to be phoenix fire...” People took a deep breath. Power types of true flames wouldn’t be able to do so.

“Ugh...” All three opponents vomited blood and smashed into a mountain.

They were grievously wounded. Standing up again made them vomit blood again due to their chaotic internal vitality.

People couldn’t believe it. That combination attack was insanely powerful and Li Qiye should have died. The opposite actually occurred.

“So this is the power of a phoenix?” One spectator stared at the lava armor.
