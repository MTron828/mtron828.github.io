Chapter 4077: Battle Soon

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Ever since Starshooter Prince got here, he never hid his murderous intention against Li Qiye. Their feud had reached an irreconcilable level.

“Oh, forgetting the pain after the scar is gone?” Li Qiye said: “Looks like the previous beating wasn’t enough. Your kingdom must have some really good ointments to heal you so fast but that’s okay, I’ll beat you again and see if the ointments will work a second time.”

Li Qiye poured salt on the prince’s wounds again in public. He obviously hasn’t forgotten the humiliation last time so this only added to his rage.Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Li, today will be your last day!” He exclaimed while gritting his teeth: “Not even an immortal can save you from me!”

“Who’s gonna kill me? You?” Li Qiye seemed amused.

“You’ll find out soon enough.” He blew on a war horn.

“Rumble!” Another cavalry suddenly emerged on the horizon and soared over like a steel dragon. Their march issued loud explosions that intimidate the crowd. The members covered in steel were ready for blood.

“Starshooter Kingdom’s royal cavalry.” Many took a deep breath after seeing this.

Starshooter Prince clearly came prepared this time around. He cupped his fist towards Eight-armed Prince and said: “I am here to aid you, Brother. We shall get rid of this villain together.”

It was actually improper for another army to appear without notice in another sect’s territory. However, Starshooter Prince stated his intention which made it acceptable.

“Thank you for your help.” Eight-armed Prince accepted.

Two separate armies waited outside the plain - a truly magnificent scene. They surrounded the area and trapped Li Qiye like a turtle in a jar.

“Li Qiye is probably not getting away this time.” Many weren’t optimistic about Li Qiye’s chances since he was facing three geniuses and two armies.

“Li, your offenses are unforgivable.” Hundred-blade Noble said: “Hand over the plain and surrender yourself to Sea Emperor and Armament right now and we might think about sparing your life.”

Hundred-blade Noble who had the highest status here spoke with confidence and conviction. Others shuddered after hearing him and were certain that he was the strongest out of the three.

“Wow, how cool.” Someone clapped and laughed loudly: “That’s a disciple of Sea Emperor for you, so inspiring and intimidating.”

The sarcasm was rather obvious. The crowd wondered who was bold enough to provoke the kingdom.

They saw a youth wearing a slightly dirty robe with a wine gourd hanging by the waist - clearly a lover of alcohol. Nonetheless, his sharp and bright features were similar to his unrestrained temperament.

“Dong Ling!” Many recognized him despite his lack of fame compared to Hundred-blade Noble’s group.

“Another sword prodigy?” They were surprised to see him here.

“What’s the date? Why are there so many of them here?” Another commented.

Normally, it wasn’t easy seeing these prodigies around but one appeared after another today.

“Brother Dong Ling, you want to wade through this muddled water?” Hundred-blade Noble scowled.

“I’m just a little annoyed at what I’m seeing, that’s all. Plus, Young Noble Li doesn’t need my help but if you want to fight, I’ll entertain you.” Dong Ling smiled.

His direct response prompted the crowd to think.

“This guy is audacious, I can’t believe he called out Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom.” A cultivator whispered.

“He’s one of the ten for a reason.” Another responded: “He’s qualified to fight Hundred-blade Noble.”

“Another day.” Hundred-blade Noble coldly responded.

Dong Ling then smiled at Li Qiye and asked: “Young Noble, do you require my assistance? I heard that you made a fortune recently so I don’t mind being rewarded with a few coins to buy more wine. I can be your errand boy.”

“No rush, you’ll have a chance later.” Li Qiye replied.

Dong Ling shrugged then told the trio: “Looks like I don’t have a spot here. That’s fine, continue on, I’ll just enjoy the show.” He then moved to the side, looking quite entertained.

The spotlight returned to Li Qiye and the trio.

“Li Qiye, this is your last warning.” Hundred-blade Noble glared at Li Qiye.

“Enough, leave now and keep your lives. Otherwise, come faster because my afternoon nap is coming.” Li Qiye yawned and said.

The trio was furious since they have never been treated in this manner before.

“No one can tolerate such disrespect outside of cowardly turtles hiding in their shells.” Dong Ling laughed and shouted.

This served to further infuriate the trio but they didn’t have time to deal with him right now.

“Li, come out and fight us!” Starshooter Prince shouted.

“It wouldn’t be a fight.” Li Qiye swatted his hand as if he was trying to chase away a fly: “I’m getting tired of this. Come with your armies or just leave already.”

“Young Lord, we will cut him to pieces.” Both cavalries were furious and begged to fight.

“Since you’re so confident, I’m sure you won’t mind taking all of us on then.” Hundred-blade Noble calmly stated.

“Yes, yes, however many you want.” Li Qiye gestured provocatively.

The trio exchanged glances before nodding.

“Men, get ready, we are taking back the plain!” Eight-armed Prince commanded.

“We’re starting. It’s time to obliterate the enemy!” Starshooter Prince shouted.

Metallic clanks echoed across the region right away as members of the armies unsheathed their weapons.
