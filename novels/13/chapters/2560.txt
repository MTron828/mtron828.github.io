Nine-linked Mountains wasn’t as famous as the five great powers, but it was unfathomable. Even Lucidity King acted with prudence when dealing with this sect.

This promise of the woodcutter was a big deal. For millions of years, the sect has been acting in isolation, never stepping into the rest of the world.

“Go now.” Li Qiye accepted the promise and said.

The old man bowed again before quietly leaving. Though he was powerful and same with his sect, he knew that their power was ephemeral like the moon in the water or the morning dew on the flowers.

No matter how strong they may be, they were still only ants before Li Qiye. He could destroy them with a single thought.

Thus, it was their honor to pledge this oath of loyalty. They were the ones reaching up above their station.

Li Qiye didn’t linger in Nine-linked Mountains after the battle. He chose to return to Skywrap City instead.

The small group consisted of Ill Lord and his peers along with Liu Chuqing and Bingchi Hanyu. Despite the few numbers, the spectators were still shocked to see them.

To have followers as powerful as Ill Lords? No one else in the world could enjoy this entourage, not even Lucidity King back then.

The group traveled at a fair speed, riding their carriages in the sky towards Skywrap.

However, wherever they went, the sects and clans along with all the inhabitants came out to show their respect.

In fact, even before he got to a city, the disciples from various powers have already lined up to the left and right of the path.

“Greetings, Your Majesty.” When his carriage appeared on the horizon, these disciples prostrated and shouted in unison.

While the carriage was moving through the path, these disciples didn’t dare to look up at Li Qiye. They continued kneeling until the carriage disappeared.

This happened multiple times along the path from Nine-linked Mountains till Skywrap. These cities and capitals were meticulous and attentive out of fear. They didn’t wish to make the king unhappy lest he destroys their sects.

It was a magnificent and domineering spectacle, befitting a tyrant like him.

In the present, he didn’t need to say anything and could still threaten everyone, forcing them down on the ground.

“Greetings, Your Majesty.” Once his carriage stopped outside of Skywrap, the city was filled with kneeling citizens.

The troops from the Imperial Guards and the other legions have taken off their armors; their undershirt drenched with sweat.

Today seemed like a nightmare to them, perhaps their final day in this world.

All the legions have participated in the rebellion previously and sieged the city, wanting Tang Hexiang to take the reign. Who would have thought that this king they have chased away would return triumphantly today?

The only thing they could do right now was kneeling on the ground, awaiting judgment. None of them dared to think about rebellion or risking it all.

The Central Legion has been made an example. Supreme ancestors have died without a burial. They were nothing in comparison. Resisting would only end with their death, a complete massacre.

It was better to admit their crimes and wait for the punishment. Perhaps the king would show mercy and spare their lives. Perhaps a few generals would be executed, but at least the majority of the soldiers would be spared.

Li Qiye didn’t bother to look at the massive crowd, still acting as nonchalant as ever.

He stared at the splendorous gate and smiled: “Not bad cleaning up the imperial city so quickly, even the broken walls are fixed.”

The crowd shuddered after hearing this. The ones who attacked the city back then were nervously trembling.

Numerous walls collapsed on that day and the city fell into chaos which people took advantage of. They stole treasures and anything worthwhile in the city and even the imperial palace.

Today, the walls looked perfect. The palace remained dazzling as always. All of the stolen items have been returned.

He didn’t need to give an order. Everyone was scared out of their mind and hastily fixed everything at the capital. The frightened thieves also gave everything back. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The entire system lived under a state of nervousness since His Majesty’s wrath could end with carnage and destruction.

That’s why when he brought up the rebellion, the ones present felt their soul leaving their body. Heads might roll on the ground, but they were afraid of dragging their families and sects into this mess.

Of course, Li Qiye didn’t pursue these trivial crimes. It was only a casual comment.

The group entered the palace. It looked the same as before - majestic and luxurious. All of the servants and maids were waiting as well.

In fact, the place was filled with gold and jade, even more extravagant than back during Lucidity King’s reign. Li Qiye only smiled and paid no mind.

The return of the king should be a cause for celebration in the entire system, especially in Skywrap. The streets should be decorated with lanterns and colored banners, but strangely enough, all the cities seemed especially serene.

No one dared to act on their own volition without his orders, not even to celebrate. That’s why instead of a joyous banquet and drowning in wine and meat, the citizens felt as if they were treading on thin ice.

After several days of his return, the dismissed Zhang Jiadi also came back.

“Your Majesty.” Jiadi immediately prostrated after seeing Li Qiye: “Your servant was worthless and couldn’t stay around to serve you, please punish me.”

“Long time no see, you may rise. I pardon you.” Li Qiye chuckled.

Jiadi remained on his knees.

“You got something to say?” Li Qiye didn’t bother asking where he went. His leisure demeanor seemed to say that he already knew everything.

“Your servant came back this time for two reasons. First is to humbly beg for forgiveness, the second is to ask for permission to retire.”

“Retire?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Your Majesty, I was incapable and shameless, unable to stay with you to the end. That’s why I’m asking for permission to retire. If this isn’t possible, please demote me back to being a foot soldier.” Jiadi quietly said.

“Incapable and shameless? Incorrect.” Li Qiye said: “You have shown great loyalty staying with me until the last day, a meritorious and commendable act. You are both an accomplished and loyal official, so those words do not describe you.”
