Chapter 4303: Old Acquaintance?

The old man saw Li Qiye and astonishment struck him like a lightning bolt. His eyes brimmed with a bright flash, albeit only for a split second - virtually unnoticeable.

He staggered backward, unable to stay calm.

Of course, Wang Weiqiao and the other disciples didn’t notice this at all. Li Qiye was the only one privy to the minute changes.

He took a deep breath and calmed down, finally meeting Li Qiye’s gaze.

“So we meet again.” Serenity returned to his eyes. After all, the past was so long ago now; there was no point in holding a grudge.

Li Qiye wasn’t overly surprised to see him: “You being alive is nothing short of a miracle.”

He remained silent for a bit before answering: “The sky shattered and the earth collapsed. My return was due to fate.”

“Fate?” Li Qiye chuckled in disagreement: “Do you actually think that you’re alive right now thanks to fate?”

“If you think you’ve done me a favor, I didn’t ask for it.” He said.

“That’s exactly what happened. This world was built and ruled by me and you’re growing on it, so isn’t it due to my grace that you’re still alive?” Li Qiye smiled.

He had no choice but to admit: “Correct, but all you did was given an unsolicited gift. I owe you nothing, it’s due to my own fortune.”

The others had no idea what was going on in this conversation. They attributed this to Li Qiye’s eccentric nature and decided to stay quiet.

“There is logic and truth in what you’re saying. Without my gift, your achievements could have been even greater, still standing out at the apex.” Li Qiye nodded.

He didn’t say anything.

“I suppose you don’t owe me anything, but, you do owe him, got it? You have always owed him and still owe him. This isn’t only because of his love and expectation for you.” Li Qiye stared at him.

He took a deep breath and let it out before nodding: “You are correct, I don’t owe you but I do owe him.”

“Then shouldn’t you be doing something?” Li Qiye asked.

“The world has you, I don’t need to do anything since you can do a better job.” He responded.

“What if it needs you? And why does it have to be me? Haven’t you thought about doing something for him?” Li Qiye asked.

He fell into silence.

“There can never be enough praise for your innate talent. Do you know what makes us different?” Li Qiye continued.

“Me.” He eventually answered in a sentimental manner.

“Your desire drives and imprisons you.” Li Qiye said: “Now, you get a redo. Will you be a slave to it again?”

“It is rather difficult. I am still me, nothing has changed.” He clenched his fists and sighed.

“Don’t do it for you or me or anyone else, do it for him. It is that simple, pay the debt.” Li Qiye concluded.

He eventually loosened his fists and accepted this: “Right, it’s been long enough, I should repay the debt.”

Li Qiye smiled and stopped talking about this issue. He looked at the stall and said: “Decent items.”

“Want to buy? They’re all ancient artifacts from the forbidden zones. Each has its own uses and profundities.” The old man reverted to his current state.

“Really?” The disciples were glad that the confusing conversation was over and took a look at the few items.

They looked old and rusty, not much different from scrap metals.

“See if there’s anything you like.” The old man looked particularly attentive to Wang Weiqiao and said: “Little Brother, come, one might be right for you.”

The two were similar in age and appearance yet he called Wang Weiqiao “little brother”. This could be construed as impoliteness.

They took a look at the items. Alas, nothing seemed worthwhile.

“Hey, are they really from the forbidden zones?” One disciple murmured, thinking that the old man was unreliable. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

After all, these zones were extremely dangerous. The treasures from there should have incredible visual phenomena - immortal lights or clouds… The ones here seemed to be on the opposite end of the spectrum.

“Those connected by fate should be able to see the mysteries.” The old man smiled and didn’t overly peddle.

As for Li Qiye, he only spectated without interfering.

“How about this?” Wang Weiqiao found something looking like a tiny hatchet, no longer in a usable state.

“If you think it’s good, it’s good.” Li Qiye smiled.

“How much is it?” Wang Weiqiao liked it and thought that it was somehow meant to be with him.

“I’ll give you a friendly price, three million sovereign jades.” The old man raised three fingers.

“What?!” The other disciples became startled. Weiqiao himself put the item back on the stall.

“That’s a friendly price?” One of them complained.

This was a monstrous sum to them. In fact, selling the entire sect wouldn’t yield this sum.

“It’s too expensive.” Weiqiao smiled wryly and shook his head. He didn’t even have 30,000 Bronze Tendon Refined Jades, let alone the sovereign level.

“It is fate that we meet today, I’ll reduce it to three hundred bronze tendon jades.” The old man said.

“...” The sudden drop in price surprised Weiqiao. The old man sounded like a swindler.

“Boss, what are you trying to do here with these prices? I don’t think this item is even worth three hundred bronze tendon jades.” One disciple said: “It is worth one hundred at best, don’t take advantage of our nice senior brother.”

The old man only smiled and didn’t refute.

“What do you think, Master?” Weiqiao liked the item but still found this whole thing strange.

“That depends on you. If the thing is actually worth the initial price, he’s selling you a favor.” Li Qiye said.

“A favor.” Weiqiao carefully thought about it.

“Do you want it, Little Brother? If so, just three hundred.” The old man said.
