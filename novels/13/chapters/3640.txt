Chapter 3641: Hug Mouse

“Really now?” She didn’t think that this was written down in the books.

“You tell me.” He smiled.

“Then tell me who met it, Young Master.” She said with skepticism.

“Trying to test me? Do you know who it is?” Li Qiye replied.

“Well... I, I don’t know the specifics, just that this student eventually became a big shot, a really important big shot.” She smiled wryly.

“A big shot indeed, even for the standard of the academy.” Li Qiye nodded.

“So you actually know? Tell me which student it was then.” Her eyes lit up, finally believing him.

Yang Ling’s curiosity was understandable. Meeting this mythical mouse meant obtaining a great fortune.

No one knew where it came from, only that it has been around since the foundation of Wish Ward or even earlier. It’s just that in the past, fewer managed to see it.

Strangely enough, this mouse could only be found in the main branch, not the other places. No one knew what it looked like either. Nonetheless, earning its grace meant soaring upward.

This wasn’t a legend or a fake story either. Numerous characters in history have done so. Alas, they kept their mouth shut regarding the details.

This made Wish Ward more popular. People wanted to test their luck here as well.

Li Qiye only smiled and didn’t answer her question.

“Young Master, Young Master, please, just tell me...” She started pulling on his arm and didn’t give up.

“You really want to know?” He glanced at her.

“Of course I do, just tell me already...” Yang Ling nodded repeatedly like a chicken eating grain while anxiously staring at Li Qiye.

“Five-colored Sacred Sovereign.” Li Qiye nonchalantly revealed.

“Five-colored Sacred-!” She shouted but immediately calmed down and covered her mouth. She looked around and noticed that no one heard them.

“Rea-really? The dean is the one?” She quietly murmured, not expecting this answer.

Li Qiye nodded.

She stood there in a daze. So the favored student back then was now the dean of Duality.

“How come the dean never talked about this?” She asked.

In the holy ground, people only knew that a student was chosen a very long time ago. No one knew anything about the specific nor did they try to find out.

“No wonder why he became one of the four grandmasters. So the mouse liked him.” Yang Ling murmured.

“Silly girl, what are you saying?” Li Qiye gently knocked her head and said: “He became a grandmaster due to his power and intelligence, the mouse thing was just adding flowers on a fine brocade. In short, he won this fortune because he was brilliant enough to have this fateful opportunity. Everyone thinks that fortune is the reason for success, that some dao lords and sovereigns were merely lucky, and if they were to have the same luck, they would become powerful dao lords too. This is a foolish notion.” nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

Yang Ling listened attentively. Though Li Qiye was only casually speaking, she still took it very seriously and memorized his guidance.

This was indeed the case. Many young cultivators thought that they only lacked luck to become dao lords.

In reality, these powerful cultivators found success for different reasons. Fortunes and luck only added to it.

Without these things, they would still become big shots in due time. It would just take longer.

“I think that makes sense.” She eventually nodded in agreement.

“Yes, otherwise, the descendants of these dao lords and sovereigns would become invincible masters too.” Li Qiye said.

“Right.” She agreed.

In history, how many children of dao lords and sovereigns managed to actually reach the same height? The answer was very few.

They had all the advantages available, from resources to access to fortunes. This wasn’t enough.

Yang Ling thought about the previous matter again and inquired once more: “Young Master, how come the dean doesn’t talk about the mouse?”

Being favored by the mouse was an auspicious matter - a symbol of luck. That’s why she found it strange that the dean never talked about it.

“He certainly has his reason. You’ll understand when you have this fortune.” Li Qiye smiled and entered the busy street again.

“What do you mean?” She gave chase but Li Qiye stopped answering.

There were thousands and thousands of stores in this branch - weapons, manuals, beasts...

That’s why as long as one had enough money, they would be able to buy anything here.

There were also smaller merchants and peddlers operating on the streets. Plus, anyone who wanted to sell their stuff was around to set up a stand as well.

Wish Ward didn’t prevent people from selling stuff. There was only one rule - no swindling. Thus, Wish Ward had a strong reputation and buyers truly trusted the products found here.

Due to the number of stores, a month still wasn’t enough to see the entire ward.

Though this wasn’t Yang Ling’s first time, she still loved looking at the stores. She saw items that made her heart beat faster. Unfortunately, she touched her pocket and had to give up.

As a princess, she certainly had more money than regular students. Unfortunately, she wasn’t allowed to squander.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye only looked around and didn’t care for much.

“Young Master, what are you looking for?” Yang Ling asked after they have passed by several top stores known for selling top-rate materials.

“Some ores and metals.” Li Qiye answered.

Yang Ling didn’t need to ask anymore to know that Li Qiye was looking for something outrageous. Otherwise, those stores earlier would have been enough to fulfill his requirements.
