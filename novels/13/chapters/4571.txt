Chapter 4572: Timeless Melody

“Buzz.” He then opened the pouch and released a blinding radiance. These were true immortal rays. The so-called “immortal rays” were used incorrectly by frogs under the well.

Not a hint of impurities could be seen. They seemed to be eternal and have been there since the very start. Time didn’t change them at all and this would be the case later in the future as well.

They gave everyone an insight into the scene during the initial inception of the world or the final destruction of the present. Everything else seemed ephemeral in comparison.

Through these true immortal rays, one could see the past and future. Nothing else mattered but them. Eternal and indestructible - the properties of these immortal rays.

Both juniors and ancestors were instantly suppressed without any chance of resisting. In fact, even the will to resist was crushed.

The rays illuminated Li Qiye and he suddenly disappeared from sight.

In a world of absolute stillness, nothing existed, only the void. Time, space, and the other dao affinities were absent.

Suddenly, a drop of water appeared with the reflection of a figure inside. “Pop!” The figure came out and it was none other than Li Qiye.

He didn’t bother scouting the area; his target was already in front of him - a shimmering glow.

Within was an indiscernible figure. It could be a man or a woman, pretty or ugly, regular form or possessing three heads and six arms…

It was impossible to tell the actual appearance of this figure through the pulsing radiance. The figure seemed to be meditating with something resembling a zither placed on the knees.

Since there was no temporal affinity, this figure could sit here for an eternity without changing.

After seeing Li Qiye, the figure nodded and started playing plucking the strings.

Instead of a zither note, what came out were the sounds and runes of the grand dao.

“Clank!” The runes served as the foundation of a new world. It included bright expanses, heavenly treasures, and other living beings.

The diversity in species was great. They also followed different affinities - light, darkness, or neutrality…

“Clank!” With another note, three thousand worlds appeared along with a reincarnation cycle and predetermined fates. The process of life and death continued.

As time passed, living beings were able to reach the apex and learn the heavenly dao. Love and hatred were plentiful; flourishing worlds were in abundance. Countless moving songs and poems were written.

Fate came and went in the three thousand worlds; numerous Heaven’s Will were created. The worlds diverged from their original form and eventually, the void returned again and life disappeared.

The dao runes created from the zither continued to derive this endless cycle. There was one constant - a relentless pursuit for immortality only to end in failure.

Mighty cultivators experienced the sadness of death, not in themselves but from seeing their loved ones dying and turning into dust. In the end, only one remained standing. This loneliness turned into apathy and mercilessness.

These beings then devoured the worlds and everything within, viewing them as nothing more than food to be gorged.

They were wise once with supreme wisdom and insight. Alas, they turned into monsters that have nothing to do with light or darkness. Only one thing was on their mind - the feast. This allowed them to live longer and devour more cycles.

This was the price of immortality unbeknown to regular living beings. The latter lived happily and fulfilled their desires. Some thought that they have obtained the peerless dao and eternal truths. Ultimately, this was ephemeral for being devoured was inevitable.

The price for immortality was everything else. Moreover, this was only the beginning…

Li Qiye smiled and turned into the Dark Crow. He spread his wings and everything beneath lived prosperously under his shadow. Meanwhile, he looked upward and arduously searched for means to fight the heaven - a quest possible only due to his indomitable dao heart.

The crowd was at a loss after seeing the immortal ray. It only lasted for a split second yet contained an eternity within. Gẹtt the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐v𝒆ls at 𝒏.o/(v)/e/l/bi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Buzz.” It was then extinguished, not gradually dispersed.

They looked around again and everything seemed to be normal. Everlasting Monarch stood there and the scented pouch was still hanging from his belt. As for Li Qiye, he was still next to the group.

People questioned whether they were only seeing things, that it didn’t actually happen.

“What is going on?” Even the calmest ancient ancestor had no explanation for this.

Some ancestors started rubbing their eyes in confusion.

“Did you notice something earlier?” Everyone started asking those nearby.

Some then stared at Li Qiye but he had an indifferent expression.
