Chapter 1170: Fate Of The Peacock Tree

Kong Qinru pondered Li Qiye’s words. Setting other matters aside, she didn’t really know him. Plus, he was not someone from the Heaven Spirit World, so why should he replenish the treefather’s life?

Li Qiye continued on with a smile: “There are too many injustices in this world; too many powerless thoughts; too many things that people don’t want to do. Even a savior cannot save everyone in this world or satisfy all of their prayers. Moreover, I am not a savior or a charitable person.”

She asked: “How do we replenish its life?”

Li Qiye shook his head and said: “It is useless even if you know because only I can do it. Plus, the price is not small.”

She took a deep breath and solemnly asked him: “What can convince you to replenish its life?”

He smilingly shook his head: “Little girl, you can’t offer what I want.”

She breathed deeply once more before offering: “If you are willing to do so and if it is a success, you can have whatever you want, including marrying me and having a great position in the Exquisite Valley!”

Her eyes directly met his gaze in a natural manner with great persistence and earnestness.

He noticed her stare and laughed: “I’m not looking down on you, but I need to make things clear. Let’s not talk about treasures, just the proposed marriage and entrance to the Exquisite Valley alone...

“... You are thinking too highly of yourself. First of all, I have an imperial bloodline; countless women in this world want to be my dao companion. For example, the little brat from Golden Isle. Which aspects do you have that are better than her? Beauty, intelligence, sexiness, or maybe talents?

“... Now take a step back and pretend that I don’t have an imperial bloodline. Marrying you would be my loss. It would be you taking advantage of me, not the other way around. The truth is always grating to the ears, but you are not qualified to be my wife.” He concluded with a smile.

Such words left Kong Qinru speechless. As the Exquisite Valley Master, she wasn’t only enchantingly beautiful, she also possessed an excellent bloodline. Countless others at the Heaven Spirit World wanted to marry her. As long as she gave the okay, even the descendant of the most powerful sect would be willing to do so.

But now, this ordinary person that couldn’t be more ordinary considered these things that she had been so proud of as things not worth mentioning.

Her demeanor eventually dimmed as she helplessly said: “I have overestimated myself. You are right, how can it be that easy to replenish a treefather’s life. The price must be too great.”

“You misunderstood me.” He smiled and said: “It is not that I want something outrageous, it’s just that the process itself is costly.”

She didn’t know what to say for this was beyond the scope of her abilities. It was just that Li Qiye gave her hope just now.

Li Qiye continued: “Why are you so insistent on this? In fact, this doesn’t affect you too much and, to be frank, if Peacock Land ceases to exist, it would make the Exquisite Valley even more precious, don’t you think?”

She looked into his eyes and said: “True, this has no effect on the valley, but it is a different story for the inhabitants here. Without their home, they would no longer have a place in this world.”

“For many people, there were only two places at the Heaven Spirit World; the mainland of the Exquisite Valley and Peacock Land. Without one of them, it will be one less home for the human race and half of their hope will be extinguished. Moreover, countless creatures would perish with the withering of the treefather.” She sighed helplessly at this point.

This was not to say that she was overly humane and kind or someone who was too weak to accept death. It was because, as the Exquisite Valley Lord, the most influential person of the human race, she wanted to work for the welfare of her race. She wished for peace and hope for the rest of her kin.

“Life and death are part of nature.” Li Qiye faintly smiled: “After millions of years, how many people have died in wars? And how many people are currently living in Peacock Land? I’m sure this number is less than one-tenth the number of people who will die in a battle for the Heaven’s Will. Even if this place collapses, it is insignificant for the human race in the grand scheme of things.”

“I know that.” She answered: “But it is another beacon of hope for the humans here.”

“Hope?” He was amused by this notion: “This hope is a cause of death, the death of their future, the death of their descendants. Because Peacock Land and Exquisite Valley are there, more humans will decide to stay at the Heaven Spirit World. Without these two, this amount would be quite negligible.”

She contemplated for a moment before replying: “Maybe you are right, my vision is quite short-sighted. I only want to do a few things for the future generations. A little glimmer of hope is the only thing I can offer to our kind here, the hope of a peaceful and happy life.”

Li Qiye looked at her in silence for a while before gently shaking his head: “Little girl, this world is not meant for a peaceful and happy life, at least, not for humans. One day, you will understand why it is not their home, but maybe you won’t be able to wait until that time.”

Kong Qinru replied: “So what if you are right? For experts and real heaven-defying existences, they can leave the moment the nine worlds are connected again. But what about the others? What about the mortals? Even if they wanted to leave, there is nothing they can do.”

Li Qiye flatly answered: “Like I said before, if you’re really thinking for the sake of the human race, the wisest thing to do is to prepare to move the Exquisite Valley out of the Heaven Spirit World. The nine worlds are vast, there will be a new foothold for you somewhere.”

She weakly said: “Maybe, but even if I wanted to, it won’t be that easy. Three-meter deep snow isn’t formed overnight.” [1. Rome wasn’t built in a day is the equivalent idiom.]

Eventually, Li Qiye shook his head and commented: “It seems that I have grown old. I am not a soft-hearted person, my will is made of steel. However, one’s heart will soften with time.”

After hearing this, Kong Qinru was slightly surprised. After calming down, she happily blurted: “You mean...”

He glanced at her and insipidly said: “Since I’m already here, so be it. I suppose I have to give it a try. As for the fate of the human race in this world, I’ll have to leave it to them and you.”

She couldn’t believe her own ears and took a deep breath to confirm: “Are, are you serious?”

“Do I need to lie to you?” He answered: “However, you need to be mentally prepared. Defying the heavens to achieve life replenishment is not easy. The price will be quite heavy!”

She solemnly responded while bracing herself: “What do you need? As long as it is within our valley’s capabilities, I will definitely get it for you.”

He shook his head: “The price I’m referring to isn’t treasures or spirit pills or even alchemy ingredients. In short, it isn’t something you or your valley can afford.”

“Umm...” She was at a loss for words.

He waved his sleeve dismissively: “Such an exchange is required at times. There’s no need to think about it any further. As for some other items that I require, you will be responsible for them.”

She nodded with great austerity: “Rest assured, just let me know whatever you need. I will not let you down!”

A fire of hope was ignited within her. If the Peacock Tree could live longer, the other resting place of the human race would continue to exist. With this home, people would continue to have hope. Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

He didn’t say anything else and opened his fate palace. An old tree emerged. There were several green branches growing from it with fresh leaves swaying in the breeze.

Kong Qinru didn’t know what this old tree was, but she felt that this inconspicuous-looking tree was not so simple.

It wasn’t strange that she didn’t know about it; it wasn’t due to a lack of knowledge on her part. In fact, outside of Li Qiye’s group, those who had seen this tree simply didn’t exist. The world had forgotten its name, let alone recognizing its appearance.

At this time, the green branches of the Myriad Age Tree slowly stretched out like tiny serpents. They drilled into the Peacock Tree in an instant.
