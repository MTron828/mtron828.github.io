Chapter 4385: Pill-keeper Luan

A screech resembling that of a phoenix penetrated the eardrums in a frightening manner. A blinding radiance flashed akin to the birth of a primordial star. The individual rays seemed to be solid and capable of piercing through all darkness.

Next came an erupting inferno. A red pill could be seen inside with the same color glow, seemingly containing the essences of countless suns.

The power of the pill swept in all four directions - completely unstoppable - and forced numerous disciples backward.

The luan behind her spread its wings and blotted out the sky. Its divinity made all the demons tremble and want to prostrate. This was an instinctive fear before a superior bloodline.

“Boom!” She raised her finger and commanded the pill to shoot forward. It was only the size of a pigeon egg yet it made the ground tremble. It wielded the power of numerous suns. The flames coming from it could ravage the entire region.

The crowd couldn’t believe it. How could such a mighty move be performed by the young girl?

“Wild Flurry!” Bear King didn’t expect her to be this powerful and swung his spade to erect countless layers of mountains in front of him.

This defense was his best and prevented anyone from taking half a step forward. Alas, the tiny pill simply had too much power despite its small size.

The immensity of the suns smashed into the mountains and pierced through them. Cracks emanated from this hole before a total collapse.

“Bam!” Pieces were scattered everywhere in a magnificent manner. The defense stopped the brunt of the attack but the shock waves continued onward.

He formed several seals afterward but they broke through and sent him flying. He smashed into the ground and created a large crater.

This time around, he was seriously wounded despite having a tough frame. Blood could be seen all over. This second defeat made it clear who was stronger between the two.

He was only at the first level while she was already at the second. The difference of one dao, in this case, was insurmountable.

The scene became quiet; the usual commenters kept their mouth shut. A senior had just lost to her so the young ones couldn’t criticize her.

“She won.” An expert murmured. In reality, this was rather obvious the moment she showed off her two dao.

They just didn’t expect Bear King to lose so quickly. She absolutely crushed him with that exchange.

“She’ll be the pillar of the Jian in the future.” A great demon became sentimental. Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

“Unfortunately, she’s too stubborn. What a shame.” Another from Phoenix Ground replied.

Although they came to capture her, they had no intention of escalating the issue. The Jian has ruled for a long time now and the sentimental ties were still present.

Some demons who weren’t from the clan didn’t harbor deep resentment. However, they didn’t dare to show favoritism because of the sect’s rules.

“Yes, her talent and personality are just like her father’s.” Another nodded: “She would have had a chance to become the next sect master if it wasn’t for this.”

In the past, numerous top demons and ancestors from Phoenix Ground had high hopes for her. They found her to have great potential, going as far as becoming the next sect master or at least becoming a demon monarch like her father.

Alas, her relationship with Li Qiye created a rift between her and the sect. They thought that this was truly regrettable.

“Boom!” Suddenly, debris went flying and a figure rushed out.

“Watch out!” Jian Qingzhu shouted instinctively.

The figure was none other than Bear King who seemed rather lively as he lunged for Li Qiye.

It could be his speed or Li Qiye’s lack of reaction. All in all, he had a firm grip on Li Qiye’s neck.

The crowd didn’t expect this at all since he was wounded. He ignored them and his status, resorting to a sneak attack.

“Junior, I will have your head no matter what in order to avenge my fallen disciple!” He laughed maniacally. His face was twisted with anger and ferocity.

“Halt, Bear King, or I will not show mercy!” She roared.

“Little girl, you might be stronger than me but you won’t be able to save him today.” Bear King abandoned everything in order to kill Li Qiye.

“Stop, Bear King, this will harm Phoenix Ground’s reputation.” The monkey king shook his head and disagreed.

Everyone sympathized with him wanting to avenge his disciple. However, he was a great demon of Phoenix Ground and Dragon.

They considered themselves an orthodox and righteous sect. A senior sneak-attacking in this manner would incite disdain and criticism.

It was fine for him to challenge Li Qiye to a duel. Of course, he would be considered a bully but this was far worse.
