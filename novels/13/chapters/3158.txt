“As you wish.” The dragon smiled and opened its mouth, releasing more draconic energy.

“Rumble!” This energy manifested into a terrible storm. Just this power alone should be enough to sweep through the realms uncontested.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The master had laws around him for protection. Next came a full set of golden armors.

The two layers stopped the incoming draconic storm.

“Not bad.” The dragon said before recalling its aura and choosing to attack with its claw.

A sharp flash occurred as the claw tore apart space itself. It could tear through the earth like a piece of paper.

“Boom!” The master’s laws broke down so he quickly retreated.

Alas, the claw still made contact with his armor plates. Though it was made from precious divine metals at the progenitorial level, five deep marks were still left. The claw of a true dragon was just too much.

“Do you see now? A true dragon’s physical prowess. Each scale and claw are wondrous weapons.” The dragon claimed.

The spectators took a deep breath. No wonder why Coiling Dragon tried so hard to obtain a purer bloodline. The physical prowess of this divine being was unreasonable. Its claw was comparable to any progenitorial weapon.

Luminous Master summoned his Skysplitter again.

This time around, it looked relatively tiny compared to the great dragon, almost like a serpent.

“Not a bad hatchet at all.” The dragon praised.

“Let’s go!” The master immediately swung his hatchet downward in a violent manner.

Its sheer size could sever heaven and earth. He added speed on top of power, swinging it a thousand times in the blink of an eye.

The raw power was something else. All of Immortal Lineage felt like a tiny boat out in the ocean during a storm. Just one swing alone could separate it into two halves.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” A ferocious torrent of steel struck the dragon.

However, fiery sparks shot off the scales of the dragon but this wasn’t enough to leave behind any real damage.

On the other hand, the claws of the dragon left actual dings on the snow-white blade of the hatchet.

The spectators naturally gasped in response. The hatchet was clearly inferior to the dragon’s body.

“This true dragon is insane, no need for any weapon!” This was the first time witnessing a true dragon in action for many people.

“Boom!” At the same time, the dark beams have focused on one target - the broken brick that the first wave managed to get through.

However, there was a new brick there now and the hole was no longer present. The beams couldn’t destroy it right away. Nonetheless, they successfully broke down the energy barriers in front of the wall.

“It’s working.” Tai Yinxi was more nervous than anyone else. He clenched his fists tightly; his heart was hanging on a thread.

As time went on, he gained confidence that the hole was successfully fixed.

“Use the dark drill.” A voice inside the dark legion commanded.

“Creak-” A large ship moved forward. It looked like the commanding ship of this legion.

The bottom hull opened to release a mighty drill - black from top to bottom just like a black diamond. It had a beautiful dark luster akin to the stars at night.

This diamond was extremely fine; its darkness felt overwhelming enough to encompass three thousand worlds.

The spectators saw the tip and knew that nothing would be able to stop it. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“What’s that?” Tai Yinxi had an ominous feeling.

“A dark metal found from the deepest location of the expanse, as unique as can be, then polished by a supreme existence.” The voice heard him and explained.

This naturally made Yinxi feel worse. The brick has been placed but not fully consolidated. That was still the weakest part of the wall.

The drill started spinning faster and faster. After reaching a certain revolution, it shot out a tiny ray of darkness.

“Boom!” The ray instantly crushed through the energy barriers. These barriers went down to the beams earlier but they quickly appeared once more.

Now, they didn’t stand a single chance against the ray of this drill. It was touching the actual wall now.

“Rumble!” All of Sky Pass was shaking from the impact.

“Drop down the sky sluice, now!” Tai Yinxi immediately commanded.

“Boom!” The ground beneath sent out all of its power, resulting in something akin to the explosions of a million stars.

This power combined together into a great sluice sliding down from above. It could crush everything beneath without fail.

The soldiers in charge of the sluice turned pale as a result. It instantly drained all of their vitality.

This was their ace card. If this were to fail, they wouldn’t be able to do anything else anyway.

“Rumble!” Thousands of smaller ships closest to the wall were crushed by this sliding sluice.

“Ahh!” Numerous dark invaders became bloody mists, unable to stop it.

“Lift it up.” The same voice earlier commanded. This person seemed to be the one controlling the diamond drill.

Suddenly, six different progenitorial auras erupted. Next came the appearance of six majestic figures.
