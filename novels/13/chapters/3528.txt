Chapter 3529: Absolute Defeat

The reconstruction seemed like a legend for the spectators, impossible to forget in this lifetime. However, the next moment was even more incredible.

Li Qiye was standing at the bottom and held the tip of the skeletal blade with two fingers. He seemed like a fly pushing up a mountain range. The stark contrast was a visual feast and left behind an indelible memory.

There was no logical path for him to be able to stop the blade with just two fingers; no different from an ant trying to push down a tree or a mosquito trying to move a giant.

Alas, this was indeed the case. He successfully stopped the monstrous slash while putting on a relaxed smile.

“Chaos Mantra, another of the seven!” One ancestor shouted after analyzing the scene.

“You’re right!” Others calmed down and agreed.

A few among them weren’t as surprised because Li Qiye had used multiple mantras prior. They knew that he must be cultivating all seven so they have grown numb.

Nonetheless, it was hard to find the right words to describe the situation. Li Qiye managed to use these common mantras in such an amazing fashion. Other top merit laws and mantras paled in comparison, not worth mentioning in the slightest.

This made people wonder if they have been looking at the fake versions.

“Should we try again? Start over with the seven?” One ancestor noticed that the reconstruction contained gods and devils, akin to the start of a new epoch.

Li Qiye resembled creation and the high heaven, capable of crafting all entities. Thus, others wanted to prostrate before him despite his ordinary stance and appearance.

“Go!” Star Ancient Ancestor channeled all of his power into the skeletal sword, nearly crushing all the space around him in the process.

Unfortunately, his full-effort attempt with the help of the armies still couldn’t move the skeletal sword.

Li Qiye had an easy expression while gripping the sword as if he was taking a stroll in his flower garden.

“This is insane, he’s not human.” One high elder eventually said. He had the urge of kneeling down before Li Qiye.

This was the case for virtually everyone in the crowd even though Li Qiye looked like a random pedestrian. He had no aura and pressure, only a friendly expression.

“Not too bad but you haven’t grasped the true fundamentals of Myriad Dao Heavenly Physique. This so-called Space Dragon Emperor was only experimenting and didn’t explain it fully to future generations.” Li Qiye chuckled.

The development already shocked the crowd. Now, Li Qiye’s comment left them speechless.

Space Dragon Emperor was praised as a revolutionary cultivator for starting a new path. Li Qiye didn’t seem to agree.

“He dares to talk about Space Dragon Emperor like this? It’s too much.” One expert said.

“He just wants to cause more and more trouble.” An ancestor from an old sect said: “Space Dragon Emperor’s descendants will come for him after hearing this. No one can mess with them.”

No one responded because they didn’t feel the same way. Li Qiye was too heaven-defying. They didn’t take offense to his criticism of the emperor.

“He’s probably qualified to judge a member of the Denary Founders.” An ancestor said.

“Boom!” Li Qiye suddenly flicked his wrist and broke the skeletal sword before people could react.

Golden Sun and the others appeared again and were blown flying while vomiting blood. The members of the armies suffered the same force.

“Too weak.” Li Qiye then waved his hand, releasing chaos on the unsuspecting world.

The sky vault seemed to be falling down; all of his opponents became suppressed before they could get back up from the initial blow.

The spectators couldn’t believe it. Li Qiye easily trapped the five ancient ancestors and the various armies with one hand wave.

This force wasn’t unbeatable but they could definitely sweep through all of the north. Today, Li Qiye had shown everyone his monstrous abilities.

“Activate!” The ancient ancestors roared and mustered their power to get back up. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

Unfortunately, the suppressive force intensified and smashed them into the ground. Their blood stained the soil.

It was as if Li Qiye was toying with ants. This was too much for the spectators to take.

“It’s over for those three sects.” An ancestor regained his wits and concluded.

Most spectators right now were horrified. They hoped that Li Qiye didn’t look over towards their direction or they would immediately drop to their knees.
