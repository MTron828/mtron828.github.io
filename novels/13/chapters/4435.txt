Chapter 4436: Tiger Pond

A sunken city existed in the ancestral ground of Tiger Pond. It was a place filled with fortunes and potential dao enlightenment.

It produced numerous ancient ancestors and top cultivators for Tiger Pond. Of course, only the most brilliant disciples or mighty ancestors could enter since it was too important for Tiger Pond.

Phoenix Ground’s inner region was similar. However, this city was underground, laying in ruins for many eras now.

The scale was clearly grand and the workmanship impeccable. Alas, not much was left outside of broken walls and tiles. The remnants were heavy and large, stripped and sculpted from mountains.

It maintained its aged appearance because no disciples were allowed to live here. It had “survived” numerous eras and the destruction of great sects.

It wasn’t created by Dragon and already existed as a home for demons before Dragon’s foundation. Space Dragon Emperor later came and brought Tiger Pond and Phoenix Ground back to Dragon.

In the middle was a dried lake. There were steps leading down to a smaller pond, hence the name of this area. Only the pond had water left in it.

The clear and cold water seemingly stayed the same for so long now. Nonetheless, there were no foul smells or growths. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

The water was the primary reason for its value. It could heal serious wounds via immersion. Of course, fatal wounds were a different story.

It had other effects as well - soothing the body and mind, quelling anger and evil, and boosting meditational efficacy…

Most importantly, it contained the mysteries of the dao. Those meditating in this place could benefit greatly.

There were four people standing next to the pond right now - Nine-tailed God and the three ancient demons. They stared at the water with a solemn expression.

Li Qiye sat in the water and gently waved his hand through the water once, creating ripples and waves. They seemed to be alive and waking up something underneath, similar to a flood-dragon yet not. This process continued even though Li Qiye’s hand stopped moving.

Nonetheless, spectators would be nervous from thinking that something could leap out of the water at any moment. This applied to the four demons as well despite their prowess.

“Something is coming out?” Ancient Treant asked.

Nine-tailed God shook his head: “No, this is an eternally indelible dao accumulation.” He paused and then added: “One left behind by a supreme.”

“Eternally indelible?” Ancient Lion became emotional.

“Old Lion, you’ve meditated here before, did you have the same phenomenon?” Ancient Pheasant asked about the waves.

“No.” Ancient Lion shook his head: “I’ve immersed myself here for who knows how long. I certainly benefited and found myself in a different place, becoming spirited and learning more. The dao just poured into me, truly a magical feeling.”

Ancient Lion was qualified to meditate here due to his achievements. Moreover, he benefited greatly as well.

“However, I didn’t produce this phenomenon.” He smiled wryly.

“What about you, Your Majesty?” The three ancient demons stared at Nine-tailed God.

“This is not a simple phenomenon.” Nine-tailed God stared intensely at the waves then said: “Back when I meditated, I saw grand dao and a spirit.”

“Spirit?” The three ancient demons became emotional.

“It wasn’t our progenitor, right?” One of them said.

Space Dragon Emperor didn’t leave behind this pond so it must have been a different supreme existence.

“Yes, someone I’ve never seen before.” Nine-tailed God said seriously.

“Who is it?” Ancient Treant was curious.

“I’m unsure, but it might be the legendary Jiu Bian.” To which Nine-tailed God responded.

“Jiu Bian?!” Their astonishment only grew.

They knew that Tiger Pond was rumored to have deep ties with Jiu Bian. Alas, there was no concrete evidence.

“Feng Qi and Jiu Bian…” Ancient Pheasant murmured. Bringing up Jiu Bian made him think about the connection between Feng Qi and Phoenix Ground as well.

“Was it really Jiu Bian? I’ve heard that Jiu Bian might have been born here.” Ancient Lion questioned.

“They’re all speculation from the ancient records.” Ancient Treant responded.

“Whether Jiu Bian was born here or not, it certainly had something to do with Jiu Bian.” Nine-tailed God said with confidence.
