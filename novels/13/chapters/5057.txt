Chapter 5058: Sit Over Here

Spectators were silenced by Li Qiye’s invincibility, thinking that they had never seen such a height before. Masters in the past merely flattered themselves without knowing the extent of cultivation power.

The commanding gods felt insignificant at the moment and could only look up at him.

“Sigh, my hands are dirty now.” Li Qiye wiped his palms and complained.

He then casually flicked his finger and released a ray to hit Vine God. The gigantic tree seemingly deflated down back to a regular form - a green vine with a wonderful glow. Particles were released and cured those afflicted by his pollen.

Dream Monarch woke up as well and the hypnotic spell was broken. Thus, cultivators and animals gradually awoke in confusion, not knowing what was going on.

Only the ancestors and demon monarchs who managed to stay awake saw the shocking fight.

Dream Monarch and Vine God returned to their throne. The first looked like a fat young master while the other resembled an old man with lightning flashing in his eyes.

All five commanding gods got up to bow toward Li Qiye. If it wasn’t for him, all of Demon would have suffered under the tyranny of Golden Mosquito.

“Haha, I can go in peace now.” Peacock Monarch couldn’t wait any longer and started laughing.

“Boom!” A five-colored radiance erupted and reached its limit. The monarch’s body turned into a beam shooting into the air.

“Screech!” A peacock manifested into reality and flapped its wings. It looked down at Demon with love and unwillingness. Nonetheless, it was time to go so the great beast dispersed into particles. The light fell onto every inch of the land and all of its creation. Peacock Monarch has returned to whence he came.

“Master.” Lil’ Freckle got on her knees and sobbed quietly. She raised her hands to accept the scattering five-colored particles.

“From dust to dust.” Goldcrest sighed and said.

Everyone was sad to see him gone, especially the members of Feather. They bowed in the direction of the throne to show respect to the fallen commanding god.

This was drastically different from Bloodfly’s end. One was highly celebrated while the other was reviled.

Li Qiye landed in front of Lil’ Freckle and handed her the complete god source.

She accepted it while nodding her head. Though she was sad, this wasn’t the time to cry.

Chillglare Hawk bowed before Li Qiye after seeing this. Everyone understood that Lil’ Freckle was going to be the next commanding god.

She was the chosen successor with a complete god source but most importantly, she had Li Qiye’s approval. No one could challenge her now.

“Come over here.” Li Qiye gestured at Goldcrest who was confused as to why.

He grabbed the youth and threw him onto the throne that once belonged to Bloodfly God.

The crowd became startled because Goldcrest shouldn’t have been able to get close. Nonetheless, Li Qiye still made it happen.

Goldcrest was completely lost - he was a member of Tiger and most importantly, he lacked the power to be a commanding god.

“Boom!” Li Qiye reached forward and pulled the actual divine beast tablet out of another dimension.nÊw st𝒐ries at n𝒐/vel/b/i/n(.)co𝒎

“What the hell…” The commanding gods’ jaw dropped to the ground.

The tablet was connected to the divine nest. They had to work together to summon it but Li Qiye could grab it whenever? Who else was as domineering as him?

“Buzz.” Li Qiye forcefully changed Bug because he wasn’t in the mood to come up with something new.

Legend has it that the founder god of Mist could only create a new deity branch, not change any existing ones. The latter had been imprinted for eras and became accepted by the divine nest.

Now, Li Qiye modified the branch by changing a few runes.

“Okay, call it Kun, that is more fitting for you.” Li Qiye told Goldcrest.

“I…” Goldcrest was speechless while sitting on the throne.

He never dreamed about becoming a commanding god before and now, he had a deity branch that was specifically crafted for him. Thus, he essentially became a founder god.

“I, I can’t do this.” He lacked confidence.

He didn’t want to let Demon and Li Qiye down. If he were to perform his duties inadequately, it would reflect negatively on Li Qiye.

After all, he knew his own power. He could wrestle other demon monarchs, not the commanding gods. For example, Chillglare Hawk could eat him whenever.

“Try your best, your followers are counting on you.” Li Qiye patted his shoulder.
