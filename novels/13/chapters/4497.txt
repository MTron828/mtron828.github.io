Chapter 4498: Alchemy Child

“You have a death wish!” Cloudgrasp’s anger intensified, the same for his fellow sect members.

The daoist sincerely responded: “Elder, this came from the bottom of my heart, don’t be hiding a sickness for fear of treatment. Our clan’s fortune-telling is supreme, I can read your fortune to prove it.”

A few big shots glanced at the daoist. One of them could see his background and nodded: “This person is not lying. His clan is renowned for their fortune-telling, dao lords have come there before seeking answers.”

“No need!” Cloudgrasp Elder had to swallow his anger again.

He indeed feared a bad outcome of the reading. An ominous reading would haunt him on top of proving the daoist correct and helpful. Thus, it would be improper for him to attack the group.

“Sigh, what a shame.” The daoist murmured: “My read can help one seek luck and avoid calamity. I am merely trying to do good for karma, this is not a good decision, Elder.”

“Young man, how much have you learned?” A big shot asked. This person was shrouded in a fog capable of nullifying top heavenly gazes. This was a testament to the big shot’s power and stealth technique.

“Sir, you’re interested in a reading?” The daoist’s eyes became bright: “My price is very fair and is dependent on your identity.”

“Is that so?” The big shot was interested: “I wonder how capable you are. There’s a chance you won’t be very helpful.”

“I’ll do one to test it out. If you feel that I am telling the truth, you can purchase a reading afterward.” The daoist accepted the challenge.

His cultivation was obviously inferior. However, he believed himself to be the absolute authority on divining and could read anyone here.

“I don’t think it’s looking good for you.” Another big shot smiled: “If you can read this daoist’s identity, it will show that you’re not a swindler.”

“I will read your root then.” The daoist told the hidden master.

“How interesting.” The first big shot had confidence in his stealth technique. No one should be able to see a single clue, let alone a junior like the daoist: “Go for it.”

“I will try my best then.” The daoist took a deep breath and took out a shell with both hands. He shook it and clanks could be heard. He started chanting mantra, looking as focused as can be.

A second later, his hands lit up. He read the trigrams and then looked up at the hidden master: “Sir, the trigram reads - plucking chrysanthemum beneath the eastern fence.” [1]

The big shot murmured and couldn’t believe it.

The daoist put away the shell and then smiled: “What do you think about my reading?”

“Not bad at all, seems genuine.” The big shot admitted. The line didn’t explicitly reveal his identity. Alas, this was indeed related to his origin.

“Then do you wish to purchase an official reading? My price is very competitive.” The daoist suggested.

“No.” The big shot was interested in the daoist’s ability. Alas, he also wanted to hide his identity and didn’t want the daoist to know.

“Hehe, anyone else wants to know their future?” The daoist took advantage of this opportunity.

Unfortunately, it was a tough crowd due to the circumstances. They didn’t want to reveal any information to others.

“Sigh, my price is really fair…” The daoist tried his best to peddle to no avail.

“Haha, look, no one wants your shoddy fortune-telling.” Jian Ming teased him.

The daoist glared at him, prompting him to shrug.

At this point, another guest came into the hall. He wore a daoist robe and had a youthful bun hairstyle despite being too old for it. An alchemy symbol could be seen on the robe.

It was obvious that he was a servant. Nonetheless, he stood out because he didn’t have an inferiority complex often found in servants. On the other hand, he looked rather proud and even prideful as if he was someone important.

The moment he came in, he announced his background with haste: “I am a disciple of True Immortal, an alchemy child under True Immortal Young Emperor.”

“True Immortal Young Emperor!” Everyone became startled, even the older cultivators.

True Immortal Young Emperor was one of the Five Conquerors of Sky Border, the successor of his sect.

They had lofty aspirations for his future. Their ancient ancestors personally taught him so that he could become a dao lord.

Though both he and Five-sun King were contemporary scions, most believed that the young emperor was one level higher.

The youth that has just entered the hall was a servant in charge of alchemy, being responsible for all of the young emperor’s medicines and pills.

In terms of status, he was indeed a servant. Alas, he was prestigious thanks to who his master was. If his master could become a dao lord in the future, his status would soar as well. Top alchemists would have to bow before him.

“I come in the young emperor’s stead hoping for a particular medicine.” The youth got straight to the point: “Esteemed Ancestors, please go easy when it is time for the auction. He must have this medicine.” FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

The youth spoke politely but in reality, this also served as a threat against the ancestors to not compete against the young lord of True Immortal. Otherwise, they would risk being humiliated.

Many ancestors became annoyed after receiving this warning from a servant in spite of his master's prestige.
