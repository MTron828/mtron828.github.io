Chapter 4668: Eight-hundred Li Dominator

Putting their original background aside, both Princess Sima and Eight-hundred Li Dominator were willing to become a part of True Immortal. Therefore, it wasn’t a problem for them to be part of the six prodigies.

“Don’t think you can do as you please in the presence of True Immortal.” Dominator’s eyes were filled with pride and aggression.

“Be smart and stand aside or I’ll flatten your sect.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

He was merely the truth but others didn’t interpret it the same way. Not to mention the livid members of True Immortal, listeners from a distance gasped in confusion.

“Flatten True Immortal? That’s an audacious claim.” One expert murmured.

A youth thought that Li Qiye was being too arrogant: “There’s a limit to bragging. None has done so in history outside of Emperor Ye.”

“The emperor didn’t flatten True Immortal either.” Another added.

“This will be his last day in this world, he’s not leaving this place alive after saying something like this.” A clan disciple added.

“Obviously, True Immortal has their young emperor and many ancient ancestors here, not to mention the invincible Cosmic Lord. A junior can’t possibly contest this.” A big shot agreed.

On the other hand, an older fan of Li Qiye gave him a thumbs-up: “Still the same domineering style, that’s Li Qiye for you.”

Both the geniuses had an ugly expression after hearing this.

“You are a dead man.” Dominator shouted.

Sima Hanshan, on the other hand, had a softer tone: “Fellow Daoist Li, please leave. This place has nothing to do with our personal feud. Our alliance is prepared to work together so it is a mistake to push the issue.”

She reminded Li Qiye that he wasn’t only facing True Immortal in this case. The alliance consisted of four behemoths from Sky Border.

“I suppose I will have to flatten three more sects then. That’s the result of standing in my way.” Li Qiye smirked. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“!!!” The crowd became astounded since no one else would dare to make this comment. Even Dao Sanqian couldn’t do so.

Li Qiye’s words remained overbearing as if he was talking about swatting four flies.

“I don’t know what’s going on.” An ancestor smiled wryly.

“There is no place for him to go after offending this temporary alliance. No sect will dare to protect him.” A high elder commented.

Dominator’s expression was as ugly as can be. The sheer contempt was impossible to tolerate.

“Let me see if you can back up your words then!” He shouted.

“You alone?” Li Qiye stared at him, infuriating him once more.

He was one of the Six Prodigies of True Immortal. His power and talent proved him worthy of his title.

Being looked down upon was a new experience to him, causing him to tremble with rage.

“I alone am enough to kill you.” He gritted his teeth, wanting to obliterate his arrogant foe.

“Fellow Daoist Li, if you insist on moving forward, I’m afraid I will have to participate for it is my duty.” Sima Hanshan added.

She knew how he killed True Immortal Spirit and didn’t dare to be careless.

“Come together, save me some time.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“Very well, arrogant brat! Eat this!” The agitated Dominator channeled his energy, resulting in a tornado spinning around him. Gales emanating from it blew trees away. Dust filled the air and blinded spectators.

“Blessed Eighty Thousand Li.” Experts recognized the technique after seeing the gales.

Cultivators ten thousand miles away were sent flying. Even those strong enough to maintain their stance felt sharp cuts everywhere on their face, seemingly flaying them.

This was a technique created by Blessed Dao Lord and mastered by his final disciple. The latter went on to create Eighty-thousand Li Court.

As its successor, Dominator has grasped the essence of this supreme merit law. Therefore, the gales were rather unbearable.

“How does he compare to True Immortal Spirit?” A spectator asked.

“The young emperor is the strongest among the six, it’s hard to say about the rest. Maybe Dominator will be stronger than True Immortal Spirit.” Someone answered.

“I don’t think he stands a chance since Li Qiye can borrow the fist intents here.” A big shot said.

“Right, one man alone can’t stop Li Qiye.” Many agreed.
