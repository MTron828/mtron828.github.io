Chapter 5401: No Two On One

Of course, this has been the main crisis for Dao Alliance all this time - having both internal and external threats.

The former was the largest problem - Illumination. There were ways for Dao Alliance to deal with Heaven and Divine Alliance. For example, teaming up with Imperial Alliance.

Alas, Illumination’s existence meant a rift was inevitable. Internal strife would come and Dao Alliance would be weakened.

The problem was that All-things couldn’t be the one to make the first move. He had to wait for Illumination to break all friendly facades first. Otherwise, he would risk losing his position in Dao Alliance.

Today, Illumination and Azure School finally made a move, giving him an opportunity to take down Illumination.

Unfortunately, he now faced the combined might of Heaven and Divine Alliance. His death here meant that Illumination might have the chance to return and take over what’s left of Dao Alliance.

“Brother, it seems like this is the end of the road for you. We will send you to the next part of the journey.” Supreme didn’t wish to miss this opportunity.

All-things’ death meant the end of Dao Alliance regardless of Illumination’s actions in the future. Its weakened state would have no chance against Heaven and Divine Alliance.

“Perish.” Supreme spoke emotionlessly like a butcher cutting down a chicken - just an act not needing further rumination.

He slashed forward, aiming to destroy All-things’ anima defense.

“Apologies.” Eternal wanted to kill All-things first in order to move on to the next target - Illumination.

“Boom!” A single thought from him spanned an eternity, creating a dao stagnation and weakening All-things’ barrier.

Time could wither everything and Eternal could outlast any opponent. He possessed all the necessary attributes - a profound temporal dao, an ultimate bloodline, and an unyielding dao heart.

All-things couldn’t stop the slash as a result; death came knocking on his door.

As his life flashed before his eyes, a palm descended and dispelled the stagnation along with the void slash.

Both Supreme and Eternal felt as if they were fish out of the water, unable to muster any strength.

Their expression soured, realizing that whoever did this was far beyond their current power level.

They looked up and saw that it was none other than Li Qiye who had one hand raised. This was the man they didn’t want to see the most.

Despite the casual extension of his hand, no fish would be able to break free from his suppression. The power disparity was overwhelming.

He then flicked his finger and nullified their dao, causing them to stagger backward.

This was not their first time witnessing Li Qiye’s power but this still shook them all the same.

“Two-on-one is unfair.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

The two took a deep breath; Supreme bowed and said politely: “Sir, do you stand on the side of Dao Alliance and wish to participate in this conflict?”

“I’m not interested in this nonsense but since I am in a good mood, I wish to keep it by not allowing this two-on-one ambush.” Li Qiye waved his hand in response.

“We apologize for ruining your day then.” Supreme said: “And we shall do so no longer, we will be taking our leave. It will be an honor to meet you again next time, Sir.” With that, he left without any hesitation.

Eternal smiled wryly and shook his head, instantly disappearing into the horizon.

“Sir, I cannot express my gratitude enough. You’ve saved my life…” All-things came over and bowed.

“Quite a risky move, using yourself as bait to see where I stand.” Li Qiye smirked.

“I wouldn’t dare. Your thinking is above our speculation.” All-things responded.

“Whatever, it’s fine, at least you know that there is a line to not cross.” Li Qiye said.

“I understand.” All-things bowed again.

“You’re quite skilled at maintaining the balance.” Li Qiye said.

“You jest, Sir. I am only trying my best.” All-things smiled.

“Although I do not wish to involve myself in this matter, you should understand that true disasters loom within the apex cultivators.” Li Qiye said.

“I do wish to stop this eternal conflict.” All-things sighed.

“Avoiding calamities is an active process during cultivation.” Li Qiye said.

“I will take that to heart, Sir.” All-things said.

“You’re really stubborn.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but chuckle. UppTodat𝒆d fr𝒐m nô/v/e/lb(i)n.c(o)/m

“I’m afraid I do not understand, Sir. Please enlighten me.” All-things said sincerely.

“Here is my advice, be decisive when time calls for it. If you’re too protective of your own feathers, failure is inevitable.” Li Qiye said.

All-things’ eyes lit up after hearing this. He felt energized since this was a clear command.

“I see, I shall follow your order, Sir.” He knew exactly what to do; it was time for him to not care about the minor details.
