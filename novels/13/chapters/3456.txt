“That’s my line. The young master doesn’t need to take action against an insignificant junior, I alone am enough.” Qing Shi smiled and said before stepping forward.

His haughty tone left people confused for a bit. However, some have seen the exchange between him and Wu Zhongtian back in Ancestral already.

They thought that Qing Shi learned this attitude from his master, not giving a damn about anyone.

“So dumb, daring to provoke His Highness. He’s not long for this world.” One spectator commented.

“The maiden isn’t here so be smart and surrender. No one can save you.” The godchild stared at Qing Shi, aware that he was quite powerful after dealing with a force back in the stone forest.

The maiden had left Ancestral so the godchild and the prince considered this the best opportunity. They no longer needed to hold back against Li Qiye.

Many among the crowd were jealous of Li Qiye. They wanted to see him taken down a notch and eliminated.

“You’re so blind.” Qing Shi snorted in response: “Only people like you would think that the young master requires the maiden’s protection. She actually saved your dog lives back then yet you have no idea.”

The geniuses have never experienced such disdain before, being called blind in public. Their expression naturally soured; their rage blinded them from thinking about the situation.

“You’re done.” Murderous glints flashed from the godchild’s eyes, pricking everyone’s vision. “You choose hell instead of heaven. Can only blame yourself...”

“There’s a limit to acting cool.” Qing Shi interrupted him and smiled: “Anyone can spout tough words and that’s all you can do.”

The godchild’s expression became unsightly.

Li Qiye chuckled and ordered: “Teach them a lesson.” With that, he picked up some soil from the ground and meticulously calculated.

“Did you hear that? I have to teach you a lesson now.” Qing Shi laughed, looking like a fox exploiting the tiger’s might.

“We’ll see who’s the one boasting.” The first prince retorted.

“Your Highness, teach this ignorant brat a lesson on how to act properly.” The crowd started cheering.

“Very well, I will teach you in your master’s stead.” The godchild sternly said.

“With your meager abilities? The two of you need to come together to save me time.” Qing Shi leisurely responded.

“You two, go see what he can do.” The princess on her chariot spoke.

“I will keep an eye out, Fellow Daoists.” Wu Zhongtian smiled; his murderous eyes fixated on Li Qiye. He was ready to take Li Qiye’s head and offer it to his fallen brother. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“Finally, we’ll all get to see what the first prince of Skylight and the successor of Firmaments can do.”

The other two exchanged glances. The first prince moved to pincer Qing Shi, stopping his escape path.

Though they sounded confident, they exercised prudence because Qing Shi was powerful.

“Crush his mouth so that he’ll know how to act.” One expert nearby scowled.

“That’s right, beat the servant first then the master, they won’t run their mouth from now on.” The majority of the crowd seemed to be on the prince’s side. They have forgotten about how they were chased out of Fire Domain earlier.

Qing Shi remained calm despite being surrounded by two powerful foes. The crowd naturally didn’t appreciate his carelessness. The duo themselves were livid as well.

“Die!” The godchild spread his palm to deliver a crushing strike; swords started hymning.

His fingers turned into five divine swords with rampaging sword energy. They created an inescapable net around Qing Shi.

“Clank! Clank!” The energy in the sword domain started descending down on Qing Shi with enough force to crush everything. He alone was able to create a small sword formation with his palm.

The first prince also made his move at the exact moment. He unleashed a dual punch, releasing two soaring dragons. They coiled together and surged forward like a beam. Their claws could easily tear anything to pieces.

A combination of sword and draconic technique - immensely mighty. This impressed the crowd. Many experts here thought that they wouldn’t be able to stop the moves coming from two sides.

“Not bad.” Qing Shi chuckled and casually swung his sword.

“Clank!” Its hymn swept through the area with stability in mind. Sword images the size of mountains became the ultimate cosmic force.
