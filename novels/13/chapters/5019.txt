Chapter 5020: Boom, And It’s Opened

Due to his confident demeanor, they gave him the benefit of the doubt. No one had a clue of the tablet’s origin since Bloodfly kept his mouth shut.

Due to his demeanor and intent, everyone knew that this was a famous tablet and should be rather useful.

“It’ll be humiliating if he can’t open it.” Jun Cuican uttered coldly.

He took pride in being considered the greatest genius in the lower continents. In fact, only Phenomena Conqueror could compare with him in this regard. If he couldn’t figure out this tablet, Li Qiye had no chance as well.

“The light of a firefly cannot compare to the radiance of the moon. You all are mere insects and have no chance of opening it.” Li Qiye chuckled and didn’t hold back, immediately offending everyone in the palace.

“You can’t possibly think you’re better than all the great cultivators in the world.” Jun Cuican retorted.

“Are you all included among these so-called great cultivators? No, you’re nothing more than fools who seek only fame and reputation.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

“You!” Jun Cuican turned red from rage.

Radiant Monarch had a broad mind but still became annoyed: “Fellow Daoist, don’t insult others lest you want trouble.”

“If you disagree, feel free to try to do something about it. The result won’t be favorable though.” Li Qiye stretched and said.

“Hmph, brat, if you can’t solve this tablet, we won’t need to do anything since the commanding god will be the first to kill you.” Pagoda Guardian said menacingly and directed the focus onto Bloodfly God.

He wouldn’t stand for Li Qiye’s failure due to the previous comments. His eyes glowed red - a sign of agreeing.

He endured everything for the sake of the tablet. Thus, Li Qiye would lose all value except one - being his prey.

“My rage will not cease unless I personally take your head.” Skystomper, on the other hand, didn’t hide his willingness to avenge Halo Monarch and his son.

“Once again, get in line.” Li Qiye smiled before speaking to Bloodfly: “Looks like you’re in line too.”

“Just open the tablet and all will be forgiven.” Bloodfly said while losing patience: “Please hurry up if you can actually do it.”

“Hmph, it’s too late for stalling now.” Jun Cuican said: “You’re not leaving this palace alive today if you can’t figure it out.”

“Get started already. I’m in line as well to dismember you.” Wild Dragon laughed.

“Fools lacking any semblance of self-awareness.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

“Young Noble Li, please make...” Golden Cicada King was the only one who was still cordial.

However, Li Qiye tapped the tablet before he could finish and sent out a feeble wave of energy.

“Bam!” The tablet was split in half and fell to the ground, leaving everyone frozen.

Golden Cicada’s mouth was still open since he didn’t finish his line before it was over. An invisible hand seemed to be grasping everyone’s throat.

A while ago, Wild Dragon and Radiant Monarch went all out only to fail. As for Thousand-faced Sovereign, his dao derivation nearly worked and was only one step away. All of this showed them how tough the tablet was.

However, what Li Qiye did could barely be considered a palm strike. Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Bloodfly God was also overwhelmed with shock. He had used numerous methods for generations now to open it, whether it be using a tough artifact or true flames. Dao derivation didn’t work either.

He actually questioned his sanity and whether this wasn’t the same tablet. However, there were previous attempts already.

“Buzz.” Something resembling fog and sand spewed out of the tablet.

This thing blotted out the sky just like a swarm of mosquitoes. The horrified crowd calmed down and prepared to attack this unknown affinity.

“Whoosh!” However, it condensed into a single entity and disappeared deeper into Demon.

A second later, something exploded and caused the entire region to shake violently. All demons and beasts were left in fear because this power could pierce through all of Demon.

The dragon lords could tell that this was far above their level. Their expression darkened at this realization.

Fortunately, this power lasted briefly and dispersed as if it was never there in the first place.

Meanwhile, other commanding gods stood up in astonishment. An ancient existence opened its eyes and let out a long sigh after sensing this.

“Something bad is happening.” Thousand-faced Sovereign was still around.

“Demon will change after this.” On another side, Truth Conqueror grimaced and said.

Back at the palace, people finally calmed down.

“Looks like something was freed.” Ming Shi said.

The other guests exchanged glances, still at a loss.
