The crystal sword was unbelievably thin to the point of being invisible. It was similar to the bronze sword used in the previous duel with Solitary Sword God. They were sword dao, or something even above it.

As long as his heart had the sword, then one would be in his hand -a single thought to create these blades.

The swords came from Finality Sword, something used to be called the Physique Scripture.

After Li Qiye flipped a new page, the Physique Scripture stopped existing and was replaced by Finality. It encompassed and surpassed all the sword dao in the world.

The name meant that everything would end with the sword, whether it be merit laws or any other affinities. The moment this sword came out, all would stop.

Despite being the origin of sword dao, Finality had no techniques, variations, or dao of the sword.

It had everything yet nothing of the sword dao, only existing in the heart and mind. However, everyone had unique thoughts, so its shape would vary as well.

For example, if others were to obtain this version of Finality, they could gain a supreme sword technique; another could figure out a peerless sword dao. The end result was predicated on the nature of the person.

For Li Qiye, his assimilation allowed him to have a formless sword, or that he himself was the sword.

As for the bronze sword, it served as a heavy weapon. With a single thought, he created an unstoppable weapon due to its immeasurable weight. It didn’t matter how strong his foe might be, stopping the sword was an impossibility.

As for the crystal sword, it was as thin as universally possible. Thus, it became indiscernible and terrifyingly sharp. He became capable of severing everything, such as the two beasts earlier.

These weren’t actually sword dao, but rather the very origins of the sword - affinities such as weight and sharpness.

This allowed him to take down the beasts without any surprises. The Kui saw this and became frightened. That crystal sword could easily dismember it as well.

He only chuckled and put away the sword before walking towards the dark cave.

The Kui hesitated, not because of the dangers within the cave but because of Li Qiye.

“Want to go in?” Li Qiye paused and gestured at it.

The lack of hostility excited the Kui. It immediately went next to him since this cave was its goal, acting quite chummy by rubbing its head on him.

The two beasts earlier were protecting the cave so it couldn’t enter. Li Qiye’s arrival has given it this opportunity.

“I guess I’m doing some charity work here.” He pushed the Kui back while playfully putting on a disgusted expression.

The Kui didn’t mind and continued walking slowly right behind Li Qiye.

This cave was pitch-black. One couldn’t see their own fingers in front of them. Nevertheless, Li Qiye walked forward without becoming lost.

This was a dimension of darkness with numerous coordinates. Just one wrong step and one would be forever lost. This wasn’t the case for Li Qiye as if he had been here before.

Flashing light could be seen up ahead after a long trek in total darkness. The excited Kui quietly called out, finally having the chance to come to this place.

They came out of the darkness and found the light emanating from a pond. Despite its inconspicuous appearance, the water here exuded a gentle light like a priceless jewel amidst the darkness.

Li Qiye chuckled and said: “The time isn’t right.” He then sat by the pond and soak his legs in the water.

The Kui didn’t know how to speak but still copied Li Qiye, dipping its only leg into the water. The thing was still confused since it failed the last several times to make it here. Instinct told it that something incredible was in this place, that’s all it knew.

Li Qiye rested his eyes for quite a while before opening them back up to chat with the beast: “At your considerable power, do you ever think about where you came from, or your race?”

The Kui seemed to understand the question but it looked at him in confusion.

“Looks like certain things are still out of grasp before true intelligence.” He smiled.

The beast only looked at him, seemingly waiting for him to speak again.

“Only the villainous heaven can create life, well, actually, nature itself is the creator.” Li Qiye said: “This is limited to races, but certain things are out of this boundary.”

The beast looked as if it was contemplating.

“There was a legend in a distant era. It says that after the death of an immortal, a single hair of this being could turn into a galaxy, a piece of dead skin could become a supreme creature. Basically, this immortal’s body included three thousand worlds. Of course, this is only a legend.” He chuckled.

His eyes then turned profound: “Isn’t it interesting if it’s true? It means that certain lives aren’t created, only derived from something else, meaning that they aren’t under the watch of the villainous heaven. This could mean that universal laws could be avoided.”

The beast might have understood this part.

“If you can jump out of this world, then you can finally be you. Otherwise, you’re only a speck of dust.” He concluded while patting the beast’s shoulder.Diiscover new 𝒔tories at n𝒐ve/lbin(.)c/o𝒎
