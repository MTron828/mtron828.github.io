Chapter 4336: Wailing Darkness

The crowd’s attention shifted back to the young lord after Jinlin’s question.

Was the idea of activating the altar his alone? Or was it the will of his father and Dragon? In the latter case, the weight was far heavier.

“Does it matter? I represent myself, that’s more than enough.” The young lord replied.

“I represent Lion’s Roar in this matter.” Jinlin stared at him. Each word of this sentence had the immensity of a mountain.

The crowd took a deep breath, aware of its significance. This meant that the kingdom didn’t allow for activation, not just Jinlin himself.

Anyone who supported the young lord in this endeavor would be going against Lion’s Roar.

The young lord glared angrily at Jinlin but didn’t say anything. Everyone could tell that Jinlin had the upper hand right now.

He wanted to do something after Jinlin stole the spotlight and forced him back. Alas, he needed to exercise prudence.

He believed that he was on the same level as Jinlin in terms of ability. It’s just that he lacked authority in Dragon, unable to represent it.

“Your Highness, if you have a better plan, we are eagerly waiting to hear it.” The saintess broke the silence. This helped the young lord from further embarrassment and didn’t offend Jinlin either.

“I’m listening.” The young lord snorted. He thought that once he had enough authority in the future, he would challenge and destroy Lion’s Roar then.

“Are you finished yet?” Li Qiye waved his hand before Jinlin could respond. His patience seemed to be gone: “I’m not here to negotiate, only to inform. You don’t have any option here but to accept.”

“Hmph!” The young lord’s annoyance resurfaced again: “And if I don’t accept?”

He purposely tried to provoke Li Qiye into starting a fight with him.

“Then I’ll wring your head off.” Li Qiye glanced dismissively at him.

“What?!” The crowd gasped after hearing such arrogance.

Further elaboration on the young lord’s prestigious status was unnecessary. The crowd knew it all too well.

Moreover, he was a sovereign already. This made people watch their words when speaking to him. Not even Jinlin would talk about wringing his head off. Li Qiye might be the sole exception.

“Ignorant fool!” The young lord already had a fiery temperament. Now, he could stand this no longer.

He stood up and released his vitality and aura. The area outside the stage became flattened as a result.

While others trembled in fear, Li Qiye wasn’t impressed in the slightest.

“Rumble!” However, continuous explosions akin to a giant beating down on the earth interrupted the quarrel.

Everyone looked back and saw the black fog surging out again. It seemingly took the form of a giant and was unleashing a barrage of palm strikes down on the ward’s barrier.

The barrier shook violently and dimmed down, on the verge of collapsing.

“The darkness is back again!” Many shuddered in fear since they saw a fiendish palm striking down.

Some felt their legs giving in so they dropped butt-first on the ground. The majority were members of the weaker sects. They had never seen something like this before, hence their fear.

“Will the barrier go down? How much longer?” A disciple from a great power became startled.

“We need to activate the divine altar now or everything in the south will be destroyed!” An elder from a small sect shouted.

“We need to open it now.” The young lord took advantage of this and said.

“What should we do, Sir?” Jinlin had a serious expression while asking Li Qiye.

The latter ignored him and stepped into the air, heading straight for the fog outside the barrier.

“Be careful!” This took everyone by surprise and a few warned him.

“Does he have a death wish?” A disciple from a large sect asked.

“He’s crazy.” The youths were too afraid of the darkness yet Li Qiye was heading straight for it. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The fog took note of this and seemingly came back to life. It roared and expanded continuously. Dark waves engulfed the sky.
