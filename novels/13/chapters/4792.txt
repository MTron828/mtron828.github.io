Chapter 4793: Greed

Li Qiye, the current epoch lord in his prime, possessed the sturdiest physique and strongest grand dao along with all the essences under the heaven. He, in reality, was a heavenly treasure or to put it bluntly, an immensely nutritious feast.

For a regular cultivator, just one drop of true blood if fully absorbed without side effects could make them into a top master.

As for the supreme overlords hiding among the stars or inside Desolate Wild? Eating Li Qiye could prolong their lifespan and bring them back to their prime.

His value in their eyes was countless times higher than any peerless artifact or medicine. No immortal alchemy material could have the same effect as his flesh and blood.

Thus, profound pairs of eyes were fixated on him with greed. Under normal circumstances, being foolish enough to attack him would turn them into his meals instead.

Now, the high heaven’s tribulation couldn’t be faked - something strong enough to reduce them to ashes. Therefore, he had heavenly injuries on him. The scale has shifted and victory seemed probable.

Moreover, if one of them couldn’t beat him despite the injuries, what about two or three? This idea made their heart beat faster.

They wanted to rise against the heaven again and create a new epoch for themselves.

Even characters such as Dao Sanqian became tempted. The power disparity might not be as hopeless as before.

Of course, they were different from the overlords. The latter wanted to devour Li Qiye while they coveted his treasures. For example, the immortal gemstone and Corporeal Zone.

Obtaining one would make them the ruler of Eight Desolaces for eras to come. No other sect could compete with them.

Dao Sanqian was often described to be an immortal with his three thousand dao. Now, with a heavenly treasure, the popular adage would actually become true.

As long as he had one, dao lords in the future wouldn’t be superior. In fact, he would be the one appointing geniuses to become the next dao lord.

“What do you think, Dao Brothers?” Dao Sanqian cupped his fist toward Specter and Six-dao.

He desired the treasures but lacked confidence in doing this alone, hence wanting to involve True Immortal.

They had Specter, Six-dao, and Cosmic Lord right now - a formidable fighting force.Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

Meanwhile, spectators also watched with bated breath. They also felt the same greed since Li Qiye was now a dragon stuck in a quagmire.

Killing a weakened Li Qiye might be the greatest feat in history. The victor would gain unimaginable power and become the next ruler.

Of course, the first opportunity belonged to apex existences in their mind - Dao Sanqian and the others.

Specter and Six-dao exchanged glances after hearing this.

“What do you want?” Six-dao and Dao Sanqian were friends but Specter didn’t know him, hence the blunt tone.

They obviously already knew the answer but still wanted to hear a plan.

“This bright world requires someone who can uphold justice.” Dan Sanqian said: “Let this be our unshrinkable duty.”

Old geezers have heard these poetic words too many times so they understood each other.

“Well said.” Six-dao praised.

The thing stopping them from attacking Li Qiye prior was his power. The situation has changed.

“True Immortal is the leader of the world, it needs to be unbeatable.” Dao Sanqian went on, implying that the heavenly treasure was required.

Specter and Six-dao lived during True Immortal’s golden age and reigned with their master. They desired to bring the sect back to its prime as the number one sect. Therefore, the temptation was rather strong for them.

“Ancestor?” Six-dao quietly asked.

This could be a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for True Immortal.

Specter pondered carefully and didn’t answer right away. However, someone else interrupted their conversation: “Return to the sect right now.”

Everyone looked over and saw a woman around twenty years of age standing nearby. She wore a light-blue dress with no extravagant embroideries. As she stood there, she gave off an aura of calmness and peace just like a pristine lake inside a remote valley.
