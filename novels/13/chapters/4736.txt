Chapter 4737: Azure Madstone

“I haven’t seen it in a long time.” An archaic ancestor praised.

“Their tribe rarely used it, that’s why. I heard in the last several eras, only Heaven Devourer Mad God took it out.” An existence with ample knowledge of the mad frogs said.

Tian Feng belonged to Divine Dragon Valley but his origin was well-documented. His race’s population was rather humble. Thus, every member was a highly-valued existence.

The demon monarchs from there always dominated each generation. The tribe naturally had lofty aspirations for him and fully supported his quest for the dao lord position, hence his possession of the madstone. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Rumor has it that these frogs were born beneath a particular peak. Inside this peak was the peerless madstone. Because of this, some believed that their race might have been created partly due to this stone.

For example, a random frog could have come across this stone and held it in its mouth long enough to transform into something different, becoming the race’s progenitor. From this, the frog gained a gift similar to the innate ones bestowed by the heaven.

This hypothesis was supported due to the madstone’s ability to boost the mad frogs’ innate gifts, allowing them to reach their limit or even break through.

A wielder of the madstone became dozens of times stronger, perhaps even a hundred times.

Tian Feng’s physique was said to be able to block a dao lord weapon. This might not be entirely accurate but was still a testament to his tenacity.

If it were to be a hundred times stronger with the madstone, wouldn’t that make him invulnerable?

“Activate! “Tian Feng roared again. The madstone became red like blood and illuminated Tian Feng’s body. His bulging muscles received infinite power subsequently, seemingly infused with true dragon blood and turning into dragons.

His flesh became as tough as divine metal and brimmed with power. “Boom!” The slightest movement of his started causing loud explosions. Just one touch could crush a mountain.

Spectators gasped after seeing this. It meant that just his physical strength alone could destroy a kingdom. With this, he finally stopped the descending palm from his foe.

Earlier, the duo couldn’t stop the palm despite using numerous treasures. However, the muscular Tian Feng turned into a frenzied warrior and possessed enough power to make it competitive.

“You should take pride in your physical prowess.” Li Qiye nodded approvingly while staring at Tian Feng’s body and its draconic muscles.

He needed the power of the madstone to boost his innate gift to the maximum limit. Nonetheless, this didn’t mean that it was available to everyone.

Due to its profundity and power, it could crush other users instantly. For example, the young emperor and Five-sun King thought that instead of activating their potential, they would just be grievously injured by the madstone.

“What an insane body.” The ancient demons and mighty ancestors couldn’t help but praise him since he managed to considerably surpass them in this regard.

If they were to deactivate their merit laws and cultivation in order to participate in a physical contest, he would be able to reduce them to a bloody pulp.

“He would have no problem stopping dao lord weapons.” An old demon commented.

“More than that. I believe that it would take something out of this world to pierce through his body.” A hidden master responded.

“Let’s see how tenacious you are then.” Li Qiye became interested and smiled.

His hand lit up as the palm of energy descended with increased intensity.

“Boom!” The ground sank by one hundred meters in the blink of an eye, terrifying spectators.

“Activate!” Tian Feng’s body bent down as he mustered more energy.

The madstone released rays resembling the resembling to that of a blood diamond. His body became larger and tougher, the same for his muscles. He became a giant at this point, capable of shouldering the entire sky vault.

The young emperor and Five-sun King got up at this point and stared at Tian Feng’s monstrous body. They had no confidence in taking him down.

“Rumble!” The region was on the verge of collapsing. It became a contest with Li Qiye gradually applying more power, the same with the madstone.

As his body grew larger, his chaos true energy continued to deplete and was no longer able to handle the madstone.

“We shall lend you a hand, Brother Tian Feng!” The young emperor and Five-sun King joined in.
