Li Qiye has been staying at the inn for the last few days, preoccupied with the stone duck egg.

Qing Shi also paid attention to the carving process. Li Qiye was as meticulous as can be. He didn’t focus on anything else during this period.

Each cut contained a strange and mystical order. The blade technique eluded Qing Shi as well. He didn’t understand its profundity and worldly harmony.

Nonetheless, he saw an illusion that each cut could invite the heavenly lightning and earthly fire. Numerous tribulations have poured into the egg.

It was as if Li Qiye was channeling the powers of the world, the heavenly tribulations, and the rhythm of all things into the egg.

Eventually, he felt that the egg had contained an unimaginable power - enough to reduce Ancestral City to dust.

Each cut also left behind a line. These lines weren’t that simple. Li Qiye wasn’t intending on carving dao runes on the surface of the egg.

His blade somehow bypassed the outer layer and directly added dao runes into the egg’s inside. The lines existed in different spatial coordinates after being infused. This was far harder than just cutting the surface.

Upon closer inspection, there were galaxies added to the egg now. Li Qiye seemed to be playing the role of a world creator. He started numerous minor dimensions in the egg; each brimming with incredible power.

Curiosity eventually got the best of Qing Shi as he asked: “Young Master, is there something special in the egg?”

Its value was obvious since Li Qiye had spent so much time on it. After all, the stoneheart pill and the pearl necklaces were crushed by Li Qiye. This egg should be much more valuable.

“It’s special and precious.” Li Qiye smiled: “It is a unique material capable of containing everything. Unfortunately, it had cracked before so it’s not worth as much.”

Qing Shi noticed the initial crack as well. It seemed to have it whenever it came out of Foolish Stone.

“Did someone do this?” Qing Shi asked while looking at the crack.

“That’s one way to look at it. The person broke out and left behind this crack. Nonetheless, it’s impressive for something like this to exist. It’s not the only one either.”

“Really?” Qing Shi was surprised.

Remember, this stone egg was left behind by Golem Ancestor - this was indicative of its value. There were more than just one?

“Are they all hidden at the park?” His expression changed.

“Who knows?” Li Qiye smiled and continued with the carving.

“Young Master, what’s your goal in carving these dao runes?” Qing Shi stared at the eggs covered with lines.

“That’s a secret.” Li Qiye let out a mysterious smile.

Qing Shi knew better than to ask more questions about the egg.

***

Today, someone finally came to see Li Qiye.

Qing Shi brought the guest and said: “Young Master, he is an ancestor of Ancestral and wishes to see you.”

Li Qiye stared at the youth. He became awkward and lowered his head: “He has no malice.”

“Please don’t blame him, Young Noble. I insisted and made him. My last name is Lu.” The ancestor cupped his fist towards Li Qiye and said.

Ancestor Lu wore a robe with a crescent-moon color on top of his large frame. He looked like a pillar and that if he were to collapse, it would be enough to flatten a large area.

He was a golem who still maintained a body of flesh and blood. Being old didn’t diminish his vitality. He seemed to have a long lifespan ahead of him.

Those familiar with Ancestral would be shocked to hear his last name. They would immediately stand up to greet him.

His influence and power were well known, definitely a big shot in the grand scheme of things.

Of course, Li Qiye simply sat there and only gave him one glance. “Sit down.”

The old man cupped his fist again before sitting down. He had no arrogance usually found in a big shot.

“I apologize for coming uninvited, please forgive me.” He politely said.

“It’s whatever since you’re here already. Speak.” Li Qiye waved and was being considerate because of Qing Shi.

The ancestor was used to being revered by others. However, he seemed to be doing fine in this situation as well.

He pondered for a bit before speaking: “I have some questions that you might be able to answer, Young Noble.”

“Really now?” Li Qiye smiled since this was expected.

“I wish to ask about the stone tablet situation.” The ancestor asked while becoming tense.

He hasn’t felt this way ever since becoming one of the strongest members of Ancestral City. He realized that he was facing an unknown existence that could be above his station. Alas, he needed to get to the bottom of this.

Rumors have been spreading across the city about this event.

Some said that an ancestor of Ancestral was behind the massacre of the Yin Yang army. This was to stop them from being so arrogant.

Ancestral had a hard time dispelling this notion. They definitely didn’t do it but all signs pointed towards them - quite a predicament.

An ill-feeling would exist between the two sects. This might turn them into enemies as well.

On the other hand, a public denial would make others point to Li Qiye or someone else. That also had significant implications.

The tablet was special to them because the words came from Golem Ancestor and it was erected by Stone Monarch Dao Lord.

No one has been able to move this tablet in history. Thus, when an outsider had complete control over it, the cores of Ancestral City would be questioned. Its status and reputation could be negatively impacted.

That’s why Ancestor Lu came in secrecy. Qing Shi was the only one who knew.

“Nothing to be puzzled over. I used it to kill a few people.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said. Tôp 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l updates on n/(o)/v/𝒆lb/in(.)com

A few people - Qing Shi smiled wryly. He killed around ten thousand people with that smash.

Ancestor Lu expected something like this but still felt a great blow. He himself couldn’t move the tablet, let alone uprooting it to kill an army then moving it back.

All of this happened with the wave of a hand? He couldn’t imagine Li Qiye’s method.

Could he be a dao lord? Impossible. Everyone would know about him in this case.

But if he wasn’t a dao lord, what magic did he employ to do so?
