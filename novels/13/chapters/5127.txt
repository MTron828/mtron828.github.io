Chapter 5128: True Bear Peak

He arrived at the upper two continents next, entering a remote region with endless mountains and bestial auras.

He looked around and noticed the tallest peak out of them all, looking rather imposing and magnificent.

“Extraordinary.” He said with a smile while sensing the aura of this land.

“Mmm, not bad, decent enlightenment.” He commented.

He came searching for a coffin. Just the Yin Sever Aqua from Lin Mo alone was not enough. This particular coffin was famous and already had a master who was versed in hiding.

Along the way, a group with an impressive aura blocked his path. Given their appearance, they were no ordinary robbers.

“Heavenly Sword has business here, scram.” A heavener shouted at Li Qiye.

“Is this Heavenly Sword’s territory?” Li Qiye asked with a smile.

“It will be soon enough. We are taking True Bear for the Heaven Alliance!” Another shouted.

“Be quiet.” The leader of the group told them.

“Leave, now!” The first repeated.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Kill him, it’s about to start.” The leader ordered.

“Die, brat!” A member of the group unsheathed his saber and slashed powerfully, releasing gales along the path.

Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye and flicked the attacker into a bloody mist.

“Who are you?!” The leader and the others became alarmed, immediately readying their weapon.

“Just a passerby who will be sending you all on a journey as well.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Kill him!” The leader made a seal with both hands and attacked. The others did the same.

Li Qiye flicked his finger again, killing all of them before they could scream.

A few seconds after, horns could be heard from the highest peaks along with constant drumming.

“Who dares to invade our mountain?!” Great demons appeared on the ridges and hills - a winged serpent flew to the air, another tiger rode the winds, and an ape smashed its chest…

Majestic demon auras engulfed the region right away since True Bear was a demon lineage. To its east was Dao Alliance and to the west was Heaven Alliance.

Its name came from a mighty bear demon who became the lord of this area. He was exceptional enough to become a conqueror later.

Initially, this wilderness didn’t have a name and served as a buffer zone between the two opposing alliances. Once it became an actual lineage, it was left in a difficult situation.

“Boom!” A blinding light came from above due to the emergence of a battleship.

“Heaven Alliance’s hounds!” Many demons leaped into the air to attack the intruders.

“Commence the assault!” Well-equipped experts from the ship jumped down to face them. All were at least at the sovereign level.

Elders and ancestors unleashed their treasures and burned the demons.

“Ahhh!” Fire seemed to be the right affinity to deal with demons.

“Clank!” A gigantic sword decapitated three powerful demon monarchs with haste.

A divine seal descended and despite the effort of the demons pushing upward, it still crashed down and exploded. Heavy casualties came from this move alone.

“You’re dead, dogs!” The upper echelon of True Bear fought back.

The ape smashed numerous disciples on the other side to a pulp. The serpent spewed out miasma, reducing the enemies into rotten liquid. The tiger traveled with incredible speed, decapitating Heavenly Sword’s disciples in the blink of an eye.

Alas, they were eventually surrounded by the sovereigns from the other side. The latter possessed the finest weapons and treasures, allowing them to take down demons easily.

Li Qiye stood on a peak and observed the fierce battle, aware that Heavenly Sword was gaining ground. The demons eventually retreated to the highest peak.

“Boom!” A maelstrom appeared with the force of a conqueror.

It pulsed outward and traveled ten thousand miles in the blink of an eye, obliterating the weaker attackers.

The powerful sovereigns roared, pinning their sword into the ground for stability.

“Heavenly Sword!” A voice wielding the power of a conqueror scared the hell out of them.

A bear claw stretched out of the maelstrom and was accompanied by torrents of dao laws. Their targets were the sovereigns.

“Take it down!” The ancestors summoned a gigantic sword again to slash the claw. Despite its power, they couldn’t stop a conqueror.

“Ahh!” The shockwaves from the claw alone killed one sovereign after another.

The number advantage didn’t matter here since the disparity between the two realms was insurmountable. Next came the elders and ancestors falling under the sheer pressure.

Thousands of members died just like that once a conqueror joined the battlefield.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Up above, a sword of ocean formed on top of the battleship. Energy swords rained down and massacred countless demons.
