Chapter 4456: Leaving

After returning from Ravaged Land, Li Qiye summoned the members of Little Diamond.

“Go back from whence you came.” He ordered.

“Sect Master…” Elder Hu and the other disciples were unwilling but they still bowed.

“I’m no longer your sect master, our ties end here. You all can decide on the next sect master later.” He smiled and shook his head.

Little Diamond was only one stop along the way. There was no reluctance and hesitation in leaving. It was time for him to leave Southern Desolace.

Little Diamond didn’t feel the same way. Li Qiye was their hope and star. Losing him was a heavy loss.

“Wh-who should we pick then?” Elder Hu had a hard time reacting.

“Let the sect decide.” He casually said.

“How about…” Elder Hu was experienced enough to come up with a plan. His eyes darted towards Wang Weiqiao.

His bold idea was to let Wang Weiqiao become their next sect master. Although the old man wasn’t strong right now, he had plenty of potential being Li Qiye’s only disciple.

“Weiqiao will follow me to train.” Li Qiye said.

“I understand.” Elder Hu bowed again and became emotional: “We hope to see you again, Sect Master.”

The other disciples bowed as well. At first, they had no love for this sect master who came out of nowhere.

However, as they spent time together, they truly benefitted from his presence. Their horizon broadened during the trip. Moreover, Li Qiye has become the pillar of their sect so they considered him a close senior.

Even a fool could tell that they might not be able to see him again after this departure. Thus, they tried their best to express their gratitude for what he had done.

“Don’t worry, Sir. As long as Dragon is here, Little Diamond will be just fine.” Nine-tailed God interjected.

The members of Little Diamond were moved and bowed again. This promise was truly significant.

Prior to this, Little Diamond had no chance of interacting with Dragon, let alone a legendary figure like the demon god. Now, they have just gained an incredible backer due to this promise. This was also because of Li Qiye.

“It’s time to leave.” Li Qiye told Wang Weiqiao and the rest of the group.

Jian Qingzhu came closer and bowed: “Sir, I do not know how I can ever repay you. If you ever need my service in the future, just say the word.”

Goldbird Monarch also did the same. Li Qiye was the reason why he became the sect master of Dragon.

“I wonder when I’ll be able to meet you again, Sir.” Nine-tailed God also bid farewell by bowing.

“I’ll be staying at Sky Border for a bit so leave it to fate.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Sir, please let me know if I can be of service later.” The demon god said. He naturally knew that although Sky Border was large, it wasn’t enough to hold Li Qiye back forever.

Everyone wanted to see him off but he refused. In the end, only the demon god had the privilege of tagging along for a bit longer.

“Sir, may I ask where you are heading to?” The demon god asked.

“Somewhere in Inner Ruins.” Li Qiye gazed at the horizon.

“Inner Ruins? That is a long journey then.” He said.

Inner Ruins was the most mysterious region in Sky Border. It had numerous strange phenomena and legends. It hasn’t been fully mapped out yet.

“Life is a long journey.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Indeed.” The demon god knew the arduous path ahead for cultivators.

“May I ask for your purpose?” He continued.

“To grab something and settle a matter.” Li Qiye responded. He paused for a bit then said: “Expect the unexpected, the cycle will continue and men do not triumph over calamities.”

This casual advice took the demon god like a storm.

“I will take this to heart, Sir.” He calmed down and bowed while feeling anxious. He had a terrible premonition and wanted to go prepare for the worst.

“You can’t see us off forever, go back.” Li Qiye said.

“Goodbye, Sir. I truly hope we can meet again.” The demon god responded and watched the duo disappear into the horizon.

“Master, how should I train during our trip?” Wang Weiqiao asked along the way. He knew that it was not time to relax.

“What are you missing?” Li Qiye answered with a question.

“Well…” Weiqiao pondered and said: “My cultivation is shallow, the same with my knowledge. I suppose I am missing many things.”

“You’re correct, but the things you’re missing the most right now are experience and practice.” Li Qiye said.

“Right.” Weiqiao agreed. Though he was the oldest member of Little Diamond, he had no experience in the cultivation world until Li Qiye came along.

“So what should I do then, Master?” Weiqiao asked again.

“Are you prepared to face death during your training?” Li Qiye stared at him.

“Face death?” Weiqiao shuddered.

Little Diamond was a tiny sect with no methods and treasures for life prolongment. An ordinary disciple like him living for so long was already impressive. Nonetheless, having to face death was still daunting.

“I’ve thought of this before, Master.” Weiqiao said softly: “I have no problem dying a natural death since I’ve been blessed with longevity already. But to die in battle or a disaster? I’m just a worm in the grand scheme of things and am not mentally prepared.”Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com
