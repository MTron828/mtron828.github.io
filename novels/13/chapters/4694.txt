Chapter 4695: Forsaken

The head of a Myriad Sovereign was taken out from just one punch. This embarrassed everyone who praised Wild Paragon, singing songs of him becoming a second Dao Sanqian and that killing Li Qiye would be easy.

He was also running for his life in fear. The sudden reversal robbed the crowd of words and made them gasp in astonishment.

Li Qiye still hasn’t used a treasure yet. That was just a physical punch.

“Where do you think you’re going?” Li Qiye smiled and followed in the same direction.

One opponent was running like a dog without a master with Li Qiye calmly following right behind him. Checkk new 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters at nov𝒆lbin(.)com

The crowd watched intensely. One big shot said: “How terrifying, do the conquerors have a chance?”

“He is most likely stronger than them, but this is only taking into account of personal power.” An ancestor responded.

“Don’t tell me he’s the future dao lord.” Someone else murmured.

By this point, a fair number of cultivators believed that Li Qiye was actually stronger than the five conquerors.

“Do you see an alliance forming because of Li Qiye?” A young disciple boldly speculated.

“That’s certainly plausible.” A senior said while others contemplated.

If Li Qiye was superior by a large margin, the five conquerors might team up to eliminate Li Qiye. Otherwise, the competition seemed hopeless for them.

They then thought about the behemoths at play here - True Immortal, Three Thousand Dao, Divine Dragon… Five behemoths would team up to suppress Li Qiye.

Even the mighty Li Qiye couldn’t possibly beat this alliance, the same applied to the rest of the world.

Meanwhile, True Immortal Young Emperor observed the fleeing youth with a heavy heart.

He had a good idea of Wild Paragon’s power but this wasn’t enough to force out Li Qiye’s true ability. Who knows if the guy even used thirty percent of his power in the battle?

Under this assumption, the guy would be a terrifying opponent. None of the five conquerors could have replicated this task when using only thirty percent power.

“How did he do it?” The saintess whispered, failing to analyze Li Qiye.

“A terrifying opponent.” The young emperor replied with a serious expression.

She nodded in response and felt immense pressure. A battle between them was inevitable; the outcome remained uncertain.

“Please go invite Five-sun King and the others.” He made up his mind.

The saintess left to carry out the order without saying anything.

“This person is unfathomable.” Shen Juntian was invested in the pursuit as well.

“Senior Brother, you can still take him on.” Godwhip Princess was shocked to see Li Qiye’s punch but she maintained confidence in Shen Juntian’s probability of success.

“I can fight him, yes, but winning? Unsure.” He smiled.

“No one can defeat you, Senior Brother.” The princess insisted.

He shook his head and said: “It’s too early to say that. Everything about Li Qiye is a mystery but I do want to fight him, it’s rare to have an opponent of this level.” His eyes became determined after saying this.

“You’re itching for a spar with Young Noble Li, Senior Brother?” Paramount Scion asked.

“A spar is not enough to see his true power. This requires a fight to the death, that’s when the truth is shown.” Using kingdom-toppling to describe Shen Juntian’s appearance was appropriate.

“Do not fight right now.” A fourth cultivator interjected: “We lack intelligence on this person, observe on the sideline instead.”

Shen Juntian followed the direction of the voice and saw a middle-aged man standing there.

“First Brother.” He bowed, having great respect for Speargrasp.

“First Brother.” Godwhip and Paramount did the same.

“Heed my warning.” Speargrasp repeated.

To which Shen Juntian responded: “The dao lord path is perilous, constantly testing one’s courage. If I’m not prepared to die, I can’t become a dao lord.”

“Knowledge and strategy are also a part of this path.” Speargrasp responded: “Dao lords aren’t impulsive and reckless. Wisdom is required.”

“I understand, First Brother.” Shen Juntian smiled and said: “Nonetheless, a battle between us is inevitable. Fighting him seriously is the only thing that will satiate my thirst for the dao.”

There was no doubt that Li Qiye’s power had stimulated Shen Juntian’s desire to fight.

“You got this, Senior Brother.” The princess didn’t hide her admiration.

Paramount Scion, on the other hand, didn’t say anything. Although he was on Shen Juntian’s side, he lacked the same confidence in his victory.

Wild Paragon mustered all of his strength to run. Alas, he couldn’t lose Li Qiye. This was utterly humiliating since he threw away his face and dignity.

“Boom!” A figure suddenly landed and blocked Li Qiye’s path.

“Is it Five-sun King?” Spectators looked around.
