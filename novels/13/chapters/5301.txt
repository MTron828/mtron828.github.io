Chapter 5302: Paragon

The black fog resembled an endless ocean - a world of eternal darkness and damnation.

Inside were flashing lightning bolts - not the ones seen in heavenly tribulations. They seemed to be the marks of this dark world, leaving indelible scars behind. Since there was nothing but darkness, the spatial scars were the only way to tell direction.

The dark force could turn anyone into its slave including the most magnificent gods. However, a balance existed at the very core of the darkness - another supreme power preventing it from spreading.

This second force could bring peace to myriad worlds, completely unshakable. Not even time itself could erase it.

Alas, the darkness continued to erode this power, wanting to release its wrath against the entire cosmo fully. Utter damnation seemed inevitable.

Li Qiye activated his primordial light while walking through the darkness. This affinity had existed since the start of the world, dating back to the primordial chaos.

It spanned from the past to the future, acting like a guiding lamp through this darkness. Therefore, the corrosive force couldn’t get close to him.

He made his way through one dimension after another, surpassing the chaotic darkness and eventually reaching the source.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

He saw a man whose back alone was larger than the worlds themselves. The man suddenly turned around and revealed a pair of eyes engulfed in darkness. The dark rays coming from them could devour all existence.

“Stop, return to your former self.” Li Qiye spoke and sent out runic words, attempting to stabilize the man and clear his mind.

“Boom!” The runes floated around him and an immortal light erupted. The all-devouring darkness was instantly suppressed, giving time for the man to regain his sanity and true self.

His original form showed itself once more - the very center of the universe. The celestial bodies trembled in submission. Emperors and gods from all realms bowed in reverence.

With a mere raise of his hand, he could change the course of history. The word “invincible” was created solely for him.

This was no stranger to Li Qiye. However, there was an eye-catching difference - a palmprint deep on the man’s chest, seemingly having shattered it previously.

It was so dark that it appeared translucent, containing the purest dark essences. Staring at it was no different than staring at a bottomless abyss; the souls would be pulled in instantly. This was the source of darkness and the fog.

Dark strands from the deep wound oozed out, intending on corroding and devouring the man’s flesh and blood.

Upon closer inspection, there were certain dao marks embedded into the dark palmprint. They belonged to supreme emperors and monarchs, intending to seal the darkness to stop the devouring process.

Li Qiye scowled after seeing the injury. The two then fixed gazes and Li Qiye entered his mind. The divine intents and his original power remained. However, there was only one soul left.

“Two souls are gone, you must recall them in order to become yourself again. That is the only way to heal this injury.” Li Qiye said.

The man sat down, causing worlds to move in the same direction. Li Qiye sat down as well.

“They’ve made their choices. Leave them be, they will return if they wish to.” The man spoke calmly despite the constant struggle with the darkness.

“The souls separating is an abnormal occurrence.” Li Qiye shook his head.

The man chuckled and raised his hand, summoning the best fragrant tea for the two.

“I was ambushed and only managed to suppress it with everyone’s help.” The man took a sip and continued: “Later on, the girl destroyed her own dao and started over again, coming up with a better method of suppression. Unfortunately, it wasn’t at the everlasting level so my souls scattered. We managed to seal the hand still but not my souls.” The man said.

“She was too hasty. Even with anima and the innate primordial dao fruit, the dao heart needs to be firm as well before removing this technique.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Yes, she did lack patience and restraint. Nonetheless, everyone else remained and continued to suppress the seal.” The man said.

“Just need the two souls back and you can do it yourself.” Li Qiye said.

The man chuckled in response. His charismatic smile would outmatch even the most handsome man in the world.

“They’re me. If they don’t want to return, it means that I am unwilling.” He said.

“That’s right, you’ve endured so much already so they do not want to return.” Li Qiye nodded.

“And it will continue.” The two were satisfied to be able to sit here and drink together after such a long period.

“I might be able to remove it so that the souls will return.” Li Qiye stared at the palmprint.

“It’s not that simple, and no rush. The situation looks fine with you here.” The man shook his head.

“I don’t want to take the blame for this any longer.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Eras have passed in the blink of an eye yet I still endure with this broken body. It is still of use so what’s a little longer?” He said.

“They kept on scolding me for putting you in this situation. Now, I don’t know if it was my fault or if you made me the scapegoat.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but laugh.
