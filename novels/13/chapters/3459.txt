The atmosphere changed after the saintess’ identity was revealed. Everyone including her three opponents became frozen.

Some stared at her then secretly shot a glance towards Li Qiye. She seemed to be with Li Qiye all the time despite the engagement with Bai Jianchan. The whole thing felt a little strange.

“What do we say to this?” Someone murmured. This pertained to two powerful sects so they didn’t dare to run their mouth.

After all, they could end up offending both sects and that wouldn’t end well. This was doubly true for Yin Yang Gate.

On the contrary, Skylight Princess felt more at ease than before as if she had expected this.

“Greetings, Saintess.” Wu Zhongtian cupped his fist towards Pearlstone.

The godchild and the first prince also did the same, albeit with an awkward expression.

The two sides couldn’t fight anymore. Zhongtian was Baichan’s right-hand man so he couldn’t quite fight his boss’ fiancee.

As for the other two, the situation didn’t allow so, not to mention that they might have lost anyway.

They had ancestors as their backing right now but this was the territory of Ancestral. They were the ones truly in charge.

“Sister Shi, since you’re here, why don’t we work together for the treasury?” The princess ignored the quarrel earlier and extended an invitation.

People thought that she was being awfully magnanimous. Competition between them was inevitable in the future yet the princess still invited the saintess? Many thought that they wouldn’t be as generous.

“No, the young master will decide.” The saintess smiled and shook her head.

Her attitude shocked the crowd. Earlier, she was under disguise when walking around with Li Qiye. Everything changed the moment she revealed her identity. Nonetheless, their relationship seemed to be real.

If the saintess had some type of relationship with another man, this would reflect badly on both her and Ancestral. However, she didn’t seem to mind at all and even went as far as still calling Li Qiye “young master”, ready to obey his orders.

The godchild and the first prince naturally didn’t like this comment so they scowled.

First, the guy had Dragon-phoenix Maiden as his backer. Now, Pearlstone Saintess too? This brat had special luck with women, seemingly able to win their favor wherever he went.

Wu Zhongtian’s glare at Li Qiye intensified, the same with his murderous intent. A while ago, it was a matter of personal vendetta. Now, it became more than that. This guy would be a threat for Bai Jianchan so he must be eliminated.

On the other hand, the princess stared at Li Qiye; her eyes shifted slightly. She tilted her head, seemingly pondering.

“Why does the saintess think so highly of him? You see anything?” The jealous followers of the maiden couldn’t restrain their emotions.

“Right, what’s attractive about him?” Another who didn’t like Li Qiye said.

The saintess could actually be considered the number one beauty of the famous trio yet she still treated Li Qiye in a special manner.

“Okay, maybe he’s capable and powerful, he still can’t compare to Bai Jianchan.” One more added, confused.

In their opinion, Li Qiye might actually be a genius hiding his abilities. Nonetheless, nothing about him could ever top Bai Jianchan - the true heaven’s favorite in the north.

“That’s fine.” The princess also extended an invitation towards Li Qiye with a smile: “If your friend wishes to tag along, we can go together and give him a part of the treasury as well.”

The listeners couldn’t believe it and became more impressed with her style.

“An amazing woman like her deserves someone like Young Lord Bai.” One expert commented.

Anyone else would have used this opportunity to criticize Pearlstone Saintess for having a questionable relationship with another man. This was the best way to ruin her opponent’s reputation.

The princess didn’t do that at all and even showed kindness towards Li Qiye.

Pearlstone Saintess only smiled and stood quietly for Li Qiye to answer.

Li Qiye released the soil in his hand and patted his palms together. He stood up and stretched before answering: “You all are overthinking about this treasure matter.”

The prince’s group snorted after hearing this. Finnd 𝒏ew chapters on n𝒐ve/lbi𝒏(.)com

“You have another idea, Young Noble?” The princess remained calm. This style of hers naturally made others want to follow her.

“No idea, it’s just that this treasury is out of your reach. Return from whence you came since it’s getting late. Go take a bath then sleep.” Li Qiye looked comfortable after stretching and lazily said.

His response was considered arrogant and impolite.

“Ridiculous.” Others became indignant for the princess since she had won them over.

“So ungrateful and blind.” One snorted.

The young geniuses found this even more acceptable. The godchild retorted with a stern glare: “Li, what are you trying to say? Her Highness is being generous yet you want to monopolize the treasure? Know your place.”

“So what?” Li Qiye shook his head: “The treasury isn’t meant for your group, just forget about it and leave.”

“Hmph, you need to think about whether you have the abilities to take the treasury first. You alone have no chance of obtaining it, stop dreaming.” The first prince joined in.

“That’s right, know your place.” Some of the audience shouted.

By this point, the alliance of Yin Yang, Skylight, and Firmaments was firmly in charge. Not to mention monopolizing the treasury, just getting a share was difficult.

“Is that so?” Li Qiye had a half-smile as he stared at the two.
