Chapter 5308: Anyone Else Wishes To Entertain Me?Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

The victims were once dominating existences. Their death caused spectators to tremble in fear.

Although they weren’t at the apex, they weren’t far from it either. Alas, their final outcome was one of helplessness and despair.

Anyone who witnessed this in person would be traumatized forever. Even the big shots such as conquerors and dragon lords would have nightmares about it.

Worst of all, Li Qiye didn’t use his own merit law from start to finish. He utilized Immortal Piercer like an iron chain before roasting everyone with Lantern’s flames.

Three separate forces surrounded Lesser Firmament for an inquisition. Unfortunately, it ended so rapidly without Lesser Firmament getting involved.

Silence took over - Illumination Conqueror, Swordsea Dao Lord, and Supreme had no response. They clearly had qualms about participating in the battle.

There were only two lucky survivors - Immortal Emperor Ming Du who ran at the start and surprisingly enough, Ferocity who ran right after commanding his men to march forward.

Everyone always brought up his arrogance and love for battle. This didn’t seem to be the case.

“Is anything true about Ferocity’s reputation?” Many wondered. They heard about how he would always fight regardless of who the opponent was. Now, he seemed more like a coward who would run at the first sign of trouble.

They had more sympathy for Immortal Emperor Ming Du who did the same. After all, despite being an Immortal Emperor, he remained humble and polite throughout the conflict.

In fact, there was one other survivor - Jue Xian’er. She didn’t actively antagonize Li Qiye and even stood on the sideline after her Immortal Piercer was taken away from her.

Her merciless reputation couldn’t be questioned for she had proven it many times in the past. However, she didn’t try to seize her weapon back and remained a neutral observer.

The truth was that she really wanted to teach Li Qiye a lesson. Alas, she was suppressed from the very start.

Immortal Piercer had never failed her before, always capable of sealing the fruits and the true fate. This allowed her to kill conquerors and dao lords. The issue was the difficulty in controlling it.

Ever since her dao debut, Immortal Piercer has been her primary weapon. Despite training with it for so long, sealing an opponent at the start remained challenging.

Therefore, she exercised caution despite possessing this unbeatable weapon. Using it meant expending a considerable amount of energy and vitality. Moreover, she lacked true expertise, unable to focus on both offense and defense.

If she could master it just like Li Qiye, she would be able to fight apex cultivators such as Supreme and All-things Dao Lord.

After witnessing Li Qiye in action, she started wondering whether he was the original master of the weapon while she had only picked it up on the street afterward. Thus, she knew better than to attack him carelessly lest risk dying to her own weapon.

This was proven to be the correct choice since he had no interest in Immortal Piercer and tossed it back to her.

She stood there in a daze after catching her beloved treasure. Everyone in this world desired Immortal Piercer due to its frightening offensive ability. Nonetheless, fear prevented most from maneuvering against her.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, didn’t give a damn and tossed it away like a piece of scrap metal.

She didn’t know how to feel about the situation, whether to feel insulted or merely astounded.

The remaining members of the crowd couldn’t believe this outrageous act of generosity.

“Hmm, I feel a bit better. Anyone else wishes to entertain me?” Li Qiye looked around and asked.

No one dared to answer. Is this a joke? You killed conquerors and dragon lords just because your mood was foul? Do we have to send you our entire sect to kill for entertainment?

The losses suffered just now were serious even for the behemoths such as Heaven, Divine, and Azure. They didn’t want to send anyone else to their death.
