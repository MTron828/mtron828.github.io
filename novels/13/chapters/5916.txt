Chapter 5916: I Am Immortal

“This gives me the creep, Sacred Teacher.” Present joked.

“Just some child’s plays, that’s all.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“My master brought this up before, becoming your captive is a fate worse than death.” Present said.

“You make it sound as if I’m a heinous villain or a ruthless butcher.” Li Qiye rubbed his nose.

“We know who we are best.” Present said: “And I don’t blame you for wanting to dissect me since I want to end your epoch. I’m sure you’ve been harboring this thought a long time now toward all three stones.”

“Well.” Li Qiye chuckled: “I might not find what I’m looking for in the stones. Since you cannot perceive or know it, I won’t get any useful information since it had left you behind.”

“Yes, Sacred Teacher, I only know that it is in the mortal world, nothing more.” Present took its time before answering.

“Not in Three Immortals then or you and your master would know.” Li Qiye smiled.

“We couldn’t find it.” Present said: “Seems like the three stones will disappoint you but either way, you will have to find the other two.”

“No.” Li Qiye shook his head: “Your master didn’t tell you the truth, I only need one.”

“One?” Present didn’t expect this.

“Because one doesn’t matter and you aren’t that significant. Only the final one is different.” Li Qiye said.

“Future.” Present understood.

“Past and Present are already available, only Future is unknown. That is why your master didn’t tell you everything, not the actual reasons.” Li Qiye said.

“Again with the psychological warfare.” Present said.

“Do I need to do so when I will slay you and you will never get to meet your master again?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I see.” Present admitted the difficulty in another meeting.

“When he doesn’t want to, you will be able to meet him.” Li Qiye added.

“Right.” Present thought about it and agreed: “But I found you, Sacred Teacher, that’s enough for me to accomplish my first goal.”

“Fine, I will give you a chance to break the night.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Sacred Teacher, please ready your weapon. You need something good to not leave any trace behind.” Present said.

“Few want to die like you do. Since I’ve agreed, I will make sure that it’s a clean death.” Li Qiye said and grasped the hilt of the sword tied to his back.

“Incredible, where did you get this, Sacred Teacher?” Present couldn’t help but praise.

“Someone entrusted it to me and you should feel honored to be killed by it.” Li Qiye said. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“This immortal sword will cut me down cleanly, it is precisely what I seek.” Present rejoiced after seeing this.

“Let us begin then.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Now!” Present shouted, summoning time.

The flows included the past, present, and future. Time started flowing after the emergence of the high heaven.

One epoch was born and destroyed in the endless cycle. The most brilliant ones couldn’t escape the inevitable.

The future stretched farther like a surging river with no end in sight. However, all of them converged together in the present.

Suddenly, the present swallowed the other two timelines like a colossal beast. Memories and hope dissipated, leaving behind only the present.

“Clank!” A saber slash came out of nowhere. It had devoured the past and the present, channeling their power together with the present.

Its destination had no affinities left, only the saber. Since the timelines were no longer present, neither did Li Qiye.

“Buzz.” His past, present, and future gradually disappeared.

“No more...” A whisper could be heard as everything dispersed including the saber.

“A pity.” Li Qiye smiled: “I alone am immortal.”

“Clank!” With the mantra said, he unleashed an immortal slash crossing through the temporal trinity.

It bypassed time and caught up to the all-ender saber, severing it and allowing the three timelines to flow normally again.

It stretched from the lowest point of the mortal world to the supreme high heaven, leaving behind a long-lasting arc.

It cut through Present with flawless precision, like an egg being split into two with a single stroke while showing no crack or fragments. Nevertheless, the yolk still managed to flow out.

Only two identical empty shells were left behind - a complete death.
