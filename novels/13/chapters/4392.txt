Chapter 4393: Three Birds Mantra

The crowd didn’t expect Jian Qingzhu to be given a reward from the palace. This was a big deal; any disciple capable of this would be heavily groomed by the three branches.

In fact, this was close enough for her to be appointed as the next successor. If they needed to make a decision right now, the elders would certainly pick her.

Impressively enough, this great achievement was kept under wrap. Even the seniors had no idea, a testament to her lack of ego.

Anyone else would have tried their best to make this known throughout the sect. After all, being highly valued by the seniors would pave a smooth road for the future.

Thus, the experts here were startled at first then after thinking about it, they were impressed by her personality.

“Junior Sister, your restraint is admirable. Let’s start our duel then.” Celestial Tiger took a deep breath.

“Yes, Senior Brother.” She posed her saber horizontally in front.

He focused his gaze and raised his spear forward. The white tip could pierce any heart with haste.

“Clank!” As he channeled his power, the light of the spear surged brightly and intimidated spectators.

“Raa!” Its ringing resembled the cry of a dragon. People had the illusion that he was wielding a furious dragon, not a spear.

Qingzhu didn’t change her stance. She held her saber in front of her and looked to be full of openings. However, they appeared to be traps for her opponent.

A stalemate ensued because both sides tried to search for an opening in order to deliver a decisive blow.

“Activate!” After a while, Celestial Tiger finally roared and released his palace, one by one.

“Boom!” A total of twelve appeared along with two grand dao. They coursed around him like a galaxy.

“Two-dao sovereign.” Some had expected this but were still shaken.

He no longer held back and let his aura run wild, freezing weaker cultivators in the process. They found themselves being stuck in a storm. Drowning in his dao power was inevitable.

“That’s Dragon for you.” An outsider from a smaller sect commented: “Even a young disciple is still a sovereign. That’s why we can’t compete.”

Heavenly Sovereigns were considered to be standing at the peak. Few in the entire world could reach this realm despite a lifetime of effort. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

Not to mention a small sect, the great powers’ sovereigns were all seniors and ancestors. Dragon, on the other hand, had sovereigns among the young generation.

“This is why they dare to compete with Lion’s Roar.” Another added.

“Buzz.” She also activated her vitality. This resulted in a visual phenomenon of a divine luan flying up into the air.

“Screech!” Next came the image of a screeching phoenix. It spread its wings and its flames surrounded Jian Qingzhu.

“Three Birds Mantra.” A spectator shouted. This was a secret art of Phoenix Ground. It could boost other merit laws in an unrestrained manner.

This was an indicator of how serious Phoenix Ground was in training her.

Celestial Tiger was undeterred. The dragon-like spear suddenly had pieces removed, revealing the draconic scales beneath.

While he changed the shape of his spear, she took the initiative to attack and swung her saber. The slash was rather simple, akin to an easy calligraphic session.

However, because of the mantra and the phoenix flames, the slash carried the power of dao elucidation. It could solve grand dao and break through defenses.

“Tyrannical Dragon!” He roared and thrust his spear forward, releasing a wild dragon with its claws raised.

It pierced through the slash and aimed straight for her throat. He was not holding back.

Meanwhile, spectators became frozen because they could see his superiority after just one thrust.

Instead of panicking, she relaxed her body and leaped into the air for another simple slash.

It managed to repel the spear while adding an indiscernible shockwave towards her opponent’s head.

“Rising Dragon!” He gripped his spear tightly and swung it upward, commanding the tyrannical dragon to shoot up instead.

The audience felt the world being lifted up from his momentum. This saved him from the slash but nonetheless, he staggered four steps backward.

“So strong!” Everyone took a deep breath.

Most believed that he was stronger than her due to his fame and battle experience. Alas, he was at a disadvantage during the last exchanges. This caught all of them by surprise.

“How is she so strong?” One disciple murmured.

“She looks like the champion of the young generation.” An outsider commented.

“She gained a fortune from the palace for a reason. It’s just that she has always kept a low profile.” Someone else praised.
