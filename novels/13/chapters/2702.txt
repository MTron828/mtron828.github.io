Majestic Desert Splendor

“Buzz.” Li Qiye and the emperor repeated the process countless times before they lit up.

Space fluctuated and became similar to a shiny mirror from congealing. The reflection inside was that of a majestic and boundless world, consisting of numerous mountains and an uncountable amount of sects. One wouldn’t be able to travel this expanse in one lifetime.

Though separated by one dimension, they could still sense the vast power there - pure beyond belief. This world was above any other, causing people to think of a particular phrase - good land gives birth to great heroes.

Yes, this world had plenty of talents, prodigies, and masters. Its name was Immortal Lineage.

“Such an impressive project.” The emperor stood at the end of the path and reflected: “The creator of these paths is far superior to a progenitor.” Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

These paths connecting worlds couldn’t be made by one powerful emperor or progenitor. It required many of them working together across many generations.

However, who had such influence to gather so many masters in one place? None came up in her mind.

“Go in.” Li Qiye only chuckled. This topic was too ancient. He couldn’t explain the mysteries behind this old era with just one or two words.

The two exchanged glances and had the same idea. They walked forward at the same time and entered the congealed space.

This mirror-like area had ripples from the contact. The two disappeared into it then the mirror went away as well.

The duo entered Immortal Lineage at the same time and took a deep breath. Even a regular person could tell the difference between Imperial and Immortal Lineage.

This worldly energy here was denser and richer. Upon closer inspection, one would find another difference. The energy in this place had a touch of “immortal” energy. Of course, it might be nothing like that but Imperial definitely didn’t have this same affinity.

The stronger masters or talented prodigies found it easier to harmonize with the grand dao in this world. This feeling should only happen when they were inside their own system.

However, even an outsider here felt this harmonization. It meant that cultivating in Immortal was easier compared to Imperial. The grand dao was closer to people so they could understand its profundity with less effort.

Because of this, strong Eternals and emperors would always ascend to Immortal because the lower worlds no longer satisfied their cultivation requirements. This world allowed them to take the next step forward on their dao and break through.

“Immortal Lineage.” The emperor quietly said. Though Imperial was her home, Immortal was indeed more suitable to stimulate their potential.

Staying back in Imperial for powerful beings would be akin to having shackles. People only stayed behind if they had no other choice or there was something worth it for them to stay.

“Dao Brother, is this where we say goodbye?” The emperor asked.

“Boom!” Suddenly, the sky seemingly exploded and startled her.

“I only wanted to invite you to my grotto, does heaven really need to send thunder?” She joked.

“Rumble!” However, more deafening explosions occurred.

The two looked up and saw chaotic bolts twisting in the sky, not similar to the usual thunderstorm.

These bolts arranged themselves like wires in the sky with currents channeling through them.

“What is that?” Her vast knowledge failed her this time.

She never saw anything like this before. These bolts and currents turned the sky into a world of lightning. It nearly encompassed all of Immortal Lineage.

She wasn’t the only stunned spectators since this phenomenon encompassed the whole world.

Not to mention the billions and billions of mortals, even the invincible emperors and progenitors found this astonishing.

“What’s going on?” These experts became horrified.

“Is... this the end of the world? A calamity is descending.” One of them stammered.

“Why is this happening?” Old Eternals were in disbelief. The scene of an emperor proving his dao still didn’t reach this level of horror.

The birth of a progenitor would only bring a small-scale heavenly tribulation. However, this lightning storm covered all of Immortal Lineage, seemingly turning it into a prison.

“Creak...” A heavy creaking sounded as if a great gate above was slowly closing. Sure enough, the sky suddenly turned dark.

“Why is there something like this above?” Everyone became confused, progenitors included.

“This is a grand phenomenon. We need to run right now, a spectacle like this will have something ferocious after it.” One emperor felt his heart skipping a beat and shielded his presence while still speaking before running to a hiding spot.

One progenitor took out a divination table to take a better look. “Boom!” Alas, his table instantly exploded.

“The machination of heavens is in chaos...” His expression soured as he gravely said: “Damn it! Something terrible is coming, who did this?!” He also chose to hide.

In fact, the encroaching darkness made the truly powerful and knowledgeable masters run away. They had no idea what was going on so they exercised prudence.

“What is happening?” True Emperor Jiu Ning was infinitely close to the progenitorial realm.

In fact, she was suppressing herself because she wanted to become an immortal-level one from the first attempt. Alas, she couldn’t calculate the current development.

She turned towards Li Qiye.

His eyes narrowed as he derived the myriad dao. His expression darkened as a result: “Not good, someone is trying to calculate the heaven’s will!” [1]
