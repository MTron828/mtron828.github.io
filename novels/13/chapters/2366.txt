The severing of the spear and the falcon god’s hands happened in the blink of an eye, bereft of visual fanfare and discernible techniques.

Blood ran down the blade of the sword and fell to the mud, drop by drop. Thanks to this red liquid, people could actually see his sword now - the blade was as thin as a cicada’s wing with an unimaginable sharpness.

This was Crystal, a technique from Finality Sword, meant to be unstoppable with its edge.

The falcon god’s spear was amazing and made from rare stars but it still failed to stop the slash. In fact, it resembled tofu during the process.

If it wasn’t for his fast reaction and retreat, he would have faltered as well. Nevertheless, the amputation still frightened the crowd. Some twitched and felt nauseous.

“Buzz.” He recreated his severed hands in just a short time.

At his level, as long as he was alive, he could recreate any body part - even the entire thing, so just two hands was no big deal.

Nevertheless, his expression was unsightly as he stared intensely at the guy. Despite being an Eternal, the first exchange left him shamed and weaponless.

Meanwhile, the spectators heaved a sigh of relief, especially the ancestors.

This wasn’t about them being on the falcon god’s side, but he served as the representative of their generation to a certain extent, being an Eternal and all. If their Eternal couldn’t defeat a youth like Li Qiye, it would leave their entire era in despair. It would be time for them to run back to their lair and retire for the future would belong to the youths.

Because of this, they were rather relieved to see the falcon god ready for battle once more. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

His eyes shifted towards the crystal sword, vexed, because he couldn’t see through it.

Unlike the others, he got a good view of the slash and noticed its effective simplicity. He has never seen a slash like this before, not believing that such a sharp sword could be created from existing materials.

Finally, his body shifted into retreat, not to run but just to gain the right amount of distance. He uttered: “Amazing, but this doesn’t mean that you are invincible. I will not stop until I kill you.”

Li Qiye chuckled: “You alone? That’s daydreaming. He needs to join too.” His eyes turned towards Mu Shaochen.

Mu Shaochen didn’t try to run. He calmly stood there, seemingly thinking of a way to defeat his foe. His eyes then flashed with an epiphany.

Li Qiye naturally saw this so he decided to give the youth a chance.

“Senior, let us fight together to take this fiend down.” Shaochen told the falcon god.

“Wait until I see what he can do. If I were to lose, then you can join, Virtuous Nephew.” The falcon god refused, eyes still fixated on Li Qiye.

He was naturally prideful; a being that had swept through Myriad. There was no way he could swallow the vexation of defeat so he needed to try again.

“Alright, I’ll wait for your victory.” Shaochen laughed heartily, but one could easily tell from his expression that he had no confidence in the falcon god.

He began scheming once more. Peace and the fruition of his plans would never come until this guy was dead.

“Junior, get ready to see my supreme art!” The falcon god roared.

Li Qiye remained nonchalant: “Make sure to go all out. I don’t want to kill you by accident before you can show off your best move.”

The frustrated god didn’t know what to say. He has never met someone who looked down on him to this level. Even Dracoform Martial God exercised politeness and civility before him.

Nevertheless, no one on the battlefield considered Li Qiye to be arrogant now. He was qualified to speak in this manner after cutting down the god’s hands earlier.

The falcon god took a deep breath before taking out a treasure, a large drum. Its frame seemed to be made from bound divine wood pieces by a structural frame consisting of ancient metals. The top head was created by the skin of primal serpents.

The two drumsticks were even more impressive, as white as snow and made from unknown bones. They surged with thunder, just one strike brought about this destructive affinity.

“Drum of the Thunder God!” An ancestor recognized this treasure and took a deep breath: “I heard it was left behind by Cloudcrossing Ancestor, not actually made by him but he found it in an ancient legacy ruin.”

“Bump!” The falcon god gently beat the drum once.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” So many experts helplessly fell to the ground; their soul seemingly left the body.

This was only a test. A real drumming session would have immense power.

“The timbre is good at least.” Li Qiye smiled and said.

The falcon god naturally didn’t like Li Qiye treating his mighty treasure as a musical instrument. This was looking down on their ancestral legacy!

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” The falcon god went all out with a torrent of beats.

A massive sound wave resembling a storm instantly rendered the nearby mountains to dust. The slow cultivators became mists of blood.

When this sound wave struck Li Qiye, his top shirt turned to dust as well. However, his body was unreasonably tough and could withstand this power without any issue. The falcon god intensified his pace and power. The drum continued to ravage the entire area.

“Boom!” Finally, even the stars in the sky exploded just like fireworks.
