Chapter 4126: That Easy

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

“It wasn’t hard at all. I kicked an old man down there and the legacy just opened by itself.” Li Qiye casually responded, prompting the group to ruminate.

They heard this story before but remained skeptical. After all, no one else in history had done it and the opening method sounded ridiculous.

Nonetheless, they didn’t doubt that it had actually happened since Li Qiye was the main character in this story.

Snowcloud Princess felt the same way. She believed in his recollection but refused to attribute it to mere luck.

“It couldn’t have been luck, Young Noble Li.” She stared at him with a half-smile filled with implication.

She checked numerous records documenting the experiments at the legacy before. With that, she absolutely knew that luck was not a factor. The issue here was getting Li Qiye to reveal his actual method. It had nothing to do with kicking an elder from Sea Emperor down there.

Perhaps others didn’t spot the underlying mysteries or Li Qiye performed something special back then. She found it regrettable that she wasn’t there in person.

“How do I know, that’s just how I opened it. Seems simple and easy enough to me.” He played coy and said.

It was hard to argue against Li Qiye because he actually managed a feat that had eluded dao lords. Worst of all, his nonchalant attitude annoyed the crowd.

“I spent 3.6 million on that legacy…” A big shot complained. All of his money belonged to Li Qiye now.

“I spent 5.8 million, I’m still in debt over it.” An ancestor added.

In order to become rich overnight, people threw their money into it only to return empty-handed. Some even went into debt. Now, they have to endure listening to Li Qiye’s bullsh*t.

“I heard All in all, Hundred-flower Sect spent fifty million, they’re broke now. Their sect master back then was so confident too.” One cultivator said.

Some experts spent thousands of years researching the plate and became confident, thinking that they knew everything about it. Misery awaited them next.

“Hmph, just a blind cat coming across a dead mouse.” Illusory Princess interjected.

“True, I guess I really am the heaven’s favorite.” Li Qiye ignored her insult: “I can do whatever and still win. Sigh, you all cultivated so hard your entire life while pinching coins. All of that only to still be poor. As for me, I have no cultivation to speak or and virtually zero dao comprehension, but my luck alone turned me into the richest in the world. Life is truly unfair.”

He seemed to be asking for it. The crowd glared at him with both jealousy and hatred. His words struck them where it hurts.

In their mind, Li Qiye wasn’t worthy of the Preeminent Legacy. He had no talent and power to speak of, no determination and ambition either…

Calling such a cultivator “trash” wouldn’t be an exaggeration. But now, just a casual reward of his exceeded their lifelong savings.

“Cultivators rely on their own power. Our fate is our own, not the heaven’s. We don’t need luck, power alone can grasp the universe.” The princess uttered coldly.

“Well said, Your Highness!” Applauses and praises popped across the floor.

“Yes, cultivators change their fate with power! She’s so articulate!”

“Wow, amazing.” Li Qiye clapped as well before adding: “Too bad you’re still poor.”

The princess’ rage only grew the more she talked to Li Qiye.

“Am just telling the truth, you can see that my wealth is in the trillions while what you have is insignificant. Even your sect isn’t as rich as me. An idiot still knows better than to compete with me yet you still tried. Know your place and stop seeking further embarrassment.” Li Qiye suddenly became sharp.

Cultivators usually underestimated the power of wealth. However, Li Qiye’s case was extreme. His own power was nothing but his legion right now was comparable to any great sect’s.

Why were people afraid of Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel while feeling disdain towards Li Qiye? The guy had beaten Ninth and taken down Dark Dragon Island not long ago. This should have been enough to prove his capabilities.

Nonetheless, the princess still disagreed: “External items don’t matter to cultivators…” Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Stop lying to yourself, is it that hard to admit that you’re poor?” He interrupted her with a hand wave.

“You!” Being the junior sister of Void Saintess of Nine-wheel, she has grown accustomed to praises and love. Therefore, she couldn’t tolerate Li Qiye’s insults.
