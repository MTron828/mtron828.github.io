Chapter 5259: ImitationL𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

Suppression had the potential of becoming an apex conqueror. Thus, caring about a city and position seemed beneath someone of his stature - no different from mortals struggling for political supremacy in the court.

Now, they understood why his goal - to understand the metal giants and other secrets. Despite being unable to control them, he still figured out other mysteries due to his impeccable talent and audacity.

He came up with a method to connect a portal to Redflood World and harness its power.

“Let’s see how much you have learned then.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Good.” Suppression didn’t have a chance to test it now until now so this was his first test.

“Rumble!” His dao fruits exuded boundless chaos true energy, culminating in an armor around him.

The entire domain became agitated by him channeling his power. The fruits then released dao laws through the portal.

“He’s doing it now.” The crowd watched eagerly for his next move.

The dao laws resembled thick pipes, ready to take in all the molten liquid from Redflood.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The liquid started solidifying into exquisite parts. They assembled around the conqueror and turned him into a metal giant. His laws and dao fruits remained in the other realm and continued creating the pathway for the liquid.

This version seemed rather similar to the ones found in Imperial Attendant City as if they were cast from the same mould.

Nonetheless, Suppression’s version didn’t have the same level of immaculate details - a clear imitation after closer inspection.

As he activated the armor suit, red rays poured out from the gaps with enough power to push away three thousand worlds. They appeared more powerful compared to the rays coming from Li Qiye’s gauntlet and had a different color. In reality, Li Qiye’s rays were colorless and freed from impurities while Suppression’s rays were a crimson red, perhaps a lower grade.

“He’s using Redflood to imitate the metal giants.” Everyone understood right away.

He hoped to make up for the gap between himself and the gauntlet by using the power of Redflood.

“Extraordinary, the ingenuity in pioneering a new path.” Li Qiye couldn’t help but praise after seeing Suppression converting the power of Redflood into a metal suit for his own personal use.

Ancestors nearby were naturally impressed. Conquerors and dao lords from the other regions also paid attention to this and had nothing but praise for him.

Although some of them had borrowed the power of the four broken realms, this was strictly limited to the internal areas. They used their grand dao to harmonize with the affinities found there.

As for Suppression, he was able to continually borrow Redflood’s power while being in the outside world. Other innovative conquerors had never come up with this method before.

“This power is not mine but let us see how strong it is.” Suppression’s voice echoed across the two continents.

“So be it, show us the power of your creation.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Boom!” Suppression raised both hands and sent the dreadful rays toward the enemy.

They formed a domain around Li Qiye and instilled pressure from all directions.

“A fight it is.” Li Qiye smiled and the gauntlet disassembled for a second before turning into an armor suit as well.

This allowed him to survive the rays without needing to do anything else.
