Chapter 4435: Beseech

The return of Nine-tailed God brought unity back to Dragon despite the sudden change of their sect master. The conflict between the branches has been quelled.

This was a pro in having an ultimate ancestor. They served as unshakable pillars, capable of saving their sect from sure destruction.

His appearance brought morale back to Dragon and gave them a clear direction for the future. If it wasn’t for him, Dragon would have fractured. FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

After all, Peacock Monarch had plenty of supporters. If he had insisted on opposing Li Qiye, he would have gained the support of many ancestors and disciples.

Putting this feud aside, it would have been difficult for Goldbird to take over as well.

Even if Goldbird had the support of all three ancient ancestors, Peacock was still the rightful ruler due to his talent and contribution.

If the three ancient ancestors were to make Goldbird the sect master, he would have to deal with many dissenters. This group would think that his position was not earned.

This wasn’t the case with Nine-tailed God’s involvement. He successfully stabilized the situation and suppressed all dissidents. This stability actually increased morale and unity.

Because of this, though the only change was in the sect master, Dragon was actually undergoing a revolution. The three branches became less divided than before - something truly beneficial for the future.

Nine-tailed God then invited Li Qiye to stay for a bit. His reception was completely different. Whenever members of Dragon saw him, they acted with nothing short of reverence.

“Sir, our young miss isn’t bad at all, right?” Nine-tailed God spoke with a smile: “Are you looking for a disciple?”

He shamelessly suggested despite his position in order to help Jian Qingzhu. As for the latter, she didn’t say anything but had an expression of eager anticipation.

“I don’t recruit disciples that easily.” Li Qiye said.

“Then do you need a maid? That works too.” Nine-tailed God took one step back, changing “disciple” to “maid”.

Jian Qingzhu didn’t mind the change in status either. Staying with Li Qiye was obviously a grand fortune.

Those lacking information would think that she was crazy, refusing to marry a potential dao lord and becoming Li Qiye’s maid instead.

In this case, both Nine-tailed God and Jian Qingzhu weren’t fools.

Li Qiye stared at the demon and smiled: “You can take her as your disciple, no need for her to follow me.”

The demon shook his head and said: “How can I compare with you? Staying with you will benefit her for a lifetime.”

“Her talents are just so so, but her wisdom and intelligence are excellent. She’ll be able to shine here.” He said, not taking her opinion into account.

“Dragon will just be Dragon, no matter how resplendent, only a path before the dao lord level. Moreover, Eight Desolaces are so tiny compared to the vastness of the world.” The demon smiled wryly.

“You want to leave this tiny land?” He asked.

“Unfortunately, my cultivation is limited.” The demon shook his head: “Even if I have the chance to leave, I won’t achieve anything special since I am but a worm compared to the countless overlords.”

Anyone else listening would become startled. First, putting aside the comment about Eight Desolaces’ size, Nine-tailed God’s disparaging self-comment was unbelievable.

He might not be unbeatable but as a top ancient ancestor and an unsurpassable mountain, it would be hard to find him a worthy opponent. Alas, he still considered himself a worm?

Regular cultivators wouldn’t possibly fathom the beings he was talking about. Though Jian Qingzhu has been exposed to many things recently, she was still shaken because it came from a mighty demon god.

In fact, for many generations now, the disciples of Dragon viewed him as the goal of a lifetime. If they were to hear this, they would become emotional and stricken with despair.

It seemed that the path of cultivation was so hopeless. Their goal turned out to be nothing more than a worm in the grand scheme of things.

Nonetheless, she took a deep breath and calmed down. Instead of despair, she viewed it as a different starting point and became even more eager than before to embark on this path.

Li Qiye noted this and smiled: “A strong heart can still find success on the arduous path. She has gained the right fortune. Now, she needs to weather the storm herself in order to learn instead of wasting it under my protection.”

“Thank you for your guidance.” The demon god understood the point and bowed.

Jian Qingzhu also did the same to show her gratitude.

“Sir, please let us know what you want.” Nine-tailed God then got to the point. He knew that Li Qiye didn’t appear in Dragon for no reason.

“I want the bone left behind by your progenitor.” Li Qiye revealed.

“That thing?” Nine-tailed God was startled for a moment but still agreed: “As you wish, Sir.”

This legacy was considered the priceless heirloom of their sect. Nonetheless, the demon god still agreed right away.

First, he knew that no one would be able to stop Li Qiye from obtaining it. Dragon might be the casualty in this process. Thus, why not just give it to him and let him view it as a favor? It would earn his good grace.
