Chapter 4889: Wild Dragon’s True Form

The armored rats and condors immediately rushed into the hole.

“Kill them all!” Members of Soaring Stallions were fearless. They rearranged themselves for minor formations to kill these demons.

Meanwhile, Flame-eater Child also walked in and spewed flames at them.

Despite their battle prowess, the flames were too strong and incinerated quite a few of them.

“Enough!” Venerable Dragon God could sit still no longer.

“Bam!” He slammed Draco onto the ground and waves of draconic energy rushed out in an unstoppable manner.

This sent the demons flying as he took one step forward and raised his halberd upward.

The swing massacred the two legions. Blue flashes occurred alongside death and rain of blood.

“Damn!” The guests and villains became emotional after seeing him in action.

Among the Ten Monsters, only Wild Dragon and Shadowrider could take him on. His presence on the battlefield boosted the dynasty’s morale once more.

“Go!” The elites followed right behind him, showing that their dynasty could take on any other great power.

It was obvious that Wild Dynasty stood no chance against Eight-stallion if it wasn’t for Wild Dragon.

“Boom!” Flame-eater Child spat out a flame with the shape of a dragon. It raised its claws and soared toward Venerable.

The Maddened Dao erased time and space, leaving strange afterimages of reality in its wake.

“Die!” Venerable roared and utilized his draconic energy.

Dragons were kings of all beasts. Its power made everyone tremble.

“Coiling Dragon!” He utilized his supreme dao while swinging his halberd horizontally. The slash looked like a dragon laying on the ground, capable of cutting down all existences and affinities.

His halberd dao intimidated the villains and guests in the crowd, causing some of them to shout loudly.

Many wanted to take advantage of the situation but now, seeing him in action made them forget about this.

“Boom!” His slash cut through the fiery dragon and sent Flame-eater Chil flying. He smashed into the ground, leaving behind a large pit while vomiting blood.

Spectators thought that given his child-like frame, many bones might have been broken.

“Come back, Child.” Wild Dragon commanded.

Flame-eater Child crawled out of the pit and ran back to the mountain, still looking rather lively.

Venerable Dragon God didn’t give chase. He posed there like a god of war, making sure that the dynasty would remain standing.

There was a considerable gap between Flame-eater Child and him. The special flame alone was not enough.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“I will entertain you then.” Wild Dragon spoke.

“Come.” Venerable rode the triumphant momentum, ready to fight to the death.

This had occurred numerous times in the past. The only difference was that he was on the losing side now.

“Raa!” A draconic roar swept through the battlefield in a destructive manner.

A gigantic figure appeared in front of Wild Dynasty and darkness took over. People could see that it was a lava earthdragon with flames inside its mouth.

This was Wild Dragon’s true form. His tyrannical aura scared the hell out of spectators.

“You are not strong enough to fight me.” He spoke thunderously. This was indeed the truth since he had more sacred fruits than Venerable Dragon God.

“Is that so? Show me.” Venerable Dragon God snorted.

“Raa!” He activated his true bloodline, causing his aura to become purer.

He was superior in terms of bloodline alone. Wild Dragon purified his own bloodline in order to reach a higher level while Venerable was born with this advantage.

“Formation!” Venerable roared.

“Azure!” Members of Soaring Stallions roared in unison.

Dao runes came together to derive the mysteries of its creator and blessed Venerable Dragon God.

He became shrouded in the flames of a dao lord, the same for his halberd.
