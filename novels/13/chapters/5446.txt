Chapter 5447: Haven Bulwark

The war between The People and The Race started again, spreading destruction from the illusory realms to the upper continents.

In spite of the continents’ massive size, the auras of the apex cultivators and their followers could still be felt in all corners.

More and more cultivators were dragged into this mess regardless of their wishes. Of course, most should have nothing to do with these battles because they could be reduced to ashes after one move. Casualties began approaching an incalculable number.

Even powerful dao lords and conquerors started to fall - a sign of continuous escalation.

“Rumble!” Powers from the illusory realms continued to leak out into the actual world. The fabrics of the realms seemed to be torn apart.

Weaker cultivators and mortals trembled in horror since they could feel the shock waves becoming stronger and stronger. Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

They have lost control of their destiny. Death might come knocking at any moment and they wouldn’t have a clue. After all, an uncontrolled blast could wipe out a kingdom in the blink of an eye. Thus, they actually didn’t care about the victor, only praying for a swift end to the war.

Survival mattered the most, not the ruling party. Once this spread to the entire upper continents, the winners would sit on empty thrones with no surviving subjects to rule.

“Boom!” A blinding light erupted in Heaven Alliance due to the appearance of a supreme tower. Its ancient dao laws possessed an incredible suppressive affinity. If it were to descend on the upper continents, it would instantly sink both.

It seemed to have been around before the start of heaven and earth. The area within was nothing short of infinite.

“The tower of Celestial Court!” An ancient ancestor bellowed.

“It’s reaching the climax, they want to end this.” A neutral dragon lord shuddered.

The tower was the ace card of Heaven Alliance, rumored to have been given to Light-dragon Conqueror by Celestial Court during his founding of the alliance.

Loud explosions and earthquakes took over the upper continents. However, this disaster didn’t last long because another force seemed to be stabilizing it.

Another blinding light appeared in a different location, connecting Dao and Imperial Alliance. This was a great wall exuding different colors; each color represented a particular divine metal.

It stretched for billions of miles, seemingly capable of surrounding all of the upper continents. It could handle any attack, whether it be an ultimate blow from the dao lords and conquerors or countless falling meteors.

The various metals were embedded with runes and totems as well - the blessings from the wise sages.

“Haven Bulwark!” Another shouted after seeing the walls, especially those from The People.

“It’ll protect us!” Everyone heaved a sigh of relief since the suppressive pressure started to dissipate.

Earlier, the tower of Celestial Court paralyzed everyone even though it was aiming at something else on the battlefield. Now, the walls were erected to stop the tower; protecting the upper continents was only a by-product.

“This will determine the future, we’ll find out soon.” An ancient ancestor gazed at the bulwark and commented.
