Destruction of Stone Harmony appeared imminent and Li Qiye was done for, or so the crowd thought.

However, time and sound came to a halt. No one dared to breathe loudly regardless of their strength after seeing this scene. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

They saw Li Qiye easily stopping the gigantic foot with a single hand.

Keep in mind, Li Qiye was far smaller than its foot, let alone the entire entity. It looked like the entire sky was caving down. To paint an image, he was a mosquito trying to shoulder the sky, except a million times or so smaller.

Normally, people would find this hilarious, akin to a mantis trying to kick a carriage - a full overestimation of one’s abilities.

Alas, the size discrepancy didn’t prevent him from stopping the stomp in such a relaxed manner. The crowd was completely shocked.

“Raa!” The steel giant roared with a star-destroying intensity, causing continuous explosions.

Its body quaked as it mustered more force down towards Li Qiye.

“Rumble!” Space was instantly crushed along with various dao laws.

“Scram.” Li Qiye didn’t bat an eye before the incoming devastation. He slightly lifted his hand and flipped his palm.

Something unbelievable happened. The giant was instantly pushed off its feet by Li Qiye’s invincible power. It flew towards the starry horizon like a gargantuan planet.

“Boom! Boom! Boom!” Stars were victimized and instantly exploded, resulting in many colorful explosions.

The stunned crowd didn’t know what to think and just stood there in a daze. They had no words to describe this unreal physical force.

“He’s as strong as a true dragon...” It was astonishing to see how normal his arms were, not muscular in the slightest.

“He could lift up the entire world if there was a suitable handle.” An ancestor said: “Strong enough to flip back a toppling firmament.”

“Truly invincible. Only a few is at this level in Imperial.” Everyone became impressed.

“Die!” The steel giant roared and rushed back, capable of traveling through one domain after another in just a short time.

The wings behinds its back came together to form a divine sword spanning for ten million miles. Its pulsing glint illuminated the world.

“Boom!” The slash instantly destroyed the stars along the path. Many Eternals wouldn’t be able to stop it.

“Supreme Divinity!” The giant roared; its body surged with great divinity. This slash looked like the judgment of the high heaven.

The area became engulfed in a terrible tribulation of lightning. Everyone turned pale, knowing that direct contact would end Stone Harmony.

“Oh lord, is this a tribulation in the legends?” Someone screamed and started running.

“It’s not a tribulation but rather a full-blown heavenly punishment! It carries the power of the high heaven, one that surpasses the Eternals. How did it muster this much force?!” One ancestor bellowed.

The slash buried everything. Numerous rivers of stars evaporated as if they had never existed in the first place.

“It’s your doom today!” Li Qiye’s eyes became serious. He became resplendent and made a fist. Just this slight movement made the world tremble.

“Break!” He leaped into the sky and punched upward.

His fist was naturally minuscule compared to the great sword. It shouldn’t be a match at all.

“Is he insane going barehanded? Only an ancestral treasure can match this sword!” An Eternal commented, feeling that Li Qiye was being irrational.

However, Li Qiye’s shiny punch represented annihilation, peerlessness, and unyielding tenacity.

Blinding explosions detonated like the eruption of numerous suns up in space, temporarily blinding the capable spectators.

Once they regained their vision, they saw the punch crushing the sword into pieces that eventually caught on fire.

This wasn’t the end. His punch continued in an unstoppable manner and unleashed a flame capable of incinerating three thousand worlds.

It penetrated the giant’s chest, leaving a black hole. Though its chest was thicker than the earth, it still wasn’t enough to stop this power.

“Ahh!” The Vajras and numerous disciples from Hidden Gold screamed. They were crushed as a result; their blood started gushing out.

“Rumble!” Crumbling noises echoed in the area.

Li Qiye went up to space and separated the giant into eight pieces.

“Bang!” He started by ripping out the skull.

“Bang!” The legs were next.

“Bang!” Then the hands...

The steel giant that seemed to be unbeatable earlier has been torn apart in full. Remnant pieces began floating around in space.

The crowd became frozen as if their mind has left their body.

“... You can do that?...” An Eternal stammered. He has never seen this level of dismantlement before.
