Chapter 4340: Ferrying

The intimidating battle intent was innate and naturally formed - the culmination of experiencing countless battles.

The members of this legion weren’t ghosts nor resentful spirits - only the battle intents left behind after their destruction.

They have been around for millions of years and remained underground to suppress the darkness. Eventually, the darkness invaded them and made it impossible for them to move on.

Li Qiye came to purify these battle intents, allowing them to find peace.

The crowd saw him walking on water towards the legion.

“What is he doing?” Someone became surprised.

The battle intents had no sentience, meaning that coming close might result in being attacked. Each strand had immense power. Being surrounded by them meant certain death.

He started chanting a dao mantra. Runes came out of his mouth and illuminated the soldiers.

“Buzz…” The intent had a glow as blue as the sky, looking quite beautiful. The rays intertwined and became blindingly bright, culminating in a draconic insignia seen on each of the soldiers.

The dragon raised its head and could call for clouds and winds. With its emergence, the soldiers also wanted to turn into dragons as well.

Li Qiye himself was radiant. He formed a mudra and pressed down on the lake. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

“Boom!” With that, the rays rushed into the sky and created the same insignia, albeit massive. A portal manifested into reality in the same spot.

It loudly creaked and opened, releasing azure waves like the light of heaven itself onto the soldiers.

“Raa!” A dragon roar erupted. Next came its billowing aura sweeping through the realms.

Living beings immediately prostrated, unable to handle the sheer pressure.

An azure dragon flew out of the portal, looking magnificent with its claws raised. It could tear apart everything in the world, crush the darkness, and devour all evil.

“Looks like a divine beast from the legends…” An expert shouted!

“What kind of legion is this?” A last-gen member shuddered after seeing the activated insignia.

This legion must have been immensely powerful when they were alive. They still looked unbeatable right now after death.

“How the hell did this legion fall?” Someone else thought about the past and couldn’t fathom the terrifying power of the darkness.

“Azure Dragon, Heavenguard! eternal protectors of the ages!” Li Qiye chanted harmoniously with the laws of the world.

“Azure Dragon, Heavenguard!” The soldiers chanted back at him.

Their roars caused time and space to explode in a devastating manner. Cultivators were swept off their feet instantly.

“Shit!” They turned pale as they were flying through the air.

“Boom!” The portal fully opened, revealing the paradise on the other side.

The rays from the soldiers started flying through the portal and their current ethereal form gradually vanished. The azure dragon also did the same.

Eventually, once all of them have passed through the portal, the gates creaked and came together.

Everything eventually disappeared outside of scattering particles. Peace returned to the area. The darkness and spectral soldiers were no longer there.

The entire thing felt like a dream but spectators knew that it was real. They still remembered the frightening battle intents and draconic aura just now.

“So this is what he was talking about, ferrying?” One cultivator regained his wits and asked.

In the beginning, no one took Wang Weiqiao seriously when he said that his master was going to ferry souls over to the other side.

Now, after witnessing this event, the majority believed in him.

“So there were this many lost souls underground.” One elder said.

There had been countless conferences taking place in this mountain range. Alas, they had no idea about the presence of the lost souls beneath the ground. Today, Li Qiye finally freed them from their eternal confinement.

“The legend must be true, the mythical Heavenguard Mountain perished together with the darkness.” A member from a large sect became emotional.

This legend was rather well-known but there was no proof of it. Today, the spectral legion convinced the crowd.

“Buzz…” As the crowd talked about the great battle in the past, rays from treasures suddenly shot out of the lake.
