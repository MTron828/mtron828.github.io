Chapter 4192: Eye Of The Sea

“No, there was one survivor.” An old man nearby disagreed.

“Who is it?” The youth became surprised right away.

“The one and only in history.” The old man said mysteriously.

“Just tell us already!” Those nearby became impatient.

“Starshooter Dao Lord.” The old man stared at the sinkhole and said: “As far as I know and everyone else for that matter, he’s the only one.”

“An invincible dao lord…” Others found this answer acceptable.

Starshooter was the fourth dao lord of Sea Emperor whose sword dao dominated the realms.

“A dao lord is strong enough to fight against the living creatures of the forbidden zones. This eye might be scary but it’s not enough to stop a dao lord.” An expert said.

Dao lords were the ultimate existences in the mind of regular cultivators. They were viewed as omnipotent.

“No.” The old man shook his head: “The dao lord did it during his youth, before he became a dao lord.”

This caused the crowd to exchange glances.

“I thought this place was dangerous and only suicidal people entered. Was the dao lord already invincible at a young age?” One youth asked.

“It was strange indeed.” The old man elaborated: “He wasn’t at a high level then, just an unknown cultivator. Because of this, they might have been unsubstantiated rumors since he never brought it up either.”

“Geniuses are different from us.” An expert said: “He already had legends despite being young. Not just anyone can reach the apex.”

“Maybe this place is the reason why he was able to become a dao lord.” Someone had a different perspective on this matter: “The fortune here allowed him to embark on the path towards invincibility.”Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“It’s possible.” The old man agreed: “Keep in mind that as I’ve mentioned earlier, the dao lord never brought up this issue. People didn’t know what he got from here, whether it be a divine sword or a treasure.”

“Whatever it is, it should be incredible.” Temptation reared its ugly head again.

“A fortune capable of making someone a dao lord.” Many stared at the sinkhole with greed in their eyes.

Becoming a dao lord was virtually all cultivators’ lifelong pursuit. Of course, nearly all ended in failure outside of a small group. Today, an opportunity was right in front of them; their heart started beating faster.

“Should we give it a shot?” A hot-blooded young man wanted to be the next lucky guy, thinking that he would find success just by jumping into the hole.

“Feel free to play the terrible odds.” His senior glared at him and said: “I’m sure that across the years, hundreds of thousands of cultivators have jumped in. How many actually came back out with the exception of Starshooter Dao Lord? Do you think you’ll be another exception?”

“Well, no…” The young man smiled awkwardly and didn’t dare to jump.

“Forget it, find a more realistic spot.” A last-gen cultivator gave up on this sinkhole and said: “The probability is too low here.”

No one wanted to put their life on the line when the odds were insurmountable.

“Wait, who’s over there?!” As they were leaving, someone shouted.

They looked over and sure enough, a man was standing next to the edge of the sinkhole.

“It’s Li Qiye!” Someone else bellowed after taking a good look.

“Indeed, what is he doing here?” They became interested again.

“This is it.” Li Qiye stared at the bottomless sinkhole and smiled.

“Is he trying to challenge it? He wants the fortune inside?” An expert murmured.

“I don’t know if I would call this a challenge, more like an insane attempt from a madman.” Someone from the last generation murmured.

“He’s already the world’s richest. This risky business isn’t right for him.” One youth who didn’t like Li Qiye still didn’t want him to die.

“Is wealth alone not enough? He wants to become a dao lord too?” His friend wondered.

“This is unnecessary indeed.” A big shot shook his head then shouted at LI Qiye: “Young Noble Li, the eye of the sea is fatally dangerous, you already have enough resources, no need to obtain this fortune. Don’t let greed be your downfall. Find contentment in what you have.”

He persuaded with sincerity and logic, hoping to save Li Qiye. Everyone knew that Li Qiye’s cultivation was shabby. However, his wealth allowed him to contest against anyone or any sect for that matter.

He had all the advantages in the world. It would be idiotic to jump into the sinkhole for something that might not even be there.

“Unfortunately, I am never content.” Li Qiye looked back at the big shot and smiled: “Nonetheless, I do appreciate your comment. Here, have this.” He casually tossed a treasure to the big shot then jumped into the sinkhole.

“He actually jumped?!” The crowd became startled.

“He has to be crazy. Only a crazy man would do this.” One ancestor got closer and stared at the darkness.

“Just stop trying to judge him with conventional wisdom, he’s different.” A high elder said.

“He’s dead for sure, there’s no way he’ll be a second Starshooter Dao Lord.” One youth commented. The odds were minuscule.

“The madman could shock all of us and perform another miracle.” Someone else calmed down and said.

“Can his sorcery overcome this nefarious place?” Another wondered.
