Chapter 5418: He’s Gone Mad

Those who were swayed by All-things’ call for peace felt their blood boiling after listening to Illumination.Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

Cultivators needed a concrete goal in order to endure the long years of training. Becoming a conqueror was virtually impossible. However, having the ambition of destroying The Race was far easier and grander.

This notion played a large role in Illumination’s popularity, giving aimless cultivators a reason to walk on the path.

“If you insist on being stubborn, there is nothing I can do. This will seal your fate.” All-things sighed and shook his head.

“So what? We will die for The People and that’s enough.” Illumination laughed in response, seemingly ready to be a martyr.

However, it seemed that he was rather sincere. He truly believed that he was the chosen savior of The People - the most frightening ideology. His obsession had been engraved deep inside his body and blood.

“Incurable.” Swordsea uttered coldly: “I don’t know what the future holds for The People, but I’m certain that they are better off without you.”

“We walk on different paths.” Illumination smiled and said: “Everyone, since we’ve gathered here today, let’s conclude it today.”

Everyone understood that words wouldn’t be able to solve this issue - only a fight to the death.

“You are asking for death then.” Supreme still looked as dignified and majestic as ever.

“To death then.” Swordsea didn’t have the patience to argue any longer. The rays emanating from his eyes could cut down the stars.

“Brother All-things? Will you oppose The Race with me?” Illumination asked All-things with a serious expression.

“As you said, we walk on different paths.” All-things responded: “I agree with Brother Swordsea, that The People is better off without you. If you can survive today, then I will fight you. Only one of us can move forward.”

All-things expressed his stance with a strong statement, speaking calmly and resolutely.

“A clear separation.” Listeners took a deep breath while staring at the two. Their relationship was officially severed.

After Emperors War, they separated while still maintaining an air of cordiality, giving each other face. Now, All-things has publicly denounced Illumination and stated his desire to kill him.

To kill someone perceived as a hero for The People could besmirch his reputation. Nonetheless, that was all behind him now.

Some were disappointed that All-things would prefer to fight Illumination instead of stopping Heaven and Divine Alliance right now.

“Haha, good. I suppose I should try my best to survive today to give you a chance, Brother.” Illumination laughed.

“You won’t be alive this time tomorrow.” Swordsea said and unsheathed his sword - clearly superior to any other sword nearby.

His sword dao had a focus on being endless and unceasing in both offense and defense. One could sense his anger through his rampaging sword intents.

His strength only made members of The People feel worse. Their mighty trio was now attempting to kill each other so there was no going back to the golden age.

“Bring it!” Illumination seemed eager to fight and a divine light erupted inside his grotto, fully enveloping it.

Great figures appeared to empower this phenomenon, forming an impressive imperial barrier.

Everyone thought that there were still many conquerors and dragon lords following him in this perilous situation. Although his view was extreme, there was something about him that drew in these loyal supporters.

“Start!” Supreme ordered and the members of Dao Alliance stepped forward. Their auras erupted and resembled the roars of dragons.

“Go!” Swordsea also ordered the men of Divine Alliance to march forward. They looked like an army of steel with a single goal in mind - the destruction of Illumination Grotto.
