Chapter 5905: Fight Me, Sacred Teacher

“Bam!” The invasive force could reduce all living beings including World’s group in a split second.

None could see it but if the world was an egg, it had a tiny hole now from the repeated impact. This was a strange feeling but anyone could feel it happening.

After a sizzling noise, emperors noticed a blood vein drilling down from the mysterious hole. It was only the size of a finger yet still appeared indestructible and everlasting.

“What is this thing?” The mightiest emperors had not seen anything like this previously.

“Is this beyond the overlord realm? No, doesn’t seem to be.” Stonesplitter murmured.

“Sacred Teacher, come fight!” A voice from another world could be heard through the small hole.

“Fight?” Li Qiye chuckled before becoming serious, immediately grabbing the vein.

“Boom!” The vein released a greenish hue, turning into an immortal dao overwhelming anything beneath.

The power left everyone speechless. They could only pray that it didn’t descend enough to reduce them to blood.

Emperors felt the same fear of death. The vein could crucify them to the ground.

“It’s the brat!” Eyes opened within the Three Illusory Realms.

“Living again.” Someone said.

“I wonder if that bastard is still alive.” Another spoke with a hint of anger.

***

The explosive force of what could only be described at the immortal level still couldn’t surpass Li Qiye.

“Boom!” He crushed the aura and grabbed the vein.

“Sacred Teacher can’t be beaten!” Emperors thought he could destroy numerous epochs at the same time.

Li Qiye needed no technique or variation because his hand wielded the power of the primordial. Epochs and true immortals were as equally helpless inside his grasp.

The visual phenomena and special powers stemming from the flesh vein were useless.

“Don’t be silly, tell your master to come.” Li Qiye smiled while pulling on the vein.

His primordial light engulfed the vein, turning it into a spear.𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“Whoosh!” He sent it back to the sky, capable of piercing the target regardless of which world they resided in.

This spear didn’t rely on the mysteries of the dao or a powerful affinity, only Li Qiye’s will. Nevertheless, defenses became as thin as paper.

“Pluff!” In a world far removed from the six continents, the vein-turned-into-spear pierced someone and caused blood to splash.

“When I arrive, your time shall be over.” Li Qiye declared after the first blow.

Everyone was left speechless afterward, including the existences in the illusory realms. They had just witnessed Li Qiye’s true power - a force capable of killing the so-called immortals.

“His age is finally here, the high heaven can’t win.” Someone in the illusory realms whispered.

The hole in the sky slowly dispersed as if it had never been there in the first place. Peace returned to the world but not the people’s mind.

“Sacred Teacher, is it time?” Profound Emperor couldn’t help but ask.

Li Qiye looked at the sky and said: “No rush, I will not take advantage of people when they’re down or the victory won’t be as convincing. Plus, I have to help someone test their sword.”

He patted a sword that was given to him from Sword Burial Ground. Although he initially lacked interest, he wanted to try it after returning.

“Let’s see how sharp it is.” Li Qiye smiled and disappeared.

His destination was none other than the illusory realms.

“Looks like your defeat was warranted back then.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Not the brat alone.” The big eye spoke.

“Now can you all talk about your secrets? That’s why you’ve invited me here, right?” Li Qiye said.

Silence ensued as they didn’t wish to speak.

After a long while, a pleasant voice started the conversation: “Help us kill someone.”

“Not this brat.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Yes.” A deep voice responded, clearly unhappy.

“So this is what has been haunting you all.” Li Qiye said.

“We will reward you handsomely.” The eye said.

“Why don’t you do it yourselves?” Li Qiye asked.

“We are already on the verge of death, one wrong step and we lost everything.” The pleasant voice said.

“Not quite.” Li Qiye shook his head.
