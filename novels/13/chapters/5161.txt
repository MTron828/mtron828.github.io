Chapter 5162: Body To Sword

The monarch struggled and activated his sword dao. His nine fruits exuded chaos true energy and explosions, capable of opening a new world. All of this paled in comparison before the grip. His bones started cracking from the pressure.

A terrible scene unraveled before spectators - one invisible hand immobilized him while another slowly refined him - removing his skin and changing his flesh and bones.

“Nooo!” He bellowed in agony and realized the gravity of the situation. His sacred fruits suddenly became as bright as possible and the world shook violently.

“Shit, he wants to self-destruct!” A dragon lord shouted.

His true fate appeared for he preferred to die than to be subjected to whatever this fate was. A blinding light appeared around him but the invisible hand gently waved and sealed all grand dao and affinities.

“Boom!” The fruits and true fate on the verge of exploding were sent back into his body for the refinement process.

“Noo!” He let out a scream of desperation and fear.

“Rumble!” After loud explosions and quakes, lightning bolts and flames were added to the process. Eventually, a sword appeared before everyone.

One made of bones that have been refined numerous times, bearing no semblance to its original form. It looked like a piece of jade now since the flesh and blood have been removed along with all other impurities.

Nine sacred fruits were embedded into the blade in a balanced manner. Thus, their power remained.

Ancient ancestors and dragon lords were at a loss for words - a nine-fruit dragon lord had just been refined into a skeletal sword while still alive.

Watching the actual methods traumatized some of them. This was doubly true for his allies - Heavenly Sword Conqueror and Sunshroud Divine Conqueror.

They had tortured and killed mortal enemies before. This was just the way of cultivation. Alas, this refinement process was new to them since it was so perfect.

The sacred fruits and true fate have been sealed into the skeletal sword. Therefore, it possessed the same power as Sacred Sword Monarch.

“Damn…” An ancient ancestor shuddered and dropped to the ground.

Watching the swift takedown wasn’t strange. After all, any dragon lord with ten fruits or more could have easily killed the monarch.

On the other hand, capturing and refining him were much more difficult. It might require a conqueror with ten dao fruits or more, not to mention a lengthy period - perhaps ten thousand years or more.

Worst of all, this person didn’t even show up so it looked as if invisible hands were responsible for all of this.

Now, the pale divine emperor and conqueror shared the same thought - run!

The assailant wasn’t lying about showing mercy. They should have taken the first deal of crippling a grand dao.

“Death.” Li Qiye’s voice echoed again and the invisible hand swung the skeletal sword at Heavenly Sword Conqueror.

The latter had no choice but to make his move, releasing all of his energy and vitality. He went as far as burning his true blood.

A new heavenly sword appeared - one strong enough to split the azure.

Alas, the skeletal sword could cleave through any existence, rendering the heavenly sword impotent.FiNd 𝒖pd𝒂tes on n(𝒐)/v𝒆l𝒃𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

It split the energy sword into two halves and caused the conqueror to scream.

“Ahh!” The dao fruits were obliterated; all of their mysteries became ashes. Heavenly Sword was dismembered from the top down; blood splashed everywhere.

Sunshroud Divine Emperor turned pale and tried to flee. He rarely felt this level of fear before, not even during the previous epoch and its wars.

“You’re not getting away.” Li Qiye’s voice lingered in his ears as the skeletal sword slashed the air again.

Sunshroud immediately performed swift maneuvers, crossing through the domains. He knew that this wasn’t enough so he utilized his eight wills as well. This was proven futile since they were easily cut down by the sword, unable to slow it down in the slightest.
