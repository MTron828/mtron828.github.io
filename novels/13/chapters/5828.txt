Chapter 5828: They Won’t Come

They kept the ability to summon the overlords a secret until the last moment. However, Sword Emperor’s group seemed to be the key, not the immortals and the founder.

“Which ancestor?!” Profound shouted while the rest of the group prepared the ceremony.

The three immortals stared at the founder - clearly showing that he was the only one capable of starting the summon. Would the summon work if the overlords didn’t wish to come?

“Lord of Derivation, summon him!” The founder knew who was the easiest to summon among them.

“Very well!” The emperors rushed toward the dao platform near the statues.

In reality, the dao platform depicted Lord of Derivation. However, due to his ugly and ghastly appearance, many details were purposely omitted.

“Buzz.” Their light flowed into the platform in unison.

“Heed our call!” They shouted and sent their vitality into the statue.

The light and the vitality became one, creating a maelstrom. Runes appeared on the statue, connecting to form a unique dao chapter.

“Boom!” A beam shot through the sky vault while the maelstrom rotated rapidly.

Everyone believed that this was opening a gate for Lord of Derivation.

“Bam!” However, the portal suddenly extinguished and the beam shot back down. The light disappeared from the statue.

“What?!” Spectators shouted at first but the result was clear.

“Damn...” Sword Emperor and the others were alarmed.

“Founder, Lord of Derivation refused the summon.” Nether murmured, frightened.

Despite their tough rhetoric, they always believed that these overlords would come at the last moment. Alas, this didn’t seem to be the case.

“What do we do now?” The three immortals were lost as well.

Li Qiye had made fun of them for not being able to summon Primal and Lord of Derivation. Nevertheless, they believed that it was possible with the founder’s summoning ceremony and Celestial Court facing an existential crisis.

Despair finally surfaced in their mind. This would be the end of them and Celestial Court. They couldn’t help but stare at the founder again.

Putting aside the complex relationships between the various branches of Celestial Court, the founder seemed to have a relationship with Lord of Derivation. Was it truly hopeless?

“Looks like your supreme overlords are too scared to come out.” Li Qiye initiated the suppression again.

“Crack!” More cracks appeared on the figure of Trinity Ancestor and the group vomited more blood.

“Again!” The founder ordered Profound’s group.

“Go!” They agreed and initiated the ceremony, pouring their vitality and power into the statue.

“Rumble!” Another beam shot up into the air, creating a maelstrom portal.

“Ancestor, please descend!” They roared and channeled their true blood into the dao platform.

This seemed to be working as the portal manifested into reality.

“Boom!” Unfortunately, the power beyond refused the summon.

“It’s not working...” The group had tried their best to no avail. Follow the latest novels 𝒐𝒏 n𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Rumble!” The maelstrom came crashing down on the dao platform - a backlash intending to destroy it.

“The ancestor’s wrath!” They knew what was going on right away - Lord of Derivation didn’t appreciate the constant annoyance and wanted to destroy the dao platform, removing the summoning method.

Everyone turned pale. The true backers behind Celestial Court refused to help them save it. Was there any point in Celestial Court’s existence now?
