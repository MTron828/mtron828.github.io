After easily flipping the plate over, Li Qiye who was just suppressed earlier rose above the nine firmaments. He became invincible not only in the present but also across the ages.

“Time to end this.” He said quietly.

The soft tone casualized the comment yet it still sounded unchangeable, as if fate has been determined. No one could do a damn thing regardless of who they are and how strong they are. A reversal was impossible.

“Buzz.” He moved his palms closer to each other and a light appeared in the center - akin to three thousand worlds being grabbed by him.

Everyone felt their soul wavering from this action of his. Space and time were twisting; the world was being trapped within.

Not just Nine Secrets System but all three worlds were being affected along with their dao. All of these affinities became twisted and squeezed together to form a seal.

This seal contained the most terrifying force in existence despite its tiny size since it encompassed the various powers of the world.

Li Qiye smiled and released the seal.

“Boom!” Time and space were blasted back to the original chaos. The seal exuded strands of light. Upon closer inspections, people could still see the original affinities within the seal.

The all-encompassing seal naturally had a massive weight. Its suppression was unimaginable and incalculable. No master could handle this.

The figure roared and raised the divine plate. It started glowing while its aura ravaged the firmaments. He also turned into an independent sphere capable of containing everything in the world.

The plate exuded boundless laws of the dao. These laws could shoulder the entire world to stop any suppression.

It was as if a progenitor has come back to life. This move could definitely block any attack.

“Boom!” The seal slammed into the divine plate.

Everything in the world seemed to be penetrated, including Nine Secrets System. The entire crowd was in shambles. Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

The tough plate still failed to stop the suppression from the seal. The laws of a progenitor surging in the sky were instantly destroyed.

This was an incredible scene - these laws should be indestructible yet they faltered all the same to the incoming seal.

The plate was completely penetrated and split back into the four ancestral weapons. The seal didn’t stop there and continued heading for the figure.

This figure sensed the danger and unleashed its most powerful light. Unfortunately, this was futile as well. Powerful resistance didn’t amount to anything.

“Boom!” The seal landed and created a massive inferno. It flew straight through the chest of the figure, leaving a monstrous gap.

“No!” War King and his allies screamed with despair and fear, completely overwhelmed.

Li Qiye’s seal didn’t only defeat their ultimate move but also the most respected existence in their mind - their progenitor!

Everyone became empty-headed at this moment and fixated at this scene.

The figure fell slowly before scattering into light particles that eventually dispersed. Not a single trace was left of this being.

“Myriad World.” Li Qiye wasn’t surprised at the outcome at all after using this move.

He looked at the pulsing seal in his palm and smiled. The light gradually subsided and the seal grew fainter before also disappearing.

In essence, it wasn’t quite a seal. Li Qiye simply squeezed numerous worlds together into this form.

Myriad World was one of the nine grand scriptures. Its previous name was Space. When Li Qiye flipped over a new page, it became a new entity named Myriad World by him.

This allowed him to utilize the powers of the various worlds; everything was within his grasp.

Because of this, the moment he pushed his palms together - three thousand worlds, an eternity, and endless grand dao accumulated inside his ten fingers and took the form of a suppressive seal with ultimate power.

How could the image of a progenitor stop such a devastating blow?

“No... this can’t be...” The people of Nine Secrets could finally stand up after the dispersion of the progenitorial aura.

Alas, some of them immediately dropped down to the ground again while murmuring to themselves. This matter was too much to accept.

Since youth, their progenitor was their everything, their heaven, a supreme and invincible existence. Nothing loomed above their progenitor in their mind.

But now, Li Qiye instantly pierced through the image’s chest and easily annihilated it. It was akin to him actually defeating their progenitor. Their greatest idol has collapsed just like that so they couldn’t handle the emotional impact.

“No... no...’ Some started crying.

Of course, they also cried when they saw their progenitor but the tears this time were different.

The first type came from their emotions, mainly pride. Now, it stemmed from despair and helplessness.

All of Nine Secrets realized the terror behind Li Qiye’s power. The five great powers? Supreme ancestors? Sacred Cabinet? All were mere ants before the king.

People looked up at Li Qiye, carving the image of this man into their mind - the man that has defeated their progenitor. Even the imperious and tyrannical Lucidity King paled in comparison before the might of the new king.

“Your Majesty...” Many prostrated on the ground at his sight even though he didn’t exert any direct pressure over them.

Experts were on their knees; the ancestors and Eternals lowered their proud head. Those below him didn’t dare to breathe loudly while quivering with fear.

People forgot all about the great powers and supreme ancestors. Even Lucidity King and their progenitor felt powerless before this man hovering in the sky.
