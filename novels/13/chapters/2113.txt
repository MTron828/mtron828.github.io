After the return to Arrogance, Li Qiye left the academy to see some old friends.

In a vast unknown was a large ship resembling a floating continent with mountains and rivers on top. It was virtually an independent world.

This was the vessel crafted by Li Qiye; the rest of the group used it to reach the tenth world.

“The Young Noble is back!” The people on board cheered; many rushed out to greet him.

He smiled after seeing that the group was safe and sound. Of course, he didn’t worry too much because outside of the tiger and dragon, there was also Bloodbull Godfiend’s group as the main fighting force.

More importantly, they had Immortal Emperors ready to help. As long as the vessel made it up here, there was no need to be afraid of an ambush from the Grand Emperors.

“Young Noble!” No one was more happy to see him than Li Shuangyan and Chen Baojiao. The two rushed up and gave him a hug for he was the most important thing to them.

He embraced them deeply. A long separation didn’t change this familiar feeling at all.

He moved on to hug the rest of the group and finally made it to Allpine. He looked at the guy and became pleasantly surprised: “Looks like your cultivation had improved.”

“It’s all thanks to your guidance. I tried again and have formed a totem to become a High God.” Allpine smiled in response. [1]

“You are a tree demon so you didn’t necessarily need to go on this route.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Right, I don’t think I need to become an emperor or a High God, I can see another grand dao.” Long Jingxian proudly joined in.

Li Qiye patted her head and playfully scolded: “It would be a waste of your twelve palaces not to chase after the Heaven’s Wills; you’re certainly talented enough to get them all.”

“Please, twelve wills aren’t that cool. I’m thinking about cultivating this grand dao with Wushuang; her archery and my dao can certainly slay a twelve-will emperor.” She lifted her head up with this claim, full of pride.

She had an absolute advantage in terms of talents even in the thirteen continents full of geniuses. With an immortal fate, she could still look down on those with immortal bloodlines!

The biggest problem was her shaky dao heart. If she had one like Mei Suyao or Ming Yexue, no one could stop her from grabbing all twelve wills!

“Stop bragging and keep training. If you don’t get twelve wills with your lucky talents, I’m going to teach you a big lesson.” Li Qiye scolded again.

“Hmph, who needs twelve wills? I found a method to still be as strong with no need for them.” She said.

He smiled with no intention of looking down on her. If she actually tried, it would actually be quite frightening. This was a level of talents virtually unsurpassable.

Li Qiye also went to see the godfiend and Old Xian from the War God Temple. He gave them a quick look and said: “Looks like all of you have changed, so much younger now.”

It wasn’t just a joke. These two seemed to have changed with a flourishing vitality now.

“The energy in this world is incredible; no, the chaos energy, far better than the nine worlds.” The godfiend said.

He had an extraordinary bloodline so the tenth world gave him a massive boost in power.

“Allpine actually wants to start over again with his cultivation. Sigh, we old men don’t have the same determination as him, still debating on whether to do it or not.” Old Xian said seriously.

Allpine was quite old but in terms of vitality, a demon tree like him had a natural advantage over Old Xian and the godfiend.

“Everyone can walk their own path towards the dao. It’s up to you and your determination. I won’t force anything but to do so without making up your mind will result in qi deviation.” Li Qiye smilingly said.

The old men needed time to think. They saw a new horizon after coming to the tenth world. They were certainly at the top back below but now, the sky was vast and the ocean deep. There was still a long way to go for him in the tenth world.

Li Qiye met everyone and noticed: “That girl, Su Zhen, got taken away?”

Heavenguard’s Su Zhen also came with Li Qiye to the tenth world. Of course, he had his reasons for taking her.

“Right, Miss Su Zhen was taken by Immortal Emperor Mu Tian.” Su Yonghuang nodded.

Su Zhen’s emergence had a lot to do with the emperor. He left her in the nine worlds hoping that Li Qiye would train her because she had a special relationship with Immortal Emperor Qi Zhen’s branch.

Now, when Li Qiye brought her along to the tenth world, the emperor realized his goal so he decided to personally train her instead. Moreover, Li Qiye had set up an outline already, he only needed to give a little guidance.

“Alright, no need to blabber on and on, come take a look at our Immortal Emperor Slaughtering Formation already.” The fiery Long Jingxian lost patience and pulled him away.

Even the cold Sima Yujian and Bai Jianzhen couldn’t help but smile after seeing the little girl wanting to show off the fruit of her effort. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

“Sisters, to formation! Show this ugly Qiye our invincibility!” Jingxian called out to the rest of the group.

Li Shuangyan and the others were ready on the plain beneath the gigantic vessel with the strongest formation prepared - Emperor Slaughtering!

“Buzz.” A silver arrow instantly materialized like a blooming flower radiating in the night sky. Both time and space fused with its light while dao runes paved a supreme formation.

The formation encompassed time and space, grand dao, yin and yang, reincarnation... It turned all of these affinities into a murderous tool.

This power exceeded all domains - anyone who took a step inside would instantly be slaughtered.

“Buzz.” Shuangyan entered the formation and began to assert control. She was the controller in charge of its variations.

The girl was always in love with formations and had a deep understanding of them even before meeting Li Qiye.

After gaining his guidance, she improved dramatically and headed for the apex of formations.

Perhaps no one in the nine worlds could match her right now. Alas, she didn’t have a stage to show off in the lower realms.

Right now, the girl has finished forming this formation, allowing her to truly show off her skills!

“Clank.” Chen Baojiao’s vitality erupted like the tempest with the saber in her hand. Both her sharpness and energy poured into the formation under Shuangyan’s command. She became the gate guardian - anyone who wanted to defeat this formation would need to get through her first.

The two of them had impeccable teamwork without any opening and weakness. Each time Shuangyan changed the variation, Baojiao would follow up perfectly.

“Boom!” Su Yonghuang’s Solar Physique at grand completion exerted its might, filling the formation with destructive capabilities. This meant that it could refine everything in the world.

Her grand dao was majestic; her dao foundation simple and pure. She was the pillar, stopping anyone from shaking the formation.

There was a jewel hanging above her head while she held a jade pendant. These artifacts boosted her real potential and made the formation reach a new height. She - as grand as a mountain - was the most suitable to be the host of the formation.

Shuangyan was the controller, Chen Baojiao the supporter, and Su Yonghuang the host. The trio brought the formation back to life.

“Poof!” The four matrons from the Blood Race joined the formation, turning into a primal source of power. They had a unique bloodline so when their vitality entered the formation, it turned into a massive ocean of blood, fueling the rest of the girls.

It didn’t take long before the formation was brimming with endless power, capable of fighting till the end of heaven.
