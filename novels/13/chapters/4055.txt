Chapter 4056: Bidding

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

This was expensive for sects, let alone an individual. Not everyone was as rich as Li Qiye and could spend millions and millions like a few bucks.

This would be acceptable if the item was worth it. This was not the case for the Tang’s plain.

“Fellow Daoists, are you interested in our clan’s properties?” An old man ran over while Li Qiye and Ning Zhu were looking at the listing.

“I am the 586th clan master of the Tang. Do you wish to buy the complete package or just parts of it?” He smiled enthusiastically. His gray outfit was well-fitted and tidied but not luxurious in the slightest. This must be due to his clan’s current state.

He had heard the report from the servants and immediately ran over to the auction house, hence his heavy breathing.

This was understandable since this listing has been around for years. People rarely inquired about it either, so he didn’t want to miss this chance.

“Yes, our young noble is indeed interested in your estate.” Ning Zhu began negotiating in Li Qiye’s stead: “However, your infertile plain is not worth ten million even with everything else attached.”

“It’s negotiable.” The clan master put on a bright smile and said: “We can take our time coming to a fair price for everyone. Plus, the entire package is not bad at all, we’ll even give you a dozen servants or so.”

Of course, mortal servants were worthless in the eyes of cultivators. They were as significant as insects.

The clan master had no deep attachment to the servants in their ancestral home. The clan had moved to the city for several generations now so gifting them away wasn’t a big deal.

“Clan Master, you already know the right price.” Ning Zhu said.

She wasn’t a princess that has been pampered since youth. Thus, her tough experiences during her impressionable days and her intelligence made her quite capable.

“Sir and Madam, if you are earnest in this purchase, I’ll acquiesce and lower the price by two million. Just eight million then, how about it?” The clan master asked,

He spoke as if he was giving them a good deal. In reality, he had offered everything to Armament Mountain for five million previously and was ignored.

Li Qiye had a smile on his face while Ning Zhu shook her head.

“If, if you really want it, then we’ll do five million, that’s as low as we can go. We’re only selling it due to our clan’s anemic state, I don’t even know how I’ll face our members after doing this.” The clan master put on a bitter expression as if he was forced to have a fire sale.

“It would be gone already if five million was a realistic price. Our young noble is willing to do one million.” Ning Zhu smiled.

“One m-illi-o-n?!” The clan master shouted and stretched it out like a rooster in the morning: “Is this a joke?! Our plain stretches for thousands of miles and you want to pay just one million for it?! Impossible, no, impossible!” He shook his head repeatedly afterward. Discover 𝒏ew chapters at novelbi𝒏(.)co𝒎

“How about two million from Starshooter Country?” A cold and prideful voice interjected.

A youth parted the crowd and approached the group. His expression showed how much disdain he had for those beneath him. He was none other than Starshooter Prince.

Back in Hallowed City, he had tasted numerous setbacks in Li Qiye’s hand. This was especially true during the last exchange where he was sent flying by Jian Sanqiang, suffering serious injuries and broken teeth.

How could he swallow this anger? Impossible. He looked at the two before cupping his fist towards the princess: “Long time no see, Princess Ning Zhu.”

His attitude changed tremendously compared to last time. Previously, he referred to her as “Your Highness” even though they were in the same group of ten prodigies. After all, she was going to be the future queen of Sea Emperor.

Now, the engagement was terminated and she became Li Qiye’s maid. He no longer needed to show reverence.

“Long time no see.” Ning Zhu wasn’t angry to see this and simply nodded.

“Clan Master Tang, our country is interested in your land. We’ll pay you right now.” The prince ignored the two and focused on the transaction.

It was obvious to those nearby that he wanted to trouble Li Qiye.

“You, you’re that legendary magnate, Li Qiye!” The clan master’s eyes lit up after realizing Li Qiye’s identity and didn’t hear a thing the prince said.

He had heard of the rumors before regarding Li Qiye’s generosity. He had thought about searching for Li Qiye to give him an offer. It turned out that Li Qiye found him first.

“Yes, that’s our young noble.” Ning Zhu replied.

Starshooter Prince didn’t appreciate being ignored. He clearly offered a higher bid yet the clan master dared to treat him like this?

“Clan Master, we will offer two and a half million, what do you think?” He took a deep breath. He didn’t shout but still added energy into his words. They resonated like bells and echoed in the listeners’ ears.

“You should drop the idea of competing against our young noble for this land.” Ning Zhu said flatly with no intention of insulting the prince.

This would only result in embarrassment for him so she tried to get him to stop. Alas, he found it annoying and uttered coldly: “Princess, you no longer have anything to do with Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom so buzz off, keep your mouth shut.”

She only chuckled in response and didn’t say anything else.

“A pleb like you should think twice before comparing wealth with me. Go find some shade and cool off because if I start, you won’t even dare to bid again.” Li Qiye lazily stretched and glanced at him dismissively.

The prince couldn’t handle being called a “pleb” due to his prestigious status and talent. He was a big shot wherever he went in Sword Continent.

“How unreasonable!” A friend of the prince shouted.

“Then bid then, don't think you’re the only one with money!” The furious prince barked back.

“I bid one hundred million.” Li Qiye raised one finger and said: “Still want to play?”
