Chapter 4300: Crushing

“Boom!” The empowered rocks and stones instantly turned into massive meteors.

“Rumble!” Explosions and quakes took over. Space trembled violently as a result of this incoming devastation.

“Are you seeing this?!” Everyone in Little Diamond became astounded.

The meteors left behind blazing trails, seemingly melting the sky.

“What is going on?!” On the other hand, the meteors scared the hell out of the demons.

Both sides thought that this was only an illusion. Earlier, even the biggest boulders had a size limit. The stronger disciples picked them up and threw them down the mountain.

However, these meteors were large enough to pierce the earth. The sudden change in size took everyone off guard, even the throwers themselves.

They performed the action and knew just how large the size was on top of the tossing power. They lacked the ability to change the rocks into meteors. There was no explanation for this.

“Activate!” Eight Tiger roared and his vitality erupted. Yin and yang appeared beneath his feet as he activated his grand dao, shooting a beam upward.

He exerted the limit of his cultivation and stars appeared. He summoned a shield with a tiger-head crest.

The crest turned into a roaring white tiger, ready to meet the meteors directly.

“Defense!” The frightened demons calmed down and shouted, following their sect master’s lead.

Various bestial roars could be heard - leopards, tigers, and many others. Buzzes and the sound of wings spreading echoed as well.

The demons reverted to their original form while still holding the various treasures. They activated their natural abilities in an attempt to stop the meteors.

“Boom!” The first one was stopped by the tiger demon’s shield. Nonetheless, the impact caused him to stagger several steps backward.

“Rumble!” The rain of meteors finally hit the surface.

A group of demons working together could manage to stop one or two. However, there were several hundred meteors smashing against the horde’s defenses.

This left them helpless regardless of their abilities and efforts.

“Ahh!” Heavy casualties happened instantly as they were crushed into a pulp.

Even the strongest member, the sect master, could handle it no longer. His shield shattered into countless pieces and he was sent flying while vomiting blood.

“Run!” He no longer cared about his or the sect’s reputation. Staying alive was the only thing on his mind so he turned and fled. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

“Run!” The few survivors of the horde wished that they could grow more legs right now to run even faster.

It didn’t take long before they were gone, leaving behind a scene of carnage.

The atmosphere fell into a hush. The victors stood there in a daze, unable to process reality.

No one applauded or expressed their happiness. The inside of their brain was either spinning or being completely empty.

Words couldn’t come close to describing this event. Perhaps “miracle” was a rare exception.

They were ready to fight to the death despite being clearly weaker than the enemies. Their sect was initially weaker, not to mention the death of their previous sect master.

Today, they obliterated Eight Demons without losing a single man. Moreover, they didn’t use a single treasure or merit law. They simply picked up rocks and threw them at the enemies. Who would ever believe them about this victory?

Little Diamond threw rocks to kill several hundred demon cultivators? Utterly ridiculous.

Nonetheless, there were proofs - the stench of blood and the corpses left behind.

Some disciples slapped themselves or asked their friends to slap them. The pain brought them back to reality.

“W-we actually did it. It worked…” The first elder shared the same confusion as everyone else.

In the beginning, he thought that his sect master had gone insane. Alas, they still carried out his order, hoping that Li Qiye was only playing around and had another ace card up his sleeve.

It seemed that he didn’t need anything else, just the rocks alone were sufficient. They looked up at the sky but saw nothing special.

“Why?” Elder Hu wondered why the rocks were suddenly empowered.

He and the elders had many questions but one thing was clear - Li Qiye was the prime suspect.
