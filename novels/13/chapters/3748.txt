Chapter 3749: Brave Girl

Hesitancy and doubt permeated the side of the holy ground. Losing to Liu Huaishi would be a great blow to the cause.

The members of the holy ground wouldn’t be able to keep their head high when facing someone from Righteous after losing.

Thus, they placed their hope on Dugu Lan, Phantom, and Hu Ben. Ch𝒆êck out l𝒂t𝒆st 𝒏𝒐v𝒆l𝒔 on nov𝒆l/bin(.)c𝒐m

Unfortunately, this wasn’t the right time for them to fight according to the plan. They needed to focus on the scion since they were the ace cards of the holy ground - the only geniuses that could actually keep up.

Thus, the later their involvement, the better. This made it harder for Righteous to understand their actual abilities.

Unfortunately, no other members present had absolute confidence in beating Liu Huaishi.

“Anyone at all?” Liu Huaishi asked again.

The common words were viewed as another insult by the other side. They were frustrated but couldn’t do anything.

“I’ll overestimate myself and fight you, Fellow Daoist.” A pleasant voice answered.

A woman stepped out, wearing a simple yet meticulously crafted dress. She wasn’t as beautiful as Dugu Lan but still had a special aura that made her unique and elegant. One would never get bored of staring at her.

“Senior Sister Xiaoyue! She’s stepping up!” A student from Duality shouted.

“Another of the five heroes from Duality.” Others recognized her.

Those from various powers became dejected because so far, both combatants were from Duality Academy.

“The academy is showing why it is number one during this time of crisis.” One big shot sighed and said.

The youths here had to admit that the students from Duality had more courage. First, it was Dugu Lan. Now, both Lin Hao and Chi Xiaoyue also stepped up.

Vajra didn’t take charge nor did the mighty Divine Ghost Tribe. Duality Academy was at the forefront when everyone else faltered. This was rather commendable.

“Can Chi Xiaoyue win? Lin Hao lost to Fengyun.” The crowd remained pessimistic.

Lin Hao and Chi Xiaoyue should be evenly matched. The problem was - Huaishi was far stronger than Fengyun.

“I think Hu Ben should be the one to fight.” A genius commented.

They knew that to obtain a win here, it had to be either Hu Ben or Phantom Sacred Child.

The holy ground couldn’t afford to lose two times in a row. Their vast land couldn’t muster someone to beat the geniuses from Righteous? That would be disgraceful.

“We’ll see, Sister Xiaoyue is from a great clan. She should have plenty of resources.” One Duality student said.

Most students showed her full support due to her bold choice.

“From what I know, the Chi isn’t a part of Buddha Holy Ground.” Liu Huaishi’s eyes narrowed.

“Right.” Xiaoyue nodded and gracefully responded: “The Chi isn’t a part of the holy ground but I am a student of Duality. I’m sure you won’t mind my getting involved.”

“It’s fine.” Xu Cuimei smiled and said: “Duality is a pillar of the holy ground. You can certainly fight.”

“Please give me pointers, Miss Xiaoyue.” Liu Huaishi took a deep breath and solemnly said.

“Same to you, Fellow Daoist.” Xiaoyue didn’t underestimate her opponent.

“Buzz.” With that said, she activated her vitality and auspicious energy billowed, fully enveloping her.

Her vitality was pure and regal, adding to her already immaculate temperament. She resembled the daughter of a supreme king, commanding respect and reverence.

“A member of the Pure Blood tribe.” An older expert became emotional: “The royal family of the Blood Tribe, so prestigious back then.”

“No, that’s not all...” An ancestor from this race took a careful look and noticed a faint lunar glow on her forehead.

A half-moon seemingly peeled from her forehead. She held it with both hands, looking like a supreme treasure or weapon.

The lunar glow combined with her pure vitality. She looked transcending and magnificent as a result.

“Half-moon...” The ancestor concluded: “Two great bloodlines, so pure too.”

Eyes were wide open. The members of the Blood Tribe were extremely excited.

Both Half-moon and Pure Blood were royal clans of their race. Though they have declined and weakened, they were still quite famous.

She could be considered a jewel of their race due to her pure bloodlines. The old Blood experts saw her boundless potential.

“Excuse me now.” Chi Xiaoyue uttered before activating the half-moon. It became blindingly resplendent.

“Clank!” The light then condensed into a single slash soaring straight at Liu Huaishi before the crowd could react.

It cut through space and left behind an afterimage. Spatial lines could be seen from the breaking process to the astonishment of the spectators.

The lunar slash seemed unstoppable. Even the toughest material would feel like tofu before its sharpness.

“Good move!” Liu Huaishi shouted and instantly used the whip that had been coiling around his arm.

“Raa!” As he swung forward, a dragon roar could be heard. The whip turned into a dragon with black scales. Its claws were just as sharp as the lunar slash and tore space apart.

“Boom!” The two moves collided, causing the region to quake violently.
