Chapter 4948: Unbeatable With A Broom

The sky suffered immense damage from the beams stemming from the eyes of a four-fruit dragon lord.

This had enough power to destroy Abroad and the gate to the academy, causing the old man to swing his broom.

Heaven and earth turned into an ocean of the dao. The beams themselves were stuck in this quagmire and lost control. As Maddened God unleashed his barrage, wanting to incinerate the academy, the old man’s broom had no problem extinguishing them.

Due to the dao fluctuation caused by him, spectators could somehow see his actions very clearly along with Maddened God’s fierce expression.

Since time seemed to be coming to a halt, the other dragon lords saw their chance.

“Go!” Stone Lion God roared and reverted back to his demon form - a colossal lion capable of swallowing the stars.

His target was Bai Shaojin and he didn’t hold back at all. His three allies, on the other hand, attacked the old man in unison.

They hoped to buy time so that the lion god would be able to seize Benevolence. They would then escape afterward, there was no need to stick around.

Arrow Saint channeled the power of the world and created a brilliant arrow. The light of the stars gathered at the tip; the dao made up the bowstring.

“Whoosh!” It pierced through everything in its path.

Reincarnation City Lord fully activated his sacred fruits. He became one with the wheel of energy behind him for a direct smash.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

This wheel when combined with three sacred fruits possessed a limitless weight. It had no problem crushing a territory spanning ten million miles.

Oblivion Monarch spread his withered wings and shot out feather blades. Each was as thick as a mountain range and pierced through the ground, causing violent quakes all around the region. He actually tried to kill the old man and didn’t hold back.

Thus, five dragon lords have initiated an all-out battle. This had enough power to break the entire academy, trapping it in an inescapable tempest.

Students were paralyzed in fear, unable to do a single thing. Some were even scared out of their mind and wet themselves.

The old man raised his room into the air. Its trajectory was accompanied by the myriad dao and the path turned into a resplendent true dragon.

Its aura was overwhelming and omnipresent. The lower three continents trembled as a result.

It soared and stopped all the incoming attacks by simply coiling into a defensive posture in the sky. The flame, wheel, feather blades, and arrows couldn’t move it an inch. Even the largest world would seem small compared to this coiling dragon.

“Leave!” The old man raised his voice and swung his broom. The dragon obeyed the command and performed a tail whip.

“Whoosh!” Nothing in its way could continue to exist. The attacks naturally dispersed into nothingness.

“Boom!” All five dragon lords were sent flying into the horizon. Their bones shattered as they vomited blood. They eventually crashed into the ground like meteors.

Silence returned to the academy. The early morning regained its tranquility; mist and fog descended, painting a poetic scene.

The destructive fight was a thing of the past, ended with a single swing from the old man. Five dragon lords have been utterly defeated by him.

He was obviously the strongest cultivator in the lower continents since Conceal Conqueror couldn’t have done this.

The astounded students saw him every day but didn’t realize how terrifying he was. Today was another example of why the academy was untouchable. Dao lords and conquerors preferred humility while visiting or studying at Abroad for a reason. The academy - all-accepting and untouchable.

The schoolmaster and Bloodsea were frozen, still trying to digest this information.

Only a single cultivator was on the move since she had a clear target in mind. No one noticed her as she approached Jian Yunyun who was standing near Li Qiye.

“Come with me.” The figure immediately immobilized her, revealing herself to be the empress dowager of Illumination.

Yunyun couldn’t react in time before losing control. She tried to scream for help but no word came out.
