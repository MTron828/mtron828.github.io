Chapter 5036: A Devoured World

Shadowrider glanced at Li Qiye with a complicated expression. He was an assassin king who lurked in the shadows. Thus, he had no one’s trust but Li Qiye allowed him to be in charge of an important role without supervision.

Of course, this didn’t mean that Li Qiye trusted him after a few conversations. It stemmed from Li Qiye’s invincibility.

Could he ambush Li Qiye’s group one more time and kill them? Or could he seal the entrance? By this point, he didn’t have the courage or the power to go against Li Qiye since that would be suicidal. The only thing he could do was to perform his duty of guarding the entrance and not letting anyone get close.

Li Qiye didn’t say anything else and entered the door. The youths had reservations but still followed him inside.

What they saw next astounded them beyond words - a massive world with countless stars. This wasn’t that uncommon in independent dimensions but it was entirely dead.

None of the stars had a single trace of life, let alone living beings. Among them was a great sun. Alas, it had countless cracks and its flames have been extinguished.

Similar death occurred to the other stars. One was split in half, another fell to the ground. Something had infiltrated their core and sucked the life out of them.

No grass or vegetation could be seen anywhere. Anything that once possessed life force has been drained entirely.

Li Qiye closed his eyes and scanned the area. Sure enough, the initial impression was correct - death was the only remaining affinity.

“So something like this was still left behind. What a ruthless geezer, sacrificing the entire world yet still couldn’t escape this fate.” Li Qiye murmured to himself.

As for the youths, this was their first time witnessing death of this magnitude.

“Wh-where is this place?” Ming Shi was anxious.

“An abandoned world.” Li Qiye answered.

“Abandoned? Who abandoned it?” Yunyun asked.

“Its protector.” Li Qiye said.

Yunyun had prior conversations with Li Qiye and had a deeper understanding of this subject. She blurted out: “This protector did this to their own world?”

“That is correct.” Li Qiye smiled.

“It’s insane, how many, how many people were living here?” Ming Shi was overwhelmed.

“How many lives are on the six continents? This might be larger.” Li Qiye responded.

“Impossible!” Goldcrest and Ming Shi blurted out in unison.

“Observe it again.” Li Qiye said.

The two sat down on the ground, unable to comprehend the horror. Their six continents were colossal. How could anything reduce all six down to nothing but death?

“There are many ancient emperors, conquerors, and dao lords here.” Ming Shi quietly said.

“They’re not the strongest beings in this world, only the starting point.” Li Qiye revealed.

“Only the starting point?” This was a new perspective for the two youths.

In their mind, these were the apex beings of the six continents. For example, Conceal Conqueror was the strongest in the lower continents but there are twelve-fruit existences above.

If conquerors and dao lords were only at the starting point, where were they? Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“How did this world die?” Yunyun has been focusing on the stars.

“As long as you’re strong enough, you can open your mouth and swallow all lifeforms in one breath.” Li Qiye said.

“Let’s not talk about this anymore.” Ming Shi was afraid of the possibility of these monstrous existences. The Ten Monsters were nothing compared to them if they could swallow stars.

“Why did the protector change their mind?” She calmed down and asked.

“Unable to maintain the original aspiration.” Li Qiye smiled and stared at them: “For example, let’s say you have a pet rabbit that you have been taken great care of. It grows up fat while circumstances make you feel rather hungry.”

“Stop, stop, if you keep going, I won’t be able to eat anything anymore.” Ming Shi felt nauseous.

“So we’re rabbits?” Yunyun shuddered.

“You think too highly of yourself then. For a being of this level, you can’t even be considered an ant. As for a rabbit, the true masters that you know, I suppose, can be at this level.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Do we have a protector too?” Ming Shi suddenly asked. She felt that there was a great guardian looking down on them.

Li Qiye only smirked in response.
