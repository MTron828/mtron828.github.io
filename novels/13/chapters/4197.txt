Chapter 4198: Dong Ling

Sea Emperor was the strongest in Sword Continent while Nine-wheel Citadel claimed the second spot. Their combined force could be enough to sweep through everyone.

If the continent were to unite, it would be enough to contest this alliance. However, politics and logistics made this impossible.

Spectators realized that Myriad Era was no longer in reach. This sword would eventually end in the pocket of these two behemoths.Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

“What gives them the right to do this?” A youth said indignantly while looking at the wall and the sword formation.

“What are you going to do about it? There’s nothing any of us can do, they’re too strong.” Another cultivator nearby said.

The youth couldn’t respond because reality was cruel. It would be futile trying to fight them.

“We need to band together.” A cultivator suggested: “The divine sword has no master and belongs to the virtuous, what gives them the right to barricade the area? Sword Ocean isn’t their house. They might be strong but logic and reasons still reign. Only evil sects do as they please.”

“You’re completely right.” Another became agitated after hearing this: “Putting the divine sword aside, I’m sure there are plenty of other treasures in there, they don’t get to monopolize it! Everyone in the world deserves a bowl of soup from this pot!”

“Let’s take down this wall and sword barrier, let them know that Sword Continent is a righteous land with laws and orders. Their haughtiness and arrogance aren’t welcomed here!” Another fanned the flames while actually attacking the two defenses.

“Boom!” The attacking treasure was instantly destroyed by the sword formation.

This reminded the crowd of how useless it was. Their raging emotion was immediately extinguished.

“What should we do?” Another asked.

The disorderly crowd couldn’t do anything outside of spewing grievances. They needed a leader right now, one with enough prestige and authority.

“What can we do, that’s the question.” A disciple from a large sect smiled wryly. Defeating the defenses required the same level of offense. Otherwise, it would only be courting death.

“Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom, Nine-wheel Citadel, this is rather disgraceful.” A calm voice suddenly sounded.

People looked back and saw an old man dressed in a simplistic style. He stood upright and looked rather muscular. His eyes were bright and had no sign of aging.

His hand movements contained a mighty sword intent; he himself resembled a sword ready to slash at any moment. Each of his words sounded like the hymn of a sword and contained a sword intent.

“Sect Master Ling Jian of Daoist Sword Ground!” Older experts recognized him right away.

“Senior Ling Jian.” Others came to greet him.

As one of the Six Sect Masters, he was famous alongside Pineleaf Sword Lord since they were both from the same generation.

“You’re right, Senior Ling Jian, they are pushing it right now.” Someone complained.

“This imperious act is unacceptable.” Another uttered.

“What gives them the right to take all the natural resources? We need to band together and stop their tyranny!” One youth was heated up and shouted.

“We need to teach them the character, ‘no’. They can’t take all of us on.” One more wanted to stir the crowd and cause trouble.

“What they’re doing is no different from the conduct of an evil sect. They deserve to be persecuted and punished.” One guy chimed in.

“Yes, they have fallen down the evil path, it’s time to eliminate evil!” Those antagonistic against the two sects took advantage of this opportunity.

“Hmph, eat as you like but watch what you say.” A scowl could be heard before a cold declaration: “There are consequences for running your mouth.”

A youth and his fellow sect disciples appeared. He embraced a sword while looking like the embodiment of an abyss.

“Abyss Scion!” The crowd recognized him right away.

His warning silenced the rowdiness right away. Cultivators spoke fiercely when there was no one from the two behemoths around.

They immediately kept their mouth shut after his arrival. Actually going against Sea Emperor and Nine-wheel required both courage and power. Further consideration was well-advised.

“We are merely speaking the truth, everyone can see what you’re doing.” One expert didn’t bite it and said what was on everyone else’s mind.

“That’s not up for you to decide. Henceforth, any attack or offensive comment will be considered a declaration of war towards Sea Emperor.” The scion’s eyes flashed frighteningly, causing others to swallow their words.

“I’m shaking in my boots right now, hahaha. Do you think your threat alone can shut everyone up?” Someone laughed and joined the conversation.

It was none other than Dong Ling, looking slovenly in dress and manner.

“Darn right!” Many voiced their support.

“I’m just stating facts.” The scion snorted.

“The fact is that your sect and Nine-wheel are trying to monopolize the treasures here when you have no claim on it in the first place. This imperious act is intolerable.” Dong Ling said, winning the love of the crowd.
