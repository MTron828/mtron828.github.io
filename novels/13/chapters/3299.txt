The dragon roar resembled a terrible storm assaulting Divine Black.

“Shit!” The elders elsewhere in the sect became startled.

“Clank!” With another ring, a gigantic dragon emerged from the hall, flew out then landed on the roof.

It roared again with more intensity than before, enough to frighten the nine heavens and ten earths.

“Noo!” Numerous disciples vomited blood.

The ones near the hall took the full brunt. Their vision turned dark as they fainted and fell to the ground.

The top masters of Divine Black became aghast after hearing the roars. As for the elders and protectors in charge of this trial? They were seeing stars at this point.

After a while, the unconscious disciples gradually woke up and saw some of their peers still laying there.

They got up and looked around, still suffering from dizziness. They had no idea what happened, only that Li Qiye became crazy and drummed the golden bell.

Eventually, a golden dragon came out and its roar rendered them unconscious. Thus, they began looking around for Li Qiye.

The hall was closed as well. The elders and protectors have come out.

Finally, they spotted him beneath an old tree. Gong Qianyue was sitting there and the same with him. He used her thighs as a pillow and was sleeping soundly.

Who knows if he was unconscious just like the rest of them due to the dragon or has been sleeping the entire time. Qianyue let him do so and even helped support his head. They looked awfully intimate like a couple in love.

Her fans naturally didn’t like this, feeling their anger rising inside. They averted their gaze and found Zhan Hu and Huang Ning sitting cross-legged on the ground.

Huang Ning had a cold glare at Li Qiye, the same with Zhan Hu. The two of them nearly got blown away by the roar. Fortunately, they reacted fast enough to prevent grievous injuries.

This was all because of Li Qiye for randomly knocking on the golden bell!

“Where am I? What happened?” More woke up and looked around, feeling the same discomfort as the others.

“Is the examination over?” Some didn’t know how long they have been sleeping.

“Not yet.” An elder answered.

“May I ask what’s going on?” One disciple asked the elder: “What happened here?”

“The golden dragon god...” The elder had a strange expression. He glanced over at Li Qiye and slightly opened his mouth, only to swallow his words in the end.

He wasn’t the only one with this expression. The other elders and even Zhang Yue found the whole thing bizarre.

This was unprecedented. The golden dragon had never appeared before. It seemed furious after being woken up, hence its powerful roar.

“A dragon god?” A furor broke out.

“Did, did he enrage the dragon god?” One of them speculated. They were still afraid of that mighty divine beast earlier.

“Definitely.” They were already mad at him for sleeping on Qianyue’s thighs and immediately shouted: “He messed with the divine artifact and enraged the dragon within!”

“It took its anger out on us because of him!” Another directed the blame at Li Qiye. This further increased the already-existing animosity.

They all saw him knock on the golden bell while assuming that this was a blasphemous act. Some started fanning the fire to make the crowd angrier.

“Be suicidal all you want but don’t drag us down with you. You messed with the patriarch’s artifact and offended the dragon god, this is a serious offense!” The jealous Huang Ning eventually said, coming up with an excuse to eliminate his love rival.

“True, this is being disrespectful towards the patriarch on top of injuring one’s peers. This person should be expelled from Divine Black, permanently.” Some became rowdy.

“That’s not enough, we should sacrifice him to the golden dragon to appease it.” A demon had a crueler idea.

“A dragon is our race’s divine beast. It’s sacrilegious to disrespect one, he needs to be punished!” Zhan Hu stood out and declared.

He felt that Li Qiye was a big threat and wanted to remove the guy, not to mention their little feud.

“Yes, capture and punish him.” Others had their own agenda.

“Sacrifice him to the golden dragon!” Many started chanting and calling for his death.

“Shut up! Useless fools!” Gong Qianyue who was looking at Li Qiye finally exploded. Her eyes became chilling as she roared thunderously. Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

The frightened disciples staggered backward after seeing this.

Her cultivation realm far exceeded anyone in the young generation, hence their fear.

“Junior Sister, you saw him disrespecting the ancestral artifact. Don’t side with him over this serious sin.” Huang Ning’s expression became unsightly since Qianyue picked Li Qiye time and time again.

“We can’t let him do as he pleases and must punish him for violating the sect’s rules.” Zhan Hu nodded and took advantage of the opportunity.

“Poof!” Qianyue raised one finger and let out some samadhi flame. The temperature nearby became scorching.

“Come, both of you, if you disagree with me. I just need one hand to beat you both.” Qianyue uttered coldly.

Domineering and overbearing - the style of the number one genius of Divine Black.

Huang Ning and Zhan Hu naturally didn’t like this, especially the former. Alas, there was nothing they could do against her since she was telling the truth.

The two of them combined had no chance of winning even if she was only using one hand.
