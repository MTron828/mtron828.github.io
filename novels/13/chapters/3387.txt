“Clank!” Three Truths Sect Master took out his sword again, primed to sever the sun and moon in a single slash. This naturally horrified everyone near.

“Raa!” The golden dragon’s roar crushed the myriad dao around it.

It swung its claw and sent out a suppressive force equivalent to a divine vein. This golden divine vein spanned ten million miles, enough to take down the firmaments along with the gods and devils.

It instantly crushed the sect master’s slash. His sword slash crumbled, inch by inch.

“Boom!” Next, it made contact with his sword, knocking it out of his hand. The claw continued to attack, pushing the sect master down into the ground.

“Crack!” A large pit was formed with cracks emanating from it. Blood oozed out from the center towards the edges. The bloody sect master couldn’t move at all beneath the dragon’s claw.

People simply couldn’t believe this. How could a sacred cultivator, a big shot in the northern West King, lose in a single move?

No one in this region was powerful enough to inflict this humiliating loss on him.

In fact, even the members of Divine Black were slack-jawed just like the rest. They knew that Li Qiye was very powerful after the death of Iron Whip Demon King. Some said that he was either as strong as their sect master or even stronger. Since the sect master was their strongest cultivator, he became the gauging method.

However, all saw how Li Qiye used one move to crush Three Truths Sect Master as if he was nothing more than an ant. He had no chance of reversing the tide.

This meant that Ping Suoweng would lose in the same manner against Li Qiye. Thus, the members of Divine Black were shaken. They themselves were ants too before him.

Ping Suoweng was mentally prepared for something like this. Alas, the unfolding of reality still overwhelmed him.

His lifelong rival lost utterly - a testament to Li Qiye’s terrifying might. At least he made the right choice in the past. Just one wrong move and the sect might have been destroyed by Li Qiye.

By this point, he could already see the fate of Three Truths. His sect didn’t even need to do anything to help.

“Yes!” The members of Divine Black calmed down and started cheering.

“Sect Master!” On the other side, the ones from Three Truths bellowed in astonishment. They needed to do everything possible in order to save their sect master.

The three daoists led their battalions onward towards Li Qiye, no longer minding the repercussion.

This might be suicidal but as disciples of Three Truths, they had no other choice. Dying to the last man was fine as well as long as they could save him.

“You’re courting death.” Li Qiye smiled at the army rushing towards him.

“Raa!” The dragon performed a tail sweep that robbed the light from the world. It was as if the sky vault was falling down in an apocalyptic manner.

The desperate members of Three Truths marched onward. Alas, this seemed rather futile. There would be nothing left of them soon enough.

“Retreat!” Lu Yiling shouted and made his move.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Three sword hymns echoed across the realms. Images of the three swords behind his back emerged.

Everyone became frozen by the presence of this majestic sword dao. Nothing could hope to reach its height. It was capable of splitting a new world into existence.

The images started circling and reversing the natural orders. They turned into a shield that can stop all offense.

“Boom!” The tail struck the shield instead of the army. Terrible shockwaves destroyed the nearby mountain ranges.

Though he saved his fellow disciples, he didn’t feel good at all. He staggered backward, as red as can be due to the chaotic flow of his internal energy. It took a while before he managed to stabilize.

Everyone took a deep breath at this sight. They knew that this genius was far stronger than Ping Suoweng and his senior brother.

Moreover, he used the power of the patrimony swords. Alas, the tail still had the upper hand in that previous exchange. He probably didn’t have what it takes to actually fight against the golden dragon.

“It’s over.” Suoweng concluded.

The Divine Black disciples clenched their fists in jubilation. This exceeded their imagination.

Lu Yiling intimidated them earlier with his incredible moves. Now, he didn’t seem to be that special when dealing with Li Qiye.

Li Qiye’s status soared again in the heart of these members, becoming peerless.

“What kind of monster is he?” The spectators were in awe. It was miraculous for a Bronze Tendon cultivator to be so strong.

They saw it with their own eyes but still didn’t understand due to the illogical nature of the circumstances. This was most likely unprecedented.𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m
