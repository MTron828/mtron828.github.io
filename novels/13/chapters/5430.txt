Shadows belonging to the sacrificed cultivators appeared behind Illumination Conqueror and began blessing him.

Devil and Riverwalker were particularly powerful. Although they were no longer alive, their cultivation remained intact and transferred to Illumination.

This was beyond an addition of raw power. His lifespan and true blood were boosted back to his prime. He reverted from an old man back to a young man with a torrential aura.

His anima tree seemed capable of absorbing all the forces in the world and turning them for his use.

“Boom!” This empowered state allowed him to draw more power out of the illusory realm. It started flowing visibly through him.

His tree remained the same size but its shadow became large enough to blot out the world. Being beneath this anima tree’s shadow froze all cultivators, Supreme and his allies included.

“Want to kill me?! I’m already prepared to die at any moment!” Illumination shouted in a frenzy.

He truly believed that he had done nothing wrong. All of his actions were for The People; the criminals were the ones attempting to stop him.

Li Qiye and All-things Dao Lord were sinners for standing in his way. Their neutral stance and compromises left The People in this weakened state.

Others sighed after seeing this descend into madness. Illumination no longer possessed the manners and bearings of an apex conqueror.

“You, a coward unable to handle the truth about yourself, will amount to nothing. You’re just raging due to your own incompetence.” Li Qiye said.

He still looked like a mortal while Illumination’s anima tree was enormous and imposing. The latter could be the ruler of all six continents.

Unfortunately, spectators would still bet their money on Li Qiye. The insane boost of power didn’t change their assessment of this situation. The illogical nature of this situation left them at a loss for words.

“Face my rage then!” Illumination attacked with the anima tree. It swung down at Li Qiye with an apocalyptic force.

Although only a small part of the tree was actually real while the rest had an ethereal form, this could crush a continent without a problem.

“Bam!” The result didn’t go as well as he hoped for.

Li Qiye caught the tree and uprooted it, prompting him to vomit blood while staggering backward.

“Bam!” Before he could catch his breath, Li Qiye smashed him with his own anima tree, drawing blood and crushing bones. He lay in a pool of blood, broken from top to bottom.

The crowd thought that they were about to see Li Qiye’s anima tree. After all, that would have been the move for Supreme and the others - retaliating with their own anima tree or utilizing their strongest treasures.

Li Qiye surprised all of them by still relying on mere physical strength. How did he uproot an anima tree so easily? Doing so meant he had absolute supremacy over his opponent.
