Chapter 4835: Submission

Disobedience meant death. A silence ensued since the overlords have grown used to being imperious.

They had never been beneath anyone; that’s utterly unacceptable. Alas, not obeying Li Qiye and joining Eight Desolaces meant being hunted down.

Therefore, the question was - would they be able to resist Li Qiye? How many others would fight with them?

In the past, they could have hidden deep in space and the bottomless abysses. Alas, they have come out to watch the fight and exposed their coordinates.

The light of the Primordial Tree was overwhelming, making it impossible to hide and escape. They pondered in silence and lamented their difficult situation.

“Da!” Silly Da cried out and next, it became engulfed in flames.

“Buzz.” A supreme grand dao with an eternal presence emerged. It resembled a great devil devouring heaven and earth. This phenomenon frightened the toughest of cultivators.Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

Silly Da naturally had a cataclysmic grand dao but it didn’t use this dao against Eight Desolaces or Li Qiye. On the other hand, this dao embedded itself into the Primordial Tree. The two became one and a seal of Silly Da could be seen on the trunk.

It chose submission and tied its fate with the Primordial Tree and Eight Desolaces.

“Betting it all in this generation…” Primeval Old Ghost murmured to himself.

“Boom!” His supreme dao emerged as well. Eight Desolaces felt like a boat stuck in a raging storm while inhabitants were dried leaves on a tree trying to not be blown away by the gales. He added his dao to the tree and made the same decision as Silly Da.

The light of the tree illuminated him and his vitality surged as if he has just gained another era. From now on, he was a supreme existence belonging to Eight Desolaces.

“Buzz.” Triune Immortal’s radiance crossed through an epoch on the river of time, filling up the sky of Eight Desolaces. She imprinted her supreme dao as well and joined the epoch.

“Boom!” In an ancient mine deep in Inner Wild, a supreme bird raised its wings. All the mines and ores in Eight Desolaces resonated with its light, resulting in colorful rays. This supreme existence also added its grand dao to the tree.

With these infusions, Eight Desolaces suddenly became several times stronger than before.

“Clank!” An ultimate slash came from Sword Burial Ground - eternal and indestructible with enough power to destroy an epoch.

Other supreme overlords trembled in horror after seeing the slash. However, it didn’t attack Li Qiye but simply joined the Primordial Tree.

Even this mighty overlord had joined forces with Li Qiye. The others started changing their mind since the scale had shifted.

Li Qiye didn’t need to do anything himself now because of his new allies. It seemed that there was no rebelling in this epoch. They might as well join and prosper with it.

“Boom!” A vortex made of black flames surged out in the air and descended for Eight Desolaces, albeit without malice. Its target was to join the tree.

“Let’s go.” In a bottomless abyss was a tree with verdant leaves. Life force blossomed and manifested into a supreme chapter. This dao also imprinted itself into the Primordial Tree.

“Rumble!” A large skeleton in a sea of bones stood up. It shot out a magnificent pulse and struck the Primordial Tree.

…

In just a short time, one supreme overlord after another chose to submit. As more of them joined, the others became less reluctant. Teaming up against Li Qiye turned out to be a fantasy.

Eight Desolaces brimmed with life force and power. Recently, it had suffered immense damage but now, it was able to reach a greater height.

Regular living beings didn’t know what was going on. However, all cultivators instantly felt the grand dao becoming lively. Cultivation became far easier; anyone could turn into an expert.

“Eight Desolaces will decide your fate.” Li Qiye then turned his attention toward Dao Sanqian. He flicked his finger and left a grievous injury.

Dao Sanqian was horrified and turned to flee.

“You’re not going anywhere!” Divine monarchs and ancient ancestors suddenly joined the hunt, many of whom have lost lineages and loved ones due to Dao Sanqian’s choice.

Therefore, Dao Sanqian ran like a stray dog while being pursued from all sides.
