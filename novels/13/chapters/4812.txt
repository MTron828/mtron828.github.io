Chapter 4813: Tearborn

Cultivators assumed that a supreme overlord would have an intimidating appearance and a flashy aura. For example, Triune Alligator Lord instantly scared the hell out of everyone. They felt insignificant like ants before him.

Dead Immortal’s appearance had the opposite effect. It resembled a large drop of mercury and possessed holy properties such as a halo and wings.

“A tearborn.” A supreme overlord whispered. She had knowledge of Dead Immortal’s epoch and race but this was her first time seeing one in the flesh.

“How strong is Dead Immortal?” An ancient ancestor asked.

Triune Alligator Lord was a monstrosity beyond comprehension. Dead Immortal didn’t give off the same feeling.

This made cultivators think that the being wasn’t quite as strong and would lose in a fight right away.

Dead Immortal didn’t care about these comments. It looked up in the sky after arriving in Eight Desolaces but there were no changes - no maelstrom and lightning bolts. It heaved a sigh of relief afterward.

In reality, this was on the mind of all the supreme overlords. They wondered whether a tribulation would show up to attack him.

The alligator lord was different from Dead Immortal. The former had never fought the high heaven so the absence of a tribulation was understandable.

Dead Immortal and some others were different. They had been suppressed by the tribulation previously. Thus, their appearance would invoke the heaven’s wrath.

“No tribulation? Looks like it won’t come again after Li Qiye’s grand tribulation.” An overlord said.

“Maybe Li Qiye has managed to hide this epoch somehow. Otherwise, someone like him is definitely a prime target for the high heaven.” Another speculated.

This was irrefutable since Li Qiye was similar to a supreme overlord. Those on his level weren’t allowed to stay in the mortal realm, hence the constant tribulations.

However, Li Qiye must have done something to shield Eight Desolaces, rendering it difficult for the high heaven to punish the offenders.

Triune Alligator Lord came out on an empty stomach while having a raging appetite. On the other hand, Dead Immortal wasn’t interested in anything but Li Qiye and his treasures.

“Fellow Daoists, anyone else wants to join?” Dead Immortal communicated despite not having eyes and a mouth. 𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

Everyone heard it clearly and could sense it looking at them. Of course, it was talking to the other supreme overlords. Regular cultivators weren’t qualified to be its “fellow daoists”.

No response came back from its peers. Li Qiye’s flesh was irresistible but they wanted to wait for the right time.

Dead Immortal alone was enough. If anyone else had shown up, it would mean terrible news for the inhabitants of Eight Desolaces.

“Very well, I shall help myself then.” It focused on Li Qiye with haste.

Everyone else could feel an intense scan, not only on Li Qiye but the entire world. All of them became trapped by something unknown, unable to move an inch.

This included non-living entities and natural orders as well. The waves stopped along with the winds. Time itself became frozen.

Cultivators tried to scream but words didn’t leave their mouth. Their grand dao and vitality have been sealed, leaving them as still as statues.

“Fame well deserved.” Another overlord praised after seeing the total seal.

Its confidence in its own abilities was the reason why it dared to show up right now. It remained as cautious as possible while dealing with Li Qiye.

It gathered its grand dao with each breath, not immediately rushing forward. It had seen Li Qiye in action before and wouldn’t be here if it wasn’t for the heavenly injuries.

After all, this was Li Qiye’s epoch. It would have been suicidal to go up against a peak-state Li Qiye.

Li Qiye showed no reaction to the current seal. The heavenly injuries seemed to command all of his attention.

Dead Immortal observed carefully just like the other supreme overlords. The latter wanted to use Dead Immortal as a way to gauge Li Qiye’s actual injuries.

If he was faking, they would be more than happy to watch Dead Immortal die in the process or perhaps, mutual destruction.

On the other hand, if the injuries were real, that’s when they would strike and potentially devour both.

“Boom!” Dead Immortal floated up and summoned a lightning bolt.

“Crackles!” The lightning affinity from all over Eight Desolaces started gathering on this single bolt.

“Nooo!” Everyone had electrical particles coursing through them. They just didn’t feel this particular phenomenon but now, these particles were being controlled by something else.
