Chapter 3562: Gluttonous Monk

“Amitabha.” The monk sauntered towards the bowl; his expression made it apparent how happy he was.

The students had no words to describe this. Prior to this, the monk used a Buddhist bowl to hold roasted meat. This was disrespectful enough. Now, it was time for the fish soup.

Even a fool could see the value of that treasure bowl. Many students here knew about its frightening origin.

Generations of sacred monks from Heavenly Dragon Temple kept then passed it down to the next. They also empowered it with their blessing.

Thus, this was nothing short of a holy artifact, a symbol of Heavenly Dragon Temple’s boundless abilities. Golden Cidada was given this bowl after gaining the recognition of the sacred monks due to his peerless talents.

Alas, no one expected him to use it for meat and wine instead of subduing evil and spreading Buddhism.

Nonetheless, they still found his current action questionable because they saw the dog and boar licking the soup bowl just now. This still wasn’t enough to stop the monk from using his holy bowl.

This was nothing short of sacrilegious and disrespectful to the temple and its sages. Unfortunately, Golden Cicada treated the bowl as nothing more than an old bowl for eating.

“If I do something like this, my seniors would break my legs.” A student murmured.

Others shook their head as well. Only Golden Cicada wouldn’t pay attention to his prestige and background.

“Not quite true, the supreme had a similar style back then. Everyone says that the Buddhist child might be the next in succession.” An older student quietly said.

The group shuddered after hearing the word, “supreme”. They didn’t dare to comment about this matter.

“Gao! Gao!” Lil’ Yellow saw the monk being too greedy and immediately barked.

He didn’t only want the soup but also the fish itself. Lil’ Yellow naturally wouldn’t stand for this. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Amitabha, I only want a piece, just a tiny piece.” The monk said this but he continued to pour the fish into his own bowl.

Lil’ Black didn’t mind initially but eventually growled after seeing how greedy the monk was.

Lil’ Yellow barked louder and louder while showing him its sharp teeth. If it wasn’t for Li Qiye, it would have bit the monk’s hand already.

If the high monks of Heavenly Dragon were here, they might actually vomit blood at this sight. The temple’s reputation was thrown away just like that.

“Little monk, don’t push your luck or I’ll let my dog bite you.” Li Qiye didn’t know whether to laugh or cry and shook his head.

“Gao! Gao!” Lil’ Yellow became more aggressive after hearing this. Its eyes exuded ferocity, ready to tear off the monk’s hand if he dared to take the entire fish.

The monk saw this and instantly let go. He revealed an awkward smile and said: “It’s just a misunderstanding, I never had any intention of taking the whole thing.”

He only took a portion of the fish before running away to the side and gulping down the bowl.

The two animals also learned from this and started devouring the soup. They didn’t even spare the fish bones.

This was the case for the monk too. He cleaned up the entire bowl without leaving anything behind. He continued to lick the bowl as if not satisfied.

The students thought that if it wasn’t for his fame, people might actually mistake him for a terrible monk who didn’t follow any creed.

“Amitabha, praise be Buddha.” The monk rubbed his stomach and smiled: “Benefactor, is your temple still recruiting? I don’t mind staying here.”

The monk spoke as if he was ready to abandon Heavenly Dragon Temple for good food.

“No, you have a bad stench of meat on you despite being a monk.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Amitabha.” The monk placed his palms together and smiled: “Benefactor, my bag of skin might be smelly but my appearance is brimming with Buddhist light...”

“Get out.” Li Qiye said without bothering to look at the guy.

“Little monk, provoke my young master and he’ll throw you into the wilds as a feast for the beasts.” The old man shook his head.

Golden Cicada shuddered and placed his palms together: “Amitabha, thank you for the meal, Benefactors, I’ll be going now.”

Having said that, he bowed then waved his sleeve, leaving in a cool manner just like a dignified monk. The only problem was how oily his kaaya was.

The students watched him leave and didn’t know what to do next. However, a dozen men descended from above. They were from the academy judging by their uniform.

“Finally found you brats.” The leader was a middle-aged man with a muscular build. He heaved a sigh of relief after seeing all of them here: “Idiots, you think you’re strong enough to run around in Myriad Beast Mountains? You must be tired of living, I might as well throw you all off a cliff.”

“Teacher Du.” The students obediently accepted the scolding.

“Whatever, it is good that nothing happened.” The man glared at them and said: “Remember, you’re responsible for your own death here.”

Though the academy had abstained from any responsibility, some teachers still tagged along in order to avoid needless casualties. That would be a heavy loss for the academy.

“Who are these gentlemen?” The man noticed Li Qiye’s group afterward.

“Teacher, he is Young Noble Li who helped the three of us, taking us in last night.” Xiao Ling reported.

“Thank you.” The teacher bowed, finding the whole thing strange. He has never heard of people living here before.

Moreover, he couldn’t see through the old man at all. On the other hand, he didn’t care for Li Qiye because the guy was too ordinary and obvious.

“Leave if there’s nothing else, don’t disturb my young master’s peace.” The old man said before Li Qiye’s command. He didn’t know what the temple meant to Li Qiye but the guy clearly didn’t like people arguing here.

“Yes, of course. My apology for troubling you three.” The teacher bowed again and left with the students.

Nonetheless, he couldn’t help glancing back at the old man one more time, thinking that he looked a little familiar. He thought that they had met but didn’t remember the exact location and time.

This was a strange feeling. He shouldn’t have met a servant like this in the first place, let alone having a faint recollection.
