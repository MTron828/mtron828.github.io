Divine Black became quiet after the battle. Both the older elders and new disciples kept to themselves.

Even the geniuses stopped being arrogant. Everyone focused on cultivating instead of causing trouble. The whole place became as productive as can be - an unprecedented period.

Of course, Li Qiye became an insurmountable existence right away. They knew that Ping Suoweng was no longer their number one expert.

A while ago, most compared him to the young generation, such as Gong Qianyue or Zhan Hu and Huang Ning. Now, he was clearly above any of them including Qianyue.

He had solidified his position in Divine Black. Therefore, whenever he appeared, everyone would greet him from afar, make way, and lower their heat.

Even the protectors and elders did the same, assuming an inferior role. His status was above their sect master right now.

Another interesting note was Gong Qianyue’s vision. She was talented on top of having keen insight.

She was the only one who listened to him while the rest treated him with disdain. Now, they realized the gap between themselves and her. They were blind and couldn’t see Mount Tai. Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

Li Qiye didn’t oppose these changes. They didn’t affect him in the slightest.

The only problem was that his door was about to break from the seniors knocking on it repeatedly. They wanted to learn cultivation from him.

It started with the chief elder. He figured out that Liu Fuyou was taught by Li Qiye and managed to cure his wound. Thus, he put on a thick face and came to ask for guidance.

After a brief session, he automatically understood where he went wrong. The others came running, even the peak lords.

Normally, they were respected seniors and regular disciples didn’t have the chance to ask them any questions.

Today, they lined up in front of Li Qiye’s place, acting as students in love with learning. Many disciples saw this and were at a loss for words.

Nonetheless, some were lucky enough to receive guidance from Li Qiye when he felt like it. They became grateful after gaining immense benefits.

Alas, this productive atmosphere didn’t last long for Divine Black.

“Boom!” A stomp crushed its entrance.

This naturally alarmed everyone so they looked over.

“Clang! Clang! Clang!” Alarm bells went off everywhere.

“Gather up, maintain the defensive lines!” An elder immediately ordered.

“Enemies are attacking!”

Disciples returned to their post while many elders found this shocking. It has been a long time since an attack on their sect.

“Rumble!” The enemy was fierce and the first set of guards couldn’t stop him.

“You’re out of line, Fellow Daoist!” A roar came from Jade Bird as a large wolf emerged. It spewed out a fiery seal towards the enemies.

The combatant on the other side swallowed in worldly essences and rushed to the sky before forming a mudra in order to stop the incoming seal.

“Boom!” The sky exploded as a result and shock waves frightened the weaker disciples.

One could see that the two were evenly matched.

“Poof!” Flames billowed like clouds as a person walked out of Jade Bird. He had a human body and a wolf head with a fierce glare. A bestial aura engulfed him.

“Junior Uncle Zhang, he got this!” The guards by the entrance immediately retreated at this sight.

Zhang Yue arrived at the entrance and glared at the enemy.

The intruder was a middle-aged man wearing a daoist robe with three colors. Everyone in the northern West King knew that this was the uniform of Three Truths.

“Chief Protector.” Zhang Yue furrowed his brows and said.

“Flame Wolf King.” The man remained proud despite being in the enemy’s territory. He stared at Zhang Yue and said: “It has been several decades since our last meeting, Dao Brother Zhang.”

“Indeed.” Zhang Yue replied: “This entrance of yours is a little unusual.”

The crowd watched with bated breath. The truce between the two sects has lasted for decades but now, the chief protector of Three Truths attacked Divine Black. This certainly didn’t look good.

“What’s unusual is how your sect killed our members.” The chief protector strongly retorted: “My disciple and division leaders died while I only destroyed your gate. It’s not comparable.”

Everyone could sense his rage right now. His disciple, Chen Chen, stood out in the sect. He put in considerable effort grooming the boy and had high hopes for him. It was all a waste now.

He came aggressively, destroying Divine Black’s entrance and injuring its disciples. This was his way of seeking revenge.

Zhang Yue expected this and answered: “Fellow Daoist, there’s a misunderstanding. We are willing to discuss this with you.”

Divine Black wasn’t afraid of Three Truths. However, continuing the pact was something the former wanted instead of a bloody war.

“What misunderstanding? Your side killed two division leaders and my disciple and you’re standing here, telling me that it’s a misunderstanding?!” The chief protector scowled: “Your sect has violated the pact! This is a declaration of war!”

The spectators’ expression became solemn. No one would view a potential war lightly.

Both sides were evenly-matched so the war would last for a long time.

“That’s your perspective. From our side, your division leaders trespassed and tried to rob our disciples, going as far as trying to kill them. Thus, it was nothing more than self-defense.” Zhang Yue responded.

“And yet three people from our side died from this so-called self-defense.” The chief elder snorted.
