Chapter 3812: Merciless Heaven

People shuddered once this so-called Void Zone was brought up. Even the veteran ancestors’ mind trembled after hearing the name. [1]

Void Zone was an unreachable area for all cultivators. Even dao lords looked up towards this place.

Most tried for their whole life just to earn one visit there. Unfortunately, fewer than few were qualified.

In fact, not even dao lords could earn an invitation. For example, the brilliant Blessed Dao Lord both admired and feared Void Zone. According to the rumors, this dao lord never got an invitation to go there.

Outside of a few special ancient emperors, Puresun Dao Lord and the duck egg buyer have entered there before.

Too many legends existed for this profound and mysterious place. Some even considered it to be an immortal realm. Alas, the fortunate visitors remained taciturn on what they’ve seen.

Because of this, Eight Desolaces had a pitiful level of knowledge regarding this area. This gave birth to some ridiculous speculations and rumors.

The only absolute consensus was that it was not a place to be trifled with. Even the top existences seemed fearful and always trod carefully regarding this topic.

“Duality Master has quite a reputation.” One ancestor remarked: “Even True Immortal Sect didn’t enjoy the privilege of being visited by someone from Void Zone.”

There were plenty of emperors in the ancient era and dao lords. However, when these beings got to the top and proved their dao, they might not receive a congratulatory visit from an official messenger of the secret realm.

Perhaps Void Zone paid no mind to them, only viewing them as nothing more than a strong cultivator.

On the other hand, Duality Master was unique. Void Zone brought weapons and manuals to the founding of his academy.

“Is Void Zone really strong?” One junior knew nothing outside of the name. He was curious to see the solemn expression of the ancestors and high elders.

“More than that, it’s a taboo existence.” An ancestor replied.

“Taboo existence? what do you mean?” The junior continued to ask.

The ancestor stopped, not wanting to dwell on this topic. An expert nearby answered instead: “Taboo as in, just one command can result in total destruction for countless sects.”

The young ones were astounded to hear this ridiculous answer.

“Really? How can it be so strong?” The junior remained skeptical.

Alas, the seniors no longer wanted to talk about it. It was best not to talk about this entity due to the potential disaster entailed. The young ones were calves, still unafraid of a tiger. But as for them, they knew just how frightening Void Zone was. Their meager power was nothing in comparison.

Meanwhile, the scion stared carefully at the unsheathed Trinity. Normally, he always had a proud and lively expression. Some would call this arrogance and contempt for others. This was no longer the case.

“My spear is not a match for your sword.” He eventually sighed and concluded.

“The user matters more than the merit law and weapon. I might not be able to beat you even while using Trinity.” Dugu Lan replied.

She paused for a bit and humbly added: “I was fortunate enough to earn the grace of the seniors and have the opportunity to learn Trinity Sword Art and wield this sword.”

The experts exchanged glances. They realized that by doing so, the academy was clearly grooming her to be a pivotal pillar there.

“Today is my lucky day, to be able to witness Trinity Sword Art. Please give me pointers, Fairy.” The scion happily said.

“The same to you.” Dugu Lan replied in a straightforward manner.

She then slowly raised the sword. During this process, everyone felt as if their fate was in her hand despite a lack of flashiness and fanfare, that the blade was next to their neck and primed for decapitation.

This sense of helplessness was overwhelming even though all she did was raise the sword.

“Go!” The scion was as serious as can be while holding his spears with both hands. He immediately summoned a dao path beneath and thrust his spear forward, severing the reincarnation cycle along with the yin and yang. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Boom!” The apocalyptic attack horrified the spectators. It was absolutely capable of instantly flattening a kingdom. They knew that they had no chance of surviving this attack.

On the other hand, Dugu Lan didn’t panic and observed the incoming thrust.

“Clank!” Trinity’s white side unleashed a supreme and merciless slash.

A blossoming lotus flower only appeared for a split second before being replaced by a sword thrust.

Merciless Heaven - the thrust looked like the onslaught of heaven itself.

The scion switched his stance to a defensive one. His spear sealed and severed everything; even the gods couldn’t get through.

Alas, the severing couldn’t stop the sword thrust. Trinity made it through the defense while the scion reacted quickly by leaping backward. The entire thing happened too fast for the spectators to see.

Blood splashed along with a hushed groan from the scion.

People then saw him stopping with a wound on his shoulder, staining his robe. Albeit, this was only a flesh wound.

Nonetheless, people were still shaken. It was exceedingly difficult to injure someone at his power since his body was as tough as steel.
