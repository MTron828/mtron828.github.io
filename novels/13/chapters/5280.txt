Chapter 5281: Collision

The ship resembled a continent taking the group for a vacation through space. Findd new 𝒔tories on nov/e(l)bin(.)com

Meanwhile, Li Qiye focused on observing the middle-aged man who didn’t seem to know the meaning behind the word “fatigue”.

Li Zhitian and the others started watching him as well. The youth didn’t have a strong reaction, unlike the old servant.

“This is…” The latter thought about a particular legend that had disappeared among the river of time.

He activated his heavenly gaze and could see that the man was not just an illusion. However, was he dead or alive? Or was this a being coming out of a dream?

As for Li Qiye, he had questions at first but after enough time observing the minute details, he obtained an answer.

“Rumble!” Suddenly, the ship shook violently and the group nearly fell over.

It crushed into several stars and came to a halt. As everyone regained their senses and looked ahead, they only saw a thick fog shrouding the path forward. This was akin to a giant reef in the sky, causing the ship to be stranded.

The middle-aged man suddenly jumped off the ship into the fog, disappearing from sight.

“Hey!” Li Zhitian shouted after seeing this.

“What should we do now?” Li Zhitian looked around and noticed that the ship was no longer moving.

“Give it to me.” Li Qiye raised his hand and asked for the ghost face.

Li Zhitian has been holding it the entire time, occasionally taking a look out of vigilance. Thus, he had no problem tossing it over to Li Qiye.

Li Qiye moved to the curved bow and placed the ghost face down where the middle-aged man sat prior.

“Buzz.” He used a supreme law and pinned the creature down into the ship.

He summoned the grand dao in his hand and created a dao blade. He swung it like a master artist swinging his brush. Every stroke flowed seamlessly with exquisite precision. Each detail was as smooth as the flowing clouds, giving spectators a sense of flawlessness.

Just like that, the hideous ghost face was replaced by a beauty in white thanks to Li Qiye’s profound artistry.

Though her hair covered her face, just her curves and outline alone were matchless.

Li Qiye reached forward and released shimmering golden dao essences to create a new foundation for her. With this infusion, she gained a gorgeous and gentle glow - looking like a goddess of the moon.

“Oh my goodness…” Li Zhitian shivered after seeing the lunar goddess and got goosebumps everywhere. This was once a frightening creature with teeth that had nearly devoured him.

Now, Li Qiye molded it into a wonderful work of art. Those in the know found this rather creepy.

“I can’t trust beauties from now on.” Li Zhitian turned pale, thinking that everything was a lie.

“That’s why the wise teaches us to be wary of beauties.” Li Qiye glanced at him and joked.

“I think I’m going to be a bachelor for the rest of my life, thinking that there is a venomous snake hidden within every woman.” Li Zhitian said.

“That’s an issue with your dao heart.” Li Qiye chuckled before placing the oar discarded by the middle-aged man into the hands of the peerless beauty.

He created a new talisman and embedded his grand dao within, sealing it into her forehead.

“Activate.” He chanted and the woman began rowing.

“Rumble!” The ship escaped from the broken stars and surged swiftly again, seemingly happy to be in motion once more.

“Where are we going now?” Li Zhitian asked while staring at the vast expanse.

“Wake up now!” Li Qiye suddenly shouted with the force of a thunderous bell. The command reverberated inside their mind, causing them to tremble.

They suddenly woke up and found that they were sitting in the meditative pose back in the desert again.

They looked over yonder and saw the tavern on top of the sandy hill. Nothing had changed, not even the massive bones around them.

“Are we dreaming?” Li Zhitian stood up and tried to find the inhabitants of the city.

Unfortunately, he couldn’t find anyone, not even the remarkable ship above.

“That ghost face wasn’t real either?” He asked Li Qiye.

“Real and fake, true and false, who knows?” Li Qiye answered with a smile.

He could tell that Li Qiye knew the actual answer.

“Young Noble, why did you propel the sand ship again?” The old servant brought up something else.

“The joy should continue to soothe the restless souls.” Li Qiye said.

“I see.” The old servant sighed, aware that they were not dreaming but were actually in someone else’s dream.

“Rumble!” The tavern started running again.
