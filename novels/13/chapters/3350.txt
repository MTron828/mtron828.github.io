The moment the sun showed up on the second day, the levels around the stage were filled with spectators. Some climbed up on the trees and buildings nearby; others floated in the air.

They wanted the best angle to watch this fight. Maybe a miracle would happen. Most have been here since earlier.

The powerful seniors such as protectors and elders could be seen too. Even the peak lords didn’t want to miss it. However, they hid in the clouds instead of joining the crowd.

A popular event like this was rare in Divine Black. Not even a fight between protectors could gather this audience.

“Boom!” A figure landed on stage, causing the ground to shake. Fortunately, the floor was reinforced or there would be a pit right now.

“First Brother!” Many demons cheered.

It was none other than Zhan Hu. He looked different today with a full set of armor on.

This armor was incredible, white from top to bottom with tiger runes. It looked like a White Tiger had taken over him. One could hear the roars of this divine beast from each of his movements.

He resembled the king of tigers and could command a tsunami of beasts to eradicate his enemy.

The armor also felt exceedingly tough on top of being powerful. Most importantly, it had fused perfectly with him, giving him a divine bloodline.

“Divine Tiger Blood Caparace.” Ordinary disciples had no idea but the experts became startled.

“High-level earth from the tiger demon clan.” A protector said.

This belonged to a high elder of the tiger clan, excellent in both offense and defense. It was left behind by a great tiger demon - an artifact made from precious metals and tiger blood.

Moreover, a dao bone of a high-level earth furious tiger was infused into this armor as well, resulting in the runes.

The high elder became unstoppable partly due to this armor. He viewed it as his baby and always wore it.

Most were surprised to see Zhan Hu with it now.

Of course, Zhan Hu himself couldn’t borrow this armor. His father was the one who asked to borrow it so that Zhan Hu could kill Li Qiye.

It wasn’t only because of the personal feud. The tiger king also wished to use this opportunity to suppress the humans’ influence in Divine Black.

“That’s halfway to victory.” An elder said: “Very few in our sect can penetrate that armor, it requires a dao lord weapon.”

Plenty of protectors and elders agreed with this. Ping Suoweng could certainly do it for sure. Others would need powerful weapons.

As for Li Qiye, he had no chance of doing so using his bare hands. That’s why the elder thought that this match was over.

“A high-level earth armor? How is he going to break it?” Those who didn’t know about this particular one still recognized its high grade.

A similar level weapon might not be enough to do the trick, let alone one’s bare hands. That’s simply daydreaming.

Zhan Hu stood on the stage, looking spirited and fierce. His murderous intent roamed freely.

This was a fight to the death anyway. He wanted to decapitate Li Qiye and turn his head into a chamber pot.

Huang Ning arrived a little later, looking gentlemanly compared to Zhan Hu’s domineering style.

He walked across the sky with green vines beneath his feet. The vines moved first and he walked on them.

His natural and heroic demeanor on top of his handsome appearance made the girls scream.

Today, he had a stick wrapped on his back - a stark contrast to his cool appearance.

The stick looked like a dried branch with many cracked locations. A few leaves grew on it, looking green like jade and brimming with life.

The leaves instilled exuberant life forces into him. It was as if he had an endless forest within him.

Everyone could see the source of this life force. The stick continued to pour this affinity and power into him.

His vitality became boundless and ready to strike like a hungry beast.

“Verdant Bamboo Stick.” All the elders became surprised.

“The bodhi king actually gave this to him? Wow.” One of them blurted.

Many experts knew that the bodhi king was the oldest in Divine Black, even older than Ping Suoweng.

He was a tree demon, mighty and knowledgeable.

The upper echelon was aware of this particular stick - one of his favorites. Wielding this stick meant possessing endless life force.

This meant having endless vitality, or in other words, chaos true energy. They could fight and fight without getting tired. This would allow them to fatigue a stronger opponent.

The origin of this stick remained a mystery. Some said that the bodhi king used his own roots to create it. Others said that he found the source of a treasure bamboo tree and refined it into this stick. Reêad latest 𝒏ov𝒆ls at n𝒐𝒐v/e/l/bi𝒏(.)com

It clearly showed his strong support for his disciple. Iron Whip Demon King saw this stick and heaved a sigh of relief.

The bodhi king’s stance couldn’t be guessed in the past. Now, he was clearly on the side of the demons.

“We’ll win for sure.” Zhan Hu and Huang Ning nodded at each other. They came to an understanding - they must leave this place alive and Li Qiye must become a corpse!

They waited patiently for Li Qiye to come.

As time passed, virtually everyone in Divine Black was present to watch this fight. The chief elder and Zhang Yue were up near the stage too.
