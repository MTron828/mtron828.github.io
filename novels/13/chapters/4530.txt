Chapter 4531: Courting Death

Untethered Vajra roared and tried to break free, unleashing one golden dragon after another. His mighty power assaulted the sky and stirred the heart of spectators. Their legs trembled with fear.

Unfortunately, his effort and the devastating golden dragons were stopped by Wise Ancestor.

Spectators didn’t know how Wise was so strong. The vajra’s techniques were frightening. Each dragon could rend the earth or destroy any ancestor, let alone them. Alas, Wise still managed to stop the vajra from helping Alchemy Child.

“Untethered Vajra is worthy of his fame as the number one vagabond. He’s strong enough to contend against any ancient ancestor.” One expert said with admiration. The vajra’s techniques and power could let him roam the world uncontested.

“This Wise Ancestor is so scary too, how come I haven’t heard of his domination before?” A youth asked.

“The Wu was a behemoth, at least during the Chaotic Era. They reigned for a long time but eventually declined.” A last-gen cultivator explained.

The spectators had no idea that the two were acting because they weren’t holding back with their auras and techniques. They just had enough control to not hurt each other.

“Majestic Sky Dragon!” Untethered Vajra roared and summoned a massive golden dragon.

It had small dragons accompanying it and the horde coiled around him. He looked magnificent and divine just like a dragon god. It seemed as if he could control all dragons. He then commanded all the dragons to attack WIse Ancestor.

The flashiness of the attack made Wise nearly burst out in laughter. He couldn’t let the guy down and shouted: “Sword Firmament!”

Thousands of swords manifested into reality and rushed to meet the dragons. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Rumble!” Sure enough, Wise managed to stop the draconic assault with his sword without any problem.

While the two combatants were relaxed inside, spectators found their attacks horrifying, not wanting to become needless casualties.

At first, Alchemy Child had hopes of Untethered Vajra saving him. After all, the guy’s power was recognized by True Immortal, hence their request.

Alas, he watched the vajra being pushed back time and time again. Despair started to surface inside his mind.

Li Qiye found this rather amusing. The vajra was trapping the youth who had no idea. He should have been an actor instead of a cultivator.

“I’ll kill you then since you won’t make a move. The result will be the same anyway.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Do-do you wish to suffer the wrath of True Immortal?! My-my sect will avenge…” Alchemy Child billowed.

“My ears have calluses from listening to the same words over and over again.” Li Qiye waved his hand and interrupted before moving onward.

Since he was only a servant, there was no reputation and prestige to worry about. He turned and fled, not expecting his plan to go south so quickly.

Alas, he saw Li Qiye blocking his path and was horrified. He immediately changed direction only to see Li Qiye in front again.

“To hell with you!” This happened several more times before he gave up and attacked: “Phoenix Claw!”

“Poof!” Flames engulfed his hands and turned them into phoenix claws capable of crushing any physical affinity. He reached for Li Qiye’s heart with this attack. The flames alone could reduce any opponent to ashes.

“This is a top technique from True Immortal.” One spectator commented.

Alchemy Child couldn’t actually use the technique correctly. Alas, it was rather famous so people were surprised.

“Even a servant has access to this technique?” One expert said.

“It’s because the young emperor values him and probably gave him many things.” Another murmured.

For other great powers, only elite disciples had access to this level of merit law, not an alchemy servant.

Unfortunately, the youth didn’t master the technique. Li Qiye simply crushed the move and grabbed him by the throat, dangling him in the air.

“Re-release me!” Alchemy Child panicked and bellowed: “M-my master is True Immortal Young Emperor. Master, save me---”

“Crack!” He couldn’t finish before Li Qiye added a bit more force and crushed his neck. His legs then went limp.

Time came to a halt as everyone watched his death.

“He killed the young emperor’s servant, this is serious.” One cultivator regained her wits and said.

Everyone understood that Alchemy Child was only a servant in True Immortal. However, his master was an heir.

As the saying goes - check the dog’s master before beating it. Though most found Alchemy Child annoying, they wouldn’t have escalated the issue. This was akin to slapping the young emperor in the face and provoking True Immortal.

Li Qiye, on the other hand, tossed the corpse away and said: “I’ll kill your master too if he dares to come.”
