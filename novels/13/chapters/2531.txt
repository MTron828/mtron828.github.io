The emperor’s eyes turned cold with a blinding radiance, capable of shining even the nine levels of hell.

“Don’t be so confident!” His thunderous roar was intimidating. He stood there like a supreme sovereign, robbing everyone of their breath.

The three swords in front of him had a cold glint, causing everyone to shudder. Their flashing glimmers pricked harshly down to the bones.

The crowd could already sense a murderous intent before an attack as if the swords were next to their neck. Decapitation could be next.

“Go, I’m waiting to see your comprehension.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

“Very well.” The emperor said.

“Clank!” The three swords resonated at the same time.

Everyone could hear their hymn and felt their hair standing on end because the sound went straight for their heart, seemingly originating from there.

This was akin to a direct assault on the heart, creating a penetrating pain. Many staggered backward from this unpleasant feeling.

“Buzz.” Space fluctuated, seemingly being cut apart. The three swords began to rotate around the emperor.

At the same time, runes were surging out of the emperor. In this blink of an eye, he seemed to have endless runes as they slowly covered him. These runes were ancient and profound; each wielding considerable power. This was no different from the emergence of three thousand worlds.

“Clank!” The three swords have opened an ancient world filled with lights. It immediately stabilized and locked on to the runes around him, resulting in a massive formation.

It instantly trapped Li Qiye within. This domain had its own sun and moon with blood flowing everywhere. The stench was horrifying; same with the murderous pressure. People didn’t only shudder but would become nauseated as well.

Strange sizzles could be heard. It seemed that if any existence in this world were to let down their guard even a little bit, the pressure could instantly turn them to blood.

This was quite frightening. Just the atmosphere of the formation alone was extremely fatal.

“Boom!” After the formation took form, the emperor gathered his vitality and became resplendent.

“Rumble!” Myriad Formation Kingdom in the distant also exuded blinding lights. With the kingdom in the center, rays of light traveled to different places in Nine Secrets and started sucking out power.

These various forces from the system became pulsing rays and headed for the emperor.

The rays eventually converged into a single pulse and shot straight for the emperor.

He opened his fate palaces and absorbed the incoming energy in full. An inferno rushed out of his body and ravaged the sky.

He turned into a sacred deity, pulsing with a blinding radiance, no longer belonging to the mortal world. He was no different from a being from above, wielding an ancient sword to deliver judgments.

His battle abilities soared even greater than before. Just a wave had an apocalyptic might.

The crowd took a deep breath. This heightened form of his was truly strong. Not many ancestors in Nine Secrets could take him on now.

“Boom!” He then jumped into the ancient formation and split into three copies.

There were three of him now inside Immortal Slaying Ancient Formation. They were identical and had the same radiance. The split didn’t make any of them weaker than the original.

“Which one is real?” The spectators were confused to see three of him.

They opened their heavenly gaze and tried to spot the real one. Unfortunately, they were disappointed to find that regardless of how careful they looked, they still couldn’t notice anything.

“It’s impossible to tell.” Even the ancestors shook their head.

“Copies can’t be this strong.” Another murmured.

Cultivators could create avatars and copies after reaching a certain level but they were far inferior to the real body. Some copy didn’t even possess twenty-percent strength of the original.

One ancestor stared seriously at the formation: “The emperor has entered a special state in this formation. Even his copies are just as strong as the original. So now, there are three of him, and they’re all empowered too.”

“This formation is incredible then.” Another took a deep breath.

This meant that the emperor’s power had tripled. This combined with the murderous atmosphere in the formation made him much stronger than normal.

“Don’t be surprised.” An ancestor said: “This formation has an amazing origin. Few in the history of Myriad Formation Kingdom have been able to learn it.”

“Clank!” The three emperors each had one sword. They raised it in front of them in an offensive stance, ready to attack.

The swords exuded a flowing golden brilliance that spread to the emperors. They looked like three golden immortals with a transcending aura - a stark contrast to the murderous aura emanating from the swords.

“Die!” The emperor roared and finally made his move, slashing vertically with his swords.

“Clank!” The entire formation activated with a merciless sharpness, enough to kill an immortal.

The spectators felt a sharp sting on their neck as if they were the ones being decapitated.

“Come!” Li Qiye laughed and casually punched again.

The destructive punch was as unstoppable as before, destroying everything in its path. There was no taking back after releasing. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“Boom!” It aimed straight for the three swords.

The crowd watched with bated breath; this wasn’t the first time the king used his bare hands against weapons.

The result was the swords being blown to the air; the emperor staggered several steps backward.
