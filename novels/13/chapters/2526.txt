Majestic Desert Splendor

Everything became hazy since the mountain range was engulfed by a great sword formation, full of sharp intents.

Just one sword wave emanating from this formation could eradicate the stars, making them dissipate like specks of dust.

A biting aura permeated as if anything inside the sword formation would instantly be rendered into mists of blood. Nothing would be left behind.

“Origin Sword Formation, one of the three great formations. The strongest one of the swords.” An ancestor murmured.

The crowd finally realized why the emperor sent down those swords earlier onto Nine-linked. It was in preparation for this formation.

Everyone held their breath and wondered about a potential miracle. His kingdom was known for their expertise in formation. Now, the emperor and his entire land have prepared this ultimate sword formation.

“Clank!” The emperor stopped before Greate Desolate Mountain; his eyes flashing like lightning and fell upon Bingchi Hanyu who was standing calmly next to the king.

His glance then turned towards Li Qiye and shot out a blinding glint of the sword, akin to the explosion of an entire world. A massive invincible aura erupted.

A meeting between enemies would incite fury. However, the emperor kept his cool and benevolence, not shouting just yet.

“Li Qiye.” He called out Li Qiye by his name with a voice as firm as a rock and as smooth as an unsheathing sword. Each word was filled with aggression.

Everyone held their breath, watching the meeting between the two kings. No one wanted to miss this colorful event.

One could hear the drop of a needle right now. This was actually the second meeting between the two.

The first one was when Eight Formation True Emperor led the six legions to siege the imperial city. At that point, the king was considered to be useless and weak.

The outcome of that event was too obvious. The abandoned king was chased out of his throne.

Eight Formation True Emperor became even more famous after the fact and seemed to be on the verge of replacing the king.

This was no longer the case. The king turned out to be untouchable. Everyone seemed insignificant before him. Even the emperor needed to prepare meticulously before this meeting.

The worst part of all was that his fiancee has fallen into the king’s grasp.

Li Qiye didn’t mind the rude address and put down his teacup. He yawned: “That was a long preparation, how boring.”

The crowd froze in response. The emperor had numerous blessings and looked to be invincible right now yet the king still didn’t give a damn, clearly not taking the emperor serious at all.

This only made the crowd think about his immense power. That’s the only way he could be so relaxed right now.

The emperor had a serious expression. He coldly uttered: “I’m here to take away Princess Hanyu!”

With that, his eyes shot out enough radiance to lacerate the world. He clearly showed his determination with this attitude.

“Commendable courage.” Li Qiye still seemed disinterested and waved his sleeve: “Well, before we even get into whether you’re strong enough to take her away, let’s ask her if she wants to leave with you first.”

The spectating youths felt indignation for the emperor since the king was showing nothing but contempt and disrespect.

The emperor turned towards Hanyu; his eyes became gentler.

“Princess, will you leave with me?” He said in a gentlemanly manner; his action temperament befitted his status as a True Emperor.

She sighed and shook her head: “Young Noble Tianzhi. This is all my fault, so I should be the one to end this. Your future is bright, drop the animosity and leave this place. The vast world is for you to explore.”

Her soft words carried good intentions since she knew full well that no one could take on Li Qiye. Only death awaited his foes. Resistance was futile, so she chose to submit.

This answer heralded confusion; the crowd started to clamor and glanced at each other.

Everyone knew that Princess Hanyu and Eight Formation True Emperor was a match made in heaven - perfect for each other, perfect in the eyes of the spectators.

Moreover, she had toiled to gather followers and build up momentum for him in the past. Yes, it could be said that she had given full effort to help him become the next king.

So, many viewed her as a virtuous wife - beautiful, capable, a qualified queen.

But now, everything has changed so quickly in just one night. She has chosen to follow the king.

This left the crowd speechless. Just what the hell had happened? They started imagining different scenarios. Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

The emperor’s expression shifted as he trembled slightly. Of course, someone at his level could quickly regain his composure.

“Princess, don’t worry, I will save you. I don’t care what had happened since you were captured because of me, I have the responsibility to take you back.” He took a deep breath and said.

Some gave him a thumbs-up in admiration. This was indeed a very manly answer, full of responsibility.

She shook her head again: “Young Noble Tianzhi, you still don’t understand. You are not His Majesty’s match. Opposing His Majesty will only bring ruins, not only to Myriad Formation Kingdom but also to the Bingchi Clan.”

The response this time was as clear as can be, and certainly wasn’t easy on the ears. Nevertheless, she was speaking the truth.

This had escalated beyond personal pride and feud. It could bring about a calamity to their kingdom and clan.

Some didn’t quite understand her choice because in their mind, the emperor took great risks just to come and rescue her.

The emperor took one more breath to calm down and decisively looked away from Bingchi Hanyu.

“Clank!” With a resounding sword hymn, his gaze turned into a terrifying divine sword, wishing to decapitate Li Qiye.

He exuded a terrifying murderous intent, turning into a god of death - killing all who stand before him without any mercy!

“I will have your head today and take away Princess Hanyu even if it’s the last thing I do!” He made a solemn and resolute declaration - representing his unswerving will.

Hanyu gave up trying to persuade him for she knew it was too late. This battle was inevitable now.
