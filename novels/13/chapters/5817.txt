Chapter 5817: No Way

“We cannot hope to speculate the ancestors’ machination.” Devil Bestowment uttered coldly.

“It’s rather simple, they worried about you three becoming stronger after teaching you everything. If you somehow can successfully focus your bloodline, you will obtain the Peacebringer Trinity bloodline.” Li Qiye smiled: “Just as sacred blood can become immortal blood, so can you take the next step. However, the old geezer wants to be the only one with it, no?”

He winked at them and said: “He was so jealous of Divine Ancestor’s Inborn Dao Chaos Physique and wanted to kill him. So if you three obtain the trinity bloodline, he would lose face since he won’t be the only one with it any longer.”

“Nonsense.” They refuted this notion.

“Are you sure? I suppose my assumption can be wrong and unduly. After all, Old Derivation’s intelligence and talent are second to none, but he’s also a madman and somehow doesn’t remember how to cultivate the trinity bloodline, or perhaps Primal just doesn’t know how to upgrade your bloodline despite having it innately. I don’t know, which one is more plausible?” Li Qiye smirked.

The trio glared at him in silence.

“Maybe I’m just overthinking it, it’s not a matter of jealousy or wanting to stay special. The important part is when you three reach the indestructible realm on top of having Death Coffin, wouldn’t that be something? What if you choose to disobey and use it against them? I suppose being cautious is warranted.” Li Qiye continued.

They couldn’t help but exchange glances. This was a plausible explanation of why Primal held back on them, giving them neither the method to improve their bloodlines nor access to Death Coffin.

“You know too much about your ancestors and their origin, that’s why you are loyal and protect their secrets all this time, not to mention your efforts in building Celestial Court. Unfortunately, they still do not trust you and prevent you from becoming stronger lest you bite back one day. After all, there are only a few overlords, and eating some is perfect for nourishment and growing stronger.” Li Qiye said.

Whether Li Qiye was right or not, he touched on all the points that had been troubling the trio. They had thought about these matters for eras now, unable to face it.

As for the others, they also shuddered because they were in the same position. The immortals toiled for the ancestors only to be distrusted. Was it the same for them and the three immortals?

The answer was obvious - the three immortals held back as well, never passing down the method for the ancestral realm such as showing them the origination.

“You guarded their secrets and shielded them from countless storms, allowing them to quietly hide away, carefree and undisturbed. Most importantly, you’ve been cultivating this world diligently to ensure that one day, they can reap the fruits of your labor, such a noble task! They can’t do it themselves because the villainous heaven might strike them to ashes, so the responsibility is entrusted to your group, mere farmers who work so hard for nothing, not even the love of their masters. That’s just not fair now, is it?” He concluded.

While the trio brooded over their circumstances, weaker emperors felt something ominous.

“Is this world just a farm for the overlords?” One of them shuddered and asked. Once the fruits and plants were ready, that would be the time for harvest? Gêtt the latest ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/velbin(.)com

What types of fruits and plants were available? This was another obvious answer.

“No one can escape when that day comes.” Profound said, knowing more than the rest.

“Hmph, you keep on wasting your breath, Dark Crow, the coordinates will never be yours.” One of the three uttered coldly.

“Instead of painting me in a negative light, you should consider this as securing an alternative path after squandering your best years. Think about it, if we sit down and have a good chat about the dao, you might instantly reach the next level considering your fortunes and talent. It’s a win-win situation, not to mention that it is for the betterment of the world, all beings will be grateful to you, the supreme ancestors that have protected them.” Li Qiye said.

Listeners thought that this vision was rather appealing. Li Qiye was definitely an overlord so he could teach them how to break through.

Eventually, they could become overlords themselves since they shared the same pursuit as all the other cultivators - from emperors to ancestors to overlords.
