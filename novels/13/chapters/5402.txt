Chapter 5403: Ancient Battlefield

A path leading toward an ancient battlefield emerged before the group - a common scene of tattered stars, broken mountains, and evaporated oceans.

Massive ships could be seen - no longer in their prime state. Some could carry a continent when they were still operational.

They also saw a skull as large as a planet. The flesh was long gone and many broken pieces floated around it. Holes left behind from a battle could be seen.

Xiao Hu couldn’t believe his eyes since this was his first time seeing an ancient battlefield.

“Sanctuary.” Ferocity said softly.

“This is Sanctuary?” Xiao Hu was surprised to hear this: “I thought it was an unbreakable fortress.”

“The battle between emperors and monarchs took down everything.” Ferocity stared at him.

“So Celestial Court retreated after this battle.” Xiao Hu murmured.

According to the legends, Celestial Court launched an assault on The People during Immemorial Epoch War.

Both sides went all out and trillions died. Numerous legendary cultivators joined the battle and caused untold destruction to the six continents.

This was a period when Celestial Court was unstoppable. The People was forced back repeatedly but Celestial Court eventually stopped for an unknown reason.

Sanctuary in Dream Abyss was the last stand of The People, the final battle of Immemorial Epoch War. Celestial Court had the upper hand and victory seemed imminent. Nonetheless, something happened and caused them to withdraw.

“What is that creature?” Xiao Hu gasped after seeing the pierced skull the size of a planet. Its massive frame alone would cause serious damage to the outside world.

“Might not be from our world.” Ferocity shook his head.

“This ancient battlefield has been around long before that war.” Li Qiye said.

“I can’t even imagine the previous wars.” Li Xian’er took note of a large battleship. Just crafting it must have taken an immeasurable amount of resources. No dao lords or conquerors in the present day could come close. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

Li Qiye smiled and didn’t answer.

The group passed through the battlefield and finally made it to the deepest crevice of Dream Abyss - an expanse with no end in sight, slightly resembling a gigantic eye.

An apex dao lord wouldn’t be able to see through it despite using their heavenly gaze to the limit.

“Immortal Eye, the last area of Dream Paradise.” Xiao Hu gazed into the distance and said quietly.

Rumors regarding an eye looming deep in Dream Paradise existed. Now, Xiao Hu believed these rumors were true.

Nonetheless, there was still a long way to go due to the sheer size of the expanse. Many ruins and continents floated in between. A heavenly waterfall poured downward with no source in sight; its current resembled a mirror or a portal of some sort. Touching it would cause bright ripples before being transferred to another dimension.

Li Qiye eventually stopped in front of a mysterious pathway. The surface was cracked and appeared lifeless, seemingly having endured a tribulation.

On both sides were apricot trees that had met a tragic end. Some only had stumps left while others had charred branches.

The pathway seemed to be leading into a?different dimension but somehow collapsed, leaving behind a remnant shadow of its former self. Or, whoever created it eventually reached the level to no longer need it for traveling.

“Apricot Path.” Li Xian’er commented: “As far as I know, Apricot Dao Lord started here, creating a special momentum to launch a special assault. Unfortunately, as we all know, it ended with defeat.”

“Right here?” Xiao Hu stared at the broken path.

No one knew why Apricot Dao Lord wanted to cross through the expanse and challenge Immortal Paradise. They only heard of total defeat and grievous losses, whether it be weapons or resources. The dao lord no longer appeared afterward.

Some believed that if she were still active, she would have been just as dominant as Puresun Dao Lord.

“A firefly daring to contend against the moon, how courageous.” Li Qiye commented.

The others didn’t dare to respond because Apricot Dao Lord was an apex existence in the upper continents. In fact, Supreme and the others were not her match.
