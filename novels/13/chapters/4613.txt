Chapter 4614: Golden Gate

Golden Gate possessed its own mountain range in Sky’s Demise and a fair bit of land. Despite its relatively recent founding, it was still quite strong and stood out among the sects here.

It didn’t only specialize in the fist dao and had other top merit laws as well. This was because he derived other laws from those found in Golden City. Since he was a genius there, he had access to many of them. He chose the path of derivation instead of passing down the original merit laws out of respect.

Keep in mind that the original ones included arts from ancient emperors, dao lords, and even those from older periods. They served as the basic foundation for the first emperor to start his sect. Moreover, his fist dao was dominating enough.

Flourishing scenes were common sights across the mountain range. The main peak was particularly bright due to the presence of a radiant palace.

This peak was also known as Golden Peak or Fist Peak. It resembled a fist sticking out of the ground - a contrast to the fist swinging downward in Worldbreaker.

The golden palace was made from gold, hence its dazzling reflection to all directions. It made it obvious for visitors to know that they were in the right place.

Rumor has it that when the construction was finished, members from Golden City came to offer their congratulations. Of course, this couldn’t be verified.

Nonetheless, Golden Gate truly displayed the word “golden”. It was the most common theme in the architecture seen here.

Some criticized them for using gold this often, saying that it was ostentatious and inelegant. The sect itself believed that they were simply connected to this character due to their history.

Therefore, gold was used as decorations and building bricks. Not all members of Golden Gate were in love with gold.

On top of the arched gate was a plaque with the characters “Golden Gate”. The calligraphy was both expertly and powerful. Each stroke made people imagine a punch. L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Quite grand.” Jian Ming couldn’t help but comment.

“I heard that Golden God Fist made this plaque.” Paramount Scion said.

Though he didn’t let the emperor join his sect, he still gave his descendant a present during the latter’s sect foundation. At the very least, they seemed to still have a relationship.

The gate was naturally packed. This wasn’t due to a celebration or anything but due to the influx of suitors from the mighty sects and ancient clans.

The majority was here to find more information about the emperor or the treasure. All in all, Golden Gate would appear to be flourishing due to all the guests.

In reality, the members of the sect - especially the experts and ancestors - were awfully nervous. They knew that malice existed beneath the friendly guise.

Once this thin veil was lifted and for the sake of the treasure, these great powers could go as far as massacring all of them and excavating every inch of their home.

This meant that all of these suitors were potential enemies who could unsheathe their blade at any moment. Danger existed everywhere for Golden Gate right now, hence the permeating fear.

Whispers and conversations ignited the moment people saw Ye Tingrong and Li Qiye’s group. Remember, Ye Tingrong was the chosen bride this time.

Golden Gate and its members haven’t revealed their stance yet on this issue. Therefore, it seemed strange for her to be in public with another group.

“Who are they?” A member of a big sect asked.

“It’s Li Qiye, he’s a big shot.” Another whispered.

“A big shot? What is his background?” Many youths didn’t know who he was.

“A very famous genius who is on the rise.” Someone from Southern Desolace said: “I believe he is deeply related to Lion’s Roar and even killed Five-sun King’s father at Dragon Sect.”

“He killed Five-sun King’s father?!” The crowd couldn’t believe it.

One of them gasped and said: “Is he tired of living? There is no way Five-sun King would ever let this go.”

“He has Lion’s Roar as the backer. Even the priestess of Ancestral Divine Temple publicly supported him.” Someone who was present at Yin Yang Crossing said.

“Damn…” Everyone was shocked to hear this.

Lion’s Roar was a behemoth while Ancestral Divine Temple was a feared existence as well. Having them as backers meant that he could threaten all of Eight Desolaces.

“Seems like he can challenge the geniuses of True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao then.” Another brought this up.

“You’re right.” The one from the Yin Yang event nodded: “This is indeed the case, he killed Six-winged Emissary who is the disciple of True Immortal Sect Master several days ago at Yin Yang Crossing. Since the priestess from Ancestral Divine Temple had his back, True Immortal Sect Master couldn’t do anything about it.”

“That’s unbelievable.” One youth took a deep breath.”

“Is he here for the marriage proposal too?” A clan member asked.

“Maybe Golden Gate agreed already.” A spectator who saw Li Qiye together with Ye Tingrong suggested.

It was understandable for those nearby to guess Li Qiye’s goal, considering that Ye Tingrong was with him. They went as far as thinking that they had agreed to it.

“Is this really happening?” This possibility became the main topic near the entrance.

“There will be strong opposition.” A young expert snorted.

“Right, what about the other powers? Especially True Immortal and Three Thousand Dao. They won’t accept a refusal so easily.” Another from an old sect nodded in agreement.

Everyone understood that Golden Gate was riding a tiger and getting down was difficult. Accepting one meant humiliating the others.

“True, they won’t let it end so easily.” They were also aware of the behemoths’ true intention - the treasure.

“Don’t forget, Li Qiye has Dragon’s Roar and Ancestral Divine Temple. He’s close with Dragon too.” A big shot said.
