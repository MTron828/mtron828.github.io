Chapter 4190: Sword Ocean

More sword boats emerged at the border and Li Qiye’s group jumped on one, letting it take them towards the ocean.

No one tried to stop them because Li Qiye was known as a monster by this point. Moreover, the two women accompanying him were capable as well.

Plus, those who were qualified to even think about it would have a much easier time taking the other boats. There was no need to mess with Li Qiye.

At the start, the riders were nervous about traveling through the dangerous cauldron. Anything unexpected could result in a terrible death.

Strangely enough, nothing ever happened to those on the sword boats. The dangers viewed them as non-existent.

After a while on the road, they finally heaved a sigh of relief, realizing how safe it was.

“Splash!” Once they made it far into the cauldron, they heard splashing waves and saw something astonishing.

The ocean water was going from low to high towards the sky, looking like thousands of galloping horses. This was an unprecedented sight for them. It came without warning or a source too. The waves just started rising for no discernible reason.

“So weird.” Many were slack-jawed at this sight.

Massive oceans up in the sky weren’t uncommon in their world. However, there were still patterns and orders adhering to common sense. This wasn’t the case here.

The waves eventually took them to Sword Ocean that was waiting above. The sword boats became one with the water here and disappeared from sight after granting them safe passage.

The visitors then realize why everyone wanted to drop everything and come to the second grave.

While standing at the naturally-formed sea wall, they saw an ocean with no end in sight. The breezes were quite comfortable and made them forget about the dangers here.

Sword Cauldron earlier was a hell on earth. On the other hand, this seemed like a paradise.

There were no divine swords in sight, unlike the previous domains. Of course, it wasn’t empty either. There were islands and large battleships; alas, they were smashed and broken.

This ocean was quite deep yet one sunken ship still had half of its hull showing on the surface. It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that it was a kingdom all by itself.

It has been ravaged by time after suffering untold devastation from a great battle. Some of its peers had snapped in half, others were pierced through or slashed down…Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This was clearly an expedition fleet that came with a purpose. Who knows if they had fulfilled their goal?

The islands nearby didn’t fare any better and had a similar fate to the ships. People started wondering about the two sides.

The fleet possessed an unimaginable power. Using the character “behemoth” to describe a sect of this level was insufficient.

“What is this place?” A spectator asked: “Was there a kingdom in the sky with inhabitants?”

This might be the case once since the area didn’t look like a land of death. Maybe a terrible war eventually took this kingdom down.

“It could just be a battlefield from the olden age.” A last-gen expert speculated: “Maybe dao lords or even ancient emperors led an expedition here. From the look of it, the entire fleet went down.”

“Either way, the battle here must have been devastating and tore everything asunder.” An ancestor commented.

“We need to get going! We’re already late since the big sects have entered this ocean long ago. They might already have the immortal sword.” A high elder realized something and stopped looking around.

He then summoned a shuttle and brought his disciples into the ocean.

“He’s right, we can’t linger around.” The others did the same using various flying treasures. The more powerful cultivators flew themselves.

On the other hand, Li Qiye was in no hurry. While strolling on the water, he closed his eyes, took a deep breath, and enjoyed the sea breezes.

A while later, he scooped up a handful of water then let it seep through his fingers. He smiled and said: “Right here.”

“You two, go take a look around, maybe you’ll find something good.” He then wiped his hands and told his companions.

“And you, Young Noble?” Snowcloud Princess asked.

“I have somewhere to go.” He gazed towards the distance.

The two didn’t pry and started riding the waves away.
