Chapter 4145: Choice

Translator: ImmortalEmperorBao

Ning Zhu refused Abyss Scion’s invitation back to Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom. Though she maintained a polite tone, she couldn’t be clearer with her message.

The scion’s expression soured as a result.

“Your Highness, please return.” An old man behind him calmly spoke. He seemed to have ample authority, clearly an elder from there. An elder from Sea Emperor was different from an elder anywhere else. After all, it was the number one sect in Sword Continent.

“I appreciate it, Elder Zhan, but I must keep my words. Please forgive me.” She tactfully refused, once again surprising the crowd.

First was the scion, now an elder from there. This was a great chance for her.

In their eyes, being Li Qiye’s maid was insulting for someone of her status. Thus, the fact that Sea Emperor was willing to take her back was quite generous.

Anyone with a bit of sense would know what to do in this situation. In fact, a more vicious type would actually turn this around and push Li Qiye towards his demise. This would wash them clean from this mess.

Strangely enough, Ning Zhu preferred to be Li Qiye’s maid instead of a queen. People found this inconceivable and foolish in spite of Li Qiye’s wealth. He only became rich recently and new money never lasted long.

On the contrary, Sea Emperor had an impeccable foundation due to having five dao emperors in the past.

“What is wrong with her?” One youth murmured: “Being a queen is ten thousand times better than being a maid.” L𝒂aTest nov𝒆ls on (n)𝒐velbi/𝒏(.)co𝒎

“Yes, she needs to pick a strong backer now that Pineleaf Sword Lord is dead.” One elder didn’t understand her.

In the past, she used to be the successor of Wooden Sword and enjoyed the love of the sword lord. Now, it would make more sense for her to side with Sea Emperor; this would be far better for her future.

In reality, she disagreed with these viewpoints. When the sword lord was alive, he helped her nullify this marriage. His death was quite a blow to their branch so the advantage belonged to the opposing side now.

The marriage would be brought up again. This might be the reason why Abyss Scion came to bring her back.

In Wooden Sword, nothing would be able to stop this marriage now since she had lost her strongest supporter.

The scion was left in a tough position. They came expecting the sword lord to lose. Thus, their mission was to bring the princess back to Sea Emperor. Unfortunately, she was stubborn and refused their invitation.

“Your Highness, please reconsider.” He took a deep breath and solemnly said: “This choice affects your future and legacy…”

“Enough of this nonsense.” Li Qiye interrupted him and said: “I make decisions for my people. If she wishes to stay, then your sect needs to scram. Stop bothering us.”

This was both a slap to the scion’s face and another insult towards Sea Emperor. Li Qiye had taken their queen and still maintained an arrogant tone. Even an ordinary sect wouldn’t be able to swallow this anger, let alone Sea Emperor. Showing restraint here was akin to showing weakness.

“Is he always like this?” One spectator asked.

“Yes, always so overbearing and aggression prone.” Someone else smiled wryly, having been used to Li Qiye’s personality.

Those who knew Li Qiye were aware that he had no problem offending anyone in Sword Continent. Moreover, he was still living just fine - a testament to his ability.

The scion’s expression darkened and his tone became colder: “Li, we’ve been lenient on past grievances so you should know how to act today…”

He spoke confidently because he could back it up, given his personal power and being the representative of Sea Emperor.

“Of course I know what to do, and that’s not to bother with annoyances like you.” Li Qiye waved his hand without looking at the guy.

The old men behind the scion glowered after hearing this, unable to handle the blatant disrespect from this newly-rich youth.

“So you rather do this the hard way.” The scion’s eyes flashed murderously.

This naturally excited the crowd since there could be a fun show for them.

“Sea Emperor wants a fight.” One cultivator murmured.

“Or maybe there is just a good justification. It’s not only about the feud, who doesn’t want Li Qiye’s wealth?” Another ancestor speculated.

Others agreed with him. As the number one sect, Sea Emperor would face criticism if they were to rob Li Qiye. Now, with Ning Zhu’s issue as a reason, they had the right to maneuver against him. This was killing two birds with one stone.

“Bring it.” Li Qiye laughed in response.

“Rumble!” Suddenly, drums could be heard all over the lake.

“What’s going on?” This frightened the crowd because it came from various islands.

“The eighteen islands of Cloud Dream Lake.” One member became afraid.

“March!” A thunderous command could be heard.

“March!” The other islands answered back.

Numerous legions began flying out of the islands. The first voice spoke again: “We’re taking back Dark Dragon Island. Those who offend us shall die!”

“Eight-hundred Li Court, the second island of Lake Dream and the strongest bandit group.” Someone recognized the first group.
