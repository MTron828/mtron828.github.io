The sect began recalling the disciples venturing outside. This mobilization naturally attracted the attention of the sects and kingdoms nearby.

They thought that something was going on and started to speculate. It didn’t take long before something happened. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“Boom!” A portal emerged right outside of Divine Black. It opened and exuded bright radiance along with majestic power.

“Rumble!” One battalion came out after another from within the gate.

Each member had plenty of vitality and true energy. They wore a three-colored daoist robe along with a protective mirror in front of their chest.

This looked like the painting depicting the arrival of daoist masters against evil forces.

“Three Truths!” The sentries of Divine Black saw this and immediately blew their warning whistles.

The warnings rang across the entire sect from one group to another.

“We’re under attack! We’re under attack!” The disciples immediately went to their post.

“Boom!” The power of a dao lord emerged all around the sect in the form of a grand formation. Barriers spread outward, looking like crystal walls.

“Screech!” A bird flew out of Jade Bird Peak. It spread its wings and covered the entire peak before pouring down green particles filled with life force.

“Raa!” Meanwhile, a white tiger appeared in Furious Tiger. Its ferocious aura resembled a tsunami, enough to make people tremble.

A divine tree grew from the top of Thousand Demons Peak, turning the sect into an ocean of life. It could empower all the disciples and give them boundless vitality and strength.

A great gate came out of Eight Zhang Peak, capable of sealing the world. This impregnable gate served as a shield; nothing could ever get through regardless of its power.

In the next moment, a sword light rushed out of South Conch Peak. “Clank!” It could tear chaos out of the fabric of realities, severing the darkness and heralding the yin and yang.

The sect immediately entered their highest state of alert. These defensive lines prevented any enemy from getting through.

This required a tremendous amount of resources because it was a grand formation of the dao lord level. Nonetheless, they didn’t mind at all.

This was a mean reserved for a mighty foe and Three Truths qualified as one. They needed to prepare for the worst and went all out at the start.

“What’s happening?!” Its neighbors noticed the commotion. Many sent out scouts and experts.

“Three Truths opened a portal right outside Divine Black.” The answer shocked many of them.

Moreover, Divine Black had fully activated its defensive barriers as well.

“The sparks of war, these two sects will start fighting again.” One expert mused.

The truce between them was a big deal in the northern West King. This resulted in peace for the last few decades.

Now, this mobilization from Three Truths naturally startled the other powers.

However, a few were actually happy. Heavy losses would come from this. Maybe one of the two would start declining.

This would be a heaven-sent opportunity for the smaller sects. Greater possibilities awaited them in that case.

“I hope it’s not a long one.” Others were worried.

No eggs stay unbroken in an all-out confrontation. The older sects were worried because, in the worst-case scenario, both sects would utilize all of their resources.

Their neighbors would also need to pick a side and be involved in this conflict. Otherwise, they would be the first to be destroyed. Unfortunately, since this happened without any warning, they weren’t prepared at all.

“It’s a large-scale invasion.” Anxiety struck them as more experts poured out of the portal on one hand. On the other, the ones from Divine Black seemed ready to fight to the death.

Even back during the previous conflicts, there were only minor skirmishes taken place across the years.

Now, Three Truths seemed to be fully mobilizing right outside of Divine Black itself.

Doing so had pros and cons. The first one was obvious, Three Truths could send their entire forces here. However, if they were to lose, Divine Black could instantly retaliate and take the fight to them.

They couldn’t destroy the portal to prevent this either because that would cut off their own retreat path. Losing meant being surrounded with nowhere to run.

“Why is Three Truths attacking Divine Black in full force now?” This question popped up.

Normally, the powers would start massing at the borders first while consolidating their defenses. They would also recruit their weaker neighbors and tributaries. Why? They didn’t want to be backstabbed during the conflict.

But today, Three Truths didn’t get anyone else involved. This justifiably confused the crowd.

Of course, Ping Suoweng and the others knew exactly why they came alone. Three Truths wanted the ancestral peak for themselves.

Successfully carrying this out meant that they alone would have access to the Immortal Emperor’s treasury. From then on, it would have the chance to become the strongest sect in the northern West King.

“Rumble!” More armies from Three Truths continued to arrive. It didn’t take long before Divine Black was completely surrounded.

Many inside Divine Black became anxious. They knew that a brutal battle was coming.

“Should we let the young master know?” Someone asked Ping Suoweng.

“No need for that, the young master already knows.” Suoweng gazed at the army and said.

“I mean, should we ask the young master on what to do?” The person quietly said.

Some in Divine Black relied on Li Qiye because victory was assured with his help.

“He’s a dragon from above, we can’t predict what he’ll do. He has his own plans.” Suoweng shook his head.
