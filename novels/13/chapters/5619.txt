Chapter 5620: The Giant Hand Cradling Countless Stars

“I remember that your old man didn’t give you permission either.” Li Qiye smiled.

The woman snorted and said nothing. Everything that happened back then was just for show. Everyone was in the dark except Li Qiye and her father.

“Did she know?” She asked.

“Who knows? Everyone has a different perspective but given your intelligence, shouldn’t you have noticed that something was off?” He answered with a smile.

“Are you calling me stupid?” She glared at him.

“Of course not, how can I dare call someone who became a Grand Emperor at such a young age stupid? No way, a supreme beauty and a Grand Emperor, stupid?” He shrugged in response.

Her gaze was enough to kill him a thousand times over because she noticed nothing back then.

“Rest well when it’s all over.” In the end, he helped tidy up her misty hair and said: “This has been an agonizing tribulation for you, separation is tough.”

She scowled and didn’t retort.

He raised his shield and smiled: “This is not bad, take it.”

“Do you think this kind of favor can buy me?” Her gaze could turn him into an ice sculpture.

“Well, what can I do, it’s just the way it is, whether you accept it or not. Your will alone determines our relationship.” He shrugged in response: “There’s no point in wanting to kill me though, your answer will come in due time.”

She glared at him one last time before standing up and leaving.

“This isn’t over!” She rode the waves and disappeared into the horizon.

“It’s so hard to deal with women these days.” He chuckled after the ordeal.

He then tossed the jellyfish up in the air. It traveled a massive distance in an arc before falling into the hands of the middle-aged man.

“Make good use of it, it will complement your sword rather effectively.” Li Qiye’s voice popped up in his mind.

The man understood the value of this jellyfish. He prostrated in Li Qiye’s direction and bowed several times: “Thank you for the gift, Your Excellency.”

“A just reward.” Li Qiye sighed before gazing at an imperial star with a floating city.

“Boom!” Thousand Emperor Island seemed to be sinking into the ocean due to a supreme force pressing down on them.

“Who is it?!” Everyone became alarmed including emperors and gods.

Imperial laws and barriers immediately manifested into reality, turning the region into an impregnable fortress.

“Rumble!” As endless rays surged into the sky, the visual phenomena or gateways started closing.

“We’re under attack!” Cultivators, whether it be regular disciples or ancestors and emperors, were startled.Ne/w novel chapt𝒆rs are published on no/vel(/bin(.)co/m

Since this region represented Imperial Field, an invasion was an official declaration of war against Imperial Field.

This meant that only Celestial Court had the power to do so. Strangely enough, they would have sent an army for a direct attack instead of a sudden ambush like this.

“Boom!” The powers and momentums of the island came together to form a palm capable of lifting the sky and cradling myriad stars.

This was enough to stop the stomp from the unknown attacker. Nonetheless, the region still shook violently. 

Everyone became frozen and felt the weight of innumerable mountains crashing down on them. Emperors and monarchs had a tough time resisting the power of pure weight. This was akin to being under all six continents.

Some managed to look up and saw a woman floating in the air. She wore a simple silk dress without any radiance or adornments. She had no makeup yet still displayed a captivating appearance.

Her beauty didn’t belong to a living person, only to a flawless work of art. Her graceful facial features, elegant curves, and overall demeanor seemed to be meticulously crafted - giving her the appearance of a sculpture.

The features and lines were strong yet there was still a feminine touch - a strange duality of both power and grace. For example, her slender waist lacked the expected warmth and softness of a beauty, exuding a substantial feeling of immensity instead.

The contradictory duality blended seamlessly in her, looking out of place yet harmonious at the same time.

She was made of flesh and blood to perfection yet when people looked at her, they felt that she was an immensely heavy statue. In other words, just one stomp from her could reduce an emperor to a mist of blood.

Therefore, she did not need divinity and aura. Her weight alone instilled fear into spectators.

Someone as slender and graceful as her, by all accounts, should be easily lifted by anyone. Of course, seeing her in person would dispel this notion. 

Despite having activated barriers in the form of a mighty palm, Thousand Emperor Island creaked and groaned under her immense weight. It resembled a decaying wooden frame, on the verge of collapsing at any moment.

“Titanic Conqueror!” Some shouted her title.

“Titanic Conqueror!” Those who had not seen the woman before had heard of her title.

She was a descendant of Crimson Emperor and a member of the imperial clan. She stood shoulder to shoulder with Light-dragon, Heaven Burial, and Monolith Conqueror. Some even said that she could rival her ancestor at this point. 

Thus, her appearance made everyone beneath feel something ominous.

“Boom!” She took another step and cracks appeared on the energy palm. Despite being capable of uplifting the heaven, it couldn’t withstand her weight.
