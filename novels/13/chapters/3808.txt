Chapter 3809: The Winner

All eyes were on Dugu Lan and Righteous Scion.

“Let’s begin, please give me pointers.” Dugu Lan wielded her sword and spoke with composure.

The scion’s eyes became resplendent. The rays from there swept forward like divine swords, causing people to shudder uncontrollably. He was powerful enough to intimidate members of the previous generation.

“My grand dao is the way of the spear. I hope it won’t let you down.” The scion said.

“I have heard of it before. Make your move.” Dugu Lan nodded.

“Good. Well then, ready your sword, Fairy.” The scion didn’t waste time and channeled his power.

However, Dugu Lan still embraced her sword in her bosom without activating her vitality and energy - truly a gorgeous spectacle.

Others couldn’t help but become swooned by her wondrous appearance and courageous style, unable to forget for the rest of their life.

“My sword is ready.” She said despite still holding the sword in the same defenseless manner.

The spectators were confused. The stronger cultivators regained their wits first and realized something while noticing her aura.

The weaker ones weren’t at the right level and couldn’t see anything, akin to a monk trying to find some hair on top of his head. In their eyes, she seemed to be giving up already.

As for the big shots, they considered her to be the sword right now so the actual stance didn’t matter. As a sword, she was without a scabbard. That’s why there was no need to unsheath.

She stood there as part of the sword dao. As long as she was around, so would the way of the sword. Thus, she has already made her move despite being passive and stationary.

The weaker cultivators thought that she was trying to be mysterious since they didn’t understand this dao phenomenon.

This was not her intention. Her goal was to defeat his technique by using none.

The problem for them was - how would she attack without a basic technique. There was no murderous intent nor battle spirit.

Strangely enough, her attack was invisible and has started inside the scion. A sword seemed to be growing inside his heart right now - a feeling impossible to describe adequately.

The scion retaliated right away. There seemed to be numerous suns exploding in his eyes. A terrible power immediately assaulted the actual world, sending numerous spectators flying.

The rest took a deep breath and hurriedly retreated, aware that this fight would be destructive.

“So strong.” Those who felt his rampaging power again still felt the same dread.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” The lights from his eyes transformed to dao laws in the shape of golden spears.

These materializations of energy contained immense murderous potential, capable of piercing through anything. Their glint instilled fear into the spectators.

His eyes turned into an eternal and endless source of golden spears, culminating into an ocean of weapons. Thousands and thousands of spears were ready to fly forward at any moment.

Though the spears weren’t aimed at them, numerous spectators screamed since they felt as if they were being stabbed all over their body. These spears seemed eager for crucifixion.

This was only the activation of his power. Once he released it, the destructive potential would be far worse. Thus, the crowd smartly retreated another time.

The spears began to rotate in an intimidating manner. Nonetheless, Dugu Lan stood still in a calm manner.

As his power grew stronger, she seemed to become more and more distant from the actual battlefield.

She wasn’t the only one flowing through time. The area around her seemed to be affected as well.

Not all could sense the temporal changes taking place. Even the older experts had a hard time noticing.

Dugu Lan and her sword have traveled a million years away, changing the momentum of heaven and earth.

Meanwhile, Righteous Scion’s golden spears tore apart time itself, aiming to make up this gap.

The fight has already started, unbeknown to the weaker spectators. They still thought that the scion was building up his move and power for an ultimate release. As for the fairy, she was brave enough to give him time.

As for the powerful ancestors, they watched this temporal contest with a solemn expression. One side was pursuing while the other side chose to evade.

They thought that once the scion caught up, Dugu Lan wouldn’t be able to stop the golden ocean.

Suddenly, the golden spears dissipated along with the rays coming out of his eyes. His power was nowhere to be found.

The spectators exchanged glances, bewildered at the lack of action.

“I’ve lost.” Righteous Scion shook his head, seemingly disappointed.

“What?!” A clamor erupted among the crowd. Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m

“Is this happening? First Sister won?” Even students from Duality found this astonishing.
