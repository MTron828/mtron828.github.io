Chapter 5037: Missing People

Being in this macabre region was nerve-wracking. The youths imagined how it was once full of life and shiny stars.

There must have been generations of capable geniuses and countless legends… Most importantly, it had protectors and guardians - supreme existences towering above all else.

Over the years, living beings with knowledge of them had nothing but respect and gratitude, considering them as saviors.

Perhaps they thought that as long as these protectors were around, prosperity would remain for ages to come. There was no need to fear foreign invasion and calamity.

None of them expected to go down due to their revered guardians. These beings could randomly devour their subjects and world, treating everything as delicious meals. This depicted the event that happened in this world - their so-called savior turning the blade toward them.

“World saviors do not exist, remember this.” Li Qiye woke the youths from their stupor.

Ming Shi and the others never heard of something like this before. Today, they actually saw the demise of a world greater than theirs. This made them think about their sects’ ancestors and whether these beings would ever try to devour their descendants.

They immediately stopped thinking about this or it would sow a permanent seed of distrust in their mind.

“There are some corpses here.” Goldcrest looked around and saw a dao platform on a cliff nearby.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Ming Shi and Yunyun immediately rushed in that direction. Sure enough, there were corpses of clearly powerful and influential characters.

“This person must have been from Deity.” Goldcrest focused on an old man. Although the skin was dried and withered, his handsome features could still be seen. The robe’s patterns and symbols were from Deity.

“Yes, look at the badge by his waist.” Yunyun had a good understanding of the twelve lineages: “Godvisage King, a top dragon lord.”

Goldcrest went to another corpse and recognized him. He took a deep breath and said: “Nightborn Heavenly Demon, one of the strongest monarchs.”

Goldcrest was sure of this due to a black jewel on the corpse’s forehead. It seemed to be there at birth.

Another one shocked Yunyun, causing her to comment: “This is… Void Saint Child’s illusory physique.”

The corpse still gave an ethereal and intangible impression as if it was incorporeal.

“We’ve seen this person before!” Ming Shi shouted.

Yunyun and Goldcrest came over. The latter gasped and said: “Sword Lord!”

“Yes, that’s right.” Yunyun saw that the divine sword nearby no longer had any light left.

“The guardian of our academy…” Ming Shi murmured.

They had only seen his portrait before. Now, they finally got to meet the prestigious guardian, albeit under the worst circumstance.

Yunyun had a terrible feeling about this and started looking through the corpses. Eventually, she saw one by the corner and immediately fell to the ground, staring at it in a daze.

The other two came over and saw the corpse of an old woman. She must have been gorgeous and full of nobility when she was alive.

“Divine Empress Dowager.” Ming Shi knew who it was right away despite not knowing her appearance prior.

“Right.” Yunyun said softly.

This concluded those on the missing list. They have met their demise here. Now, the question became - why were they here? Who killed them?

Ming Shi regained her wits and boldly speculated: “Don’t tell me, that supreme overlord devoured this world and then conspired to absorb these cultivators too?”

“You have quite an imagination.” Li Qiye shook his head: “These cultivators might be powerful to you but for someone capable of devouring a world, they are no different from insects, not enough to be an appetizer.”

“Oh.” Ming Shi said: “Who killed them then?”

“Why are they all here as well?” Goldcrest hurriedly added.

“I don’t know how to answer the second question but as for the first, someone purposely led them here in order to devour them.” Li Qiye chuckled and said: “This is a copycat that had either inherit or come across a mighty legacy. The method to become stronger is via consumption.”

“Why this method? It’s disgusting.” She said.

“Do you eat alchemy pills? It has a similar effect for this user, either gaining power or lifespan.” Li Qiye said.

“I got it.” She had nothing but disdain for the culprit.

A while ago, though they found the dead world to be horrible, they were still disconnected. They had nothing to do with any living being here.

Now, they saw victims from their own world - legendary and respected figures. They grew up worshipping these cultivators.

Imagining the main characters from the tales being imprisoned and eaten like pills made them feel sick.
