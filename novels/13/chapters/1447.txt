“Buzz!” When all of these heavenly reflections shone on Li Qiye, they suddenly fused together until only one was left.

A black hole emerged from this mirror-like innate gift. A hand as black as ink came out from within this black hole. Its darkness could even absorb all the nearby light sources as if nothing could escape its grasp.

“Boom!” The black hand directly came crashing towards Li Qiye. It was direct and overbearing without any technique or variation, it was just raw suppression.

All the cultivators in the citadel trembled as this hand came pressing down. They felt that it was coming from the deepest part of the Divine Tree Ridge. This power neither belonged to cultivators nor the grand dao and definitely not the abyss.

It seemed that this force belonged to the ridge itself. It was completely unfathomable and capable of suppressing the world and deities. It looked like the abyss had control of many mysteries unbeknown to others. This was why they could stand strong at Godhalt for so long.

“Burying healthy babies in the depths to incubate them? In the end, they are only monsters.” Li Qiye simply smiled when facing this incoming suppression.

He didn’t waste any actions and crushed the void with his palm. A series of clanking noises resounded as if a dao chapter had been unlocked in a natural manner. In the blink of an eye, his palm was holding all the power in the world; it was as if the grand vein of the ridge was under his control.

“Bang!” The black hand that was pushing down on him suddenly disintegrated after he made his move. The suppressive power vanished instantly.

“Whoosh! Whoosh!” The dark rays from the reflections that engulfed Li Qiye rushed towards the single mirror.

“Ahh!” A series of screams resounded along with the noises of something breaking. The reflections of the dark enforcers collapsed while their bodies emitted buzzing sounds. In the blink of an eye, they turned into dried corpses as if something had robbed them of their strength, blood, and life.

Everyone felt their hair standing on end after seeing the enforcers fall. No one knew what Li Qiye did.

“Trying to suppress me by borrowing the ridge’s power despite having such a shallow understanding...” Li Qiye smiled: “Your abyss only touched the surface of the mysteries at Godhalt. How hilarious, you actually wanted to use this power against me. Fine, this power belongs to the ridge, so I shall return it to the ridge. You think that burying babies in the ground and letting the ridge’s power incubate them is equivalent to controlling the ridge’s power? If it was this easy, the ridge wouldn’t be one of the twelve burial grounds.”

To the beastmaster’s chagrin, Li Qiye stared at him with disdain.

The Dark Enforcement Squad had always been frightening, the nemesis of all outsiders. Anyone who dared to oppose the abyss would be suppressed by these enforcers to the lowest cultivation level. At that point, they would be completely helpless against the abyss. However, their triumphant squad appeared incredibly fragile before Li Qiye.

“Li Qiye grasped some of the ridge’s mysteries.” A great character who knew the origin of the enforcers felt a chill and exhaled a cold breath.

These enforcers were buried in the depths of the abyss when they were babies. Rumor has it that this place could reach the earth veins of the ridge. They used the earth veins to incubate these disciples so that their bodies would be filled with the ridge’s power.

Because of this, this squad was able to suppress outsiders by borrowing the ridge’s power. Unfortunately, they met Li Qiye. He had a much better grasp on the mysteries here compared to the Spirit Abyss.

Li Qiye dispersed all of this power early. Once this happened, everything the disciples had was instantly sucked out and returned to the earth veins. This was why they turned into dried corpses.

The beastmaster furiously howled: “Li Qiye! Don’t even think about leaving Godhalt!”

His heart was bleeding; it wasn’t easy for their sect to train a group of dark enforcers. A group required several decades or even centuries of grooming. But now, all of them were killed by Li Qiye. This was quite a blow to the abyss.

“I have heard these words already.” Li Qiye waved his arm and said: “You should be thinking about whether or not you can leave here alive.”

The beastmaster screamed: “Even if we are down to the last man, we will still take your head!”

Li Qiye didn’t really mind the raging opponent: “I should decapitate you on account of these words alone. However, your head is already spoken for.”

Dragonscale, sitting next to the beastmaster, couldn’t watch any longer. He stood up and coldly uttered: “You are being too presumptuous. With me here, you are not allowed to do as you please.”

He came this time in order to cooperate with the abyss. Moreover, their Ancestral Terra also thought about delivering Li Qiye’s retribution, so how could he let go of this good opportunity?

“Come, come. Since you want to die so badly, I’ll help.” Li Qiye smiled and gestured towards Dragonscale: “This is good, beat the young and the old will come out. I still want to absorb that Dragon Bamboo completely.”

“You are mad!” Dragonscale couldn’t handle these disdainful words towards his master. He took one step forward and, with a loud blast, he instantly took root and revealed his true form.

At this moment, a gigantic green bamboo appeared before everyone. Its body pierced the clouds while each leaf could blot out the sky. There was actually a half-dragon entrenched on this large tree. It was thick and spanned thousands of miles just like a mountain range that was connected to the tree itself.

It huffed and puffed thunderously while exuding a terrifying aura that raged across the area. Its draconic affinity carried a deterring force that caused many cultivators to retreat from the battlefield.

This was the true form of the Dragonscale Bamboo, the combination of a half-dragon and bamboo. In fact, the tree was its real body. The dragon was there because of its dragon bloodline. Even though this blood was quite thin, it was still powerful enough to turn into a half-dragon with scales.

“You’re far below Meng Zhentian, I only need two or three fists to destroy you.” Dragonscale might look strong, but Li Qiye only gave him a dismissive glance.

Dragonscale didn’t like this disdainful look from Li Qiye, so he trembled with rage. He was, more or less, a great awe-inspiring character at Heaven Spirit, but Li Qiye made it sound as if he was only an ant.

“Senior, I will help you. We’ll kill him together.” The beastmaster declared and opened his heavenly reflection.

With a deafening explosion, a phoenix appeared from the beastmaster’s mirror. Its aura swept through the sky as it danced. One can imagine how powerful a phoenix was; its might made many people feel dreadful.

With the beast’s emergence, a cold glint appeared and moved at an imperceptible speed that surpassed time itself. It aimed straight for the beastmaster’s throat.

“Screech!” At this moment of life and death, the phoenix from the mirror cried out and instantly clawed at the glint at an unbelievable speed. However, this sword attack carried an unstoppable bloodthirst that could pierce any foe’s body. 𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“Clank!” When the phoenix seized the sword, a hymn echoed across the world and the bloodthirst erupted like a flood breaking a dam.

The sword continued to soar forward even with the claws holding onto it. The friction sent sparks flying. This unstoppable sword left no room for escape. The beastmaster’s throat was instantly pierced.
