Chapter 4603: Solution

Ye Tingrong looked dejected after hearing this. The scion also sighed sentimentally.

The latter was honest but far from a fool. His intelligence matched his cultivation talent. In reality, he already thought of the possibilities and knew about Li Qiye’s suggested scenario.

Tingrong had also thought about this but she remained hopeful regarding her ancestor’s situation. After all, he was one of the strongest masters in the contemporary and should be able to handle most situations even if the behemoths were involved. FOlloow 𝒏ewest stories at n𝒐(v)el/bi/n(.)com

Now, evidence pointed against this since he was gone and incommunicative. This made it rather ominous but at least the situation hasn’t deteriorated to the worst possible outcome since the great powers were still giving them face.

Nonetheless, she felt worse after listening to him because it could drop to this level at any moment. All of these sects only wanted the peerless item, not a marriage alliance.

They would not easily give up regardless of her ancestor’s whereabouts so now, her entire sect became hostages.

One way for her sect to get through this was to accept an alliance from one of the behemoths, hoping to gain its protection to push others back. Otherwise, they might start threatening her ancestor using the lives of his descendants.

All in all, these marriage proposals were nothing but shams. They only coveted the peerless item but didn’t want to rob Golden Gate in a blatant manner.

Unfortunately, she was powerless to do anything. How could she stop Three Thousand Dao or True Immortal?

“What is your sect going to do if Golden Fist Emperor doesn’t show up? Are you going to attack?” Jian Ming didn’t hold back.

“That is not my intention at all.” The scion’s expression soured as he responded: “Remember, I am just a pawn as well. If I can make my own choice, I would not be here right now.”

He then turned towards Ye Tingrong and sincerely said: “Miss Ye, even if I run away, it doesn’t change anything. Just know that I bear no malice toward your sect.”

“It’s not your fault.” She understood.

Though he was the successor of Paramount Gate, his influence was not enough to change the direction of the sect. Above him were ancestors so even if he didn’t wish to scheme against Golden Gate, he must still follow their plan.

“A marriage alliance is inevitable. What will be your sect’s choice?” Jian Ming asked curiously.

Tingrong opened her mouth but swallowed her words instead of answering.

“It’s either Three Thousand Dao or True Immortal unless the other behemoths come too.” The daoist said: “Hmm, maybe Divine Dragon Valley isn’t enough to force those two to back off, it has to be Lion’s Roar.”

“True.” Paramount Scion agreed with this assessment.

Divine Dragon Valley was the weakest of the four. There existed a certain gap between it and the others. Only Lion’s Roar had a chance due to the prestige of the Supreme Monarch.

“Aren’t you on Three Thousand Dao’s side?” Jian Ming teased.

“I’m just saying.” The scion chuckled awkwardly.

Of course, due to their relationship, Paramount Gate had a high possibility of joining Three Thousand Dao when it came down to it.

“Is your sect ready for the worst-case scenario if your emperor is nowhere to be found?” The daoist asked Ye Tingrong.

“Mmm…” Tingrong pondered for a bit before letting out a sigh The worst-case scenario didn’t look good for them at all. Even if she were to marry into another sect, her fate would be rather pitiful.

“Well, it’s not looking that bad yet. Miss Ye, you should run far away.” The scion suggested with a soft tone.

This wasn’t a bad idea because, at the very least, she would be able to survive.

“I am a member of Golden Gate and a descendant of Golden Fist Emperor. I can’t run away when the sect is facing a crisis.” Tingrong refused strongly.

“I’m sorry.” The scion apologized. Despite his suggestion, he didn’t think that he would be able to run away either if his sect was in trouble. He would choose to die alongside it as well.

“It’s not like there isn’t a solution to this.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Oh? What is it?” Jian Ming blurted out.

“Go ask Golden City for help. Of course, success is not guaranteed.” Li Qiye said.

Tingrong’s eyes lit up after hearing this. This was indeed an option.

Golden City was a forgotten behemoth. It was strong enough to fight against True Immortal.

Moreover, both Golden Divine Fist and Golden Fist Emperor came from there. They were influential characters as well.

If Golden City cared about past ties, perhaps it would lend its support.

“Well, our Golden Gate has no ties with Golden City since the ancestor left long ago.” She wasn’t confident about this potential ally.
