Chapter 3846: Complacency

“As if a nobody like you is worthy of seeing my greatness.” Li Qiye quipped without holding back.

The young lord immediately turned red and trembled with rage: “I see, I see, I am just a nobody.” Re𝒂𝒂d the latest stories 𝒐n nov𝒆lbin(.)com

His clan wasn’t unbeatable or anything but still had relative influence in Black Wood Cliff. Now, he as its young lord was being looked down on in public? This was truly humiliating.

If it wasn’t for Wei Qianqing, he might have attacked Li Qiye already to teach the guy a lesson or two about propriety.

“I might be a nobody.” The young lord restrained his anger and retorted: “But I still want to see the style of the heavenly genius. Since you are him, show us how peerless and dominant you are. What do you think, gentlemen?”

He tried to drag the crowd into the mix as well. The older cultivators only wanted to watch the show but the younger cultivators glared at Li Qiye.

“I’m sure the phenomena of a heavenly genius will be incredible. The grand dao will erupt and it’ll look like the descent of an immortal. We would love to see it.” Another young talent smiled.

“That’s right, broaden our horizon already.” Others started laughing. They naturally wouldn’t accept Li Qiye as the heavenly genius.

First, all of them wanted this classification from the Grand Seer since it would change their fortune. Nonetheless, they would be okay with him picking someone like Three Slashes. They would have no grievance to speak of because Three Slashes was the strongest and most prestigious genius in Black Wood.

This didn’t apply to Li Qiye. The guy was only an outsider with little fame. How could he convince the crowd of his supremacy? Thus, they all assumed that the Grand Seer was being sarcastic.

Three Slashes smiled and spoke: “The chosen genius should be the heaven’s favorite, capable of suppressing Black Tides to save the world. You are a crane among a flock of chickens, destined to be great. Please show everyone what you can do so that they’ll be convinced.”

He spoke in a casual manner, seemingly lacking any personal agenda or malice. Li Qiye still didn’t answer.

“Hmph, too scared to do it. Someone this cowardly is no heavenly genius, only a rat.” One youth snorted.

“The heavenly genius certainly fears nothing, similar to someone unbeatable and charismatic like Young Lord Biandu.” Another uttered coldly.

“So if he’s the heavenly genius, then the young lord must be a supreme existence.” One older expert joined in.

They mocked Li Qiye while currying favor with the young lord.

“Mind your own business instead of uttering nonsense!” Wei Qianqing’s expression soured and shouted at them.

They merely disliked an outsider like Li Qiye and knew who she was. Thus, they decided to listen to her and swallow their words. After all, it was better to give this legion commander some face.

“I’ll do it then!” Young Lord Tuhuo suddenly shouted and leaped onto the platform in a cool manner.

The crystal ball lit up after his touch. “Poof!” He became engulfed in flames.

He eventually pulled his hand back before many curious gazes and laughed heartily: “Haha, I saw a fire dragon playing in the air, this is as auspicious as can be!”

“Is this a sign that the young lord will successfully train the True Dragon Flame Art?” One youth wanted to please him and said: “You’ll certainly become the Fire Dragon Venerable in the future.”

“That sounds about right.” One expert nodded approvingly.

The Tuhuo placed second in this region so it was understandable for others to flatter its young lord.

“Fire Dragon Venerable? That’s not a bad title at all.” Young Lord Tuhuo was elated to hear all the praises, already having chosen his future title.

“Senior, what does it mean to see a fire dragon playing in the air?” The young lord asked the Grand Seer.

The seer responded while staring at him: “The Tuhuo Clan is versed in playing with fire.”

The crowd already thought that this was an auspicious sign. Now, since the seer talked about the clan’s affinity with the flames, they thought that the young lord would really become this so-called Fire Dragon Venerable later on.

“I see. Thank you, Senior, I will try even harder on the path of fire in order to reach the apex. I’ll absolutely become the Fire Dragon Venerable.” The young lord glowed with anticipation and determination.

Though he wasn’t the heavenly genius, he still had a great divination session on top of being confirmed by the Grand Seer.

“What he meant is, those who play with fire will be burned.” A nonchalant voice interrupted his celebration.

Everyone looked over and saw that the speaker was Li Qiye. It was a bad time to make this comment since it could be construed as purposely diminishing someone’s fortune.

To say something so ominous meant provoking the young lord and his clan. That was unwise for anyone staying at Black Wood Cliff.

The young lord was livid and furiously shouted: “Brat, watch your mouth!”

“I’m merely warning you out of kindness.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“Ignorant fool! You must be tired of living!” The young lord couldn’t keep his cool any longer and jumped off the platform.

He has never been afraid of anyone while on his territory. Plus, Li Qiye was an outsider.

“Ridiculous, do you wish to fight?” Wei Qianqing glared at him.

Her dignified and oppressive aura instantly crushed his momentum, causing him to pull back.

As a legion commander and one of the five heroes of Duality, her power was impressive. She was the strongest of the five too so this young lord was no match for her.

This left him in a tough position. He obviously didn’t want to fight her but to retreat like a cowardly turtle was shameful as well.

“Fellow Daoist, just mind your words next time.” Three Slashes smiled and tried to appease both sides.
