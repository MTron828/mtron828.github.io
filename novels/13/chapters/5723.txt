Chapter 5724: Stomping

“He’s back!” The survivors became ecstatic.

“I knew that the supreme existence would not abandon us.” Someone said excitedly.

“He’ll rebuild Dao City and prosperity will return to The People.” An ancestor became teary.

“As long as the Sacred Teacher is around to lead us, the future looks bright.” A big shot clapped and exclaimed.

“Right, we must follow him and contribute when we can.” Experts and ancestors wanted to invite Li Qiye to lead them.

“Clank!” The metallic hum of a sword came from Celestial Court.

“Clank!” Another emanated from Immortal Dao City.

A figure left Immortal Dao City and immediately slashed Li Qiye. A similar slash started from Celestial Court as well.

The world fell into darkness - only the glints of the blades could be seen. They didn’t possess rampant energy or murderous intent, only a sense of eternity. Peerless existences would return to dust but not them.

Survivors were in awe and became blinded by the dual slashes. Mortals and emperors alike had no chance of stopping them.

“Outta here!” Li Qiye roared with a fierce gaze.

“Boom!” Primordial light erupted from him, surpassing eternity itself. All of the gleams and sharp images exploded afterward.

Li Qiye raised his foot for a stomp, gathering all the affinities in the world into one primordial strike capable of injuring the strongest existences.

The figure instantly raised his saber defensively, serving the karmic cycles and creating an impregnable fortress.

“Boom!” The stomp still crushed it and forced the figure to the ground.

It became resplendent, activating his strongest power with the ability to lift the entire world. Unfortunately, this couldn’t move Li Qiye’s primordial stomp - the heaviest strike of an epoch.

“Ahh!” The figure screamed before being reduced to dao particles scattering to the winds.

“Boom!” The heavenly bridge being raised by Li Qiye couldn’t handle his power and also turned into scattering particles.

Celestial Court could no longer delve into Immortal Dao City with this connection destroyed.

“Creak...” The gates of Immortal Dao City attempted to close but Li Qiye stopped it with a hand wave.

“He’s unbeatable!” The survivors couldn’t help but applaud thunderously.

Li Qiye resembled the lord of heaven and earth. They believed that The People would become the strongest branch in the world under his leadership and watched attentively as he entered Immortal Dao City.

“Does he wish to find the mysteries of Immortal Dao City?” Someone said softly.

“Given his power, he’ll be able to grasp everything easily. Immortal Dao City will fall under his control, it will aid us again.” An expert said excitedly.

“We wouldn’t need to be afraid of Celestial Court and The Race with Immortal Dao City blessing us.” An ancestor said sentimentally.

“If he wanted to seize the treasure, he would have done so the previous time. There must be something else in mind.” An old ancestor speculated.

Listeners thought about it and agreed with him. Li Qiye somehow managed to stop the gates from closing, displaying an ability to control Immortal Dao City. The mysteries here might not be crucial to him.

“Has to be the traitors.” The old ancestor finished his thought.

“Killing Luminous and West Bank Prime Emperor?” The others became emotional.

“I believe Sacred Teacher will not allow those degenerates to live.” The old ancestor said.

“They deserve death instead of freedom, it will be justice for the fallen ones.” Someone said indignantly.

“Yes, no mercy for those two, they must pay!” An ancestor who normally had a calm temper shouted.

“Blood for blood.” A survivor from West Bank gritted his teeth: “Millions have died because of them.” RêAd lat𝙚St chapters at nô(v)e(l)bin/.c/o/m Only

The survivors of West Bank despised their progenitor at this point - the cause of their demise and perpetual disgrace.
