Chapter 5549: Not From This World

Li Qiye grasped the aura and skillfully extracted it. It unraveled like a cocoon around the divine stalk despite attempting to resist.

“Zzz…” The strands struggled in futility.

“Clank!” Once the process was finished, the strands came together and suddenly erupted, looking like an octopus attacking with its tentacles.

It released a beam of light that exploded into countless swords. Each could pierce through everything in the world; no treasure or barrier could hope to stop it.

“Watch out!” Qin Baifeng shouted because the sharp rays could turn Li Qiye into a sieve.

He didn’t panic and raised his finger. “Pop!” Time and space around him became infinitely slow.

The eruption of power became frozen as well - looking like a still image. He then waved his hand and summoned a dao flame to burn them.

Right when the aura was destroyed, a bright slash cut through space and appeared near Li Qiye, aiming to dismember him.

“Watch out!” Niu Fen’s expression soured. This ambush startled him because it was on a whole new level compared to the light eruption earlier. This could cut his shell and him down as well.

Nothing in the world was sharper than this unexpected attack. “Clank!” However, Li Qiye managed to grasp it with two fingers, fully immobilizing it.

“What is this?” Niu Fen was serious for once. Just looking at this thing alone hurt his eyes despite his current cultivation. He felt that in due time, it could blind him.

“We’ll see how much longer you can hide.” Li Qiye added strength to his finger.

“Zzz…” It struggled and made the group feel that it was alive, seemingly screaming in agony before destruction.

Nothing else came after this thing was destroyed.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Still keeping cool, I see.” Li Qiye blew and caused the particles to disperse.

“Where the hell did this come from? Another foreign entity.” Niu Fen said in disbelief.

“Yes.” Li Qiye nodded.

Niu Fen glanced at the divine stalk and said: “Is Momentous Frontier a target now? A nefarious scheme is unraveling? Hmm, are the old geezers okay?”

“They’re fine for now, Momentous Dao is still complete.” Li Qiye said.

“Where is the Deity of Harvest now?” Baifeng murmured, wondering about the current situation.

‘Just a matter of time, can’t hide forever.’ Li Qiye sighed and thought to himself before channeling chaos true energy.

The gray and withered branches were bathed in a golden flow again. Everyone sensed divinity coursing through the stalk; the power of the deity could spread unobstructed once more.

“Let’s go, the issue isn’t here, this is only a minor spread.” Li Qiye glanced at the stalk and left the grotto with the group.

“To the tablet now?” Niu Fen asked.

“I heard there are many forbidden seals around the tablet, that area is a forbidden ground since it’s the foundation of our frontier.” Baifeng said.

“I know.” Niu Fen smiled: “The worm and ox toiled for this sake. Daoflame Dual Lords helped out too for the sealing.”

“Worm and ox? Do you mean Space Dragon Emperor?” Baifeng became curious. Calling the emperor a “worm” seemed rather disrespectful.

Space Dragon Emperor and Ox-dragon Ancestor were pioneers of the current dragon lord system. They were revered by the entire cultivation world; dragon lords viewed them as patriarchs.

Without their revolutionary achievements, Heavenly Sovereign would have been the highest realm for those who couldn’t become conquerors. They would have no way of competing against dao lords and conquerors.

“Who else?” Niu Fen laughed and said: “I do admit that the worm had changed from being a lousy cultivator to a benevolent hero. That’s like the sun rising from the west.”

“He will beat you up after hearing this.” Li Qiye smiled.

“As if I’m afraid of him, a powerful worm is still just a worm. Others might not know what he is but I do, I’m gonna make him call out for his parents just like how it was in the past.” Niu Fen immediately protested and declared with confidence.

Qin Baifeng became emotional. Although she didn’t know Niu Fen’s background, this was someone clearly on the same level as Space Dragon Emperor - something truly incredible.

“You’ve reached your true self but he did too.” Li Qiye smiled.

“That’s alright, our history together doesn’t change.” Niu Fen gloated.
