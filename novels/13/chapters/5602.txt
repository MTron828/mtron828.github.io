Chapter 5603: Alright, Don’t Be Greedy

The cloud was frightened by the incoming pulse, thinking that it was about to disperse.

However, nothing happened to it at all during the blinding radiance. After the initial blast, everyone saw the cloud being unharmed - not even a burnt mark could be seen on its white cotton exterior.

The pulse seemed to be rain, causing the cloud to grow fatter and fatter.

“Rumble!” The intensity and brightness of the pulse intensified, hellbent on taking down its enemies. The world was no different from a boat stuck amidst the storm, on the verge of capsizing.

After a few seconds, Celestial Court's commanders realized something was wrong. The energy in the pulse was enough to overfill the inside of the continent and cause an implosion.

Alas, this cloud seemed eager to absorb the pulse like a dried tree absorbing water. It was an enjoyable process and the cloud wanted more.

“What is going on?” An emperor found this unbelievable, having no idea of the origin of the cloud.

“Abort the formation! Abort!” Commanders started giving the order to stop the pulse. If this continued, they would be the ones sucked dry.

Unfortunately, they found it difficult to stop the formation due to the established channeling path with the cloud. DiiScôver 𝒏𝒆w stori𝒆s on no/𝒗/e()/lbin(.)com

“Boom!” The commanders decisively forced the issue, blowing up the momentum with their own power.

Armies rained downward as a result. Many emperors and monarchs suffered serious injuries; most lower-ranking soldiers and captains weren’t so lucky.

“Ahh!” They exploded into bloody mists while others smashed into the ground.

Six-finger and the others were speechless. The pulse of that momentum could have broken through the barriers of Dao City and reduced them to ashes.

Now, the cute cloud blocked it and forced them to detonate their formation - something truly illogical.

“Withdraw!” War Ancient God ordered.

He and the other commanders waited by the rear, hoping to buy time for the rest of the armies.

“Let’s play again.” Li Qiye smiled at the cloud.

Seeing his smile creeped the cloud out. It wanted to scream and protest but he caught it first.

Its form resembled a large piece of cotton candy but Li Qiye combed through it and turned it into a white rope.

“Whoosh!” He swung it forward and it extended infinitely.

Before people could grasp the situation, they heard a snapping sound and the rope coiled around all of Immortal Dao City.

The sound was loud enough to shake the entire continent. The stars above lost stability.

“Boom!” Immortal Dao City’s light erupted, causing everyone to look up at the beam.

Peerless runes appeared from the light with what could only be described as the immortal affinity. The city became the source of the dao.

Meanwhile, the rope looked like a parched beast. It devoured the immortal light, runes, and dao as well.

“How can this be?!” Luminous and his allies’ jaw dropped to the ground. They had never seen anything like this in their whole life.

Immortal Dao City had been under the possession of The People for eras now. Although some could borrow its power, none could activate the city enough to emit these phenomena.

The white rope had no issue absorbing a force capable of destroying the entire continent.

“Alright, don’t be greedy.” Li Qiye pulled the rope back and rolled it in his hand, forming a loop of immortal light.

“Buzz.” It continued to multiply in his grasp - one loop to ten, ten to one hundred, one hundred to ten thousand, and ten thousand to infinity...

“Whoosh!” All the loops suddenly flew outward toward the armies of Celestial Court.

“Shit!” The commanders became alarmed and summoned their strongest weapons.

Bright imperial explosions and mighty techniques aimed to destroy the loops.
