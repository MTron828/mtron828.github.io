Chapter 5642: Cursed Bloodline

“Go.” Li Qiye tapped and infused light into Sindragon, removing the decaying aura from the afflicted flesh.

“Buzz.” He radiated primordial light to create a barrier large enough for the whole dragon.

This primordial force purified the cells within the mist, burning them down to ashes.

“Doesn’t seem like a miasma, it’s so damn strong.” Sindragon became afraid. He wouldn’t dare to come here without Li Qiye because there might be more dangerous things looming ahead.

“Call it a curse on the bloodline.” Li Qiye said.

“A curse? By whom?” Thousand-hand asked.

“The villainous heaven.” Li Qiye said.

The two immediately understood why they couldn’t nullify the decaying aura stemming from the vitality of the waterfall. This resembled a heavenly tribulation - something beyond their ability to stop.

Numerous geniuses and great emperors had been killed by the tribulations. In fact, twelve-will emperors had fallen as well in the previous epoch. 

As for them, dao lords rarely had to face tribulations. Because of this, they were even more susceptible compared to the experienced emperors and monarchs. The ones who managed to survive until now had faced numerous tribulations during their epoch.

“But why the curse?” Thousand-hand asked.

“For going against it.” Li Qiye glanced upward.

The two understood that cultivation was going against the heaven. Because of this, emperors and monarchs in the past had to face tribulations - the punishment of the heaven.Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

“The old heaven ignores the world for the most part but a few extreme matters are not allowed. For example, a bloodline this evil has to be cursed, especially when it is reaching atavism.” Li Qiye elaborated.

“Just what did they do?” Sindragon murmured.

Massacres carried out by top cultivators happened rather often. However, tribulations didn’t descend then. Sindragon was curious about the past events warranting the heaven’s wrath.

“Why do you think the dark overlords go into hiding?” Li Qiye asked.

“I believe it’s because they craft paragon artifacts, that will incite the heavenly wrath.” Sindragon remarked.

“Not necessarily. Some crafting will just face tribulations like emperors cultivating, but a few will face relentless onslaught.” Li Qiye said.

“They destroyed the world, right? Celestial Court had a weapon like that once.” Thousand-hand said.

“True Bones.” Li Qiye said: “The weapon itself is not the reason but rather, the crafting process.”

“They refined an entire epoch for True Bones.” Sindragon thought this was terrifying.

The duo’s hands were stained with blood, especially Sindragon who had even eaten people before. However, refining an epoch took it to the worst level. 

Li Qiye smiled and didn’t say anything else. He glanced at the top of the waterfall and said: “Come, to the source.”

Sindragon had no fear after being protected by Li Qiye’s primordial barrier. He roared and leaped into the air.

The height of the waterfall was unimaginable, seemingly originating from the heaven. A regular ancient ancestor couldn’t fly up infinitely.

On the other hand, a top dao lord like Sindragon soared with incredible speed and stamina. Once they reached the top of the waterfall, the duo became startled by the strange sight.

There was no source; the blood poured down from thin air. They could circle this place and wouldn’t be able to spot anything different.

“How strange.” Sindragon murmured.

“It should be connected to High Heaven Aegis.” Thousand-hand commented.

“No, just a dimensional overflow.” Li Qiye shook his head and focused his power on the unknown source.

“Creak…” He firmly grasped and forcefully opened the source.

The duo felt as if he was about to tear the sky open. His hands possessed enough power to shape the world even if it was in a primordial state. They knew that this was beyond their current cultivation.

“Creak.” Once he pried heaven and earth apart, the true source of the waterfall appeared - a starry sky so near yet so far.

The duo thought that they would be able to raise their hand and touch it but then again, it stretched infinitely beyond and blended with the great cosmos. They might not be able to traverse such vast spacetime.

The new hole opened by Li Qiye resembled an enormous mouth spewing out blood. In the center was a peculiar entity indescribable by words.

It somewhat resembled a statue with numerous rapidly growing masses. It seemed that the thing wanted to split into countless malevolent forms.

It had four large and distinct faces. They were deathly pale, looking like masks or carved from limestones.

What added to the horror was their wide-open mouth with blood gushing out. The blood cascaded down into the unknown entity and caused it to grow larger. Moreover, the extra blood poured down and formed the blood waterfall seen in Lightning Realm.
