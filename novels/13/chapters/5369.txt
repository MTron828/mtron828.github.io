Chapter 5370: A New Last Name Bestowed

She felt relaxed and free for the first time; her dao heart inadvertently opened and welcomed this sensation. The rays took root in her dao heart and infected every crevice. Her true fate and mind were more than willing to be bathed by this gentle light.

Her mind was one of a frozen world - a reflection of her lonely life. Perhaps the last time she felt loved was while being a baby embraced by her parents.

Later on, she only knew of survival and the dao. She sealed her emotions in order to stay alive; this didn’t change even after she became a conqueror.

After all, why would an imperious conqueror need love from anyone? She found herself stuck in a chilling peak, still alone. This was not her original personality or her choice in order to reach the dao but rather, a product of circumstances.

Now, his light illuminated her mind and dao heart, slowly melting the mental glaciers and nourishing them.

The process could only be described as wonderful without a hint of discomfort. She enjoyed this sensation as her dao heart slowly melted, allowing more rays to enter.

They eventually reached the crack in her dao heart. Despite being gentle and warm, they still caused painful memories to resurface.

Nonetheless, they served as a panacea and slowly purified the wound, intending to close it forever.

She trembled as the scars came back but as time passed, she felt a strange itch in her mind and became numb. She stopped thinking and immersed herself, allowing the warmth to spread throughout her body.

Happiness and joy returned to replace the chilling loneliness. She found herself leaving the frigid mountain for a green field. Her laughter echoed throughout the valleys. It has been a long time since she last laughed, let alone feeling happiness.

She eventually regained her wits and felt as comfortable as can be. Everything was soft and tingly - perhaps the same joy while being in the womb.

Tears moistened her cheeks, causing her to wipe them. This experience has drastically improved her mental state and dao heart.

“You are you, what happened to your parents is in the past now. You must live your own life and know that you are freed from the past. You are Li Xian’er now.” Li Qiye said.

“Li Xian’er.” She said softly.

The previous name had only caused her pain and reminded her of the tragic past. Becoming a conqueror didn’t solve her problems. The existence of her name was an inescapable bane.

Although her dao heart has been healed by the warming, there was nothing Li Qiye could do about her name outside of actually changing it.

By ceasing to be Jue Xian’er, she no longer had to be tied down by her parents and the past, able to live on as herself alone.

From today onward, her name was Li Xian’er. Jue Xian’er was now gone with her mother.

“Young Noble, I will repay your grace with my life.” She then bowed before Li Qiye.

“I don’t need your life. You can repay me by walking farther on the endless dao path.” He accepted the gesture and told her to get up.

Her heart was filled with warmth. She reached for her veil, wanting to remove it to reveal her true self. Geett the l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels on no/v/elbin(.)c/om

“I know you already since I have granted you a new life, there’s no need for another introduction.” Li Qiye stopped her and smiled.

“Yes, you have breathed new life onto me, no different from my birth parents.” She said, accepting someone else into her life.

For the first time, she felt that cultivation could be a happy matter - no longer a tribulation to be endured.
