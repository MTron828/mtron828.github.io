Chapter 4254: Comprehension

Light of the Worlds and Saber and Swords’ appearance perplexed the crowd.

A while ago, the venerable and the vajra chose to use their own dao. It seemed rather effective on both a personal and practical level.

On one hand, this patrimony weapon might be the strongest tool for Nine-wheel Citadel. As for Sea Emperor, they still had two heavenly swords. Using those should be more destructive than Saber and Swords. This was before mentioning them being the perfect match for his sect’s sword formation as well.

“Why that saber?” A high elder murmured.

Meanwhile, the duo used the foundation of their sect in order to deliver an ultimate blow.

“Another?!” The venerable seemed as youthful as can be.

“Why not? Just useless struggling.” Li Qiye smiled.

“We’ll find out soon enough!” The vajra roared thunderously and made people see stars. ÚpTodated 𝒏ov𝒆ls on 𝒏o(v)𝒆l()bin(.)c𝒐m

“Start!” The venerable didn’t waste time and immediately attacked.

The terrible sword-saber formation suddenly appeared beneath Li Qiye and expanded at a shocking rate. The combined dao twisted together and coiled around him like two iron chains.

“Imprisonment!” He roared and performed a dao seal to immobilize Li Qiye.

“Cosmic Reversal!” The vajra crazily roared and his treasure’s light engulfed the world. Everything suddenly flipped around.

“What’s going on?!” Spectators became startled since they sensed the sudden shift.

All affinities nearby were moved to Li Qiye’s location - a frightening level of suppression. People could already hear the sounds of his bones breaking.

He was immobilized by the venerable and now, the full brunt of the world was pressing down on him.

“He’s gonna die!” Someone shouted while feeling aches and pain all over.

However, this was only the beginning. A world-ending explosion came from the formation and the halos, blinding the crowd in the process.

The sheer force of this ultimate move forced the crowd on the ground, unable to move an inch. The true masters were able to keep their eyes open and stare at the scene. They saw two majestic figures appearing.

“Dao lords!” They bellowed.

“Comprehension, Saber to Swords!” The venerable’s voice echoed across the realms.

“Comprehension, Nine-wheel Cycle!” The vajra roared as well.

The weapons fixated on Li Qiye and illuminated him.

“The first strike!” A spectating ancestor screamed.

“This is it!” Another trembled.

The three strikes made patrimony weapons special compared to regular dao lord weapons. They included Comprehension, Mastery, and Extinction. Each strike was comparable to a full-powered attack from a dao lord.

The image of Saberlearned Dao Lord could be seen in the sword formation. Sabers and swords rotated around him in harmony as he seemed to be searching for the ultimate dao profundity. His grand dao manifested into reality with enough power to split the heaven.

As for the halos, they created the image of Nine-wheel Dao Lords. Each halo could shoulder three thousand worlds. The inhabitants in each individual realm offered their power to the dao lord. He became the center of the universe, the god of gods.

Both geniuses and ancestors realized how weak they were in the grand scheme of things while experiencing these attacks.

People understood why the venerable didn’t use the heavenly swords. It seemed that he preferred to use the formation to unleash a Comprehension named Saber to Swords.

“So they knew how to use it.” A king gasped.

The two were capable enough to use this attack. However, the limitation previously was their lifespan and depleted longevity.

Moreover, they used up their longevity blood during the previous exchange with Li Qiye. Relying on their sect’s foundation was the only way to use these weapons to their fullest potential.
