Chapter 5737: Count Me In As Well

The pair of fiery phoenix wings spread larger and became resplendent, filling the expanse with its undying power.

“Bam!” It blocked Heaven Burial’s mighty attack.

“What an armor set.” He couldn't help but praise: “Far stronger than your old draconic armor.”

“It is enough to slay you today!” Fengying roared and thrust her spear, releasing ten thousand waves of draconic energy at the enemy. They obliterated everything in its path, clearing the way forward.

“Come!” Heaven Burial laughed and sent his divine ring forward. Although the three thousand worlds within have been destroyed, the chaotic expanse within wielded immense potential for destruction.

“Rumble!” The world shook as he stopped her onslaught.

“Fellow Daoist, you are extraordinary but I cannot allow you to win.” Heaven Burial said.

The two were mortal enemies and Fengying had a reason for her hatred beyond their allegiance - avenging her younger brother who had his primordial dao fruit extracted, Martial Conqueror.

Today, she had gained the phoenix armor and could keep up with him. Alas, killing him seemed impossible due to his defenses.

“You boast an impressive defense but your offensive capabilities cannot take me down.” Heaven Burial said, forcing other combatants back due to his divine ring.

“Count me in as well.” A radiant Buddha with stars around him appeared, instantly attacking with an evil-subduing vajra empowered by a boundless Buddhist kingdom.

“Activate!” Heaven Burial’s expression changed and summoned nine more rings around him.

“Go!” Fengying unleashed another draconic thrust.

Divine rings crumbled before the combined might of the spear and vajra.

“Enough!” Heaven Burial teleported behind Vajra Dao Lord and attempted to smash him to pieces with the main ring.

“Screech!” Fengying’s phoenix armor blessed Vajra Dao Lord with its light, granting him a pair of fiery wings and defensive runes.

“Great!” The dao lord laughed after warding off the unblockable attack, shifting his power into full offensive mode with the vajra.

Meanwhile, Fengying summoned a gigantic energy dragon with her spear, sending it straight at Heaven Burial like a beam.

“Not bad.” Heaven Burial was not afraid in the slightest. More divine rings appeared with the force of a heavenly dao.

Combatants have found their enemies, the same for the grand commander of The People - Demon.

She took one step forward, appearing near Light-dragon Conqueror.

“Fellow Daoist, try this!” Light-dragon punched while still sitting in the meditative pose, unleashing the light affinity. The expanse turned brighter; strands intensified into light pillars.

Demon formed a mudra with both hands, gathering her nature energy. She retaliated with a punch carrying the force of a tiger and the agility of a snake - nimble but forceful, domineering yet flexible.

The sublime punch lacked an explosive display but summoned the mysteries of the beasts. Their exquisite dao propelled her martial art to the apogee level, allowing her to dispel Light-dragon’s radiant punch.

She rushed forward with the grace of a crane, gliding and flickering elusively before appearing in front of Light-dragon.

“Marvelous!” Light-dragon couldn’t help but exclaim after seeing her punch.

“Boom!” The heavenly dragon behind him clawed at the attacker.

This was the ancestral king of all beasts; all else trembled before its might. Nevertheless, Demon easily evaded the attack as if she was as formless as the wind itself.

Her aura was mysterious and omnipresent - being everywhere yet nowhere. It penetrated like mercury flowing across the ground.

She bypassed his defenses like a phantom and appeared before him once more with a clenched fist.

A myriad of forms emerged - a white crane spreading its wings, a fierce tiger descending from the mountain, and a celestial dragon devouring the sky...

“Rumble!” Her punch carried the force of a primal world as it smashed the opponent.

The impact appeared negligible due to the lack of explosions but she had focused the might of the world onto a single point.

“Boom!” He finally was forced out of his meditative pose. In this crucial moment, a sacred armor set appeared on his body.

Each ray emanating from it was the embodiment of divinity and light - the accumulation from many ages. It formed a formidable barrier around him, seemingly impenetrable.𝑅êạd new chapt𝒆rs on no/v/e/l𝒃in(.)com
