Chapter 5111: My Condition Is Simple

Nonetheless, they remained calm and collected.

“Fellow Daoist, why do you insist on making an enemy out of Celestial Court?” Vessel didn’t start a fight right away.

“All problems can be mediated.” Ascension said: “Allow us to lend you a hand in solving this issue, turning swords into silks.”

“As long as you are willing, we can negotiate because Celestial Court’s doors are open to everyone. Given your power, you will absolutely shine there.” Six-pot nodded in agreement.

Although they wanted to kill him earlier, they still tried to recruit him. This made ancestors from The People rather nervous.

If Li Qiye were to accept, it would be a fatal blow for The People for the next era to come. The lower continents would be lost completely.

After all, losing Ascension and Greenmountain was a serious blow already, especially for the members of Primal. Li Qiye was an even more pivotal character since he was the only one who could oppose these conquerors.

“My condition is simple and consistent.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Let us know, Fellow Daoist, and we will send the message back to Celestial Court.” Vessel said.

If the four of them could easily suppress him, they wouldn’t be wasting breath talking right now. Alas, after the first exchange, they weren’t confident in beating him in the slightest and didn’t want the risk.

“I just need Celestial Court to be reduced to dust.” Li Qiye said.

“Yes!!!” A dragon lord from The People couldn’t help but shout after hearing this. They could finally relax after hearing Li Qiye’s determination.

Two of their ancestors have joined Celestial Court. It made the struggle seems meaningless in the grand scheme of things.

“You deserve death!” Greenmountain roared and the entire peak behind him lit up.

He utilized his dao to control the power of Reincarnation. Its laws harmonized with him and flames shot into the air. They engulfed him and made him look even more majestic.

“Fellow Daoist, since you insist on not seeing the errors of your way, your punishment shall be death.” Vessel’s murderous intent erupted.

Her sword energies left long scars in the air. Not to mention regular experts, even dragon lords felt sharp pain despite standing awfully far away. As for other inhabitants, blood seemed to be oozing from their pores.

“Incredible murderous intent.” A six-fruit dragon lord couldn’t believe it.

Though she was the most friendly one out of the bunch, she decisively changed direction into the forceful path. This was her style - ready to fight regardless of the opponent’s strength.

“Give me your strength!” Greenmountain was the first to take action.

The inhabitants of the lower continents, both the weak and strong, started glowing with the light of life.

The particles gathered together above the conqueror to form a heavenly halo. Everyone felt as if they were entirely trapped by this phenomenon, never being able to escape. Their fate was his now.

Of course, his only target was Li Qiye.

“Clank!” The halo wrapped around Li Qiye, wanting to seal his dao power, chaos true energy, and anything from the fate palaces.

The name of the technique was World Halo. This dao allowed him to obtain the first dao fruit. In fact, it made him competitive with those on a higher level.

Formidable foes couldn’t break free from this restraint. They needed to kill him in order to break free but this was difficult due to the various restrictions. Moreover, the longer the battle, the stronger the suppression.Nêww 𝒄hapters will be fully updated at (n)ov(𝒆)l/bin(.)com

“Activate!” Ascension Conqueror released his divine scroll again.

It unwrapped and sucked Li Qiye into the content inside. This was a world with numerous gigantic gods. Their auras immediately drowned him.

“Ascension Terra!” This technique was actually known to the crowd.

He was the creator of the technique and had used it all his life. Rumor has it that when opponents were successfully sealed, they would become a part of his list. Their powers became his afterward.

“Boom!” Ascension himself entered this world and exerted his tyranny over the land. The gods immediately channeled their power into him, lighting him ablaze with endless mighty.
