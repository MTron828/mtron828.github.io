Chapter 3740: A Little Difficult

Dugu Lan’s words made the crowd ponder. If she had only said it once, it could be coming from humility. Alas, it seemed that she was merely telling the truth.

“No one else is stronger than your group right now, Fairy Dugu.” One genius said.

The four great geniuses stood at the top in the holy ground. The internal ranking of these four remained unknown.

“I do not dare to accept this praise, there are higher peaks in the holy ground that just aren’t known.” Dugu Lan shook her head.

“Really?” The genius and his friends were perplexed.

“I think that’s impossible. Only the other three geniuses might be a match for her in the holy ground.” A fan of Dugu Lan didn’t believe it.

“Yes, Fairy Dugu, your group working together will definitely stop Righteous Scion.” The other chimed in.

“Well, I’ll be the first to admire someone who can push Righteous Scion back. I wish to broaden my horizon and see such an expert.” Hu Ben laughed.

He wasn’t being sarcastic since very few in the young generation in the holy ground were stronger than him. He didn’t care for the rest and also doubted Dugu Lan’s comment.

“It would be the holy ground’s blessing to have someone like that around.” Phantom Sacred Child nodded, feeling skeptical as well. After all, he had fought most of the famous geniuses in the holy ground or at least knew about them.

With the exception of Golden Cicada Buddhist Child, no one else was on the same level as the three present.

Moreover, all the top geniuses in the holy ground have virtually gathered here. None fitted her description.

“There’s always a miracle creator.” Dugu Lan calmly said and glanced at the creek nearby again: “If we can’t stop the scion, I hope someone else will do so.”

“Fairy, no need to boost the enemy’s morale.” Hu Ben smiled and said: “We won’t know the true victor until the very end. Our holy ground’s talents can’t be inferior to Righteous Sect.”

Hu Ben rarely lost during his debut. Due to his experience in battles, he was confident in fighting against Righteous Scion.

He was certainly aware of his foe’s ability and reputation. Nonetheless, this was limited to Righteous Sect. The guy could be strong just like the legends but he still wanted to give it a shot.

“We should be the ones creating a miracle instead of waiting for someone else.” Phantom said, being relatively confident.

“Miracle, huh?” This word immediately made people think of the same person.

“Yes, that guy might actually be able to defeat that monster.” One youth murmured.

“No one can do it outside of Fairy Dugu’s group, don’t be ridiculous.” The fans of the four immediately refuted this belief.

“Who are you talking about?” A young cultivator asked.

“Li Qiye, the guy dubbed as the son of miracles. He has done some ridiculous things so far.” The youth answered.

“He trampled the two mansions at the capital, right?” Some nearby said.

“That’s him.” The youth said.

In reality, the crowd’s impression of Li Qiye wasn’t that positive. They had nothing against Li Qiye but simply thought that he lacked a certain something compared to Dugu Lan’s group.

These four came from prestigious clans and had brilliant talents. Moreover, they trained hard in order to earn their current prestige.

On the other hand, Li Qiye was only a woodchopper who somehow became the saber messenger of Vajra. Maybe he was an Enlightened Being now but this was far from enough.

This cultivation level was only decent at best and had nothing to do with the word “genius”. Plus, it seemed that most of his feats were done with external help.

“This Li Qiye is devilish indeed, maybe he can be of use against Righteous Scion.” An older expert became interested in this development.

“Should we invite him to the coalition? I think it will heavily increase our chances.” One youth suggested.

“I haven’t seen him recently though. He might not be interested at all or he would be here right now.” Someone else who has been staying at the capital said.

“Not interested? More like he’s afraid or he would be here if he is as magical as you all claim. Isn’t defeating the scion a great opportunity for him to be famous?” Another who disliked Li Qiye snorted.

“That makes sense.” A few nearby nodded.

“Our foe is truly strong. We should still try and invite any ally that we can.” The opposition suggested.

“If Young Master Li is willing to assist the holy ground, nothing can be better.” Dugu Lan smiled.

“I want to see this Li Qiye without that invincible armor. We’ll see if he’s really magical.” Hu Ben laughed, clearly revealing his disdain.

His animosity towards Li Qiye was understandable. He supported the third prince while Li Qiye killed several allies of his. There was no way he would like Li Qiye.

“We should welcome this young noble into our alliance. It’s just that the fight will be very dangerous, he needs to think about it.” Phantom said. His attitude was better than Hu Ben’s but there was still a veiled contempt towards Li Qiye.

“There’s no way this Li guy stands a chance.” The majority agreed with the two geniuses.

“Li Qiye has numerous ace cards up his sleeve, don’t forget this.” The other side thought that everything came easy to Li Qiye for some inexplicable reason.

“Don’t forget that Righteous Scion has even more ace cards as the successor of Righteous. He has dao lord weapons capable of destroying everything.” Another snorted.

“No, I have no doubt that Li Qiye would be able to repel Righteous Scion.” Dugu Lan expressed her stance and silenced the crowd. They didn’t dare to argue against her.

“Alright, let’s invite Li Qiye. Time to see his divinity.” Hu Ben said.

“It’s not a bad idea.” Phantom agreed.

Some members of the audience thought that these two might be using this battle to kill Li Qiye with a borrowed knife.

“The letter is at Buddha Emperor City now!” A message interrupted the conversation.
