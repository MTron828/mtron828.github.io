Chapter 4332: Crown Prince

The glow around the young lord was brimming with divinity - a sign of a cultivator at the sovereign realm. It was oppressive, enough to force the weaker members into submission.

“So that’s a sovereign…” One pale youth trembled with fear.

“One hand wave is enough to exterminate nine clans.” Another whispered.

If the young lord were to attack a minor sect, it would be akin to a dragon stomping down on an ant nest. The latter would have zero chance of resisting.

“His cultivation soared like the wind.” A great power’s disciple couldn’t help but praise.

He was indeed a genius, perhaps not one at the upper echelon, but still quite impressive. He certainly paled compared to his father but still more than kept up with his peers. Fôllôw 𝒏ew stories at n𝒐/v(e)lb/in(.)com

“A sovereign…” The daughter of Soaring Feather said sentimentally.

“His talent exceeds ours.” The young lord of Flow sighed.

Being a sovereign was worthy of pride because numerous cultivators from the last generation took a lifetime to get here.

His eyes brimmed with flames, capable of incinerating everything. Some spectators felt as if they were being burned while staring at him.

“He’s unbeatable…” A disciple from a weak sect realized the power gap.

“Killing the innocent is punishable with clan extermination.” The young lord slowly descended as if he was a god from above.

The consensus was that Li Qiye was finished along with Little Diamond.

“Who will carry out the punishment? You? You can’t do it.” Li Qiye smirked.

“Ignorant fool, I will let you experience a fate worse than death, the consequence of running your mouth!” The young lord was furious.

His hatred was clearly sensed by the audience. They felt a chill coursing down their spine and understood his rage.

He was the young lord of Dragon, the second strongest sect of the south. On the other hand, his opponent was the sect master of Little Diamond - a worm in comparison.

Today, this sect delayed his plan while its sect master spoke with contempt. If he didn’t kill them all, his authority would diminish significantly.

“You are out of line, Young Lord.” Suddenly, a third party walked onto the stage and spoke in a calm and natural tone.

He was around thirty or so, wearing a simple robe with no expensive trinkets. He lacked auras and visual phenomena as well.

Nonetheless, his pace was confident and sturdy. His eyes were particularly sharp and forceful, akin to all-cutting sabers.

The young lord’s oppressive aura suddenly melted like snow after his appearance. The weaker members could finally breathe easily.

Though most had no idea who he was, they could tell from his style that he was a noble of sorts.

“The heir of Lion’s Roar!” A great power’s disciple recognized him and shouted.

“Prince Chi.” The members of the great power bowed deeply toward him. Even the saintess of Dragon got out of her chair and lowered her head.

The members of the small sects were shocked after hearing his title. They were looking at the future of this land. How could they not be shocked?

“Your Highness!” They got on their knees and shouted respectfully.

There was a drastic difference in their attitude towards the young lord of Dragon and the heir of Lion’s Roar.

The former was oppressive and forced others into submission. On the other hand, the heir didn’t release his aura or any pressure. Nonetheless, he still commanded respect.

Lion’s Roar was the crownless king of Southern Desolace. The heir was the rightful ruler of the land - hence their reaction.

Though a few powers thought that Dragon could replace Lion’s Roar in the future, they still didn’t lack in manners.

The influence of Lion’s Roar has been embedded in the people’s heart for eras now, starting from the days of the Supreme Monarch.

The young lord’s expression changed after seeing the heir, especially when everyone prostrated before his opponent. He wasn’t stupid and could tell the difference in reaction.

Ultimately, more cultivators recognized Lion’s Roar and its heir. Their subservience was sincere and natural.

The heir saw Li Qiye on stage and increased his pace. He stopped in front of Li Qiye and bowed deeply: “Sir, Jinlin has been looking for you all this time. We’ve finally met again.”

This left everyone speechless and frozen. No one could overstate the heir’s prestige and nobility.

However, he was humbly using his real name and even bowed toward this sect master.

“S-sir?” The members of Little Diamond stammered, unable to accept this reality.

“What is going on?” Confusion struck the crowd.

The heir of Lion’s Roar was actually greeting this sect master by bowing.
