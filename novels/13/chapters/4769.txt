Chapter 4770: Leave

With that, he gestured for the three men to come over.

“Return from whence you came.” He told them.

“Young Noble?” Jian Ming didn’t expect this because they have been following Li Qiye for a long time now.

“I’m going somewhere soon.” He told them: “A calamity is incoming and this place is no longer suitable for you three to stay. Leave or perish.”

The three trembled and sensed something ominous after hearing the word “calamity” from Li Qiye’s mouth.

“We understand.” The three bowed toward him.

“Your ancestors have left behind impressive contingency plans. When the time comes, hide there.” He continued.

“We shall obey, Young Noble.” They bowed again.

Li Qiye then raised one finger and it shined with a light originating from the immortal gemstone.

“It is fate that has brought us together. I shall grant you a fortune for your effort.” Li Qiye pointed at Jian Ming’s forehead.

“Buzz.” The light entered his sea of memories and caused a tsunami, prompting him to shake and sweat uncontrollably.

The light now existed within his mind for eternity, always ready to guide him.

“Thank you, Young Noble!” Jian Ming prostrated and bowed repeatedly.

He then pointed at the daoist’s turtle shell and flicked his finger.

“Clank!” The shell leaped up into the air before falling back into the daoist’s hand. Now, it pulsed with a mysterious and profound radiance.

The daoist himself couldn’t understand right away despite his mastery of this art.

“Go, this fortune contains the future of you and your tribe. Do your best to understand it.” Li Qiye said.

“I will never forget your grace and generosity, Young Noble.” The daoist was moved to tears as he got on his knees.

This gift didn’t only benefit him but also the rest of his tribe. He thought that once he came back, he would erect a shrine to honor Li Qiye for ages to come.

“As for you, your Golden Gate is in-laws with the brat.” Li Qiye reminded the emperor.

As a top ancestor, he understood the implication right away - his sect would need to rely on Jian Ming in the future. In other words, Jian Ming had a bright future and would far exceed him.

Normally, he didn’t need to rely on anyone due to his status and power. In this case, he knew better than to not heed Li Qiye’s comment.

“I understand.” He prostrated to show respect.

The three didn’t dare to linger for long and immediately left the Primordial Union. They headed back to their sect in order to prepare for the worst.

Though they didn’t have a clear idea of this so-called calamity, this must be something earth-shattering. They wanted to help their fellow clan members escape or death was certain.

After chasing the three away, Li Qiye climbed up a magnificent peak. Its upper half was deep in space, taking roots up in the heaven instead of the ground like a tree.

He summoned a special light not belonging to him but rather, the Tree of Contribution.Alll 𝒍𝒂test nov𝒆l𝒔 on novelb𝒊n/(.)c𝒐m

“Buzz.” It flew into one of the mystical dao runes and caused a chain reaction, pulsing outward until it became something resembling a dao source.

At this exact second back in the ancestral ground of the four clans, the withered tree became resplendent again. Buds appeared and turned into green leaves at a rapid pace.

Dao lights emerged all over their territories. Their members felt chaos true energy surging out of the ground, turning their home into a paradise for cultivation.

“The tree has been reborn!” The ancestors sensed it right away, realizing that Li Qiye has carried out his promise and granted them a fortune.

“The forefathers bless us!” They and the juniors prostrated on the ground after seeing hope for the future again.

By this point, Jian Ming has returned. He told the other ancestors to tell everyone to come back. Their plan was to rely on the clans’ foundation and resources to survive this calamity.

Deeper up in the Primordial Union were numerous nebulas and dancing dao laws. Some black holes and chaotic spaces could be seen too; most were suppressed by the grand dao…

After crossing through various obstacles, he made it to a maelstrom with endless dao power and life force. It seemed to be the origin of all lives here.

Of course, this was only an embryo. The true source of the grand dao couldn’t be found so easily.

Li Qiye raised his hand and started deriving life and death while connecting with this maelstrom.

“Boom!” A massive power erupted and was felt by everyone. Dao lights poured from the sky and blinded spectators.

Nonetheless, they were able to see a pulsing figure.

“Who is it?” This became the main question.

“It’s Li Qiye.” Someone recognized the familiar figure.

“Is he at the dao source of the union? Or rather, the primordial source?” A peerless cultivator took a deep breath: “Does he want to enter?”

Others became emotional after hearing this.
