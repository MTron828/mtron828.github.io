Chapter 5074: No Other Choice

“I’m not trying to be disrespectful. Reality is often harsh, especially for the fat sheep. They’ll only become meals, this is their fate, their final destination.” Li Qiye shook his head and said.

“Young Noble, do you wish to consume us all?” The dragon blurted out.

“Seems like you’re the one being disrespectful. If I had any intention of doing so, I wouldn’t have helped you two find this ancestral nest. I could have roasted all the eggs too and filled my stomach. Today it’ll be dragon eggs, tomorrow it’ll be phoenix eggs, you guys won’t have any egg to incubate at all.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I misspoke, my apology.” The dragon sighed.

“But even if I don’t eat, it doesn’t mean that others won’t. Remember that this is a work of art, they don’t wish to eat little babies, the food has to grow up and be fat first. Most importantly, they also prefer to do nothing and just wait until the delicious pot is ready and full of ingredients.” Li Qiye stared at the two and said: “A pot with divine beasts will surely be coveted.”

“Is Voracious Leviathan aware of our presence?” The dragon had to ask.

“You’re lacking knowledge and foresight for asking that question. Sure, be afraid of Voracious Leviathan but keep in mind that it is only a little brother compared to the others, a newbie at best.” Li Qiye said.

The two shuddered after hearing this.

“Why do you think I’m still here needing to chat with the villainous heaven instead of embarking on the journey?” Li Qiye said.

“My epoch is a great tree while these existences are nothing more than some bugs. Sure, I’m trying to get rid of them but I also don’t mind if they eat a few leaves in the process. In this case, it’s even better for me if your epoch is eaten. It can be used as bait once it is strong enough.” He shrugged while speaking.

The two haven’t thought of Li Qiye using them in this manner. Yes, this remnant epoch was indeed delicious, especially the cosmic dragon and the divine beasts at full maturity.

“This is why I keep telling people about how nice I am yet they continue to misunderstand me.” He went on: “I traveled so far to come to offer you two some advice, only to be treated like a villain.”

With that, he laughed and said: “Just imagine this scenario, when doomsday comes, you two can cry and beg me for help, why should I help then? What do you have on the table that I care about?”

The two knew that in the worst-case scenario, they would have to ask him for help.

“Nothing.” Both admitted.

“Now do you see that I am being merciful and kind? Will you still refuse my help?” Li Qiye asked.

“What should we do?” The dragon gave up and decided to listen to him. This was a losing game from the very start.

If they didn’t listen to him, their fate would be worse. All of them and this entire epoch would be eaten by the overlords. The only real option was to listen to Li Qiye.

“Just tell us already, we have no other choice.” The tiger accepted his fate.

“It’s simple, I will give you a chance to fuse with my epoch, a display of my generosity and friendship.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“How does the fusion work?” The dragon asked, aware that Li Qiye was only doing this out of past sentiments.

If Li Qiye didn’t care about them, it wouldn’t be difficult for him to destroy this remnant epoch. The whole conversation was just a formality and a showing of friendship.

Being stubborn now instead of accommodating him would only have one result - destruction. At that point, the sentiments of the past would no longer be enough to save them, the same with surrendering after starting a fight.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“I will infuse my mantras into the bloodlines. From then on, the branch of the divine beasts shall be a race of my epoch.” Li Qiye said.

“Isn’t this the same as shackling us?” The tiger couldn’t help but say.

“That depends on how you look at it.” Li Qiye waved: “Of course, you and the ancestral dragon can refuse, I’ll be kind enough not to kill you. However, it just happens that I am lacking bait right now. All I need to do is to stir the water a bit and those who enjoy fried dragon meat will come to play.”

“We accept.” The dragon accepted this was the best possible outcome. The alternative was a replay of Divine Beast’s destruction.

Although having Li Qiye’s mantra in their bloodline meant being shackled by him, there was no other choice.

At the very least, they could still live freely and join an even bigger world. Endless possibilities still awaited them.

“We accept.” The tiger said as well.
