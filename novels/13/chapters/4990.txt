Chapter 4991: Jun Cuican

The youth released his dragon lord aura without holding back in the slightest. Those nearby felt as if they were being smashed in the chest by a hammer.

The three monarchs actually trembled in fear after sensing this. Yunyun and Ming Shi felt the same way. They would have been crushed if it wasn’t for Li Qiye.

Normally, dragon lords restrained their aura in order not to cause damage. The youth, on the other hand, found this unnecessary.

“Jun Cuican!” The youths became startled to see him.

This name was known by everyone in the lower continents. He overwhelmed ancient ancestors and overshadowed geniuses.

Among the current young generation, the strongest had to be Radiant Monarch of Godchaser Palace.

However, the most talented was none other than Jun Cuican since he was closer in age to Yunyun.

However, he looked down on competing with his peers and thought that there was no point in beating them.

This seemed arrogant but he was actually capable of backing it up. He already possessed four sacred fruits before the tender age of eighteen.

He was far younger than Radiant Monarch. Most believed that catching up and surpassing the monarch was only a matter of time.

Therefore, he traveled without hiding his aura, always looking as if he was the best.

“Be smart and scram or I will not show mercy.” He coldly uttered while gazing at the crowd.

The first three demon monarchs became annoyed along with the recently-arrived ones. He was strong but this was Demon - their world.

“Those are some big words, let’s see how strong you are then.” Grimface Monarch shouted furiously.

“You court death.” Jun Cuican summoned his sword. Its glint made it impossible for the demons to keep their eyes open.Vissit novelbin(.)c.𝒐m for updates

“Die!” Grimface Monarch shot out her hair. Loud winds came as they covered the sky like arrows.

“Clank!” A bright slash easily reduced the arrows into dust

“Pluuf!” It continued and severed the spider into two halves. As its true fate attempted to escape, it was pierced by energy rays and turned into a sieve. The spider let out its last cry of agony before death.

The other two monarchs were horrified, and the same for the other demons.

“Whoosh!” Another swordsman appeared above the valley with the same style of aggressive aura. A million swords seemed to be piling up in the air, culminating in a sword domain.

“Swordgrasp Venerable…” Ming Shi murmured.

Jun Cuican had a serious expression after seeing him.

“So many eyesores, die.” The old man immediately slashed downward without holding back.

“How dare you?!” Both demon monarchs shouted.

Three-fork Monarch spewed out miasma to form a net, possessing enough corrosive nature to reduce treasures into nothingness.

Scarletflame Monarch screeched and summoned a fiery saber. Its heat could burn the myriad realms.

Alas, the result was two heads rolling on the ground. Their true fate was annihilated by remnant sword energies as well. The gap in power was insurmountable - this was an ancient ancestor with five sacred fruits.

Other demons saw this and immediately stopped. This applied to human cultivators as well.

Both Jun Cuican and Swordgrasp Venerable didn’t give a damn about anyone, turning their focus back onto the god source.

“Young Miss, please hand over the god source and I shall bestow a fortune upon you.” The venerable suddenly spoke with a friendly tone.

He rarely had to use the word “please”. After all, given his status, his words were absolute commands.

“Venerable, don’t be so hasty. There is an order to this and I was here first.” Jun Cuican remained imperious despite knowing that he was weaker.

The venerable glared at the youth who met the gaze fearlessly.

“Virtuous Nephew, the item already has an owner, we have to see if she agrees or not.” The venerable knew that this youth had unlimited potential. If he couldn’t kill him in one move, it would be quite problematic in the future.

“So it’s a contest?” Cuican uttered coldly.

Both of them didn’t care about this little girl. It’s just that since they were from righteous sects, they couldn’t outright rob her.

“Indeed.” Swordgrasp Venerable responded.

“You two are famous cultivators and shouldn’t be trying to bully this little girl.” A pleasant voice interrupted their conversation.

A resplendent vine descended from the horizon, moving downward like the stroke of a brush on a painting.

“Tendril King.” They knew who she was right away.

Once the light dispersed, everyone saw a woman walking forward. She captivated the crowd with her beauty, especially the demons. They had never seen such a gorgeous woman before.
