Chapter 5664: Inborn Trinity

With a loud explosion, Li Qiye’s primordial light erupted and illuminated the dark world.

“Zzz...” The darkness sensed the threat of death and lunged for Li Qiye like a ravenous primal beast.

Unfortunately, it couldn’t overwhelm the primordial light. The endless waves were refined to ashes, making room for his light to reach the thirteen palaces.

South Emperor was left speechless since he couldn’t have dealt with the dark waves earlier. They were capable of drowning the entire six continents, leaving no room to hide.

It wouldn’t be an exaggeration to claim that this force could refine an epoch. He started thinking about overlords going crazy and wanting to perform a refinement.

Who would be able to stop them? The first line of defense was certainly the tribulations of the high heaven. Li Qiye was another.

He let out a helpless smile for having thought too highly of himself. He had believed that he could purify the darkness and learn the mysteries of the thirteen palaces.

As long as he could do so, he would be able to break through his dao limit and become an ancestor. The future would be limitless then.

Now, after entering the gate and actually seeing them, he understood that he had overestimated himself and underestimated the thirteen palaces. He would have been swallowed by the darkness and none would be able to save him then.

“Boom!” Li Qiye’s primordial light purified the dark world, allowing them to see the magnificent fate palaces.

The thirteen were transcending everything in the mortal world, breaking free of all dao constraints and escaping the karmic cycles...

However, an incessant flow of darkness surged from them. The amount was endless but most importantly, it was of utmost purity. This seemed to be a primal power, not stained by evil just yet but a natural force of heaven and earth.

“He willingly fell to the darkness.” South Emperor was startled.

The great being wasn’t overwhelmed by darkness but made a deliberate choice.

For example, he was invaded but his fate palaces still released the power of the Heaven’s Wills and his own dao source. They maintained the original form. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

On the other hand, the lord’s fate palaces produced darkness themselves. It was frightening to think about overlords willingly making this choice; none would be spared in their epoch.

“Boom!” Three divine rings appeared around the fate palaces - the likes of which South Emperor had never seen previously.

Each had a different light and represented a different karma. A suppression force immediately manifested into reality.

This was innate, existing from the start of the epoch. It persisted into the past, present, and future - lording over all other powers within the epoch.

“What are they?!” South Emperor’s expression changed drastically.

“Inborn trinity.” Li Qiye answered, leaving the emperor in awe.

Empowered by the three pulsing rings, darkness oozed out of the fate palaces with greater intensity. Not to mention mortals and regular cultivators, even emperors and gods wouldn’t be able to move an inch.

“Even if you are reborn, you still can’t do anything, let alone this inborn trinity!” Li Qiye roared: “Purify!”

A blinding detonation erupted as the image of a primordial tree appeared behind Li Qiye, successfully stopping the power of the inborn trinity.

“Rumble!” The latter struggled repeatedly but couldn’t keep up with the primordial tree.

After overpowering the trinity, his light became brighter and continued to purify the palaces and all else.

Sizzles could be heard as the darkness was being removed from both the palaces and the trinity. The primordial light entered the palaces and struck the four symbols, not leaving an iota of darkness behind.

“Clank! Clank!” Eventually, the palaces and the trinity harmonized with the primordial force, becoming resplendent and divine.

This was especially true for the inborn trinity, possessing an aura that could be found during the start of time.

South Emperor watched in amazement, unable to avert his gaze.
