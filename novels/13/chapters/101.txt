Chapter 102 : Marquis of Suppressive Might (2)

Li Shuangyan gave him a cold look and didn’t say anything. She was familiar with this expression. Everything was already under Li Qiye’s control whenever he showed this expression.

Many people paid attention to Li Qiye when he looked at the stone door, and there was also attention towards Li Shuangyan, who was next to him. She attracted even more gazes from the younger disciples.

“Who is that boy?”

Li Qiye’s arrival was reprimanded by Marquis of Suppressive Might, but afterwards, he still spoke conceited nonsense. At this moment, he even had a peerless beauty like Li Shuangyan by his side. It would be too difficult to not attract the attention of the people. Even people of the older generation were perplexed and thought that Li Qiye’s origin must be heavenly frightening.

“I heard that he is the prime disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect from two years ago. He’s not very exceptional and is only a disciple with a Mortal Physique, Mortal Life, and Mortal Fate. Rumor has it that he was only eligible to become the prime disciple because he found the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect’s Ancient Order.”

There were a few sects close to the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect and discovered some information regarding Li Qiye.

Hearing this caused many people to glance at each other. He was a disciple with only a Mortal Physique and Mortal Fate yet he was still being so arrogant, was he tired of living?

“The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect truly has no talents. This type of disciple is considered a treasure?”

Seeing Li Shuangyan next to Li Qiye caused the hearts of many to be uncomfortable, especially the younger ones.

“The Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect only values him because he has the backing of the Nine Saint Demon Gate.”

As a Royal Noble of the Heavenly Jewel Kingdom, Marquis of Primordial Origins somewhat knew the inside story, and he said:

“It is said that the Progenitor of the Nine Saint Demon Gate established an ancestral rule: if the prime disciple of the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was male and the descendant of the Nine Saint Demon Gate was female, then the descendant would have to marry the prime disciple so that the two sects would be in-laws.”

“Isn’t this a bouquet of flowers stuck into a pile of cow manure?”

A few young ones that heard this news became indignant and felt injustice for Li Shuangyan:

“Goddess Li’s beauty is peerless. She is also the grand beauty of our Grand Middle Territory. Rumor has it that she has a Saint Fate Palace along with a peerless aptitude. She’s definitely a young genius...”

“For an amazing character like Goddess Li, even throughout the whole Grand Middle Territory, there are only so few people who could be a good match for her. There was a talent from Old Ox Country who proposed a marriage to the Nine Saint Demon Gate, but he was refused. And now, such a peerless character like Goddess Li is betrothed to a bag of straw? This is so unfair!”

The young cultivators gritted their teeth in an indignant and infuriated manner. It was as if everyone in the world was displeased with this matter.

“That’s right, it’s so unfortunate for Goddess Li. A character like her shouldn’t be in this situation.”

At the Grand Middle Territory, countless people adored Li Shuangyan. In the hearts of countless cultivators, Li Shuangyan was their goddess. Today, she was betrothed to such a bag of straws. How could they not be feeling indignant?

In a short amount of time, many angry glares, that were seemingly capable of killing him, fell upon Li Qiye. Li Qiye’s great fortune caused others to be hateful.

“It turns out to be a loser that is only relying on a woman to be arrogant.”

A genius like Marquis of the Eastern River also contemptuously glared at Li Qiye. Li Qiye — this type of person, he is not worthy to be Marquis of the Eastern River’s opponent.

The moment Li Qiye returned his hands, he looked at the battlefield and saw that Gu Tieshou and Marquis of Suppressive Might were unable to determine a victor; he shook his head and said:

“Elder Gu, the Kun Peng’s Six Variants does not rely on its offensive power but its space traversing property. You still don’t understand its profound principles so you cannot exert its true power! For the Kun Peng’s Six Variants, power isn’t important; the importance lies in its ability to escape the confinements of space. Gather the power of space, then naturally release it.”

Gu Tieshou, using the Kun Peng’s Six Variants, was powerful and continuously broke the offense of Marquis of Suppressive Might, but the True Treasure of Marquis of Suppressive Might was not just for show; his attack was relentless and became increasingly murderous.

Li Qiye’s words moved Gu Tieshou! A Fate merit law was not only the foundation of the Dao, but it was also a technique to protect the Fate Palace and punish one’s enemies. Therefore, Gu Tieshou didn’t even need a Life Treasure and directly used the Kun Peng’s Six Variants to — once again — suppress Marquis of Suppressive Might. Moreover, he became more comfortable as the battle went on. Gu Tieshou felt a bit proud; before, he could only hide his strength and couldn’t battle and kill. He definitely couldn’t meet an opponent at the same level. However, now, he was using the Kun Peng’s Six Variants so meticulously that it caused Gu Tieshou to feel extremely satisfied.

Now, Gu Tieshou’s heart was shaken. Until a moment ago, he had only used the Kun Peng’s Six Variants for two purposes. The first was to cultivate his Dao foundation and refine his True Fate while the second was to punish the enemies and protect his body. At this moment, Li Qiye’s words broke through his limited understanding.

“Roll!”

The phrase woke up someone from his dream. Gu Tieshou roared and the Kun Peng landed at the top of his head. At this moment, the Kun Peng was only as big as a fist. It swung its tail at an extremely alarming pace, and there was an immediate feeling of space and power that began to pile up a thousand times.

Within a flash of light, Gu Tieshou released a punch. This was the “Black Tiger Crawling Heart”, the most ordinary technique in the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect! However, this punch carried along the thousand rhythms from the Kun Peng and a power of the endless Grand Dao. This punch looked like an ordinary punch, but the blood energy’s future waves encompassed the other older waves and cascaded into many layers. With his Life Wheel rolling, it flooded out like an entire sea of blood.

“Bang — Bang — Bang–”

In a flash, the space under this one punch cracked like a mirror and finally, a “Boom” sound emerged. The punch heavily struck the treasure pagoda of Marquis of Suppressive Might.

Marquis of Suppressive Might’s treasure pagoda was a True Treasure. At this moment, it risked its life to borrow the world’s energy. The world’s energy turned into a spring as it was channeled into the pagoda, but it was not enough to block this one punch. This one punch knocked the treasure pagoda — along with Marquis of Suppressive Might — more than one thousand miles away.

“Bang — Bang — Bang”

The remaining aftershock of the punch slammed the ground and a few mountains were shattered into dust.

Under the power of this punch, many people lost their colors. The ones with shallow cultivation shivered in fear and their legs went weak.

“This is the true power of an Emperor’s merit law!”

Seeing this one punch collapse the world, the Turtle Monarch from the Flying Dragon Lake became pale.

This was an incomprehensible matter — using one fist to blow away a Life Treasure. However, Gu Tieshou was able to do it! Emperor merit laws were truly frightening. It was no wonder why Immortal Emperors could shoulder the Heaven’s Will.

Gu Tieshou couldn’t calm his excitement right now. He finally understood the profound principles of this Emperor merit law. Even though Li Qiye had instructed him before, he always viewed the Kun Peng’s Six Variants as a killing technique! It seemed like he, in the past, couldn’t utilize the true power of the merit law that was created by the Patriarch.

“Kill!”

At this time, Marquis of Suppressive Might jumped and screamed. He didn’t have any noticeable injuries because he had his own True Treasure to protect his body. At this moment, he no longer used his treasure pagoda. From his roar came a godly saber, slashing straight forward across one thousand miles. It cut through the mountains and rivers. This blade carried the presence of an Ancient Saint. It was as if an Ancient Saint’s long arms had maneuvered to conduct this one-hit kill.

“An Ancient Saint Life Treasure!”

A cultivator surprisingly exclaimed as he saw this blade cross the sky,. The presence of an Ancient Saint caused others to be in a daze.

“Earth Transformation –”

Gu Tieshou loudly screamed. Suddenly, his whole body felt as if it was carrying a heavy weight while the rolling blood energy became condensed. The waves of blood became increasingly impactful with monstrous power. At this moment, Gu Tieshou still only punched once, and it was still the “Black Tiger Crawling Heart” fist, but it carried the condensed power of the earth. It was no longer a regular punch from Gu Tieshou.

“Clank–”

Something impossible to imagine happened. Gu Tieshou used this fist to knock away the Ancient Saint’s saber — this was enough to determine who was superior.

“Heaven Transformation –”

After releasing this fist, Gu Tieshou’s speed suddenly exceeded one’s imaginations. He instantly drew near Marquis of Suppressive Might and used the most common fist to collapse Marquis of Suppressive Might’s chest.

The “snapping” sound of broken bones resounded. Blood gushed out, like a spring, from Marquis of Suppressive Might’s mouth as he was knocked far away again. This time, he was truly wounded, and it was not a light injury.

Injuring the enemy made Gu Tieshou ecstatic. Before, when he fought against another Royal Noble, he was at a huge disadvantage under the Ancient Saint’s formation. However, at the moment, he could injure Marquis of Suppressive Might who carried a Life Treasure. This made him understand that this was the true power of the Emperor merit law.

The “Kun Peng’s Six Variants” — Heaven Transformation, Earth Transformation, Dark Space Transformation, Tsunami Transformation, Sea Transformation, Galaxy Transformation! Gu Tieshou finally understood that the Kun Peng’s Six Variants was not just a simple technique.

“Now this is the ‘Kun Peng’s Six Variants’. Otherwise, it would be too unworthy of the effort Immortal Emperor Min Ren put in to create this law.”

Li Qiye watched Gu Tieshou’s moment of enlightenment and nodded his head approvingly. One has to know that the Kun Peng’s Six Variants was the strongest Emperor merit law from Immortal Emperor Min Ren! In order to create this merit law that year, under the Dark Crow’s instruction, Little Brat Min Ren took a great risk to observe a Kun Peng!

This scene shook everyone’s gazes. Marquis of the Eastern River’s eyes became serious and was filled with a cold and frightening sensation. At this moment, the Kun Peng’s Six Variants was too tempting for him! If he could steal the Kun Peng’s Six Variants and successfully cultivate it, he could look down on the entire contemporary younger generation!

“It is time to finish this!”

Marquis of Suppressive Might vomited blood from anger and crazily screamed. At this moment, he spit out a godly umbrella. The moment this godly umbrella came out, there was an immediate sound of ghosts wailing and gods screaming. The sky even started to pour a rain of blood!

“The family heirloom of Marquis of Suppressive Might, the Heavenly Sovereign Blood Umbrella!” Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

Seeing this godly umbrella open, countless people were left aghast. This was a Heavenly Sovereign True Treasure, ah! A Heavenly’s Will True Treasure! It was very terrifying; even a small drop of blood from this rain was enough to refine an Enlightened Being.

“The one who will be finished is you!”

Seeing the opponent bring out a Heavenly Sovereign True Treasure, Gu Tieshou’s expression sank. At this moment, Gu Tieshou took out his weapon. A “Boom” rang out and the moment this one weapon came to being... If the enemies continued to exist, then I will no longer exist![1. This last phrase was hard. Basically when this weapon comes out, unless the enemy is dead, the user would be dead – basically it is an extremely murderous weapon]

At this moment, weaker cultivators bellowed without stop with their legs weak as they directly fell to the ground!

“A Virtuous Paragon Life Treasure!”

Seeing this one weapon coming down from the heavens, the expressions of Marquis of Primordial Origins’s group greatly changed and bursted into horror.

A Virtuous Paragon Life Treasure! Even though a True Treasure was far stronger than a Life Treasure, a Virtuous Paragon was much stronger than a Heavenly Sovereign! The moment this one weapon struck down, a deafening “Bang” filled the air. Marquis of Suppressive Might, along with his umbrella, was knocked flying away as his blood flowed like the rain; the sound of bones shattering continuously resounded.
