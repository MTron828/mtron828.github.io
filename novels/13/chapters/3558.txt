Chapter 3559: Roasting

Another student added: “Just a broken temple. We can smash it down and still shouldn’t pay more than a few coins!”

Other students thought so too. The majority came from nobility and powerful clans. This temple was worth nothing in their eyes, the same with someone like Li Qiye. His cultivation was nothing more than child’s play.

To put it bluntly, it was his honor to have them visit his humble abode - a blessing from the ancestors. Finndd the new𝒆st 𝒏ovels on n/𝒐/velbin(.)com

“Smash the temple?” Li Qiye couldn’t help but smile while looking at the guy.

“And what if we do?” Zhang Yu loudly said. Even the watersplitter beast beneath him routed and raised its claws, ready to show its might.

He was annoyed with Li Qiye early and now, he was ready to show it after seeing the support of his peers.

He gazed down at Li Qiye while sitting on top of his beast: “Tell me, how much is this temple worth? I will personally break it right now then pay you.”

He came from a rich family and performed well at the academy. He might not be superior compared to his peers but as for a nobody like Li Qiye from the mortal world? He naturally didn’t give a damn.

Xiao Ling’s group of three didn’t like this negative development. However, they were in a tough position since Li Qiye’s attitude enraged their friends.

Li Qiye put down the timber pieces on his shoulders. The students sneered after seeing this. What was this mortal going to do to them?

“Attendant, I am hungry. Go make food with that beast.” Li Qiye pointed at the watersplitter beast before sitting down beneath a big tree.

“You think you’re qualified to say something like that? My mount is a treasure beast...” Zhang Yu snorted right away and laughed.

“He doesn’t know his limit. The watersplitter beast has immense strength. Just one stomp is enough to crush them to a pulp yet they want to kill it?” One student sneered.

“Let him come, Zhang Yu, let’s see if he has the ability to do so.” Another laughed.

Zhang Yu stared at the old attendant and said: “Come if you’re not afraid of death. Don’t blame me if my mount crushes you...”

Even the mount started roaring haughtily. The students thought that Li Qiye and his old servant were suicidal.

However, the old man didn’t mind at all. He spread his palm before Zhang Yu could finish speaking, knocking the youth off his mouth.

“Ooo-” His saber pierced the beast’s heart before Zhang Yu could get up. It didn’t have a chance to resist.

Everything happened so quickly before anyone could react. The old man then dragged the beast away, leaving a long bloody trail on the ground.

“Young Master, how should I cook it?” He asked.

“Roast it, I’m in the mood for that.” Li Qiye answered while enjoying the shade.

Zhang Yu regained his wits and was furious. He spent a large sum to buy this mount but these two wanted to eat it now?

“Little animal, I’ll make mincemeat out of you!” He roared and unsheathed his divine sword.

“Clank!” A murderous energy pulsed from the blade.

“Enough!” Xiao Ling saw that Zhang Yu actually wanted to kill Li Qiye so she shouted: “This ends here. We are guests in this place!”

“But he killed my mount!” Zhang Yu didn’t accept the mediation and still glared at Li Qiye.

“I’ll just get you another. It’s inappropriate for us to be so loud at someone else’s home.” Xiao Ling spoke while staring at Li Qiye.

“That’s it?” Zhang Yu still wanted to put an end to Li Qiye.

“You’re dissatisfied? I’ll get you a golden-eyed watersplitter beast then.” Xiao Ling glared at the youth.

“That’s not what I meant, you don’t have to be the one...” Zhang Yu became soft after seeing her aggressive eyes.

“Forget about it if Princess Ling is giving you a better mount.” A female friend told him.

“I guess so.” Zhang Yu had no choice but to swallow this anger.

“Princess Ling is too nice.” An older student shook his head. He thought that this wouldn’t have ended here if it was his mount being killed.

“This is her way of repaying him for letting her stay the night.” Another nodded and said.

As they were talking among themselves, an aroma of roasted meat permeated the area.

The old attendant had prepared the beast and placed its entire head on a roasting rack. The thing became golden with tantalizing fatty drips.

People couldn’t help looking at the big chunk of meat. Some even salivated. They have all forgotten that this used to be Zhang Yu’s mount.

Fat and oil let out pleasant pops. The old man was certainly a first-rate cook. After he added the spices, the aroma became unbearable. Zhang Yu himself forgot about his mount and started salivating.

“That smells wonderful.” One student said while gulping loudly: “This feels like we’ve been starving for days.”

The others felt their stomach rumbling after hearing this. Alas, no one dared to say anything.

The dog and boar ran over too after smelling the aroma. They circled around the meat and growled, ready to eat.

“Amitabha.” A Buddhist chant came out of nowhere.

People suddenly saw a young monk standing before the meat as well. He looked around fifteen years of age and wore a kasaya. He was handsome and exuded spirituality as if he was gestated by ten great mountains or that he was a source of Buddhism.

However, upon careful examination, his kasaya was dirty and stained with oil, especially in the chest area. The place was shiny - this made people think that the monk has been sneaking in meat and wiping it on his kasaya.

He held a Buddhist bowl with a golden radiance, brimming with Buddhist affinity. It was clearly a great treasure.

“Amitabha.” He bowed towards the old man and placed his palms together: “Sir, will you be benevolent for a karmic deed, I haven’t eaten in three days...”

He then raised his bowl forward to ask for a piece of meat.

“Scram.” The old man uttered coldly without looking at him.

He awkwardly pulled his bowl back while still fixated on the meat. He swallowed his saliva and continued begging: “Sir, I, I just need a tiny piece...”

The old man still ignored him.

“He’s... he’s Golden Cicada Buddhist Child...” The students saw him and became startled.

“You’re right, from Golden Dragon Temple.” Others recognized him.

“Buddhist Child.” The students bowed towards him regardless of how proud they were.

“Don’t be so polite now.” The young monk bowed towards them back to return the gesture. However, his eyes were still on the meat.
