Chapter 185 : Old Ghost (1)

This genius taught this method to other powerful cultivators. After these powerful cultivators practiced this method, they found that their power significantly increased. However, they did not know that they inadvertently became the cauldrons for this genius.

When the time was right, and when the cauldrons became powerful enough, that would be when the genius harvested. He would lead these cauldrons step by step to absorb the Extreme Sun True Flame and deliberately let them refine the Extreme Sun True Flame into their True Fire of Life!

At that time, the endless Extreme Sun True Flame would burn these cauldrons into ashes. After it incinerated all of the cultivation and Cauldron of Life of these cultivators, they would turn into True Flame’s Law!

After cauldrons were burnt to ashes, this genius would absorb the True Flame’s Law and refine it to empower his evil offensive technique. The more he absorbed, the more powerful his technique became. It could even be considered invincible!

In that era, Li Qiye — as the Dark Crow — ordered people to kill this genius and seized the evil technique that was called the Nine Sun Annihilating God Law. At that time, Li Qiye wanted to destroy this evil technique.

However, after reaching this eldritch technique, he couldn’t help but to praise this unfathomable genius. He was able to create such a peerlessly profound offensive technique like this. At that time, he felt that destroying this evil technique was a complete waste. Li Qiye then spent countless amounts of effort and even studied it with Immortal Emperors in order to finally improve this evil technique, turning it into a supreme offensive technique — an invincible offensive technique.

Later on, he named this offensive technique the “Nine Sun Locking Heaven Law!” After he trained Immortal Emperor Min Ren, he also taught him this law. Immortal Emperor Min Ren used this law to sweep through the nine heavens and ten earths with unstoppable momentum!

Regrettably, later on, the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect for unknown reasons lost the complete version. Thirty thousand years ago, the sect lost this supreme manual after the great calamity. As for how the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom obtained it, no outsiders knew.

In fact, after the Ancient Kingdom seized this method, they always researched it. Many talented experts of the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom had always tested this supreme technique, but they always felt that it was missing something, that it was incomplete with a big flaw.

When the Ancient Kingdom gave this technique to Leng Chengfeng, in reality, it was only just another test.

Leng Chengfeng assumed that he was practicing the supreme method, and after hearing Li Qiye’s words, he assumed that it was the way to increase his battle power. However, he didn’t know that once he activated this method, he would immediately turn into a cauldron!

Li Qiye’s acting was too real, so Leng Chengfeng fell into his trap. He actually thought that he found the missing component of the supreme technique, only to be burnt to death along with Lei She, who tried to rescue him!

The Extreme Sun True Flame was too powerful. Leng Chengfeng and Lei She didn’t have time to think before being incinerated into ashes.

Inadvertently, they did Li Qiye a favor, allowing him to obtain the True Flame’s Law that turned into the large lock, and it also made him find the erased memory of the Nine Sun Locking Heaven Law. At this moment, Li Qiye obtained the completed version!

At this point, the whole courtyard was in complete silence. Even Elder Yun was shivering in fear. Luckily, his master stopped him; otherwise, his fate would have been the same as Elder Lei She. Gét latest 𝒏ovel ch𝒂pters on n𝒐v(e)lbj/n(.)c/𝒐m

However, Li Shuangyan and Chen Baojiao saw the events from beginning to end couldn’t help but take a deep breath. From start to finish, Li Qiye didn’t even make a move, but Leng Chengfeng, who challenged him, was dead. Even Lei She died. Moreover, they didn’t even know what was going on at the moment of their deaths!

Chen Baojiao now understood why Li Shuangyan pulled her back. Since the start, their young noble was only acting, and Leng Chengfeng had early fallen into their young noble’s scheme. It seems like at this moment, she didn’t understand the young noble as well as Li Shuangyan ah.

At this time, Li Qiye took a deep breath and looked at the master and disciple pair of Chi Yun standing to the side, revealing his snow white teeth as he spoke: “Elder Chi, wrongfully cultivating another sect’s merit law — this is a dangerous matter. Someone might accidentally burn from playing with fire. Wouldn’t you say so, Elder Chi?”

The two master and disciple couldn’t help but feel a bit creeped out. From beginning to end, Li Qiye didn’t even lift his finger yet Leng Chengfeng and Lei She were burnt to ashes. They both felt that this fifteen year old little demon in front of them was an evil ghost sharpening its white fangs. One wouldn’t know how and when they would die by being his enemy.

At this point, Chi Yun gently sighed and understood why His Highness valued Li Qiye so highly. This was not simply because Li Qiye could control their Heavenly Protectors. In a few days, he suppressed Wan Shengjian and Dao Child Shengtian. At this moment, he burnt Lei She and Leng Chengfeng to death. It seemed like such an easy matter to this young man ahead. Enlightened Beings, Ancient Saints — all would have a miserable fate if they provoked him!

Li Qiye smiled and smiled some more as he then took Li Shuangyan and Chen Baojiao inside. Chi Yun then looked at the two piles of ashes on the ground and gently sighed in lamentation.

“Our Nine Saint Demon Gate lost one Supreme Elder and a genius disciple with a bright future.” Seeing the ashes on the ground, Elder Yun said with pity.

Chi Yun shook his head and replied: “This isn’t necessarily a bad thing. Even though we suffered a heavy loss, but at least we avoided infighting. Our Nine Saint Demon Gate chose the War God Temple’s camp, not the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom. The first branch of Elder Lei was too close with the Ancient Kingdom! Eventually, they would be a disaster! Now, Elder Lei and Leng Chengfeng have died; their first branch’s power suffered heavily. Even if they want to join the Ancient Kingdom, they wouldn’t amount to anything!”

Elder Yun became silent from this, but he couldn’t deny that his master made a lot of sense. The Nine Saint Demon Gate and the War God Temple had a relationship that spanned for millions of years till now. The Nine Saint Demon Gate had some geniuses who entered the War God Temple. This was why the War God Temple greatly supported them.

However, Lei She’s first branch wanted to rise and they chose the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom. They hoped that, with its support, they would be able to control the Nine Saint Demon Gate in the future! Such infighting was not something the elders of the Nine Saint Demon Gate were willing to see. Killing each other would greatly harm the gate and sap its power.

At the moment, the Nine Saint Demon Gate didn’t lose a single soldier while Lei She and Leng Chengfeng suffered miserable deaths. This, without a doubt, would deter the people of Lei She’s first branch from wanting to join the Ancient Kingdom.

After returning to the room, Li Qiye asked Li Shuangyan: “Did the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom participate in attacking the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect that year?”

Li Shuangyan shook her head and replied: “I don’t know the exact details, but I’ve heard my master say that they did not have a direct presence. He said that even though the Nine Saint Demon Gate wanted to help the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect, the Space Trample Mountain had someone who was secretly controlling the grand scheme, making us powerless. The Space Trample Mountain did not directly show itself, but the war itself had implications with the Space Trample Mountain. My master later on guessed that the Immortal Emperor’s lineages involved in this war were more than just one.”

Li Qiye gently nodded while listening to this. An insect losing its one hundred feet was still hard to kill. Even if the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect was not as strong as before, in the end, it was still an Immortal Emperor’s lineage that stood strong for millions of years without falling. Even if the Heavenly God Sect was rising, it wouldn’t necessarily have been able to defeat the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect. After all, the sect’s strength was still all there.

Of course, towards the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect — such a delicious fattened piece of meat, many lineages were willing to share. The Heavenly God Sect wouldn’t have been able to swallow the Cleansing Incense Ancient Sect without the help of other Immortal Emperor’s lineages, these monstrous existences.

“Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom!” Li Qiye narrowed his eyes. The Ancient Kingdom obtaining the Nine Sun Locking Heaven Law was not a coincidence. Even if they didn’t directly participate that year, they couldn’t escape from some involvements.

Li Shuangyan’s mind was a bit shocked. Other people would lose their colors talking about the Azure Mysterious Ancient Kingdom, but their young noble was different. He seemed to not put the Ancient Kingdom in his thoughts.

At this moment, Li Qiye smiled and contemplated for a moment. Then he wrote down a list and gave it to Li Shuangyan, saying: “You tell people to go buy all of these things, I need them. The sooner the better.”

Li Shuangyan looked at the list and was very much perplexed while staring at Li Qiye. Outside of a bunch of spirit medicines, there were other strange things like burial clothing... Looking down further on the list, other people that were unsure of the circumstances would think that he was preparing for a funeral.

“Ah, what are you trying to do?” Li Shuangyan looked at this nondescript list and confusedly asked.

Li Qiye smiled and leisurely said with squinted eyes: “We are going into the Ancient Heavenly Corpse Burial Ground to honor.”

“Honor?” Chen Baojiao was in a daze, then she asked: “Young Noble has an ancestor buried in the burial ground?”

“You will find out at that time.” Li Qiye said mysteriously.

Met by Li Qiye’s secrecy, Li Shuangyan didn’t ask and immediately ordered people to go buy everything on the list.

As he was waiting for her to buy everything, he used this leisure time to make the most out of his cultivation. To him, the foundation should be a gradual process, but his Physique was different. His Physique dictated an intensified effort and speed. He had his own plan and his ambition did not simply end at the Hell Suppressing Godly Physique. He also required other Physiques.

If other people knew Li Qiye’s thoughts, they would call him crazy or foolish! The reason was simple, any cultivator could only have one Physique! To cultivators, the Inner Physique determined which types of Physiques they will have.

And the Inner Physique was unique, just like the True Fate, Life Wheel, and Fate Palace.
