Chapter 4372: One Swing

Li Qiye seemed amused after being challenged by Sky Eagle. He joined the fray and borrowed Wang Weiqiao’s hatchet before smiling: “One swing to send all of you to the afterlife.”

“One swing?!” The crowd clamored right away, especially those supporting Sky Eagle.

“Fool, don’t you know our senior brother has the bloodline of the divine eagle, a branch with incredible defensive potential!” One of them shouted.

“Just wait, Senior Brother’s feather rain will pierce his heart soon enough, he won’t be able to have time for regret before being minced to pieces.” One more joined in.

“Kill him, Senior Brother!” The egging continued.

“Don’t do it so quickly now, take your time teaching him the might of our sect and the consequences of his impudence.” Someone else sneered.

“So noisy, shut your mouth or I’ll cut off your dog head.” Li Qiye looked around and threatened.

This infuriated the crowd and prompted them to become louder.

“We should destroy your sect too, brat!” The first shouted.

“That’s too merciful, it has to be clan extermination!” The second roared.

“Li, I will kill you right now! No need for Senior Brother to waste his time!” The third stepped forward.

“Enough.” Li Qiye’s eyes turned cold as he swung the hatchet.

“Buzz.” A bright glint from the blade flashed and the shouters had an idea what was going on.

In the next second, heads were tossed into the air and they could see their own headless body. Blood gushed out from the severed neck like blossoming flowers and eventually, their body fell to the ground. DiisCoover 𝒖pdated novels on n(o)v./e/lbin(.)co𝒎

They wanted to scream but no sound would come out regardless of their effort. The heads smashed the ground and rolled everywhere. They only saw Li Qiye swinging the hatchet before death.

Nonetheless, the consolation was that they didn’t feel any pain, only a brief moment of fear and helplessness.

The swing took down a dozen shouters or so and caught everyone off guard.

“You dare?!” Sky Eagle roared in that split second but it was too late.

“Your turn.” Alas, he didn’t have time to think because Li Qiye’s second swing was aimed at him.

His eyes became wide open and managed to react since he was ready on top of being more powerful than those disciples earlier.

“Activate!” Loud metallic clanks resonated as he spread his pair of wings. The feathers turned into bright swords and created an impregnable fortress around him.

“Screech!” The image of a divine eagle appeared above Sky Eagle. It poured down runes and sealed the area around him, also boosting the cultivator in the process.

He was indeed impressive and talented, only inferior to geniuses such as their young lord and Jian Qingzhu.

He chose to be defensive because he felt threatened. He used his strongest defensive laws in order to stop the swing.

“Bam!” The swing finally came, looking as normal as can be versus the flashy defense. There was no aura, divinity, and shifting variations.

Spectators actually questioned its potential. Alas, once it hit the target, the entire area shook.

“This is bad!” A senior watching from a distance blurted out.

“Stop!” A great demon became startled and flew over to help. Alas, it was too late.

The seemingly weak swing carried enough power to split the earth.

“Ooo-” The divine eagle bellowed and was reduced into the nothingness. The swing then struck the wall of swords and easily eradicated it.

“Nooo!” Sky Eagle bellowed in horror, wanting to turn and run but it was too late. The blade of the hatchet split him into two halves. His organs fell into a pile on the ground next to the two pieces.

He believed that no one in the same generation could break his defense with one move. It was no problem for him to survive a duel.

Unfortunately, this sect master cut his defense down as if they were tofu. Nonetheless, he performed better than his fellow members earlier. At least he had the chance to resist despite being oblivious to the outcome.

The members of Phoenix Ground couldn’t believe their own eyes. Their senior brother was certainly a genius and not that many youths were stronger than him. Alas, this sect master killed him and the others so easily.
