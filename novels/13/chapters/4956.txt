Chapter 4957: Courting Death

“This has nothing to do with the bet, we are merely trying to get back our stolen treasure, please mind your conduct, Princess.” The young monarch glared at Li Qiye and Ming Shi.

“I thought we have made it clear that Benevolence does not belong to Deity or The Race. Does Deity think it is strong enough to run rampant in the lower three continents? This is a blatant robbery attempt.” Ming Shi said.

“She’s right!” Students from The People agreed and voiced their support.

“Deity is out of line right now, Bai Shaojin was lucky enough to find it and if he wants to give it to the academy, it will belong to the academy.” Another shouted.

“Every treasure or ore in Deity belongs to Deity, and Benevolence was found in our territory.” Swordgrasp uttered coldly: “Don’t you want the same for your mines and treasures?”

No one could retort this logic. Their lineages had massive territories as well. The ore veins and natural resources naturally belonged to the respective powers. Trying to steal or rob them of such could result in a war.

“Natural resources are different. They are bestowed by the heaven to the land.” Bai Shaojin said: “But Benevolence is a man-made item and has nothing to do with Deity.”

“That’s true, don’t be shoving false arguments down our throats!” One student shouted back.

“What’s happening here is only serving to lower Deity’s reputation and prestige.” Many students from The People sided with Bai Shaojin.

The shouting put the trio in a tough position.

“It’s impossible to determine right from wrong in just a short time. The best way to do this is for you to hand Benevolence over and wait for a fair trial.” Halo shouted back.Expplôre 𝒖ptod𝒂te stories at no/𝒗el//bin(.)c𝒐m

They wanted to prevent Bai Shaojin from giving Benevolence away at all costs since everything would be over then.

“Give it here!” The young monarch increased his dragon lord aura.

Li Qiye waved his hand as if he was chasing a fly away and said: “The three of you must be tired of living today.”

Halo and Swordgrasp also moved forward, surrounding both Li Qiye and Bai Shaojin.

“This has nothing to do with our feud. If you want to continue our bet, wait until this is finished.” Swordgrasp said.

“I’m afraid my patience is limited and I’ve grown tired of you three little flies. Your best option now is to commit suicide for a swift and easy death. If I have to do it myself, it won’t be as pleasant.” Li Qiye said with a smile.

“Don’t you know who we are?!” Halo shouted back, unable to maintain his bearing as a young lord: “Don’t think so highly of yourself! Know when to back off when given the opportunity! Infuriate us and we will kill you!”

He no longer gave a damn about putting up an appearance and wanted to speak with his fist. After all, they believed that they could kill an unknown cultivator like Li Qiye without any problem.

“Just three little flies with a little golden hue thinking that they are better than other flies.” Li Qiye answered.

“Hahaha, well said.” The princess laughed.

This comment offended the three geniuses and their lineages. Halo was the young lord of Heaven Burial; Swordgrasp was his school’s successor, and the young monarch was a dragon lord. To the crowd, it appeared that Li Qiye was suicidal.

“This is rather unwise even if he is in the right.” One student commented.

Li Qiye had won already but the more he insulted them, the more reason they had to renege on the bet or even kill him.

“You’re asking for it.” Halo’s light pulsed outward, capable of reducing Li Qiye to mincemeat.

“Unfortunately, you’re too weak to even deal with one finger of mine.” Li Qiye said.

“You!” Halo has been livid the entire time.

Students were astounded after listening. Goldcrest who was standing nearby wanted to tell Li Qiye to not be so extreme or there would be no going back.

“He’s done for sure.” Some students said, believing that he was utterly outmatched.

“You all come at once, I have other businesses to take care of afterward so let’s make this fast.” Li Qiye said.

“Don’t regret your words now.” Swordgrasp smiled deviously.

He didn’t care about the process. The most important thing was to kill Li Qiye because carrying out the bet would be humiliating.

“It’s fine, it’s just swatting some flies to me.” Li Qiye waved dismissively.

“I see, I see…” The young monarch maintained his cool despite being furious. He believed that he was superior to all students thus he had to maintain a dignified appearance.

Alas, this was too much to handle. He laughed from being too angry and said: “Hahaha, I’ve never met anyone like you before. Let’s see what you can do…”

“You won’t see much since this will be effortless on my part.” Li Qiye interrupted him.

His expression became ugly as he said menacingly: “Brat, take out your weapon. I will show you the fate of those daring to challenge a dragon lord.”

“We will give you a chance to attack first, ready your weapon.” Halo said.

“Hmm, I initially only wanted to use one finger but if you insist, I suppose I have to grab one.” Li Qiye smiled.
