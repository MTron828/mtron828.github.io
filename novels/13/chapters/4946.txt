Chapter 4947: Once Known As King

Where the old man stood was an insurmountable divide. Not even a four-fruit dragon lord could get through. The draconic inferno was being controlled by the movement of his broom.

The dragon lords were astounded to see this, narrowing their eyes. They couldn’t have dealt with Maddened God this easily. Using a broom to do so was unthinkable.

Regular students, even those talented and experienced like Bloodsea, were unaware of his amazing abilities. Maddened God continued to rage, causing the inferno to engulf the academy, but the old man easily extinguished it with a swing of his broom. The inferno seemed as feeble as a candle flickering in the wind.

Maddened God staggered backward; his face turned red as he felt his energy becoming unstable.

“Too strong.” Arrow Saint thought that this old man’s strength was far above theirs.

The schoolmaster who has been here for a long time was not privy to this information either.

“May we have your name, Senior?” The domineering Stone Lion God asked humbly with a cupped fist.

He and his allies couldn’t help looking up at the vast radiance deep in the academy afterward. Everyone recalled a particular legend - a supreme being protecting this place in the past.

Celestial Court demanded its submission and sent ancient emperors here. Alas, they were swiftly slain by this mysterious being.

Could he be the one? If so, all the dragon lords here weren’t worth mentioning in his presence.

The schoolmaster knew that this wasn’t the case. Thus, he held his breath and waited patiently for an answer.

He slowly raised his head and looked at the dragon lords before answering: “The years have gone by and I no longer remember my name. I do recall that during my youth, people called me King.”

His voice was pleasant like the warm sun melting the snow away. Li Qiye who has been quietly watching in the distance smiled.

As for the others, they didn’t know what to say. King during his youth?Upstodatee from n(0)/v𝒆/lbIn/.(co/m

This meant that his talent must have been peerless. Moreover, he seemed to be older than conquerors and dragon lords.

A supreme genius living until this age without needing hibernation? He must be extremely powerful.

Nonetheless, this wasn’t enough information to determine his actual origin. The schoolmaster knew the academy’s ancient ancestors quite well but this old man didn’t match anyone on the list.

The academy naturally still had ancient ancestors around but they lived reclusively, rarely showing up to the outside world.

Most importantly, they were prestigious and noble characters. Why was this ancient ancestor choose to stay here and serve as a janitor of sorts? His simple answer made everyone ponder.

“How should we address you then, Senior?” Oblivion Monarch was the oldest one here. He chose to be humble, aware that this old man must be far older than him.

“Sigh, I don’t remember.” The old man let out a sigh. A million years to him was just as long as the sigh just now.

The dragon lords had strange expressions on their face, realizing that all of them combined wouldn’t be able to beat him. On the other hand, how could they give up Benevolence?

“A student from the academy has stolen a peerless treasure from us. We are here to represent Deity in getting it back. Please excuse our transgression but this must be done.” Stone Lion God gritted his teeth, not wanting to give up.

Dragon lords have experienced countless tribulations and dangerous battles before. Moreover, this wasn’t a fight to the death.

“Immemorial Palace’s treasures do not belong to Deity. Since it is no longer around, Benevolence no longer has a master, it has a new owner now, the lucky youth.” The old man said.

The group naturally didn’t agree and thought about how to persuade him to back off.

“Enough of this!” Maddened God couldn’t stand being pushed aside.

He made others tremble, not the other way around. This caused his insanity to surge.

"Old man, I want to see how strong you are. Eat this! Frenzied Eyes!" He shot out fiery beams from his eyes, causing space to melt like molten metal. They were far more concentrated than the inferno earlier, able to refine the dao and turn the world red.
