Chapter 5090: Heaven Burial’s Destruction

Not long ago, the lineage was filled with wondrous powers. The world seemed unable to shoulder its wealth.

Its inhabitants felt tiny in comparison but now, this land reverted to its original state - just another place with mountains and rivers. The fortunes and power of the dao were no longer present…

The kingdoms and sacred grounds floating in the sky would lose their divinity and glows soon enough.

“Just get the hell outta here!” Cultivators and ancestors were still at a loss. Some speculated that they were next to be devoured after the dao powers so they started running for their lives.

The panic caused immense destruction to the existing infrastructure. The more powerful sects and ancient ancestors tried to stop the outward flow using barriers and merit laws.

Alas, this was useless so they dropped butt-first into the ground, bewildered.

“It’s over, it’s over…” The once-dominating ancient ancestors looked like bereaved dogs.

“Heaven Burial is no more.” A pale dragon lord murmured.

Externally, the lineage was still there since the land remained. This applied to the buildings erected by the various sects.

Alas, these non-living entities were useless. The dao foundation and earth veins were essential. As long as they were still around, there was still a chance of rising up again. This applied to a horrific loss of lives after war as well.

But now, they have been taken by someone. With these dao powers gone, cultivation became impossible even for geniuses. This land wasn’t worth a single coin now.

The only solution was to have another supreme conqueror re-create the grand vein and foundation once more. Otherwise, Heaven Burial would fall into oblivion.

This was the case for Deity after it was destroyed by Luminous Conqueror. The two alliances from the upper continents worked together to fix all of this.

Today, Heaven Burial still had its territories and disciples. Unfortunately, their home was no longer suitable for habitation so they had to leave for greener pastures.

It was apparent that Li Qiye was the culprit. No one knew how he performed the absorption process but this was certainly the case.

This was a man who could destroy a dao lineage easily. In fact, in a way, this was more frightening than how Luminous Conqueror did it back then. The latter relied on sheer destruction while Li Qiye left everything intact.

Everyone was trembling in fear now, not wanting to be the next target. Heaven Burial and its ancient ancestors were mighty, not to mention the remnant intent of a top conqueror. All of this was futile so it was best not to antagonize him.

Meanwhile, Li Qiye had finished channeling all of the powers back to the man’s empty spiritual platform.

It was now shiny and looked rather strange. The hole on his head was fixed and replaced by a crystal layer instead of flesh.

“Those motherfuckers! I will annihilate Celestial Court!” He woke up and roared furiously.

“You and what army?” Li Qiye asked jokingly.

“Big Bro, it’s really you, I knew that only you could save me.” After calming down, the man bowed before Li Qiye.

“You’ve grown ambitious, to actually become a conqueror.” Li Qiye accepted the gesture while speaking.ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

“Ah, it’s all thanks to your blessing. You took care of me and made it possible for me to encounter great fortunes. Otherwise, I would have just been an annoyance in the ancestors’ eyes regardless of my effort.” He remained optimistic despite having just gotten out of the horrifying imprisonment.

Although he exuded an unstoppable aura of martial arts, whenever he smiled and spoke, his true personality came out. It gave the impression that he was not an obedient youth.

“Your sister’s fortune was quite something too.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Sigh, she became an Immortal Monarch and always picked on me.” He shrugged and said: “Unfortunately, she couldn’t save me because she herself was barely hanging on during that war. Otherwise, I wouldn’t be in this pathetic state.”

“Who knows, it’s hard to say.” Li Qiye chuckled.

“Fuck, those old bastards from Celestial Court, I will have my revenge.” He gritted his teeth after bringing up the past.

“You are powerless right now.” Li Qiye said.
