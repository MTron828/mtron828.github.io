Chapter 5417: The Selfless One?

Supreme and Swordsea gazed upon the potential opponent, the same for the members of the alliances.

“Brother, what is your stance today?” Swordsea asked.

All-things’ choice was of utmost importance and could decide Illumination’s fate today.

“In my opinion, we should value peace more than anything.” All-things calmly responded: “Everyone should comply with the Pact of Blessed just like before, this is the very foundation for peace.”

“I will retreat if Illumination releases Ye Fantian.” Swordsea said without any hesitation, leaving no room for doubts.

“I shall withdraw with Brother Swordsea.” Supreme said.

It seemed that a strong alliance had been formed between the two alliances - something that was once true in the past.

The relationship between Heaven and Divine had peaks and valleys. They became more distant during Principle Conqueror’s reign. Now, it appeared that the tides had turned.

“It’s over, all that effort for nothing.” A powerful conqueror in the audience sighed and said: “The balance is broken.”

In recent generations, the four alliances maintained a delicate balance, making it easier to adhere to the Pact of Blessed. The balance has been disturbed, causing the other side to potentially react.

“That would be good.” All-things said: “As long as Brother Illumination agrees, everything will return to how it should be.”

“Hahaha!” A boisterous laughter interrupted their conversation.

Illumination showed up inside the grotto with Devil and Riverwalker standing behind him.

“I did not sign the pact so I do not need to comply.” Illumination said.

“But you didn’t oppose it either.” All-things said: “High-ranking members from both sides signed the pact together. You were also invited, Brother, but you didn’t show up, meaning that you implicitly agreed with the pact.”

Listeners didn’t expect to hear this at all, especially those who weren’t qualified to sign the pact. Illumination Conqueror was actually not part of it?

In reality, most had no control over their own fate. The pact was dictated by the top cultivators alone. If they wanted peace, there would be peace. The vice versa applied as well.

A few reflected on the feeling of being an insignificant ant. Cultivators such as Supreme and Illumination never thought twice about others or asked for the world’s opinions.

They were dominant in their own region, never needing to listen to anyone else. Alas, they had no say in this matter.

The Pact of Blessed was imposed on everyone the moment a consensus was reached between the strongest cultivators.

“Heaven Alliance started the conflict so why should I need to adhere to the pact?” Illumination said: “All-things, don’t forget your background, you should be fighting The Race by my side. Otherwise, you are no longer qualified to be the guardian of Dao Alliance.” Illumination said, wanting to retake his position.

In reality, he struck the biggest weakness of All-things who was often criticized for his neutral stance against aggressors.

Heaven and Divine Alliance have shown their desire to team up. Many believed that All-things should also work together with Illumination and Azure School.

Not doing so meant that he had forgotten the purpose of Dao Alliance. Why should he remain as its leader?

Illumination successfully struck the right chord and changed the public’s sentiment.

All-things expected this and answered with sincerity: “As a dao lord standing on the peak, other living beings have no say in my decision. If I were to care about my reputation and claim to have a lofty goal of eradicating The Race, I’d still survive in the case of defeat. But what about everyone else? By starting a war, who will be the first to die?”Gett your 𝒇avorite 𝒏ovels at no/v/e/lb𝒊n(.)com

He paused for a second and continued: “I have massacred enemies and sects to get to this point, my hands are stained with blood. Don’t be fooled that I’m hesitant to start a war out of fear for my personal agenda, it’s just that another war will be nothing more than meaningless bloodshed.”

Silence took over the scene. Even the big shots on Illumination’s side had no response in a short time.

Putting logic aside, All-things was right about one thing - he wouldn’t be the first to die if he exercised caution.

“Mortals shall be the first to perish.” Timewatcher Conqueror appeared out of nowhere and said: “There can only be peace when all top cultivators die.”

Listeners naturally didn’t appreciate being viewed as a scourge upon humanity. Nonetheless, they knew that the truth was not far from it.

“This is why, Brother, you should know that the pact is your only way out, the salvation for both The Race and The People. Let us maintain the balance.” All-things stared at Illumination.

“I disagree.” Illumination responded: “There will be no peace as long as The Race is still around. They started the eternal conflict by initiating Immemorial Epoch War. If we wish to survive, we must eradicate them first and I am willing to die for this cause.”

His declaration stirred his supporters again.
