Chapter 4321: Crossing

“Everything is withering?” The group carefully observed the surroundings and felt something similar akin to the start of autumn.

“Try again, be meticulous.” Li Qiye smiled.

Wang Weiqiao immediately let his mind roam free, sensing every inch of the land and everything above - each blade of leave and the individual grain of sand. 𝑅read latest ch𝒂pters at n/𝒐v(e)lbi𝒏(.)co/m

The others realized that the sect master was teaching Wang Weiqiao. They also did the same thing and copied him.

As they moved forward, they got a better idea of the devastation unleashed upon this place. This prompted Li Qiye to sigh.

During the olden days, the land was fully blessed and empowered. In fact, even the heavenly corpses falling down didn’t affect this place.

The culprit was a dark existence wanting a piece of the pie - the blood and flesh of the living beings in the nine worlds. Thus, the members of Heavenguard remembered their mission and launched an offense against this being.

The ambush was successful but they paid a heavy price - absolute destruction. Nonetheless, they accomplished their mission and fulfilled their promise. The current remnants weren’t enough to tell the world of their sacrifice.

As generations passed, they have forgotten about these heroes. Nevertheless, this wasn’t their goal in the first place. They never cared about their reputation and image - only their creed.

“The dao is a journey of the self, no one else matters.” Li Qiye gently stroked the soil and said.

Once they were near the farthest reach, he asked the group again: “Feel anything yet?”

“No, still nothing.” Elder Hu stopped focusing and smiled wryly.

The youths shook their head as well. They tried to feel the land but couldn’t grasp anything. They certainly sensed some ripples but nothing concrete, unable to catch this ephemeral moment.

“There is something… struggling underground. It seemed to be suppressed or under supervision.” Wang Weiqiao responded.

“You have mediocre talent but remember, persistence can potentially be more useful than peerless aptitude. Most geniuses die an early death.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I understand.” Weiqiao respectfully replied. He knew that his talent was as bad as can be. Nonetheless, he was set on searching for the dao until the very last breath.

“We’re here.” At this time, Li Qiye stopped and looked ahead.

The youths saw that they were very deep into the mountain range now. This place was covered with mist and fog. Dust specks engulfed the sky.

Of course, this wasn’t actually dust but rather tiny spatial fragments. Space still hasn’t fully healed since the calamity.

They finally got close to the broken peaks previously seen from a distance. The broken half filled up the nearby valleys and ravines.

Time had polished the cracking points. Nonetheless, there were still clues of the power necessary to break them all.

The group stood at the base of one peak and in front of them was a ravine. It had accumulated enough water to become a lake. This water was cloudy and even had a touch of black, akin to dried blood.

Instead of the normal refreshing feeling one would get when coming across a lake in the wilderness, this lake emitted a suffocating feeling as if there was something dirty below.

“So there’s a place like this here.” Elder Hu has never gotten this far before. After all, it was considered ominous so few dared to come.

“Do whatever you all want. If it’s meant to be, there will be a harvest. Otherwise, no need to force the issue.” Li Qiye told the youths before sitting down in front of the lake.

Elder Hu didn’t know what he wanted to do but still told the disciples to leave: “Come with me.”

Only Wang Weiqiao remained with Li Qiye.

“Master, what are you doing?” He saw Li Qiye performing a hand seal.

“I’m helping lingering souls find peace since they are worthy.” Li Qiye answered before starting to chant. His mantra echoed in the air.

His goal was to ferry the warriors who died protecting this place. Their soul and intent couldn’t leave since they still wanted to protect the nine worlds after death. They have lingered here for eras now.

This obsession became their prison. They needed someone else to cross them to the other side.

Thus, Li Qiye came in order to grant them eternal rest. He was the only one who could do so. Another priest or monk would find this impossible regardless of their power and technique.

Sure, a true master could purify the souls but that couldn’t be considered saving them. For example, the butterfly monarch was a supreme existence who could forcefully remove these souls from the land. Alas, she knew that only Li Qiye could deliver salvation to these men.

Meanwhile, the ward was rocked by exciting news.

“The young lord is participating this time!” A master from a small sect with a strong information network said.

“Who? The young lord of Dragon?” Listeners became emotional.

“Yes, it’s different this time. I think someone from the capital of Lion’s Roar is coming too.” The master added.

“Could it be…. The behemoths want to emphasize the conference again?” Everyone talked about this topic.

“Do you think anyone else is coming? Maybe someone even stronger?” Another speculated.

“I thought that Deer King and the others would be in charge, I can’t believe that the young lord is coming.” An elder said.

“As far as I know, there is a big shot from Dragon already here at the ward, this conference will be quite something.” One sociable cultivator had access to more information.

“We need to prepare gifts right now.” Numerous sect masters began planning, hoping for a chance to please these big shots.

This was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity. It could change their future and improve their sect’s prospects.
