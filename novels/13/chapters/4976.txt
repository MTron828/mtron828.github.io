Chapter 4977: Curiosity Piqued

Meanwhile, Li Qiye leaped up into the air and grabbed the dark spear, throwing it straight at the fleeing night beast.

It finally let out an audible roar before death, being pinned to the ground by its master’s weapon. It then dispersed into smoke and was blown away by the wind.

Shadowrider initially thought that this was a profitable venture, not expecting to meet such a terrifying cultivator.

Killing a five-fruit dragon lord was easy; there was a high chance of winning against a six-fruit dragon lord as well. Now, the target was completely unscathed.

“Poof!” The decisive Shadowrider performed the same movement technique, dispersing into smoke once more.

Alas, the smoke suddenly came together again to form Shadowrider. Something prevented this escape technique from working properly.

“Poof!” Shadowrider tried once more only to have the same outcome.

Space and time around Shadowrider have been caught by an invisible hand. This became an inescapable prison.

Shadowrider felt as if his target was one with heaven and earth, possessing full control over the various affinities.

This was something surpassing the power of a dao domain, capable of exerting absolute control.

“Clank!” In this moment between life and death, Shadowrider became furious and loud like a Buddha attempting to slay evil demons.

A gigantic Buddhist avatar emerged and roared thunderously. Behind the avatar came thousands of swords imbued with the Buddhist affinity.

They gathered together into a single radiant sword that illuminate the night. Its slash cut through three thousand worlds, all desires and attachments. Everything returned to dust.

The rage of Buddha empowered this attack, resulting in immense destruction and mercilessness. It could split the world but not Li Qiye who caught the blade between two fingers.

This was as risky as can be for Shadowrider. The slash could kill mighty cultivators but lost the stealth factor. This gamble turned out to be the incorrect move.

“Interesting, this seems familiar.” Li Qiye nonchalantly said.

Shadowrider shuddered after seeing this and immediately tried to run again, melding into the night and crossing through the dimensions.

“He’s running!” Yunyun shouted and looked over, only to see Li Qiye still patting his robe to get rid of the dust.

She was overwhelmed with emotion after witnessing true invincibility. She has been with a master standing at the apex all this time but didn’t realize it. Her ignorance and shallow vision left her ashamed.

She had even tried to protect him during their time together, not realizing that it was unnecessary.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

She walked over and got on her knees, wanting to drill a hole into the ground and hide from everyone.

“Stand up, we’re giving chase.” He said.

“Young Noble, why did you let Shadowrider get away?” She got up and asked. It seemed that it was not difficult for Li Qiye to kill Shadowrider in the slightest.

“I’m feeling amused. Normally, when a beast is frightened, the first reaction is to run back to its lair.” He said.

“Do you wish to wipe them out?” Yunyun asked.

“I don’t have that much heroism in me. This is not about getting rid of evil-doers or whatever, I only want to see the lair.” He smiled.

The initial goal was to capture Shadowrider. Alas, after seeing the slash, he became interested because it was familiar. Thus, he wanted to trace it back to the source.

Though Shadowrider has made it to the wilderness far away, it was impossible to truly escape Li Qiye.

Under ordinary circumstances, Shadowrider’s assassination and stealth arts were second to none. Others couldn’t pursue or trace this assassin at all due to a lack of traces.

Unfortunately, Li Qiye had locked the target and distance didn’t matter. Shadowrider could leap out of this world’s cycles and it would still be useless. Only supreme overlords had the ability to hide from Li Qiye’s eyes.

Li Qiye wasn’t in a rush either since he wanted to wait for the assassin to return to the hideout. He took his time with Yunyun accompanying him.

After journeying for some time, they finally arrived at what appeared to be a primeval world. The landscape stretched out before them, vast and boundless, while the air remained pure and untouched. Everywhere she looked, all she could see were rugged mountains and towering trees
