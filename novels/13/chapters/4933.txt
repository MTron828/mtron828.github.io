Chapter 4934: Jinx

He rarely suffered moments like this due to his position as the successor of Swordgrasp.

“Just say that you want to give up if you’re afraid.” Ming Shi has been holding back and this was her time to vent.

Swordgrasp’s blood heated up after hearing the taunt. He stepped forward and said: “I’m not afraid of this nonsensical claim. I’ll do it.”

Having said that, he glared at Li Qiye: “I want to see how much longer you can keep this ridiculous act up. Steal my fortune if you can, hmph.”

He believed that Halo was merely unlucky and the failure had nothing to do with Li Qiye.

“I’m not sure I want to do it since you actually have pretty good luck with this pawnshop.” Li Qiye smiled.

Swordgrasp became braver after hearing this, the same for his allies and supporters.

“Don’t try to play nice, just admit your incapability.” One student sneered.

“Yes, just apologize and admit your mistake. It’ll be too late afterward.” The others started shouting.

Swordgrasp also thought that Li Qiye was afraid so he scoffed: “Bring it, if it’s clear that you were lying, we’ll teach you a lesson.”

His eyes flashed with murderous intent. The only thing holding him back was the academy.

“You are forcing my hand by pointing your blade at me, looks like my kindness is viewed as malice.” Li Qiye waved his hand and said: “I shall seize your fortune so that you will gain nothing.”

The moment he finished speaking, Swordgrasp also had an indiscernible light flashing for a split moment around his body. He sensed something strange but dismissed it since it didn’t last long enough.

“If I get a treasure, I will also take your dog life.” Swordgrasp snorted.

With that, he came over to the carriage and took out an ancient stone covered in celestial runes. Its value was obvious at first glance. Of course, it wasn’t overly precious.

He picked a fair item to exchange because he cared about his image. Plus, this was his only chance so some sincerity had to be shown.

“Start.” The old man opened the sack.

Swordgrasp took a deep breath and reached inside. The crowd became anxious again just like Halo’s attempt.

Those from The Race hoped that he would be able to find something and teach Li Qiye a lesson.

Many of The People wanted him to fail, hoping that he would get his comeuppance for the interrogations recently.

There was a third side - students who wanted to perform a miracle. It would be devilish if Li Qiye wasn’t lying about his fortune-stealing ability. Seeing such a thing in person would make a great story later on. Of course, no one truly believed it.

Time seemed to be passing by awfully slowly. The one under the most pressure was none other than Swordgrasp. He kept on reaching around inside the sack but couldn’t find anything. He felt as if ants were crawling on his body.

“Time’s up.” The old man said after a while.

All eyes were on his hand as he pulled back, looking rather pessimistic.

“There’s nothing!” Students shouted.

“Wow.” The crowd clamored after seeing this.

Could this actually be true then? That would be a horrifying ability. He could just steal his enemies’ luck and condemn them to pitiful life.

“It is impossible!” Some shouted and didn’t buy it.

“It’s just another coincidence.” One student from The Race said: “Few are lucky during these pawnshop events in history. Sometimes, no one got lucky.”

Others agreed with this. The old man had appeared at the academy fairly frequently throughout the eras but those who obtained something great were as rare as leaves during autumn. This was probably just another coincidence.Fị𝒏dd 𝒏ew upd𝒂t𝒆s on n(o)v/e/l𝒃in(.)com

“We’re not talking about some grand fortune. Most still get something, even weak students. How many come back empty-handed?” Someone from The People disagreed.

This was indeed the truth as well. Most still obtained something from the sack but now, both Halo and Swordgrasp got nothing.

“What kind of sorcery is this? This can’t be real.” Someone didn’t want to believe in this frightening ability.

“Perhaps it is not luck stealing but something on the ominous side.” Another speculated.

“What do you mean, ominous?” His friends asked.

“He’s a jinx that can inflict bad luck by just saying things.” The guy answered.

“That sounds just as unbelievable.” One friend said.

Some stared at Li Qiye and felt creeped out. Mortals believed in misfortunes and avoided talking about certain topics. Cultivators didn’t quite believe this. However, if this was true, then bad things would happen to people around him.

“Giving up yet?” Ming Shi smiled at Swordgrasp.

The latter had an ugly expression but couldn’t retort since he didn’t come up with anything.

“Just another coincidence, that’s all.” Swordgrasp said.

“That’s right.” Halo Scion backed him up.

“I do not believe in sorcery either.” Radiant Young Monarch glared at Li Qiye.

Students immediately stopped talking due to his overwhelming aura. Some became nervous for Li Qiye because nothing good would come from opposing a dragon lord.
