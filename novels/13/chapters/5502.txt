Chapter 5503: Last-minute Attempt

“That’s not right, Young Noble.” The woman seemed happy to continue the conversation: “Would you have been here without fate calling? No, I don’t think you would have taken a second look at our sect.”

“I suppose the world is rather large and I didn’t necessarily need to come here.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“Not only did you visit, you also sat before our ancestors and analyzed our tablet. Our sect might be small but it has beautiful scenery. The temple, venerable it may be, is not a place for sightseeing.” She continued.

“I do like sitting here.” He nodded.

“All of this points to fate, we are connected by fate, hence your presence in our venerable temple.” She continued.

“Sure, let’s call it fate then.” He said.

“Young Noble, I should have been the one to show you ample hospitality but I’m afraid I can’t do so.” She apologized.

“No need for troublesome formalities, I’m just here to take a quick look.” He shook his head.

“I appreciate it, Young Noble.” She bowed politely.

“What are you occupied with?” He asked.

“I am here to pay respect while trying to make a last-minute attempt at something.” She said while glancing at the runes on the tablet.

“Is it important?” He smiled.Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“Yes, Sunset Glow requires a leader and I wish to offer my service.” She propped up her chin with both hands and furrowed her brows.

“It sounds like your rivals are capable.” He speculated.

“My junior sister is exceptional. Our cultivation is about the same but she had traveled outside, so her experience and knowledge surpass mine.” She said.

“Not always the case.” He responded: “As long as you have an open mind, your wisdom grows as well.”

“I certainly hope so.” She giggled and said: “Hearing this lightened my heart.”

“From what I can see, you are rather confident.” He said.

“Not quite, I’m just ready to give my all to Sunset Glow. But first, I must gain the recognition of the immortal artifact.” She said.

“Immortal artifact?” He asked.

“Seems like you don’t know much about our sect, Young Noble.” She blinked mischievously.

“Just a little bit.” He admitted.

She glanced at the central statue and elaborated: “Although Cloudsweep Fairy was not our founder, all of our current foundation and resources were bestowed by her. Anything else from the distant past before her era has gone missing. It was just too long ago.”

The calamity and wars have weakened the sect. Their prior resources from the last epoch were either expended or gone missing.

Although they kept the same name, they didn’t actually have much to do with Sunset Glow Devil Emperor and the other members.

Nonetheless, Cloudsweep Fairy never made an attempt to take over or change the sect’s name. She still honored these ancestors and passed down their tales. Otherwise, future generations of Sunset Glow would have known nothing about their origin.

“I can see that.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Our fairy was unstoppable and had entered Immortal Dao City before.” She continued.

“That is impressive.” He commented while staring at the tablet.

“Young Noble, you do know your stuff.” She said, aware of his focus on the tablet.

“Yes, it is from Immortal Dao City.” He nodded.

“Rumor has it that our fairy entered that place alone in search of someone.” She continued.

“It was not fruitful.” Li Qiye sighed.

She nodded and said: “Right, but the records talk about her being able to enter a special domain in Immortal Dao City, something that couldn’t be done by other monarchs and emperors.”

Immortal Dao City - one of the Nine Heavenly Treasures - descended one day out of nowhere. Immortal Monarch Yi Ye and his allies seized it, turning it into their camp and a fortress for The People.

It naturally contained many secrets. Rumor has it that the leaders managed to enter the deepest crevices of the treasure, able to witness its dao profundities.

“She didn’t only bring this tablet back.” He said.

“Yes, she obtained the tablet first before entering the special domain. Immortal Emperor Fei Yang and Immortal Emperor Bu Zhan gained nothing from it but our fairy brought back the immortal artifact.” She said.

“An indomitable dao heart comes with rewards.” He said.

“You heard of this before?” She couldn’t believe it.

“A lack of desire was rewarded with an immortal artifact.” He said.

“Incredible, these were all written down in the ancient text only available to our sect. I don’t know how you have speculated all of this. I heard that the emperors were in awe when this happened.” She continued.

“And you wish to be recognized by the artifact.” He said.

“I do, it has been a while since we last had a leader. I wish for our generation to excel and live up to the greatness of our ancestors.” She said.

“You’re not the only one.” He said.

“Right, my junior sister has a lot of potential and is about as strong as me. We can’t get the artifact to recognize us.” She said.

This woman in red had the title of Sunset Glow Goddess - a genius with six sacred fruits. She was chosen as the successor and has been assigned many duties.

“You won’t be able to.” He shook his head.

“Isn’t that a little rude, Young Noble?” She glared at him.

“Given your abilities, getting recognition is tough enough, let alone controlling it.” He said.

She stroked her chin and said: “I know you’re right, ten emperors of Celestial Court coveted it too. They came but were sent flying by our fairy with just one hand sweep using the artifact. How can the likes of us hope to use it?”

This exploit was the reason why their fairy had the title of Cloudsweep.
