Chapter 4982: Tiger Deity

An outsider capable of starting a deity branch on the Divine Beast Tablet was nothing short of a miraculous legend.

After all, these branches were older than many ancient lineages and enjoyed the worship of countless species in history.

“Maybe Shadowrider is really from Mist.” Yunyun was in awe after hearing the story and speculated.

“Shh…” Goldcrest immediately stopped her: “Be careful, we don’t know who is listening.”

She stopped because it was best not to comment without solid evidence. Mist was one of the six; offending any in Demon meant not being able to leave this place alive. The deity was one thing but all of the worshippers would tear any offender into pieces.

“I don’t understand much about Mist. The current god in charge is the enigmatic Nightwalker.” Goldcrest said.

The moment he said this, he realized that there might be a problem. Previously, no one had connected Mist and Shadowrider.

One was a mysterious assassin who was thought to be a human. Furthermore, cultivators viewed demons in the Ten Great Mountains as barbarous and hotheaded, not possessing the refined attributes needed for assassination.

Despite his suspicion, commenting about Mist was unwise. Being a member of Tiger still wouldn’t protect him from violent persecution.

“No rush, we’ll get our answer soon enough.” Li Qiye smiled.

By this point, the demons under Goldcrest have finished cleaning up the battlefield and blew the summoning horns.

“Back to the city!” Goldcrest laughed heartily and commanded. Morale was at an all-time high.

“We’re watching a king in action.” Yunyun couldn’t help but praise. It seemed like Goldcrest had ample influence in Demon.

“How can we, barbarians in the wilderness, compare to you, the future ruler of Primal?” Goldcrest said with a smile.

This was indeed the truth. Primal was an orthodox lineage and The Alliance had a chance of becoming its future leader.

“Nothing is certain yet.” Yunyun shook her head.

“Since you’re here already, Young Noble and Miss Jian, allow me to be your host?” Goldcrest then invited the two of them.

“Fine, I’ll give you an opportunity to act cool in front of Yunyun.” Li Qiye smiled.

“It won’t be anything like that.” Goldcrest smiled awkwardly in response.

He turned back into his white bird form and allowed the two to ride on him. He soared through the air with lightning speed. Alas, this region was massive so it would still take some time.

Due to his power and size, the other beasts didn’t dare to bother them as the three returned to Phoenix.

This ancient city was large, albeit not on the same scale as those found outside. Nonetheless, it was incredible that such a project could be completed in this remote region.

Demons were able to live harmoniously in Phoenix. Some cultivators were here as well, either on vacation or business.

“Welcome to Phoenix.” Goldcrest introduced the city while flying in the air.

“I didn’t expect to see such a lively city.” Yunyun said.𝒩eew updates 𝒂t n𝒐vel/bi𝒏(.)com

When they first came, they didn’t see a single soul outside of violent beasts. Phoenix changed her mind about The Ten Great Mountains.

“It is built on the blood and sweat of the ancestors.” He said humbly, aware that there was no need to brag to Yunyun who had a nobler upbringing.

“The city lord is back!” Its inhabitants welcomed Goldcrest back into the city.

“Oh, a beloved leader already, young yet promising.” Li Qiye commented.

“Please don’t tease me, Young Noble. I have done nothing outside of inheriting a legacy.” Goldcrest chuckled.

Of course, he was nothing short of a capable genius. It’s just that he didn’t show any arrogance after seeing the geniuses in Abroad, especially those from the dao lineages.

For example, Yunyun was not inferior while Ming Shi continued to grow. Swordgrasp and Radiant Young Monarch in particular were the leaders of the young generation.

Alas, they have been killed by Li Qiye now.

Goldcrest treated the two with the utmost respect and prepared the best place for them to stay. Afterward, he brought them to see the worshipping ceremony.

There existed a statue inside the city lord’s main hall. It was surprisingly small - only the size of three fists or so.

It was carved out of tree roots with exquisite craftsmanship. It depicted a tiger and a monkey. The former was ferocious and looked ready for battle. On the other hand, the monkey sitting on the tiger seemed relaxed with its eyes closed.

“This is our tiger badge bestowed upon our ancestor by the founder god, truly a supreme honor.” Goldcrest said.

“Tiger Deity has two gods?” Yunyun quietly asked. The problem for her was which was the main god, the tiger or the monkey?

“The monkey is the founder god.” Li Qiye answered instead.

“You know this too, Young Noble?” Goldcrest blurted out but realized that he had said something unnecessary. Li Qiye simply knew everything.

Yunyun became more curious. If the monkey was the founder god, why was it called Tiger Deity?
