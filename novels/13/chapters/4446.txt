Chapter 4447: Open

He then focused on the rock pile with his heavenly gaze. This left him with an indescribable feeling.

He forced himself to find something special about it only to fail. In fact, he was paying attention to it due to prior knowledge. Otherwise, he would have dismissed it after a quick glance.

There was no point in worrying about it when the valley had Pinnacle Lifewater and the three-leaves grasses.

He believed that a few masters before him might have fallen into this trap, completely enthralled by the obvious treasures.

After all, they were peerless and the word “immortal” has been used to describe them. Alas, this didn’t mean much compared to actual immortality.

Thus, he focused everything he got on the rock pile. As a peerless demon god, he was mighty enough to defeat virtually everyone. With enough time, he finally figured out some clues.

In terms of appearance, most wouldn’t be able to figure out anything regardless of the angles and methods.

As for him, he ignored the actual rocky parts and focused on the missing gaps and holes. He deconstructed and re-assembled in his mind numerous times and finally saw a faint outline. However, it remained complicated and he wouldn’t be able to move on to the next step in a short time.

At this time, Li Qiye finally started. He pointed his index finger at the rock pile and started moving it around with lightning speed. It was as if he was playing the zither. The musical notes coming off his finger were woven into a dao chapter.

The dao mysteries were just like composing a song for him. Thus, the demon god stopped his calculation and watched Li Qiye in awe.

He tried everything and wasted a considerable amount of energy and effort only to see a faint outline. However, Li Qiye was acting as if he was the author of this chapter.

This was a difference between a grand scholar and a student who had just learned how to write. The latter was still learning characters and experimenting, unable to accomplish much. As for the grand scholar, he would be able to form a poem in no time at all.

This disparity shocked the demon god. He didn’t think that he was unbeatable. Pride was not one of his weak points either because he knew about stronger existences.

Nonetheless, he was not one to be unduly humble. He has been a genius his whole life and reached a height many could only dream of.

Yes, there were stronger masters than him but this number was tiny. Nonetheless, he knew the exact gap between him and these cultivators.

This was akin to a new cultivator looking at their sect master. The disparity was still perceivable.

On the other hand, the demon couldn’t gauge the difference between him and Li Qiye in the slightest. He felt as if he was a mere drop of water in the ocean.

“Stand behind me.” Li Qiye interrupted his stupor.

Anyone else would feel their pride being hurt. Why would a demon god need protection? Of course, Nine-tailed God was different and immediately followed Li Qiye’s direction.

“Buzz.” The entire pile lit up as Li Qiye waved his hand.

Minuscule yet detailed runes could be seen. They must have been carved by a supreme being using all of their efforts. Each was in tune with the worldly dao and has proven itself.

As Li Qiye moved his hand, the myriad dao of the world were moving with him - this was the demon god’s impression.

He didn’t have the chance to take a clear look before Li Qiye finished deriving all the runes.

A portal was instantly opened and a mighty power rushed out. No, two different powers.

He became astounded by the incoming power. Nonetheless, he still activated his nine tails on time.

“Rumble!” An inferno rushed for him. He thought at first that this was a type of solar flame.

However, he gasped after realizing what it was after the first contact: “Phoenix flame!”

The inferno seemed to be heralding a new world of destruction, melting everything in its path.

However, the other power was unpredictable. It kept on morphing and changing while maintaining a similar level of destruction.

The phoenix flame was clearly felt due to its scorching nature. The other was actually more difficult to stop, capable of killing the unaware victims.

He became frozen due to the elusive second power.

“Screech!” He then heard the hymn of a phoenix, one loud enough to injure his eardrums.Rêađ lat𝒆st ch𝒂pters on n𝒐/v/𝒆/l(b)i𝒏(.)c𝒐m
