Chapter 4416: Shenfan

The geniuses of Dragon swallowed their pride before Five-sun King, a potential dao lord. This didn’t mean that they were afraid of those from the east.

After all, they were the second strongest sect of the south. They have always walked the world with arrogance and pride, thinking that they were superior. Some wanted to fight the provoker but their seniors held them back.

The seniors of Dragon, especially the ancestors, didn’t want to see more trouble. Even if an alliance couldn’t be formed, they didn’t have to become enemies.

“Fellow Daoist Shenfan, you’re out of line.” Celestial Tiger stepped forward. As the first brother of Dragon, he didn’t allow outsiders to insult them.

“I disagree.” Shenfan Tianjie was one of the thirty-six sovereigns under Five-sun King, a genius capable enough to sweep through his peers: “How many in Dragon are actually worthy of the saintess’ hand in marriage?”

The youths of Dragon became ashamed and angry while the ancestors watched silently. The former found it hard to retort because this was indeed the case.

None of them had a bloodline on the same level as Jian Qingzhu. Of course, they didn’t appreciate the blatant contempt.

“Her marriage is her personal matter, not for us to worry about.” Celestial Tiger uttered coldly: “You have insulted us several times now. Although you are an esteemed guest, you will have to apologize since this is unacceptable.”

“Damn right!” The young members applauded.

Outsiders nodded in agreement, thinking that Celestial Tiger was doing a great job as the first brother of Dragon. Yôur f𝒂vorite stories on 𝒏/o/(v)𝒆/lb𝒊n(.)c𝒐m

“That’s why he is our representative.” The youths appreciated him standing up for them.

“Seems like you wish to fight for your sect members’ honor. Fine, let’s duel. If you win, I’ll take back what I’ve said earlier. If you lose, don’t blame me for not holding back.” Shenfan Tianjie proudly said, completely confident in his own power.

This was a blatant challenge; Celestial Tiger couldn’t refuse.

“I can’t back down before your challenge.” He wasn’t one to be afraid of trouble either. His tiger eyes became fierce.

“Let’s see what you can do then.” Shenfan Tianjie stepped forward and said: “I’ve heard how you have defeated the geniuses of our continent. It’s a shame that I was away from home and didn’t have the chance to fight you. Well, today is as good a day as any, let’s do this.”

“There is no need to cause a rift by fighting a guest.” An ancestor from Dragon wanted to stop this fight.

However, Treasure Ancestor from the east spoke: “It’s fine, let the youths fight it out.”

Peacock Monarch slightly frowned after hearing this but didn’t stop Celestial Tiger from fighting.

“Fellow Daoist, let’s see who is stronger between the two of us!” Shenfan Tianjie took out his weapon - an ancient banner made from the dao bone of a primal chaos beast. Obscured runes were embroidered on the cloth, forming a divine spider spitting out webs. It looked animated, seemingly on the verge of leaving the banner.

“Soaring Spider Banner.” The members from the east became surprised.

“Tianjie used this weapon to beat many geniuses before losing to Five-sun King and joining him.” One cultivator commented. This was the weapon that helped Tianjie become famous.

The Shenfan Clan was renowned for their banner-making ability. Everyone desired to have one made but it wasn’t so easy.

Shenfan Tianjie started with his top weapon right away, clearly taking Celestial Tiger very seriously.

“Clank!” Celestial Tiger summoned his tyrannical spear and uttered coldly: “I’ve heard of your battle feats long ago. Today, I will overestimate myself and see how I fare against you.”

“Don’t worry, you’ll be utterly convinced. The reason why you won against the east was that you didn’t see me or His Majesty. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have returned triumphantly.” Shenfan Tianjie arrogantly declared.

“We’ll see if you live up to your reputation.” Celestial Tiger uttered coldly.

“Since you’re the first brother of Dragon, if you lose, I hope your fellow members will shut up from now on and know their place. Only His Majesty is worthy of marrying a divine bloodline.” Shenfan Tianjie barked back.

The annoying insult carried an undeniable truth. No one else in Dragon had a similar bloodline. Thus, they were mere frogs wanting to eat swan meat if they wanted to court Jian Qingzhu.

“Go.” Celestial Tiger didn’t want to keep on talking. It was hard to argue against someone who kept on bringing Five-sun King up.

“Very well!” Shenfan Tianjie gathered his power and released twelve fate palaces. He became engulfed in chaos energy with haste.

“Buzz.” Two supreme grand dao appeared and circled around him.

Visual phenomena emerged behind him - a banner blotting out the sun and the celestials. Beneath the banner were roaring beasts, deep abysses, bloody moons…

He had fused the laws of his weapon into his own grand dao to reach utmost proficiency.

“A two-dao sovereign.” The crowd was impressed due to his age.

“My turn!” Celestial Tiger also roared and became engulfed in chaos energy. A gigantic dragon image coiled around him with an impressive aura. His spear became resplendent as well.
