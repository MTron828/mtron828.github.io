Chapter 4404: A Rooster

Jian Qingzhu was stirred as well because it has been several decades now. For a powerful sect like Dragon, only an all-out invasion or an unprecedented crisis would necessitate this summoning call. For example, the death of an ancestor or the coronation of a new sect master.

Hesitation arose because her current perspective didn’t align with the sect’s. However, she was still a member of Dragon and would support it if necessary.

As disciples speculated while running back, another war horn sounded along with drums.

Lights appeared among the three branches and the city became illuminated. This felt like a celebration more than anything.

“Wait, it’s something good?” Returners became curious after they saw colored banners and lanterns.

“A prestigious guest is coming.” Someone spread this message.

Everyone became curious right away. The three branches were working together for the reception? This was rather astonishing.

Given Dragon’s current status and power, few were qualified for this treatment. Prestigious sect masters were usually only taken care of by one branch at a time. Not even the king of Lion’s Roar warranted this reception.

“Who is it?” Outsiders became curious. CH𝒆Ck for 𝒏ew st𝒐ries on no/v/el/bin(.)c0m

“A top master is coming?” Even disciples from Dragon couldn’t find the answer.

“I think it has to be the king of Lion’s Roar.” An older cultivator stated.

“I don’t think so, a big shot from True Immortal, Three Thousand Dao, or Central Ground is more likely.”

“I’m sure it is someone exceptional for Dragon to put so much effort into the reception.” This was the consensus. Dragon, one of the strongest sects in Eastern Desolace, has hosted plenty of top masters before. Ordinary ancestors couldn’t enjoy this treatment.

Jian Qingzhu heaved a sigh of relief after seeing this. She didn’t need to worry since no invaders were attacking.

“Over there.” She headed deeper into the village.

The duo arrived at a hill at the end of the village. It had verdant trees but didn’t look special otherwise. It lacked spirituality and an impressive appearance.

However, she noticed an old hut on top of it. It has been there for who knows how many years. There was no lock and it was creaking to the wind.

She entered and didn’t see anyone, only a kitchen stove made out of clay. She went back out and saw a few chickens.

Some were searching for food in the grass; others rested beneath a tree’s shade; more were just playing around. They were certainly having a good time.

“There’s no one here.” She released her divine intent throughout the hill and couldn’t find anyone.

“But this is the right place.” Though disappointed, she still didn’t give up and tried to search again.

“I’m sure this is the right place.” Both the monkey king and her father had guided her to this village.

“Phoenix Ground is in a crisis. I, a member of the Jian, respectfully ask for an audience, Ancestor.” She got on her knees and bowed in all four directions.

She was certain that he was in the village and watching. He just didn’t wish to interact with them.

It wasn’t a rare occurrence at all. Most top ancestors were buried in the sect; only the big shots could come to visit them.

However, a few roamed freely in the sect and didn’t interact with anyone. Not even the strongest members of the sect had a clue.

For example, this was the case for Nine-tailed God. Dragon had lost contact with him completely. Fortunately, the three ancient demons weren’t so elusive.

The demon monarchs still knew their current whereabouts. The issue was whether Ancient Pheasant would take the time to talk to disciples.

“Ancestor, please grant me an audience.” Qingzhu didn’t give up.

Li Qiye eventually lost his patience and said: “Enough, let me do it.”

“Boom!” He raised his hand and released the power of the grand dao. Laws manifested around his palm as he reached for a rooster sitting on top of a tree branch.

“Boom!” The rooster suddenly pulsed with five different colored lights.

“Alright, alright, stop!” The rooster suddenly spoke with an ancient voice.

“Ancestor!” Qingzhu immediately kneeled again.

“Rise, no need for formalities.” The rooster shook its head.
