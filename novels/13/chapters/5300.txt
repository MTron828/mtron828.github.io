Chapter 5301: Face Smash

Inside the tavern, Li Qiye raised an eyebrow while the old man seemed to have remembered something.

“I…” He slammed the table and immediately stood up.

***

He appeared before Jue Xian’er and startled everyone including the Immortal Emperors.

“This is mine.” He snatched the armor away from the chains and hugged it as if it was his own child.

“Clank! Clank! Clank!” Something miraculous happened - the armor set actually attached to his body.

A magnificent visual phenomenon appeared before everyone - the appearance of an ocean large enough to drown the entire six continents. The waves could reach high enough to immediately extinguish the sun.

A moon floated above the ocean and added a silvery glow to the water, occasionally embraced by the high waves.

The middle-aged man became a paragon capable of shouldering the high heaven despite not possessing any aura.

“This is…” Guan Feng and Ming Du observed this transformation and became emotional.

All the emperors recalled a particular figure at the same time.

“Shit, shit…” In a distant place, Firmament Godchild saw this and cursed: “He got tricked by that damned crow again. Fuck, I will not fuse together again and work like an ox for the crow, not in this lifetime, pah.”

He gritted his teeth and stomped the ground, wanting to leave. After all, he was living a great life. There was no need to work so hard again. Moreover, nothing good would come from being together with the crow, only repression and frustration.

“Hand it over!” Jue Xian’er demanded the artifact and attacked with Immortal Piercer.

The chain could seal anything, even the strongest known cultivator. It had never failed her before since it possessed the ability to seal more than just physical entities.

“Clank!” Someone appeared in the direction of the chain and somehow grabbed it.

Keep in mind that the chain had a special property of traveling through everything before locking the target. It would trap the soul for eternity if necessary.

However, when this hand touched it, it became softer and immobilized like a caught snake.

Everyone looked over and saw that the person grabbing the chain was none other than Li Qiye.

“Ah?!” Ming Du staggered backward after taking a good look at Li Qiye.

Yang Sheng and Guan Feng’s eyes became wide open, wondering what the hell they were looking at.

“You!” Jue Xian’er became murderous after seeing him.Thê sourc𝗲 of this content n/o/v/(𝒆l)bi((n))

“A little girl shouldn’t be so violent.” Li Qiye glanced at her before pulling hard on the chain and swinging it.

This slammed her to the ground and made her see stars. However, she still didn’t let go of the chain.

“You.” Li Qiye ignored her and stared at Immortal Emperor Ming Du.

“Yeah, me.” Ming Du let out a dry laugh before assuming a stance: “Watch my move!”

He stood on one foot and executed a “white crane spreading its wings”. This ordinary martial art move had quite an imposing presence when done by him.

“Scram!” Li Qiye strongly swung the chain in the direction of the “white crane”.

“Bam!” This move couldn’t stop the legendary chain from smashing Ming Du in the face, causing blood and flesh to splash.

The emperor who got sent flying didn’t dare to linger behind and used the momentum to escape into the horizon.

Spectators couldn’t believe it - a famous and supreme emperor from Heaven Alliance lost after one move and decided to run?

However, they were shocked at Li Qiye’s power too. Easily stopping Immortal Piercer and defeating Immortal Emperor Ming Du?

Meanwhile, Lesser Firmament shook violently. The fog inside seemed to be furious, on the verge of escaping refinement.

It headed straight in the direction of the middle-aged man who was wearing Moon Embrace.

The latter didn’t care for anything. He glared at the fog and shouted: “What are you looking at?! This is mine, don’t even dream about it!”

“Boom!” The fog became livid and unleashed a force capable of crushing everything.

“Crash!” The crystal walls crumbled and the fog turned into a dragon claw aiming straight at the man.

Li Qiye focused up and ran into the fog, disappearing from sight.

The top cultivators nearby couldn’t believe what they saw next - the rampaging fog suddenly receded like the tides and retreated back to Lesser Firmament.

“What?!” Most had a serious expression after seeing this

Ferocity was one exception. He didn’t care about the sinners and the fog, only Moon Embrace.

“Hand it over!” He shouted.

“Heaven Alliance should be in charge of it.” Lantern Conqueror’s eyes lit up.

“Nonsense!” Heaven Hammer raised his titular weapon, causing the battleground to shake.

“Hmph, it’s about time to fight.” Immortal Emperor Yang Sheng stood up and released his imperial aura.
