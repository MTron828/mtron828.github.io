Most disciples were captivated by the numerous treasures piled in front of Li Qiye. Of course, the ones who lost to him had an ugly expression.

They were humiliated in public and worst of all, in front of Gong Qianyue.

The elders smiled wryly at this scene and thought that it was good that they didn’t join. A while ago, they themselves didn’t believe he could derive ten merit laws.

Li Qiye only glanced at the pile since these treasures were nothing more than scrap metals to him or even inferior.

“Idiots.” Li Qiye smiled and told them.

The losing betters felt their face becoming hot. Gong Qianyue had said the same thing before but Li Qiye’s comment struck far harder. They still didn’t accept that he was better than them by this point. Thus, this humiliation felt much worse. Nonetheless, they didn’t dare to voice it.

“Hmph!” Zhan Hu and Huang Ning scowled.

Huang Ning wasn’t a part of this bet but he didn’t feel good about Li Qiye stealing the spotlight.

“And you two are the biggest idiots here.” Li Qiye lazily added while staring at the two.

“You!” Zhan Hu’s expression became unsightly as he glared back.

“Junior Brother, don’t be so haughty now. Success is good but there is still a long way to go in the future...” Huang Ning took a deep breath and tried his best to calm down, assuming the role of a senior. He spoke as if he had Li Qiye’s well-being in mind.

“Don’t waste your breath lecturing me, if you’re not convinced by my statement, come. I’ll stomp you down.” Li Qiye interrupted Huang Ning.

The spectators exchanged glances, thinking that Li Qiye had changed. Just a while ago, he ignored their taunts and didn’t bother to retort. Now, aggression took over.

Little did they know that he simply didn’t care prior. Now, his mood had changed.

This was akin to worms shouting at a giant. The giant didn’t care but it wouldn’t be troublesome to stomp down on them either. There was no need for a reason or justification; this was dependent on the giant’s whim.

The two naturally didn’t take this sitting down. They were okay with Gong Qianyue’s provocation since she was stronger and more prestigious.

Now, an Iron Skin like Li Qiye wanted to stomp on them? No way they could restraint themselves now.

Zhan Hu was the son of Iron Rod Demon King, the First Disciple of Jade Bird. Huang Ning was a genius in Divine Black and the youngest disciple of Thousand Arms Bodhi King.

“Let’s fight then, I want to see you try!” Huang Ning uttered coldly; his eyes flashed with murderous intent.

“Hmph, I want to see what you got too.” Zhan Hu has been eager to teach Li Qiye a lesson for a long time now but never had an opportunity.

If he dared to challenge them, it was time to show him how vast this world was.

“Fellow disciples shouldn’t talk with the sword.” The elder in charge shook his head, clearly favoring Li Qiye.

An Iron Skin like him couldn’t take on Zhan Hu and Huang Ning, especially the latter who was an Enlightened Being right now.

During an actual fight, other means and schemes weren’t enough to make up this disparity.

Sure, the elders thought that Li Qiye had some mysterious abilities but he shouldn’t have a sliver of a chance of winning in a real fight to the death. They wanted to cultivate a good seed like him.

“Hmm, out of respect for the elders, I won’t pursue this but if you dare to make the same mistake...” Zhan Hu snorted and continued.

“No need for that.” Li Qiye waved his hand and said: “Come, I won’t bully you and will just use one finger.”

“...” Zhan Hu started laughing with rage: “Such arrogance! I want to see how you’ll beat me with one finger!”

“No need to shed blood.” Huang Ning stopped him and stared coldly at Li Qiye: “There’s another method if he wants to challenge us.”

Zhan Hu’s eyes narrowed as he exchanged glances with Huang Ning. He eventually said: “Very well, we won’t resort to fighting because others might call us bullies. There are still two more trials to go, yes?”

“That’s a good idea.” Zhang Yue agreed and nodded: “Whoever can pass the trials and earn more points will be the winner.”

“So be it.” Li Qiye smiled and didn’t mind the change.

The other two seemed to have a plan going on already.

“Let’s do it like this, I’ll compete against you during the fourth trial and Brother Zhan Hu will compete against you for the fifth trial.” Huang Ning suggested. VIssịT n0(v)eL/b(i)(n).𝘤𝑜𝓂 for the best novel reading experience

“Yes, that sounds fine.” Zhan Hu nodded in agreement.

Others thought that this was an interesting decision because Huang Ning was stronger than Zhan Hu. If anything, Huang Ning should have the fifth trial instead of the fourth.

“This will be fun to watch.” Those who dislike Li Qiye said, thinking that he was an arrogant parvenu.

“Ok, what is at stake.” Li Qiye smiled.

The two mused for a bit. They naturally wanted to kill him but couldn’t blatantly say so.

“Just a friendly contest is fine, no need for anything serious.” The elder in charge immediately told those two, not wanting any injury to occur to Li Qiye.

“If you lose, you’ll need to leave Divine Black.” Huang Ning eventually broke the silence.

“Not necessarily.” The elder’s tone became serious. He naturally wanted Li Qiye to stay.

“Elder, I have made up my mind.” Huang Ning then stared provocatively at Li Qiye: “Do you dare?!”

He was completely confident in winning the fourth trial. If Li Qiye were to leave, that would be an eyesore gone. If Li Qiye were to refuse, then the guy would look bad in front of Qianyue. Maybe she would look down on him.

“Sure, and if you lose?” Li Qiye still had a smile on.

Huang Ning hesitated for a moment before strongly replying: “My ancestor has given me a treasure. It shall be yours if I lose.”

“This bet is too serious.” Another elder knew about this treasure and refused permission.
