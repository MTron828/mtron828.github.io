Chapter 5849: Heaven Wish

Derivation, the grotesque eldritch, looked like he should belong in hell. Alas, instead of suffering, he seemed to be the ruler of hell.

With the drum on his body, he had access to the hellish realm, always ready to invade the mortal world with its specter armies. None would be able to evade their curses of hatred, subjected to unending torment.

Skysplitter looked inconspicuous compared to his allies. It didn’t matter how they summoned invincible weapons and dao, he maintained the same stance behind his shield.

Hiding when Li Qiye attacked, thrusting when he turned away - a simple strategy without relying on the mysteries of the dao. This was to his allies’ chagrin but he didn’t give a damn.

“Where is your weapon?” Dao Ancestor asked Li Qiye.

They hoped he would summon one so that they have time to analyze it. Otherwise, he might catch them off guard during the fight with an unknown weapon.

“I suppose I can show you.” Li Qiye smiled and raised his left hand, seemingly searching for something in the mortal world.

“Clank!” He gathered and condensed the thoughts of all living beings in the mortal coil into a single blade.

It had a majestic life force but was also filled with impurities, akin to a treasure blade with rust spots all over. Nevertheless, this was the melody of the mortal world - its true form and essence.

“Lifewish Blade, made from their wishes and will.” Li Qiye said: “Your group once refined the living beings and devoured the world, now is the time for retribution.”

“That’s a nice name for a sword.” Primal said: “But how can insignificant ants punish us?”

“Have a taste.” Li Qiye smiled and raised the blade, revealing the endless mortal coil and thoughts.

Greed, lust, ambition, and other emotions of the so-called ants came together as one and pushed up the world.

“First variation, Genesis!” Primal didn’t have a high evaluation of Li Qiye’s technique, thinking that it was all style and no substance.

“Boom!” He split the sky with a swing, commanding this affinity to turn into countless energy axes.

“Boom!” They merged into a single one and cleaved heaven and earth apart. Explosions and lights surged forth, forcing every living being to close their eyes.

“The will of ants shall reach infinity itself...” Impure thoughts were suddenly removed from the blade, leaving them united. This pure thought turned into the heaven and the dao, unable to be cut down by the blood axe.

“Epoch Sword Heart!” Imperial Progenitor thrust his blade forward. Spectators couldn’t see anything because this sword was born within the target’s heart. This became more potent since Li Qiye was using a technique relying on thoughts and wills.

“Not bad.” As the blade manifested into reality in Li Qiye’s heart, he immediately grabbed the hilt.

Imperial Progenitor’s technique had exceeded the boundary of time since it was born within Li Qiye’s heart. It should have been unblockable yet Li Qiye still somehow grabbed it.

Time and space became chaotic, seemingly flowing backward to the moment when Imperial Progenitor thrust his sword.

Li Qiye broke the sword and threw the remnant blade at the opponent’s throat who stood there stunned.

“Break!” Stonesplitter was ready and raised his shield, blocking the sword successfully.

Although others made fun of his cowardly nature, they also knew that his defensive potential exceeded theirs.

“Myriad Race Curse!” Derivation started swinging his hands ten thousand times, building momentum for a powerful smack.

“Boom!” Finally, he struck the drum and released its sweeping power.

“Raa!” The prisoners wailed; their agony and hatred turned into a single curse. This malice has been accumulated since ancient times, intending to torture the enemies forever and ever, preventing them from ever being reborn.

The fabrics of reality were cursed terrifyingly. Just a slight touch from anything infected would kill an emperor. Yôur favorite 𝒏ovels at n/𝒐(v)el/bin(.)com

“Heaven Wish!” Li Qiye changed the will of the people into a desire to see the heaven.

“Boom!” An azure appeared to block the incoming curse.
