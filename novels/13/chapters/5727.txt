Chapter 5728: Go Honorably

The duo had nowhere to run. Li Qiye could always chase after them, forcing them to flee like dogs.

“Sacred Teacher, we wish to atone.” Luminous suggested.

“How you have fallen and thrown away the dignity of a conqueror. Where did the arrogant Luminous Conqueror of the past go? Still returning after being reduced to ashes. Look at you now, I’m afraid he would view you with nothing but disdain.” Li Qiye shook his head.

Luminous’ face burned with embarrassment while Li Qiye spoke. He was once a brilliant genius. His talent invoked jealousy and fear from Deity Dao, forcing them to destroy him before he could fully mature.

Of course, this was after repeated invitations to both Deity Dao and Celestial Court. However, he was prideful and never cared about either one. He didn’t beg for mercy either after being ambushed by numerous imperial-level characters.

What about now in the present - choosing to conspire with Celestial Court and abandoning his previous conviction, picking a life of scheming and hiding in the shadows?

“You’ve become the thing you hated the most.” Li Qiye sighed and said: “The only atonement is to return everything, that’s the only way to wash your sins away.”

The two understood that Li Qiye was not going to show them mercy or give them a chance to live.

“Venerable immortal, save us!” Luminous shouted; his voice traveled deep into the crevices of the sky vault.

Unfortunately, no response came. The only sound afterward was his echoing words.

He turned pale, aware that they had been abandoned just like how they had abandoned Dao Domain.

“Asking for help from Celestial Court’s founder? Or their three immortals? Or some other entities in your imagination?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I’m afraid you’re not worth the risk.” Li Qiyte continued: “They know full well that their best chance of survival against me is to stay in Celestial Court. Leaving means certain death while there is a sliver of hope by just entrenching themselves there. What makes you think they’ll come out to save you?”

The two had no response, aware that this was the end of the road for them.

“I will give you a chance to make the move, earn yourselves some dignity again by going honorably.” Li Qiye beckoned. “Sacred Teacher, your insistence will not yield the desired result!” West Bank shouted.

“Oh, threatening me now?” Li Qiye smiled.

“Why should we follow your whim with our death, Sacred Teacher? Please give us a swift end.” Luminous shouted.

They understood that death was the next outcome but didn’t want to be punished via an agonizing essence return.

“I have no reason to fulfill your wish.” Li Qiye said.

“Sacred Teacher, your hands are stained with blood, have you never made a mistake in your life?!” Luminous shouted. Điscover n𝒆w chapt𝒆rs 𝒐n n0𝒗e(l)bi𝒏(.)com

“People make mistakes, but your mistakes are unforgivable.” Li Qiye smiled.

“We will not comply, Sacred Teacher!” The two exchanged glances and made up their mind.

“Rumble!” They summoned their dao fruits and released their vitality, resulting in a blinding expanse of power.

Their true fate and grand dao started burning intensely to the spectators’ horror. The latter immediately turned to run.

Unfortunately, they couldn’t move an inch due to the duo’s suppressive imperial auras. All living beings became immobilized.

“Buzz.” Their fruits, vitality, true fate, and dao became one during the melting process.

Each drop of true blood and each strand of grand dao pulsed brightly, on the verge of exploding.

“Implosion!” Spectators bellowed in fear.

Undoubtedly, the duo chose a flashy way to go out instead of obeying Li Qiye’s command. Implosion was the best method.

Two apex cultivators melted everything together in preparation for an implosion - this would have devastating consequences. The force could sweep through Dao Domain and reduce everything to nothingness.

Li Qiye wanted them to nourish this land by draining them of all cultivation. However, they preferred to do the opposite of that with their death.

This was their way of getting revenge on him for dragging them out of Immortal Dao City and crushing their ambition.
