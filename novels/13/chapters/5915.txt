Chapter 5915: Kill Me, Sacred Teacher

“It’s an amusing proposal. If I kill you, isn’t it the same as stabbing myself?” Li Qiye smiled.

“I’m sure you won’t mind given your greatness, Sacred Teacher.” Present said: “You want to kill the current me, not a different me.”

“That’s logical too.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“I view you as one of my ambitious goals while you view me as a polishing stone. After all, I am a rather special stone who can polish your blade.” Present said.

“You are very confident.” Li Qiye smiled.

“As you already know, this concerns my origin, not confidence.” Present disagreed.

“Right.” Li Qiye stroked his chin: “It’s rare to see such a nice stone. If I don’t carve it, I should use it as a polishing stone.”

“My master had done the carving, now you can only use me as a polishing stone.” Present said.

“I suppose I can start with the present since you are willing.” Li Qiye said.

“And you’re after the other stones as well, Sacred Teacher.” Present said.

“Yes, Past and Future.” Li Qiye nodded: “Perhaps there is an answer after polishing all three.”

“You might not need those two after Present, the most important one. The past is gone and the future has yet to happen.” Present said.

“Do you know what Past and Future are like?” Li Qiye asked. [1]

“I have asked my master this question before and he told me to find the answer myself.” Present paused momentarily before answering: “What do you think about them, Sacred Teacher?”

“He is right, you three are the best suited to find yourselves. Others might not truly excavate what looms beneath.” Li Qiye nodded.

“That’s why you’re searching for that one thing.” Present said.

“Just searching, I don’t need it. Did your master not want to tell you?” Li Qiye said.

“He said it has been too long and I might not remember everything.” Present responded.

“If it can be said, then it can be remembered. If it can’t be remembered, then it can’t be said.” Li Qiye said.

“Then he does think it is necessary to speak on this matter.” Present said.

“I don’t know.” Li Qiye shrugged.

“You’re trying to make me doubt, Sacred Teacher.” Present said.

“Why doubt? You can do what you should and ignore what others say. If your master didn’t say it, then it means not everything needed to be told to you.” Li Qiye smiled.

“You speak the truth, I was the one who overthought.” Present chuckled.

“Your master is searching for something as well, or maybe a few things.” Li Qiye remarked.

“It’s possible, and regardless of what they are, I’m part of the clues.” Present didn’t find this surprising or show any fear.

“Yes, I don’t have many clues either so if I can meet you, I would be more than happy to start there and take my time.” Li Qiye nodded.

“Do you not know the locations of the other two stones?” Present asked.

“Even if I do, I’m not sure if what you are looking for is there.” He paused and stared at Present: “It’s best to start with you since due to the shared origin, you can sense their existence.”

“To be honest, Sacred Teacher, I occasionally get a vague feeling but it’s not rare, only lasting for a split second. The only thing I can be sure of is that they’re still in this world.” Present said.

“That’s one clue.” Li Qiye stroked his chin.

“But, killing me won’t give you more clues because I don’t know anything about this matter. You can tear me apart to no avail.” Present said.

“Yes, at the very least you do not know right now. Perhaps no one does.” Li Qiye nodded.

“When you kill me, this feeling will disperse and you won’t be able to go from there.” Present didn’t hide anything. 𝒩ewW 𝒏ovels upd𝒂tes on nov/𝒆l/b(i)𝒏(.)com

“It was just an idea, I don’t need to find anything from you.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“Then I am reassured. It is an honor to fight you to the death, Sacred Teacher.” Present laughed.

“Yes, just one stone is still better than nothing. There’s some hope.” Li Qiye said.

“Then I wish you a fruitful harvest so you can begin your journey.” Present said.

“The truth is that the journey has nothing to do with all this. Once I’ve cleared Eight Desolaces and the six continents, I can start my journey without needing anything else.” Li Qiye shook his head.

“Then why, Sacred Teacher?” Present asked.

“What will you do after killing me and breaking the night? Will you start the search or kill your master and the high heaven?” Li Qiye answered with a question.

“Hmm...” Present pondered: “I haven’t thought about it before.”

“Do you know what the high heaven wields?” Li Qiye asked with a smile.

“What is it?” Present was interested in the answer.

Li Qiye shrugged and said: “Looks like you have a long way to go.”

“Are you saying that I am not qualified?” Present understood the implication.

“The path is taken one step at a time, no one can skip to the finish line.” Li Qiye elaborated.

“So in your opinion, I have taken a shortcut?” Present couldn’t help but ask.

“Not quite, but your grand goals are too simple.” Li Qiye waved his hand.

“Isn’t it enough to come up with an idea and execute it, Sacred Teacher?” Present asked.

“If that is your idea, what are Past and Future planning? It’s not only about your wishes.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I do not know.” Present said.

“Which is why there is a long road ahead of you. Unfortunately, the day when you reach the other side will never come.” Li Qiye declared.

“Because you wish to kill me.” Present said.

“Exactly why you called me here.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Looks like it’ll be more than a killing, an erasure of my existence.” Present said.

“Don’t make it sound so serious, this is just a chance for me to solve some questions.” Li Qiye smiled while looking at this world.
