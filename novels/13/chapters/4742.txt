Chapter 4743: Five Heavenly Monarchs

Five colors took over instead of the regular blue azure. Everyone immediately looked up at this visual phenomenon.

“Who is it?” They knew that someone amazing has arrived.

The colors suddenly exploded and left a hole big enough for a figure to appear. The remaining radiance then gathered around the majestic figure. He wore a crown and seemed to be the heaven’s equal.

“Titanic Monarch!” Many important figures shouted his title, aware that the reinforcement from Three Thousand Dao was here.

“Buzz.” Space shook violently next with loud buzzes.

Though some tried to cover their ears tightly, this didn’t work. The buzzes still drilled inside and became unbearable. A few couldn’t handle this and rolled on the ground; their ears started bleeding.

“Seal your senses, it’s Resonance Monarch.” A powerful cultivator ordered before sealing all six senses.

Next came a fiery ray resembling a phoenix tail. It spanned marvelously for a hundred thousand miles.

The rider of this ray turned out to be a woman in a daoist robe with her heavenly gaze activated. This gave her eyes a disorienting effect for those staring at them for too long.

Most have never seen her before so they were surprised to find out that the monarch was a woman.

“Boom!” A spatial hole appeared and out came a great pagoda. It must have traveled a great distance in the blink of an eye.

It pulsed brilliantly and became the center of the world. Its divinity commanded veneration, turning it into a portal toward paradise.

An old man with an impressive presence walked out of the entrance. It grew small enough for him to carry in his hand. Nonetheless, it looked more like a vessel containing a world instead of a simple pagoda.

“Pagoda Monarch.” A great demon said.

“That’s five monarchs from Three Thousand Dao, just missing the leader, Enveloping.” The group’s arrival shocked the crowd.

Even the elders and ancestors from Three Thousand Dao became emotional. They rarely got a chance to meet a single monarch, let alone five in the same place.

“Five heavenly monarchs, Sky’s End ancestors from True Immortal, Trinity Saints, four conquerors…” Cultivators had a hard time grasping the power of the alliance.

Its goal was none other than defeating Li Qiye. In fact, just being able to fight any member of this alliance was something to be proud of. Today, Li Qiye was going to fight all of them by himself.

“The competition is no joke, this will be bloody.” A genius obtained a deeper insight into the dao lord competition afterward.

Embarking on this path meant potentially facing the entire world one day and its behemoths. True Immortal, Three Thousand Dao, and the powers of the east were hellbent on taking Li Qiye down at any cost. Upd𝒂ted chapters 𝒐n n𝒐velbin(.)com

“Five out of six. Where is Enveloping?” Paramount Goddess remained undeterred.

Her fierce attitude astounded the crowd. It appeared that all of the tales about her were true.

Rumor has it that Enveloping Monarch was nearly as strong as Dao Sanqian. This meant that the other five monarchs working together might not be able to defeat him.

“Goddess, if you wish to fight, we shall entertain you.” Resonance Monarch thunderously challenged.

“You bunch aren’t enough to deter me.” The goddess proudly said. Her powerful style made others forget about her unimpressive appearance.

“They’re here for me so let them come, I’ll handle this.” Li Qiye stretched lazily and ordered her to stop.

She glanced at him and then at the five monarchs before leaping up into the air again, away from the battlefield.

With that, the five monarchs landed around Li Qiye, surrounding him.

“Reinforcements from True Immortal, Three Thousand Dao, and the east are here. We’re just missing people from Divine Dragon.” Someone commented.

The competition was one thing but most importantly, the immortal gemstone was up for grabs as well. This was potentially killing two birds with one stone.

“And Divine Dragon?” Li Qiye glanced at Tian Feng.

Everyone else also did the same. They knew that Divine Dragon had numerous powerful demons but only Tian Feng has shown up thus far.

“I’m the one who wants to fight you, not my parents or grandparents. Why would they come?” Tian Feng said.

This was indeed the truth. He only wanted to fight Li Qiye and didn’t care that much about the dao lord competition.
