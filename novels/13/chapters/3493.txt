The news of the fight between Li Qiye and Bai Jianchan spread like wildfires across Ancestral City then to the rest of the north.

Most haven’t heard about Li Qiye and wondered about his identity.

Because of this, an expert from a slightly big country became curious: “I’ve never heard of this guy before. He dared to challenge Young Lord Bai? Too arrogant, no?”

A more knowledgeable soul replied: “This person has a phoenix bloodline on top of Immortal Assailant Emperor’s treasury and a phoenix’s legacies. Ancestral City is supporting him now, going as far as annulling their engagement with Yin Yang Gate.”

“Really? This guy might be the luckiest man in this generation.” The listeners started salivating.

People knew about the imperial treasury a while back. This was enough to drive people crazy and jealous of this unknown junior.

“Not just that, I heard both Pearlstone Saintess and Dragon-phoenix Maiden like him. He’s pretty much the heaven’s favorite, the whole thing seems like a legend.” The more information they found out about him, the more jealous they became.

“So two of the three beauties, only Bai Jianchan was like this before. So lucky.”

“So what if he’s lucky?” Some were on Bai Jianchan’s side and didn’t think highly of Li Qiye.

One person snorted and added: “His luck will end here, only death will come from opposing Young Lord Bai.”

Many agreed with this frightening comment because Bai Jianchan was just too strong. Even those who haven’t seen him in person thought that Li Qiye was being suicidal.

“I think his ego grew due to all of his successes recently.” Even the neutral cultivators thought that Li Qiye had zero chance of winning.

“Young Lord Bai is at the sacred level already, how many others are in the north? So few among the young generation. He’s strong enough to fight an ancestor from a big sect, this Li Qiye has only started recently. It’s very unwise.” A high elder analyzed.

“He should have taken a step back and waited for more time, the sky’s the limit.” Another logical observer added.

In their opinion, Li Qiye had the right bloodline and resources. In fact, no one else had comparable advantages.

If he could wait long enough and escape, it wouldn’t be late in the future to challenge Bai Jianchan. He could become a strong candidate for the dao lord position too.

Ancestral City’s conversations were actually more heated than the ones in the outer regions. One could hear about it from one end of the street to the other. Everyone was talking about the duel three days later. It was too exciting, a must-watch.

“Young Lord Bai will definitely win!” One female cultivator clenched her fist and confidently declared. Who knows if she was supporting Bai Jianchan or trying to make herself feel better.

“There’s no doubt about it. Young Lord Bai’s victory is assured.” A saintess announced.

“No one can stop Young Lord Bai!” It didn’t take long before various chants and lines were spread all over the city.

Bai Jianchan had an irreplaceable position in these girls’ heart. They thought that he was an unbeatable god.

“Not necessarily.” A jealous cultivator barked back against the mass: “It’s not like Li Qiye is useless. Have you all forgotten about the treasures he summoned at Sacred Spirit Hall with one hand? That’s an unprecedented and magnificent feat, one to be remembered for eras to come.”

The jealous cultivators couldn’t compare to Bai Jianchan so they wielded Li Qiye like a sword in order to put Jianchan down.

The atmosphere soured after this was brought up. The excited girls had nothing to say because they still remembered the humiliation suffered during that event.

“Hmph, maybe he got lucky again. Just the right time for when the treasury in the hall opens. The treasures dropped down for all to share.” A golden daughter defended Bai Jianchan.

This group naturally wouldn’t accept Jianchan’s defeat or Li Qiye’s achievement. That’s why they came up with various reasons and excuses. ViiSiit n𝒐velb𝒊/n(.)c/(𝒐)m for l𝒂test 𝒏𝒐vels

All in all, they said that it wasn’t a real victory from Li Qiye. It had everything to do with luck.

“I completely agree.” Another girl nodded in agreement: “He won’t be as lucky on the stage during a fight to the death battle. Only skills will matter then.”

“He’s obviously inferior in that regard, Young Lord Bai is already at the sacred level while Li Qiye is only a Silver Carapace. Just one finger is enough to crush the guy.” A prestigious lady immediately said.

It was the jealous cultivators’ turn to be speechless. Jianchan’s strength was well-documented. Many felt that Li Qiye didn’t have a good chance.

“Don’t forget, Li Qiye massacred Yin Yang Gate’s army back in Fire Domain not long ago.” One youth brought up another matter.

The pretty girls instantly focused on the weak point of this argument. One of them said: “This isn’t Fire Domain. I was also there, he only relied on his phoenix bloodline to borrow the power of the trueflame found there.”

“Yes, what can he borrow here? He’s not a golem nor is he a disciple from a golem sect. His phoenix bloodline isn’t of use in this place. Moreover, his weak cultivation won’t let him activate the bloodline to its limit anyway, he has no chance.” The other girls were sure of this.

Meanwhile, the ancestors from other sects didn’t bother arguing. They were too busy celebrating after learning about this fight.

“Looks like there is no salvaging this relationship.” One ancestor said: “Ancestral City considers Li Qiye their jeel right now. Well, it doesn’t matter who dies, one side will be furious.”

These powers were eager to see a conflict between the top dogs. They might be able to take advantage of the situation.

“Bai Jianchan had no choice but to fight.” A high elder there knew about the tough situation.

Li Qiye declared his murderous intent in public. Not to mention a top genius like Bai Jianchan, no other youths could stay calm after this humiliation.

His reputation would be ruined if he were to refuse. People would question his number one rank that has already been damaged by Li Qie’s showing at the hall. He needed to use his power to protect his prestige.

“I wonder if Li Qiye has anything else up his sleeve.” A big shot became excited since he has been watching Li Qiye the entire time: “Something conventional won’t do. He’ll really be killed then.”

“Who knows? Li Qiye is inscrutable. He might repeat the same devilishness during the battle.” An old man said.

“It’s worth watching for sure.” This was the consensus.
