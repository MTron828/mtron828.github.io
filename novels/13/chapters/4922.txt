Chapter 4923: Swordgrasp Young Noble

Swordgrasp Young Noble had an ugly expression. Jian Yunyun was not only challenging his prestige but also provoking Deity.

They only wanted to search, not expecting so much resistance to the point of it being a matter of The Race versus The People.

The racial animosity was long-lasting in the past even in the lower three continents. Alas, the end of the great war resulted in peace. They intermingled among themselves and stopped fighting.

Minor skirmishes were unavoidable but the overall picture looked optimistic.

Abroad Hall was the perfect example. Not to mention the students, even conquerors from both sides co-existed in peace.

Now, Swordgrasp Young Noble took pride in his bloodline and background. Therefore, it was inevitable for him to look down on The People.

However, these students were shouting and putting down The Race? He naturally didn’t stand for this.

“It sounds like The People are a bunch of thieves, not willing to be transparent. Sinners will always be sinners, their vicious nature will never be gone. However, you have gone too far by stealing from Deity. This is punishable by death.” Swordgrasp didn’t hold back.

“Bah!” Ming Shi instantly responded: “You act as if The Race and Deity are superior. If Deity was so great, why couldn’t it stop Luminous Conqueror from crushing it?”

“That’s right, Deity doesn’t get to bully people without consequences!” A few students from The People started shouting.

“Demon will stand with The People here since Deity has overstepped its bounds.” Another cultivator spoke: “Your lineage lost something and immediately suspected us, wanting to search students’ homes. Do you still view everyone as sinners? No, this is Abroad, show some respect.”

This person was none other than Goldcrest Young Noble from Demon. He chose to support Ming Shi and Jian Yunyun because he wanted to please Yunyun.

Back before the classification, many demons were part of the hundred races. They were deemed sinners by Celestial Court as well.

Today, Demon stood with The People. The ten great mountains didn’t always follow the rule but they often supported The People if a choice had to be made.

“Well said!” Many supported him: “Goldcrest is indeed a genius of Demon and our faction!”

Of course, he didn’t care for these praises and got closer to Yunyun: “Miss Jian, do you agree?”

“You’re completely right, Brother Goldcrest.” She said flatly.

Though she wasn’t overly receptive, he was still more than satisfied: “Thank you, thank you.”

Ming Shi smirked at him and said: “I didn’t know a rooster is this good at pleasing women.”

“No, I was merely telling the truth.” Goldcrest laughed heartily.

“So shameless.” Ming shi commented.

Those from Deity were surrounded on all fronts. Swordgrasp Young Noble’s expression became increasingly unhappy.

“Is this a challenge to Deity?” He uttered coldly.

“Don’t try to scare us, paper tiger. You don’t speak for Deity or Conceal Conqueror.” Ming Shi barked back: “Let me ask you then, is this a challenge to Untethered?”Fiind upd𝒂ted 𝒏ovels on n𝒐/v/elbin(.)co/m

She copied his tone and demeanor for the last phrase before bursting out in laughter. The crowd seemed to enjoy her joke and laughed as well. Her bold attitude gave them confidence in that Deity wouldn’t be able to act with wanton disregard.

Li Qiye also smiled because he enjoyed her quick-witted tongue.

“Looks like it’s time to find out who is superior.” Swordgrasp was livid.

“Clank!” A sword flash gleamed in his eyes.

Everyone felt a terrible sword dao wafting in the air. Weaker students were immediately suppressed.

“An Immortal Sovereign.” Even top students retreated, not daring to be brave.

Only students such as Ming Shi, Jian Yunyun, and Goldcrest Young Noble could withstand it.

“If you’re looking for a fight, you got it.” Yunyun activated her Heavenraiser Tree again.

“You can prevent this by handing the brat over.” He gazed at Li Qiye.

“You don’t get to command people in Abroad.” She said.

“Miss Yun, there is no need to involve yourself over him, it is a serious matter.” Halo Scion urged.

“No, if Swordgrasp Young Noble wishes to be imperious, then I want to see his sword dao today.” Goldcrest stepped in front of Yunyun, wanting to fight in her stead.

“How decisive, I’m sure Big Sis will appreciate your move.” Ming Shi gave him a thumbs-up and said: “Teach that Swordgrasp a lesson, leave the Halo brat to me, wait, no, Big Sis can fight him.”

“Very well.” Goldcrest was motivated due to his competitive nature on top of this being a chance to earn romance points.

His demonic energy surged. Though he was small in stature, people felt as if he has become a giant.

“What an impressive aura, he is definitely a top contender.” One spectator said.

“So be it.” Swordgrasp intensified his aura and immobilized many spectators.

“...” Many trembled in fear after sensing this sword energy.

“Halo, shall we spar?” Yunyun asked.

Halo Scion smiled wryly and glanced at Li Qiye: “Miss Yun, you know that I have no intention of fighting you. However, if he is actually the culprit, I once again ask you to hand him over, not because I’m working for Deity or anything. I’m serious when I say that Deity has several ancient ancestors here right now, I only want what’s best for you.”

This was indeed the truth. He came from Heaven Burial and didn’t need to work so hard. However, he was good friends with Swordgrasp’s group.

Most importantly, he wanted Yunyun to stay away from this mess because Deity had powerful cultivators available.
