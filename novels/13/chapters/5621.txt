Chapter 5622: Fellow Daoist, Please Halt

“Boom!” The energy palm finally crumbled along with all the defensive barriers.

Everyone felt Thousand Emperor Island sinking downward. Their chest caved in from the pressure; some vomited blood due to the pain.

Titanic vanished for a split second before standing in the same spot again. Everything happened so quickly but loud explosions detonated above.

“Rumble!” Big shots saw a mighty force heading straight at Empress Star, creating a direct passageway.

Buildings along the way exploded despite being empowered and blessed by imperial laws and ancient runes. Unfortunately, Titanic had utilized her speed to its limit.

Regular emperors and monarchs could no longer see her, only remnant images scattering everywhere.

Her movement resembled a raging storm of destruction, leaving only ruins and awe.

“Bam!” The main impact left the sky vault in shambles and everyone else down on their knees. In the next second, they were thrown into the air.

The waters outside of the region were forcefully yanked up countless meters, creating massive tsunamis in all directions.

Titanic combined both strength and speed at once, wanting to crush the suppression of Empress Star.

“Boom!” This extraordinary attempt still couldn’t break through the invisible suppression.

Everyone saw something resembling an invisible film of energy. Although she deeply pressed against the film like a sharp needle, it didn’t puncture through.

Her overwhelming force rebounded and almost caused her to spew blood, sending her flying.

She roared and activated a bright radiance, becoming as large as heaven and earth. This allowed her to withstand the backlash at the last second before smashing into the ground.

This empowered state shocked spectators. Her power seemed to be above the other apex cultivators.

“Boom!” A primordial dao fruit surged into the air, causing space to twist chaotically and turn into primordial chaos. Unstable energies circled around the fruit, turning it into the center of the universe.

“So that’s a primordial dao fruit.” Emperors and monarchs were suppressed by the radiant fruit.

Titanic became serious and activated her true potential. The entire continent was affected by her channeling.

No one wanted to oppose her right now; their only reaction was to let out a sharp breath of astonishment. Visitt nov𝒆lbin(.)c𝒐/m for the l𝒂test updates

She didn’t give up just yet, wanting to use her primordial fruit to aid her immortal bone.

“Fellow Daoist, please halt.” Someone spoke while the region was quaking uncontrollably.

The voice was neither loud nor imposing but rather, gentle like the whispers of a traditional woman.

Nonetheless, everyone heard her clearly. The words seemed to be as tenacious as the suppression of Empress Star. Nothing could break this voice from entering the mind.

Everyone looked up and saw a woman blocking the way of Titanic Conqueror.

She wore a slightly dark green dress, reminiscent of the hue from a wild forest growing on top of a mountain range.

She seemed petite while standing opposite Titanic Conqueror despite being the same height. This was because the latter gave the impression of being a gigantic statue while she looked like a beautiful lady from the sunny river land to the south - charming and graceful while strolling in the misty rain with an oil-paper umbrella.

She brimmed with spirituality while her eyes shimmered with gentle autumn waves. There was a gentle aura of water around her, comforting those nearby.

Her life force was overwhelming and made people forget about her beautiful appearance. People couldn’t help wanting to be near her and breathe deeply, basking in the refreshing air often found near a lake early in the morning.
