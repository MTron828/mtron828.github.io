Chapter 5000: Idiotic Or Not?

The youths didn’t understand why Flame-eater Child chose to gift the god source to an enemy.

The original god source broke down into six pieces. Goldcrest had one and so did Lil’ Freckle. She ended up giving it to Li Qiye and now, he was about to obtain another without doing a single thing.

They wondered why this happened. Was it because Li Qiye was powerful?

No, this couldn’t be the case because Goldcrest didn’t give his to Li Qiye. The god source was useful to him but at the same time, he knew that Li Qiye didn’t need it at all.

“Let me see your eyes.” Li Qiye accepted the god source and noticed something else. He crouched down to be on the same level as Flame-eater Child.

As one of The Ten Monsters, this boy had massacred countless. The difference was that the others did it knowingly.

The same couldn’t be said about the boy. He seemed to have an intellectual deficiency since birth. It was as if he didn’t know what he was doing or the morality behind it. Moreover, he obeyed Wild Dragon for some of these atrocities.

His eyes were dull and even lifeless, giving a sense of confusion and chaos. How did this boy become a three-fruit dragon lord?

Wild Dragon, the closest person to him, had wondered about this issue as well. What was the secret behind the boy’s success with cultivation?

Li Qiye observed for a while before focusing his gaze on the boy’s eyes, seemingly trying to push away the chaos to get a closer look.

“Boom!” The flames of madness immediately engulfed the boy and burned everything around him.

This prompted the youths to react quickly and hide behind Li Qiye.

“Ahh!” Something stimulated the boy and caused him to run away, disappearing into the mountain.

“You scared him, Young Noble.” Ming Shi said.

“Yes.” Li Qiye nodded while staring in that direction.Visjt n𝒐velbin(.)c𝒐m for new updates

“I don’t know what happened to him, he doesn’t look like an evil person.” Ming Shi commented.

“It’s all because of Wild Dragon, he simply followed orders. In my opinion, he doesn’t have an opinion on his victims, whether they deserve death or otherwise.” Yunyun responded.

“How does someone like him become a dragon lord?” Goldcrest smiled wryly.

“He’s not a fool.” Li Qiye shook his head: “His sixth sense might be sealed.”

“Sixth sense? Who did it? Plus, shouldn’t that stop him from cultivating successfully as well?” Yunyun became startled.

“You’re right, you can’t cultivate like that.” Ming Shi chimed in.

“That’s the interesting part. There is a story behind this, I don’t know why yet.” Li Qiye was interested.

“Should we help him figure it out?” Ming Shi felt the same way, thinking that Li Qiye could solve this mystery.

“Let’s go, he won’t be far.” Li Qiye was interested because the boy took the initiative to give him the god source, not the god source itself.

Thus, he put Shadowrider aside and focused on Flame-eater Child first.

The youths were curious as well, wanting to know how a slow-witted cultivator like him could reach the realm of the dragon lords.

He ran fast but not fast enough to escape Li Qiye’s pursuit. Nonetheless, Li Qiye took his time and was in no hurry.

“Young Noble, why did Lil’ Freckle and Flame-eater give you their god source?” Yunyun couldn’t help but ask. One was an enemy while the other didn’t have any relationship with Li Qiye.

“If we must come up with a reason, it is because they are pure of heart and intuitively know who should possess these god sources.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Hey, did you hear that?” Ming Shi teased Goldcrest: “Those two are pure of heart, hence their gift. And what about you? You’ve been following the young noble for so long yet you are still keeping the god source. Your heart must be rather tainted.”

Goldcrest turned red and put on an awkward smile: “The young noble can take it whenever he needs it.”

“These things don’t matter to me, it’s just amusing that they chose to give it to me.” Li Qiye said.

“Right, how strange.” Ming Shi agreed with that statement.

“Boom!” They eventually saw a terrifying inferno ahead. It possessed two elements - fire and water. This combination scorched and flatten an entire mountain range. The slow beasts and birds couldn’t escape in time, meeting their demise.

“Maddened Flame!” Yunyun shouted after seeing the violent and chaotic inferno. It was out of control compared to the usual dao flames.

“Elemental King is here too?” Goldcrest recognized the user.

The group rushed forward and saw that this king was fighting against Flame-eater Child.
