Chapter 5511: I Can’t Watch This Anymore

Of course, the actual parties didn’t have as much fun. One was drinking and eating while the other seemed happy to play along, seemingly having an implicit understanding.

Qin Baifeng had a faint smile on her face since she couldn’t compare to her senior sister in this regard. The latter had a brightness without any pretension, akin to the purity of a newborn.

“Do you notice anything peculiar, Young Noble?” She knew that Li Qiye had a different perspective than anyone else.

“Of course it is peculiar, that is why your ancestor left it behind.” He said with a smile.

“Our ancestor left secrets in the manor as well, I wonder if you can spot them.” Sunset Glow Goddess said.

“Junior Sister, those are our sect’s secrets.” Mu Shaoyun couldn’t help but remind her.

Ultimately, Li Qiye was still an outsider and no sects would want their secrets to be leaked. The problem was that Sunset Glow’s members couldn’t figure it out.

“He is not an outsider.” She winked at Li Qiye who smiled back at her.

“Wow, I can’t watch this couple anymore, I’m so jealous.” A female disciple said enviously while holding her cheeks: “It’s so obvious that she’s in love now.”

“Right, has to be love at first sight, a match made in heaven.” Another enjoyed the show.

Mu Shaoyu could bear this public affection no longer. He felt as if Li Qiye was stealing something belonging to him.

“What is he if not an outsider?” A surge of jealousy and resentment overwhelmed him as he blurted out.

Unfortunately, she didn’t see his vexed expression since she only had eyes for Li Qiye. Her bright smile dazzled the crowd and made them think that she was in love. Of course, Qin Baifeng knew that this was not the case.

Her senior sister had a profound insight, capable of noticing things that would be disregarded by others.

“The young noble can become our Emperor Consort.” She said before staring at Li Qiye: “Am I right, Young Noble?”

Li Qiye smiled and sipped his tea without answering. On the other hand, Shaoyun looked as if he was struck by lightning. The crowd clamored as well.

“Emperor Consort? That used to happen, right?” A female disciple became excited.

“Yes, but that was in the distant past.” An older disciple didn’t dare to make a joke out of this matter.

“According to the historical record, our valley lords can pick their husbands to take control of the sect. This only happened during extraordinary circumstances.” Someone who knew of this tradition elaborated.

“I actually like that, no longer need to leave the valley, they can stay here and give birth to some cute babies.” One of them would be elated to see this.

“Well, First Sister might not become the valley lord, and the valley lord can’t just pick an Emperor Consort.” The first disciple knew about the rules.

“Who else is in the running, Senior Sister Qin?” Another glanced at Qin Baifeng and whispered: “Wait, doesn’t it look like she’ll pick him too? Are they competing for the same guy?”

“No way.” The group became surprised.

“She’s sitting next to him too, it’s just that she’s more reserved. In my opinion, she has to like someone to be that close to him.” The female disciple insisted.

Everyone looked over and sure enough, Qin Baifeng occasionally stole glances at Li Qiye. They interpreted this as a sign of affection and now, it suddenly became a love triangle. They finally had a love story for the ages.

“Wow, so romantic, two beauties loving the same man.” One said: “And just an ordinary outsider too. No need for reason or logic, love triumphs all.”

“Right, right.” Her friend added: “I understand now, they’re competing to be the valley lord because whoever wins will get to pick him as Emperor Consort. So the grand ceremony will be a husband-picking ceremony too.”

“Who’s gonna win?” A third asked.

“Well, the loser will be so sad, losing both the valley lord position and her love.” One of them said: “That’s tragic.”F0lloww new 𝒄hapters at nov/(e)l/bin/(.)com

“It doesn’t have to be like that.” Someone stroked her chin and said: “They can both marry him, that’s a good ending.”

Although they were whispering, Mu Shaoyun still overheard them and became increasingly agitated.

“Shut up!” He shouted.

The girls were startled but after coming to their senses, some stuck out their tongue at him. After all, they were inner disciples and he had no authority over them despite being stronger.
