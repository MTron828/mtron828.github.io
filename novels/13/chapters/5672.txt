Chapter 5673: Leave It To Me

Another woman served as the protector. Her face was covered by an illusion of the azure. She wore all white with a jade pendant hanging from the ribbon on her waist. Her simple style only highlighted her grace and nobility.

The loose dress couldn’t hide her flawless curves and valley. Tall and slender with shoulders seemingly sculpted to perfection - one couldn’t find any point of criticism.

It was a shame that her face was hidden by a special method. Her imperial aura enveloped the area and protected the four women above the wheel of time.

The four had an immensely pure bloodline. Their vitality took root everywhere, grooming both the grand dao and the runes in this world.

The tree known as Nirvana Primal could be seen and its roots flashed with primordial light. The deepest root was connected to a branch extending to another world. This was part of the primordial tree.

Another affinity brimming in every inch of soil was the powers of divine beasts. This world seemed so close yet so distant, stretching through an infinite river.

The empress and fairy’s timeline became separated due to these special forces. The blink of an eye lasted an eternity. They seemed to be slumbering and no one could get to them.

“Rumble!” The eternal time flow suddenly quaked, seemingly affected by an unknown power.

Instability came next and cracks appeared in the shining world. Its destruction would take down all the women within as well.

“Young Master, this looks bad! The overlord is awakening!” One of the women in the ocean of intents blurted.

“Clank!” The ocean gathered more power and gleamed sharply, ready to deliver a slash capable of decapitating an immortal.

“Leave it to me.” Li Qiye said with a serious expression.

He activated his primordial energy and synergized with the base of the foundation. The world resonated radiantly with his call.

He raised his hand and a primordial tree slowly floated upward, pushing up everything else - whether it be the wheel of time, Nirvana Primal Tree, and Bi’an Beastworld. The tree became the center of everything and took control of High Heaven Aegis, fully supporting it.

“Buzz.” The rays of the tree appeared sentient as they entered High Heaven Aegis and the women within. Aall 𝒏𝒆west ch𝒂pt𝒆rs on n.o./v𝒆l𝒃i/n/(.)c𝒐m

Dual-blade Immortals, Skyshroud Emperor, the four ladies of the Blood Race, Immortal Assailant Emperor, Emperor Ye...

All were blessed by his primordial light. The rays were able to reach them despite their isolated state and seeped into them.

Although they couldn’t recover back to their prior state, they glowed brightly and became connected with the primordial tree.

“Boom!” A dark beam deep in High Heaven Aegis tore the sky apart, wanting to break out.

However, another golden beam empowered by an inborn trinity emerged. It resembled a heavenly prison and instantly dragged the dark beam back.

Loud explosions resulted from the contest between the two supreme powers. High Heaven Aegis shook violently as a result.

Fortunately, Li Qiye was here and sealed the entire realm with his primordial energy. The two women in the ocean of swords and sabers heaved a sigh of relief afterward.

Meanwhile, Imperial Field also shook violently. Those aware of High Heaven Aegis’ position immediately gazed in its direction.

Three divine rings flashed and illuminated the entire immortal continent, leaving behind an indelible mark.

“How can this be, still alive?” The emperors and monarchs became startled.

The ones in Imperial Field felt something ominous coming; their mood soured.

“Not again, another Grand Dao War.” An emperor murmured.

As everyone remained confused about the sudden development, a middle-aged swordsman arrived above Thousand Emperor Island.

His presence commanded attention, so everyone else obeyed. All eyes were on him.

He was an Immortal Emperor whose twelve wills had already been activated, floating above him. His aura engulfed all the islands below.

He no longer held back his power and resembled a monstrous existence whose presence was too much for the islands to support.

Staring at him gave the impression of looking at a boundless ocean with no end in sight. Spectators felt that he was even larger than all of Imperial Field.

Despite his incredible aura, the most striking thing about him was the sword he carried on his back. Emperors and monarchs who saw it couldn’t help but gasp in astonishment.
