Chapter 5061: Gift

While everyone imagined the battle or talked with their friends, Li Qiye didn’t think much of it.

Those nearby couldn’t help but admire him after seeing this. No one could stay composed when a duel with Conceal Conqueror was on the horizon.

At this time, Li Qiye placed his hands on the divine beast tablet and activated it again. Its light rushed upward and came back down like a waterfall, eventually forming a maelstrom.

The markings on the tablet - whether it be from a bird claw or the paw of a bear or the mark of a true dragon - fell off the tablet like runes and joined the maelstrom.

“Rumble!” The maelstrom seemed to be a bridge to another dimension.

Spectators watched attentively, unaware of Li Qiye’s intention.

After a short while, the maelstrom and the runes fused together to form a dao portal. Rays and a majestic presence oozed out from the other side of the portal.

“The divine nest!” Vine God gasped after seeing this.

This was the most enigmatic location of Demon and could be the source of their dao. Only the most fortunate gained entry. Strength alone was not enough, even someone like Conceal Conqueror couldn’t have done this but Li Qiye was one exception.

All eyes were on the portal because entering meant obtaining a peerless fortune. This was especially true for the demons. They could gain incredible cultivation or even start a deity branch.

However, no one dared to make a move because Li Qiye was the one who opened it.

“Feel like taking a look?” He waved at the two young girls.

“Yeah!” Ming Shi jumped to his side without thinking twice.RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

Yunyun, on the other hand, hesitated for a moment before bowing: “Young Noble, you have given me plenty so I cannot accept this. Moreover, I have understood something and wish to return to the sect if that is okay with you.”

Others could only dream about entering the nest yet she refused this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

In recent days by Li Qiye’s side, she had gained a deeper understanding of the dao. Moreover, he had given her something peerless as well.

She thought that she shouldn’t be greedy. Possessing too many fortunes might actually be a bad thing. After all, people’s talents and abilities varied.

“Good, knowing when to stop.” Li Qiye nodded approvingly and said: “One can also obtain invincibility by focusing on a single dao, go.”

Yunyun prostrated before Li Qiye to show respect before leaving.

The crowd couldn’t believe that she was actually giving it up. They thought that it would be so nice if they were in her shoes.

“I took your divine fragment.” Li Qiye then spoke to Tendril King: “And it won’t be for nothing, come.”

“Me?” Tendril King was surprised. Of course she wanted to enter the divine nest because she was also a demon. All demons in the lower continents dreamed about this moment.

As a five-fruit dragon lord, her goal wasn’t to obtain an invincible art. She knew that only the users were invincible, not the art itself.

She simply wanted to polish her own grand dao and demon source. The divine nest was the perfect place for this. This was why she came running after hearing about Peacock Monarch’s lifespan.

Her plan failed because of Li Qiye but now, it seemed that she had made the right choice.

Li Qiye didn’t wait for her response and entered the portal.

“Senior Aunt, let’s go.” Ming Shi happily said before entering the portal as well.

Tendril King calmed down and followed the two of them, leaving the envious crowd behind.

The portal dispersed after the three of them were inside. The divine tablet gradually sank to the ground and disappeared.

“Such a monumental event.” Vine God reflected.

As the oldest being in Demon, he had seen legends and invincible masters. Alas, there was no one like Li Qiye who defied logic and conventional wisdom.

“Go back now, everyone.” Vine God said.

The commanding gods sat back down on their thrones. Goldcrest seemed rather confused as well, not knowing what to do.

Fortunately, Golden Cicada King came over to help him out and told him the various responsibilities and tasks.

After all, the king knew everything about Bug previously. Although it was Kun now, the worshippers were still the same demons and animals.

With his help, Goldcrest was able to harness the power of worship and improved his cultivation drastically.

After entering the portal, the trio was teleported to another world with a vast azure. The stars up there were brimming with life but upon closer inspection, they noticed certain damages that couldn’t be healed completely - holes that weren’t filled entirely or rough edges.

Moreover, the way they were arranged seemed to be unnatural and not part of the original scheme. A supreme power must have mended and re-created this entire world.
