Chapter 4240: Rising Greed

Finality was the source of the current dao system in Sword Continent. The strongest powers all utilized the various techniques found in this scripture.

For example, Sea Emperor Sword Kingdom was founded by Sword Sea Dao Lord using the dao named Vastsea.

This also applied to Sword Temple with the Terra Sword Dao. And for Daoist Sword Ground, War God Sword Dao.

Thus, in the grand scheme of things, the continent was rather familiar with the heavenly swords and heavenly dao. However, none had seen Finality itself.

If this was the truth, then how did the dao lords come across the sword dao?

“Maybe the dao comes with the sword.” One big shot said.

When Myriad Era came out, there were dao runes and flames burning it as well. Perhaps the dao lords experienced the same thing when they found their heavenly sword.

“Is he the only person in history to possess Finality? Where did he get this scripture?” Another cultivator became curious.

The crowd exchanged glances of confusion once more. Too many questions popped up in their mind regarding the origin of this scripture.

“No wonder why he obtained Myriad Era so easily.” There was one question answered.

It seemed that Li Qiye had understood the profundities of Finality. This allowed him to control Myriad Era.

“All nine heavenly sword dao are in there. Its owner can cultivate all nine…” Hearts started beating faster and eyes became unconsciously filled with greed.

Everyone believed that Sea Emperor’s unmatched success was predicated on them possessing Abyss and Vastsea Sword Dao.

What if another sect were to obtain Finality? This should be enough to dominate all of Eight Desolaces for eras to come, perhaps even surpassing True Immortal Sect!

“I wonder what the content looks like.” One cultivator loudly wondered.

“Hmm, olden language or regular dao runes?” A big shot replied.

“It would be nice if everyone could take a look.” Someone had an unreasonable request.

After all, who wouldn’t want to take a look at a heavenly scripture? They hoped that Li Qiye would actually entertain this request.

Even the two overlords were tempted. As the strongest characters in Sword Continent, they had seen peerless treasures and merit laws before, including portions of this scripture. Nonetheless, to see the real thing was something else.

Prior to this, the sect was the primary reason why they wanted Myriad Era. They didn’t require the sword personally.

Everything changed the moment Finality showed up. Their sects were lucky to have some of the embedded dao but never an actual scripture.

If they could obtain Finality for their sect, it would guarantee prosperity and domination for ages to come. This meant that their status and contribution would exceed the founders, Sword Sea and Nine-wheel Dao Lord. Thus, this scripture was immensely tempting.

They could have backed off and let Li Qiye have Myriad Era. Alas, greed overwhelmed them this time around.

“Fellow Daoist, could you broaden everyone’s horizon by showing us the peerless heavenly scripture?” Vastsea Venerable asked.

All eyes were on Li Qiye. Instead of asking to borrow it, he requested for everyone to have a look as if he was their representative.

“Yes, show us what the scripture looks like.” Some crowd members chimed in.

“Everyone wants to take a look?” Li Qiye had a smirk on his face. RE𝒂ad updated st𝒐ries at n/𝒐/vel/bin(.)com

“Yes, we want to take a look!”

“Of course, Young Noble Li, you’ll become the greatest figure by blessing the world with its content…”

They flattered Li Qiye, hoping to persuade him. If he were to say no, then he would appear to be the bad guy.

“No chance.” Li Qiye flatly responded and interrupted the rowdy crowd.

The audience immediately shut up. In the past, they would have chastised and expressed their dissatisfaction.

Now, doing so meant courting death. Even the overlords were wary of Li Qiye. They turned their gaze towards the duo, hoping that they would take the lead.

The sentiment shifted abruptly. Those who used to be on Li Qiye’s side changed their mind with haste.
