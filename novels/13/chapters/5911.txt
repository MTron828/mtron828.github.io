Chapter 5911: Not Like Anyone Can Chase You Out

After the previous session spanning eras, Li Qiye had returned to the source - a mortal.

Despite knowing he was the epoch lord, no one could sense a hint of cultivation emanating from him. He could join the crowd in the mortal world and no one would be the wiser. The high heaven might not be able to find him either due to a lack of dao presence.

He walked with a sword wrapped in a cloth bundle tied to his back. It looked old and inconspicuous - just a weapon for self-defense.

This was the legendary blade from Sword Burial Ground and Li Qiye seemed interested in testing it.

“About to leave?” World Emperor, who knew Li Qiye’s location the best, asked.

“Yes.” Li Qiye smiled.

World was amazed to see Li Qiye’s current appearance - a mortal in tune with the natural order or rather, the natural order was in tune with him.

“Right, it’s time to go.” World paused momentarily before asking: “There’s something I want to ask you.”

“Go ahead.” Li Qiye said. Explore new 𝒏ovels on n𝒐velbi𝒏(.)com

“Is she still there?” World was an Ancestor at this point but still became emotional upon asking this.

It had been so long since he last saw her and memories became faint.

“I hope so.” Li Qiye glanced at the horizon and said softly.

“There’s a chance?” World clenched his fists and trembled emotionally. Perhaps he still held onto hopes about meeting her again.

“Yes, you can make a trip there.” Li Qiye sighed.

World took a deep breath and stabilized his emotion: “If it’s meant to be, the karmic ties will make it happen.”

He had suffered more than people could imagine, losing numerous family members in the past. Although he hoped for the best, he could accept any outcome.

“It should since the karma was planted by you.” Li Qiye said.

“Good.” World took a deep breath and noticed something else: “You have changed, breaking out of the cocoon and no longer Dark Crow.”

“Yes, but a brand is more than just a personal thing, it exists in others’ memories too. They still subconsciously view me as Dark Crow.” Li Qiye said.

“You wouldn’t have been able to try again as Dark Crow or failure was imminent.” World commented.

“Yes, so here we are now, a natural development with an indomitable dao heart. Shackles no longer stop me because I do not belong in this world.” Li Qiye said.

“Indeed.” World smiled wryly.

“Just another passerby.” Li Qiye smiled.

“Isn’t this a bit cruel to yourself? You’ll be gone without leaving anything behind. All traces of you will evaporate from your home.” World let out a sigh.

“I can’t stay since it’ll be cruel to both myself and the epoch.” Li Qiye accepted this at this point so he smiled sincerely.

“...” World had no response.

“Staying is detrimental to my dao heart and with that, I will no longer be the exception. It won’t be difficult for me to fall into the darkness then.” Li Qiye said: “And you can easily imagine what my dark self will do to the epoch.”

World trembled upon hearing this. At first, top cultivators wanted him to stay since he would be the ultimate protector, not to mention being able to enjoy a peaceful life.

However, stopping meant his dao heart being shaken. Protection wouldn’t be the main reason for his stay but rather, fear - the absence of courage to reach the end of the grand dao.

It would take time but his downfall should be inevitable. He would devour the epoch and no one would be able to escape - not his loved ones or those who have fought with him previously.

Most importantly, who in this epoch could stop a fallen Li Qiye?

“This is why I must be a passerby, nothing more. I cannot stop on my dao path lest I become a calamity to this world. I must be chased out like the scourge.” He added.

“Not like anyone can chase you out.” World couldn’t help but laugh.

“True.” Li Qiye nodded in agreement.

“Such a lonely path.” World said sentimentally.

Li Qiye was destined to walk alone until the terminus of the dao without ever looking back. Moreover, this road stretched infinitely, spanning countless years.

He knew the outcome and the torturous experiences along the way yet he made up his mind.

“I was blessed with wonderful encounters and people already.” Li Qiye smiled.

“I hope you will be able to meet them again.” World gave his blessing.

“Me too.” Li Qiye bowed respectfully.

World bowed back and said: “Go.”

***

Li Qiye began his departure unbeknown to the world. Only the core emperors came to send him off.

World, Sword, Hao Hai, Ren Xian, Demon, Nightmoon, and many others. Stonesplitter Patriarch came as well.

“Sacred Teacher, this is it. We wish you nothing but the most resplendent result for your final battle.” World spoke while everyone else prostrated respectfully.

Li Qiye cupped his fist and said: “Ladies and gentlemen, farewell.”

With that, he broke through the spatial fabric and ascended to the next.

“Farewell.” They prostrated for a long time before getting up. Some had tears in their eyes.
